    "abstractText": "The nonlinear optical properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in distilled water were measured using a femtosecond laser and the Z-scan technique. The ZnONPs colloids were created by the ablation of zinc bulk in distilled water with a 532 nm Nd: YAG laser. Transmission electron microscopy, an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry were used to determine the size, shape, absorption spectra, and concentration of the ZnONPs colloids. The nonlinear absorption coefficient and nonlinear refractive index were measured at different excitation wavelengths and intensities. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of the ZnONPs colloids was found to be positive, caused by reverse saturable absorption, whereas the nonlinear refractive index was found to be negative due to self-defocusing in the ZnONPs. Both laser parameters, such as excitation wavelength and input intensity, and nanoparticle features, such as concentration and size, were found to influence the nonlinear optical properties of the ZnONPs.",

            "text": "Recently, the development of intense ultrafast lasers has attracted great attention from many researchers for the study of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials [1,2]. Materials with a strong nonlinearity and fast response times are important in many fields, such as nonlinear spectroscopy [3,4], optical switch [5], optical data-storage [6], biomedicine [7,8], and optoelectronic devices [9\u201311]. Future optoelectronic devices are predicted to be small in size with a high performance and high operation speeds. Nanomaterials are thought to be the appropriate medium for these devices [12]. Among nanomaterials, the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) nanomaterial is one of the best candidates for applications in the abovementioned fields. The combination of unique optical and electrical properties of TCO makes it a crucial element in a variety of optoelectronic devices. TCO nanomaterials are wide-bandgap semiconductors (>3.1 eV) characterized by high transparency in the visible range and high carrier density, which makes it electrically conductive [13,14]. TCO nanomaterials are of particular interest in the domain of NLO due to their large optical nonlinearity and short response time [15,16], as well as the fact that their NLO properties can be adapted by controlling the size and shape or doping with metallic ions [12,17]. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are one particular type of TCO nanomaterial that has attracted great attention because of their wide bandgap, negligible absorption in the visible region and large exciton-binding energy of 60 meV at room temperature [18],\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 4220. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12234220 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 4220 2 of 16\nhigh mechanical and chemical stability, and low cost [19]. This combination of properties has made them a powerful element in many applications, such as electronics [20], nanomedicine [21], bioinspired systems [22], and communications [23]. Owing to their perfect crystalline nature, stability at high temperature and pressure, and high transparency in a wide-band optical region, ZnONPs are considered to be a suitable material in many nonlinear optical devices, including optical limiters, new frequency generation, optical switches, biological imaging and treatment with high resolution [24\u201326], and UV-blue nanolasers [27,28]. Based on the stated applications, there has been a lot of interest in the synthesis and study of the NLO properties of ZnONPs. Several physical and chemical approaches, including solgel [29], thermal plasma [30], hydrothermal methods [31], and pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) [32], have recently been investigated for the liquid-phase synthesis of ZnONPs. PLAL is one of the most important physical approaches for producing NPs from their bulk form. When compared with other methods for obtaining metal colloids, PLAL is advantageous due to its ability to create high-purity nanomaterials using a simpler, faster, and direct methodology that does not require many steps or long process times [33]. It gives a smaller NP size with a narrower size distribution as compared with other conventional techniques [34]. Furthermore, PLAL is a flexible and environmentally friendly approach that enables the synthesis of a wide range of NPs without the use of any toxic or hazardous substances [32,35]. In PLAL, the high-intensity laser light is targeted on the surface of the solid target immersed in liquid. The sizes and shapes of the nanoparticles created by PLAL can be controlled by adjusting the laser beam\u2019s parameters [36]. It is a one-step process that can result in ready-to-use batches without the need for additional sorting procedures [37]. The techniques for studying the NLO properties of ZnONPs are, e.g., nonlinear interferometry, optical Kerr gate, degenerate four-wave mixing, beam-distortion measurements, and Z-scan [38,39]. Z-scan [40] is the most comfortable and informative technique due to its experimental simplicity and high sensitivity compared with the other techniques. Z-scan is also applicable to different materials including liquids [41], semiconductors [42], and glasses [43,44]. Several reports [45\u201351] employed the Z-scan technique to explore the NLO properties of ZnO thin films. The results revealed that ZnO thin films had reverse saturable absorption (RSA) and a negative nonlinear refractive index. However, due to the difficulty in creating colloids with high homogeneity and homogeneous sizes and shapes, only a few studies [52,53] have reported on the investigation of ZnO nonlinearity as nanocolloids. Due to thermal effects, the NLO properties of ZnONPs under ns laser pulses are stronger than those under ps laser pulses, according to [52]. On the other hand, [53] looked at the effects of ZnONPs\u2019 shapes and solvents on the NLO properties. ZnO nanospheres have higher NLO properties than ZnO triangular nanostructures. The ZnO nanospheres dispersed in water have higher NLO properties than ZnO nanospheres scattered in 2-propanol. In the present work, ZnONPs colloids were prepared in a nanospheres structure by pulsed laser ablation in distilled water at various concentrations by using the second harmonic Nd: YAG laser with a constant fluence of 28.29 J/cm2. Furthermore, using femtosecond laser pulses and the Z-scan technique, a comprehensive study of the NLO properties of ZnONPs was carried out at different excitation wavelengths ranging from 740 nm to 820 nm and different excitation intensities ranging from 12.7 to 22.2 GW/cm2. The structure of the paper is as follows. The preparation of the ZnONPs colloids and the Z-scan experimental setup are described in Section 2. The experimental results are presented in the third section. The conclusions are presented in section four."

The PLAL is a straightforward thermal effect that involves heating, melting, vaporizing, and ionizing the target material to produce plasma, from which the matter is expelled [57,58]. However, in the present work, the irradiation of the bulk zinc is more related to the photo-fragmentation of the ablated nanoparticles that accumulate close to the laser spot. Once the amount of created nanoparticles becomes sufficiently enormous, they shield the incident laser\u2019s light. Hence, the incident laser energy reaching the zinc bulk is attenuated, which causes no further increase in the number of nanoparticles. As a result, rather than removing material from the zinc bulk, most of the laser\u2019s energy is used to break up the larger ablated particles into smaller ones [59].

However, in the present work, the irradiation of the bulk zinc is more related to the photo-fragmentation of the ablated nanoparticles that accumulate close to the laser spot. Once the amount of created nanoparticles becomes sufficiently enormous, they shield the incident laser\u2019s light.

The th rmal characteristic time estimated for liquids and some optical glasses is higher than 40 \u00b5s [65].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 4220 10 of 16\nTo overcome the problem of accumulative thermal lensing in this study, a new method was used, which is described in [66] as:\n1 f(Z) = a L EpFl\n3 2\n\u03c9(Z)2\n( 1\u2212 1\u221a\nNp\n) (3)\nwhere a is the fitting parameter, a = \u03b1 (dn/dT)/2\u03ba (\u03c03D)1/2, dn/dT is the temperature derivative of the refractive index, Ep is the energy per laser pulse, \u03c9(z) is the radius of the laser beam at the sample, Fl is the repetition rate, L is the sample thickness, and Np is the number of laser pulses incident on the sample. Np = t \u00d7 Fl, where t represents the exposure time for each ZnONPs sample during the scan. The normalized transmittance of the CA Z-scan measurements \u2206TCA, the features of which depend on the focal length of the induced lensing f(Z), is given by [67]:\n\u2206TCA = 1 + 2Z\nf(Z) (4)\nThus, the nonlinear refractive index (n2) can be measured by using the following equation [66\u201368]:\nn2 = \u03bb w02 \u2206\u03c6 2 Ppeak L\n(5)\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 is the phase shift, the Ppeak is the peak power, and L is the length of the sample ('1 mm). The phase shift can be expressed by [66] as:\n\u2206\u03c6 = z0\n2 f (0) (6)\nwhere f (0) is the focal length of the induced thermal lens when the sample is placed at the focus (Z = 0). The CA Z-scan studies were performed for the 5 and 13 mg/L samples of ZnONPs colloids; the samples were irradiated by an excitation wavelength of 800 nm and different incident peak intensities ranging from 12.7 to 22.2 GW/cm2. The closed aperture was adjusted to transmit a fixed fraction of 30% from the total transmitted light in the OA, and the results are shown in Figure 11a\u2013d. The experimental data was fitted to the expression given by Equation (4). In Figure 11, the transmission exhibits a pre-focal peak, followed by a post-focal valley. This reveals that ZnONPs colloids exhibit a negative nonlinear refractive index that is induced by the self-defocusing property of the ZnONPs colloids, which agrees with the previous reports [51,63]. Figure 12 shows the dependence of the nonlinear refractive index on the incident peak intensity. The main reasons for nonlinear refraction in semiconductor materials are the absorptive processes [69,70]. As a result, increasing nonlinear absorption by increasing the intensity as shown in Figure 7 increases the nonlinear refractive index. The data provides that the nonlinear refractive index increases from 55 \u00d7 10\u221216 to 65 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm2/W for a concentration of 5 mg/L and from 95 \u00d7 10\u221216 to 121 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm2/W for a concentration of 13 mg/L with an increasing the incident peak intensity from 12.7 to 22.2 GW/cm2, respectively. The maximum refractive index was found to be at a concentration of 13 mg/L. This is because a higher concentration leads to more ZnONPs, which in turn causes more particles to become excited and enhance the nonlinear response. The CA Z-scan was performed at constant peak intensity of 15.8 GW/cm2 and at different excitation wavelengths of 740 nm, 760, 780, 800 nm, and 820 nm to study the dependance of the nonlinear refractive index on the excitation wavelength for the ZnONPs colloids, as shown in Figure 13a\u2013e.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 4220 11 of 16ano aterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 17\n-10 0 10\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nN or\nm al\niz ed\nT ra\nns m\nitt an\nce\nZ (mm)\nExp. 5 mg/L Fitting 5 mg/L Exp. 13 mg/L Fitting 13 mg/L\nI0= 12.7 GW/Cm2\n(a)\n-10 0 10\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0 (b)\nN or\nm al\niz ed\nT ra\nns m\nitt an\nce\nZ (mm)\nExp. 5 mg/L Fitting 5 mg/L Exp. 13 mg/L Fitting 13 mg/L\nI0= 15.8 GW/Cm2\n-10 0 10\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0 (c)\nN or\nm al\niz ed\nT ra\nns m\nitt an\nce\nZ (mm)\nExp. 5 mg/L Fitting 5 mg/L Exp. 13 mg/L Fitting 13 mg/L\nI0= 19 GW/Cm2\n-10 0 10\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5 2.0 (d) N or m al iz ed T ra ns m itt an ce\nZ (mm)\nExp. 5 mg/L Fitting 5 mg/L Exp. 13 mg/L Fitting 13 mg/L\nI0= 22.2 GW/Cm2\nFigure 11.

            "text": "In the present work, the ZnONPs colloids were prepared at different concentrations using the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser source. The ZnONPs colloids samples were prepared at different ablation times, which affected their bandgaps, sizes, and concentrations. The linear optical properties of the ZnONPs colloids were determined using transmission electron microscopy and an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The nonlinear optical properties of the ZnONPs colloids were investigated using the Z-scan technique by 100 fs laser pulses at an excitation wavelength range from 740 to 820 nm, with a peak intensity that varied from 12.7 to 22.2 GW/cm2. The ZnONPs colloid samples exhibited RSA behavior and three-photon absorption (3PA) at various excitation wavelengths, excitation powers, and concentrations. The closed aperture measurements reveal that the ZnONPs colloid samples exhibited self-defocusing behavior and a negative refractive index. With an increasing laser power, excitation wavelength, and ZnONPs colloids concentration, the 3PA coefficient and nonlinear refractive index increased.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, and preparation, T.M., A.F., M.A., H.A. and S.M.; software, investigation, formal analysis, data curation, and writing\u2014original draft, S.M., T.M., M.A. and A.F.; supervision, project administration, and funding acquisition, R.S. and T.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.M., M.A., A.F., S.M. and R.S.
