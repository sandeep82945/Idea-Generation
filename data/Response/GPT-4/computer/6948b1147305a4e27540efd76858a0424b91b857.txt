Exploration of Different Similarity Metrics for k-NN in NLP: The paper suggests that L2 and cosine similarities perform similarly in integrating k-NN with PLMs. Future research could explore a broader range of similarity metrics, such as Jaccard similarity or weighted distance measures, to understand their impact on performance across various NLP tasks. Investigating adaptive similarity measures that can adjust based on the task or data characteristics could also be valuable.

Cross-lingual and Multilingual Applications of k-NN-Augmented PLMs: Investigating the effectiveness of k-NN augmentation in cross-lingual and multilingual settings would be a significant next step. This includes studying how k-NN can help PLMs better transfer knowledge across languages and whether certain languages or language families benefit more from k-NN augmentation.

Scalability and Efficiency Improvements for k-NN in Large-scale NLP: While integrating k-NN with PLMs shows promising results, the scalability and computational efficiency, especially regarding memory requirements for large data stores, remain challenges. Future work could focus on developing more efficient k-NN retrieval algorithms, possibly through approximation techniques or leveraging recent advancements in hardware accelerators.

Dynamic k-NN for Continual Learning and Adaptation in NLP Models: Exploring dynamic k-NN mechanisms that can adapt the number of neighbors (k) or the selection of neighbors based on the evolving data distribution in a continual learning setting. This includes investigating how k-NN can be used to enable PLMs to adapt to new, unseen data or tasks over time without extensive retraining.

In-depth Analysis of k-NN Augmentation in Adversarial Contexts: Given the robustness indicated by k-NN calibration, future research could delve into how k-NN-augmented PLMs perform in adversarial contexts, such as defending against adversarial attacks or improving model robustness. This includes studying the effects of k-NN augmentation on model interpretability and the ability to provide more reliable predictions under adversarial conditions.
