We hypothesized that prefrontal rTMS in patients with BPD leads to improved BPD symptoms and that these effects are associated with brain connectivity changes.\nMethods: Fourteen patients with BPD received 15 sessions of individually navigated prefrontal rTMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Clinical effects were measured by the Borderline Symptom List 23, UPPS-P, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Montgomery and \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Effects of rTMS on brain connectivity were observed with a seed correlation analysis on resting-state fMRI and with a beta series correlation analysis on Go/No Go tasks during fMRI. Assessments were made before and immediately after the treatment.\nResults: The assessments after rTMS showed significant reductions in two subscales of UPPS-P, and in DERS, SAS, and MADRS. The brain connectivity analysis revealed significant decreases in amygdala and insula connectivity with nodes of the posterior default mode network (pDMN; precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, parietal lobules). Connectivity changes were observed both in the resting state and during inhibition. The decrease of amygdala-pDMN connectivity was positively correlated with reduced depression and lack of premeditation after rTMS.\nConclusions: Despite the study limitations (open single-arm study in a small sample), our findings suggest a possible neural mechanism of rTMS effect in BPD, reduced amygdala connectivity with the pDMN network, which was positively associated with symptom reduction.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, borderline personality disorder, connectivity changes, Go/NoGo task, posterior default mode network"

            "text": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental disorder characterized by instability of affect, self-image, and relationships, and by marked impulsivity including self-harm and recurrent suicidal behavior (1). Treatment of BPD is challenging. The primary treatment for BPD is psychotherapy, especially targeted approaches such as dialectical behavior therapy, schema therapy, mentalization-based treatment, and transference-focused therapy (2). Pharmacotherapy is only targeted at symptoms and is not recommended for the treatment of BPD unless targeting specific comorbidities (3, 4). Therapy dropout rates for BPD patients are typically high (5), and the development of new treatment methods for this life-threatening mental disorder is greatly needed.\nOn the neural level, BPD patients show impairment in multiple networks. Patients with BPD have been reported to show increased involvement of the posterior default mode network (6, 7) and increased connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with the amygdala and insula (8). While processing emotional stimuli, patients with BPD show increased and prolonged reactivity of the amygdala, altered prefrontal cortex responses, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and reduced connectivity between limbic and prefrontal regions as compared to healthy controls in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (9\u201312). Reduced gray matter volume was found in BPD patients in the amygdala, insula, and DLPFC (13). Impaired prefrontal-limbic connections are typically described as a mechanism of impaired top-down emotional control in BPD, leading to increased impulsivity and impaired emotion regulation.\nRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, rTMS) is a potentially innovative method in the treatment of BPD. rTMS was used in patients with BPD in nine studies with a total sample of 72 BPD patients (14\u201322); two of those studies (24 total patients) were placebo-controlled studies (16, 22). Most of the studies targeted the prefrontal cortex because it is hypothesized that high frequency rTMS can increase prefrontal excitability and, subsequently, prefrontal-limbic connectivity. These studies reported good tolerability of the treatment and various effects of rTMS in BPD patients, including improved self-control, emotion regulation, mood, anxiety, and executive functions (23). Only one single case study (15) combined rTMS with neuroimaging, specifically fMRI. Thus, rTMS seems safe and efficient for the treatment of BPD symptoms, but knowledge of the rTMS neural correlate effects is missing and there are no data supporting the hypothesis that prefrontal rTMS leads to increased prefrontallimbic connectivity.\nIn this study, patients with BPD underwent high-frequency rTMS of the right DLPFC (rDLPFC). High-frequency rTMS leads to increased cortex excitability, and patients with BPD have been found to have decreased activation predominantly in right DLPFC as compared to healthy controls (11). Also, Swick et al. (24) observed Go/NoGo (GNG) task activation as generally more right sided and DLPFC as connected with attentional executive control or top-down cognitive control and behavioral inhibition. Our goal was to individually target the inhibition network in\nthe DLPFC area (based on the Go/NoGo task) and subsequently strengthen its activity using high-frequency rTMS in patients with BPD.\nWe hypothesized that prefrontal rTMS in patients with BPD can lead to improved symptoms, specifically to enhanced impulse control and emotion regulation and, based on previous studies, to decreased anxiety and depression. We hypothesized that these effects are associated with brain connectivity changes induced by prefrontal rTMS. We focused on exploring changes in brain connectivity in three regions of interest: the DLPFC, a brain area crucial for emotion and impulse regulation (25, 26) and a stimulation target in this study; the amygdala, a brain area associated with emotion experiencing intensity that is hyperactive in patients with BPD (9); and the insula, a crucial node in the inhibition network (24) and a brain area associated with experiencing negative emotions (27).To maximize the possibility of rTMS enhancing self-control and decreasing impulsivity, we chose individual neuronavigation of the rTMS target based on the fMRI results of a Go/NoGo task. GNG tasks are the most frequent test for measuring waiting impulsivity (28)."

A small number of mistakes is normal in equiprobable tasks such as the one used in our study (28, 49). Regarding the self-reported results, we observed some improvement in all measured variables after the rTMS protocol. The improvement reached statistical significance in emotion regulation (DERS), depression (MADRS), and two UPPS-P impulsivity subscales\u2014Lack of Premeditation and Lack of Perseverance (in other words, the abilities to think before acting and to persist in activities and decisions) and borderline significance in anxiety (SAS). High effects sizes were observed for the changes in Lack of Premeditation and emotion\ndysregulation, medium effect sizes were observed for changes in Lack of Perseverance and in anxiety and depression levels. The results are consistent with previous studies, specifically the decreased anxiety (19, 22), depression (14, 15, 18\u201320, 22), impulsivity (15, 19, 20) and affective instability (16). Overall, rTMS treatment had positive effects on some BPD symptoms including anxiety, depression, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity. Interestingly, only one study (16) used highfrequency stimulation of the right DLPFC such as in our study; other studies used low-frequency stimulation of the same area (19), or high-frequency stimulation of the left DLPFC (14, 15, 19, 20), or DMPFC stimulation (18, 22). Our results are consistent across the previous studies (23). At least two interpretations might be considered here: either the clinical effects are caused by factors other than active stimulation, which might indicate a placebo effect, or the parameters of the stimulation protocol might not play a crucial role in the results, and the rTMS might instead act as a more global prefrontal intervention (thanks to cortico-cortical connections)."

These regions are parts of the posterior default mode network (pDMN), which is associated with self-related (personal) and future-oriented reflection and thinking and emotional and attributional evaluation of situations (50, 51).\nPrevious studies reported increased involvement of pDMN in patients with BPD as compared to healthy controls, suggesting higher self-referential thinking (6, 7). Increased connectivity of the amygdala with pDMN areas has been found to be associated with a number of negatively experienced phenomena, such as depressive rumination [PCC (52)], sleep deprivation [PCC, PCN (53)], complicated grief [PCN (54)], and also history of abuse [PCC, PCN (55)] or risk-taking [PCC, PCN (56)]. Increased connectivity of the amygdala with PCN has been also identified in adolescents who attempted suicide or had high suicidal ideation as compared to adolescents with low suicidal ideation and healthy controls (57).\nImportantly, decreased amygdala connectivity with pDMN (in resting state only) was positively correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and with decreased lack of thinking before acting and planning (Lack of Premeditation). This means that the larger the decrease in amygdala-pDMN connectivity in the resting state after rTMS as compared to before rTMS, the greater the improvement in depressive symptoms and premeditation ability. Thus, our results are consistent with previous literature reporting positive associations of amygdala-pDMN connectivity and borderline or depressive symptoms. Decreasing amygdalapDMN connectivity seems to be beneficial in patients with BPD and was achieved after the prefrontal rTMS protocol in our study.\nIn the inhibition condition, we found decreased connectivity of the PCN and PCC with the left insula after rTMS as compared to before rTMS. Again, there was a decrease of pDMN areas connectivity. The insula processes interoceptive information to engage externally oriented attention and internal cognitive control, helps with integrating information from the limbic system, and is a major part of the inhibition network (24, 58, 59). The PCC, PCN, and insula have been found to be associated with an increased sense of personal agency, with the insula correlating specifically with personal agency in negative situations (50). Higher interconnectedness in the PCN and insula has been found in people with a history of childhood maltreatment (60). In another study, increased connectivity of the insula and PCN distinguished posttraumatic stress disorder patients with and without dissociation symptoms (61). The pDMN has been found to be deactivated during pain, while the insula is activated by pain (62). Increased pDMN-insula connectivity has been reported in patients with BPD during pain processing (63); while decreased pDMN-insula connectivity has been observed in healthy people (64), which might reflect a disturbance in pain processing in BPD and suggest more self-referential experiencing of pain in BPD (63).\nIn our study, we found a negative correlation of decreased insula-pDMN connectivity in the inhibition condition and symptom reduction\u2014specifically with reduced Lack of Perseverance. Though previous studies suggest that decreasing insula-pDMN connectivity could be beneficial in patients with BPD, our data did not support the hypothesis that reduction in\nthis connectivity is positively associated with symptom changes in patients with BPD. Moreover, it should be noted that we found the decrease of pDMN-insula connectivity only in inhibition condition and not in resting state. Thus, the effect might be more situation specific or task related than general, while previous studies usually report increased pDMN-insula connectivity in resting state or during pain processing.\nOverall, previous studies suggest that increased connectivity of pDMN with the amygdala and insula is associated with increased self-referential and self-attributional thinking, especially in negatively perceived situations. These connectivity increases are then associated with symptoms commonly associated with BPD, such as depressive mood, risk-taking, and suicidality with pDMN-amygdala connectivity, and dissociation and disturbed pain processing with pDMN-insula connectivity. Increased connectivity in both cases have been linked to adverse experiences in childhood. Our study reported decreased pDMN-amygdala and pDMN-insula connectivity and decreased BPD symptoms. We observed decreased pDMNamygdala connectivity both in the resting state and during an inhibition task. This result suggests that negative self-referential thinking was decreased during resting and during a task activity focused on impulse control. We found that symptom reduction was positively correlated with decreased amygdala-pDMN connectivity, but negatively correlated with insula-pDMN connectivity. Thus, the reduction of negative self-referential thinking associated with reduced pDMN connectivity with the amygdala seems to be a beneficial effect for patients with BPD and a candidate mechanism of the rTMS effect in patients with BPD.\nIn contrast to our initial hypothesis, we did not find any changes in the connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal area stimulated by rTMS. Thus, the mechanism of how prefrontal stimulation led to the connectivity and symptom changes observed in this study remains unclear. However, changes in DMN connectivity after high-frequency prefrontal stimulation were found in previous studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with depression and PTSD (65\u201367). Another study examining the neural effects of high-frequency DLPFC stimulation in 60 healthy people found no changes in DMN connectivity, but multiple increases in the connectivity of the cingulate and frontoparietal areas (68); this was not observed in our study. Several possible interpretations might be drawn concerning how prefrontal stimulation can induce distant connectivity changes without influencing the stimulation area connectivity per se. First, it is possible that the effects are induced by factors other than the intervention, including a placebo effect. Double-blind sham-controlled studies are needed to shed more light on this possibility. Second, prefrontal rTMS might actually induce distant beneficial brain changes, which would correspond with the hypothesis that the precise stimulation site might not be a crucial parameter at all. Third, it is possible that the current study did not have sufficient power to show prefrontal connectivity changes, and replication on a higher sample is needed. Moreover, medication in patients with BPD might influence the results since limbic hyperactivity has been found to bemoderated bymedication status in BPD patients (11).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 770353\nOverall, no existing data currently support the hypothesis that prefrontal rTMS leads to symptom reduction by increasing the prefrontal-limbic connectivity, but symptom reduction might be achieved by prefrontal rTMS through distant brain connectivity changes, such as the decrease of pDMN-amygdala connectivity observed in this study."

            "text": "The major limitation of our study is the small sample size and absence of a control group. The placebo effect is usually relatively high in rTMS studies (69), and there is a risk that this study was influenced as discussed above. On the other hand, this is the first study to report the neural effects of rTMS in BPD patients. Our results should be taken as exploratory and hypothesesgenerating; they should be verified in a placebo-controlled study.\nAnother possible limit is the choice of behavioral paradigm for individual neuronavigation. We chose this task to identify a DLPFC target most strongly related to impulse control within the aim to reduce impulsivity. However, patients with BPD typically show impulsive behavior under the influence of emotions (32, 70, 71). A different task activating inhibition under emotions or emotion regulation could be more appropriate for targeting rTMS in patients with BPD. On the other hand, given the existing studies of rTMS in BPD, the rTMS target does not seem to play any crucial role in achieving symptom improvement. We only observed changes in connectivity from the right DLPFC, but we did not analyze changes in connectivity within the whole prefrontal cortex. This could be also the reason we observed only distant changes in brain connectivity."

            "text": "This study reports on behavioral and neural effects of highfrequency prefrontal rTMS in patients with BPD. After the stimulation protocol, we observed reduced emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. On the neural level, we identified decreased connectivity of\nthe posterior default mode network areas with the amygdala and insula; this might reflect decreased negative self-referential\nthinking. Reduced amygdala-pDMN connectivity is a candidate mechanism of an rTMS effect in patients with BPD. Shamcontrolled studies examining the effect of brain target and stimulation parameters for rTMS are needed."
