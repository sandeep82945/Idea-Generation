    "abstractText": "The growing market of herbal medicines, the increase in international trade in Latvia, and the lack of adequate analytical methods have raised the question of the potential use of herbal fingerprinting methods. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods were developed for obtaining chromatographic fingerprints of four taxonomically and evolutionary different medicinal plants (Hibiscus sabdariffa L., Calendula officinalis L., Matricaria recutita L., Achillea millefolium L.). Retention time shifting, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) analysis were used to improve and analyze the obtained fingerprints. HPLC data detection at 270 nm was determined superior to 360 nm for the distinction of medicinal plants and used data alignment method significantly increased similarity between samples. Analyzed medicinal plant extracts formed separate, compact clusters in PCA, and the results of HCA correlated with the evolutionary relationships of the analyzed medicinal plants. Herbal fingerprinting using chromatographic analysis coupled with multivariate analysis has a great potential for the identification of medicinal plants as well as for the distinction of Latvian native medicinal plants.",

            "text": "Although in the last hundred years the backbone of Western medicine has been a great diversity of chemically synthesized drugs, billions of people still use herbal medicine for its well-known wellness-inducing properties and as a prophylactic and therapeutic tool for both minor and chronic health problems [1\u20133]. With an increase in vegetarian and vegan diets, the promotion of healthier lifestyles, and high prices of medication, herbal medicines have become a top choice for many consumers and have shown steady market growth in the 21st century, with the market size of global botanical supplements being valued at USD 27.47 billion in 2020 and the revenue forecast for 2028 being USD 55.18 billion [2,4,5]. The chemical composition of medicinal plants is very complex, with hundreds or even thousands of chemical components, which can be affected by such factors as growth and storage conditions, genetic composition, soil components, time of harvest, processing methods, and others [6]. All of these factors contribute to the batch-to-batch chemical variability of herbal medicines, supplements, and other products like herbal teas, and play a significant role in the physiological or pharmaceutical activities of these products [1]. Latvians have deep-rooted traditions and knowledge about medicinal plant use that are to this day still put in practice [7]. Many medicinal plants are also cultivated and processed in Latvia for the pharmaceutical and food industry, however with growing demand, the import of medicinal plants from foreign countries has grown from 2.98 million\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2555. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27082555 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2555 2 of 18\neuros in 2015 to 11.99 million euros in 2020 [8]. The increasing international trade of raw herbal materials around the world has raised concern about the possible contamination and adulteration of the materials [9\u201311]. Several studies have reported species adulterations ranging from 21% to even 80% of raw herbal samples, greatly impacting the biological activity and chemical composition of the materials [9,11\u201313]. Therefore, the establishment of authentic botanical species standards and analytical methods that can be used for identity tests is crucial [9]. Pharmacopeias and regulatory instances, like European Pharmacopoeia, mostly suggest that the identification and quantitative assay of herbal medicines should be performed using sensory inspections and a quantitative determination of a few key components of each herb [14,15]. However, sensory inspections can differ between specialists and are not adequately validated, and the conclusions can be subjective [16,17]. Additionally, the synergic effect of multiple components is why the single key component quantitative determination is not sufficient for the quality assessment of herbal medicines [18,19]. The chemical fingerprinting method, approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and others, can provide a comprehensive chemical description of herbal medicines [4,20,21]. The characteristic profiles and patterns reflecting the complex chemical composition of herbal samples, called fingerprints, can be established using multiple techniques, both chromatographic and spectroscopic [1,22]. There has been previous research on spectroscopic fingerprints of Latvian native medicinal plants, but no studies on Latvian native medicinal plant chromatographic fingerprints have been conducted to this day. Therefore, this study focuses on high-performance liquid chromatography, equipped with a UV detector (HPLC-UV) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods [23,24]. Liquid chromatography has been the most popular herbal fingerprinting method because of the advantages such as wide suitability, high resolution, selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and a fully automatable operation [15,25,26]. TLC has also been consistently used in the analysis of herbal medicines, as it is one of the analytical methods provided by European Pharmacopeia, but with the advances in TLC equipment and automatization, this method has also found a place in the scope of chromatographical fingerprinting, because of its simplicity, versatility, specific sensitivity, high throughput, and simple sample preparation [27,28]. Since chromatography methods provide very large the data amounts, multivariate statistical analysis methods can be used to reduce the large amount of data and extract information and characters of interest [29]. Methods of multivariate statistical analysis can be grouped according to their purposes, such as unsupervised or supervised. Unsupervised methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) are the most widely used for the analysis of herbal medicines, since these methods do not require a dependent variable for modeling [1,30,31]. PCA describes the correlation between a large number of variables using fewer principal components (PCs) while HCA establishes clusters of data, thereby visualizing the main patterns. PCA and HCA can be used for taxonomic discrimination, quality assessment, and geographic origin determination of medicinal plants [31\u201333]. Orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) analysis is a supervised statistical method suitable for showing differences between two predefined groups or systems [1,34,35]. This method explains which variables have the most significant discriminatory power and how the variables are correlated. This study used OPLS to obtain the optimal separation of herbal extract mixtures. To compare two fingerprints or to evaluate the (dis)similarity of the fingerprints, most often the productmoment or the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient r (\u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 1) is used [36]. In this study Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient values were calculated and PCA, HCA, and OPLS analysis was performed to analyze the obtained fingerprints. The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of herbal fingerprinting by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) in conjunction with chemometrics for characterization and identification of medicinal\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2555 3 of 18\nplant extracts, as well as to determine if the herbal fingerprinting method can be used for the distinction of Latvian native medicinal plants. Four taxonomically different medicinal plants (Hibiscus sabdariffa L., Calendula officinalis L., Matricaria recutita L., and Achillea millefolium L.) were chosen for this study based on their phylogenetic relationships and whether or not the medicinal plant is native to Latvia. Since previous studies have mainly focused on obtaining chromatographic fingerprints of only one genus or species and used vastly different TLC and HPLC method parameters, this study analyzed taxonomically and chemically different medicinal plants and aimed to develop analytical methods with wide suitability that can be used for fingerprinting analysis of several medicinal plants, therefore making the process of identifying medicinal plants cheaper, faster, and more efficient [37,38]. To practically evaluate the application of the herbal fingerprinting method, mixed extracts made from combinations of analyzed medicinal plants were made and the possibility of identifying the components of the mixed extracts was investigated."

Results and Discu sion 2.1. Advantages and Challenges of Thin Layer Chromatography\nThe efficac f t i layer chromatography can be greatly influenced by the used mobile phase. We tested a mobile phase consisting of ethyl acetate, water, and formic acid, as it was provided as a method for thin layer chromatography for calendula flowers by European Pharmacopoeia [39]. This mobile phase was efficient in the separation of chemical components of all examined herbal extracts (Figure 1).

We found that a 20-min-long chamber saturation is an insufficient time, and the migration of samples isn\u2019t straight, thereby compromising the results. When the chamber saturation was prolonged to 30 min, the migration trajectory greatly improved. The best separation of chemical components was observed when the height of development was 80 mm. As the separated compounds responded to UV light well, derivatization reagents were not applied to the plates.\nFigure 1. Developed HPTLC plates under 366 nm UV light.

Chlorogenic acid and rutin were chosen as reference standards, and their Rf values were measured. Chlorogenic acid was seen as a blue band under 366 nm UV light with a Rf value of 0.33. A similar blue band with the same Rf value was seen on plates with extracts of all analyzed medicinal plants, suggesting chlorogenic acid\u2019s presence in all analyzed extracts. Chlorogenic acid was also seen as a clear peak in chromatograms, which were provided by the used software. In previous TLC studies, chlorogenic acid has also been seen\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2555 4 of 18\nas a blue band under 366 nm UV light and detected in calendula, yarrow, and chamomile extracts, thereby the findings of this study coincide with previous research [41,42]. Rutin was seen as a brown band under 366 nm UV light with an Rf value of 0.26. A similar color band with the same Rf value was observed in samples of calendula extracts, indicating its presence in the above-mentioned extracts. This coincides with research by Agatanovic-Kustrin et al., in which rutin had also been detected in calendula extracts [42]. In our research, rutin, compared to chlorogenic acid, was not seen as a peak in chromatograms provided by the software, indicating a problem with color capture and interpretation of the used software. In addition, bands, which were seen red under 366 nm UV light, were not properly displayed as separate, adequate peaks in chromatograms. This problem significantly impacted data processing and result interpretation. Different TLC image processing methods like splitting a photograph through red, green, and blue channel filters, and denoising, are now being developed to enhance the selectivity and precision of results, but these methods were not tested in this research [43,44]. Since the above-mentioned problem of color capture and interpretation was encountered, the results of TLC were used only as an initial screening tool to characterize the chemical composition of the analyzed herbal extracts. The presence of chlorogenic acid, rutin, and other reference standards in analyzed herbal extracts was later checked using HPLC-UV. In future research, the TLC system could be combined with mass-spectrometry for the identification of separated chemical compounds."

The HPLC method provided the average Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient value r for raw data to be higher than 0.6805 for all medicinal plants at both wavelengths, while after the retention time adjustment, the average value for chamomile samples was no less than 0.7995, and for other analyzed medicinal plants it was no less than 0.9305. The improvement of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient values differed between medicinal plants. If the similarity was high even for raw data, for example\u2014roselle samples at 270 nm, then the increase of r values was not so significant. But if the similarity for raw data was lower, for example\u2014yarrow samples, the increase in r values after retention time alignment were as high as 36.74% at 270 nm. The lowest of average r values after retention time adjustment were for chamomile samples.

Further research with larger sample sizes should be conducted to investigate this observation.

OPLS has also been applied in previous studies to differentiate medicinal plants and their products [63\u201365]. The scatter plots and dendrograms of OPLS can be seen in Figure 8. Simple extracts made from one medicinal plant were also added to this analysis to see how the mixed extracts group in comparison to single medicinal plant extracts. Sets of simple and mixed extracts (56) were included in the OPLS analysis. OPLS analysis of data detected at 270 nm resulted in a tricomponent with R2(X) of 80.5%, R2(Y) of 91.4%, and Q2 of 88.5% of the variables. OPLS analysis of data detected at 360 nm resulted in tricomponent with R2(X) of 89.4%, R2(Y) of 83.2%, and Q2 of 80.7% of the variables. These results proved that the quality of the model was very good. From the scatter plots in Figure 8a,c we can see that the composition of mixed extracts influenced the location of clusters, correlated with the location of simple extracts, and indicated the components in the mixed extracts. For example, at 270 nm the clusters of mixed extract CD (chamomile and roselle) were located in between clusters of simple extracts\u2014C (chamomile) and D (roselle). This tendency can be also seen in mixed extracts made from 3 different medicinal plants. For example, at 270 nm the clusters of mixed extract BCD (calendula, chamomile, and roselle) were located in between clusters of simple extracts\u2014B (calendula), C (chamomile), and D (roselle). This observation can also be seen at 360 nm although the clusters are tighter and the separation of clusters is better at 270 nm. Dendrograms of OPLS (Figure 8b,d) show that samples tend to group according to their composition. At both wavelengths, roselle extract (D) is on a separate branch of the diagram with the highest Euclidean distance showing the dissimilarity from all other samples and the biggest difference in chemical composition. At 270 nm the dominant component is chamomile (C) because all mixed extracts containing chamomile tend to group closer to the simple chamomile extract than\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2555 11 of 18\nto other components of the mixed extract. For the same reason, at 360 nm the dominant component is calendula (B). OLPS analysis proves that the fingerprinting method can be used not only to identify extracts made from one medicinal plant but also to identify and characterize the composition of extracts made from several medicinal plants.\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 19\ndata detected at 360 nm resulted in tricomponent with R2(X) of 89.4%, R2(Y) of 83.2%, and Q2 of 80.7% of the variables.

To make a simple extract from only one medicinal plant 5.0 g of powdered medicinal plant sample was weighed and transferred to a 50 mL conical flask with a glass stopper, and 50 mL of 96% v/v ethanol was added. This procedure was executed in triplicate. Three extractions from each medicinal plant sample were made to reduce the impact of sample preparation and short time stability, as well as to additionally control measurement quality. The material was extracted by maceration for 24 h at room temperature. The extracts were filtered through Sartorius smooth filter paper, grade 3-HW (G\u00f6ttingen, Germany), and the supernatant was collected in an airtight container and stored at 4 \u25e6C until chromatographic analysis. To test the application of our methods, mixed extracts from different combinations of analyzed medicinal plants were made. All combinations and their codes can be found in Table 4. Two different mixed extract preparation methods were executed\u2014mixing together extracts already made from one medicinal plant (first method) and executing extraction from a mix of dry medicinal plant samples (second method). All combinations found in Table 4 were made using both methods. In the first method, two simple extracts (ratio 50:50 v/v) or three simple extracts (ratio 33:33:33 v/v) were taken and transferred into airtight containers and carefully mixed. This procedure was executed in duplicate for all mixed extracts to reduce the impact of sample preparation. These extracts also were stored at 4 \u25e6C until chromatographic analysis. In the second method, each needed medicinal plant sample was weighed and transferred to a 50 mL conical flask with a glass stopper, all dry samples were mixed together and ethanol 96% v/v was added with a ratio 1.0 g of mixed plant material: 10 mL ethanol.

As a stationary phase, an Ascentis Express 90 \u00c5 AQ-C18 column (15 cm \u00d7 3.0 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m, Supelco, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% aqueous trichloroacetic acid (v/v) (A) and acetonitrile (B) with the following gradient elution: 0 min\u201495% A, 45 min\u201455% A, 50 min\u2014 95% A. Before each sample analysis, a 4 min equilibration with 5% B was performed. The flow rate was set at 0.425 mL/min, the column temperature was 40 \u25e6C, injection volume was 1 \u00b5L, and the time of analysis was 50 min. The detection wavelength was set at 360 nm and 270 nm. Before HPLC analysis, extracts were put at room temperature for 2 h to reach room temperature and reduce the possibility of sample temperature influence on results. Before analysis, extracts were filtered through syringe filters with 0.45 \u00b5m pore size. Peaks with early retention time (<4 min) were omitted from the chemical profiles and further analysis due to the chance of errors and false signals not related to the composition of the sample. The average chromatogram for each medicinal plant was generated by combining all obtained chromatograms according to detection wavelengths. Since the quantitative concentrations of compounds were not investigated, all chromatograms were normalized beforehand. HPLC was performed on both the simple extracts made from one medicinal plant and mixed extracts."

SpecAlign software was used to adjust HPLC retention times to the plant\u2019s average chromatogram. The used method was first proposed by J.W.H. Wong et al. and released in SpecAlign 2.4.1 (University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom) [58]. PCA, HCA, and OPLS were performed using SIMCA 14 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The formation of clusters was visualized in scatter plots, dendrograms, and loadings. HCA was calculated using Ward\u2019s algorithm. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated on Origin 10 software (Originlab, North Hampton, MA, USA).

            "text": "The herbal fingerprinting method has a great potential for the identification and characterization of herbal extracts. Research shows clear differences in chemical fingerprints of Latvian native medicinal plants (chamomile, calendula, and yarrow) and roselle. TLC can be used as an initial screening tool of herbal extracts, while HPLC gives much more detailed information regarding the chemical composition of herbal extracts. HPLC fingerprint similarity can be greatly improved by adjusting retention times to the average chromatogram of each medicinal plant. In HPLC data, detection at 270 nm is superior to 360 nm and provides more detailed results of the chemical composition of herbal extracts and can be used to identify and differentiate medicinal plants. The correlation between the phylogenetic relationships and groupings of fingerprint datasets of analyzed medicinal plants was confirmed. The developed HPLC method in conjunction with chemometrics can also be used to identify components of mixed extracts containing different combinations of analyzed medicinal plants. Future research using other methods such as mass-spectrometry and larger sample sizes should be conducted to gain a deeper knowledge of the chemical composition of herbal extracts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27082555/s1.
