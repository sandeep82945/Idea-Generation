Methods: Eighty-eight patients with brain tumours who had undergone RT were selected in this study, and MR images (T1, T1+C, T2FLAIR, T2, DWI, and ASL) before and after RT were obtained. The brain white matter was delineated as an ROI under dose gradients of 0\u20135 Gy, 5\u201310 Gy, 10\u201315 Gy, 15\u201320 Gy, 20\u201330 Gy, 30\u201340 Gy, and 40\u201350 Gy. The radiomics features of each ROI were extracted, and the changes in radiomics features before and after RT for different sequences under different dose gradients were compared. Results: At each dose gradient, statistically significant features of different MR sequences were mainly concentrated in three dose gradients, 5\u201310 Gy, 20\u201330 Gy, and 30\u201340 Gy. The T1+C sequence held the most features (66) under the 20\u201330 Gy dose gradient. There were 20 general features at dose gradients of 20\u201330 Gy, 30\u201340 Gy, and 40\u201350 Gy, and the changes in features first decreased and then increased following dose escalation. With dose gradients of 5\u201310 Gy and 10\u201315 Gy, only T1 and T2FLAIR had general features, and the rates of change were \u2212 24.57% and \u2212 29.32% for T1 and \u2212 3.08% and \u2212 10.87% for T2FLAIR, respectively. The changes showed an upward trend with increasing doses. For different MR sequences that were analysed under the same dose gradient, all sequences with 5\u201310 Gy, 20\u201330 Gy and 30\u201340 Gy had general features, except the T2FLAIR sequence, which was concentrated in the FirstOrder category feature, and the changes in features of T1 and T1+C were more significant than those of the other sequences. Conclusions: MR radiomics features revealed microscopic changes in brain white matter before and after RT, although there was no constant dose-effect relationship for each feature. The changes in radiomics features in different sequences could reveal the radiation response of brain white matter to different doses.",

            "text": "Radiotherapy (RT) has become one of the main treatments for brain tumours. Patients receiving RT can achieve long-term survival, although most of these patients may have a certain degree of radiationinduced brain injury (RBI) [1]. With the development of imaging and RT technology, the accuracy and conformability of RT have been significantly improved. However, RBI continues to be an obstacle that affects\n*Correspondence: yinyongsd@126.com; wpc163@163.com\n1 College of Radiology, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, 250117 Jinan, China 2 Department of Radiation Physics, Shandong First Medical University Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute (Shandong Cancer Hospital), 250117 Jinan, China\ntreatment and the quality of life of patients. Therefore, the early accurate prediction and diagnosis of RBI are vital [2]. RBI can be categorized as acute (several days to several weeks after RT), early-delayed (1\u20136 months after RT), and late-delayed effects (more than 6 months after RT, usually irreversible). Diffuse white matter injury is one of the characteristics of late RBI [3].\nThe development of RBI is directly related to the irradiated volume and radiation dose. Radiation dose is one of the main factors causing RBI. Animal models of RBI have also demonstrated that radiation injury is directly related to the irradiated volume [4]. Most studies have focused on the influence of RT on the hippocampal network and memory decline. With the development of radiobiology, people have realized that brain injury is not limited to the hippocampus and memory but also includes white matter injuries [5].\nBrain white matter is more sensitive to radiation because of its abundant blood supply, which in turn leads to cognitive and memory disorders and seriously affects the quality of life of patients [6]. From a radiobiology perspective, brain white matter injury will have a series of biological effects with changes in the radiation dose. Presently, the diagnosis of white matter injury mainly depends on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, conventional anatomic MR images cannot objectively show the early injury effect, and traditional methods of predicting injury based on the dose-volume index are unable to dynamically track the dose of brain tissue during RT, which leads to an inability or delay in the early prediction of injury. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used in studies based on white matter injury. However, the spatial resolution of DTI limits the analysis of main white matter bundles, which makes it difficult to reveal subtle changes in regional white matter structure [7, 8]. The rapidly developing radiomics achieved by mining a large amount of in-depth information in the images could be used to quantitatively analyse the dynamic changes in tumour or normal tissue during treatment, which may help reveal and track the microscopic changes of early white matter injury [9].\nAs the MR radiomics features of different sequences could reflect different information, in this study, multisequence MRI radiomics was used to investigate the changes in the white matter before and after RT under different dose gradients and to analyse the correlation between the changes in radiomics features and dose gradients to provide an objective basis for the early prediction, diagnosis, and dynamic tracking of RBI."

            "text": "With the increasing application of RT in the comprehensive treatment of brain tumours, the incidence of RBI, mainly manifested as fatigue, somnolence, headache and nausea caused by cerebral oedema, delayed recall, cognitive impairment, and other adverse symptoms, is increasing and seriously affects the quality of life of patients [10]. The late stage of RBI involves radionecrosis, which includes symptoms such as pseudoprogression; thus, differentiating between radiation necrosis and progressive tumours remains a major clinical challenge. Because the pathological results were difficult to obtain, the detection of radionecrosis still mainly relies on imaging. Radionecrosis shows annular enhancement on imaging, which is quite similar to a tumour. Therefore, it is not clear whether T1-enhanced lesions are related to real radionecrosis [11], [12].\nThere are several factors in the pathogenesis of RTinduced RBI, including vascular injury, white matter injury, demyelination, and axonal injury, among others. A study by Nagesh et\u00a0 al. [13] demonstrated that white matter injury was mainly caused by progressive dosedependent demyelination, which mainly occurs within the first few months after RT in high-dose areas but takes longer to detect in low-dose areas. Since white matter injury is closely related to microvascular injury, ischaemia and microvascular hypoxia eventually lead to radionecrosis [14]. Therefore, early identification of acute microscopic changes in white matter caused by RT is vital for the accurate prediction and diagnosis of late RBI [15].\nMRI provides qualitative and quantitative information for the evaluation of RBI. Due to microvascular\ninjury, destruction of the blood\u2013brain barrier, demyelination, and neuroinflammation in early radiation injuries in brain tumours [16], conventional MR can only obtain anatomical information and cannot accurately quantify and evaluate the response of white matter to radiation. Radiomics technology can reveal the outcome of diseases and normal tissues in diagnosis and treatment by mining the deep information in images [17]. Therefore, MR radiomics has important application potential in revealing microscopic changes in white matter and dynamically tracking the RT response, while different MR sequences could reflect different information about tissues. Although multisequence MR radiomics has a broader application potential, there is presently a lack of literature on such research.\nIn this study, it was observed that the features were mainly concentrated in the dose gradients 5\u201310\u00a0 Gy, 20\u201330\u00a0Gy, and 30\u201340\u00a0Gy of multisequence MR images. A study by Connor et\u00a0al. [18] confirmed that white matter injury could occur even after low-dose (5\u201310\u00a0 Gy) RT. This was consistent with the results of this study, which showed that the number of significantly different features at the dose gradient of 5\u201310\u00a0Gy under the DWI sequence was the largest, and the rate of change of the features was the most significant when compared before and after RT. It was confirmed that the features of MR radiomics could reveal microscopic changes in white matter. Furthermore, although there was no general feature in the low-dose region (0\u20135\u00a0Gy), there was also a significant RT response in the ultrastructure of the white matter receiving low-dose radiation.\nIn this study, it was observed that there was no general feature under all dose gradients, the features T1 and T2FLAIR had a general feature under the lowdose gradients 5\u201310\u00a0Gy and 10\u201315\u00a0Gy, and the changes showed an upwards trend with an increase in the dose. There were 20 general features in T1+C under highdose gradients of 20\u201330\u00a0Gy, 30\u201340\u00a0Gy, and 40\u201350\u00a0Gy.

This may be because the radiation-induced changes in the blood\u2013 brain barrier and vascular permeability increase the permeability of the contrast medium, thus improving the visibility of microscopic changes in white matter on T1+C7. Therefore, it was more advantageous to apply multisequence MR radiomics to predict or track the dynamic changes in white matter.\nThis study also analysed the radiomics features of DWI and ASL. A study by Melanie et\u00a0 al. [19] confirmed the relationship between microhemorrhage and white matter injury after RT. In the local region around the microhemorrhage focus, the fractional anisotropic changes in white matter decreased by 21.4% every year, which exceeded the fractional anisotropic change in naturally ageing white matter. ASL revealed changes in blood flow in the white matter, and the rate of change in the features before and after RT was the most significant (33.25%) at 30\u201340\u00a0Gy. This result was consistent with that of a previous study by our group, which analysed the relationship between perfusion changes before and after RT and RT doses [20]. According to the changes in radiomics features of ASL, it was suggested that the radiation dose for the normal brain region should be maintained below 30\u00a0 Gy. Through the analysis of different MR sequences with the same dose gradient, this study demonstrated that the general features that changed significantly under the dose gradient of 30\u201340\u00a0Gy were T1 and T1+C, and the general features of different sequences were firstorder category features, which indicated that such features tended to be stable under various sequences. Therefore, this feature should be preferred for analysis. Because of the influence of high signals of oedema in MR images, the T2 sequence was meaningless under dose gradients of 0\u20135\u00a0 Gy and 40\u201350\u00a0 Gy. Our present study did not find a more significant change pattern under the low-dose gradient of 0\u20135\u00a0 Gy and high-dose gradient of 40\u201350\u00a0Gy.\nIn this study, it was observed that more in-depth anatomical and metabolic information could be obtained by the use of multisequence MR radiomics, which is a feasible method for the clinical monitoring of the changes in white matter caused by radiation. The main advantages are that all patients underwent standardized scanning, and previously used thin-layer (3\u00a0 mm layer thickness, 0\u00a0 mm layer interval) scanning images were adopted to track the changes in radiomics features of white matter. Compared to the traditional scanning method (slice thickness of 5\u00a0 mm and interval of 2\u00a0 mm), this method had higher accuracy and better response to the changes in white matter with RT. In this study, the time, space, and dosimetry model of radiation-induced injury could not be established. We intend to monitor the occurrence\nof radiation injury among patients in the future through follow-up. The correlation between the changes in radiomics features, radiation dose, and radiation white matter injury was analysed, and a predictive model of radiation-induced brain injury based on dose and radiomics features was established. This model can guide individualized RT and evaluate the risk of radiationinduced injury in patients [21].\nIn conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that MR radiomics features can reveal the response of white matter to different doses of radiation. MR T1-enhanced images should be the first choice for radiomics feature extraction, which provides a feasible method for dynamic tracking of white matter radiotherapy response and early prediction of radiation damage.\nAbbreviations RT: Radiotherapy; RBI: Radiation-induced brain injury; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; DTI: Diffusion tensor imaging; T2FLAIR: T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence; DWI: Diffusion-weighted imaging; 3D-ASL: Three-dimensional arterial spin labelling; CBF: Cerebral blood flow; OARs: Organs at risk; IMRT: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; ROI: Regions of interest.\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthor contributions Mingming Chen participated in the data collection, data analysis, and sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
