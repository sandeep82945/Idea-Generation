    "abstractText": "Fine dust, recently classified as a carcinogen, has raised concerns about the health effects of air pollution. Vehicle emissions, particularly nitrogen oxide (NOx), contribute to ultrafine dust formation as a fine dust precursor. A photocatalyst, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), is a material that causes a catalytic reaction when exposed to light, has exceptional characteristics such as decomposition of pollutants, and can be used permanently. This study aimed to investigate NOx reduction performance by developing ecofriendly permeable concrete with photocatalytic treatment to reduce fine dust generated from road mobile pollution sources. Permeable concrete specimens containing an activated loess and zeolite admixture were prepared and subjected to mechanical and durability tests. All specimens, including the control (CTRL) and admixture, met quality standard SPS-F-KSPIC-001-2006 for road pavement. Slip resistance and permeability coefficient also satisfied the standards, while freeze\u2013thaw evaluation criteria were met only by CTRL and A1Z1 specimens. NOx reduction performance of the permeable concrete treated with TiO2 photocatalyst was assessed using ISO standard and tank chambers. NOx reduction efficiency of up to 77.5% was confirmed in the permeable concrete specimen with TiO2 content of 7.5%. Nitrate concentration measurements indirectly confirmed photolysis of nitrogen oxide. Incorporating TiO2 in construction materials such as roads and sidewalks can improve the atmospheric environment for pedestrians near roads by reducing NOx levels through photocatalysis.",

            "text": "Air pollution due to rapid economic growth is one of the problems facing the world, mainly in the form of fine dust in the process of burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil in factories and automobiles, etc. [1]. Particulate matter (PM) refers to atmospheric substances that exist in the form of particles. It is generally classified as fine dust (PM10) when the diameter of the largest particle is below 10 \u00b5m or as ultrafine dust (PM2.5) when the diameter of the largest particle is below 2.5 \u00b5m. In particular, PM can easily infiltrate bronchial tubes and lungs; therefore, it causes various respiratory diseases as well as cardiovascular, skin, and eye diseases. Samet et al. (2000) reported that the total mortality rate increases by 0.51% if the concentration of atmospheric PM10 increases [2]. Other studies have reported that the total mortality rate could increase up to 4\u201318% upon long-term exposure to PM [3,4]. Therefore, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an organization affiliated with the World Health Organization (WHO), has classified PM as a Group 1 carcinogen [5], and measures for reducing atmospheric PM are urgently needed. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) accounts for approximately 60% of PM originating from the roadside. NOx is a pollution source that secondarily generates PM2.5 by reacting with vapor\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5512. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16165512 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5512 2 of 16\n(H2O), ozone (O3), and organic compounds under certain conditions in the atmosphere. NOx is mainly generated by the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or petroleum. In particular, it is estimated that a significant amount of NOx is emitted from road mobility pollution sources in large cities with significant vehicle transit, and it has been reported that approximately 45% of NOx from Seoul has been emitted through road mobility pollution sources [6]. Therefore, for reducing NOx in urban areas, controlling NOx emitted through road mobility sources or using road facilities is effective. Among various road facilities, those composed of concrete, such as boundary stones, bagged and sacked concrete, and crash walls, have large surface areas; therefore, the use of infrastructure composed of functional concrete is an efficient method of reducing roadside NOx [7]. TiO2 photocatalysts, which are most commonly used as functional materials for reducing NOx as a precursor to PM, can be used semi-permanently because it does not change under light, and it is mainly included in concrete, asphalt mixture, paint for mortar, coating materials, and packing materials owing to its excellent capability to decompose pollutants [8\u201310]. TiO2 photocatalysts have a 3.0\u20133.2 eV band gap, and electrons (e\u2212) and electron holes (h+) are formed when TiO2 is irradiated using light with a wavelength of 380 nm (ultraviolet rays) or below. The generated e\u2212 and h+ are strong reducing agents and oxidizing agents, respectively; thus, hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide anion (O2\u2212) can be created through reaction with water and oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere, demonstrating excellent efficiency for decomposing atmospheric pollutants [11].

NOx is a pollution source that secondarily generates PM2.5 by reacting with\nvapor (H2O), ozone (O3), and organic compounds under certain conditions in the\natmosphere. NOx is mainly generated by the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal or\npetroleum. In particular, it is estimated that a significant amount of NOx is emitted from\nroad mobility pollution sources in large cities with significant vehicle transit, and it has\nbeen reported that approximately 45% of NOx from Seoul has been emitted through road\nmobility pollution sources [6]. Therefore, for reducing NOx in urban areas, controlling\nNOx emitted through road mobility sources or using road facilities is effective. Among\nvarious road facilities, those composed of concrete, such as boundary stones, bagged and\nsacked concrete, and crash walls, have large surface areas; therefore, the use of\ninfrastructure composed of functional concrete is an efficient method of reducing roadside\nNOx [7].\nTiO2 photocatalysts, which are most commonly used as functional materials for\nreducing NOx as a precursor to PM, can be used semi-permanently because it does not\nchange under light, and it is mainly included in concrete, asphalt mixture, paint for\nmortar, coating materials, and packing materials owing to its excellent capability to\ndecompose pollutants [8\u201310].

Guo et al. (2020) assessed the photocatalytic decomposition efficiency of concrete consisting of nanoTiO2 photocatalysts [13]. They utilized two methods for integrating nano-TiO2 into the concrete: (1) directly mixing nano-TiO2 particles with concrete and (2) spreading nano-TiO2 particles onto the concrete surface by spraying. They reported that the photocatalytic\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5512 3 of 16\nefficiency improved when concrete was not polished according to the increase in nanoTiO2 content increase as well as the increase in the concentration of pollutants. Gopala Krishna Sastry et al. (2021) experimentally studied the effect of nano-TiO2 on fly ashbased geopolymer concrete durability and strength [14]. In their research, the compressive strength, bending strength, and splitting tensile strength of geopolymer concrete in which fly ash was substituted with nano-TiO2 were assessed; the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete was soaked in magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride to assess durability. They reported that the strength and durability of the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete increased as the amount of substituted TiO2 increased. Kim et al. (2018) investigated the NOx removal efficiency of the highway-retaining wall of South Korea\u2019s Gyeongbu Expressway, where TiO2 was spread onto the concrete surface through a surface penetrant [15]. They reported that the NOx concentration was reduced by approximately 12% following the addition of TiO2. Additionally, they reported that the NOx removal efficiency increased as the amount of sunshine and traffic increased. Beeldens (2014) investigated the photocatalyst block pavement in Antwerp, Belgium [16], and Th. Maggos et al. (2007) performed an onsite experiment by applying TiO2 photocatalyst paint in a parking lot [17]. Furthermore, Gian Lsuca Guerrini (2012) used cement-based paint treated with TiO2 in the Umberto 1 tunnel in Rome to identify its NOx reduction capacity [18]. On the other hand, since the activity of the TiO2 photocatalyst is only active in UV light, which is about 5% of sunlight [19,20], various methods have been studied to improve the activity, such as bonding with other semiconductors, noble metal loading, doping, and heterojunction configuration [21\u201323]. Islam Ibrahim et al. (2022) reported that the component combination of TiO2/g-C3N4@Ag NPs showed visible light activation and improved photocatalytic performance under not only UV but also visible light irradiation [24]. Thus, this study investigated the NOx reduction performance of road pavement concrete coated with TiO2 photocatalysts to reduce fine dust generated from roadsides for pedestrians. Unlike asphalt or general concrete pavement, rainwater is drained to prevent aquaplaning, enabling smooth passage of vehicles and moving objects, and a permeable concrete containing ecofriendly materials was developed. In addition, a tank photoreactor was fabricated and the NOx reduction efficiency of the specimen that utilized real-size construction material was determined. For this purpose, the mixing ratio of permeable concrete for sidewalk pavement was derived, and the compressive strength, bending strength, freeze\u2013thawing resistance, skid resistance, and permeability performance were determined. Next, TiO2 photocatalyst was coated onto the fabricated permeable concrete mixed with the derived optimal mixing ratio to assess the NOx reduction efficiency according to the TiO2 content. NOx reduction assessment involved analysis using a newly developed tank chamber that can accommodate large-scale specimens and an ISO standard chamber that uses small specimens. Additionally, a water quality analyzer was used to identify the generated nitrate concentration after NOx reduction assessment."

NOx Reduction Performance Evaluation Test\nTo assess the NOx removal performance of the photocatalyst, the schematic of nitrogen oxide reduction evaluation system that complies with ISO 22197-1(2016) is shown in Figure 4 [28]. The NOx reduction evaluation system consists of a test gas supplier, a photoreactor (test chamber), and a test gas analyzer. The test gas supplier consists of a flow controller, a humidifier, a gas mix tank, etc. A mixture of dry air, moist air that has passed through the humidifier, and polluted gas supplies 1ppm polluted gas with 50% relative humidity. The test chamber for testing NOx reduction was fabricated in two sizes: an ISO standard photoreactor (sample size 100 mm \u00d7 50 mm \u00d7 5 mm) for small specimens and a tank photoreactor (tank size 240 mm \u00d7 140 mm \u00d7 200 mm) for large specimens such as concrete and asphalt construction materials. The upper part of the chamber was composed of tempered glass that ultraviolet (UV) could penetrate. As the size of the specimen for testing NOx reduction, a small specimen of 50 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 5 mm in size is used for the ISO standard photoreactor, but the ISO standard photoreactor specimen guideline was corrected to the size of the aggregate used in permeable concrete fabrication (10 mm or above), and permeable concrete 50 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 25 mm in size was fabricated for use. In the case of the tank photoreactor, a permeable concrete compressive strength test piece (100 mm diameter \u00d7 50 mm height) was used. Images of each chamber and specimens are shown in Figure 5 (ISO standard photoreactor) and Figure 6 (tank-type photoreactor). For specimen preprocessing, all specimens were soaked in distilled water for 2 h or above and dried at 40 \u25e6C before testing. The preprocessed specimens were coated with a photocatalyst using an automatic spray device. As experimental pollutant gas, NO gas and air were mixed, and 1 ppm NO gas with 50% relative humidity at 25 \u25e6C was used. The specimen coated with photocatalyst was located within the chamber and pollutant gas was injected at a flow rate of 3 L min\u22121 and stabilized for 1 h. Then, the pollutant gas concentration was documented for 5 h while irradiating with a UV lamp at a wavelength of 325 nm. Lastly, the UV lamp was turned off and the pollutant gas concentration was observed for 1 h. The NOx reduction efficiency of the photocatalyst could be determined using the NOx concentration (NOxequil) at equilibrium during the photocatalyst reaction and the initial NOx concentration (NOxinitial) (Equation (2)).\nNOx reduction Efficiency(%) =\n( NOxinitial \u2212NOxequil ) NOxequil \u00d7 100 (2)\nMaterials 2023, 16, 5512 8 of 16\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16\nduring the photocatalyst reaction and the initial NOx concentration (NOxinitial) (Equation\n(2)).\nNOx reduction Efficiency(%) = (NOxinitial \u2212 NOxequil)\nNOxequil \u00d7 100 (2)\nFigure 4.

In this recipe, the compressive strength of concrete in which some of the cement was replaced with pozzolanic materials (activated loess, natural zeolite) showed a decrease, and when the content of zeolite was higher than that of activated loess, the compressive strength of concrete was greatly reduced. It is judged that when cement is replaced with pozzolanic materials such as zeolite and activated loess, the absolute amount of cement clinker decreases and the pozzolanic reaction of pozzolanic materials such as activated loess and zeolite does not sufficiently proceed. In addition, it is judged that the content of constituent minerals that affect the development of strength, such as SiO2, is also reduced [30\u201333]. However, the average compressive strength of A1Z2, A1Z1, and A2Z1 after a curing period of 28 days satisfied the quality standard for permeable concrete for road pavement presented by SPS-F-KSPIC-001-2006.

The observed low NOx reduction efficiency can be attributed to the larger volume of the tank photoreactor compared to the specimen in the ISO standard photoreactors.

            "text": "The application of TiO2 photocatalyst to construction materials for enhancing air quality has garnered significant interest among researchers in both industry and academia. In line with the objective of creating functional construction materials to reduce NOx emissions from roadside sources, this study focused on developing permeable concrete containing porous materials like active loess and zeolite for sidewalk pavements. The NOx reduction performance was then evaluated with the application of TiO2. Based on our findings, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n1. A decrease in the physical performance of permeable concrete that includes active loess and zeolite was observed in comparison to the CTRL, but they all satisfied the quality standard of permeable concrete for sidewalk and road pavement. 2. The skid resistance and permeability coefficient showed results that satisfy standards for sidewalk concrete in all permeable concrete specimens, but the quality standard was satisfied at 80% or above of residual compressive strength in only CTRL and A1Z1 specimens in the freezing and thawing experiment. 3. Considering the physical and durability performances of this study, A1Z1 mixture was determined as the optimal mixing ratio for permeable concrete for applying TiO2 photocatalyst. 4. The NOx reduction efficiency tended to increase according to the increase in TiO2 content. With 7.5% TiO2 content, a maximum NOx reduction efficiency of 77.5% was observed. 5. The tank photoreactor of the specimen using the compressive strength test piece also showed similar results to the NOx reduction tendency in the ISO standard photoreactor. 6. By assessing the nitrate concentration generated after NOx reduction assessment, it was found that a photocatalyst reaction occurred during UV irradiation on the surface of the photocatalyst-coated permeable concrete. Additionally, higher nitrate concentration and higher NOx reduction efficiency were observed with 7.5% TiO2 content than with 10% TiO2 content.\nAuthor Contributions: Background research, H.-j.K. and K.H.; writing, H.-j.K. and K.H.; reviewing, H.-j.K. and K.H.
