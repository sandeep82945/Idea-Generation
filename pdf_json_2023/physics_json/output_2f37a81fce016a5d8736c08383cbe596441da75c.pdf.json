    "abstractText": "To discover anti-acetylcholinesterase agents for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), a series of novel Schiff base-coumarin hybrids was rationally designed, synthesized successfully, and structurally characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) analyses. These hybrids were evaluated for their potential inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE). All of them exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against AChE. The IC50 values ranged from 87.84 to 515.59 \u03bcg/mL; hybrids 13c and 13d with IC50 values of 0.232 \u00b1 0.011 and 0.190 \u00b1 0.004 \u03bcM, respectively, showed the most potent activity as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). The reference drug, Galantamine, yielded an IC50 of 1.142 \u00b1 0.027 \u03bcM. Reactivity descriptors, including chemical potential (\u03bc), chemical hardness (\u03b7), electrophilicity (\u03c9), condensed Fukui function, and dual descriptors are calculated at wB97XD/6-311++ G (d,p) to identify reactivity changes of the designed compounds. An in-depth investigation of the natural charge pattern of the studied compounds led to a deep understanding of the important interaction centers between these compounds and the biological receptors of AChE. The molecular electrostatic surface potential (MESP) of the most active site in these derivatives was determined using high-quality information and visualization. Molecular docking analysis was performed to predict binding sites and binding energies. The structure-activity-property relationship studies indicated that the proposed compounds exhibit good oral bioavailability properties. To explore the stability and dynamic behavior of the ligand-receptor complexes, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed for 100 ns on the two best docked derivatives, 13c and 13d, with the AChE (4EY7) receptor. A popular method for determining the free binding energies (MM/GBSA) is performed using snapshots taken from the systems\u2019 trajectories at 100 ns. These results revealed that the complex system of compound 13d acquired a relatively more stable conformation and exhibited better descriptors than the complex system of compound 13c and the Galantamine drug, suggesting its potential as an effective inhibiting drug. The binding free energy analysis revealed that the 13d-4EY7 complex exhibited greater stability with AChE receptors compared to other complexes.

By 2050, the number of AD patients will have tripled from the present level of more than 50 million worldwide [2]. The cholinergic hypothesis is one of the most significant hypotheses, despite the fact that the etiology of AD has not yet been fully explained. In the brains of AD patients, it was found that the level of the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) was abnormal. Studies have shown that acetylcholine levels rise when acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is inhibited, thereby enhancing memory and cognitive function in patients [3]. Therefore, a major treatment strategy for AD involves inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ACh neurotransmitters. Currently, drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, which belong to the class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), are approved and administered as therapeutic options for the management of AD [4]. However, while these medications can provide temporary improvements in memory and cognitive function, they are unable to prevent or reverse the progression of the disease. Given the limitations of current treatments and the urgent need to address both symptomatic relief and disease progression, researchers are continually seeking and developing potential agents that can effectively treat AD and potentially modify its course.Heterocyclic-based compounds have been reported as active inhibitors against the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE). Medicinal chemists have developed and used a variety of coumarin cores to design novel treatments with a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties [4]. Mohammadi-Khanaposhtani et al. have investigated the inhibition of AChE with a series of coumarin-3-carboxamide-N-morpholine derivatives. The obtained IC50 values ranged in micromolar levels (6.21\u201326.4 \u00b5M). Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be the most active among the series [5]. Kara et al. reported the synthesis and AChE inhibition activity of a series of coumarin-based compounds. Among the series, derivative 3, with an IC50 value of 0.04 \u00b5M, displayed higher activity [6]. On the other hand, Schiff bases represent an important group of organic compounds with various biological activities [7\u201311]. The study of novel biologically significant Schiff bases has been drawing the attention of chemists and pharmacists [12\u201315]. Wang et al. have designed and synthesized a series of Schiff bases containing coumarin cores. The synthesized compounds were assessed for their anti-Alzheimer activity. The obtained results showed that derivative 4 showed higher inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 0.673 and 0.711 \u00b5M for human monoamine oxidasehMAO-A and hMAO-B, respectively [16]. Compound 5 showed promising inhibitory activity against AChE with an IC50 value of 4.12 \u00b5M [17]. In 2019, 16 hybrids of acrine-isatin Schiff bases were designed and synthesized by Riazimontazer and co-workers. The designed compounds were tested as potential anti-Alzheimer agents. Compound 6, with an IC50 value of 0.42 nM, was the most potent (IC50 = 38.72 nM). Interestingly, chloro-substituent compounds displayed stronger inhibitory activity than those with nitro and methoxy substituents [18]. Figure 1 shows that some coumarin and Schiff base-containing compounds were reported as AChE inhibitors.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 3 of 32ar ace ticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 1\nN N\nN H\nO\nOHO O\n3\nBr O N O\nN H\nOO O O\nN H\nO\nN O\n1 2\nO\nOH N\nO\nHO OH OH\n4\nN NH\nO N\nCl\nN\nN\nO N\nOH 5\nO\nO\nO O\nN\nR1\nDesigned Compounds\nR2\n6\nFigure 1.

Additionally, another aryl ring was established through two \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with TRP286 amino acid residues. The CH3 group of coumarin interacted with residues of TYR74, TYR124, TRP86, and TRP286 through \u03c0-alkyl interactions. Careful inspection of the binding site pattern and binding energy between the AChE enzyme and the studied hybrids (13a-j) indicated that both hybrids (13c and 13d) could be good candidates for the treatment of AChE, which is correlated with experimental results.

            "text": "In this study, the physicochemical properties such as molar volume (V), hydration energy (HE), molar refractivity (MR), surface area grid (SAG), and polarizability (Pol) for hybrids (13a-j) were calculated (Table 3) and discussed using HyperChem (v8.0.7). The molecular polarizability (Pol) characteristics of a compound are determined based on how efficiently its electronic system controls itself in response to the presence of an external electric field of light. The importance of molecular polarizability is that it plays a crucial role in simulating a variety of compound characteristics and bioactivities [25]. Molecule volume, which controls things like blood-brain barrier permeability and intestinal absorption, is the main factor that influences molecular polarizability. Thus, molecular volume must be used in QSAR investigations to simulate molecular characteristics and bioactivities. A further SAR parameter is molar refractivity (MR), a steric characteristic that is dependent on the spatial arrangement of the phenyl ring in the compounds under evaluation. The spatial arrangement is significant because it is crucial to understanding how drug molecules\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 9 of 32\ninteract with biological receptors. The London dispersive force, which is greatly involved in the interaction between drug molecules and receptors, is another factor that influences molar refractivity in addition to its dependence on molecular volume.\nAccording to the findings in Table 3, the size (volume) and molecular weight of proposed hybrids are often proportional to polarizability data, molecular refractivity, and surface area grid, such as hybrid 13f, which has the highest volume value (1263.19 \u00c53), refractivity (123.14 \u00c53), maximum polarizability value (48.94 \u00c53), surface area grid (750.75 \u00c53), and the highest molecular weight (MW) (445.47 amu). On the other hand, compound 13a, which has lower values in all five descriptors (molecular volume, polarizability, refractivity, surface area grid, and MW) are (1111.03 \u00c53, 44.0 \u00c53, 110.22 \u00c53, 668.68 \u00c52, and 445.47 amu), respectively. From Table 3, other compound gradients decrease in order as 13h > 13d > 13i > 13b > 13e > 13g > 13c > 13j is the same pattern in all hybrids. The obtained results in Table 3 exhibit an increase in the values of hydrophobicity, causing a decline in hydration energy. The hydration energy determines the various molecular conformations\u2019 stability in aqueous solutions [26,27]. The change in the hydration energy value is affected by the increase or decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds (acceptors and donors). Table 3 illustrates the absolute values of hydration energy ordered as 13f < 13h < 13d < 13i < 13b < 13e < 13g < 13c < 13j < 13a with values of (\u221212.78, \u221212.58, \u221210.84, \u221210.62, \u221212.67, \u221211.21, \u221212.52, \u221210.72, \u221210.57, and \u221211.09 kcal/mol), respectively, and characterized by hydrogen bonds (acceptors and donors). Lipophilicity is a major determinant of many ADME properties. Log P expresses the portioning of the drug molecules between the aqueous medium outside the cell membrane and the lipid nature of the cell membrane. This means that compounds with a lower Log P are more polar and have poorer lipid bilayer permeability, whereas hybrids with a higher Log P are more nonpolar and poorly soluble in water [28]. For that reason, all compounds except compounds 13c and 13j have good aqueous solubility. Furthermore, Log P values of compounds 13f = 13h < 13d = 13i < 13b = 13e = 13g < 13a are in the field of optimal values (0 < Log P < 5) [29]. It can be concluded that these hybrids have optimal biological activity and good oral bioavailability. Hybrids 13c and 13j need a drug delivery carrier to deposit them on the surface of a suitable nanomaterial with specific properties to enhance oral bioavailability."

As the initial structure, the\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 10 of 32\nbest-docked pose of the most active compounds (13c and 13d) with the highest binding affinity was chosen. Moreover, MD was performed to explore the interaction modes and stability of these compounds [30,31]. For this reason, a long-range MD simulation of 100 ns was investigated to study structural stability and conformational stability as well as the dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. Herein, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) throughout the 100 ns simulations was used to determine the stability of the systems. An RMSD value lower than 3.0 \u00c5 was the most acceptable; it shows that the system is the most stable [20]. For all frames of the AChE protein, ligands (13c or 13d), and ligand-protein complex systems, as presented in Figure 4, the average RMSD values were 1.530, 1.691, and 2.364 \u00c5 in the 13d complex, whereas in the 13c complex, they were 1.631, 2.229 and 2.396 \u00c5, respectively. The standard deviation of the average RMSD values were 0.199, 0.296, and 0.218 \u00c5, in the 13d complex, whereas in the 13c complex, they were 0.208, 0.328, and 0.262 \u00c5, respectively. These results revealed that, compared to the 13c-AChE complex, the other complex (13d-AChE) established a significantly more stable conformation. During MD simulation production, examining amino acid residue behavior and its interaction with the compound necessitates assessing receptor structural flexibility upon compound binding [20]. Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 31 average RMSD values were 0.199, 0.296, and 0.218 \u00c5, in the 13d complex, whereas in the 13c complex, they were 0.208, 0.328, and 0.262 \u00c5, respectively. These results revealed that, compared to the 13c-AChE complex, the other complex (13d-AChE) established a significantly more stable conformation. During MD simulation production, examining amino acid residue behavior and its interaction with the compound necessitates assessing receptor structural flexibility upon compound binding [20].\nFigure 4. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the solvated receptor backbone, hybrids (13c and 13d), and the receptor.\nThe residue changes were evaluated through the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) method to study the effect of ligand binding to the relevant targets throughout the simulations (100 ns). The calculated average RMSF value for the 13c-AChE complex was 0.85 \u00c5, whereas its value for the 13d-AChE complex was 0.83 \u00c5 to protein systems. Figure 5 illustrates the overall amino acid residue fluctuations of both complex systems. These findings indicate that the inhibition of the 13d-AChE complex system is lower than that of the complex (13c-AChE) system, which will reflect well on the complex stability. Figure 6 depicts the number of hydrogen bond interactions between hybrids (13c and 13d) and the target protein (AChE) with an angle cut of 10 degrees and an rcut of 3.0 \u00c5, plotted against simulation time (100 ns). The average number of hydrogen bonds per timeframe was calculated to be 1.09 for 13c-AChE and 1.005 for 13d-AChE. It could be observed that the interactions dramatically increased the number of hydrogen bonds per trajectory analysis from 1 to 5 HBs. Therefore, the obtained results show that the system 13d complex acquired a relatively more stable conformation than the other system, the 13c complex. The radius of gyration (Rg) provides evidence for both simulation stability and protein structural compactness.

This approach might be more reliable compared to docking scores [32]. Therefore, to validate the docking scores that were anticipated by molecular docking studies for hybrids 13c and 13d against the AChE receptor, the binding free energy of the simulated ligand-protein was determined. The binding free energy of the simulated complex was computed to revalidate the inhibitor affinity predicted by docking simulation studies for the hybrids 13c and 13d with the AChE receptor. The MolAICal tool was used to take snapshots of the system trajectories being investigated in order to determine the binding free energy [33]. All the reported computed energy solvation components are presented in Table 4. Most negative values demonstrate favorable interactions. The binding free energy of both complexes 13c and 13d was calculated to be \u221223.645 and \u221236.042 kcal/mol, respectively. A close inspection of the individual energy contributions displays that the van der Waal energy of both complexes was found to be 13c-AChE with\u221244.913 kcal/mol, which had less binding affinity. Whereas 13d-AChE (\u221251.081 kcal/mol) exhibited strong binding affinity. The electrostatic energy for both complexes has considerable and moderate values.

Molecule Orbital Calculations\nThe optimized geometrical parameters (dihedral angles, bond angles, and bond lengths), natural charges, natural population of the nucleus of proposed derivatives, the energetics of the ground state, molecular electrostatic potential maps, and reactivity descriptors of synthesized hybrids were calculated and analyzed utilizing the spectroscopic data and elemental analysis.\nGround State Geometric Parameters (S281\u2013S299)\nThe optimized geometry, dihedral angles, bond angles, bond lengths, vector of the dipole moment, and numbering system of coumarin hybrids (13a-j) are presented in Table S1 and Figure S2. In the present work, the gas-phase wB97XD/6-311++G(d,p) has been compared to the available crystal data of 7-acetoxy-coumarin (ref. CCDC 1113091) [34] to evaluate the geometrical parameters. The mean absolute errors (MAE) that were calculated for the bond lengths and angles of the coumarin nucleus are given in Table S2. Careful inspection shows that MAEs range from 0.001 to 0.051 \u00c5 in bond length, from 0.014 to 0.562 degrees in bond angles, and from 0.004 to 1.354 degrees in dihedral angles in long-range corrected hybrid functionals (wB97XD), which give complete reducibility in predicting bond lengths and angles with experimental results with respect to experimental results and computational time and power uses. Therefore, the wB97XD/6-311++G (d,p) level of theory was selected for geometry optimizations and all calculations. The majority of the calculated bond lengths show underestimated values with percentages ranging from 0.25 to 1.1% in O1-O11 and an overestimation with values ranging from 1.1 to 5.1% in C8-C17. Generally, there is no major change. Inspection of the values of the dihedral angles compiled in Table S1 shows that almost all molecules are planar except the N36-phenyl moiety, which is out of plane and perpendicular in all the studied compounds (13a-j) with dihedral angle values of \u221241.8 to \u221247.6 degrees. The bond angle values calculated are shown in Table S1. Results vary from 109.7 to 125.0 degrees, which nicely compares to a regular SP2 hybridization geometry.\nNatural Charges and Natural Population\nNatural charge analysis performed on the electronic structures of synthesized compounds (13a-j) clearly describes the distribution of electrons in various subshells of their atomic orbitals. The charge analysis carried out for all compounds using wB97XD/6311++G(d,p) level of calculation is presented in Table 5. In Table 5, the most electronegative charges for hybrids (13a-j) are accumulated on O11, O24, O16, O1, N36, and C7, respectively, from \u22120.563 e to \u22120.313 e. According to an electrostatic point of view, these electronegative atoms tend to have active sites for electrons. However, the most electropositive atoms, such as C2, C10, C8, and C25, from +0.774e to +0.271e, respectively, tend to accept electrons at their active sites. Going from 13a to 13j is a minor change in natural charge with the same pattern of electrostatic mapping with the order. An in-depth study of the natural charge pattern of hybrids is extremely beneficial for gaining insight into the crucial interactions between title hybrids and biological receptors of AChE, which enhances the investigation of cytotoxicity activity.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 16 of 32\nA=O, H, or Cl means different atoms in derivatives series; Values are mean \u00b1 SD triplicate assays.\nFrontier Molecular Orbitals (FMOs) Analysis\nAs presented in Table 6, among all synthesized hybrids, 13e displayed higher stability and less reactivity with an energy gap value of 7.96 eVm, whereas hybrid 13b (\u2206Egap = 7.38 eV) showed the lowest stability and highest reactivity [35\u201338]. The energy gaps of the rest of the hybrids were ordered as follows: 13j < 13i < 13d < 13c < 13a < 13f < 13h < 13g. Due to the significance of the parameters such as I (potential ionization) and A (electron affinity), their calculations enable us to determine the global reactivity descriptors. The I and A parameters are related to the one-electron orbital energies of the HOMO and LUMO. The obtained results (Table 6) exhibited that hybrids 13j had the highest values of I\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 17 of 32\n(8.29 eV) and A (0.37 eV). The I value of the other hybrids are 13d > 13c > 13e > 13i > 13a > 13g > 13f > 13b > 13h. Whereas in the case of A values, the order is as follows: 13d > 13c > 13a > 13b > 13i > 13g > 13e > 13f > 13h. Then we can predict that derivatives 13j, 13d, and 13c are the best candidates for interaction with other biological AChE receptors. All of the hybrids have almost similar HOMO and LUMO isodensity dispersion as depicted in Figure S3, except for 13c and 13d (Figure 10), which have slightly different dispersion on the coumarin rings and the (E)-N-benzylideneaniline moiety.

In chemistry, understanding the nature of chemical interactions and predicting the chemical reactivity of molecules, atoms, or ions are the two most challenging problems. Herein, we studied the reactivity of novel synthesized derivatives (13a-j). Table 7 shows the values of the important reactivity descriptors that help us figure out how reactive and stable hybrids (13a-j) are. Among all compounds, coumarin 13j, with the highest value of \u03b7 = 3.98 eV, is the chemically hardest compound, while coumarin 13b, with the lowest value (\u03b7 = 3.69 eV), is chemically soft and more reactive. The chemical hardness of other hybrids is ordered as 13j > 13i > 13d > 13c > 13a > 13f > 13h > 13g. A general idea of charge transfer in any molecule\u2019s ground state can be obtained from the electronic chemical potential (V) value. In terms of chemical potential, hybrid 13h has the greatest value (\u22123.8 eV), whereas hybrid 13j has the lowest (\u22124.33 eV), and other coumarin hybrids are in the following order: 13f > 13b > 13g > 13e > 13i > 13a > 13c > 13d (Table 7).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 18 of 32\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 16 of 31 C41 \u22120.196 \u22120.237 \u22120.218 \u22120.218 \u22120.196 \u22120.237 \u22120.237 \u22120.238 \u22120.219 \u22120.218 C42 \u22120.238 \u22120.213 \u22120.221 \u22120.220 \u22120.237 \u22120.211 \u22120.210 \u22120.213 \u22120.221 \u22120.219 A47 0.208 \u22120.545 \u22120.003 \u22120.001 0.208 \u22120.545 \u22120.545 \u22120.545 \u22120.003 \u22120.001 A48 0.213 0.213 0.214 \u22120.546 \u22120.547 \u22120.547 0.212 \u22120.538 \u22120.537 0.213 A=O, H, or Cl means different atoms in derivatives series; Values are mean \u00b1 SD triplicate assays.

It is the first derivative of the electronic density \u03c1(r) in relation to the electron numbers (N) of a system at a constant external potential \u03bd(r) [43], as represented in the following equation:\nf (r) = (\n\u2202\u03c1(r) \u2202N ) v(r) = 1 2 ( \u2202\u00b5 \u2202v(r) ) v(r)\nBased on the changes in electrical density throughout a reaction process, we can calculate Fukui functions to identify the active sites. As shown in the following equation, for the three different environments of chemicals, the Fukui functions f+ (r), f\u2013 (r), and f0 (r) are determined [44\u201346]:\nf\u2212(r) = qk(N)\u2212 qk(N \u2212 1) \u2248 \u03c1HOMO(r) for electrophilic attack f+(r) = qk(N + 1)\u2212 qk(N ) \u2248 \u03c1LUMO(r) for nucleophilic attack f 0(r) = 12 [qk(N + 1)\u2212 qk(N \u2212 1)] \u2248 1 2 [ \u03c1HOMO(r) + \u03c1LUMO(r) ] for radical attack\nwhere qk(N), qk(N + 1) and qk(N\u2212 1) are the atomic populations on the kth atom for the neutral molecule, anionic and cationic species, respectively. Tables S3 and S4 represent the descriptor values of coumarin hybrids (13a-j) computed at the wb97xd/6-311++G (d, p) level. In addition to knowing how an atomic site in a molecule could be electrophilic or nucleophilic, Labbe et al. [47] suggested an additional dual descriptor (\u2206 f (r)) that is provided by the following equation:\n\u2206 f (r) = f+(r)\u2212 f\u2212(r)\nThe obtained results indicate that the most electrophilic reactivity is on the imine moiety, which is mostly found on the atoms O24, N36, C37, C40, and C42, while the nucleophilic active site on the coumarin moiety is located on O1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C8, O11, and O16 localized. From Tables S3 and S4, when considering the dual descriptor \u2206 f (r) for the nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks, as well as the philicity indices, the same result could be obtained. The high electronegativity of atoms N and O led to an electron density redistribution, in addition to the effect of -OCH3 insertion groups in R1 and R2 substitutions, that causes these characteristic changes. These findings are in agreement with the analysis of the natural population using calculated HOMO and LUMO. In 2004, Chattaraj et al. proposed the generalized philicity concept; with the help of corresponding condensed-to-atom Fukui function variations, they developed a local quantity known as philicity coupled with a site k in a molecule ( f \u03b1k ), as given in the following equation [48].\n\u03c9\u03b1k = \u03c9 f \u03b1 k\nwhere \u03b1 represents the local philic quantities, radical (\u03b1 = 0), nucleophilic (\u03b1 = +), and electrophilic (\u03b1 = \u2212) attacks. According to the aforementioned equation, the most electrophilic\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 20 of 32\nproperty has the highest value of \u03c9\u03b1k . Moreover, different local softness was proposed by Lee et al. to define the reactivity of a molecule [49] as in the following Equation.\ns\u03b1k = s f \u03b1 k\nIn the aforementioned equation, \u03b1 is represented by local softness quantities for nucleophilic (\u03b1 = +), electrophilic (\u03b1 = \u2212), and radical attacks (\u03b1 = 0). In order to complete the picture, the software package Multiwfn (v. 3.7) determined the local electrophilicity and nucleophilicity index, condensed local softness, and relative electrophilicity/nucleophilicity for each atom in the compounds from a CDFT point of view [50]. A close inspection would show that all the compounds had the donating and the back-donating processes at the center of their active sites, in agreement with the Fukui functions and also with the frontier orbital, as shown in the results obtained, which are boldly given in Tables S5 and S6. These findings showed the studied compounds to have several active sites, making them able to interact with the surface of pocket proteins via donating electrons. Lastly, the aforementioned local descriptors show that the experimental data in this study are in agreement with the theoretical variation of the compound\u2019s efficiency.\nMolecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP)\nIn several fields of chemistry, the electrostatic potential (ESP) on molecular surfaces has become one of the most effective tools for identifying, analyzing, and understanding trends [51,52]. It is related to electronic density, which is an excellent descriptor for describing the charge distributions on a molecule, identifying regions that are differently charged, and identifying the sites where hydrogen-bonding interactions, electrophilic properties, and nucleophilic properties are most likely to take place [53]. Electrostatic potentials (ESPs) are essential for predicting and understanding intermolecular interactions [52]. The crucial interactions between the synthesized hybrids and biological targets must be better understood with the help of an in-depth analysis of their ESPs. The ESP, as denoted by V(r) (in a.u.) at a given point r (x,y,z) in the molecule\u2019s vicinity, is a calculation of the electrostatic energy that a positive unit test charge would experience at that point. Negative and positive ESPs corresponded to attractive and repulsion interactions, respectively. The following equation defines the ESP as the interaction energy between a proton at r and the electrical charge produced by the electrons and nuclei.\nV(r) = nuclei\n\u2211 A ZA |RA \u2212 r|\n\u2212 \u222b\n\u03c1(r\u2032) |r\u2212 r\u2032|dr \u2032\nwhere ZA is the charge, RA is the position of nucleus A, and \u03c1 (r\u2019) is the electron density at position r\u2019. The electrostatic potentials-mapped surfaces of the hybrids (13a-j) are presented in Figure S4. The overall van der Waals surface can be divided into several fragments by the quantitative molecular surface analysis module of the Multiwfn package, and this capability enables us to analyze the features of the ESP distribution. For hybrid 13a, the surface displays a high negative value of ESP at the O11, O16, O24, and N36 (\u221243.97, \u221216.9, \u221211.0, and \u221228.01 kcal/mol), respectively, with the positive charge being distributed among various active sites. As for the potential of various derivatives (13b-j) to redistribute electrons, the global minima of ESPs around O11, O16, O24, and N36 centers increase, reaching minimum values in case 13f with sequence (\u221246.9, \u221218.5, \u221222.0, and \u221227.9 kcal/mol) due to the electron-donating OCH3 group but in case 13c and 13d (Figure 11), Cl derivatives show that the negative decrease due to electron drawing behavior as sequence (\u221243.3, \u221216.3, \u22129.8 and \u221224.5 kcal/mol) and (\u221245.9, \u221218.5, \u22126.5 and \u221223.5 kcal/mol), respectively. The global maxima of ESPs on the derivatives (13b-j) surfaces are located on the carbon with the proton of these derivatives, which vary from +36.2, +35.6, +37.4, +29.4, +28.3, +27.6, +34.1, +26.8, +28.7 and +35.9 kcal/mol for hybrids (13a-j), respectively. This indicates that electrostatic or hydrogen bonding will be the main interaction between\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 21 of 32\nhybrids and their target receptors. The ability to generate hydrogen bond interaction and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is confirmed by a careful examination of these ESP values, indicating that they can act as therapeutics. These values show the same findings from the analyses of the NBO population and local reactivity descriptors reported in the previous section.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 20 of 31\n+28.3, +27.6, +34.1, +26.8, +28.7 and +35.9 kcal/mol for hybrids (13a-j), respectively.

The simulation studies were carried out utilizing the NAMD (v2.13) suit [74] and the CHARMM36 [75] force field. Furthermore, the latest CHARMM/CGenFF force field was used to generate the parameters and topological files for the selected compounds [19,76]. The complex structure (ligand-protein) was placed in the middle of a box that solvated molecules of water with a TIP3P explicit solvation model. A 0.15 molar solution of (145 Na+ and 135 Cl-) ions, to mimic the physiological salt concentrations, was added to provide electrostatic screening and charge neutralization which extended 20 \u00c5 from the protein. CHARMM and the periodic boundary conditions were set with dimensions of a rectangle-cubic system of 117.0, 117.0, and 117.0 \u00c5 in x, y, and z directions, respectively. The MD studies include minimization, equilibration, and data analysis. There were no atoms restricted in the MD simulations. The isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble and a 2 fs time integration step were selected in this study, and the pressure was set at 1 atm utilizing the Nose\u2019-Hoover Langevin piston barostat [77]. The Langevin thermostat has been used to set the temperature at 300.0 K [78]. The force-field parameters were assumed in order to minimize and equilibrate the complexes in the system, which have a scaling of 1.0 \u00c5. The preliminary energy of the complex was minimized through 2000 steps at 300 K. The temperature, kinetic energy, and/or pressure of the system were controlled by Langevin dynamics simulation through another 144,000 steps. The 500,000 minimization steps were used to equilibrate the solvated system, and 50,000,000 runs for 100 ns. The VMD package was used for the analysis of the output data [79]. A 20.0 \u00c5 for the distance cut-off was used for Lennard Jones interactions, and short-range non-bonded interactions with a pair list distance of 12 \u00c5 were smoothly truncated at 8.0 \u00c5. The long-range electrostatic interactions were analyzed and visualized using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) procedure [80], where simulated cells were placed in a grid box with 1.0 \u00c5.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 27 of 32"

The molecular structures of hybrids were geometrically optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with long-range corrections functional wB97XD (DFT/wB97XD) [83], which includes empirical dispersion with basis set 6-311++G (d,p) [84]. During the geometry optimization, no symmetry restrictions were used [85,86]. The choice of long-range corrections functional wB97XD with a large basis set was due to the accuracy, consistency, flexibility, and better performance of Grimme\u2019s D2 dispersion model, which includes empirical dispersion [83,87]. The same level of theory has been applied to calculate the vibrational frequency for each compound, and the molecular structures of each hybrid were found to correspond to real minima of the potential energy surface [88]. In order to identify the reactive site of the molecules, the DFT/wB97XD was employed to describe reactivity descriptors and molecular stability. A descriptor of local reactivity was computed using the Fukui function and the dual descriptor [40,42,47]. Furthermore, the quantum chemical descriptors from conceptual density functional theory (CDFT) were calculated by utilizing the Multiwfn (v3.7) package [41]. The electrostatic potential (ESP) of the molecules was rendered by the Visual Molecular Dynamics package (VMD 1.9 program) based on the data outputted by the Multiwfn program [50,79]. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses have been calculated utilizing NBO 3.1, which is provided in the Gaussian 09W program. The GaussView (v6.1) [89] and ChemCraft (v1.6) packages [90] were used to visualize the optimized structure and molecular orbitals.

            "text": "A series of Schiff base-coumarin hybrids (13a-j) were designed with the assistance of a molecular docking study. The affinity energy of hybrids (13a-j) on the active site of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was in the range of \u221210.6 to \u221213.2 kcal/mol, while the affinity energy of positive controls, donepezil and galantamine, was recorded at \u221211.4 and \u22129.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The obtained results showed that most of the designed hybrids were more active than the positive controls. Hybrids were synthesized and bioevaluated against AChE. Results showed that most of them could potentially inhibit the target enzyme. Compounds 13c and 13d with IC50 values of 0.232 \u00b1 0.011 and 0.190 \u00b1 0.004 yielded the lowest IC50 values and were 5-fold stronger than the positive control. The detailed insights into the electronic structure properties, its link to drug-like properties, and the structure-activity relationships of the designed compounds were provided by applying the high level of computational approaches of DFT/wB97XD methods by using 6-311++G(d,p) as the basis set wave function. Moreover, the molecular docking studies revealed that the synthesized compounds exhibit molecular interactions via hydrogen bonds with GLY121, GLY122, TYR132, SER203, PHE295, and TYR337 amino acid residues of the target enzyme. Careful inspection of the pattern of binding sites and binding energy indicated 13c and 13d compounds could be good candidates for AChE inhibitors, which\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 971 28 of 32\nis correlated with experimental results. The drug likeness and QSAR descriptors show that compound 13f has the highest value, while compound 13a has the lowest values in all descriptors for other derivatives. All target compounds except 13c and 13j have good aqueous solubility. Furthermore, Log P values of compounds 13f = 13h < 13d = 13i < 13b = 13e = 13g < 13a are in the field of optimal values (0 < Log P < 5). Based on these, it can be stated that these compounds have good oral bioavailability and optimal biological activity. The stability of the systems was measured using RMSD during the 100 ns simulations. Obtained results revealed that the 13d complex system acquired a relatively more stable conformation than the 13c complex. The calculated average RMSF values for the 13c-AChE and 13d-AChE complexes to protein systems were 0.85 and 0.83 \u00c5, respectively, which demonstrate that the system inhibition of the 13d-AChE protein complex system is lower than the other systems inhibition, which will reflect well on the complex stability. The binding free energy technique (MM/GBSA) of the simulated complex was computed, and it was found to be \u221223.645 and \u221236.042 kcal/mol for complexes 13c and 13d, respectively. Thus, it is suggested that the stability of the 13d-4EY7 complex over the other is better. The overall study indicates that 13d has comparable and even better descriptors than Galantamine and can be a potential AChE candidate.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ ph16070971/s1, Detailed description of biological evaluation protocol and IC50 calculation, Inhibition diagrams for the compounds, FTIR spectra of the compounds, 1H and 13C spectra of the compounds, HRMS spectra of the compounds, Figure S1: The proposed binding mode of synthesized hybrids (13a-j) docked in the active site of acetylcholinesterase (4EY7) protein; (2D and 3D ligand-receptor interactions), Figure S2: The optimized geometry, numbering system, vector of dipole moment of the synthesized compounds, Figure S3: Frontier molecular orbitals of the synthesized compounds, Figure S4: MEP surfaces of the synthesized compounds, Table S1: The selected bond length (Ao), bond angles and dihedral angles, (degree) of the compounds, Table S2: Mean absolute errors computed for selected bond lengths (Ao) and angles (degree) of synthesized compounds, Tables S3 and S4: Values of the Fukui functions and dual descriptor of compounds, Table S5: Values of the condensed local softnesses (Hartree*e) of compounds, Table S6: Values of the condensed local electrophilicity (ElP)/nucleophilicity (NuP) index (e*eV) of compounds.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.H.H. and J.J.; methodology, A.H.H. and F.A.A.; software, M.A.N. and S.I.A.; formal analysis, M.A.N. and S.I.A.; investigation, A.H.H. and M.M.A.; resources, A.J.O. and H.F.A.; data curation, S.M. and J.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.H.H. and H.F.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.J. and M.M.A.; visualization, S.I.A. and A.R.B.; supervision, J.J.; project administration, S.M.; funding acquisition, A.J.O.
