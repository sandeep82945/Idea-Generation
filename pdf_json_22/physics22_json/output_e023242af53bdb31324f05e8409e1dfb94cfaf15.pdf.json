Within this mass range, our analysis also reveals 32 line-like features detected at \u22653 \u03c3 significance, 29 of which coincide with known instrumental and astrophysical lines. In particular, we report on the detection of the electronpositron annihilation (511 keV) and 26 Al (1809 keV) lines with spatial profiles consistent with previous results in the literature. For the particular case of the sterile neutrino DM, we report the limits on the mixing angle as a function of sterile neutrino mass.

The most prominent evidences for M originate from observations of rotation curves of galaxies (Trimle 1987 ; Ashman 1992 ; Sofue & Rubin 2001 ), cosmic microwave ackground fluctuations (Planck Collaboration 2016 ; Dvorkin et al. 022 ), and Bullet clusters (Clowe et al. 2006 ). The possibility of a tandard Model (SM) particle being DM has been ruled already out or a long time (see e.g. Tanabashi et al. 2018 ; Boyarsky et al. 2019 ; rofumo, Giani & Piattella 2019 , for recent re vie ws). Extensions f the SM proposed se veral well-moti v ated DM-candidate particles. he suggested mass range of such particles extends from smaller than eV (axions and axion-like particles) through keV (sterile neutrinos) o GeV-TeV [weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and even o > 10 13 GeV (WIMPZILLAs); for a re vie w of all candidates see e.g. eng 2010 ]. In what follows, we consider the general keV-MeV mass scale\nM, which could decay with an emission of one or more photons. typical example of such a DM particle is the right-handed (sterile) eutrino (see Boyarsky et al. 2019 , for a recent re vie w). Such a neurino interacts with the rest of the matter only via a mixing with SM active) neutrinos and can therefore survive cosmologically for a long ime. The sterile neutrino could also be produced in the early Universe ith the correct abundances (Dodelson & Widrow 1994 ; Shi & Fuller 999 ). The mass of the sterile neutrino (like any fermionic DM) is onstrained to be higher than M DM 1 keV. Such a bound arises rom limits imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Specifically, he phase-space density of the DM particles in the haloes of dwarf\nE-mail: si.fischer@student.uni-tuebingen.de\ne w m\nPub\npheroidal galaxies cannot exceed the fundamental limits imposed y the exclusion principle and the initial phase-space density at the oment of production of the DM in the Early Universe (Tremaine & unn 1979 ; Gorbuno v, Khmelnitsk y & Rubako v 2008 ; Boyarsk y, uchayskiy & Iakubo vsk yi 2009 ; Savchenk o & Rudak o vsk yi 2019 ). The (lightest) sterile neutrino particle N could decay into a photon nd SM neutrino N \u2192 \u03bd + \u03b3 . Consequently, the decay signal is a arrow line at energy E = M DM /2 with the strength of the signal eing determined by the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 . High values of \u03b8 are forbidden as the abundance of sterile neutrinos roduced in the Early Universe with such mixing angles would xceed the observed DM density in the present day (Dodelson & idrow 1994 ; Asaka, Shaposhnikov & Laine 2007 ; Boyarsky et al. 019 ). Additional upper limits on \u03b8 originate from non-detection f the line-like feature in multiple DM-dominated objects with he current generation of instruments (Boyarsky et al. 2019 ). Such earches in particular were performed in the keV-MeV band with he X-ray Multi-Mirror-Mission Newton (XMM-Newton; Malyshev, eronov & Eckert 2014 ; Ruchayskiy et al. 2016 ; Foster et al. 2021 ), uclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Neronov, Malyhev & Eckert 2016 ; Ng et al. 2019 ; Roach et al. 2022 ), International amma-Ray Astr ophysics Laboratory/SPectr ometer on INTEGRAL INTEGRAL/SPI ; Boyarsky et al. 2008 ; Laha, Mu \u0303 noz & Slatyer 020 ; Calore et al. 2022 ) and are suggested to be performed with uture missions, such as Athena, eXTP and THESEUS in Neronov &\nalyshe v ( 2016 ), Malyshe v et al.

Here, ( l , b ) represent the galactic coordinates f the centre of observation and r 8.5 kpc stands for the distance un-GC. We note that the DM column density, representing the total DM ass in the FoV, is a function of the considered DM density profile DM and is consequently a subject to statistical and systematic ncertainties connected to the poor knowledge of the DM distribution n our Galaxy. In order to marginalize o v er possible sources of ncertainty, we consider several DM density profiles of the MW ith recently reported parameters from the literature. Namely, we ocus on the following DM density profiles: the Navarro-Frank-White (NFW) profile (Navarro, Frenk & White 996 )\nNFW = \u03c10 r r 0 ( 1 + r r 0 )2 , (3) he Burkert profile (Burkert 1995 )\nBUR = \u03c10 r 3 0\n( r + r 0 )( r 2 + r 2 ) , (4)\n0\nhe Pseudo-isothermal profile (Jimenez, Verde & Oh 2003 )\nISO = \u03c10 1 + ( r r 0 )2 , (5) nd the Core-modified profile (Brownstein 2009 )\nCOM = \u03c10 r 3 0\nr 3 + r 3 0 .

The corresponding column densities S DM ( \u03c6) for the profiles arameters reported in the table are shown in Fig. 1 . One can see that the differences in DM column densities could each an order of magnitude close to the GC for certain DM density rofiles. In what follows, we adopt the NFW DM-density profile with arameters reported in Cautun et al. ( 2020 ) as a reference profile. e use the rest of the considered profiles to estimate the level of ystematic uncertainty connected to the insufficient knowledge of he DM distribution in our Galaxy.

(8) INSTRU MENTATION A N D DATA ANALYS I S he analysis performed in this work is based on publicly available NTEGRAL/SPI data taken during about 20 yr of instrumental peration. In this section, we briefly describe the basic characteristics f the INTEGRAL/SPI instrument, describe the used data set, and ur approach to its analysis. .1 SPI spectrometer\nPI is a spectrometer, coded-mask instrument on board of the \u2018INernational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\u2019 (Winkler et al. 003 ; Kuulkers et al. 2021 ) that has been operational since 2002. PI operates in the energy band of 20\u20138 MeV and is characterized y an excellent energy resolution E / E \u223c 1/500 (Vedrenne et al. 003 ). More precisely, the energy-dependence of the full width alf-maximum (FWHM) energy resolution can be approximated s (Roques et al. 2003 ):\nE\n1 keV = 1 . 54 + 4 . 6 \u00b7 10 \u22123\n\u221a E\n1 keV + 6 . 0 \u00b7 10 \u22124\n( E\n1 keV\n) . (9)\nNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nThe satellite orbits Earth on \u223c3-d period, a highly eccentric orbit hich is partially located in Earth\u2019s radiation belts. The regular\nrossings of the belts lead to a strong irradiation of the satellite y high-ener gy char ged particles and consecutively to a strong timeariable instrumental background.\nContrary to focusing-optics instruments like e.g. XMM-Newton, NTEGRAL/SPI has limited imaging capabilities due to its codedask aperture. For the analysis presented below, similarly to Boarsky et al. ( 2008 ), we explicitly treat the instrument as a collimator ith \u223c17.5 \u25e6-radius (partially coded) FoV. Such an FoV corresponds o FoV \u2248 0.29 sr. The on-axis ef fecti ve area A eff, on of INTEGRAL/SPI is nergy-dependent and reaches \u223c100 cm 2 , see Fig. 2 . For he analysis of the signal that co v ers the whole FoV of he instrument, the off-axis dependence of A eff should be aken into account, which leads to somewhat lower values f the ef fecti v e area for e xtended sources (Boyarsk y et al. 008 ):\neff,ext ( E) = 1 FoV \u222b FoV d A eff ( E, )\n\u2248 0 . 165 ( E\n1 keV\n)0 . 11 A eff,ext . (10)\n.2 Data set and data analysis\nn what is presented below, we utilize the data collected by INTERAL/SPI during its operation since 2002. The data set co v ers almost 9 yr (2003 February 28 to 2021 February 02, revolutions: 46\u20132330) f publicly available observations 1 taken in normal operational mode spimode = 41 data selection flag) with at least 100 s good spi xposure. We additionally e xcluded observations performed during eriods of SPI annealing phases, 2 i.e. time periods during which the PI detectors are heated to reco v er from radiative damage (Dubath 015 ). For each of the selected observations, we extracted the deected photons from the spi-oper.fits files ( SPI.-OPSDLL + SPI.-OSGL-ALL extensions). The main part of the lectronics of SPI is the Analogue Front End Electronics (AFEE)\nTable 2.

The energy range 400\u2013 000 keV (650\u20132200 keV before 2012 May 13 or before Rev. 170) is known to be affected by the AFEE artefacts (Vedrenne t al. 2003 ; Jourdain & Roques 2009 ). In this energy range, e explicitly used only photon events detected by the Pulse hape discriminator (PSD), which are stored in SPI.-OPSDLL of the spi-oper.fits files. To take into account the educed SPI efficiency in this energy band, we additionally scaled own the effective area by a factor of 0.85 (Jourdain & Roques 009 ). Based on the extracted photon list mentioned abo v e, we produced spectrum d N /(d E d t d A ) for each observation using the effective area iven by equation ( 10 ) and the exposure time of the corresponding bservation. We binned the spectra into narrow energy bins of width E /3, see equation ( 9 ). We note that some of the energy bins host low ( N < 25) number of photons. In order to properly handle he Poisson statistics in these bins, we adopted N = \u221a N + 1 4 + (Barlow 2004 ) for the statistical uncertainty. For the energy bins ith N \u2265 25 photons, we employed the standard Gaussian statistical ncertainty N = \u221a N . Given that the DM surface brightness increases towards the irection of the GC and an a priori independence of the instrumental ackground on the sky-position, we applied an \u2018ON-OFF\u2019 technique iming to detect the signal from the decaying DM and to eliminate the trong contribution of the instrumental background. Namely, we split he entire data set into two groups: \u2018ON\u2019 (centred closer than 15 \u25e6 from he GC) and \u2018OFF\u2019 (centred further than 120 \u25e6 from the GC). To miniize the effects of the time-dependent variability of the instrumental ackground, we selected one observation from the OFF data set for very observ ation from the ON data set, taken not later than 20 d part.\nSuch a pairing and the consequent subselection allow for an ccurate control of the time-variable INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental ackground. As shown in Teegarden & Watanabe ( 2006 ) for observaions separated in time by not more than 20 d, the level of instrumental ackground is in a good correlation with the strength of a strong nstrumental Germanium line at 198 keV. In this case, the strength f the line can be used to rescale the INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental ackground. The rescaled spectra of the OFF-group observations ere then treated as a background and subtracted from the respective N-group spectra. Consequently, the expected strength of the signal\nn our ON-OFF type analysis is given by (see equation 8 ):\nE ( \u03c6) = 2 \u00b7 10 \u221210 k x (\nDM\n10 \u221220 yr \u22121\n) \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u3008 S DM ( ON ) \u3009 \u2212 \u3008 S DM ( OFF ) \u3009 10 28 keV cm \u22122 erg cm \u22122 s \u22121 ,\n\u3008 S DM ( ON ) \u3009 = \u2211\ni\nS DM ( ON i ) T ON, i / \u2211\ni\nT ON, i ,\nS DM ( OFF ) \u3009 = \u2211\ni\n\u03b1i S DM ( OFF i ) T OFF, i / \u2211\ni\nT OFF, i ,\n\u03b1i = f ON, i (198 keV ) /f OFF, i (198 keV ) .

The mean S DM (ON) \u3009 and \u3008 S DM (OFF) \u3009 values correspond to the exposureime weighted averages of the DM column densities in the ON nd OFF regions. We note also that all rescaling coefficients i are close to 1 with a standard deviation of merely \u223c11 er cent.\nSuch an approach resulted in 9162 observational pairs with a total uration for the ON data set of 20 and 24 Ms for the OFF data set. he mean values \u3008 S DM (ON) \u3009 and \u3008 S DM (OFF) \u3009 of the DM column ensities for ON and OFF data sets are summarized in Table 2 .\n.3 Residual background and systematics treatment\nhe ON-OFF procedure described abo v e allowed us to significantly educe the flux level observed in the ON group of observations by a actor of 10 2 \u201310 3 , see Fig. 3 (upper panel), by strongly suppressing he time-variable instrumental background of SPI.\nOne can see that close to the 198 keV line the subtraction is not erfect and results in a wiggle-like structure, see Fig. 3 , bottom panel. he ne gativ e wing of this structure, ho we ver, allo ws to estimate the evel of systematic uncertainty connected to the selected method of odelling and subtracting the instrumental background.

F or searching a narrow line-like ignal from DM decay, ho we ver, one could adopt any smooth (i.e. ot hosting lines) model of the astrophysical emission. Such a model ould present a continuum-like signal from the joint contribution of ll astrophysical sources. To build such a model, we used the \u2018sliding indow\u2019 method (Boyarsky et al. 2008 ). Namely, in every energy in, we replaced the flux f ( E ) with\nliding ( f ( E) , size ) = \u3008 f ( E) \u3009 [ \u2212size ; + size ] \u2212 1\n2 (\u3008 f ( E) \u3009 [ \u22122 size ; \u2212size ] + \u3008 f ( E) \u3009 [ size ; + 2 size ] ) , here \u3008 f ( E) \u3009 [ E 1 ; E 2 ] stands for the total flux integrated (summed) etween energies [ E \u2212 E 1 ; E + E 2 ] (see equation 8 ); size \u2013 for the haracteristic size of the sliding window and E \u2013 for the SPI energy esolution, equation ( 9 ). In our analysis, we used size = 2 / 3 E. uch an approach allows the subtraction of a half-sum of the adjacent nergy intervals from any energy bin and to ef fecti vely eliminate the mooth (non-line-like) background. At the positions of lines, such method allows the subtraction of the pedestal emission estimated rom the vicinity around the line energies.\nWe note also that after applying the sliding window method to he spectrum its points lose their statistical independence. Ho we ver, or broad enough sizes ( E ) in the sliding windows method, he significance of the signal at fixed energy is just given by the ignificance (abo v e 0) of the given point. That is, no additional ummation is needed to account for the presence of the signal in everal nearby energy bins.\nTo the left and right of the positions of strong spectral lines, he sliding window method is known to create wiggle-like ne gativ e esiduals, see Fig. 5 . Such wiggles are connected to o v ersubtraction of he estimated background level when the left/right wing of the sliding indow coincides with the position of the line. The discussed wiggles resent an additional source of systematic uncertainty . Namely , at nergies with the ne gativ e flux after sliding window, we added a ystematic uncertainty equal to the absolute value of the flux.\nTo summarize, in what follows and where applicable, we added a tatistical uncertainty, a systematic uncertainty connected to the intrumental background modelling (see equation 12 ) and a systematic ncertainty connected to wiggles due to the sliding window method n quadratures. The discussed uncertainties result in an ON-OFF flux\nfunction of energy. The level of systematic uncertainty was estimated to be uncertainty \u03b4n derived from the presence of ne gativ e residuals close to the siduals at other energies.\nlogy Patna user on 19 January 2024\nFigure 5.

DM-DECAY LINE C A N D I DAT E S A N D O N S T R A I N T S .1 Line search and decaying DM constraints n the ON-OFF spectrum discussed abo v e (after the sliding window ethod was applied), we performed a search for narrow line-like eatures abo v e zero background. The positions of 3 \u03c3 (statistical) significant lines are summarized n Table 3 . In the same table, we also provide possible identifications f the lines with known instrumental lines listed in Weidenspointner t al. ( 2003 ) and Diehl et al. ( 2018 ).\nAt all energies, we also constructed a 3 \u03c3 (stat + syst) upper limit n the residual flux defined as a sum of the mean ON-OFF flux and hree (statistical + systematic) uncertainties. Using equation ( 11 ; ee also equation 8 ), we converted this flux limit into constraints on he lifetime \u03c4 = 1/ DM of decaying DM (for k x = 1) and similarly nto constraints on the mixing angle sin 2 (2 \u03b8 ) for sterile neutrinos. hese constraints based on the reference DM density profile (Cautun t al. 2020 ) of the MW are shown in Fig. 7 (DM decay lifetime) and ig. 8 (sterile neutrino mixing angle). The shaded/hatched regions orrespond to the full range of limits derived for other DM density\nrofiles listed in Table 1 , i.e. to systematic uncertainties connected ith poor knowledge of the DM distribution in the MW.\n.2 Off-GC angle analysis\nhe analysis presented abo v e rev ealed 32 line-candidates detected ith a statistical significance of 3 \u03c3 , see Table 3 . Although most f the lines coincide with known INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental lines, hree of them do not have a clear instrumental counterpart. In this ection, we discuss the off-GC angle dependency of the flux in elected line candidates, which can help to further discriminate etween the purely instrumental lines and lines of potential DMecay origin.\nWe note that the strength of any line originating from a potential M-decay is proportional to the DM column density in the observed egion, see equations ( 8 ) and ( 2 ) and consequently depends on the M density profile, see also Fig. 1 . As discussed abo v e, this results n a higher expected DM decay signal from the inner regions of the alaxy, which should gradually decrease to the MW outskirts. The ngular, off-GC dependency of the expected signal strength can be sed to discriminate between such a signal and another signals of nstrumental or astrophysical origin.\nFor the off-GC angle analysis, we utilized the entire available data et of INTEGRAL/SPI without any selection criteria regarding the ff-GC angle (as was done for the ON-OFF spectrum construction). o we v er, we e xplicitly remo v ed all ScWs taken during high solar ctivity periods (based on reports in the INTEGRAL Operation eporting 3 ). In particular, we ignored the data taken during Rev. 83\u2013325 and Rev. 1850\u20131911. The final data set contained 124 769 cWs with a total exposure of \u223c300 Msec. In order to control the time-variable instrumental background of PI for the off-GC angle analysis, we split the whole data o v er unches of data taken between particular annealing phases where he SPI instrumental background remains relatively stable (Siegert t al. 2019 ). In each of the 32 periods, we determined the timeveraged flux in the 198 keV line and, similar to the ON-OFF nalysis, renormalized all spectra taken during this period to match he same flux in this line. Consequently, we built the off-GC angle rofile for all other lines listed in Table 3 during the corresponding eriods. To compensate for a possible time-variability of the level of the nstrumental background\u2019s continuum between the selected periods, e explicitly subtracted a constant from every off-GC angle profile o eliminate the (weighted) mean signal at angles \u03c6 > 60 \u25e6. We note hat for the considered DM profiles, the expected strength of a DMecay signal at \u03c6 > 60 \u25e6 is smaller than the signal from the GC irection by a factor of at least \u223c4. Therefore, the subtraction of the onstant cannot fully eliminate the DM decay signal as a function of he off-GC angle.\nThe usage of the 198 keV line for renormalizing the spectra does ot allow the use of this line for the estimation of systematics s it was done in the ON-OFF analysis. In order to estimate the evel of systematic uncertainties in this case, we utilized the second rightest instrumental line at 138 keV. Namely, we added systematic ncertainty at a level sufficient to make the flux in this background ubtracted line consistent with zero at 1 \u03c3 level in each of the onsidered time periods and off-GC angles. Thus, the systematic rror for the 138 keV line is given by the residual flux f R ( \u03c6) at each\nMNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nM\n47.8 16 0 1.6 2380 Useries 53.1 9.7 0 1.6 73 m Gecomplex 60.6 7.4 0 1.61 73 m Gecomplex, sumpeak 65.98 12.2 0 1.62 73 m Gecomplex, sumpeak 86.57 9.1 0 1.63 Various isotopes 92.57 13 0 1.64 67 m Zncomplex 101.88 6.31 0 1.65 67 m Zncomplex 140.11 17 0 1.68 75 m Gecomplex 175.07 5.63 0 1.71 71 As(EC) 71 Ge 185.9 11.27 0 1.71 71 As(EC) 71 Ge + K 193.34 29.42 0 1.72 71 m Gecomplex 438.09 5.7 0 1.9 69 m Zn(IT) 69 Zn 511.0 35.22 4.2 1.95 Positron annihilation 583.63 7.72 0 2 208 Tl( \u03b2\u2212) 208 Pb 699.25 3.02 0 2.08 205 Bi(EC) 205 Pb + L \u2020 810.82 3.34 0 2.16 58 Co(EC) 58 Fe 835.36 3.09 0 2.17 54 Mn(EC) 54 Cr + L 880.56 5.08 0 2.2 206 Bi(EC) 206 Pb 910.86 3.94 0 2.23 232 Thseries 1105.47 4.51 0 2.34 69 Ge(EC) 69 Ga \u2020 1114.9 9.28 0 2.36 65 Zn(EC) 65 Cu 1135.43 3.10 0 2.38 77 Ge( \u03b2\u2212) 77 As \u2020 1172.09 4.1 0 2.40 60 Co( \u03b2\u2212) 60 Ni 1320.61 3.07 0 2.5 ? 1344.84 3.23 0 2.52 96 Ge(EC) 69 Ge + K \u2020 1355.76 3.15 0 2.52 65 Ga(EC) 65 Zn + 19 O ( \u03b2\u2212) \u2020 1368.34 3.56 0 2.53 24 Na( \u03b2\u2212) 24 Mg 1471.82 3.07 0 2.6 ? 1809.0 9.41 3.4 2.82 26 Mg 26 Na( \u03b2\u2212) 2403.35 3.11 0 3.21 ? 2749.42 5.03 0 3.43 66 Ga(EC) 66 Zn\na\n\u03c3\nI b f b\n\u03b4\nO f t O \u03b4\ns t\na p s t N\nf\nS a c r t a 3 h n > r\n5\nI o l t s k w a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/4/6322/7030902 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024 ngle: sys (138 keV , \u03c6) = f R (138 keV , \u03c6) .

Below we briefly discuss and ummarize the derived results. .1 Line candidates mong the detected 32 lines, 29 coincide by energy with known NTEGRAL/SPI instrumental lines. We note that some lines, e.g. he 511 keV line, are of \u2018mixed\u2019 origin. The flux in these lines is roduced by a sum of astrophysical and instrumental lines coinciding n energy. In order to check the possibility of an admixture of a signal rom DM decay at energies coinciding with known instrumental lines, e performed the off-GC angle analysis as described abo v e. In this nalysis, we built the flux in the discussed lines as a function of the ngle with respect to the direction of the GC. In case a line contains ome contribution from decaying DM, one would expect that its rightness would increase close to the GC. For purely instrumental ines, one can expect a behaviour independent of the off-GC angle.\nThe off-GC angle dependency for all detected lines is shown n Fig. 9 . We note that the majority of the lines (21 out of 32) emonstrate an off-GC angle dependency consistent with a constant t < 3 \u03c3 level, see Table 3 . We further note that for all three lineandidates without a clear instrumental/astrophysical counterpart, he off-GC angle profile is also consistent with a constant. This rules ut the possibility of these lines to host a significant contribution rom decaying DM.\nAmong the remaining lines that do not demonstrate consistency ith a constant off-GC angle profile, two lines (511 and 1809 keV)\nre statistically consistent with the \u2018DM decay profile\u2019 model, i.e., quation ( 15 ) with non-zero normalization a of the DM-related art of the model. This clearly indicates that the brightness of hese lines gradually decrease with off-GC angle and that these ines have a substantial part of astrophysical emission from the GC egion.\nThe 511 keV electron-positron annihilation line originating from he vicinity of the GC has been detected by GRS/SMM more than 0 yr ago (Share et al. 1990 ). The spatial profile of this line was tudied with CGRO/OSSE (Cheng et al. 1997 ; Purcell et al. 1997 ) nd later in more detail with INTEGRAL/SPI (Kn \u0308odlseder et al. 003 , 2005 ). The off-GC angle profile of the 511 keV line derived n this work is shown in Fig. 10 . We found that the profile is ell-described also with a simple Gaussian centred at \u03c6 = 0 and WHM of \u223c37 \u25e6, consistent with previous reports of Kn \u0308odlseder et al. 2005 ).\nThe 26 Al decay, 1809 keV line was the first astronomical gammaay line from radioactive decay disco v ered in our Galaxy (Mahoney t al. 1982 , 1984 ) with HEAO-3 observations. Later the distribution f this line was studied with COMPTEL/EGRET, RHESSI and ater with INTEGRAL/SPI by Prantzos & Diehl ( 1995 ), Smith 2003 ), Schanne et al.

Isern et al. 2021 ). The short half-life time time of \u223c10 6 yr f 26 Al makes this line a tracer of the recent nucleosynthesis ctivity. The line is believed to originate from environments hosting ype II superno vae, no vae, and the winds of Wolf-Rayet and\nMNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nM\nFigure 8. Complete comparison of upper limits on the mixing angle \u03b8 of the sterile neutrino decaying into two bodies, one of which is a photon. The region above each curve is excluded. The blue hatched region shows the uncertainty due to different DM profiles with highest constraints for the COM and lowest for the ISO model (see Table 1 ). The blue solid line represents constraints based on NFW-parameters of Cautun et al. ( 2020 ) for reference. Model-specific constraints for different DM profiles or parameters can be obtained by scaling the reference appropriately by ( S ON \u2212 S OFF )/( S ON, REF \u2212 S OFF, REF ) listed in Table 2 . The other constraints shown are based on XMM-Newton (Dessert, Rodd & Safdi 2020 ; Foster et al. 2021 ), INTEGRAL (called BMN08; Boyarsky et al. 2008 ), and NuSTAR (maximum of Neronov et al. 2016 ; Perez et al. 2017 ; Ng et al. 2019 ; Roach et al. 2020 ; Roach et al. 2022 ).

The results for the 26 Al line profile obtained in this work are n good agreement with previous works, see Fig. 11 . In particular, e report on observations of the increased 26 Al line flux close to he GC and Cygnus/Vela regions at \u03c6 \u223c 100 \u25e6 in agreement with he previous INTEGRAL/SPI results (see e.g. Kn \u0308odlseder et al. 004 ; Schanne et al. 2007 ; Wang et al. 2009 ; Bouchet et al. 015 ). All remaining nine detected lines with off-GC angle profile not onsistent with a constant have known INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental ine counterparts. Contrary to the lines of known astrophysical origin 511 and 1809 keV), the off-GC angle profiles for these are not onsistent either with the \u2018DM decay profile\u2019 model, equation ( 15 ). till, for eight of these lines the fit with the model (equation 15 ) esults in statistically significant impro v ement of the best-fitting \u03c72 . e argue that this could be an indication of either an underestiated level of systematic uncertainty for these lines, or a presence f the admixture of a signal that is of astrophysical/DM decay rigin.\n.2 Constraints on decaying DM parameters\nithin our analysis, we derived constraints on the level of the residual ux in ON-OFF INTEGRAL/SPI observations. Using equation ( 11 ), e converted the derived constraints to constraints on the DM ecay width DM and its lifetime \u03c4 = 1/ DM for k x = 1. The \u03c3 (statistical + systematic) constraints for the reference DM\nNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nrofile (Cautun et al. 2020 ) on the lifetime are shown in Fig. 7 nd compared to previous results from NuSTAR (Roach et al. 2022 ), NTEGRAL/SPI (Boyarsky et al. 2008 ), and COMPTEL (Essig et al. 013 ). The constraints on the sterile neutrino mixing angle sin 2 (2 \u03b8 ) re shown in Fig. 8 for a reference DM density profile and comared to constraints from different instruments. In both figures, the haded/hatched regions correspond to the full range of limits derived or DM density profiles listed in Table 1 , i.e. to systematic uncertainies connected with poor knowledge of the DM distribution in the\nW. The derived constraints on the lifetime of the decaying DM and n the mixing angle of the sterile neutrino are by up to an order of agnitude better than the previously reported constraints (Boyarsky t al. 2008 ; Laha et al. 2020 ) and by an order of magnitude worse han ones reported in Calore et al. ( 2022 ). This difference could e explained by a different (agnostic) approach to the modelling f the INTEGRAL/SPI instrumental/astrophysical background ontrary to a template-based approach of Calore et al. ( 2022 ). We rgue, ho we ver, that the approach adopted in this paper allows clear estimation of the systematic uncertainty connected to the NTEGRAL/SPI instrumental background variations, which was not iscussed in Calore et al. ( 2022 ). The impro v ement in comparison to Boyarsk y et al. ( 2008 ) ainly originates from the higher DM column density considered n this work. In particular, conserv ati ve DM profile of the MW onsidered by Boyarsky et al. ( 2008 ) resulted in S ON \u2212 S OFF 0 28 keV \u0307cm \u22122 , which is by more than an order of magnitude less\nMNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nM\nFigure 9.

On the other hand, we note that the level of systematic uncertainty erived in this work exceeds the level reported in Boyarsky et al. 2008 ) by a factor of \u223c3. This is connected to a larger data set onsidered in this work, which, different from Boyarsky et al. ( 2008 ), o v ers time periods of strongly time-variable INTEGRAL/SPI instruental background. Additional systematic uncertainty could arise rom the different regions of the sky observed by INTEGRAL/SPI vailable to Boyarsky et al. ( 2008 ). The increased number of ON-\nNRAS 520, 6322\u20136334 (2023)\nC observations [20 Ms current work versus 12 Ms for Boyarsky t al. ( 2008 )] results in a somewhat increased number of Galactic ources of astrophysical emission in the FoV of INTEGRAL/SPI and onsequently also impacts the level of systematics.\nWe argue that controlling the level of systematics is a key issue for ny type of DM searches with instrumental-background dominated nstruments. Only with the next generation of instruments like eXTP, HESEUS, AMEGO, or GECCO (Malyshev et al. 2020 ; Thorpeorgan et al. 2020 ; Coogan et al. 2021 ; Ray et al. 2021 ), this issue ay be resolved.\nTable 4.
