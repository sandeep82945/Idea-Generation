    "abstractText": "Elastomer composites with low hysteresis are of great importance for sustainable development, as they find application in billions of tires. For these composites, a filler such as silica, able to establish a chemical bond with the elastomer chains, is used, in spite of its technical drawbacks. In this work, a furnace carbon black (CB) functionalized with polar groups was used in replacement of silica, obtaining lower hysteresis. CBN326 was functionalized with 2-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)1,3-propanediol (serinol pyrrole, SP), and samples of CB/SP adducts were prepared with different SP content, ranging from four to seven parts per hundred carbon (phc). The entire process, from the synthesis of SP to the preparation of the CB/SP adduct, was characterized by a yield close to 80%. The functionalization did not alter the bulk structure of CB. Composites were prepared, based on diene rubbers\u2014poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) from Hevea Brasiliensis and poly(1,4-cis-butadiene) in a first study and synthetic poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) in a second study\u2014and were crosslinked with a sulfur-based system. A CB/silica hybrid filler system (30/35 parts) was used and the partial replacement (66% by volume) of silica with CB/SP was performed. The composites with CB/SP exhibited more efficient crosslinking, a lower Payne effect and higher dynamic rigidity, for all the SP content, with the effect of the functionalized CB consistently increasing the amount of SP. Lower hysteresis was obtained for the composites with CB/SP. A CB/SP adduct with approximately 6 phc of SP, used in place of silica, resulted in a reduction in \u2206G\u2032/G\u2032 of more than 10% and an increase in E\u2019 at 70 \u25e6C and in \u03c3300 in tensile measurements of about 35% and 30%, respectively. The results of this work increase the degrees of freedom for preparing elastomer composites with low hysteresis, allowing for the use of either silica or CB as filler, with a potentially great impact on an industrial scale.",

            "text": "Global greenhouse emissions, measured in carbon dioxide equivalents over a 100-year timescale, were 54.59 billion tons in 2021 [1]. The United Nations (UN) has recognized the importance of sustainable transport since the 1992 Earth Summit [2,3]. In fact, the energy sector contributes more than 70% to global greenhouse emissions, with road transport accounting for about 12% [4]. According to the UN\u2019s mobility report, global freight volumes and annual passenger traffic are projected to grow by 50% and 70%, respectively, compared to 2015, with 2.4 billion cars on the road. In this context, tires play a major role, with 2.7 billion units forecast to be on the market by 2025 [5,6], contributing about 20% to the global warming potential, 90% of which is derived from the use of cars. So-called rolling resistance (RR), i.e., \u201cthe energy consumed per unit distance of travel as a tire rolls under load\u201d [7\u20139] is mostly responsible for the dissipation of energy and, hence, for\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15143120 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120 2 of 18\nthe environmental impact of a tire during its use. RR is influenced by the hysteresis of an elastomeric composite, which in turn is mainly due to the so-called filler networking phenomenon, that is, the reversible interactions of the reinforcing filler particles [10\u201313]. Furnace carbon black (CB) [14\u201319] and precipitated silica [20,21] are the traditional reinforcing fillers in tire compounds: they possess a high surface area and therefore high interfacial area with the rubber matrix and are nanostructured, which means their aggregates have voids able to occlude polymer chains, thereby promoting mechanical reinforcement. Silica is the preferred filler for reducing the hysteresis of a rubber compound: the silanols on the silica surface react with so-called coupling agents, which enable compatibility with the silica and establish chemical bonds with the polymer chains [20,21], reducing if not preventing the filler networking phenomenon. In order to reduce the hysteresis of elastomeric composites for a dynamic-mechanical application such as the one in tire, the filler\u2013polymer chemical bond is a key feature, alongside the appropriate selection of materials. The preferred coupling agents are silanes containing sulfur atoms [22,23], such as bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT) [22]. Silica-based technology is well established and the use of silica in tire compounds is steadily increasing. However, silica presents remarkable drawbacks. It promotes the increase of compound viscosity, and this leads to worse processability and to a shorter storage time of the composites, which makes it necessary to change the planning of the production of the compounds as well as the procedures for storing and moving them, with a clear impact on logistics. Particular mixing equipment has to be used, which is more energy consuming and more expensive. Silica is corrosive and abrasive, and the silane causes increased adhesiveness to the metal parts of the mixing machines. Hence, the metal surfaces have to be treated with special substances, which requires a revision of maintenance procedures. Moreover, compounds based on silica suffer from a lack of electrical conductivity. All these technical problems are particularly relevant on an industrial scale. It would be highly desirable to use, as a reinforcing filler for an elastomeric composite with low hysteresis, a CB with the properties of traditional CB grades but with chemical reactivity with rubber chains. This objective can be achieved through introducing functional groups on the CB surface. Some of the authors developed a functionalization method [24\u201329] which uses biosourced molecules, is performed in the absence of solvents and catalyts and is characterized by high yield (also higher than 95%) and carbon efficiency [30,31]. A solvent (acetone) was used only to allow for the easy mixing of CB and the pyrrole compound in the lab. This method is based on pyrrole compounds, with their general chemical structure shown in Figure 1.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\nSo-called rolling resistance (RR), i.e., \u201cthe energy consumed per unit distance of travel as a tire rolls under load\u201d [7\u20139] is mostly responsible for the dissipation of energy and, hence, for the environmental impact of a tire during its use.

Some of the authors developed a functionaliz tion method [24\u201329] which uses biosourced molecules, is performed in the abse ce of solvents and catalyts and is characterized by high yield (also higher than 95%) and carbon efficiency [30,31]. A solvent (acetone) was used only to allow for the easy mixing of CB and the pyrrole compound in the lab. This method is based o pyrrole compounds, with their general chemical structure shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Pyrrole compounds. General chemical structure (a); 2-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1,3propanediol (serinol pyrrole, SP) (b).\nThe functionalization of CB [24,25], a high-surface-area graphite (HSAG) [26,27] and carbon nanotubes [28] was performed through simply mixing the carbon materials and a pyrrole compound (PyC), giving either thermal or mechanical energy. A domino reaction occurs, in which the steps are the carbocatalyzed oxidation of the pyrrole compound in the benzylic position and then the cycloaddition reaction with the carbon substrate [29].\nR\na b\nFigure 1.

A domino reaction occurs, in which the steps are the carbocatalyzed oxidation of the pyrrole compound in the benzylic position and then the cycloaddition reaction with the carbon substrate [29]. It is worth highlighting the versatility of this functionalization reaction, which allows us to attach nearly any type of R group. A large part of the research was performed with 2-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1,3-propanediol (serinol pyrrole, SP), whose chemical\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120 3 of 18\nstructure is in Figure 1b. SP was prepared from the Paal Knorr reaction of a biosourced molecule, a glycerol derivative such as 2-amino-1,3-propandiol (known as serinol), with 2,5-hexanedione, which could be prepared from dimethylfuran [32\u201335]. SP is a Janus molecule [27,36]: the pyrrole ring gives rise to a covalent bond with the carbon substrate and the serinol moiety changes the solubility parameter of the carbon allotrope [27,28] and promotes its chemical reactivity. The CB/SP adduct appears to be an ideal filler for preparing rubber composites with low dissipation of energy, avoiding or substantially reducing the use of silica. The OH groups brought by SP on the CB surface can promote the interaction of CB with silica and with the coupling agent TESPT, and hence with the elastomer chains. In this work, CB/SP was used in replacement of a major amount of silica, in elastomeric composites based on diene rubbers, with a CB/silica hybrid filler system. The objective was to at least reproduce the properties of the silica-based compound, above all the low hysteresis. For the preparation of the CB/SP adducts, CB N326 was used. According to the ASTMD1765 standard classification system for carbon blacks used in rubber products, this grade of CB has a surface area of about 80 m2/g, remarkably lower than the one of the sp2 carbon allotropes used by some of the authors for the functionalization with SP: 300 m2/g for HSAG [26] and 250 m2/g for CNT [28]. Hence, this work also had the objective to investigate the robustness of the methodology based on pyrrole compounds for the functionalization of CB. This technology appears of interest for its development to the industrial scale. A major player in the tire field has reported the use of a pyrrole compound, and in particular, of serinol pyrrole, for the industrial development [37]. The CB/SP adducts were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction. In a first study, the CB/SP adduct was used for the partial replacement of silica in a composite based on poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) from Hevea Brasiliensis (natural rubber, NR) and poly(1,4-cis-butadiene) with high 1,4-cis content. This type of composite is typically used in an important tire compound such as the sidewall. In a second study, the CB/SP adduct was analogously used in partial replacement of silica, with poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) as the only rubber. Internal tire compounds, for carcass and belt, are typically based on this type of rubber. In most cases, NR is used. However, to ensure the reproducibility of the compounds\u2019 properties, the synthetic poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) (IR) from Ziegler-Natta catalysis is sometimes used in place of NR. In this study, the choice of IR in place of NR was aimed at avoiding the interaction of the polar CB/SP with the polar groups which are present at the NR chain ends, proteins and phospholipids. The compounds were crosslinked with a sulfur-based system and were characterized by means of dynamic-mechanical tests, both in the shear and in the axial mode, and tensile measurements."

Measurements were carried out at a frequ ncy of 1.7 Hz an oscillation angle of 6.98%. Th sample, loaded at 50 \u25e6C, underwent a first str in sweep (0.2\u201325% strain) to cancel the thermo-mechanical history of th rubbe composite; it was then maintained t 50 \u25e6C for 10 in and then underwent another st ain sweep at 50 \u25e6C to measure th ynamic-mechanical properties at lo deformation of the uncured sample. A crosslinking reaction was then carried out at 170 \u25e6C for 10 min. A torque\u2013time curve was obtained. The minimum achievable torque (ML), the maximum achievable torque (MH), the time required to have a torque equal to ML + 1 (tS1) and the time required to reach 90% of the maximum torque (t90) were measured.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120 7 of 18\n2.4.4. Dynamic-Mechanical Analysis in the Shear Mode Strain Sweep Test\nThe shear dynamic-mechanical characteristics of the rubber compounds were evaluated through performing strain sweep tests in a rubber process analyzer (Monsanto R.P.A. 2000, Alpha Technologies Hudson, Ohio, USA). As reported in Section 2.4.3, the crude sample was subjected to a first strain sweep, was then held at 50 \u25e6C for ten minutes, followed by another strain sweep at 50 \u25e6C. Data from the second strain sweep were collected and are reported in the text below to discuss the behavior of uncured samples. The crosslinking was then carried out, as reported in Section 2.4.3, and the shear dynamic-mechanical properties of the cured samples were then assessed after 20 min at 50 \u25e6C using a 0.2\u201325% strain sweep at a frequency of 1 Hz. Shear storage and loss moduli (G\u2032, G\u2032\u2032), and subsequently Tan \u03b4, were measured characteristics.\n2.4.5. Dynamic-Mechanical Analysis in the Axial Mode\nThe elastomeric compound was rolled up to obtain a long cylinder. This cylinder was then cut into smaller cylinders and vulcanized (at 170 \u25e6C for 10 min) to produce cylindrical test pieces with dimensions of 25 mm in length and 12 mm in diameter. An Instron dynamic device (Instron, Buckinghamshire, UK) in traction\u2013compression mode was employed to perform dynamic mechanical measurements and was maintained at the predetermined temperatures (10, 23 and 70 \u25e6C) throughout the entire experiment. The cylinder was preloaded to a 25% longitudinal deformation with respect to the original length. The compression was subjected to a dynamic sinusoidal strain in compression with an amplitude of around 3.5% regarding the length under pre-load, at a frequency of 100 Hz. This generated the values of dynamic storage modulus (E\u2032) and loss modulus (E\u2032\u2032), as well as loss factor (tan \u03b4), calculated as the ratio between E\u2032\u2032 and E\u2032.\n2.4.6. Tensile Test\nStandard dumbbells made from 10 cm by 10 cm by 1 mm vulcanized compound plates were used to perform tensile tests at room temperature with a Zwick Roell Z010 and an optical extensometer. Measurements were performed at 1 mm/min. Stresses at different elongations (respectively \u03c350, \u03c3100, \u03c3300), stress at break (\u03c3B), elongation at break (\u03b5B) and the energy required to break were measured according to Standard ISO [38].\n2.4.7. Electrical Resistance\nKeysight Technologies 34,450 A 5 12 Digital Multimeter (Keysight Technologies SRL, Milan, Italy) was used to measure the electrical resistance of rubber composites. The measurements were taken with a hand-applied four-point probe (FPP) with four distinct gold-coated points. (Each tip has an area of 18 mm2). Only two of the FPP\u2019s points were used as crocodile clips for volumetric measurement. The samples are 3.5 cm diameter cured rubber compound disks with a thickness of 3 mm. For each composite, five measurements were taken.\n2.4.8. Headspace Analyses\nHeadspace analyses were carried out using an Agilent HS-Autosampler 7697A, an Agilent GC 6890 N and an Agilent MS 5975C."

Procedure for the preparation of the CB/SP adduct.\nDetails are in the experimental section. In brief, CB and SP were mixed in acetone, and sonication was then performed to prepare a homogeneous dispersion. After the removal of the solvent, the temperature was increased, either to 120 \u00b0C or to 150 \u00b0C, and the reaction was carried out for 4 h. The adducts were then washed with acetone, to completely remove the unreacted SP. In this procedure, already used for preparing adducts with HSAG [27] and CNT [28], a solvent such as acetone was used, to allow for easy mixing at the lab scale. For the scale-up of the reaction, an organic solvent for the preparation of the physical mixture could be avoided, for example, through using an apparatus such as a spray dryer [40]. Adducts with different amounts of SP were prepared through adopting different reaction temperatures and different amounts of SP in the reaction mixture. When the reaction was performed at 150 \u00b0C, 10 parts of SP per hundred parts of CB (phc) was used. In the case of the reaction carried out at 120 \u00b0C, 5 and 10 phc of SP were used. The amount of SP in the adducts was estimated by means of TGA analysis. Data of mass losses are in Table 3. The thermographs are in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Material. Three main steps can be seen in the decomposition profile: at a temperature below 150 \u00b0C, between 150 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C and above 900 \u00b0C. Low-molar-mass substances, such as adsorbed water or the acetone used for washing, could be responsible for the mass loss at T < 150 \u00b0C. The decomposition of PyC and the alkenylic defects of CB can account for the mass loss between 150 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C.

ML is an index of the viscosity of the composite and, for composites with the same rubber matrix and loaded with the same volume of reinforcing fillers, is essentially due to the extent of the filler network, which appears, thus, to be similar in the two composites. A remarkably higher MH was obtained with CB/SP. The values of MH are due to the extent of both the crosslinking network and the filler network. In fact, the maximum amplitude explored through the shear test is not enough to completely disrupt the filler network. Values of induction and optimum times of vulcanization are similar for the two composites, whereas a remarkably higher curing rate was obtained for the composite with CB/SP. In the presence of similar ML, and taking also in consideration that the two composites contained the same amount of sulfur atoms, the higher value of MH for the composite with CB/SP could be due to a more efficient vulcanization, with the formation of a higher crosslinking network density and/or shorter sulfur bridges. The higher MH and curing rate could be due to the presence of sp3 nitrogen atoms on the CB surface. This hypothesis is proposed assuming that TESPT plays its role for the functionalization of the filler(s) rather than as sulfur donor. The silanization of\nFigure 5.

This hypothesis is pro ose ass i g that S lays its role for the functionalization of the filler(s) rather than as sulfur donor. The silanization of CB/SP with a silane is discussed below in the text. However, further studies are needed to clarify this point. Dynamic-mechanical properties were determined in the shear mode through performing strain sweep experiments in the range from 0.2% to 25%, as described in the experimental section. Data are in Table 4, and curves of G\u2032 and tan delta are in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Material.\nWith respect to the reference composite, CB/SP led to lower values of \u2206G\u2032 and \u2206G\u2032/G\u2032\u03b3min, whereas the G\u2032\u2032max and the Tan \u03b4max are in line. The replacement of sil-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120 11 of 18\nica with CB/SP appears to reduce the Payne effect [42\u201345] and hence reduce the filler networking phenomenon. Dynamic-mechanical properties were also determined in the axial mode through applying sinusoidal stress as described in the experimental section. Data of E\u2032, E\u2032\u2032 and Tan delta, measured at 10 \u25e6C, 23 \u25e6C and 70 \u25e6C, are in Table 5, and the dependence of E\u2032 and Tan delta on temperature are in Figure 6, Figure 6a and Figure 6b, respectively.\nTable 5.

Strain sweep experiments in the shear mode were carried out, as described in the experimental section, similar to the first study.

The curves of G\u2032 for the uncured samples with CB/SP in Figure 8a overlap and lie below the curve of the reference silica sample, throughout the range of strain amplitudes. The lower values of \u0394G\u2032/G\u20320.2% for the CB/SP samples suggest that the replacement of silica with the functionalized CB leads to a lower Payne effect [41\u201344]. The dependence of G\u2019 on the strain amplitude for cured CB/SP-4 and CB/SP-5 samples appears to be different, as shown in Figure 8b. Higher values of G\u2032 were obtained with CB/SP-5, and a crossover of the curves due to the CB/SP5 and the reference silica samples can be observed: higher values of G\u2019 at high strain amplitude were obtained with the CB/SP-5 sample. The replacement of silica with CB/SP leads to the reduction of \u0394G\u2032 and \u0394G\u2032/G\u2032, and, hence, of the Payne Effect, as well as to the reduction of Tan delta.

Although it is challenging to compare data from different studies, based on different rubber matrices, the numbers in Tables 4 and S5 allow for the calculation of a percentage reduction in \u0394G\u2032/G\u2032, of approximatively 5, 8 and 12% for composites with CB-4, CB-5 and CB-6, respectively, compared to the reference composites without CB/SP.

On the Reactivity of CB/SP The results discussed above show that CB/SP can replace silica in elastomeric composites, resulting in higher dynamic rigidity, lower hysteresis and higher stresses at every elongation in tensile tests. Moreover, it is worth highlighting the appreciable differences among composites containing CB/SP adducts with a subtle difference of SP content. These findings appear to support the working hypothesis reported in the Introduction: CB functionalized with SP acts as a polar filler and is able to interact with both silica and the coupling agent TESPT. The results of the silanization study discussed in the previous paragraph confirm the ability of CB/SP to react with sulfur-based silane. In a recent paper [46], some of the authors demonstrated the ability of serinol pyrrole to react with silica. SP was used as coupling agent of silica in place of TESPT. The reactivity with silica was due to the serinol moiety, which is on CB\u2019s surface in the CB/SP adduct. Hence, it can be concluded\nFigure 11.

Moreover, it is worth highlighting the appreciable differences among composites containing CB/SP adducts with a subtle difference of SP content. These findings appear to support the working hypothesis reported in the Introduction: CB functionalized with SP acts as a polar filler and is able to interact with both silica and the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3120 16 of 18\ncoupling agent TESPT. The results of the silanization study discussed in the previous paragraph confirm the ability of CB/SP to react with sulfur-based silane. In a recent paper [46], some of the authors demonstrated the ability of serinol pyrrole to react with silica. SP was used as coupling agent of silica in place of TESPT. The reactivity with silica was due to the serinol moiety, which is on CB\u2019s surface in the CB/SP adduct. Hence, it can be concluded that the OH on the CB surface can enhance the reactivity of CB with polymer chains, mediated either by silica or by the sulfur-based silane."

            "heading": "4. Conclusions",
            "text": "This work demonstrates that silica is not the sole nanostructured reinforcing filler for elastomer composites with low hysteresis. In fact, a furnace carbon black functionalized with SP was used in rubber composites based on diene elastomers and a CB/silica hybrid filler system, replacing 66% of silica by volume, thus obtaining more efficient vulcanization, a lower Payne Effect, higher dynamic rigidity, low hysteresis and increased stresses in tensile measurements. Thus, a furnace CB, even with relatively low surface area (80 m2/g), when functionalized with a polar modifier such as serinol pyrrole, can replace a significant portion of silica, leading to composites with even lower hysteresis. The functionalization of CB with SP is achieved through a simple mixing and heating process, yielding a high carbon efficiency without the need for catalysts and, potentially, for solvents. Traditional formulation and melt blending can be applied. The chemical modification of CB appears to play a major role. The OH groups facilitate interaction with silica and with silane TESPT and, thus, with the polymer chains. The sp3 nitrogen atom could be responsible for the efficient sulfur-based crosslinking and the high dynamic rigidity. The lower Payne effect and the lower hysteresis, compared to the silica-based composite, could be attributed to the synergy between chemical reactivity and the lower surface area of CB. All the procedures here described can be easily scaled up to the industrial level. As mentioned in the introduction, a major player in the tire industry is currently undertaking this work. This research highlights the potential of carbon fillers with polar groups in the development of elastomer composites with low environmental impact. Furnace CB is oil based and is not considered a sustainable material. CB from different sources are under development: bio char from renewable sources and circular char from end-of-life polymer products. These chars typically have low surface area and are not nanostructured. However, this work shows that these drawbacks could be overcome through chemical reactivity. Functionalization with pyrrole compounds appears to pave the way for the development of new, more sustainable generations of carbon materials.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15143120/s1.
