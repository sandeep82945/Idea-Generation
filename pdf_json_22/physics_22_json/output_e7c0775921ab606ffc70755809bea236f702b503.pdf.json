One of the important characteristics of molecular spintronic devices is that they are able to generate a large spin-lter efficiency (SFE) by adopting a magnetic molecule sandwiched between the two nonmagnetic electrodes.6\u20138 The SFE in FePc with gold electrodes\ndemy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China.\nChinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing\naterials and Devices, School of Materials\nity of Science and Technology, Nanjing du.cn\n3\ncan be prominently affected by tuning carbon chains with different connection positions.9 A study of matching styles between CuPc and the electrode indicated that a symmetrical matching interaction will enhance electron transport.10 Injecting holes into the molecular orbitals or resonance electrons of the SnPc molecule can realize the conversion between spin-up ltering and spin-down ltering.11,12 Single-molecule magnets can be connected to gold electrodes through sulfur atoms13,14 and connected to carbon nanotube electrodes or graphene nanoribbon electrodes through carbon atoms.15,16 Different magnetic structures cause a resistance change, which could be quantitatively described by theMR ratio.17 MR ratios of 27% and 2 107% were found in a Ni-bezenedithiol-Ni molecular junction18 and ZGNR-based molecular junctions,19 respectively. The spin-dependent hybridization of the electrode and molecular orbitals could cause a large MR.5 Perfect SFE and GMR effects were observed in an MnPc molecular device.17 Bipolar SFE, NDR and spin rectifying effect were found in an all-carbon multifunctional spintronic device.20 Metal (Co, Cr, Fe and Mo)-\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

We found that bilayer CuPc molecular devices show ultrahigh spin lter efficiency at zero bias when the distances between the buffer layer and CuPcmolecule are certain values, which exceed 99.99996% and 97.91% for PC and APC, respectively. Meanwhile, we observed that the SFE decreases and the spin-polarized current shows an increasing trend with a bias for the PC. Interestingly, the spin polarization of the bilayer CuPc molecular device could be reversed when the distance was a certain value and the MR could also be reserved by applying a specic bias voltage. Particularly, there are reserved SFEs for PC and APC when the distances are certain values and the reserved SFEs exceed 26.03175% and 99.93448%, respectively. The MR ratio exceeds 5.21 107% (99.9996%). When the distances are at certain values, there are pure spin Seebeck coefficients and pure charge Seebeck coefficients at certain temperatures."

The energy cutoff is set to 150 Rydberg, the k-point grid is chosen to be 100 1 1 and the electrode temperature is set to 300 K. We introduced a vacuum layer of about 15 A\u030a in the y and z directions to eliminate interaction between GNRs in neighboring cells and the edge atoms, both electrodes and the central region are saturated with hydrogen atoms to remove dangling bonds.22,27 The exchange\u2013correlation function is described by the local density approximation proposed by Perdew and Zunger. We dened the distance as zero when the edge atoms of the buffer layer linked with the lead are at the central position of the atoms at the adjacent edge of the bilayer CuPc molecules, as shown in Fig. 1. When the buffer layer is kept away from the two CuPc molecules, the distance is positive; otherwise, it is negative.

The transmission spectrum for the PC is generally larger than the one for the APC. At the Fermi level, the SD transmission in the PC is clearly higher than the SU transmission and the transmission in the APC. As a whole, the PDOS in the PC is greater than the one in the APC.\nThe above results drove us to investigate the effect of bias voltage on the spin ltering efficiency.

As shown in Fig. 8(a\u2013d), the transmission is mainly controlled by the PDOS of the p orbital. The transmission peaks essentially coincide with the corresponding PDOS peaks, and most other PDOS peaks have no distribution to the transmission peaks.\nFig. 9 shows the pure spin Seebeck coefficient (SC \u00bc 0) and charge Seebeck coefficient (SS \u00bc 0) of the CuPc molecular device in the PC and APC versus the distance. It can be seen that when the distance is greater than about 0.5 A\u030a, there is only the pure charge Seebeck coefficient in the PC and APC, that is, there is a pure charge ow at the corresponding temperature difference. As the distance increases, the pure charge Seebeck coefficient rst increases and then decreases in the PC, while the pure charge Seebeck coefficient in APC increases, that is, the corresponding pure charge ow increases. However, when the distance is about 0.859 A\u030a, the pure SS and SC are zero, that is, there are no pure SS and SC at the corresponding temperature. When the distance is negative, in different regions, there are pure spin Seebeck coefficients and pure charge Seebeck coefficients for the PC and APC, respectively, that is, there are pure spin current and pure charge current. When the distance is around 0.5 A\u030a, there is a positive pure spin Seebeck coefficient for the PC and APC, and there is a negative pure charge Seebeck coefficient for the APC. When the distance is near 1 A\u030a, there is a large negative pure charge Seebeck coefficient; when the distance is less than about 1.46 A\u030a, there is a positive pure spin Seebeck coefficient for the PC and APC, and it increases with decreasing distance, that is, there is a pure spin current increasing with decreasing distance. As shown in Fig. 10(b) and (d), when the distances are about 0.9958 A\u030a (d2) and 1.8388 A\u030a (d3), there are three pure SC and two pure SS at different temperatures in the APC, respectively, which means that there are three and two\n3392 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3386\u20133393\ndifferent temperature differences to produce pure charge current and pure spin current, respectively. Fig. 10(a) shows that the SU and SD Seebeck coefficients rst decrease and then increase with the temperature; the SD Seebeck coefficient rst decreases and then increases with the temperature; however, the SU Seebeck coefficient rst increases, then decreases, then increases and then decreases with temperature."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have investigated the spin-dependent conductance, current, SFE and MR ratio of a bilayer CuPc molecular device with different buffer layer-molecule distances using DFT-NEGF. The results show that the greatest spin lter efficiency of the bilayer CuPc molecular device at zero bias exceeds 99.99996% in the parallel spin conguration and 97.91% in the anti-parallel spin conguration. Particularly, there are reserved SFEs for the PC and APC when the distances are certain values, and the reserved SFEs exceed 26.03175% and 99.93448%, respectively. For the PC and APC, there is a giant magnetoresistance effect, and the MR ratio exceeds 5.21 107% (99.9996%). Moreover, the MR is reserved when the bias voltage is at certain values. With an applied bias, a negative differential resistance effect was observed for the distance at certain values, such as d \u00bc 0 and 1.06 A\u030a. When the distances are certain values, there are pure spin Seebeck coefficients and pure charge Seebeck coefficients at certain temperatures, which means that the corresponding temperature differences could produce pure spin current and pure charge current. Our results provide a promising approach for designing high-performance spintronic and spin thermoelectric molecular devices.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
