    "abstractText": "Background: The conversational artificial-intelligence (AI) technology ChatGPT has become one of the most widely used natural language processing tools. With thousands of published papers demonstrating its applications across various industries and fields, ChatGPT has sparked significant interest in the research community. Reviews of primary data have also begun to emerge. An overview of the available evidence from multiple reviews and studies could provide further insights, minimize redundancy, and identify areas where further research is needed. Objective: To evaluate the existing reviews and literature related to ChatGPT's applications and its potential impact on different fields by conducting a systematic review of reviews and bibliometric analysis of primary literature. Information sources: PubMed, EuropePMC, Dimensions AI, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Google Scholar were searched using ChatGPT-related keywords from November 2022 to the end of April 2023. Eligibility criteria: Studies including secondary data (such as systematic reviews, meta-analyses and bibliometric analyses) related to the application of ChatGPT. Articles published in all languages were considered. Methods: Reporting was performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Analysis of study findings was conducted using the thematic synthesis approach. The risk of bias was addressed by applying the PRISMA and AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) tools. Results: A total of 305 unique records with potential relevance to the review were identified from a pool of over 2,000 original articles. After a multi-step screening process, we selected 11 reviews, including 9 specifically focused on ChatGPT (encompassing 80 to 385 unique records identified and 10 to 60 records subjected to systematic analysis, in addition to 186 records analyzed through bibliometric methods), along with 2 reviews on broader AI topics that also discussed ChatGPT. Additionally, we conducted bibliometric analysis on 1,357 ChatGPT papers out of a total of 1,854,007 records published from December 2022 to April 2023. Conclusions: While AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, further interdisciplinary research, customized integrations, and ethical innovation are necessary to address existing concerns and ensure its responsible use.

The basis for the new AI technology called \"ChatGPT\" is an advanced version of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture, which has been found to possess remarkable emergent skills. These skills include the ability to follow directions, which enables the production of complex and tailored behavior for various applications. As a result, ChatGPT is considered superior to its predecessors in terms of its capabilities. ChatGPT has generated mixed responses, reflecting the history of controversy regarding the benefits vs. risks of AI. Less than 6 months since its launch, over two thousand papers have been published or posted on preprint servers. Multiple reviews have already been conducted to explore the future perspectives of ChatGPT, identify potential limitations and concerns, and investigate its utility in various domains. These reviews highlight the potential limitations and concerns associated with the application of ChatGPT in various fields. Furthermore, they present the growing trend of using ChatGPT in various domains, including education, health, finance, and academic writing."

The selected reviews were critically appraised, and data were extracted and synthesized using thematic analysis. To retrieve articles published between November 2022 and 30 April 2023, several repositories were searched for relevant articles and reviews about ChatGPT. The databases included Medrxiv, Biorxiv, EuropePMC, Pubmed, Dimensions AI, and Google Scholar. In arXiv, MedrXiv and BiorXiv, the search keyword used was \"ChatGPT\" since \"Chat GPT\" returned too many irrelevant results. In EuropePMC, the search query used was (chatgpt OR \"Chat GPT\"). For Pubmed, the search query used was ChatGPT OR (Chat GPT). The filters used for review extraction in Pubmed were Meta-Analysis, Review, and Systematic Review. For Dimensions AI, the search was conducted for articles published in the years 2022 and 2023 and the search query used was ChatGPT OR (Chat GPT) in Title and Abstract. In Google Scholar, the search keyword used was ChatGPT and the review filter was used to extract potential review articles. Since ArXiv, MedrXiv, BiorXiv, and Dimensions AI did not have review filters, initial screening of titles was done programmatically by looking at \"review,\" \"metaanalysis,\" and bibliometric keywords.

Thematic synthesis approach was used to combine key findings in the papers reviewed and identified key themes to explore in the intervention studies Data were extracted by the human reviewer in standardized summary tables and were also categorized by ChatGPT. Any disagreements were re-reviewed. Firstly, we carefully analyzed a sample of the studies we were reviewing, to understand their context and meaning. Then, we used this understanding to analyze the rest of the studies. The human reviewer coded all the data. ChatGPT was then asked to perform the same task. If there were any disagreements, the human reviewer reviewed the data again and reformulated the prompts until an agreement was reached. In the second phase, we identified common themes and topics in the studies, and grouped the codes into descriptive themes. We organized these themes into a table, which helped us understand the similarities and differences between the individual studies. In the third phase, we identified interpretive or analytical themes based on the insights we gained from the previous phases. In addition to the review of reviews, we also conducted a bibliometric analysis of primary literature related to ChatGPT. This analysis involved identifying and analyzing the citation patterns, authorship, and publication trends in the primary literature. In particular, we compared the number of ChatGPT articles published in different Fields of Research to the total number of articles published in the same Fields of Research during the same time period from the Dimensions database."

For Evaluation, a comparably high number of abstracts articulate mixed sentiments towards the social impact. Finally, in the Ethics category, ChatGPT is mostly seen as a threat.\n[10] AI in Healthcare and Medicine Slightly negative. While the progress of fundamental AI methods provides great opportunities for medical AI, there is a severe concern about the reliability, safety, and factuality of generated content by medical AI methods, and significant challenges still exist in investigating the factuality problem in medical AI [11] LLMs in education\nPositive. LLMs-based innovations have already shown high performance on several relatively simple classification tasks that could potentially be deployed to automatically generate meaningful insights that could be useful to teachers and institutions, such as navigating through numerous student feedback and course review.\nTwo months after the launch of ChatGPT, the first review of its publications was posted to arXiv [9]. The review provided a sentiment analysis of over 300,000\ntweets and an analysis of ChatGPT's impact based on 152 scientific papers published at that time. The analysis found that the average sentiment of the tweets was slightly more positive than neutral, with the most positive sentiment observed for business, entrepreneurship, science, and technology. The majority of papers analyzed reported a robust performance of ChatGPT, highlighting its potential to have a positive social impact. This sentiment was frequently described as an opportunity in Semantic Scholar Publications. However, the sentiment was more balanced in Arxiv, with an equal number of preprints identifying ChatGPT as an opportunity and a threat. ChatGPT determined sentiment of the conclusion of this paper to be neutral, but changed it to \u201cslightly positive\u201d after reading results and discussions, aligning with the human author\u2019s annotation."

The interest in ChatGPT's potential for writing systematic reviews [13-17] is not surprising given the challenges and time commitment involved in conducting them. Review of Pubmed articles from December 2022 to March 2023 [8] identified eight themes including (1) medical writing, (2) medical education, (3) diagnostic decision-making, (4) public health, (5) scientific research, (6) ethical considerations of ChatGPT use, (7) ChatGPT's potential to automate medical tasks, and (8) criticism of accuracy and bias. The criticism of the limitations of ChatGPT in solving mathematical problems and developing content requiring critical thinking was most frequently found in non-academic environments [6]. One of the papers examined in this study [7] concentrates on the potential use of ChatGPT in supply chains. The author decided against using the term \"review\" in the title because there were no other articles that specifically focused on this topic in the research databases. Instead, the author analyzed articles related to the logistics industry, retail, and other subjects that involved complex operations similar to those found in supply chains. Based on this analysis, the author concluded that ChatGPT has the potential to streamline supply chain operations by reducing waste and inefficiencies. One of the significant contributions of the reviews was offering suggestions to address the limitations of ChatGPT. These suggestions included methods for injecting more knowledge effectively, developing reliable automatic evaluation metrics, and employing reinforcement learning with human feedback [10]. Additionally, proposed solutions involved implementing new regulations and incorporating improvements in the underlying language model through NLP innovations [3]. Based on their findings, review focusing on education [11] proposed three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with\nthe latest state-of-the-art models, embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human-centered approach throughout the developmental process. Although the majority of papers written on ChatGPT and getting most attention was from the United States and the United Kingdom [4,6], The 11 papers reviewed in this study were written by authors from 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Jordan, Malaysia, Romania, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Authorship was almost uniformly distributed among these countries, with the highest number of affiliations from Germany and the United States."

            "text": "The principal finding of this systematic review of reviews on ChatGPT is that it has the potential to revolutionize various fields, but its use should be embraced with caution due to potential limitations and challenges associated with its use. While there has been a substantial amount of published literature on ChatGPT, many papers were editorials, letters, notes or short communications not backed by adequate data, as noted in [1,2,3,12]. The abundance of low-quality repeated content is concerning, raising the question that current practice of science should be reformed. To make ChatGPT more effective in different domains, future efforts should be spent on improving the quality of training datasets, developing customized integrations, and domain-specific research. Further interdisciplinary research is needed to investigate the effectiveness and ethical implications of using ChatGPT across different disciplines, to evaluate its factual correctness using automatic evaluation methods, and to investigate its impact on society beyond sentiment and emotion."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "Despite its contributions, this study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the rapid pace at which articles are published in this field is a concern that was observed in this review of reviews. The included reviews and primary publications are predominantly based on GPT-3.5 series, and with the recent release of GPT-4 and integrations like Wolfram plugin, the presented findings may not represent the current state of the field.\nSecondly, the heterogeneity of the included reviews in terms of their focus, scope, methodology, and quality may compromise the generalizability of the results. While some reviews focus on specific applications of ChatGPT, others provide a broader overview of the technology and its potential uses. Additionally, the quality of the included reviews varies, with some reviews having higher risk of bias or limited scope. Thirdly, the inclusion of preprints that have not undergone peer review may affect the reliability and accuracy of the results. Fourthly, this systematic review was conducted by a single author, which may limit the interpretability of the results. Lastly, the rapid growth of literature on ChatGPT is another limitation. As this technology is still in its early stages, many studies have been conducted over a short period of time. This may lead to a lack of long-term data and a limited understanding of the technology's potential applications and limitations."

            "heading": "Conclusions",
            "text": "While ChatGPT is one of the most emergent and promising technologies, many questions still remain. It is an enabler and a game-changer, but there exist privacy and ethical concerns, possibility of bias, potential legal liabilities, and concerns about validity. To ensure transparency, integrity, and scientific rigor, we need to optimize collaborative intelligence and continued training of LLMs. In summary, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize different fields, but its use should be embraced with caution due to potential limitations and challenges associated with its use. More interdisciplinary research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness and ethical implications and to investigate its impact on society. We hope that this systematic review of reviews will contribute to the advancement of research on ChatGPT and guide future directions in this field."
