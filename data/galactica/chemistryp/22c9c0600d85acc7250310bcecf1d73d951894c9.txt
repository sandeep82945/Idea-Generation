Monascus red pigments (MRPs), which are a kind of natural colorant produced by Monascus spp., are widely used in the food and health supplements industry but are not very stable during processing and storage. Thus, MRPs were embedded into liposome membranes using a thin-film ultrasonic method to improve stability in this study. Monascus red pigments liposomes (MRPL) exhibited spherical unilamellar vesicles (UV) with particle size, polydispersity indexes (PDI), and zeta potential of 20–200 nm, 0.362 ± 0.023, and −42.37 ± 0.21 mV, respectively. pH, thermal, light, metal ion, storage, and in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion stability revealed that, compared with free MRPs, liposomes embedding significantly enhanced the stability of MRPs when exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, anticancer assay suggested that MRPL exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on MKN-28 cells by damaging the integrity of cells, with the IC50 value at 0.57 mg/mL. Overall, MRPLs possess stronger stability in external environment and in vitro simulated digestion with greater anticancer activity, indicating that MRPLs have the potential for promising application in the functional foods and pharmaceutical industries. 1. conclusions Liposomes, as a promising carrier, have a potential application in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. In this study, MRPL that was prepared by thin-film ultrasonic method was presented as spherical UV. The particle size, PDI, and zeta potential of MRPL contributed to better stability in adverse environmental conditions and simulated a gastrointestinal environment in vitro. This study provides information about the cytotoxicity of MRPL to some cancer cells, such as MKN-28 and HepG-2cells.
