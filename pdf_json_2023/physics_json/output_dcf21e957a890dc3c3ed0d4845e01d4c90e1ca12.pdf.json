    "abstractText": "The relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation is well known, and exogenous antioxidants, primarily phytochemical natural products, may assist the body\u2019s endogenous defense systems in preventing diseases due to excessive inflammation. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant properties of ethnomedicines from Peru that exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by measuring the superoxide scavenging activity of ethanol extracts of Maytenus octogona aerial parts using hydrodynamic voltammetry at a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). The chemical compositions of these extracts are known and the interactions of three methide-quinone compounds found in Maytenus octogona with caspase-1 were analyzed using computational docking studies. Caspase-1 is a critical enzyme triggered during the activation of the inflammasome and its actions are associated with excessive release of cytokines. The most important amino acid involved in active site caspase-1 inhibition is Arg341 and, through docking calculations, we see that this amino acid is stabilized by interactions with the three potential methide-quinone Maytenus octogona inhibitors, hydroxytingenone, tingenone, and pristimerin. These findings were also confirmed after more rigorous molecular dynamics calculations. It is worth noting that, in these three compounds, the methide-quinone carbonyl oxygen is the preferred hydrogen bond acceptor site, although tingenone\u2019s other carbonyl group also shows a similar binding energy preference. The results of these calculations and cyclovoltammetry studies support the effectiveness and use of anti-inflammatory ethnopharmacological ethanol extract of Maytenus octogona (L\u2019H\u00e9ritier) DC.",

            "text": "Caspases are a highly conserved family of cysteine protease enzymes that may induce apoptosis and inflammation [1]. Caspase-1 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response by cleaving proteins after triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). During a viral attack, the immune system reacts strongly to this invasion, sometimes overproducing cytokines\u2014a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. Events associated with the over-activation of the immune response have been connected to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [2,3]. For instance, high levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were detected in the lung parenchyma of COVID-19 patients [4]. Moreover, increased levels of IL-18 are observed with increased mortality in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [5]. Inhibition of caspase-1 and the inflammasome pathway may provide an opportunity to suppress the heightened immune response and offer an alternative anti-COVID-19 therapy [6]. Activation of the inflammasome is a crucial function mediated by the innate immune system [3], Figure S1. Initiation is necessary in cases of cellular or molecular damage or, on\nInt. J. Mol.

Since inflammation is associated with many human diseases, anomalous activation can result in uncontrolled responses responsible for many pathogenic states besides the recent COVID-19 pandemic described earlier. The initial step of inflammasome activation involves the binding of exogenous ligands, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage/dangerassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs), to a pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Several families of PRRs exist, including the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeatcontaining proteins (NLRs, also known as NOD-like receptors). PRR binding stimulates a cascade that produces pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 in an NFK\u03b2-dependent manner [7], with the relevant NLR oligomerizing becoming a caspase-1-activating scaffold. Active caspase-1 amplifies the inflammasome signal by cleaving the proinflammatory IL-1 family of cytokines into their bioactive forms, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, and causes pyroptosis, a type of inflammatory cell death [8,9]. A second signal, from various origins, involves releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that stimulate inflammasome assembly, leading to the activation of caspase-1 and the subsequent processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into IL-1\u03b2 and pyroptosis [3]. In some cases, with excessive amounts of cytokines being produced, diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and COVID-19 infection can result. Of late, several known anti-inflammatory medicinal compounds are being reevaluated to counteract the body\u2019s inflammatory response to COVID-19 virus infection. Antioxidants that suppress ROS production and caspase-1 activation may help diminish the inflammasome response and are promising for the development of a novel therapy. Details of caspase-1 role in inflammation have been described [6], including a recent review [10]. Recently, to analyze the inhibition of caspase-1 by anti-inflammatory drugs, our group used computational methods and measured the antioxidant activity towards the damaging superoxide radical using the RRDE cyclovoltammetry method that was developed in our laboratory [11]. Previously, we associated the anti-COVID-19 biological activity of celastrol, a natural product abundant in flowering plants of the genus Maytenus and the family Celastraceae, with its inhibition of the COVID-19 main protease and its scavenging of superoxide [12]. The roots, bark, and leaves of Maytenus plants, spread in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, are a rich source of widely used triterpenoids in ethnopharmacology and traditional medicines as anti-tumor, anti-asthmatic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiulcer agents [13,14]. These plants are common in Peru, a country that has a rich flora that provides many useful bioactive compounds [15]. Indigenous populations use these plants for their anti-inflammatory properties. In particular, the high sub Andean region of the Amazonian river basin (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia) is home to a Maytenus species named chuchuasha (or chuchuaso), whose alcoholic root bark extracts are used in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation. Because a relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation is known, exogenous antioxidants may provide a potential protective effect by assisting the body\u2019s defense systems in preventing diseases due to excessive inflammation. Phenoldienones such as tingenone and 2-hydroxytingenone are present in the plant, and the biological activities of these compounds are in agreement with those observed when using the plant extracts in traditional health practices [16]. Following our interest in investigating the medicinal properties of the Maytenus genus [17\u201320], in this study, we analyzed the antioxidant properties of ethanol extracts from the leaves and stems of Maytenus octogona plants. We also focused on three components related to celastrol from these plants\u2014tingenone, hydroxytingenone, and pristimerin\u2014and studied their interactions with caspase-1 by performing docking studies to analyze their potential inhibitory effects. Figure 1 shows the studied molecules. The scavenging of superoxide by Maytenus octogona ethanol extracts was also described in this study.

I the present study, Cys285 shows no interaction with ti genone at docking, whereas hydr xyting none and pristimerin do show such an interaction, although these are not confirmed after more rigorous molecular dynamics calculations. Here, Arg341 is the more involved amino acid at the caspase-1 active site as it is stabilized by the three potential inhibitors, hydroxytingenone, tingenone, and pristimerin. This interaction is also present after dynamics. In the three natural products, we see the methide-quinone carbonyl group to be the preferred acceptor involved in hydroxytingenone, tingenone, and pristimerin hydrogen bonding interactions, agreeing with our previous findings [11]; however, the other carbonyl in tingenone shows a similar preference. Moreover, the interactions of our three celastrol derivatives docked at the active site of caspase-1 involve amino acids also engaged by the inhibitor VX-765 in the crystal structure, suggesting a closely related mechanism of inhibition. This includes hydrogen bonds for all three analyzed ligands with Arg341; cation-\u03c0 interaction with Arg383, established with an aromatic ring of tingenone, and hydrogen bond interaction with O(Ser339) for hydroxytingenone and pristimerin.\nInt.

Thus, analyzing the antioxidant capability of the plant extracts may provide an explanation for their medicinal use. In our laboratory, we developed an electrochemical method for the direct and quantitative analysis of scavenging superoxide [24]. Figure 11 shows a collage of the voltammograms associated with such an experiment for sample MORUnica (stem extract). The bottom part of the figure shows the amount of superoxide generated after reduction of bubbled O2 in the electrochemical cell (reaction (1), see Section 3.3); this is detected at the disk electrode. The top part of the figure shows superoxide detected at the ring electrode. The first experiment is a blank indicated as a 0 \u00b5L line; the last one shows the minimum amount of detected superoxide, for aliquot 510 \u00b5L. Each added aliquot decreases the current intensity detected at the ring electrode, and this is due to superoxide consumed by the antioxidant components of the extracts. For each voltammogram, the ratio ring current/disk current is defined as the efficiency. The physical interpretation is also associated with the time the generated superoxide (at the disk) takes to reach the ring and be oxidized. In Figure 12, the efficiency of all added aliquots is included, i.e., the collection efficiency is shown at the y axis, while the x axis shows the volume of added aliquot; ultimately, the slope of the line is associated with the antioxidant capability of scavenging.

For the experiment, a solution of 0.1 M TBAB electrolyte in anhydrous DMSO (99.9% purity) was bubbled for 5 min with a dry O2/N2 (35%/65%) gas mixture to establish the dissolved oxygen level in the electrochemical cell of 50 mL. The Au/Au disc electrode was then rotated at 1000 rpm, and potential sweep was applied to the disk from 0.2 V to \u22121.2 V and then back to 0.2 V while the ring was held constant at 0.0 V; the disk voltage sweep rate was set to 25 mV/s. The molecular oxygen reduction peak (reaction 1) was observed around \u22120.6 V at the disk electrode; the oxidation current (reaction 2) occurred at the ring electrode.

Next, an antioxidant aliquot was added, the solution bubbled with the gas mixture for 5 min, the voltammogram was rerecorded, and was efficiently obtained. In this way, the rate at which increasing concentrations of antioxidant scavenge the generated superoxide radicals during the electrochemical reaction was determined as each additional antioxidant aliquot was added.

Ultimately, the slope of the overall decrease in efficiency with the addition of antioxidant serves as a quantitative measure of the antioxidant activity of each sample. Any decrease in the collection efficiency was expected to be due to the amount of superoxide removed by the antioxidant. This method has been developed in our lab [24].

            "text": "Since inflammation is associated with many human maladies including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and COVID-19, as well as many neurodegenerative conditions, inhibitors of the anomalous activation of the inflammasome are important to identify [32]. Selective, potent small molecule caspase-1 inhibitors such as VX-765 (Belnacasan) exist but their strong side effects limit their clinical use [33]. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies on a small molecule caspase-1 inhibitor, NSC697923, showed its effectiveness in an animal model of gouty arthritis. When docking studies were performed that included NSC697923 in the binding pocket A of caspase-1, H-bonds with Arg341 were seen and, consistent with VX-765, the caspase-1 inhibitor was present in the caspase-1 crystal structure used in our studies [34]. In this investigation, aerial parts of Maytenus octogona (ethanol extracts), employed in Peruvian ethnopharmacology as anti-inflammatory agents, were analyzed using a cyclovoltammetry method able to directly determine the scavenging of the superoxide radical. Leaf extracts were more active than those from stems. A comparison with other natural products analyzed by our group using the same protocol (olive oil [25], propolis [26] and black seed oil [27]) indicates slightly weaker scavenging for these extracts. Recently, a study on the potential anti-inflammatory activity of some phenolic and methide-quinone nor-triterpenes isolated from Maytenus retusa that were evaluated for the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages appeared [35]. One of the most potent compounds evaluated was a semisynthetic methide-quinone Br derivative related to the three methide-quinones described in this work. This compound showed markedly reduced caspase-1 activity, IL-1\u03b2 secretion (IC50 = 0.19 \u00b5M), and pyroptosis (IC50 = 0.13 \u00b5M). Since caspase-1 inhibition is important in preventing excessive cytokine production that can lead to inflammation, these findings can be associated with our results. In this investigation, three natural methide-quinones derivatives contained in Maytenus octogona extracts were analyzed using molecular mechanics docking calculations. Results of these studies show the possible inhibition of caspase-1 by each of these compounds, thus supporting the anti-inflammatory medicinal use by indigenous populations in the related Peruvian area. Our work shows that Arg341 is the most important\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10750 15 of 17\namino acid involved in inhibiting the active site of caspase-1. This amino acid is stabilized through strong intermolecular interactions for each of the three potential inhibitors, hydroxytingenone, tingenone, and pristimerin. The calculated binding energies of these three compounds are \u221213.7 kcal/mol for hydroxytingenone, \u221211.8 and 13.0 kcal/mol for tingenone, and \u22129.3 and \u22129.4 kcal/mol for pristimerin, which indicate that all three natural products are good inhibitors. Each of these methide-quinones is closely related to the methide-quinone Br derivative mentioned above [35]. That these interactions remain after the more rigorous molecular dynamics calculations underscores their significance. The methide-quinone carbonyl group in hydroxytingenone and pristimerin is preferred as a hydrogen bond acceptor over the other possible carbonyl acceptor located in these ligands, agreeing with results shown in a previous study [11]. This is confirmed by statistics on the 10 poses of pristimerin, showing only poses 1\u20133 having H-bond interactions with the O(carbonyl) located at the other end of the molecule, whereas for poses 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 the methide-quinone carbonyl is engaged, also in H-bonds. Tingenone shows both carbonyls having a similar preference due to closely related binding energy derived from poses 1 and 5. Our work supports the anti-inflammatory medicinal use of Maytenus octogona by native populations in Peru and provides impetus for studying the chemical mechanisms of additional established traditional remedies. Once again, we have shown that natural products can provide the chemical scaffold that targets important receptor sites such as caspase-1 in the inflammasome pathway for the development of a novel therapy against human diseases.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms241310750/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.C.; methodology, H.C.; formal analysis, E.E.; investigation, F.C. and H.C.; data curation, M.B., R.S. and F.S.-L.; writing original draft preparation, F.C. and M.R.; writing-review and edit, F.C., M.R. and E.E.; visualization, M.R.
