    "abstractText": "Development of highly efficient therapeutic strategies tailored to patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains an overarching goal and pressing challenge (1-2). It is essential to mention that signal transduction cascades play instrumental role in the onset and progression of cancer. Deregulation of cell signaling pathways resulted in the loss of apoptosis, development of drug resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion of cancer cells (3-7). Seminal research works related to the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis have emphasized on proteincoding genes mainly because proteins were classically viewed as the central dogma of molecular biology. Discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) has generated wealth of evidence related to central role of non-coding RNAs in cellular functions and gene regulatory networks (8-17). Understanding the roles of lncRNAs and how they function in dynamic assemblies with other macromolecules has provided a better overview of regulatory role of lncRNAs during carcinogenesis and metastasis (18). Notably, high-throughput transcriptomic studies in the last two decades have unraveled rapidly expanding list of non-coding RNAs that outnumber the protein encoding genes within the human genome. Circular RNAs were identified initially in RNA viruses and considered transcriptional background noise. However, with rapid advancements in molecular biology, use of bioinformatics approaches and high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, researchers were able to structurally and functionally characterize circRNAs. Linear pre-mRNAs generate circRNAs through back-splicing or skipping of exons. Importantly, circular form of circRNAs protected them from degradation by exonucleases and made them significantly stable (19-22). Essentially, circRNAs hold a great potential with reference to therapeutic applications for OSCC, either through inhibition or restoration of circRNAs that fine-tune cancer cells' regulatory networks (23-25). In this review we have summarized most exciting findings related to regulation of cell signaling pathways by circular RNAs in various cancers.",

It is essential to mention that signal transduction cascades play instrumental role in the onset and progression of cancer. Deregulation of cell signaling pathways resulted in the loss of apoptosis, development of drug resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion of cancer cells (3-7).\nSeminal research works related to the underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis have emphasized on proteincoding genes mainly because proteins were classically viewed as the central dogma of molecular biology. Discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) has generated wealth of evidence related to central role of non-coding RNAs in cellular functions and gene regulatory networks (8-17). Understanding the roles of lncRNAs and how they function in dynamic assemblies with other macromolecules has provided a better overview of regulatory role of lncRNAs during carcinogenesis and metastasis (18).\nNotably, high-throughput transcriptomic studies in the last two decades have unraveled rapidly expanding list of non-coding RNAs that outnumber the protein encoding\ngenes within the human genome. Circular RNAs were identified initially in RNA viruses and considered transcriptional background noise. However, with rapid advancements in molecular biology, use of bioinformatics approaches and high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, researchers were able to structurally and functionally characterize circRNAs. Linear pre-mRNAs generate circRNAs through back-splicing or skipping of exons. Importantly, circular form of circRNAs protected them from degradation by exonucleases and made them significantly stable (19-22). Essentially, circRNAs hold a great potential with reference to therapeutic applications for OSCC, either through inhibition or restoration of circRNAs that fine-tune cancer cells' regulatory networks (23-25).\nIn this review we have summarized most exciting findings related to regulation of cell signaling pathways by circular RNAs in various cancers."

Over the last two decades, overwhelming proof-of-concept has established mechanistic regulatory role of non-coding RNAs in carcinogenesis, including OSCC. Circular RNAs demonstrate a burgeoning facet of oncology research and molecular biologists are only beginning to appreciate and recognize the significance of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of OSCC. Regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs in the re-shaping of signaling pathways offer plausible strategies for prevention/inhibition of OSCC. Circular RNAs have mechanistic roles in OSCC and \"sponge effects\" mediated by a wider variety of circRNAs need to be rationally targeted for effective cancer prevention. Phenomenal and cutting-edge research works in different types of animal models will further refine our knowledge for selection of most promising circRNAs as pharmacologically valuable targets.\nDoi: http://dx.doi.org/10.14715/cmb/2023.69.8.39 Copyright: \u00a9 2023 by the C.M.B.

CircZDBF2 antagonized miR-500b-5p and miR-362-5p mediated targeting of RNF145. CEBPB (CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta) has been shown to transcriptionally upregulate RNF145. circZDBF2 effectively promoted the binding of CEBPB to promoter regions of RNF145 (figure 1). Consequently, RNF145 activated NF\u03baB to transcriptionally upregulate IL-8 in OSCC cells. There was evident tumor regression in mice inoculated with circZDBF2-silenced-OSCC cells (36).\nSP1 transcriptionally upregulated the expression of circFAM126A in OSCC cells (37). circFAM126A blocked miR-186-mediated inhibition of FUS. circFAM126A interacted with RNA-binding protein FUS to promote mRNA stability of RAB41. circFAM126A knockdown caused significant decrease in the tumor size, volume and liver metastasis (37).\nKnockdown of circ_0005320 resulted in the inhibition of phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, which were abolished by the introduction of miR-486-3p inhibitors or miR-637 inhibitors in SCC25 and CAL27 cells (38). circ_0005320 levels were reduced, while the levels of miR-637 as well as miR-486-3p were noted to be increased in the tumor tissues of sh-circ_0005320 groups (38).\nZNF460 (Zinc Finger Protein 460) has the ability to transcriptionally upregulate circMTO1. Consequently, circMTO1 antagonized miR-320a-mediated inhibition of ATRX. circMTO1 knockdown reduced migration and invasion of OSCC cells (39).\nImpairment of autophagy results in aggregation of p62. Circ-PKD2 overexpression potently enhanced autophagy as evidenced by considerable increase in LC3-II to LC3-I ratio and simultaneous reduction in the levels of p62 (40). Circ-PKD2 overexpression led to an increase in the accumulation of autophagic vesicles in cisplatintreated-SCC-15 and CAL-27 cells. The nutrient-sensing kinase mTOR inhibits the activation of autophagy primarily through blockade of the assembly of ATG1-ATG13ATG17 complexes through hyper-phosphorylation of ATG13. Circ-PKD2 interfered with miR-646-mediated targeting of ATG13. Knockdown of ATG13 markedly reduced caspase-8 activity induced by circ-PKD2 overexpression. circ-PKD2 induced significant increase in the activity of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in cisplatin-treated OSCC cells but these effects were attenuated by ATG13 silencing and miR-646 mimics. circ-PKD2 overexpression triggered significant increase in the chemo-sensitivity. Furthermore, tumor mass derived from circ-PKD2 overexpressing OSCC cells was smaller in size (40).\nCirc-PKD2 sequestered away miR-204-3p and potentiated the expression of APC2 (adenomatous polyposis coli 2). Overexpression of miR\u2010204\u20103p stimulated the levels of \u03b2\u2010catenin, p\u2010AKT and p\u2010ERK1/2 in OSCC cells. Tumor growth was noticed to be remarkably impaired in mice injected subcutaneously with circ\u2010PKD2-overexpressing SCC-15 cells (41).\nMalignant tumors have characteristically exceptional features to disseminate through lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes. Studies have shown that tumors produce different growth factors that directly or indirectly stimulate\nFigure 1.

HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA promotes invasion and metastasis by promoting the recruitment of EZH2 to the promoter region of E-cadherin in oral squamous cell carcinoma (50). circ_0000311 interfered with miR-876-5pmediated targeting of EZH2. circ_0000311 knockdown impeded the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OSCC cells (51).\nFUS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma), an RNA binding protein has been shown to interact with long non-coding RNA PART1 (Prostatic androgen-regulated transcription-1) to stabilize EZH2. Importantly, tumors derived from PART1-silenced CAL27 cells demonstrated\nthe growth of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) and lymphatic metastasis.\nCircular RNAs have been reported to modulate an array of proteins via ubiquitination-mediated degradation. circFNDC3B promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of FUS. Mechanistically, circFNDC3B enhanced the interaction of MDM2 (murine double minute 2) and FUS (Figure 2). However, interaction between MDM2 and FUS was found to be reduced in circFNDC3B-depleted cells. MDM2 not only stabilized HIF1A but also promoted HIF1A-mediated transcriptional upregulation of VEGFA. MDM2 overexpression led to inhibition of HIF1A ubiquitination in 293T cells. circFNDC3B interfered with miR-181c-5p-mediated inhibition of PROX1 (Figure 2). PROX1 is a versatile transcriptional regulator as it centrally drives lymphangiogenesis and growth of the lymphatic endothelial cells, whereas ESM1 modulates the lymphangiogenic processes. Knockdown of circFNDC3B was reported to be associated with a lower LN volume, whereas its overexpression increased LN micrometastases. circFNDC3B proficiently enhances the metastasizing abilities of OSCC by promoting angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis in metastatic tumor microenvironment (42). Next-generation lymphatic targeting options can be tested in animal models to improve our understanding of changes in lymphatic structures and functions to promote pharmaceutical targeting of the lymphatics.\nRegression of the malignant tumors was noted in experimental mice inoculated with circ_OSBPL10-silencedSCC-9 cells. circ_OSBPL10 downregulation led to an\nnotable reduction in the levels of PART1 and EZH2 (52).

Co-culture of CD8+ T cells with circKRT1-silenced-CAL\u201027 or HSC\u20103 cells caused significant increase in cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells against OSCC cells. CircKRT1 knockdown enhanced cytotoxic effects and inhibited the apoptotic death of CD8+ T cells (54).\nCamrelizumab with docetaxel/cisplatin is currently being considered as a first-line therapy.

LATS2 (Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase-2) mediated phosphorylation of YAP1 inhibited its nuclear accumulation (60). miR-31 targets LATS2 and activates Hippo pathway in OSCC cells. However, circRNA_0000140 suppressed miR-31-mediated targeting of LATS2 in OSCC cells. There was an evident accumulation of YAP1 in the nucleus in miR-31-overexpressing OSCC cells. LATS2 knockdown led to suppression in the levels of E-cadherin along with a significant increase in the levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP9). circ_0000140 inhibited tumor formation and metastatic spread of OSCC cells by blockade of miR-31-mediated targeting of LATS2 (61).

Multiplicity of pulmonary metastatic nodules was found to be substantially reduced in experimental mice injected with CircUHRF1-silenced-SCC25 cells (67).\ncircLDLRAD3 blocked miR-558-mediated targeting of SMAD4 in OSCC. Importantly, tumors derived from circLDLRAD3-overexpressing OSCC cells were smaller in size, while the tumors developed from circLDLRAD3knockdown group presented larger size of the tumors. Essentially, the number of metastatic nodules on the surface of the lungs from circLDLRAD3-overexpressing group was noted to be significantly lower.

Mullen firstly reported the profile of m6A modifications on circRNAs through a computational pipeline (AutoCirc) tool. Utilizing the data of m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and m6A-circRNAs microarray, research team demonstrated that m6A-circRNAs exhibited discrete modification styles in oral squamous cell carcinoma.\nCircFOXK2 is derived principally from the Exon 3-2 of FOXK2 genome with 343 bp length (70). Moreover, in the adjacently located area of circFOXK2 conjunction site, m6A modification site has been identified within the GGACT site. Knockdown of circFOXK2 reduced the migratory properties of OSCC cells, whereas, overexpression of circFOXK2 fueled the migratory potential of cancer cells. Overall, circFOXK2 potently enhanced the malignant phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Furthermore, CircFOXK2 worked synchronously with IGF2BP3 and enhanced the stability of GLUT1 mRNA. Overexpression of circFOXK2 effectively promoted the interaction between IGF2BP3 and GLUT1, while knockdown of circFOXK2 caused severe dissociation of the interaction between IGF2BP3 and GLUT1. Collectively, these findings suggested that circFOXK2 effectively stabilized GLUT1 mRNA primarily through interaction with IGF2BP3 in m6 A-dependent manner (70)."

KDM2A (Lysine demethylase\n2 A) is involved in the demethylation of the dimethylated H3K36 (H3K36me2) residue. Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) also known as Jumonji domain-containing protein 2A (JMJD2A) has also been shown to play major role in the progression of OSCC.\ncircFOXO3 potentiated the expression of KDM2A by relieving the repressive effects of miR-214 on KDM2A. circFOXO3 and KDM2A effectively promoted the growth of the OSCC cells (71).
