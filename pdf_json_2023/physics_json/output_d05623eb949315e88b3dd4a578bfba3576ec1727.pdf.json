    "abstractText": "Molecular imprinting is an efficient strategy to make the detection of compounds more specific and more selective. This targeted analytical strategy using molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) synthesis needs to obtain the optimized conditions. A selective molecularly imprinted polymer was prepared for caffeic acid (CA) detection after varying the following synthesis parameters: functional monomer type (N-phenylacrylamide, N-PAA or methacrylic acid, MAA), solvent type (acetonitrile/methanol or acetonitrile/toluene), and the polymerization method (UV or thermal initiation). The optimal polymer was obtained using MAA as a functional monomer, acetonitrile/methanol as solvent, and UV polymerization. Morphological characterizations were done for the optimal CA-MIP using mid-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption. The optimal polymer showed good specificity and selectivity in the presence of interferents (antioxidants having a chemical structure close to CA) in a hydroalcoholic solution. The electrochemical detection of CA was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) after the interaction between CA and the optimal MIP in a wine sample. The linear range of the developed method was between 0 and 1.11 mM, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.13 mM, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.32 mM. HPLC-UV was used to validate the newly developed method. Recovery values were between 104% and 111%.",

            "text": "The presence of antioxidants in foods, beverages, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals has become of great importance to both producers and consumers. The latter is becoming increasingly aware of their health benefits [1\u20133]. Research in the field of antioxidants is more and more focused on the valorization of these compounds, their extraction, detection, identification, and monitoring. Liquid chromatography coupled to a UV or mass spectrometry detector is the most used classical detection method for antioxidants. They are, in general, time-consuming and need a sample preparation step to eliminate the interference [4\u20139]. Caffeic acid (CA) is an orthodiphenol that belongs to the subgroup of hydroxycinnamic acids, it was chosen for its antioxidant characteristics and because it is widespread in plants (rosemary), fruit (wild blueberries, blackcurrant), and drinks (ginko infusion, tea, wine, and coffee). It is a quality tracer of wine oxidation. Potatoes peels or fruit peels are rich in caffeic acid that can be valorized after an extraction step [10\u201314]. A rapid method has been presented by Elhachem et al. [15] for the electrochemical detection of caffeic acid using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and screen-printed electrodes and has been applied in wine. This simple and rapid method showed interesting results in terms of selectivity and was validated by a reference method, the HPLC-UV.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1660. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12081660 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 1660 2 of 13\nHowever, the developed method presented a lack of specificity, traduced by a slight difference between the imprinted and non-imprinted polymer. For this reason, it is important to optimize the synthesis of this polymer couple in order to keep its selectivity and improve its specificity. The MIP synthesis is, in general, easy to perform but requires a long procedure for the optimization of its conditions and reagents. A lot of parameters can influence the synthesis, starting with the reagents type (template, functional monomer, cross-linker, initiator), the solvent nature (protic, aprotic), the radical initiation method (thermal and UV), the type of polymerization (precipitation, mass, bulk), the drying conditions, and the washing method for the template extraction [16\u201318]. Once the influencing parameters are set up, the rebinding tests are then performed to study the MIP performance. In this work, eleven CA-MIP/NIP couples were synthesized by varying the following parameters: the functional monomer (MAA or N-PAA), the solvent (acetonitrile/methanol or acetonitrile/toluene), and the polymerization method (UV or thermal). Rebinding characteristics of all 11 couples of MIP and NIP were studied in the hydroalcoholic medium. The objective was to choose the optimal couple (having the highest specificity, i.e., the highest difference in terms of adsorption between MIP and NIP) and use it to detect caffeic acid in wine using a fast method based on cyclic voltammetry (CV). The optimal polymer was characterized by FTIR, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption isotherms. Selectivity tests were performed using the optimal MIP in a hydroalcoholic solution and four interferent antioxidants having a close chemical structure to CA. The newly developed method (MIP coupled to CV) was applied in a Burgundy red wine in order to determine CA and compared to the reference method HPLC-UV."

Methacrylic acid is a well-known functional monomer commonly used in radical polymerization because of its high interaction with the acid template.

The obtained yield is not the most\nFoods 2023, 12, 1660 6 of 13\nimportant parameter, but a high yield is still valuable because it avoids the need to make a new synthesis for additional applications and reduces the synthesis cost. Finally, the most important parameter is the specificity of the polymer, which is represented in Table 2 by \u2206Nads and % of NIP adsorption in the presence of 10 mg of polymer. \u2206Nads is the difference between the amount of CA retained by MIP and the one retained by NIP. The increase of \u2206Nads indicates an increase in specificity. The percentage of NIP adsorption is defined by the amount of CA retained by the NIP. The lower this value, the higher the specificity. Couples five and six showed the best specificity with a low or no adsorption by the NIP6 in comparison with MIP6. Although both couples had MAA as a functional monomer. The type of radical initiation is an additional factor that helped determine the best couple. Couple six showed a better specificity due to UV polymerization compared to thermal initiation (couple five).

For this reason, 22 imprinted and non-imprinted polymers were synthesized by varying the functional monomer type, the solvent nature, and the polymerization method. CA was determined by a fast method using a screenprinted carbon electrode and cyclic voltammetry. The best polymer (optimal polymer, MIP6) was obtained using MAA as a functional monomer, acetonitrile/methanol as solvent, and UV polymerization. MAA played a key role because of the complementarity of its acid function with the acid function of caffeic acid. The UV polymerization at low temperatures was also important and was responsible for the success of the imprinting process. The Schatchard plot, which was realized on MIP6, showed the presence of two populations of binding sites inside the MIP: one of high affinity due to the interaction of CA with the MIP inside the imprinting cavities (interaction between CA and MAA, specific interaction) and one of low affinity due to the interaction of CA with the MIP outside the cavities (interaction between CA and the crosslinker; non-specific interactions). The selectivity of MIP6 was studied in a hydroalcoholic solution using four antioxidants with a close chemical structure to CA. The selectivity factor varied from two to six, showing that CA was the antioxidant with the highest affinity towards MIP6. The optimal polymer was successfully applied in wine, and its performance was validated by HPLC-UV. The recovery range of the newly developed method varied between 104% and 111%, the LOD was 0.13 mM, and the LOQ was 0.32 mM. This new method is promising in terms of simplicity, efficiency, and rapidity compared to the conventional one. In order to transform this method into a real-time tool for the determination of caffeic acid in an aqueous medium, an electropolymerization method where the functional monomer will be deposited directly on the surface of the electrode could be developed.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12081660/s1, Figure S1: N2 sorption isotherms of MIP6 and NIP6.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.E., P.C., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; validation, M.E., P.C., M.A., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; formal analysis, M.E., P.C., M.A., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; investigation, M.E., P.C., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; writing original draft preparation, M.E.; writing, review, and editing, M.E., P.C., M.A., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; visualization, M.E.; supervision, P.C., M.A., R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; project administration, R.G.M. and E.B.-M.; funding acquisition, R.G.M. and E.B.-M.
