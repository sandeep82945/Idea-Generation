"The implications of our study for policymakers are clear. We suggest that growth-oriented policies are necessary to validate the EKC hypothesis and that policymakers in Pakistan should target development and growth-related policies without fear of environmental degradation. We also recommend re-arranging urban planning priorities to minimize transport-based environmental pollution, such as improving the public transport system and encouraging high-rise building culture. Dissemination of sustainable alternative fuel use and infrastructure within the scope of green transformation are important steps for decarbonization, and we suggest that the government give green finance to convert current vehicles to renewable energy. In addition, we recommend the introduction of a comprehensive transportation system with a special focus on vehicle fitness monitoring to reduce transport-based carbon emissions. Financial penalties should be used to discourage out-of-order vehicles that are emitting smoke. Energy efficiency in the transport sector and optimization of vehicle speed can also contribute to reducing emissions. The dissemination of vehicles based on fuel economy and support of tax incentives can make a significant difference. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the public transport system in overcoming the environmental issues caused by the transport sector and suggest that the government encourage the public and private sectors to invest in and provide a high-quality public transport system to the citizens."
