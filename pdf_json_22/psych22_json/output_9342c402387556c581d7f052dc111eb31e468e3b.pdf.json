Material and Methods: Data from anamnesis and the blood and urine samples were collected from 116 patients diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use. All of them expressed written informed consent. Analytical confirmation was obtained by highperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Liquid-liquid extraction was used for sample preparation. Results: In the sample, 108 (93%) of 116 were positive for psychoactive substances (including 96 cases where >1 substance was found), 69% of individuals were tested positive for opioids and 67% for benzodiazepines. Eleven (9%) of 116 patient samples were positive for NPS. We detected 7 different substances. Six of them were synthetic cannabinoids: PB-22, MDMB-CHMICA, MMB-CHMICA, AB-CHMINACA, MMB-FUBINACA, THJ-2201 and one synthetic cathinone 3-CMC. Conclusions: The prevalence and NPS profile (the predominance of synthetic cannabinoids) are similar in the group of people with addiction to psychoactive substances as in populations of people taking recreational drugs and the overdose patients admitted to the hospital.

Such studies were conducted also on patients in psychiatric hospitals\u00a0[12,13]. There are fewer studies in which the\u00a0use of NPS has been confirmed by analytical methods, these studies most often relate to acute cases of intoxication in people taking these substances as recreational drugs\u00a0[14\u201318]. Currently, there is limited literature on the\u00a0socio-demographic profile of NPS consumers. Those studies have shown that young males, abusing other (non-NPS) drugs, especially after combining some of them, are more likely to use NPS\u00a0[7\u201316]. According to some reports, NPS users have a\u00a0higher possibility of displaying risky behavior\u00a0[10,11,19]. Experienced individuals with substance use disorder add NPS to typically used, illicit substances\u00a0[7,19]. The group of NPS-only users is very rare. Sutherland et\u00a0al.\u00a0[10] found that only 5.7% of NPS users and 0.07% of the\u00a0cohort group did not use drugs other than NPS. The prevalence of NPS in the\u00a0 population of individuals with an addiction, often taking psychoactive substances, is poorly estimated\u00a0[11]. There has been previously published a\u00a0study of a\u00a0similar patient cohort analyzed using the\u00a0anamnesis only. In\u00a0this study, 34% of the\u00a0patients reported taking NPS in the\u00a0past, without indicating the\u00a0particular time of intake and substance type\u00a0[20]. The goal of our study was to check the\u00a0presence of NPS in comparison to \u201cclassic\u201d drugs in blood and urine of the\u00a0 group of newly admitted patients with mental and behavioral disorders due to the\u00a0use of psychoactive substances diagnosis (section F11\u201319 according to ICD-10)."

The most commonly used drugs are cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine (AMF) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA). However, the\u00a0frequency of use for each drug varies considerably from country to country depending on the\u00a0age of users\u00a0[1,2]. It is estimated that 26.3% of adult Europeans (15\u201364 years) have had contact with cannabis in their lifetime\u00a0[1]. Over the\u00a0 last years, environmental signals from both formal and informal research and monitoring sources have been showing critical recent developments within Europe\u2019s new psychoactive substances (NPS) market\u00a0[1]. New psychoactive substances are a\u00a0heterogeneous class of typically synthetic molecules including: synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, synthetic cathinones, amphetamine-derivatives, psychedelic phenethylamines, ketamine derivatives, novel tryptamines, synthetic opioids and sedatives (GABAA/B agonists)\u00a0[3\u20135]. The NPS are cheap and easily available either on the\u00a0street or from websites\u00a0[4\u20138]. In\u00a0Poland, NPS are usually known under the\u00a0name of \u201cboosters\u201d. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists have been the\u00a0most popular NPS in recent years. According to the\u00a0current observations, they are especially popular among high-risk drug-using populations. Such groups include prisoners from approx. 2/3 (N = 19) of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) reporting countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the\u00a0Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey and the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0[1]. The majority of research studying NPS uses questionnaires\u00a0 [6\u201311] or analyses of medical data\u00a0 [12,13] and concerns either recreational use or cases of acute intoxication\u00a0[14].\nIJOMEH 2022;35(4) 487\nby a\u00a0password and stored on the\u00a0university servers only.

The\u00a0 Welch test was utilized to compare the\u00a0 age of the\u00a0 patients from these groups (with NPS and without NPS)\u00a0[21]. The\u00a0reason for performing such analysis was the\u00a0 heterogeneous variances between the\u00a0 groups (the variance\u00a0 in\u00a0 the NPS-negative\u00a0 group was 229.8, while the\u00a0variance in the\u00a0NPS-positive group was 30.66). parison to \u201cclassic\u201d drugs in the\u00a0 population of a\u00a0 newly admitted patients group with mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance abuse (F11\u201319 section).

For patients whose mental state allowed for informed consent, written consent was obtained during the\u00a0 examination after admission to the\u00a0hospital. In\u00a0such cases, samples of biological material (blood and urine) were taken after the\u00a0 medical examination.

Forty-six patients denied using any illicit substances, 55 patients gave information about the\u00a0intake of one psychoactive substance, and 15 patients reported taking >1 substance. In Poland, NPS are commonly referred to as \u201cboosters,\u201d which explains why only 2 subjects were able to give the\u00a0 proper name of the\u00a0 substance used (mephedrone). That is the\u00a0 reason the\u00a0 NPS group was treated homogeneously with no detailed distinction between particular substances. In\u00a0the\u00a0group of patients declaring the\u00a0use of opioids, there were both heroin and \u201ccompote\u201d (a homemade extract of opioid alkaloids obtained from poppy straw decoction aka \u201cPolish heroin\u201d) users as well as tramadol users. Also, the\u00a0people who declared taking various drugs belonging to the\u00a0BDZ group were treated as one group. There were also 3 specific cases of various chemicals use, among others, volatile solvents (1 case), Z-drugs (2\u00a0cases). These results are shown in Figure 1.\nIJOMEH 2022;35(4)490\nThe detailed information concerning NPS-positive cases is presented in Table\u00a03. In the\u00a0group of 11 patients whose samples were positive for NPS, only 3 in anamnesis declared that they had taken these drugs. Two of them were admitted in emergency mode and 1 in elective mode. A wide range of symptoms was found in the\u00a0clinical examination of 10 patients from the\u00a0 NPS-positive group. These included: depressed mood, gait disturbances, tachycardia, agitation, weakness, insomnia, anxiety, fear, hallucination. These symptoms were not typical for any specific group of psychoactive substances. Due to discrepancies between anamnesis and analytical results, the\u00a0authors decided to examine the\u00a0data from toxicology tests of a\u00a0group of patients declaring NPS intake during anamnesis. In\u00a0a\u00a0group of 13 patients who declared taking NPS, these substances were detected in the\u00a0blood or urine of only 3 of them. There has been a\u00a0comparison made between NPS-negative and NPS-positive groups concerning the\u00a0demographical data, as shown in Table\u00a04. The authors have not observed statistically significant differences in sex distribution between the\u00a0study groups (p\u00a0= 0.564, Fisher\u2019s exact test). The\u00a0 age analysis showed that the\u00a0average age of patients who took NPS was 27.6 years (range 19\u201335 years). Such patients were usually 9 years younger than NPS-negative patients. This difference was statistically significant (t\u00a0= 3.22, p\u00a0= 0.003, Welch\u2019s t-test). The analysis of the\u00a0 age range showed that the\u00a0 percentage of NPS-positive patients was higher in younger age groups. There were no cases of NPS use in patients >40 years. The authors have reported a\u00a0slightly higher percentage of emergency admissions in the\u00a0 NPS-positive group compared to the\u00a0NPS-negative. Due to the\u00a0small number of patients in the\u00a0examined group, this difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0= 0.758, Fisher\u2019s exact test).\ndetected, while in single cases patients were positive for even 5 different groups of substances (NPS, AMF, BDZ, opioids, cannabis). Apart from the\u00a0substances representing the\u00a0groups included in the\u00a0 questionnaire, the authors have also observed the\u00a0presence of MDMA\u00a0\u2013 2 cases and methamphetamine (MET)\u00a0\u2013 1 case. The results of blood and urine analysis of substances detected in this sample are presented in Figure\u00a02. New psychoactive substances were detected in 11 patients (including 3 different substances in 1 patient, 2\u00a0substances in 2 patients, and 1\u00a0substance in 8 patients). The\u00a0following NPS were detected: MMB-CHMICA (2\u00a0cases), 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC) (2 cases), Ab-CHMINACA (2\u00a0cases), MDMB-CHMICA (3\u00a0cases), THJ-2201 (1 case), MMB FUBINACA (2 cases), PB-22 (4\u00a0cases). All detected\u00a0NPS, except 3-CMC belonged to the\u00a0synthetic cannabinoid group. In\u00a0turn, 3-CMC, belonged to the\u00a0group of synthetic cathinones. In 5 cases, NPS was only found in the\u00a0blood, in 3 cases only in the\u00a0urine, while in 3 other cases it was found both in the\u00a0blood and urine. Of these, in the\u00a0latter group, other NPS were present in the\u00a0urine and others in the\u00a0blood.\nIJOMEH 2022;35(4) 491\nor urine in 11 patients (9% of cases). The\u00a0significant contribution of opioids might be caused by the\u00a0high addictive potential of this group. In\u00a0the\u00a0case of BDZ, it is due to high availability and popularity. Interestingly, numerous studies have shown that opioid overdose over the\u00a0years has been the\u00a0main cause of death in cases of fatal poisoning in the\u00a0population of drug individuals with substance use disorder in many countries\u00a0[22]. The NPS were detected in 11 subjects, which constituted 9% of cases. The\u00a0similar study, based only on anamnesis data, showed that 34% of the\u00a0patients revealed contact with NPS in their lifespan\u00a0[20]. The\u00a0results of the\u00a0toxicological analysis confirmed the\u00a0 presence of NPS in the\u00a0blood or urine of 9% of tested patients. In\u00a0our view,"

Among the\u00a0substances detected in the study, SCRAs were prevailing. The SCRAs were especially popular at that time\u00a0[1,10,12,17,18]. The analysis of the\u00a0 demographic data showed that the\u00a0NPS-positive group was younger than the\u00a0NPS-negative group. The\u00a0 difference was found to be statistically significant (t\u00a0= 3.22, p\u00a0= 0.003, Welch\u2019s t-test). This observation tallies with the\u00a0data from other studies\u00a0[7\u201316]. What is more, the\u00a0 frequency of emergency admissions of\u00a0NPS-positive patients was slightly higher than those of NPS-negative. However, in this case, the\u00a0 difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0= 0.758, Fisher\u2019s exact test). The\u00a0reason for the\u00a0lack of statistical significance may be the\u00a0small sample of NPS-positive people. Large discrepancies were noted between the\u00a0 data obtained from the\u00a0anamnesis and analytical tests regarding the\u00a0type of psychoactive substances used. The\u00a0reasons for this may be: \u2013 subjects could take substances that were not included in the\u00a0spectrum of the\u00a0analysis, or \u2013 as noted earlier, in Poland NPS constitute a\u00a0large and diverse group of substances lumped together as \u201cboosters.\u201d In addition, in the\u00a0case of an illegal market, substances other than those declared by the\u00a0seller are often bought. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that some of those declaring taking NPS have actually taken substances classified as \u201cclassic\u201d drugs, e.g., AMF. For example, often dried material of cannabis advertised as natural marijuana can be enriched with its synthetic derivatives, which could explain the case of a patient No. 3 who reported that she had taken cannabis and was diagnosed with PB-22\u00a0[23]. Other reasons include: \u2013 subjects who have a\u00a0 problem with substance abuse may be uncertain of the\u00a0time they last took NPS, \u2013 the time of drug elimination from the\u00a0 bloodstream and urine in many NPS has not been established. such differences could be explained by the\u00a0 following reasons: \u2013 In a\u00a0given study the\u00a0results included the\u00a0use of NPS in general, regardless of the\u00a0time (the examined patients could have taken NPS recently as well as in the\u00a0distant past). Whereas, in the\u00a0current study the authors analyzed only the blood and urine samples, which means that\u00a0only the recent period was taken into account. \u2013 A relatively narrow toxicological panel was utilized in the\u00a0 current study. Due to this, it cannot be excluded that some substances that had been taken could not be detected as they were not included in the\u00a0screening. Comparing the\u00a0 results of the\u00a0 current study with other studied populations, the\u00a0 results show a\u00a0 slightly higher number of NPS-positive results than in the\u00a0groups of patients with recreational toxicity described by Vallersnes et\u00a0al.\u00a0[18], who detected NPS in 8% of cases. In\u00a0contrast, Dines et\u00a0al.\u00a0[2] in a\u00a0large multicentre study detected NPS in 5.6%\u00a0of pa tients\u00a0with overdose.

It\u00a0 is, therefore, possible that some of the\u00a0substances may not have been detected. At\u00a0 this point, it should be noted that the\u00a0studied group of patients often do not have a\u00a0very reliable approach to the\u00a0sense of the\u00a0passage of time. Hence, some simplification was made and the\u00a0 value of 48\u00a0h was arbitrarily assumed for the\u00a0entire study group. It\u00a0should be noted that in the\u00a0case of classic drugs, the\u00a0duration of their maintenance in urine or blood is established and may even be longer (especially BDZ, cannabis) than 48\u00a0h [29]. Therefore, in the\u00a0case of substances other than NPS, the\u00a0compatibility between anamnesis data and analytical results was not analyzed.
