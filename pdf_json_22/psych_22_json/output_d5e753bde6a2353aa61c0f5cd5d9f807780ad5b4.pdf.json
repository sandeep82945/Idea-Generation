    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant psychological distress for college students due to the sudden proliferation of stressors. We examine whether and how self and parental immigration status contributes to Latina/o/x college students\u2019 mental health and pandemic stressors during the initial months of the pandemic. We draw on quantitative and qualitative survey data collected in March\u2013June 2020 with 1,600 Latina/o/x University of California undergraduate students from three self-identified groups: undocumented students, US citizens with at least one undocumented parent, and US citizens with lawfully present parents. Quantitative analyses reveal that the pandemic produced widespread negative mental health effects but the severity of these effects did not differ by self/parental immigration status. Our qualitative analyses identify common pandemic-related stressors across our three student groups (financial insecurity, COVID-19 virus concerns, academic strains, and social dynamics); however, undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents identify unique aspects of these stressors due to legal vulnerabilities. Self and parental undocumented status also compromises the ability to manage common pandemic stressors because of immigration status-related exclusion from necessary resources. Ultimately, we argue that the high-stress nature of the pandemic elevated mental distress across all student groups, but the structural exclusion of undocumented immigrants contributes to unique experiences of stress among Latina/o/x undocumented students and US citizen students with undocumented parents.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant levels of psychological distress. A meta-analysis established a high prevalence of depression (33.7%), anxiety (31.9%), and stress (29.6%) among the general population during its initial months [1]. College students also display elevated rates of anxiety and depression compared to pre-pandemic levels [2, 3]. A study of 2,031 college students in Texas found that 48.14% expressed moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and 38.48% expressed moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms [4]. In a study of first-year college students in North Carolina, the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety\nincreased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% four months after the pandemic began, while moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5 to 31.7% [5]. While this line of research establishes severe mental health strain among college students, relatively less work has examined how structural inequalities may create unique pandemic stressors among marginalized groups.\nAmong college students, pandemic stressors include concerns about their own and loved ones\u2019 health, academic performance, job loss as well as difficulty concentrating, lack of motivation, disrupted sleep, and limited social interactions [6, 7]. Prior research suggests that these stressors may be exacerbated for marginalized groups. For example, lower income students are more likely to report adverse economic and health effects of the pandemic [8]. Pre-pandemic financial strain is associated with worse economic, academic, and health effects of the pandemic among undocumented students [9]. Women-identified students were more likely than men to report disruptions of their home life and social activities [10]. Students of color reported facing and witnessing * Laura E. Enriquez laura.enriquez@uci.edu 1 University of\u00a0California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA 2 California State University, Channel Islands, Camarillo, CA,\nUSA\n1 3\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\ndiscrimination during the pandemic, which compounded the effects of other common pandemic stressors [11].\nOne group that may be especially exposed to pandemic stressors is undocumented immigrants. Since the onset of the pandemic, immigrant communities have been at higher risk for COVID-19 exposure and infection and have had more pandemic-related economic strain [12, 13]. This is particularly true for Latina/o/x immigrant communities which are plagued by structural racism and state-sanctioned violence that perpetuate occupational and residential segregation and higher rates of underlying health conditions, both of which condition higher COVID-related risk [14, 15]. Further, pandemic-related financial strain differs by immigration status as almost half (48%) of Latino immigrants without lawful permanent status had a hard time paying their bills during the pandemic, a much higher share than their peers with lawful permanent residency (35%) or US citizenship (26%) [16].\nThe ability to cope with pandemic stressors is also structurally constrained. One\u2019s immigration status and immigrant origin can limit behavioral responses (e.g., quitting a job) and mitigating resources [17]. Federal pandemic relief efforts explicitly excluded undocumented immigrants and their families. In March 2020, Congress passed the first Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) which provided cash relief to eligible adults; however, undocumented immigrants and their lawfully present family members were excluded [18]. A month later, the Department of Education released guidance excluding undocumented college students from receiving emergency educational grant aid [19]. While California, where this study was conducted, provided financial support to undocumented immigrants affected by COVID-19 in May 2020, only a limited number of undocumented immigrants received funds [20]. Preexisting state and federal policies also limited undocumented immigrants\u2019 access to other social safety nets, such as health care and unemployment benefits [21, 22].\nHigh rates of undocumented immigration status among Latinas/os/xs elevate their structural risk for COVID-related health disparities. Specifically, half of Mexican and Central American immigrants are undocumented [23, 24] and approximately a quarter of Latina/o/x US citizen children have an undocumented immigrant parent [25]. Individual citizenship status may mask the structural inequalities and familial legal vulnerability experienced by US citizens with undocumented family members. Specifically, both undocumented and US citizen young adults with undocumented parents may face constrained resources because they share experiences of family-level legal vulnerability such as financial insecurity [26]. Indeed, prior research has documented the convergence of educational and wellbeing outcomes among college students who are undocumented and US citizens with undocumented parents [27].\nDespite elevated risk for experiencing pandemic stressors and constrained resources, prior research suggests that undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents are not faring particularly worse in COVID-related physical and mental health outcomes than their US-born counterparts with lawfully present parents [28]. Building on this research, we focus on Latinas/os/xs because this group may experience a unique relationship between self/parental immigration status and COVID-related mental health outcomes due to racist-nativist discourse that casts Latinas/os/ xs as undocumented immigrants who are COVID-19 carriers and undeserving of aid [29, 30]. Latinas/os/xs also have higher age-specific death rates for COVID-19 compared to Whites and, in California, are 8.1 times more likely to live in households at high risk of exposure (23.6% versus 2.9%) and are overrepresented in caseloads (3,784 per 100,000 people versus 1,112) [15, 31]; this suggests that Latinas/os/xs may experience unique pandemic-related stressors that may strain their mental health. Second, we take a mixed-methods approach because similar outcomes may be concealing unique stress and coping processes among undocumented students and students with undocumented parents. Pearlin\u2019s stress process theory acknowledges the structural nature of stressors and coping responses, such as low socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minoritization, and undocumented immigration status, which not only increase exposure to certain stressors, but also constrain one\u2019s ability to respond to them [32]. Other work has found that undocumented students experience stressors common among young adults (e.g., fear of the future, academic pressure) in ways that are uniquely informed by the precarity of their or their families\u2019 immigration statuses [33]. For undocumented students and students with undocumented parents, legal vulnerabilities may prompt unique pandemic stressors as well as constrain coping resources in ways that quantitative data alone may not capture.\nThis paper examines whether and how self and parental immigration status contributes to Latina/o/x college students\u2019 mental health and pandemic stressors. We draw on quantitative and qualitative survey data from 1,600 Latina/ o/x University of California (UC) undergraduate students split between three groups: undocumented students, US citizens with at least one undocumented parent, and US citizens with lawfully present parents. We address three research questions: (1) Do pandemic-related negative mental health effects of Latina/o/x college students differ by self/parental immigration status?; (2) What pandemic stressors did Latina/o/x college students from immigrant families experience, and do these differ by self and parental immigration status?; and (3) How does self and parental immigration status affect their management of pandemic stressors? Prior research has established that parental undocumented status spills over into the lives of their US citizen children\n283\n1 3\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\nto compromise their overall wellbeing, including financial stability, mental health, and potential for future upward mobility [26]. Thus, we hypothesize that Latina/o/x undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents will report worse mental health impacts, unique stressors, and fewer resources to aid them in managing these stressors when compared to Latina/o/x US citizens with lawfully present parents."

The survey was administered via Qualtrics with an estimated completion time of 25\u201335 min. Respondents provided informed consent through an information sheet and consent question displayed at the beginning of the survey. Respondents received a $10 electronic gift card as compensation for their time. All project activities were approved by the University of California, Irvine IRB.\nThe survey was fielded to answer research questions related to how immigration-related policies produce educational and wellbeing inequities; however, due to the evolving nature of the pandemic, respondents were asked three questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning March 30. We focus on 1,600 Latina/o/x respondents who were administered these COVID-related questions.

There was a 77.9% response rate for an analytic sample of 1,247. We analyzed these responses using flexible coding techniques [34]. First, index codes were developed to enable data reduction and retrieval (e.g., financial consequences, academic consequences, mental health consequences); these were independently applied by two research assistants and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third research assistant. The authors identified four types of stressors after multiple readings of the responses and identified analytic sub-codes within each type (see Table\u00a01). These represent code families, where several sub-codes reflect distinct aspects of a general theme [35]. Index codes were used to restrict the data to relevant sections (e.g., financial consequences index code was used to restrict data for coding financial strain stressors). All analytic codes were applied independently by two coders, with a third adjudicating discrepancies. We tabulated the frequency of each analytic code and compared the frequency and substantive content of each across the three self/parental immigration status comparison groups.\nTo examine how students\u2019 self and family immigration status affected their management of pandemic stressors (RQ3), we analyzed responses to a qualitative write-in question: \u201cHas your or your family members\u2019 immigrant origin affected your experience of the COVID-19/ coronavirus pandemic?

Further, many tied this to their employment in the service sector which was significantly curtailed due to California\u2019s\nstay-at-home orders. A small portion of students in all three groups mentioned fear of future job loss.\nA second dimension of financial insecurity stressors was related to ensuing material deprivation, including food insecurity and an inability to meet basic needs. For example, one US citizen with lawfully present parents wrote, \u201cCOVID-19 has taken our jobs away making it harder to pay bills and obtain basic needs.\u201d These comments arose among all three groups but were more common among the undocumented students, followed by US citizens with undocumented parents. Further, undocumented students highlighted their deprivation, rather than more generalized financial difficulties. For example, one wrote, \u201cSome of my family no longer has a job and are struggling to purchase food and not be evicted from their home\u201d and another shared, \u201cMy family is rationing food, we are unable to pay our rent or bills.\u201d\nA third dimension of financial insecurity stressors was having a limited safety net to manage economic strains. For example, one US citizen with lawfully present parents wrote, \u201cMy mother can be laid off [from] her work at any time, and this would leave us with nothing as we cannot afford to save money each paycheck.\u201d Such comments arose among all three groups. In addition, undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents highlighted their ineligibility for social services and federal relief aid that would help cushion the blow of income loss. \u201cMy parents and I were laid off from our jobs. We live by a daily check and we do not qualify for the stimulus check nor for any government assistance.\u201d\nA final dimension of financial insecurity stressors manifested as increased pressure and responsibility to help cover household expenses. This stressor was more common among undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents who emphasized they had become the sole financial providers for their family or took on additional jobs:\n\u201cIf I stop working that means less income to pay for bills, food, and housing. That if I stop working and my dad does not get paid on time we don\u2019t have the money necessary to be able to buy essential items.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cI had to take another job on top of the one I have in order to provide help for my family, as their jobs are day to day and my sister was let go.\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parents)\nFewer US citizens with lawfully present parents noted these types of increased responsibilities and those who did reported less pressing demands. For example, one wrote, \u201cI know my parents have savings but I know they are getting depleted so I feel pressured to start working and contributing money in the household.\u201d\n288\n1 3\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\nCOVID-19 Virus Concerns\nOne dimension of COVID-19 virus stressors was related to exposure risk, primarily related to students\u2019 and parents\u2019 classification as \u201cessential workers.\u201d Students from all three groups shared concerns about exposure to the virus, mostly as part of their employment:\n\u201cFor me, as an essential worker, I have had to work a lot more hours. I also have to deal with the stress of being around over 200 people a day.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cMy family still has to go to work and we rely on public transportation, and with limited resources, it is difficult to social distance and stay safe.\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parent) \u201cMy father gets up everyday worried about the virus since he is a truck driver and he doesn\u2019t want the guilt of infecting us with it.\u201d (US citizen with lawfully present parents)\nAlthough students with lawfully present parents were slightly more likely to identify exposure related stressors, they also identified a wider range of exposure sources such as working in healthcare settings or \u201cgoing outside.\u201d Undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents focused more on feeling forced to take such risks in order to financially sustain their family\u2019s wellbeing with one undocumented student commenting, \u201cI feel pain because my\ncommunity fears more for losing their jobs than their health safety.\u201d\nA second dimension of COVID-19 virus stressors was fear of the consequences of the student or their family members being infected. Students in all three groups shared such concerns but undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents tended to express concerns for cascading infection risk in overcrowded living situations and multi-family households as well as limited access to healthcare due to immigration status:\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck in a small one-bedroom apartment for social distancing, so I fear if one of us gets sick, we\u2019ll all get sick and not be able to afford health care due to our status and income.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cMy family and I have to be extra careful to not get infected because we babysit my 2-year-old nephew while his parents go to work since they are essential workers and also being careful because my mom has diabetes and is at risk if she gets infected.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201c[I] worry that I could be a carrier and get my mom sick. Since my mom is undocumented and does not qualify for health insurance \u2026, she would not be able to receive healthcare. I worry that this could threaten her life. I also worry because she has anxiety and this pandemic has been triggering her.

The primary academic stressor was general strain related to remote learning. Students recounted difficulties with the new instruction mode:\n\u201cOnline schooling just is not for me. It is just so hard for me to concentrate and learn through a computer.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cThe move to online is not manageable. We have poor internet and can\u2019t get better internet because of our location and because it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parents) I feel suffocated by my school work and professors don\u2019t seem to have empathy for students. (US citizen with lawfully present parents)\nTwo additional academic stressors aggravated the more common remote learning stressors: limited space and increased family responsibilities. Students who lived in overcrowded housing conditions reported a lack of privacy, too much noise, and inadequate study space as additional stressors that made remote learning particularly difficult:\n\u201cThe struggle of being back home - I don\u2019t have a bed, desk, closet, or space for myself living in a very small 2 bedroom apartment with a total of 6 people in my household it is very hard to get my school work done.\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cIt is hard to be in a house where loudness is a constant and having to study through it is quite difficult.\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parents)\nAdditionally, increased family responsibilities compromised students\u2019 academics. For example, an undocumented student wrote, \u201cMy life these past months in quarantine has solely been taking care of my siblings; I feed them, clean the apartment, deal with their difficult tempers, and make sure they are doing schoolwork.\u201d Most commonly, family responsibilities included providing childcare and remote learning support for siblings as well as household chores. These academic distractions were slightly more pronounced among\nundocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents."

However, undocumented students and US citizen students with undocumented parents were more likely to note social isolation felt from not being able to interact in-person with the campus community:\n\u201cI do not feel as connected to some of my professors.

            "text": "Our analysis revealed five ways that immigration status affected students\u2019 ability to manage pandemic stressors: no stimulus checks, no unemployment benefits, limited access to healthcare, limited access to social safety net programs, and no education relief grants. Table\u00a05 reports the frequency of these analytic codes. Nearly half (51.2%, n=173) of undocumented students reported one of these forms of immigration status-related exclusion from resources that would aid them. US citizens followed closely behind with 41.7% (n=150) reporting this, often linking their fate with those of their undocumented family members. In a few cases (5.1%, n=13), US citizens with lawfully present parents pointed to their undocumented extended family members\u2019 exclusion.\nOverwhelmingly, undocumented students and citizens with undocumented parents cited their exclusion from federal coronavirus relief efforts when asked if their own or family members\u2019 immigrant origin affected their pandemic experiences. For example, an undocumented student wrote, \u201cMy parents and I being undocumented has affected our lives during this pandemic because we are not getting any\nhelp from the government. My little sisters are both US citizens but they\u2019re essentially being forgotten about for having immigrant parents.\u201d Both groups highlighted how undocumented immigrants and their US citizen family members were excluded from this economic relief. A few undocumented students also noted that they were not eligible for emergency education grants due to their immigration status.\nUndocumented students, followed by US citizens with undocumented parents, also cited their exclusion from preexisting social safety nets because of their undocumented status, which endangered their ability to successfully manage financial stressors.\n\u201cBeing [undocumented] immigrants means none of us are eligible for unemployment. This is something difficult to see as others in our same jobs are eligible and seeing them get unemployment checks is a reminder of our marginality\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cMy parents also cannot apply for unemployment or food stamps because all are undocumented, and do not want to be a public charge.\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parents)\nIneligibility for unemployment benefits was mentioned by about one in five undocumented students and one in ten citizens with undocumented parents. Other social services, specifically government-funded food access programs, were mentioned less frequently.\nLastly, about one in seven undocumented students and one in ten citizens with undocumented parents noted that ineligibility for health insurance exacerbated virus stressors. One citizen with undocumented parents wrote, \u201cI simply worry that if my parents get sick we won\u2019t be able to afford the correct medical treatment necessary since they do not have insurance due to their legal status.\u201d Additionally, these students spoke to the fear of experiencing unfair treatment, discrimination, and deportation risk if they interacted with the healthcare system:\n291\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\n\u201cWe feel that around this time, ICE and such organizations will be more present and hospitals and healthcare facilities\u201d (Undocumented student) \u201cI fear that if one of my parents \u2026 contract the coronavirus, they will be denied medical service or given poor service because of their legal status\u2026 They also do not have health insurance, so on top of not being treated fairly, they will have an immense bill to pay if they are treated in a hospital\u201d (US citizen with undocumented parents)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "We examined whether self and parental immigration status contributed to differences in Latina/o/x college students\u2019 mental health and pandemic stressors during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative analyses revealed that the pandemic produced widespread negative mental health effects with no differences by self/parental immigration status for this group. Qualitative analyses identified four types of pandemic stressors: financial insecurity, COVID-19 virus concerns, academic strains, and social dynamics. Comparisons across self/parental immigration status revealed that many stressors are shared; however, undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents reported some stressors more frequently and highlighted unique aspects of others. Finally, self and parental immigration status was salient in students\u2019 perceptions of their ability to manage these pandemic stressors because undocumented status prevented them from accessing necessary resources.\nWe found high levels of negative mental health effects due to the pandemic. Nearly all students reported that their health was negatively affected by the pandemic with slightly more than half reporting \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal.\u201d Regression analyses revealed no statistically significant group differences in the severity of effects. Thus, despite unique stressors, it does not appear that Latina/o/x undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents fared worse in their mental health effects. These findings are consistent with a prior study which found no group differences among a racially diverse sample [28]. This suggests that while Latinas/os/xs may have been experiencing unique racist-nativist discourses and disproportionate stressors during the pandemic, these did not alter the relationship between self/family immigration-status and mental health effects of the pandemic. Another reason for a lack of group differences may be that undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents experienced stress inoculation as they already contended with related stressors prior to the pandemic due to their legal vulnerability [28, 36]. Indeed, prior research suggests that undocumented students\nnormalize their mental health strain [37]. Finally, given the sudden social shock inflicted by the pandemic and the drastic changes it caused to everyday life, it stands to reason that all three student groups would report elevated negative mental health effects. Our qualitative data suggests that some stressors, such as those related to remote learning and social dynamics, were mentioned with similar frequency across the three groups of students. These shared experiences with remote learning and social isolation indicate shared sources of stress as students were all forced to remain in their households due to safer-at-home orders.\nDespite this, self and parental immigration status does appear to differentiate the pandemic stressors experienced by students. Financial insecurity stressors were by far the most common across all three groups, reflecting the immediate and severe economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. Notably, this stressor was substantially more frequent among undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents, particularly as it relates to job loss and reduced work hours. Undocumented students, followed by US citizens with undocumented parents, were also more likely to report material deprivation and having a limited safety net to weather income loss. The similarities between these two groups stem from the reality that they share legal vulnerabilities at the family level. Specifically, both groups have undocumented parents and family members who have precarious employment due to a lack of work authorization [38]. Further, undocumented workers are overrepresented in industries that were shut down and/or curtailed by stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the disease, compromising their potential to earn income [39], [40]. Indeed, undocumented men saw the steepest increase in job loss compared to USborn and documented immigrant men, climbing from 4.5% pre-pandemic to 31.9% in spring 2020 [41]. Further, undocumented immigrants earn less than their documented peers pre-pandemic, increasing the likelihood that they did not have the savings needed to weather economic losses [38]. Although this stressor was less frequent among US citizens with lawfully present parents, almost half reported at least one financial insecurity stressor. This reflects the reality that citizens with lawfully present parents can also be members of low-income families given the persistence of a substantial wage gap for Latina/o/x immigrants more broadly [42]. Thus, while stressors may be shared across groups in this study, the source of the stressor may be traced back to different types of structural vulnerabilities.\nSelf and parental immigration status also contributed to legal vulnerabilities that prompted unique stressors among undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents. For example, virus concerns highlighted unique employment-related exposure risk. Indeed, estimates reveal that nearly three in four undocumented workers held \u201cessential\u201d jobs at the beginning of the pandemic, suggesting that\n292\n1 3\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\nthey were at increased risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus [43]. Further, infection fears established cascading infection concerns due to cramped living situations and limited healthcare access due to undocumented status. Although remote learning struggles and disruptive family dynamics were reported by all three student groups, undocumented students and citizens with undocumented parents faced additional academic and social stressors related to crowded living situations and being cut off from their university campuses. Prior research has established that undocumented immigrants and their families are more likely to live in overcrowded living situations [44]. This reality translated into limited access to quiet study space and constrained ability to escape toxic family dynamics.\nPrior research has established that undocumented immigration status is one of many fundamental causes of health disparities because it constrains access to resources that can protect one\u2019s health [17]. Building on this body of literature, we show how the marginalized social status of undocumented immigrants contributed to the proliferation of pandemic stressors. Further, the exclusion of undocumented immigrants and mixed-status families from relief efforts and social services directly constrained the resources available to manage stressors. Most prominently, students highlighted how federal pandemic relief excluded undocumented immigrants and their citizen family members from receiving aid, explicitly denying them access to financial resources needed to help weather the economic crisis. Further, undocumented immigrants\u2019 exclusion from social safety nets (e.g., unemployment benefits, government food assistance programs) and limited healthcare access compromised students\u2019 and family\u2019s ability to access resources to mitigate financial and infection stressors.\nOverall, the findings highlight the importance of examining underlying processes as disparities may not be immediately evident in health outcomes. As illustrated by the quantitative analysis, mental health outcomes were extremely high in the early months of the pandemic for all groups. However, the qualitative data uncovers which stressors are shared among all students and which are unique to undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents. Notably, many of the shared stressors\u2014remote education and social isolation\u2014have been addressed with a return to in-person experiences due to the development of vaccines and better public health knowledge. However, the stressors most common among students who are undocumented or have undocumented parents\u2014financial strains, virus exposure, and access to healthcare\u2014are likely to persist for a longer period as communities continue to reel from the pandemic\u2019s long-term economic and health effects. Given these differences, it may be that immigration-related mental health disparities may emerge in later phases of the pandemic as\ninitial disruptions recede but longer-term consequences persist.\nOur study had some limitations. Foremost, our qualitative data is composed of short-answer responses to two write-in survey questions. We do not ask specifically about individuals\u2019 mental health stressors and so are also unable to infer the prevalence of each stressor because we did not systematically ask about each type of stressor. The brief responses suggest that respondents focused on a few of the most immediate stressors, possibly contributing to the low frequency of some stressors. The brief responses also limit our ability to ascertain details about the processes through which these stressors affect students\u2019 mental health. Secondly, about three-quarters of the undocumented students reported being DACA recipients and may not adequately document the depth of legal vulnerabilities experienced by undocumented students with no legal status. Finally, our study took place in California which is a relatively inclusive policy context for undocumented immigrants; stressors related to legal vulnerability may be distinct in other policy contexts."

            "text": "Our study examines the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s early toll on the mental health of a vulnerable and understudied population: Latina/o/x children of immigrants with varying self and parental immigration status. It draws on a novel large-scale survey that is the first we are aware of to collect detailed personal and parental information and COVIDrelated outcomes in this population. Although the mental health outcomes do not indicate elevated risks for Latina/o/x undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents, we find that their stressors and coping resources are unique. This suggests that the high-stress nature of the pandemic may elevate distress across the board but the structural exclusion of certain groups contributes to unique stress processes.\nOur findings indicate the importance of recognizing structural inequalities when identifying sources of stress and coping responses, especially among young people who are undocumented or have undocumented family members. Their legal vulnerabilities increased exposure to pandemic stressors, created unique types of stressors, and constrained access to resources to help alleviate stressors. While interventions aimed at managing stress may help, clinicians must be aware of and openly acknowledge the structural constraints that may limit their effectiveness. Indeed, prior research has established that mental health service seeking among undocumented students is compromised by perceived inefficacy of services to address such larger structural problems [37]. Thus, structural interventions should\n293\n1 3\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:282\u2013295\nalso be developed along with individual-level interventions aimed at improving mental health access and services. This includes policy interventions that will address underlying legal vulnerabilities and aid immigrants in protecting their health, both during and beyond the pandemic: access to social safety nets, affordable healthcare, and ultimately a pathway to legalization. Educational institutions must also support students\u2019 mental health by increasing their access to resources and establishing policies that take into account students\u2019 divergent access to resources, including space, technology, and time.\nFunding This study was supported by the University of California Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives (MRI-19-601090) and UC Irvine Office of Inclusive Excellence.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
