    "abstractText": "Using Earth observation to accurately extract snow phenology changes is of great significance for deepening the understanding of the ecological environment and hydrological process, agricultural and animal husbandry production, and high-quality development of the social economy in Xinjiang. Considering snow cover phenology based on MODIS product MOD10A1 data, this paper constructed a method for automatically extracting key phenological parameters in Xinjiang and calculated three key phenological parameters in Xinjiang from 2001 to 2020, including SCD (snow cover duration), SOD (snow onset date), and SED (snow end date). The daily data of four field camera observation points during an overlapping period from 2017 to 2019 were used to evaluate the snow cover phenological parameters extracted by MOD10A1, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.65 and 1.07, respectively. The results showed the following: 1. The spatiotemporal variation in snow phenology was highly altitude dependent. The mean gradients of SCD in the Altai Mountains, Tienshan Mountains, and Kunlun Mountains is 2.6, 2.1, and 1.2 d/100 m, respectively. The variation trend of snow phenology with latitude and longitude was mainly related to the topography of Xinjiang. Snow phenological parameters of different land-use types were different. The SCD values in wasteland were the lowest and the SED was the earliest, while forest land was the first to enter SOD accumulation. According to the study, the mean annual values of SCD, SOD, and SED were 25, 342 (8 December), and 51 (8 February) as day of year (DOY), respectively. The snow cover area was mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains, Junggar Basin, Tianshan Mountains, and Kunlun Mountains. 2. The variation trend and significance of snow cover phenological parameters in different regions are different, and the variation trend of snow cover phenological parameters in most regions of Xinjiang is non-significant.",

            "text": "As the most widely distributed factor of the cryosphere and the most sensitive to interannual variation, snow cover is an important factor affecting the global climate [1]. Like in most arid and semi-arid zones, snowmelt provides an important proportion of the fresh water in Xinjiang, China [2]. Snow cover phenology, including SCD (snow cover duration), SOD (snow onset date), and SED (snow end date), is an important index to measure the characteristics of snow cover change, which has an important impact on the seasonal changes of terrestrial ecosystems, especially on the phenology of alpine\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15061474 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 2 of 19\nvegetation [3,4]. Early snow melt can lead to significant changes in the timing and flow of spring snowmelt runoff, potentially increasing the incidence of events such as floods and droughts [5]. During the winter, snow helps agriculture by trapping heat from the surface and thereby protecting crops (mainly winter wheat) from low-temperature frosts [6]. Therefore, taking Xinjiang as the research area, studying the spatiotemporal variation in snow phenology is of great significance for regional and even global climate change, water resource management, vegetation growth [7], sustainable development, and the prediction of catastrophic climate events [8]. Since the last century, a significant amount of research has been carried out on snow information extraction using remote sensing technology on the regional and even global scale [9\u201313]. Remote sensing data, with the characteristics of multi-scale, multi-temporal, multi-spectral, and multi-level, provide a high-quality data source for the study of snow cover in high-altitude mountainous areas [14\u201318]. The result shows that SCD has decreased in the global mountains. It is necessary to understand the snow cover dynamics and prepare for the future changes of global snow cover resources [19,20]. Most research on the progress of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere [21\u201328] has found that the SCD has shortened in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere. In the Arctic, the snow cover in June is declining at a rate of 13.6% per decade. In North and South America, the SCD peak time has moved 0.6 days earlier every 10 years [29\u201332]. In Eurasia, the spatial range of snow cover in spring and summer has decreased significantly, and the time when snow begins to disappear in spring has significantly advanced [33\u201335]. In recent years, the information sources of snow cover have diversified, and station and satellite data have become important resources. Remote sensing data and ground observation data are used to analyze the distribution characteristics and spatiotemporal characteristics of snow cover [36\u201338]. The snow product synthesized by MODIS provides long time series, high precision spatial snow cover distribution information, and spatial surface temperature information and has the advantages of convenient and quick data acquisition, making the data one of the best sources for large-scale snow cover research. These data have been widely used in snow cover research [39]. The accuracy of the surface albedo products of MODIS V005 and V006 are compared globally using the ground station data, and it is concluded that the overall accuracy of V006 is higher than that of V005 [40,41]. An update of the MOD10A1 snow product may supply a more accurate option for this field. Liu [42] took three research areas in southwest Xinjiang as examples to evaluate the accuracy of MOD10A1 and found that the average overall accuracy of MOD10A1 reached 82%. Chen and his team [43] obtained that the average time of SCD, SOD, and SED of snow phenological parameters in the Tianshan Mountains was 113.9, 331.2, and 81, and the average gradient of SCD, SOD, and SED with elevation was 6.0, \u22122.55, and 3.44 d/100 m, respectively. With high accuracy, MOD10A1 can extract snow information in different terrains. The MODIS product has provided clues that assist in understanding the dynamics of snow change. Compared with other long time series data, MODIS has a higher resolution, and the advantage of long time series is mostly used by researchers. The above studies mainly focus on the changes of snow cover extent and snow cover days [44\u201349], while less attention is paid to the spatiotemporal changes of the onset and melting time of snow cover. In addition, different geographical locations have different snow cover conditions, but most studies only focus on snow cover information in mountains [50\u201352] or large spatial patterns [53]. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the snow cover phenological pattern and trend change in different geographical units in the whole Xinjiang region. However, there are difficulties in the accurate calculation of SOD and SED in snow phenological parameters, especially the influence of instantaneous snow cover in early winter. Moreover, the definition of snow phenological parameters is different, and the extraction methods are different. The objective of this study is to use a new method to calculate the snow phenological parameters of SCD (snow cover duration), SOD (snow onset date), and SED (snow end date) from 2001 to 2020. We use the daily data of four field camera observation points to verify and evaluate the snow phenological parameters\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 3 of 19\nextracted by MOD10A1. Then, the phenological pattern and trend changes in different elevation regions and geographical units in the entire Xinjiang region were analyzed."

Study Area\nXinjiang, the largest province in China by land area, is located between 73\u00b040\u2032~96\u00b018\u2032E and 34\u00b025\u2032~48\u00b010\u2032N. It is in the hinterland of Eurasia. With complex terrain and climate patterns, Xinjiang boasts a variety of unique landforms and ecosystems of diverse types [54]. The altitude is \u2212190 m~7538 m, with major differences in altitude. The high altitude and unique geographical location provide good climatic conditions for the development of snow and glaciers in the mountainous areas of Xinjiang. A change of snow cover is related to the life, industry, and irrigation water in Xinjiang [55]. According to the geographical topography and ecological environment of the study area, regional differences of snow phenological parameters were studied (Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

The accuracy of MOD10A1 products in the middle Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang was evaluated by the field camera image data. DEM: To explore the relationship between snow phenology and elevation variations, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were derived from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission). Spatial resolution was 90 m and data format was Geo-TIFF [57]. The absolute vertical height accuracy was reported to be less than 16 m, while the horizontal accuracy was 20 m [58]. The advantage of SRTM is its consistency in data collection and analysis; thus, data quality is homogeneous. The resolution of DEM (90 m) data was aggregated to 500 m to match the spatial resolution of the snow cover data. MCD12Q1: The MODIS Land Cover Type Product (MCD12Q1) provides a suite of science data sets (SDSs) that map global land cover at 500 m spatial resolution at annual time steps for six different land cover legends; the MCD12Q1 International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) includes a legend and class descriptions. The influence of underlying cover on snow phenological parameters was discussed, and 17 main land cover types were combined into several categories for unified calculation (15 snow and ice deletions) (Table 1). Using the MCD12Q1_v06 IGBP data set from 2001 to 2020, ARCGIS was used to analyze the land-use types that did not change during 2001 to 2020, and these unchanged land data and snow phenological parameter data were used for statistical analysis."

            "text": "2.3.1. Three Published Methods for Snow Cover Phenology Extraction\nThe definitions of snow phenological parameters are different, and the extraction methods are also different. Table 2 summarizes three common methods. The first two methods are to obtain snow parameters from remote sensing images, and the last one is the method traditionally used in China. In these three methods of snow cover phenology extraction, Wang and Xie\u2019s method set two special time periods to calculate the SOD and SED. If there is snow cover outside the specified time, the snow cover date in areas cannot be detected. Their results showed that the overall agreement between the SCD and site observations was 90%, and the SOD or the SED had a good agreement, with a mean of one week earlier or one week later, respectively. However, after GAO\u2019s evaluation, there are some differences in snow phenological parameters in complex study areas, mainly because the SOD and the SED in snow could not be found outside the set site date. These assumptions are applicable to study areas in special areas but need to be carefully considered for study areas with transitional complex terrain and high altitude.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 5 of 19\nGAO\u2019s Method 2 was applied to the low cloud MODISMC8 map to obtain snow cover parameters by setting different conditions in different periods. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, the differences of SCD, SOD, and SED were 70%, 72%, and 55%, respectively. The performance of this method is better than GAO\u2019s Method 1 and Wang and Xie. However, the accuracy of the Wang and Xie methods was higher in northern Xinjiang. The method of Phenological Observation Methods in China is the traditional method snow parameters are obtained by field observation. However, the measurement sites cannot provide large-scale regional and global scale data because their spatial density is low, the sites are not continuous, even in hard-to-reach areas, and the sites are mostly located in human activity areas and low-altitude zones, so there are many gaps in the data of periods and regions where no phenological observation sites have been established. Therefore, different regions adapt to different snow phenology extraction methods, so we put forward a new method to calculate snow phenology by taking advantage of the complex geographical terrain of Xinjiang and then verified our method.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 6 of 19\n2.3.2. A New Method for Extracting Snow Phenological Parameters\nBased on the temperate continental climate and unique topographic conditions in Xinjiang, there are temperature differences in the four seasons, with obvious seasonality. Combining the changes of different geographical regions, this study proposed an algorithm suitable for snow phenology retrieval in Xinjiang. Snow cover phenological parameters were extracted in a calendar year (starting in January and ending in December), which was convenient for quantification and analysis of the annual snow accumulation period. A hydrological year is defined as 1 August of the current year to 31 July of the following year. After the snow cover phenological parameters were obtained, the changes of snow cover phenological parameters were converted into hydrological year dates for analysis. SCD: In the NDSI_Snow_Cover data set, records with pixels ranging from 1 to 100 are recorded as snow, and other values are recorded as free snow. In the annual pixel time series, SCD is the number of pixels whose pixel value is 1\u2013100.\nSCD = N\n\u2211 0 Di (1)\nSOD: In the pixel-by-pixel time series, the time series of each pixel was extracted from the calendar year from 1 January to 31 December. In the obtained time series of snow cover, the larger of the values of the two snow cover days (Julian days) with the biggest difference between the two days before and after the snow cover days is the SOD. SED: In the pixel-by-pixel time series, the time series of each pixel was extracted from the calendar year from 1 January to 31 December. In the obtained time series of snow cover, the smaller of the values of the two snow cover days (Julian days) with the biggest difference between the two days before and after the snow cover days is the SED (Figure 2).\ngap(x) = indexx \u2212 indexx\u22121 x \u2208 (2, SCD) (2)\nx\u2032 = arg max gap(x) (3)\nSOD = indexx\u2032 (4)\nSED = indexx\u2032\u22121 (5)\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20\nSnow phenological parameters of three different extraction methods were compared in detail (Figure 3) for January 2016 to 31 December 2017.

These observation sites were characterized by high altitude and less interference from human activities, which provides important data support for accuracy verification of snow products in mountainous areas.

Spatiotemporal Variation in Snow Phenology in Xinjiang The change trend analysis and significance test of the SCD, SOD, and SED in the study area from 2001 to 2020 were carried out (Figure 9), and the trend change of snow phenology parameters in the Xinjiang region (Table 4) and the proportion of the area with a significant trend were calculated. The snow phenology in most areas showed a nonsignificant change (Figure 9). Some areas showed significant changes. The SCD in most areas of the study area showed a non-significant shortening trend (Figure 9a,b), while 8.49% of Xinjiang showed a significant decrease in the Junggar Basin and southern Xinjiang, with a shortening rate of about 0.67 \ud835\udc51 \u2219 \ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05). A total of 1.44% of Xinjiang had a significant lengthening trend, and the lengthening rate was about 0.97 \ud835\udc51 \u2219 \ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05) , distributed in the central Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains. In southern Xinjiang, 1.96% of the SCD showed a significant increase trend (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05). For the whole study area, there was an insignificant decrease in SCD at 0.12 \ud835\udc51 \u2219 \ud835\udc4e (Table 4), which was related to the advance of the SED.\nThe SOD was significantly advanced in 1.75% of the Xinjiang region (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05) (Figure 9c,d) (Table 4), with an advance rate of 2.35 \ud835\udc51 \u2219 \ud835\udc4e , mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains, the Junggar Basin, the central Tianshan Mountains, and the area where the Kunlun Mountains meet the Tarim Basin (Figure 9c,d). The SOD was significantly delayed in 1.32% of the region (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05), with a rate of about 3 \ud835\udc51 \u2219 \ud835\udc4e , mainly distributed in the Kunlun Mountains, the northeastern Tarim Basin, and the eastern margin of the Junggar Basin.

The rate of SOD in the Altai Mountains was 0.33 \ud835\udc51/\ud835\udc4e ahead of that in other regions\nFigure 8.

In southern Xinjiang, 1.96% of the SCD showed a significant increase trend (p < 0.05). For the whole study area, there was an insignificant decrease in SCD at 0.12 d\u00b7a\u22121 (Table 4), which was related to the advance of the SED. The SOD was significantly advanced in 1.75% of the Xinjiang region (p < 0.05) (Figure 9c,d) (Table 4), with an advance rate of 2.35 d\u00b7a\u22121, mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains, the Junggar Basin, the central Tianshan Mountains, and the area where the Kunlun Mountains meet the Tarim Basin (Figure 9c,d). The SOD was significantly delayed in 1.32% of the region (p < 0.05), with a rate of about 3 d\u00b7a\u22121, mainly distributed in the Kunlun Mountains, the northeastern Tarim Basin, and the eastern margin of the Junggar Basin. The SOD in the Tarim Basin and the Kunlun Mountains was postponed at the rates of 0.02 d/a and 0.12 d/a, respectively, but the trend change was not significant. The rate of SOD in the Altai Mountains was 0.33 d/a ahead of that in other regions According to the trend and spatial distribution of SED significance (Figure 9e,f), the SED showed a significant advance in 2.38% of the Xinjiang region (p < 0.05) (Table 4), mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains area, the Junggar Basin area, the western part of the Tianshan area and Tarim Basin, the Kunlun Mountains area, and the Tarim Basin, with an advance rate of 2.47 d\u00b7a\u22121.

Snow phenology in mountainous areas is closely related to altitude. Figure 10 shows the calculated 20-year histogram of the snow phenology trend. Areas with perennial snow cover were not included in the calculation to avoid errors in mixing seasonal and permanent snow cover.

The trend analysis showed that the SCD trend of the Altai Mountains increased with the decrease in altitude in the altitude area less than 1500 m and increased with the increase in altitude between 1500 m and 2500 m. The trend of the SCD and SOD in the Tianshan area reached the maximum at 3000 m and was delayed by the regional SED at 3000 m.

The SCD of Wang and Xie\u2019s method was 90% consistent with the observation of the site, and SOD or SED had a good consistency, with an average of one week in advance or one week in delay, respectively. The accuracy of snow phenological parameters of our newly proposed method was compared with the real-time camera data, and it was found that SOD and SED had a difference of 0 to 3 days with the realtime camera data. Although there was a cloud effect, the effect on SOD and SED was small. Even if some of them did have bias, the bias should be relatively constant every year. Therefore, the time series of these snow cover parameters enables us to study the trend changes of these parameters. Snow cover begins earlier in the mountains, melts later, and lasts longer, and there are fewer snow days in the basins, where snow starts late or is even delayed until the following year. Therefore, after comparison, different regions adapt different snow phenological extraction methods, which needs further evaluation and comparison. For example, one method is used to extract snow phenological parameters in mountainous areas, and another method is used in basin plain areas. It is expected that these methods of extracting snow cover parameters will enable us to study the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover in more detail.\nIn the context of global warming, the spatial variation in snow cover phenology in Xinjiang is consistent with the decrease in snow cover area in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere [47]. For example, Hori\u2019s study showed a weak shortening trend in the duration of snow cover in eastern Asia and western and northern North America from 1978 to 2015 [65]. Chen and his team studied the SCD in the Tianshan region of Central Asia and showed an inconspicuous upward trend during 2002\u20132017, but the SCD decreased, the SOD was delayed, and the SED was delayed in 38.6% of the region, mainly in the central and eastern part of the Xinjiang Tianshan Mountains [43]. This was consistent with the results obtained by Hu [66] in studying the changes of the SOD and SED in arid and semi-arid areas of Xinjiang.\nGeomorphology has an important effect on the snow phenology in Xinjiang; the elevation and underlying surface type play a key role in the distribution of the snow phenology.

In the context of global warming, the spatial variation in snow cover phenology in Xinjiang is consistent with the decrease in snow cover area in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere [47]. For example, Hori\u2019s study showed a weak shortening trend in the duration of snow cover in eastern Asia and western and northern North America from 1978 to 2015 [65]. Chen and his team studied the SCD in the Tianshan region of Central Asia and showed an inconspicuous upward trend during 2002\u20132017, but the SCD decreased, the SOD was delayed, and the SED was delayed in 38.6% of the region, mainly in the central and eastern part of the Xinjiang Tianshan Mountains [43]. This was consistent with the results obtained by Hu [66] in studying the changes of the SOD and SED in arid and semi-arid areas of Xinjiang. Geomorphology has an important effect on the snow phenology in Xinjiang; the elevation and underlying surface type play a key role in the distribution of the snow phenology. For high altitude areas, there is a strong linear relationship between snow phenology and altitude, and every 100 m increase in the SCD requires 1.2\u20132.6 d (Figure 6), indicating that the change of the SCD is highly dependent on altitude. At the same time, the trend analysis showed that the response of snow phenology at high and low altitudes presented a contrast, and the mountain areas of Xinjiang maintained a negative trend in the change of altitude trend (Figure 10a). In the latitude direction (Figure 7), the SCD anomalies appeared in the Junggar Basin at 46\u25e6~48\u25e6N because the elevation at 47\u25e6N was higher than the surrounding surface. Secondly, it may be that because there are more cities between the Tianshan Mountains and the Junggar Basin, human activities are more frequent, and the SCD is less. The higher the latitude, the less human intervention, resulting in the increase of the SCD. In the longitude direction of the study area, the SCD decreased, the SOD delayed, and the SED advanced with the increase of longitude. The reason for the great change of snow phenological parameters in the longitude direction was the change of topography in the study area. The greater the longitude, the lower the average altitude was. Among them, the SCD of 86\u25e6~88\u25e6E increased, which was due to the elevation of Altai Mountain from low to high in the range of 86\u25e6~88\u25e6E. Under the influence of different land-use types, soil surface and soil temperature, and moisture change, vegetation can reflect solar radiation. Different land-use types obtain different amounts of solar radiation, and the amount of solar radiation directly affects the temperature level, affecting snow accumulation and melting time in the region. Snow accumulation in wasteland was the latest, the SOD was later than forest land and grassland, and the SED was also much earlier than other land types, which resulted in the shortest SCD in wasteland, which was also one of the reasons for the lowest SCD in the Tarim Basin. The number of days with snow cover was the largest in forest land, and the SOD and SED were earlier and later than other land types, respectively. This may be due to the influence of factors, such as local climate convection in forest land. The forest canopy has the function of heat preservation and moisture, and the decrease of wind speed slows down the rate of snow melt, which makes the number of days with snow cover in woodland higher than other land types. A new method for calculating snow phenology is proposed in this paper, but there is still potential for further improvement, especially in areas with perennial snow cover\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 16 of 19\nand less snow cover. At the same time, the accuracy of some current cloud elimination methods is not clear, so the cloud factor is not considered in this paper. However, it is the direction of further efforts to verify the current cloud removal methods with more phenological cameras or to develop cloud removal methods with higher accuracy. Of course, before this, this method will have a certain impact on the identification of snow cover days. However, ongoing challenges, such as the impact of heavily shaded areas on snow cover judgment and scale differences between the phenological camera and MODIS products, will continue to accompany the development of this study. At the same time, the analysis of the correlation between climate and snow phenology is also a very meaningful direction of work, which needs to be explored by researchers."

            "text": "1. We proposed a snow phenology extraction method based on MOD10A1, combined with the temperate continental climate and unique terrain conditions in Xinjiang, and proposed an algorithm suitable for snow phenology retrieval in Xinjiang. The difference between the proposed snow phenological parameters and the snow phenological parameters of the four field camera observation points was 1\u20133 days, and the calculated mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.65 and 1.07, respectively. 2. According to this research, the snow cover area is mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains, the Junggar Basin, the Tianshan District, and the Kunlun Mountains, accounting for 80.72% of the total area of the study area. The area with the SCD of more than 100 days accounted for 5.15% of the total area of the study area, and the area with the SCD of less than 30 days accounted for 70.98%. The mean annual values of the SCD, SOD, and SED were 25, 342 (8 December), and 51 (8 February) in the day of year (DOY), respectively. In the mountainous areas, the SCD was in early September, the occurrence of SOD was in November and later in the Junggar Basin, the occurrence of SED was in January to June, and the occurrence of SED was in March and before in the two basins. For high-altitude mountains, it was delayed until May and beyond. Below the altitude of 2000 m, the SCD rising trend was slow with the increase in altitude, and the SCD rising trend was faster when the altitude exceeded 2000 m. The lower the elevation of the SOD, the later the SOD, and the higher the elevation, the later the SED. The snow cover phenological parameters in the mountain region showed an obvious elevation gradient. The mean gradient of the SCD in the Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains is 2.6 d, 2.1 d, and 1.2 d/100 m, respectively. The snow phenological parameters fluctuate greatly with latitude and longitude. Two inflection points with large fluctuation were found in the analysis of longitude variation of phenological parameters, which may be related to the vertical zonality of the study area. The fluctuation of snow cover days of different land-use types remained stable during the study period. The snow cover days of wasteland were the least, while the snow cover days of woodland were the most; woodland was the first to enter the state of snow accumulation, and the snow cover days of wasteland were the earliest. 3. The SOD was significantly advanced in 1.75% of Xinjiang (p < 0.05), and the advance rate was about 2.35 d\u00b7a\u22121. The SOD was significantly delayed in 1.32% of the region (p < 0.05) at a rate of about 3 d\u00b7a\u22121. The SED was significantly advanced in 2.38% of Xinjiang (p < 0.05), and the advance rate was 2.47 d\u00b7a\u22121, while the SED was significantly delayed in 1.01% of the Xinjiang region, and the advance rate was about 3.44 d d\u00b7a\u22121. The SCD decreased significantly in 8.49% of Xinjiang, in the Junggar Basin, and in southern Xinjiang, and the shortening rate was about 0.67 d\u00b7a\u22121. The SCD in 1.44% of Xinjiang showed a significant lengthening trend, and the lengthening rate was about 0.97 d\u00b7a\u22121. For the whole of Xinjiang, the SCD showed an insignificant decreasing trend at 0.12 d\u00b7a\u22121, which was mainly related to the advance of the SED.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1474 17 of 19\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.M. and J.L.; methodology, Q.W. and Y.M.; software, Q.W. and Y.M.; validation, Q.W. and Y.M.; formal analysis, Q.W.; investigation, Y.M.; resources, Q.W., Y.M. and J.L.; data curation, Q.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Q.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.M. and J.L.; visualization, Q.W.; supervision, Y.M.; project administration, Y.M. and J.L.; funding acquisition, Y.M. and J.L.
