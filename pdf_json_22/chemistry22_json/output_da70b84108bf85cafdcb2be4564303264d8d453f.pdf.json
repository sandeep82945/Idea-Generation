    "abstractText": "The present study describes the synthesis, characterization, and investigation of catalytic activity of xanthine\u2010Ni complex (Xa\u2010Ni) and 4\u2010phenylthiosemicarbazide\u2010Cu complex (PTSC\u2010Cu) incorporated into functionalized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS/Pr\u2010Xa\u2010Ni and HMS/Pr\u2010PTSC\u2010Cu). These useful mesoporous catalysts had been synthesized and identified using various techniques such as FT\u2010IR, XRD, adsorption\u2013desorption of nitrogen, SEM, TEM, EDX\u2010Map, TGA, AAS and ICP. These spectral techniques successfully confirmed the synthesis of the mesoporous catalysts. The catalytic activity of HMS/Pr\u2010a\u2010Ni (Catalyst A) and HMS/Pr\u2010PTSC\u2010Cu (Catalyst B) were evaluated for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and 1,4\u2010dihydropyrano[2,3\u2010c]pyrazole derivatives. HMS/Pr\u2010PTSC\u2010Cu exhibited higher efficiency in green media under milder reaction condition at room temperature. Furthermore, the synthesized nanocatalysts, exhibited appropriate recoverability that can be able to reuse for several times without significant loss of catalytic activity.",

These useful mesoporous catalysts had been synthesized and identified using various techniques such as FT\u2011IR, XRD, adsorption\u2013desorption of nitrogen, SEM, TEM, EDX\u2011Map, TGA, AAS and ICP. These spectral techniques successfully confirmed the synthesis of the mesoporous catalysts. The catalytic activity of HMS/Pr\u2011a\u2011Ni (Catalyst A) and HMS/Pr\u2011PTSC\u2011Cu (Catalyst B) were evaluated for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and 1,4\u2011dihydropyrano[2,3\u2011c]pyrazole derivatives. HMS/Pr\u2011PTSC\u2011Cu exhibited higher efficiency in green media under milder reaction condition at room temperature. Furthermore, the synthesized nanocatalysts, exhibited appropriate recoverability that can be able to reuse for several times without significant loss of catalytic activity.\nIn recent years, with the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, attractive possibilities emerged for synthesis of various new silica catalysts. Mesoporous silica (2\u00a0nm < pore diameters > 50\u00a0nm), is the most popular mesoporous molecular material1 that due to their structural characteristics, such as high surface areas and pore volumes, have found variety applications, such as adsorbents, catalyst supports, drug delivery systems and biosensors2. Among those mesoporous materials, hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) with wormlike mesoporosity, uniform and narrow pore size distribution, high surface area and pore volume, short channel, thermal stability, easily synthesized and functionalized has found promising applications as a support for synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts3,4. In addition, HMS easily synthesis using a cheaper primary alkylamine5 at room temperature and pH-independent condition, which makes the method robust, reproducible and industrially possible6\nAlso, in opposite of MCM and SBA mesoporous silica, HMS has indicated commendable outputs in the catalysis research area6. Design and development of multicomponent synthetic strategies which are in accordance with the principle of green chemistry and using novel and heterogenous catalyst led to the integration of a variety of novelty in their line of investigation7.\nRecently, the researches regarding synthesis and characterization of metal modified HMS mesoporous materials published in the literature such as: NiMoW/HMS and NiMoW/Al-HMS8, Cu-Ag/HMS9, FeC4Pc-HMS10, HMS-CPTMS-Cy-Pd4 and HMS/Pr-Rh-Zr11. In these articles, HMS was applied as an efficient support for synthesis of novel catalysts, that promoted the rate of reaction.\nOPEN\n1Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Ilam University, P.O.

This synthetic strategy does not need to separation and purification of the intermediates. In comparison to traditional multistep protocols, one-pot multi-component reactions have both economic and environmental benefits such as decreasing time, saving costs, energy12, increasing atom economy7, reducing waste production, high efficiency and experimental simplicity13. Therefore, they are economically and environmentally suitable methodology12 and often proceed with excellent chemoselectivities13.\nPyranopyrazole compounds, oxygen- and nitrogen-ring fused heterocycles, have become important due to their pharmacological and biological properties14. Additionally, pyrazole and its derivatives find applications as biodegradable agrochemicals13. Among the medicinal properties of these compounds can be mentioned to anti-inflammatory15, antioxidant16, anti-bacterial17 and anti-tubercular agents18.\nAlso, benzopyran and its derivatives as one of the important groups of compounds, have appealed to researchers. Their biological and medicinal properties led to attracting much attention. These heterocyclic frameworks existence in structure of some of the natural products and applied in treatment of disease such as Schizophrenia, Myoclonus, Alzheimer, Huntington, Parkinson, AIDS-associated dementia and Down syndrome19\u201322. Additionally, another application of benzopyran derivatives consists of using in perfumes, cosmetics, agrochemicals and in food as additives23, photoactive materials19 and pigments24.\nThus, in continuation of our ongoing research4,25\u201327, considering the importance of these heterocyclic compounds, we sought to find the effect of new synthesized catalysts for the preparation of these biologically valuable heterocycles."

Then, HMS was functionalized by 3\u2010chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and HMS/Pr was obtained. In the next step, (for Catalyst A) xanthine sodium was reacted with HMS/Pr. Ultimately, for synthesis of final catalyst, Ni(NO3)2.6H2O was applied to afford HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni. All steps for the synthesis of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni are presented in Fig.\u00a01.\nThe method for synthesis of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu (Catalyst B) is shown in Fig.\u00a02. After preparation of HMS/Pr, 4-phenylthiosemicarbazide and Et3N was added to HMS/Pr and HMS/Pr-PTSC was obtained. Finally reaction of Cu(NO3)2.3H2O with HMS/Pr-PTSC lead to synthesis of catalyst B.\nAfter fabrication of catalysts, for their confirmation, we were applied different techniques such as FT-IR, XRD, TGA, SEM, TEM, EDX-Map, adsorption-desorption of nitrogen, AAS and ICP. All these analyses interpreted for catalyst A and B respectively in next section.\nThe FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig.\u00a03) was applied for confirmation of functional groups of the synthesized compounds such as HMS (a) and HMS/Pr (b), HMS/Pr-Xa (c) and HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni (d). FT-IR spectra of HMS (a) indicated the peaks at 3454 cm-1 contributed to silanol group and the peaks at 810 cm\u22121 and 1081 cm\u22121 are\nFigure\u00a01.

The C\u2013H stretching vibrations, in spectrum of HMS/Pr (b), are appearing in the range of 2854\u20132959 cm\u22121. As shown in spectrum of HMS/ Pr-Xa (c), the peak at 3436 cm\u22121 could be ascribed to the N\u2013H stretching vibration also carbonyl of amid group contributed to xanthine, located at 1654 cm\u22121. In the spectrum of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni (d) this peak shifts to 1635 cm\u22121 due to the coordination with the metal of Ni.\nLow angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of HMS and HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni are indicated in Fig.\u00a04. In these patterns, there was distinct peak at 2\u03b8 angles about of 2.64. After functionalization, the hexagonal structure of\nFigure\u00a02.

As shown in Fig.\u00a04, the decrease in intensity of the characteristic diffraction peak belongs to catalyst, rather than HMS, was confirmed that organic moieties on the pore wall of HMS was successfully immobilized. The reason can also be known as the decrease in the mesoscopic order of the materials.\nThe thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was applied for investigation of the thermal stability of HMS/Pr-XaNi and determination of the amount of organic groups incorporated into HMS. As shown in Fig.\u00a05, the weight loss below 150\u00a0\u00b0C contributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water and organic solvent. Immobilization of Pr-Xa-Ni in the surface of pores was revealed with their decomposition, that weight loss about 12% was indicated at temperatures 150\u2013600\u00a0\u00b0C. Also, Ni content loaded in modified HMS in the HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni was 0.09 mmol g\u22121 that defined by ICP-AES analysis.\nThe morphology and particle size of the synthesized catalyst was defined by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.\u00a06) and TEM analysis (Fig.\u00a07). Figure\u00a06 illustrates the SEM images of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni. This analysis has shown that the prepared catalyst has regular and ordered structure. Also, the SEM images illustrated that synthesized nanocatalyst has nanometer-sized particles with an average diameter less than 27\u00a0nm. The nanocatalyst A sample is further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to obtain insight into its structural and morphological features. The nanocatalyst A TEM images display the distribution of catalyst nanoparticles of size below 50\u00a0nm.\nThe particle size distribution histogram of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni was indicated in Fig.\u00a07c. The average size of the particle is 10.00\u00a0nm with 1.93\u00a0nm standard deviation.\nEDX spectrum of synthesized catalyst characterized elemental composition in the catalyst. As shown in Fig.\u00a08, the presence of elements of Si, O, N, C and Ni were confirmed in the EDX analysis of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni. Also the map image revealed dispersion of all elements (Si, O, N, C and Ni) of the catalyst and confirmed the good dispersion of Ni on the surface of the HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni (Fig.\u00a09).\nFigure\u00a010 shown the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of HMS and HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni.

By N2 isotherms, physicochemical and structural parameters of the samples were obtained containing BET surface area (SBET), total pore volumes (Vtotal) and pore diameters (DBJH) (Table\u00a01). More importantly, the decrease in SBET, DBJH and Vtotal of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni rather than HMS, are due to successfully immobilization of Pr-Xa-Ni in pore of the HMS.\nFor confirmation of functional groups, in catalyst B, in HMS (a), HMS/Pr (b), HMS/Pr-PTSC (c) and HMS/ Pr-PTSC-Cu (d) the FT-IR spectroscopy was investigated that indicated in Fig.\u00a011.\nIn the FT-IR spectra of HMS (a), the peak appeared at 3433 cm\u22121 contributed to silanol group. Also, the peaks at 804 cm\u22121 and 1074 cm\u22121 demonstrated that ascribed to Si\u2013O\u2013Si symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration respectively4. The FT\u2010IR spectrum of HMS/Pr which is illustrated in Fig.\u00a011b shows peaks at 784 cm\u22121 and 1048 cm\u22121 relating to the Si\u2013O\u2013Si symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration respectively. Another peak at 2864 cm\u22121 is contributed to the C\u2013H stretching vibrations. In the spectrum of HMS/Pr-PTSC (C) C\u2013H stretching of the alkyl group are detected by the peaks at 2913\u20132945 cm\u22121. As shown in spectrum of HMS/Pr-PTSC (C) and HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu (d), symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of Si\u2013O\u2013Si are appearing in 806 cm\u22121 and 1090 cm\u22121. Also, the peaks of 1400 cm\u22121 and 1631 cm\u22121 are contributed to (C=C) aromatic ring. In the spectrum of catalyst the existence of NH is confirmed by peak that appears in 3436 cm\u22121.\nThermogravimetric curves of HMS and HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu at the temperature range of 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 800\u00a0\u00b0C shown in Fig.\u00a012. The thermal behaviour of catalyst shows three weight losses. The first weight loss (mass change: 5.7%) below 220\u00a0\u00b0C contributed to volatilization of the physically adsorbed water and organic solvent. The second step contains 17% weight loss between 220-600\u00a0\u00b0C and for the third step 5.6% weight loss between 590\u2013800\u00a0\u00b0C observed. These results indicated that HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu is stable to 220\u00a0\u00b0C (only 5.7% weight loss in this temperature range). In addition, about 17% weight loss observed between 220-600\u00a0\u00b0C attributed to decomposition of groups that attached in the surface of pores of support that confirmed successful synthesis of the catalyst.\nFigure\u00a06.

Patterns display one sharp reflection. This comparison explains and confirms this fact that, there is no changes in the phase of HMS during functionalization process4.\nFigure\u00a014 presents the SEM images of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu. SEM analysis was applied to determine its morphology and size distribution. It can be seen from SEM images that HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu possessed regular and ordered structure with particle sizes of less than 23\u00a0nm.

The obtained result from this analysis indicated that the average size of the particle of catalyst B is 5.35 nm with 1.60 nm standard deviation.\nThe EDX spectrum of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu illustrated in Fig.\u00a016. As indicated by the EDX result, the expected elemental constituent was obtained for synthesised catalyst (C, N, O, Si, S, Cu). The EDX spectrum provides further evidence of successful immobilization of Pr-PTSC-Cu in pore of HMS.\nFigure\u00a09.

Based on this analysis, BET surface area (SBET), total pore volumes (Vtotal) and pore diameters (DBJH) of prepared catalyst were determined. Also, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm showed in Fig.\u00a018.\nInvestigation of the catalytic activity of HMS/Pr\u2011Xa\u2011Ni for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b] pyran and 1,4\u2011dihydropyrano[2,3\u2011c]pyrazole. After the identification and confirmation of catalysts, we decided to investigation the catalytic activity of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole.\nIn order to optimize the reaction conditions, many reactions were undertaken wherein the amount of catalyst, various solvents and different temperature were checked (Table\u00a03). In this light the reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), dimedone (1 mmol) and HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni as catalyst was selected as model reaction. After evaluation of effect of mentioned factors on the model reaction, the results were revealed that 0.04 g of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni in H2O: EtOH (3:1 mL) at 80\u00a0\u00b0C was found to be ideal reaction condition for the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran. For investigation of necessity of presence of nickel in promote of the reaction, the reaction was under taken in presence of HMS/Pr-Xa. The yield of this reaction was 30% (Table\u00a03, entry 12).\nIn order to explore the scope and the limitations of this novel and heterogenous catalytic system, for the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran (1a-k), we evaluated the reaction using wide range of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituted aldehyde (Fig.\u00a019). The results are summarized in Table\u00a04.\nThe suggested mechanism for the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran in the presence of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni is indicated in Fig.\u00a020. The condensations of malononitrile with activated aldehyde afford arylidenemalononitrile intermediate (I). Then the enolized dimedone reacts with the arylidenemalononitrile intermediate (I) by the\nFigure\u00a011.

Finally, intramolecular cyclization occurs and ultimately the expected tetrahydrobenzo[b] pyran produces with rearrangement11.\nIn the second part for determination of the optimal reaction conditions, for synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3c]pyrazole, the reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1 mmol), malononitrile (1 mmol), ethyl acetoacetate (1 mmol) and hydrazine hydrate (1 mmol) in the presence of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni as catalyst was undertaken. For this purpose, various effective factors on the model reaction such as: amount of catalyst (catalyst free, 0.008, 0.01 and 0.02 g), solvents (H2O, EtOH, PEG, H2O: EtOH and solvent free) and also the effect of temperature (35, 80 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C) were checked. As screened in Table\u00a05, the obtained results were demonstrated that 0.01 g of catalyst, mixture of H2O: EtOH at 35 \u00b0C were the most effective condition. For indicating necessity of presence of nickel in catalytic activity, the model reaction investigated in presence of HMS/Pr-Xa. That result indicated that yield of this reaction was obtained 28% (Table\u00a05, entry 12).\nAfter optimization of the reaction conditions, as shown in Table\u00a06, 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives (2a-k) were synthesized by using various electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituted aldehydes (Fig.\u00a021).\nA possible mechanism for the synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole using HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni as catalyst is demonstrated in Fig.\u00a022. The Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile and aldehyde (activated by Ni of the catalyst), leads to obtain the intermediate of arylidenemalononitrile (intermediate I). Also, pyrazolone (intermediate II) is produced by the condensation of hydrazine and ethyl acetoacetate (activated by Ni of the catalyst). In\nFigure\u00a012.

After successful characterization, the catalytic application of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu was evaluated for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and 1,4 dihydropyrano[2,3c]pyrazole.\nIn the first, to study of the catalytic activity of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu for synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran, the reaction of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1\u00a0mmol), malononitrile (1\u00a0mmol), dimedone (1\u00a0mmol) and HMS/PrPTSC-Cu as catalyst was choosed as model reaction.\nTo define the optimal condition of reaction, various amount of catalyst (0.02\u00a0g, 0.015\u00a0g, 0.01\u00a0g, 0.008\u00a0g, 0.006\u00a0g, 0.004\u00a0g, 0.002\u00a0g and catalyst free condition), different solvent (EtOH, H2O, PEG, H2O:EtOH and solvent free condition) and temperatures of 45\u00a0\u00b0C, 60\u00a0\u00b0C and room temperature were examined. Comparison of obtained results revealed that the best efficiencies were obtained in the presence of 0.004\u00a0g of catalyst in ethanol at room temperature (Table\u00a07, entry 7).\nTo investigate the effectiveness of the presented catalytic system, the model reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst (Table\u00a07, entry 1) and in the presence of HMS/Pr-PTSC (lack of Cu) (Table\u00a07, entry 15). The yields for these reactions were obtained 41% and 38% respectively.\nTo specify the extent of the reaction we reacted various of substituted of aldehydes under optimized conditions to produce tetrahydrobenzo[b] pyran derivatives (3a-k) (Fig.\u00a023, Table\u00a08).\nAccording to the results it was found that electron-withdrawing groups (such as nitro and halides) rather than electron-donating groups (such as methoxy, methyl and hydroxy) on aldehyde provide better results from the viewpoint of time and yield.\nFigure\u00a014.

With evaluation of these parameters, we found that in the presence of 0.006\u00a0g of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu as catalyst in H2O:EtOH at room temperature the best conversion is achieved (Table\u00a09, entry 6).\nFigure\u00a015.

The obtained yield (40%) showed that the presence of Cu was necessaries for progress of reaction.\nAfter optimization of the reaction conditions, benzaldehyde, electron-donating containing aldehydes as well as electron-withdrawing bearing aldehydes were applied as substrate and 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives (4a-l) were obtained in high to excellent yield as summarized in Table\u00a010 (Fig.\u00a024). Assessment of results indicated that electron-withdrawing bearing aldehydes have higher yield and shorter reaction time.\nComparison of efficiency of catalysts. In this work, two heterogeneous HMS supported metal catalysts were screened in the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran and 1,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives. Turnover frequency (TOF) value is an important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of the catalyst, which quantifies how many catalytic reaction cycles proceed per site and per unit of time4. TOF was measured for all products and is given in the Tables\u00a04,6,8 and 10. Based on the results achieved from ICP and AAS, Ni and Cu histograms at TEM and turnover frequency (TOF) obtained from yield, time and amount of catalyst (mol% of Cu and Ni), the investigated metals can be ranked as copper metal has performed better. Judging by the contrast of TEM images, the size distribution of copper particles is better visible.\nRecyclability of the catalysts. Reusability and recycling of the HMS/Pr\u2011Xa\u2011Ni. Reusability of the catalysts is one of the most crucial aspects of organic synthesis. In this respect, reusability of HMS/Pr-Xa-Ni was investigated for synthesis of 2-amino\u20134-(4-chlorophenyl)-3\u2013cyano-7,7\u2013dimethyl-5-oxo-4H-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro benzo[b]pyran. After completion of the reaction, hot EtOH was added to the crude mixture and centrifuged several times. The separated catalyst was washed, dried for overnight and applied for the next run. The HMS/ Pr-Xa-Ni was found to be reusable for five successive runs with a negligible decrease in its activity (Fig.\u00a025).\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\nQ ua\nn ty\nA ds\nor be\nd (m\nm ol\n/g )\nRela ve pressure (P/P\u00b0)\nAdsorp on-catalyst\nDesorp on-catalyst\nFigure\u00a018.

Since the recycling of catalyst is of great importance in the industry, the recyclability of HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu in the synthesis of 2\u2013amino\u20133\u2013cyano\u20137,7\u2013dimethyl\u20134-(4chlorophenyl)\u20135\u2013oxo-4H\u20135,6,7,8-tetrahydro benzopyran and 6-amino-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-1,4dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carbonitrile was studied. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by centrifuge instrument and dried. Then, dried separated catalyst was reused in the same reaction for six successive runs with minimal decrease in the yield of product (Fig.\u00a026).\nTable 4.

Also, the vibration of NH observed in 3436 cm\u22121. It can be seen that the structure of catalyst was preserved after recovery.\nAlso AAS analysis contributed to recovered HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu was done that base on this analysis copper concentration in recovered catalyst was obtained 0.50 mmol.g\u22121. This analysis confirmed that copper leaching was low.\nThe hot filtration experiment was investigated to determine leaching of copper in the reaction mixture and to show that HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu is a heterogeneous catalyst. For this regard the reaction between 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, malononitrile, ethyl acetoacetate, hydrazine hydrate, HMS/Pr-PTSC-Cu in H2O: EtOH (2:1 mL) at room temperature was choose. In this experiment the product was obtained in the half time of the reaction (10 min) in 66% yield. Then, the same reaction was repeated but in this reaction in the half time of the reaction (after 10 min), the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture was allowed to react for another 10 min. The yield of product in this experiment was 69%. The results from hot filtration test confirmed that leaching of copper during the reaction hasn\u2019t been significant.\nComparison results of synthesised catalysts with other catalysts. Comparison of the catalytic activity of our catalyst with those reported in the literature is useful in order to extend the scope of merit of synthesised catalyst. In this light, comparison of our studies with reported works was under taken for synthesis of 2-amino\u20134-(4-chlorophenyl)-3\u2013cyano-7,7\u2013dimethyl-5-oxo-4H-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-benzo[b]pyran (Table\u00a011, entry 1-7) and 6-Amino-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carbonitrile (Table\u00a011, entry 8-15). We find that our catalytic systems benefit mild reaction conditions, good to high yields and short reaction times."
