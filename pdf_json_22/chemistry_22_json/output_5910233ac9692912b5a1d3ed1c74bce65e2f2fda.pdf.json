    "abstractText": "The restricted active space spin-flip (RAS-SF) formalism is a particular form of single-reference configuration interaction that can describe some forms of strong correlation at relatively low cost, and which has recently been formulated for the description of charge-transfer excited states. Here, we introduce both equilibrium and nonequilibrium versions of a state-specific solvation correction for vertical transition energies computed using RAS-SF wave functions, based on the framework of a polarizable continuum model (PCM). Ground-state polarization is described using the solvent\u2019s static dielectric constant and in the nonequilibrium solvation approach that polarization is modified upon vertical excitation using the solvent\u2019s optical dielectric constant. Benchmark calculations are reported for well-studied models of photo-induced charge transfer including naphthalene dimer, C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4, pentacene dimer, and perylene diimide (PDI) dimer, several of which are important in organic photovoltaic applications. For the PDI dimer, we demonstrate that the charge-transfer character of the excited states is enhanced in the presence of a low-dielectric medium (static dielectric constant \u03b50 = 3) as compared to a gas-phase calculation (\u03b50 = 1). This stabilizes mechanistic traps for singlet fission and helps to explain experimental singlet fission rates. We also examine the effects of nonequilibrium solvation on charge-separated states in an intramolecular singlet fission chromophore, where we demonstrate that the energetic ordering of the states changes as a function of solvent polarity. The RAS-SF + PCM methodology that is reported here provides a framework to study charge-separated states in solution and in photovoltaic materials.",

INTRODUCTION\nMultireference wave function methods1\u20133 are important tools in the quantum chemist\u2019s arsenal, for the description of static correlation in systems with stretched bonds or other types of (near-) degeneracies, as well as open-shell systems including radicals and excited states.2 However, the exponential scaling of computational cost with respect to active space size, for methods such as the complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory, limits the size and scope of problems that can be addressed in this way. To reduce the cost of multireference approaches, alternative ansa\u0308tze have been developed, notably spin-flip (SF) methods.4\u20139 Amongst the SF family of approaches, one of the most important variants is the restricted active space (RAS-)SF method. Configuration interaction (CI) wave functions within the RAS family include all possible configurations within an active space, and (at a minimum) single excitations into and out of the active space.10 As such, RAS-SF provides a low-cost, balanced treatment of ground and excited states with multi-radical character.5,6 Unlike CASSCF, the RAS-SF technique does not require orbital optimization, which significantly reduces both complexity and cost.5\u20137\nA recently-developed variant of RAS-SF allows analysis of charge-transfer (CT) states,11 which were previously inaccessible to the theory. The new method can compute not just CT states but also electronic couplings,\n\u2217herbert@chemistry.ohio-state.edu\nusing a diabatic framework that may facilitate more indepth understanding of photophysical processes such as artificial or biological light-harvesting. The position of CT states in the excitation manifold is often sensitive to polarization effects,12\u201315 even in low-dielectric environments such as organic photovoltaic materials.15 Therefore some treatment of the surrounding medium is likely necessary in order to make contact with experiments.\nIn the present work, we augment the RAS-SF methodology to include solvent polarization based on dielectric continuum theory,16 within the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM).16\u201318 Specifically, we introduce both equilibrium (state-relaxed) and nonequilibrium versions of the RAS-SF + PCM formalism, in order to account for differential polarization upon electronic excitation of the solute. The nonequilibrium continuum approach16,19\u201324 separates the medium\u2019s polarization response into fast (electronic) and slow (vibrational and orientational) components, then uses the solvent\u2019s optical dielectric constant (\u03b5\u221e) to describe the fast processes while the static dielectric constant (\u03b50) describes the total polarization response, including both nuclear and electronic contributions. In this way, nonequilibrium PCMs describe the change in electronic polarization following a sudden change in the charge distribution of the solute, corresponding to vertical electronic excitation20\u201322 or vertical ionization.21,23,24 In contrast, the state-relaxed algorithm is targeted at equilibrium solvation where all polarization mechanisms are fully relaxed in the excited state, as appropriate for the description of emission.\n2"

The total electronic energy in the ground state is\nE0 = \u3008\u03a80|H\u0302vac + R\u03020|\u03a80\u3009 (2)\nin which H\u0302vac is the vacuum (gas-phase) Hamiltonian. The subscript \u201c0\u201d in R\u03020 indicates that the ground-state wave function is used to polarize the medium.

(4)\nWe will now extend this idea to state-specific solvation of an excited-state wave function |\u03a8k\u3009, starting with an equilibrium approach in which the polarization of the medium is fully relaxed with respect to the excited-state charge distribution, using the solvent\u2019s static dielectric constant (\u03b50) to represent all possible polarization mechanisms for the medium. This approach should be valid in the long-time limit after excitation, whereas the case of a sudden (vertical) excitation requires a nonequilibrium approach, as developed in Section II C. For equilibrium solvation on excited state k, one must solve the statespecific Schro\u0308dinger equation\n(H\u0302vac + R\u0302k)|\u03a8k\u3009 = Ek|\u03a8k\u3009 . (5)\n(Our notation for excited-state PCM calculations follows that used in a recent review.16) The quantity R\u0302k is the reaction-field operator for state k, meaning that\n3 the charge distribution corresponding to wave function |\u03a8k\u3009 is used to polarize the medium. Since R\u0302k depends on |\u03a8k\u3009, Eq. (5) must be solved iteratively and this constitutes the excited-state SCRF problem.\nIn analogy to Eq. (2), the electronic energy for state k in this fully-relaxed approach is\nEeqk = \u3008\u03a8k|H\u0302vac + R\u0302k|\u03a8k\u3009 , (6)\nusing a superscript \u201ceq\u201d to indicate equilibrium solvation. The corresponding free energy is\nGeqk = E eq k \u2212Wk (7)\nwhere\nWk = 1 2 \u3008\u03a8k|R\u0302k|\u03a8k\u3009 (8)\nrepresents the work required to polarize the continuum using R\u0302k. The fully-relaxed (equilibrium) excitation energy is\nGeqk \u2212G0 = \u2206E eq k \u2212Wk +W0 (9)\nwhere\n\u2206Eeqk = E eq k \u2212 E0 (10)\nis the state-specific eigenvalue difference. The quantity Wk\u2212W0 in Eq. (9) represents the differential polarization work between the excited state and the ground state.\nThe iterative procedure required to solve the statespecific eigenvalue problem in Eq. (5) is relatively straightforward if there are no quasi-degeneracies, although this equation must be solved separately for each electronic state of interest. However, the presence of near-degeneracies may lead to convergence problems associated with root-flipping, and furthermore properties other than the energy (including oscillator strengths) are not entirely well-defined because the excited states are not eigenfunctions of a common Hamiltonian and are therefore not orthogonal to one another.26 To circumvent these difficulties, we next describe a perturbative approach to state-specific solvation,20\u201322 which furthermore allows for all of the solvent-corrected excitation energies to be obtained from a single calculation, including nonequilibrium corrections."

            "text": "We next describe a nonequilibrium approach to statespecific solvation that is appropriate for modeling vertical excitation energies.16 The nonequilibrium formalism recognizes that nuclear (vibrational and orientational) degrees of freedom within the (implicit) solvent do not respond quickly enough to remain in equilibrium with a vertical electronic transition, and indeed this is the sense in which the excitation is \u201cvertical\u201d. There is also an electronic component to the solvent\u2019s polarization response,\nhowever, and it ought to remain in equilibrium with the solute. The total polarization in the ground state is thus partitioned into \u201cslow\u201d (nuclear) and \u201cfast\u201d (electronic) components,\nR\u03020 = R\u0302 s 0 + R\u0302 f 0 . (11)\nOperationally this means that the ground-state polarization charge \u03c30 (generated by R\u03020) is partitioned as \u03c30 = \u03c3 s 0 + \u03c3 f 0, where 16\n\u03c3s0 = ( \u03b50 \u2212 \u03b5\u221e \u03b50 \u2212 1 ) \u03c30 (12a)\n\u03c3f0 = ( \u03b5\u221e \u2212 1 \u03b50 \u2212 1 ) \u03c30 . (12b)\nThe solvent\u2019s optical dielectric constant (\u03b5\u221e), which has been called the \u201cdielectric constant for induced polarization\u201d,27 is used to describe electronic polarization.\nConsidering the equilibrium expression for Ek in Eq. (6), where R\u0302k = R\u0302 s k + R\u0302 f k, a corresponding nonequilibrium expression is obtained by instead using R\u0302s0 + R\u0302 f k as the reaction-field operator for excited state k, corresponding to a state-specific polarization charge density \u03c3k = \u03c3 s 0 + \u03c3 f k.

Even if convergence is not problematic, a separate calculation is required for each excited state. For reasons of simplicity, we desire an approach that can generate the entire spectrum in a single calculation. A perturbative approach to incorporating the solvation correction solves both of these problems.\nTo obtain such an approach, we start from the unperturbed Hamiltonian\nH\u03020 = H\u0302vac + R\u0302 s 0 + R\u0302 f 0 (15)\nthat is simply a rewriting of the ground-state Hamiltonian in Eq.

(16)\n4 Introducing a perturbation parameter \u03bb, this partition can be used to develop a perturbation theory expression for the energy of state k, including nonequilibrium corrections:\nEnoneqk = \u3008\u03a8k|H\u03020 + \u03bb(R\u0302 f k \u2212 R\u0302f0)|\u03a8k\u3009 . (17)\nThis has been called the perturbation theory state-specific (ptSS) approach.20\u201322 Unperturbed states |\u03a8(0)k \u3009 are eigenfunctions of H\u03020, and the zeroth-order energy for state k is\nE ptSS(0) k =\n\u2329 \u03a8\n(0) k \u2223\u2223H\u0302vac + R\u03020\u2223\u2223\u03a8(0)k \u232a (18) within the nonequilibrium formalism. The corresponding free energy expression is16\nG ptSS(0) k = E ptSS(0) k \u2212W s 0 \u2212W f0 , (19)\nwhere W s0 and W f 0 are defined analogously to W0 in Eq. (3) but with R\u0302s0 or R\u0302 f 0 replacing R\u03020.\nEquation (18) for Ek is a natural generalization of Eq. (2) for E0, and corresponds to solving the Schro\u0308dinger equation in the fixed reaction field of the equilibrated ground state. The first nonequilibrium correction arises in first-order perturbation theory and is given by\nE ptSS(1) k =\n\u2329 \u03a8\n(0) k \u2223\u2223R\u0302fk(0) \u2212 R\u0302f0\u2223\u2223\u03a8(0)k \u232a , (20) where the notation R\u0302fk(0) indicates that this reaction-field operator is constructed using the charge density corresponding to wave function |\u03a8(0)k \u3009. The corresponding free energy correction is\nG ptSS(1) k = E ptSS(1) k \u2212W f k(0) +W f 0 +W0,k(0) (21)\nwhere\nW fk(0) = 1 2\n\u2329 \u03a8\n(0) k \u2223\u2223R\u0302fk\u2223\u2223\u03a8(0)k \u232a (22) in analogy to Eq. (8). The quantity W0,k(0) in is a chargeseparation penalty arising from the Coulomb interaction of the initial- and final-state surface charges:16,21\nW0,k(0) = 1\n2\n\u222b [ \u03c3fk(0)(r)\u2212 \u03c3 f 0(r) ] \u03d5\u03c3 s 0(r) dr . (23)\nHere, \u03d5\u03c3 s 0(r) is the electrostatic potential generated by the ground-state polarization charge, \u03c3s0(r). As discussed in Refs. 16 and 21, the W0,k(0) term has sometimes been omitted from nonequilibrium polarization treatments, but is necessary when the \u201cMarcus partition\u201d into fast and slow components is used, corresponding to Eq. (12).\nTaking the free energy for state k to be the zerothorder result plus the first-order correction,\nGk = G ptSS(0) k +G ptSS(1) k , (24)\nthe ptSS approximation to the excitation energy is\n\u2206G ptSS(1) k = Gk \u2212G0\n= \u2206E ptSS(1) k \u2212W f k(0) +W f 0 +W0,k(0)\n(25)\nwhere\n\u2206E ptSS(1) k = E ptSS(0) k + E ptSS(1) k \u2212 E0 . (26)\nThe formula in Eq. (25) has a straightforward interpretation.16 The leading term, which is given by Eq. (26), is difference between eigenvalues Ek and E0 of the state-specific Schro\u0308dinger equation, where Ek is correct through first order in perturbation theory. This eigenvalue difference becomes a free energy upon subtracting W fk(0) \u2212 W f 0, which is the difference between the work required to polarize the fast charge on the excited state relative to that required on the ground state. Finally, W0,k(0) is the aforementioned charge-separation penalty.\nFor future reference, we define\n\u2206E ptSS(0) k = E ptSS(0) k \u2212 E0 , (27)\nwhich is the zeroth-order approximation to Ek \u2212 E0. Equivalently, this is the excitation energy obtained by solving the Schro\u0308dinger equation in the fixed reaction field of the ground state, and therefore this approximation does not contain nonequilibrium effects. Equation (25) can then be rewritten as\n\u2206G ptSS(1) k = \u2206E ptSS(0) k +G ptSS(1) k . (28)\nThe ptSS approximation for the free energy of excitation (\u2206G ptSS(1) k ) is thus obtained by adding the zeroth-order eigenvalue difference (\u2206E ptSS(0) k ) to the first-order free energy correction (G ptSS(1) k ), with all nonequilibrium effects contained in the latter.\nD. Implementation\nA flow chart for the RAS-SF + PCM algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 2, including both the nonequilibrium ptSS and the state-relaxed equilibrium procedure. The algorithm begins by computing the RAS-SF ground state wave function in the gas phase. Next, one-electron integrals are modified to incorporate R\u03020 and the groundstate total energy is iterated to convergence, as in any SCRF calculation except that the lowest eigenstate of a CI Hamiltonian must be computed at each SCRF iteration. This completes step 1 in Fig. 2. Once the groundstate eigenfunction has been equilibrated with respect to the medium, excited states (including LE and/or CT states, as desired) are obtained by computing additional eigenstates in the presence of a fixed reaction-field operator R\u03020. These are the zeroth-order states |\u03a8(0)k \u3009, with energies E\nptSS(0) k [Eq. (18)]. From there, the corrected free\nenergies for each state can be computing using Eq. (19), or excitation free energies using Eq. (25). Note that ptSS corrections can be computed for all excited states at once, without any additional SCRF iterations in step 2 of Fig. 2.\nThe equilibrium state-relaxed procedure starts from gas-phase RAS-SF calculation to obtain an initial wave function |\u03a8k\u3009 for the excited state of interest, from which R\u0302k can be constructed. This procedure bypasses the ground-state SCRF procedure (although the groundstate SCRF problem needs to be solved in advance, to obtain E0), instead proceeding directly to the state-specific eigenvalue problem for Ek, Eq. (5). Solution of this equation requires SCRF iterations in the excited state, because each time the RAS-SF Hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain |\u03a8k\u3009, the operator R\u0302k must be modified to reflect how the new excited-state charge density polarizes the medium. This process is iterated to convergence and then Eeqk is obtained from Eq. (6). The proper state energy, however, is Geqk [Eq. (7)], and the excitation energy for state k is given in Eq. (9). The SCRF procedure must be repeated for every state of interest.\nIn the language of PCM theory for correlated wave functions, the equilibrium state-relaxed approach just described has some similarity to the most complete version of the SCRF procedure, which is often called \u201cpertur-\nbation to energy and density\u201d,16,22,28 insofar as all correlation effects are fully included in the charge density that is used to equilibrate the reaction field. Some differences exist insofar as RAS-SF is not a post-Hartree\u2013 Fock correlation procedure where correlation is added to a single-determinant reference, but rather it is a method in which the ground-state wave function emerges as the lowest eigenfunction of a CI Hamiltonian.\nThe ptSS-PCM procedure described in Section II C has previous been implemented for CI wave functions with single excitations only (i.e., CIS),20,21 which is technically simpler because in that case the reference state is the physical ground state. In this context timedependent (TD-) DFT can be considered another CIStype method, and TD-DFT + ptSS-PCM was also implemented in previous work.20,21 The latter approach is very similar to the \u201ccorrected linear response theory\u201d of Caricato et al..29"

Solvation corrections for singlet CT from C2H4 to C2F4, and from one naphthalene monomer to the other, are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of reciprocal intermolecular separation, 1/R. The quantity plotted is the difference between excitation energies computed using \u03b50 = 78.4 versus \u03b50 = 1.0, i.e., the solvent shift in water. RAS-SF calculations on C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4 use the cc-pVTZ basis set and RIMP2-ccpVTZ auxiliary basis set while those on (naphthalene)2 use the 6-31G* basis set and RIMP2-cc-pVDZ basis set.\nFor a point of comparison, we also computed the CT energies using a \u2206SCF approach in conjunction with cDFT, a comparison that was also used in Ref. 11 to test the gas-phase RAS-SF CT procedure. With cDFT, both of the energies required for the \u2206SCF calculation can be computed as ground-state DFT + PCM calcu-\nlations, and comparison to an equilibrium model of the solvent response is therefore appropriate.\nFor both systems, the behavior of the solvent shift is very similar in both the RAS-SF and the cDFT calculations, despite significant differences methodology: RAS is a correlated wave function approach and is using excitedstate SCRF iterations to compute the state-specific solvation energy, while the cDFT-based \u2206SCF procedure uses two ground-state calculations, one of them with a charge constraint that forces the monomers to integrate to \u00b11 charge. Despite these differences, the solvent shift is found to be a linear function of 1/R, in accordance with the Born model of two well-separated charges in a dielectric medium.16 For C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4, the shift varies by about 0.6 eV (14 kcal/mol) over a 1.5 A\u030a change in R, at both levels of electronic structure theory, despite the fact that the absolute shifts are offset by about 0.1 eV. The slope (solvent shift versus 1/R) that is obtained from RAS-SF + PCM is within 10% of that obtained using cDFT + PCM, for both dimers. These tests suggest that the combination of a PCM with the RAS-SF ansatz for CT states provides a meaningful description of solvation for a photo-excited ion pair."

(29) However, it may also contain small contributions from charge-separated determinants |A+B\u2212\u3009 and |A\u2212B+\u3009. These sometimes appear in the form of charge-resonance (CR) states,15,45\n|CR\u3009 = c1|A+B\u2212\u3009+ c2|A\u2212B+\u3009 . (30)\nDespite its charge-separated character, the CR state may have a small or vanishing dipole moment if c1 \u2248 \u2212c2, which is often the case for high-symmetry (or even nearsymmetry) dimers.15 Gas-phase calculations suggest that the charge-separated states in (PDI)2 are indeed of CR form.57\nHere, we consider two geometries of (PDI)2 that are taken from Ref. 56 and which afford the fastest and slowest singlet fission rates of the eight (PDI)2 geometries that were examined in Ref. 57. The geometries of these two dimer models are illustrated on the left side of Fig. 4\nand their frontier molecular orbitals are illustrated in the middle part of Fig. 4. The two dimers have somewhat different offset-stacking arrangements for the cofacial PDI monomers and also different face-to-face distances. We will examine the S1 (\n1\u03c0\u03c0\u2217) state of these dimers and also two different ME states that will be designated 1ME (lower state) and 1ME\u2032 (upper state), following Ref. 57.\nFigure 5 reports the percentage of CT character for these three states, as quantified using the RAS-SF CT method,11 as a function of solvent polarity. We consider the values \u03b50 = 1 (corresponding to vacuum boundary conditions), \u03b50 = 3 (characteristic of typical thin films such as poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA), and \u03b50 = 37.5 (representing acetonitrile). For model 1 of the dimer, the CT character varies only slightly as a function of these very significant changes in \u03b50, but for model 2 we observe significant changes in CT character in polar versus nonpolar environments. In particular, the S1 state of model 2 exceeds 50% CT character in acetonitrile as compared to 30% CT character in the gas phase.\nThe molecular orbitals that are primarily responsible for the CT character are illustrated in the middle part of Fig. 4, with arrows that represent the two dominant configurations in the wave function.

The 1ME\u2032 state is defined to be higher-energy state of pair of ME states that emerge from the calculation.\nFig. 4 quantifies the CT contribution in these two configurations, as a function of \u03b50. In the gas phase, the two CT configurations appear in essentially equal percentages, in both structures of (PDI)2, leading in both cases to a CR state with vanishing dipole moment. For model 2, however, a dielectric constant of \u03b50 = 3 is sufficient to break the symmetry, resulting in a net dipole moment. In contrast, symmetry-breaking is not observed in model 1 even in acetonitrile. This observation has potential ramifications for singlet fission. The CR character in model 2 facilitates the overall singlet fission process by increasing the electronic coupling between the S1 and 1ME states.57,59\u201361 Model 2, which transfers electrons in only one direction when \u03b50 & 3, might act as an energetic trap in a dielectric medium. This trap (an excimer state) would then compete with singlet fission and would lower the yield of the latter process. This suggests that one possible route to improving efficiency of singlet fission in PDI dimers is to exploit geometries in which single-directional CT is inhibited. This difference highlights the fact that calculations carried out using vacuum boundary conditions are ill-positioned to address whether CT character plays a role in the singlet fission mechanism."

Comparison to cDFT calculations is not appropriate in the present case, however, because we use a nonequilibrium formulation of the solvation correction in order to describe vertical excitation energies, and there is no analogous \u2206SCF calculation. RAS-SF excitation energies in vacuo and in water are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of 1/R. These calculations use the 6-31G* basis set and RIMP2-VDZ auxiliary basis set.\nAs expected, the excitation energies vary linearly with 1/R and the solvent shifts are quite large, e.g., \u2206E = \u22121.33 eV for C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4 at R = 5 A\u030a (RAS-SF/ccpVDZ level). This is comparable to the shift of \u2206E = \u22121.15 eV that was reported previously for this system using TD-DFT + ptSS-PCM.21\nTable I lists the lowest CT excitation energy that is obtained for C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4 in six different solvents including cyclohexane (cHex), toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene (ClBz), benzonitrile (BzCN), and water. Because we consider only the electrostatic part of the solvation energy, each solvent is fully characterized by the pair of values \u03b50 and \u03b5\u221e. Although nonelectrostatic solvation models are reasonably well established for groundstate solvation16 (e.g., using the SMx models),65 there has been much less work on nonelectrostatic effects for excited states and we do not consider that topic here. (For\n9\na brief overview of this topic, see Ref. 16.) Changes in nonelectrostatic interactions upon electronic excitation, including dispersion and Pauli repulsion, are expected to be much smaller than changes in the electrostatic solvation energy.\nListed in Table I is the first-order solvation correction to the excitation energy, G\nptSS(1) k [Eq. (21)], along\nwith the zeroth-order approximation to the excitation energy itself, \u2206E ptSS(0) k [Eq. (27)], and the first-order approximation to the same excitation energy, \u2206G ptSS(1) k [Eq. (25)]. These three quantities are related according to Eq. (28). The zeroth-order quantity \u2206E ptSS(0) k is the excitation energy computed in the frozen reaction field of the ground state and does not contain nonequilibrium corrections, i.e., it depends on \u03b50 but not \u03b5\u221e.\nWe note that the nonequilibrium correction G ptSS(1) k exceeds 1 eV for the CT state that is considered in Table I, even in nonpolar solvents. Perhaps counterintuitively, this correction is smaller in water than it is in less polar solvents. This is ultimately a consequence of the partition between \u201cslow\u201d and \u201cfast\u201d (or \u201cinertial\u201d and \u201cnoninertial\u201d) contributions to the solvent response,16,66 with the consequence that for a solvent like water where \u03b50 \u03b5\u221e, a much greater proportion of the solvent response is frozen upon vertical excitation.

            "text": "In thinking about CT states that might be relevant in organic photovoltaic applications,15,58 it is interesting to note that even nonpolar solvents (with \u03b50 . 5) afford a large nonequilibrium correction to a CT excitation\nenergy. This can be seen for C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4 in Table I, for example. The nonequilibrium correction comes from the optical dielectric constant, which is related to the electronic polarizability of the solvent molecules and has values \u03b5\u221e = 1.7\u20132.3 for most common solvents,\n16 even while the static dielectric constant varies from \u03b50 = 2\u20134 for nonpolar hydrocarbons up to \u03b50 = 78 for water.\nWith this in mind, we next consider an example relevant to organic photovoltaics, namely, a pentacene dimer model of a chromophore that undergoes intramolecular singlet fission,61 which is depicted in Fig. 7(a). Calculations are reported here using the unlinked dimer model that is shown in Fig. 7(b). We have confirmed, via CIS calculations, that the model system and the full chromophore afford excitation energies within about 0.3 eV of one another, which is sufficient for our purposes. The same is true for two other truncated models (not shown) in which the side chains or the spacer group were removed, but not both, indicating that the tri-isobutyl silyl side chains in the full chromophore [Fig. 7(a)] function mainly for solubility while the spacer moiety functions mostly to position the pentacene chromophores relative to one another. The singlet fission dynamics can be quite sensitive to the relative position and orientation of the pentacene moieties,67 so the atomic positions of the pentacene dimer core are the same in the model system as they are in the full chromophore. Calculations on the model are reported below in six different solvents, and in each case we compute six RAS-SF states: the ground state, the first locally-excited state (called LE2 here because LE1 corresponds to the ground state, consistent\n10\nwith the schematic in Fig. 1), two left CT states (LCT1 and LCT2), and two right CT states (RCT1 and RCT2). These calculations use the 6-31G* basis set and RIMP2VDZ auxiliary basis set. Selected results are shown in Table II, focusing on the LCT1 state but also including LE2 for comparison.\nWe observe that stabilization of the ground state increases with solvent polarity, and at the level of the zeroth-order eigenvalues E (0) k , which are computed in the reaction field of the ground state, approximately the same stabilization is obtained for the LCT1 state as for the ground state itself, to within a few milliHartree or < 0.03 eV. The first-order corrected excitation energies show a different trend, however. Here, both the static and optical dielectric constants are in play, and the value of the first-order correction G ptSS(1) k is smaller in water than it is in nonpolar solvents. As explained in Section III C 1, this behavior results from the fact that water has a much larger fraction of its total polarization response frozen upon vertical excitation, since \u03b50 \u03b5\u221e for water, which is a feature of the Marcus partition of the polarization into fast and slow components.16,21,66 In nonpolar or weakly-polar solvents, where \u03b50 is much closer to \u03b5\u221e, the nonequilibrium correction amounts to a greater fraction of the total solvation energy of the excited state, and the trend in first-order corrections G ptSS(1) k is governed primarily by the value of \u03b5\u221e. As noted elsewhere, 16,21,68 the partition between inertial and noninertial solvent response need not be done in this way, and the total solvation correction is essentially the same in Pekar\u2019s alternative partition scheme, but is apportioned differently into zeroth-order and cor-\nrective terms.16,68 For the LE2 state, we also observe a reduction in the excitation energy as solvent polarity increases, but the effect is smaller as compared to the LCT1 state because LE2 does not involve significant charge separation.\nWe next compare RAS-SF + ptSS-PCM results to the corresponding calculation at the CIS level, which will illustrate the ease of reaching target states with the RASSF procedure. Table III shows the results for the pentacene dimer model in Fig. 7(b), in two different solvents. In cyclohexane, we observe a correspondence between the RAS-SF states LCT1 (triplet) and LCT2 (singlet) and the 37th and 38th excited states obtained from the CIS calculation. Comparing excitation energies, the RASSF and the CIS results agree to within 0.04 eV and the dipole moments agree to within 0.5 D. A similar correspondence is observed between the RAS-SF states RCT1 and RCT2 and the 39th and 40th excited states obtained from the CIS calculation. The principle pair of natural transition orbitals (NTOs) for states 37 and 39 are plotted in Fig. 8, from the CIS calculation, which confirms the CT character of the states in question. (The RASSF states have CT character by construction.) While the excitation energies are similar, indicative of the lack of significant dynamical correlation in the RAS-SF wave function,7 the CIS approach necessitates calculation of a large number of excited states, which must then be analyzed in terms of orbitals and amplitudes in order to deduce which states possess CT character. With RASSF, on the other hand, one may target the CT states directly (essentially by fiat), so that these emerge as the lowest eigenvalues of the CT block of the Hamiltonian.11\n11\nTABLE III: RAS-SF/ and CIS/6-31G* excitation energies and excited-state dipole moments for the pentacene dimer model in Fig. 7(b), computed in various solvents using the nonequilibrium ptSS-PCM approach.\nState Multip.

The\nlatter calculations were performed in vacuo so the same is true for the RAS-SF calculations in Table IV. Both sets of calculations reveal four closely-spaced excited states of alternating multiplicity (singlet and triplet), with significant CT character as indicated by excited-state dipole moments \u00b5 \u2248 65 D. This comparison suggests at least a qualitative correspondence between the two levels of theory, even if the gas-phase excitation energies are rather different. In Ref. 61, the effects of solvent polarity were investigated by comparing excitation energies in vacuum to those computed in benzonitrile, using a SCRF model\n12\nin conjunction with a semi-empirical Hamiltonian. These results are reproduced in Table V alongside the corresponding RAS-SF + ptSS-PCM results.\nThe semi-empirical calculations from Ref. 61 afford four closely-spaced singlet excited states (in vacuum), in the range \u2206E = 2.63\u20132.97 eV, with dipole moments ranging from \u00b5 = 55.0\u201362.1 D. These are stabilized by 1.4\u20131.7 eV in benzonitrile. With RAS-SF and nonequilibrium ptSS-PCM solvation, we obtain four closely-spaced states ranging from \u2206E = 3.75\u20133.91 eV with dipole moments \u00b5 = 64.8\u201365.0 D, which are stabilized by 1.33 eV in benzonitrile. By contrast, the LE2 state hardly shifts at all in benzonitrile solvent. The present calculations corroborate the results in Ref. 61 indicating that CT states are considerably shifted whereas LE states are not."

            "text": "We have formulated, implemented, and tested a statespecific approach to solvation for RAS-SF wave functions. Both equilibrium (self-consistent and fully relaxed) and nonequilibrium (vertical excitation) versions are reported, the latter within a perturbative \u201cptSS\u201d approximation introduced in earlier work.20,21 This new\nmethodology opens the possibility to describe dielectric continuum effects on CT states within a cost-effective and easy-to-use wave function model for strong correlation, which can describe multi-exciton states and other types of excitations that are beyond the reach of (or poorly described by) single-excitation methods such as CIS and TD-DFT. Benchmark tests indicate good agreement with other methods for well-separated CT excitations (ion-pair states), in systems such as C2H4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C2F4 and (naphthalene)2. The ptSS approach to vertical excitation energies agrees with literature results for stabilization of CT states versus LE states, in a model of a covalently-linked pentacene dimer that undergoes intramolecular singlet fission.\nCalculations on (PDI)2 in two different geometries provide a rationale to understand the very different singlet fission rates that have previously been calculated for these systems. These calculations suggest that dielectric stabilization creates excitonic trap states in one geometry but not the other, by breaking symmetry and localizing charge. This observation has potentially important implications for the design of materials with good singlet fission rates, as the excitation spectra of model chromophores can now be easily tested as a function of solvent polarity. It also suggests that gas-phase calculations, even with highly correlated wave function models, may not offer a realistic description of singlet fission in solution, where polarization-induced charge localization is observed in solvents with dielectric constants as small as \u03b50 = 3, but not in vacuum (\u03b50 = 1).\nSupplementary Material\nCoordinates for the structures considered here."
