Cross-Cultural Comparisons of Tourist Waste Sorting Intentions: Conduct a comparative study across different cultural contexts to explore how cultural differences impact tourists' waste sorting intentions. Given the focus on a heritage site in China for the original study, examining similar behaviors in heritage sites across different countries could reveal unique cultural insights into sustainable tourism practices.

Longitudinal Study on the Sustainability of Waste Sorting Behaviors: Investigate the long-term sustainability of waste sorting behaviors among tourists by conducting a longitudinal study. This research could assess how tourists' waste sorting intentions and behaviors change over time and identify factors that contribute to sustained pro-environmental behaviors.

Experimental Studies on Interventions to Enhance Waste Sorting Behaviors: Utilize experimental designs to test the effectiveness of various interventions (e.g., educational programs, social media campaigns, gamification) designed to enhance tourists’ self-identity and moral norms related to waste sorting. This could help in identifying the most effective strategies for promoting sustainable waste management practices among tourists.

Impact of Digital Technologies on Tourists' Waste Sorting Intentions: Explore the role of digital technologies (e.g., mobile apps, virtual reality) in influencing tourists’ waste sorting intentions. Research could focus on how technology can be used to enhance awareness, improve convenience, and strengthen moral norms and self-identity related to environmental conservation.

Comparative Study of Habitual versus Unhabitual Environmental Behaviors: Conduct a study comparing tourists' waste sorting behaviors in their home environment versus while traveling. This research could delve into the psychological and contextual factors that lead to different environmental behaviors in habitual versus unhabitual settings, providing insights into how to encourage consistent pro-environmental behaviors regardless of setting.
