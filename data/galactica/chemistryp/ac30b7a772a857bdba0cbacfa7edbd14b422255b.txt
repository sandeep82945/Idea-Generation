In this research, a simple, label-free, and ultra-sensitive fluorescent platform based on a metal–organic framework (MOF) has been developed to detect melamine in milk powder. This fluorescence sensor was fabricated from sensitized terbium (Tb)@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF using a hydrothermal method that involved combining the green emission of Tb (λem = 545 nm) with the blue emission of NH2-MIL-253(Al) MOF (λem = 430 nm) under a single excitation wavelength (λex = 335 nm). The fluorescence sensor was then used under optimized conditions (pH = 9.0; sensor concentration = 30 mg/L; response time = 30 s) to quantify melamine in milk powder. The accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility of this sensor were established compared to the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The linear range and lower limit of detection (LLOD, computed with 3σ/S) of the sensor were between 40–396.45 nM (equal to 25 μg/kg–0.25 mg/kg) and 40 nM (equal to 25 μg/kg), respectively, which is much less than the maximum residual level (MRL) for the detection of melamine in infant formula (1 mg/kg) and other foods/feeds (2.5 mg/kg). Additionally, the results had good agreement with the HPLC outcomes, suggesting that the NH2-MIL253(Al) MOF sensing probe has great precision and repeatability. To conclude, the new fluorescence sensor developed in this study can accurately and sensitively detect melamine in food samples, which may be useful for screening for adulteration of milk powders and other foods. 1. conclusions Porous NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF was synthesized using a one-pot reaction hydrothermal method and then used to encapsulate Tb3+ ions to fabricate the Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF sensing platform. The resulting Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF fluorescence platform had dual emission signals, which enabled the fluorescence detection of melamine in a real milk powder sample. The Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF sensing platform had good sensitivity and selectivity towards melamine. The florescence intensity was decreased at 430 and 545 nm, upon the addition of melamine. The Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF sensing system displayed a wide linear range between 40–396.45 nM, a lower limit of detection (40 nM), and a quick response time (30 s). More importantly, the Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF could be utilized for the detection of melamine in real milk powder samples with good recovery (98.5–102.6%) and RSD (1.8% to 3.3%) values, which had a good agreement with the results from HPLC. Accordingly, the Tb@NH2-MIL-253 (Al) MOF sensing platform can be considered as having potential applications for detecting melamine in milk powders.
