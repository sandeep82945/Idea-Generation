1. **Investigate the relationship between the chemical composition and biological activities of propolis extracts:** 
This could be done by analyzing the correlation between the levels of specific compounds (e.g., flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenes) and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts. This information could be used to identify the compounds responsible for the biological activities of propolis and to develop standardized extracts with consistent bioactivities.


2. **Evaluate the effects of propolis extracts on specific diseases or conditions:** 
This could be done by conducting in vivo studies using animal models of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative disorders. These studies could provide evidence for the potential therapeutic effects of propolis and help to identify the mechanisms of action.


3. **Explore the potential of propolis extracts as food additives or nutraceuticals:** 
This could be done by investigating the effects of propolis extracts on food quality, safety, and shelf life. Additionally, the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of propolis extracts could be exploited to develop natural food preservatives or supplements to improve human health.


4. **Investigate the potential of propolis extracts as cosmetic ingredients:** 
This could be done by evaluating the effects of propolis extracts on skin health and appearance. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of propolis extracts could be beneficial for reducing wrinkles, fine lines, and other signs of aging.


5. **Develop new methods for the extraction and purification of propolis compounds:** 
This could be done by exploring the use of novel extraction techniques, such as supercritical fluid extraction or microwave-assisted extraction. Additionally, new methods for the purification of propolis compounds could be developed to obtain high-purity compounds for use in research or clinical applications.
