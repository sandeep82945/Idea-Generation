    "abstractText": "Three-dimensional correlations of the Lyman-\u03b1 (Ly\u03b1) forest and cross correlations between the Ly\u03b1 forest and quasars have been measured on large scales, allowing a precise measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature at redshifts z > 2. These 3D correlations are often modelled using linear perturbation theory, but full-shape analyses to extract cosmological information beyond BAO will require more realistic models capable of describing non-linearities present at smaller scales. We present a measurement of the Ly\u03b1 forest flux power spectrum from large hydrodynamic simulations \u2014 the Sherwood simulations \u2014 and compare it to different models describing the small-scale deviations from linear theory. We confirm that the model presented in Arinyo-i-Prats et al. (2015) fits the measured 3D power up to k = 10 hMpc\u22121 with an accuracy better than 5%, and show that the same model can also describe the 1D correlations with similar precision. We also present, for the first time, an equivalent study for the cross-power spectrum of halos with the Ly\u03b1 forest, and we discuss different challenges we face when modelling the crosspower spectrum beyond linear scales. We make all our measured power spectra public in https://github.com/andreufont/sherwood_p3d. This study is a step towards joint analyses of 1D and 3D flux correlations, and towards using the quasar-Ly\u03b1 cross-correlation beyond BAO analyses.",

            "text": "The Lyman-\u03b1 forest (Ly\u03b1 forest) is a series of absorption features in the spectra of highredshift quasars caused by the presence of intervening neutral hydrogen. During the last decade, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS, [1]) and its extension eBOSS [2] have obtained over 341,000 quasar spectra at z > 1.77. These surveys were able to measure the 3D autocorrelation of the Ly\u03b1 forest of quasars at z > 2.1 [3\u20139] and its 3D crosscorrelation with the quasar positions [9\u201313], allowing researchers to detect baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) around z = 2.3 in increasingly larger datasets.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nBy examining the BAO scale as a function of redshift, researchers may measure both the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter across cosmic time. Recently, [14] suggested that these measurements can be improved through the inclusion of Alcock-Paczyn\u0301ski measurements [15] from the full-shape (\u201cbroadband\u201d) correlations. This information provides valuable insights into the nature of dark energy. Reference [14] also suggested that a joint, broadband analysis of both power spectra could be used to measure the amplitude of redshift-space distortions (RSD) in the quasar sample. RSDs are often parameterized with f\u03c38, a quantity sensitive to the growth of structure. Comparing growth of structure and expansion history allows us to test general relativity, and the statistical power of these tests will depend on the minimum separation that we can reliably model. The first main goal of this publication is to quantify the deviations from linear theory of both correlations (Ly\u03b1 auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasars), and to compare models that would allow us to extend these studies to mildly non-linear scales. The same quasar spectra can be used to study the clustering of matter on scales of a few megaparsecs via measurements of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum, or P1D [16\u201324]. In combination with the large-scale measurements from the cosmic microwave background, these P1D measurements allow tight constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, the shape of the primordial power spectrum (both are referenced in [25\u201334]), and several dark matter models [34\u201345]. However, while BAO analyses model the large-scale correlations using mainly linear perturbation theory 1, P1D analyses have to rely on hydrodynamic simulations to model non-linearities in the distribution of gas and the physics of the intergalactic medium (IGM). So far, these BAO and P1D analyses have been carried out as independent measurements. Recently, [46] suggested an algorithm to consistently measure all relevant 1D and 3D correlations in the Ly\u03b1 forest. This joint analysis would not only improve the statistical uncertainty on some cosmological parameters, but it would also make both measurements more robust against possible systematic errors. For instance, both measurements need to marginalise over the impact of Damped Lyman-\u03b1 systems (DLAs), residual contamination from metal absorbers, and errors in the continuum fitting of the quasar spectra. In order to carry out these joint analyses, however, we need a theoretical framework to coherently model all scales involved. The second main goal of this publication is to study whether models that describe the 3D correlations in the Ly\u03b1 forest can consistently describe its 1D correlations on small scales. Modeling the Ly\u03b1 forest 3D auto-power spectrum at non-linear scales has historically been done through a combination of perturbation theory and simulations. Generally, one begins by modeling the Ly\u03b1 forest flux fluctuation field at linear order using Kaiser\u2019s relation for the redshift-space clustering of matter tracers [47]. From there, one may proceed down a \u201cpure perturbation theory\u201d path or take a \u201cfitting function\u201d path. To proceed down the former, one adds higher-order terms consistent with symmetries of the forest to the linear flux fluctuation field [48\u201351] and autocorrelates the result. Bias coefficients are found by fitting the model to simulation outputs. An advantage of the perturbation theory approach is that each term has a clear physical interpretation; a disadvantage is that these models break down on scales where perturbations approach order unity. The fitting function path was pioneered by [52] and later improved in [53]. In this approach, the linear theory power spectrum is multiplied by a non-linear correction term with multiple free parameters. Just as before, the power spectrum model is fit to simulation outputs to find the optimal parameter values. The\n1The non-linear broadening of the BAO peak is usually based on Lagrangian perturbation theory, but it has a small effect on these high-redshift BAO results.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nfitting function approach typically provides better fits relative to the perturbation theory approach at higher wavenumbers (i.e. on non-linear scales), but a physical interpretation of the parameters is not always clear. In order to study different approaches to model the non-linearities in the Ly\u03b1 forest and its cross-correlation with halos, it is useful to look at clustering measurements from hydrodynamic simulations. Ideally these simulations would be large enough to contain many massive halos and have enough linear modes to study the deviations from linear theory. However, these hydrodynamic simulations need a high resolution in order to fully resolve the Ly\u03b1 forest, and one needs to trade resolution and box size. In this publication we use the outputs from some of the largest boxes in the Sherwood suite of hydrodynamic simulations [54], and present the most detailed measurements of the 3D power spectrum of the Ly\u03b1 forest and of its cross-correlation with halos. These allow us to compare different models for the Ly\u03b1 forest auto-correlation, and we present the first detailed discussion on the non-linearities in its cross-correlation with halos. 2 We organize this paper in the following way: we start in section 2 by briefly describing the Sherwood simulations and data products that we use. In section 3 we detail the methodology used to compare the different auto- and cross-power spectra measurements with models. In section 4 we review existing models for the Ly\u03b1 forest power spectrum and compare them to the measured one. We do the same for the halo power spectrum in section 5. In section 6 we discuss models for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo spectrum, and study its dependence with halo mass. We discuss the results and mention possible extensions in section 7 before concluding in section 8."

            "text": "The Sherwood simulation suite is a set of large, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) with up to 17.2 billion particles in comoving volumes 103 \u2212 1603 h\u22123Mpc3 [54]. The combination of box size and resolution makes them very well-suited for studies of the Ly\u03b1 forest in the mildly non-linear regime. All simulations were run using a modified version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code P-Gadget3, an updated version of Gadget-2 [56]. The initial conditions were generated at z = 99 using the N-GenIC code [56] according to an input power spectrum corresponding to a cosmology based on the best-fit flat \u039bCDM model from the first results of the Planck satellite [57], i.e. with \u2126m = 0.308, \u2126b = 0.0482, h = 0.678, \u03c38 = 0.829 and ns = 0.961. A homogeneous ionising background is used to calculate photoionization and photoheating rates assuming the gas is optically thin and in photoionization equilibrium. In this publication we will limit our study to snapshots in the relatively low-redshift range 2 < z < 3.2 where BOSS, eBOSS and DESI have measured 3D correlations. As described in [54], Ly\u03b1\n2The cross-correlation function (in configuration space) was measured from LyMAS simulations in [55], but the authors did not discuss extensions of linear theory.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nforest measurements at these redshifts are less affected by the reionization model assumed in the simulation relative to measurements at higher redshifts.\nAs is common in large simulations of the Ly\u03b1 forest, the computing time is dramatically reduced by removing gas particles at overdensities above \u2206 > 1000 and temperatures below T < 105K and converting them to collisionless particles [21]. This approximation, usually known as Quick-Lya, is valid on the low and intermediate densities that dominate the information in the Ly\u03b1 forest. However, as discussed in [58, 59], this approximation effectively removes all gas within the virial radius of halos.\nIn order to properly simulate these high-density regions around massive halos, it would not be enough to keep the gas particles removed by Quick-Lya. We also expect these regions to be affected by different feedback mechanisms not present in the simulations, including the ionizing radiation from quasars themselves. Moreover, we expect the majority of large neutral hydrogen absorbers, including Lyman limit systems and Damped Ly\u03b1 systems, to come from the vicinity of massive halos; the Sherwood simulations used in this analysis are optically thin, and do not incorporate self-shielding corrections necessary to reproduce the abundances of these systems. In the next sections we will have to keep this in mind when studying the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo cross-correlations on small scales.\nThe main results discussed in this paper will come from the simulation L160 N2048, where the box size is L = 160 h\u22121Mpc and the number of CDM particles and gas particles in the simulation is N = 20483. We present some results from the L80 N2048 and the L80 N1024 simulations in appendix A. Even though the Sherwood simulations are the state of the art in terms of hydrodynamical simulations of the Ly\u03b1 forest, they have not formally converged, and this should be taken into account when interpreting the results.\nLy\u03b1 datasets typically cover a wide redshift range 2 < z < 5. While Ly\u03b1 BAO results have an effective redshift around z = 2.3 [9], P1D analyses have an effective redshift closer to z = 3 [60]. Most of the results presented in this publication are from a snapshot taken at z = 2.8, but in appendix B we show results at z = 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, and 3.2.\n\u2013 4 \u2013"

The IGM around z = 2\u22124 is smoothed by gas pressure, suppressing structure on scales smaller than the filtering length \u03bbF \u223c 50 h\u22121kpc [62]. Unfortunately, memory availability in our post-processing of the simulations limits our analysis to a 3D grid of (1024)2 \u00d7 2048 cells, with a cell size of 156 h\u22121kpc in the transverse direction and 78 h\u22121kpc along the line of sight. In appendix A we show that while the measured power spectra are affected by the resolution of these grids, they mostly affect the very high-k modes and do not change the main conclusions presented in this paper.\nThe left panel of figure 1 shows a 2D slab of the Ly\u03b1 forest transmitted flux fraction from the snapshot at z = 2.8 of the smaller L80 N1024 simulation. This is displayed using a grid of 5122 \u00d7 1024 to match the resolution of the main grid used in this section.\nAll Ly\u03b1 statistics in this paper are computed for fluctuations around a mean transmitted flux fraction, defined as:\n\u03b4F (x) \u2261 F (x)\nF\u0304 \u2212 1 , (2.1)\nwhere F (x) = e\u2212\u03c4(x) is the transmitted flux fraction, and \u03c4(x) is Ly\u03b1 optical depth in redshift space. The upper panel of figure 2 shows the measured power spectrum of the Ly\u03b1 fluctuations at z = 2.8 in the larger box (L160 N2048) as a function of wavenumber k and the cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and the line of sight \u00b5 (modes with \u00b5 = 1 are parallel to the line of sight).\nThe power spectra are computed using the average of the square of the norm for all Fourier modes in the box, binned in 16 bins in \u00b5 and 20 log-spaced bins in wavenumber k, ranging from the fundamental mode of the box (k0 = 2\u03c0/L = 0.039 hMpc\n\u22121) to a maximum wavenumber of 20 hMpc\u22121 which is half the Nyquist frequency.\nOn large scales (small wavenumbers), one can see that the line-of-sight power (red) is boosted by a constant factor with respect to the transverse power (dark blue), as expected in the case of linear bias and linear redshift-space distortions [47]. As discussed later in section 4, non-linearities become important around k = 0.5 hMpc\u22121. Non-linear peculiar velocities and thermal broadening suppress the power along the line of sight, before gas pressure smooths the power on all directions around k = 10.0 hMpc\u22121.\nIn order to reduce the cosmic variance in our measurements, we extract Ly\u03b1 absorption skewers along each of the three axes of the box, using a different component of the 3D velocity vector to include redshift-space distortions [63]. All power spectra discussed in this paper are computed as the average of the power spectra computed along each of the three axes. The errorbars shown in the plots are estimated from the number of Fourier modes entering each band power; they ignore the correlation between measurements along the different axes and the correlation between different Fourier modes within a band power (or across band powers).\nThe power spectra measurements used in this paper are available online in https: //github.com/andreufont/sherwood_p3d.\n3https://github.com/sbird/fake_spectra.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\n\u2013 6 \u2013"

In order to measure the halo power spectrum and the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo spectrum, we start by discretising this catalog in the same 3D grid that we used for the Ly\u03b1 skewers. We do this using a nearest-grid-point interpolation. The third panel of figure 2 shows the measured halo power spectrum once the shot-noise, estimated as the inverse of the halo density, has been subtracted. The second panel of the same figure shows the measured Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo spectrum, multiplied by (\u22121) to make it a positive quantity on the largest scales (as seen in figure 1, these fields are anti-correlated). On small, non-linear scales, the cross-power changes sign and becomes positive, causing a sharp feature in this logarithmic plot. It is important to remember that the simulations used the Quick-Lya approximation, replacing gas particles in very high-density regions with collisionless particles, and resulting in a transmission field positively correlated with the halo density on scales comparable to their virial radius. Finally, the fourth panel of figure 2 shows the correlation coefficient between the two grids, defined as\n\u03c1(k, \u00b5) = PX(k, \u00b5)\u221a\nPF (k, \u00b5)PH(k, \u00b5) . (2.2)\nOn very large scales (k < 0.3 hMpc\u22121) the two fields are highly anti-correlated, with \u03c1 < \u22120.9. Even on smaller scales of k = 1 hMpc\u22121, the line-of-sight (red) remain 90% anti-correlated, while the anti-correlation has dropped to 70% for the transverse modes (dark blue). This strong anti-correlation motivates the model for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo spectrum discussed in section 6. Our principal motivation in carrying out this study is to improve the modeling of the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 quasar spectrum; its correlation function analog was recently measured by BOSS and eBOSS [9\u201313] and is one of the key measurements expected from DESI. Quasars are\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nhighly biased tracers, with typical values of bq = 3.5 measured at z \u223c 2.5 [10]. They are typically hosted in dark matter halos larger than \u223c 1012M at the relevant redshift range. Unfortunately, as can be seen in figure 3, most of the halos in our simulated box are much smaller \u2014 we have only a few thousand halos with a mass similar to those expected to host quasars. Therefore, most plots in this publication use all halos regardless of mass, except in section 6 where we also show the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo power for the highest mass bin."

We could have weighted each band power using the inverse of its uncertainty, computed from the number (N3Di ) of Fourier modes that contribute to each band. However, in this study we combine the power spectrum measured along the three axes of our box, and their modes are not independent. Moreover, as discussed in references [52, 53], the standard fit would be dominated by the high-k data points that have very small errorbars; that would make it difficult to model the large scales comparable to our box size. Following [52, 53], we modify the standard weights by adding a noise floor ( ):\nw \u22121/2 i = Pi [ 1\u221a Ni + ] .

The shot-noise in the halos already provide a natural noise floor for the halo auto power spectrum and its cross-power spectrum with the Ly\u03b1 forest. We only include data points with k < kmax. When fitting the flux power spectrum we use by default kmax = 10 hMpc\n\u22121, and we discuss the impact of varying these settings in appendix A.

            "text": "Two decades ago, [52] presented a model for the flux power spectrum that was able to fit the 3D power measured in hydro-PM simulations down to very small scales (k = 10 hMpc\u22121). It accomplishes this by introducing a multiplicative correction to the linear model, containing 8 free parameters describing non-linearities and the physics of the IGM. That correction term is\nDNL(k, \u00b5) = exp\n{[ k\nkNL\n]\u03b1NL \u2212 [ k\nkP\n]\u03b1P \u2212 [ k||\nkV (k)\n]\u03b1V } , (4.4)\nwith kV (k) = kv0(1 + k/kv1) av1 . The first term in the exponential accounts for isotropic nonlinear growth, the second for isotropic suppression due to pressure, and the third for lineof-sight suppression arising from non-linear peculiar velocities and thermal broadening [52]. The product of equations (4.1) and (4.4) is what we will refer to as the McDonald model. A similar analysis was carried out the following decade on outputs from GADGET-II simulations [53], and using a modified correction:\nDNL(k, \u00b5) = exp {[ q1\u2206 2(k) + q2\u2206 4(k) ] [ 1\u2212 ( k\nkv\n)av \u00b5bv ] \u2212 ( k\nkp\n)2} , (4.5)\nwhere\n\u22062(k) \u2261 k 3\n2\u03c02 PL(k) (4.6)\nis the dimensionless linear matter power spectrum. When comparing this model to the measured flux power spectrum from section 2, we find that the best-fit value for the second order non-linear growth (q2) is very close to zero. Therefore we decided to ignore this extra term, reducing the number of free parameters to 5 (compared to the 8 parameters in the McDonald model). We will call the product of equations (4.1) and (4.5) the Arinyo model. The top panel of figure 4 shows the best-fit predictions for both models compared to the measured 3D power spectra. The 3D power spectra have been divided by the linear power spectrum at the given redshift to highlight the deviations from linear theory on small scales (high-k). In the bottom panel, we plot the residuals from the best-fit Arinyo model. Cosmic variance causes large fluctuations on large scales (low-k), but the residuals on intermediate and small scales (k < 10 hMpc\u22121) are within 5%.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nThe ratio of both best-fit models is shown with dashed lines in the bottom panel of figure 4. The best-fit linear bias parameter from the Arinyo model (bF = \u22120.234) is 3% larger than the value from the McDonald model (bF = \u22120.227). As discussed in [53], the modelling of non-linear growth in the McDonald model (an exponential term) extends to much larger scales than the modelling in the Arinyo model. The best-fit values for the RSD parameters are similarly consistent: \u03b2F = 1.34 (Arinyo) and \u03b2F = 1.31 (McDonald). The minimum values of pseudo-\u03c72 are also very similar, \u03c72 = 48.1 (Arinyo) and \u03c72 = 48.0 (McDonald) with 225 data points. 4 Given that the Arinyo model has 3 fewer free parameters, we decide to use that model in the following sections."

DIGM is a small-scale correction that models gas pressure with an isotropic Gaussian suppression and thermal broadening with another Gaussian suppression along the line of sight. Even though the authors of [49] only proposed this model for analyses of the 1D power spectrum, here we discuss the interesting idea of using perturbation theory at one-loop to model the mildly non-linear regime of the 3D flux power spectrum.\nTransverse modes (\u00b5 = 0) of the flux power spectrum are not affected by redshift-space distortions and offer a cleaner path to study the effect of non-linear growth of structure on the Ly\u03b1 forest. As can be seen in figure 5, the transverse flux power spectrum at z = 2.8 (blue band) rises above linear theory around k = 0.3 hMpc\u22121 until the effect of gas pressure suppresses the power around k = 7 hMpc\u22121. The dashed black line shows the best-fit Arinyo model (again with q2 = 0) from figure 4; the dot-dashed red line shows the same model without the pressure cut-off. The solid gray line further sets q1 = 0, effectively becoming a Kaiser model. Last, the dotted green line shows the prediction from the one-loop model of equation (4.7) without the IGM correction when using the same large scale bias parameters (bF ,\u03b2F ) as the other models. As we will see in the next sections, these one-loop models (proposed initially by [64] in the context of galaxy clustering) are quite successful in modeling the 3D power spectrum of halos. The Ly\u03b1 forest, however, is less sensitive to the high-density regions of the box where the flux quickly saturates to F = 0 and non-linearities in the flux power spectrum\n\u2013 11 \u2013\ngrow slower than those in the matter power spectrum. As shown in figure 5, this causes the one-loop model to over-predict the growth of structure in the Ly\u03b1 forest. In [49], the impact of non-linearities on the 1D flux power spectrum is captured by adding a counterterm that parameterizes the impact of strong small-scale non-linearities, along the lines of effective field theory (EFT) methods. For the 3D spectrum, the counterterm from [49] is not sufficient, since it describes the influence of non-linear corrections on the integrated 1D spectrum only, by construction. Instead, a more detailed EFT model would be required for the 3D spectrum, along the lines of [65]. Nevertheless, the one-loop model correctly describes the onset of deviations from the linear Kaiser formula, within the regime k . 0.5 hMpc\u22121 where these corrections are small. This corresponds to the expected range of validity of perturbative methods. Increasing the range of agreement would require to include two-loop terms [48] along with corresponding counterterms [66]. While being limited in k range to weakly non-linear scales, the perturbative treatment has the advantage of being applicable also to non-standard cosmological models and can be evaluated efficiently for a large set of parameters. It is possible to further improve the perturbative description in the BAO range by taking infrared resummation into account [67\u201369]. It captures the impact of large-scale flows on the BAO feature in a systematic manner in real and redshift space [70, 71], leading to a broadening of the BAO peak in the correlation function, and a damping of the BAO oscillations in the power spectrum. The IR resummation can easily be implemented in the perturbative model by replacing the linear spectrum that enters the loop computation by a modified input spectrum, obtained by decomposing P lin = P nw + Pw into a smooth (non-wiggly) and an oscillating (wiggly) contribution, and multiplying the latter with a particular Gaussian damping factor [70, 71]. While IR resummation is important within the BAO range, it does not change the behaviour of perturbative predictions of the power spectrum in a sizeable way at large wavenumbers k & 0.5 hMpc\u22121 shown in figure 5."

They replaced PL(k) by a quasi-linear power spectrum that decoupled the BAO peak from the smooth component in order to model the non-linear broadening of the BAO peak [74] (see also discussion at the end of section 4). However, given the limited box size of our simulations, we do not attempt to model this non-linear broadening of the BAO wiggles, and we will focus here on the deviations from linear theory on small scales. In order to build our first non-linear model for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo correlations, we use again the geometrical mean of the two power spectra. This time, however, we use the Arinyo\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nmodel to describe the flux component:\nPFh(k, \u00b5) = bh(1 + \u03b2h\u00b5 2) bF (1 + \u03b2F\u00b5 2) PL(k) \u221a DNL(k, \u00b5) , (6.2)\nwhere DNL(k, \u00b5) is the small-scales correction described in equation (4.5). We will refer to this equation as the baseline model for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo cross-correlation. Instead of fitting this model to the measured cross-correlation, we start by making predictions when using the best-fit values measured from the Ly\u03b1 forest auto-correlation in section 4, and the halo bias measured from the halo auto-correlation in section 5. Because of the difficulties in modelling RSDs in the halo power spectrum, we use instead the halo bias measured from the real space halo power spectrum (see figure 6). The dotted lines in figure 8 show the predicted cross-correlation using equation (6.2). Unfortunately, this simple model (without any free parameter) does not seem to perform any better than the Kaiser model, and it overpredicts the signal in the transverse direction (blue lines). In order to improve the model for the line-of-sight signal (in red), we also add a fit that includes an extra term to model Fingers-of-God (FoG) in the halos:\nPFh(k, \u00b5) = bh(1 + \u03b2h\u00b5 2) bF (1 + \u03b2F\u00b5 2) PL(k) \u221a DNL(k, \u00b5) DFoG(k, \u00b5) , (6.3)\nwhere DFoG(k, \u00b5) is the Lorentzian function from equation (5.3). The dot-dashed lines in the top panel of figure 8 show the best-fit model when fitting \u03c3v using wavenumbers smaller than kmax = 2 hMpc\n\u22121 (gray dashed vertical line). The bottom panel of figure 8 shows the residuals for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo power when using\nthe Baseline model (no free parameters), as well as the ratio of the different models. The simple Kaiser model of equation (6.1) properly describes the measured correlations up to k = 1 hMpc\u22121, with an accuracy better than 5%. The other models, however, seem to overpredict the clustering of the transverse modes (blue lines). It is important to keep in mind that measurements of the cross-correlation of quasars and the Ly\u03b1 forest are affected by quasar redshift errors. Assuming a Gaussian suppression with \u03c3v = 500 km s\n\u22121, typical of quasar surveys at z > 2 [9], we compute the wavenumber where half of the power would be suppressed. These are shown as vertical colored dotted lines, as a function of \u00b5. Disagreements on scales much smaller than these are not necessarily relevant, since they will be highly suppressed by quasar redshift errors when analysing real data."

More importantly, as discussed in section 2.1, the Quick-Lya approximation used in this and many other simulations of the Ly\u03b1 forest artificially removes gas from the high-density regions and biases the measurements of the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo correlation on small scales. Besides these issues with the measurements, in this section we discuss three other problems that we encounter when modelling the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo cross-correlation. First, as discussed in appendix B of [75], the cross-correlation of halos with the Ly\u03b1 forest can be computed as the mean value of the Ly\u03b1 fluctuations at a given separation from a halo:\n\u03beX(r) = \u3008\u03b4F \u3009r , (7.2)\nwhere the expected value is computed using only pixels at a separation r. In the absence of instrumental noise, the value of flux can not be negative. This implies that the crosscorrelation always has to satisfy \u03beX(r) \u2265 \u22121. However, our power spectrum models do not know about this natural threshold. As can be seen in the bottom-left panel of figure 11, it seems that our extended model asymptotically reaches \u03beX = \u22121. However, we have tested that small variations in the model result in non-physical correlations with \u03beX(r) < \u22121. Second, the models discussed in section 6 are motivated by the assumption that the Ly\u03b1 forest field and the halo density are strongly (anti-) correlated, and try to build a model from the geometrical mean of auto-correlation models. However, in the left panel of figure 12 we compare the correlation coefficient when using all halos (dashed lines, also seen in figure 2) and when using only the most massive halos (solid lines). For the massive halos, half of the anti-correlation has already been lost on scales of k = 0.5 hMpc\u22121. The ad-hoc correction from equation (6.4) can capture this by fitting negative values for \u03b1, but it is difficult to propose physically-motivated models when the fields become increasingly uncorrelated. Finally, our models assume that the cross-power spectrum is negative on all scales. However, the right panel of figure 12 clearly shows that the cross-power for the most massive halos changes sign around k = 3 hMpc\u22121, except for the most transverse modes (in dark blue). This might be a consequence of the Quick-Lya approximation used in the simulations,\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nand it would be interesting to carry out an equivalent study of these small-scale correlations in configuration space."

            "text": "We have presented the most accurate measurement of the 3D power spectrum of fluctuations in the Ly\u03b1 forest to date, using outputs from the Sherwood suite of hydrodynamic simulations 7. These simulations are considerably larger (20 times more particles) than those used in the current state-of-the-art measurements of [53]. We have also presented, for the first time, a measurement of the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo 3D cross-power spectrum. The Ly\u03b1 forest and the halo catalog are strongly anti-correlated on all scales relevant for BAO analyses (\u03c1 < \u22120.9 at k < 0.3 hMpc\u22121). The most massive halos, however, are less anti-correlated (left panel of figure 12). We have made these measurements public 8 to encourage other teams to work on the modelling of these correlations. We have confirmed that the non-linear models of [52] and [53] are able to describe the 3D flux power spectrum down to small scales, and that the second-order non-linear growth parameter (q2) in [53] is not required to obtain a good fit. In figures 4 and 10 we show that the Arinyo model can predict at the same time 1D and 3D correlations, with 3D residuals smaller than 5% on scales smaller than k < 10 hMpc\u22121, and 1D residuals smaller than 2% for k < 4 hMpc\u22121. This opens the possibility of joint fits of 1D and 3D correlations observed by BOSS and eBOSS, and the possibility of building 1D emulators based on 3D models. The non-linearities in the Ly\u03b1 forest power spectrum are smaller than those in the matter power spectrum (see figure 5). Dense regions in the simulation quickly saturate the transmitted flux fraction to F = 0, acting as a natural shield that protects the Ly\u03b1 forest from the details of non-linear growth. The bottom panel of figure 8 shows that the Kaiser model describes the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo power spectrum with residuals smaller than 5% even on scales as small as k = 1 hMpc\u22121, when using all halos in the simulation. However, it does not describe well the correlation with the most massive halos, representative of quasars. In equation (6.4) we present an ad-hoc multiplicative correction to the model that can improve the fit considerably, with residuals smaller than 10% up to k < 1 hMpc\u22121. Even though the Sherwood suite is the state of the art in terms of simulations of the Ly\u03b1 forest, in appendix A we show that the measurements presented here are still affected by their limited box size and resolution. Uncertainties in the cosmological model assumed in the simulation, as well as in the assumed thermal and ionization history, could also modify significantly the measured power spectra. For this reason we do not focus on the actual best-fit parameter values that we obtain when analysing this particular simulation; as we show in appendix A, both the large scale bias and the pressure terms are affected by the limitations of the simulations. In section 7 we list a couple of fundamental issues with our approach to model the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo cross-correlation. By definition, the cross-correlation function cannot be more negative than \u03be = \u22121 (corresponding to F = 0 or \u03b4F = \u22121), but our Fourier-space models are not aware of this. A second limitation of our models is that they are not allowed to change sign, while the measured Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo cross-power seems to change sign around k = 3 hMpc\u22121 as shown in the right panel of figure 12. We caution the reader that the measurement itself can\n7https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/sherwood 8https://github.com/andreufont/sherwood_p3d\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nbe corrupted in these small scales. The Quick-Lya approximation used in the simulations artificially removes gas from the vicinity of the dark matter halos. Finally, in figure 11 we show that on scales relevant for BAO analyses, the best-fit nonlinear models predict small deviations from linear theory. This is particularly true for the Ly\u03b1 forest auto-correlation, while larger deviations in the cross-correlation with the most massive halos appear on scales below r = 30 h\u22121Mpc for the most transverse separations. This investigation is timely since the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI [76]) started its five-year program in May 2021, and it will soon provide the largest Ly\u03b1 forest dataset to date. While the main goal of the DESI Ly\u03b1 dataset is to measure BAO, this study is a step towards cosmological analyses using the full shape of the 3D correlations."

            "text": "A.1 Convergence of simulation boxes\nMost measurements discussed in the main text use the largest simulation L160 N2048, with box size L = 160 h\u22121Mpc and N = 20483 CDM and gas particles. In order to study the impact of box size, in the left panel of figure 13 we compare the measurement from this box with the measurement from a simulation that has the same particle resolution, but a smaller box size (L80 N1024). Sample variance due to the limited box sizes makes it difficult to compare the large-scale measurement, but one can see small differences extending to all scales. Note, however, that this ratio is affected by interpolation artifacts, since the values of wavenumbers k in the two measurements do not match. In the right panel of figure 13 we study the impact of particle resolution, using two simulations with L = 80 h\u22121Mpc, but different number of particles. The simulation L80 N1024 has the same particle resolution as the box used in the main text, while the simulation L80 N2048 has 8 times more particles in the same volume. On large scales, particle resolution impacts the value of the large scale bias and redshift space distortion parameter, at the order of a few percent. On small scales, the gas in the simulation with lower particle resolution seems to have a stronger pressure smoothing.\nA.2 Convergence of grids\nMemory restrictions in the post-processing of the simulations limit our analysis to a 3D grid of (1024)2 \u00d7 2048 cells, with a cell size of 0.156 h\u22121Mpc in the transverse direction and 0.078 h\u22121Mpc along the line of sight. Here we study the impact of this pixelisation in the flux power, using the L80 N1024 simulation, with a smaller box but the same resolution as our largest simulation. In figure 14 we compare the 3D flux power from our default simulation box, when varying the resolution of the 3D grid. In the left panel we vary the transverse resolution of the grid, and show that even the default setting (blue line) is not quite converged, with 4% differences on the smallest scales used in the fits. In the right panel we vary instead the line-of-sight pixelisation, and show that the default pixelisation (red lines) caused a biased\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nmeasurement of the large-scale power of order 1%, and a bias of order 4% on the smallest scales used in the fits.\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nA.3 Alternative fit configurations\nAs described in section 3, the default analysis of the flux power spectrum minimises a pseudo\u03c72, defined in equation (3.1), that weights the different band powers based on the number of Fourier modes that contribute to a particular bin. In order to down-weight high-k modes, that would otherwise dominate the fit, we follow [52, 53] and modify the weights by adding a noise floor ( ) (equation (3.2)). The left panel of figure 15 shows the impact of on the best-fit Arinyo model. While the default analyses uses the same value of = 0.05 used in [53], a noise floor five times smaller give almost indistinguishable results (solid lines). Ignoring the noise floor completely (dotted lines) have a noticable impact on the best-fit large-scale biases. In the right panel of figure 15 we study the impact of varying the maximum wavenumber kmax used in the fits. Decreasing (solid) or increasing (dotted) the default value of kmax = 10 hMpc\u22121 have only minor effects on the best fit, mostly limited to the modelling of pressure on the smallest scales."

            "text": "Most of the analyses presented in this paper use the snapshot at z = 2.8. However, the Ly\u03b1 forest data usually spans a wide range of redshift, and in this appendix we reproduce some of the key results at different redshifts. In order to reduce the computational requirements of this comparison, we use outputs from the small box simulation L80 N1024 (80 h\u22121Mpc, 10243 particles) and the same grid resolution than the main analysis. This is justified by the convergence tests presented in appendix A. In figures 16 to 19 we redo the analysis of the flux power (top panels) and Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo power (bottom panels) at redshifts z = 2.0, 2.4, 2.8 and 3.2. At all redshifts the flux power is well described by the Arinyo model, while the baseline model for the Ly\u03b1 \u00d7 halo crosscorrelation (without free parameters) is only a good description on relatively large scales.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\u2013 31 \u2013"
