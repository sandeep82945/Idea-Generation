"Our findings add important and timely updates to the growing literature on the temporal linkages between the Trump sociopolitical environment and adverse birth outcomes among Latina mothers in the US [13,14]. In their recent study examining changes in birth outcomes among the aggregate population of Latina mothers, Gemmill and colleagues find that the risk of PTB increased by 3.2–3.6% in the year following Trump’s 2016 presidential election [13]. Our results show that the risks of adverse birth outcomes continued to increase in the subsequent years of Trump’s presidential term, and that the worsening of birth outcomes were most severe among foreign-born Mexican mothers. By extending the period of investigation to account for Trump’s entire political career, and by analyzing births across nativity and country/region of origin, our findings draw attention to the possibility that the Trump era may have represented a source of chronic stress among Latina mothers, and provide new evidence on how racism in the sociopolitical environment may vary across subgroups within the Latinx population."

"Still, several other potential pathways could account for the temporal changes in birth outcomes that occurred during the Trump study periods, including maternal changes in diet and exercise, family income and social support, and quality of health care. Future research should examine these and other potential pathways to uncover more information about the temporal linkages between the Trump sociopolitical era and adverse birth outcomes among Latina mothers."
