            "text": "The past few years have witnessed a surge of interest in monitored quantum dynamics1\u201311. These nonunitary dynamics can exhibit many emergent phenomena which are inaccessible in pure unitary dynamics or in systems in equilibrium. It is by now well-known that in a generic interacting system, repeated measurements can induce a continuous phase transition from a highly entangled volume-law phase to a disentangled area-law phase1\u20137. In addition, specific types of measurements can stabilize various quantum phases, including critical phases and ordered phases8\u201312. These rapid developments significantly broaden our understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics.\nTo understand these emergent phenomena in monitored quantum dynamics, various nonunitary random circuits have been constructed. This includes hybrid random Clifford circuits and hybrid random Haar circuits. For Clifford circuits, there exists a very efficient algorithm in terms of the stabilizer formalism which allows us to simulate nonunitary dynamics for very large system sizes3\u20135,13. On the other hand, Haar circuits provide an important analytical approach which can map many quantum dynamics problems to statistical mechanics models1,6,7.\nRecently, a new type of circuit called hybrid quantum automaton (QA) circuit was constructed to investigate the entanglement dynamics in the monitored quantum systems14. This circuit is composed of QA unitaries and local composite measurements. The detail of these two types of gates will be explained later in the paper. Compared with random Haar/Clifford circuits, QA circuits not only provide an efficient method for large-scale numerical simulation, but also provide an analytical tool to understand the quantum dynamics. Due to the basispreserving feature of QA circuits, the entanglement dynamics can be interpreted in terms of a classical bit-string picture. Specifically, the second Re\u0301nyi entropy can be mapped to the first-passage problem in the bit-string dy-\nnamics. Based on this mapping, it was further shown that the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition in a generic hybrid QA circuit belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class14. At the critical point, the prefactor of the logarithmic entanglement is related to the local persistent exponent in the DP universality class. By further imposing symmetries in the dynamics, new critical points or critical phases belonging to different universality classes can also be identified12.\nAside from the entanglement phase transition at the critical point, the volume-law phase itself also has an interesting entanglement structure. Previous studies for one-dimensional (1d) random Haar circuits suggested that the entanglement entropy can be mapped to the free energy of the directed polymer in a random environment (DPRE) which has fluctuation belonging to the KardarParisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class1,15\u201317. Such fluctuations lead to a subleading correction term scaling as L1/3 in the entanglement entropy in the volume-law phase, with L being the system size. This has also been numerically verified for 1d random Clifford circuits18,19. Interestingly, it is found in 1d random Haar circuits coupled with dephasing channels on the boundary that the entanglement negativity in the steady state has a leading L1/3 power-law scaling for 0 < p < pc\n20. Inspired by the above works, in this paper we will study the entanglement properties of the weakly monitored volume-law phase of 1d hybrid QA circuits. In particular, we study the fluctuation of the entanglement entropy and the quantum error correction property of the volume-law phase. We numerically show that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in both the early time dynamics and the steady state in the hybrid Clifford QA circuit also exhibit sample-tosample fluctuations with the same scaling behavior. In order to understand this behavior, we construct a classical two-species particle model based on the bit-string picture in which the particles undergo stochastic random dynamics. However, the classical quantity in the twospecies particle model which corresponds to the second\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n02 16\n5v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 8\nJa n\n20 23\n2 Re\u0301nyi entropy in the QA circuit is only numerically simulable for the early time dynamics which exhibits t1/3 fluctuation in the time direction in the weakly monitored phase. To solve this issue, we propose two approximations, namely, the single-species and the approximated two-species particle model, to estimate the fluctuations more efficiently.\nIn addition, we study the purification dynamics of a maximally-mixed initial state in the volume-law phase of hybrid QA circuits5. We modify the aforementioned particle model slightly and use this to give an interpretation of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in the presence of the environment. Previously, it was shown that for purification dynamics, the hybrid quantum circuit can dynamically generate a quantum error correcting code (QECC)5,21,22. The contiguous code distance of the QECC, defined as the minimum length of a contiguous subsystem that supports an uncorrectable error, was quantitatively investigated in the random Clifford circuit and found to exhibit a power-law scaling L\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2248 13 19. We analyze the quantum error-correcting property of the hybrid QA circuit and explain it in terms of the particle model. In particular, it has two types of contiguous code distance for different errors occurring in the quantum system. We show that both of them have a similar power-law scaling with the exponent close to 1 3 . In addition, we show that both the sublinear powerlaw exponent in the code distance and the fluctuation exponent in the entanglement entropy are the results of hybrid random dynamics.\nInterestingly, the stochastic classical particle model itself has an error correction property, and can dynamically generate a classical linear code (CLC). We study this random CLC by analyzing the dynamics of the associated generator matrix and numerically compute its contiguous code distance."

            "text": "Ref. 14 establishes the relationship between the entanglement dynamics and the classical bit-string dynamics in the hybrid QA circuit. The subsequent work of Ref. 12 explicitly constructs a classical two-species particle model to describe the entanglement dynamics of the Z2-symmetric hybrid QA circuit. In this section, we briefly review some of the important results in these two papers and modify the two-species particle model so that it can be applied on hybrid QA circuits without any symmetry.\nThe hybrid QA circuit is composed of QA unitary operators and composite measurements. A QA unitary gate permutes product states in the computational basis up to a phase, i.e.,\nU |n\u3009 = ei\u03b8n |\u03c0(n)\u3009, (1)\nwhere \u03c0 \u2208 S2L is an element of the permutation group on\nthe computational basis of a lattice with L qubits. We choose the Pauli Z basis as the computational basis and take the initial state to be a product state polarized in x direction, |\u03c80\u3009 = | + x\u3009\u2297L. QA unitaries scramble the phase information stored in the wave function and hence increase the entanglement of the state until it saturates to the volume-law scaling. Meanwhile, the wave function remains an equal-weight superposition of computational basis states, which is the characteristic of QA circuits.\nOn the other hand, local measurements can suppress the growth of entanglement. In the QA circuit, the composite measurement of the i-th qubit is defined as a projection operator followed by a Hadamard gate,\nM\u03c3i = Hi \u25e6 P\u03c3i , (2)\nwhere P\u03c3i = 1\u00b1Zi\n2 is the Pauli Z measurement on site i with the outcome \u03c3 = {0, 1} and Hi rotates the state back to an equal-weight superposition over the computational basis. Therefore, after imposing M\u03c3i , the phase information for half of the basis states is lost. The composite measurements disentangle the system while preserving the special feature of QA circuits.\nIt is shown in Ref. 14 that by increasing the measurement rate p, the one-dimensional hybrid QA circuit undergoes an entanglement phase transition from a volumelaw entangled phase to an area-law disentangled phase, with the phase transition belonging to the 1+1d directed percolation (DP) universality class. If we bipartition the system into subsystem A and its complement B, a common quantity to measure the entanglement between them is the nth Re\u0301nyi entropy:\nS (n) A =\n1\n1\u2212 n log2 [Tr(\u03c1 n A)]\n\u03c1A = TrB |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8|. (3)\nIn this paper, we focus on the second Re\u0301nyi entropy with n = 2, whose purity equals the expectation value of the SWAPA operator over two copies of the state 23,24,\nTr[\u03c12A(t)] = \u3008\u03c8t|2 \u2297 \u3008\u03c8t|1SWAPA|\u03c8t\u30091 \u2297 |\u03c8t\u30092, (4)\nwith the wave function |\u03c8t\u3009 = U\u0303t|\u03c80\u3009, where U\u0303t denotes the circuit evolution up until time t (For more details, see Appendix A). The SWAPA operator exchanges the spin configurations within subsystem A of |\u03c8t\u30091 and |\u03c8t\u30092.\nThe entanglement dynamics of the hybrid QA circuit can be interpreted in terms of classical bit-string dynamics. By inserting two sets of complete basis which we call \u201cbit strings\u201d on the right side of the SWAPA operator in Eq. 4 and applying the circuit on the bit-strings in a time-reversed order, we obtain\nTr[\u03c12A(t)] = \u2211 n1,n2 \u3008\u03c8t|2\u3008\u03c8t|1SWAPA|n1\u3009|n2\u3009\u3008n2|\u3008n1|\u03c8t\u30091|\u03c8t\u30092\n= 1\n4L \u2211 n1,n2 e \u2212i\u0398n\u20321 (t)e \u2212i\u0398n\u20322 (t)ei\u0398n1 (t)ei\u0398n2 (t),\n(5)\n3 X particle Y particle\nA\nyx\nB\nFigure 1. A cartoon of the two-species particle model. The black dots represent X particles, and the red dots represent Y particles. Initially, X and Y particles are distributed in region A and B respectively. We use x and y to denote the leftmost X particle and the rightmost Y particle.\nwhere\nei\u0398ni (t) = \u221a 2L\u3008ni|U\u0303t|\u03c80\u3009, (6)\nand\n|n\u20321\u3009|n\u20322\u3009 \u2261 SWAPA|n1\u3009|n2\u3009 = SWAPA|\u03b11\u03b21\u3009|\u03b12\u03b22\u3009 = |\u03b12\u03b21\u3009|\u03b11\u03b22\u3009,\n(7)\nwhere |\u03b1i\u3009 and |\u03b2i\u3009 are the spin configurations in subsystems A and B of |ni\u3009. In order to compute Tr(\u03c12A), we need to understand the dynamics of the relative phase \u0398r = \u2212\u0398n\u20321 \u2212 \u0398n\u20322 + \u0398n1 + \u0398n2 for each bit-string pair{|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009}. Under QA evolution, nonzero randomly distributed \u0398r will lead to destructive interference, and as such only configurations with trivial relative phase contribute to the purity. This observation motivates us to construct a two-species particle model12.\nThe particles here characterize the difference between a bit-string pair {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009},\nh(x, t) = |n1(x, t)\u2212 n2(x, t)|. (8)\nWe use the empty site symbol \u25e6 to denote h(x) = 0 and the occupied site symbol \u2022 to denote h(x) = 1. Specifically, we represent the difference at t = 0 in A (B) by X (Y ) particles, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Under the time evolution, these two species start to expand according to the update rule determined by the circuit. For the rest of the paper, we focus on QA unitary gates U which are linear with respect to the bit-string addition defined in finite field F2, so that for any bit string pair n1 and n2, U(|n1\u3009 + |n2\u3009) = U |n1 + n2\u3009. This means that we can directly work on the particle representation h(x, t) without keeping track of the bit-string dynamics. One good example is the two-qubit CNOT gate. When the first qubit acts as the control, we have \u2022\u25e6 \u2194 \u2022\u2022. On the other hand, the composite measurement forces the spins on the same site to be identical, which results in particle annihilation, \u2022 \u2192 \u25e6. As shown in Appendix A, only the configurations in which the X and Y particles do not meet up to time t yield \u0398r(t) = 0 and hence contribute\nto the purity. Therefore, we have\nTr\u03c12A(t) = N(t)\n2L \u2261 P (t),\nS (2) A (t) = \u2212 log2 P (t),\n(9)\nwhere N(t) is the number of configurations in which the two species do not meet up to time t. At the critical point p = pc, the fraction P (t) decays algebraically as P (t) \u221d t\u2212\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the persistence exponent. For the DP universality class, \u03b1 = 0.938 is a universal number14. This power-law decay is responsible for the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy at criticality."

            "text": "We now take a closer look at the entanglement entropy in the volume-law phase with p < pc. Previous studies of these 1 + 1d hybrid circuits indicate that randomness induces strong fluctuations in the entanglement entropy in both spatial and temporal directions. A nice way to understand this problem is through the minimal cut picture introduced in Ref. 15, which maps the entanglement dynamics to the first passage problem on a percolation lattice. Such a picture rigorously describes the zeroth Re\u0301nyi entropy S (0) A of the Haar random circuit subject to projective measurements. For the entropy with higher Re\u0301nyi index, it is argued that it can be treated as the free energy of the domain wall in a disordered magnet18,25. Notice that in both approaches, the entanglement entropy is mapped to the free energy of the 1 + 1d directed polymer in a random environment (DPRE), whose fluctuation belongs to the KPZ universality class. As a result, there exists a sub-leading correction term in the ensemble averaged entanglement entropy in both the early time dynamics and the steady states, i.e.,\n\u3008SA(t)\u3009 = \u03bb1t+ at\u03b2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (10) \u3008SA(LA)\u3009 = \u03bb2LA + bL\u03b2A + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (11)\nwhere the brackets represent an ensemble average and \u03b2 = 13 is the \u201croughness exponent\u201d of the DPRE\n16.

According to the Gottesman-Knill theorem13,26, the Clifford circuit can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer using the stabilizer formalism.

We denote x (y) as the rightmost X (leftmost Y ) particle. In the volume-law phase, x and y move toward each other at roughly the same speed, so P (t) decays exponentially in t, leading to the linear growth of S (2) A (t). The sublead-\ning term in S (2) A (t) is caused by the fluctuation of the velocities of x and y in different particle configurations. For simplicity, we fix the position of y to be next to the boundary between A and B, so that only the fluctuation of x is considered. This is equivalent as computing a subset of phase terms in Eq.(5) restricted in subsystem B,\n1\n4LA \u2211 \u03b11,\u03b12 e \u2212i\u0398B n\u20321 +i\u0398Bn1 . (14)\nwhere {\u03b11, \u03b12} are the spin configurations in subsystem A of the bit-string pairs {|n1\u3009, |n\u20321\u3009}. With this approximation, P (t) is simplified to be K(t), the fraction of configurations in which x never crosses the boundary between A and B up to time t.\nOne important advantage of taking the single-species approximation is that K(t) can be efficiently computed using the following approach. (1) All of the particle configurations in subsystem A can be generated by a set of binary basis H0 = {h1, . . . , hLA}. Hence, any particle configuration can be expressed as the linear combination\nh = LA\u2211 i=1 h\u03b1ii (15)\ndefined on the finite field F2 with \u03b1i = {0, 1}. Initially, we can set hi(t = 0) = (0 . . . 1i . . . 0). Under linear operators, we can evolve each basis separately and the above equation still holds with {\u03b1i} remaining invariant. (2) K(t) can be evaluated by simply evolving a set of basis H(t) which span the ensemble of particle configurations which never enter B. Initially, H(t = 0) = H0 and therefore K(t = 0) = 1. Under the time evolution, if the rightmost particle x of a single basis state, say, hj(t), crosses the boundary, then only the particle configurations with \u03b1j = 0 will contribute to K(t). Hence, half of the configurations are ruled out, and the \u201centanglement entropy\u201d \u2212 log2K(t) increases by one. This also means that hj is excluded from H(t) for further computation. On the other hand, if the x particles of multiple basis states, say, G = {h1, . . . , hn}, cross the boundary at the same time, one can easily verify that \u2212 log2K(t) still increases by one, except that the updated basis set becomes H(t) = {h1 + h2, . . . , h1 + hn} \u22c3 H(t \u2212 1) \\ G. As a result,\n\u2212 log2K(t) = LA \u2212 |H(t)|, (16)\nwhere |H(t)| is the number of existing basis at time t. This way of tracing the basis set which span the configurations whose boundary has not been visited by the particles resembles the stabilizer formalism in Clifford dynamics.\nWe use the above method to first study the p = 0 limit of the single-species particle model under the Clifford QA circuit defined in Fig. 2(b). With this limit, the particle basis states evolve under only unitary operators,\n6 i.e., random CNOT gates.

In the steady state, the particles in all the basis states will pass the boundary and therefore \u2212 log2K(t\u2192\u221e) = LA without subleading correction.\nWhen 0 < p < pc, we observe similar fluctuations in the early time dynamics. Fig. 4(a) shows that \u03b4[\u2212 log2K(t)] \u221d t0.294 at p = 0.04 and \u03b4[\u2212 log2K(t)] \u221d t0.26 at p = 0.08. The power law exponent slightly decreases as we increase p. As opposed to the p = 0 case, the steady state entropy cannot reach the maximal value. Due to the local measurement which forces \u2022 \u2192 \u25e6 in all the basis states at the same location, the time-evolved basis states in H(t) cease to remain mutually linearly independent. The steady state basis vectors H(t\u2192\u221e) are formed by zero vectors containing no particles. The fluctuation of the number of such zero vectors is the same as the fluctuation of \u2212 log2K(t\u2192\u221e) and is shown in Fig. 4(b). By performing finite size scaling, we observe that \u03b4[\u2212 log2K(LA)] \u221d L0.245A for both p = 0.04 and p = 0.08, slightly off from 1/3."

            "text": "In the two-species particle model, it is unclear if there exists an efficient algorithm to evaluate P (t). The existence of two moving fronts makes the problem difficult to solve. Nevertheless, we can still simulate the early time dynamics using Monte Carlo sampling method14. More specifically, we prepare a large sample of randomly generated particle configurations and estimate P (t) by computing the fraction of configurations in which X and Y never meet up to time t. This method works well for subsystem with entanglement entropy smaller than \u223c 20. Around pc, the entanglement entropy is small and this sampling method has been successfully used to identify pc and compute the critical exponents precisely over a few hundred qubits12. However, deep in the volume-law phase, evaluating the sample fluctuation of \u2212 log2 P (t) is difficult since P (t) soon becomes exponentially small and avoiding the contact between the two species turns into a rare event. Even though we prepare O(107) number of particle configurations for each sample, the numerical P (t) decays to zero in a short time. Similarly, it is even more unrealistic for us to evaluate \u03b4[\u2212 log2 P (LA)] in the steady state.\nWe apply the sampling method to the volume-law phase during the early time and as shown in Fig. 5(a), the standard deviation of the entropy \u03b4[\u2212 log2 P (t)] \u221d t0.34 at p = 0.08, which is consistent with the KPZ fluctuation, and t0.387 at p = 0.04, which is already slightly off from \u03b2 = 13 . For the steady state, we analyze the physics of P below and take some approximation to estimate the fluctuation of \u2212 log2 P .\nIn the context of particle dynamics, the entanglement entropy saturates when all the particle configurations which contribute to P (t) have at most one species left.\n100 101 102\nt\n10\u22121\n100\n\u03b4[ \u2212\nlo g\n2 P\n(t )]\nL = 256\nt1/3 \u03b4(\u2212 log2 P ), p = 0.04 \u03b4(\u2212 log2 P ), p = 0.08\n(a)\n102 103\nLA\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\u03b4[ \u2212\nlo g\n2 M\n(L A\n)]\nL0.266A L0.266A \u03b4(\u2212 log2M), p = 0.04 \u03b4(\u2212 log2M), p = 0.08\n(b)\nFigure 5. (a) The early time \u03b4(\u2212 log2 P ) vs t plotted on a loglog scale. The numerical data are calculated from the twospecies particle model with the sampling method and with the system size L = 256. We find that \u03b4[\u2212 log2 P (t)] \u221d t0.387 at p = 0.04 and t0.34 at p = 0.08. (b) The steady state \u03b4(\u2212 log2M) vs LA plotted on a log-log scale, the ratio LA/L is fixed to be 1/2. M is one of the terms that contribute to P which can be computed using the basis-decomposing method.\nThe steady state P is therefore composed of three parts,\nP = NX 2L + NY 2L \u2212 NXY 2L = PX + PY \u2212 PXY , (17)\nwhere PX (PY ) denotes the fraction in which X (Y ) particles annihilate first under the dynamics before they could encounter the other species, PXY denotes the fraction in which both species extinguish at the same time before they meet. In the volume-law phase, PX \u221d exp(\u2212LA), PY \u221d exp(\u2212LB) and PXY \u221d exp(\u2212L). In the thermodynamic limit, the last term can be ignored and the first two terms compete as we tune LA. When LA < LB , PX dominates and we have P \u2248 PX . In contrast, when LA > LB , we have P \u2248 PY . This leads\n7 p = 0 p = 0.04 p = 0.08\n\u03b4SA \u03b21 N/A 0.322 0.31\n\u03b22 0.307 0.307 0.266\n\u03b4(\u2212 log2K) \u03b21 N/A 0.245 0.245\n\u03b22 0.304 0.294 0.26\n\u03b4(\u2212 log2 P ) \u03b22 N/A 0.34 0.387 \u03b4(\u2212 log2M) \u03b21 N/A 0.266 0.266\nComputing PX is still not an easy task. Instead we consider a subset of PX that can be simulated efficiently using the basis-decomposing method in Sec. 3.2. We define the binary basis H0X (H 0 Y ) which span the X (Y ) particle configurations in the absence of Y (X) particles. Both H0X and H 0 Y evolve under the same dynamics. At time t, we consider the configurations in which the X particles never encounter Y particles in any of the basis states of H0Y (t) and denote this fraction as M(t). In other words, M(t) is equivalent to K(t) in the singlespecies particle model, except that now the boundary determined by the leftmost Y particle in H0Y (t) is spreading to the left. Therefore,\n\u2212 log2M(t) = \u2212 log2 2|HX(t)| \u00d7 2LB\n2L = LA \u2212 |HX(t)|.\n(19) where HX(t) is the basis of X particle configurations which never meet the leftmost Y particle in H0Y (t).\nIn the steady state, HX is the set of basis in which the X particles have already vanished before encountering any Y particles in H0Y (t). As shown in Fig. 5(b), there exists sample fluctuation in \u2212 log2M in the volume-law phase. In particular, we find that \u03b4[\u2212 log2M ] \u221d L0.266A for both p = 0.04 and p = 0.08. This exponent is smaller than the one computed in the Clifford QA circuit. The exponents for different models at various p < pc are listed in Table. 1 and we find that some of them are smaller than 1/3.\nCurrently, it is unclear if this is a finite size effect, or if the fluctuations of these quantities in the one/two-species particle models belong to other universality classes. The main obstacle of this issue is the lack of rigorous analytical results. However, we want to mention that there are some known results about KPZ fluctuations in the par-\nticle dynamics. Under the hybrid QA circuit, each particle configuration experiences the same circuit dynamics, therefore the end points of the two species x and y can be treated as particles performing biased random walks in a fixed time-dependent random environment. Mathematically, the dynamics of the endpoint is known as random walk in random environment (RWRE), in which the logarithm of the transition probability is proven to exhibit KPZ fluctuations in some limit27\u201329. Indeed, this quantity is similar to the second Re\u0301nyi entropy and the detailed discussion about this connection can be found in Appendix C."

            "text": "An alternative approach to understand the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition is through purification dynamics5. The basic idea is to prepare a system Q with an extensive entropy and evolve it under the hybrid quantum dynamics. Although the system will eventually be purified, in the weakly monitored volume-law phase with 0 < p < pc, the purification time is exponentially long in system size L. On the other hand, when p > pc, the entropy decays exponentially in time with a constant rate.\nThe existence of long purification time in the regime 0 < p < pc suggests that the hybrid quantum circuits can dynamically generate a robust quantum error correcting code (QECC) at polynomial time5. The QECC can be compactly denoted as [L, k, d]. Here L is the number of physical qubits in Q and k characterizes the amount of logical information encoded in the code space and is quantified by the entropy of \u03c1Q. The third index d is the code distance, which is defined as the minimum weight of all uncorrectable errors. Here the errors can be interpreted as measurements which can potentially reduce the entropy when applied on \u03c1Q. If an error changes the entropy of Q, then it is an uncorrectable error since it damages the encoded quantum information and hence can not be recovered. Due to the locality of the circuit model, a better measure is the contiguous code distance dcont, which is the minimal length of a contiguous section of qubits that supports an uncorrectable error5. In the volume-law phase, dcont diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The quantum information is stored non-locally under the unitary evolution and thus is protected against any local measurements. On the other hand, for p > pc, the unitary dynamics fails to protect the encoded information under frequent measurements. Previous works have quantitatively analyzed the statistical property of QECC in hybrid random Clifford circuits18,19. In this section, we will study the purification dynamics of the hybrid QA circuit and investigate the QECC in terms of the classical particle model.\n8 System Q\nReservoir R (a)\nCZ gate CNOT gate\nZ measurement Hadamard gate\n(b)\nInitially, we prepare a product state of 2L qubits polarized in +x direction which can be evenly divided into system Q and environment R. Then, we create L EPR pairs between them by applying CZ gates as shown in Fig. 6(a). Thus, the system Q becomes maximally entangled with environment R, i.e., S (2) Q = L. To investigate the purification dynamics, a hybrid QA circuit is solely applied on system Q. Numerically, we consider the model described in Fig. 6(c), identical to the hybrid QA Clifford circuit in the entanglement dynamics in the last section. The composite measurements disentangle the qubits in Q from the environment R. Meanwhile, the unitary evolution scramble the quantum information within system Q, increasing the entanglement between any subsystem A in Q and its complement B := Q \\ A, but not affecting S\n(2) Q .

All of the data are computed with PBC.\ntime of S (2) Q at p = pc \u2248 0.13814, consistent with the entanglement dynamics studied in the last section. As we discussed before, an important measure of the error-correcting ability of our QECC is the contiguous code distance dcont, which is the minimal length of a contiguous region supporting an uncorrectable error. It is thus natural to mark the existence of such errors supported on a contiguous subregion A using the mutual information between A and the environment R19,30,31,\nIA,R = S (2) A + S (2) R \u2212 S (2) A,R\n= S (2) A + S (2) Q \u2212 S (2) B .\n(20)\nWhen IA,R = 0, A and R are completely decoupled, we cannot acquire any information encoded in the state by\n9 observing any qubits within the subregion A. In other words, any measurements acting within A are correctable errors since they will not affect S (2) Q . Therefore, dcont is the maximum length L\u2217A such that IA,R = 0 for LA < L\u2217A\n32. We simulate the Clifford QA circuit to find the entan-\nglement entropies S (2) A and S (2) B and the mutual information IA,R over various subsystem sizes LA. The numerical results are given in Fig. 7. We take the code distance to be the maximum length L\u2217A such that \u3008IA,R\u3009 \u2264 for LA < L \u2217 A. In the numerical simulation of the finite system size, we set = 1. Remarkably, we find that S (2) A starts to decrease at LA = L \u2212 L\u2217A until it reaches S (2) Q at LA = L. This non-monotonic behavior coincides with that in the previous study of the hybrid Clifford circuits19 and is crucial in understanding the code distance. We will modify the two-species particle model in the following section so as to give an interpretation for S (2) A . As shown in Fig. 7(b), dcont has a sublinear power law scaling with L. Numerically, it scales as L0.343 for p = 0.04 and L0.387 for p = 0.08, and its value increases as the measurement rate increases."

            "heading": "4.2. QECC in classical particle language",
            "text": "To understand the dynamically generated QECC from the perspective of classical particle dynamics, we need to compute the mutual information defined in Eq. (20) in terms of the two-species particle model. An important task is to understand the entanglement entropy of a subsystem A in the presence of environment R. For the bit-string dynamics in the purification process, the hybrid QA circuit is applied only on system Q of the bitstrings in a time-reversed order, generating the relative phase \u0398r, followed by the CZ gates acting on both the systemQ and environment R, generating another relative phase \u2206r. Therefore, only the configurations satisfying \u0398r = 0 and \u2206r = 0 contribute to the purity. As shown in Appendix E, in the particle picture, this corresponds to the configurations in which all of the X particles have vanished before they can encounter any Y particles at time t. These configurations are a subset of N(t) defined in Eq.(9) in the entanglement dynamics. Let the number of these configurations be N1(t), the entanglement entropy of A is then\nS (2) A (t) = \u2212 log2\nN1(t)\n2L \u2261 \u2212 log2 P1(t). (21)\nSpecifically, when A = Q, there are only one type of particles, we only need to count the configurations whose particles extinguish at time t. Letting the number of such configurations be denoted NQ, we have\nS (2) Q (t) = \u2212 log2\nNQ(t)\n2L \u2261 \u2212 log2 PQ(t). (22)\nInitially, PQ(t = 0) = 1/2 L andQ is maximally entangled with R. Under the hybrid QA circuit, more and more\nconfigurations become empty and SQ decreases monotonically with time. The time scale for which the particles of all the configurations vanish depends on p and is consistent with that of the purification transition.\nWe are interested in the QECC generated at polynomial time t = \u03bbL with \u03bb 1. At this time, X or Y particles have already spread over the entire system and therefore the configurations that contribute to P1(t) can have at most one type of particle. Similar to the steady state P of the entanglement dynamics derived in Eq.(17), P1(t) can be expressed as\nP1(t) = N\u0303X(t) 2L + N\u0303Y (t) 2L \u2261 PX + P\u0303Y (t), (23)\nwhere P\u0303Y (t) is a subset of PY , which further requires that X particles vanish at time t. There is also a small contribution from PXY which we ignore here.\nWhen LA < LB , since PX > PY > P\u0303Y (t), PX dominates and we have P1(t) \u2248 PX . Therefore, S(2)A (t) is the same as the steady state S\n(2) A in the entanglement dynam-\nics. The regime LA > LB is different from that of the steady state in the entanglement dynamics. Since P\u0303Y (t) is a small fraction of PY , when LA is slightly larger than LB , PX > P\u0303Y (t) and we still have S (2) A \u2248 \u2212 log2 PX . We define Lc to be the threshold of the subsystem size LA where PX = P\u0303Y (t). When LA > L c, P\u0303Y (t) dominates and we have S (2) A (t) \u2248 \u2212 log2 P\u0303Y (t). For P\u0303Y (t), it can be understood as follows,\nP\u0303Y (t) = N\u0303Y (t) 2L = NY 2L N\u0303Y (t) NY \u2261 PY P2(t), (24)\nwhere P2(t) \u2261 N\u0303Y (t)/NY . Since the X particles of configurations in NY have already spread over the entire system when all of the Y particles extinguish, P2(t) actually counts the fraction of configurations which have no particles at time t. Directly evaluating P2(t) is difficult. However, due to the scrambling property of the unitaries, it is reasonable to assume that P2(t) \u2248 PQ(t),\nP\u0303Y (t) \u2248 PY PQ(t). (25)\nSummarizing, we have\nS (2) A (t) \u2248 { \u2212 log2 PX , LA < Lc \u2212 log2 PY \u2212 log2 PQ(t), LA > Lc. (26)\nWe numerically verify the above approximation in Fig. 8(a). Due to the difficulty for simulating highlyentangled state, we are only able to simulate the twospecies particle model on a system with size L = 32 at T = 3L in the volume-law phase. We find that there indeed exists a non-monotonic decay area for S (2) A = \u2212 log2 P1 when LA passes the threshold Lc, and that Eq.(26) holds within a small difference = O(1). The non-monotonicity comes from the competition of the\n10\ntwo terms PX and P\u0303Y . As subsystem A enlarges, PY increases and PQ stays the same. As a result, when LA > L c and P\u0303Y dominates, S (2) A starts to decline as LA continues to increase. The location of the peak L c depends on time and can eventually shift to L/2 when the system is completely purified.\nBased on the above analysis of S (2) A (t), we are now ready to understand the QECC in terms of particle dynamics. In the regime with LA \u2208 [0, L \u2212 Lc) and hence\nLB \u2208 (Lc, L], the mutual information becomes\nIA,R = S (2) A + S (2) Q \u2212 S (2) B\n\u2248 \u2212 log2 PX \u2212 log2 PQ + log2 PX + log2 PQ = 0. (27)\nIt vanishes because the two terms in S (2) B completely cancel with S (2) A and S (2) Q , similar to the decoupling domain wall picture discussed in Ref. 19. On the other hand, when Lc > LA > L\u2212 Lc, it is easy to show that\nIA,R \u2248 \u2212 log2 PX \u2212 log2 PQ + log2 PY > 0. (28)\nWe arrive at the conclusion that IA,R = 0 if and only if LA < L\u2212Lc and the contiguous code distance is dcont = L \u2212 Lc. These results are consistent with the numerical results of hybrid Clifford QA circuit in Fig. 7(a).\nThe code distance specified by the mutual information works for all kinds of errors. In the QA circuit, we could consider a special type of error which is the Z error defined as the measurement operator (1 \u00b1 O)/2 where O is a Pauli Z string. Suppose at time t, a QECC is prepared through the QA purification dynamics and some Z errors occur within a contiguous subsystem A, which could possibly reduce the entropy of \u03c1Q. We define the Z-error contiguous code distance dZcont as the maximum length of subsystem A such that S (2) Q does not change.\nSince the particle dynamics is evolved in a timereversed order, the Z error acts as annihilation on all of the particle configurations at t = 0. For subsystem A of size smaller than dZcont, S (2) Q is invariant under any Z error occurred within A, or in other words, with any initial particle distribution in A. Therefore, we start from an ensemble of particle configurations with empty subsystem A, so that the information about A is completely removed. The entanglement entropy of Q after the Z error becomes\nS (2) Q (t) = \u2212 log2 PB(t), (29)\nwhere PB(t) denotes that among all the configurations with only Y particles located in B initially, the fraction that becomes completely empty at time t. Consequently, dZcont is the maximum length of subsystem A such that \u2212 log2 PB(t) = \u2212 log2 PQ(t) for LA < dZcont.\nBoth \u2212 log2 PB(t) and \u2212 log2 PQ(t) can be efficiently calculated by evaluating the number of independent basis under the hybrid time evolution. We prepare two sets of binary basis, one is H whose rows are the basis spanning all the particle configurations in system Q, the other one is H \u2032 which is obtained by replacing a contiguous submatrix of size L \u00d7 LA from H with 0\u2019s. Then, we evolve them under the same circuit dynamics. One can easily see that \u2212 log2 PQ(t) = rank2(H(t)) and \u2212 log2 PB(t) = rank2(H \u2032(t)), which are the number of independent basis in H(t) and H \u2032(t) respectively. The code distance dZcont(t) is therefore identified as the largest LA such that the rank of H(t) and H \u2032(t) agree within = 1.\n11\nAs shown in Fig. 8(b), although dZcont is much larger than dcont, they have similar power-law scaling.\nThe sublinear power-law exponent in the contiguous code distance is a special feature of the hybrid random dynamics and is closely related to the subleading correction term in the entanglement entropy. In the Clifford circuit, this can be easily understood in the dynamics of the stabilizer generators, in which there exist a finite number of \u201cshort\u201d stabilizers caused by local measurements4. These short stabilizers are responsible for both the fluctuation in the entanglement entropy and also the sublinear power-law exponent in the code distance19. Under\npure unitary dynamics, these short stabilizers become long stabilizers and span over the whole system, the subleading correction term vanishes and the code distance becomes extensive and is proportional to L, the same as the conventional random QECC33.\nThe above physics can also be understood in the hybrid QA circuit as shown in Fig. 9(a). Compared with Fig. 6(c), we add an extra pure unitary evolution for time T2. Recall that the particle representation experiences the circuit dynamics in a time-reversed order, it first evolves under the pure unitary evolution for T2 and then the hybrid dynamics for T1. Here we take sufficiently long T2 for unitary evolution so that the particles are fully scrambled and only the configurations with no X (Y ) particles at the beginning can contribute to PX (PY ). Hence, PX = 2 \u2212LA and PY = 2LA\u2212L and we have\nS (2) A (t) =\n{ LA, LA < L c\nL\u2212 LA \u2212 log2 P2(t), LA > Lc. (30)\nHere \u2212 log2 P2(t) is simply counting the number of independent basis initially defined in A.\nTo verify this result, we simulate the Clifford QA circuit and compare the results with that derived from the particle model. As shown in Fig. 9(b), we find that S (2) A agrees with LA for LA < L c and L\u2212 LA \u2212 log2 P2(t) for LA > L c with negligible fluctuation. Different from the previous circuit defined in Fig. 6(c), it is easy to numerically evaluate P2(t) in this circuit. Due to the scrambling property of the unitary evolution in T2, we find that over a large range of LA, \u2212 log2 P2(t) = \u2212 log2 PQ(t) and they become different only when LA < \u2212 log2 PQ(t). There is no subleading correction term in S\n(2) A anymore and the\ncode distance is L\u2212 Lc which is linearly proportional to L. These results indicate that the sublinear power-law scaling in both the contiguous code distance and the fluctuation of the entanglement entropy are emergent properties of the hybrid random circuit and disappear when the dynamics is fully scrambled under unitary evolution."

            "text": "The classical particle model discussed in this paper has an interesting connection with the classical error correction. For a system with L sites, the total number of the particle configurations is 2L and all of them can be generated from L independent particle string basis. Under the unitary dynamics, the number of basis is invariant, indicating that the total amount of the classical information is unchanged. On the other hand, the composite measurement forces \u2022 \u2192 \u25e6 at one site in all of the basis and can potentially reduce the number of independent basis, resulting in the loss of information.\nThe information retained in the classical particle model can be characterized by the number of independent basis k. Under the purification dynamics in Sec. 4.1, k is the same as the entropy SQ. When 0 < p < pc, it takes\n12\nexp(L) time for k(t) decreasing to zero. On the other hand, when p > pc, k(t) decreases to zero exponentially fast with a finite decay rate. The phase transition at p = pc belongs to the directed percolation universality class.\nSimilar to the dynamically generated QECC with p < pc, the associated particle dynamics also generates a classical linear code (CLC) governed by a k \u00d7 L generator matrix, whose rows are binary strings forming a basis for the k dimensional codespace. When the time t is linear in L, the encoded bit k is extensive and the information is protected by the scrambling property of the unitaries and is inaccessible by the local measurement. A CLC is typically denoted by [L, k, dc], in which L classical bits can store k bits of classical information. dc is the classical\ncode distance and is equal to the minimal number of flips mapping a codeword to another. Similar to the QECC discussed before, since we have local unitary dynamics, it is more reasonable to consider contiguous code distance dccont for our CLC.\nIn a CLC [L, k, dccont], any bit flip occurring in a subsystem with length l < dccont does not change the encoded bit k. Numerically, this motivates us to evaluate dccont in the following way as illustrated in Fig. 10(a): consider an initial generator matrix M with rank2(M) = L. We evolve all of the row vectors according to the hybrid QA circuit described in Fig. 6 (b). At any time t, the encoded bit is the number of the independent binary vectors in M(t), i.e., k = rank2(M(t)). We then remove a contiguous L \u00d7 l submatrix from M(t) and obtain a truncated M \u2032(t). The largest l which makes k \u2212 rank2(M \u2032(t)) < is dccont. In the numerical simulation, we take = 1 and we are interested in the regime t = \u03b1L with \u03b1 1. As shown in Fig. 10(b), we observe that dccont \u221d L0.331 for p = 0.04 and dccont \u221d L0.35 for p = 0.08. We also plot the Z-error QECC contiguous code distance dZcont for comparison. Although there is a slight difference in measuring these two quantities that the Z error occurs at t = 0 for the particle model due to its time-reversal evolving property, the numerics shows a resemblance between dZcont and d c cont. The diverging code distance is consistent with exponentially long purification time \u2014 the information is encoded non-locally and is resilient to any local errors."

            "text": "In this paper, we analyze entanglement entropy fluctuations in the volume-law phase of 1+1d hybrid QA circuits. We numerically show that the fluctuations belong to the KPZ universality class, just as for other random circuits studied previously. Due to the special feature of the QA circuit, we are able to map the second Re\u0301nyi entropy to a classical quantity in a particle model. We compute the fluctuations of this quantity in different approaches and show that they exhibit fluctuations with similar exponents. The existence of the strong fluctuations may have interesting connection with the multifractal behavior observed in the volume-law phase of hybrid Clifford circuits, where the entanglement entropy transition is mapped to an Anderson localization transition34. Besides this, we could also study fluctuations at the critical point in these hybrid random circuits. These critical points, dominated by randomness, are different from those clean systems. Since the hybrid QA circuit has an underlying particle picture, it could be a good starting point to explore this problem.\nWe also study the dynamically generated QECC in the purification dynamics of 1+1d hybrid QA circuits. Again, we give an interpretation of the error correction in terms of the particle model. In particular, we show that the particle model itself can be treated as a random\n13\nclassical linear code (CLC), and numerically compute the contiguous code distance for it. This observation motivates us to consider other random CLCs and use similar approaches to construct QECC. We leave this for the future study."

The two-species particle model can also be modified and applied on hybrid QA circuits without Z2 symmetry. Before introducing the particle model, we will first give an overview of the classical bit string dynamics.\nRecall that the second Re\u0301nyi entropy S (2) A = \u2212 log2 Tr(\u03c12A). The purity Tr(\u03c12A) equals the expectation value of the SWAPA operator over two copies of the state23,24,\nTr[\u03c12A(t)] = \u3008\u03c8t|2 \u2297 \u3008\u03c8t|1SWAPA|\u03c8t\u30091 \u2297 |\u03c8t\u30092.

The SWAPA operator exchanges the spin configurations |\u03b1\u3009 within subsystem A of the double copies of |\u03c8t\u3009. Then, we insert two sets of complete basis which we call \u201cbit strings\u201d14, Tr[\u03c12A(t)] = \u2211 n1,n2 \u3008\u03c8t|2\u3008\u03c8t|1SWAPA|n1\u3009|n2\u3009\u3008n2|\u3008n1|\u03c8t\u30091|\u03c8t\u30092\n= \u2211 n1,n2 \u3008\u03c80|1U\u0303\u2020t |n\u20321\u3009\u3008\u03c80|2U\u0303\u2020t |n\u20322\u3009 \u3008n1|U\u0303t|\u03c80\u30091\u3008n2|U\u0303t|\u03c80\u30092 = 1\n4L \u2211 n1,n2 e \u2212i\u0398n\u20321 (t)e \u2212i\u0398n\u20322 (t)ei\u0398n1 (t)ei\u0398n2 (t),\n(A3)\nwhere\n|n\u20321\u3009|n\u20322\u3009 = SWAPA|n1\u3009|n2\u3009 = SWAPA|\u03b11\u03b21\u3009|\u03b12\u03b22\u3009 = |\u03b12\u03b21\u3009|\u03b11\u03b22\u3009.\n(A4)\nStrictly speaking, there does not exist U\u0303\u2020t since the projective measurements are nonunitary operators. However, we can still deduce the effective action of the composite measurement on the bit string,\n\u3008n|M\u03c3i |\u03c80\u3009 = \u3008n|H \u25e6 P\u03c3i |\u03c80\u3009\n= \u3008T\u03c3i (n)|\u03c80\u3009 = 1\u221a 2L e i\u03b8T\u03c3 i (n) ,\n(A5)\nwhere \u3008T\u03c3i (n)| stands for the bit string \u3008n| with the spin on site i forced to be in the \u03c3 state. Hence, instead of following the quantum trajectory of |\u03c8t\u3009, we can study the bit string dynamics in a time-reversed order, i.e., evaluate \u3008n|U\u0303t|\u03c80\u3009 from left to right,\n\u3008n|U\u0303t|\u03c80\u3009 = \u3008n(t\u2032 = 0)|MtUtMt\u22121Ut\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c80\u3009 = \u3008n(t\u2032 = 1)|UtMt\u22121Ut\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c80\u3009 = ei\u03b8n(t\u2032=1)\u3008n(t\u2032 = 1)|Mt\u22121Ut\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c80\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n= 1\u221a 2L ei\u03b8n(t\u2032=1)ei\u03b8n(t\u2032=2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ei\u03b8n(t\u2032=t) = 1\u221a 2L ei\u0398n(t),\n(A6)\nwhere ei\u0398n(t) is one of the accumulated phase terms under time evolution that are multiplied and summed up over the ensemble of all the possible bit-string configurations {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009, |n\u20321\u3009, |n\u20322\u3009} in Eq. A3 to evaluate Tr\u03c12A.\nIn order to understand the dynamics of the relative phase \u0398r = \u2212\u0398n\u20321 \u2212 \u0398n\u20322 + \u0398n1 + \u0398n2 , we consider the evolution of the difference between a bit string pair {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009},\nh(x, t) = |n1(x, t)\u2212 n2(x, t)|. (A7)\nIt is then natural to use the particle representation where the empty site symbol \u25e6 denotes h(x) = 0 and the occupied site symbol \u2022 denotes h(x) = 1. Specifically, we represent the difference at t = 0 in subregion A (subregion B) by X (Y ) particles. It is easy to check that within the regime occupied by particles of the same species, under CNOT gate with the first qubit acting as the control, \u2022\u25e6 \u2194 \u2022\u2022, i.e., the particle gives birth to another particle of the same kind at the neighboring site or kills another if the neighbor is already occupied. On the other hand, under the composite measurement, \u2022 \u2192 \u25e6, i.e., the particle annihilates with probability p. Let x denote the position of the rightmost X particle and y denote the position of the leftmost Y particle. As shown in Fig. 11, under the time evolution, the particles start to evolve according to the update rule. Meanwhile, x and y can also be\n14\nviewed as the \u201cend particles\u201d performing biased random walks. Before the two species encounter each other, the phase generated by each layer of unitary evolution on |n\u3009 is \u03b8n = \u03b8 [1,x] n + \u03b8 (x,y) n + \u03b8 [y,L] n , i.e., the sum of phases generated within the regimes [1, x], (x, y) and [y, L]. The bit string configurations within [1, x] occupied by X particles always satisfy n1([1, x]) = n \u2032 2([1, x]) and n2([1, x]) = n\u20321([1, x]). Therefore, \u03b8 [1,x] n1 = \u03b8\n[1,x] n\u20322 and \u03b8 [1,x] n2 = \u03b8 [1,x] n\u20321 .\nSimilarly, for the regime occupied by Y particles, since n1([y, L]) = n \u2032 1([y, L]) and n2([y, L]) = n \u2032 2([y, L]), we always have \u03b8 [y,L] n1 = \u03b8\n[y,L] n\u20321 and \u03b8 [y,L] n2 = \u03b8 [y,L] n\u20322 . At the\nsame time, since there is no bit string difference within the regime (x, y), \u03b8 (x,y) n1 = \u03b8 (x,y) n2 = \u03b8\n(x,y) n\u20321 = \u03b8 (x,y) n\u20322 .\nTherefore, the phase difference along the lattice vanishes: \u2212\u03b8n\u20321 \u2212 \u03b8n\u20322 + \u03b8n1 + \u03b8n2 = 0. If for a bit string pair {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009}, X and Y particles do not meet each other up to time t, then the accumulated relative phase \u0398r(t) is zero and such pair contributes 1/4\nL to the purity Tr[\u03c12A(t)].\nOnce the rightmost X particle comes across the leftmost Y particle, the two-qubit phase gate acting on sites x and y will generate a nonzero relative phase. For example, if we apply the CZ gate on \u2022\u2022 with a possible corresponding bit string configuration {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009, |n\u20321\u3009, |n\u20322\u3009}x,y = {|10\u3009, |01\u3009, |00\u3009, |11\u3009}, a relative phase 0+0\u22120\u2212\u03c0 = \u2212\u03c0 is generated. If we apply the CNOT gate on sites x and y, {|n1\u3009, |n2\u3009, |n\u20321\u3009, |n\u20322\u3009}x,y \u2192 {|11\u3009, |01\u3009, |00\u3009, |10\u3009}, i.e., another type of \u201cparticle\u201d different from the two species with bit string configuration |n1\u3009y = |n2\u3009y 6= |n\u20321\u3009y = |n\u20322\u3009y appears on site y and will spread along the lattice under further evolution. As time evolves, the configurations for which the two species have met will generate random accumulated phases, half\nCZ gate CNN(R) gate CNN(L) gate\nZ measurement Rotation gate\n(a)\nof which are composed of odd numbers of \u03c0, while the other half are composed of even numbers of \u03c0. The accumulated phase terms ei\u0398r of such configurations will add up to zero and make no contribution to Eq. A3. Therefore, we have\nTr\u03c12A(t) \u2248 P (t), S\n(2) A (t) \u2248 \u2212 log2 P (t),\n(A8)\nwhere P (t) is the fraction of particle configurations in which X and Y particles never encounter one another up to time t. This quantum-classical correspondence has been numerically verified in Ref. 12."

Therefore, we only care about the dynamics of the end points of each particle configuration and can treat them as biased random walkers in a fixed random environment.\nBased on the above analysis, we propose a singlespecies end-point RWRE model. Initially, we place the end points of all the particle configurations on the lattice, which results in a lattice chain fully occupied in A and empty in B. We further simplify the problem by assuming that the configurations with the same end point initially share the same dynamics, so that each site can be viewed as being occupied by only one particle at t = 0. At each time step, a random value \u03c9i \u2208 (0, 1) is assigned to each site i on which the particles have the probability \u03c9i to move to the right.

Meanwhile, the latter constraint is the same as in the entanglement dynamics, i.e., the X and Y particles representing the difference |n1(x, 0)\u2212n2(x, 0)| in A and B respectively never encounter each other up to time t. To summarize, we only need to count the configurations for which X and Y particles do not meet and X particles have become extinct at time t. Let the fraction of such configurations be P1, the entanglement entropy of the subsystem A is then\nS (2) A (t) \u2248 \u2212 log2 P1(t). (E4)\n\u2217 hankq@bc.edu \u2020 chenaad@bc.edu 1 B.
