    "abstractText": "The Covid-19 pandemic has had many negative consequences on the general public mental health. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of and satisfaction with an app with gratitude exercises to improve the mental health of people with reduced mental well-being due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as potential mechanisms of well-being change and dose\u2013response relationships. A two-armed randomized controlled trial design was used, with two groups receiving the 6-week gratitude intervention app either immediately (intervention group, n = 424) or after 6 weeks (waiting list control group, n = 425). Assessments took place online at baseline (T0), six weeks later (T1) and at 12 weeks (T2), measuring outcomes (i.e., mental well-being, anxiety, depression, stress), and potential explanatory variables (i.e., gratitude, positive reframing, rumination). Linear mixed models analyses showed that when controlled for baseline measures, the intervention group scored better on all outcome measures compared to the control group at T1 (d = .24\u2013.49). These effects were maintained at T2. The control group scored equally well on all outcome measures at T2 after following the intervention. Effects of the intervention on well-being were partially explained by gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination, and finishing a greater number of modules was weakly related to better outcomes. The intervention was generally appealing, with some room for improvement. The results suggest that a mobile gratitude intervention app is a satisfactory and effective way to improve the mental health of the general population during the difficult times of a pandemic.",

            "text": "Recent literature has paid much attention to the multitude of negative consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, extending beyond getting ill. The constant threat of becoming infected combined with government-imposed restrictions has had major impact on the mental health of the general public, evident in the reduced mental well-being, and increased anxiety, depression and stress levels that have been reported (e.g., Agha, 2021; Paredes et\u00a0al., 2021). Even when life will gradually get back to normal, a certain extent of restrictions will likely remain due to breakthrough infections. Easy to use large-scale low-intensity interventions for the general population are needed to improve mental health, also beyond the pandemic (Huppert, 2004; Schotanus-Dijkstra et\u00a0 al., 2019). Positive psychological interventions, such as gratitude exercises, could help to reduce distress, maintain mental well-being, and develop psychological resources needed to cope with the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic (Serlachius et\u00a0al., 2021; Waters et\u00a0al., 2021). The current study tested whether a gratitude app provides an effective and satisfactory intervention to improve the mental health of people with reduced well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSustainable mental health can be seen as the combination of low ill-being and high well-being and the presence of the ability to adapt (Bohlmeijer & Westerhof, 2021). Indicators of mental ill-being are for example chronic stress and distress. Mental well-being, on the other hand, is a combination of feeling well: positive emotions and life satisfaction, and doing well: positive functioning of the individual and in society (Keyes, 2002). Mental well-being and ill-being are related but differentiated continua: a person without illbeing does not necessarily experience high well-being (Lamers et\u00a0al., 2011a; Westerhof & Keyes, 2010). However, well-being reduces the risk of incidence of mental ill-being (e.g., Schotanus-Dijkstra et\u00a0al., 2017) and sustainable positive mental health has shown to have a buffering effect on ill-being, a bolstering effect on continued mental health, as well as a building effect on growth during the pandemic (Waters et\u00a0al., 2021).\nGratitude may be an important resource to improve and protect mental health. Gratitude refers to the awareness of the positive aspects of life and the goodness of others (Sansone & Sansone, 2010). It can be seen as a positive emotion that one experiences when receiving benefit from someone (McCullough et\u00a0al., 2002), as a mood that lingers on for a longer period of time (McCullough et\u00a0 al., 2004), and eventually as a general dispositional tendency (Watkins et\u00a0 al., 2003; Wood et\u00a0 al., 2009). Gratitude has been linked to both improved well-being and reduced ill-being (Wood & Joseph, 2010). Various underlying mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of gratitude on mental health, such as through improving positive emotions (Lambert et\u00a0al., 2012), positive relationships (Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016), and effective coping (Wood et\u00a0al., 2007). Gratitude has shown to be positively related to coping strategies such as seeking social support, planning, and positive reframing (Lambert et\u00a0al., 2012) and negatively to rumination (Heckendorf et\u00a0al., 2019). Studies suggest that gratitude has potential to promote resources and reduce barriers for successful adaptation to difficult life-events and life-circumstances such as a pandemic (Bernabe-Valero et\u00a0 al., 2021; Bohlmeijer & Westerhof, 2021; Jans-Beken, 2021; Mead et\u00a0al., 2021).\nVarious exercises, such as gratitude journaling and writing gratitude letters, have been developed to promote gratitude (Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Emmons & Stern, 2013). Meta-analyses have shown that these gratitude interventions are effective in improving mental health, although effects are generally small to moderate, and inconsistent (Davis et\u00a0 al., 2016; Dickens, 2017). Several modifications have been proposed to improve the\n1 3\neffectiveness, such as increasing the duration of the intervention, and including multiple exercises, and it has been suggested to examine effects in people who are experiencing various levels of distress (Bohlmeijer\u00a0et al., 2022) . Furthermore, gratitude interventions could benefit from delivery in a mobile digital format (mHealth). Online and mobile app formats can have several advantages, such as availability, accessibility, flexibility, adaptability, easy scalability, cost-effectiveness, integration in daily life, and the opportunity to include persuasive elements to improve motivation and adherence (e.g., Bidargaddi et\u00a0al., 2018; Mohr et\u00a0 al., 2010; Olff, 2015; Wei et\u00a0 al., 2020). These advantages make an appbased gratitude intervention especially attractive for implementation in the general public. A handful of studies have investigated the effectiveness of such gratitude apps on body satisfaction in women (Fuller-Tyszkiewicz et\u00a0al., 2019), and on mental health in younger children (Lau et\u00a0al., 2020) and high school students (Bono et\u00a0al., 2020). One study showed that a gratitude app combined with an online gratitude training and adherence-focused guidance (human support) decreased anxiety and depression in adults with elevated levels of repetitive negative thinking, which was mediated through reduced rumination (Heckendorf et\u00a0al., 2019). Yet, more research is clearly needed on the effectiveness of self-help gratitude interventions aimed at the general public, without barriers that limit their reach such as additional guidance.\nThe aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of and satisfaction with an app with gratitude exercises to improve mental health of people with reduced well-being due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The app was based on an extensive 6-week gratitude intervention that has previously been shown effective in improving mental well-being and gratitude in people with low to moderate well-being and mild distress (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020). Besides effectiveness, the current study investigates gratitude and coping as possible mechanisms of change and examines dose\u2013response relationships and the appeal of the intervention for the general population."

The intervention group received the gratitude intervention app following T0, and the wait list control group received the app following T1 (effectively no longer serving as true control at T2). This design was chosen as we did not consider it ethically justified to offer people who are seeking support to improve their well-being in the context of a\u00a0pandemic crisis a sham or neutral intervention, and we wanted to give all participants access to the intervention as soon as possible. Participants were not blinded for allocation. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Twente (no. 201071) and was registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (trial NL8856)."

The app was specifically designed for this study. The content of the gratitude app was based on the e-mail-delivered intervention that has previously been shown effective (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020), and the design, navigation, structure, and persuasive elements of the app were based on a previous, user-based designed selfcompassion app (Austin et\u00a0 al., 2022). Six modules covered psycho-education on several aspects of gratitude in both short movie clips and in text: (1) Seeing and appreciating the positive, (2) Appreciating daily things, (3) Expressing gratitude, (4) Discovering positive consequences of adversity, (5) Awareness of impermanence, (6) Gratitude as life attitude. Each module had one evidence-based gratitude writing exercise suitable for daily repetition (see Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020). Users were advised to spend about 10\u201315\u00a0min a day on writing, 5\u00a0days a week (50\u201375\u00a0min per week). The app included several persuasive elements that can be used in web-based interventions (Kelders et\u00a0al., 2012). The homepage of the app visualised a sunflower, which was gradually colourized upon progressing through the training (self-monitoring and liking). The app included daily inspirational quotes and reminders to do the exercise and the opportunity to upload one photo a day of something one is grateful for. Users received a reward upon completing an exercise in the form of a coloured flower, and received suggestions in the form of tailored automated feedback after completing an exercise twice. The app was completed in chronological order (tunnelling), with a new module accessible upon completing a weekly exercise five times per week (rehearsal). Email-based technical support was provided for installing or log-in issues."

Participants were recruited in the general Dutch and Belgian population via various social media of the University (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook), via articles in regional and national newspaper, and radio-interviews. The recruitment message was: \u201cAre you experiencing less well-being due to the corona crisis? Could you use some positivity and resilience?\u201d. Interested people were informed about the study and could sign up via a study website. After providing informed consent, an online screening questionnaire could be completed to determine eligibility. Participants who were not eligible to participate due to exceeding anxiety and/or depressive scores (see eligibility criteria below) were informed by email to contact their physician if needed. This criterium was adopted to prevent potential participants misinterpreting the intervention as an effective alternative to seeking treatment from a mental health professional to treat their anxiety- or depressive symptoms. Eligible participants were invited to complete the baseline questionnaire online, after which they were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the waiting list control group, using randomizer.org."

However, given the exceptional situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in which we felt it our ethical responsibility to give people access to the intervention as soon as possible, we decided to open study participation to all eligible people over the course of a 2-week register period.\nInclusion criteria were: age of 18\u00a0years or older; sufficient command of the Dutch language; in possession of an email address and smartphone or tablet with sufficient internet connection; willing to do a 15-min gratitude exercise daily for 6\u00a0weeks. Exclusion criteria included the presence of severe anxiety symptoms (i.e. a score of \u2265 15 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; Spitzer et\u00a0al., 2006) and moderately severe or severe depressive symptoms (i.e. \u2265 15 on the Patient Health Questionnaire; Kroenke et\u00a0al., 2001).\nParticipants were recruited via radio items (38%), articles in (online) papers or journals (34%), or via recommendations by others (11%). Figure\u00a02 shows that a total of 1281 filled out the screening form. However, 175 participants were not eligible to participate because of anxiety or depressive symptoms above the cut-off (n = 169, 13%), or because they were not willing to do the 15-min exercises daily (n = 4). An additional of 256 participants (20%) dropped out between screening and T0 (reasons unknown).

The LMM analyses included the fixed effect of condition (intervention vs. control), T1 measures as dependent variable, and T0 measures as control variable for each outcome measure (i.e., well-being, anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress) and explanatory variables (gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination), with restricted maximum likelihood as the estimation method. The effect size of Cohen\u2019s d was calculated by dividing the T1 mean difference of the estimate marginal means of the intervention and control condition by the pooled standard deviations, with Cohen\u2019s d < 0.33 as small, 0.33\u20130.55 as moderate and > 0.55 as large effects (Lipsey & Wilson, 1993).\nSince the control group received the intervention between T1 and T2, we checked whether scores of the control group improved to the level of the intervention group, and whether the effects in the intervention group remained at T2. For this, we conducted LMM analyses on T2 between-group differences with T0 measures as control. Further, longerterm efficacy was examined by employing LMM within-subject comparisons with the intervention group only, including the fixed effect of time as repeated measure (T1 vs. T2), for each outcome measure. Completers-only analyses showed similar results and are therefore not reported.\nTo further explore whether the intervention was effective for people with various levels of distress (anxiety and depression), we conducted two sensitivity analysis using the PROCESS tool (version 4) (Hayes, 2012). Baseline anxiety and depression scores were each divided in three categories based on questionnaire guidelines, representing minimal,\n1 3\nmild, and moderate anxiety and depression (Kroenke et\u00a0al., 2001; Spitzer et\u00a0al., 2006). A simple moderation test was conducted with condition as X (1 for intervention, 0 for control group), T0-T1 change scores in well-being as Y, and the categorized baseline measure of anxiety or depression as W (moderator). A significant highest order unconditional interaction effect would lead to inspection of the conditional effects."

            "text": "Previous findings showed the importance of gratitude as a psychological resource during the Covid-19 pandemic (Bono et\u00a0al., 2020; Mead et\u00a0al., 2021; Pellerin & Raufaste, 2020). The aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of and satisfaction with a 6-week gratitude intervention in app format to improve mental health of people with reduced wellbeing in times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we investigated gratitude and coping as possible mechanisms of change, examined dose\u2013response relationships, and evaluated the appeal of the intervention.\nThe online gratitude intervention was effective in improving mental health in the general population during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the effects remained after six weeks follow-up. Well-being improvements exceeded the effects previously found in meta-analyses of gratitude interventions (Davis et\u00a0al., 2016; Dickens, 2017), which could be due to the longer duration and greater diversity of exercises in the current intervention (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020). At the same time, effects were smaller than previously found in the studies on online gratitude interventions using other formats (i.e., pdf-email format, or app combined with online training; Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020;\u00a0Heckendorf et\u00a0al., 2019). This might be explained by the absence of additional guidance in the current intervention, besides emailbased technical support. Guidance can improve effectiveness (Baumeister et\u00a0 al., 2014; Beatty & Binnion, 2016), but it simultaneously reduces the feasibility of scaling the intervention into population-wide implementation. Others have included alternative interactive aspects in their gratitude intervention that might be better scalable, such as connecting to other users to share gratitude experiences (Bono et\u00a0al., 2020), or a single physical kick-off meeting (Van \u2019t Klooster et\u00a0 al., 2017). The impact of such alternatives on effectiveness remains to be investigated.\nWe found that intervention effects on well-being were not dependent on baseline anxiety or depression. This indicates that both people with mild and moderate distress benefit from the intervention and highlights the suitability of a gratitude intervention during difficult times. Furthermore, the intervention was also effective in reducing ill-being, although effects were smaller compared to well-being. This is in line with previous studies (Cregg & Cheavens, 2021; Jans-Beken et\u00a0al., 2020), and with the idea that well-being and ill-being are related but separate concepts (Lamers et\u00a0al., 2011a; Westerhof & Keyes, 2010). It is not surprising that people continued experiencing some degree of anxiety, depressive feelings, and stress during the continued pandemic and associated regulations. However, it has been suggested that because gratitude improves well-being, this could in turn have a buffering effect on anxiety and depression (Schotanus-Dijkstra et\u00a0 al., 2017; Waters et\u00a0 al., 2021), which may take longer to surface. Such temporality of effects should be further examined with longer follow-up measurements.\nThe effects of the intervention on well-being were partly explained by improvements in gratitude and effective coping (i.e., improved positive reframing and decreased rumination). These results are in line with previous work suggesting effective coping as a potential underlying mechanism to explain the effect of gratitude on mental health (Heckendorf et\u00a0al., 2019; Lambert et\u00a0al., 2012; Wood et\u00a0al., 2007), which may be especially essential during the difficult circumstances such as a pandemic (e.g., B\u00fcssing et\u00a0 al., 2020; Jans-Beken, 2021). The findings suggest that gratitude, positive reframing, and rumination are processes of change in the effects of a gratitude intervention on mental health. However, it should be noted that our results could not establish temporal precedence (i.e., the assumption that changes in the explanatory variable occurs\n1 3\nbefore changes in the outcome; Kendall et\u00a0al., 2017), as we were limited to using only two timepoints. Furthermore, the pathways we found were only partial, leaving room for additional mechanisms at play. First, gratitude can be considered a positive emotion (McCullough et\u00a0al., 2002), and a gratitude intervention may thus have a direct effect on mental health. Second, additional processes of change are for instance positive relationships, positive emotions, and hope (Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016; Feng & Yin, 2021; Lambert et\u00a0 al., 2012), but these were not measured in the current study. Third, a recently developed model for sustainable mental health describes that barriers such as rumination and resources such as gratitude and positive reframing can improve sustained mental health through improving one\u2019s ability to adapt (Bohlmeijer & Westerhof, 2021), suggesting a serial multiple mediation. Future research should shed light on these potential mechanisms and their relative explanatory power in the effect of gratitude interventions on mental health.\nBesides showing gratitude and coping as mechanism of change, this study also revealed dose\u2013response relationships. Finishing a greater number of modules was weakly related to better outcomes. This is in line with a recent meta-analyses, which showed that longer positive psychology interventions generally have larger effects (Carr et\u00a0al., 2020), although this may not be extend to long-term effects (Koydemir et\u00a0al., 2021). Further inspection of our results showed linear trends for well-being and stress, and a less gradual trend for illbeing, with steep improvements at certain modules. These results suggest that for the current intervention, an optimal dose may be between 4 and 6 modules, depending on the outcome. This is in line with a recent study showing gratitude intervention effects were larger at 4\u00a0weeks compared to at 2\u00a0weeks (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2022), and this number of modules seems similar to a systematic review suggesting an optimal dose of 4\u20136 sessions for low intensity guided psychological self-help interventions (Robinson et\u00a0 al., 2020). However, the modules in the current intervention covered various gratitude exercises, making it impossible to disentangle the impact of simple repetition of exercises from effects of the diversity of the exercises, which may both contribute to effectiveness (Carr et\u00a0al., 2020). Finally, while drop-out rates were comparable to previous studies (e.g., Heckendorf et\u00a0al., 2019), only about a third fully adhered to the intervention goals. It is important to note that we may have been a bit too strict with our predefined intended app usage (i.e., 4 or more modules finished, spending at least 10\u00a0min per day for at least 5\u00a0days per week on the intervention). Indeed, there is a debate about what adherence measures to use, and some have suggested using number of finished modules as adherence (Gan et\u00a0al., 2021), which would mean that more participants adhered. Still, a majority of participants did not reach module 4 or higher in the current study, which signals the need to further support adherence in order to unlock the full potential effectiveness of the intervention.\nThe evaluations of the users additionally gave some first suggestions for intervention improvements, for instance by reducing the number of notifications, and changing the video\u2019s, and daily quotes. Other ways of improving adherence could be by incorporating additional persuasive elements, such as tailoring the notifications (Bidargaddi et\u00a0al., 2018), or including personalization, praise, or a social role in the intervention by means of a supportive avatar (Kelders et\u00a0 al., 2012). That said, we found that overall, this gratitude app was satisfactory for the general population with reduced well-being, specifically concerning the content, used language, amount of text, number of modules, design and usability. The number of people applying to participate greatly exceeded our targeted sample size, and the satisfaction with the app was comparable to the pdf-email format gratitude intervention (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2022), indicating the need for and suitability of such a positive\n1 3\npsychology intervention in times of a pandemic with lockdowns and restrictions (Waters et\u00a0al., 2021)."

Furthermore, we used an efficient study design, investigating both effectiveness and satisfaction, and the relatively big sample size (Dickens 2017) provided the opportunity for examining underlying mechanisms and dose\u2013response relationships. However, there are also various limitations to this study.\nFirst, we only included a waitlist\u00a0control condition, not an active control condition, so we cannot make any inference on whether the gratitude app is more effective than other well-being apps. Second, we did not examine the added effect of an online app compared to other modes of delivery, nor did we test the effects of specific app features or persuasive elements. Third, the dose\u2013response relations are based on drop-out, rather than assigned dosage, and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Especially in light of the low adherence rates, the results may be biased in the sense that the reported trends could be partially related to specific participant characteristics (e.g. having a stronger motivation for gratitude interventions) by the participants in the sample that adhered to the intervention. Further experiments are needed to unravel specific effects of delivery features and doseeffects (Koydemir et\u00a0al., 2021). Fourth, this study only provides a limited indication of the longer-term effects of the intervention. The effects in the intervention group remained after 6\u00a0weeks, but in the absence of a true control group, we cannot assert the potential effects of some of the Covid-19 measures being slowly lifted during T2 assessments (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, 2021). Still, the unambiguity of the results in both groups, and the absence of potential non-specific effects from guidance, support the effectiveness of the intervention.\nFinally, there are some limitations concerning the sample. The sample consisted solely of Dutch and Belgian participants, and of mainly highly educated women, which reduces generalizability. The education level of respondents is not surprising given the recruitment channels and text-driven intervention, and female participation rates comparable to other studies (Bendtsen et\u00a0al., 2020; Bohlmeijer & Westerhof, 2021; Schotanus-Dijkstra et\u00a0al., 2017). Gender and education level were not related to intervention drop-out, but future studies should still examine how to make gratitude interventions appealing for more men and for people with practical education levels. It should also be noted that the sample included mainly people who experienced only limited detrimental effects of COVID-19, in terms of having (in)direct contact with an infection, loss of a loved one, and its selfreported impact on well-being. We additionally excluded people with severe anxiety and with (moderately) severe depressive symptoms, all of which making results only generalizable to people who were moderately impacted by the pandemic, and with minimal to moderate distress. On the other hand, experiencing low well-being was not an exclusion criterium, but instead stressed in the recruitment message. However, since the well-being of our sample was still below the Dutch norm group, we seem to have still included the targeted population.\n1 3\nThe gratitude app that was developed for this study provides the first Dutch evidence-based (Bohlmeijer et\u00a0al., 2020) and scientifically supported way to improve wellbeing through gratitude exercises, and is currently freely available in the Netherlands. Although some literature has suggested superior effectiveness of multi-component positive psychological interventions (Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009), it has also been shown that people differ in their preferences for certain positive psychological exercises over others, which subsequently influences engagement (Schueller, 2010). Indeed, besides features of the activity, and features of the person, the specific person-activity fit has been reported to influence intervention effectiveness (Lyubormirsky & Layous, 2013; Proyer et\u00a0 al., 2015). Our gratitude app contributes to implementing a wide variety of evidence-based and tested positive psychological intervention apps, which offers people the opportunity to select exercises that fit their person to support their well-being. Future research should invest further in making such interventions also fit to groups who are currently largely overlooked, such as people with low SES (Faber et\u00a0al., 2021), for example by using co-design strategies (Austin et\u00a0al., 2022)."

            "text": "The current study shows the potential of a six-week gratitude intervention app as an appealing and effective way to improve mental health of the general population in the context of an ongoing pandemic, through improving gratitude and effective coping, and with a higher dosage related to greater effectiveness. Our intervention was presented in a relatively simple Progressive Web App format without guidance, which can be easily scaled, to provide a cost-effective easily accessible means for supporting well-being (e.g., Bidargaddi et\u00a0 al., 2018; Mohr et\u00a0 al., 2010; Olff, 2015; Wei et\u00a0 al., 2020). This is especially important when restrictions (e.g., social distancing, lockdowns) and high demand prevent other forms of support to be readily available. The applicability of gratitude exercises during other times of collective distress (such as natural disasters), and during intense experiences of personal distress (such the grief of losing a loved-one, dealing with personal illness) remains to be investigated. But for now, the current study shows that practicing gratitude using a mobile application has potential to make a significant impact on the mental health of the general population, even during the difficult times of a pandemic.\nAcknowledgements We would like to gratefully acknowledge Dr. Peter ten Klooster for his advice in analysing the data.\nAuthors\u2019 contribution All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
