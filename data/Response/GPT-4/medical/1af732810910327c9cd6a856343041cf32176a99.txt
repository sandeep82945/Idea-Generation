Extension to Other Medical Imaging Modalities: The effectiveness of the Cosine Similarity-based Image Filtering (CosSIF) algorithm, along with the FBGT and FAGT methods, has been demonstrated for dermoscopic images and skin lesion classification. Future research could explore the application and adaptation of these methods across different medical imaging modalities, such as MRI, CT scans, and X-rays, where similar challenges with low inter-class variation and class imbalances exist. This extension could potentially improve the diagnostic accuracy across a broader spectrum of medical conditions.

Integration with Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Learning Techniques: Considering the scarcity of labeled medical images in some domains, integrating CosSIF with unsupervised or semi-supervised learning techniques could be a valuable research direction. This integration would aim to leverage unlabeled data more effectively, potentially further reducing the reliance on large labeled datasets and improving the performance of models trained on limited or imbalanced datasets.

Automated Hyperparameter Optimization for FBGT and FAGT: The effectiveness of the FBGT and FAGT methods depends significantly on the selection of the hyperparameter ùú∂. Automated hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms, could be developed to determine the optimal ùú∂ value for any given dataset. This would streamline the application process of FBGT and FAGT methods and ensure the best possible performance without manual tuning.

Development of Advanced CosSIF Variants: The current implementation of CosSIF could be expanded by exploring advanced image similarity measures that go beyond cosine similarity, incorporating spatial, texture, and shape features specific to medical images. Developing advanced variants of CosSIF that can capture more nuanced differences between classes could further improve the filtering process and, subsequently, the performance of the generative models and classifiers.

Real-time Application and Clinical Integration: Exploring the integration of the proposed methods into real-time clinical decision support systems would be a critical step toward practical application. Research could focus on optimizing the computational efficiency of the FBGT and FAGT methods for real-time analysis and developing user-friendly interfaces that allow clinicians to interact with the system effectively. This would facilitate the translation of these methods from research to clinical practice, potentially improving diagnosis and treatment planning processes.
