    "abstractText": "In this work, the growth mechanism of aluminum nitride (AlN) epitaxial films by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) on silicon carbide (SiC) epitaxial layers grown on silicon (110) substrates is investigated. The peculiarity of this study is that the SiC layers used for the growth of AlN films are synthesized by the method of coordinated substitution of atoms. In this growth method, a part of the silicon atoms in the silicon substrate is replaced with carbon atoms. As a result of atom substitution, the initially smooth Si(110) surface transforms into a SiC surface covered with octahedron-shaped structures having the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets. The SiC(111)/(111) facets forming the angle of 35.3\u25e6 with the original Si(110) surface act as \u201csubstrates\u201d for further growth of semipolar AlN. The structure and morphology of AlN films are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that the AlN layers are formed by merged hexagonal microcrystals growing in two directions, and the following relation is approximately satisfied for both crystal orientations: AlN(1013)||Si(110). The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray rocking curve for the AlN(1013) diffraction peak averaged over the sample area is about 20 arcmin. A theoretical model explaining the presence of two orientations of AlN films on hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates is proposed, and a method for controlling their orientation is presented.",

            "text": "The study of the growth mechanisms of epitaxial AlN films is important for several reasons. Firstly, wurtzite AlN is a direct-gap semiconductor with a large band gap (6.2 eV) and therefore is a promising material for the manufacturing of ultraviolet optoelectronic devices [1]. Secondly, thin AlN layers are widely used as buffer layers for GaN growth [2]. For example, the formation of thin AlN layers on 6H\u2013SiC substrates before GaN growth allows the realization of a layer-by-layer growth mode with higher probability than a threedimensional growth mode. Moreover, during GaN growth on silicon substrates, gallium can chemically interact with silicon, leading to a significant degradation of the film; however, the deposition of AlN layers before the growth prevents this process. Most studies of epitaxial growth of III-nitride films are focused on the growth of polar layers [3]. However, in this case, large electric fields arise in the III-nitride film due to the piezoelectric effect and spontaneous polarization that cause the deterioration of device characteristics. It was found [4] that the intensity of polarization effects strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of the film and can be significantly reduced by synthesizing nonpolar and semipolar III-nitride layers. Therefore, the development of optoelectronic devices based on nonpolar and semipolar layers of III-nitrides is of high importance. At present, there\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15186202 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202 2 of 11\nare very few investigations of the initial growth stage of semipolar AlN layers, because the technology of semipolar AlN layer synthesis is complex. A detailed description of the complicated preparation techniques of substrates for the growth of semipolar AlN and GaN films can be found in the review [5]. Nevertheless, semipolar AlN layers have been obtained using metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) [6\u20138], hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) [5,9\u201312], plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA MBE) [13] and pulsed laser deposition [14]. Growth of semipolar AlN has been demonstrated on Al2O3(1010) substrates (m-plane) [7,8,10,13], SiC/Si(100) templates [6,9,11,12] and ZnO(1102) (r-plane) [14]. In the previous works [5,9,11,12], hybrid substrates consisting of 3C\u2013SiC epitaxial layers synthesized on a vicinal silicon surface deviated from the Si(100) plane by 4\u25e6\u00f77\u25e6 were used for the growth of AlN and GaN layers. The synthesis of the 3C\u2013SiC epitaxial layer was performed by the method of coordinated substitution of atoms. This method involves a chemical treatment of the surface of silicon substrate in the CO gas atmosphere. A detailed description of the method and the growth conditions to synthesize the hybrid SiC/Si substrates can be found in the reviews [15,16]. The advantages of the use of the hybrid SiC/Si substrates grown by the method of coordinated substitution of atoms for the growth of semipolar III-nitrides as compared to templates obtained by other methods are as follows. Usually, in order to grow semipolar III-nitride layers on various substrates, special etching techniques must be used to form the wedge-shaped facets of specific orientation on which semipolar III-nitrides could nucleate [5]. However, in the method of coordinated substitution of atoms, the wedgeshaped structure formation occurs naturally. It was shown in [5] that, during SiC synthesis on Si(100), the vicinal steps on the Si(100) plane are transformed into an array of parallel triangular-shaped SiC prisms faceted by the SiC(111) planes. Since the symmetry of atomic arrangement on the surfaces of such prisms is characteristic of both cubic and hexagonal crystals, crystals with both cubic and hexagonal symmetry can grow on their surfaces. The stable crystal phase will not be determined by the orientation of the substrate, but only by the growth conditions, i.e., temperature and incident fluxes. This opens up new perspectives for the growth of hexagonal semipolar crystals. According to the theoretical results obtained in [15], the Si(110) surface during the synthesis of the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrate will transform into the (110)-oriented surface covered with octahedron-like structures, one side of which is the SiC(111) facet and the other is the SiC(111) facet. These growth figures merge with each other forming \u201cmountain ranges\u201d separated by \u201cdepressions\u201d. The plane between the \u201cmountain ranges\u201d is the SiC(110) plane. The remaining planes of the SiC{111} and SiC{111} families are perpendicular to the Si(110) plane. The nucleation of semipolar AlN layers will occur primarily on the surface of these SiC facets. As a result, the AlN crystals oriented in two directions will grow on the surface of the SiC/Si(110) substrate, and the following crystallographic relation should be satisfied: AlN(0001)/(0001)||SiC(111)/(111). The nucleation of AlN on the SiC(110) facets will occur with a lower probability and only at high values of supersaturation; therefore, this process will occur much more slowly. The aim of this report is to prove experimentally the assumptions concerning the growth of AlN on the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates and to perform a rigorous quantitative analysis of the initial growth stage of AlN by HVPE on these substrates. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the experimental details of AlN film synthesis on the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates are described together with the growth conditions for the synthesis of SiC layers on Si(110) substrates. In Section 3, the results of investigations of the morphology and structure of AlN/SiC/Si(110) system are presented. Particularly, the presence of two crystallographic orientations of AlN films are experimentally proven, and it is shown that the following crystallographic relation is approximately satisfied: AlN(1013)||Si(110). In Section 4, a model of AlN nucleation on SiC/Si(110) is proposed, which is fully consistent with the experimental data. A method for controlling the orientation of AlN microcrystals is also presented in this section. Summary of our results and conclusions are given in Section 5.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202 3 of 11"

This is in agreement with the experimental data\non the angle between the AlN(101\u03053) planes of the crystals growing in two directions (7\u00b0).\nAccording to the classical nucleation theory [23], the nucleation rate of AlN islands\nis given by the Boltzmann distribution \ud835\udc3c~exp(\u2212\u0394\ud835\udc3a\u2217 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\u2044 ), where \u0394\ud835\udc3a \u2217 is the nucleation barrier, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35 is the Boltzmann constant and T is the growth temperature. Thus, to predict the nucleation probability of AlN islands on the SiC(111) and SiC(111\u0305) facets, firstly, it is\nnecessary to find the Gibbs energy of nucleus formation. The Gibbs energy of three-di-\nmensional AlN island formation is defined by the expression:\n\u0394\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc5b) = \u22123\ud835\udc5a2\ud835\udc5b\u0394\ud835\udf07 + 33 2\u2044 2\u2044 \ud835\udc5a2\ud835\udc4e2\u0394\ud835\udefe + 3\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc60 (3)\nThe crystallographic orientation of the AlN islands relative to the substrate is given by the following relations: AlN[0001]||SiC[111] and AlN[1210]||SiC[110] (for the nucleus on the left in Figure 6); AlN[0001]||SiC[111] and AlN [1210]||SiC[ 10] (for the nucleus on the right). The theoretically predicted value of the angle between the AlN(0001)/(0001) plane and the SiC(110) plane is 35.3\u25e6 (equal to the angle between the SiC(111)/(111) plane and the SiC(110) plane). The angle between the AlN(1013) plane of differently oriented hexagonal crystals and their AlN(0001)/(0001) plane that is parallel to the SiC(111)/(111) plane is 31.6\u25e6. As a result, we find that the AlN(1013) planes are deviated from the SiC(110) plane by 3.7\u25e6. This is in agreement with the experimental data on the angle between the AlN(1013) planes of the crystals growing in two directions (7\u25e6). According to the classical nucl ation theory [23], the nucleation rate of AlN islands is given by the Boltzmann distribution I \u223c exp(\u2212\u2206G\u2217/kBT), where \u2206G\u2217 is the nucleation barrier, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is t e growth temperature. Thus, to predict the nucleation probability of AlN islands on the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets, firstly, it is necessary to find the Gibbs energy of nucleus formation. The Gibbs energy of threedimensional AlN island formation is defined by the expression:\n\u2206G(m, n) = \u22123m2n\u2206\u00b5 + 33/2/2m2a2\u2206\u03b3 + 3mnac\u03b3s (3)\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202 7 of 11\nHere, m and n are the island base radius and the island height expressed in terms of the number of atoms; \u2206\u00b5 is the chemical potential difference per AlN pair; \u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3AlN + \u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3SiC, where \u03b3AlN, \u03b3SiC and \u03b3i are the surface energy of the AlN(0001)/(0001) facet of the island, the surface energy of the SiC(111)/(111) facet and the interphase energy of the AlN/SiC(111) interface (or the AlN/SiC(111) interface); \u03b3s is the surface energy of the AlN(1100) facet. The nucleation barrier of a three-dimensional AlN island equals\n\u2206G\u2217 = 33/2a4c2\u03b32s \u2206\u03b3\n2\u2206\u00b52 (4)\nIt follows from Formula (4) that the film growth regime depends on the value of the surface energy difference \u2206\u03b3, which includes only the energies \u03b3AlN, \u03b3i and \u03b3SiC (the surface energy of the island side facets \u03b3s is not included) [23]. If \u2206\u03b3 > 0, a threedimensional growth mode is energetically favorable. If \u2206\u03b3 < 0, a two-dimensional layer is formed, since the film will wet the substrate. Let us also give the expressions for the Gibbs energy and nucleation barrier of a two-dimensional AlN island:\n\u2206G(m) = \u22123m2\u2206\u00b5 + 33/2/2m2a2\u2206\u03b3 + 3mac\u03b3s (5)\n\u2206G\u2217 = 3/4 a2c2\u03b32s\n\u2206\u00b5\u2212 31/2a2\u2206\u03b3/2 (6)\nwhere the approximate value of the interfacial energy of the island perimeter (per unit length), \u03b3sc/2, is used. By equating Formulas (4) and (6), it is easy to show that the nucleation barriers for three- and two-dimensional islands are equal when \u2206\u00b5 = 31/2a2 \u2206\u03b3 provided that \u2206\u03b3 > 0 [23]. The ratio of the nucleation probabilities of the three-dimensional nuclei on SiC(111) and SiC(111) is given by the following expression:\nP(111) P(111) \u2248 exp\n( \u2212\u2206G\u2217(111)/kBT ) exp ( \u2212\u2206G\u2217\n(111) /kBT\n) = exp \u221233/2a4c2\u03b32s ( \u2206\u03b3(111) \u2212 \u2206\u03b3(111) ) 2\u2206\u00b52kBT  (7) \u2206G\u2217(111) and \u2206G \u2217 (111)\nare the nucleation barriers on the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets, \u2206\u03b3(111) and \u2206\u03b3(111) are the surface energy differences for nucleation on SiC(111) and SiC(111). The expression (7) is obtained by neglecting the difference in the attachment rates of III\u2013V pairs to the AlN islands on SiC(111) and SiC(111). It follows from Formula (7) that the nucleation rates on these two facets are equal when \u2206\u03b3(111) = \u2206\u03b3(111). If \u2206\u03b3(111) > \u2206\u03b3(111), then the nucleation rate is lower on the SiC(111) facet and vice versa; if \u2206\u03b3(111) < \u2206\u03b3(111), then the nucleation rate is higher on the SiC(111) facet. Considering the crystallographic orientations of AlN crystals shown in Figure 6 and using the reference data [24,26,27], we find that the difference \u2206\u03b3(111) \u2212 \u2206\u03b3(111) is mainly contributed by the surface energy differences of AlN and SiC, \u2206\u03b3AlN and \u2206\u03b3SiC, whereas the energy difference of the AlN/SiC interfaces, \u2206\u03b3i, is relatively small. A simple thermodynamic analysis is presented below to show how the growth direction of AlN crystals can be controlled. Calculation the surface energies of polar surfaces and interfaces is a complex problem. As a rule, calculations of these energies are performed using density-functional theory (DFT). The data on the absolute values of the polar AlN (SiC) surface energies and of the AlN/SiC interface energies are rarely reported in the literature. It should also be noted that the obtained values of these energies are approximate and, generally speaking, can be used only for qualitative analysis. Akiyama et al. [24,26] calculated by DFT the surface energies of the polar facets, AlN(0001) (with one N atom located above the \u201chexagonal channel\u201d in the 2 \u00d7 2 unit cell) and AlN(0001) (with the adsorption monolayer of Al), as well as the interface energies of the AlN/SiC(111) and AlN/SiC(111) interfaces (the latter interface is\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202 8 of 11\nidentical to the AlN/SiC(111) interface) (Figure 7). These values were obtained as functions of the difference \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5bulkAl (in eV), where \u00b5Al is the chemical potential of Al on the AlN surface and \u00b5bulkAl is the chemical potential of bulk Al. The values of \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5 bulk Al belong to the interval from EAlN to 0, where EAlN = \u22122.8 eV is the AlN formation enthalpy. The surface energies of the ideal SiC(111) and SiC(111) surfaces terminated by Si and C atoms, respectively, were calculated by Abavare et al. [27] using DFT: 2.856 J/m2 and 3.065 J/m2 for unrelaxed surfaces; 1.830 J/m2 and 2.720 J/m2 for relaxed surfaces. The surface energies of SiC(111) and SiC(111) were calculated assuming that an excess of Si and C atoms, respectively, is formed on the surfaces. The calculated values of \u2206\u03b3, which determine the nucleation mechanism of AlN islands on SiC, are shown in Figure 7 as a function of the chemical potential difference \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5bulkAl . The graphs in Figure 7 suggest how to determine the growth conditions under which the nucleation rates of the AlN islands on SiC(111) and SiC(111) are either the same or different. For example, the condition \u2206\u03b3(111) = \u2206\u03b3(111) is fulfilled if \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5bulkAl \u2248 \u22121.4 eV (or \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5 bulk Al \u2248 \u22121 eV when using the surface energies of unrelaxed SiC surfaces). Thus, the nucleation rates of three-dimensional islands on the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets are equal if the intermediate values of the chemical potential of Al on the AlN surface are maintained, i.e., \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5bulkAl \u2248 \u00b5N \u2212 \u00b5 bulk N . The AlN growth rate should be more intensive in the SiC[111] direction (\u2206\u03b3(111) < \u03b3(111)) in the Al-rich condition and vice versa, in the N-rich condition, the AlN.\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 11\non the AlN surface and \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc58 is the chemical potential of bulk Al.

Since the V/III ratio on the substrate is determined by that in the gas phase, the Al-rich condition can be interpreted as a result of a small V/III ration in the gas phase. It also follows from Figure 7 that, in the Al-rich condition, the value of \u2206\u03b3(111) may become negative. Then, a two-dimensional growth mode of the AlN layer may become energetically favorable, as follows from Equations (4) and (6). It is i portant to note that the thermodynamic analysis is performed without considering surface reconstructions involving foreign adsorbed particles in the system (e.g.,\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6202 9 of 11\nH atoms). If the AlN growth proceeds in the atmosphere of H2 (the carrier gas instead of Ar), an excess of H may be formed on the surface. The presence of H will change the value of the surface energies of the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets and, as shown in [28], their values will be close to each other. According to the calculation [26], in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen, the surface energy of polar AlN surfaces will also change. In the H-rich condition, the surface energy of AlN(0001) becomes less than the surface energy of AlN(0001) over the entire range of Al chemical potential. Consequently, in this case, the growth rate of AlN on the SiC(111) facets will be higher than that on the SiC(111) facets. From the performed analysis, it follows that, in the experimentally observed growth of AlN on SiC/Si(110), the condition \u00b5Al \u2212 \u00b5bulkAl \u2248 \u00b5N \u2212 \u00b5 bulk N is approximately satisfied since the numbers of hexagonal AlN crystals turned in two different directions are comparable quantities (differ by factor 2). Note that the ration of this numbers is also determined by the available surface area of the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets formed before the AlN film growth. Without considering the surface reconstructions, one can show using the Wulff construction that due to the higher energy of the SiC(111) facets [27,28], their area should be smaller; however, in the H-rich condition, the areas of the SiC(111) and SiC(111) facets will have close values. Thus, replacement of the Ar carrier gas with the H2 carrier gas can lead to a change in the growth mechanism of semipolar AlN layers on the SiC/Si(110) substrates. Moreover, in the H-rich condition, the chemical reaction of AlN formation should differ from the reaction (2) [5]. It is also important to note that, in the presence of foreign atoms in the system, it may become energetically favorable to nucleate AlN crystals of one polarity. The presence of two polarities of AlN crystals will be verified in further studies. The proposed model shows that, in principle, it is possible to control the relative number of hexagonal crystals growing in two different directions by changing the V/III ratio in the gas phase and, consequently, by changing this ration on the substrate."

            "text": "In conclusion, the growth mechanism of AlN films by HVPE on the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates has been investigated. The structural and morphological properties of AlN films and SiC buffer layers were studied by using XRD, SEM, RHEED and Raman spectroscopy. The crystallographic relations between AlN film and the substrate were determined, and it was found that the AlN film growth occurs by the merging of the hexagonal AlN microcrystals growing in two preferential directions. It was shown that the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates can be used as templates for the synthesis of semipolar AlN(1013) layers by HVPE. The growth of semipolar AlN on the SiC/Si(110) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The theoretical results concerning the nucleation mechanism of AlN are fully consistent with the experimental data. Based on the investigation of the structure and morphology of AlN layers, a crystallographic model explaining the presence of two orientations of the AlN film on SiC/Si(110) was proposed. It was found that it is possible to change the ratio of the number of crystals growing in two directions by changing the V/III ratio in the gas phase. The proposed model also explains the experimentally observed relationship between the crystallographic orientations of AlN and SiC. The presented study is important both from a purely scientific point of view, since the nucleation mechanisms of the AlN(1013) layers on the hybrid SiC/Si(110) substrates have been considered for the first time, and also for future practical applications. Semipolar AlN layers can be used not only as a material for microelectronics, but they can also act as substrates for the growth of compounds such as AlGaN and GaN.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.A.K., A.A.K. and A.V.O.; methodology S.A.K. and A.V.O.; investigation S.A.K., A.A.K., M.P.S., S.S.S. and A.V.O.; modeling A.A.K. and S.A.K.
