    "abstractText": "The reactions of alkenes with phenyl-N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodane PhI=NTf (1) have been studied in different conditions. In methylene chloride, in the presence of N-halosuccinimides, the products of mono and bis-triflamidation were obtained. In MeCN, the product of bromotriflamidation (with NBS) with solvent interception or of bis-triflamidation (with NIS) is formed. The reaction with trans-stilbene in acetonitrile with NBS gave rise to cyclization to 2-methyl-4,5-diphenyl-1-triflyl4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole. In contrast, with NIS as an oxidant, both in CH2Cl2 and MeCN, the major product was 2,3-diphenyl-1-triflylaziridine formed in good yield. With NBS, aziridine is also formed but as a minor product, the major one being a mixture of diastereomers of the product of bromotriflamidation. The reaction of compound 1 with vinylcyclohexane in methylene chloride affords the mixtures of regioisomers of the products of halotriflamidation, whereas in acetonitrile, the products of solvent interception and cyclization to the imidazoline are formed. A mechanism explaining the formation of all isolated products is proposed.",

            "text": "N-Trifluoromethylsulfonyl (triflyl) substituted nitrogen compounds occupy a unique place in organic chemistry [1\u20133]. The triflyl group is a very strong electron-withdrawing substituent responsible for the high NH-acidity of triflamides, their specific catalytic activity, the ability to form strong intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and a number of specific chemical properties. Low nucleophilicity and high NH-acidity allow triflamides to be used in a variety of organic reactions [1\u20133]. N-Triflylaziridines are of considerable interest from the viewpoint of their further transformations, allowing us to obtain structures that already contain the triflyl group. They have wide areas of application, such as nucleophilic ring opening to give N-protected alkyleneamines [4] and catalytic enantioselective alkylation of the methine carbon of carboxylic acids [5], which are used in the synthesis of tripodal tetradentate C3-symmetric amines [6]. N-Triflylaziridines are also widely employed in the synthesis of ligands for metal complex catalysis [7\u201314]. However, the methods of their synthesis meet significant difficulties precisely because of specific properties of the triflyl group. Prior to our studies, several examples of the synthesis of N-triflylaziridines were described in the literature. One of the first examples studied was the classical reaction of triflylazide with electron-rich O-TMS vinyl ethers [15] (Scheme 1, route 1):\nInt. J. Mol.

bis\u2010triflamidation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 double\u00a0 bond\u00a0 were\u00a0 obtained.\u00a0Note\u00a0 that\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0\n- fl\nhe necessity to use an unstable an explosive triflyl azi e greatly co plicates the reaction. Si ilar transfor ations of perfluorosulfonylazides and O-TMS ethers via the formation of N-perfluoromethylsulfonylaziridines give a set of \u03b1-[N-(peruoroalkanesulfonyl)] aminoketones and \u03b1-amino acids in good yields [16,17]. UV activation of the reaction of butene-2 with the azide H(CF2)2O(CF2)2SO2N3 affords the corresponding aziridine in 61% yield [18]. N-Triflylaziridine was also obtained by treating (2S)-2-amino-3-methylbutan-1-ol with triflic anhydride on strong cooling (Scheme 1, route 2) [19]. One of the most efficient methods for the synthesis of N-triflylaziridines is the reaction of alkenes with N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-bromane 4-CF3C6H4Br=NTf [20,21] prepared in situ or in advance through several steps [21,22] (Scheme 1, route 3). The reagent is formed by the reaction of triflamide with 4-CF3C6H4Br(OAc)2 synthesized, in turn, by treating difluoride 4-CF3C6H4BrF2 with acetic anhydride [21]. Difluoride is obtained by the reaction of 4- CF3C6H4SiMe3 with BrF3 [22]. N-Triflylimino-\u03bb3-bromane is relatively stable and can be stored under argon at 4 \u25e6C for several months [21,22]. The reagent can also be obtained directly, bypassing the diacetate formation step, from 4-CF3C6H4BrF2 [23]. Aziridination occurs with high chemoselectivity and in good to excellent yields (75\u201398%) (Scheme 1, Pathway 2) [20,21]. The scope of substrates included cycloalkenes C6\u2013C8, norbornene, styrenes, and octenes. At the same time, the overall synthesis of N-triflylaziridines in Scheme 1, Pathway 2 involves four separate stages and the use of BrF3, which significantly limits the synthetic applicability of the method. The addition of N,N-dichloroalkanesulfonamide I(CF2)2O(CF2)2SO2NCl2 to styrene in the presence of EtONa/EtOH affords the corresponding aziridine in 49% yield [24]. A shortcoming of highly reactive N,N-dichloroalkanesulfonamides as reagents is their instability in air moisture and the need for special storage conditions [25]. More stable than triflylimino-\u03bb3-bromane are triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodanes. The N-triflylsubstituted analogs of the latter, N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodanes ArI=NTf, were synthesized by the reaction of iodosobenzenes ArI=O with triflamide as late as in 2022 and used for amidation or imidation of phosphines and 1,3-diketones [26]. However, in our recent work [27], we found no aziridines in the reaction of styrene with triflamide and iodosobenzene in the presence of iodine and CuCl."

amidine 6 was confirmed by the presence of the NH doublet at 7.67 ppm, a doublet of triplets of CHN at 5.34 ppm, two doublets of diastere topic CH2Br at 3.73 and 3.64 pm, and the Me group singlet at 2.48 . e 13 s ectr contains the signals at 169 ( = ), 58 ( ), 34 ( 2Br), and 22.3 ( e). The spectra for co pounds 3, 4, 6 is offered in Supple entary aterials (Figures S1\u2013S9). In the presence of NIS, styrene reacts with N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodane 1 in acetonitrile to give the product of bis-triflamidation TfNHCH(Ph)\u2013CH2NHTf 7 in 54% yield, identical to that obtained earlier by the reaction with triflamide in the system t-BuOCl/NaI [30]. In continuation, we examined the reaction of compound 1 with some alkenes in the system I2/NaI/MeCN, which was successfully employed for the synthesis of Ntosylaziridines [31] (vide supra). In contrast, no aziridine was formed with compound 1, but only the aforementioned adduct 7 in a low yield of 25%. Under the same conditions, trans-stilbene and vinylcyclohexane did not react with compound 1. UV activation did not change the course of the reaction and only increased the yield of adduct 7 to 40%. When the oxidant I2/NaI was replaced by NBS or NIS, the reaction of N-triflylimino\u03bb3-iodane 1 and trans-stilbene 8 in acetonitrile led to cyclization and formation of 2-methyl4,5-diphenyl-1-triflyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole 9 (Scheme 4).\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nproducts\u00a0of\u00a0halotriflamidation\u00a03,\u00a04\u00a0 the\u00a0 triflamide\u00a0 residue\u00a0adds\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 \u03b1\u2010carbon\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 styrene\u00a0molecule\u00a0(Scheme\u00a02).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a0 2.\u00a0Oxidative\u00a0 triflamidation/iodination\u00a0 of\u00a0 styrene\u00a0with\u00a0 compound\u00a0 1\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 presence\u00a0 of\u00a0 N\u2010halosuccinimides\u00a0in\u00a0methylene\u00a0chloride.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0products\u00a0and,\u00a0hence,\u00a0the\u00a0regioselectivity\u00a0of\u00a0addition\u00a0is\u00a0proved\u00a0 by\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0NH\u00a0signal\u00a0at\u00a05.76\u00a0(3)\u00a0and\u00a05.89\u00a0ppm\u00a0(4),\u00a0multiplets\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0methine\u00a0 proton\u00a0at\u00a04.97\u00a0(3)\u00a0and\u00a04.78\u00a0ppm\u00a0(4),\u00a0and\u00a0doublets\u00a0of\u00a0doublets\u00a0at\u00a03.74\u00a0(3)\u00a0and\u00a03.56\u00a0(4)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 methylene\u00a0protons.\u00a0 Varying\u00a0the\u00a0solvent\u00a0from\u00a0CH2Cl2\u00a0to\u00a0MeCN\u00a0changes\u00a0the\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0reaction;\u00a0with\u00a0 NBS,\u00a0 N\u2010(2\u2010bromo\u20101\u2010phenylethyl)\u2010N\u2019\u2010(triflyl)acetimidamide\u00a0 6\u00a0 is\u00a0 obtained\u00a0 in\u00a0 moderate\u00a0 yield\u00a0(Scheme\u00a03).\u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a03.\u00a0Bromotriflamidation\u00a0of\u00a0styrene\u00a0with\u00a0solvent\u00a0interception\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0NBS.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0amidine\u00a06\u00a0was\u00a0confirmed\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0NH\u00a0doublet\u00a0at\u00a07.67\u00a0 ppm,\u00a0a\u00a0doublet\u00a0of\u00a0triplets\u00a0of\u00a0CHN\u00a0at\u00a05.34\u00a0ppm,\u00a0two\u00a0doublets\u00a0of\u00a0diastereotopic\u00a0CH2Br\u00a0at\u00a0 3.73\u00a0 and\u00a0 3.64\u00a0 ppm,\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0Me\u00a0 group\u00a0 singlet\u00a0 at\u00a0 2.48\u00a0 ppm.\u00a0 The\u00a0 13C\u00a0NMR\u00a0 spectrum\u00a0 contains\u00a0the\u00a0signals\u00a0at\u00a0169\u00a0(C=N),\u00a058\u00a0(CHN),\u00a034\u00a0(CH2Br),\u00a0and\u00a022.3\u00a0(Me).\u00a0The\u00a0NMR\u00a0spectra\u00a0 for\u00a0compounds\u00a03,\u00a04,\u00a06\u00a0is\u00a0offered\u00a0in\u00a0Supplementary\u00a0Materials\u00a0(Figures\u00a0S1\u2013S9).\u00a0 In\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0NIS,\u00a0styrene\u00a0reacts\u00a0with\u00a0N\u2010triflylimino\u2010\u03bb3\u2010iodane\u00a01\u00a0in\u00a0acetonitrile\u00a0 to\u00a0give\u00a0the\u00a0product\u00a0of\u00a0bis\u2010triflamidation\u00a0TfN CH(Ph)\u2013CH2NHTf\u00a07\u00a0in\u00a054%\u00a0yield,\u00a0identical\u00a0 to\u00a0that\u00a0obtained\u00a0earlier\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0with\u00a0triflamide\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0system\u00a0t\u2010BuOCl/NaI\u00a0[30].\u00a0 \u00a0 In\u00a0continuatio ,\u00a0 e\u00a0exa i e \u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0of\u00a0compound\u00a01\u00a0with\u00a0some\u00a0alkenes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 system\u00a0 I2/NaI/MeCN,\u00a0 whic \u00a0 was\u00a0 successfully\u00a0 e l e \u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 synthesis\u00a0 of\u00a0 N\u2010tosylaziridines\u00a0[31]\u00a0(vide\u00a0supra).\u00a0In\u00a0contrast,\u00a0no\u00a0 iri i \u00a0 \u00a0for ed\u00a0with\u00a0compound\u00a01,\u00a0 but\u00a0only\u00a0the\u00a0aforementioned\u00a0adduct\u00a07\u00a0in\u00a0 \u00a0l \u00a0 i l \u00a0 f\u00a0 .\u00a0 \u00a0t \u00a0 \u00a0co itions,\u00a0 trans\u2010stilbene\u00a0and\u00a0vinylcyclohexane\u00a0 id\u00a0not\u00a0react\u00a0with\u00a0compound\u00a01.\u00a0UV\u00a0activation\u00a0did\u00a0 not\u00a0change\u00a0the\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0a d\u00a0o ly\u00a0increas d\u00a0the\u00a0yield\u00a0of\u00a0adduct\u00a07\u00a0to\u00a040%.\u00a0 When\u00a0 the\u00a0 oxidant\u00a0 I2/NaI\u00a0 was\u00a0 replaced\u00a0 by\u00a0 NBS\u00a0 or\u00a0 NIS,\u00a0 the\u00a0 eact on\u00a0 of\u00a0 N\u2010triflylimino\u2010\u03bb3\u2010iodane\u00a0 1\u00a0 and\u00a0 trans\u2010stilb n \u00a0 8\u00a0 in\u00a0 acetonitrile\u00a0 led\u00a0 to\u00a0 cyclization\u00a0 and\u00a0 formatio \u00a0of\u00a02\u2010methyl\u20104,5\u2010diphenyl\u20101\u2010triflyl\u20104,5\u2010dihydro\u20101H\u2010imidazole\u00a09\u00a0(Scheme\u00a04).\u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a04.\u00a0Bromotriflamidation\u00a0with\u00a0solvent\u00a0interception\u00a0and\u00a0dehydrobrominative\u00a0cyclization.\u00a0Scheme 4.

Bro otrifla i ation ith solvent interce tion an ehy robro inative cyclization.\nThe structure of aziridine 10 was proved by IR and NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by HRMS data. In particular, the values of the 1JCH constants in the aziridine moiety are known to be much larger than in saturated aliphatic compounds and lie in the range of 170\u2013180 Hz [32\u201334]. The measured value of 1JCH in product 10 is 177 Hz, which unambiguously proves its structure. The HRMS spectrum shows a molecular ion m/z at 328.06242, corresponding to the molecular formula C15H13F3NO2S+. Earlier, it was shown that the reaction of styrenes with tosylamide in acetonitrile in the presence of t-BuOI leads to the substituted aziridines [35]. However, no aziridine is formed in the reaction with triflamide under the same conditions, but only the product of bistriflamidation and disubstituted piperazine, which is, formally, the product of dimerization of the target aziridine [30]. It can be assumed that the formation of piperazine is the result of relative instability of the intermediate 2-phenyl-1-triflylaziridine, because its analog, 2-phenyl-1-tosylaziridine is stable [30]. Presumably, the stability of aziridine 10 is due to the presence of the second phenyl group stabilizing the molecule. In methylene chloride, the NIS-induced reaction also gives aziridine 10 in about the same yield, but with NBS it is the minor product, whereas the major product was identified to be N-(2-bromo-1,2diphenylethyl)triflamide 11 (Scheme 6).\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 structure\u00a0 and\u00a0 composition\u00a0 of\u00a0 imidazole\u00a0 9\u00a0 was\u00a0 confirmed\u00a0 by\u00a0 IR,\u00a0 NMR\u00a0 spectroscopy,\u00a0 and\u00a0 high\u2010resolution\u00a0 mass\u00a0 spectrometry\u00a0 (HRMS),\u00a0 which\u00a0 showed\u00a0 the\u00a0 molecular\u00a0ion\u00a0[M\u00a0+ H]+\u00a0with\u00a0 /z\u00a0369.08807\u00a0corresp nding\u00a0to\u00a0C17H16F3N2O2S+.\u00a0When\u00a0using NIS\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0oxidant,\u00a0imidazole\u00a09\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0formed\u00a0but\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0minor\u00a0product,\u00a0the\u00a0major\u00a0on being\u00a02,3\u2010diphenyl\u20101\u2010triflylaziridine\u00a010\u00a0isolated\u00a0in\u00a078%\u00a0yield\u00a0(Scheme\u00a05).\u00a0The formation\u00a0of aziridine\u00a0 10\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0 first\u00a0 case\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 synthesis\u00a0 of\u00a0 N\u2010sulfonylaziridines\u00a0 usi g N\u2010sulfonyl mino\u2010\u03bb3\u2010iodanes\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0source\u00a0of\u00a0th \u00a0n trogen\u00a0group.\u00a0 \u00a0\n25oC, 24 h\nNIS, MeCN + N\nPhPh\n+1 8 14%\n10, 78 %\n9\nTf \u00a0\nScheme\u00a05.\u00a0Bromotriflamidation\u00a0with\u00a0solvent\u00a0interception\u00a0and\u00a0dehydrobrominative\u00a0cyclization.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 st uctu e\u00a0 of\u00a0 z ridine\u00a0 10\u00a0 was\u00a0 p oved\u00a0 by\u00a0 IR\u00a0 and\u00a0 NMR\u00a0 spectroscopy\u00a0 and\u00a0 confirmed\u00a0by\u00a0HRMS\u00a0data.\u00a0In\u00a0particular,\u00a0the\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a01JCH\u00a0constants\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0aziridine\u00a0 moiety\u00a0are\u00a0known\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0much\u00a0larger\u00a0th n in\u00a0saturated aliphatic\u00a0compounds\u00a0and\u00a0lie\u00a0in\u00a0the ra ge\u00a0of\u00a0170\u2013180\u00a0Hz\u00a0[32,33,34].\u00a0The\u00a0measur d\u00a0value \u00a01JCH in\u00a0product\u00a010\u00a0is\u00a0177\u00a0Hz,\u00a0wh ch unambiguously\u00a0proves its\u00a0structure.\u00a0The HRMS\u00a0spectrum\u00a0shows\u00a0a\u00a0molecular\u00a0ion\u00a0m/z\u00a0at 328.06242,\u00a0corresponding\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0molecular\u00a0formula\u00a0C15H13F3NO2S+.\u00a0 Earlier,\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0shown that\u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0of\u00a0styrenes\u00a0with\u00a0t sylamide\u00a0in\u00a0acetonitrile in the\u00a0presen e\u00a0of\u00a0t\u2010BuOI\u00a0 leads\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0substituted\u00a0aziridines.[35]\u00a0However,\u00a0no\u00a0aziridine\u00a0 is\u00a0 formed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0reaction\u00a0 ith\u00a0triflamide\u00a0under\u00a0the\u00a0sam \u00a0conditi ns,\u00a0but\u00a0only th \u00a0product\u00a0of bis\u2010triflamidation\u00a0 and disubstituted\u00a0 piperazine,\u00a0 which\u00a0 is,\u00a0 formally,\u00a0 the\u00a0 product\u00a0 of dimerization\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 target\u00a0 aziridin \u00a0 [30].\u00a0 It\u00a0 can\u00a0 be\u00a0 assumed\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 formation\u00a0 p pe azine\u00a0 s\u00a0 the\u00a0 resul \u00a0 of\u00a0 relative\u00a0 instability of\u00a0 the\u00a0 intermediate 2\u2010phenyl\u20101\u2010triflylaziridine,\u00a0 because\u00a0 its\u00a0 analog,\u00a0 2\u2010ph nyl\u20101\u2010tosylaziridine\u00a0 is\u00a0 stable\u00a0 [30].

The NH signals in compounds 13 and 15 appear as clearly resolved doublets, whereas in their isomers 14 and 16, they look as an unresolved broad singlet (X = Br) or as a triplet (X = I). In regioisomers 13 and 15 the methine protons of the CH\u2013CH2 spin system resonate in a higher field than the methylene protons, whereas in regioisomers 14 and 16 their relative position is reversed. In the 13C NMR spectra, the most upfield signals belong to the CH2Br (37 ppm) or CH2I carbons (13 ppm). Replacing the solvent in the reaction in Scheme 7 from methylene chloride to acetonitrile gives rise to the formation of additional products.

A mechanistic scheme allowing to explain the formation of all products in Schemes 2\u20139 is presented in Scheme 10. The specific reactivity of triflamide leads to the formation (under the conditions of the reactions) of both N-sulfonylamidines, products containing acetamide and triflamide groups, and products formed without the participation of a solvent as a reagent in the reaction. Since the basicity of acetonitrile (780 kJ/mol) [36] is higher than that of triflamide (740 kJ/mol) [1], acetonitrile is a stronger nucleophile than triflamide, which leads to the formation of amidines (or the corresponding acetamides upon hydrolysis of the corresponding intermediate), as shown in Scheme 10. The use of CH2Cl2 eliminates the involvement of the solvent in the reaction.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "To summarize, the reactions of alkenes with phenyl-N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodane, which has only recently been introduced in organic synthesis, in the presence of N-halosuccinimides as oxidants, have been investigated. Depending on the substrate, solvent, and oxidant, a variety of linear and heterocyclic products of triflamidation were obtained. Thus, in methylene chloride, the products of halotriflamidation were obtained with styrene and vinylcyclohexane, and the regioselectivity of the reaction was determined. In acetonitrile, the solvent competes with weak triflamide anion in addition to the C=C double bond and leads to the formation of amidines. The reaction with stilbene was shown to be the first example of the synthesis of N-triflylaziridines using N-triflylimino-\u03bb3-iodane. Remarkably, in the reaction with NIS, N-triflylaziridine is formed in equally good yield in methylene chloride and in acetonitrile, while with NBS it is formed in much lower yield and only in methylene chloride; in acetonitrile, N-triflylimidazoline was obtained in a good yield as a result of bromotriflamidation followed by dehydrobromination with cyclization. A tentative mechanism starting with the addition of electrophilic halogen to alkene is proposed that accounts for the formation of all observed products.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms242115947/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.S.G., M.Y.M., B.A.S.; methodology, A.S.G., M.Y.M.; investigation, A.S.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.S.G., M.Y.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.A.S.; supervision, M.Y.M.; project administration, M.Y.M.; funding acquisition, B.A.S.
