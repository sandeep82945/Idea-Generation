    "abstractText": "In this study, we proposed the idea of replacing the traditional objective lens in bottomillumination mode with a plasmonic lens (PL) to achieve tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). The electric field energy of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of the spiral PL was found to be more concentrated at the focal point without any sidelobe using the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method compared with that of a symmetry-breaking PL. This property reduces far-field background noise and increases the excitation efficiency of the near-field Raman signal. The disadvantage of only the near-field Raman scattering of samples at the center of the structure being detected when using an ordinary PL in TERS is overcome by using our proposed method of changing only the polarization of the incident light.",

            "text": "Although scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are used to break the diffraction limit for imaging various sample surfaces at high resolution, their chemical and biological information at the nanometer scale cannot be determined. To analyze vibrational spectroscopy, the chemical or biological properties of samples are studied using methods such as Raman spectroscopy, a nondestructive and powerful tool that is widely used for the detection of molecular compositions, chemical bonds, and crystal structures [1\u20133]. Compared to crystalline materials, the majority of samples, such as biomolecules, are weak Raman scatterers, that is, their Raman scattering cross section is very small [4\u20136]. To significantly enhance the intensity and resolution of the Raman scattering signal, near-field optical microscopy is combined with Raman scattering technology to form a TERS system [7\u201310]. TERS arises from the strong enhancement of the electromagnetic field occurring at the apex of a sharp noble-metal tip when irradiated by an incident light with strong longitudinal components due to the excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and the lightning rod effect [11,12]. The sharp metal tip, placed in close proximity to the sample, acts as an active probe, efficiently enhancing the localized field and scattering Raman emission [13\u201315]. The metalized AFM probe therefore acts as the most commonly used metal nanoantenna. Three different modes of excitation are used in TERS: bottom, side, and top illumination [16\u201318]. Side and top illumination are ideal for large, opaque samples with considerable thicknesses, whereas bottom illumination is perfect for transparent samples. Bottom illumination is preferred when all three types meet the requirements because it usually uses an oil lens as the focusing lens. This can not only increase the strength of the longitudinal electric field (the direction of the electric field is parallel to the axis of the tip) that contributes to the enhanced local electric field formed when the tip is above the focal point but makes the focal point as small as possible. Therefore, the large far-field imaging noise due to a large spot size (produced using an objective lens with a relatively small numerical aperture\nSensors 2022, 22, 5636. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22155636 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 5636 2 of 10\nand a long working distance in side-illumination mode) is reduced in bottom-illumination mode. The problem associated with top-illumination TERS that the contrast is close to the noise level because the generated Raman signal is blocked by the cantilever does not occur in bottom-illumination mode, so bottom-illumination mode has been widely used in a variety of situations. To further improve the Raman intensity, the incident light is radially polarized, which produces a single solid focal point in the z-direction electric field. In contrast, a linearly polarized light forms a focus in the z-direction electric field of two lobes. The z-electric field intensity at the focal point is only half that of the radially polarized light, reducing the enhancement effect and sensitivity in TERS [19]. To further improve the Raman intensity, a perfect radially polarized beam is used [20,21]. However, a complex optical system is required, irrespective of the type of light used. The desired enhancement of Raman scattering is achieved only when the excitation light and the objective lens are strictly aligned [4]. In bottom-illumination TERS, instead of a conventional optical lens, a novel metallic plasmonic lens (PL) is used. Mingqian Zhang et al. [22] generated the Raman spectrum of single-walled carbon nanotubes using a PL with symmetry-breaking, semiannular slits corrugated on a gold film to TERS under linearly polarized beam illumination. However, they only detected the sample at the focal point at the center of the structure and therefore obtained the near-field Raman scattering signal only at this point. In this study, we designed a spiral PL to generate a single surface plasmon polariton (SPP) focal point and plasmonic vortex using left- (LCP) and right-handed circular polarization (RCP) illumination, respectively. This method not only reduces the far-field background noise by eliminating sidelobes at the focal point and enhances the excitation efficiency of the near-field Raman signal [22] but also achieves a near-field Raman scattering signal at other points of the sample (at the plasmonic vortex) by changing the position of the tip and the polarization of the incident light."

            "text": "A PL works on the principle of excitation of SPPs by metal slits, as shown in Figure 1. When the wavelength of the incident light is more than twice the width of the slit, no transverse electric (TE) waves (E is parallel to the slit long axis) propagate through the slit. However, according to the electromagnetic wave equation in matter, Jy = \u03c3Ey, where Jy is the current density, \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity, and Ey is the electric field intensity, a very low electric field intensity yields a very high current density due to the high conductivity of the metallic material when TM waves (E is vertical to the slit long axis) incident on a metal, which is considered an ideal conductor with no electromagnetic field. According to the boundary conditions, Jy is equal to the surface magnetic field intensity (Hy), and the surface charge density (\u03c1) is equal to the inductance perpendicular to the surface (Dy). Jy stops abruptly at the edges of the slit, causing an accumulation of charges at the sharp corners, and these charges on opposite edges of the slit behave like an electric dipole [23\u201326]. Because these dipoles oscillate with the incident wave, they act as light sources emitting photons (kem). Inside the slit, the surface charges and currents carry these photons in the z direction, disrupting the movement of charges at the exit edges and giving rise to another large dipole. These charges are accumulated at the upper and lower corners of the slit during the timeharmonic steady state. The electromagnetic waves radiated by the dipoles oscillating on the lower surface are diffracted when they propagate to the slit on the upper surface, and electromagnetic waves with a wave vector equal to that of the SPP are generated (ksc), which ultimately excite the SPP propagating along the metal surface; therefore, the edge of the slit is considered a line of SPP point sources. The normal incidence of light generates an equal phase distribution of electron oscillations across the slit, and the propagation direction of SPPs generated by the slit is always perpendicular to the slit. In other words, the direction for SPPs coincides with the polarization direction of the illuminating beam because SPPs are generated only by the polarization component that is perpendicular to the slit. Furthermore, the projected component of the electric field in the propagation direction of SPPs excites SPPs if the polarization direction of the incident light is not perpendicular to the slit.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5636 3 of 10\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 11\ncomponent that is perpendicular to the slit. Furthermore, the projected component of the electric field in the propagation direction of SPPs excites SPPs if the polarization direction of the incident light is not perpendicular to the slit.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of SPPs excited by the metal slit.\nIn curved slits, each SPP point source on the curve is excited only by the normal incident light, with polarization component perpendicular to the slit. The PL is obtained using different structures, such that the SPP can achieve constructive interference somewhere in the structure to form the focus of the SPP. In other words, an SPP with a shorter wavelength and a strong longitudinal electric field that dominates the excitation field can be focused by a PL into a smaller subwavelength spot size. The geometry of a PL with spiral slits is r = a + (\u03bbSPPm \u2205)/2\u03c0 [27], where r is the distance between the center of the PL to the slit with the azimuthal angle \u2205; a is the inner radius of the PL; \u03bbSPP is the effective wavelength of the SPP; and m is the geometric charge of the PL, which is taken as 1. The spin angular momentum of the circularly polarized beam is \u03c3 = s\u210f, where s = +1 for RCP, and s = \u22121 for LCP. The polarization state of the circularly polarized beam changes over time, but its amplitude is constant. At a certain moment, the SPP point source on the spiral slit (the connecting line between the point and the center of the structure is along the polarization direction of the incident light) emits SPP waves propagating along the polarization direction of the incident light. In the next moment, the polarization state of the incident light is changed to another direction, whereas the amplitude remains unchanged, so there is another point source on the spiral slit to complete the above process. Other points also emit SPPs excited by the projection of an electric field that is perpendicular to the slit and that is also the propagation direction of SPPs. When LCP is the source of excitation, the SPP waves with the same amplitude emitted by each point are at the same distance from the center after one rotation of the polarization state of the circularly polarized beam. After some time, the SPP waves emitted by each point source can interfere at the center and form a focal point with strong longitudinal electric field components, as shown in Figure 2a. The final effect is equivalent to that a radially polarized beam excites SPPs by illuminating each point of the circular groove in the metal film.\nFigure 1.

The spin angular momentum of the circularly polarized beam is \u03c3 = s}, where s = +1 for RCP, and s = \u22121 for LCP. The polarization state of the circularly polarized beam changes over time, but its amplitude is constant. At a certain moment, the SPP point source on the spiral slit (the connecting line between the point and the center of the structure is along the polarization direction of the i cident light) emits SPP waves propagating along the polarization direction of the incident light. I the ext moment, the pol rization state of the incident light is changed to an ther direction, w ereas the amplitud remains unch nged, so there is another point source on the spiral slit to omplete the above process. Other points also emit SPPs exc ted by the projection of a electric field hat is perpendicular to the slit and t at is also the propagation direction of SPPs.

The final ff ct is equivalent to that a radially p larized beam excites SPPs by illu inating each point of the circul r groove in th metal film. Figure 2c shows a case in which the incident beam is RCP, where the SPP waves with the same amplitude traversing toward the center emitted by point sources at both ends of the diameter are no longer the same distance from the center after one rotation of the polarization state of circularly polarized beams, but will be different by \u03bbSPP. Thus, an SPP vortex with a radius of approximately \u03bbSPP/2 is formed at the center of the structure. The total topological charge of the SP vortex is described by q = m + s, where q = 1 \u2212 1 = 0 for LCP, that is, the formation is a zero-order Bezier beam with a focused spot; and q = 1 + 1 = 2 for RCP, that is, the formation is a second-order Bessel beam, the size of which is the solution of second-order Bessel function of the first kind [28].\nSensors 2022, 22, 5636 4 of 10Sensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 11\nFigure 2c shows a case in which the incident beam is RCP, where the SPP waves with the same amplitude traversing toward the center emitted by point sources at both ends of the diameter are no longer the same distance from the center after one rotation of the polarization state of circularly polarized beams, but will be different by \u03bbSPP.

As the PL is etched on metals, it can be used as a substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to form STM-TERS devices that operate under low-temperature and ultra-high vacuum conditions with higher system stability and higher resolution than AFM-TERS.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.G.; software, K.G.; data curation, K.G.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, K.G. and Y.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.G., M.S. and Y.Z.; supervision, K.G. and M.S.
