    "abstractText": "The increasing relevance of improved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to treat neurodegenerative diseases has strengthened the need to reliably measure their brain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The aim of this study was, therefore, to absolutely quantify the therapeutic antibody ocrelizumab (OCR) as a model antibody in mouse brain interstitial fluid (ISF), and to record its PK profile by using cerebral open flow microperfusion (cOFM). Further, to monitor the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity using an endogenous antibody with a similar molecular size as OCR. The study was conducted on 13 male mice. Direct and absolute OCR quantification was performed with cOFM in combination with zero flow rate, and subsequent bioanalysis of the obtained cerebral ISF samples. For PK profile recording, cerebral ISF samples were collected bi-hourly, and brain tissue and plasma were collected once at the end of the sampling period. The BBB integrity was monitored during the entire PK profile recording by using endogenous mouse immunoglobulin G1. We directly and absolutely quantified OCR and recorded its brain PK profile over 96 h. The BBB remained intact during the PK profile recording. The resulting data provide the basis for reliable PK assessment of therapeutic antibodies in the brain thus favoring the further development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.",

            "text": "In recent years, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for target antigens in humans have been developed as part of an emerging strategy to treat neurodegenerative diseases [1]. However, assessment of their pharmacokinetic (PK) remains challenging, as only about 0.1% to 1% of the therapeutic antibodies from the systemic circulation finally enter the brain due to the restrictive action of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) [2]. Several strategies have been developed to improve the brain penetration properties of such therapeutic antibodies and promising outcomes have increased the relevance of mAbs, thus strengthening the need to continuously and reliably measure the brain PK profiles of these therapeutics [3,4]. Since many targets of mAbs are located in the interstitial fluid (ISF) that is surrounding the brain cells, cerebral ISF is the compartment of choice to assess relevant antibody concentrations [5,6]. To date, there are only two technologies that can extract ISF from brain in a time-resolved manner, and enable subsequent quantification of large therapeutic molecules in the collected samples; these are microdialysis (MD) with a large molecular\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1880. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15071880 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1880 2 of 14\nweight cut-off membrane [7\u20139] and open flow microperfusion (cOFM) [8\u201310]. MD and cOFM differ in the presence/absence of a membrane at the probe\u2019s interface between perfusion fluid and brain ISF. The membrane-free cOFM probes allow prolonged sampling of diluted and otherwise unchanged ISF and the collected samples contain the whole molecule spectrum of the ISF [9]. This is in contrast to MD probes where the polymeric semipermeable membrane only permits the sampling of substances up to a specific molecular weight, determined by the cut-off value of the membrane. Further, the MD membrane itself is susceptible to the adsorption of various ISF components, which might bias results and prevent prolonged sampling [7]. Both MD and cOFM can be applied in combination with different quantification protocols such as no net flux or zero flow rate [9,11\u201313] for direct and absolute quantification of substances inside the brain ISF. The BBB integrity status is especially relevant during PK assessment as the measured antibody concentrations in cerebral ISF are only reliable when the cerebral ISF is collected with an intact BBB. cOFM probe insertion inevitably disrupts the BBB whose integrity, however, is restored after 14 days [14]. The restoration of BBB integrity is a progressive process in which the BBB is established earlier for larger than for smaller molecules. However, by now, the BBB integrity status during cOFM sampling has only been continuously investigated with sodium fluorescein as a marker molecule, which is about 400 times smaller than a therapeutic antibody. For large molecules of the size of a mAb (about 145 kDa) the BBB integrity status has never been assessed in a continuous manner, but only at a few well-defined time points during the cerebral ISF sampling [8,14]. Although antibody concentrations in brain ISF have been examined with cOFM before and a brain PK profile has been recorded for 48 h [9], accurate and time-resolved quantification of an antibody in the brain to record PK profiles requires cOFM sampling over an extended period of time with a reliable intact BBB for the respective therapeutic molecule during the entire sampling period. The aim of this study was, therefore, to absolutely quantify the therapeutic antibody ocrelizumab (OCR) by performing continuous cOFM sampling in combination with the quantification protocol zero flow rate, and to record its PK profile in brain ISF for 96 h. Further, we aimed to monitor the integrity of the BBB in a time-resolved manner while recording the PK profile over the entire sampling duration using an endogenous tracer with similar molecular size and PK properties as OCR."

The concentrations of OCR in brain ISF were calculated based on studies from Bungay et al. and Chen et al. [17,18]. To perform zero flow rate, each animal of group one was dosed six hours prior to connection to the tethering system. The cOFM probes were flushed with perfusate once and then the flow rate was set to 0.2 \u00b5L/min. After a run-in phase of one hour, the cOFM sampling started and cOFM samples were collected every four hours. The flow rates were increased stepwise after each sampling interval (from 0.2 \u00b5L/min to 0.3 \u00b5L/min, 0.5 \u00b5L/min, 1 \u00b5L/min, 1.5 \u00b5L/min, and 2 \u00b5L/min), and the mean OCR concentrations in the cerebral ISF samples were assessed for the different flow rates.

The first cOFM sample was used as the baseline sample (sampling time: \u22122 to 0 h, pre-dose) and dosing was performed immediately after having taken the baseline sample at t = 0. Then, cOFM samples were collected every 2 h and stored in a refrigerated fraction collector (Bioanalytical Systems Inc., West Lafayette, IN, USA) for 96 h. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated sample vials (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany) two minutes prior to dosing and at the end of the cOFM sampling procedure at t = 96 h. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7 g for five minutes at room temperature, and the supernatant plasma was transferred into sample vials. After termination of the cOFM sampling, the animals were disconnected from the tethering system and euthanized by pentobarbital (300 mg/kg; intravenously) injection, followed by transcardiac perfusion with PBS 1\u00d7 and Heparin.

All samples were stored at \u221280 \u25e6C until the analytical measurements were performed. BBB integrity monitoring: The BBB integrity was monitored by assessing the mouse immunoglobulin G1 (mIgG1) concentrations in the cOFM samples. The obtained cOFM samples were divided into two aliquots, one for OCR analytics and a second one for mIgG1 analytics. Six aliquots per 24 h were used for mIgG1 analyses."

Discussion We were able to directly and absolutely quantify the therapeutic antibody OCR in mouse brain ISF and to record the brain PK profile of OCR for 96 h by performing cOFM sampling, combined with the quantification protocol zero flow rate, and, subsequently, analyzing the cerebral ISF samples. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the BBB remained intact for a large therapeutic antibody during the entire PK profile recording. The continuous cOFM sampling to record the PK profile was stable for a duration of 96 h. The prolonged sampling duration allowed capturing a significant portion of the OCR\u2019s PK profile, which is particularly important for such macromolecules that have plasma half-lives of days compared to small molecules with plasma half-lives in the order of hours. Up to now, there is one study that has demonstrated cOFM\u00b4s feasibility of continuously sampling antibodies in brain tissue, and that has recorded the PK profile of the therapeutic antibody in cerebral ISF [9]. In this previous study, trastuzumab has been used as a model antibody [9], which has about the same molecular size as the antibody we applied in our study. Both trastuzumab and OCR are humanized monoclonal IgG1s. However, in contrast to trastuzumab, which is licensed for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer OCR is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsing or primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis [20\u201323]. OCR targets CD20+ B cells and depletes the number of these in circulation. Moreover, B cells have also been found in biopsies and autopsies of MS lesions indicating that OCR might have a target inside the brain parenchyma [24,25]. In contrast to our study, the study performed by Le Prieult et al. had a limited study duration of 48 h, and the absolute quantification procedure has been performed differently compared to the here presented study, particularly with regard to the cOFM-derived antibody concentrations [9]. Moreover, the BBB integrity status for the antibody during sampling remained unclear in this previous cOFM study [9].\nFigure 6. mIgG1 concentrations in plasma at t = 0 and 96 h (solid) and mIgG1 concentration in brain tissue homogenate at t = 96 h (hatched) (n = 5).\nAssuming that the mass transfer resistance in brain tissue of mIgG1 is similar to that of a human IgG1 therapeutic antibody we used the RR value of 6.8% to correct the mIgG1 concentrations.

In contrast to our study, the study performed by Le Prieult et al. had a limited study duration of 48 h, and the absolute quantification procedure has been performed differently\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1880 10 of 14\ncompared to the here presented study, particularly with regard to the cOFM-derived antibody concentrations [9]. Moreover, the BBB integrity status for the antibody during sampling remained unclear in this previous cOFM study [9]. In order to get reliable cOFM-derived antibody concentration values it is advisable to apply an RR-based correction factor to the measured concentration values. In the presented study here, we determined the in vivo RR of the respective cOFM probe by applying the same flow rates as in the PK study which we were then using for data correction. In general, the in vivo RR is affected by two factors: first, the flow rate of the perfusion fluid through the probe (that is determining the degree of dilution of the collected ISF); second, the mass transfer resistance of the antibody in the ISF [17,18]. Although the perfusate and the ISF can exchange freely through the open pores at the exchange area of the cOFM probe, the RR of a cOFM probe never reaches 100% and, therefore, cOFM samples always contain diluted cerebral ISF. This is because the perfusate, which is flowing continuously through the probe, is constantly replacing the volume at the interface between the probe and the ISF, and the time for volume exchange at this interface is usually too short to reach equilibrium between the perfusate and the ISF. Moreover, the molecules that had been removed from the tissue in the vicinity of the probe have to be replaced by molecules diffusing from the adjacent tissue to the probe. Diffusion in tissue is a more limiting factor for larger molecules than for smaller ones and becomes a main contributor to RR when sampling large molecules such as antibodies [26]. We assessed the in vivo RR based on the theoretical framework of Bungay et al. [17] that has initially been developed for MD. It relies on the assumption that the mass transfer resistance is composed of the mass transfer resistances in the semipermeable membrane, the perfusate, and the external medium [17,18]. As the cOFM probe lacks a membrane, the mass transfer resistance in a membrane can be set to zero in cOFM studies. Further, the mass transfer resistance of the antibody in the perfusate is negligibly small compared to that in the external medium (i.e., brain tissue), which is also supported by previous data showing that the diffusion coefficient of antibodies in the brain tissue is reduced by ten times compared to the free diffusion [17,19]. According to these considerations, the mass transfer resistance of a cOFM probe is determined exclusively by the resistance of the antibody in brain ISF. In contrast to the in vivo RR, the in vitro RR of a probe mainly reflects the adsorption of the substance of interest to the probe material and, thus, it is of limited value when used as a measure to describe the in vivo sampling efficacy of a cOFM probe. Nevertheless, the in vitro RR can be of use to assess the degree of unspecific adsorption of compounds to the surface of the cOFM system. As a consequence, in vitro adsorption experiments are usually performed to optimize the perfusate composition, the setup, and the sampling regimen in order to reduce adsorption effects. Here, we corrected the measured OCR concentrations with the in vivo RR of the respective cOFM probe and, additionally, we performed in vitro tests prior to the cOFM sampling to assess adsorption of the antibodies (OCR and mIgG1) to cOFM system components to be used in the in vivo study. In the present study, we optimized the perfusate composition by adding 0.2% BSA to reduce the adsorption of the antibodies to the cOFM material. In agreement with the results from Custers et al. [8] we did not observe any adsorption of the antibodies to the cOFM system when using this optimized perfusate. For absolute quantification of an analyte in tissue after ISF sampling, different quantification protocols in combination with the sampling procedure are available [17,27\u201331]. The protocol of choice is determined by the properties of the analytes, e.g., molecular size, charge, diffusion, or PK properties. Because of the slow overall clearance and the slow diffusion of therapeutic antibodies in the ISF, zero flow rate was used as a quantification protocol in the cOFM study conducted here. Zero flow rate in combination with cOFM has also been applied previously [9]. However, in contrast to Le Prieult et al. [9], we calculated the resulting antibody concentrations based on the theoretical framework developed by Bungay et al. and Chen et al. [17,18].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1880 11 of 14\nOur PK data revealed a rather low elimination of OCR from brain ISF (ke = 0.006/h) which is in agreement with results from other IgG monoclonal antibodies like trastuzumab [7,9,32]. Interestingly, the half-life of OCR in brain ISF exceeded the half-life of OCR in plasma. This has also been observed by Chang et al. [7] when investigating the humanized antibody trastuzumab. However, it is not clear yet if or why the antibodies accumulate in brain ISF. Different parameters affect the distribution and elimination of monoclonal antibodies such as the mode of action (e.g., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity), the affinity of the antibody to different Fc-receptors (e.g., neonatal Fc-receptor or Fc-gamma receptor), the overall charge of the antibody molecule, the glycosylation pattern, or the route of administration (e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous) [33\u201335]. The onset of OCR in brain ISF was early (within the first four hours post dose) in our study, which is in good agreement with results obtained for the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab [7,9]. At the end of our cOFM PK study (at t = 96 h post dose), the in vivo RR-corrected OCR concentration in cerebral ISF matched the OCR concentration in the brain tissue, which is also well in line with recent cOFM data, but in contrast to results from previous MD studies [7,9]. Chang et al. [7] have applied the in vitro RR to correct the values derived from MD ISF samples. However, we assume that this could have led to an overestimation of the RR value, which resulted in an antibody concentration in ISF that was even higher than the total concentration of the antibody in the brain. The OCR concentrations we found in CSF were lower than those derived from brain ISF which is consistent with results from Le Prieult et al. [9] who, like us, have collected CSF samples by puncturing the cisterna magna. In contrast to that, Chang et al. have collected the CSF from both lateral ventricle and cisterna magna samples with MD probes [7]. They then corrected the CSF concentrations from the dialysate of the MD probes with the in vitro RR, and the resulting antibody concentrations in the CSF from the lateral ventricle and cisterna magna were higher than the antibody concentrations in the brain tissue homogenate. Again, it must be noted that correction by the in vitro RR might have led to an overestimation of the actual concentration values. The uncorrected cOFM values reported by Le Prieult et al. [9] were close to the concentration in brain tissue, but still below them [9], which is in line with our data. However, Le Prieult et al. [9] have used a lower sampling flow rate than we have (0.3 \u00b5L/min versus 0.5 \u00b5L/min). This lower flow rate leads to a higher in vivo RR when referring to Bungay et al. [17], which might explain the better correlation of the uncorrected cOFM concentration values to the brain homogenate concentration values. The validity of brain ISF data strongly depends on the actual status of the BBB integrity for the substance of interest during data acquisition. In clinical practice, BBB integrity is routinely assessed with magnetic resonance imaging in combination with contrast agents (e.g., low-molecular-weight gadolinium-based contrast agents). However, because the BBB integrity is a dynamic and size-dependent state, monitoring it with a low-molecularweight contrast agent is of limited value when assessing the PK of a high-molecular-weight molecule such as a therapeutic antibody in the brain. In this study, the BBB integrity status was continuously monitored throughout the entire PK profile recording with mIgG1 as a marker molecule for the first time. Endogenous mIgGs are well suited as marker substances when sampling therapeutic mAbs, as they are the most abundant antibodies in the blood of mice. Further, they have similar size and physical properties as mAbs as the majority of the therapeutic mAbs are based on human IgGs. Among the four IgG subtypes, IgG1 is the most prominent subtype with around 60% of total IgG concentration. The endogenous IgG1 concentration in plasma is generally stable and variations from the normal state of BBB integrity are indicated by elevated levels in brain tissue [36]. Until now, endogenous IgG has only been used for post hoc BBB integrity status assessment in immuno-histochemical studies, but it has never been collected from brain ISF by a cOFM probe to continuously assess BBB integrity [8]. In addition to indicating the integrity status of the BBB, endogenous IgG levels can also be used to indicate the\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1880 12 of 14\nfunctional status of the cOFM probe as abnormally low IgG levels in cOFM samples could reflect a malfunction of the cOFM probe. The endogenous mIgG1 levels in our cOFM samples were stable throughout the sampling procedure, showing that the BBB integrity was not altered by the perfusion of the cOFM probe with the perfusate throughout the study and, further, that the cOFM probes were functioning properly. The former is in agreement with findings from Custers et al. [8], who have compared perfused versus non-perfused cOFM probes regarding BBB integrity by staining endogenous mIgG in brain slices. Their results have indicated that the BBB integrity is not affected by the perfusion of the cOFM probe 16 days after probe insertion. However, they have assessed the BBB integrity only at one single time point in the experiment and could therefore not draw any conclusions about the integrity status of the BBB during sampling [8]. In conclusion, cOFM enabled direct and absolute quantification of a therapeutic antibody (OCR) in brain ISF, and time-resolved, stable sampling allowed the recording of the antibody\u2019s PK profile for a period of 96 h. Moreover, the BBB remained intact for a large molecule while recording OCR\u2019s brain PK profile over this prolonged duration. This study provides evidence that cOFM can perform reliable PK assessment of therapeutic antibodies in brain ISF, delivering reliable and easily interpretable data for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and thereby promoting the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to treat neurological diseases.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.A.-K.; methodology, T.A.-K., J.H., R.R. and D.K.; validation, R.R. and D.K.; data curation, T.A.-K., J.H., B.B. and T.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.A.-K. and B.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.B.; visualization, T.A.-K. and B.B.; supervision, T.B.; project administration, T.A.-K.
