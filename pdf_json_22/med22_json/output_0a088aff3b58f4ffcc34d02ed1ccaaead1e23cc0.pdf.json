Therefore, this study was conducted with an objective of evaluating the impact of irrigation and nitrogen levels on growth attributes and nitrogen use efficiency of Bt cotton (Gossypium spp.) in the hot arid region. The experiment consisted of a factorial arrangement of three irrigation levels (200, 400, and 600 mm) and four nitrogen rates (0, 75, 150, and 225 kg ha\u22121) in a split-plot design with three replications. Nitrogen fertilization and irrigation levels influenced cotton growth attributes and yield. The highest leaf area index, dry matter accumulation, crop growth rate, and relative growth rate were achieved at 225 kg N ha\u22121 and irrigation level 600 mm as compared to other experimental treatments. Similarly, nitrogen uptake and content by seed, lint, and stalk and total nitrogen uptake recorded maximum at 225 kg N ha\u22121\nand irrigation level 600 mm. Interestingly, the treatment of 600 mm of irrigation and 150 kg N ha\u22121 displayed significant increase in nitrogen use efficiency indices such as agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEN) and recovery efficiency of nitrogen (REN), while partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN) and internal nitrogen use efficiency (iNUE) were significantly higher with application of 600 mm of irrigation and nitrogen application rate of 75 kg ha\u22121. Application of 600 mm of irrigation along with 225 kg N ha\u22121 resulted in significant increase in gross return, net return, and B:C ratio than any other treatment combinations. So, application of 600 mm of irrigation along with 225 kg N ha\u22121 could be recommended for achieving higher growth and yield, as well as profitability of Bt cotton under hot arid region and similar agroecologies.\nKeywords: irrigation, sustainability, nitrogen implantation dosage, cotton, nitrogen use efficiency\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 1 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 890181"

            "text": "Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is India\u2019s leading fiber cash crop, accounting for 85% of the textile industry\u2019s raw materials. India is the world\u2019s leading cotton cultivator and producer, trailing only China. Cotton is grown on 129.57 lac ha in India, with a production and productivity of 371.0 lac bales and 486.76 kg ha\u22121, respectively, which is lower than the global average (Mahadevappa et al., 2018). The poor growth and productivity of Bt cotton can be attributed to a number of reasons, including untimely rain, late and early onset of monsoon, improper water management, improper sowing time, and imbalanced use of fertilizers (Ramasundaram and Gajbhiye, 2001). Among these factors, availability of water is the major factor as more than 50% of cotton is growing under rainfed condition, where low and erratic rainfalls affect the cotton growth and ultimately affect the productivity. Cotton is a semi-xerophyte and forced annual crop. Its vegetative growth and duration are linearly related to water supply and fertilization over a wide input range. However, harvest index is higher at lower water supplies. Thus, a greater proportion of total biomass is proportioned to reproductive structures as water stress is increased. This underlying principle entails that cotton needs only lifesaving irrigation to circumvent severe stress at the critical boll development stage (Wang et al., 2018). Similarly, inherent poor soil fertility, particularly soils low in N content and micronutrients, is a major factor responsible for the low productivity of cotton in arid and semi-arid environment (Wang et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2021a). Limited soil water availability during important growth periods such as flowering and boll production can result in fewer bolls, boll shedding, and underdeveloped bolls. As a result, irrigation is the main factor in ensuring Bt cotton\u2019s long-term growth and productivity because efficient water use through a well-managed irrigation plan is critical for crop output, especially in light of deteriorating land and water availability per capita (Mahmood et al., 2021).\nNitrogen (N) plays a prominent role in the plant metabolic system (Shah et al., 2017, 2021b). Nitrogen is a principal component of many organic compounds (proteins, nucleic acids, alkaloids, and enzymes) and is also associated with energy transfer molecules such as ADP and ATP. It consists of 16% of total protein biomass present in plants (Ahmad et al., 2022). N is also found in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which play an important role in plant genetics and heredity. It is also a component of chlorophyll, which serves as a photosynthesis factory. N has also major role in photosynthetic processes, leaf area production, leaf area duration, as well as net assimilation rate that are directly related to yield enhancement (Leghari et al., 2016). More than half of the world\u2019s population is fed by crops cultivated using synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers, which were made feasible by the advent of the Haber\u2013Bosch process in the early twentieth century, which converts atmospheric nitrogen gas (N2) to active forms of nitrogen. Total global consumption of N fertilizer was 112.5 million tons in 2015, 118.2 million tons in 2019, and likely to reach 7.9\u201310.5 billion tons by 2050 (Zhang X. et al., 2015). The demand of huge amount of N fertilizers is a major concern for farmers as it increases the cost of cultivation and also degrades the inherent fertility of\nsoil. Consequently, the use of excess N fertilizers causes the problem of N pollution, which is now considered as new threat for environmental sustainability (Kanter et al., 2020). It has been documented that the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) value is decreased with the application of N fertilizers. For instance, in developed countries, NUE increased because of adaption of best agronomical and fertilizer management practices and reduced in developing countries such as India as the use of N fertilizer dramatically increased (Heffer and Prud\u2019homme, 2016). It was reported that the world average NUE was nearly 47 and 42% in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and the major reason behind the NUE decreasing is adoption of agronomical practices (nutrient management and varieties) associated with low NUE (Yousaf et al., 2014, 2016, 2021; Zhang Y. et al., 2015).\nDifferent levels of water and fertilizers have significant combined effects on yield, crop growth, and water productivity (Javed et al., 2022). The seed cotton yield has been shown to increase with an increase in N from 0 to 200 kg ha\u22121 under a high water supply. However, the seed cotton yield was found to first increase and then decrease with a lower water supply (Singh et al., 2010). Under fertigation, the water-use efficiency (WUE) decreased with a reduction in the amount of applied N and dense paired sowing resulted in higher seed cotton yield and WUE than normal sowing (Shah et al., 2021a). Cotton plants begin to take more nutrients on the 30th day after emergence, shortly after the start of flower budding, and achieve their daily maximum absorption during the flowering phase, 60\u201390 days following germination. Even in modern cotton production systems, where the crop is grown as an annual, there are phenological periods wherein vegetative growth and fruit development occur simultaneously. This behavior presents a problem for crop management in terms of maximizing nutrient uptake and ensuring an appropriate supply of water to allow the vegetative and reproductive parts of the crop to grow at the same time (Constable and Bange, 2015). As a result, this study was carried out to see how water and nitrogen levels affected cotton in Rajasthan\u2019s desert climate. The purpose of this study was also to determine how different quantities of water and nitrogen effect cotton development, nutrient absorption, and economics."

The root system and leaf photosystem, on the other hand, work together to promote plant growth and development (Kapoor et al., 2020).

The lower amount of irrigation had the lowest LAI and dry matter accumulation because it failed to maintain the ideal soil moisture, which may have inhibited cell elongation, as well as limited photosynthesis and carbohydrate synthesis (Dadgale et al., 2014). In addition, water is the key limiting factor that can regulate cell growth and metabolism, which ultimately affect the crop growth and development, possibly due to this lower irrigation (200 mm) resulted in lower LAI (Farooq et al., 2022) and dry matter accumulation (Farooq et al., 2021). The crop and relative growth rate increased with increasing quantity of dry matter because both of these parameters are highly dependent on crop dry matter. The appropriate soil moisture state, along with adequate irrigation with 600 mm may have contributed to higher nutrient uptake, supporting crop growth and development, as well as a good influence on dry matter, resulting in an increase in cotton crop and relative growth rate (Bhunia, 2007; Ahlawat and Gangaiah, 2010). The better moisture absorption by roots along with nutrients under irrigation level 600 mm could have increase the photosynthesis and enabled the crop to capture a greater amount of radiant energy, which boosted photosynthate translocation to the growth portions, resulting in increased cell elongation and a greater number of branches per plant (Hussein et al., 2011; Dadgale et al., 2014; Mahadevappa et al., 2018; Meena H. et al., 2018).\nNitrogen increases the leaf area and leaf area index (LAI), promotes the synthesis of proteins involved in cell development, cell proliferation, and the development of the cell wall and cytoskeleton (Luo et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). The rise in LAI with enhancing nitrogen levels from 0 to 225 kg ha\u22121 could be attributable to nitrogen\u2019s beneficial influence on cotton growth, development, and vegetative components (Gundlur et al., 2013). Increased nitrogen intake resulted in more vegetative growth than reproductive growth. The LAI fell as nitrogen levels were reduced because these treatments failed to fulfill the assimilate needs of the growing sections, resulting in reduced leaf area (Norton and Silvertooth, 2007; Munir et al., 2015).\nThe favorable effect of nitrogen on cotton growth and development may be explained by the increase in dry matter accumulation with increasing nitrogen levels (Gundlur et al., 2013). According to a previous study, a sufficient supply of\nValues marked by at least a common small letter do not differ significantly for main effects of nitrogen and irrigation treatments according to LSD test (p = 0.05). Values marked by at least a common capital letter do not differ significantly for interaction effect of nitrogen and irrigation treatments according to LSD test (p = 0.05).\nnitrogen in the right quantity can promote cell elongation, resulting in greater vegetative growth and more cotton dry matter (Sunitha et al., 2010). However, lower nitrogen levels resulted in lower dry matter accumulation because an insufficient supply of nitrogen from the soil (which was low in available nitrogen) might have inhibited cell elongation, which suppressed plant vegetative growth, resulting in lower dry matter under these conditions as compared to higher nitrogen levels (Reddy et al., 2004; Munir et al., 2015).\nCotton is an indeterminate crop with a lengthy growing season, thus timely nitrogen supply under split application may have increased plant\u22121 DMA, leading to a higher yield and relative growth rate of cotton, which are dependent on plant dry matter accumulation (Giri et al., 2014). The increase in number of branches plant\u22121 might be attributed to nitrogen fertilization because nitrogen is responsible for increasing leaf area index,\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 890181\nwhich enables the plants to produce more branches (Saleem et al., 2010; Ali and Hameed, 2011; Main et al., 2014).\nThe nitrogen concentration in seed, lint, and stalk, as well as their uptake by these parts, was dramatically affected by irrigation levels. The nitrogen intake of a crop is determined by the plant\u2019s nitrogen concentration and yield. The increase in total nitrogen intake seen in this study is due to a considerable rise in both the content and yield of cotton with increased irrigation (Yadav and Chauhan, 2016). Higher irrigation levels were also associated with higher nitrogen use efficiency indices, which could be because increased water availability increased nitrogen availability through enhanced mineralization, as well as improved mobility of nitrogen to the root surface, resulting in an increased uptake and concentration in plants (Saini, 2017).\nCotton\u2019s nitrogen content and absorption improved as nitrogen fertilization increased. With N 225 kg ha\u22121, the highest nitrogen content in lint was discovered, as well as its uptake by all the plant components individually and the plant as a whole. Higher nitrogen application rates to the soil may have increased nitrogen availability to Bt cotton plants, resulting in increased LAI development and ultimately photosynthates generation. As a result of the increased demand for nitrogen, more nitrogen was taken up from the soil and accumulated in various plant parts, resulting in higher nitrogen concentrations in plant sections. Higher nitrogen intake was the result of higher yield combined with higher nitrogen content in plant sections. Increased seed index and seed production, as well as a higher level of nitrogen fertilization, have resulted in a higher N concentration in seed (Boquet and Breitenbeck, 2000; Bhalerao et al., 2011).\nThe nitrogen use efficiency (AEN, PEN, and REN) improved until it reached 150 kg N ha\u22121, then dropped as nitrogen application increased. This could be attributed to the fact that increasing nitrogen doses beyond 150 kg ha\u22121 failed to result in a proportionate rise in seed cotton production. Cotton had the highest nitrogen use efficiency when nitrogen was administered at 150 kg ha\u22121 because increased nitrogen levels resulted in a balanced increase in vegetative and reproductive components, resulting in better seed cotton yields (Fritschi et al., 2003). High nitrogen application (225 kg ha\u22121), on the other hand, can shift the balance in favor of vegetative growth, delaying crop maturity, and diminishing cotton yield. The decreased AEN with greater doses of N was attributed to the fact that the rise in seed cotton production was not proportional to the N application rate and uptake (Aujla et al., 2005; Gangaiah et al., 2013; Yadav and Chauhan, 2016).\nWith an increase in irrigation levels, the water productivity gradually declined. Water productivity was highest when 200 mm irrigation was used, followed by 400 and 600 mm irrigation levels. The impact of irrigation levels on water productivity differs from the influence on yield, which grew as irrigation levels climbed. The decrease in water productivity seen in this study is explained by the significantly smaller gain in yield compared to the amount of irrigation administered with an increase in irrigation levels (Nalayini et al., 2006; Pawar et al., 2013).\nIt was observed that water productivity enhanced as nitrogen rates increased. Increased leaf area leads to a reduction in the\nevaporation component of evapotranspiration, a lesser increase in evapotranspiration compared to yield and better usage of available soil water, as demonstrated in this study. The findings are in line with previous study, which showed that adding nitrogen to a nitrogen-deficient soil boosted water productivity when water was available (Yadav and Chauhan, 2016).\nIrrigation enhanced the net return and B:C ratio substantially. In comparison to irrigation at 200 mm, irrigation at 600 mm yielded an additional net return of $493 ha\u22121 and B:C ratio of 0.57. This rise was mostly owing to a comparatively higher economic yield with a lower added cost under this treatment, which resulted in higher returns.\nIrrigation and nitrogen levels influenced dry matter aggregation at harvest, number of branches plant\u22121, total nitrogen intake, nitrogen use efficiency, irrigation water productivity, and economics of Bt cotton. In compared to all the other factors, in general, 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg ha\u22121 nitrogen rate greatly enhanced these metrics. These results can be explained by an undersea shortage, which indicated that the N was not assimilated at the rate required for optimal growth. Despite the fact that it was administered, it was hypothesized that N was lost due to volatilization. Furthermore, due to the silty clayey soils, some nitrogen was allegedly lost through leaching. Decreased N dosages sprayed in coverage lead to decreased productivity, regardless of irrigation level (Aujla et al., 2005). The amount of water in the soil under optimal conditions is critical for plant N uptake. To avoid waste of inputs, proper water management is required. Cotton yield response to increased irrigation levels was linear for all the N levels employed in the water treatments (Singh et al., 2010)."

However, its performance in terms of growth attributes and profitability indices such as net return and B:C ratio was inferior to irrigation 600 mm with 150 kg N ha\u22121. So, application of 600 mm of irrigation along with 225 kg N ha\u22121 could be recommended for achieving higher growth and yield, as well as profitability of Bt cotton under hot arid region of Rajasthan and similar agroecologies."
