Exploration of Other Plant Extracts for SNP Synthesis: Investigate the synthesis of sulfur nanoparticles using extracts from other citrus or non-citrus plants. This could help understand the influence of different bioactive compounds on the properties and effectiveness of the synthesized nanoparticles, potentially identifying plants that yield SNPs with even greater antimicrobial and wound healing capabilities.

Mechanistic Studies on the Antimicrobial and Antifungal Actions of SNPs: While this study demonstrates the efficacy of SNPs against various microbial strains, detailed mechanistic studies are needed. These studies could focus on understanding how SNPs interact with microbial cell walls, penetrate cells, and induce cell death. Advanced techniques like transcriptomics or proteomics could reveal the changes in gene or protein expression in microbes upon SNP treatment.

Long-term Stability and Efficacy Evaluation of SNP-embedded Nanohydrogels: Although the current study shows promising results for the application of SNPs in nanohydrogel formulations for wound healing, long-term stability and efficacy studies are crucial. These studies would assess the shelf-life of these formulations and evaluate their healing efficiency over extended periods and under various storage conditions.

Scale-up and Industrial Viability Studies: With promising results at the laboratory scale, future research should focus on the scalability of the synthesis process for SNPs and their incorporation into nanohydrogels or other delivery systems. This would involve optimizing production processes, assessing the cost-effectiveness, and ensuring the quality and consistency of the nanoparticles for potential industrial-scale applications in healthcare and medicine.

Clinical Trials for Medical Applications: The ultimate goal of developing these SNPs and their formulations is their application in human health. Future research should aim at conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SNP-based treatments in humans. This could include not only wound healing applications but also exploring their use in treating microbial infections, as a component in antimicrobial coatings for medical devices, or even in targeted drug delivery systems.
