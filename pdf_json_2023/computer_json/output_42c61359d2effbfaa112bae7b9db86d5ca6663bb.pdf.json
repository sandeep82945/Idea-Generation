With consumers upgrading devices such as cellphones every year, manufacturing carbon is becoming significant in comparison to the carbon footprint of daily usage.

Taking on the sustainability challenge, IEEE Micro presents in the first issue of 2023 several articles relevant to environmentally sustainable computing. CaroleJean Wu of Meta AI guest edited the Special Issue on Environmentally Sustainable Computing that yielded three articles. Several interesting topics appear in these articles.

The article on design space of hardware posits that graphics processing units may be less sustainable than emerging in-memory processing technologies for artificial intelligence processing at the edge. Read the guest editorial written byCarole-JeanWu to understand more about the community undertakings on environmentally sustainable computing and specifically about the three chosen articles. In addition, we also selected a few articles from the 2022 Cool Chips conference, a conference focusing on low power designs. The Cool Chips conference has been taking place in Japan every year since 1998. Several industry and academic researchers present their work on powerand energy-efficient computing at the Cool Chips conference annually, and we have included a few selected articles from Cool Chips 2022 here in this issue. These articles very appropriately enrich the environmental sustainability theme. Ryusuke Egawa of Tokyo Denki University and Yasutaka Wada of Meisei University, Japan guest edited the Special Issue on Cool Chips. Out of the 12 presentations at the Cool Chips conference, they selected a few for submitting written articles to IEEE Micro. After a review process, two articles were selected for inclusion in this issue. In the first article, \u201cTCN-CUTIE: A 1,036-TOp/s/W, 2.72-mJ/Inference, 12.2-mW All-Digital Ternary Accelerator in 22-nm FDX Technology,\u201d Scherer el al. describe a flexible, fully digital ternary neural network accelerator in a RISCV-based system-on-chip. In the second article, \u201cA Scalable Body Bias Optimization Method Toward Low-Power CGRAs,\u201d Kojima et al. explore fine body bias control considering the power and area overhead of an on-chip body bias generator and present design options that save 66% of energy consumption. Read the guest editorial written by Egawa and Wada, which provides a short description of the two articles selected for the Special Issue on Cool Chips. These articles are followed by two papers on contemporary commercial products. The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) has started the tradition of including a special industry session, and IEEE Micro selected two articles from the submissions for inclusion in this Issue. Lisa Hsu of Microsoft, who was the program chair for the ISCA 2022 industry session, coordinated the Special Issue on Commercial Products. In the first commercial products article, \u201cEnterprise-Class Multilevel Cache Design: Low Latency, Huge Capacity, and High Reliability,\u201d Berger et al. from IBM describe the innovative cache architecture of the IBM z series Telum Processor.

Lisa Hsu of Microsoft, who was the program chair for the ISCA 2022 industry session, coordinated the Special Issue on Commercial Products.\nIn the first commercial products article, \u201cEnterprise-Class Multilevel Cache Design: Low Latency, Huge Capacity, and High Reliability,\u201d Berger et al. from IBM describe the innovative cache architecture of the IBM z series Telum Processor. The article focuses on the innovations to provide low latency, large capacity, and reliable L2 caching, in this 8 core processor with semiprivate L2 caches.

By supporting offloading of general messaging libraries for processing, sending, and receiving on-node and off-node messages, AME enables truly asynchronous progress to overlap computation and communication of multicores. AME is a tiny but fully programmable 64-bit processing engine, optimized for communication. AME design goals include small size and low power, with a purpose-built instruction set, but relatively low instructions per cycle.\nWHILE PROGRESS IN COMPUTING HAS ENHANCED EVERYDAY HUMAN LIVES, IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPUTING STAYS ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE.\nThis issue also contains a general interest feature article, \u201cRDMA Congestion Control: It Is Only for the Compliant,\u201d by Snyder et al. of Duke University. Remote direct memory access (RDMA) enables offlocating of networking tasks to hardware and allows applications to communicate without invoking system software on the data path. The authors describe how RDMA generally enables low latency and low CPU utilization, but points to performance isolation concerns in a shared cloud environment. For example, congestion control algorithms can render the network vulnerable to performance hacking attacks, which give the attacker extra bandwidth in the network. The authors illustrate the need for incorporating performance isolation into the design and evaluation of congestion control algorithms.\nIn addition to the aforementioned eight papers, this Issue features an article from our Micro Law columnist Joshua Yi, titled \u201cDoes Academic Research Drive Industrial Innovation in Computer Architecture?\u2014Analyzing Citations to Academic Papers in Patents.\u201d Yi examines the number of\ncitations to articles published in top computer architecture conferences, such as Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating System (ASPLOS), High Performance Computer Architecture, ISCA, and International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO). Read the entire article to find interesting tidbits, for example, the fact that even though ISCA started after MICRO, ISCA papers had 130 patent citations to conferences held between 1973 and 1990 while MICRO only had four citations to proceedings during that timeframe. Other observations include that one paper in the first ISCA (ISCA 1973), \u201cDAP\u2014A Distributed Array Processor\u201d authored by Stewart F. Reddaway, was cited 51 times. Also noted is that an ASPLOS 2000 paper \u201cOceanStore: An Architecture for GlobalScale Persistent Storage\u201d by John Kubiatowicz et al. was cited 1,070 times.\nIn addition, this issue also features a Micro Economics column by Shane Greenstein of Harvard Business School titled, \u201cThe Modern Digital Operating Model.\u201d Electronic commerce relies on understanding customer arrival patterns, their browsing behavior, and the path to a purchase. Measurement of such data helps decision making from the business side. Greenstein describes the types of experimentation and learning that businesses conduct in order to understand and design the path to commercial success. Digital record keeping, electronic communications, analytical methods, experimentation, measurement, and iterative improvement are all pieces of the modern digital enterprise, and Greenstein discusses the crucial elements of the modern digital operating model, such as what should go into a checklist.\nI take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our guest editors Drs. Wu, Egawa, Wada, and Hsu for proposing and editing their special issues. I am sure that readers will enjoy these articles and will benefit from them.\nMore than 50 cities in China, the United States, Philippines, South Korea, Canada, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom boast of the availability of 5G communications in 2022. Major U.S. carriers, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, have all launched versions of 5G broadly enough to tout the claim of nationwide service in the United States. Data and videos are exchanged and communicated at high speeds; more and more computing can be done at fingertips wherever you are. This certainly is a time to wonder\u2014Are our computing trends environmentally sustainable? The awareness created by this special issue hopefully leads to action on solving\nJanuary/February 2023 IEEE Micro 5\nenvironmental and sustainability problems while at the same time keeping economic growth.
