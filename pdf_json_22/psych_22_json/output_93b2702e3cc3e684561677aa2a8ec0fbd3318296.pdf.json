    "abstractText": "The aims of this study were to explore the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to distinguish which type of psychological guidance they demanded and to investigate the related factors that could be associated with the need for psychological counseling. A total of 112 eligible patients diagnosed with stage I\u2013IV breast cancer who had received surgery were included. The self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), cancer fatigue scale (CFS), and survey for the need for psychological counseling were completed for all subjects prior to radiotherapy. A total of 8.9% and 3.6% of patients suffered from depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 62.5%. Only 12.5% of the patients needed psychological counseling, especially for the type of tumor diagnosis and treatment rather than COVID-19-related protection. The higher the total CFS score was, the lower the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients during this pandemic (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84\u20130.98). Patients who received 7\u20138 chemotherapeutic cycles had 6.7 times the risk of needing psychological counseling when compared with those who received 1\u20136 chemotherapeutic cycles. Fewer breast cancer patients suffered from depression and anxiety before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a large number of patients complained of sleep disturbance and fatigue. The majority of patients did not need psychological counseling. More chemotherapeutic cycles or less fatigue could increase their risk of needing psychological counseling, especially for tumor diagnosis and treatment, but not COVID-19related protection.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared an outbreak by the WHO and rapidly spread worldwide (WHO, 2020). Thus far, more than 618 million people have been diagnosed, and the cumulative number of deaths has exceeded 6 million (WHO, 2022). For fear of contracting viruses, economic pressures and measures of lockdown or social distancing, a growing amount of evidence suggests that the general population experiences higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress (Salari et\u00a0al., 2020).\nDelays or changes in treatment regimens due to this emergency could increase their concern about the impact on their cancer outcome (Yang et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, cancer patients are at great risk of developing clinical levels of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic (Miaskowski et\u00a0 al., 2020; Ng et\u00a0 al., 2020; Albano et\u00a0 al., 2021; Gallagher et\u00a0 al., 2021). Even if there is no COVID-19, the prevalence of psychological distress, sleep disturbance, and fatigue is higher in oncology patients than in the general population (Cao et\u00a0al., 2017). Recent studies showed that 41.7% of breast cancer patients reported insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 16.7% and 44.4% of patients complained of clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety, respectively (Massicotte et\u00a0al., 2021). In the high levels of cancer-related and COVID-19 stress group cancer patients, the occurrence rates of sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and evening fatigue were 78.0%, 78.0%, 71.2%, and 55.9%, respectively (Miaskowski et\u00a0al., 2020). These symptom burdens, in turn, may increase a patient\u2019s fear or cause fright and decrease the patient\u2019s quality of life.\nAlthough breast cancer patients could experience higher levels of psychological distress, sleep disturbance, and fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic (Swainston et\u00a0al., 2020; Chen et\u00a0al., 2021; Massicotte et\u00a0al., 2021), one previous study showed that only 1.6% of cancer patients were seeking psychological help during this pandemic (Wang et\u00a0al., 2020). It is not clear whether these patients need psychological counseling or what type of psychological guidance these patients need. A limited number of studies have focused on these problems.\nTherefore, the aims of this study were to explore the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and to distinguish which type of psychological guidance they needed. This study also aimed to investigate the related factors that could be\u00a0associated with the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients during this pandemic."

            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be\u00a0 an extremely stressful event that could result in increased\npsychological symptoms, sleep disturbance, and fatigue in cancer patients. Findings from this study suggested that fewer breast cancer patients suffered from depression and anxiety before radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, nearly two-thirds of patients reported sleep disturbance. Only 12.5% of patients (higher depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and fatigue) expressed their need for psychological counseling, especially for the type of tumor diagnosis and treatment. Patients who receive more chemotherapeutic cycles (7\u20138 cycles) could have an increased risk of needing psychological counseling, while patients with higher total CFS scores have less need for psychological counseling.\nStudies have shown that patients with breast cancer are at great risk of suffering from depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021; Kim and Kim, 2021; Massicotte et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, this finding contradicts the finding from our study that fewer breast cancer patients suffered from these psychological symptoms during that time. Only 8.9% and 3.6% of patients suffered from depression and anxiety, respectively. One reason for the inconsistent results could be\u00a0 associated with the different survey times between these studies. This study was conducted from April 2020 to August 2020\u00a0 in China. The COVID-19 pandemic has been almost completely controlled during this time. However, other studies have performed investigations during disease outbreaks and epidemics. The depression and anxiety of patients could be\u00a0alleviated with the outbreak under control. Unlike depression and anxiety, 62.5% of patients complained of sleep disturbance in this study. Our result is higher than those of previous studies in which the prevalence of insomnia ranged from 21.6% to 41.7% (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021; Massicotte et\u00a0al., 2021). There was evidence that 78% of cancer patients reported sleep disturbance in the stressed group, and the occurrence rate for evening fatigue was 55.9% (Miaskowski et\u00a0al., 2020). The high prevalence of sleep disturbance could be\u00a0associated with high levels of cancer-related stress and COVID-19. However, another study showed that young adult cancer survivors had less insomnia severity during the pandemic (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFor different degrees of fear about infecting COVID-19 and the impact on cancer care by this epidemic, providing psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic could relieve patients\u2019 depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and fatigue. However, in this study, only 12.5% of the patients needed psychological counseling. There was a study similar to ours in which only 1.6% of cancer patients sought psychological counseling during this time (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2020). Findings explored in patients with colorectal cancer showed that the majority thought they did not need support (including mental health) during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kamposioras et\u00a0al., 2021). However, our result is lower than that of a previous study that investigated cancer patients and their relatives in Wuhan, in which 40.2% of the subjects needed psychosocial support during this period (Yang et\u00a0al., 2021). One reason for the higher need for psychological counseling in that study\nTABLE\u00a02 The scores and the prevalence of depression, anxiety, sleep, and fatigue in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic."

Another reason could be\u00a0 the different types of cancer patients between the two studies. Their study included patients with other cancers. Our study also suggested that breast cancer patients who receive more chemotherapeutic cycles could have an increased risk of needing psychological counseling. There is evidence that breast cancer patients with more cycles of chemotherapy have worse sleep and more depressive symptoms compared to baseline levels (Ancoli-Israel et\u00a0 al., 2014). These increased depressive symptoms and worse sleep could increase their need for psychological counseling. In turn, the findings from our study also showed that patients who needed psychological counseling reported significantly higher depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and fatigue than those who did not need psychological counseling. An interesting finding also found in this study was that the higher the total CFS score was, the lower the need for psychological counseling in breast cancer patients during this pandemic. The exact reason for this\ncorrelation is unclear. Additional study is needed to elucidate the relationship between fatigue and the need for psychological counseling.\nRegarding the type of psychological counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of breast cancer patients (who needed psychological counseling) preferred psychological counseling for tumor diagnosis and treatment, while 14.3% of patients preferred psychological counseling for COVID-19-related protection. A previous study investigated patients with gynecological cancer and showed that only 17.5% of the patients were more worried about COVID-19 than about their cancer disease (Gultekin et\u00a0al., 2021). This result is similar to our finding. Compared to COVID-19, most patients were likely to adhere to the schedules of oncology treatment and surveillance. They were more concerned about whether their treatment plan was delayed or changed and whether the cancer disease would recur or metastasize. These factors could be\u00a0 associated with an increase in psychological distress (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021; Kim and Kim, 2021) and, in turn, could increase their need for psychological counseling."
