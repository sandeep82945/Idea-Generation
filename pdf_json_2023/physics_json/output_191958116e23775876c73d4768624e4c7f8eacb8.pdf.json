    "abstractText": "The present study involves the synthesis of photocatalytic composite nanofibers (NFs) comprising ilmenite nickel titanite-supported carbon nanofibers (NiTiO3/TiO2@CNFs) using an electrospinning process. The photocatalytic composite NFs obtained were utilized in hydrogen (H2) production from the photohydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB). The experimental findings show that the photocatalytic composite NFs with a loading of 25 mg had a good catalytic performance for H2 generation, producing the stoichiometric H2 in 11 min using 1 mmol AB under visible light at 25 \u25e6C and 1000 rpm. The increase in catalyst load to 50, 75, and 100 mg leads to a corresponding reduction in the reaction time to 7, 5, and 4 min. The findings from the kinetics investigations suggest that the rate of the photohydrolysis reaction is directly proportional to the amount of catalyst in the reaction system, adhering to a first-order reaction rate. Furthermore, it was observed that the reaction rate remains unaffected by the concentration of AB, thereby suggesting a reaction of zero order. Increasing the reaction temperature results in a decrease in the duration of the photohydrolysis reaction. Furthermore, an estimated activation energy value of 35.19 kJ mol\u22121 was obtained. The composite nanofibers demonstrated remarkable and consistent effectiveness throughout five consecutive cycles. The results suggest that composite NFs possess the capacity to function as a feasible substitute for costly catalysts in the process of H2 generation from AB.",

The use of a H2 economy in our day-to-day lives is still meeting a great number of challenges, the foremost of which is the storage of H2 [4,5]. A possibility is to store H2 in the form of solid-state H2 storage, which relies on either physical or chemical interactions between H2 and storage materials [6,7]. Among these, amine-borane stands out as an effective hydrogen storage material because it satisfies a number of requirements set by the United States Department of Energy (DOE): (a) possessing a significant amount\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3262. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15153262 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3262 2 of 12\nof hydrogen, (b) stability, and (c) eco-friendliness [8,9]. Ammonia borane (NH3BH3) is the most basic form of the amine-borane compounds that is being studied for its potential use in solid hydrogen storage material due to its high (19.6 wt.%) hydrogen content [10,11]. Hydrogen produced by the photocatalytic hydrolysis of AB with the help of light has attracted a lot of attention because it is a promising clean, efficient, and infinite energy source [11,12]. Ayman et al. published the first proof of AB photohydrolysis in 2012 [13]. Since then, several studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of various photocatalytic substances in generating hydrogen from AB [14\u201316]. The photohydrolysis method can produce gravimetric hydrogen capacity in AB, which is comparable to what happens during normal hydrolysis; however, radiation from light could be able to restrict the generation of ammonia [17]. Various metal- and non-metal-supported TiO2 have been used as efficient photocatalysts for the production of H2 from the photohydrolysis of AB [14,17\u201322]. Over the last several years, ilmenite has been developed as an effective visible-light-driven photocatalyst [23\u201326]. Because of its adequate bandgap and capacity to absorb solar radiation, nickel titanate (NiTiO3, Eg~2.18 eV) has been identified as a suitable photocatalytic material for various reactions [27]. Huang et al. [28] produced NiTiO3/TiO2 nanotubes and used them to produce H2 by photosplitting. The fabricated NiTiO3/TiO2 showed promising photocatalytic performance with H2 generation rates of 45 and 680 mol g\u22121 h\u22121 for TiO2 and NiTiO3/TiO2, respectively. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been demonstrated to possess excellent electrical conductivity, which means that they may readily gather and transfer photo-induced charges during the photocatalytic process [29]. In this investigation, we report for the first time on the production of NiTiO3/TiO2@CNFs and their photocatalytic activity towards AB photohydrolysis. The catalyst is synthesized employing an electrospinning approach. The produced NFs exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for H2 generation via AB photohydrolysis."

This was accomplished by combining 20 g of 12% solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich, USA) with 3 mL titanium isopropoxide (TIIP, 97%, Sigma Aldrich, USA). The PVP solution was prepared following the procedures described in other studies [30\u201335]. After stirring the mixture for an adequate duration of time, a translucent yellow gel is formed. In the laboratory-scale electrospinning apparatus, the formed sol\u2013gel is introduced into the plastic syringe. The positive electrode is attached to the metallic tip of the plastic syringe, while the negative electrode is attached to a rotating metallic cylinder enclosed within wax foil. Throughout the spinning process, the potential and space between the positive and negative electrodes were kept as 20 kV and 15 cm, respectively. After the NF mats had formed on the foil, they were peeled off and dried in a vacuum drier overnight at 60 \u25e6C. The material was then calcined under vacuum in an Ar atmosphere at 950 \u25e6C for 5 h. Following the same protocol as before, nickel acetate tetrahydrate (NiAc, 98.5%, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added and stirred. The same electrospinning and calcination methods were used once a translucent green solution was obtained."

The FESEM image displayed in Figure 1b was acquired after the calcination of electrospun NFs composed of NiAc, TIIP, and PVP at 950 \u25e6C for five hours in a vacuum containing argon. As can be seen in Figure 1a, the NFs maintained their structure with the growth of very small NPs on the surface of the NFs. According to the results of the EDX study (Figure 1c), the NFs are mostly composed of nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), oxygen (O), and carbon (C), and no additional elements have been found. FESEM-EDX images (Figure 1b,c) showed the formation of NPs on the surface of NFs. The EDX analysis demonstrated the presence of Ti, O, C, and Ni elements in the spectra. It is possible that the presence of carbon is making the photocatalytic process more efficient overall by doing the following: increasing the adsorption of AB molecules, which in turn increases the rate at which they are hydrolyzed by the photo-inducement of e\u2212 and h+ separation.

            "text": "It has been hypothesized that the composite NFs would undergo the photohydrolysis process of AB photodehydrogenation. The process of separating electron (e\u2212)\u2013hole (h+) pairs produced by visible illumination in the composite NFs can be understood by evaluating the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) potentials of the constituent materials. The energies in controversy were computed utilizing the subsequent empirical formulas [48]:\nECB = \u03c7 \u2212 Ee \u2212 0.5Eg (1)\nEVB = ECB + Eg (2)\nEquation (1) represents the relationship between the conduction band energy (ECB), the electron energy (Ee), and the bandgap energy (Eg) in the context of the ECB. Equation (2) represents the relationship between the valence band energy (EVB) and ECB, taking into account the bandgap energy. Furthermore, the energy of liberated electrons in relation to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) is denoted as Ee and measures 4.5 electron volts [48]. The bandgap energy of the semiconductor is denoted by \u201cEg\u201d. The symbol \u03c7 is utilized to represent the electronegativity of the semiconductor. According to a study, the potentials of CB and VB of ilmenite nickel titanite in comparison to SHE were determined to be +0.20 eV and +2.38 eV, respectively. Ilmenite nickel titanite exhibits a lower bandgap of 2.62 eV in comparison to pristine TiO2, which has a bandgap of 3.2 eV. As a result, the VB position of ilmenite nickel titanite is higher at +2.38 eV in contrast to TiO2, which is at +2.94 eV. This higher VB position of ilmenite nickel titanite facilitates the transfer of h+ from its VB to the VB of TiO2. Upon photoexcitation, the photogenerated h+ undergoes a reaction with H2O/OH\u2212, resulting in the production of OH radicals [39]. It is noteworthy that the CB of ilmenite nickel titanite is situated at a lower energy level than that of TiO2 (\u22120.29 eV). Upon exposure to light, the VB e\u2212 in ilmenite nickel titanite undergo excitation and transition to the CB, leading to the partial vacancy of the VB. Consequently, e\u2212 from\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3262 9 of 12\nthe CB of TiO2 are transferred to the CB of ilmenite nickel titanite. Its involvement in the photodehydrogenation process implies its potential as a proficient sensitizer that can effectively harness visible illumination. The mobility of photogenerated e\u2212 in ilmenite nickel titanite is observed to be directed towards the surface of the CNFs, indicating a high degree of separation efficiency between photogenerated e and h+ with low rates of recombination [40]. The O2 molecules undergo a reaction with the photogenerated electron located in the conduction band of ilmenite nickel titanite, resulting in the production of \u2022O2\u2212 without any recombination with the holes that are present on the surface of TiO2 [37]. The resulting oxide anions (\u2022O2\u2212) undergo a reaction with hydrogen ions, leading to the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO\u2022), which subsequently induce modifications to the AB molecule present in the solution. According to a study, it was found that the composite NFs exhibited a greater level of photocatalytic activity compared to that of the pristine TiO2. The mechanism of photodehydrogenation of AB utilizing composite NFs can be demonstrated as presented in Figure 8 [13,15,37,41,49].
