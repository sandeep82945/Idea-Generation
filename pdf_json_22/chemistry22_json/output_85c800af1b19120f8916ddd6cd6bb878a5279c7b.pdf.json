    "abstractText": "Background: In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS is a radiopharmaceutical with theranostic applications for imaging and Meitner-Auger electron (MAE) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). Nuclear localization sequence (NLS) peptides route the radiopharmaceutical to the nucleus of HER2-positive BC cells following receptor-mediated internalization for RIT with subcellular range MAEs. The \u03b3-photons emitted by In permit tumour imaging by SPECT. Our aim was to formulate a kit under Good Manufacturing Practices conditions to prepare In[In]-BnDTPAtrastuzumab-NLS injection for a first-in-human clinical trial. Results: Trastuzumab was derivatized with p-SCN-BnDTPA to introduce Bn-DTPA for complexing In, then modified with maleimide groups for conjugation to the thiol on cysteine in NLS peptides [CGYGPKKKRKVGG]. BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (5 mg in 1.0 mL of 0.05 M ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5) was dispensed into unit dose sterile glass vials to produce kits for labeling with 100\u2013165 MBq of In[In]Cl3. The kits met specifications for protein concentration (4.5\u20135.5 mg/mL), volume (0.95\u20131.05 mL), pH (5.5\u20136.0), appearance (clear, pale-yellow, particulate-free), BnDTPA substitution level (2.0\u20137.0 BnDTPA/trastuzumab), purity and homogeneity (SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC), In labeling efficiency (> 90%), binding to HER2-positive SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells (Ka = 1\u20138 \u00d7 10 L/mmol; Bmax = 0.5\u20132 \u00d7 10 sites/cell), NLS peptide conjugation (upward band shift on SDS-PAGE), sterility (USP Sterility Test) and endotoxins (USP Bacterial Endotoxins Test). In-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection met specifications for pH (5.5\u20136.5), radiochemical purity (\u2265 90%), radionuclide purity (\u2265 99%), appearance (clear, colourless, particle-free) and sterility (retrospective USP Sterility Test). Kits were stable stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C for up to 661 days (d) meeting all key specifications.

EJNMMI Radiopharmacy and Chemistry (2022) 7:33 concentration remained within or just slightly greater than the specification for up to 139 d. In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection was stable for up to 24 h. An expiry of 180 d was assigned for the kits and 8 h for the final radiopharmaceutical. Conclusion: A kit was formulated under GMP conditions for preparing In[In]BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection. This radiopharmaceutical was safely administered to 4 patients with HER2-positive BC to trace the uptake of trastuzumab into brain metastases before and after MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS) by SPECT imaging.",

            "text": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive breast cancer (BC) accounts for 15\u201320% of cases of BC and was previously considered a poor prognosis subtype (Burstein 2005). However, the introduction of HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin; Roche), pertuzumab (Perjeta; Roche) and the antibody\u2013drug conjugate (ADC), trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla; Roche) and the small molecule HER2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), lapatinib (Tykerb; Novartis) have improved the outcome of patients with HER2-positive BC, including those with metastatic disease (Swain et\u00a0al. 2015; Verma et\u00a0al. 2012; Geyer et\u00a0al. 2006). These HER2-targeted therapies are often combined with a taxane or other chemotherapy (Martinez-Saez and Prat 2021). In addition, several new targeted agents for treating HER2-positive BC have recently been introduced including the TKI tucatinib (Tukysa; Cascadian Therapeutics) (Murthy et\u00a0al. 2020) and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhirtu, Roche), an ADC that links trastuzumab to a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor (Martinez-Saez and Prat 2021).\nRadioimmunotherapeutic agents (RIT) are analogous to ADCs and link monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to radionuclides that emit \u03b2-particles (e.g. 131I, 177Lu, 90Y), \u03b1-particles (e.g. 225Ac, 213Bi, 211At) or Meitner-Auger electrons (MAEs; e.g. 111In, 125I, 67Ga) for radiation treatment of tumours (Aghevlian et\u00a0al. 2017; Ku et\u00a0al. 2019). Trastuzumab labeled with the \u03b2-particle emitter, 177Lu was cytotoxic in\u00a0vitro to HER2-positive human SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453 human BC cells and SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells (Sharma et\u00a0al. 2020). Treatment of athymic mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) HER2positive LS-174\u00a0T human colon cancer xenografts with i.p. administered 177Lu-labeled trastuzumab prolonged survival more than 12-fold compared to untreated mice (Ray et\u00a0 al. 2011). 177Lu-labeled trastuzumab administered to patients with HER2-positive BC localized in primary and metastatic tumors and these were\u00a0detected by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) illustrating its potential for imaging and RIT of HER2-positive BC (Bhusari et\u00a0 al. 2017). Our group reported that a bispecific RIT agent composed of trastuzumab Fab linked through a polyethylene glycol (PEG24) spacer to epidermal growth factor (EGF) labeled with 177Lu was cytotoxic in\u00a0vitro to human BC cells expressing HER2 or epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) or both receptors (Razumienko et\u00a0 al. 2016). This agent was effective for RIT of HER2 and EGFR-positive MDA-MB-231/H2N tumours in athymic mice but hematopoietic toxicity limited the dose that could be safely administered. RIT of solid tumours in humans with \u03b2-particle emitters has similarly proven dose-limited\nby off-target hematopoietic toxicity (Larson et\u00a0 al. 2015) due to the long (several millimeters) path length of \u03b2-particles (cross-fire effect) (Richman et\u00a0al. 2005). In addition, \u03b2-particles have very low linear energy transfer (LET = 0.1\u20131\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) that makes them theoretically less potent than shorter range (28\u2013100\u00a0 \u03bcm) and higher LET \u03b1-particles (LET = 50\u2013230\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) or nanometer-micrometer range MAEs (LET = 4\u201326\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) for killing cancer cells (Aghevlian et\u00a0al. 2017).\nTrastuzumab labeled with \u03b1-particle emitting, 225Ac administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection was effective for RIT of HER2-positive SK-OV-3 human ovarian cancer tumours in athymic mice (Borchardt et\u00a0 al. 2003). 225Ac-labeled trastuzumab was also effective for treatment of SUM225 ductal carcinoma in\u00a0 situ of the breast tumours in NCG mice after intraductal injection (Yoshida et\u00a0al. 2016). However, intravenous (i.v.) injection of 225Ac-labeled trastuzumab in these studies caused hematopoietic system toxicity, possibly due to irradiation of bone marrow stem cells by the 28\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm range \u03b1-particles emitted by circulating 225Ac-labeled trastuzumab perfusing the bone marrow (cross-fire effect). In addition, the 213Bi decay product of 225Ac poses a risk for renal toxicity (Yoshida et\u00a0al. 2016).\nMAE-emitting radionuclides are an alternative to \u03b1-particle emitters for RIT since they similarly exhibit high LET, but their cytotoxic effects are restricted to cells that bind and internalize the radioimmunoconjugates (RICs) due to the subcellular range of the electrons. There is no cross-fire effect from MAE-emitting radionuclides, which greatly reduces off-target toxicity (e.g. hematopoietic toxicity) compared to longer range \u03b2-emitters such as 177Lu (Ku et\u00a0al. 2019; Aghevlian et\u00a0al. 2017). Moreover, MAE-emitters decay to stable elements which avoids toxicity from radioactive daughter products, a challenge for \u03b1-particle emitters such as 225Ac. MAEs kill cancer cells by causing oxidative damage to the cell membrane (Paillas et\u00a0al. 2016) or by inflicting lethal DNA doublestrand breaks (Ku et\u00a0al. 2019). DNA damage from MAEs is the most potent and may be maximized by conjugation of the mAbs to peptides that incorporate nuclear translocation sequences (NLS) or by targeting a receptor that harbours an endogenous NLS. NLS are short sequences of 4 or more cationic amino acids [arginine (R) or lysine (K)] that bind to importin-\u03b1 which\u00a0forms a complex with importin-\u03b2 and mediates active transport of proteins across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2008b). Only proteins with molecular weight (MW) < 40\u201345\u00a0kDa are able to diffuse across the NPC due to the size of the pores (25\u201330\u00a0nm). A classical NLS is the Simian Virus-40 (SV-40) large T-antigen\u00a0NLS [126PKKKRKV132] but many peptide growth factors and their receptors harbour endogenous NLS (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2008b).\nWe modified trastuzumab with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) to complex the MAE-emitter, 111In (t1/2 = 2.8 d) and subsequently conjugated these RICs to 13-mer peptides [CGYG PKKKRKVGG] that harboured the NLS of SV-40 large T-antigen (italics) to promote nucleus uptake after HER2-mediated internalization into BC cells (Costantini et\u00a0 al. 2007). Treatment of athymic mice with subcutaneous (s.c.) HER2-positive MDA-MB-361 human BC xenografts with a single amount of 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (9.25\u00a0 MBq; 4\u00a0 mg/kg) administered by i.p. injection inhibited tumour growth by fourfold compared to untreated mice and did not cause any normal tissue toxicity, including to the hematopoietic system (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2010a). Two amounts of 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (9.25\u00a0 MBq; 4\u00a0 mg/kg) separated by\ntwo weeks prolonged survival by 1.7-fold compared to untreated mice (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2010a). Furthermore, 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS killed trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BC cells in\u00a0vitro (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2008a). These cytotoxic effects of 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS were radiosensitized by methotrexate, paclitaxel or doxorubicin (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2010b).\nBased on these encouraging preclinical results, our aim in the current study was to formulate a kit for preparing 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) conditions to enable advancement to a first-in-human clinical trial. The p-isothiocyanate ester of DTPA (p-SCN-BnDTPA) was used rather than DTPA dianhydride employed prevously to modify trastuzumab with DTPA (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2007), since this bifunctional chelator provides more stable complexes with 111In and minimizes cross-linking of trastuzumab molecules, which may occur due to the two reactive groups present in DTPA dianhydride (Brechbiel et\u00a0al. 1986). In addition to the MAE emissions, 111In emits \u03b3-photons [E\u03b3 = 171\u00a0keV (90.7%) and 245\u00a0keV (94.1%)] that permit imaging by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Thus, for this first-in-human clinical trial, we formulated a kit for labeling 5\u00a0mg of DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS with 111\u2013165\u00a0MBq of 111In to assess the tumour and normal tissue uptake of this radiopharmaceutical in humans by SPECT. These mass and activity amounts were selected based on those previously reported for SPECT imaging of HER2-positive BC in humans using 111In[In]DTPA-trastuzumab (100\u2013150\u00a0MBq; 5\u00a0mg) (Perik et\u00a0al. 2006).\n111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection prepared from the kit described here was recently administered safely for the first time to 4 patients with HER2-positive BC to trace the uptake of trastuzumab into brain metastases, prior to and after application of MRI guided focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS) (Meng et\u00a0 al. 2021). MRIg-FUS is an interventional technique that transiently and spatially disrupts the blood\u2013brain-barrier (BBB), facilitating penetration of trastuzumab into metastatic lesions in the brain (Park et\u00a0al. 2012). There were no adverse reactions associated with administration of the radiopharmaceutical. This study revealed that MRIg-FUS significantly improved the delivery of trastuzumab into brain metastases by as much as 4.5-fold. These results further suggest that 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab may be a promising MAE-emitting RIT agent for treating brain metastases in patients with HER2-positive BC by employing MRIgFUS-enhanced delivery into the brain. Thus, 111In-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS is a theranostic agent with promising application for imaging and MAE RIT of HER2-positive"

Trastuzumab identity and purity were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). We previously used these analytical methods to study\nthe stability of trastuzumab for short term storage at room temperature (RT) or at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C (Chan et\u00a0al. 2020). For SDS-PAGE, ~ 2\u00a0\u03bcg of trastuzumab was electrophoresed on a 4\u201320% Tris\u2013HCl gradient mini-gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) under reducing (dithiothreitol, DTT) and non-reducing conditions. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie R-250 Brilliant Blue. Broad range molecular weight (MW) standards were electrophoresed to calibrate the gel. Western blot was performed by transferring electrophoresed proteins onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immun-Blot, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and probing with goat anti-human Fab-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immunoconjugates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Bands were developed with diamidobenzidine/0.03% H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Trastuzumab (~ 10\u00a0 \u03bcg) was analysed for purity and homogeneity by SE-HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) on a BioSep SEC-s4000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) eluted with 100\u00a0 mM NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.8\u00a0 mL/min with UV detection at 280\u00a0 nm. Peptides harbouring the nuclear translocation sequence (NLS; italics) of SV-40 large T-antigen [CGYG PKKKRKVGG] (Costantini et\u00a0 al. 2008b) were synthesized commercially by Bio Basic, Inc.

A certificate of actual lot analysis (COA) was obtained from the manufacturer which included HPLC analysis and a mass spectrum confirming the expected MW (1,419\u00a0Da). The identity of NLS peptides was determined by amino acid composition (SPARC Biocentre/Advanced Protein Technology Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada). S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-SCN-BnDTPA; purity \u2265 94%) was purchased from Macrocyclics (Dallas, TX, USA). A COA was obtained and the identity of p-SCN-BnDTPA was confirmed by 1H NMR (Varian Mercury 400\u00a0MHz) and by obtaining a UV\u2013visible spectrum (200\u2013900\u00a0nm) dissolved in 0.1\u00a0M sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) buffer, pH 8.2 (0.3\u00a0mg/mL) using a spectrophotometer (Bio Tek, Winooski, VT, USA)."

The device was centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 5,000 \u00d7 g at 18\u00a0\u00b0C, until ~ 2\u00a0mL of solution was retained. This solution was re-diluted to 12\u00a0 mL with 0.1\u00a0 M NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.2 and centrifuged again. This was repeated a total of 4 times. The retentate was recovered and a sample of 2 \u03bcL was diluted 1:40 to determine the concentration of IgG by measuring the absorbance at 280\u00a0 nm using the extinction coefficient 1.5\u00a0mL\u00a0mg \u22121\u00a0 cm\u22121 for IgG. The trastuzumab concentration was adjusted to 16\u00a0mg/mL with 0.1\u00a0 M NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.2 and a volume of ~ 5.0\u00a0 mL. Trastuzumab was then reacted with a 15-fold molar excess of p-SCN-BnDTPA (10\u00a0mg/mL freshly prepared in 0.1\u00a0M NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.2) in a sterilized 10\u00a0mL glass Reacti-Vial\u00ae (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at RT for 1\u00a0h. Duplicate samples (12 \u03bcL) of the conjugation reaction were removed for subsequent determination of conjugation efficiency (CE) in order to estimate the number of BnDTPA conjugated to trastuzumab (see Quality Control Testing of Kits). The reaction mixture was transferred to an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (MWCO = 30\u00a0kDa) and re-diluted to 12\u00a0mL with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3. The device was centrifuged at 5,000 \u00d7 g at 18\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min until ~ 2\u00a0mL was retained. This solution was re-diluted to 12\u00a0 mL with 0.1\u00a0 M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and centrifuged again. This was repeated a total of 16 times to completely remove unconjugated p-SCN-BnDTPA. Purified BnDTPA-trastuzumab was recovered in ~ 8\u00a0mL of 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and transferred to a pre-weighed 15\u00a0mL sterile polypropylene tube (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany). The tube was re-weighed to calculate the volume of recovered solution by difference, assuming 1\u00a0g = 1\u00a0mL. A sample (2 \u03bcL)\nwas removed and diluted 40-fold with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and the absorbance was measured at 280\u00a0nm to calculate the concentration of BnDTPA-trastuzumab. Finally, BnDTPA-trastuzumab was diluted to 6.0\u00a0 mg/mL with 0.1\u00a0 M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3.\nBnDTPA-trastuzumab was then reacted with a fivefold molar excess of Sulfo-SMCC (10\u00a0mg/mL freshly dissolved in 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3) in a 10\u00a0mL sterilized glass Reacti-vial at RT for 1\u00a0 h to introduce maleimide functional groups for reaction with the thiol on cysteine in NLS peptides. Excess unconjugated Sulfo-SMCC was removed by transferring the reaction mixture to an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (MWCO = 30\u00a0kDa), diluting to 12\u00a0mL with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and centrifuging the device at 5000 \u00d7 g at 18\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. This retained solution was diluted again to 12\u00a0mL with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and the device centrifuged again. This was repeated a total of 10 times. Purified maleimide-functionalized BnDTPA-trastuzumab solution was recovered into a pre-weighed 15\u00a0mL sterile polypropylene tube and the volume of the solution was determined by difference, assuming 1\u00a0g = 1\u00a0mL. A sample (2 \u03bcL) was diluted 40-fold with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3 and the absorbance measured at 280\u00a0nm to determine the concentration of maleimide-functionalized BnDTPA-trastuzumab. The concentration was adjusted to 5.0\u00a0mg/mL with 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3.\nMaleimide-functionalized BnDTPA-trastuzumab was reacted with a 60-fold molar excess of NLS peptides (20\u00a0mg/mL in 0.1\u00a0M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.3) in a 10\u00a0mL sterilized glass Reacti-vial at 4\u00a0 \u00b0C overnight. Unconjugated NLS peptides were removed by transferring the reaction mixture to an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device and diluting with 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5. The solution was centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min, the filtrate discarded and the retained solution diluted again with 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5. This was repeated a total of 15 times. The concentration of recovered purified BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280\u00a0nm and the solution was diluted to a final concentration of 5.0\u00a0mg/ mL with 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5. Tween 20\u00ae surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS solution to a final concentration of 0.1% to prevent protein aggregation (Strickley and Lambert 2021). The BnDTPA-trastuzumabNLS solution was drawn up in a 5\u00a0mL sterile syringe with an 18G \u00d7 1\u00bd\u201d needle (Becton-Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm Millex GV low protein-binding filter (Sigma-Aldrich) into a 30\u00a0mL sterile glass vial with grey butyl rubber septum and aluminum seal. The integrity of the sterilizing filter was checked by the bubble test. Then 1.0\u00a0mL aliquots (5.0\u00a0mg of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS) were drawn up using a 1\u00a0cc U-1000 insulin syringe with 28G \u00d7 \u00bd\u201d gauge needle (BectonDickenson) and aseptically dispensed into sterile 5-mL glass vials to produce unit-dose kits. Kits were stored in the refrigerator at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C."

            "text": "Kits were tested against specifications for protein concentration (4.5\u20135.5\u00a0 mg/mL), volume (0.95\u20131.05\u00a0mL), pH (5.5\u20136.0), appearance (clear, pale-yellow, particulate-free), BnDTPA substitution level (2.0\u20137.0 BnDTPA/trastuzumab), purity and homogeneity (SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC), 111In labeling efficiency (> 90%), binding to HER2-positive\nSK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells (Ka = 1\u20138 \u00d7 108 L/mmol; Bmax = 0.5\u20132 \u00d7 106 sites/ cell), NLS peptide conjugation (upward shift in the protein band on SDS-PAGE compared to BnDTPA-trastuzumab), sterility (USP Sterility Test) and endotoxins (USP Bacterial Endotoxins Test). Protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280\u00a0nm. The volume in each kit vial was measured by the difference in weight of the vial before and after dispensing 1.0\u00a0mL of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS solution into the vial, assuming 1\u00a0g = 1\u00a0mL. The pH was measured by spotting a sample on pH 4.5\u20137.5 range pH paper (pHydrion\u00ae, Micro Essential Laboratory, Brooklyn, NY, USA). Appearance was inspected by examining the colour, clarity and presence of any particles against a light or dark background.\nSDS-PAGE was performed by electrophoresing ~ 2\u00a0\u03bcg on a 4\u201320% Tris\u2013HCl gradient mini-gel (BioRad) under reducing (DTT) and non-reducing conditions. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie R-250 Brilliant Blue. The gel was calibrated by electrophoresing broad range MW standards. The stained SDS-PAGE gel was imaged on a BioRad ChemiDoc Imaging System (Mississauga, ON, Canada) and the relative density of each band determined using BioRad Image Lab (ver 6.0) software. The number of NLS peptides conjugated to trastuzumab was estimated by comparing the approximate MW of electrophoresed BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS versus BnDTPAtrastuzumab, assuming that each NLS peptide has a MW = 1,419\u00a0 Da. SE-HPLC was performed on a BioSep SEC-s4000 column (Phenomenex) eluted with 100\u00a0mM NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.8\u00a0mL/min with UV detection at 280\u00a0nm (Agilent Technologies). To avoid sticking of the immunoconjugates to the matrix of the column, the cationic charges on NLS peptides were masked prior to analysis by reaction with a 50-fold molar excess of citraconic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.25\u00a0g/ mL in H2O) for 2\u00a0 h at RT. Excess citraconic acid was removed by ultrafiltration on an Amicon Ultra-0.5\u00a0mL centrifugal filter device, repeated 8 times and a 20 \u03bcL sample (~ 15 \u03bcg) of the recovered BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS solution was chromatographed. The manufacturer of the BioSep SEC-s4000 column (Phenomenex) indicates that molecules with MW ranging from 244\u00a0Da (uridine) to 900\u00a0kDa (IgM) are wellseparated. Trastuzumab (MW = 170\u00a0 kDa), NLS peptides (MW = 1,419\u00a0 Da) and unconjugated p-SCN-BnDTPA (MW = 649.9\u00a0Da) are separated by this column.\nBnDTPA substitution level (moles BnDTPA/mole trastuzumab) was determined by trace-labeling duplicate 10 \u03bcL samples (~ 140\u00a0\u03bcg) of the unpurified reaction mixture (retained earlier) with ~ 1.0\u00a0MBq (~ 3.4 \u03bcL) of 111InCl3 (BWXT Medical Ltd.) mixed with ~ 10 \u03bcL of 0.05\u00a0 M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5 in a 1.5\u00a0 mL Eppendorf tube for 2\u00a0 h at RT. The sample was analysed by instant thin layer-silica gel chromatography (ITLC-SG; Agilent Technologies) developed in 0.1\u00a0M sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0 to measure the fraction of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab (Rf = 0.0) and 111In-BnDTPA (Rf = 1.0). The fraction of 111In-BnDTPA-trastuzumab was then multiplied by the 15-fold molar excess of p-SCN-BnDTPA used in the reaction to calculate the number of moles of BnDTPA/trastuzumab. The labeling efficiency (LE) of the kits with 111In was determined by aseptically decapping a single kit vial in a Class II Type A2 biosafety cabinet (Model 425\u2013400; NuAire) and adding 100\u2013165\u00a0 MBq (~ 19 \u03bcL) of 111InCl3 (BWXT Medical Ltd.) mixed with 38 \u03bcL of 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH\n5.5 using a digital pipette with sterile tip and incubating at RT for 1\u20132\u00a0h. The percentage of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS was determined by ITLC-SG.\nThe binding of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS to HER2-positive SK-BR-3 cells was determined by a direct (saturation) binding assay as previously reported (Lam et\u00a0al. 2015). Briefly, total binding (TB) was determined by incubating increasing concentrations [0.07\u2013300 nmoles/L) of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1 \u00d7 106 SK-BR-3 cells in 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 3.5\u00a0h with gentle shaking. The tubes were centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to recover the cell-bound (pellet) and free (supernatant) radioactivity which was then measured in a \u03b3-counter (Model Wallac Wizard 1480, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The assay was repeated in the presence of an excess (15.2 \u03bcmoles/L) of unlabeled trastuzumab to determine non-specific binding (NSB). Specific binding (SB) was calculated by subtraction of NSB from TB and plotted vs. the concentration of free 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (nmoles/L). The curve was fitted to a one-site receptor-binding model by Prism Ver. 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) and the affinity constant (Ka) and maximum number of binding sites per cell (Bmax) were calculated.\nKits were tested by the USP Sterility Test at the Microbiology Laboratory at Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada). Kits were tested for endotoxins by the USP Bacterial Endotoxins Test using the QCL-1000 Endpoint Chromogenic LAL Assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). The stability of kits stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C was assessed at selected intervals up to 661 d to establish an expiry by re-testing against specifications for protein concentration, pH, appearance, purity and homogeneity, labeling efficiency with 111In and HER2-binding properties. Sterility and endotoxins were not re-tested as it was expected that these would be maintained in storage since the kit solution was maintained sterile and\u00a0endotoxin-free by packaging in sealed sterile, apyrogenic 5\u00a0mL glass vials.\n111In[In]\u2011BnDTPA\u2011trastuzumab\u2011NLS injection 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection was prepared by aseptically decapping a single kit vial in a Class II Type A2 biosafety cabinet (Model 425\u2013400; NuAire) and adding 100\u2013165\u00a0MBq (~ 19 \u03bcL) of 111In[In]Cl3 (BWXT Medical Ltd.) mixed with 38 \u03bcL of 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5 using a digital pipette and sterile tip. The vial was incubated at RT for 1\u20132\u00a0h, then diluted to a final volume of 2.0\u00a0mL by addition of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The radiopharmaceutical solution was then drawn up in a 3\u00a0mL syringe with an 18G\u00a0x\u00a01\u00bd\" needle and the solution sterilized by passing through a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm Millex GV filter into a 5\u00a0mL sterile glass vial with grey butyl rubber septum and aluminum seal. The integrity of the sterilizing filter was checked by the bubble test. 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection was assayed in a radioisotope dose calibrator (Capintec Model CRC25R, Ramsey, NJ, USA) and the specific activity calculated by dividing the radioactivity (MBq) by the mass of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS in the kit (5\u00a0mg). The specification was 20\u201333\u00a0MBq/mg. The radiopharmaceutical was tested against specifications for pH (5.5\u20136.5), radiochemical purity (RCP \u2265 90%), radionuclide purity (\u2265 99%), appearance (clear, colourless, particle-free) and sterility (retrospective USP Sterility Test). The pH was measured using pH 4.5\u20137.5 range pH paper (pHydrion\u00ae). The RCP was measured by ITLC-SG developed in 0.1\u00a0M sodium citrate,\npH 5.0. Radionuclide purity was confirmed by the COA for the actual lot of 111In[In] Cl3 (BWXT Medical Ltd.; \u2265 99%; < 0.1% 114mIn or 65Zn). The appearance was inspected by examining the radiopharmaceutical vial against a light or dark background. Lots of 111In-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection were tested retrospectively for sterility by the USP Sterility Test after decay for at least 60 d. The stability of 111In[In]-BnDTPAtrastuzumab-NLS injection stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C was assessed over 24\u00a0h by re-testing against specifications for clarity and RCP (\u2265 90%) to establish an expiry."

These bands were immunopositive on Western blot when probed with goat anti-human Fab-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immunoconjugates (Fig.\u00a01B). SE-HPLC analysis of trastuzumab showed one major peak with retention time (tR = 11.7\u00a0min) accounting for > 98% of all peak areas (Fig.\u00a0 1C). Proton NMR analysis of p-SCN-BnDTPA agreed with the reported 1H spectrum (Brechbiel et\u00a0 al. 1986). The COA from the supplier (Macrocyclics) confirmed 94.1% purity.

            "text": "Three sequential lots of kits (8\u20139 vials/lot) were manufactured (Lots 17N014, 17N026, 18N008). All lots met specifications (Table\u00a0 1). Protein concentration ranged from 5.3\u20135.4\u00a0mg/mL. The volume was 1.0\u00a0mL and the pH was 6.0 for all lots. BnDTPA substitution ranged from 3.8\u20135.1 BnDTPA/trastuzumab. SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions (Fig.\u00a0 2A) showed a single major band for trastuzumab (MW = 170\u00a0 kDa, lanes 1/4/7) and BnDTPA-trastuzumab (MW = 170\u00a0 kDa, lanes 2,5,8). Analysis of 3 kit lots of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (lanes 3/6/9) under non-reducing conditions showed a slight upward shift of the major protein band compared to BnDTPA-trastuzumab indicating NLS peptide conjugation. Based on the band shift, we estimated the number of NLS peptides conjugated to BnDTPAtrastuzumab for kit lots 17N014, 17N026 and 18N008 were 3, 2 and 3, respectively (mean \u00b1 SD = 2.7 \u00b1 0.4). There was a faint higher MW protein band for BnDTPAtrastuzumab-NLS (MW > 250\u00a0 kDa) but not for BnDTPA-trastuzumab or trastuzumab, which may represent cross-linked immunoconjugates caused by reaction of BnDTPA-trastuzumab with Sulfo-SMCC to introduce maleimide groups required for subsequent conjugation to NLS peptides. This band accounted for < 8% of all protein bands by gel densitometry. Under reducing conditions, trastuzumab (lanes 10/13/16) and BnDTPA-trastuzumab (lanes 11/14/17) migrated as two major bands\n(MW = 50\u00a0 kDa and 25\u00a0 kDa) corresponding to the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains while the bands for BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (lanes 12/15/18) migrated at slightly higher MW of 55 and 28\u00a0kDa, respectively. There was a faint higher MW band (MW = 110\u00a0 kDa) for BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS but not for trastuzumab or BnDTPA-trastuzumab, which may represent reduced cross-linked immunoconjugates following Sulfo-SMCC conjugation. SE-HPLC analysis of a representative lot (17N014) of kits (Fig.\u00a0 3A) showed one major peak (> 90%) for BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS with a tR = 11.7\u00a0min and a small secondary peak at tR = 10.6\u00a0min (< 10%). This small peak may represent cross-linked immunoconjugates due to reaction with Sulfo-SMCC. Trastuzumab eluted as a single peak with tR = 11.7\u00a0 min (Fig.\u00a0 3B). The labeling efficiency of the kits with 111In was consistently very high: 99.0%, 98.4% and 98.6% for kit lots 17N014, 17N026 and 18N008, respectively, and met specifications for labeling efficiency (\u2265 90%; Table\u00a0 1). 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS\ninjection prepared from the kits exhibited preserved high affinity binding to HER2positive SK-BR-3 cells (Table\u00a0 1). The Ka and Bmax values for lots 17N014, 17N026, 18N008 were 6.2 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 108 L/mol and 0.9 \u00b1 0.03 \u00d7 106 sites/cell, 4.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 108 L/ mol and 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 106 sites/cell and 5.6 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 108 L/mol and 0.9 \u00b1 0.05 \u00d7 106 sites/ cell, respectively.

Based on these testing results, and to limit the protein concentration exceeding specification, an expiry of 180 d was assigned to the kits stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C.\nTa bl\ne 2\nSt ab\nili ty\nte st\nin g\nre su\nlts fo\nr t hr\nee s\neq ue\nnt ia\nl l ot\ns of\nk its\nfo r t\nhe p\nre pa\nra tio\nn of\n11 1 I\nn[ In\n]-B nD\nTP A\n-t ra\nst uz\num ab\n-N LS\nin je\nct io\nn\na St\nor ag\ne pe\nrio d\nat 2\n\u20138 \u00a0\u00b0C\np rio\nr t o\nre -t\nes tin\ng ag\nai ns\nt q ua\nlit y\nsp ec\nifi ca\ntio ns\nb S\nlig ht\nly o\nut si\nde th\ne sp\nec ifi\nca tio\nn (4\n.5 \u20135\n.5 \u00a0m\ng/ m L) c n. d. : N ot d et er m in ed Pa ra m et er Sp ec ifi ca tio\nn 17\nN 01\n4 17\nN 02\n6 18\nN 00\n8\n9 d\na 93\nd 12\n7 d\n66 1\nd 21\nd 97\nd 13\n9 d\n58 9\nd 16\nd 94\nd 12\n9 d\n30 4\nd\nPr ot\nei n\nco nc\nen tr\nat io\nn 4.\n5\u2013 5.\n5 m\ng/ m\nL 5.\n3 n.\nd 5.\n4 5.\n6 b\n5. 4\nn. d\n5. 5\n5. 6\nb 5.\n4 n.\nd 5.\n6 b\n5. 9\nb\npH 5.\n5\u2013 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0 6.\n0\nA pp\nea ra\nnc e\nC le\nar p\nal e\nye llo\nw , p\nar tic\nle -fr\nee Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned\nPu rit\ny an\nd ho\nm og\nen ei\nty SD\nSPA\nG E:\n1 m\naj or\nb an\nd (1\n70 k\nD a)\nu nd\ner n\non -r\ned uc\nin g\nco nd itio ns ; 2 m aj or b an ds (5 0 kD a an d 25 k D a) u nd er re du ci ng co nd iti on s SE -H PL C : 1 m aj or p ea k at t R = 1 1. 7 \u00b1 0 .2 m in\nPa ss\ned n.\nd. c\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned n.\nd Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nn. d\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\n11 1 I\nn La\nbe lin\ng effi\nci en\ncy IT\nLC : \u2265\n9 0%\n99 .0\n98 .5\n98 .3\n97 .4\n98 .4\n98 .5\n98 .8\n97 .6\n98 .6\n98 .8\n98 .9\n98 .1\nH ER\n2 bi\nnd in\ng pr\nop er\ntie s\nSK -B\nR3\nce lls : K a = 1 .0 \u20138 .0 \u00d7\n1 08\nL /m\nol e;\nB m\nax =\n0 .5\n\u20132 .0\n\u00d7 1\n08 b\nin di\nng s\nite s/\nce ll\nPa ss\ned n.\nd Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nn. d\nPa ss\ned Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned n.\nd Pa\nss ed\nPa ss\ned\n111In[In]\u2011BnDTPA\u2011trastuzumab\u2011NLS injection Fifteen sequential lots of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection were prepared (Table\u00a0 3).

            "text": "We report here the formulation of a kit under GMP conditions for preparing 111In[In]BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection in pharmaceutical quality suitable for human studies. 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection prepared from the kit was\nrecently safely administered to 4 patients with HER2-positive BC to trace the uptake of trastuzumab into brain metastases enhanced by MRIg-FUS (Meng et\u00a0al. 2021). Our report is the first to describe a kit for preparing 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection under GMP conditions and to our knowledge, is the first to report formulation of a radiopharmaceutical modified with NLS peptides for human administration. To formulate the kit, trastuzumab was first reacted with p-SCN-BnDTPA to introduce BnDTPA chelators to complex 111In. There were 3.9, 3.8 and 5.1 BnDTPA/trastuzumab molecule for kit lots 17N014, 17N026 and 18N008, respectively (Table\u00a0 1). BnDTPA-trastuzumab was then reacted with Sulfo-SMCC to introduce maleimide groups for reaction with the thiol on cysteine on 13-mer peptides [CGYG PKKKRKVGG] that harbour the NLS of SV-40 large T-antigen (italics) (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2008b). NLS conjugation was confirmed by an upward shift in the band for BnDTPAtrastuzumab-NLS compared to BnDTPA-trastuzumab on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig.\u00a0 2). Based on the band shift, we estimated that there were 3, 2 and 3 NLS peptides per trastuzumab molecule for kit lots 17N014, 17N026 and 18N008, respectively. This level of NLS peptides is within the range that we previously reported for 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (2.5\u20138.4 NLS peptides per trastuzumab molecule) (Costantini et\u00a0 al. 2007). We noted a small percentage (< 8%) of higher MW (> 250\u00a0 kDa) protein on SDS-PAGE analysis of BnDTPA-trastuzumabNLS under non-reducing conditions, that was not present in BnDTPA-trastuzumab or trastuzumab. Similarly, a small percentage (< 10%) of a higher MW protein was detected by SE-HPLC analysis of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS (Fig.\u00a03A; tR = 10.6\u00a0min) but not for trastuzumab (Fig.\u00a0 3B). We believe that this represents cross-linked IgG due to reaction of BnDTPA-trastuzumab with Sulfo-SMCC. Sulfo-SMCC incorporates a sulfosuccinimidyl ester that reacts with primary amines and a maleimide functional group that reacts with thiols. Our intent was to react amine groups on BnDTPA-trastuzumab with Sulfo-SMCC and use the introduced maleimide functionality to conjugate BnDTPA-trastuzumab to the NLS peptides by reaction with the thiol on the cysteine in the peptides. However, recombinant monoclonal antibodies may contain a small number of free thiols that could react with the maleimide functional groups and this may be responsible for the small amount of cross-linking of BnDTPA-trastuzumab molecules observed (Metcalfe 2022).\n111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection prepared from the kits exhibited high affinity and specific binding to HER2 on SK-BR-3 human BC cells in a direct (saturation) binding assay (Ka = 4.6\u20136.2 \u00d7 108 L/mole; Bmax = 0.9 \u00d7 106 binding sites/cell; Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a04). The HER2 binding affinity was similar to that previously reported for 111In[In]-DTPA-trastuzumab-NLS, measured in a competition receptor-binding assay using SK-BR-3 cells (Ka = 1.7\u20133.2 \u00d7 108 L/mole) (Costantini et\u00a0al. 2007). We previously reported that 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab exhibited a Ka = 3.2 \u00d7 108 L/mole (Kd = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u20139\u00a0mol/L) for binding to HER2 on SK-BR-3 cells and Bmax = 1 \u00d7 106 binding sites/cell. (Chan et\u00a0al. 2020). The product monograph for trastuzumab (Herceptin, Roche) states that the Kd for binding to HER2 = 5 \u00d7 10\u20139\u00a0mol/L (Ka = 2 \u00d7 108 L/mole) in a cell-based assay (Roche 2021). Thus, the HER2-binding properties of 111In[In]-BnDTPAtrastuzumab-NLS were similar to those of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab or unmodified trastuzumab.\nThe kits achieved a LE = 98.4\u201399.0% after incubation with 111In[In]Cl3 at RT for 1\u20132\u00a0h, which met specifications (\u2265 90%; Table\u00a01). This very high LE was achieved due to extensive purification during kit formulation by ultrafiltration on an Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (MWCO = 30\u00a0kDa) to remove unreacted p-SCN-BnDTPA from BnDTPA-trastuzumab (ultrafiltration 16 times) and subsequently to purify BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS from unconjugated NLS peptides (ultrafiltration 15 times). We have previously used ultrafiltration to remove unconjugated BnDTPA from BnDTPA-pertuzumab to formulate a kit for labeling pertuzumab (Perjeta, Roche) with 111In that similarly achieved a very high LE = 98% when incubated with 111In[In]Cl3 for 30\u00a0min at RT (Lam et\u00a0al. 2015). The very high LE (> 98%) for labeling the kits for 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumabNLS injection with 111\u2013165\u00a0MBq of 111InCl3 suggests that higher amounts of 111In[In] Cl3 could be added to the kit, while still meeting the LE specification (\u2265 90%). Alternatively, the kit formulation could be scaled up for future therapeutic application, for which higher amounts of activity would be required than for SPECT imaging. There have been very few studies of MAE-emitting radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment in patients. In one clinical\u00a0trial, the single amount of 111In[In]-DTPA-pentetreotide radiopeptides administered for MAE radiotherapy of somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumours in humans ranged from 2,000 to 11,000\u00a0MBq (Valkema et\u00a0al. 2002). 111In[In]-DTPA-EGF was administered to patients with EGFR-positive BC in amounts up to 2,290\u00a0MBq in a Phase 1 clinical trial of MAE peptide radiotherapy (Vallis et\u00a0al. 2014). The amount of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS required for RIT of HER2-positive BC in humans may be much lower than 111In[In]-DTPA-pentetreotide or 111In[In]-DTPA-EGF due to the slower elimination and generally higher tumour uptake of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies than radiopeptides (Reilly et\u00a0al. 2000). However, assuming comparable amounts of 2,000\u201311,000\u00a0MBq, this would require scaling the kit formulation from 5 to 70\u00a0mg of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS per vial to achieve labeling with 111In at the same specific activity (up to 33\u00a0MBq/mg). This mass dose of 111In[In]BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS is equivalent to 1\u00a0mg/kg in a 70\u00a0kg human and is lower than the therapeutic doses of trastuzumab, which are a loading dose of 4\u00a0mg/kg and maintenance dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg (Roche 2021), thus should be safe.\nThe kits were stable stored at 2\u20138\u00a0 \u00b0C for up to 661 d, continuing to meet specifications for key quality parameters (Table\u00a02 and Fig.\u00a05). Sterility and endotoxins were not re-tested. Protein concentration was slightly higher (5.6\u20135.9\u00a0mg/mL) than the specification (4.5\u20135.5\u00a0mg/mL; Table\u00a02) after storage of the kits for extended periods (304\u2013661 d). However, the protein concentration remained within the specification for kit lot 17N014 up to 127 d (5.4\u00a0mg/mL) and for kit lot 17N026 up to 139 d (5.5\u00a0mg/mL) and was only slightly higher than specification for kit lot 18N008 at 129 d (5.6\u00a0mg/mL). This higher than expected protein concentration may be due to minor evaporation of 0.05\u00a0M NH4CO2CH3 buffer, pH 5.5 within the sealed vial in storage. However, since the kits are unit-dose vials, this slight variance from the specified protein concentration would not be clinically important as the final radiopharmaceutical product will still consist of 5\u00a0mg of BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS labeled with 111In, which is then diluted to a final volume of 2.0\u00a0mL by addition of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The expiry of the kits was set to 6\u00a0months (180 d) stored at 2\u20138\u00a0 \u00b0C to limit the protein concentration exceeding specification. Fifteen sequential lots of 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection\nwere prepared from the kits and all lots met specifications (Table\u00a03) for specific activity (20\u201333\u00a0MBq/mg), pH (5.5\u20136.0), appearance (clear, pale yellow and particle-free), RCP (\u2265 90%) and sterility (USP Sterility Test tested retrospectively). 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection continued to meet specifications for RCP, pH and appearance stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The expiry was set to 8\u00a0h because it was intended to administer the radiopharmaceutical to patients within this time period. We previously similarly found that kits for preparing 111In[In]-BnDTPA-pertuzumab injection were stable for 4\u00a0months stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and the final radiopharmaceutical was stable for 24\u00a0h, stored at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C (Lam et\u00a0al. 2015). 111In[In]-BnDTPA-trastuzumab-NLS injection may also be stable for short periods at RT since we detected no degradation of trastuzumab stored at RT or at 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 12\u00a0h (Chan et\u00a0al. 2020)."
