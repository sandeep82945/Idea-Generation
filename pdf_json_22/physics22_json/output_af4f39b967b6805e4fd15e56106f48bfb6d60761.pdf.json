            "text": "Being systems analogous to hydrogen-like atoms with notable level splitting, by which QED interaction is tested in minute detail, the doubly heavy (DH) baryon provides a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and models inspired by it [1\u20134]. It is expected that the excited DH baryons can form a set of nontrivial levels with various mass splitting and confront the QCD interaction with the experiments in a straightforward way.\nIn 2017, the LHCb Collaboration at CERN discovered the doubly charmed baryon ++cc in the +c K\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0+ mass\na e-mail: jiadj@nwnu.edu.cn (corresponding author)\nspectrum [5] and reconfirms it in the decay channel of +c \u03c0+ [6], with the measured mass 3621.55 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b1 0.30 MeV [7]. This observation sets up, for the first time, a strength scale of interaction between two heavy quarks and is of help to understand the strong interaction among heavy quarks [2,4,8]. For instance, the mass of the ++cc helps to \u201ccalibrate\u201d the binding energy between a pair of heavy quark governed by short-distance interaction. Further more, very recent observation of the doubly charmed tetraquark [9] is timely to examine the assumed interquark (QQ) interaction in hadrons and invite conversely systematic study of the DH baryons. DH baryons have been studied over the years using various theoretical methods such as the nonrelativistic (NR) [4,10\u201312] as well as relativistic [3] quark models, heavy-quark effective theory [13], QCD sum rules [14\u201316], the Feynman\u2013Hellmann theorem [17], mass formula [18], the Skyrmion model [19], the lattice QCD [1,20\u201325] and the effective field theory [8,26,27]. Till now, the features (masses, spin-parity and decay widths) of the DH baryons in their excited states remain to be explored.\nIn this work, we introduce an energy term of heavy-pair binding due to the perturbative dynamics into the Regge relations of heavy hadrons to explore excited doubly heavy baryons with the help of the observed data of the light and heavy mesons, and of the ++cc as well as the ground-state masses of the DH baryons compatible with the measured data. A nonlinear Regge relation for the heavy diquark excitations in DH baryons, endowed with heavy-pair binding is constructed and applied to compute low-lying mass spectra of the excited DH baryons QQ\u2032 and QQ\u2032 (QQ\u2032 = cc, bb, bc), combining with the mass scaling that is tested successfully for the experimentally available mass splittings of the heavy baryons. An agreement with other calculations is achieved and a discussion is given for the excitation modes of the DH baryons in the QCD string picture.\nWe illustrate that the QCD string picture [28], when endowed with the two-body binding energy of the heavy quarks, gives an unified description of the DH baryons in which both aspects of the long-distance confinement and perturbative QCD are included, similar to that of the effective QCD string (EFT) in Ref. [8]. While our approach is semiclassical in nature, it treats quark (diquark) and string dynamically and full relativistically, in contrast with the static(nondynamic) approximation of the heavy quarks in DH baryons in Ref. [8] and of the lattice QCD simulation [1].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we apply linear and nonlinear Regge relation to formulate and estimate the spin-independent masses of the excited DH baryons in the 1S1p, 2S1s and 1P1s waves. In Sect. 3, we formulate the spin-dependent forces and the ensuing mass splitting of the low-lying excited DH baryons in the scheme of the j j coupling. In Sect. 4, we estimate the spin coupling parameters via the method of mass scaling these parameters and compute the excited spectra of the DH baryons. We end with summary and remarks in Sect. 5."

            "text": "We use heavy-diquark\u2013light-quark picture for the DH baryons qQQ\u2032(q = u, d and s) with heavy quarks QQ\u2032 = cc, bb or bc, in which the heavy pair QQ\u2032 can be scalar(spin zero) diquark denoted by [QQ\u2032] or axial-vector(spin-1) diquark denoted by {QQ\u2032}. The charm diquark cc and the bottom diquark bb can only form axial-vector diquark, {cc} or {bb}, while the bottom-charm diquark bc can form both, {bc} or [bc]. We use the notations NDLDnl to label the quantum numbers of the DH baryons, with the value of principal quantum number(ND) of diquark, its orbital momentum(LD) denoted by a capital letter and the principal quantum number(n) for the excitations of light quark and its orbital momentum(l) by a lowercase letter.\nThe mass of a DH baryon qQQ\u2032 consists of the sum of two parts: M = M\u0304 + M , where M\u0304 is the spin-independent mass and M is the mass splitting due to the spin-dependent interaction. As the diquark QQ\u2032 is heavy, compared to the light quark q, the heavy-light limit applies to the DH baryons qQQ\u2032.\n2.1 Low-lying DH baryons with ground-state diquark\nFor a DH baryon with heavy diquark QQ\u2032 in internal S wave, we employ, by analogy with Ref. [29], a linear Regge relation derived from the QCD string model (Appendix A). Basic idea of this derivation is to view the baryon to be a q\u2212QQ\u2032 system of a massive QCD string with diquark QQ\u2032 at one end and q at the other. Denoting by M\u0304l the mass of a DH baryon\nwith orbital angular momentum l of light quark, the Regge relation takes form [29] (Appendix A) (M\u0304l \u2212 MQQ\u2032)2 = \u03c0al + [ mq + MQQ\u2032 \u2212 m2bareQQ\u2032\nMQQ\u2032\n]2 ,\n(1)\nwhere MQQ\u2032 is the effective mass of the S-wave heavy diquark, mq the effective mass of the light quark q, a stands for the tension of the QCD string [28]. Here, mbareQQ\u2032 is the bare mass of QQ\u2032, given approximately by sum of the bare masses of each heavy quark: mbare QQ\u2032 = mbareQ +mbareQ\u2032 . Using the bare data mbare,c = 1.275 GeV, mbare,b = 4.18 GeV, one has numerically,\nmbare cc = 2.55 GeV, mbare bb = 8.36 GeV, mbare bc = 5.455 GeV. (2)\nWe set the values of mq in Eq. (1) to be that in Table 1, which was previously determined in Ref. [29] via matching the measured mass spectra of the excited singly heavy baryons and mesons.\nTo determine MQQ\u2032 in Eq. (1), we apply Eq. (1) to the ground state (l = 0) to find [29]\nM\u0304(1S1s) = MQQ\u2032 + mq + k2QQ\u2032\nMQQ\u2032 , (3)\nkQQ\u2032 \u2261 MQQ\u2032vQQ\u2032 = MQQ\u2032 ( 1 \u2212 m 2 bareQQ\u2032\nM2QQ\u2032\n)1/2 , (4)\nwhich agrees with the mass formula given by heavy quark symmetry [30]. As the experimental data are still lacking except for the doubly charmed baryon ++cc , we adopt the masses (Table 2) of DH baryons computed by Ref. [3], which successfully predicts M( cc, 1/2+) = 3620 MeV, very close to the measured data 3621.55 MeV of the doubly charmed baryon ++cc [5,7].\nWith the mass parameters mq=n (n = u, d) in Table 1 and the average masses M\u0304(1S1s) in Table 2, one can solve Eq. (3) to extract the heavy-diquark mass, with the results\nMcc = 2865.5 MeV, Mbb = 8916.7 MeV, (5) M[bc] = 5891.8 MeV, M{bc} = 5892.3 MeV, (6)\nwhere the subscript cc(bb) stands for the vector diquark {cc} ({bb}) for short. The mean mass of the diquark bc is M\u0304bc = 5892.3 MeV.\nIt is examined in Refs. [29,31] for the singly heavy (SH) baryon families(the c/ c, the c/ \u2032c, the b/ b and the b/ \u2032 b) that the Regge slope of the baryons are almost same for identical flavor constituents, independent of the lightdiquark spin(= 0 or 1). The trajectory slope is found to rely\nTable 1 The effective masses (in GeV) of the quark masses and the string tensions a (in GeV2) of the D/Ds and B/Bs mesons in Ref.

Natively, the string tension a are same for all heavy-light systems, namely, the ratio aD/aB = 1 = aD/aQQ as gluon dynamics is flavorindependent, as implied by heavy quark symmetry and heavy quark-diquark (HQD) symmetry at the leading order [32]. In the real world, the breaking of the HQD symmetry and heavy quark symmetry yields that the ratios aD/aB and aD/aQQ are not unity but depend upon the respective masses (Mc, Mb) and (Mc, MQQ). The requirement that they tend to unity suggests that this dimensionless ratio depends on some functional of the respective dimensionless ratio Mc/Mb and Mc/MQQ . For simplicity, we use a power-law of the mass scaling between the string tensions of the hadrons D/B and QQ\u2032 :\naD aB = ( Mc Mb )P , (7)\naD a QQ\u2032\n= (\nMc MQQ\u2032\n)P . (8)\nHere, the parameters (aD = acn\u0304 , aB = abn\u0304 , Mc and Mb) are previously evaluated in Ref. [29] and listed in Table 1. Putting the tensions and heavy-quark masses in Table 1 into Eq. (7) gives P = 0.185 and thereby predicts, by Eq. (8)\na cc = 0.2532 GeV2, a bb = 0.3123 GeV2, (9) a bc = 0.2893 GeV2 = a \u2032bc , (10)\ncombining with Eqs. (5) and (6). Given the tensions in Eqs. (9) and Eq. (10), and the diquark\nmasses in Eqs. (5) and (6) and the light quark mass in Table 1,\none can use Eq. (1) to obtain the spin-averaged masses of the baryon system QQ\u2032 in p-wave(l = 1). The results are { M\u0304 ( cc, 1p) = 4.0813 GeV, M\u0304 ( bb, 1p) = 10.5577 GeV, M\u0304 ( \u2032bc, 1p ) = 7.3258 GeV, M\u0304 ( bc, 1p) = 7.3269 GeV, }\n(11)\nwhere \u2032bc = n[bc] and bc = n{bc} stand for the bottomcharmed baryons with diquark spin 0 and 1, respectively.\nThe same procedure applies to the strange DH baryons, the QQ\u2032 = sQQ\u2032, and the associated Ds /Bs(= cs\u0304/bs\u0304) mesons, for which the mass scaling, corresponding to Eqs. (7) and (8), has the same form\naDs aBs = ( Mc Mb )P (12)\naDs a QQ\u2032\n= (\nMc MQQ\u2032\n)P . (13)\nPutting the tensions for the strange heavy mesons and the heavy-quark masses in Table 1 to Eq. (12) gives P = 0.202. One can then use Eq. (13) and the heavy-diquark masses in Eqs. (5) as well as (6) to predict\na cc = 0.2860 GeV2, a bb = 0.3596 GeV2, (14) a bc = 0.3308 GeV2 = a \u2032bc , (15)\nwhere \u2032bc and bc stand for the DH baryons with bcdiquark spin 0 and 1, respectively.\nGiven the tensions (includinga QQ\u2032 = anQQ\u2032 ) in Eqs. (14) and (15), and the heavy-diquark masses in Eqs. (5) and (6) as well as the strange quark mass ms = 0.328 GeV in Table 1, one can use Eq. (1) to find the mean (spin-averaged) masses of the baryon system QQ\u2032 in p-waves (l = 1). The results are\n{ M\u0304 ( cc, 1p) = 4.1895 GeV, M\u0304 ( bb, 1p) = 10.6795 GeV, M\u0304 ( \u2032bc, 1p ) = 7.4430 GeV, M\u0304 ( bc, 1p) = 7.4441 GeV, }\n(16)\nwhere \u2032bc = s[bc] stands for the strange baryons bc with scalar diquark [bc] and bc = s{bc} for the bc with axial vector diquark {bc}.\nTo extend the above analysis to radially excited states, one needs a Regge relation to include the radial excitations. For the heavy mesons, this type of Regge relation is proposed in Ref. [33] in consideration that the trajectory slope ratio between the radial and angular excitations is \u03c0 : 2 for the heavy mesons q\u0304 Q in the heavy quark limit. Extending this ratio to the heavy diquark-quark picture of the DH system q \u2212 QQ\u2032 can be done by viewing the system a QCD string tied to the diquark QQ\u2032 as one end and to the light quark q at the other. Then, a Regge relation for the radially and angular excitations follows, via utilizing HQD symmetry to replace heavy quark Q there by the diquark Q\u0304 Q\u0304\u2032 and \u03c0al in Eq. (1) by \u03c0a ( l + \u03c02 n ) , giving rise to [33] ( M\u0304 \u2212 MQQ\u2032 )2 = \u03c0a (l + \u03c0 2 n )\n+ ( mq + MQQ\u2032 \u2212 m2bare QQ\u2032\nMQQ\u2032\n)2 . (17)\nThis gives a linear Regge relation applicable to the DH antibaryons q\u0304 Q\u0304 Q\u0304\u2032, or the DH baryons qQQ\u2032. With the masses of mq in Table 1 and the inputs in Eqs. (2), (5), (6), (9), (10), (14) and (15), one obtains, by Eq. (17), the mean(spin-averaged) masses of the low-lying DH baryons with 1S2s wave. The results are listed in Table 3.\n2.2 The DH baryons with 1P and 2S waves diquark\nConsider excited DH baryons qQQ\u2032 with diquark QQ\u2032 in the internal 1P and 2S waves. The diquark cc or bb has to be in spin singlet (asymmetry) in the internal 1P wave or spin triplet in the internal 2S wave, while bc can be either in the internal 1P or in 2S waves. As treated before, one can decompose the excited baryon mass as M = M\u0304N ,L + ( M)N ,L , where M\u0304N ,L is the spin-independent mass and ( M)N ,L is mass shift(splitting) due to the spin interactions in DH baryons qQQ\u2032.\nFirst of all, we consider excited heavy mesons in 1P and 2S waves in QCD string picture. For an excited heavy quarkonia QQ\u0304, a rotating-string picture [34] in which a heavy quark at one end and an antiquark at the other with relative orbital momentum L , infers a nonlinear Regge relation (M\u03043/2 \u223c L), akin to Eq. (1), M\u0304 = 2MQ + 3 ( T 2L2\n4MQ\n)1/3 . (18)\nOn the other hand, a semiclassical WKB analysis of a system of heavy quarkonia QQ\u0304 in a linear confining potential T |r | leads to a quantization condition for its radial excitations (labeled by N , Appendix B): [ M\u0304 \u2212 2MQ\n]3/2 = 3\u03c0T 4 \u221a MQ (N + 2c0) , (19)\nwith the constant 2c0 the quantum defect. Comparing the radial and angular slopes (linear coefficients in N and L , respectively, which is \u03c0 : \u221a12) of the trajectory in RHS of Eq. (19) and in that of Eq. (18), one can combine two trajectories into (Appendix B)[\nM\u0304N ,L \u2212 2MQ \u2212 B(QQ\u0304)N ,L ]3/2\n= 3 \u221a 3T\n2 \u221a MQ\n( L + \u03c0N\u221a\n12 + 2c0\n) , (20)\nwhere a term of extra energy B(QQ\u0304)N ,L , named heavy-pair binding energy, enters to represent a corrections to the picture of Regge spectra due to the short-distance interquark forces [35] when two heavy quarks (Q and Q\u0304) come close each other. Such a term is ignored in the semiclassical picture of massive QCD string as well as in the WKB analysis (Appendix B). For the ground-state DH hadrons, a similar binding between two heavy quarks in them was considered in Refs. [4,36].\nFor applications in this work, we rewrite Eq. (20) and extend it to a general form in which QQ\u0304\u2032 can be bc\u0304 in flavor (by heavy quark symmetry),\nM\u0304(QQ\u0304\u2032)N ,L = MQ + MQ\u2032 + B(QQ\u0304\u2032)N ,L\n+3 [ T ( L + \u03c0N/\u221a12 + 2c0 )]2/3 [2(MQ + MQ\u2032)]1/3 . (21)\nSetting N = 0 = L in Eq. (21) gives\nT c0(QQ\u0304 \u2032) =\n\u221a 2(MQ + MQ\u2032)\n6 \u221a 3\n\u00d7 [M\u0304(QQ\u0304)1S \u2212 MQ \u2212 MQ\u2032 \u2212 B(QQ\u0304\u2032)1S]3/2 . (22) Substitution of the quark masses (Mc = 1.44 GeV, Mb = 4.48 GeV) into Eq. (22) gives (in GeV2),\nT c0(cc\u0304) = 0.0689 GeV2, T c0(bb\u0304) = 0.4363 GeV2, T c0(bc\u0304) = 0.2136 GeV2, (23) in which we have used the observed data, M\u0304(cc\u0304)1S = 3.06865 GeV, M\u0304(bb\u0304)1S = 9.4449 GeV, M\u0304(bc\u0304)1S = 6.32025 GeV for the ground-state heavy quarkonia and Bc meson in Table 8, and the corresponding binding energies for 1S wave in Table 9,\nB(cc\u0304)1S = 0.25783 GeV2, B(bb\u0304)1S = 0.56192 GeV2, B(bc\u0304)1S = 0.3464 GeV2. (24)\nNow, we consider the DH baryons qQQ\u2032 with excited diquark. In the string picture, one can view the baryon as a Y-shaped string system [Q \u2212 Q\u2032] \u2212 q in which a subsystem of massive (rotating or vibrating) string [Q\u2212Q\u2032] (tied to one heavy quark Q at each end) is connected via a static string to a light quark q at third end. For 1S or 1P wave diquark in a DH baryon labelled by the quantum numbers N and L , respectively, the Regge relation similar to Eq. (21) takes the form (Appendix C),\nM\u0304(QQ\u2032)N ,L = MQ + MQ\u2032 + B(QQ\u2032)N ,L\n+ 3 [ TQQ\u2032 ( (L + \u03c0N/\u221a12) + 2c0 )]2/3 [2(MQ + MQ\u2032)]1/3 + c1, (25)\nwith TQQ\u2032 the tension of string of the subsystem [Q \u2212 Q] and c0 given by Eq. (22). Here, c1 is an additive constant, defined up to the ground state of the whole DH system.\nSince the inverse Regge slope (1/\u03b1\u2032) is derived to scale like \u221a C\u03b1s in Ref. [37], where C is the Casimir operator and equals to 2/3 in a color antitriplet 3\u0304c of the pair QQ\u2032, and 4/3 in a color singlet (1c) of the pair QQ\u0304\u2032, one can write (by 1/\u03b1\u2032 \u223c T )\nTQQ\u2032 [3\u0304c] = 1\u221a 2 TQQ\u0304\u2032 [1c], (26)\nfor the heavy pairs with color configuration indicated. So,\u221a 2TQQ\u2032c0 = TQQ\u0304\u2032c0. Accounting the excitation energy of the baryons, ( M\u0304 (\u2217))N ,L = M\u0304 (\u2217)N ,L \u2212 M\u03040,0, for the energy shift of the subsystem [Q \u2212 Q\u2032] relative to its ground state, one can write this excitation energy due to diquark excitation (TQQ\u0304\u2032 = T given in Eq. (22)) as\nM\u0304 (\u2217)N ,L \u2212 M\u03040,0 = B(QQ\u2032)N ,L\n+3\u221a2 [ T (L + \u03c0N/\u221a12)/2 + T c0 ]2/3 [2(MQ + MQ\u2032)]1/3 +C1, (27)\nwhereC1 is a constant related to c1 and determined by(setting N = 0 = L),\nC1[qQQ\u2032] = \u22123 \u221a 2\n[ (T c0)2 2(MQ + MQ\u2032) ]1/3 ,\nwith B(QQ\u2032)0,0 = 0. From Eq. (27) it follows that the baryon mass shift due to diquark excitations becomes\n( M\u0304 (\u2217))N ,L = B(QQ\u2032)N ,L\n+3\u221a2 [ T (L + \u03c0N/\u221a12)/2 + T c0 ]2/3 \u2212 (T c0)2/3 [2(MQ + MQ\u2032)]1/3 ,\n(28)\nwith T c0 given by Eq. (23). Given the parameters in Eqs. (23), (64) and Tables 1, 2, 9\nand the mean masses of the ground-state baryons cc, bb and bc in Ref. [3], one can apply Eqs. (27) and (28) to find the mean masses of all DH baryons ( cc, bb, bc, cc, bb, bc) with diquark excited radially and angularly. Here, three values (Tcc\u0304, Tbb\u0304, Tbc\u0304) of the tension T in Eq. (28) are obtained in Eq. (64) in Sect. 4 via matching Eq. (21) to the mean-mass spectra and binding energies of the heavy quarkonia and bc\u0304 systems. The results for the mean masses of all DH baryons are shown in Table 3."

Here, l stands for the relative orbital angular momentum of q with respective to QQ\u2032, r\u0302 = r/r is the unity vector of position pointing from the center of mass (CM) of the diquark to the light quark q.\nFor the 1Sns waves of the DH baryons (l = 0), only the last term survives in Eq. (29), in which SQQ\u2032 \u00b7 Sq has the eigenvalues {\u22121, 1/2} when SQQ\u2032 = 1. The mass splitting for the systems q{QQ\u2032} becomes (J = 1/2, 3/2),\nM(q{QQ\u2032}) = c(q{QQ\u2032}) [\u22121 0\n0 1/2\n] . (30)\nFor the 1Snp waves of the bottom charmed baryons bc and bc with zero diquark spin Sbc = 0, the spin interaction (29) yields the mass splitting (J = 1/2, 3/2),\nM(q[QQ\u2032]) = a1(q[QQ\u2032]) [\u22121 0\n0 1/2\n] . (31)\nFor the case of excited(2S or 1P wave) diquark QQ\u2032, a correction to Eq. (29) emerges due to the interaction between the diquark and light quark, given by\nHdSD = c\u2217(L + SQQ\u2032) \u00b7 Sq , (32) where the diquark spin SQQ\u2032 = 1 (S wave of diquark) or 0 (P wave) when QQ\u2032 = cc or bb. This correction stems from the interaction of the effective magnetic moments eQQ\u2032(L+ SQQ\u2032)/(2MQQ\u2032) of the excited diquark and the spin magnetic moment eqSq/mq of the light quark q. Here, L is the internal orbital angular moment of the diquark, eQQ\u2032 and eq stand for the respective charges of diquark and light quark.\nFor the bc-diquark for which QQ\u2032 = [bc] or {bc}, the spin S[bc] = 0 in internal S wave and S[bc] = 1 in internal P wave by the symmetry of the baryon states q[bc] and q{bc}. Also, S{bc} = 1 in internal S wave and S{bc} = 0 in internal P wave. For the baryon q[bc], Jd = L \u2295 SQQ\u2032 = {0} in S wave of diquark or {0, 1, 2} in P wave of diquark, while for the baryon q{bc}, Jd = L \u2295 SQQ\u2032 = {1} in the 2S and 1P wave of the diquark.\n3.1 The 1p wave DH baryons with S wave diquark\nConsider now the excited (1p) DH baryon in which light quark is excited to 1p wave (l = 1) relative to QQ\u2032. Note that coupling Stot = 1/2 to l = 1 gives the states with the total angular momentums J = 1/2, 3/2, while coupling Stot = 3/2 to l = 1 leads to the states with\nJ = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2. We use then the LS basis 2Stot+1PJ = {2P1/2,2 P3/2,4 P1/2,4 P3/2,4 P5/2} to label these multiplets in p-wave (J = 1/2, 1/2\u2032, 3/2, 3/2\u2032 and 5/2). The two J = 1/2 states are the respective eigenstates of a 2\u00d72 matrices MJ representing HSD for J = 1/2 and 3/2. In terms of the basis [2PJ ,4 PJ ], they can be given by the matrix [40,41] (see Appendix D also) MJ=1/2 = [ 1 3 (a1 \u2212 4a2) \u221a 2 3 (a1 \u2212 a2)\u221a 2\n3 (a1 \u2212 a2) \u2212 53 ( a2 + 12a1\n) ]\n+ b [ 0 \u221a 2 2\u221a\n2 2 \u22121\n] + c [\u22121 0 0 12 ] , (33)\nin the J = 1/2 subspace, MJ=3/2 = \u23a1 \u23a3\u2212 23 ( 14a1 \u2212 a2) \u221a 5\n3 (a1 \u2212 a2)\u221a 5\n3 (a1 \u2212 a2) \u2212 23 ( 1 2a1 + a2 ) \u23a4 \u23a6\n+ b [ 0 \u2212 \u221a 5 10\n\u2212 \u221a\n5 10 4 5\n] + c [\u22121 0 0 12 ] , (34)\nin the J = 3/2 subspace, and by\nMJ=5/2 = 1 2 a1 + a2 \u2212 b 5 + c 2 , (35)\nfor the J = 5/2. One can verify that the spin-weighted sum of the eigenvalues of these matrices over J = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2 is zero:\u2211 J (2J + 1)MJ = 0, (36)\nas it should be for the spin-dependent interaction HSD . In the heavy quark limit (MQ \u2192 \u221e), all terms except for the first (= a1l \u00b7 Sq ) in Eq. (29) behave as 1/MQQ\u2032 and are suppressed. Due to heavy quark spin symmetry (SQQ\u2032 conserved), the total angular momentum of the light quark j = l + Sq = J \u2212 SQQ\u2032 is conserved and forms a set of the conserved operators {J, j}, where J is the total angular momentum of the DH hadrons. We use then the j j coupling scheme to label the spin multiplets of the DH baryons, denoted by the basis |J, j\u3009(Appendix D), in which the spin of diquark QQ\u2032 decouples and l \u00b7 Sq becomes diagonal. As such, the formula for mass splitting M can be obtained by diagonalizing a1l \u00b7 Sq and treating other interactions in Eq. (29) perturbatively.\nThe eigenvalues (two diagonal elements) of l \u00b7 Sq can be obtained to be \u2329 l \u00b7 Sq \u232a = 1 2 [ j ( j + 1) \u2212 l(l + 1) \u2212 Sq ( Sq + 1\n)] = \u22121( j = 1/2) or 1/2( j = 3/2). (37)\nTable 4 The matrix elements of the mass splitting operators in the p-wave doubly heavy baryons states in the j j coupling\n(J, j)\n\u2329\nl \u00b7 SQQ\u2032\n\u232a \u3008S12\u3009 \u2329Sq \u00b7 SQQ\u2032 \u232a\n(1/2, 1/2) \u22124/3 \u22124/3 1/3 (1/2, 3/2) \u22125/3 1/3 \u22125/6 (3/2, 1/2) 2/3 2/3 \u22125/6 (3/2, 3/2) \u22122/3 2/15 \u22121/3 (5/2, 3/2) 1 \u22121/5 1/2\nThus, one can compute mass splitting M(J, j) = \u2329J, j \u2223\u2223HSD\u2223\u2223 J, j \u232a in the j j coupling via three steps: Firstly, one solves the eigenfunctions(the LS bases)\n\u2223\u2223SQQ\u20323, Sq3, l3\u232a of the l\u00b7Sq for its eigenvalues j = 1/2 and 3/2 in the LS coupling; Secondly, one transforms the obtained LS bases into |J, j\u3009 in the j j coupling (Appendix D); Finally, one evaluates the diagonal elements of the spin-interaction in Eq. (29) in the new bases |J, j\u3009. The results for M(J, j) are listed in Table 4.\nGiven Table 3, one can use the lowest perturbation theory to find\nM(1/2, 1/2) = \u2212a1 \u2212 4 3 a2 \u2212 4 3 b + 1 3 c, (38) M(1/2, 3/2) = 1 2 a1 \u2212 5 3 a2 + 1 3 b \u2212 5 6 c, (39) M(3/2, 1/2) = \u2212a1 + 2 3 a2 + 2 3 b \u2212 1 6 c, (40) M(3/2, 3/2) = 1 2 a1 \u2212 2 3 a2 + 2 15 b \u2212 1 3 c, (41) M(5/2, 3/2) = 1 2 a1 + a2 \u2212 1 5 b + 1 2 c, (42)\nwhich express the baryon mass splitting in p wave in terms of four parameters (a1, a2, b, c). The mass formula for the 1S1p states is then M(J, j) = M\u0304(1S1p)+ M(J, j), with M\u0304(1S1p) the spin-independent masses given in Eqs. (11) and (16) in Sect. 2.\n3.2 The DH baryons with 2S and 1P wave diquark\nIn the heavy diquark-quark picture in this work, diquark QQ is fundamentally two body system connected by string and can be excited internally. In this subsection, we consider the spin interaction due to the 2S and 1P wave excitations of diquark in DH baryons.\n(1) The 2S1s states. In this state, L = 0 and the spininteraction (32) reduces to HSD(2S) = c\u2217SQQ\u2032 \u00b7Sq , in which SQQ\u2032 \u00b7 Sq has the eigenvalues {\u22121, 1/2} for the spin of total system J = 1/2 or 3/2, respectively. Note that we occasionally use 2S to stand for 2S1s for short. Here, the excited baryon energy stems from the spin interaction HSD(2S) as well as the string energy shift ( M\u0304 (\u2217))2S given in Eq. (28).\nThus, the mass splitting for the 2S1s wave baryons q{QQ\u2032} becomes(J = 1/2, 3/2), M(q{QQ\u2032})2S = ( M\u0304 (\u2217))2S\n+c\u2217(q{QQ\u2032}) [\u22121 0\n0 1/2\n] . (43)\nIn the case of 2S1s wave DH system q[bc], no mass splitting happens since L = 0 = S[bc], namely, the baryon mass is simply M\u0304(q[bc])nS .\n(2) The 1P1s states. For the systems q{cc}, q{bb} and q{bc}, SQQ\u2032 = 0 and the system spin J = L \u2295 1/2 takes values J = 1/2 and 3/2. The spin interaction becomes c\u2217L \u00b7 Sq , which equals to c\u2217diag[\u22121, 1/2]. So, the baryon mass splitting is(J = 1/2, 3/2),\nM(q{QQ\u2032})1P = ( M\u0304 (\u2217))1P + c\u2217 [\u22121 0\n0 1/2\n] . (44)\nFor the systems q[bc], SQQ\u2032 = 1, and Jd = L \u2295 SQQ\u2032 can take values Jd = 0, 1 or 2 so that J = 1/2, 1/2\u2032, 3/2, 3/2\u2032, 5/2. Labelling the DH baryon systems by |J, Jd\u3009, the relation Jd \u00b7 Sq = [J (J + 1) \u2212 Jd(Jd + 1) \u2212 3/4]/2 yields the mass splitting matrix for the P wave multiplets,\nM(q[bc])1P =( M\u0304 (\u2217))1P+c\u2217diag [\n0,\u22121, 1 2 ,\u22123 2 , 1\n] ,\n(45)\nin the subspace of {|J, Jd\u3009} = {|1/2, 0\u3009, |1/2, 1\u3009, |3/2, 1\u3009, |3/2, 2\u3009, |5/2, 2\u3009}."

            "text": "To evaluate spin coupling parameters in Eq. (38) through Eq. (45) for the excited DH baryons, we utilize, in this section, the relations of mass scaling, which apply successfully to the SH hadrons [29,38]. For this, we list, in Table 5, the experimentally matched values of the spin couplings (data before parentheses) for the existing heavy-light systems, such as the Ds in Refs. [29,38] and the SH baryons (the Q / \u2032Q / Q , with Q = c, b) in Ref. [31].\n4.1 The 1p wave baryons with 1S wave diquark\nBefore considering DH baryons, let us first examine the mass scaling of the spin couplings between heavy baryons Qqq \u2032 and heavy mesons (e.g., the Ds = cs\u0304). In Refs. [29,38], a relation of mass scaling is explored based on Breit\u2013Fermi like interaction [42,43], and is given by [29] (see Eqs. (22\u201324))\nlqq \u2032 \u00b7 Sqq \u2032 : a1 [ Qqq \u2032 ] = Mc MQ \u00b7 ms mqq \u2032 \u00b7 a1 (Ds) , (46)\nwhere lqq \u2032 and Sqq \u2032 denote the orbital angular momentum of light diquark qq \u2032 relative to the heavy quark Q and the spin of the light diquark, respectively, mqq \u2032 is the diquark mass and MQ the heavy-quark mass in the SH hadrons. The factor Mc/MQ enters to account for the heavy quark dependence. In Eq. (48) , the extra recoil factor 1/ ( 1 + mqq \u2032/ms ) enters to take into account the correction due to comparable heaviness between the diquark qq \u2032 and the strange quark. Note that a similar (recoil) factor, 1/ ( 1 + mqq \u2032/Mc ) , entering Eq. (47), has been confirmed for the charmed and bottom baryons in P-wave and D-wave [29]. For instance, Eq. (47) in Ref. [29] (Eq. (60)) well reproduces the measured masses 6146.2 MeV and 6152.5 MeV of the b(6146) and the b(6152) observed by LHCb [44]. Similar verifications were demonstrated in Ref. [31] for the excited c discovered by LHCb [45], for which the ss-diquark is comparable with the charm quark in heaviness.\nPutting the parameters in Table 1 and the light diquarks in Table 5 to Eqs. (46)\u2013(48), one can estimate the parameters a1, a2 and b for the heavy baryons Q , the \u2032 Q and the c. In Table 6, we list the obtained results within parentheses so that they are comparable with that (data before parentheses) matched to the measured data in Ref. [31]. Evidently, the mismatch shown is small: a1 \u2264 2.63 MeV, a2 \u2264 5.19 MeV and b \u2264 2.80 MeV, and agreement is noticeable.\nConsider the DH baryons with S-wave diquark now. Regarding mass scaling between the DH baryons(QQq) and\nthe heavy mesons(Qq\u0304), the heavy diquark-antiquark(HDA) duality or symmetry(QQ \u2194 Q\u0304) in Refs. [32,46,47] suggests that two hadrons share the same chromodynamics in the heavy quark limit(MQ \u2192 \u221e) up to a color factor. In the real world where MQ is finite, this symmetry(duality) breaks and the dynamics degenerates to a similar dynamics which mainly depends on the similarity(asymmetric) parameter MQ/MQQ . As two heavy quarks in diquark QQ\u2032 moves in relatively smaller region (\u221d 1/MQ), compared to the DH baryon (\u221d 1/mq ), the string structure of the q\u2212QQ\u2032 resembles that of the heavy meson Ds , one naturally expects that similar relations of mass scaling apply to the coupling parameters in Eq. (29) for the DH baryons.\nReplacing MQ in Eqs. (46)\u2013(48) by the diquark mass MQQ\u2032 , and the mass of the light diquark mass mqq \u2032 by that of the light quark, one obtains\na1[QQ\u2032q] = Mc MQQ\u2032 \u00b7 ms mq \u00b7 a1 (Ds) , (49)\na2[QQ\u2032q] = Mc MQQ\u2032 \u00b7 1 1 + mq/Mc \u00b7 a2 (Ds) , (50)\nb[QQ\u2032q] = Mc MQQ\u2032 \u00b7 1 1 + mq/ms \u00b7 b (Ds) . (51)\nSince the hyperfine parameter c \u221d |\u03c8B(0)|2/(MQQ\u2032mq), scales as hadron wavefunction |\u03c8B(0)|2 near the origin, it should be small in p-wave. One can write a relation of mass scaling relative to the singly charmed baryon c = css as below: c[QQ\u2032q] = (\nMc MQQ\u2032 )( mss mq ) c ( c) . (52)\nExperimentally, there exists five excited c\u2019s discovered by LHCb [45], with the masses 3000.4 MeV, 3050.2 MeV, 3065.6 MeV, 3095.2 MeV and 3119.2 MeV. Assigning the five states to be in p-wave and matching the j j mass formula to the five measured masses lead to [31,40]\nc ( c) = 4.07 MeV, mss = 991 MeV. (53) Now, one can employ Eqs. (49)\u2013(52) to estimate the four\nparameters of spin couplings of the DH baryons using the parameters in Table 1 and the diquark masses in Eqs. (5), (6) and that in Eq. (53). The results are listed collectively in Table 7. As seen in table, the parameter a2 are smaller (three times roughly) but comparable to a1. The magnitudes of b is as large as a2 roughly while c is the smallest. This\nagrees qualitatively with the parameter hierarchy of the spincouplings [29,31] implied by heavy quark symmetry.\nWith a1(Ds) = 89.4 MeV in Table VI [38], one can employ the relations of mass scaling (49) relative to the Ds to give a1( bc) = ( 1.440 GeV\n5.8918 GeV\n)( 0.328 GeV\n0.230 GeV\n) a1(Ds)\n= 31.14 MeV, a1( bc) = ( 1.440 GeV\n5.8918 GeV\n) a1(Ds)\n= 21.84 MeV, (54)\nwhere M[bc] = 5.8918 GeV and other mass parameters are from Table 1. Putting above parameters into Eq. (31), and adding M\u0304L( bc, bc) in Eqs. (11) and (16), one obtains the Pwave masses M\u0304L( bc, bc)+ M( bc, bc) for the baryons bc and bc(with scalar diquark bc and J P = 1/2\u2212, 3/2\u2212) to be M ( bc, 1/2\n\u2212) = 7294.7 MeV, M ( bc, 3/2\u2212) = 7341.4 MeV, (55)\nM ( bc, 1/2 \u2212) = 7421.2 MeV, M ( bc, 3/2\u2212) = 7453.9 MeV. (56)\nWe list all masses of the DH baryons in their 1S1p-wave in Tables 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, with comparison with other predictions cited. These masses are also shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the respective states of the DH baryons. Our computation suggests that the 1S1p states of the DH baryons have increasing masses with baryon spin J rising from the lowest 1/2\u2212 to highest 5/2\u2212.\n4.2 The 2s and 1s wave baryons with 1S wave diquark\nWe consider first the DH baryons qQQ\u2032 with excited diquark QQ\u2032 in internal 2S waves and then examine the DH baryons in ground state. As two spin-states of the D mesons are estab-\nlished in 1s and 2s waves experimentally, we shall use the mass scaling relative to the D mesons.\nIn 2s wave(n = 1), two D mesons are the D0(2550)0 with mass 2549 \u00b1 19 MeV and the D\u22171(2600)\u00b10 with mass 2627 \u00b1 10 MeV [48]). The mass scaling relative to the D mesons, inspired by Breit\u2013Fermi like interaction [42,43], can be given by c ( QQ\u2032u ) 2s = ( Mc\nMQQ\u2032\n) c (D)2s . (57)\nIt follows (c(D)2s = mass splitting of the heavy mesons) that\nc ( bb(bbu)) = (\nMc Mbb\n) [ M(D(2s), 1\u2212)) \u2212 M (D(2s), 0\u2212)]\n= 12.6 MeV, c ( bb(bbs))\n= (\nMc Mbb )( mu ms ) [ M(D(2s), 1\u2212) \u2212 M (D(2S), 0\u2212)]\n= 8.8 MeV.\nFurther application of mass scaling between the DH baryons, c ( cc)2s = c ( bb) ( Mbb Mcc ) , c ( bc)2s\n= c ( bb) ( Mbb Mbc ) ,\nc ( cc)2s = c ( bb) ( Mbb Mcc ) , c ( bc)2s\n= c ( bb) ( Mbb Mbc ) , (58)\nleads to the following parameter c for the 2s-wave baryons cc, bc, cc and cc,\nc( cc)2s = 39.2 MeV, c ( bc)2S = 19.1 MeV,\nc( cc)2s = 27.4 MeV, c ( bc)2s = 13.3 MeV. (59)\nWith the mean(2s) masses in Table 3, one can employ Eq. (30) to compute the 2s-wave(namely, the 1S2s-wave) masses of the DH baryons. The results are listed in Table 10 through Table 16, with comparison with other calculations, and also shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively.\nIt is of interest to apply the same strategy to the ground states to check if one can reproduce the masses in Table 2. For the 1s wave cc firstly, the c value can be scaled to that of the ground state D mesons with mass difference\nm(D\u2217(2010)+) \u2212m(D+) = 140.6 MeV [48] via mass scaling:\nc ( cc)1s = c (D)1s (\nMc Mcc\n)\n= (140.6 MeV) ( 1.44\n2.8655 ) = 70.7 MeV.\nFor the cc, the relevant meson for scaling is the groundstate Ds meson with mass difference m(D\u2217\u00b1s ) \u2212 m(D\u00b1s ) = 143.8 MeV [48], and the c value is then\nc ( cc)1s = c (Ds)1s (\nMc Mcc\n)\n= (143.8 MeV) ( 1.44\n2.8655 ) = 72.3 MeV.\nUsing M\u0304(qQQ\u2032)1s = MQQ\u2032 +mq +MQQ\u2032v2QQ\u2032 given by Eq. (3) with v2QQ\u2032 \u2261 1\u2212m2bareQQ\u2032/M2QQ\u2032 and Eq. (30), one can use the c values above to give\n(1/2, 3/2)+ : M( cc)1s = 3691.7 + 70.66 {\u22121, 1/2} = {3620.8, 3726.8} MeV, (1/2, 3/2)+ : M( cc)1s = 3789.5 + 72.3 {\u22121, 1/2} = {3717.2, 3825.7} MeV,\nwhere the mean mass (3691 MeV and 3789.5 MeV) in the 1s wave (v2cc = 0.208) are obtained for the systems q{cc} and the two numbers in curly braces correspond to the respective states with J P = 1/2+ and 3/2+.\nFurther, similar calculation applying to the 1s wave bb and bb gives c ( bb)1s = c (D)1s (\nMc Mbb\n)\n= (140.6 MeV) ( 1.44\n8.9167 ) = 22.7 MeV,\nc ( bb)1s = c (Ds)1s (\nMc Mbb\n)\n= (143.8 MeV) ( 1.44\n8.9167 ) = 23.2 MeV,\nand the ground state masses (with v2bb = 0.121)\n(1/2, 3/2)+ : M( bb)1s = 10226 + 22.7 {\u22121, 1/2} = {10203.3, 10237.4} MeV, (1/2, 3/2)+ : M( bb)1s = 10324 + 23.2 {\u22121, 1/2} = {10301.8, 10335.6} MeV,\nwhere M\u0304(q{bb})1S = Mbb + mq + Mbbv2bb = 10226.0 (10324.0) MeV have been used for q = n(or s).\nFinally, for the DH systems q(bc), there are three ground states, bc = n{bc} with J P = 1/2+ and 3/2+, \u2032bc = n[bc] with J P = 1/2+, and three ground states bc = s{bc} with J P = 1/2+ and 3/2+, \u2032bc = s[bc] with J P = 1/2+. Notice that v2bc = 0.1428(0.1429) for the diquark {bc}([bc]), one finds, by Eq. (3), the mean masses for them to be\nM\u0304(n{bc})1s = M{bc} + mn + M{bc}v2bc = 6964.3 MeV,\nM\u0304(s{bc})1s = M{bc} + ms + M{bc}v2bc = 7062.3 MeV,\nM\u0304(n[bc])1s = 6963.0 MeV, M\u0304(s[bc])1S = 7061.0 MeV,\nand the c parameter to be c ( bc)1s = c (D)1s (\nMc M{bc}\n)\n= (140.6 MeV) ( 1.44\n5.9823 ) = 33.8 MeV,\nc ( bc)1s = c (Ds)1s (\nMc M{bc}\n)\n= (143.8 MeV) ( 1.44\n5.9823 ) = 34.6 MeV.\nThe ground state masses of the baryons bc and bc are then\n(1/2, 3/2)+ : M( bc)1s = 6964.3 + 33.8 {\u22121, 1/2} = {6930.5, 6981.2} MeV, (1/2, 3/2)+ : M( bc)1s = 7062.3 + 34.6{\u22121, 1/2} = {7027.7, 7079.6} MeV,\n1/2+ : M( \u2032bc)1s = 6963.0 MeV, M( \u2032bc)1s = 7061.0 MeV,\nwith the two numbers in curly braces corresponding to J P = 1/2+ and 3/2+, respectively. Our predictions for the groundstate masses of the most DH baryons ( QQ\u0301\u2032 ) are in consistent with that by Ref. [3].\n4.3 Heavy pair binding and effective masses of excited diquarks\nWe first explore and extract binding energies of heavy pairs in DH baryons and then compute the effective masses of heavy\ndiquarks in its excited states. The later is done via estimating the energy shifts due to diquark excitations.\nIn QCD string picture, one simple and direct way to extract heavy pair binding is to use the \u201chalf\u201d rule for the shortdistance interaction of the QQ\u0304\u2032 systems and to subtract from the hadron masses of the QQ\u0304\u2032 systems (short string plus binding energy plus 2MQ) all involved (heavy and light) masses and string energies of mesons, leaving only the binding energy between Q and Q\u0304\u2032. The relation for the QQ\u0304\u2032 systems is\nB(QQ\u0304\u2032)N ,L = M\u0304(QQ\u0304\u2032) \u2212 M\u0304(Qn\u0304) \u2212 M\u0304(Qn\u0304\u2032)+M\u0304(nn\u0304\u2032), (60)\nin which M\u0304 represents the mean(spin-averaged) masses of the respective mesons formed by the quark pairs QQ\u0304\u2032, Qn\u0304 and nn\u0304\u2032(n = u, d). The experimental mean-mass data [48] for these mesons are shown collectively in Table 8, where the mean (1S) masses of the cc\u0304 system, for instance, are M\u0304(cc\u0304)1S = [3M(J/\u03c8) + M(\u03b7c)]/4 = 3068.65 MeV, M\u0304(cn\u0304)1S = [3M(D\u2217) + M(D)]/4 = 1973.23 MeV, M\u0304(nn\u0304\u2032)1S = [3M(\u03c1) + 154]/4 = 619.98 MeV.\nGiven the data in Table 8, the binding energy of the heavy quark\u2013antiquark is calculable by Eq. (60). In the case of QQ\u2032 = cc\u0304, Eq. (60) gives\nB(cc\u0304)1S = M\u0304(cc\u0304)1S \u2212 2M\u0304(cn\u0304)1S + M\u0304(nn\u0304\u2032)1S, = 3068.65 \u2212 2(1973.23) + 619.98, = \u2212257. 83 MeV, (61)\nwhere we have used the computed 1S-wave mass 154.0 MeV of the pion in Ref. [49], instead of the observed (very light) mass of the physical pion, for which an extra suppression mechanism (Nambu\u2013Goldstone mechanism) enters due to the breaking of chiral symmetry. Note that the Nambu\u2013 Goldstone mechanism for the heavy quarkonia is ignorable and not comparable with that of the physical pion. With the 1S wave data of the respective bottomonium, the B meson and M\u0304(nn\u0304\u2032)1S = 619.98 MeV in Table 8, one can similarly estimate B(bb\u0304) via Eq. (60). The results are listed in Table 9.\nFor the pair bc\u0304, only the 1S and 2S wave mesons(the Bc) are available for M\u0304(bc\u0304) experimentally, and they give, by Eq. (60),\nB(bc\u0304)1S = M\u0304(bc\u0304)1S \u2212 M\u0304(bn\u0304)1S \u2212 M\u0304(c\u0304n)1S + M\u0304(nn\u0304)1S, = 6320.3 \u2212 5313.4 \u2212 1973.2 + 619.98, = \u2212346.4 MeV,\nin which M\u0304(bc\u0304)1S is estimated by the mean mass of the measured M(Bc, 0\u2212)1S = 6274.5 MeV and the predicted mass splitting M(Bc)1S = 61 MeV between the 1\u2212 and 0\u2212 states\nby Ref. [50]:\nM\u0304(bc\u0304)1S = 1 4 [6274.5 + 3 \u00d7 (6274.5 + M(Bc)1S)]\n= 6320.3 MeV. For 2S wave bc\u0304, one can use the measured 2S-wave mass M(Bc, 0\u2212)2S = 6871.2 MeV of the Bc meson and the predicted mass splitting M(Bc)2S = 40 MeV by Ref. [50] to get\nM\u0304(bc\u0304)2S = 1 4 [6871.2 + 3 \u00d7 (6871.2 + M(Bc)2S)] = 6901.2 MeV, and thereby to find\nB(bc\u0304)2S = 6901.2 \u2212 5917.0 \u2212 2607.5 + 1423.7 = \u2212199.6 MeV,\nwhere M\u0304(cn\u0304)2S = 2607.5 MeV [48], and M\u0304(bn\u0304)2S = 5917.0 MeV, taken from the predicted mean mass [33] of the B mesons in 2S-wave. Similarly, one can find B(cc\u0304)2S = \u2212117.3 MeV and B(bb\u0304)2S = \u2212392.98 MeV, as shown in Table 9.\nFor the Bc meson, no data in P wave is available. We estimate it via interpolating the P wave masses of the cc\u0304 and bb\u0304 systems which are known experimentally. Inspired by atomic spectra in a purely Coulombic potential, we write the binding energy B(QQ\u0304\u2032) as a power form of the reduced pair mass \u03bcQQ\u2032 = MQMQ\u2032/(MQ + MQ\u2032) [36,51], B(QQ\u0304\u2032) \u2212 B0 = k[\u03bcQQ\u2032 ]P = k ( MQMQ\u2032 MQ + MQ\u2032 )P , (62)\nwhere B0 are a constant while the parameters k = kN ,L and P = PN ,L depend on the radial and angular quantum numbers of the excited QQ\u0304\u2032. In the ground(1S1s) state, the binding B(cc\u0304) = \u2212257.83 MeV, B(bb\u0304) = \u2212561.92 MeV and B(bc\u0304) = \u2212346.40 MeV in Table 9 correspond, by Eq. (62), to the parameters {B0 = 62.066 MeV, P0,0 = 0.58805, k0,0 = \u2212388.342}.\nWhen QQ\u0304\u2032 excited to the 1P wave, substitution of the measured mean masses of the charmonium and bottomonium in Table 8 into Eq. (60) leads to,\nB(cc\u0304)1P = \u2212100.38 MeV, B(bb\u0304)1P = \u2212328.81 MeV.\nOne can then interpolate these two binding energies via Eq. (62) to predict (for the bc\u0304 system) P0,1 = 0.77365, k0,1 = \u22120.209448, and further gives, by Eq. (62),\nB(bc\u0304)1P = B0 + B(cc\u0304)1P \u2212 B0[(1 + 1.44/4.48)/2]P0,1 ,\n= 62.066 + \u2212100.377 \u2212 (62.066)[(1 + 1.44/4.48)/2]0.773645\nBinding energy 1S 2S 1P B(2S) B(1P)\nB(cc\u0304) \u2212257.83 \u2212117.30 \u2212100.38 140.53 157.45 B(bb\u0304) \u2212561.92 \u2212392.98 \u2212328.81 168.94 233.11 B(bc\u0304) \u2212346.40 \u2212199.55 \u2212161.78 146.85 184.32 B(cc) \u2212128.92 \u221258.65 \u221250.19 70.27 78.73 B(bb) \u2212280.96 \u2212196.49 \u2212164.41 84.47 116.55 B(bc) \u2212173.20 \u221299.78 \u221280.89 73.43 92.32\n= \u2212161.78 MeV, (63)\nas shown in Table 9. For the heavy quark\u2013antiquark pairs {cc\u0304, bb\u0304, bc\u0304}, three\nvalues of string tension T that reproduce, by Eq. (21), the mean masses in Table 8 and the binding energies in Table 9, are given by\n{T (cc\u0304), T (bb\u0304), T (bc\u0304)} = {0.21891, 0.43367, 0.34278} GeV2. (64) Next, we consider binding energy B(QQ\u2032) of heavy quark pair QQ\u2032 in the color antitriplet(3\u0304c). In a baryon qQQ\u2032, such a binding enters as a correction to energy of the QCD string connecting Q and Q\u2032 in short-distance, as indicated by heavyquarkonia spectra [48]. By color-SU (3) argument and by lattice simulations in Ref. [52], the QQ\u2032 interaction strength in a color triplet is half of that of the QQ\u0304\u2032 in a color singlet when the interquark(QQ) distance is small. One can then write, as in Ref. [4],\nB(QQ\u2032) = 1 2 B(QQ\u0304\u2032), (65)\nwith QQ\u0304\u2032 in color singlet(1c). Relative to the ground states(1S1s), the shift BN ,L \u2261 B(QQ\u2032)N ,L \u2212 B(QQ\u2032)0,0 of the binding energy are, by Eq. (65),\nB(QQ)N ,L = 1 2 [B(QQ\u0304\u2032)N ,L \u2212 B(QQ\u0304\u2032)0,0]. (66)\nUsing the binding data for the QQ\u0304\u2032 in Table 9, Eqs. (65) and (66) give all binding shifts B(QQ\u0304) for the 2S and 1P states, and all binding shifts B(QQ\u2032) for the 2S and 1P states, as listed collectively in Table 9.\nWith the binding data in Table 9, and the values of T in Eq. (64), Eq. (28) gives rise to the mean-mass shifts of the DH baryons due to the (2S and 1P) diquark excitations relative to their ground states(1S1s),\n{ M\u0304 (\u2217)( cc), M\u0304 (\u2217)( bb), M\u0304 (\u2217)( bc)}2S = {393.56, 347.02, 365.97} MeV, (67)\n{ M\u0304 (\u2217)( cc), M\u0304 (\u2217)( bb), M\u0304 (\u2217)( bc)}1P = {430.87, 404.39, 412.27} MeV, (68)\nand the same values for the cc\u2032 , bb\u2032 and bc\u2032 . This enables us to define effective masses EQQ\u2032 of heavy-diquark in its excited state via the energy shift due to diquark excitations:\n(EQQ\u2032)N ,L = MQQ\u2032 + ( M\u0304 (\u2217))N ,L , which gives explicitly, with the usage of Eqs. (5), (6), (67) and (68),\n(Ecc, Ebb, Ebc)2S = {3.2591, 9.2637, 6.2583} GeV, (69) (Ecc, Ebb, Ebc)1P = {3.2964, 9.3211, 6.3046} GeV. (70)\n4.4 Spin couplings due to diquark excitations\nLet us consider the 2S1s and 1P1s states of the DH baryons. For the spin couplings of the baryon multiplets, we utilize the mass scaling relative to the ground state D mesons (the D\u00b1 with mass 1869.66\u00b10.05 MeV and the D\u2217(2010)\u00b1 with mass 2010.26 \u00b1 0.05 MeV [48]),\nc\u2217 ( bb(bbq))2S,1P = (\nMc (Ebb)2S,1P )( mn mq ) c (D)1S ,\n(71)\nin which c (D)1S = M(D\u2217\u00b1) \u2212 M ( D\u00b1 ) = 140.6 MeV (that corresponds to the contact-term) for the D mesons, as Ref. [29].\n(1) The 2S1s states. Using data in Eqs. (67) and (68), Eq. (71) leads to c\u2217 ( bb(bbn))2S = ( Mc Ebb ) (140.6 MeV) = 21.86 MeV, c\u2217 ( bb(bbs))2S = ( Mc Ebb )( mn ms ) (140.6 MeV)\n= 15.33 MeV, (72)\nwhere (Ebb)2S = 9.2637 GeV. Further application of the following scaling relations between the doubly charmed and bottom baryons c\u2217 ( cc)2S = c\u2217 ( bb) ( Ebb Ecc ) ,\nc\u2217 ( bc)2S = c\u2217 ( bb) ( Ebb Ebc ) ,\nc\u2217 ( cc)2S = c\u2217 ( bb) ( Ebb Ecc ) ,\nc\u2217 ( bc)2S = c\u2217 ( bb) ( Ebb Ebc ) , (73)\ngives\nc\u2217 ( cc)2S = 62.12 MeV, c\u2217 ( bc)2S = 32.35 MeV, c\u2217 ( cc)2S = 43.56 MeV, c\u2217 ( bc)2S = 22.69 MeV. (74)\nGiven the masses in Table 2 and the mean masses of the ground-state baryons cc, bb and bc in Ref. [3], M\u0304 (\u2217) in Eq. (67) and the values of c\u2217 in Eqs. (72) and (73), one gets, by Eq. (43), the multiplet masses of the DH baryons QQ\u2032 and QQ\u2032 in the 2S1s state, listed in Table 10 through 16, and shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively.\n(2) The 1P1s states. Application of the mass scaling Eq. (71) leads to(Ebb = 9.3211 GeV) c\u2217 ( bb)1P = ( Mc Ebb ) (140.6 MeV) = 21.72 MeV, c\u2217 ( bb)1P = ( Mc Ebb )( mn ms ) (140.6 MeV)\n= 15.23 MeV, (75)\nand c\u2217 ( cc)1P = c\u2217 ( bb)1P ( 9.3211\n3.2964 ) = 61.42 MeV,\nc\u2217 ( bc)1P = c\u2217 ( bb)1P ( 9.3211\n6.3046 ) = 32.31 MeV,\nc\u2217 ( cc)1P = c\u2217 ( bb)1P ( 9.3211\n3.2964 ) = 43.07 MeV,\nc\u2217 ( bc)1P = c\u2217 ( bb)1P ( 9.3211\n6.3046 ) = 22.66 MeV. (76)\nGiven the masses in Table 2 and the mean masses of the ground-state baryons cc, bb and bc in Ref. [3], M\u0304 (\u2217) in Eq. (68) and the c\u2217 values in Eqs. (75) and (76), one can apply Eqs. (44) and (45) to obtain the mean mass M\u03041P+( M\u0304 (\u2217))1P and the multiplet masses of the 1P1s-wave DH baryons. The results are listed in Table 10 through 16 and shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, for the 2S1s and 1P1s states of the DH baryons.\nWe collect all obtained masses of the DH baryons, which are computed via summing of the spin averaged masses(M\u0304) in Sect. 3 and the mass splitting M in Sect. 4, in Tables 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. The ground state masses obtained in Sect. 4 are also listed there."

            "text": "In this work, we combine methods of Regge trajectory for spin independent mass and mass scaling for the spindependent interaction, which is based on chromodynamics similarity among heavy hadrons, to explore excited doubly heavy baryons QQ\u2032 and QQ\u2032 in the picture of heavydiquark-light-quark. The low-lying masses of the excited doubly-heavy baryons are computed up to 2S and 1P waves of the light quark and heavy diquark internally, and compared to other calculations. Two Regge trajectories, one linear and the other nonlinear and endowed with an extra binding of heavy quark pair, are employed to describe the respective excitations of the light quark and diquark, which are derived semiclassically from the QCD string model and tested successfully against the observed heavy baryons and mesons. The heavy-pair binding are extracted from the excitation energies of heavy diquarks phenomenologically and incorporated into Regge relation, by which effective masses of excited diquarks are estimated and mass scaling is constructed.\nOur mass analysis suggests (see Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) that the mean mass-level spacings M\u0304 of heavy diquark excitations are generally narrower than that of light-quark excitations. This is due to the scale separation of excitations stemming from the adiabatic expansion between the heavy and light-quark dynamics: M\u0304 \u223c 1/\u221amq is larger than M\u0304 \u223c 1/\u221aMass(QQ). Meanwhile, it seems (see Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) that the mass splitting of spin multiplets of the excited DH baryons are wider for the diquark excitations than for the excitation of light quarks, which remain to be explained in the further explorations. We hope the oncoming experiments like LHCb and Belle to examine our predictions for the excited DH resonances addressed.\nThe binding function Eq. (62), inspired by atomic spectra, mimic the nonrelativistic spectra of a system of heavy quark and antiquark bounded by the Coulomb-like force of single gluon exchange. In a purely Coulombic potential V (r) = \u2212(4/3)\u03b1s/r , the energy levels En = \u2212[(4/3)\u03b1s]2\u03bc/(2n2) (n = nr + L + 1) depends linearly on the reduced mass \u03bc of system. In a quarkonia or the heavy meson Bc, Eq. (62) holds qualitatively as B0 may also depend weakly on the\nFig. 2 Mass spectrum (in MeV) of the bb baryons, corresponding to the Table 11\nFig. 3 Mass spectrum (in MeV) of the bc baryons, corresponding to the Table 12. The horizontal dashed line shows the bD threshold\nquantum numbers (N , L) and upon the effective mass of the quarks [35,36,51]. So, the prediction in Eq. (63) for the 1Pwave binding B(bc\u0304) and ensuing 1P-wave mass calculations of the baryon bc and bc are of approximated (uncertain within 10 MeV roughly).\nLow-energy QCD interaction is known to be involved in many aspects, especially in excited hadrons, and there exist various approaches exploring the excited doubly heavy baryons [3,10,12,53\u201357]. The relations of Regge trajectory employed in this work are established phenomenologically and rooted in the underlying interaction of QCD. Some remarks and discussions are in order:\n(i) For the DH baryons with 1S-wave diquark, the Regge trajectory stems from excitation of the light quark q which moves relativistically and is away from the heavy masscenter of diquark most of time. The short-distance interaction and binding energy between the heavy diquark and the light quark q is small and ignorable, especially for excited states. In this case, the linear Regge relation applies as in Eq. (1), without including binding term.\n(ii) When diquark of DH baryons excited, an improved (nonlinear) Regge relation entails a correction due to extra heavy-pair binding, as in Eqs. (21) and (25), since the heavy-pairs in hadrons are deep in attractive\nCoulomb-like potential. This is supported by the energy drop(roughly half or 1/3) of the extracted binding of the 2S and 1P wave baryons relative to the ground state, as indicated by Table 9 phenomenologically.\n(iii) While the mass predictions for excited DH baryons in this work is by no means rigorous, our estimation of the baryon spin-multiplet splitting is general in that mass scaling employed is based on chromodynamics similarity between heavy baryons and heavy mesons. The parameterized spin-dependent interactions Eqs. (29) and (32) is built generally according to Lorentz structure and tensor nature of interaction [41,42].\nProducing and measuring the DH baryons in the e+e\u2212, p p\u0304, or pp collisions require simultaneous production of two heavy quark\u2013antiquark pairs and subsequent searches among the final states to which DH baryons decay. A heavy quark Q from one pair needs to coalesce with a heavy quark Q\u2032 from the other pair, forming together a color antitriplet heavy diquark QQ\u2032. The heavy diquark QQ\u2032 then needs to pick up a light quark q to finally hadronize as a DH baryon QQ\u2032q. To search experimental signals of the DH baryons, it is useful to check the baryon\u2019s decay modes which are easier to detect. One way is to examine the strong decay processes like QQ\u2032 \u2192 Q\u03c0 and QQ\u2032 \u2192 Q\u03c1(\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 ), which are explored in [61,62]. The other way is to check the decay modes with two-lepton in their final states, e.g., the semileptonic decays. We list the estimated lifetimes (except for ++cc and +cc for which we use the experimental values) of the DH baryons and some notable branching fractions (Br , all from most recent computation [62]) in the channel of semi-leptonic decay:\n++cc = ccu: \u03c4 = 256 \u00b1 27 fs [48], Br( ++cc \u2192 +c l\u03bdl) = 4.99%, Br( ++cc \u2192 \u2032+c l\u03bdl) = 5.98%; +cc = ccd: \u03c4 < 33 fs [48], Br( +cc \u2192 0cl\u03bdl) = 1.65%, Br( +cc \u2192 \u20320c l\u03bdl) = 1.98%; +bc = bcu: \u03c4 = 244 fs [4], Br( +bc \u2192 0bl\u03bdl) = 2.3%, Br( +bc \u2192 ++cc l\u03bdl) = 1.58%; 0bc = bcu: \u03c4 = 93 fs [4], Br( 0bc \u2192 \u2212b l\u03bdl) = 0.868%, Br( 0bc \u2192 +bccl\u03bdl) = 0.603%; 0bb = bbu: \u03c4 = 370 fs [4], Br( 0bb \u2192 +bcl\u03bdl) = 2.59%, Br( 0bb \u2192 \u2032+bcl\u03bdl) = 1.15%; \u2212bb = bbd: \u03c4 = 370 fs [4], Br( \u2212bb \u2192 0bcl\u03bdl) = 2.62%; 0bc = bcs: \u03c4 = 220 fs [61], Br( \u2212bc \u2192 \u2212b l\u03bdl) = 6.03%; \u2212bb = bbs: \u03c4 = 800 fs [61], Br( \u2212bb \u2192 0bcl\u03bdl) = 4.81%.\nThe more details of branching fractions in other channels can be found in Refs. [62,63] and reference therein. We hope the upcoming experiments (and data analysis) at LHC,\nBelle II and CEPC can test our mass computation of the DH baryons in this work.\nAcknowledgements Y.

We define the effective (dynamical) masses of the heavy diquarks and the light quark in the CM frame of the baryon by\nMQQ\u2032 = mbareQQ \u2032\u221a 1 \u2212 v2QQ\u2032 , mq = mbareq\u221a 1 \u2212 v2q .

(A6)\nAs the diquark QQ\u2032 is very heavy and moves nonrelativistically in hadrons, vQQ is small in the limit of heavy quark(mbareQQ\u2032 \u2192 0). A series expansion of Eq.

            "text": "(1) Quantization condition for heavy quarkonia QQ\u0304 Consider a heavy quarkonia QQ\u0304 (at a distance of r ) in a linear confining potential T |r | for which the system Hamiltonian is HQQ\u0304 = 2 \u221a p2 + M2Q + T |r |. Here, we have ignored the short-distance interaction. In the frame of center-of-mass, the heavy quark Q moves equivalently in a confining potential T x , with x = r/2, and then the Hamiltonian for Q as a half system of the quarkonia QQ\u0304, becomes\nHQ = 1 2 HQQ\u0304 = \u221a p2x + l2q/x2 + M2Q + T |x |. (B1)\nUsing the semiclassical WKB analysis upon Eq. (B1) for the radial excitations(lq = 0), one has a WKB quantization condition [64],1 2 \u222b x+ x_ px (x)dx = 2\u03c0(N + c0), (B2) with px (x) = |px | = \u221a\n[(E(Q) \u2212 T |x |)2 \u2212 M2Q], x+ = (E(Q) \u2212 MQ)/T = \u2212x\u2212 the classical \u201cturning points\u201d, N the radial quantum number, c0 a constant. Here, E(Q) is the semiclassical value of HQ , and the factor 2 before the integral in Eq. (B2) arises from underlying spinor nature of a quark whose wave function returns to original value after double cycle of journey in the position space [33]. Assuming Q to be in S wave(moving radially), integration of Eq. (B2) gives\n\u03c0(N + c0) = E(Q) 2\nT \u00d7 [\u221a 1 \u2212 B2 + B2 ln (\n1 \u2212 \u221a1 \u2212 B2 B\n)] ,\n(B3)\nwith B \u2261 MQ/E(Q). Above result is only for the half system. Transforming to the whole system of quarkonia by mapping E(Q) \u2192 E/2 and N \u2192 N/2 [64], Eq. (B3) gives(B \u2192 B\u0303 = 2MQ/E) 2\u03c0T (N + 2c0) = E2 [\u221a 1\u2212 B\u03032+ B\u03032 ln ( 1\u2212 \u221a\n1 \u2212 B\u03032 B\u0303\n)]\nE1/2 [ 4 \u221a 2\n3 E3/2 3/2 \u2212 7\n\u221a 2 15 E3/2 5/2 + O( 7/2)\n]\n(B4)\nwhere \u2261 1 \u2212 B\u0303 = 1 \u2212 2MQ/E , which is small in heavy quark limit and E = 2MQ/(1 \u2212 ) 2MQ . Thus, Eq. (B4)\n1 It is written as \u222b x+ x\u2212 p(x)dx = \u03c0N in the cited literature.\nleads to, to the leading order of , 3\u03c0T (N + 2c0) = 4 \u221a MQ(E \u2212 2MQ)3/2,\nwhich gives Eq. (19). (2) Improved(nonlinear) Regge relation Rewriting in a typical form of standard trajectory,(\nM\u0304 \u2212 const.)3/2 \u223c quantum numbers, for the heavy quarkonia system, the Regge relation Eq. (18) in Ref. [34] becomes ( M\u0304 \u2212 2MQ )3/2 = 3 \u221a 3\n2 \u221a MQ T L . (B5)\nComparing the radial and angular slopes(linear coefficients in N and L) in RHS of Eqs. (19) and (B5), which is \u03c0 : \u221a12, one can combine two equations into one unified form: [ M\u0304N ,L \u2212 2MQ ]3/2 = 3 \u221a 3T\n2 \u221a MQ\n( L + \u03c0N\u221a\n12 + 2c0\n) . (B6)\nIn the derivation [34] of Eq. (18) and that of Eq. (19) shown in Appendix Eq. (B1), the linear confining interaction between Q and Q\u0304 is assumed, with the short-distance force between them ignored. As the short-distance force is required for low-lying quarkonia system and violates the typical linear trajectory in Eq. (B6), one way out is to assume that the short-distance attractive force between Q and Q\u0304 in the color-singlet(1c) would provide an extra(negative) energy B(QQ\u0304)N ,L to the spectra of the QQ\u0304 system and to deduct B(QQ\u0304)N ,L (named the binding energy) from the hadron mass M\u0304N ,L in Eq. (B6) so that the LHS of Eq. (B6) becomes the remaining string energy solely: (M\u0304N ,L \u2212 2MQ)3/2 \u2192 (M\u0304N ,L \u2212 B(QQ\u0304)N ,L \u22122MQ)3/2. In doing so, the arguments by the classical string picture [34] and that in Eq. (1) given above remain valid and the formula Eq. (B6) remains intact formally up to a replacement M\u0304N ,L \u2192 M\u0304N ,L \u2212 B(QQ\u0304)N ,L . This gives rise to Eq. (20).\nThe binding energy B(QQ\u0304)N ,L (in the excited states |N , L\u3009 of system) depends on the quantum numbers(N , L) of the system considered [36] and thereby violates the linearity of the Regge relations Eqs. (B5) and (19). Normally, such a term is negative since when two quarks(Q and Q\u0304) are heavy enough to stay close each other, they both experiences an attractive Coulomb-like force of single gluon exchange, as the observed heavy-quarkonia spectra [48] of the cascade type indicated."

As such, the excitation of the heavy subsystem [Q\u2212Q] in color antitriplet(3\u0304c) with string tension TQQ resembles the excitation of a heavy quarkonia QQ\u0304 in color singlet(1c) with string tension T up to a color(strength) factor of string interaction which is taken to be half commonly. Based on this similarity, one can write the excitation energy of the heavy system, by analogy with Eq.
