    "abstractText": "Magneto-Mechanical transmitters offer a compact and low-power solution for the generation of ultralow-frequency (ULF) magnetic signals for through-ground and throughseawater communications. Resonant arrays of smaller magnetomechanical transmitters are particularly interesting in this context as the physical scaling laws allow for the increase of operating frequency and reduce the power requirements for ULF signal generation. In this work, we introduce a generalized model for accurate prediction of frequency and mode shape in generalized magneto-mechanical resonator arrays (MMRAs) that account for near-field magnetic interactions as well as magnetically induced nonlinearity. Using experiments, we demonstrate that our predictive capability is significantly improved compared against simplified dipole approximations. We additionally model the eddy current losses internal to the array and find that they are in agreement with experimental observations.",

INTRODUCTION\nRADIO frequency communications are among the mostimportant technologies today and are deployed in an extremely wide range of applications. Unfortunately, RF communications cannot be used in conductive environments, e.g., for undersea and through-ground transmission, due to the extremely low skin depth at frequencies above a few kilohertz. On the other hand, electromagnetic signals at ultralow frequencies (ULFs, 0.3\u20133 kHz) exhibit significantly greater skin depth and are therefore used for low-bandwidth underground communication via inductive coils [1] and for submarine communications at great technical expense [2], [3], [4]. The biggest challenges with ULF systems are the significant power requirement [2], [3] and the need for large antenna structures that cannot be easily transported [4]. Recently, an innovative approach has emerged for the ULF transmitter challenge [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], in which the large\nManuscript received 15 June 2022; revised 28 December 2022; accepted 5 January 2023.

The generated field is nonradiating and should be considered in a quasi-static manner. It has been shown that this approach can reduce the transmitter power requirements from a few megawatts to tens of watts and the transmitter size from a few kilometers to tens of centimeters [5], [6]. Similar promising solutions using magnetomechanics have also been proposed for improvements in ULF receivers [13], [14], [15].\nInterestingly, the scaling laws for such magneto-mechanical systems reveal that, instead of using one large magnetomechanical oscillator, subdivision of the magnetic dipole to an array of smaller oscillators provides a major scaling advantage for increasing frequency and for reducing the power requirements [5], [6]. At the same time, the technical complexity of the system does increase since we now must consider the mutual magnetic interactions within the array. Even though there is an increase in the degrees of freedom, only the mechanically synchronized mode (i.e., the in-phase mode) is of interest since it has the highest resonant frequency and produces the largest magnetic signal [5], [6]. Presently, however, the models for frequency prediction and power consumption for magneto-mechanical resonators are not sufficiently advanced, especially in the context of the complexity added by mutual interactions in arrays, near-field effects, eddy current loss, and nonlinearity.\nIn this article, we generalize this problem for a magnetomechanical resonator array (MMRA) that is magnetically actuated by a single drive coil. We present a general dynamical model for MMRAs that account for the near-field magnetic interactions between the oscillator elements. This model also reveals, quite surprisingly, that the commonly used coil drive mechanism is responsible for additional interaction terms between the array elements that have not previously been modeled. Using this, we demonstrate that the model\u2019s frequency prediction capability is significantly improved in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We additionally develop a simplified analytical model for estimating the eddy current loss in MMRAs, without reliance on complex finite-element simulations, and verify the numerical calculations by making a comparison to experimental measurements."

The equation of motion for the nth rotor is given by the second-order ordinary differential equation (in the undamped form)\nJn \u03b8\u0308 r, n = \u03c4sus, n +\nall rotors\u2211\ni i \u0338=n\n\u03c4r, ni +\nall stators\u2211\nj\n\u03c4s, nj + \u03c4ext, n (1)\nwhere Jn is the moment of inertia of the rotor, \u03b8r, n is the instantaneous angle relative to the x\u0302-axis [see Fig. 1(a)], \u03c4sus, n is the restoring torque associated with the mechanical suspension, \u03c4r, ni and \u03c4s, nj are the magnetic torques generated due to interaction with a different i th rotor and the j th stator, respectively, and \u03c4ext, n is the torque generated by external sources (e.g., the drive coil). In this work, we assume that the suspension has linear characteristics, and therefore, \u03c4sus, n = \u2212\u03basus, n \u03b8r, n , where \u03basus, n is the torsional stiffness constant.\nThe simplest expressions for the magnetically induced torques \u03c4r, ni and \u03c4s, nj can be obtained by approximating each magnetic moment as a point dipole. Using this \u201cdipole model,\u201d we derive [see (A1) in Appendix A] the interaction torque\n\u03c4r, ni = \u2212 \u00b50mr, i mr, n 4\u03c0 |dni |3 [ 2 cos(\u03b8r, i ) sin(\u03b8r, n)\n+ cos(\u03b8r, n) sin(\u03b8r, i ) ] (2)\nwhere \u00b50 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22127 H/m is the vacuum permeability, mr, i and mr, n are the magnitudes of the magnetic dipole moments of the i th and nth rotors, respectively, and dni is the center-to-center distance between the dipoles. This dipole model is often used [5], [6], [16], [17] to study the resonances of magneto-mechanical systems. However, as the distance between the rotors decreases, this model becomes a poor predictor of the MMRA dynamics due to near-field effects. As we show later, the discrepancy between the frequency prediction and measured resonance becomes quite significant for most magnetomechanical transmitters [5], [6] that have compactness as a design goal.\nIn order to better predict the magnetic interactions, we develop a new model (details in Appendix A) that considers the complete volume of each interacting magnetic element in the system. We find that this approach is far better at accounting for near-field effects and results in a more accurate frequency prediction. In the most general form and without any small angle approximation, the interaction torque \u03c4r, ni (generated by the i th rotor on the nth rotor) can be written as (see Appendix A)\n\u03c4r, ni = \u2212 [ \u03ba (1) r, ni cos(\u03b8r, i + \u03b8r, n) + \u03ba (2) r, ni sin(\u03b8r, i ) cos(\u03b8r, n)\n+\u03ba (3) r, ni cos(\u03b8r, i ) sin(\u03b8r, n)\n] (3)\nwhere \u03ba (1)r, ni , \u03ba (2) r, ni , and \u03ba (3) r, ni are the torsional stiffness coefficients. These stiffness coefficients are all functions of the instantaneous angle \u03b8r, i and \u03b8r, n and further depend on the relative geometry and individual cross section of the interacting rotors. Presently, we can simplify our analysis using the assumption that rotors are cylindrical with a circular cross section and find that \u03ba (2)r, ni and \u03ba (3) r, ni become independent of\n\u03b8r, i or \u03b8r, n , and \u03ba (1) r, ni becomes zero [see (A8) and (A11) in Appendix A]. Similarly, the general form of the interaction torque \u03c4s, nj can be expressed as\n\u03c4s, nj = \u2212 [ \u03ba (1) s, nj cos(\u03b8s, j + \u03b8r, n) + \u03ba (2) s, nj sin(\u03b8s, j ) cos(\u03b8r, n)\n+\u03ba (3) s, nj cos(\u03b8s, j ) sin(\u03b8r, n)\n] (4)\nwhere \u03b8s, j is the angle of the j th stator relative to the x\u0302-axis [see Fig. 1(a)], and \u03ba (1)s, nj , \u03ba (2) s, nj , and \u03ba (3) s, nj are positive stiffness coefficients. Again, in the special case where cylindrical rotors are rotating about their longitudinal axes, and stators are symmetric about the x\u0302-axis, we find that \u03ba (2)s, nj and \u03ba (3) s, nj are constants and \u03ba (1)s, nj is zero. For application as magneto-mechanical transmitters [5], [6] or wireless power transfer devices [13], [14], an MMRA is typically actuated using a drive coil [Fig. 1(b)]. Remarkably, we will show that this coil-based drive is responsible for additional coupling terms between the component oscillators that modify the dynamics of the MMRA but have not been modeled previously. We can express the external torque, \u03c4ext, n , generated by the coil on the nth rotor with the expression [5]\n\u03c4ext, n = 0ncos(\u03b8r, n)Ic (5)\nwhere Ic is the instantaneous coil current and 0n is the lumped coupling coefficient between the coil and the nth rotor that accounts for the magnetization and relative geometry of the rotor and coil. Each rotor simultaneously generates a back electromotive force (EMF) across the coil that can be expressed as [5]\nEn = \u22120ncos(\u03b8r, n)\u03b8\u0307 r, n. (6)\nIn a simplified case where the magnetic field generated by the coil at the nth rotor is uniformly distributed across the body\nof the rotor, the coupling coefficient can be expressed as\n0n = Br, n Vn\n\u00b50 |Bc, n| |Ic|\n(7)\nwhere Br, n is the residual flux density of the nth rotor, Vn is its volume, Bc, n is the magnetic flux density generated by the coil [in the y\u0302-direction shown in Fig. 1(b)] at the nth rotor due to the coil current Ic. For simplicity, we model the coil as an ideal inductor and can write the differential equation (in the undamped unforced form)\nLc d Ic dt =\nall rotors\u2211\ni\nEi = \u2212\nall rotors\u2211\ni\n0i cos(\u03b8r, i ) \u03b8\u0307 r, i . (8)\nTherefore, when \u03b8\u0307 r, i \u0338= 0\nIc = \u2212\nall rotors\u2211\ni\n0i Lc sin(\u03b8r, i ). (9)\nSubstituting (9) into (5), we can get\n\u03c4ext, n = \u22120ncos(\u03b8r, n)\nall rotors\u2211\ni\n0i Lc sin(\u03b8r, i ). (10)\nFrom (10), we can see that the presence of the coil adds indirect coupling terms between all rotors.\nWe can now explore the linear and nonlinear dynamics of the MMRA system. In the absence of any stators, all rotors will self-align in the same direction at equilibrium since this is the minimum energy configuration (in Fig. 1 this corresponds to the \u00b1x\u0302 vector direction). Typically, in a magneto-mechanical transmitter [5], [6], all stators are set at \u03b8s = 0 so that the torsional magnetic stiffness for the rotors is maximized. In the following analysis, we will accordingly fix the angular position of all stators to \u03b8s = 0. Other configurations can be studied using the same general method.\nTo study the dynamics of the MMRA, we expand (3), (4), and (10) using the Taylor expansion\n\u03c4r, ni\n= \u2212 ( \u03ba\n(2) r, ni\u03b8r, i + \u03ba (3) r, ni\u03b8r, n \u2212 1 2 \u03ba (2) r, ni\u03b8r, i , \u03b8 2 r, n\n\u2212 1 2 \u03ba (3) r, ni\u03b8 2 r, i\u03b8r, n \u2212 1 6 \u03ba (2) r, ni\u03b8 3 r, i \u2212 1 6 \u03ba (3) r, ni\u03b8 3 r, n ) + H.O.T .

(13)\nFor analytical simplicity, we ignore the higher order terms (H.O.T .) that are greater than order 3. Later, we will show that the resonance estimations are quite close to experimental reality even without these terms."

            "text": "In the previous analysis, we considered only the first-order terms in the equation of motion. As oscillation amplitude increases, however, the effect of the H.O.T . becomes significant and will modify the dynamics of the system. To understand the role of nonlinearities on the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of an MMRA, we can apply the first-order harmonic balance method [18]. Here, we consider \u03b8r, n as a single harmonic function\n\u03b8r, n = \u03b1n cos(\u03c9t) (18)\nwhere \u03b1n is the oscillation amplitude of the nth rotor and \u03c9 is the angular frequency.

            "heading": "III. EDDY CURRENT LOSSES INTRINSIC TO AN MMRA",
            "text": "In the above analysis, we are able to ignore losses associated with damping mechanisms as they do not, to leading order, modify the resonances or eigenmodes of the MMRA. However, these systems do have multiple sources of damping, which include various mechanical losses as well as eddy current damping. Typically, the dominant damping mechanism is associated with the mechanical suspensions for the rotors [5], [6] and has been extensively discussed elsewhere [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Eddy current damping originating from the time-varying magnetic fields and the moving conducting ferromagnetic materials (N52 neodymium alloy) also appears in MMRAs but is relatively unexplored. In particular, for MMRAs that have compactness as a design goal, the eddy current effect becomes quite significant. Here, we adopt an equivalent circuit approach [24], [25] to study the nature of this eddy current damping, and additionally show that the eddy current losses can be well-estimated with a simplified model, without reliance on complex finite-element simulations.\nSince time-varying magnetic fields produce eddy current loops within conductors, a coil-based circuit model [Fig. 2(a)] is routinely adopted, with the induced current being modeled as the result of an effective potential across the coil. This\neffective induced voltage in the circuit can be expressed as\nve = \u2212 d(Bext Ae)\ndt (23)\nwhere Bext is the external magnetic flux density and Ae is the effective area of the equivalent circuit. The effective area depends on the geometry of the conductor in the direction along the magnetic field. If the time variation is harmonic, the instantaneous eddy current loss can be generally expressed as\nPe = v2e Re\nR2e + (\u03c9b Le)2 (24)\nwhere \u03c9b is the angular frequency of the external magnetic flux density and Re and Le are the effective resistance and inductance of the coil model, respectively. These effective parameters also depend on the geometry. In the context of MMRAs, we are typically only concerned with operation at the ULF (0.3\u20133 kHz) range [5], [6] or below. Therefore, we may employ the quasi-static approximation such that \u03c92b L 2 e \u226a R 2 e , and the eddy current loss can be simplified as purely resistive\nPe = v2e\nRe . (25)\nAs we will show later, this quasi-static assumption can provide a fairly good estimation of the eddy current loss in MMRAs operating at ULF.\nA conducting object, e.g., a rotor or stator, within the MMRA experiences a time-varying magnetic flux density that can be decomposed into Bx x\u0302 and By y\u0302 components in the\ninertial reference frame. We can therefore consider the conducting object as two coils with perpendicular normal vectors. During operation, some conducting objects, e.g., rotors, will have time-varying angular positions resulting in time-varying effective area Ae, which may complicate the analysis. We can reduce this complexity by defining a new coordinate system X\u0302 and Y\u0302 as the co-moving frame of reference of the object, as shown in Fig. 2(b), such that the effective loop areas do not vary in time. Since we can choose the object frame in the direction where the effective parameters of current loops are convenient, we allow for an initial at-rest angle \u03c6 between the object frame and the inertial frame. In this object frame, the magnetic flux density permeating the conductor BX X\u0302 + BY Y\u0302 can be expressed as\nBX = Bx cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) + By sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6) (26) BY = By cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6) \u2212 Bx sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6) (27)\nwhere \u03b8 is the instantaneous rotation angle of the object in the inertial frame. The instantaneous eddy current loss in each circuit (in the X\u0302 and Y\u0302 direction) can now be expressed as\nPe, X/Y = v2e, X/Y\nRe, X/Y = A2e, X/Y Re, X/Y B\u03072X/Y . (28)\nAs stated previously, the coefficients (A2e,X/Y /Re,X/Y ) are effective properties for the current loop model and therefore depend on the geometry along the corresponding directions. For a cylindrical conducting object, the eddy current loss coefficient along its radial direction can be analytically derived from [26] and written as (see details in Appendix B)\nA2e Re = 128 \u03c03\n\u03c3a2b3 \u2211\ni\n1 (2i + 1)4 J2(ma) J0(ma) + J2(ma) (29)\nwhere \u03c3 is the conductivity, a is the radius, b is half of the length, and J0 and J2 are the Bessel functions of the first kind, i = 0, 1, . . ., and m = ((2i + 1)\u03c0/2b). For a cuboidal conducting object, the eddy current loss coefficient along the corresponding surface normal vector can also be analytically derived from [27] and written as (see details in Appendix B)\nA2e Re = \u03c3d2t 12 Vcub (30)\nwhere dt is the thickness along the corresponding direction and Vcub is the volume of the cuboidal conducting object. For other arbitrary geometries of the rotors, it is more convenient to find the eddy current loss coefficient using a numerical simulation or from an experiment. In particular, in simulation (or experiment), we can apply a uniform time-varying magnetic flux density B(t) = Bo cos(\u03c9bt), where Bo is a constant, passing through the conductor along the direction in which we are interested in finding the eddy current loss coefficient. According to (23) and (25), the time-varying eddy current loss would be of the form Pe(t) = Po sin2(\u03c9bt), where Po is a constant under the quasi-static approximation and can be found in simulation (or experiment). We can then obtain the eddy current loss coefficient in that direction by computing\nA2e Re = Po \u03c92b B2o . (31)\nWe note, for the sake of improved accuracy, that the magnetic flux density permeating each conducting object within the MMRA is not spatially uniform, but it can be analytically/numerically estimated with some modest effort [see (A3) in Appendix A]. We can, however, make a simplification here by averaging the magnetic flux density along the desired vector direction across the entire object and then using it as an equivalent uniform local value. This average magnetic flux density on the nth rotor in the x\u0302- and y\u0302-directions can be generally expressed as (see Appendix A)\nBx, n =\nall rotors\u2211\ni i \u0338=n\n[ b(1)r, ni cos(\u03b8i ) + b (2) r, ni sin(\u03b8i ) ]\n+\nall stators\u2211\nj\n[ b(1)s, nj cos(\u03b8 j ) + b (2) s, nj sin(\u03b8 j ) ] (32)\nBy, n =\nall rotors\u2211\ni i \u0338=n\n[ b(2)r, ni cos(\u03b8i ) + b (3) r, ni sin(\u03b8i ) ]\n+\nall stators\u2211\nj\n[ b(2)s, nj cos(\u03b8 j ) + b (3) s, nj sin(\u03b8 j ) ] (33)\nwhere b(1), b(2), and b(3) are coefficients that are functions of angles and further depend on the geometry of the rotors and stators. Again, in the special case where cylindrical rotors are rotating about their longitudinal axes and stators are symmetric about the x\u0302-axis (with stator magnetization \u03b8s = 0), we find that b(1) and b(3) become constants, and b(2) becomes zero [see (A7) and (A8) in Appendix A]. Therefore, we can rewrite a simplified form of (32) and (33) as\nBx, n =\nall rotors\u2211\ni i \u0338=n\nb(1)r, ni cos(\u03b8i ) +\nall stators\u2211\nj\nb(1)s, nj (34)\nBy, n =\nall rotors\u2211\ni i \u0338=n\nb(3)r, ni sin(\u03b8i ). (35)\nThe average magnetic flux density in the stators can be analytically found following the same general method."

Using the same receiver configuration, we calibrate the coil independently of the MMRAs and can subtract the phasor field generated by the coil from the total phasor field measured at the receiver to get the phasor field generated by the MMRAs.

Since we expect softening nonlinear behavior, in which resonant frequencies decrease with increasing amplitude, we perform sweeps with decreasing drive frequency to fully capture the softening characteristic.\nExperimentally, we observe the softening characteristic in both MMRAs as predicted. Using (22) (with the values of parameters from Table VI in Appendix C), we can analytically estimate the oscillation amplitude of each rotor as a function\nof the resonant frequency. With the support of (A5)\u2013(A7) in Appendix A, we can then predict the amplitude of the net magnetic field generated at the receiver as a function of the resonant frequency, including the nonlinear softening effect,\nwhich gives us the \u201cbackbone curves\u201d shown in Fig. 4. We find that there is very good agreement between the analytical model and the experimental data, except for a slight frequency offset. In Table I, we summarize the measured resonant frequencies at low amplitude (linear regime) and compare them to the analytical linear resonant frequencies estimated using our improved analytical model presented in Section II-A and the less accurate dipole model described in (2). Notably, the dipole model greatly overestimates (83% for the single-rotor MMRA prototype and 171% for the multirotor MMRA prototype) the linear resonant frequency of MMRAs since it fails to consider the shape and near-field effects of magnetic oscillators. The resonant frequencies of these MMRA prototypes found using our improved analytical model, on the other hand, are in very close agreement (around 0.2% for both prototypes) with those measured in experiments. Therefore, it is clear that this analytical model tremendously improves our predictive capabilities for MMRAs, especially in the regime where the spacing between adjacent magnetic oscillators is comparable to their cross section. As the spacing increases, however, the dipole model will become more accurate (see Appendix D).\nFor the multirotor MMRA, we can additionally predict the oscillation mode shape of the in-phase mode as a function of the resonant frequency in the nonlinear regime (see Appendix E). Here, we see that the mode shape distributes a little more evenly across the resonators as the oscillation amplitude increases, which is advantageous for power considerations [5]."

In both simulations, rotors are modeled as oscillating relative to the reference frame so that we can use a ready-made physics interface for rotating machinery to model the oscillation of rotors.\nSince we are trying to estimate the fraction of the measured average power consumption that is contributed by the eddy currents within the MMRAs, in the simulation, we apply prescribed sinusoidal angular motions on the rotors in accordance with the experimental results. For the single-rotor MMRA, we choose the experimental result at the experimental resonant frequency at 463.1 Hz [Fig. 4(a)]. The experimental oscillation amplitude of the rotor (provided in Table II) is estimated from the magnetic field experimentally measured at the receiver with the support of (A5)\u2013(A7) in Appendix A. For the multirotor MMRA, we choose the experimental result at the experimental resonant frequency at 532.8 Hz [Fig. 4(b)]. The oscillation mode shape for this multirotor case is similarly analytically estimated (as described in Section II-B and Appendix E), which can be used in conjunction with the magnetic field measured at the receiver, to estimate the oscillation amplitude for each rotor (see Table III). We simulate both MMRAs for one period of oscillation to calculate the average eddy current loss in each conductor in the MMRAs.\nAs described in Section III, the simplified eddy current loss model relies on the eddy current loss coefficient A2e/Re associated with each conducting object. While (29) and (30) model this coefficient explicitly for a cylindrical conductor along the radial direction and a cuboidal conductor along the corresponding surface normal vector, which are the cases for the rotors and stators in our prototypes, respectively, we can alternatively use the method described alongside (31) to numerically estimate this eddy current loss coefficient for an arbitrary geometry conductor. In Tables IV and V, we calculate the eddy current loss coefficients for the cylindrical rotors and cuboidal stators, as used in our MMRA prototypes, using both the analytical methods as well as the numerical approach. For both rotors and stators used in our prototypes, we find that the eddy current loss coefficient estimations from the analytical methods are very well matched to the estimations from the numerical method. As discussed in (29), the eddy current loss coefficient for a cylindrical rotor is quadratically proportional to its radius and cubically proportional to its length. Similarly, as discussed in (30), the eddy current loss coefficient for a cuboidal stator is quadratically proportional to its thickness in the corresponding direction and linearly proportional to its volume. Therefore, to reduce the eddy current loss in MMRAs, the best options are to either use thinner and shorter, or even laminated, rotor and stator magnets. Moreover, since eddy current losses depend on the material conductivity, switching to nonconductive ferrite magnets as rotors and stators could also significantly reduce the total power loss. However, since the remanence of ferrite magnets is typically more than three times smaller than that of neodymium magnets [28], this change will decrease both the mechanical resonant frequency as well as the magnetic field signal produced by the magnetomechanical transmitter.\nTables II and III compare the numerically and analytically estimated average eddy current loss in all conductors in both MMRAs. As shown in Tables II and III, the eddy current loss estimations are in good agreement for each conductor (within 7% for rotors). The slight discrepancies arise from the fact that in the simplified model, we assume that the magnetic field generated by one magnet on another is uniform, which is less valid as the magnets become closer to each other. In both single-rotor and multirotor MMRAs, we find that most of the eddy current loss occurs in the rotors. Moreover, most of the\neddy current loss occurs in the rotors that are closer to the center since they experience a larger magnetic field generated by the other magnets and also undergo oscillation with a larger amplitude.\nIn our experiments, we find that the average power consumption in the single-rotor MMRA at 463.1 Hz and multirotor MMRA at 532.8 Hz is 79.4 and 219.9 mW, respectively. Based on our modeling, we estimate that in the single-rotor MMRA, the eddy current loss contributes about 18.5% of the total, and in the multirotor MMRA, the eddy current loss contributes about 8.9% of the total. This leads to the conclusion that, in these two prototypes, most of the power loss occurs in the mechanical suspension. The eddy current loss, however, is inherently present in all MMRA systems and sets the lower bound on the lowest possible power consumption for such systems."

            "text": "In this work, we have developed a new analytical dynamical model for generalized torsional MMRAs. We demonstrate that this analytical approach tremendously improves our frequency and oscillation mode prediction capability for MMRAs in the linear regime, as well as in the nonlinear regime, with a direct comparison to experimental results. We additionally develop a new simplified model that can be used to estimate the eddy current loss in MMRAs, without reliance on complicated finite-element simulations. This model reveals that the eddy current loss in each conductor in the experimental MMRA prototypes estimated using our simplified model are in close agreement with those estimated using finite-element simulations and thereby confirm the utility of the simplified model. For MMRAs that have been developed for ULF communication applications [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], we find that the eddy current loss is appreciable. Notably, it sets the lower bound on the best case power efficiency for these types of magneto-mechanical transmitters, even if the suspension induced losses are considered negligible. Even so, this work supports the argument that MMRA-based ULF transmitters can be order-of-magnitude more power-efficient and compact than existing ULF transmitters based on antennas or induction coils [4], [5], [6]."

The position vector from the centroid of magnet A to the centroid of magnet B is defined as r\u20d7 AB = d x\u0302 .

The angles of the magnetization vector with respect to the x\u0302-axis are defined as \u03b8A and \u03b8B , as shown in Fig. 6.\nThe magnetic torque can be most simply analytically obtained using the dipole approximation.
