    "abstractText": "Background: The cost of mental ill health in the EU\u201028 nations has been estimated at approximately 4.1% of the total gross domestic products (GDP). Improved rates of return to sustainable employment among people who are sick\u2010listed due to mental ill health would decrease spending on welfare benefits. The present cohort study provides statistical information that may be helpful in the design and prioritizing of efforts aimed at reducing the burden of sickness absence due to mental ill health among employees in the general working population of Denmark. Our primary aim was to estimate odds of being i) deceased or recipient of health related welfare benefits and ii) recipient non\u2010health related welfare benefits, compared to being alive and self\u2010reliant at 1, 3 and 5 years after first visit to a jobs and benefits office due to mental health related sickness absence, as a function of industrial sector and job group skill level at baseline. A secondary aim was to analyze these odds as a function of baseline age, gender, type of mental ill health, family type and employment status. Methods: The study population consisted of 20\u201354 year\u2010old persons on long\u2010term sickness absence due to mental health problems in 21 Danish municipalities in 2010\u20132012 (N = 19,660). Odds ratios were estimated by use of multi\u2010 nomial logistic regression. The outcomes were ascertained through national registers. Results: We did not find any statistically significant association between baseline industrial sector or job group skill level and welfare dependency at follow\u2010up. In the secondary analyses, the estimated odds of health and non\u2010health related welfare dependencies at follow\u2010up tended to increase with unemployment, age, being single and being on sick leave due to self\u2010reported anxiety or depression versus stress/burnout at baseline. Conclusions: The present study does not support that industry and job group skill level predict welfare dependency after health related sickness absence, after adjustment for relevant covariates, in the general population of Denmark. It suggests, however, that the vulnerability lies in population groups characterized by unemployment, older age, being single and being on sick leave due to self\u2010reported anxiety or depression versus stress/burnout.",

Odds ratios were estimated by use of multi\u2011 nomial logistic regression. The outcomes were ascertained through national registers.\nResults: We did not find any statistically significant association between baseline industrial sector or job group skill level and welfare dependency at follow\u2011up. In the secondary analyses, the estimated odds of health and non\u2011health related welfare dependencies at follow\u2011up tended to increase with unemployment, age, being single and being on sick leave due to self\u2011reported anxiety or depression versus stress/burnout at baseline.\nConclusions: The present study does not support that industry and job group skill level predict welfare dependency after health related sickness absence, after adjustment for relevant covariates, in the general population of Denmark. It suggests, however, that the vulnerability lies in population groups characterized by unemployment, older age, being single and being on sick leave due to self\u2011reported anxiety or depression versus stress/burnout.\nKeywords: Industry, Occupation, Mental health, Sick leave, Return to work\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The\n*Correspondence: hha@nrcwe.dk The National Research Centre for the Working Environment, 105 Lers\u00f8 Parkall\u00e9, DK\u20112100 Copenhagen, Denmark\nestimated costs were divided into i) direct spending on health care (1.3% of GDP), ii) spending on social security programs (1.2% of GDP) and iii) indirect costs due to mental illness related reductions in employment and productivity (1.6% of GDP). The total cost of mental ill health in Denmark was estimated at 14.6 billion euro (5.4% of GDP), which, in terms of percentage of GDP, was the highest estimated cost among the 28 EU-nations.\nIt is obvious that improved rates of return to sustainable employment among people who are sick-listed due to mental ill health would firstly decrease spending on welfare benefits and secondly decrease costs associated with lost productivity. It has moreover been suggested that employment can improve mental health and that a swift return to sustainable employment thereby also might decrease future health care costs [2, 3]. A lot of time and money have therefore been invested in research aimed at identifying facilitators and barriers of return to work (RTW) among people who are sicklisted due to mental ill health, and at least 11 review articles have been published on the topic [4\u201314]. With regard to work related factors, there appears to be moderate evidence that social support from supervisors and co-workers are positively correlated with RTW (cf. [6, 7]) and that psychological demands, job strain and exposure to violence and bullying at work are negatively correlated with RTW (cf. [6]). For sociodemographic factors, there are strong evidence for a negative association between age and RTW (cf. [6, 7, 12]). The evidence for an association with RTW is, however, inconsistent for gender (cf. [6, 7]), education (cf. [7]), socioeconomic status (cf. [6, 8]) and marital status/ cohabitation (cf. [4, 6]).\nThe purpose of the present cohort study was to obtain and provide statistical information that may be helpful in the design and prioritizing of efforts aimed at reducing the burden of sickness absence due to mental ill health among employees in the general working population of Denmark. Our primary aim was to estimate odds of being i) deceased or recipient of health related welfare benefits and ii) recipient non-health related welfare benefits, compared to being alive and self-reliant at 1, 3 and 5 years after first visit to a jobs and benefits office due to mental health related sickness absence, as a function of industrial sector and job group skill level at baseline. All analyses would be adjusted for, inter alia, type of mental ill health, gender, age, family type and baseline employment status. Our secondary aim was to calculate odds ratios for welfare dependencies at follow-up also as a function of the above mentioned control variables, which we will refer to as secondary predictors.\nPrevious research on\u00a0the\u00a0effect of\u00a0industry and\u00a0job group on\u00a0RTW after\u00a0absence due to\u00a0mental ill health It has previously been shown that the incidence of mood disorder as well as the incidence of disability retirement, in the general working population of Denmark, are highly dependent on industrial sector [15, 16] and job group skill level [17, 18]. It was therefore reasonable to believe that these factors may play an important role in the rates of RTW and welfare dependency after onset sickness absence due to mental ill health. Some of the previous research papers on this topic support this supposition while others do not.\nRe. Industry In our literature search, we found two large studies that examined the duration of work absence among individuals sick-listed due to mental ill health, by industrial sector. One of the studies concerned sickness absence due to any type of mental ill health in Australia 2005\u20132007 [19] while the other concerned sickness absence due to depressive symptoms in the Netherlands 2002\u20132005 [20]. Both of these studies found significant industrial differences and in both of the studies, the education industry was associated with the longest work absence."

They were also classified by the skill requirements of their occupations into one of the following four groups:\n\u2022 High/Intermediate non-manual employees (for example, teachers, physicians, and dentists) \u2022 Assistant non-manual employees (such as technicians, secretaries, and nurses) \u2022 Skilled manual workers (for instance, guardians, and assistant nurses) \u2022 Unskilled manual workers (such as nursing auxiliaries, industry workers, and taxi drivers).\nThe estimated age and gender adjusted probability of having a low level of sickness absence increased while the probability of having a disability pension decreased monotonically with the skill requirement of the occupation."

[19, 20]). Secondly because we believe that teaching constitutes a work situation in which it might be especially important not to display any symptoms of mental ill health. In Denmark, the education and training industry is the highest ranking industry for emotional demands at work [27], and it is well established that teaching is associated with extraordinarily high emotional demands [28\u201330]. It is reasonable to believe that mental health problems may reduce a person\u2019s ability to cope with emotional demands, and that the workers in the education and training industry thereby would be more prone to lose their working ability (especially in teaching work tasks) due to mental health problems than workers in other industry groups with different job demands.\nRegarding job group skill levels: We expected that the adjusted odds ratios for welfare dependency would be higher among participants from jobs with low skill requirements than they were among participants from jobs with high skill requirements, firstly because of results in previous studies (cf. [25, 26]). Secondly, because a low skill level often is associated with elevated unemployment rates (cf. [31]). Thirdly, because a low occupational skill level often is associated with increased rates of physical illness (cf. [32])."

The study was, however, not completely blinded. The cohort of the study had previously been included in an examination of RTW during a three-month follow-up period, as a function of age, gender, educational level, employment status and reason for sickness absence [33]. Moreover, a part of the cohort had previously been included in the Danish return-to- work program, which examined RTW during a one-year follow-up period, as a function of an intervention aimed at facilitating RTW [34, 35]. Furthermore, a 10% sample of the cohort had been included in a preliminary effort to develop a cross-validated prediction model for self-reliance 1 year after a participant\u2019s first\nsickness absence related visit to a jobs and benefits office. The cohort had, however, never been properly examined for RTW as a function of job group and industrial sector, and it had never been examined for the occurrence of health and non-health related welfare benefits one or more years after the first visit to a jobs and benefits office."

It has existed since 1991 and covers all inhabitants of Denmark. The weekly benefits data are recorded if the person has been on a benefit for one or more days of the week. However, since only one type of social transfer payment can be registered per week, the above-mentioned social transfer payments are prioritized in the order listed, i.e. maternity/paternity benefits have higher priority than sickness-absence benefits, which in turn have higher priority than unemployment benefits etc. It is not possible to receive sickness absence benefits and unemployment benefits at the same time.

The first category consists of dummy variables for industrial sectors and job group skill levels. Since the primary aim of the study was to study the effects of these variables, they will be referred to as primary predictors. The remaining covariates were included in order to reduce the possibility of bias in the study of the primary predictors. The statistical analyses provide, however, automatically parameter estimates for all of the included covariates. Some of these covariates are of interest not only as control variables but also as potentially important predictors of welfare dependency after sickness absence due to mental ill health. We therefore decided, as a secondary aim, that if the covariates were of interest as potentially important predictors and it was deemed appropriate to study them as independent predictors within the statistical model and data material of the present study, then we would estimate and report odds ratios for them as well. Since the secondary aim of the study was to study the effects of such variables, they will be referred to as secondary predictors. The remaining covariates will be referred to as control variables. Geographical region at baseline is an example of a variable that in this study serves well as control variable since it may mitigate bias from within-sample geographical differences in e.g. job opportunities. It does, however, not qualify as a secondary predictor; firstly because it is unlikely to be of interest to anyone outside of Denmark and secondly because the data material and statistical model of the study were not designed to study geographical inequalities. A fair comparison of geographical regions requires that the municipalities involved in the study are representative members of the municipalities within their respective regions, which is unlikely to be the case in the present study. Parameter estimates of control variables will not be reported. The classification of the covariates into \u201cprimary predictors\u201d, \u201csecondary predictors\u201d and \u201ccontrol variables\u201d was finalized before the analyses were commenced."

The mean ages at baseline were 38.5 (StdDev 8.8) years among the women and 38.8 (StdDev 9.0) years among the men. 23.0% of the included participants were unemployed at baseline. At the 1-year follow-up 54.8% were self-reliant, 22.7% were either deceased or received health related benefits while 22.5% received non-health related benefits. The corresponding percentages at the 3- year follow-up were 61.8, 17.5 and 20.7%. The percentages at the 5-year follow-up were 63.3, 21.0 and 15.7%. A total of 30, 98 and 165 persons were dead at the 1, 3 and 5 year follow-up respectively.\nOur first hypothesis (H1) stated that the adjusted likelihoods of receiving health and non-health related welfare benefits at the 1, 3 and 5 year follow-ups depend on which industrial sector the participant belong to prior to the sickness absence. Our results did not lend support to this hypothesis. The P-values for \u201cindependence of industry\u201d were estimated at 0.0936, 0.7263 and 0.4820 at the 1, 3 and 5 year follow-up, respectively. We had, moreover, hypothesized that the estimated odds for welfare dependency would be significantly higher than average in the education and training industry. All of the odds ratios for the education industry vs. \u201call other industries combined\u201d were, however, very close to unity with quite narrow confidence interval.\nOur second hypothesis (H2) stated that the adjusted likelihoods of receiving health and non-health related welfare benefits at the 1, 3 and 5 year follow-ups depend on which job group skill level the participant belong to prior to the sickness absence. We expected that the adjusted likelihood of receiving welfare benefits at followup would be higher among participants from jobs with low skill requirements than among participants from jobs with high skill requirements. The estimated odds ratios\nfor welfare dependency were consistently higher among participants in jobs with the lowest skill requirements than they were among professionals --the group with the highest skill requirements. The results were, however, not statistically significant at our pre-specified significance level 0.01. The P-values for \u201cindependence of job group skill level\u201d were estimated at 0.0270, 0.3060 and 0.0135 at the 1, 3 and 5-year follow-up respectively.\nThe estimated odds ratios for each of the primary and secondary predictor variables are given in Tables\u00a01, 2 and 3 for the 1, 3 and 5-year follow-ups, respectively.\nAs shown in the tables, the estimated odds ratios were quite independent of gender. They increased, however, markedly with age and the age effect was especially pronounced for the health-related welfare benefits. The tables indicate, moreover, that the odds for welfare dependencies were substantially lower among participants with self-reported stress or burnout compared to participants reporting anxiety, depression or mental ill health not otherwise specified (NOS), as the reason for sickness absence. The effect of reason for sickness absence seems to be stronger for death or health related benefits than it is for non-health-related benefits.\nThe odds ratios for welfare dependency at follow-up as a function of family type tended to be lower among the married/cohabitants than they were among the single participants. The cohabitation effect tended to be especially strong for non-health-related welfare benefits (Tables\u00a01, 2 and 3).\nTables\u00a01, 2 and 3 show, moreover, that welfare dependency at follow-up were highly dependent on baseline employment status with increased odds ratios both for the health and non-related benefits among the participants who were unemployed at baseline. The odds ratios were especially high at the 1-year follow-up."

            "text": "We tested two pre-specified hypotheses, one of them (H1) concerned industrial sectors while the other (H2) concerned job group skill levels. None of the hypothesis tests reached statistical significance. Hence, we cannot reject the null-hypotheses that welfare dependency after long-term sickness absence due to mental health problems is independent of the industrial sector and the job group skill level the participant belonged to prior to the sickness absence.\nIn the introduction, we mentioned that two large studies had found significant effects of industrial sector on the duration of work absence among persons who were sick-listed due to mental health problems, and that the education industry was associated with the longest work absence in both of the studies [19, 20]. The respective study populations came from Australia [19] and the\nNetherlands [20]. The results of these previous studies do not align well with the results of the present study. In the study from the Netherlands, Koopmans et\u00a0al. [20] noted that the mean age of employees in the educational and public sectors was higher than average and suggested that this was a possible explanation for the longer work absences in these industries. They did not adjust their analyses for age but concluded that further research was needed to examine this possible explanation. The analyses of the present study lends support to this explanation, since no increased odds was found in the educational sector after adjustment for age. Another possible explanation for the disagreement between the results of Koopmans et\u00a0 al. and the results of the present study is that the endpoint in Koopmans et\u00a0al. was return to the same job the person held at the start of the sickness absence episode. Absences that ended, because the employee resigned were censored. In the present study, we did not censor participants who decreased their welfare dependency by finding a new job in another industrial sector. A possible reason for the disagreement between the present study and the Australian study [19] is that the latter only included work-related mental health conditions.\nThe socioeconomic status (SES) of employees are usually defined by the skill requirements of the job they are holding and is sometimes simplified and aggregated into blue- vs. white-collar or manual vs. non-manual workers. Recent reviews have concluded that the association between SES and RTW among employees on sick-leave due to mental health problems is inconclusive (cf. [6, 8]). We found five studies, which examined RTW-related outcomes as a function of SES divided into two or more job group skill levels, three from Finland [8, 23, 25], one from Sweden [26] and one from Canada [21]. The studies from Finland and Sweden reported a positive and statistically significant association between SES and RTW (the higher the skill level the higher the rates of RTW) while the study from Canada reported a statistically significant association in the opposite direction. In the present study, the association between job group skill level and welfare dependency at follow-up was not statistically significant. The results pointed, however, in a direction that aligns with the results obtained in the studies from Finland and Sweden.\nIt has previously been reported that anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with a longer time until return to work compared with adjustment disorders [42], stress/burnout related disorders [24] and other common mental disorder [43]. The previous studies were, however, small and the statistical precisions of their estimated associations were thereby quite low. In the present study, the estimated odds of health as well as non-health related welfare benefits at the one, three and five-year\nfollow-ups were substantially lower among participants with stress/burnout than they were among the participants with anxiety and depression. The present study thereby strengthens the previous finding that anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with a less favorable RTW outcome than stress-related disorders. Anxiety and"

The outcomes of the present study tended to be more favorable among married/ cohabitants than among single participants regardless of resident children. The estimated effects of cohabitation were typically stronger for non-health related welfare benefits. Previous studies on RTW as a function of marital status/cohabitation [43, 44] or family type [45] have been too small to impart any meaningful information.\nRecent literature reviews provide strong evidence for a negative association between age and RTW [6, 7, 12], which is in line with the results of the present study. The gender effect appears to be negligible in the present study and previous evidence of an association between gender and RTW is inconsistent (cf. [6, 7]).\nAs mentioned in the introduction, Engstrom et\u00a0 al. [22] did not find any statistically significant associations between job groups and health-related welfare dependency at 2 and 3 years after long-term sickness absence due stress-related psychiatric diagnoses, in the Swedish labor force. Their conclusion was that \u201cindividual labor market position, as occupation, employer, branch etc. seems to be less important than expected in explaining return to work from sickness absence due to stress-related psychiatric disorders\u201d. They found, however, that unemployment at baseline was a strong predictor of health-related welfare dependency at the two and threeyear follow-ups. The results of the present study aligns very well with the results by Engstrom et\u00a0al. [22]."

            "text": "Since a study protocol was written (and made into a public document) before the analyses of the study were commenced, the risk of hindsight bias was reduced. The risk of bias due to missing follow-up data was minimized, since the participants who migrated during the study period were excluded and the outcomes of the study were ascertained through records in national registers, which covers all residents of Denmark. The study was, moreover, free from volunteer bias since register studies of the present type may be conducted without informed consent by the participants. Another advantage of the study is that the data allowed us to differentiate between health and non-health related welfare benefits. The study was further strengthened by its size and its prospective design.\nA major drawback of the study is that the blinding had been compromised. It should, however, be noted that\nnone of the odds ratios that we were to estimate had been estimated before and that it is the odds ratios that constitute the essence of our study. Another drawback is that the reasons for sickness absence were based on self-reports rather than clinical diagnoses (cf. [46]).\nSince register studies of the present type may be conducted without informed consent by the participants, we can rule out individual-level volunteer bias. We can, however, not rule out the possibility of volunteer bias at the municipality level. The data were collected in connection with an RTW intervention study that took place in a selected set of Danish municipalities. A total of 44 out of 98 Danish municipalities had volunteered to participate in the study and 21 of these were selected for inclusion, by the research team. The estimated odds of the present study are thereby open to volunteer bias as well as researcher selection bias, at the municipality level. It is, moreover, possible that the presence of the researchers may have influenced behaviors and decisions of the case managers in the concerned jobs and benefits offices. We have, however, not found any reasons to believe in a differential bias among the exposure categories of the examined predictors.\nIt should also be noted that the odds of receiving welfare benefits depend on the rules and regulations of the concerned welfare benefit systems and that such systems varies between nations and time periods. In Denmark, you can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum consecutive period of 2 years and you can only receive sickness absence benefits for a maximum consecutive period of 1 year. Moreover, you are not entitled to cash benefits unless you (as well as your spouse or cohabitant partner) are destitute and you are not entitled to unemployment benefits unless you have an unemployment insurance. Being self-reliant is therefore not equivalent to being gainfully employed. In the present study, it can also mean that one is living on private means or that one is supported by a spouse or cohabitant partner. Another feature of the Danish welfare systems is that the requirements to be eligible for the various benefits are independent of industry and job group skill level. The null-findings of the present study with respect to effects of industry and job group skill levels on welfare dependency after sick-leave due to mental health issues will probably not hold good in systems where the conditions and coverage of unemployment and sickness benefits insurances depend on private insurances that are provided by the employer."

            "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, preventive efforts are needed to reduce the high costs (for the concerned individuals as well as for the society at large) of sickness absence due to mental ill health. The present study\nexamined industry and job group skill level as potential predictors of welfare dependency after health related sickness absence, in the general population of Denmark, but did not find any significant associations. Our study suggests, however, that the vulnerability lies in population groups characterized by unemployment, older age, being single and being on sick leave due to self-reported anxiety or depression versus stress/burnout. Our study thereby suggests that intervention strategies aimed at facilitating RTW after sickness absence due to mental ill health might have a greater chance of success if they address the condition itself (e.g. through health promotion and psychological treatment) than they do if they focus on work factors, such as industrial sector and job group skill level. It is possible that similar effects of age, family type, gender, unemployment and self-reported reason for sickness absence on the odds of receiving welfare benefits after sickness absence due to mental health problems will be found in other nations with similar welfare benefits systems. We have not found any reasons to believe otherwise. The generalizability of the findings can, however, not be ascertained until similar studies have been conducted in other nations.\nAbbreviations CI: Confidence interval; CPR: The Central Person Register; DISCO: Danish version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations; DREAM: Danish Register for Evaluation of Marginalization; ECM: Employment Classifica\u2011 tion Module; GDP: Gross Domestic Products; ICD: International Classification of Diseases; MHP: Mental health problems; NOS: Not otherwise specified; OR: Odds ratios; RTW : Return to work; StdDev: Standard deviation; vs.: Versus.\nAcknowledgments The study was funded by the Danish Ministry of Employment.
