    "abstractText": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic poses a significant threat to human health globally. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective anti-ZIKV agents. ZIKV non-structural protein 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a viral enzyme for viral replication, has been considered an attractive drug target. In this work, we screened an anti-infection compound library and a natural product library by virtual screening to identify potential candidates targeting RdRp. Then, five selected candidates were further applied for RdRp enzymatic analysis, cytotoxicity, and binding examination by SPR. Finally, posaconazole (POS) was confirmed to effectively inhibit both RdRp activity with an IC50 of 4.29 \u03bcM and the ZIKV replication with an EC50 of 0.59 \u03bcM. Moreover, POS was shown to reduce RdRp activity by binding with the key amino acid D666 through molecular docking and site-directed mutation analysis. For the first time, our work found that POS could inhibit ZIKV replication with a stronger inhibitory activity than chloroquine. This work also demonstrated fast anti-ZIKV screening for inhibitors of RdRp and provided POS as a potential anti-ZIKV agent.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, transmitting through mosquitoes, sex intercourse or vertical transmission from mother to fetus [1]. ZIKV infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital malformation, microcephaly and fetal demise. In adult patients, other neuroinflammatory diseases such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been reported [2]. The ZIKV pandemic spread over 48 countries and territories in the Americas between 2015 and 2016, infecting more than 700,000 people [3]. Concerning a global health crisis, WHO declared ZIKV a public health emergency of international concern in February, 2016 [4]. Although ZIKV case numbers have decreased worldwide in recent years, it still has the potential to became a pandemic. However, there are currently no vaccines or drugs approved for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection [5]. The ZIKV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA, encoding a polyprotein of three structural proteins (E, C and prM) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [6,7]. NS5 is the largest non-structural protein which has a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain at the C-terminal and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain at the N-terminal. RdRp initiates and governs the elongation of the RNA strand that includes the addition of nucleotides [8]. Since NS5 RdRp plays an important role in the replication and transcription of ZIKV and is absent in human beings, it has been proposed as a potential drug target for anti-ZIKV agents [9]. RdRp, a commonly conserved component of RNA viruses, is widely used as a target for antiviral drug screening [10]. Sofosbuvir is approved for the treatment of hepatitis\nInt. J. Mol.

It is a nucleoside analog inhibitor, which is converted into its phosphorylated form in the liver to compete with the natural substrates of RNA synthesis at the active site of RdRp [11,12]. Azvudine (FNC) is also a nucleoside analog with anti-HIV activity, which can be intracellularly converted into azvudine triphosphate and inhibit HIV-1 RdRp activity [13]. It has been investigated for use against AIDS. Recently, azvudine showed therapeutic potential for the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It was conditionally approved to treat adult patients with COVID-19 in China [14]. Therefore, screening for inhibitors targeting RdRp can effectively accelerate the development of anti-ZKIV agents. In this study, we performed a virtual screening of 935 compounds from an antiinfection compound library and a natural product library targeting ZIKV NS5 RdRp. Combined with a series of biological assays, we finally identified that posaconazole (POS) inhibited the activity of NS5 RdRp with an IC50 of 4.29 \u00b5M by binding with the key amino acid D666. Importantly, POS exhibited anti-ZIKV activity with an EC50 of 0.59 \u00b5M, more effective than chloroquine."

            "text": "Virtual screening is a promising in silico technique for drug design, which is based on algorithms and computational models to select compounds from a large compound database that are more likely to bind to specific biological targets [24]. Compared with the traditional drug screening process, virtual screening can greatly reduce the costs and increase hit rates to accelerate the drug development process [25]. Therefore, virtual screening has been widely used in drug discovery. There have been some successful applications in identifying bioactive leads. Kumarasiri M et al. reported by virtual screening that seven drug-like molecules, identified as potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 8 inhibitors, were active against colorectal cancer cell lines [26]. Another virtual screening model was established to successfully find acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors with the ability of protecting human neuroblastoma cells from A\u03b2-induced injury for Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatment [27]. Furthermore, in the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a strong interest in rapidly and economically finding effective anti-coronavirus agents. Scientists performed virtual screening towards drug targets including the spike protein, 3CL protease and RdRp, identifying several potential anti-coronavirus compounds [28\u201330]. In the previous studies, virtual screenings against ZIKV proteins (RdRp, NS2B and NS3) were employed to find some small molecule compounds with anti-ZIKV activities [31\u201333]. However, most of these studies focused on the virtual screening alone, in which the mechanism studies of the active compounds were limited. To address these limitations, after virtually screening compounds against RdRp, we performed a series of biological assays to study the mechanism of the compounds. Therefore, this work provides a fast virtual screening and biological mechanism assays for anti-ZIKV agents. RdRp, essential for viral RNA replication in host cells, is one of the most promising drug targets for RNA virus drug development. A robust RdRp activity assay is necessary for the rapid development of RdRp inhibitors. Current assays for RdRp activity include the cell-free biochemical RdRp enzyme activity assay and the cell-based assay [34]. In the cell-free system, RdRp activity acts on RNA elongation to produce quantitatively detectable substrates. Eltahla et al. reported a fluorometric assay to screen inhibitors of HCV RdRp, in which RdRp catalyzed the formation of double-stranded RNA that can be detected by PicoGreen [35]. A scintillation proximity assay was established to synthesize RNA containing radioactive nucleotides catalyzed by Dengue virus RdRp, leading to corresponding radioactive signals [36]. The fluorescence-based alkaline phosphatasecoupled polymerase assay was another biomedical assay, which incorporates a modified\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1900 8 of 12\nnucleotide analog in the substrate of RNA synthesis by RdRp, resulting in the release of a fluorophore for detection [18]. In this research, BBT-ATP was used to produce a highly fluorescent BBT to detect the activity of ZIKV RdRp. While cell-free RdRp enzyme activity assays have the advantage of initial high-throughput screening for RdRp inhibitors: however, some disadvantages have been recognized mainly for cellular metabolic effects of the compound [34]. To complement the cell-free assay, cell-based RdRp assays have been developed. In the cell-based assays, cells were transfected with RdRp together with the negative-sense luciferase RNA which can be transcribed into the positive-sense luciferase RNA by RdRp for reporter gene expression [37]. The inhibitors of RdRp for HCV, influenza and Lassa virus have been successfully identified using the cell-based assay [37\u201339]. However, most cell-based assays were on transiently transfected cell lines, suffering from unstable transfection efficiency and poor reproducibility [40]. Accordingly, the method for detecting RdRp activity would be instrumental in screening and validating the inhibitors of RdRp. It has been reported that D535, D665 and D666 are crucial in the activity site of RdRp [41]. By molecular docking, D666 was shown to be the key amino acid for the interaction of POS and RdRp. When D666 was mutated to alanine, there was no significant difference regarding RdRp activity between the WT and D666A mutant. We speculated that the activity of RdRp was relatively little affected by one mutation out of three key amino acids. As expected, D666A-RdRp showed a clear resistance to POS (IC50 = 17.00 \u00b5M), approximately 4-fold higher than the wild-type. However, it seemed that D666A-RdRp was still sensitive to POS. We inferred that there might be other inhibitory mechanisms of POS on RdRp, which remained largely unexplored. The co-crystallization of RdRp and POS could help elucidate the exact inhibitory mechanism of POS in the future. In the previous study, G664, D665 and D666 on RdRp were all mutated to alanine in ZIKV replicon RNA, followed by electroporation into Huh-7 cells. Only a low level of viral RNA replication was detected, indicating G664, D665 and D666 were essential in viral replication [42]. Thus, the influence of the D666A-RdRp mutation into ZIKV replicon on viral replication and the effect of POS under the D666A genetic background were crucial for evaluating the activity of POS. In subsequent experiments we will further explore the activity and mechanism of POS. POS is a triazole compound with various biological activities, such as antifungal, antitumor and antiviral. One of the most commonly used activities of POS is its antifungal properties. POS disrupted the biosynthesis of ergosterol, damaging plasma membrane function and ultimately leading to the death of fungal cells [43]. Concerning antitumor activity, POS exhibited an inhibitory effect on the growth of basal cell carcinoma through deregulating the hedgehog pathway which affects cell proliferation and differentiation [44]. POS also acted as an anti-breast cancer agent by inhibiting cytochrome P450 27A1 activity [45]. Furthermore, POS has been shown to possess antiviral activities against alphaviruses, human cytomegalovirus and dengue virus [46\u201348]. It was reported that POS inhibited alphavirus replication by modulating cholesterol trafficking and slowing clathrin-mediated endocytosis [46]. For the anti-human cytomegalovirus activity, POS inhibited the human CYP51 protein which plays an essential role in host cholesterol biosynthesis and the maintenance of sterol homeostasis [47]. Scientists also found that POS reduced the replication of another flavivirus dengue virus in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 4.1 \u00b5M by targeting the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which mediates the altered intracellular cholesterol distribution [48]. In a previous study, POS was shown to inhibit the replication of ZIKV sub-genomic replicon RNA infected in Hela cells at a single concentration of 10 \u00b5M [48]. However, the distinct mechanism and anti-ZIKV activity of POS are unknown. In our study, we confirmed that POS has a direct inhibitory effect on ZIKV RdRp and exhibited anti-ZIKV activity with an EC50 of 0.59 \u00b5M. In summary, combining virtual screening and biological approaches, POS has been identified as the inhibitor of ZIKV NS5 RdRp by binding with D666 of the active site. Moreover, POS exhibited the anti-ZIKV activity superior to chloroquine. Thus, POS has the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1900 9 of 12\npotential to be a lead compound. In future, we hope to optimize the anti-ZIKV activity and toxicity of POS by structural modification. The results and methods in this study have also provided some insights into COVID-19 drug discovery."
