1. **Investigate the impact of study assumptions on MAR study outcomes and MPLC decision making.** This could include exploring the impact of different functional forms for attributes, different data analysis strategies, and different methods for eliciting MAR.


2. **Conduct a study to compare the DCE and PTT methods in a different population, such as patients with a specific disease or condition.** This would help to determine whether the findings of the current study generalize to other populations.


3. **Explore the use of the PTT method to measure heterogeneity in MAR estimates.** This could involve using the PTT method to identify subgroups of respondents with different MAR values and investigating the factors that contribute to these differences.


4. **Develop guidelines for the design and conduct of PTT studies.** This would help to ensure that PTT studies are conducted in a rigorous and standardized manner, which would improve the comparability of results across studies.


5. **Investigate the use of the DCE and PTT methods to measure MAR for multiple risks within one experiment.** This would help to determine whether the DCE or PTT method is better suited for this purpose.
