1. **Investigate the impact of cash transfer interventions on the frequency of sexual activity among adolescent girls and young women.** This would help to determine whether cash transfers are effective in reducing early pregnancy by reducing the frequency of sexual activity, or whether they are effective through other mechanisms, such as increasing contraceptive use or delaying marriage.


2. **Explore the mechanisms through which cash transfer interventions reduce early pregnancy and childbearing.** This could be done through qualitative studies or mixed-methods studies that collect both quantitative and qualitative data. This research would help to identify the specific factors that are responsible for the impact of cash transfers on these outcomes, and could inform the design of more effective interventions.


3. **Compare the effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfer interventions in reducing early pregnancy and childbearing.** This could be done through a meta-analysis of existing studies or through new research studies that are designed to compare the two types of interventions. This research would help to determine whether one type of intervention is more effective than the other, and could inform policy decisions about which type of intervention to implement.


4. **Examine the long-term effects of cash transfer interventions on reproductive health outcomes.** This could be done through longitudinal studies that follow adolescent girls and young women over time to see how their reproductive health outcomes change after they receive a cash transfer. This research would help to determine whether the impact of cash transfers is sustained over time, and could inform decisions about whether to continue or expand cash transfer programs.


5. **Explore the potential unintended consequences of cash transfer interventions on reproductive health outcomes.** This could be done through qualitative studies or mixed-methods studies that collect both quantitative and qualitative data. This research would help to identify any potential negative consequences of cash transfer interventions, such as increased sexual risk-taking or decreased access to reproductive health services, and could inform the design of interventions to mitigate these risks.
