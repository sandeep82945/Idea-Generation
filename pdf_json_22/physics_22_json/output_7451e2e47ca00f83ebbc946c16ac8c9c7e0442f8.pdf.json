    "abstractText": "In this paper we study on-shell diagrams in N < 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. These are on-shell gauge invariant objects which appear as cuts of loop integrands in the context of generalized unitarity and serve as building blocks for amplitudes in recursion relations. In the dual formulation, they are associated with cells of the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n) and the on-shell functions can be reproduced as canonical differential forms. While for the case of the N = 4 maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory all poles in on-shell diagrams correspond to IR poles when the momentum flows in edges are zero, for N < 4 SYM theories there are new UV poles when the loop momenta go to infinity. These poles originate from the prefactor of the canonical dlog form and do not correspond to erasing edges in on-shell diagrams. We show that they can be interpreted as a diagrammatic operation which involves pinching a loop and performing a \u201cnon-planar twist\u201d on external legs, which gives rise to a non-planar on-shell diagram. Our result provides an important clue on the role of poles at infinite momenta in on-shell scattering amplitudes, and the relation to non-planar on-shell functions.",

            "text": "Modern on-shell methods for scattering amplitudes are based on a simple idea of building amplitudes from on-shell gauge invariant objects (see [1\u20136] for recent reviews). At tree-level, this idea is materialized in the form of on-shell recursion relations where the n-point treelevel amplitude is built recursively from the lower point (on-shell) amplitudes. The primary example is the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion relations [7, 8] where we shift external momenta of two external legs. There are also generalizations to multi-line shifts [9\u201311], as well as theories with special soft limits [12\u201315]. At loop level, unitarity methods allow us to write the amplitude as a linear combination of basis integrals with gauge-invariant on-shell prefactors [16\u201325]. These prefactors are calculated using cuts of\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nthe loop integrand, where we set propagators to be on-shell and the loop integrand factorizes into simpler objects. The basic cut is the unitarity cut where two propagators from one loop are set to zero. This procedure can be iterated further and when the maximal number of propagators are cut, we talk about maximal cuts.\n\u21131\n\u21132\n, \u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\n\u21134\n. (1.1)\nIn these diagrams both internal and external lines are on-shell, and the result is given by the product of tree-level amplitudes in the corners. In theories with fundamental 3-point amplitudes we can proceed further and express tree-level amplitudes in the corners using BCFW recursion relations. In the end, we get on-shell diagrams [26\u201339] which are onshell gauge invariant objects. Each diagram is defined as a product of on-shell 3-point amplitudes (all lines, external and internal, are on-shell) integrated over momenta and Grassmann variables of internal legs,\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 = \u220f k \u222b dN \u03b7\u0303k \u222b d2\u03bbk d 2\u03bb\u0303k GL(1) \u220f j A (j) 3  (1.2)\nwhere N is the number of supersymmetries. On-shell diagrams play multiple roles, such as giving us the kinematical solutions for cuts of loop integrands and reproducing the associated on-shell functions on these cuts, but a subset of them also play a role as building blocks in the recursion relations for tree-level amplitudes or loop integrands. For example, the same diagram represents a maximal cut of 3-loop 6-point MHV amplitude or a term in the BCFW construction of the 6-point MHV tree-level amplitude,\n3\n1\n2\n4\n6\n5 . (1.3)\nIn N = 4 SYM theory this diagram evaluates to the Parke-Taylor factor,\n\u2126 = \u03b4 4(\u03bb\u00b7\u03bb\u0303) \u03b44(\u03bb\u00b7\u03b7\u0303)\n\u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300856\u3009\u300861\u3009 . (1.4)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nOn-shell diagrams are fascinating objects and are tightly connected to the geometric formulations for on-shell scattering amplitudes using the positive Grassmannian and the Amplituhedron [40\u201346], which have been successfully used to obtain various explicit results including certain all-loop order quantities [29, 47\u201360]. In particular, each planar diagram, known in the math literature as a plabic graph [61], is associated with a specific cell in the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n) represented by the matrix C. The matrix C is parametrized by the variables \u03b1i which are associated with edges (or faces) of the graph. In physics, the on-shell function in N = 4 SYM theory is reproduced by a canonical dlog form [26] in all \u03b1i and delta functions which solve for \u03b1i in terms of kinematical variables,\n\u2126 = \u222b d\u03b11 \u03b11 d\u03b12 \u03b12 . . . d\u03b1m \u03b1m \u03b4(C\u00b7\u03bb\u0303) \u03b4(C\u22a5\u00b7\u03bb) \u03b4(C\u00b7\u03b7\u0303). (1.5)\nThe kinematical poles in the on-shell function are related to the poles in the edge variables. One particular parametrization of the on-shell diagram (1.3) is\n3\n1\n2\n4\n6\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\n\u03b17\n\u03b18\n5 ,\n\u03b11 = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300846\u3009 \u300836\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300834\u3009 \u300836\u3009 , \u03b15 = \u300836\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b16 = \u300816\u3009 \u300836\u3009 , \u03b17 = \u300856\u3009 \u300846\u3009 , \u03b18 = \u300845\u3009 \u300846\u3009 .\n(1.6)\nand the formula (1.5) reproduces (1.4). The kinematical poles in \u2126 correspond to poles in edge variables \u03b1j . In fact, taking a residue on the pole \u03b1j = 0 erases a corresponding edge and produces a lower-loop on-shell diagram. Its on-shell function is equal to the residue of the original on-shell diagram on the kinematical pole. For example, in the diagram (1.6) the condition \u03b17 = 0 sets the momentum flow in a corresponding edge to zero and forces \u300856\u3009 = 0. The result is a lower-loop on-shell diagram where external legs 5, 6 are attached to the same white vertex.\n3\n1\n2\n4\n6\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\n\u03b17\n\u03b18\n5 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b17=0\n3\n1\n2\n4\n6\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16 5\n. (1.7)\nAll poles in the on-shell function for N = 4 SYM are located deep in the IR region where the internal momenta are set to zero. For N < 4 there is an additional Jacobian factor in the Grassmannian form (1.5) which introduces new types of poles other than \u03b1j = 0 [26]. These poles are in the UV where the loop momenta go to infinity. Nothing is known about these poles, i.e. what the precise locations in the loop momentum space are (other than\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nbeing at infinity), what type of kinematical conditions they impose on external momenta, and what the residues of on-shell diagrams on these poles are. Obviously, these poles also naturally arise when calculating the on-shell diagrams from the definition (1.2) but the Grassmannian picture nicely divides the well-understood IR poles (located at \u03b1j = 0) from these new UV poles, which we also refer to as poles at infinity.\nThe nature of these UV poles is a very important conceptual question, and we address it in the context of on-shell diagrams which properties are inherited from the properties of scattering amplitudes. In fact, the behavior on the IR poles, such as erasing edges in on-shell diagrams, taking residues on \u03b1j = 0 etc., is just a consequence of perturbative unitarity for scattering amplitudes. However, the unitarity of the S-matrix does not predict what exactly happens with amplitudes (tree-level amplitudes and loop integrands) on UV poles when the loop momenta go to infinity (either external momenta or loop momenta) in a certain direction. The behavior on UV poles might be also tied to symmetries or special properties, for example the complete absence of any poles at infinity in planar N = 4 SYM is a consequence of the dual conformal symmetry [62, 63]. The same property has been also conjectured to hold for the non-planar sector of the same theory [64\u201371], pointing to a possibility of a hidden symmetry in the full theory. The surprising behavior at infinity has also been observed in gravitational theories. This includes the improved 1/z2 scaling under BCFW shift [72\u201374], enhanced cancelations on certain cuts [35, 69, 75, 76] or observed enhanced UV cancelations in higher loop amplitudes [75\u201379]. This is also likely related to surprisingly simple formulas for tree-level amplitudes [80\u201387] or other special properties of gravity such as color-kinematics duality [88\u201390].\nThis naturally raises a question of a uniform framework to analyze amplitudes at infinite momenta, and search for implications of the unitarity at infinity for the perturbative S-matrix. In this paper, we will make a modest step in this direction, and give a partial answer to this question in the context of planar on-shell diagrams in Yang-Mills theory. We will show where the poles at infinity are located in the kinematical space and what the kinematical constraints we have to impose to approach them are. The residue at infinity is then a diagrammatic operation on an on-shell diagram which we call a non-planar twist. The residue on this pole of a planar diagram is a lower-loop non-planar diagram. For N = 3 SYM all poles are simple while for N < 3 SYM we have multiple poles and the residue corresponds to a derivative operator acting on the lower-loop twisted on-shell diagram.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we review the basic facts about onshell diagrams. In section 3, we study the poles at infinity in one-loop on-shell diagrams for N = 3 SYM and show that the imposed kinematical condition produces a simple treelevel factorization. In section 4, we show that in planar diagrams all poles at infinity are localized in one-loop subgraphs and we discuss their embedding into a higher-loop on-shell diagrams. We also show a number of examples and discuss Global Residue Theorems which relate UV poles to IR poles. In section 5, we generalize our procedure to N < 3 SYM and discuss the multiple poles at infinity. In section 6, we show that in non-planar diagrams the situation is more complicated as one kinematical condition can send multiple loop momenta to infinity. We end with conclusion and outlook in section 7.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3"

            "heading": "2.1 Building on-shell diagrams",
            "text": "On-shell diagrams are given by the product of three-point amplitudes, multiplied by a Jacobian that stems from eliminating \u03bb\u2019s and \u03b7\u2019s of internal on-shell legs in the momentum and super-momentum conservation delta functions. The final result depends on external kinematic data and possibly on free unfixed parameters.\nPutting an internal edge on-shell gives one constraint equation, from which we can solve for the internal momenta in terms of the external kinematic data. Denoting the difference between the number of constraints and the internal degrees of freedom by n\u03b4, we get three distinct cases. n\u03b4 = 0 where we can express all internal momenta in terms of external data, n\u03b4 > 0 which places additional conditions on the external data, and n\u03b4 < 0 which leaves us with unsolved parameters that the amplitude will depend on. The simplest example of n\u03b4 = 0, is the four-point one-loop box diagram,\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\n\u21134\n`1 = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032, `2 = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03032,\n`3 = \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03034, `4 = \u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03034.\n(2.6)\nYou can see that each vertex imposes collinearity conditions on \u03bb or \u03bb\u0303. For example, the holomorphic part of momentum `2 is given by the \u03bb3 spinor (from the upper right white vertex) and the anti-holomorphic part is given by the \u03bb\u03032 spinor (from the upper left black vertex). This itself solves for 3 of 4 on-shell conditions on internal on-shell propagators, `21 = `22 = `23 = 0. The constraint from the final propagator `24 = 0 fixes the overall constant in `2 to be \u300812\u3009/\u300813\u3009. In N = 4 SYM theory we do not need to specify helicities of internal and external legs. For N < 4 SYM theory we have to specify them (or equivalently helicity flows denoted by arrows) to fully define an on-shell diagram. Solutions for internal momenta are the same regardless of the number of supersymmetries or theory (it can also be gravity on-shell diagrams or other). However, the actual on-shell function associated with the on-shell diagram is sensitive to these details. In particular, the on-shell function in N = 4 SYM for (2.6) is\n\u2126 = \u222b d4\u03b7\u03031 . . . d 4\u03b7\u03034 \u222b d2\u03bb`1d\n2\u03bb\u0303`1 GL(1) . . . d2\u03bb`4d 2\u03bb\u0303`4 GL(1) (2.7)\n\u00d7 { A3(1, `1, `4)A3(2, `1, `2)A3(3, `2, `3)A3(4, `3, `4) } = \u03b4\n4(P ) \u03b48(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 .\nAll integrals are evaluated on the delta functions using\u222b dx f(x) \u03b4(x\u2212 x0) = f(x0) (2.8)\n(see [26] for more details). All poles in the on-shell function correspond to sending one of the internal momenta of the diagram to zero as evident from (2.6). Taking the residue on\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nthis pole erases an edge and the result corresponds to a new on-shell diagram. For example, sending \u300812\u3009 = 0 implies `2 = 0 and we get\n3\n1\n2\n4\n= \u03b4(\u300812\u3009)\u03b4 4(P )\u03b48(Q)\n\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 . (2.9)\nThis diagram is an example of n\u03b4 > 0 where the extra constraint on the external kinematics \u300812\u3009 = 0 is evident from the delta function \u03b4(\u300812\u3009) in the on-shell form (2.9). The condition on external kinematics can be also seen directly in the diagram where legs 1, 2 meet in the same white vertex. At the same time, legs 3, 4 meet in the same black vertex which imposes [34] = 0 \u2014 which is indeed a consequence of \u300812\u3009 = 0 for four-point kinematics. The simplest example of an on-shell diagram with n\u03b4 < 0, is the four-point double-box diagram,\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u21131 z\u03bb\u03033\u03bb4\n\u21132 \u21133\n\u21134\n\u21135 \u21136\n`1 = \u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009 \u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032, `2 = \u300812\u3009\n\u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009 \u03bb\u03023\u03bb\u03032,\n`3 = \u03bb\u03023\u03bb\u03033,\n`4 = \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009 \u03bb\u03023 \u0302\u0303 \u03bb4, `5 = \u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009\u03bb1 \u0302\u0303 \u03bb4,\n`6 = \u03bb4 \u0302\u0303 \u03bb4.\n(2.10)\nwhere \u0302\u0303\u03bb4 = \u03bb\u03034 + z\u03bb\u03033 and \u03bb\u03023 = \u03bb3\u2212 z\u03bb4. This diagram can be thought as a heptacut of the two-loop four-point amplitude in the N = 4 SYM theory, with z being the last parameter in `1, `2 not localized by on-shell conditions from the cut. Alternatively, we can also interpret the diagram as a BCFW shift of the one-loop four-point amplitude (on legs 3, 4) with z being the BCFW shift parameter. The on-shell function is given by\n\u2126 = \u222b\ndz \u03b44(P ) \u03b48(Q) z\u300812\u3009(\u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009)\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 . (2.11)\nEach pole corresponds to erasing an edge in the diagram but not all edges are erasable (hence we have five poles rather than seven). The residue on the pole z = 0 corresponds the diagram (2.6) already encountered."

            "heading": "2.2 Dual formulation",
            "text": "In addition to calculating on-shell diagrams by treating them as the amalgamation of threepoint amplitudes, there is a dual formulation where they can be viewed as differential forms on the positive Grassmannian space. To understand this picture better, let\u2019s consider the momentum conservation equation, namely:\n\u03b44(P ) = \u03b44(\u03bb \u00b7 \u03bb\u0303) = \u03b44(\u03bb1\u03bb\u03031 + ...+ \u03bbn\u03bb\u0303n). (2.12)\nWhile this is a quadratic constraint, there is a way to re-write this condition in terms of two linear conditions for the \u03bb\u2019s and the \u03bb\u0303\u2019s separately. To do so, we introduce a k-plane in n-dimensions represented by a (k \u00d7 n)-matrix (modded out by GL(k) since such row\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\noperations leave the k-plane invariant). The space of such planes is denoted G(k, n) and is known as the Grassmannian. We will call the (k\u00d7n) matrix we use to represent a point in the Grassmannian space the C-matrix. Then we can re-write the momentum conservation equation geometrically as follows:\n\u03b4(C \u00b7 Z) = \u03b4((n\u2212k)\u00d72)(C\u22a5 \u00b7 \u03bb)\u03b4(k\u00d72)(C \u00b7 \u03bb\u0303)\u03b4(k\u00d7N )(C \u00b7 \u03b7\u0303), (2.13)\nwhere C\u22a5 is an orthogonal complement to C satisfying C\u22a5 \u00b7 C = 0. We can think about this geometrically in the n-dimensional \u201cparticle space\u201d [91]. In this space \u03bb and \u03bb\u0303 are 2-planes which are orthogonal to each other (2.12). We define a k-dimensional plane C which contains \u03bb and is orthogonal to \u03bb\u0303,\n\u03bb2-plane\n\u03bb\u03032-plane\nC . (2.14)\nThe C matrix is then used to linearize the momentum conservation but conditions (2.13) are in fact stronger, C \u00b7 \u03bb\u0303 = C\u22a5 \u00b7\u03bb = 0 impose 2n conditions on the parameters of C. This reproduces four conditions from the momentum conservation and leaves us with additional 2n\u22124 additional conditions. Depending on the exact dimensionality of the C-matrix, we can be left with some free parameters in C (matrix is not completely fixed) or oppositely in order to satisfy (2.13) we need to impose additional conditions on external kinematics. Note that the last delta function in (2.13) involves fermionic variables \u03b7\u0303 and it does not impose any conditions on C \u2014 we should just think about it as a polynomial in \u03b7\u0303. Each on-shell diagram provides a particular parametrization of the C-matrix using edge variables \u03b1i, or face variables fi. For planar diagrams, if the variables are real and take definite signs, all the main (k \u00d7 k) minors are positive, and the C matrix represents a cell in the positive Grassmannian G+(k, n). The connection between cells in positive Grassmannian and plabic graphs (name used in the math literature) was found by Postnikov in [61], and later the connection to physics and scattering amplitudes was discovered in [26]. Here, we just shortly review the key ingredients. For a given on-shell diagram, we choose an orientation by assigning arrows to all edges such that each black vertex has two incoming and one outgoing leg, while each white vertex has one incoming and two outgoing edges. Then we assign edge variables to all edges, fixing in each vertex one variable to one. It does not matter how we exactly choose the position of edge variables (fixing the GL(1) redundancy) but in each vertex there should be at least one edge with an edge variable. The diagram has k sources, external legs with incoming arrows, and n\u2212k sinks, external legs with outgoing arrows. Then the element of the (k\u00d7n) matrix is given by the following prescription:\nC\u03b1a = \u2211\n\u0393\u03b1\u2192a \u220f j \u03b1j . (2.15)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nFor each path from a source \u03b1 to a sink a we take a product of all edge variables along the path and sum over all paths. The element C\u03b1\u03b1 = 1 while C\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 = 0 for the path between two different sources. For a simple, one-loop four-point box diagram we have\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u21d2 C = (\n1 \u03b11 0 \u03b14 0 \u03b12 1 \u03b13\n) , C\u22a5 = ( \u2212\u03b11 1 \u2212\u03b12 0 \u2212\u03b14 0 \u2212\u03b13 1 ) . (2.16)\nFixing the signs of edge variables to be\n\u03b11 > 0 , \u03b12 > 0 , \u03b13 > 0 , \u03b14 < 0 , (2.17)\nguarantees that all (2 \u00d7 2) minors are positive and the C-matrix represents a top cell of G+(2, 4). The on-shell function associated with the same on-shell diagram in N = 4 SYM theory is given by\n\u2126 = \u222b \u220f\ni\nd\u03b1i \u03b1i \u03b4(C\u00b7Z), (2.18)\nwhere we are instructed to solve for the \u03b1i variables from the delta functions which fix them as functions of external kinematics. For our example, the delta-function constraint on C\u22a5 gives the following equations\n\u03b44(C\u22a5\u00b7\u03bb) = \u03b42(\u2212\u03b11\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03b13\u03bb3)\u03b42(\u2212\u03b14\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03b12\u03bb3 + \u03bb4), (2.19)\nwhich after contracting with \u03bb1 and \u03bb3 turns into 4 equations \u220f4 i \u03b4(Ei), that can then be rewritten as\nJ\u03b4 \u00d7 \u300813\u30092 \u00d7 \u03b4 ( \u03b12 \u2212\n\u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009\n) \u03b4 ( \u03b11 \u2212\n\u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\n) \u03b4 ( \u03b13 \u2212\n\u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009\n) \u03b4 ( \u03b14 \u2212\n\u300843\u3009 \u300813\u3009\n) .

Plugging the solutions for the edge-variables into the other \u03b4-function, one finds:\n\u03b44(C \u00b7 \u03bb\u0303) = \u03b42 ( \u03bb\u03031 +\n\u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009 \u03bb\u03032 + \u300843\u3009 \u300813\u3009 \u03bb\u03034 ) \u03b42 (\u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009 \u03bb\u03032 + \u03bb\u03033 + \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009 \u03bb\u03034 ) = \u300813\u30094 \u03b42 ( \u300813\u3009\u03bb\u03031 + \u300823\u3009\u03bb\u03032 + \u300843\u3009\u03bb\u03034 ) \u03b42 ( \u300812\u3009\u03bb\u03032 + \u300813\u3009\u03bb\u03033 + \u300814\u3009\u03bb\u03034 ) . (2.21)\nThe two equations can be obtained from a single momentum conservation equation by contracting with \u03bb3 and \u03bb1 respectively, i.e. we have,\n\u03b44(C \u00b7 \u03bb\u0303) = \u300813\u30092\u03b44(\u03bb1\u03bb\u03031 + \u03bb2\u03bb\u03032 + \u03bb3\u03bb\u03033 + \u03bb4\u03bb\u03034) \u2261 \u300813\u30092 \u03b44(P ). (2.22)\nFor the last delta-function we get the same thing except for replacing \u03bb\u0303i \u2192 \u03b7\u0303i,\n\u03b48(C \u00b7 \u03b7\u0303) = 1 \u300813\u30094 \u03b4 8(\u03bb1\u03b7\u03031 + \u03bb2\u03b7\u03032 + \u03bb3\u03b7\u03033 + \u03bb4\u03b7\u03034) \u2261 1 \u300813\u30094 \u03b4 8(Q).

The only poles in the on-shell function \u2126 come from the edge variables being sent to \u03b1i = 0 or \u03b1i =\u221e, which removes an edge and imposes conditions on external kinematics, in complete agreement with our earlier discussion. Note that flipping the orientation of an edge variable also flips \u03b1\u2194 1/\u03b1 and thus flips the pole at 0 and\u221e. Let us now consider another on-shell diagram,\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11 \u03b15\n\u03b12\n\u03b14\n\u03b13 C = ( 1 \u03b11+\u03b12\u03b13 \u03b13 0 0 \u03b12\u03b13\u03b14 \u03b15+\u03b13\u03b14 1 ) .

(2.26)\nThe Jacobian from solving the \u03b4-functions is J = 1(\u300813\u3009\u2212\u03b15\u300814\u3009)\u300834\u3009 .

(2.29)\nSolving for edge variables we get\n\u03b11 = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300813\u3009 \u300812\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300841\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300813\u3009 \u300834\u3009 and also \u03b4 = \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 (2.30)\nand plugging in (2.18) we get the same formula as in (2.24). Note that in all these cases we considered on-shell diagrams in N = 4 SYM theory which do not depend on the assignment of helicities. Hence, the formulas for diagrams (2.16) and (2.28) gave the same on-shell functions.

            "text": "If the theory has less than the maximal supersymmetry, we do need to assign both external and internal helicities to fully specify the on-shell diagram. The same on-shell diagrams with different helicity assignments correspond to the same kinematics (solutions for momenta, edge variables etc) but they are given by different on-shell functions. The on-shell function for the N < 4 SYM on-shell diagram [26] is\n\u2126 = \u222b d\u03b11\n\u03b11 d\u03b12 \u03b12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d\u03b1m \u03b1m JN\u22124 \u03b4(C \u00b7 Z), (2.31)\nwhere the Jacobian J is given by\nJ = 1 + \u2211 i fi + \u2211\ndisjoint pairs i,j\nfifj + \u2211\ndisjoint pairs i,j,k\nfifjfk + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.32)\nwith fi denoting the face of a closed cycle, and the sums are over disjoint collections of these closed cycles. We mostly work with edge-variables, and each face fi can be defined as a clockwise-oriented product of edge-variables. Let us compare the results for two different orientations of the one-loop box diagram. For the diagram with no internal loop (2.16) we have J = 1 and\n\u2126 = \u300813\u3009 4\u2212N \u03b44(P ) \u03b42N (Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 . (2.33)\nNote that this result is identical up to a trivial helicity factor, \u03b48(Q) \u2192 \u300813\u30094\u2212N \u03b42N (Q), to the N = 4 on-shell function (2.24). The second diagram (2.28) has an internal loop and the Jacobian reads\nJ = 1\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14 = \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 . (2.34)\nThe on-shell function is then given by\n\u2126 = \u300824\u3009 4\u2212N \u03b44(P )\u03b42N (Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 \u00d7 (\u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 )4\u2212N = (\u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009) 4\u2212N \u03b44(P )\u03b42N (Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009\u300813\u30094\u2212N . (2.35)\nNote that the on-shell function (2.35) has a new pole for N < 4 located at \u300813\u3009 = 0. Looking back to (2.6) this sends `1 \u2192 \u221e, hence we refer to it as a pole at infinity or a UV pole. This pole is substantially different from all other poles which correspond to erasing edges in the on-shell diagram \u2014 these poles correspond to sending the associated loop momenta to zero, we will refer to them as IR poles. The presence of the Jacobian in (2.31) dramatically changes the pole structure of the on-shell function \u2126. We will often divide the form into the bare function \u2126bare and the appropriate power of the Jacobian,\n\u2126 = \u2126bare \u00d7 JN\u22124. (2.36)\nThe IR poles come from \u2126bare while the UV poles always come from the Jacobian part. The role of UV poles is the main topic of this paper and we will elaborate on it much more in the next sections. Before diving into this discussion, it is worth noting one important point. For N = 4 SYM theory each on-shell diagram directly corresponds to a cut of the\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nloop integrand. For N < 4 SYM this is a collection of on-shell diagrams in general: with fixed helicities of external legs we have to sum over all possible orientations of internal legs. For the one-loop example, if legs 1, 3 are incoming there is one orientation and a quadruple cut of the one-loop four-point N < 4 SYM integrand is given by a single diagram,\n3\u2212\n1\u2212\n2+\n4+\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\n\u21134\n=\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n. (2.37)\nFor legs 2, 4 incoming there are two possible internal orientations,\n3+\n1+\n2\u2212\n4\u2212\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21133\n\u21134\n=\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n+\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n. (2.38)\nThis is exactly the case of on-shell diagrams with internal loops as we always have two different orientations (clockwise and anti-clockwise). While in a cut they only appear in the sum, we can still treat these on-shell diagrams as independent well-defined objects and study their individual properties. For example, in the case of the amplitude A4(1+2\u22123+4\u2212) (legs 2, 4 incoming) in N = 3 SYM each diagram has a single pole at infinity, located at \u300813\u3009 = 0 while the cut does not have this pole. Plugging (2.31) for N = 3 we get,\nCutA4(1+2\u22123+4\u2212) = \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009\u300813\u3009 + \u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009\u300813\u3009 = \u300824\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300841\u3009 .\nThis is a general property: cuts of N = 3 SYM amplitudes are identical to their N = 4 SYM counterparts (up to trivial helicity factors) while N = 3 SYM on-shell diagrams are individually different and have poles at infinity. On a N = 3 cut we sum over contributing on-shell diagrams and any pole at infinity has to cancel."

            "text": "The bare on-shell functions describe the dynamics of scattering amplitudes in the IR sector when the (cut) loop momenta are small. All poles in \u2126bare correspond to setting one of these momenta to zero and erasing an edge in the diagram, as a consequence of the perturbative unitarity. In the N = 4 SYM theory the on-shell function is given by \u2126bare, and hence we only have IR poles. This is true for both planar and non-planar sectors of the theory. In the planar sector, this is also a consequence of the dual conformal symmetry, while the symmetry explanation of the absence of poles at infinity in the non-planar sector is yet-to-be found. Note that the absence of these poles is related, but not identical, to the statement of the UV finiteness of final (integrated) scattering amplitudes in N = 4 SYM\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\ntheory. In fact, the absence of poles at infinity in on-shell diagrams is a stronger property than the UV finiteness of the S-matrix, see [64, 65, 69] for more details. For N < 4 SYM theory, the bare function \u2126bare is decorated by a power of the Jacobian J as outlined in the previous section. The Jacobian changes the pole structure: it removes some of the existing IR poles, and adds new UV poles. Note that the UV poles are not fixed by the (standard) unitarity \u2014 unlike IR poles where tree-level factorization or unitarity cuts fully fix corresponding residues. As a result, we can not naively expect that the residue on a UV pole, where the loop momentum goes to infinity, is an operation on an on-shell diagram. In the following, we will show that despite these assumptions the real situation is quite contrary: the UV pole can be understood as a (rather simple) diagrammatic operation, not erasing an edge, but shrinking a corresponding loop (which blows up on the pole) and rejoining internal legs via a \u201cnon-planar twist\u201d. As a result, the residue on the UV pole is generally a lower-loop non-planar on-shell diagram. In our discussion, we first focus on the N = 3 case, where the on-shell function contains only one power of J , and the pole at infinity in \u2126 is always a simple pole. For general N we get higher order poles at infinity and the residues correspond to derivatives of an on-shell function associated with the diagram."

(3.1)\nwhere the Grassmann variables are \u03b7Ii , I = 1, 2, 3, and hence the supermomentum conservation is \u03b46(Q). We can see that the Jacobian J introduces two new poles, \u300813\u3009 and \u300824\u3009 and removes poles \u300812\u3009 and \u300834\u3009. The absence of poles \u300812\u3009 and \u300834\u3009 is caused by the fact that corresponding edges are no longer removable. For example, removing edge \u03b12 sends \u300812\u3009 = 0 which leads to an illegal helicity flow\n3\n1\n2\n4\n(3.2)\nas we have a wrong number of incoming/outgoing legs in black/white vertices. This pole was perfectly legal pole in the N = 4 SYM case but now the Jacobian removes it. Same is true for the pole \u300823\u3009 = 0 and the edge \u03b14. Next, the pole \u300824\u3009 is canceled by the helicity factor in the numerator of \u2126 and only \u300813\u3009 = 0 stays as a new valid pole. As noted before, this is a pole at infinity as it sends the on-shell loop momentum `1 \u2192\u221e. While this pole\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\ndoes not erase any edge, we can easily see what type of kinematical constraint it imposes:\n\u300813\u3009 = 0 \u2194 \u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb3, and by momentum conservation [24] = 0 \u2194 \u03bb\u03032 \u223c \u03bb\u03034.

Note that our procedure was based solely on the analysis of the kinematical conditions between external legs, i.e. we imposed \u300813\u3009 = 0 and searched for an on-shell diagram which materializes that. But very importantly, the on-shell function for this diagram (3.4) is equal to the residue of the original diagram (3.1) on the pole \u300813\u3009 = 0. In this case it might look a bit trivial as we only replaced 1/\u300813\u3009 \u2192 \u03b4(\u300813\u3009) but the same procedure is valid for the general case.\nChecking the equality of the residue of the original on-shell diagram evaluated on the pole with the new on-shell diagram (with extra delta function imposed) might sometimes be tricky. For example, if we consider the same diagram with the internal loop and the opposite orientation, we get\n3\n1\n2\n4\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n= \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q)\u300824\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300814\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2126bare\n\u00d7 (\u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 ) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nJ\u22121\n= \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300813\u3009 . (3.5)\nTaking the residue on the pole \u300813\u3009 = 0 we arrive at the same diagram as before,\n2\n1\n3\n4\n= \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 .\n(3.6)\nAs you can see the on-shell functions look different in (3.4) and (3.6) but they are the same up to a sign, as \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 = \u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009 for \u300813\u3009 = 0. In fact, if we sum (3.4) and (3.6) we get zero which is consistent with N = 3 SYM cuts not having any poles at infinity.\nNext, let us consider the four-point double box on-shell diagram we discussed in the previous section. There are multiple different orientations of the same diagram which lead to different structures of poles at infinity. We can see from the parametrization of the loop momenta (2.10) that the left loop blows up for z = \u2212\u300813\u3009/\u300814\u3009, while the right loop momentum goes to infinity for z = \u221e. The accessibility of these poles depends on a\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nparticular orientation and the presence of closed loops.

As in the previous case, we want to interpret the residue on the pole at infinity as another (now one-loop) on-shell diagram. As both cycles are just one-loop on-shell diagrams, we can treat them locally, see section 4.1 for proof of this. This means that if we blow up the left loop we need to replace the box on-shell diagram with external legs 1, 2, `3, `6 by the tree-level factorization diagram with legs 2, `6 in the black vertex and 1, `3 in the white vertex,\n\u21133\n1\n2\n\u21136\n\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21134\n\u21135\n\u2212\u2192\n\u21136\n1\n2\n\u21133\n(3.10)\nMaking this replacement in (3.8) we get\n3\n1\n2\n4\nz\u03bb\u03033\u03bb4\u21131\n\u21132\n\u21135 \u21136\n\u21133\n\u21134 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 z=\u2212 \u300813\u3009\u300814\u3009\n3\n2\n1\n4\n\u21133\n\u21136\n\u27e813\u27e9 \u27e841\u27e9 \u03bb\u03033\u03bb4 = \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300813\u3009\u300834\u3009\n(3.11)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nThe same expression for the on-shell function can be obtained by taking the residue of (3.7) on the z = \u2212\u300813\u3009/\u300814\u3009 pole.

(3.13)\nWe see that the left (pentagon) loop has a pole at infinity for \u300813\u3009 = 0, all momenta `A, `B, `C , `G, `H blow up, while the right (box) loop has a UV pole for \u300835\u3009 = 0 when `D, `E , `F and `H go to infinity. The loop momentum `H contains both poles as it participates in both internal cycles. Note that the assignment of cycles is unique and it critically depends on the planarity of the diagram. In particular, we do not consider the external heptagon cycle \u2014 there is no pole at infinity associated with it, see section 6 for elaboration,\n3\n4\n5\n1\n2 \u27e813\u27e9 \u27e835\u27e9\n\u2113pentagon\n\u2113box\n.

In order to calculate the whole cut we would have to sum over all possible internal helicity assignments (for N < 4 SYM) as discussed earlier, but we can also study this one on-shell diagram individually. For this particular case (3.15) the bare on-shell function (which is identical for any assignment of internal helicities) is,\n\u2126bare = \u222b d\u03b11 . . . d\u03b16 \u03b4(C \u00b7 Z) \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14\u03b15\u03b16 = \u300824\u3009 \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300851\u3009 (3.16)\nand the Jacobian J consists of two cycles,\nJ = 11\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b16 \u2212 \u03b13\u03b14\u03b15\u03b16 = \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009\u300835\u3009 \u300823\u3009\u300815\u3009\u300834\u3009 (3.17)\nThe on-shell function \u2126 is then equal to\n\u2126 = \u300824\u3009 \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q)\n\u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300851\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2126bare\n\u00d7 (\u300823\u3009\u300815\u3009\u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009\u300835\u3009 ) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nJ\u22121\n= \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q)\n\u300812\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300813\u3009\u300835\u3009 (3.18)\nWe see that three of the IR poles \u300823\u3009, \u300834\u3009, \u300815\u3009 are removed as erasing \u03b11, \u03b14 and \u03b16 edges would lead to inconsistent helicity flows. On the other hand, both UV poles \u300813\u3009, \u300835\u3009 are added. We first blow up the right loop and calculate the residue on the pole \u300835\u3009 = 0. The right loop can be treated as a one-loop box diagram with external legs C, 4, 5, G. The residue is a following on-shell diagram,\n4\n5\nC\nG\n\u2212\u2192\n5\nG\nC\n4\n(3.19)\nReplacing the box by this tree graph in (3.13) we get 3\n1\n2\n5\n4 G\nA\nB C\nI (3.20)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nNote that in this diagram the condition \u300835\u3009 is automatically imposed as evident from legs 3, 5 being connected by a chain of white vertices. We can now assign edge variables\n3\n1\n2\n5\n4 \u03b15\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b11 = \u300815\u3009 \u300825\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300823\u3009 \u300825\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300815\u3009 \u300814\u3009 , \u03b15 = \u300845\u3009 \u300851\u3009 .\n(3.21)\nand calculate the on-shell function,\n\u2126UV = \u222b d\u03b11 . . . d\u03b15 \u03b4(C \u00b7 Z)\n\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14\u03b15 \u00d7 11\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14\u03b15 = \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u300835\u3009) \u300812\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300813\u3009 , (3.22)\nwhich is equal to a residue of (3.18) on \u300835\u3009 = 0 pole. Let us now consider the same pentabox on-shell diagram but calculate the residue on the other pole at infinity \u300813\u3009 = 0 which blows up the left pentagon. As we have already seen, the calculation of UV poles is a local operation and we need to figure out how to do it for the pentagon sub-diagram. As it turns out, the rule is very similar to what we saw for the box. The result is a tree-level on-shell diagram with legs 2, F in the black vertex and legs 1, 3, D connected by a chain of white vertices,\n3\n1\n2\nD\nF\n=\n3\n1\n2 D\nF\n\u2212\u2192 D\n2\n1\nF\n3\n(3.23)\nwhere we first merge-expanded the pentagon diagram and then we used the same replacement rule as for the box. In the final tree-level on-shell diagram we merged all legs into one white vertex, which can be interpreted as a 4-point k = 1 tree-level amplitude, or alternatively can be further expanded as a chain of regular white three-point vertices,\nD\n2\n1\nF\n3\n= D\n2\n1\nF\n3\n= 1\n2\n3\nF\nD\n= 3\n2\n1\nF\nD\n(3.24)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nThe identity between all these diagrams is a consequence of a usual merge-expand rule [26]. Using (3.24) the residue on the \u300813\u3009 = 0 pole is\n3\n1\n2\n4\n5\nD\nF\n\u2212\u2192\n3\n2\n1\n4\n5F\nD\n(3.25)\nAs expected this diagram automatically implements the condition \u300813\u3009 = 0. Note that using other representations of the tree graph (3.24) we would get other one-loop pentagons which differ from (3.25) by the merge-expand move and do not change the on-shell function. It is easy to see that the on-shell function for (3.25) is equal to\n\u2126UV = \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009) \u300812\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300835\u3009 (3.26)\nwhich is equal to the residue of (3.18) on \u300813\u3009 = 0 pole. Naively, we could access the pole at infinity by solving for one of the edge variables from J \u22121 = 0. However, the meaning of the new edge variables is unclear as they do not correspond to a parametrization of the lower-loop on-shell diagram. Hence we have to work directly in the kinematical space when accessing the poles at infinity."

            "text": "As we have already seen, the calculation of the UV pole of an on-shell diagram reduced to the calculation of this pole in the one-loop sub-diagram. The result of this operation was glued into the rest of the graph. Our goal here is to calculate the UV pole for a general one-loop on-shell diagram. This is a direct generalization of what we have already seen for box and pentagon. Let us first look at the MHV hexagon,\n2\n31\n4\n5\n6\nA\nB C\nD\nEF\n`A = [13] [36]\u03bb1\u03bb\u03036, `B = [16] [36]\u03bb1\u03bb\u03033, `C = [26] [36]\u03bb2\u03bb\u03033, `D = [46] [36]\u03bb4\u03bb\u03033, `E = [34] [36]\u03bb4\u03bb\u03036, `F = [35] [36]\u03bb5\u03bb\u03036.\n(3.27)\nAs we can see from the chains of white vertices, the external kinematics is subject to two constraints \u300812\u3009 = \u300845\u3009 = 0, i.e. \u03bb2 = \u03b1\u03bb1, \u03bb5 = \u03b2\u03bb4. The pole at infinity is accessed by sending [36] = 0 as evident from explicit solutions for internal loop momenta,\n0 = s36 = s1245 = (p1 + p2) \u00b7 (p4 + p5) = \u300814\u3009([14] + \u03b1[24] + \u03b2[15] + \u03b1\u03b2[25]) (3.28)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nHence [36] = 0 implies \u300814\u3009 = 0 on the support of \u300812\u3009 = \u300845\u3009 = 0. In the end, all \u03bbs of external legs connected to white vertices are collinear, \u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb2 \u223c \u03bb4 \u223c \u03bb5, i.e. \u3008ij\u3009 = 0 for i, j = 1, 2, 4, 5.

The on-shell function for the hexagon with closed internal loop (3.27) is\n\u2126 = \u300836\u3009 \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u300812\u3009)\u03b4(\u300845\u3009) \u300823\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300856\u3009\u300816\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2126bare\n\u00d7 \u300823\u3009\u300856\u3009 \u300825\u3009\u300836\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 J\u22121 = \u03b4 4(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u300812\u3009)\u03b4(\u300845\u3009) \u300834\u3009\u300816\u3009\u300825\u3009 (3.32)\nOn the pole at infinity, \u300825\u3009 = 0, and replacing 1/\u300825\u3009 \u2192 \u03b4(\u300825\u3009) we do get the correct on-shell function for the on-shell diagram (3.31). Note that this is all calculated on a very\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nconstrained kinematics so there are many equivalent ways how to write the formula (3.32). It is clear how the calculation of the UV pole generalizes for any one-loop MHV on-shell diagram,\ni\nj\ni\u2212 1\n1\nn\nj + 1\nj \u2212 1\ni+ 1\n=\ni\nj\nj + 1\ni+ 1\ni\u2212 1\nj \u2212 1\n1\nn\n(3.33)\nwhere we conveniently reduced the n-gon into a \u201ccore\u201d box diagram connected to white blobs of external legs. The \u03bb-spinors of all external legs connected to the same white vertex are proportional, so the kinematics are highly constrained. As before, on the pole at infinity [ij] = 0 we replace the box diagram by a simple tree-level factorization graph, and all but legs i, j are now connected to the same white vertex,\ni\nj + 1\ni+ 1\ni\u2212 1\nj \u2212 1\n1\nn\nj\n=\njn\ni\n1\ni\u2212 1\ni+ 1\nj \u2212 1 j + 1\n(3.34)\nWe can expand the white vertex into three-point vertices in an arbitrary way without changing the kinematics or the on-shell function. In the original on-shell diagram many collinearity conditions are already imposed,\n\u03bbi+1 \u223c \u03bbi+2 \u223c \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c \u03bbj\u22121 and \u03bbj+1 \u223c \u03bbj+2 \u223c \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c \u03bbi\u22121 (3.35)\nThe pole at infinity is accessed by \u3008pq\u3009 = 0 where p, q are from two different sets of labels of external legs attached to white vertices, p \u2208 {i+1, . . . , j\u22121} and q \u2208 {j+1, . . . , i\u22121}, or alternatively we can access the pole by sending [ij] = 0, which are all equivalent conditions.\n3.4 Arbitrary n-gons and helicities\nOur goal now is to generalize the rule for the UV pole for an n-gon with an arbitrary configuration of white and black vertices, and arbitrary k degree. The first example is a\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nvery simple six-point NMHV hexagon\n3\n42\n5\n6\n1\n=\n6\n3\n41\n5\n2\n(3.36)\nwhere we used the merge-expand moves to redraw the diagram. We can see that the core diagram is again a box, hence the rule for the UV pole is the same as before and we have not learnt anything new. This makes it clear that the next qualitatively new case is the hexagon diagram where the white and black vertices are alternating, and the core diagram is a proper hexagon that can not be simplified,\n3\n42\n5\n6\n1\nA\nB C\nD\nEF\n`A = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032 = [16] [26]\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032, `B = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03032 = [34] [24]\u03bb3\u03bb\u03032, `C = \u300845\u3009 \u300835\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03034 = [23] [24]\u03bb3\u03bb\u03034, `D = \u300834\u3009 \u300835\u3009\u03bb5\u03bb\u03034 = [56] [46]\u03bb4\u03bb\u03035, `E = \u300816\u3009 \u300815\u3009\u03bb5\u03bb\u03036 = [45] [46]\u03bb5\u03bb\u03036, `F = \u300856\u3009 \u300815\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03036 = [12] [26]\u03bb1\u03bb\u03036.\n(3.37)\nThe kinematics of this on-shell diagram is more involved. There is no chain of black/white vertices and no merge-expand operation can change it. There are two independent kinematical conditions imposed on external momenta but none of these conditions is a simple collinearity of \u03bb or \u03bb\u0303 spinors. Solving for internal momenta we learn that there are three cyclically related kinematical conditions imposed,\n\u30081|2+3|4] = \u30083|4+5|6] = \u30085|6+1|2] = 0 (3.38)\nOne of these conditions is redundant, i.e. any two of them imply the third one. Looking at the denominator of on-shell loop momenta we can see that the pole at infinity can be approached by setting \u300813\u3009 = 0. On the support of (3.38) this also sends\n\u300813\u3009 = \u300815\u3009 = \u300835\u3009 = 0 = [24] = [26] = [46] (3.39)\nIn other words, \u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb3 \u223c \u03bb5 and \u03bb\u03032 \u223c \u03bb\u03034 \u223c \u03bb\u03036 on the pole at infinity. The corresponding on-shell diagram is then\n6\n3\n25\n1\n4 (3.40)\nand the on-shell function is\n\u2126UV = [23]\u03b4(\u300813\u3009)\u03b4(\u300835\u3009)\u03b4([24])\u03b4(P )\u03b4(Q)\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03034 + [45]\u03b7\u03036)\n[34]\u300812\u3009\u300825\u3009[25][56]2 (3.41)\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nIt is very interesting that the kinematics in (3.37) is already quite constrained (3.38), but it is only after imposing one more condition and approaching the UV pole that it completely factorizes into \u03bb, \u03bb\u0303 collinearities (3.39). We now evaluate the on-shell function for this diagram. The topology allows us to fix the GL(1)s in a symmetric way and choose the edge variables as\n3\n42\n5\n6\n1\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\u03b16\n\u03b11 = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300813\u3009 \u300812\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300845\u3009 \u300835\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300835\u3009 \u300834\u3009 , \u03b15 = \u300816\u3009 \u300815\u3009 , \u03b16 = \u300815\u3009 \u300856\u3009 .\n(3.42)\nThe Jacobian of the diagram is given by\nJ = 1\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14\u03b15\u03b16 = \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300856\u3009 \u2212 \u300823\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300816\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300856\u3009 = \u300813\u3009\u30084|3+5|1] \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009[12] (3.43)\nwhere in the last equality we used the special kinematics (3.39). The on-shell functions can be then written in many equivalent ways thanks to (3.39), one representation is\n\u2126 = \u30084|3+5|1]\u300834\u3009\u300815\u3009 \u03b4(\u039e)[56]2[12]\u300812\u3009\u300816\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300835\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2126bare \u00d7 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009[12] \u300813\u3009\u30084|3+5|1]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 J\u22121 = \u300815\u3009\u300834\u3009 2 \u03b4(\u039e) [56]2\u300813\u3009\u300816\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300835\u3009 (3.44)\nwhere we denoted all delta functions as\n\u03b4(\u039e) \u2261 \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u30081|2+3|4])\u03b4(\u30083|4+5|6])\u03b43([56]\u03b7\u03034+[46]\u03b7\u03035+[45]\u03b7\u03036) (3.45)\nLooking at the denominator of the inverse Jacobian J \u22121 we can see two terms: the first is \u30084|3+5|1] \u2014 this is just a helicity factor which is canceled by the numerator of the bare form (and would continue to be canceled also for N < 3), and then the pole at infinity \u300813\u3009 = 0. Note that due to the special kinematics, the pole structure of \u2126 is not very transparent. The singularities, \u300823\u3009 = 0, \u300845\u3009 = 0, \u300816\u3009 = 0, are all physical poles and correspond to erasing edges \u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b15. Pole [56] = 0 is not present because it also implies \u300834\u3009 = 0 and there is a cancelation between the numerator and the denominator (it also corresponds to non-erasable edge \u03b14 which is forbidden). We can make manifest an absence of this pole but at the expense of introducing some other spurious pole. This is a general feature of such expressions, because of mass dimension and little group weights any representation has some spurious terms that can be removed by trading them for another spurious object. Let us look in more detail at the pole at infinity located at \u300813\u3009 = \u300815\u3009 = \u300835\u3009 = 0. This pole is not present in \u2126bare as the factor \u300815\u3009/\u300835\u3009 is finite and no singularity is generated. This can be made manifest when choosing a particular parametrization. The Jacobian J \u22121 does introduce this pole and we can show after some work that the residue on the UV pole is equal to\n\u2126UV = [23]\u03b4(\u300813\u3009)\u03b4(\u300835\u3009)\u03b4([24])\u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q)\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03034 + [45]\u03b7\u03036)\n[34]\u300812\u3009\u300825\u3009[25][56]2 (3.46)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nwhere the delta functions indicate the simple collinearity conditions. The expression (3.46) is equal to (3.41) which proves our conjecture. Note that in (3.46) the kinematics is incredibly constrained (three extra conditions) and there are many equivalent ways how to write it. For arbitrary N the formula (3.44) is generalized to\n\u2126 = \u30084|3+5|1] 4\u2212N \u300834\u3009\u300815\u3009 \u03b4(\u039e) [56]2[12]\u300812\u3009\u300816\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300845\u3009\u300835\u3009 \u00d7 ( \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009[12] \u300813\u3009\u30084|3+5|1] )4\u2212N (3.47)\nand while the helicity factor \u30084|3+5|1] is canceled, we do generate a higher pole at infinity for \u300813\u3009 = 0. We will discuss it in more details in the next section. The next case is an arbitrary NMHV n-gon, with three black and n\u22123 white vertices. We can use the merge-expand moves to redraw this diagram as a core hexagon with three extra white blobs,\ni\nk\ni\u2212 1\n1\nn\nk + 1\nk \u2212 1\ni+ 1\nj + 1\nj\nj \u2212 1\n=\nji\nk \u2212 1k\ni\u2212 1\nj \u2212 1\nk + 1\nj + 1\ni+ 1\n(3.48)\nAll the \u03bb spinors in each group are proportional,\n\u03bbi+1 \u223c \u03bbi+2 \u223c \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c \u03bbj\u22121 etc. (3.49)\nand in addition we have two independent mixed conditions, for example,\n\u3008i\u22121|Pi|j] = \u3008j\u22121|Pj |k] = 0 (3.50)\nwhere Pi = pi + pi+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + pj\u22121 and Pj = pj + pj+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + pk\u22121. The pole at infinity is accessed by a single condition when \u3008pq\u3009 = 0 where p, q are from two different white sectors. This collapses the whole kinematics and all external \u03bbs attached to white vertices are proportional, and all external \u03bb\u0303s attached to black vertices are proportional. As a result, we get an on-shell diagram\nkk \u2212 1\ni\nk + 1\ni\u2212 1\ni+ 1\nj \u2212 1 j + 1\nj (3.51)\nNote that all such tree-level on-shell diagrams are non-planar in a sense of the canonical ordering 1, 2, . . ., n we started with. The same procedure generalizes to higher k degrees.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nThe \u201ccore\u201d N2MHV one-loop on-shell diagram is an octagon,\n2 3\n1\n67\n8 5\n4\n(3.52)\nHere we have four independent kinematical conditions imposed on the external kinematics, for example\n\u30081|2+3|4] = \u30083|1+2|8] = \u30087|8+1|2] = \u30085|3+4|2] = 0 (3.53)\nThere are no collinearity conditions between \u03bbs and \u03bb\u0303s. The four independent constraints (3.53) are quadratic in nature and there is no simplification. The solution for the internal on-shell loop momenta is\n2 3\n1\n67\n8 5\n4\nB C\nD\nE F G\nH\nA\n`A = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032, `B = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03032, `C = \u300845\u3009 \u300835\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03034, `D = \u300834\u3009 \u300835\u3009\u03bb5\u03bb\u03034, `E = \u300867\u3009 \u300857\u3009\u03bb5\u03bb\u03036, `F = \u300856\u3009 \u300857\u3009\u03bb7\u03bb\u03036, `G = \u300818\u3009 \u300817\u3009\u03bb7\u03bb\u03038, `H = \u300878\u3009 \u300817\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03038.\n(3.54)\nWe see that the pole at infinity is accessed by imposing a simple condition \u300813\u3009 = 0 which again collapses the whole kinematics to two sectors,\n\u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb3 \u223c \u03bb5 \u223c \u03bb7 and \u03bb\u03032 \u223c \u03bb\u03034 \u223c \u03bb\u03036 \u223c \u03bb\u03038 (3.55)\nand the corresponding on-shell diagram is\n8\n5 27\n3 1\n4\n6\n(3.56)\nWe can see that the diagram again does not respect the canonical ordering of the original octagon (3.52). The on-shell function for the octagon is\n\u2126 = [18][14][23]\u300856\u3009 2\u300834\u3009\u300878\u3009 \u30084|6+7|8][17]\u03b4(\u039e)\n[56]2[78]3[12]3[34]\u300823\u30093\u300845\u3009\u300867\u3009\u300881\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2126bare\n\u00d7 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009[87][12] \u300813\u3009\u30084|6+7|8][17]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nJ\u22121\n(3.57)\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nwhere the delta functions are\n\u03b4(\u039e) = \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u03b7\u03034[56] + \u03b7\u03035[46] + \u03b7\u03036[45])\u03b4(\u03b7\u03036[78] + \u03b7\u03037[68] + \u03b7\u03038[67]) \u00d7 \u03b4(\u30083|4+5|6])\u03b4(\u30087|5+6|4])\u03b4(\u30085|6+7|8])\u03b4(\u30081|7+8|6]) (3.58)\nThe kinematics is incredibly constrained and there are many equivalent ways how to write \u2126. Also many of the poles are equivalent, as it is evident from the figure, e.g. setting \u300812\u3009 = 0 (erasing edge B) also sends [34] = 0 etc. The pole at infinity is again not present in the bare form \u2014 two factors of \u300835\u3009\u300857\u3009 are canceled by \u300817\u30092 in the numerator, and the form is regular for (3.55). The UV pole is produced by the inverse Jacobian and the residue on the pole (3.55) gives\n\u2126UV = \u300834\u3009 \u03b4(\u039ea)\n\u300812\u3009\u300823\u3009\u300847\u3009[14]4[16][18] (3.59)\nwhere the delta functions are now denoted\n\u03b4(\u039ea) = \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q) \u03b4(\u03b7\u03034[18]+\u03b7\u03038[14])\u03b4(\u03b7\u03034[16]+\u03b7\u03036[14])\u03b4(\u300813\u3009)\u03b4(\u300835\u3009)\u03b4(\u300857\u3009)\u03b4([46])\u03b4([28]) (3.60)\nwhich reproduces the on-shell function for the tree on-shell diagram (3.56). Now we are ready to generalize to arbitrary one-loop diagram. It is enough to solve the problem only for a \u201ccore diagram\u201d which for Nk\u22122MHV is a 2k-gon with k black and k white alternating vertices.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nk\nk + 1\n2k\n(3.61)\nIn this diagram 2k\u22124 conditions on external kinematics are imposed. We can characterize them by two cyclic classes\n\u3008j|pj+1+pj+2|j+3] = \u3008j|pj\u22121+pj\u22122|j\u22123] = 0 (3.62)\nfor all odd j = 1, 3, . . . , 2k\u22121. These are 2k conditions, 4 of them are redundant. The pole at infinity is approached by imposing \u3008pq\u3009 = 0 where p, q are attached to two different white vertices (alternatively [cd] = 0 where c, d are attached to black vertices). This completely collapses the kinematics into two sectors where all \u03bb, resp. \u03bb\u0303 are proportional,\n\u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb3 \u223c \u03bb5 \u223c \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c \u03bb2k\u22121, \u03bb\u03032 \u223c \u03bb\u03034 \u223c \u03bb\u03036 \u223c \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c \u03bb\u03032k (3.63)\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nand the resulting on-shell diagram is\n2k\n2k \u2212 3 22k \u2212 1\n3\n1\n4\n2k \u2212 2\n(3.64)\nwhere all legs originally connected to MHV white vertices in (3.61) are now in the white vertex and all legs originally connected to MHV black vertices are now in the black vertex. For any other n-gon with chains of white and black vertices we can always use mergeexpand moves to identify the core polygon which contains the pole at infinity, and apply the same rule, i.e.\ni\u2212 1\nl + 1\n2\n1\nn\nm\nl\ni\nn\u2212 1\ni+ 1 j\nj + 1\nk \u2212 1\nk\nk + 1\nm+ 1\n=\nn\u2212 1\nn\n1\n2 i+ 1\nk \u2212 1\nm m+ 1\ni\u2212 1 i\nj\nj + 1\nk\nl\nk + 1\nl + 1\n(3.65)\nFor an arbitrary one-loop on-shell diagram, such as the one above, the residue at infinity corresponds to a tree-level graph where all external legs initially attached to white vertices are now attached together in the same white vertex, and the same applies to black vertices,\nn\nk \u2212 1\nk\nl\nn\u2212 1\n1\ni\u2212 1\nl + 1m+ 1\nj + 1\nk + 1 i\n2\ni+ 1\nj\nm\n, (3.66)\nand the external momenta are then divided into two sets: in the first set (attached to white vertex) all \u03bb\u2019s are proportional, in the other set (attached to black vertex) all \u03bb\u0303\u2019s are proportional. Note that the cyclic ordering of the original graph is not preserved: the legs connected to black or white vertices are not ordered in any particular way, but the overall canonical ordering is broken. Hence we refer to this operation as a non-planar twist. As a result, the residue on the UV pole of a planar on-shell diagram is a lower-loop non-planar on-shell diagram.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3"

This n-gon is glued into the rest of the diagram, so all momenta px, py, pz, pw are in general internal momenta. We want to prove that the UV pole does not propagate beyond this one-loop n-gon. In other words, external momenta px, py, pz, pw (from the point of view of the n-gon, otherwise these are internal momenta of the whole diagram) do not blow up for \u3008zy\u3009 = [xw] = 0.

The inverse Jacobian also removes some of the irremovable edges.

But now, something new happens: as a result, we get a non-planar on-shell diagram\n12\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b16\n\u03b11\n\u03b15\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b17\n\u03b18 (4.28)\nThe expression for the on-shell diagram using edge variables is the same as in the planar case and we can evaluate\n\u2126UV = \u00b1 \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P ) \u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03031+\u03b1\u00b11 [56]\u03b7\u03032+[61\u0302]\u03b7\u03035+[1\u03025]\u03b7\u03036) \u03b1\u00b11 \u300834\u3009\u30081|5+6|2](\u03b1\u22121 \u2212\u03b1+1 )s1\u030256\u30082\u03023\u3009[1\u03025][56]\n(4.29)\nwhere 1\u0302 and 2\u0302 are defined by the same convention as (4.17) and \u03b1\u00b11 is:\n\u03b1\u00b11 = (\u30082|5+6|2]\u2212 \u30081|5+6|1])\u00b1\n\u221a (\u30081|5+6|1] + \u30082|5+6|2])2 \u2212 4s12s56\n2\u30081|5 + 6|2] . (4.30)\nwhich agrees with the residue on either the plus or minus pole of (4.27). This six-point NMHV non-planar diagram corresponds to one of the eight dimensional cells in G(3, 6) (not the positive part).

            "text": "One of the most important features of on-shell functions \u2126 for leading singularity on-shell diagrams is that they satisfy Global Residue Theorems (GRTs). The leading singularity on-shell diagram has a dimensionality 2n\u22124 and the on-shell function has neither free parameters, nor are there any constraints imposed on external kinematics (other than momentum conservation). For the on-shell diagram of dimensionality 2n\u22123, the on-shell function (after solving for edge variables) has one free parameter z, i.e. \u2126(z). We can write Cauchy\u2019s integral theorem for this function,\u222e\ndz\u2126(z) = 0. (4.31)\nIf the on-shell diagram has no pole at infinity, then all poles in z come from erasable edges and we can write\nGRT = \u2211 j \u2126j = 0 where \u2126j = Resz=zj\u2126(z) (4.32)\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nLet us look at the most famous example which is our diagram (4.16). In N = 4 SYM theory the on-shell form is given by \u2126 = \u2126bare,\n\u2126 = \u222b d\u03b11 . . . d\u03b19 \u03b4(C \u00b7 Z) \u03b11\u03b12 . . . \u03b19 = \u222b d\u03b11 \u03b4(\u039e) \u03b11s1\u030256\u30082\u03023\u3009\u300834\u3009\u30082\u0302|3+4|5]\u30084|5+6|1\u0302][1\u03026][56] . (4.33)\nThere are six poles in this on-shell function corresponding to erasing edges \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b17, \u03b18. Going to each of these six boundaries can be illustrated as follows,\n1 2\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b15\n\u03b19\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b16\u03b14\n\u03b11\n\u03b17 \u03b18 6\n5\n1 2\n4\n3\n1 1\n1\n11\n2 2\n2\n22\n3 3\n3\n3 3\n4 4\n4\n4\n4\n5 5\n5\n5\n5\n6 6\n6\n66 \u21261\n\u21262\n\u21263 \u21264\n\u21265\n\u21266\n(4.34)\nwhere each arrow starts at the edge that is being erased, and all erasable edges are shown in red. This leads to the GRT in the form\n6\u2211 i=1 \u2126i = 0, with \u21261 = \u03b44(P )\u03b48(Q) \u03b4([34]\u03b7\u03035+[45]\u03b7\u03033+[53]\u03b7\u03034) s345[34][45]\u300816\u3009\u300812\u3009\u30082|3+4|5]\u30086|1+2|3]\n(4.35)\nwhere \u21261 = R[23456] is a famous R-invariant, and all other \u2126j are related by cyclic shifts. The BCFW recursion relations for two different shifts represent the six-point NMHV treelevel as\nAtree6,3 = \u21261 + \u21263 + \u21265 = \u2212\u21262 \u2212 \u21264 \u2212 \u21266 (4.36)\nwhere the equality of two representations is guaranteed by the GRT (4.35). All these relations were crucial in the early discovery of momentum twistor polytopes [101, 102], on-shell diagrams and positive Grassmannians [26, 91, 93, 94] and later the Amplituhedron construction [40, 42]. For N < 4 SYM the Global Residue Theorems change dramatically. The Jacobian removes some of the poles in \u2126(z) but also adds poles at infinity. The on-shell functions\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nassociated with IR poles also change as they are corrected by the Jacobian. We work in the context of N = 3 SYM theory and consider the same on-shell diagram for the top cell G+(3, 6). At first, we choose the orientation with one pole at infinity,\n1 2\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b15\n\u03b11\n\u03b17 \u03b18\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b16\u03b14\n\u03b19 (4.37)\nSolving for edge variables and plugging in the formula we get for the on-shell function,\n\u2126 = \u222b\nd\u03b11 \u300834\u3009[1\u03025]\u03b4(\u039e) \u03b11s1\u030256\u30082\u03023\u3009\u300834\u3009\u30082\u0302|3+4|5]\u30084|5+6|1\u0302][1\u03026][56]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2126bare\n\u30082\u0302|3+4|5][1\u03026] \u30082\u0302|3+4|6][1\u03025]\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nJ\u22121 = \u222b\nd\u03b11 \u03b4(\u039e) \u03b11s1\u030256\u30082\u03023\u3009\u30084|5+6|1\u0302]\u30082\u0302|3+4|6][56] ,\n(4.38)\nwhere, again, \u03b4(\u039e) \u2261 \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03031+\u03b11[56]\u03b7\u03032+[61\u0302]\u03b7\u03035+[1\u03025]\u03b7\u03036). Taking the residue on the UV pole \u03b11 = \u30082|3+4|6]\u30081|3+4|6] one obtains\n\u2126UV = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([46]\u03b7\u03033+[36]\u03b7\u03034+[34]\u03b7\u03036) \u300815\u3009\u300812\u3009\u30082|3+4|6]\u30085|2+4|3][34][46] ,\n(4.39)\nwhich matches the form obtained by collapsing the box into a tree as per the prescription. We can use this to define a modified global residue theorem (GRT):\nGRT = \u2126\u03033 + \u2126\u03034 + \u2126\u03035 + \u2126\u03036 + \u2126UV = 0 (4.40)\nwith the IR poles given by\n\u2126\u03033 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03031+[16]\u03b7\u03035+[15]\u03b7\u03036) s156\u300823\u3009\u30084|5+6|1]\u30082|3+4|6][56] , \u2126\u03034 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([23]\u03b7\u03032+[24]\u03b7\u03033+[23]\u03b7\u03034) s156\u30081|5+6|4][23][34]\u300815\u3009\u300856\u3009 ,\n\u2126\u03035 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([23]\u03b7\u03031+[13]\u03b7\u03032+[12]\u03b7\u03033) s123\u300856\u3009\u30085|1+2|3]\u30084|5+6|2][13][12] , \u2126\u03036 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03034+[46]\u03b7\u03035+[45]\u03b7\u03036) s456\u300823\u3009\u300812\u3009\u30081|5+6|4][56][46] .\n(4.41)\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nWe can illustrate the GRT as before,\n1 2\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b15\n\u03b19\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b16\u03b14\n\u03b11\n\u03b17 \u03b18\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n3 3\n3\n3\n3\n4 4\n4\n4 4\n5 5\n5\n5\n5\n6 6\n6\n66\n\u2126UV\n\u2126\u03033 \u2126\u03034\n\u2126\u03036\n\u2126\u03035\n(4.42)\nwhere each arrow starts at the edge that is being erased, and all erasable edges are shown in red, while the accesible UV pole is shown using the dashed internal cycle. Notice, how \u03b15 and \u03b17 now no longer are removable compared to the normal GRT in (4.34). Also note that the on-shell functions \u2126\u0303 contain Jacobians from the internal cycle in the box. This is a new type of GRT that relates the on-shell function for the UV pole to IR poles. Note that in this case all diagrams are planar, but the on-shell diagram for the UV pole does not respect the original canonical ordering with 5 \u2194 6. Now we consider a more complicated case of the same diagram with the orientation discussed in the previous subsection,\n1 2\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b15\n\u03b11\n\u03b17 \u03b18\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b16\u03b14\n\u03b19\n, (4.43)\nwhere the pole at infinity in the hexagon subdiagram is also accessible. In that case the Jacobian removes the IR poles for edges \u03b12, \u03b16, \u03b17, \u03b18 leaving only two IR poles \u03b15 = \u30082\u0302|3+4|5] = 0 and \u03b11 = 0. On the other hand we add 3 UV poles \u2014 a pair of poles\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nfrom the hexagon loop for \u30082\u0302|5+6|1\u0302] = 0 and one UV pole from the right box subdiagram \u30083|5+6|1\u0302] = 0 as before. The global residue theorem in this case can be written as\nGRT = \u2126\u03031 + \u2126\u03033 + \u2126+UV1 + \u2126 \u2212 UV1 + \u2126UV2 = 0 (4.44)\nwhere\n\u2126\u03031 = \u03b44(P )\u03b46(Q)\u03b4([45]\u03b7\u03033 + [35]\u03b7\u03034 + [34]\u03b7\u03035) [34]\u300812\u3009\u30086|3+5|4]\u30082|3+4|5]\u30086|3+4|5] , \u2126\u03033 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03031+[61]\u03b7\u03035+[15]\u03b7\u03036) \u300834\u3009\u30082|5+6|1]\u30083|5+6|1]\u30082|1+6|5][56]\n\u2126\u00b1UV1 = \u00b1 \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P ) \u03b4([56]\u03b7\u03031 + \u03b1\u00b11 [56]\u03b7\u03032 + [61\u0302]\u03b7\u03035+[1\u03025]\u03b7\u03036) \u30081|5+6|2](\u03b1\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1+1 )s1\u030256\u30082\u03023\u3009\u300834\u3009[56][1\u03025]\u03b1 \u00b1 1 \u2126UV2 = \u03b46(Q)\u03b44(P )\u03b4([24]\u03b7\u03031 + [14]\u03b7\u03032 + [12]\u03b7\u03034) \u300856\u3009[12]\u30083|5+6|1]\u30083|1+2|4]\u30086|1+2|4] , (4.45)\nwith\n\u03b1\u00b11 = (\u30082|5+6|2] + \u30081|5+6|1])\u00b1\n\u221a (\u30081|5+6|1] + \u30082|5+6|2])2 \u2212 4s12s56\n2\u30081|5 + 6|2] . (4.46)\nThis is a new type of residue theorem for on-shell functions for two IR poles (modified R-invariants) and two UV poles \u2014 one is a planar R-invariant for a different ordering and the other is a pair of non-planar on-shell functions. Note that while each on-shell function \u2126\u00b1UV1 contains square-roots, they do cancel in the sum as evident from the GRT (4.44). Once again we can illustrate the GRT in this case,\n1 2\n3\n45\n6\n\u03b15\n\u03b19\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b16\u03b14\n\u03b11\n\u03b17 \u03b18\n1 1\n11\n2 2\n22\n3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n66 \u2126\u03031\n\u2126\u03033\n\u2126UV2\n\u2126\u00b1UV1\n(4.47)\nfrom which it is clear that the only two removable edges left are \u03b15 and \u03b11. In N = 4 SYM theory we do not have any poles at infinity whatsoever, so we can never generate non-planar diagrams from planar diagrams. However, even in N = 4 SYM theory\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nwe can just directly consider non-planar on-shell diagrams, but with no orientations and internal cycles.

The on-shell function for the second, genuine non-planar, on-shell diagram is of a new type and is not related to an R-invariant as also evident from the presence of square-roots. It would be interesting to identify this form with the items in the list of appendix B of [33]. Having thoroughly gone through the procedure of taking UV poles of general n-gons and how to incorporate this into larger on-shell diagrams in N = 3 we are ready to tackle the higher order polls at infinity that arise in N < 3 in the next section."

Our goal is to calculate the residue on the UV pole \u300813\u3009 = 0. Just based on the little group weights and the mass dimension, the resulting expression must be\nRes \u300813\u3009=0 \u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300813\u30092 \u223c \u300824\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 (5.2)\nNote that on the support of \u300813\u3009 = 0 we have a relation \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 = \u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009. We want to derive this result by taking the residue of (5.1). The first issue is to find a good parametrization that allows us to approach the pole in a nice way. One approach is to write \u300813\u3009 = \u03bb(1)1 \u03bb (2) 3 \u2212\u03bb (2) 1 \u03bb (1) 3 , fix three of the components and then solve for the last one, e.g. \u03bb(2)3 , making sure that \u300813\u3009 = 0. However, we need to have in mind that through momentum conservation this parameter also appears in other momenta, which makes this approach less clean. Therefore, it is simplest to shift the external kinematics, e.g. using a BCFW shift \u03bb3 \u2192 \u03bb3 + z\u03bb4, \u03bb\u03034 \u2192 \u03bb\u03034 \u2212 z\u03bb\u03033, we get \u2126(z) but with an extra \u03b4(z) ensuring we preserve the same kinematics. Then we take a residue on \u300813\u3009 \u2192 \u300813\u3009+z\u300814\u3009 = 0 using the formula (5.4),\n\u2126UV = Res z=\u2212 \u300813\u3009\u300814\u3009\n\u300814\u3009(\u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009) \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q)\u03b4(z) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009(\u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009)2 = \u300824\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009) \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 (5.3)\nwhere we used \u03b4 ( \u2212 \u300813\u3009\u300814\u3009 ) = \u2212 \u03b4(\u300813\u3009)\u300814\u3009 and for the calculation of the residue on the higher pole we used the definition\nRes x=x0 f(x) = 1(m\u2212 1)! limx\u2192x0 dm\u22121 dxm\u22121 ((x\u2212 x0) m f(x)) (5.4)\nSame result is obtained using the shift \u03bb3 \u2192 \u03bb3 + z\u03bb2, \u03bb\u03032 \u2192 \u03bb\u03032 \u2212 z\u03bb\u03033,\n\u2126UV = Res z=\u2212 \u300813\u3009\u300812\u3009\n\u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q)\u03b4(z) \u300812\u3009(\u300834\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009)(\u300813\u3009+ z\u300812\u3009)2 = \u300824\u3009 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009) \u300823\u3009\u300814\u3009 (5.5)\nwhich is the same as (5.3) using \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 = \u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 on the support of \u03b4(\u300813\u3009). We can show that the result is independent of the shift. For general N < 4 we can repeat the same exercise and get,\n\u2126UV = \u300824\u30093\u2212N \u03b44(P )\u03b42N (Q)\u03b4(\u300813\u3009)\n\u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 (5.6)\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nNote that m-shell function for the on-shell diagram (3.6) with additional helicity factor for N < 3 supersymmetry. Therefore, our diagrammatic rule works perfectly here for any N for this case. Let us look at the double box on-shell diagram in N = 2 SYM,\n3\n1\n2\n4\nz\n= \u222b dz\n\u300824\u30092\u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q) z(\u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009)\u300814\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300812\u3009 \u00d7 (\u300814\u3009(\u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009) \u300824\u3009(\u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009) )2 = \u222b dz \u300814\u3009(\u300823\u3009+ z\u300824\u3009) \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q) z\u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009(\u300813\u3009+ z\u300814\u3009)2\n(5.7) This on-shell diagram has only two poles: IR pole for z = 0 (deleting the far right edge) and the double UV pole which blows up the left loop. The residue on the IR pole is\n\u2126IR = Res z=0 \u2126(z) = \u03b4 4(P )\u03b44(Q) \u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300813\u30092 (5.8)\nwhich is a box with an internal loop (5.1) as expected. The residue on the UV pole is\n\u2126UV = Res z=\u2212 \u300813\u3009\u300814\u3009\n\u2126(z) = \u2212\u03b4 4(P )\u03b44(Q) \u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300813\u30092 (5.9)\nand the sum \u2126IR + \u2126UV = 0 as dictated by the GRT for \u2126. Note that the on-shell diagram associated with the UV pole (based on our rule) should be just a box without an internal loop and an ordering (1342). However, the on-shell function obtained in (5.9) is not an on-shell function for this diagram,\n3\n2\n1\n4\n(5.10)\nBut rather, is its given by\n\u2126UV = \u300824\u30092 \u03b44(P )\u03b44(Q) \u300813\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300842\u3009\u300821\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2126D\n\u00d7 \u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 K\n(5.11)\nwhere \u2126D is the on-shell function associated with the diagram and K is some prefactor. This formula generalizes to arbitrary N ,\n\u2126UV = \u03b44(P )\u03b42N (Q) \u300824\u30094\u2212N \u300813\u3009\u300834\u3009\u300842\u3009\u300821\u3009 \u00d7 (\u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 )3\u2212N = (\u300814\u3009\u300823\u3009) 3\u2212N \u03b44(P )\u03b42N (Q) \u300813\u30094\u2212N \u300834\u3009\u300842\u3009\u300821\u3009 (5.12)\nWe can see that the situation is not as simple as in the N = 3 SYM case, the on-shell function is now corrected by some prefactor. This prefactor does not add any new poles, it only increases the degree of some of the poles. We will see shortly that it is generated by a derivative operator acting on this on-shell diagram.\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3"

The on-shell function for the diagram for N = 2 SYM can be then written as\n\u2126 = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3d 2\u03b7\u0303`4 \u222b d2\u03bb`3 d 2\u03bb\u0303`3 GL(1) \u222b d2\u03bb`4 d 2\u03bb\u0303`4 GL(1) { \u21261 \u00d7 \u21262 } (5.14)\nThe on-shell functions for left and right parts of the diagram are:\n\u21261 = \u30082`4\u30092 \u03b44(P1)\u03b44(Q1) \u300812\u3009\u30082`3\u3009\u3008`3`4\u3009\u3008`41\u3009 (\u30081`4\u3009\u30082`3\u3009 \u30082`4\u3009\u30081`3\u3009 )2 = \u30082`3\u3009\u30081`4\u3009 \u03b4 4(P1)\u03b44(Q1) \u300812\u3009\u3008`3`4\u3009\u30081`3\u30092\n(5.15)\n\u21262 = \u03b44(P2)\u03b44(Q2)\u03c92 (5.16)\nwhere P1, P2 are momentum conservation and Q1, Q2 are supermomentum conservation for each part of the diagram. \u03c92 for the right part of the diagram is arbitrary, and while it can contain additional delta functions or extra parameters, it does not depend on legs 1, 2 (only through `3, `4). Now we want to calculate the residue on the pole at infinity \u30081`3\u3009 = 0 of the box diagram. In order to do that we have to take \u03bb`3 to be collinear with \u03bb1. However, due to momentum conservation any changes in \u03bb`3 also propagate into other momenta, and it is relevant when we calculate the derivative of the function in (5.4). We can remove this dependence by integrating over `4, then `3 becomes independent,\n\u2126 = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3 \u222b d2\u03bb`3 d 2\u03bb\u0303`3 GL(1) { \u300812\u3009 \u30081`3\u30092 \u00d7 \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`4 \u222b d2\u03bb`4 d 2\u03bb\u0303`4 GL(1) \u30082`3\u3009\u30081`4\u3009 \u03b44(P1)\u03b44(Q1) \u300812\u30092\u3008`3`4\u3009\n\u00d7 \u21262\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u03c9\n}\n(5.17) where we defined an on-shell function \u03c9 which automatically implements the momentum conservation between `3, `4 and external legs, and the momentum `3 is now independent and not subject to any constraints. In this form we can take a residue on the pole \u30081`3\u3009 = 0. In order to approach the pole we parametrize\n\u03bb`3 = \u03b1\u03bb1 + \u03b2\u03bb2 (5.18)\nand rewrite\n\u2126 = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3 \u222b d\u03b1 d\u03b2 d2\u03bb\u0303`3\nGL(1) { 1 \u03b22 \u00d7 \u03c9 } (5.19)\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nThe UV pole is then given by the residue on \u03b2 = 0,\n\u2126UV = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3 \u222b d\u03b1 d2\u03bb\u0303`3 GL(1) { d\u03c9 d\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b2=0 } (5.20)\nWe can also undo the parametrization (5.18) and rewrite the result in a more invariant way,\n\u2126UV = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3 \u222b d2\u03bb`3 d 2\u03bb\u0303`3 GL(1) { \u03b4(\u30081`3\u3009) \u2329 \u03bb2 d\u03c9\nd\u03bb`3\n\u232a} (5.21)\nIn the angle bracket we take the derivative of \u03c9 with respect to \u03bb`3 and then contract with \u03bb2. This is the on-shell function associated with the pole at infinity in (5.13). Now we need to compare (5.21) with the on-shell diagram for the collapsed box diagram,\n1\n2\n\u21133\n\u21134\n\u21262 (5.22)\nThe on-shell function for this diagram is\n\u2126bareUV = \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`3 \u222b d2\u03bb`3 d 2\u03bb\u0303`3 GL(1) { \u03b4(\u30081`3\u3009) \u222b d2\u03b7\u0303`4 \u222b d2\u03bb`4 d 2\u03bb\u0303`4 GL(1) \u30082`4\u3009 \u03b44(P1)\u03b44(Q1) \u300812\u3009\u3008`3`4\u3009\n\u00d7 \u21262\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u03c9bare\n}\n(5.23) where we again eliminated `4.

Note that for N = 3 SYM the operator O = I and the residue of \u2126 on the pole at infinity is equal to \u2126UV = \u2126bareUV . This relation is very easy to generalize for arbitrary N < 4. In that case the operator O is given by\nON = 1(3\u2212N )!

As an example of our procedure, we look at the double box on-shell diagram studied in the previous section.

This straightforwardly generalizes to any oneloop n-gon, and also to any number of supersymmetries \u2014 we again act (3\u2212N ) times with the operator O. It is worth noting that in our procedure of approaching and calculating the higher pole at infinity we made a certain choice: we parametrized \u03bb`3 = \u03b1\u03bb`1 + \u03b2\u03bb`2 and calculated the pole for \u03b2 = 0 which then transformed into a certain form of the O. Note that the final result does not depend on this choice (the calculation of the residue is independent on the parametrization). One assumption we made in our calculation was that the leg `3 was internal (as we integrated over it and removed any dependencies between `j through momentum conservation). If this was an external leg we would have to approach the pole via another leg. For the general on-shell diagram with L > 1 at least one of the legs of the n-gon (which UV pole we approach) is internal and we can use it in our procedure. The only exception is the one-loop n-gon itself as an on-shell diagram, in this case we can just attach a BCFW bridge as we did for the box diagram in the previous section. The result for the UV pole does not depend on the particular procedure used to approach that pole."

            "text": "The non-planar on-shell diagrams have been extensively studied in the past. Based on the principles of generalized unitarity they represent the cuts of non-planar loop integrands. In the dual description, the on-shell function is reproduced by the simple dlog form in N = 4 SYM theory while in the lower SUSY Yang-Mills theories we have to include the Jacobians [26], and the formula is the same as for the planar diagrams. Unlike in\n\u2013 49 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nthe planar case not much is known about the connection of non-planar on-shell diagrams to the Grassmannian geometry, permutations, stratifications, identity moves etc. Some interesting observations were made for MHV on-shell diagrams in the context of N = 4 SYM theory [28] where the on-shell function for each diagram was written as a special linear combination of Parke-Taylor factors. A more systematic study was performed in [30] and the classification of all on-shell diagrams for 6 point NMHV amplitudes was performed in [33]. The first attempts to associate NMHV on-shell diagrams with Grassmannian geometries were provided in [39] in the context of non-adjacent BCFW recursion relations. In our discussion of UV poles in on-shell diagrams, we restricted only to planar diagrams and also our proof of the localization of UV poles in one loop subdiagrams required the planarity of the whole diagram. We will show that indeed the same argument does not hold for non-planar on-shell diagrams and the poles at infinity propagate beyond just a one-loop subgraph. We explore one particular five-point non-planar diagram,\n3\n2\n51\n4 \u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\n,\n\u03b11 = \u300832\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300813\u3009 \u300812\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300851\u3009 \u300814\u3009 , \u03b15 = \u300813\u3009 \u300853\u3009 , \u03b16 = \u300843\u3009 \u300813\u3009 .\n(6.1)\nThe Jacobian from the cycle is\nJ = 1\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14\u03b15 = \u300813\u3009\u300825\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300835\u3009 , (6.2)\nwhere we can identify the UV pole as \u300813\u3009 \u2192 0, while \u300825\u3009 is the helicity factor. We could instead have picked an orientation with a different internal cycle as follows,\n3\n2\n51\n4 \u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\n,\n\u03b11 = \u300832\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b12 = \u300813\u3009 \u300812\u3009 , \u03b13 = \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b14 = \u300851\u3009 \u300814\u3009 , \u03b15 = \u300835\u3009 \u300813\u3009 , \u03b16 = \u300813\u3009 \u300834\u3009 .\n(6.3)\nHere the Jacobian from the cycle is\nJ = 1\u2212 \u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b16 = \u300813\u3009\u300824\u3009 \u300812\u3009\u300834\u3009 . (6.4)\nWe find once again that the pole at infinity is at \u300813\u3009 \u2192 0, even though we are looking at different loop. We can uncover the same problem by solving for internal momenta,\n3\n2\n51\n4 \u21131\n\u21132 \u21133\n\u21134\n\u21135\u21136\n\u21137\n\u21138 ,\n`1 = \u300823\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03032, `2 = \u300812\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03032, `3 = (Q23 \u00b7 \u03bb1) \u300813\u3009 \u03bb3, `4 = \u300815\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03035, `5 = \u300835\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03035, `6 = (Q12 \u00b7 \u03bb3) \u300813\u3009 \u03bb1, `7 = \u300834\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb1\u03bb\u03034, `8 = \u300814\u3009 \u300813\u3009\u03bb3\u03bb\u03034.\n(6.5)\n\u2013 50 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nand we see that the UV pole \u300813\u3009 is present in multiple loops rather than only one-loop subgraph. There is a purely graph theoretic reason for these subtleties: we can not invariantly talk about \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201coverlapping\u201d internal loops. In the planar case, the first type corresponds to poles at infinity, while the second type does not. Take e.g. the pentabox (3.14) with the orientation in the box flipped. Schematically we can show the pole and cycle structure as,\n3\n1\n2\n4\n5\n\u03b11\n\u03b12 \u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\nOverlapping cycle \u2192 no UV pole\nInner cycle \u2192 UV pole\n\u2113pentagon \u223c 1\u27e813\u27e9 \u2113box \u223c 1\u27e835\u27e9No cycle \u2192 no UV pole\n. (6.6)\nEven with the overlapping cycle, the Jacobian still only introduces the UV pole of the box \u300835\u3009. For the non-planar graphs there is no difference between these two types of cycles, and we can always redraw a diagram in a way which turns one type into the other,\n6\n5\n1\n3\n2 4\n=\n1\n2\n5\n3\n6 4\n. (6.7)\nThis makes it clear that we need to generalize our rule to capture the UV poles in nonplanar diagrams where multiple loops blow up at the same time. This also concerns the gravity on-shell diagrams [34\u201337] which are intrinsically non-planar."

            "text": "In this paper we studied the poles at infinity in on-shell diagrams for N < 4 SYM theory. We showed that for planar diagrams the poles at infinity are located in one-loop subgraphs and the kinematical condition on the pole reduces the graph to a simpler on-shell diagram with a non-planar twist, hence the diagram is generally non-planar. The on-shell function on the UV pole is then given by a certain derivative operator acting on the on-shell function for a new non-planar on-shell diagram. This comes naturally from the definition of the residue on a higher pole as a derivative. We also showed that for non-planar on-shell diagrams the situation is more complicated as the poles at infinity are not localized in one-loop subgraphs and a different procedure is needed.\n\u2013 51 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 0 3\nOur work is a direct attempt to systematically study the poles at infinity in scattering amplitudes. While the residues of tree-level amplitudes and loop integrands in the deep IR are governed by principles of unitarity and lead to factorizations and unitarity cuts, the poles in the UV are naively not constrained by similar principles. We do not face this problem directly in the context of scattering amplitudes, but we chose simpler onshell gauge-invariant objects \u2014 on-shell diagrams, and solve the problem here. Note that tree-level amplitudes (and in special cases also loop integrands) can be expressed as sums of on-shell diagrams, so it is suggestive that our results would be relevant to amplitudes problem as well. The two main lessons from our analysis are: (i) the kinematics of UV poles correspond to non-planar objects, in this case non-planar on-shell diagrams, (ii) on-shell functions are given by derivatives of the bare on-shell diagrams. In future work, we want to use this insight to address this problem directly in the context of tree-level amplitudes and loop integrands.\nThe further goal is to formulate the general prescription for the calculation of poles at infinity for arbitrary tree-level amplitudes, and loop integrands \u2014 similar to rules of factorizations and cuts. This would have major implications on our ability to calculate amplitudes using recursion relations, and possibly search for positive geometries that could capture amplitudes in theories with non-trivial UV physics."
