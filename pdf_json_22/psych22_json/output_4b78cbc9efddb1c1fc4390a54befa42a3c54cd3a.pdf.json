ABSTRACT Objectives To determine whether clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) children or children living with a CEV person in Wales were at greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression in primary or secondary care during the COVID19 pandemic compared with children in the general population and to compare patterns of anxiety and depression during the pandemic (23 March 2020\u201331 January 2021, referred to as 2020/2021) and before the pandemic (23 March 2019\u201331 January 2020, referred to as 2019/2020), between CEV children and the general population. Design Populationbased crosssectional cohort study using anonymised, linked, routinely collected health and administrative data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. CEV individuals were identified using the COVID19 shielded patient list. Setting Primary and secondary healthcare settings covering 80% of the population of Wales. Participants Children aged 2\u201317 in Wales: CEV (3769); living with a CEV person (20 033); or neither (415 009). Primary outcome measure First record of anxiety or depression in primary or secondary healthcare in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021, identified using Read and International Classification of Diseases V.10 codes. Results A Cox regression model adjusted for demographics and history of anxiety or depression revealed that only CEV children were at greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with the general population (HR=2.27, 95% CI=1.94 to 2.66, p<0.001). Compared with the general population, the risk among CEV children was higher in 2020/2021 (risk ratio 3.04) compared with 2019/2020 (risk ratio 1.90). In 2020/2021, the period prevalence of anxiety or depression increased slightly among CEV children, but declined among the general population. Conclusions Differences in the period prevalence of recorded anxiety or depression in healthcare between CEV children and the general population were largely driven by a reduction in presentations to healthcare services by children in the general population during the pandemic. INTRODUCTION In March 2020, Welsh Government and the Welsh National Health Service sought to protect people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to severe illness or death from COVID19, advising them to \u2018shield\u2019 at home, that is, to remain indoors and minimise contact with others. To identify CEV people, a shielded patient list (SPL) was created, using an algorithm based on clinical code lists and applied centrally to patients\u2019 electronic health records.

Shielding was in place from 23 March 2020 to 16 August 2020 and reintroduced from 22 December 2020 to 1 April 2021.1 CEV children were encouraged to return to school at the end of August 2020 taking into account the low rate of severe disease and death from COVID- 19 among children, balanced against the harms of a lack of schooling and socialisation.3\nStudies have highlighted the detrimental impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on the mental health of CEV adults, with CEV individuals more likely to report increased depressive symptoms and anxiety4 and to have a clinical record of anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with those who were not CEV.1 Meanwhile, studies have reported decreased diagnoses of mental health conditions in primary care across the population as a whole during the pandemic5 6 (attributed to a reluctance to seek healthcare, or reduced access to services, rather than a decrease in need). However, there is limited evidence on how children accessed healthcare during the pandemic for their mental health, and no studies focusing on CEV children or children living with a CEV person.\nChildren are particularly vulnerable to indirect impacts of the pandemic.7 Drawing on evidence from longitudinal surveys,8\u201310 the department for education concluded that children\u2019s mental health declined during the pandemic, reporting that rates of probable mental health disorders were higher from 2020 than before.11 The data also highlighted variation in mental health trajectories; children with long- term health conditions were more likely to experience poor mental health during the pandemic.11 However, the extent to which these trends are attributable to the pandemic, or are a continuation of pre- existing upward trends, is unclear.\nAlmost 5000 CEV children were living in Wales by July 2020; approximately 3.9% of the Welsh CEV population.12 Children with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of behavioural and emotional problems and psychiatric disorders compared with their peers,13 but CEV children may be particularly susceptible to mental health difficulties relative to non- CEV children since the pandemic, due to additional restrictions imposed by shielding guidance, potentially exacerbating loneliness and isolation.14 CEV children may have also experienced heightened health anxiety due to their potential higher risk of severe illness from COVID- 19. Additionally, there were almost 14 400 school- aged children living with a CEV person in June 202015 who may be at greater risk of mental health difficulties due to both restrictions to protect the vulnerable members of their household, and fears of causing harm.16\nWe investigated the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on use of healthcare services for anxiety or depression in Wales, for CEV children, children living with a CEV person and children in the general population, using routinely collected population- level linked data. The primary aim was to determine whether CEV children or children living with a CEV person were more likely to have a record for anxiety or depression in primary or\nsecondary care during the pandemic compared with children in the general population. The secondary aim was to compare patterns of anxiety or depression in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 between CEV children and the general population, to place the impact of COVID- 19 and the shielding guidance in the context of longer- term patterns of healthcare use.\nMETHODS Study design and data sources This is a population- based cross- sectional cohort study using anonymised, linked, routinely collected health and administrative data for the population of Wales, UK, held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank (www.saildatabank.com). Within the SAIL Databank, encrypted linkage fields are used to link data anonymously from various sources at individual and household level (online supplemental appendix pp 1\u20132); known as anonymised linking fields (ALFs) for individuals and residential anonymised linking fields (RALFs) for residences.17 18 We used these to link multiple datasets in this study (table 1). General practices (GPs) opt- in to providing data to SAIL; currently, SAIL contains primary care data for around 80% of the Welsh population, and the available data are representative of the entire Welsh population with respect to age, sex and deprivation.19 The SAIL Databank was interrogated using DB2 Structured Query Language."

To minimise bias, we then adopted a conservative approach and included (1) children who were recorded as residents at the same RALF on 23 March 2020 and had an entry date of residence within 6 months of the entry date of\nthe CEV person, (2) children born to mothers who were recorded as resident at the same RALF as the CEV person or (3) children who shared the same maternal ALF as a younger CEV child. We excluded (1) adult care homes as these were unlikely to contain children20 and (2) RALFs containing more than 10 people, as the Unique Property Reference Number from which the RALF is derived is considered inaccurate in this case.21 This resulted in a total of 20 033 children in cohort 2.\nCohort 3: children in the general population Cohort 3 consisted of all other children who were alive, living in Wales and registered with an SAIL- supplying GP on 23 March 2020 (N=415 009).\nCEV children in Wales in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 CEV children) To explore longer- term patterns of anxiety or depression among children with the conditions included within the shielding guidance, we created a cohort of pre- COVID- 19 \u2018CEV\u2019 children who had similar health concerns to CEV children in a period prior to 2020. Creation of this prepandemic cohort enabled us to explore whether adverse mental health outcomes for CEV children during the pandemic were likely attributable to the shielding guidance, or whether CEV children experience poorer mental health compared with the general population regardless of having to shield. We included children who were alive, living in Wales and registered with an SAIL- supplying GP 1 year prior to the introduction of shielding (23 March 2019) and who had one or more of three of the health condition categories warranting inclusion on the SPL (respiratory illnesses, blood or bone cancer, and immunosuppression therapy). These categories were chosen as they only required the patient to have one of the listed codes within a given time period, and therefore children with these conditions could be identified with a high degree of certainty. We used International Classification of Diseases (ICD) V.10 diagnostic codes and Operating Procedures Codes Supplement (OPCS) Classification of Interventions and Procedures V.4 codes for these categories, which were taken from the SPL documentation and provided in the online supplemental appendix pp 4\u20135 . For comparison purposes, we also created a general population cohort of children aged 2\u201317 who were alive, living in Wales and registered with an SAIL- supplying GP as of 23 March 2019. A flow diagram of inclusion criteria for these cohorts is provided in the online supplemental appendix p 6. We performed a sensitivity analysis to confirm the validity of this approach (online supplemental appendix pp 7\u20139)."

If children had multiple records of anxiety or depression during the relevant time periods, we sequenced these and selected the record with the earliest date. Code lists were reviewed by a clinician with expertise in child psychiatry (JT) and are provided\nin the online supplemental appendix pp 10\u201314. The primary outcome was the time to the first record of anxiety or depression for the children in each cohort, and the secondary outcome was the period prevalence of anxiety or depression for the children in each cohort.\nCovariates: history of anxiety or depression We used the same process to identify children in the study population with a \u2018recent\u2019 or \u2018past\u2019 history of anxiety or depression, defined as any record in the year prior to the pandemic (23 March 2019\u201323 March 2020), and any record occurring any time before 23 March 2019, respectively.1\nCovariates: demographics We calculated age and determined Lower- layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) as of 23 March 2020. LSOA codes were derived from the Welsh Demographic Service Dataset based on the child\u2019s RALF, and used to ascertain deprivation quintiles and urban/rural classification by\nFigure 1 Flow diagram of the inclusion criteria for the creation of three study cohorts: clinically extremely vulnerable children, children living with a clinically extremely vulnerable person and children in the general population.

For CEV children, the HR remained significant when adjusting for demographic factors including age, sex, deprivation and rurality (table 5), and when adjusting for demographic factors and previous clinical history of anxiety or depression (table 6). However, for children living with a CEV person, the HR was no longer significant in either of the adjusted models. The unadjusted survival curves for each cohort are shown in figure 2.\nRisk of anxiety or depression in children in 2019/2020 In 2019/2020, in the unadjusted model there was an increased risk of having a record of anxiety or depression among the \u2018CEV\u2019 children compared with the general population (HR=1.94, 95% CI=1.31 to 2.87, p<0.001).

For CEV children, this pattern remained evident after adjusting for demographic differences and the likelihood of having a previous history of anxiety or depression. Although a small increase in risk was found for children living with a CEV person, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and previous history of anxiety and depression, this was no longer significant.\nBoth before and during the pandemic, the groups with the greatest risk of having a record for anxiety or depression were adolescents aged 13\u201317, and those with both a past and recent history of anxiety or depression. Females were also more likely than males to have a record for anxiety or depression in both time periods. These findings are in line with previous studies reporting worse mental health in female adolescents compared with male adolescents26; a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression in adolescents and females compared with younger children and males during the pandemic27;\nTable 3 Proportion of clinically extremely vulnerable children with different conditions contributing to underlying reasons to shield\nReason for shielding\nNumber and percentage of clinically extremely vulnerable children (n=3769)\nRare diseases 1227 (32.6%)\nOrgan disease 735 (19.5%)\nRespiratory illness 660 (17.5%)\nImmunosuppression therapy 491 (13%)\nCancer 147 (3.9%)\nTransplant 132 (3.5%)\nRenal dialysis 10 (0.3%)\nGeneral practice referred (reason unknown)\n582 (15.4%)\nOther (reason unknown) 22 (0.6%)\nIn children whose reasons for shielding were known (3165/3769), 6.3% (198/3165) had more than 1 condition.\nTable 4 Number of children who were censored, with no event, or who had a record of anxiety or depression during 2020/2021\nGeneral population Clinically extremely vulnerable children Children living with a clinically extremely vulnerable person\nN 415 009 3769 20 033\nDied (%) 12 (0.003) 6 (0.2) 0 (0.0)\nMoved out of Wales (%) 7297 (1.8) 68 (1.8) 245 (1.2)\nMoved to a non Secure Anonymised Information Linkagesupplying general practice (%) 5664 (1.4) 31 (0.8) 262 (1.3)\nNo event (%) 396 267 (95.5)\n3505 (93.0) 19 203 (95.9)\nAnxiety or depression during the pandemic 2020/2021 (%) 5769 (1.4) 159 (4.2) 323 (1.6)\nP atna).

Alternatively, if CEV children experienced the same increase in mental health needs as reported elsewhere among the general population, then these figures may mask unmet demand for mental health support among this group. A survey of adults supports the latter explanation, reporting increased anxiety and depressive symptoms among shielding individuals compared with non- shielding individuals.4 However, we have found no UK surveys focusing on the mental health of CEV children.\nOur finding that children living with a CEV person were at no greater risk of presenting with anxiety or depression during the pandemic compared with the general population (after controlling for other factors), could be interpreted in two ways. It is possible that the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children living with a CEV person was not as great as for CEV children, but this seems unlikely given that research has suggested increased anxiety among children who were shielding their siblings.16 Another explanation is that children living with a CEV person suffered from similar barriers to access to mental healthcare services to the general population and did not have the same routes to access that CEV children did. This explanation is supported by research with shielding families, which suggests that they have felt left behind and that children living with a CEV person may have \u2018fallen under the radar of educational and healthcare professionals\u2019.16"

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first population- based study examining the effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic on healthcare use for anxiety or depression among CEV children and children living with a CEV person in Wales. Linkage of population- based routinely collected data is a valuable method for generating evidence with a high level\nof external validity and applicability for policy- making. A strength of this study is the comparison of 2020/2021 data with prepandemic 2019/2020 data for CEV children and children in the general population. Another strength is the use of a novel approach using multiple linked datasets to identify a cohort of children living with a CEV person during the pandemic.\nThis study used the SPL to create cohorts of children identified as CEV and a cohort of children living with a CEV person. There was heterogeneity within the SPL in terms of the type and severity of individuals\u2019 underlying conditions; the manner in which people were added to the list (via the algorithm or clinical judgement); the time point that people were added to the list; and the extent to which people followed the shielding guidance. In addition, the impact of following shielding guidance is likely to have varied due to individual circumstances and the level of support received. The 2019 \u2018CEV\u2019 cohort was a relatively small sample and for pragmatic reasons, only included children with a subset of the conditions included in the shielding guidance. To identify children living with a CEV person, we adopted a conservative approach and included children only if they were living with their mother. We took this approach in order to minimise bias and increase the generalisability of the findings; however, this approach is likely to have underestimated the number of children living with a CEV person. Finally, this study focused on healthcare use using clinical codes. Routinely collected healthcare data does not capture self- reported health, and is likely to underestimate the burden of common mental disorders in the population.31 Focusing on healthcare use with routine data alone cannot tell us about the underlying reasons for changes in utilisation, or the scale of mental health need."
