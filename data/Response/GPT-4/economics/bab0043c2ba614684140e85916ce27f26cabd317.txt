Evaluating the Optimal Value and Duration of Cash Transfers: This study points out that the cash transfer amount was perceived as insufficient by beneficiaries. Future research could focus on determining the optimal value and duration of cash transfers needed to significantly mitigate the economic burden of TB care. This research could include experimental designs to test different levels of cash transfers and their impact on treatment adherence, economic stability, and health outcomes.

Exploring the Impact of Cash Transfers on TB Treatment Outcomes and Stigma Reduction: Given the preliminary findings on the potential of cash transfers to support treatment adherence and reduce stigma associated with TB, a deeper investigation into these effects is warranted. Studies could specifically measure how cash transfers, both conditional and unconditional, affect TB treatment completion rates, patient well-being, and social stigma. This could involve both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to capture a comprehensive view of the impact.

Assessing the Feasibility and Impact of Integrating Microcredit Options with TB Care: The suggestion from beneficiaries for access to credit rather than small monthly cash transfers highlights a potential area for innovation in social protection strategies for TB-affected households. Future research could explore the design, feasibility, and impact of integrating microcredit services with TB care programs, including examining repayment models, interest rates, and the potential to alleviate economic burden without causing additional financial strain.

Investigating the Role of Social Health Insurance (SHI) in Complementing Cash Transfers for TB Care: While SHI is highly valued, there are noted barriers to enrollment and challenges in utilization. Research could focus on understanding these barriers in more depth and exploring interventions to enhance SHI accessibility and effectiveness for TB patients. This could include studies on the integration of SHI with cash transfers and how such combinations affect health service utilization, out-of-pocket expenditures, and overall health outcomes.

Longitudinal Studies on the Long-term Effects of Social Protection Interventions on TB-Affected Families: There is a need to understand the long-term effects of social protection interventions, including cash transfers and SHI, on the economic stability and health outcomes of TB-affected families. Longitudinal studies could provide insights into how these interventions affect families over time, including their ability to recover from the economic impact of TB, sustain treatment outcomes, and improve their quality of life. This research would be critical in designing sustainable and impactful social protection policies for TB-affected populations.
