    "abstractText": "Background: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Deep Learning (DL) machine for the detection of adenomyosis on uterine ultrasonographic images and compare it to intermediate ultrasound skilled trainees. Methods: Prospective observational study were conducted between 1 and 30 April 2022. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) diagnosis of adenomyosis was investigated by an experienced sonographer on 100 fertile-age patients. Videoclips of the uterine corpus were recorded and sequential ultrasound images were extracted. Intermediate ultrasoundskilled trainees and DL machine were asked to make a diagnosis reviewing uterine images. We evaluated and compared the accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score, specificity and negative predictive value of the DL model and the trainees for adenomyosis diagnosis. Results: Accuracy of DL and intermediate ultrasound-skilled trainees for the diagnosis of adenomyosis were 0.51 (95% CI, 0.48\u20130.54) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60\u20130.79), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of DL were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.38\u20130.48), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79\u20130.85) and 0.46 (0.42\u20130.50), respectively, whereas intermediate ultrasound-skilled trainees had sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.52\u20130.86), specificity of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.58\u20130.79) and F1-score of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.43\u20130.66). Conclusions: In this preliminary study DL model showed a lower accuracy but a higher specificity in diagnosing adenomyosis on ultrasonographic images compared to intermediate-skilled trainees.",

            "text": "Adenomyosis is a benign gynecological disease described by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, as well as reactive hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the muscular layer [1]. Adenomyosis can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea and infertility [2\u20136].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 1724. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20031724 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nPathological examination of myometrial specimen remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and its estimated prevalence ranges from 21% to 36% among hysterectomized women. However, only a small, selected percentage of symptomatic women with adenomyosis undergoes hysterectomy, and the real prevalence of the disease is underestimated [3,7\u20139]. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) represents the method of choice for the non-invasive diagnosis of adenomyosis with adequate sensitivity and specificity [10\u201312]. Standardization of terminology for the description of myometrium with Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA) allowed universal recognition and assessment of typical adenomyotic ultrasound features [2,3,13]. Despite being low cost and easily accessible, TVUS has some limitations for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. It is an operator-dependent technique with adequate diagnostic performance and inter-operator reproducibility only if performed by expert sonographers [10,14,15]. In particular, Rasmussen et al. observed a moderate intra-operator agreement and a poor inter-operator agreement among medium experienced raters for the diagnosis of adenomyosis [14]. Therefore, expert sonographers in dedicated centers are recommended for the diagnosis of adenomyosis [9], with an overall TVUS sensibility and specificity of 81% and 87%, respectively [12]. Recently, the need to improve efficiency in all clinical settings using technological advances led to the development of powerful instruments such as artificial intelligence (AI) [16]. AI is defined as the use of several complex algorithm-based applications that can solve problems by simulating human cognitive functions, including data learning and processing, problem solving and decision making [17]. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can be accounted among the newest developed technologies in this area. DL is a subfield of machine learning, able to consistently add new data with self-learning ability, thus increasing the performance of the application itself and able to find correlations that humans cannot [18]. AI applicability for healthcare purposes has already been partially investigated and has shown promising results in several medical fields, including gynecology. In particular, AI in gynecological studies was tested for several tasks on medical images, including discriminating malignancy or benignity of ovarian masses, diagnosing cervical cancer, staging endometrial cancer, or diagnosing rectosigmoid endometriosis [17,19,20]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has ever assessed the accuracy of DL in the diagnosis of adenomyosis using TVUS. Therefore, the aims of this study are to first evaluate the diagnostic performance of DL in the diagnosis of adenomyosis on uterine ultrasonographic images and compare it to that of intermediate ultrasound skilled trainees."

The same metrics were used to assess the performance of intermediate skilled trainees for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and were informally compared with those obtained with DL machine.

During the 2D gray scale mode TVUS examination, an expert sonographer classified uteruses in three groups: homogenous myometrial echogenicity, fibroids or adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was diagnosed when two or more of the following sonographic criteria were present: globular uterus appearance, asymmetrical thickening, hypoechogenic myometrial cysts, hyperechoic islands, fan-shaped shadowing, echogenic subendometrial lines and buds, junctional zone irregolarities [2,3,8]. Otherwise, uterine fibroids were diagnosed as well-defined round lesions of the myometrium, frequently with shadows at the edge or an internal fan-shaped shadow [2,24]. For each patient, presence of deep endometriotic lesions and endometrioma was also investigated according to IDEA consensus [25,26]."

Uterine boundaries were manually traced in the sagittal scan including a region of interest (ROI) that clearly highlighted ultrasound features of adenomyosis or fibroids, according to literature. These ultrasound images were used for the construction, validation and testing of the DL system. The available dataset of 100 ultrasound video clips was divided in a random and balanced way into three parts: training (n = 30), validation (n = 30) and testing set (n = 40). The training set was used to train the network by teaching it the parameters of the models. Two architectures were considered: ResNet and Vgg. Among these, Vgg13, Vgg19, ResNet 18 and ResNet 34 models were used. The validation set was used for early stopping, which saves the network weights at the point of best performance, and for optimizing the hyper-parameters. The hyper-parameters used were as follows:\n- Pre-trained and un-trained networks on Microsoft Common Objects in Context; - Batch size: 8-16-32; - Patience: 3-5-10.\nL1 and L2 regularizations have been implemented in the network. To find the best combination of hyperparameters, Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) was\nused as a sampler and Successive Halving Pruner (SHP) as a pruner. To reduce over-fitting, data augmentation was also applied, which generates additional training models using random image transformations. To this end, the captured images were extracted with the\nresolution reduced from 300 \u00d7 300 pixels to 224 \u00d7 224 pixels, random horizontal flips and vertical flips were employed and Gaussian blur was applied.

            "text": "Despite AI recently gaining popularity in the field of medical imaging and has experienced increased its applications in gynecology, no study has ever used this tool in the diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis. Therefore, this study can be considered a proof-ofconcept for this issue. Recently, DL based on artificial neural networks with representation learning has been adopted to help operators to untangle among differential diagnoses. In the present study, the DL model showed a low accuracy in the diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis (51%). This observation may reflect the complexity of the disease. Indeed, adenomyosis is a heterogeneous disease that can have several phenotypes, varying per extension (diffuse, focal or adenomyoma) and location (internal myometrial or junctional invasion) within the myometrium [4,11]. As secondary finding, the accuracy of intermediate ultrasound-skilled trainees (70%) resulted higher than that of the DL. Moreover, these trainees showed a higher sensitivity (72%) but a lower specificity (69%) compared to those of the DL. This over-diagnosis could be explained by the tertiary center setting in which frequency of adenomyosis is estimated higher than general population and the offline assessment of uterine images instead of personal execution of TVUS. Conversely, the DL model showed a higher specificity, being more effective in identifying healthy uteruses, with low false positive values. Indeed, the DL model could be a useful tool to exclude adenomyosis where it is not present and disprove the over diagnosis of less experienced operators, avoiding unnecessary secondlevel examinations or over treatment cases. Limitations of our study are the small sample size and the monocentric design, reducing the generalizability of our results. Larger multicentric studies are needed to better evaluate the potential clinical aid of AI in the diagnosis of adenomyosis. Although the lack of histological confirmation of adenomyosis may be considered another limitation of the study, pathological examination is unethical in patients without any indication for surgery. On the other hand, to date, an experienced sonographer must be considered an adequate alternative to histological diagnosis in women who are asymptomatic or have not completed their reproductive plan. The impossibility to fully investigate the JZ by using 3D-TVUS examination and to evaluate translesional vascularity through Power Doppler mode may have influenced the diagnostic performance of the expert sonographer firstly and then that of the trainees and the DL machine. In order to improve the diagnostic performance of the DL in diagnosing adenomyosis, future research can be focused to specific training of the DL machine on the recognition of each of ultrasound criteria suggestive for adenomyosis. Moreover, more studies are needed to evaluate any improvement of DL performance, adding other sonographic signs (i.e., translesional vascularity using Power Doppler and junctional zone thickness or irregularities at 3D TVUS) and/or clinical data (i.e., presence and severity of pain symptoms and uterine tenderness)."

Sensitivity and F1-score of the intermediate skilled trainees were higher than those of DL as well. However, DL model showed potential for excluding adenomyotic uteri, with higher specificity and NPV than those of intermediate skilled trainees. Larger multicentric studies with adjuvant investigation of JZ by 3D-TVUS and translesional vascularity through Power Doppler are needed to better evaluate the potential clinical application of AI in the diagnosis of adenomyosis.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.R. and E.S.; Methodology, G.C., M.G. and A.C.A.; Software, F.A.G. and M.G.C.A.C.; Validation, A.R., P.C., A.T. and R.S.; Formal Analysis, F.A.G., J.L. and L.L.; Investigation, I.G.; Data Curation I.G. and A.T.; Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation, M.G. and A.C.A.; Writing\u2014Review & Editing, G.C., L.L., J.L. and A.R.; Supervision, A.M.; Project Administration, D.R.
