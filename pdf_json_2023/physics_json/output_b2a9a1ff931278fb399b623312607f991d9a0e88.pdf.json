    "abstractText": "Malaria is a persistent illness that is still a public health issue. On the other hand, marine organisms are considered a rich source of anti\u2010infective drugs and other medically significant compounds. Herein, we reported the isolation of the actinomycete associated with the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella. Using \"one strain many com\u2010 pounds\" (OSMAC) approach, a suitable strain was identified and then sub\u2010cultured in three different media (M1, ISP2 and OLIGO). The extracts were evaluated for their in\u2010vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum strain and subsequently analyzed by Liquid chromatography coupled with high\u2010resolution mass spectrometry (LC\u2010HR\u2010MS). In addition, MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used to statistically analyze the LC\u2010MS data. Finally, Molecular docking was car\u2010 ried out for the dereplicated metabolites against lysyl\u2010tRNA synthetase (PfKRS1). The phylogenetic study of the 16S rRNA sequence of the actinomycete isolate revealed its affiliation to Streptomyces genus. Antimalarial screening revealed that ISP2 media is the most active against Plasmodium falciparum strain. Based on LC\u2010HR\u2010MS based metabo\u2010 lomics and multivariate analyses, the static cultures of the media, ISP2 (ISP2\u2010S) and M1 (M1\u2010S), are the optimal media for metabolites production. OPLS\u2010DA suggested that quinone derivatives are abundant in the extracts with the high\u2010 est antimalarial activity. Fifteen compounds were identified where eight of these metabolites were correlated to the observed antimalarial activity of the active extracts. According to molecular docking experiments, saframycin Y3 and juglomycin E showed the greatest binding energy scores (\u20106.2 and \u20105.13) to lysyl\u2010tRNA synthetase (PfKRS1), respectively. Using metabolomics and molecular docking investigation, the quinones, saframycin Y3 (5) and juglo\u2010 mycin E (1) were identified as promising antimalarial therapeutic candidates. Our approach can be used as a first evaluation stage in natural product drug development, facilitating the separation of chosen metabolites, particularly biologically active ones.",

            "text": "Malaria is a long-standing disease and remains a public health problem that most likely originating in Africa [1]. It affects 30 million people globally and kills about 2.5 million people each year, mostly children under the age of five. Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains are now ubiquitous in all endemic locations around the world [2], and there is also evidence of the emergence of resistance against artemisinin-based combination therapies, which now serve as first line drugs for the treatment of P. falciparum [3]. Therefore, there is a growing need to identify new drugs. Marine ecosystems are composed of taxonomically and biologically diverse macro- and microorganisms that can withstand pressure, salinity, and temperature extremes. They are capable of producing unique compounds with novel therapeutic applications that aren\u2019t found in their terrestrial equivalents [4]. Sponges (phylum Porifera) are among the oldest and most abundant multicellular marine organisms. The Red Sea sponge, Callyspongia siphonella (family Callyspongiidae) is found in shallow water throughout the Gulfs of Aqaba and Suez mostly deeper than 5 m [5]. On the other hand, microbial populations, including archaea, bacteria, fungus and viruses abound in the interiors of different sponge species [6]. So far, at least 32 bacterial phyla and candidate groups have been identified in marine sponges, including Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospira, Cyanobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria. Actinomycetes, particularly those associated with marine sponges are well-known for their capacity to generate novel lead molecules including phenazines, peptides and alkaloids of clinical and pharmacological significance, such as: antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [6\u20138]. However, many secondary metabolites encoded in actinomycete genomes are yet to be found, owing to the fact that these genes are not transcribed under standard laboratory conditions. The \"one strain many compounds\" (OSMAC) strategy involves manipulating fermentation conditions and is an efficient way to activate metabolic pathways that are either silent or poorly expressed [9]. In the present study, the actinomycete Streptomyces associated with the Red Sea sponge C. siphonella was isolated, identified and cultured in various culture media utilizing the OSMAC approach to determine the optimal media for the production of beneficial secondary metabolites. Antimalarial screening was performed to assess the effectiveness of Streptomyces species fermented extracts against P. falciparum strain. LC-HRMS assisted chemical investigation followed by multivariate data statistical analysis (MVDA) was carried out in order to reduce the amount of data collected and find correlation and differentiation among the samples tested. Finally, molecular docking analysis was performed for the suggested compounds against the malarial active site, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (PfKRS1)."

The Invertebrates Department, National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Red Sea Branch, Hurghada, Egypt, was given a voucher sample (NIOF730/2021). The sponge was identified by ElSayd Abed El-Aziz (Department of Invertebrates Lab., National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Red Sea Branch, 84511 Hurghada, Egypt). Sponge biomass was transferred to plastic bag containing seawater and transported to the laboratory. Sponge specimens were rinsed in sterile seawater, cut into pieces of ca. \u02dc1 cm3, and then thoroughly homogenized in a sterile mortar with 10 volumes of sterile seawater. The supernatant was diluted in ten-fold series (10-1, 10-2, 10-3) and subsequently plated out on agar plates."

Chimeric sequences were identified by using the Pintail program [12]. The genus-level affiliation of the sequence was validated using the Ribosomal Database Project Classifier. The genus-level identification of all the sequences was done with RDP Classifier (-g 16srrna, -f allrank) and validated with the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA) (search and classify option). An alignment was calculated again using the SINA web aligner (variability profile: bacteria) [13]. Gap-only position were removed with trimAL (-noallgaps).

RAxML (-f a -m GTRGAMMA \u2013x 12345 \u2013p 12345 -# 1000) and the estimated model was used with 1000 bootstrap resamples to generate the maximum-likelihood tree [14].

According to Abdelmohsen et\u00a0al. 2014 [17], the recovered ethyl acetate extracts were subjected to metabolic investigation using LC-HR-ESI-MS. We employed a Synapt G2 HDMS quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, USA) coupled to an Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography system. On an Accela HPLC (Thermo FisherFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), extracts diluted to 1 mg/mL were examined in triplicates. The HPLC column was an ACE (Hichrom Limited, Reading, UK) C18, 75 mm x 3.0 mm, 5 \u00b5m column. The mobile phase composed of purified water (A) and acetonitrile (B), each containing 0.1% formic acid. The gradient programme began with 10% B, raised B linearly in 30 min to 100% B at a flow rate of 300 \u00b5L/min, remained isocratic for 5 min, and then linearly decreased B to 10% B in 1 min. Before the subsequent injection, the column was re-equilibrated with 10% B for 9 min. Each sample\u2019s analysis took 45 minutes in total. The injection volume was 10 \u00b5L, and 12 \u00b0C was kept in the tray temperature [18]. The high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed using both positive and negative ESI ionization modes in conjunction with a spray voltage of 4.5 kV, a capillary temperature of 320 \u00b0C, and a mass range of m/z 150\u20131500. Based on the predetermined parameters, the MS dataset was analyzed, and data were retrieved using Mzmine 2.20. Chromatogram builder and chromatogram deconvolution were detected alongside mass ion peak detection. The isotopic peaks of grouper were used to differentiate isotopes, and the local minimum search algorithm was addressed. Using the gap-filling peak finder, missing peaks were highlighted. A complicated search and an adduct search were also conducted. Afterwards, peak identification and the prediction of the chemical formula were applied to the processed data set. The corresponding extract\u2019s positive and negative ionization mode data sets were dereplicated and compared to the DNP (Dictionary of Natural Products) databases. ChemBioDraw Ultra 14.0 software was used to create chemical structure drawings."

            "text": "The scientific community is always fascinated by natural products. Natural products now contain distinctive chemical heterogeneity as a result of evolution over millions of years, giving them drug-like qualities and a variety of biological activities. They have offered a number of medicinal lead compounds. A significant number of these lead chemicals were identified from microbial populations. Actinobacteria are a substantial source of medically relevant chemicals, including antiinfective medicines; It contributed over 80% of the antibiotics currently used in medicine, with Streptomyces\naccounting for 50% of those compounds [35]. As a result of our continuous attempts to find bioactive natural compounds with antimalarial potential, the actinomycete associated with the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella was isolated and identified as Streptomyces sp. US4 . Using OSMAC approach, three different media (M1, ISP2 and OLIGO) were used to subculture the isolated strain in order to activate silent and poorly expressed gene clusters. Extracts were screened invitro\u00a0 against Plasmodium falciparum strain, and since the antimalarial results were effective, in particular for the extract ISP2-S, this encouraged us to explore their chemical constituents using the most popular efficient method, untargeted LC-HR-MS metabolomic profiling. The obtained LC-HR-MS data was statistically treated using MetaboAnalyst- a Multivariate data statistical analysis (MVA) platform- in order to reduce the vast amount of data obtained and detect correlation and differentiation among the tested samples [36, 37]. The unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) method and the supervised method Partial Least Squares- Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that the culture extracts ISP2-S and M1-S were dispersed from the others indicating there chemical diversity, which is further corroborated by their distinct patterns in the heatmap plot.\nThe relation between the extracts and their antimalarial activity was investigated using OPLS-DA method. As shown in the OPLS-DA score plot (Fig.\u00a06A) there are clear differences between active and inactive extracts. Where, active extracts clustered together, indicating that they contain related metabolites that could be responsible for their remarkable antiplasmodial activity.\nThe bioactive discriminatory metabolites that may be related to the observed antimalarial activity of the active extracts were predicted using the OPLS-DA-derived S-Plots (Fig.\u00a0 6B) (Table\u00a0 3). Eight metabolites were dereplicated using the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP), with Quinone derivatives (1\u20135) being the predominant metabolites (Table\u00a0 3) (Fig.\u00a0 8). The distribution of these bioactivity-linked metabolites among the extracts studied was depicted by the heatmap in Fig.\u00a09; it was revealed that Juglomycin E (1) (C14H10O7) corresponding to m/z (retention time in min.) 291.04957 [M_H] + (2.1175) is common in the most active extracts, ISP2-S and ISP2-L.\nThe aforementioned findings revealed the abundance of quinone derivatives in the most active extracts. Since various studies revealed that drugs containing quinone nuclei exhibited promising anti-malarial activities [1, 28], it was crucial to apply docking analysis to examine these chemical compounds in more detail, determine their mode of action, and look into the connection between the chemical components and the resulting antimalarial activity. On the other hand, the focus on target-based drug discovery and finding targeted antimalarial drugs that treat all stages of the disease became a need. Previously published data revealed the presence of various malarial targets that affects different stages of parasite infection [8], among them, lysyl-tRNA synthetase, [38] which is an enzyme central to protein translation and responsible for protein formation [39]. Earlier studies revealed that lysyl-tRNA synthetase could be considered as an attractive, druggable, antimalarial target that can be selectively inhibits protein synthesis and prevents liver and blood-stage proliferation [34\u201338].

Interestingly, all selected metabolites showed binding affinities ranging from (-6.2 and -3.23). Saframycin Y3 (5) and juglomycin E (1), two quinone derivatives, showed the highest values (-6.2 and -5.13, respectively), followed by \u03c9-hydroxyaloesaponarin II (4), which had an energy score of -4.82. Therefore, among the variety of chemical components present in the analyzed extracts, the in silico docking method prioritized the putative active metabolites Saframycin Y3 (5) and juglomycin E (1) as promising antimalarial candidates.\nJuglomycin E (1) is a derivative of juglomycins [41], which are broad spectrum naphthoquinone antibiotics naturally produced by different Streptomyces species [42, 43]. Saframycin Y3 (5) is a naturally produced active compound belongs to saframycins, which are\nheterocyclic quinone groups [44]. Saframycins are well known antitumor antibiotics produced by the actinomycetes strain Streptomyces lavendulae [45]."

The OSMAC technique was used to isolate and subculture the actinomycete, Streptomyces associated with the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella in three distinct media (M1, ISP2, and OLIGO). The extracts were then examined for their antimalarial effectiveness and chemical diversity. The ISP2 extract showed significant antimalarial efficacy. On the other hand, many metabolites of diverse structural types, primarily quinones, have been found as a result of our study of this species. In silico studies revealed that the metabolites saframycin Y3 (5) and juglomycin E (1) have a high and comparable docking score within all other dereplicated molecules. The focus of this work was on the special role of actinomycetes related to marine species as an untapped source of active metabolites for the development of efficient natural antimalarial medicines. Finally, the journey of finding the best drug-like molecules is a difficult and continual process that takes a lot of time, however, this combination of tools and techniques acts as\na model for the development of future targeted antimalarial drugs. Therefore, our research focuses on methods for accelerating the development of effective lysyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors with therapeutic potential, and could be used to guide the creation of novel antimalarial drugs that can inhibit lysyl-tRNA synthetase. We suggest that future isolation and identification efforts to be only focus on the candidates that scored highest energy binding affinities in the docking study.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12866\u2011 023\u2011 03094\u20113.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Figure (S1).
