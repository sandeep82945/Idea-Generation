 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Investigate the learnability of constant depth quantum circuit distributions. The paper shows hardness for super-logarithmic depth circuits, but leaves open the complexity for small constant depths like d=2 or d=3. 

2. Improve the constants for approximate t-design generation. The paper uses large constants from existing bounds, but suggests numerical calculations could improve the constants for small t like t=4 or t=8. This could lead to stronger average-case hardness results.

3. Explore cryptographic applications of the average-case hardness results. The paper suggests the connection to cryptography merits further study. One direction is using the hardness results to construct cryptographic primitives. 

4. Prove stronger versions of the "far from uniform" property. The paper resolves a variant of the conjecture by Aaronson and Chen, but suggests trying to improve the constants or prove it from weaker design properties.

5. Investigate learnability in other learning models like PAC or agnostic learning. The paper focuses on statistical query learning, but the techniques may extend to other models. Exploring the complexity there could reveal further insights.
