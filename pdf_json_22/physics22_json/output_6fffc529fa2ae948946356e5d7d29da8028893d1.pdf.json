The channel space of \u03c0N , \u03c0\u2206, \u03c3N , \u03c1N , \u03b7N , K\u039b and K\u03a3 is extended by adding the \u03c9N final state. The spectra of N\u2217 and \u2206 resonances are extracted in terms of complex poles of the scattering amplitudes, based on the result of a global fit to a worldwide collection of data, in the energy region from the \u03c0N threshold to center-of-mass energy z = 2.3 GeV. A negative value of the \u03c9N elastic spin-averaged scattering length is extracted, questioning the existence of bound states of the \u03c9 meson in the nuclear matter.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe scattering of light mesons and baryons, starting from the pion-nucleon channel, has been a topic of interest for many decades and continues to be so. On the one hand, such reactions reveal crucial information to obtain a deeper understanding of the strong interaction, on the other hand, the output from the study of such scattering processes can be used as input for further research, such as nuclear structure or nuclear astrophysics. On the fundamental level, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) governs the hadronic interactions. However, due to color confinement, QCD cannot be applied directly when the energy is not high enough. To deal with non-perturbative problems at low energies, chiral perturbation theory [1\u2013 11] was developed, based on the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of light flavor quarks and regarding the light hadrons as basic degrees of freedom, with the pseudoscalar mesons being the quasi Goldstone bosons. By pertubative expansions in the meson masses and the momenta, the near-threshold observables can be well reproduced, see e.g. [12\u201319], and some low-lying resonances e.g. the \u2206(1232) isobar and the Roper resonance can also be treated, see e.g. [20\u201329].\nAnother challenging subject is the intermediate energy region: though experimental observations are abundant, the dynamics becomes more involved as more interaction channels open, and theoretical approaches are further complicated by the appearance of a large amount of resonances. In this region, the effective field theory description breaks down while perturbative QCD is not yet applicable. Extracting the resonances from experimental data is, thus, a fundamental task of great importance, which cannot be trivially accomplished, since most of the states do not exhibit a typical Breit-Wigner\n\u2217 yuf.wang@fz-juelich.de\nbehavior. To attack this problem, efforts were made by partial wave analyses [30, 31] restrained to \u03c0N elastic scattering, resulting in most of the resonances known today. However, due to the fact that some states may not couple strongly to \u03c0N [32], coupled-channel anaylses are also necessary. Straightforwardly, the phenomenological inputs can be unitarized or re-summed [33\u201338], reproducing unitary amplitudes with complex poles on the unphysical Riemann sheet as the resonances. Furthermore, though complicated, coupled-channel models evolving under dynamical scattering equations [39\u201355] do not only keep the unitarity but also globally lead to a better analytical behavior with fewer model artefacts in the complex energy plane.\nThe approach applied in this paper is called the Ju\u0308lichBonn (Ju\u0308Bo) model, which has experienced three decades of development. Its core is a Lippmann\u2013Schwingerlike equation, taking tree-level diagrams and correlated two-pion exchange as the kernel. Based on early studies on meson-meson and K\u2212N interactions [39\u201341], the approach was first applied to \u03c0N elastic scattering in Refs. [42, 43]. Its early coupled-channel extensions (including \u03c0\u03c0N and \u03b7N) can be found in Refs. [44\u201346]. In Ref. [49] the analytical structures of the amplitudes obtained by this model are systematically studied, enabling the extraction of resonances as poles in a modern way. In Refs. [50, 51], the model has progressed to the zerostrangeness kaon-hyperon channels K\u039b, K\u03a3 and higher partial waves up to J = 9/2, with the center-of-mass energy up to 2.3 GeV. A major step towards a reliable determination of the light baryon spectrum based on an extensive high-quality data base with the extension of the framework to meson photoproduction was achieved in Refs. [53, 56, 57]. Moreover, in Refs. [54, 55] the approach was adapted to include virtual photons and was applied in the first-ever coupled-channel study of pion and eta electroproduction data. Besides the light mesonbaryon scattering and photoproduction processes, the Pc states in the hidden-charm sector were also studied with ar X iv :2 20 8.\n03 06\n1v 3\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 2\n1 O\nct 2\n02 2\n2 the Ju\u0308Bo model [58, 59].\nTo summarize, the hadronic Ju\u0308lich-Bonn model is one of the theoretically best founded tools for studying the spectrum of the light-flavored baryon resonances. So far, the maximum energy considered in the model is 2.3 GeV but certain channels like \u03c9N have not been considered. To further refine the model and to enrich the resulting physics, here we extend this model by adding the \u03c9N channel. Furthermore, the \u03c9 can be considered as the first vector meson regarded as a stable particle in this approach.\nReaching beyond the completion of our model, the \u03c9N channel is of interest for several reasons. It has been found that the spontaneous broken chiral symmetry of QCD shows a tendency of restoration as the density of nucleons gets larger in the nuclear matter, as signaled e.g. by dropping vector meson masses [60\u201362], although this particular claim is at odds with earlier calculations [63]. Much experimental and theoretical work has been done in this field. On the experimental side, the pertinent signals are usually of electromagnetic nature. For a review, see e.g. [64]. Due to the vector meson dominance [65], the \u03b3N interaction is dominated by \u03c1N , \u03c9N and \u03c6N . The \u03c1 meson is very broad and would not behave like a quasi-particle when it is in-medium, while the direct \u03c6NN coupling is suppressed due to the nearly pure ss\u0304 component of \u03c6. In this respect, \u03c9N can be considered as the most important channel. Additionally, the details of \u03c9N interaction are essential for understanding the equation of state of the neutron stars [66].\nAccording to the low-density theorem [67], the additional in-medium self-energy of the \u03c9 is proportional to the elastic scattering amplitude of \u03c9N . Therefore, the elastic \u03c9N amplitude provides crucial information about the in-medium \u03c9. This holds especially for the real part of the spin-averaged \u03c9N scattering length, which indicates whether or not the \u03c9 can form bound states in the medium. However, this scattering length cannot be observed directly by experiments. On the theoretical side, even the sign of the spin-averaged \u03c9N scattering length is still an open question. Results based on QCD sum rules [68\u201370] support an attractive force in the \u03c9N system from the scattering length, contradicting other analyses [34\u201338, 48, 71\u201374]. Comprehensive models like the current one, which extract the scattering length constrained by a global fit to all possible data sets, are needed to clarify this issue.\nThis paper is organized as the follows. In Sect. II we outline the underlying theoretical framework of the model, especially the structure of the scattering equation. All the important information about the fit, like the numerical details and the fit to the data of \u03c9N channel, as well as the two different solutions to estimate the uncertainties, are displayed and discussed in Sect. III. Sect. IV contains the results concerning the hadron spectrum (baryon resonances) and the scattering lengths, with discussions on the resulting physics. Sect. V presents the conclusions of this work and some perspectives for further studies. The expressions for the observables in the \u03c9N channel are shown in Appendix A. The partial wave amplitudes of \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c9N interaction are given in Appendix B. Tables containing the coupling strengths of the resonances to the effective three-body channels (\u03c0\u2206, \u03c3N and \u03c1N) are given in Appendix C. Fit results for channels other than \u03c9N can be found on the website [75]. Further details of the theoretical framework are summarized in the supplemental material [76].\nII. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nIn the current study, the \u03c0N , \u03c0\u03c0N , \u03b7N , K\u039b, K\u03a3 and \u03c9N channels are considered. The \u03c0\u03c0N system is simulated by three effective channels, the \u03c0\u2206, \u03c3N and \u03c1N . The threshold of each channel is shown in Fig. 1. Note that the width of the \u03c9 meson is much smaller than its mass, and is thus not considered in this work.\nThe master formula of this model is the following scattering equation:\nT\u00b5\u03bd(p \u2032\u2032, p\u2032, z) = V\u00b5\u03bd(p \u2032\u2032, p\u2032, z)\n+ \u2211 \u03ba \u222b \u221e 0 p2dpV\u00b5\u03ba(p \u2032\u2032, p, z)G\u03ba(p, z)T\u03ba\u03bd(p, p \u2032, z) , (1)\nwhere T denotes the scattering amplitude, V denotes the interaction kernel (the potential), p\u2032 and p\u2032\u2032 are the threemomenta of the initial and final states in the center-ofmass frame, respectively, z is the center-of-mass energy, which is related to p\u2032 and p\u2032\u2032 by the on-shell conditions when calculating physical observables. Further, \u00b5, \u03bd and \u03ba are the channel labels denoting the meson-baryon system with specific isospin (I), angular momentum (J , up to 9/2), spin (S) and orbital angular momentum L. G\u03ba(p, z) is the propagator of the intermediate channel:\nG\u03ba(z, p) = { (z \u2212 E\u03ba \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba + i0+)\u22121 (if \u03ba is a two-body channel) ,[ z \u2212 E\u03ba \u2212 \u03c9\u03ba \u2212 \u03a3\u03ba(z, p) + i0+ ]\u22121 (if \u03ba is an effective channel) .\n(2)\nFurther, E\u03ba, \u03c9\u03ba denote the energies of the baryon and the meson in channel \u03ba, respectively, with a relativistic dispersion relation, e.g. E\u03ba = \u221a p2 +M2\u03ba . For the quasi\nthree-body channels, \u03a3\u03ba is the self-energy function of the unstable particle (\u2206, \u03c3, \u03c1). Note that such kind of propagators are derived from (old-fashioned) time-ordered per-\nturbation theory (TOPT) [77] rather than the modern covariant convention. In combination with a partialwave projection, the application of TOPT reduces the fully relativistic Bethe-Salpeter equation [78] to the onedimensional integral of Eq. (1). Accordingly, the potential V is also constructed using TOPT.\nIn principle the potential V in Eq. (1) can contain any two-particle irreducible term. To simplify the calculation, the following separation is performed:\nT = TNP + TP . (3)\nSpecifically, TNP is generated only by potentials from tand u-channel exchange and contact diagrams, denoted as V NP :\nTNP\u00b5\u03bd (p \u2032\u2032, p\u2032, z) = V NP\u00b5\u03bd (p \u2032\u2032, p\u2032, z)\n+ \u2211 \u03ba \u222b \u221e 0 p2dpV NP\u00b5\u03ba (p \u2032\u2032, p, z)G\u03ba(p, z)T NP \u03ba\u03bd (p, p \u2032, z) ,\n(4)\nwhereas TP is constructed via\nTP\u00b5\u03bd(p \u2032\u2032, p\u2032, z) = \u2211 i,j \u0393a\u00b5,i(p \u2032\u2032)(D\u22121)ij(z)\u0393 c \u03bd,j(p \u2032) . (5)\nHere, i, j are the indices of the s-channel poles, \u0393a\u00b5,i is the dressed vertex function describing the annihilation of the ith resonance to channel \u00b5, and similar for \u0393c\u03bd,j (creation of the resonance from channel \u03bd). Also, D\u22121 is the propagator of the s-channel resonances related to the self-energies \u03a3ij :\n\u0393a\u00b5,i(p \u2032\u2032) = \u03b3a\u00b5,i(p \u2032\u2032)\n+ \u2211 \u03ba \u222b \u221e 0 p2dpTNP\u00b5\u03ba (p \u2032\u2032, p, z)G\u03ba(p, z)\u03b3 a \u03ba,i(p) ,\n\u0393c\u03bd,j(p \u2032) = \u03b3c\u03bd,j(p \u2032)\n+ \u2211 \u03ba \u222b \u221e 0 p2dp\u03b3c\u03ba,j(p)G\u03ba(p, z)T NP \u03ba\u03bd (p, p \u2032, z) ,\nDij(z) = \u03b4ij(z \u2212mbi )\u2212 \u03a3ij(z) , \u03a3ij(z) = \u2211 \u03ba \u222b \u221e 0 p2dp\u03b3c\u03ba,i(p)G\u03ba(p, z)\u0393 a \u03ba,j(p) ;\n(6)\nwhere the \u03b3\u2019s are bare vertices and mbi is the bare mass of the ith resonance. Eq. (6) actually corresponds to\nthe construction of TP by Schwinger\u2013Dyson-like equations illustrated in Fig. 2. More importantly, TNP can also dynamically generate poles which are not included as genuine states in the s-channel.\nThe potentials V NP are constructed based on the leading order Lagrangians respecting SU(3) flavor symmetry, C and P conservation, as well as derivative couplings of pseudoscalar mesons from chiral symmetry [79\u201381]. Except for the correlated two-pion exchange described in detail in Refs. [42, 43], all the other potentials are considered at tree level, causing divergences of the integral in Eq. (4). Hence we add regulators to make the integrals converge, thereby introducing cut-off parameters to be determined by the fit. Such regulators can also be understood as phenomenological form factors, simulating the inner structures of the hadrons. Additionally the integrals in Eq. (6) need similar regulators, but since the bare couplings are already fit parameters, the s-channel cut-offs are fixed.\nA more detailed description of the potential can be found in the supplemental material [76]. Note that besides the \u03c9N channel, to make the dynamics of the K\u03a3 system complete, in this work we add two more diagrams. These are K\u039b\u2192 K\u03a3 and K\u03a3\u2192 K\u03a3 reactions with the t-channel a0 exchange. They are allowed by SU(3) symmetry and other conservation laws, but were not considered in the previous studies using the Ju\u0308Bo model.\nNote that the nucleon itself is an s-channel pole, and we always adjust its bare mass and couplings such that the physical values are recovered, for details see Ref. [51]. In addition to the s-, t-, and u-channel diagrams, just as in Ref. [53], we also add phenomenological contact terms to simulate the effects from physics not explicitly contained in the s-, t-, and u-channel diagrams.\nThe observables can be evaluated using T\u00b5\u03bd . The normalized, dimensionless partial-wave amplitudes \u03c4 are directly related to the observables:\n\u03c4\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212\u03c0 \u221a \u03c1\u00b5\u03c1\u03bdT\u00b5\u03bd , (7)\nwhere \u03c1 is a kinematical phase factor,\n\u03c1\u03ba = p\u03ba z E\u03ba\u03c9\u03ba , (8)\nand p\u03ba is the corresponding three-momentum. The elements of the unitary scattering S-matrix are also written in terms of \u03c4 :\nS\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd + 2i\u03c4\u00b5\u03bd . (9)\nIII. FITS\nA. Database and numerical details\nFor the newly included \u03c9N channel, we fit to the data from the two reactions \u03c0+n \u2192 \u03c9p and \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03c9n simultaneously, in addition to all other channels of the approach. The database for \u03c9N is summarized in Tab. I. The datasets of the channels lower than \u03c9N remain the same as in Ref. [51], see Refs. [30, 84, 87\u2013128]. Note that for the \u03c0N elastic scattering we fit to the energydependent GWU/SAID solution [30], while the other data points are direct experimental observables. There are approximately 9000 data points in total in our fit. Moreover, the numbers of fit parameters are summarized in Tab. II.\nThe fits are performed on the JURECA supercomputer at Forschungszentrum Ju\u0308lich [129], where one node contains 128 processors. Parallel programming is realized by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) in Fortran. Every processor takes a value of energy z, covering the range from the \u03c0N threshold to 2.3 GeV. At each energy, the scattering equation Eq. (4) can be solved numerically applying the Haftel-Tabakin scheme [130] by discretizing the integral via Gaussian quadrature and inverting the (1 \u2212 V G) matrix algebraically. The \u03c72, measuring the deviation of the theoretical curve to the data points, is minimized by the MINUIT package [131].\nAs the \u03c9N data base is quantitatively and qualitatively very limited, we apply weighting factors in the \u03c72 minimization to force the fit to describe details of the data that would otherwise be ignored. In addition, the\ninclusion of the covariance matrices for the \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c0N input from the GWU/SAID solution [132] is postponed to the future. We also note that some data sets exhibit questionable uncertainties (e.g. the \u03b7N differential cross section from Brown et. al. [118]), c.f. the discussion in Ref. [51], so that we refrain from giving \u03c72 values here.\nFurther discussions on the systematic uncertainties of our fit results stemming from the applied model are required. By definition, for a model a systematic error is difficult to determine. We have, however, tried to obtain a rough estimate of the model-dependence by introducing two different fit scenarios and comparing their results:\n\u2022 Fit A: a solution with dynamically generated poles similar to those in Ref. [51].\n\u2022 Fit B: starts from an intermediate stage of fit A, with an extra narrow (dynamical) pole in the P11 (JP = 12 + ) wave, with a description of the data of\nequal quality.\nAn in-depth uncertainty analysis using, e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [133] or Bayesion evidence to determine the significance of resonance states, is planned for the future.\nB. Description of the data\nAs for the description of the data, fit B is mainly distinguished from fit A by the \u03c0N amplitude of the P11 (JP = 12 + ) partial wave, see Fig. 3. In both results there is a (weak) kink when the energy is around 1700 MeV. This is due to the inclusion of the N\u2217(1710) resonance,\nTotal - 178 -\nTABLE I: The database of \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c9N . \u201cXS\u201d and \u201cDXS\u201d refer to total and differential cross sections, respectively. \u201cFWD(BWD)\u201d refers to the differential cross section for the nucleon forward (backward) direction.\nwhich is absent in Ref. [30]. Furthermore, fit B gives another structure when the energy is around 1500 MeV, which, as an effect from a nearby pole, will be discussed later. Despite such a discrepancy, the global fit qualities are good in both cases.\nIn the following we only focus on the \u03c9N channel, since the observables of the other channels are the same as in Ref. [51], and the new fit results are shown on the website [75]. The expressions of the differential cross section and total cross section are summarized in Appendix A.\nBoth fits A and B give a quite good description of the \u03c9N data. The description of the total cross section is shown in Fig. 4. The difference between the two results becomes visible when z > 1800 MeV, where the amount of data points decreases. As for the differential cross sections, the results for the nucleon backward and forward directions are displayed in Fig. 5. The curves from fits A and B are quite close to each other, especially when the energy is near the \u03c9N threshold. The angular distributions of the differential cross sections are also fitted well, see Fig. 6.\nIn this work we just fit to the original experimental data summarized in Tab. I. In addition, there are 30 more points for energies z = 1800, 1900 and 2000 MeV, which were actually extracted from the histograms of Ref. [82] by Ref. [35]. As a comparison, we also plot the differential cross sections at those energies in Fig. 7 from our model. It shows that our predictions at these energies are not far away from the data.\nAt last, based on those two fit results, the partial wave\namplitudes of \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c9N reaction are plotted in Appendix B.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. N\u2217 and \u2206 spectrum\n1. Pole parameters\nIn this model the resonances are extracted by searching for complex poles of the amplitude \u03c4 on the unphysical (i.e. second) Riemann sheet, as described in detail in Ref. [49]. For one resonance pole1,\nz0 = M \u2212 \u0393\n2 i , (10)\nwhere M is the pole mass and \u0393 the pole width. The leading order Laurent expansion is parametrized as\n\u03c4\u0303\u00b5\u03bd \u223c R\u00b5R\u03bd z0 \u2212 z + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; (11)\nwhere \u03c4\u0303 represents the \u03c4 amplitude of the reaction channels \u03bd \u2192 \u00b5 on the unphysical sheet, and R\u00b5 is the residue belonging to channel \u00b5. In this paper we use the convention of Partial Data Group (PDG) [134] to measure the coupling strength by the so-called normalized residue:\nNR\u00b5 \u2261 2R\u03c0N\n\u0393 \u00d7R\u00b5 .

Nevertheless most of the N\u2217 and \u2206 resonances are usually distorted by complicated coupled-channel dynamics, resulting in strong interferences among one another, one has to take those quantities with a grain of salt.\n2. Pole positions\nFirst, we list the pole positions of both N\u2217 and \u2206 resonances within our reach (Im(z0) \u2264 450 MeV) in Tabs. III and IV, respectively. Their locations are also plotted in Fig. 8. We try to assign the names of most poles according to PDG [134]2. Some of the pole positions show a\n2 It must be noted that some of the results published in the PDG tables, especially when it comes to the star rating of the corresponding states, are debatable.\n8 large model-dependence and deviate much from PDG.\nAs for the N\u2217 states, some well-established states are rather stable in different fits or even different studies (see e.g. Ref. [51]). These are the N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1650) 12 \u2212 , N(1720) 32 + , N(1520) 32 \u2212 , N(1675) 52 \u2212 and N(1680) 52 +\n. It is always hard to determine the high-spin states, but some J \u2265 7/2 states are stable in this study. In this model the lineshape of the P11 \u03c0N amplitude is dominated by the TNP term, with N(1710) 12 +\nbeing the only genuine s-channel state. This feature has already been found earlier, see e.g. Ref. [45]. It is understandable that the 12 + poles in fit A derivate from those in fit B, since the two solutions are distinguished by crucial TNP parameters. In the P13 partial wave, the N(1900)3/2\n+ moved far into the complex plain and is much broader than in Ju\u0308Bo studies including photoproduction reactions [57, 135]. This supports the observation in Refs. [57, 135] and many other studies by different analysis groups that this state is especially important in kaon photoproduction, which is not included in the present work, and hard to determine from purely hadronic reactions. Moreover, the N(1700) 32 \u2212\npole in this work is lower and broader than the estimation in PDG [134]. Last, we emphasize that the N(1895) 12 \u2212\n, from the coupled-channel analyses of photonproduction in Ref. [136], is of 4-star significance in PDG [134], but until now it has never been needed in the Ju\u0308Bo model to obtain a good description of the data.\nAs already mentioned, the different lineshape of fit B in the P11 partial wave, see Fig. 3, stems from an extra narrow resonance at z0 = 1585 \u2212 35i MeV, with strong couplings to all the channels. However, in fit A this pole moves to 1490\u2212 245i MeV. Indications for similar broad resonance are observed in a recent update of Ju\u0308Bo approach including K\u03a3 photoproduction data [135].\nComing to the \u2206 states, even though \u03c9N is a pure isospin one-half channel, also the I = 3/2 parameters are re-fitted as demanded by a coupled-channel framework. Note that some of the TNP parameters do not only change the isospin I = 1/2 partial waves and the amount of the data points for the isospin three-half channels is relatively fewer (only K+\u03a3+ is purely I = 3/2). Moreover, the inclusion of the \u03c9N channel has non-negligible effects on the K+\u03a3\u2212 and K0\u03a30 final states as the corresponding threshold energies are close, leading to a rearrangement of the contributions from isospin one-half and three-half. The states of lower partial waves, e.g. the \u2206(1620) 12 \u2212 and \u2206(1232) 32 + , are more stable. However, the \u2206(1910) 12 +\n, which is of four-star significance in the PDG [134], is very broad in this work, just like Refs. [53, 57]. It seems that the description of the lineshape in the P31 wave does not need such a significant resonance signal, see Fig. 9. The two states \u2206(1920) 32 + and \u2206(1940) 32 \u2212\nin our model are significantly broader than the estimation in PDG [134]. Further, the other states tend to be narrower.\n3. \u03c9N coupling strengths\nIn this section we decompose the normalized residue as NR = |NR|ei\u03b8, with \u03b8 in units of degrees. Roughly speaking, the modulus |NR| measures how significantly the resonance contributes to the amplitude, while the phase \u03b8 controls the interference behavior among different resonances (and the background). The normalized residues of the N\u2217 states for the \u03c9N channel are shown in Tab. V.\nIn the current fit results, \u03c9N couples mainly to lowerlying states, and the moduli of the normalized residues of the N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1710) 12 + and N(1680) 52 + can be larger than 0.5. Especially the value for the N(1535) 12 \u2212 in channel (1) is more than one. The large couplings to the N(1535) 12 \u2212 and the N(1710) 12 +\nmay stem from the extremely large bare couplings. At present, we can not determine how model-dependent this result is, and only know that a limited attempt (the fit C) has failed: if we force those couplings to be small, then the fit would always end up in some unphysical local minima with very narrow dynamically generated resonances, and the description of the data is not satisfactory. Maybe further inclusion of the abundant photoproduction data can resolve this issue.\nNote that most of the previous studies also support the importance of the lower states in the \u03c9N interaction. For instance, using a quark model, Ref. [137] claims that the N(1720) 32 + and N(1680) 52 + have the biggest contributions to \u03c9N photonproduction3, while Ref. [34] gets relatively larger couplings of \u03c9N to N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1650) 12 \u2212 and N(1520) 32 \u2212\n. The coupled-channel analyses of Refs. [36\u201338, 71] indicate the important roles of the N(1710) 12 + , N(1675) 52 \u2212 and N(1680) 52 +\n. Extremely huge bare couplings can hardly be avoided in phenomenological coupled-channel models, e.g. in Ref. [71], the large bare couplings of \u03c9N to N(1675) 52 \u2212 and N(1680) 52 + are quite similar to the couplings to N(1535) 12 \u2212 and N(1710) 12 +\nhere. Note that we do not associate any physical meaning to the bare couplings.\nWe also list the nominal branching ratios, defined by Eq. (14), of the states above the threshold to the \u03c9N channel, see Tab. VI. Though all those resonances do not couple strongly to \u03c9N , the most significant state is N(2250) 92 \u2212\n, the branching ratio of which is bigger than 10%. Ref. [37] shows that when photoproduction is included, the N(1900) 32 +\nwould play an important role among the higher resonances, which is different from the hadronic case here. Ref. [38] has found the branching\n3 Unfortunately it is hard to directly compare our result to Ref. [137]. First, the models are completely different, as we regard hadrons as the basic degrees of freedom, and second our coupling strengths are actually labelled by normalized residues.\nratio of N(1875) 32 \u22124 to \u03c9N is large, however, this state is not originally included in our model and the position of the dynamically generated one is not stable.\n4 It is called D13(1950) in Ref. [38].\n4. Coupling strengths to the lower channels\nFor completeness, we also show the normalized residues of each resonance for the channels with stable particles lower than \u03c9N . First, the results for the N\u2217 states are given in Tab. VII. The pole positions of the N(1440) 12 + and the N(1710) 12 +\nin fits A and B are not so close to each other, so are their residues. Except for the N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1650) 12 \u2212 and N(1710) 12 + , all the other\n10\nstates do not couple strongly to the KY channels.\nThe residues of the \u2206 states are summarized in Tab. VIII. Apart from those states that only show up in fit A or B, the residues of the \u2206(1910) 12 + and \u2206(1600) 32 +\nare less stable. As already discussed, the former tends to be irrelevant to the lineshape in this model, and the latter is affected much by certain TNP parameters.\nThe branching ratios to the lower physical channels are also given for the N\u2217 states in Tab. IX and for the \u2206 states in Tab. X. We should emphasize again that the\nbranching ratios here actually come from the residues, and in principle cannot be directly related to the imaginary part of the pole (the total width). It can happen that these branching ratios do not sum up to 100%, since most of the N\u2217 and \u2206 resonances are not typical BreitWigner states.\nLast, currently for the lack of constraints from \u03c0\u03c0N and \u03c1N data in this model, the residues for the effective three-body channels are less instructive. Thus, they are displayed in Appendix C.\nsub-channels are: (1)|J \u2212 L| = 12 , S = 1 2 ; (2)|J \u2212 L| = 1 2 , S = 3 2 ; (3)|J \u2212 L| = 3 2 , S = 3 2 .\nB. Scattering lengths\nThe scattering lengths are defined as:\na\u03ba \u2261 lim p\u03ba\u21920 p\u22121\u03ba tan \u03b4\u0303 (L=0) \u03ba , (16)\nwhere \u03ba is the channel label and \u03b4\u0303 (L=0) \u03ba is the generalized S-wave phase shift from the diagonal element of the Smatrix,\nS\u03ba\u03ba \u2261 e2i\u03b4\u0303\u03ba . (17)\nNote that when the energy is below the \u03c0\u03c0N threshold and \u03ba corresponds to \u03c0N , Eq. (17) is the common defi-\nnition of the phase shift, namely both \u03b4\u0303 and a are real. Specifically the scattering length is extracted from the \u03c4 amplitude of Eq. (7),\na\u03ba = lim p\u03ba\u21920\np\u22121\u03ba \u03c4 (L=0) \u03ba\u03ba . (18)\nAs already mentioned, the \u03c9N scattering length is very important since it indicates whether the \u03c9 meson can form bound states in the nuclear medium. There are two \u03c9N scattering lengths with total spin S = 1/2, 3/2. Here we consider the spin-averaged scattering length, which is commonly used in the literature (see e.g. Ref. [68]):\na\u0304\u03c9N = 1\n3 a\u03c9N\n( S = 1\n2\n) + 2\n3 a\u03c9N\n( S = 3\n2\n) . (19)\nThe results for fits A and B are shown in Tab. XI. Though the real parts of the S = 1/2 scattering length are somewhat different, the two results for a\u0304 agree with each other\nqualitatively: both of them have a negative real part, indicating that our model, irrespective of the uncertainties, does not support bound states of the \u03c9 in nuclear matter. The imaginary parts are relatively smaller, showing weak inelastic effects near the \u03c9N threshold. The values of a\u0304\u03c9N here and in the previous studies are plotted in Fig. 10. Our negative real part agrees with all those except for the two studies based on QCD sum rules. Note that in addition to Fig. 10, there are some results on the absolute value of the scattering length, e.g. |a\u0304\u03c9N | = 0.82 \u00b1 0.03 fm in Ref. [72], and also |a\u0304\u03c9N | = 0.81 \u00b1 0.41 fm from a calculation mentioned therein based on Ref. [138].\nResults for the scattering lengths of the lower channels are shown in Tab. XII. The value of \u03c0N scattering length is quite similar to Ref. [51] and compatible with the result of the Roy-Steiner analyses in Ref. [139], since the inclusion of a high-lying \u03c9N channel should not affect the physics of \u03c0N threshold significantly. However, the scattering lengths of K\u039b and K\u03a3 (I = 1/2) have changed\nconsiderably compared with the results in Ref. [51]. This discrepancy possibly stems from the lack of precision of the corresponding near-threshold data points. The errorbars of the near-threshold differential cross sections in the \u03c0N \u2192 K\u039b,K\u03a3 reactions are rather large.\nV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\nIn this paper we have performed a refined investigation on pion-induced meson-baryon scattering reactions, using a sophisticated coupled-channel approach (the Ju\u0308lich-\nBonn model). The model includes t- and u-channel exchange diagrams and s-channel genuine states in addition to phenomenological contact terms, taking into account the \u03c0N , \u03c0\u03c0N (effectively parameterized by \u03c0\u2206, \u03c3N and \u03c1N), \u03b7N , K\u039b and K\u03a3 channels with \u03c9N newly included. This model covers the energy region from the \u03c0N threshold up to 2.3 GeV, and fits are done based on all available data. The model-dependence is estimated by comparing two different fit scenarios. After the calculation of the amplitudes and extraction of the resonance poles, the N\u2217 and \u2206 resonance spectra are reanalysed, and the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\u2022 While the well established N\u2217 states like N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1650) 12 \u2212 , etc., always remain\nnearly unchanged, some resonances in higher partial waves are found to be stable. The main discrepancy of the two fit scenarios is the dynamical structure of the P11 wave.\n\u2022 As for the \u2206 states, even if \u03c9N does not couple to them, the results are also refined by the new global\nfits. Specifically, the \u2206(1910) 12 +\nin our model is rather broad.\n\u2022 The \u03c9N channel mainly couples to three low-lying states in this model, N(1535) 12 \u2212 , N(1710) 12 + and\nN(1680) 52 +\n. The higher resonances do not show markable couplings to the \u03c9N channel, with the N(2250) 92 \u2212 being the most important one.\n\u2022 The spin-averaged scattering length of \u03c9N is calculated, resulting in a negative real part. In fit A it is\n(\u22120.24 + 0.05i) fm and in fit B (\u22120.21 + 0.05i) fm. This, in agreement with most other studies, does not support bound states of the \u03c9 meson in nuclear matter.\nThere are two main directions for future studies. On the one hand, building on the framework of Refs. [56, 135], we plan to extend the current work to \u03c9 photoproduction, profiting from the large amount of high-qualtity data that will be of high importance to further refine the \u03c9N resonance parameters. On the other hand, the output of this work can be directly used as the input for e.g. studying the in-medium behavior of the \u03c9 meson, or investigating the possible hadronic molecules [140] among the N\u2217 and \u2206 resonances. Last, this model can also be employed to the check the possible structures below the \u03c0N threshold [141\u2013147].\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Zhi-Hui Guo, Johann Haidenbauer and Fei Huang for helpful instructions on consistency checks of the theoretical framework, and Michael Do\u0308ring for useful discussions.
