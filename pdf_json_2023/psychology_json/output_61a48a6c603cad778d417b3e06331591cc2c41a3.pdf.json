Although alkali cations in acidic electrolytes play a vital role in suppressing hydrogen evolution and promoting CO2 reduction, they also cause precipitation of bicarbonate on the gas diffusion electrode (GDE), flooding of electrolyte through the GDE, and drift of the electrolyte pH. In this work, we realize the electroreduction of CO2 in a metal cation-free acidic electrolyte by covering the catalyst with cross-linked polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride. This polyelectrolyte provides a high density of cationic sites immobilized on the surface of the catalyst, which suppresses themass transport of H andmodulates the interfacial field strength. By adopting this strategy, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reaches 95 \u00b1 3% with the Ag catalyst and the FE of formic acid reaches 76 \u00b1 3%with the In catalyst in a 1.0 pH electrolyte in a flow cell. More importantly, with the metal cation-free acidic electrolyte the amount of electrolyte flooding through the GDE is decreased to 2.5 \u00b10.6% of that with alkali cation-containing acidic electrolyte, and the FE of COmaintains above 80% over 36 h of operation at \u2212200mA\u00b7cm.",

Although alkali cations in acidic electrolytes play a vital role in suppressing hydrogen evolution and promoting CO2 reduction, they also cause precipitation of bicarbonate on the gas diffusion electrode (GDE), flooding of electrolyte through the GDE, and drift of the electrolyte pH. In this work, we realize the electroreduction of CO2 in a metal cation-free acidic electrolyte by covering the catalyst with cross-linked polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride. This polyelectrolyte provides a high density of cationic sites immobilized on the surface of the catalyst, which suppresses themass transport of H+ andmodulates the interfacial field strength. By adopting this strategy, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reaches 95 \u00b1 3% with the Ag catalyst and the FE of formic acid reaches 76 \u00b1 3%with the In catalyst in a 1.0 pH electrolyte in a flow cell. More importantly, with the metal cation-free acidic electrolyte the amount of electrolyte flooding through the GDE is decreased to 2.5 \u00b10.6% of that with alkali cation-containing acidic electrolyte, and the FE of COmaintains above 80% over 36 h of operation at \u2212200mA\u00b7cm\u22122.\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 at ambient temperature is a promising technique to store renewable electricity, fix CO2 and produce valuable fuels and chemicals1,2. One of the greatest challenges to make this technique industrially feasible is to prevent the formation of (bi) carbonate at the cathode3,4. Alkaline solution is not a practical electrolyte for CO2 reduction due to the reaction between OH - and CO2 5,6. When carrying out CO2 reduction in near neutral electrolyte such as KHCO3 solution, partial CO2 is consumed byOH\n- ions generated on the cathode to form HCO3 - or CO3 2- instead of being reduced. The asformed HCO3 - or CO3\n2- ions migrate to the anode and are acidified by H+ generated on the anode, which gives rise to CO2 crossover from cathode to anode3,7,8. This process results in low utilization efficiency of CO2. Moreover, the high resistance of the near neutral electrolyte leads to low energy efficiency at high current density9.\nRecently, techniques of CO2 reduction with acidic electrolyte were developed to circumvent the as-mentioned issues9\u201321. Alkali cations play an important role to suppress hydrogen evolution\nreaction (HER) and promote CO2 reduction in acidic condition. However, alkali cations induce bicarbonate precipitation on the cathode during CO2 reduction in acidic electrolyte, which is still an issue that hinders the sustainability of CO2 reduction\n22,23. Fig. 1a illustrates the formation process of bicarbonate precipitate on the cathode. In spite of the low pH of bulk electrolyte, CO2 is able to convert to HCO3\n- in the vicinity of the cathode with high local pH12,13,24. The as-formed HCO3\n- is then combined with the high concentration of alkali cations accumulated at the local environment of the cathode, causing the precipitation of alkali metal bicarbonate. The bicarbonate precipitate can destroy the hydrophobicity of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and thus induce flooding, which can block the channel for the mass transport of CO2\n5,23,25\u201327. The inset of Fig. 1a shows the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the cross-section of Ag/GDE after CO2 reduction with H2SO4-K2SO4 electrolyte, which explicitly shows the permeating of K+-containing electrolyte through the GDE. Besides, when alkali cation-containing\nReceived: 3 March 2023\nAccepted: 31 August 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Chemistry, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. e-mail: guj6@sustech.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5640 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nacidic electrolyte is used in a two-chamber cell with proton exchange membrane (PEM), the pH values of catholyte and anolyte change in the long-term electrolysis. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the mole H+ consumed on the cathode equals that generated on the anode. However, both H+ and alkali cations can traverse most PEMs, while the alkali cations cannot be consumed on the cathode. As a result, alkali cations accumulate in the catholyte and H+ ions accumulate in the anolyte, leading to the increase of pH of the catholyte and the decrease of pH of the anolyte. Therefore, a possible strategy to maintain the hydrophobicity of the GDE and the composition of the electrolyte during CO2 reduction is to use metal cation-free acidic electrolyte.\nDifferent mechanisms of cation effect in acidic electrolyte have been proposed. Hydrated cations at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) show distinct acidity compared with those in bulk solution, which is considered to tune the reactivity of HER and CO2 reduction near the cathode28,29. More importantly, cations accumulate near the OHP modulate the distribution of electric field in the electric double layer. On one hand, cations screen the electric field generated from the cathode and thus retard the migration of H+9,22. On the other hand, cations enhance the electric field in Stern layer, which stabilizes the adsorbed polar intermediates of CO2 reduction such as *CO2 (Fig. 1c) and *OCCO30\u201332. Owing to these effects, H+ reduction is suppressed and CO2 reduction is promoted. Moreover, it was reported that partially dehydrated alkali cations at theOHP can further stabilize the adsorbed polar intermediates via a short-range electrostatic interaction29,33. This effect was considered indispensable for enabling CO2 adsorption and C-C coupling for the formation of C2+ products\n29,33. All the asmentioned effects arise from cations accumulating near the cathode rather than those in the bulk electrolyte. Therefore, a layer of cations immobilized on the surface of the cathode may also enable CO2 reduction in acidic condition without metal cations dissolved in the bulk electrolyte (Fig. 1d). Cationic polyelectrolytes are promising candidates for this task.\nIn thiswork, cross-linkedpoly-diallyldimethylammoniumchloride (denoted as c-PDDA) was used as an immobilized cationic layer to cover the catalysts for CO2 reduction. Aqueous solution of H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte. CO and formic acid were selectively generated with silver (Ag) and indium (In) nanoparticles (NPs) as the catalysts, respectively. The performance was stable over 36 hours and the pH values of both catholyte and anolyte kept constant. In sharp contrast, when K+-containing acidic electrolyte was used, the pH value of catholyte increased by 5.3 unit after electrolysis for 10 hours. Moreover, with metal cation-free acidic electrolyte, the amount of electrolyte flooding through the GDE was 1% of that with K+-containing acidic electrolyte, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the GDE was highly retained with metal cation-free electrolyte. This work provides the strategy to improve the sustainability of CO2 electroreduction in acidic condition."

Inspired by thismechanism, we designed to immobilize a layer of cationic polyelectrolyte on the cathode to enable CO2 reduction in metal cation-free acidic electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2a, Ag NPs (99.99%, <100nm, Macklin) showed negligible Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO in a flow cell with 0.1M H2SO4 as the electrolyte (black line). When Sustainion XA-9, a commercial cationic polyelectrolyte34, was addedwith the catalyst, around 1%FEofCOwasdetected (orange line). The low FE of CO can be ascribed to the fact that the cation density of Sustainion XA-9 (2.06mmol g-1)34 is not high enough to substantially affect the electric field distribution. Poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) possesses the cation density of 6.19mmol\u00b7g-1, 3 times that of Sustainion XA-9, which is the highest cation density we can find in a wide variety of polyelectrolytes.

The FE of CO wasmeasured to be slightly higher than 2% at 15minof electrolysis and dropped to below 1% after 30min (blue line). The low performance of PDDA decorated Ag NPs can be attributed to the high solubility of PDDA in water. During the electrolysis, PDDA was washed away from the catalyst by the flowing catholyte and could not form a stable layer to cover the catalyst. Figure S1a, b compares the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of PDDA decorated Ag catalyst before and after electrolysis. The peakof N 1 sdecreased substantially after electrolysis, indicating the loss of the layer of PDDA. 1H-NMR spectrum of the electrolyte after electrolysis (Figure S2) indicates that about 90% of PDDA was washed into the electrolyte.\nTo prevent the layer of PDDAon the surfaceof catalyst frombeing washed away, we designed a cross-linked polyelectrolyte that can adhere firmly onto the catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. Figure S3 schematically shows the procedure of the preparation of c-PDDA decorated catalysts. First, we prepared the copolymer of diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMACl) and diallylmethylamine (DAMA). Figure S4 shows the characterizations of the copolymer. The N 1 s XPS spectrum (Figure S4b) shows two peaks at 399.0 eV and 402.0 eV with the area ratio of 1:3.8, corresponding to the tertiary amine sites35 and quaternary ammonium sites36,37, respectively. 1,6- diiodohexane was chosen as the cross-linking agent to link the tertiary amine sites in two copolymer chains. To prepare the working electrode, the catalyst, the copolymer, 1,6-diiodohexane, ethylene glycol and ethanolweremixed as the ink anddroppedonto theGDE. TheGDE was then heated to facilitate the cross-linking reaction and evaporate the solvent. Figure S5 shows the high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and EDS mapping images of Ag NPs coated with c-PDDA, in which N element distributes uniformly over Ag NPs. The N 1 sXPS of this sample (Figure S1d) shows a single peak at 402.0 eV, indicating all the tertiary amine sites in the copolymer were converted to quaternary ammonium sites. The cation\ndensity of c-PDDA was measured to be 5.80mmol g-1 and the charge density of c-PDDA immersed in water (denoted as \u03c1p) wasmeasured to be +296C cm-3 (corresponding to 3.07M of cationic sites). The procedureof themeasurement is shown in theMethods section. As shown by themagenta line in Fig. 2a, c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs presented the FE of CO up to 90% and kept above 80% during electrolysis for 36 h at \u2212200mA\u00b7cm-2 in 0.1M H2SO4. Figure S6 shows the electrode potential during the chronopotentiometry experiment. As presented in Figure S1c, d, the peak intensity of N 1 s in the XPS spectra did not change obviously after electrolysis, confirming the c-PDDA layer was retained on the surface of Ag NPs. Figure S7 and S8 shows the infrared (IR) spectra and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the working electrode before and after electrolysis, respectively. No substantial change in the spectra was observed, indicating both the polymer layer and the interface between Ag NPs and the polymer were stable during electrolysis. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis of the electrolyte after electrolysis showed that the concentrations of Na+ and K+ were 6.0\u00d710-6M and 5.5\u00d710-6M, respectively. To rule out the possibility that it was this trace amount of alkali cations rather than c-PDDA enabled CO2 reduction in acidic electrolyte, 0.1M of 18-crown-6 was added into 0.1M H2SO4 to chelate alkali cations. The FEs of CO at \u2212100mA\u00b7cm-2 in 0.1M H2SO4 with and without 0.1M of 18-crown-6 were 93% and 95%, respectively. The additionof 18-crown-6 did notobviously affect the FE of CO, indicating that the trace amount of alkali cations is not the origin of CO2 reduction activity.\nWhen K+-containing acidic solution (0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4) was used as the electrolyte, the FE of CO on bare Ag NPs also reached 90% initially. However, it dropped to below 80% after 2 hours and decreased to 43% after 10 hours (gray line in Fig. 2a). The poor stability of the electrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the existence of K+ in the acidic electrolyte.

Under this circumstance, H+ is theonly kindof ion that canmigrate through the PEM. When0.1MH2SO4 + 0.4MK2SO4was used as the electrolyte, the pHof catholyte increased and the pH of anolyte decreased over time. Specifically, the pH values of the catholyte and the anolyte changed from 1.6 to 6.9 and 0.8 after 10 h, respectively (black and gray lines in Fig. 2c). Since the migrations of both H+ and K+ contribute to the current across the PEM (Nafion 211), the migration rate of H+ through the PEM was lower than the generation rate of H+ at the anode or the consuming rate of H+ at the cathode (Fig. 1b). Consequently, the concentrationofH+ decreased and the concentrationofK+ increased in the catholyte. The pH of catholyte was convergent to about 7 because of the buffering effect of CO2. The existence of K\n+ in the electrolyte also led to the formation of KHCO3 precipitate on the GDE, as indicated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations (Figure S9). The increase of the pH and the concentration of K+ in the catholyte facilitated the precipitation of KHCO3. As shown in Figure S10, the contact angle of water on the side of gas diffusion layer of the working electrode after electrolysis in 0.1M H2SO4 + 0.4M K2SO4 was considerably smaller than that after electrolysis in 0.1M H2SO4, indicating that the formation of KHCO3 precipitate reduced the hydrophobicity of the GDE. The break-down of the hydrophobicity led to the electrolyte flooding and blocked the mass transport of CO2. To quantify the electrolyte flooding, we measured the mass of electrolyte permeated through the GDE during 10 h of electrolysis. When 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 was used as the electrolyte and bareAgNPswere used as the catalyst, 43 \u00b1 17mg of the electrolyte permeated through 1 cm2 of GDE. When 0.1M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte and c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs were used as the catalyst, only 1.1 \u00b1 0.4mg of the electrolyte permeated through 1 cm2 of GDE (Fig. 2d). The procedure of the measurement is shown in the Method section. It is noteworthy that the increase of the pH of the catholyte did not directly cause the decrease of the FE of CO on bareAgNPs. As shown in Figure S11, the initial FEs ofCOonbareAgNPs in electrolytes with varied pH are all around 90%. The decrease of the FE of CO in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 in Fig. 2a was a direct consequence of the formation of KHCO3 precipitate.\nFigure S12 further compares the FE of CO on bare Ag NPs in 0.1M H2SO4 + x M K2SO4 (x = 0.04 ~ 0.4). As shown by our previous study22, by decreasing the concentration ofK+, the stabilitywas improvedwhile the initial FE of CO decreased. 0.1M H2SO4 + 0.1M K2SO4 was an optimized composition of electrolyte that balance the FE of CO and stability22. In this electrolyte, the FE of CO was around 80% initially, lower than that in 0.1M H2SO4 + 0.4M K2SO4, while the decrease of FE of CO was slower. After 3 hours, the FE of CO became higher than that in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 but significantly lower than that of c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs in 0.1M H2SO4. The CO2 reduction performance of c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 was also measured, as shown in Figure S12. The FE of CO was higher than bare Ag NPs in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 in 10 hours, suggesting that the formation rate of KHCO3 precipitate decreased. However, the\nperformance of c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.4M K2SO4 was less stable than in 0.1M H2SO4, and KHCO3 precipitate was still detectable after CO2 reduction for 12 h (Figure S13), indicating that the c-PDDA layer can slow down but not prevent the formation of KHCO3 precipitate.\nFigure 3 shows the FEs of different products from CO2 reduction in 0.1M H2SO4 with c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs and In NPs as the catalysts. Figure S14 shows theTEM images and theXRDpatternof InNPs. CO and formic acid were selectively produced on Ag NPs and In NPs, respectively. For Ag NPs, the highest FE of CO was 95 \u00b1 3%, achieved at \u22121.57 \u00b1 0.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at the current density of \u2212100mA\u00b7cm-2. At the current density of 300 \u2212mA\u00b7cm-2, the FE of CO was 82 \u00b1 4%, corresponding to a partial current density of CO of \u2212246 \u00b1 12mA\u00b7cm-2. When 1M H2SO4 was used as the electrolyte, the highest FE of CO was 66%, achieved at the current density of \u2212300mA\u00b7cm-2, corresponding to a partial current density of CO of \u2212198mA\u00b7cm-2 (Figure S15). For In NPs, the highest FE of formic acid reached 76 \u00b1 3%, at \u22121.84 \u00b1 0.08 V vs SHE with the current density of \u2212200mA\u00b7cm-2. At the current density of\u2212300mA\u00b7cm-2, the FEof formic acid was 75 \u00b1 4%, corresponding to a partial current density of formic acid of \u2212225 \u00b1 13mA\u00b7cm-2. In the electrolyte after CO2 reduction experiments, Ag and In elements were not detectable by ICP-MS, indicating less than 0.2% of Ag or In was dissolved during electrolysis. Although the standard reduction potential (\u03c6\u00b0(In3+/In) = \u22120.34 V vs SHE)38 indicates metallic In can be oxidized by H+ in a chemical reaction, In catalyst was stable in 0.1MH2SO4 at the electrode potential for CO2 reduction (<\u22121.3 V vs SHE). As shown in Figure S16, the selectivity of CO2 reduction conducted on c-PDDA decorated catalysts in 0.1M H2SO4 is higher than that on bare catalysts in 0.1M H2SO4 +0.1M H2SO4 or 0.1M H2SO4 + 0.04M H2SO4 at varied current density. When undecorated Ag NPs and In NPs were used as the catalysts in 0.1M H2SO4, H2 was only reduction product (Figure S17). Figure S18 further compares the overall cell potential and each component of the potential loss at different current densities with 0.1M H2SO4, 0.1M KHCO3 and 0.1M KOH as the electrolyte. The potential loss is composed of ohmic loss, overpotentials of cathodic reaction and anodic reaction. The cell potential with 0.1M H2SO4 is the lowest due to the lowest resistance of the electrolyte. The apparent overpotential of CO2 reduction in 0.1M KOH is the lowest9,25, but KOH solution is not sustainable during electrolysis and is not a practical choice as the electrolyte for CO2 reduction techniques. The cell potential with 0.1M KHCO3 is the largest due to the highest resistance of the electrolyte.\nIt was reported that immobilized quaternary ammonium cations on ionomer can enable CO2 reduction on membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with pure water as the anolyte39,40, implying that the quaternary ammonium cations have the ability to interact with *CO2 species and promote CO2 reduction in alkali cation-free condition. The interaction between quaternary ammonium cation and the adsorbed species weakens as the substituent groups on the N atom become bulkier41. The N atoms in PDDA bears two methyl groups, the smallest substituent group. Therefore, PDDA should show stronger interaction\nprovided as a Source Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5640 4\nwith *CO2 species than quaternary ammonium cations with other substituent groups. In the alkali cation-containing electrolyte, the partially dehydrated alkali cation at OHP can bind to *CO2 species, which is essential for triggering CO2 reduction\n29,33. Since the quaternary ammonium cation cannot directly bind to *CO2, the shortrange interaction between *CO2 and the quaternary ammonium cation should be weaker than that between *CO2 and alkali cations. In addition, both alkali cations and quaternary ammonium cations can increase the electric field strength in Stern layer, which also stabilizes the polar *CO2 intermediate, as discussed in the following section. Taking all the effects into account, K+ should show more profound promotion effect on the kinetics of CO2 reduction than c-PDDA, in accordance with our observation that the applied potential to reach the same partial current density of CO on bare Ag NPs in K+-containing electrolyte (with K+ concentration of 0.08 ~ 0.8M) was more positive than on c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs in K+-free electrolyte (Figure S19).\nMechanism study on the effects of polymer layers Our previous works indicate that alkali cations enable CO2 reduction in acidic electrolyte through retarding themigration ofH+ and enhancing the electric field in Stern layer9,22. In this work, we used a layer of c-PDDA immobilized on the catalyst to take over the role of alkali cations in electrolyte. The effect of the cationic polyelectrolyte adlayers on CO2 reduction in alkali cation-containing neutral electrolyte has been studied. In neutral electrolyte, the polyelectrolyte can modulate the concentration distribution of HCO3 -, CO3 2- and OHthrough Donnan exclusion and thus tune the local pH41,42. It was also reported that the polyelectrolyte layer can affect the local water content andCO2 concentration\n24,42. In acidic electrolyte, the concentration distribution of H+ can also be tuned by the polyelectrolyte through Donnan exclusion. More importantly, the polyelectrolyte layer may affect the rate of H+mass transport and hence determine the rate of H2 evolution from H+ reduction. The polyelectrolyte may also modulate the electric field in Stern layer and determines the rate of the electron transfer from cathode to CO2. To understand these effects, we conducted experiments with Ag micro-disk electrode (MDE) covered by different polymers and simulated the experiments with generalized modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (GMPNP) modeling43,44.\nThe black curve in Fig. 4a shows the HER polarization curve of Ag MDE in 10mM trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf). HOTf instead of H2SO4was used as the electrolyte for theMDE experiments sinceHOTf dissociates completely in water, which helps to simplify the GMPNP modeling. The onset potential for HER is \u22120.6 V vs SHE, and a current plateau is observed at \u22121.2 V vs SHE. As the potential sweeps to more negative than \u22121.8 V vs SHE, the current increases again. Through the comparison with the HER polarization curve measured in 10mM potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (KOTf, gray dashed curve), we\ncan conclude that in 10mM HOTf, the increase of current from \u20121.8 V vs SHE is originated from the reduction of water molecule, and H+ reduction is the predominant contribution to the current between \u20120.6 V and \u20121.8 V vs SHE. The plateau region of the curve from \u20121.2 V to \u22121.8 V vs SHE is due to the limitation of the mass transport of H+. As indicated by Fig. 3a, CO2 reduction on Ag NPs was mainly observed at the potential of this plateau region. Therefore, H+ reduction was the major competing reaction for CO2 reduction, and suppressing H + reductionby retarding themass transportofH+ is apossible strategy to increase the FE of CO2 reduction.\nFurthermore, Fig. 4a compares the HER polarization curves of Ag MDEs covered by c-PDDA, Sustainion XA-9, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Nafion D520, respectively, in 10mMHOTf, and that of bare AgMDE in 10mMHOTf+ 10mMKOTf. Figure 4b compares theplateau current of H+ reduction under different conditions. When the Ag MDE was covered by PTFE, a neutral polymer, the plateau was lower than that of bare Ag MDE, which can be ascribed to the lower diffusion coefficient of H+ in the polymer layer than in aqueous solution. AgMDE covered by Nafion D520, a polymer bearing anionic sites45, showed higher plateau current than bare Ag MDE. Ag MDE covered by c-PDDA or Sustainion XA-9, polymers bearing cation sites, showed substantially lower plateau current than the Ag MDE covered by PTFE. Ag MDE covered by c-PDDA showed the lowest plateau current. These results indicate that the polymer layer bearing immobilized positive charge can suppress the mass transport of H+, and the higher the positive charge density is, the lower the mass transport rate of H+ is. It is noteworthy that the plateau current of bare Ag MDE in 10mM HOTf + 10mM KOTf is higher than that of cationic polymer decorated Ag MDE in 10mM HOTf. Our previous study shows alkali cations can substantially suppress the migration rate of H+ but the diffusion of H+ cannot be significantly inhibited22. In metal cation-free solution, the migration rate of H+ equals the diffusion rate of H+ (see Supplementary Note 1 for the explanation). Therefore, once the migration of H+ is suppressed by the cationic polymer layer, the diffusion of H+ is suppressed simultaneously. As a consequence, the cationic polymer layer suppresses the mass transport of H+ more substantially than dissolved alkali cations.\nGMPNP simulation was then conducted to understand how the cationic polymer layer suppresses the mass transport of H+. Figure 5a shows the model used for the simulation. Stern layer, the space between cathode and OHP, contains no charged species. A polymer layer is located outside the OHP with a charge density of the immobilized ionic sites of \u03c1p. According to the loading of c-PDDAonAgMDE in the experiments, the thickness of the polymer layer was set to 1 \u03bcm in the simulation. The polymer layer also containsmovableH+, OH- and OTf- ions. Outside the polymer layer, H+, OH- and OTf- ions are the only charged species. The charge carried by the polymer layer modifies the\n-1.8 -1.6 -1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0.0 Bare\nBare\ncPDDA Sustainion PTFE Nafion\nC ur\nre nt\n(\u03bc A)\nPotential (V vs SHE)\n-1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -80 -60 -40 -20\n0\nC ur\nre nt\n(n A)\nPotential (V vs SHE)\nHOTf\nKOTf\nBare HOTf + KOTf\nPl at\nea u\ncu rre\nnt (\u03bc\nA)\nBa re\nc-P DD\nA Su sta ini on\nPT FE\nNa fio\nn Ba re\na b\n0.01\n0.1\n1 HOTf HOTf + KOTf\nFig. 4 | Effect of polymer layer on the HER performance of Ag MDE. a HER polarization curves of AgMDEs in 10mMHOTf (solid curves): Bare AgMDE (black), Ag MDEs covered by c-PDDA (orange), Sustainion XA-9 (blue), PTFE (dark yellow) and Nafion D520 (magenta).

Figure S20 shows the governing equations and boundary conditions used for the GMPNP simulation. Figure S21 shows the simulatedpolarization curves of H+ reductionwith different \u03c1p. The simulation reproduced the trend of the plateau current of H+ reduction in Fig. 4: Themore positive \u03c1p is, the lower plateau current is. Figure 5b shows the migration rate of H+ outside the polymer layer at \u22121.8 V vs SHE. At this potential, H+ reduction is limited by the mass transport of H+. The migration rate of H+ decreases when \u03c1p increases, suggesting that cationic polymer layer can screen the electric field and suppress the migration of H+ while anionic polymer layer has the opposite effect. In addition, Fig. 5b shows that adding K+ ions into the acidic electrolyte can also suppress the migration of H+ on bare Ag electrode. In other word, both immobilized cations in the polymer layer and dissolved cations accumulated near the cathode can reduce the migration rate of H+, as illustrated in Fig. 1c, d. Moreover, Fig. 5c shows the simulated potential profiles with different \u03c1p. When the polymer bears positive charge, the potential of the polymer layer is higher than the potential of bulk electrolyte, which is known as Donnan potential difference46,47. This layer with positive potential relative to bulk electrolyte acts as a barrier for the H+ mass transport from bulk electrolyte to the surface of cathode. The barrier becomes higher as \u03c1p of the polymer layer increases. Figure S22 shows the profiles of electric field strength with different \u03c1p. Strong electric field exists at the interface between charged polymer layer and solution due to thepotential step at the interface. For Ag electrode covered\nby cationic polymer layer, the electric field is uniform within the polymer layer and solution. It is noteworthy that the electric field strength outside the polymer layer decreases as \u03c1p increases, in accordance with the migration rate of H+ shown in Fig. 5b.\nThe charge of the polymer layer also affects the local pH near the cathode. Figure S23 shows the pH profiles with different \u03c1p at \u22121.8 V vs SHE in 0.1M HOTf. When the polymer layer is not charged, the pH at 10 nm to 1 \u03bcm from the OHP is higher than the bulk pH due to the concentration polarization. However, within 10 nm from the OHP, the pH is lower than the bulk pH since H+ ions are attracted electrostatically by the cathode. Figure 5d shows the pH at OHP at varied electrode potential. When \u03c1p is negative or zero (magenta and black curves), the negative shift of the electrode potential does not drive the increase of pH at OHP. When the polymer layer bears positive charge, thepHvalue in thepolymer layer increases drastically (FigureS23), and the local pH at OHP increases as the electrode potential shifts negatively beyond -0.9V vs SHE (blue and orange curve in Fig. 5d).When \u03c1p equals to +300C\u00b7cm-3, the pH at OHP is higher than the bulk pH at the potential of the plateau region (<\u22121.2 V vs SHE). When K+ ions are contained in the acidic electrolyte and bare Ag electrode is used, pH at OHP increases as the electrode potential shifts negatively beyond \u22121.0 V vs SHE (gray dashed curve in Fig. 5d), in accordance with our previous reports9,22. Therefore, H+ reduction can drive local pH increase at OHP only when the cathode is covered by an immobilized cationic layer or the electrolyte contains inert cations. When CO2 reduction is involved, OH- anions generated from CO2 reduction can neutralize H+ and lead to further increase of local pH12. Therefore, the local pH under CO2 reduction condition should be higher than the value shown in Fig. 5d.\nBesides retarding the migration of H+, the polymer layer also affects the electric field strength in Stern layer (denoted as EStern). The single-electron reduction of CO2 (CO2 + e - \u2192 CO2 \u00b7-) is regarded as the rate determining step (RDS) of CO2 reduction to form CO in some\na b\nc d\n\u03c1 = 0 \u03c1 = +100 \u03c1 = +300\nWith K\npH a\nt O H\nP\n\u03c1 = -100p p\np\np + no polymer\n-1.8 -1.6 -1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nElectrode potential (V vs SHE)\n-100 0 +100 +300 With K\n(\u03bc m\nol \u00b7c\nm \u00b7\ns )\n\u03c1 (C\u00b7cm )p -3\n-2 -1\nno polymer\n0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\nin 10mM HOTf.

As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the potential difference between the cathode and OHP is the driving force of the electron transfer from the cathode to CO2 molecules at OHP. It was also reported recently that chemisorption of CO2 on the catalytic site is the RDS\n50,51. The *CO2 species possesses the dipole moment towards the solution side and thus can be stabilized by the electric field in Stern layer. Therefore, no matter the reduction of CO2 follows which mechanism, it can be accelerated by the increase of EStern30\u201332,50.\nThe value EStern was extracted from the result of GMPNP simulations. As shown in Fig. 6a, the black and the orange curves are the potential profiles on Ag electrode covered by polymer layerswith \u03c1p of 0 and +300C cm-3 at \u22121.8 V vs SHE, respectively. When \u03c1p equals to +300C cm-3, EStern (the slope of the curve in Stern layer) is higher, suggesting that the cationic polymer layer can promote CO2 reduction on Ag electrode. Figure 5b compares the values of EStern on Ag electrode covered by polymer layer with different \u03c1p at varied electrode potential. For Ag electrodes covered by neutral or anionic polymer layer (\u03c1p \u22640, black and magenta curves), EStern first increases and then keeps constant as the electrode potential shifts negatively. Consequently, when the potential is more negative than \u22121.1 V vs SHE, CO2 reduction cannot be accelerated by applying larger overpotential. For Ag electrode covered by cationic polymer layer (\u03c1p > 0, blue and orange curves), EStern increases continuously as the electrode potential shifts negatively. Moreover, EStern is higher when \u03c1p is more positive. The dashed gray curve in Fig. 6b plots EStern on bareAg electrode in K+containing acidic electrolyte. The promotion effect on EStern induced by the polymer layer with \u03c1p of 300C\u00b7cm\n-3 is comparable to the effect induced by the addition of K+ at \u22121.2 V to \u22121.9 V vs SHE. Considering that CO2 reduction occurs on Ag catalyst in this potential range (Fig. 3a), a cationic polyelectrolyte with \u03c1p = 300C\u00b7cm\n-3 and K+ ions should show comparable promoting effect on CO2 reduction.\nWe also simulated how the thickness of the polymer layer affects the migration of H+ and the value of EStern. As shown in Figure S24, the rate of H+ migration decreases as the thickness of the polymer layer increases, while the thickness of the polymer layer shows negligible effect on the value of EStern. Therefore, H+ reduction can be suppressed by increasing \u03c1p or increasing the thickness of the polymer layer, but CO2 reduction can be promoted only by increasing \u03c1p of the polymer layer. If the polymer layer can be compressed under the electrostatic attraction generated from the cathode, \u03c1p at the cathode side should increase. As shown in Figure S25, the accumulation of cationic site to the cathode side leads to lower migration rate of H+ and higher EStern. Both effects result in improved selectivity of CO2 reduction.\nIn summary, by decorating catalysts with c-PDDA, a cross-linked polyelectrolyte with high cation density, CO2 reduction in metal cation-free acidic electrolyte was realized. CO and formic acid were produced with high Faradaic efficiency on Ag and In catalysts, respectively. Electrochemical measurements with MDE and GMPNP\nsimulations indicate that the cationic sites carried by the polymer layer play a similar role as alkali cations dissolved in acidic electrolyte on enabling CO2 reduction, namely, suppressing the migration of H\n+ and enhancing the electricfield in Stern layer.ConductingCO2 reduction in metal cation-free acidic electrolyte helps to improve the sustainability of CO2 reduction technique by maintaining the pH of electrolyte and inhibiting the flooding through GDE."

All potential values were converted to SHE scale according to: \u03c6(vs SHE) =\u03c6(vs Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl) + 0.197 V. An IrO2-decorated Ti foil as the counter electrode was in the other chamber. These two chambers were separated by a Nafion-211 membrane. 0.1M H2SO4 was used as the flowing electrolyte. The catholyte and the anolyte were circulated separately by two peristaltic pumps. The volumesof catholyte and anolytewereboth 30mLand the flow rates were both 10mL\u00b7min-1. CO2 was fed through a gas chamber behind the GDE. The flow rate was fixed at 30 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) by a mass flow controller. Electrolysis was conducted with chronopotentiometry method. Resistance of the electrolyte wasmeasured by impedance spectroscopy at \u22121.0 V vs SHE for all electrolytes (Table S1), and the real electrode potential (\u03c6real) was manually calculated with full iR compensation after electrolysis according to \u03c6real = \u03c6measured \u2013 iR. The average Averaged potentials were then reported. The gas phase products (H2 and CO) were quantified by an online gas chromatography (GC9790Plus, FULI INSTRUMENTS). The FEs of gas phase products were calculated based on the flow rate of the outlet gas from the flow cell measured by a soap film flowmeter. The liquid phase product (formic acid) was quantified by 1H-NMRwith dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the inner standard. The pH values of catholyte and anolyte were measured by a pH meter. To measure the mass of electrolyte permeating through the GDE, a piece offiltrate paper and apieceof cottonwoolwereput behind theGDE (in the gas chamber) to absorb the solution passing through the GDE, and the change of the total mass of the filtrate paper and the cotton wool before and after electrolysis was weighed. The measurements of mass of electrolyte permeating the GDE (Fig. 2d) and the CO2 reduction performances of c-PDDA decorated Ag NPs and In NPs (FEs and electrode potentials shown in Fig. 3a, b) were replicated with three electrodes prepared separately, respectively. The standard deviations were then calculated.\nHER on Ag MDE. A Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. At Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. The measurement was conducted in a single-chamber cell. 10mM HOTf solution was used as the electrolyte. HER polarization curves were collected with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method with the sweeping rate of 100mVs-1. The iR compensation was not conducted due to the small current."

The first and second terms on the right side of Eq. 3 correspond to the diffusion rate and the migration rate. The Poisson equation (Eq. (1)) and the conservations of mass (Eq. (2)) were solved simultaneously by COMSOL (v.6.0) with a MUMPS solver with a nonlinear automatic Newton method. Detailed procedures are in the \u2018Simulation section\u2019 of Supplementary Information. All parameters and coefficients used in the simulation are listed in Table S2. Considering that the values of Di are affected by the structure of polymer and the value of \u03b5r varies according to the local environment, GMPNP simulations with different values ofDi and \u03b5rwere also conducted to check whether the variation of these parameters affects the conclusion of the simulation. The results are summarized in Supplementary Note 2 (GMPNP simulations with varied diffusion coefficients and relative permittivity) and Tables S3-5."
