            "text": "Recent developments in direct electron detection technology are opening new research avenues in cryo\u2013Electron Microscopy (cryo\u2013EM). Faster and more effcient detectors significantly expand insights into the structure and function of biological molecules. Cryo\u2013EM presents exciting opportunities to study proteins, protein complexes, organelles, drug delivery systems, cells and tissues in great detail. A study by Peet et al. quantifies the beam induced sample damage depending on the accelerating voltage of the microscope. It is evident that reducing the operating voltage from 300 keV to 100 keV significantly reduces sample damage and simultaneously allows for recovery of 25 % more structural information [1]. To date, the majority of structures deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with resolution better than 3 \u212b were determined using single particle approach at 300 keV accelerating voltage [2,3]. Importantly, transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) operating at 300 keV are expensive to purchase and maintain, therefore, putting them out of reach for many researchers and present a significant barrier to discovery [4]. 100 keV TEMs offer a solution for democratic access to structure determination. Until last year, there was a paucity of suitable detectors optimised for 100 keV operation [5]. Here, we present first data from our newest direct electron detector optimised for 100 keV work, the Quantum C100. The Quantum C100 was specifically optimised with 100 keV accelerating voltage in mind. Main characteristics of the ideal detector are high detective quantum effciency (DQE) and modulation transfer function (MTF). These critical parameters are greatly improved by de novo design of the pixel itself. It contains a wafer scale CMOS sensor with a gapless array of 2048 x 2048 pixels and 54 um pitch. The large area is combined with a 2000 fps frame rate, resolution of 12 bits andmaximises performance in integrating and countingmodes. The initial results from our experiments characterising the first full size sensor using 100 keV electrons are shown [6].\nReferences 1. M. J. Peet, R. Henderson, C. J.
