    "abstractText": "In this paper, a low-altitude wind speed estimation method based on the fuselage frustum conformal array system is proposed. Firstly, based on the signal model of the fuselage conformal array radar, the four-dimensional joint phase compensation of the echo data in the Doppler domain and three-dimensional space-frequency domain is performed by using the four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method. Secondly, the clutter covariance matrix is estimated by the compensated echo data, and a space-time Adaptive Processing (STAP) processor suitable for low-altitude windshear target is constructed to suppress clutter. Finally, the maximum Doppler value of each distance cell is extracted, and the wind velocity is estimated. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress clutter and accurately estimate wind speed.",

            "text": "Low-altitude windshear is an atmospheric phenomenon in which the airflow below 600 m in height hits the ground and spreads in all directions [1]. Sudden generation, short duration and high hazard are the main characteristics of low-altitude windshear [2]. When an aircraft encounters low-altitude windshear during takeoff and landing phases, the pilot lacks sufficient time and space to control the aircraft\u2019s attitude, which often results in tragic air accidents [3]. Therefore, the study of low-altitude windshear detection and early warning technology is an important research topic in the field of civil aviation. Wind speed estimation is the basis of the entire process of low-altitude windshear detection, which directly affects the accuracy of windshear detection, so it is crucial to estimate wind speed accurately [4\u20136]. Airborne weather radar is an important tool for pilots to detect weather phenomena ahead of the aircraft during flight missions, and pilots can avoid severe weather phenomena such as low-altitude windshear on time based on the display and alerts from the airborne weather radar to ensure the safety of the entire mission [7]. With the development of aviation and the improvement of people\u2019s safety awareness, the practical use of aviation safety demands increasingly high requirements for the functionality and performance of airborne weather radar. At present, the widely used planar array antenna has the defects of limited scanning range and low spatial resolution of radar [8], while the conformal array antenna has the advantages of high space utilization, no limitation of scanning range, large antenna aperture and high azimuthal resolution [9]. Therefore, the adoption of airborne conformal array weather radar is of great significance for weather target detection. At the same time, the conformal array antenna element matches the radar carrier shape, which is in line with the \u201c blended-wing-body fusion\u201d technology as the main design concept of the next-generation civil aircraft [10\u201312].\nSensors 2023, 23, 371. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23010371 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 371 2 of 20\nWhen an airborne weather radar detects a low-altitude windshear target ahead, the widely distributed and strong ground clutter tends to drown out the low-altitude windshear signal, making it difficult to achieve wind speed estimation, so clutter suppression before wind speed estimation is especially important. In the forward-looking working state of airborne weather radar, the clutter distribution characteristics of the echo signal of each distance unit vary with the change of distance unit, especially in the near-ground distance unit performance is more dramatic, this phenomenon is called clutter range dependence. The inhomogeneity of clutter caused by range dependence makes the echo signal data samples of each distance unit no longer satisfy the independent identically distributed condition, which causes the deterioration in the performance of traditional clutter suppression methods and the degradation in target detection performance. At present, the compensation methods used for the clutter inhomogeneity problem are mainly Doppler compensation type methods, such as the DW method [13], the HODW method [14,15], the ADC method [16], etc. The DW method and HODW method start from the same point. Both of them are to compensate for the clutter Doppler frequency difference caused by different pitch angles between the reference distance unit and the distance unit under detection so that the clutter in the samples is approximately uniform. The difference between the two is that the DW method only compensates for the Doppler frequency in the main beam direction, while the HODW method compensates for the Doppler frequency corresponding to multiple azimuthal directions. The ADC method compensates the main clutter Doppler difference between the echo data sample of reference distance unit and the distance unit under detection in addition to the main clutter spatial frequency difference. These methods are all proposed based on the conventional uniform line array or planar array airborne radar cases. Conformal array antenna elements are distributed in two-dimensional or three-dimensional surface in space, and different from conventional arrays, its array structure leads to more complex clutter distribution and more serious clutter inhomogeneity [17]. None of the above methods can be applied to the compensation of spatial frequency for a conformal array distributed on a two-dimensional or three-dimensional surface in space. At present, there are literature studies [18\u201320] on low-altitude windshear detection technology, but all of them are for line or planar arrays. There is no research analysis on low-altitude windshear detection technology for fuselage frustum conformal array weather radar in the literature. A method is proposed to estimate the wind speed of low-altitude windshear in the fuselage frustum conformal array system for the problem that the useful signal will be affected by strong ground clutter when the low-altitude windshear is detected by fuselage frustum conformal array weather radar. The method is based first on the essential reason for the difficulty of clutter suppression caused by the special array structure of the fuselage frustum conformal array, and then uses the four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method for joint phase compensation of the echo data of each distance unit in the Doppler domain and the three-dimensional space-frequency domain. Secondly, the compensated echo data samples are used to estimate the clutter covariance matrix and construct a Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) processor for low-altitude windshear target to accumulate windshear signals while adaptively suppressing ground clutter. Finally, the maximum Doppler value of each distance unit is extracted to achieve the accurate estimation of wind field velocity. The simulation results show that the method can effectively achieve ground clutter suppression and accurate wind speed estimation."

The scattering point method [24] is adopted to superimpose the low-altitude windshear signal echo Sl at each scattering point within each distance unit to simulate the low-altitude windshear wind field. In the case of wet low-altitude windshear, there are a large number of rainfall particles, small droplets, etc. within the wind field.

The conventional Doppler compensation method is focused only on the conventional array type for echo compensation, which is unable to take into account the different characteristics of the clutter distribution due to the complex array structure of the fuselage frustum conformal array. The four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method deals with the clutter inhomogeneity problem from the clutter distribution characteristics of the fuselage frustum conformal array. In the next section, we first analyze the clutter characteristics of the fuselage frustum conformal array, then compensate the echo data of the fuselage frustum conformal array by the four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method, and finally use the compensated echo data for covariance matrix estimation.\n3.1.1. Analysis of the Clutter Characteristics of the Fuselage Frustum Conformal Array\nAssuming that the angle between the direction of flight of the aircraft and the positive direction of the X axis is \u03b8p, and the angle between the positive direction of the\nSensors 2023, 23, 371 7 of 20\nY axis is \u03d5p, .\nV(\u03b8p,\u03d5p) is the velocity vector in the direction of flight of the aircraft, . V(\u03b8p,\u03d5p) = [ V cos \u03b8p V sin \u03b8p 0 ]T. Suppose that the aircraft flies parallel to the ground, which means \u03d5p = 0, and then the normalized Doppler frequency of the ground clutter signal Fd can be expressed as:\nFd = 4\u03c6(\u03b8,\u03d5) \u00b7 . V(\u03b8p,\u03d5p)/(\u03bbfr)\n= 4V(cos\u03d5 cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8p + cos\u03d5 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8p)/(\u03bbfr) (13)\nThe normalized space domain frequency Fs of the ground clutter signal can be expressed as:\nFs = \u03c6(\u03b8,\u03d5) = [cos \u03b8 cos\u03d5 sin \u03b8 cos\u03d5 sin\u03d5], (14)\nFrom Equation (14), it can be seen that the normalized space-frequency Fs is distributed in three dimensions. For ease of presentation, define Fsx = cos\u03d5 cos \u03b8, Fsy = cos\u03d5 sin \u03b8, and Fsz = sin\u03d5.The Fsx domain represents the projection of the space-frequency Fs under the X axis, the Fsy domain represents the projection of the space-frequency Fs under the Y axis, and the Fsz domain represents the projection of the space-frequency Fs under the Z axis, which means Fs = [Fsx Fsy Fsz]. As seen in Equations (13) and (14), the clutter spectra of the airborne radar are interacting in the Doppler and space domain. For the line array antenna, the geometric distribution of the array elements in space is one-dimensional. Assuming that the line array axis is in line with the positive direction of X axis. Then, the direction of variation of the array elements in space is only in the direction of X axis. Therefore, the clutter space-time spectrum of the airborne line array radar can be described in two-dimensional space Fd \u2212 Fsx, and its two-dimensional distribution characteristic is obtained from Equation (13) [26]:\nFd\u2212linear = 4V(Fsx cos \u03b8p + sin \u03b8p \u221a cos2\u03d5\u2212 Fsx2)/(\u03bbfr), (15)\nFor the planar array antenna, the geometric distribution of its array elements in space is two-dimensional. Assuming that the length of the planar array is in line with the positive direction of the X axis and the width is in line with the positive direction of Y axis. Then the variation of the array elements in space is in the X\u2212O\u2212 Y plane, so the clutter of the airborne planar array radar is described in three-dimensional space Fd \u2212 Fsx \u2212 Fsy, and its distribution characteristics are obtained from Equation (13) [26]:\nFd\u2212planar = 4V(Fsx cos \u03b8p + Fsy sin \u03b8p)/(\u03bbfr), (16)\nAs for the fuselage frustum conformal array, the antenna array elements are geometrically distributed in space as three-dimensional space, so its clutter distribution characteristic needs to be described in four-dimensional space Fd\u2212 Fsx\u2212 Fsy\u2212 Fsz, which can be obtained from Equation (13) [26]:\nFd\u2212frustum = 4V [\u221a 1\u2212 Fsz2( Fsx\ncos\u03d5 cos \u03b8p + Fsy cos\u03d5\nsin \u03b8p) ] /(\u03bbfr), (17)\nFrom Equation (17), it can be seen that the range of values of Fsx, Fsy and Fsz varies with different pitch angles \u03d5l corresponding to different distance units in the clutter spacefrequency of the fuselage frustum conformal array. The Doppler frequency Fd\u2212frustum is a function of Fsx, Fsy and Fsz, and the joint distribution curve of Doppler frequency and space domain of the clutter in different distance units is varied within the four-dimensional space Fd \u2212 Fsx \u2212 Fsy \u2212 Fsz. It is also known from Equation (15) and Equation (16) that the clutter distribution of the line and planar array airborne radar is only distributed in two and three dimensions, and the clutter distribution of fuselage frustum conformal array is\nSensors 2023, 23, 371 8 of 20\nmore complex in comparison with it. Therefore, the clutter of fuselage frustum conformal array radar has more serious inhomogeneity in comparison with the line or planar array. Figure 3 shows the distribution curves of multiple distance unit clutter echo signals of the fuselage frustum conformal array when \u03b8p = 90\u25e6. In which, Figure 3a shows the spatial one-dimensional distributed clutter characteristics; Figure 3b,c show the spatial threedimensional distributed clutter characteristics. Since it is impossible to show the clutter characteristics in the four-dimensional space Fd \u2212 Fsx \u2212 Fsy \u2212 Fsz by four-dimensional coordinates, two three-dimensional coordinate systems are used to describe them. From Figure 3, it can be seen that the main clutter position of the fuselage frustum conformal array varies along the four frequency directions of Fd, Fsx, Fsy and Fsz for different main beam pointing cases. The conventional Doppler compensation method only compensates for the clutter in two-dimensional space, Fd \u2212 Fsx, and is no longer applicable to the fuselage frustum conformal array.

Among them, Figure 5a shows the Distance-Doppler spectrum of the echo signal in the uncompensated case of the fuselage frustum conformal array. Figure 5b shows the Distance-Doppler spectrum of the echo signal after the DW compensation method. Figure 5c shows the Distance-Doppler spectrum of the echo signal after the compensation by the four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method proposed in this paper. As can be seen from Figure 5a, the ground clutter signal is mainly concentrated on the zero frequency, and its amplitude is significantly higher than that of the windshear signal, even drowning the windshear signal. The Distance-Doppler spectrum of the ground clutter signal in the near-ground distance unit shows a serious range dependence, which increases the difficulty of the subsequent clutter suppression processing. Compared with Figure 5a, the range dependence of the near-ground distance unit has been suppressed to some extent in Figure 5b after compensated by the DW compensation method. However, the clutter amplitude is still much higher than that of the windshear signal, which is submerged in the ground clutter signal, making it difficult to estimate the wind speed. After compensating the echo signal by the four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method proposed in this paper, the clutter range dependence of the near-ground distance unit has been suppressed in Figure 5c. The method reduces the variability of the clutter space-time distribution between the echo data samples due to the structure of the fuselage frustum conformal array. The windshear signal can be clearly distinguished from the ground clutter, which is easier for the subsequent wind speed estimation. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the improvement factors of the method in this paper, the STAP method, the DW-STAP method, and the ADC-STAP method (80th distance unit).

            "text": "For the problem that the useful signal is affected by strong ground clutter when detecting low-altitude windshear, a method for estimating low-altitude windshear wind speed in the fuselage frustum conformal array system is proposed. The method introduces the fuselage frustum conformal array and analyzes the essential reasons for the difficulty of clutter suppression in the fuselage frustum conformal array. Then, it uses a four-dimensional frequency domain compensation method to combine the phase compensation of the echo data of each distance unit in the Doppler domain and the three-dimensional space-frequency domain. After that, it estimates the clutter covariance matrix from the compensated echo data samples and constructs a space-time adaptive processor applicable to the low-altitude windshear target. Finally, it extracts the maximum Doppler value of each distance unit after adaptively suppressing the ground clutter to achieve the accurate estimation of wind field velocity. The simulation results show that the method can effectively suppress the ground clutter and accurately estimate the wind speed in the fuselage frustum conformal array system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.L. and L.Z.; methodology, H.L. and L.Z; software, H.L. and L.Z.; validation, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; formal analysis, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; investigation, H.L. and F.M.; resources, H.L and F.M.; data curation, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; visualization, H.L. and L.Z.; supervision, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; project administration, H.L., L.Z. and F.M.; funding acquisition, H.L.
