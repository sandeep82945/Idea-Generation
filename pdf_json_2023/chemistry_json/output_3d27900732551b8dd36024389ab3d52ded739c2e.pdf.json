            "text": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the dominant energy storage technology for portable and automotive applications; however, the high cost and geographical constraints of lithium resources make it impossible to sustain and meet the exploding market demands.1 As an alternative to LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are gaining increased recognition as next generation low cost energy storage devices, owing to the natural abundance of sodium resources (\u223c2.5% in the Earth's crust) and their similar electrochemical properties to LIBs.2,3 A series of high-performance sodium storage electrode materials have been investigated to pursue the ever-growing demand for higher energy density.4 Cathode materials such as layered oxides,5 polyanionic compounds,6,7 and Prussian blue analogues,8 as well as anode materials such as hard carbons,9 conversion\nower Sources, College of Chemistry and uhan, Hubei 430072, China.

However, as for Na-ion full cells, where the Na-containing cathode is the only reserve of active sodium ions, such a considerable Na+ loss dramatically reduces the overall energy density and shortens the lifespan of full cells. For instance, hard carbon (HC) anodes usually have a low ICE of only 60\u201380%, which leads to nearly one-third of capacity loss during the initial charge process.16\nNumerous research efforts have been committed to resolving this issue by offering an additional Na source to counteract the initial capacity loss (ICL) of anodes, known as presodiation.17,18 In the early stage, presodiation has been carried out by the operation of highly active Na mental. Examples include direct contact of the anode electrodes with Na metal disks19 or assembling them into a primary cell.20 In these cases, the irreversible capacity can be readily dismissed via the self-discharge\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Another effective approach is to incorporate sacricial sodium salts such as NaN3,21 Na2C2O4,22 and Na2C4O4,23 and Na3C6H5O7,24 into the cathode side by using their irreversible charging capacity through the electrochemical decomposition mechanism with undesirable impurity generation. Developing a sodiumenriched cathode that can provide extra endogenous sodium ions (beyond its normal stoichiometric ratio) is also an intriguing presodiation method. For instance, the Na3V2(PO4)3 (Na3VP) cathode can safely accommodate over-stoichiometric Na+ to form novel Na-enriched materials of Na4V2(PO4)3 (Na4VP) and Na5V2(PO4)3 (Na5VP), which correspond to distinct sodiation plateaus at approximately \u223c1.6 V and \u223c0.3 V vs. Na+/ Na, respectively.25\u201329 Each excess Na+ in the formula theoretically provides an additional 58.8 mA h g\u22121 charging capacity. Li et al.27 prepared a Na4VP electrode by electrochemically discharging Na3VP to 1.0 V vs. Na\n+/Na. The intermediate product Na4VP is then used as a cathode and an extra Na source to sodiate hard carbon, aer which it reverts to Na3VP with no residue le in the cell congurations. The resulting Na4VP\u2016HC full cell exhibits a high energy density of 265 W h kg\u22121, which is 76% higher than that of 151 W h kg\u22121 for the Na3VP\u2016HC control cell. Nevertheless, the electrochemical presodiation procedure is complicated and time-consuming, and thus not suitable for industrial application due to the multiple assemblingdissembling steps.\nAlternatively, chemical presodiation using hyperactive arenesodium reagents is more promising from the perspective of application considering its high efficiency, straightforward operation, and easily scalable feature.30,31 Many aromatic sodium complexes, such as biphenyl sodium (Biph-Na) and naphthalene sodium (Naph-Na), with redox potentials of 0.16 and 0.09 V (vs. Na+/Na), have been widely investigated in presodiation for anodematerials.32\u201336 Liu and coworkers used BiphNa as a liquid sodium source and obtained Na4VP electrodes aer immersing Na3VP for 30 s. In anode-free Na4VP\u2016Al batteries and Na4VP\u2016HC full cells, the efficiency of the presodiation strategy has been reconrmed with indicators of signicantly increased specic capacity and lifespan.26 However, it should be pointed out that Biph-Na adopted by Liu et al. may not be a suitable reagent for Na4VP generation because of their potential mismatch (which will be discussed in detail below), that might cause oversodiation to form Na5VP. Besides, a series of parasite reactions including structure degradation and interface damage will be triggered during the over-reduction process, which negatively affect electrochemical performance.37\u201339 In conclusion, the key to cathode presodiation is to design sodiation reagents with modest reducing ability that are specically designed for cathode materials.\nHerein, we rst developed a phenazine-mediated ambient chemical sodiation strategy to controllably synthesize a Naenriched Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode guided by the principle of redox-potential matching. Phenazine-sodium (PNZ-Na) is elaborately screened as the optimal sodiation reagent because it possesses an appropriate reducing potential of 1.56 V vs. Na+/ Na, which is just below the sodiation potential of Na3VP/Na4VP (1.67 V vs. Na+/Na), but much higher than that of the over-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The crystal structure, sodiation reaction mechanism and electrochemical performance of the as-obtained Na4VP have been veried by multiple characterization techniques, including XRD, XPS, TEM, ssNMR, and electrochemical tests. Beneting from excess Na+ in the formula, the Na4VP cathode completely compensated the ICL from the anode without any exogenous impurities, resulting in a Na4VP\u2016HC full cell exhibiting higher reversible capacity and energy density than the control Na3VP\u2016HC full cell."

            "text": "Screening appropriate sodiation reagents guided by the potential matching principle\nNa3V2(PO4)3 with a NASICON (Na super ionic conductor) structure is formed by the corner-sharing of the PO4 tetrahedron and VO6 octahedron, providing plenty of large channels for Na+ diffusion.40 As depicted in Fig. 1a, its crystal structure contains three isolated sodium storage sites with different oxygen surroundings, namely occupied Na1 and Na2 sites and a vacant Na3 site. More specically, two Na+ ions at the Na2 site (0.67 occupation) exhibit electrochemical activity, while one Na+ ion at the Na1 site (1.0 occupation) is electrochemically inert. The remaining empty sites enable the lattice to accommodate over-stoichiometric Na+ and further generate Na-enriched phases.41\nAs the cathode, Na3VP undergoes a typical biphase transition to form Na1V2(PO4)3 (Na1VP) and completely removes two Na + from the Na2 site accompanied by two V3+ oxidizing to V4+, resulting in a theoretical capacity of 117.6 mA h g\u22121 and a voltage plateau at 3.36 V vs. Na+/Na (Fig. 1b). Recent investigations revealed that the V2+/V3+ redox couple in Na3VP can also be activated by controlling the sodiation depth, viz., the potential window of charge/discharge measurement.25 In the over-discharging process (Fig. 1b), two V3+ in Na3VP can be reduced to V2+ respectively and over-stoichiometric Na+ is embedded in the lattice to balance the charge. The rst Na+ is inserted into the empty Na2 site to generate the Na4V2(PO4)3 phase (Na4VP, 1.67 V vs. Na\n+/Na), followed by the second Na+ in the vacant Na3 site to generate the Na5V2(PO4)3 phase (Na5VP, 0.28 V vs. Na+/Na). Of particular note, deep-sodiated Na5VP is energetically unfavorable due to the intense coulombic repulsion, thus leading to an extraordinarily low voltage plateau.\nThe structure evolution of Na3VP during the desodiation/ sodiation process is intensively investigated by in situ XRD (Fig. 1c and S1\u2020). Initially, all diffraction peaks can be assigned to Na3VP, showing a rhombohedral structure with a space group of R-3c.25 When charging (desodiation) to 3.7 V, the diffraction peaks of Na3VP diminish gradually while the peaks of Na1VP increase, presenting continuous phase transformation. The peak shi to higher angles demonstrates lattice shrinkage resulting from the removal of Na+. During the discharge (sodiation) process, an opposite trend is observed from Na1VP to Na3VP. Aerwards, over-discharging leads to the appearance of the Na4VP new phase, as indicated by a plateau at around 1.67 V (vs. Na+/Na) and emerging diffraction peaks at 23.5\u00b0, 28.5\u00b0, 30.8\u00b0,\nChem.

Upon further sodiation, a new plateau appears at about 0.28 V (vs. Na+/Na) while diffraction peaks at 23.5\u00b0 and 28.5\u00b0 fade away gradually, accompanying the formation of Na5VP.28 Operando XRD conrms the feasibility of the presodiation strategy to produce sodium-enriched phases from Na3VP and reveal the corresponding structure information.\nThe cyclic voltammogram (CV) prole (Fig. 1d) obtained between 0.1 and 3.7 V (vs. Na+/Na) reconrms the accessibility of Na4VP and Na5VP. Three pairs of cathodic/anodic peaks located at \u223c0.20/0.36, \u223c1.56/1.78 and \u223c3.30/3.48 V are in good agreement with plateaus observed in the galvanostatic charge/ discharge proles (eqn (1)\u2013(3)). Notably, a broad irreversible peak is observed between 0.3 and 0.9 V, implying aggressive\n12572 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12570\u201312581\nelectrolyte decomposition. During the cycles (Fig. S2\u2020), all the peak currents prominently diminish and the polarization gradually increases, owing to the structure deterioration of active materials and the accumulation of the SEI on the electrode surface. In contrast, the CV curves between 1.0 and 4.0 V almost completely overlapped aer the initial cycle (Fig. S3\u2020), indicating the highly reversible phase transition among Na1VP, Na3VP, and Na4VP. The split of the cathodic peak in the rst cycle may be ascribed to the minor structure rearrangement of the active material.42 The narrower CV peaks also imply a faster Na+ insertion process for Na4VP than Na5VP. It is important to note that Na5VP exhibits low inital coulombic efficiency (ICEcathode is dened as the ratio of sodiation capacity to desodiation capacity of a cathode), rendering it incompatible with HC anodes (Fig. S4\u2020). As mentioned above, the typical ICEanode (dened as the ratio of desodiation capacity to sodiation\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

When Na5VP with an ICE of merely 40% matches with HC anodes, surplus Na+ will be introduced into the full cells and form uncontrollable sodium dendrites on the anode side, resulting in safety concerns. Therefore, Na4VP has a suitable ICE (\u223c64%) and excellent structural stability, denoting its superiority for active sodium compensation in full cells.\nAs displayed in Fig. 1e, currently reported aromatic sodium reagents, such as Biph-Na and Naph-Na, demonstrate ultra-low redox potentials of 0.16 V and 0.09 V vs. Na+/Na for cathode materials (lower than the Na5VP formation potential of 0.28 V vs. Na+/Na). In order to prevent over-sodiation from yielding Na5VP or other parasite reactions, the treatment duration with sodium reagents must be strictly controlled, which is not conducive to industrial batch application. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop appropriate sodium reagents to achieve a rened precise and controllable preparation of Na4VP.\nNa+ insertion/extraction reaction of NaxVP:\nNa1VP + 2e \u2212 + 2Na+ # Na3VP E = 3.36 V (1)\nNa3VP + e \u2212 + Na+ # Na4VP E = 1.67 V (2)\nNa4VP + e \u2212 + Na+ # Na5VP E = 0.28 V (3)\nPreparation of the PNZ-Na reagent:\nPNZ\u00feNa !DMEPNZ* Na\u00fe E \u00bc 1:56 V (4)\nPrecise chemical sodiation of Na3VP enabled by the PNZ-Na reagent:\nPNZ-Na + Na3VP / PNZ + Na4VP (5)\nIn accordance with the potential-matched chemical sodiation strategy (Fig. 1f), phenazine sodium (PNZ-Na) has been elaborately chosen as a suitable sodiation reagent due to its appropriate potential. The PNZ-Na reagent displays a pair of reversible redox peaks at 1.51 and 1.62 V (vs. Na+/Na, Fig. 1e), corresponding to the PNZ/PNZ\u2212 redox couple (eqn (4)). PNZ-Na exhibits the highest potential as a sodiation reagent reported so far,26,32,33,43 beneting from the strong electron-withdrawing effect of nitrogen atoms and the efficient charge dispersion provided by the additional six-membered ring.44,45 Hence, the end-point of the reaction is effectively clamped by the PNZ-Na reagent potential, thus preventing over-sodiation. During the chemical presodiation process, reductive PNZ-Na concurrently donates Na+ and e\u2212 for Na3VP while also leading to the recovery of intrinsic phenazine molecules (eqn (5)). The sodium ions diffuse into the Na3VP lattice and locate at the partially occupied Na2 site to form a pure Na4VP phase.\nControllable synthesis of Na-enriched Na4VP via the chemical sodiation strategy\nThe chemical presodiation of the Na3VP cathode is conducted simply by immersing the electrode into PNZ-Na solution for a particular time, followed by DME rinse to remove the residual\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nPNZ-Na. Phenazine and sodium metal are mixed in dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent in equal amounts to obtain the PNZNa reagent, as described in eqn (4). The strong electron affinity of heterocyclic aromatics causes the outermost electrons of Na metal to transfer spontaneously to the conjugated phenazine rings, producing grape-purple colored PNZ\u2212 radicals (Fig. 2a le).46,47 Once the Na3VP electrode is immersed in the PNZ-Na solution, the sodiation reaction proceeds through electron transfer from the PNZ\u2212 radical to Na3VP along with Na + accommodation to form Na4VP (eqn (5)). Following the reaction, the purple PNZ\u2212 radical dissolved in DME is converted to a pristine PNZ molecule, resulting in the PNZ-Na solution fading (Fig. 2a right).\nTo probe the reaction pathways, we prepared presodiated NaxVP (3 # x # 4) electrodes with various immersion times of 30\u2013120 s. As the reaction time increases, the emergence of new diffraction peaks at 30.8\u00b0 and 34.7\u00b0, along with growing intensity, is attributable to the Na4VP phase, while the peaks of Na3VP at 31.6\u00b0 (116) and 35.6\u00b0 (300) weaken (Fig. 2b). This outcome reveals that two phases, Na3VP and Na4VP, coexist during the presodiation process (30 s and 60 s), which is consistent with in situ XRD and prior reports.26,28 Notably, Na3VP is completely converted to Na4VP aer presodiation for more than 90 s. (Fig. S5\u2020) The XRD pattern of chemically presodiated Na4VP is identical to that of electrochemically sodiated Na4VP, implying a rapid Na\n+ migration in the cathode and a uniform sodiation process achieved by chemical presodiation. The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) tests accurately determine the Na content in different samples (Fig. 2c). The samples with treatment time of 30, 60, and over 90 s are accordingly denoted as Na3.37VP, Na3.68VP, and Na4VP.\nThe presodiation degree of NaxVP achieved via chemical treatment is also evaluated using electrochemical performance in sodium half-coin cells. The initial charge curves of NaxVP, including ICE and plateau capacity at about 1.67 V that correspond to Na4VP, are displayed in Fig. 2d and e. The open circuit voltage (OCV vs. Na+/Na) dramatically drops during the biphasic process from Na3VP to Na4VP, aer which it remains stable at around 1.67 V. The presodiated NaxVP exhibits a continuous increase in initial charge capacity (i.e., Na extraction), whereas the ICE decreases with increasing sodiation time, indicating a sustained Na+ insertion reaction (Fig. S6\u2020). Consequently, the chemical presodiation process continues until Na3VP diminishes, as reected by a constant ICE of \u223c64% and an increased specic capacity of \u223c56 mA h g\u22121, respectively. Notably, no unnecessary parasitic reactions are introduced due to the identical charge\u2013discharge curves and ICE between chemical and electrochemical sodiation (Fig. S7a\u2020). The redox potentials between the reductive agent and Na3VP are well-matched, thereby avoiding the issues of over-sodiation, inhomogeneity, and inconsistency during scaling up for mass production. Even with excessive treatment time (30 min) and reagent dosage, there is no structural damage to the cathode materials, demonstrating the success of our chemical presodiation strategy based on the redox-potential matched principle (Fig. S7b\u2020). The sodiation reaction self-terminates once all\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12570\u201312581 | 12573\nFig. 2 (a) Optical photographs of the phenazine sodium reagent before and after reaction with Na3VP.

We further conducted the in situ XRD test of the PNZ-Na presodiated Na4VP electrode (Fig. S8 and S9\u2020). The variation of diffraction peaks is consistent with the electrochemical sodiation process, and there is no impurity phase introduced by presodiation treatment. It is a highly reversible transformation between Na4VP and Na3VP and reconrms that presodiation has no adverse effect on the lattice structure. Therefore, the reliability of the chemical presodiation strategy is rmly authenticated.\nRaman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are further employed in order to explore the effect of presodiation treatment on the structure of the Na3VP cathode. The Raman spectra shown in Fig. 2f indicate that the symmetric bending vibration peak of the PO4 tetrahedron in Na3VP at 453 cm\u22121 is slightly blue-shied aer presodiation treatment. This result suggests the enhancement of P\u2013O bond energy and boosting ionicity of the Na4VP lattice.48 The valence states of vanadium ions are veried by the XPS results. The survey XPS\n12574 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12570\u201312581\nspectrum (Fig. S10\u2020) conrms the presence of the same chemical composition elements in Na3VP and Na4VP. The binding energy of P 2p shis toward the higher energy direction (from 133.4 eV to 133.7 eV), reconrming the stronger P\u2013O bonds (Fig. S11\u2020). As seen in Fig. 2g and h, the V 2p peaks broaden aer presodiation and reveal the coexistence of mixed V3+ and V2+ ions in the lattice. The two peaks of Na3VP at 516.8 eV and 523.9 eV coincide with V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V\n3+, which means only trivalent vanadium is observed in the pristine electrode.49 Except for the peaks above, new peaks at 514.9 eV and 522.5 eV can be ascribed to the contribution of V2+ in Na4VP.26 Further quantitative analysis of the V 2p spectrum indicates a V3+/V2+ ratio of 0.49/0.51 based on the integral area of deconvoluted peaks, which agrees well with the valence distribution for Na4VP. All the characterization studies above demonstrate that the PNZ-Na solution can readily and controllably presodiate the Na3VP cathode in a relatively short time.\nThe morphological evolution of the Na3VP and Na4VP samples is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM),\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The results show that both Na3VP and Na4VP exhibit a regular spherical morphology, with a diameter ranging from 5\u201315 mm, consisting of primary particles that are densely packed to form secondary particles (Fig. 3a and d). Apparently, the morphology characteristic of sodiated Na4VP is not affected by the chemical treatment and helps to retain the electrochemical performance (Fig. S12\u2020). The energydispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis reconrms the Na/V ratios of Na3VP and Na4VP to be 1.49 and 1.99, respectively (Fig. S13\u2020). Cross sections are obtained by FIB-SEM to monitor microstructural damage, while no microcracks are observed aer presodiation treatment (Fig. 3b and e). It should be noted that the internal voids in the particles are formed by primary particle agglomeration rather than structure degradation. HRTEM images in Fig. 3c reveal well-dened lattice fringes of 0.373 nm ascribed to the (113) planes in the Na3VP lattice. Likewise, we observe characteristic lattice fringes of 0.378 nm (Fig. 3f), corresponding to the emerging 23.5\u00b0 diffraction peak in the Na4VP lattice (Fig. 2b).\n23Na/31P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) offers in-depth insights into local structural transformation while probing the oxidation states of the neighboring vanadium ions. For 31P spectra, the signals are caused by the unpaired electronic spin transfer from TM d orbitals to the 31P nuclei through chemical bonds.50 Fig. S14\u2020 presents the room temperature 31P spectra for Na3VP and Na4VP. In the Na3VP lattice, a broad asymmetric peak at 2000\u20133500 ppm reects a twisted environment for the 31P nuclei.51 While in Na4VP, the corresponding peak with decreasing intensity reveals the reducing dipolar interaction between unpaired electron spins of V and P nuclei. In contrast, a new broad peak at 3500\u2013 5000 ppm is observed in Na4VP, which is attributed to the\nFig. 3 (a\u2013c) SEM image, cross section and HR-TEM image of Na3VP, resp respectively.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncomplicated interaction between V2+ and adjacent phosphate groups.50 This phenomenon is because the V2+ (t2g 3eg 0) owning three unpaired electrons is more paramagnetic than V3+ (t2g 2eg\n0) and generally causes a larger Fermi contact shi. Similar results are also observed in 23Na spectra.\nTurning to the 23Na NMR spectra, the signals of Na4VP are recorded at 8, 10, and 12 kHz to distinguish the isotropic signals and spinning side bands denoted by asterisks (Fig. 4a). A typical 23Na spectrum of Na3VP is presented in Fig. 4b and c, which includes two signicant signals at 83 and 18 ppm with very different magnitudes and a set of spinning side bands. As previously reported by Hu et al.,52 the oxidation state of vanadium centers coordinated with Na at Na1 sites is higher than those coordinated with Na at Na2 sites, leading to a more signicant 23Na shi at the Na2 site in contrast with that at the Na1 site. Similar paramagnetic effects have also been reported in LIBs on 7Li NMR shis.53 Based on these results, the signals at 83 and 18 ppm are assigned to the partially occupied Na2 site and fully lled Na1 site, respectively. Only Na at the Na2 site has electrochemical activity on account of the relatively weak bonding. The signal peaks shrink and slightly shi to the higher direction with the increasing sodium content of these samples (Fig. 4b). This phenomenon suggests a more ordered environment of Na, whereas more V2+ leads to a higher shi. We speculate that the shrinkage of peaks from Na3VP to Na4VP is due to a decrease in Na+ motion. Because of the partially occupied Na2 site, Na3VP has more Na vacancies than the fully occupied Na4VP. We further investigate Na\n+ diffusion kinetics by the CV technique at varied scan rates (Fig. S15 and S16\u2020). The Na+ diffusion coefficients of Na4VP decrease as we suspected, indicating the reduced mobility of sodium ions. The tted spectra of samples with different sodiated degrees are presented in Fig. 4c and d and we conclude that the Na2/Na1 peak\nectively.

In other words, excess sodium ions that Na3VP receives from the PNZ-Na solution are preferentially accommodated in the Na2 site, making it close to completely occupied in the Na4VP sample.\nThe electrochemical performance of the Na-enriched Na4VP cathode\nThe sodium storage capability of the sodiatied samples is investigated through galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge tests in half-cells with a Na-metal anode. All of the NaxVP electrodes with different treatment times manifest the same cycling stability at 0.5C for 100 cycles as pristine Na3VP (Fig. S17\u2020). Even extending the treatment time to 30 min, no discernible capacity decay is observed, suggesting that the electrochemical performance is completely retained aer presodiation treatment. Our\n12576 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 12570\u201312581\npresodiation strategy is not strict with processing time and is expected to achieve large-scale production. In the following discussion, we primarily focus on the comparison between pristine Na3VP and the sodiated Na4VP. Fig. 5a displays the CV curves of Na4VP at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s\n\u22121. The OCV of the Na4VP sample is close to 1.6 V which is related to the average valence of V ions, in line with previous discussion. During the rst cathodic scan, the rst oxidation peak appears at around 1.7 V corresponding to the rst distinct plateau in the charge prole of Na4VP (Fig. 5b). These features, which are absent in Na3VP electrodes, are because of the oxidation V\n2+/V3+ in the Naenriched phase and the extraction of the pre-doped sodium ions. When all pre-doped sodium is removed, the Na-enriched Na4VP entirely transforms into Na3VP and then presents a typical voltage plateau of 3.4 V attributed to the reversible V3+/ V4+ redox couple, validated by well-overlapped CV proles.

These results reconrm that the preparation of the Na4VP cathode to offer charge compensation and an additional Na reservoir has been successfully implemented. The rate capability and long-term cycling stability of the two samples are analysed as shown in Fig. 5c\u2013e in a voltage window of 2.0\u20134.0 V (vs. Na+/Na). The Na4VP electrode exhibits reversible desodiation capacities of 109.4, 107.5, 106.1, 101, 98.1, and 92.8 mA h g\u22121 at rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5C, respectively, slightly higher than that of the Na3VP electrode. When the rate comes back to 0.2C, a reversible capacity of about 108 mA h g\u22121 is achieved, suggesting the excellent reversibility of the Na4VP electrode. The Na4VP electrode also retains an outperformed cycling stability with high capacity retentions of 95.3% at 0.5C aer 200 cycles and 91.8% at 1C aer 600 cycles.\nNa4VP\u2016HC full cells are assembled to demonstrate the application feasibility of Na4VP as both the cathode and extra\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

For the fabrication of full cells, the mass matching between the cathode and anode is based on their capacity balance, which is determined by the charge capacity of the cathode and the discharge capacity of the anode. As displayed in Fig. 6a and b, during the rst charge, both the irreversible sodium storage sites of the anode and the formation of the SEI will consume considerable active sodium. More Na3VP cathode is commonly to be matched with HC and in a Na-poor state in the following cycles, namely Na3\u2212xVP. As an alternative, the Na4VP electrode used for full cells enables a 35.2 wt% reduction in cathode mass compared to the Na3VP electrode and ensures that the cathode as Na3VP without Na loss participates in subsequent cycles.\nAs shown in Fig. 6c, the Na3VP\u2016HC and Na4VP\u2016HC full cells deliver a charge capacity of 111 and 168 mA h g\u22121, respectively, matching well with the values in half cell conguration.

This result can be attributed to the failed Na+ reinsertion on the cathode side in the absence of extra endogenous Na+. In comparison, the full cell with the Na4VP cathode shows an initial discharge capacity of 109.7 mA h g\u22121 and an ICE of 65%, which are equivalent to that of the Na3VP half-cell, demonstrating extremely high utilization of active materials. Similar to other published results (Table S1\u2020), the low ICE is ascribed to irreversible Na compensation during the initial charge cycle, but subsequent average coulombic efficiency is higher than that of\n12578 | Chem.

In contrast, Na3VP\u2016HC exhibits much lower reversible capacity due to active sodium loss. Overall, Na4VP\u2016HC exhibits an impressive discharge capacity of 111 mA h g\u22121 with an ICE of 66%, and an energy density of 251.1 W h kg\u22121 based on the total mass of cathode and anode active materials. This is far superior to those of the control cell using the pristine Na3VP cathode (ICE of 60% and an energy density of 159.4 W h kg\u22121). The Na4VP\u2016HC full cell shows a decent cycling stability of 78% capacity retention at 1C aer 100 cycles and 57% capacity retention at 2C aer 500 cycles (Fig. 6e and S19), which is comparable with that of the control Na3VP\u2016HC full cell, but shows markedly enhanced reversible capacity. Table S1 in the ESI\u2020 compares the recently published NVP-based full cells in terms of electrochemical performance and energy density. To the best of our knowledge, the energy density of PNZ-Na presodiated Na4VP\u2016HC is among the best of the reported values for NVP-based full cells. These discrepancies strongly suggest that our presodiation strategy can improve the overall energy density of SIBs while simultaneously maintaining decent cycling stability."

            "text": "In summary, we have reported a facile and effective chemical presodiation approach to prepare a Na-enriched Na4VP cathode under the guidance of the redox-potential-matching principle. The phenazine-Na reagent with a redox potential of 1.56 V vs. Na+/Na was employed to pre-dope active Na+ into the Na3VP lattice for the Na4VP cathode, successfully retaining the structure stability and electrochemical performance. Na4VP initially serves as an excess Na reservoir and a cathode to eliminate the active Na+ loss on the anode side, allowing the full capacity of Na3VP to be used for the subsequent cycles. Our presodiation strategy not only enables rapid preparation of Na4VP and is expected to achieve batch production, but also doesn't bring about any external impurities aer sodium compensation. The energy density of the Na4VP\u2016HC full cell is 251.1 W h kg\n\u22121, much greater than that of the Na3VP\u2016HC full cell (159.4 W h kg\u22121). Most importantly, this approach can be broadly applicable to different cathode materials and opens up new avenues for the design of high-energy SIBs."
