    "abstractText": "This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different narrative scenarios regarding students\u2019 intentions to undergo diagnostic screening for hepatitis C, and whether gender identification with the characters of the scenario could influence the students\u2019 intentions to undergo a medical test. A sample of 600 participants was administered three narrative scenarios with different frames (positive, negative, and ambivalent), including two gender options (male and female) for the main character of the story. A statistically significant three-way interaction between scenario, gender identification, and time resulted. There were significant simple main effects on the intention to have a diagnostic test for hepatitis C for the scenarios with the protagonist of the same gender as the participant and after the administration of the negative scenario. The use of a negative scenario with the same gender character was always more effective than the use of a positive framed scenario, even though there was a high level of knowledge regarding the disease. Personal diagnostic testing was not directly associated with knowledge regarding the infection. The findings of this study can ultimately help policymakers develop communication campaigns adapted to target populations such as college students, in order to raise awareness of the risk, promote prevention and behavioral change, and encourage medical screening.",

HCV can have both acute and chronic consequences, and it is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1, 2). New HCV infections are usually asymptomatic, or the symptoms can take up to 30 years to appear (3). The consequence of this gap is that approximately 70% of infected people are not aware that they are infected, so they do not follow therapies or treatments, and the transmission takes place very easily (4, 5).\nHepatitis C is present throughout the world, with a high prevalence in European countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 58 million people are affected by chronic HCV and 290,000 deaths in 2019 (6). Italy appears to be one of the European countries with the highest number of patients with hepatitis C. Epidemiological data show an estimated prevalence\nof the chronic disease in about 3% of the population (1.5 million people), with a very variable geographical distribution. The frequency of infection is higher in the center and south of Italy than in the north (7, 8). A study promoted by Doxa Pharma, \u201cItalians and Hepatitis C,\u201d has highlighted citizens\u2019 lack of knowledge regarding this disease. The study found that 69% of respondents knew little or nothing about hepatitis C and tended to underestimate its severity (9).\nToday, the major risk factors for getting infected are surgery, blood transfusions, organ transplants, percutaneous exposure during cosmetic treatments, unprotected sexual relations, and intravenous drug use (3). Piercing and tattoos are also risk factors for hepatitis C infection when these practices are performed with non-sterile instruments and in unsafe environments (10). Even manicures or pedicures performed with non-sterilized or disposable instruments represent a significant danger of infection. Many practices related to the transmission of the virus can be considered more common among young people. Scientific evidence shows that risky behaviors are widespread among young people and requires particular attention and adequate measures, not only because of the serious health and psychosocial implications but also because of the association with multiple risk behaviors (10, 11).\nFor this reason, we decided to carry out research on this specific age target, focusing on university students.\nHealth promotion among university students has not always been considered a priority in targeting preventive policies and actions because students are assumed to be in a relatively healthy phase of their life. However, this period is very critical, since it is known to be a dynamic transition from childhood to adulthood. During this time, young people should gradually learn to assume responsibility for their own health, but they often adopt unhealthy behaviors and habits (poor eating habits, little rest, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, and risky sexual behaviors) that can negatively affect health in the short, medium, and long term (12, 13). The university environment can stimulate students to assume risky lifestyles for various reasons: the first time away from families and their rules; personality traits; experience of rebel models or just adult models; and self-challenge. Unconstrained freedommixed with a sense of invulnerability and a strong desire for exploration can lead to the development of behaviors that are not always healthy (14, 15).\nSince there is no effective vaccination against the hepatitis C virus, information and health education represent the best preventive strategy (16). Increasing the level of awareness and knowledge can reduce the risk of transmission and lead to healthier behaviors (17, 18). Other studies have shown that the lack of knowledge and a low level of awareness are also big barriers to HCV screening (19, 20), and the early diagnosis can be the keystone in virus management (21). A group of experts interviewed to discuss relevant aspects and open issues of chronic hepatitis C in Italy and concluded that one of the main barriers to HCV care is the low screening rate (22).\nHealth and screening programmes often lack information regarding the benefits and harms of screening tests and do not favor the decision-making process by individuals (23). In the past, to achieve public health objectives and induce behavioral\nchanges, traditional health communication mostly reported statistics and probabilities; however, recently, new forms of narrative communication are spreading, demonstrating efficacy if properly addressed (24).\nPrevious research examined the framing effect on individual choices in terms of prevention and health treatments, identifying different modalities such as the framing of attributes, objectives, and risky choices (25, 26).\nThe application of a narrative scenario approach has been used in sociology, communication, and marketing research (27, 28) and recently in health psychology as well (29\u201331).\nNarrative scenarios create a simulation of a possible future that can be experienced as a realistic, consistent, and compelling plot, allowing the person to explore a possible reaction (32). According to Campi and Garatti (33), fictionalized scenarios are experiments conceived with a high degree of imagination and realism as they explore, in particular, the human and social dimensions in the setting of everyday life.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the influence of different narrative scenarios on university students\u2019 intentions to undergo diagnostic testing for hepatitis C and to investigate whether gender identification also influences the outcomes."

The verification of the assumptions of univariate normality has been conducted using the procedure for the standardization of the variables, by inspection of a boxplot, and using Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s normality test. The homogeneity of variances was assessed by Levene\u2019s test. To assess the effects between narrative scenario types and gender identification in the scenarios, a three-way repeated measures ANOVA was run with three independent variables (scenario \u00d7 gender identification \u00d7 time) and one dependent variable (intention to carry out a diagnostic test for hepatitis C). As the number of participants was balanced in the groups, in order to determine the interaction between the variables, Pillai\u2019s criterion rather than Wilks\u2019 lambda was used, as it is more robust to unequal covariancematrices (34). Following the study by Cohen (35), partial eta squared was used to assess effect size (0.01 = small, 0.06 = medium, and 0.13 = large). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05, while for\ntesting the multiple univariate interaction effects, a Bonferroni adjustment has been introduced by dividing the declared level of statistical significance by the number of dependent variables: p < 0.025 (i.e., p < 0.05/2)."

Neither the level of education nor the profession of the parents had any influence on the importance attributed to undergoing a diagnostic test for hepatitis C. The assessment of the students\u2019 knowledge on hepatitis C was carried out by summing up the exact answers to the questionnaire. The analysis of the distribution of the answers indicated that out of 19 questions proposed, the average of the correct answers was 12.8 (SD = 2.61, minimum 4 and maximum 17, skewness: \u22120.392, and kurtosis: \u22120.207). About half of the sample (53.3%) showed that they had a low to medium level of general knowledge on hepatitis C.\nComparing the students\u2019 national estimated spread of hepatitis C with their value placed on medical screening, it was found that those who tended to underestimate the incidence of the infection, considering it in \u223c30,000 (M1) or \u223c400,000 (M2) cases estimated in Italy, had significantly lower averages of value attribution to medical checks, while those who indicated the real official estimation of \u223c1,000,000 (M3) in Italy or overestimated the prevalence with more than 6,000,000 (M4) cases, attributed greater value to personal medical checks: F(3,599) = 10.091; p = 0.001; \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.04; OP = 0.98; M1 = 3.43, SD = 0.07; M2 = 3.45, SD = 0.05; M3 = 3.78, SD = 0.05; M4 = 3.85, SD = 0.12; 95% CI [3.55, 3.70].\nA slightly positive correlation was found (r = 0.162\u2217\u2217) between the attribution of value on diagnostic screening and the probability of risk attributed to the category of university students (to which the participants of the study belonged).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "For more than half of the sample in the study, the level of general knowledge about hepatitis C infection was medium to high, with only 9% of the sample providing <10 out of 19 correct answers to the questionnaire administered. This result is similar to what was found in the study by Daniali et al. (16), although in that case, the sample was made up of students from the medical-health area, where a greater average knowledge and awareness of the risks related to such infections was likely to be expected (16). A common result between our study and the one mentioned above was the absence of positive correlation between the level of knowledge and behavioral intention of prevention. The level of knowledge was not associated with\nthe socio-cultural level of belonging, suggesting that there are other sources of information (presumably school, friends, direct, and indirect contact with infected people). In total, 30% of the sample had already undergone a hepatitis C test, and 20.2% had direct knowledge of people with hepatitis C. The importance given to personal diagnostic testing was not directly associated with the level of specific knowledge about the infection but was rather proportionate to the estimated spread of hepatitis C throughout the country. Those who tended to underestimate the spread of infection consequently attached less value to medical monitoring (31, 36).\nHowever, we found an association between the importance attributed to diagnostic screening and the level of risk attributed to the category of university students (to which the participants belonged). These results appear consistent with Kasperson et al. (37).\nWith regard to the effect of the use of narrative scenarios on the propensity for diagnostic screening, it was found that the group presented with the negative scenario reported significantly higher levels of propensity for screening, especially compared to the group with the positive scenario. It was likely that the positive scenario had reassuring effects that limited the participants\u2019 propensity for screening: an early diagnosis was followed by an adequate course of treatment that allowed the protagonist to lead a substantially normal life; while the negative scenario increased the levels of fear: a late diagnosis was followed by a progressive worsening of health conditions and a heavy impact of drugs and their side effects on the protagonist\u2019s quality of life. In the ambivalent scenario, it was probably possible to activate simultaneously different emotional states, such as fear, anger, and resignation. The placement of the level of propensity for screening in an intermediate position with respect to the groups with positive and negative scenarios suggests that the activating effect of fear could have received moderation from any feelings of anger and resignation induced by the representation of such a scenario.\nOn the importance of eliciting emotions through the use of narratives to motivate changes in attitudes, intentions, and behaviors related to health issues, the contribution of Dunlop et al. (38) should certainly be considered. Self-referent emotional responses are expected to have a direct effect in motivating behavior change, particularly as they are likely to be associated with an increase in perceived personal risk. Message-referent and plot-referent emotional responses are proposed to have indirect effects on the individual, primarily by stimulating selfreferent emotions, and prompting interpersonal discussion about the message. Hoeken and Sinkeldam (39) also pointed out that identification with a story character can evoke emotions that subsequently influence the audience\u2019s attitude. In their study, they reported on the mediating role of emotions in narrative persuasion and how identification can evoke these emotions. Liu and Yang (40), in a study using different frames of narrative persuasion to curb e-cigarette use among university students, reported that in a gain-framed narrative, the elicitation of a negative emotion such as anger was associated with an increasing risk perception and decreasing intention to use e-cigarettes. Some recent studies testing the effect of negative emotions such as\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 873566\nfear, anger, and sadness in narrative persuasion interventions for health were conducted by Lillie et al. (41, 42), Jensen et al. (43), and Krakow et al. (44). They demonstrated that story outcome (e.g., whether the main character lives or dies) can impact audience behavior. Death narratives generated greater fear, anger, and sadness. Fear was related to greater behavioral intention and reading flow and diminished counterarguing. Sadness had the opposite effect. Anger produced a mixed persuasive effect, increasing both counterarguing and reading flow.\nIn our study, the positive and ambivalent scenarios, however, suggested that there is a cure and they probably lower the fear of the disease; with regard to the ambivalent scenario, we can hypothesize the stimulation of anger or resignation as the last emotion the person came into contact with, when the information passed on stated that the cure existed but was not available due to economic reasons. The recent study by Scherr et al. (45) showed that anger solicitation in the use of persuasive scenarios lowers the intention to follow the desired directions of the preventive campaign.\nCompared to the research hypothesis, we would have expected that scenarios would play a greater role in stimulating the idea of undergoing diagnostic investigation to facilitate early diagnosis. In this case, we hypothesized that the third-person scenario had a reassuring or defensive role for the participant, since a change of perspective probably occurs by moving from a subjective selfreferencing point of view to an external hetero referent point of view. Indeed, this observation is consistent with the review by De\nGraaf et al. (30), where they state that a first-person perspective is a promising feature in terms of effectiveness. The results of our study showed that, at least in the youth population, even if the level of awareness of the disease is medium-high, the propensity for diagnostic screening is positively associated with the use of a negative scenario, which leverages fear as amotivating emotion (46, 47).\nThe results also showed that in addition to the use of a negative scenario, the presence of a character of the same gender as the participant leads to a more effective outcome in terms of intention to screen. When scenarios do not present a possibility of gender identification, theymay be less effective. The propensity to be more involved with characters, whose gender role is similar to one\u2019s own, has already been reported in several previous studies (48\u201353).\nAs highlighted by Metwally et al. (54), in addition to raising awareness about the disease and risk behavior for hepatitis C infection, communication campaigns should focus on promoting appropriate behavior and changing potentially dangerous practices. Therefore, the main result of our study shows that the use of a communication strategy that employs specific narrative scenarios and exploits the principle of gender identification can increase early diagnostic screening behavior, which especially among young people, given the extended incubation interval of the disease, is of fundamental importance to intervene promptly with pharmacological administration to contain further spread of the virus.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 873566\nA further strength of the study is the awareness-raising intervention for university students with nomedical background. This age group is particularly exposed to experimentation, unruliness, promiscuity, and sometimes superficiality in assessing the medium- and long-term consequences of their actions (55\u201357).\nAnother element that emerged in the study is the presence of stereotyped beliefs or prejudices that lead young learners to believe that risk concerns specific categories and therefore they are convinced that they are not affected by the problem. Effective educational interventions should aim at dismantling such misconceptions and evaluative distortions in order to induce a more cautious and responsible attitude.\nIf we consider the data relating to direct knowledge of at least one infected with hepatitis C, 14.7%, added to the 5.5% of those who declared they knew two or more infected with hepatitis C, it clearly emerges that the infection in question is by no means a marginal occurrence in the current Italian framework, as confirmed by official statistics (7, 58).\nCompared to other countries (59\u201362), Italy does not currently have any specific awareness campaigns on the risk of hepatitis C for university students. Instead, more preventive actions should be promoted through programmes organized in the form of lectures, symposia, conferences, radio programmes, and health talks using all kinds of public platforms and social media, and also through appropriate communication styles that can foster greater interpersonal responsiveness and empathic involvement\n(63\u201367). Several studies show that health promotion actions in university settings through active involvement methodologies can produce significant effects in terms of prevention and behavioral change (68\u201373).\nThe work should of course be seen in the light of some limitations. One aspect to note is the use of paper-based text scenarios and therefore the failure to evaluate the possibility of using multimedia and digital tools from which young people can be more stimulated. A further limitation was the direct administration of the tools without an articulated discussion of the problems of infection and without having planned group involvement activities through possible peer education actions. Another aspect to be noted is the lack in the experimental design of an efficacy comparison on the intention of diagnostic screening between narrative scenarios with an identification option and a control group that used simple popular and informative material on hepatitis infection.\nA future study, which could overcome the above-mentioned limitations, i.e., measuring also the effectiveness of the use of digital tools, including in the protocol a final discussion in the groups in order to collect with qualitative methods a more in-depth feedback on the solicitations perceived during the intervention and to evaluate more carefully the possible changes of attitude and behavioral intentions, adding also a control group in the intervention design, could contribute to a further advancement in the knowledge of the most effective factors and characteristics to be used in the health narrative persuasion. A\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 873566\nfurther line of research could investigate the relationship between frequency of pro-health behaviors in university students and the temporal perspective, since in recent literature there seems to be converging evidence in support of this hypothesis (74\u201377).\nHowever, we believe that the results of this study, related to hepatitis C prevention, can help policymakers develop communication campaigns aimed at raising awareness and promoting screening according to specific populations, as also suggested by the WHO in the document \u201cGlobal Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis, 2016\u20132021\u201d (17). Bettertargeted interventions aimed at enhancing HCV disease risk awareness may ultimately help reduce barriers and increase HCV screening uptake."
