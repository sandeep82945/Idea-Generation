A practical development protocol for evidence-based digital integrative arts therapy content in public mental health services: digital transformation of mandala art therapy 1. conclusions This study was conducted to lay the groundwork for digital transformation in the field of art therapy for the public mental health services and to explore its possibilities. A practicable protocol for the development of evidence-based digital integrative arts therapy was presented, which converted

the traditional structured mandala coloring technique into a mobile app called “Digital Mandala”. The study findings have been summarized below. First, digital transformation requires structuring. Digital content for integrative arts therapy can be structured based on the “session operating structure” theory (25). The clinical system of arts therapy comprises the composition method of a comprehensive whole session (clinical period, goal, activity, and evaluation method) and the progress method of a respective single session (progress structure, runtime, and clinical environment). Second, evidence-based digital content can be developed through five stages of the virtuous cycle development process that include preliminary research, design, development, commercialization, and advancement. Third, the main features of the evidence-based digital content include “clinical evidence”, “arts therapy features”, and “data factors”, which might serve as criteria for content production and evaluation. There is a need to collect evidence that explains the effects of the existing method and the detailed scene-specific components of digital content. It is important to provide a specific justification for the composition of the content and to clarify the significance embedded within each element. Fourth, the fundamentals of digital transformation include the conversion of the traditional operation method into a digital format to develop a standardized system that collects, analyzes, and processes quantitative data. Digital conversion through data factor extraction enables the quantitative verification of the effectiveness of arts therapy and can serve as an evaluation criterion for the evidence-based digital content. Consequently, the Digital Mandala implemented based on this research has been provided as an integrating arts therapy content that encourages creative selfexpression and the healing process among participants in order to prevent and manage depressive symptoms. This content is valuable as a digital service that stimulates multi-sensory and provides expression and appreciation by utilizing various media such as art, music, and literature. The significance of this study is that it provides a development protocol for data-based customized services through the Digital Mandala, which digitally converts the existing experiential approach of art therapy into digital content. Additionally, it presents the possibility of verifying the effectiveness of art therapy in the future by deriving data factors and digitally implementing the mandala technique. The data collected through the Digital Mandala can be used to expand the range of traditional arts therapies that have lacked quantitative or scientific effectiveness verification in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). If it is evaluated quantitatively using data elements, it will not only function as digital wellness content but also as digital therapeutics. Through this study, it is expected that the specific utilization and spread of digital and arts convergence content as public mental health services will be achieved.
