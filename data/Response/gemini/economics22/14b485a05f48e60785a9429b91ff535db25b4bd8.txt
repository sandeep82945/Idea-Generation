1. **Investigate the impact of different subsidy mechanisms on the green developer's pricing strategy and profits.** The paper considers three types of government subsidies: subsidies to consumers, subsidies for green costs of the developer, and subsidies for basic costs of the developer. Future research could explore other subsidy mechanisms, such as tax credits or rebates, and examine how these different mechanisms affect the green developer's pricing strategy and profits.


2. **Analyze the impact of government subsidies on the market share of green housing in different market structures.** The paper assumes a duopoly market structure, with one green developer and one traditional developer. Future research could investigate how government subsidies affect the market share of green housing in different market structures, such as a monopoly, oligopoly, or perfect competition.


3. **Examine the impact of government subsidies on the carbon emission reduction in green housing in different regulatory environments.** The paper assumes that the government sets a mandatory green standard for the green developer. Future research could investigate how government subsidies affect the carbon emission reduction in green housing in different regulatory environments, such as a voluntary green standard or a carbon tax.


4. **Study the impact of government subsidies on the green developer's investment in green technology.** The paper assumes that the green developer has a fixed green incremental cost. Future research could investigate how government subsidies affect the green developer's investment in green technology, such as research and development or the adoption of new green technologies.


5. **Explore the impact of government subsidies on the overall welfare of society.** The paper focuses on the impact of government subsidies on the green developer's profits and the carbon emission reduction in green housing. Future research could investigate how government subsidies affect the overall welfare of society, taking into account factors such as consumer surplus, producer surplus, and environmental externalities.
