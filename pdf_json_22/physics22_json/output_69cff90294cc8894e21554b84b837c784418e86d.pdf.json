    "abstractText": "We consider an extension of the Standard Model that accounts for the muon g \u2212 2 tension and neutrino masses and study in detail dark matter phenomenology. The model under consideration includes a WIMP and a FIMP scalar dark matter candidates and thus gives rise to two-component dark matter scenarios. We discuss different regimes and mechanisms of production, including the novel freeze-in semi-production, and show that the WIMP and FIMP together compose the observed relic density today. The presence of the extra scalar fields allows phase transitions of the first order. We examine the evolution of the vacuum state and discuss stochastic gravitational wave signals associated with the first-order phase transition. We show that the gravitational wave signals may be probed by future gravitational wave experiments which may serve as a complementary detection signal.",

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics proved to be very precise in describing the nature of the physical world. However, some of its problems were highlighted and studied in the past decades, including the neutrino masses, the existence of dark matter (DM), and the muon g \u2212 2 tension. In the SM, neutrinos are massless. However, the evidence of neutrino oscillations indicates otherwise [1, 2]. The mass splitting from neutrino oscillation experiments is constrained to be |\u2206m221| = 7.42+0.21\u22120.20 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 between the first and the second mass eigenstates, while it is \u2206m232 = 2.517+0.026\u22120.028 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 for the second and the third [3]. Moreover, from cosmological data, we also have a bound on the sum of their masses \u2211 im\u03bdi < 0.3 eV [4]. The recent data coming from Fermilab [5] increased the tension between the SM theoretical prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the g \u2212 2 factor, and the experimental data. At the moment there is a 4.2\u03c3 discrepancy,\n\u2206a\u00b5 = aexp\u00b5 \u2212 aSM\u00b5 = (2.51\u00b1 0.59)\u00d7 10\u22129 , (1.1)\nsuggesting the presence of new physics at a scale of hundreds of GeV.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFinally, the SM fails to accommodate one or more particles that may play the role of the DM. Ever since the proposal by Zwicky for a dark, collision-less, and matter-like component of the energy budget of the universe [6, 7], evidences from different sources for a cold, particle-like DM have cumulated [8\u201310]. The most promising and studied solution to this problem is the Weekly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) [11\u201314]. The WIMP DM is, however, strongly constrained by experimental data [15\u201320]. Thus, more attention has been drawn to alternative DM production mechanisms. For example, the freeze-in mechanism has gained increasing interest [21\u201335]. The abundance of a WIMP DM is produced through the freeze-out mechanism, which is a thermal process, and it is generally inversely proportional to the thermal cross section. Instead, the DM produced via the freeze-in mechanism, called Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP), is out of equilibrium with respect to the thermal bath of the SM particles. A small coupling between the visible sector and the DM is predicted, making this candidate more difficult to detect and to constrain with direct detection experiments.1 Nonetheless, both freeze-out and freeze-in production mechanisms are physically viable and not mutually exclusive. It is thus worth exploring the possibility of multi-component DM scenarios, where both the WIMP and FIMP DM contribute to the current relic density \u2126DMh2 = 0.120\u00b1 0.001 observed by the Planck experiment [9]. Recent studies on multi-component DM scenarios include refs. [42\u201372].\nIn this paper, we consider an extension of the SM and explain the aforementioned three problems of the SM in a single unified framework. A novel set-up is proposed where we introduce three massive right-handed (RH) neutrinos NR that, through the standard type-I seesaw mechanism [73, 74], provide a mass to the SM neutrinos. The SM is then also extended with two SM-singlet scalar fields \u03c61 and \u03c62 that play the role of the WIMP-like DM and FIMP-like DM, respectively. Finally, we introduce an extra U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 gauge symmetry with a related gauge boson Z\u00b5\u03c4 which receives its mass from a second Higgs field \u03c6H . The presence of a new massive gauge boson, with the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of \u03c6H around hundreds of GeV can solve the g \u2212 2 tension [75\u201382]. Appropriately assigning U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 charges for the DM particles, we also address a novel production mechanism, namely the freeze-in mechanism by semi-production processes [83, 84] like \u03c61\u03c62 \u2194 \u03c62\u03c62, that is the inverse of the semi-annihilation process [85]. This mechanism produces an exponentially increasing DM yield, and it typically requires a larger coupling than the standard freeze-in scenarios do, since the DM abundance is also suppressed by the small initial abundance which is generically required for the freeze-in production mechanism.\nThe evolution of the vacuum state of the scalar potential becomes non-trivial due to the three extra scalar fields. First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) may thus arise, producing stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signals [86] detectable by future GW experiments such as LISA [87] which is a space-based detector comprising of three spacecraft, utilising laser interferometry, DECIGO [88\u201392] which is a proposed GW antenna in space designed to observe GWs in the 0.1\u201310 Hz frequency range, consisting of four clusters of LISA-like three spacecraft, and BBO [93\u201395] which is a proposed follow-up of the LISA experiment,\n1In refs. [36\u201338], it was pointed out that such a small coupling can naturally arise in a clockwork framework [39\u201341].\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\naiming to form a triangular shape consisting of four LISA-like detectors, similar to the DECIGO. For recent studies on this subject, see, e.g., refs. [96\u2013113]. This possibility gives a complementary detection signal to the standard (in-)direct detection and collider searches that potentially can probe our model and unveil the nature of the DM. We present a region of the model parameter space that produces detectable GW signals from a FOPT, relieves the muon g \u2212 2 tension, gives masses to the SM neutrinos, and explains the correct DM abundance by a two-component WIMP-FIMP relic density. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. We set up our model in section 2, introducing the particle content, the gauge groups, and the mass spectrum of the theory. We also present the standard type-I seesaw mechanism adopted to explain the neutrino masses, and we give a brief explanation of the muon g \u2212 2 tension. In section 3, we discuss possible DM scenarios. We divide the parameter space into three regimes and study both one-component and two-component scenarios. In section 4, the FOPT and its associated GWs are studied. We showcase four benchmark points that explain the muon g\u22122, neutrino masses, and correct DM relic density. The benchmark points predict GW signals within the detectability of future GW experiments, in particular Ultimate-DECIGO, which is an ultimate, idealised version of the DECIGO, whose sensitivity is only limited by quantum noises. We conclude in section 5."

Finally, the kinetic term for the extra gauge boson Z\u00b5\u03c4 is given by the last term in eq. (2.1) with its field strength tensor F\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03c4 = \u2202\u03b1Z\u03b2\u00b5\u03c4 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2Z\u03b1\u00b5\u03c4 .\nIn general, the Lagrangian (2.1) may include the gauge kinetic mixing term [114],\nL \u2283 \u03b62F \u03b1\u03b2 \u00b5\u03c4 F\u03b1\u03b2 , (2.6)\nbetween the U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 gauge boson and the SM U(1)Y gauge boson whose field-strength tensor is denoted by F\u03b1\u03b2. In the presence of the gauge kinetic mixing term, one may work with the physical gauge boson states instead of the original gauge boson states by diagonalising the mass matrix of the gauge bosons [115]. Furthermore, as we shall see shortly, the DM phenomenology as well as the FOPT-associated GWs are qualitatively indifferent to the gauge kinetic mixing term. Therefore, since the kinetic mixing term does not play an important role in our discussion, we assume, for simplicity, that \u03b6 1 in this work.2 The presence of the interaction term between \u03c6h and \u03c6H in eq. (2.5) introduces a mass mixing. In unitary gauge, the Higgs fields \u03c6h and \u03c6H after the spontaneous breaking of SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y \u00d7U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 gauge symmetry may be expressed as\n\u03c6h = ( 0 v+H\u221a\n2\n) and \u03c6H = ( v\u00b5\u03c4+H\u00b5\u03c4\u221a\n2\n) , (2.7)\nwhere v and v\u00b5\u03c4 are the VEVs of the Higgs fields \u03c6h and \u03c6H , respectively. The scalar mass matrix is then given by\nM2scalar = (\n2\u03bbhv2 \u03bbhHv\u00b5\u03c4v \u03bbhHv\u00b5\u03c4v 2\u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4\n) . (2.8)\nIn the presence of the Higgs-portal coupling \u03bbhH , the physical states are obtained after diagonalising the matrixM2scalar. The mass eigenstates h1 and h2 can be written as\nh1 = H cos \u03b8 +H\u00b5\u03c4 sin \u03b8 , h2 = \u2212H sin \u03b8 +H\u00b5\u03c4 cos \u03b8 . (2.9)\nThe mixing angle \u03b8 and the mass eigenvalues M2h1 and M 2 h2 are given by\ntan 2\u03b8 = \u03bbhHv\u00b5\u03c4v \u03bbhv2 \u2212 \u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4 , (2.10)\nM2h1 = \u03bbhv 2 + \u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4 \u2212 \u221a (\u03bbhv2 \u2212 \u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4 )2 + (\u03bbhHvv\u00b5\u03c4 )2 , (2.11)\nM2h2 = \u03bbhv 2 + \u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4 + \u221a (\u03bbhv2 \u2212 \u03bbHv2\u00b5\u03c4 )2 + (\u03bbhHvv\u00b5\u03c4 )2 . (2.12)\nWe identify the lighter scalar field h1 with the observed SM Higgs field. 2In refs. [116, 117], it was shown that small values of the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b6 are favoured from the muon g\u2212 2 aspect when taking into account the experimental constraint of Borexino [118, 119].

As the model contains two scalar DM candidates, we may have a single-component or two-component DM scenario depending on the mass range of the WIMP and FIMP DM particles. We first discuss the production of DM when the \u00b5 term in eq. (2.4) is dominant and the other quartic terms associated with the DM are also significant. We also look at the scenario when the \u00b5 parameter is less significant and quartic terms are the ones which take part in the DM productions. In regime I and regime II, we study the effect of the \u00b5 term on the production of DM. In these cases, depending on the mass range of the WIMP DM, we obtain both the single-component and two-component DM scenarios. In regime III, we study DM productions when the \u00b5 term is small and the quartic terms are relevant. In this regime, we have a two-component DM scenario where one component is WIMP-type DM and another component is FIMP-type DM. In studying DM phenomenology, we have implemented our model in FeynRules [132] and generated the CalcHEP files [133]. We have then used micrOMEGAs [134] to solve the coupled Boltzmann equations relevant for our study. Some useful analytical expressions are derived and summarised in appendix A. We discuss the different regimes in detail below.\n3.1 Regime I (Mh2 < 2M2 and M1 > 3M2)\nAs the WIMP DM mass is larger than three times the mass of the FIMP DM, a three-body decay channel from the WIMP DM to the FIMP DM is open in this regime. Since the WIMP DM decays into the FIMP DM, this regime gives us a single-component DM scenario, unless the lifetime is larger than the age of the Universe. It would require extremely small couplings to make the lifetime larger than the age of the Universe, and we do not consider such a scenario. Additionally, we assume that the SM and BSM Higgs masses are such that the decay production of the FIMP DM is kinematically forbidden. Nevertheless, a freeze-in contribution through annihilation processes, AB \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62, where A and B are the SM particles, will be there.

The model parameters are chosen as follows: M1 = 1650GeV, M2 = 500GeV, Mh2 = 500GeV, MZ\u00b5\u03c4 = 0.1GeV, g\u00b5\u03c4 = 9 \u00d7 10\u22124, \u03bb2i = 6 \u00d7 10\u221212 (i = h,H), \u03bb12 = 6 \u00d7 10\u221212, \u03bb1i = 0.5 (i = h,H), and \u00b5 = 7.5\u00d7 10\u221211. The magenta dot-dashed line corresponds to the correct value of DM relic density.\nwhere MPl = 1.22\u00d7 1019 GeV is the Planck mass, and g\u2217(x) and gs(x) are the effective and entropic degrees of freedom of the Universe. Here, Y1,2 \u2261 n\u03c61,2/S are the yields, with n\u03c61,2 being the number densities and S the entropy density. The first equation corresponds to the evolution of the WIMP DM and the second equation represents the production of the FIMP DM. In the right hand side of the first equation, the first term is the annihilation of the WIMP DM to the SM particles. Here, \u3008\u03c3v\u3009th is the thermal average of cross section times velocity of DM annihilating to the SM particles. The second term implies the three-body decay of the WIMP DM to the FIMP DM, where \u3008\u0393\u3009 is the thermal average of the decay rate \u0393, defined as \u3008\u0393\u3009 = \u0393K1(x)/K2(x) with K1,2 being the modified Bessel functions of the second kind. The analytical expression for the three-body decay is provided in appendix A; see eq. (A.8). Similarly, the first term in the right hand side of the second equation represents the annihilation contribution to the FIMP DM and the second term is the decay contribution of the WIMP DM to the FIMP DM. Here, \u3008\u03c3v\u3009ij is the thermal average of annihilations of i, j particles to FIMP DM. Due to the allowed decay term of the WIMP to the FIMP, we see that the WIMP DM eventually decays to the FIMP DM before big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We still do not have any contribution to visible energy even when the WIMP DM decays after BBN, and thus, our model remains safe from the constraints which come from light elements abundances [135].\nIn figure 2, we show the evolution of the DM relic density in terms of x = M1/T . We examine the contributions of different production mechanisms. The blue dot-dashed line in figure 2 corresponds to the production of the FIMP DM through annihilation processes\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 3. Evolutions of DM relic density for three different values of the WIMP DM mass M1 (left) and for three different values of the FIMP DM mass M2 (right). For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 2.\nwhich saturate at x ' 1. The dominating processes in the annihilation contribution are the four-point contact terms which are AB \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62 (A,B = h1,2, \u03c61) and are not propagatorsuppressed. The green double-dot-dashed line represents the evolution of the WIMP DM which freezes out at x ' 20 and starts to decay into the FIMP DM at x ' 105. Since the WIMP DM decays into the FIMP DM, this regime corresponds to a single-component DM scenario. The red dashed line is the freeze-in production from the three-body decay of the WIMP DM i.e. \u03c61 \u2192 \u03c62\u03c62\u03c62 that happens at x ' 1 which means that the WIMP DM is in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic soup. Moreover, there is also another contribution that is superWIMP (SW) contribution appears at x ' 105 [136]. It comes from the three-body decay of the WIMP DM. Finally, the black solid line corresponds to the total DM relic density which comes after summing all the contributions. The magenta dot-dashed line corresponds to the correct value of the DM relic density. We see that, for the choice of model parameters outlined in the caption of figure 2, our model correctly produces the exact amount of DM relic density.\nChanges in the DM relic density with respect to the masses of the WIMP DM and FIMP DM are shown respectively in the left panel and the right panel of figure 3. The freeze-in production of the FIMP DM due to the annihilation is insensitive to the WIMP DM mass. This is consistent with the observation that there is no direct effect of the WIMP DM mass on the annihilation production of the FIMP DM apart from the annihilation process \u03c6\u20201\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2020 2\u03c62 which has negligible dependence on the WIMP DM mass. The freeze-in production from the decay of the WIMP DM when it is in thermal equilibrium, i.e., x . 20, is in general inversely proportional to the WIMP DM mass in this regime. However, we observe the opposite behaviour, i.e., we get more production as the WIMP DM mass increases. This is due to the fact that, for a low value of the WIMP DM mass,\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nM1 = 1650GeV, we have a phase-space suppression in the decay. Thus, we get less amount of the FIMP DM, and when we increase the WIMP DM mass, the effect of phase space gets reduced, and we obtain more DM from decay. The WIMP DM freezes out at x ' 20 and starts to decay into the FIMP DM at x ' 105. We see that the WIMP DM starts to decay into the FIMP DM earlier as the WIMP DM mass increases as the double-dot-dashed lines in figure 3 indicate. This is because the decay width is linearly proportional to the WIMP DM mass. On top of that, there is also the phase-space suppression which further reduces the decay width and delays the WIMP decay. When the decay of the WIMP DM happens, we see a rise in the production of the FIMP DM at x ' 105 which is similar to the superWIMP production mechanism. In the right panel of figure 3, we show the dependence on the FIMP DM mass. For the FIMP production due to the annihilation which is represented by the dot-dashed lines, we see a slight variation in the relic density. This is because h2h2 \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62 is the dominant process, and we have taken the BSM Higgs mass to be Mh2 = 500GeV which is comparable to the FIMP DM mass. Therefore, suppression due to the phase-space factor and increment due to mass compensate each other. The FIMP DM production due to the three-body decay is shown by the dashed lines. We observe one order of magnitude difference in the DM production when we vary the FIMP DM mass from 500GeV to 400GeV. This happens purely because the effect of phase space is small, and the same effect continues when we decrease the FIMP DM mass further. Finally, let us discuss the production of the WIMP DM which decays into the FIMP DM at x ' 105. Again, we see that, as the FIMP DM mass decreases from 500GeV to 400GeV, WIMP decay width increases due to lower phase-space suppression which indicates that the WIMP decays earlier. This is visible by the double-dot-dashed lines. When the WIMP DM decay happens, we have further production of the FIMP DM similar to the superWIMP production. In both the left and right panels of figure 3, solid lines represent the total DM relic density after summing all the production contributions. The left and right panels of figure 4, shows the dependence of DM relic density for three different values of the \u00b5 and \u03bb12 parameters, respectively. In the left panel, from the freeze-in contribution through annihilation, we see that there is no change in the relic density coming from the annihilation contribution which is represented by the dot-dashed line. This is because the annihilation process associated with the \u00b5 term is proportional to Y eq1 Y2 (Y2 = 0 at initial value of x), while other annihilation terms are proportional to Y eqA Y eq B (A,B are the annihilating particles). Let us turn to the production of the FIMP DM from the three-body decay of the WIMP DM. The production of the FIMP DM before x ' 10 occurs in the domain when the WIMP DM is still in thermal equilibrium, and from its decay, the FIMP DM is produced. We clearly see that the production has a quadratic dependence on the \u00b5 parameter which is perfectly consistent with the analytical expression given in the appendix A; see eq. (A.8). We note that the freeze-out temperature of the WIMP DM does not depend on the \u00b5 parameter while the WIMP DM decay does. Decay of the WIMP happens earlier (later) for a higher (lower) value of \u00b5. This is consistent with the analytical expression; see appendix A for details. Depending on the decay occurrence, the superWIMP contribution to the FIMP DM happens earlier or later and has an equal\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 4. Dependence of the DM relic density on the \u00b5 (left) and \u03bb12 (right) parameters. For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 2.\ncontribution for all three values, as the freeze-out contributions do not depend on the \u00b5 parameter, and this contribution is equal to \u21262DMh2 = \u21261DMh2(M2/M1). From the right panel of figure 4, one may clearly see that the three-body decay and the superWIMP production do not depend on \u03bb12. However, we see changes in the production coming from the annihilation process, \u03c6\u20201\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2020 2\u03c62. In both the left and right panels of figure 4, the solid lines correspond to the total contribution in DM relic density. Finally, the dependence of the DM relic density on the quartic couplings of the DM with\nthe Higgses, \u03bbij (i = 1, 2 and j = h,H), is shown in figure 5. From the left panel, we see that the production of the FIMP DM from the freeze-in by the three-body decay and annihilation does not change; see the red dashed and dot-dashed lines. We can also see that there is a significant change in the final value when we consider the freeze-out production of the WIMP DM. This can be explained in a very simple way. The WIMP relic density is determined from the inverse of thermal average of cross section times velocity, namely \u21261DMh2 \u221d 1/\u03bb21i (i = h,H). Therefore, larger values of \u03bb1j (j = h,H) imply that we face the situation when most of the particles annihilate away, and thus, we have less abundance for WIMP. The relative strength of the WIMP DM relic density due to different values of quartic couplings is given by \u21261DMh2|A/\u21261DMh2|B = \u03bb21i|B/\u03bb21i|A (i = h,H). This is consistent with our numerical results as one may see from the blue, red, and green lines for the freeze-out production of the WIMP DM. Since there is no variation of the FIMP DM production from the three-body decay and annihilation, most of the changes in the FIMP DM production comes after x ' 105 when the WIMP DM decays into the FIMP DM. Solid lines correspond to the total contribution after taking into account all the production mechanisms.\nOn the other hand, from the right panel of figure 5, we see that the FIMP DM production from the three-body decay of the WIMP when the WIMP is in thermal equilibrium does not change as the quartic couplings vary. We can also see that the freeze-out production\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 5. Dependence of the DM relic density on the quartic coupling of the WIMP with the Higgses \u03bb1i (i = h,H) (left) and the quartic coupling of the FIMP with Higgses \u03bb2i (i = h,H) (right). For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 2.\nof the WIMP DM shown by the double-dot-dashed line is not affected by the change of the quartic couplings. However, the FIMP production from annihilation changes. This is indeed consistent with the observation that the freeze-in contribution by annihilation processes is proportional to the quartic couplings. In this case, the production is directly proportional to the quartic coupling which is visible by the dot-dashed lines; see eqs. (A.15) and (A.16) in appendix A.\n3.2 Regime II (Mh2 < 2M2 and M1 < 3M2)\nWhen the WIMP DM mass is less than the three times the FIMP DM mass, the three-body decay channel of the WIMP DM to the FIMP DM is kinematically forbidden. Therefore, in this case, we have a two-component DM scenario, one WIMP-type DM and one FIMP-type DM.\nThe WIMP DM freezes out at x ' 20, and we obtain relic density in the experimentally allowed range put by Planck [9] near the Higgs resonance region. For the FIMP DM, we examine the effect of the \u00b5 term on the FIMP DM production and choose the FIMP DMmass in such a way that the decay channel h2 \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62 is kinematically forbidden. Nevertheless, we have an annihilation contribution in the production of the FIMP DM through the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the presence of the \u00b5 term, there exists \u03c61\u03c62 \u2192 \u03c62\u03c62 annihilation process, and it will exhibits an exponential growth. In the production of the FIMP, at x ' 0.01, we have a tiny amount of FIMP DM produced from the annihilation processes of the SM particles, and at x ' 1, the exponential enhancement will take place which will be discussed in detail below.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 6. Evolution of the DM relic density in regime II. In this regime, we have a two-component DM scenario with one WIMP DM and one FIMP DM. The evolution of the WIMP DM is shown in the green double-dot-dashed line, while the freeze-in productions of FIMP DM through annihilation and exponential growth are shown in the blue dot-dashed line and red dashed line, respectively. The black solid line corresponds to the sum of the WIMP and FIMP DM relic densities, and the magenta dot-dashed line indicates the observed value of DM relic density. The model parameters are chosen as M1 = 500GeV, M2 = 700GeV, Mh2 = 1000GeV, \u03bb2i = 6\u00d7 10\u221212 (i = h,H), \u03bb12 = 6\u00d7 10\u221212, \u03bb1h = 0.05, \u03bb1H = 0.125, and \u00b5 = 10\u22126.\nThe governing Boltzmann equations in this regime are given by dY1 dx = \u22122\u03c0 2 45 MPlM1 1.66x2 \u221a g\u2217\u3008\u03c3v\u3009th ( Y 21 \u2212 Y eq2 1 ) ,\ndY2 dx\n= \u22122\u03c0 2\n45 MPlM1 1.66x2 \u221a g\u2217\u3008\u03c3v\u3009exp\n( Y 22 \u2212 Y eq 1 Y2 ) + 4\u03c0 2\n45 MPlM1 1.66x2 \u221a g\u2217 \u2211 i,j\u2208SM,\u03c61 \u3008\u03c3v\u3009ij ( Y eqi Y eq j \u2212 Y 2 2 ) . (3.2)\nThe first (second) equation represents the evolution of the WIMP (FIMP) DM. Here, \u3008\u03c3v\u3009exp is the thermal average associated with the exponential growth computed using the prescription described in appendix A.1.1. We now discuss the effect of model parameters on the production of WIMP and FIMP DM by different mechanisms. In figure 6, the evolution of the WIMP and FIMP DM relic densities is shown. The model parameters are chosen in such a way that the WIMP and FIMP DM relic densities contribute equally and generate a total DM relic density in the correct ballpark value as referred by the Planck collaboration [9]. The red dashed line in figure 6 corresponds to the exponential growth of FIMP DM due to the presence of the process \u03c61\u03c62 \u2192 \u03c62\u03c62. This kind of process can be solved analytically. The co-moving number density can be expressed as\nY2 = Y ini2 e \u222b\u221e xini 2\u03c02 45 MPlM1 1.66x2 \u221a g\u2217\u3008\u03c3v\u3009Y eq1 dx , (3.3)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 7. Dependence of the DM relic density on the WIMP DM mass M1 (left) and FIMP DM mass M2 (right). For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 6.\nwhere Y ini2 = Y2(x = xini). Thus, we see an exponential enhancement of the FIMP DM. The blue dot-dashed line represents the FIMP DM production through the annihilation processes AB \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62 where A and B are the particles in thermal equilibrium. The green double-dotdashed line indicates the WIMP DM production through the freeze-out mechanism which happens at x ' 20. The total sum of the WIMP and FIMP DM contributions is depicted by the black solid line which matches with the correct value of DM relic density \u2126DMh2 = 0.12.\nFigure 7 shows the dependence of DM relic density on the WIMP and FIMP DM masses. In the left panel, we see that the WIMP DM mass has no observable effect on the freeze-in production of FIMP DM through annihilation. However, the WIMP DM mass affects the exponential growth of FIMP DM as the thermal average of cross section times velocity is inversely proportional to mass of the initial state particle, which is the WIMP DM in the present case. In the case of the WIMP DM production, when we increase or decrease the WIMP DM mass around M1 = 500GeV, we get more abundance for the WIMP DM. This is understood from the resonance behaviour of the Higgs-mediated diagram. In figure 7, we have considered Mh2 = 1000GeV which is the resonance region for M1 = 500GeV DM. Thus, we get a large annihilation cross section which results in the reduction in WIMP abundance. If the WIMP DM mass deviates from 500GeV, we get a smaller value of annihilation cross section and higher WIMP DM abundance. The solid lines correspond to the total contribution in DM relic density both from the WIMP and FIMP contributions.\nIn the right panel of figure 7, we may observe the effect of FIMP DM mass on the production of WIMP and FIMP DM by different mechanisms. The FIMP DM mass has little impact on the FIMP DM production through annihilation, while it has an observable effect on the exponentially enhanced production of FIMP DM. For x . 1, we see that the change in the FIMP DM relic density is proportional to the FIMP DM mass. On the other hand, for x & 1, we get a similar kind of enhancement as discussed in the previous\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 8. Dependence of the DM relic density on the \u00b5 parameter (left) and the quartic coupling \u03bb12 between the WIMP DM and FIMP DM (right). For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 6.\nparagraph, due to the dependence of the thermal average of the cross section on mass. As the chosen masses are in a large range, we see no big difference in the produced relic densities like before. There is also no effect of the FIMP DM mass on the production of WIMP DM through the freeze-out process. The solid lines are the total sum of WIMP and FIMP DM relic densities, and they all match the correct value of the DM relic density given by Planck.\nThe dependences of the production of WIMP and FIMP DM on the \u00b5 parameter and the quartic coupling between the WIMP DM and FIMP DM \u03bb12 are respectively shown in the left and right panels of figure 8. The \u00b5 parameter only affects the process \u03c61\u03c62 \u2192 \u03c62\u03c62, and thus, other DM productions do not change. Looking at the freeze-in production of FIMP DM from annihilation and WIMP DM production through the freeze-out process, we easily see that these production mechanisms do not vary when \u00b5 changes. However, we can see a strong dependence of the exponential enhancement on the \u00b5 parameter. If we take \u00b5 . 10\u22127, then the exponential enhancement is absent, while for \u00b5 & 5 \u00d7 10\u22126, there exists a tremendous exponential enhancement in the production which overproduces the DM. Thus, higher values of \u00b5 are disfavoured. The solid lines are again the total sum of WIMP and FIMP contributions, and the variation in their values are solely due to the effect of the exponential enhancement.\nOn the other hand, since the quartic coupling \u03bb12 is in the feeble regime, it does not contribute to the WIMP DM production which is clearly visible by the double-dot-dashed line which is same for all the three values of \u03bb12. The dashed line, which accounts for the FIMP DM production through the exponential enhancement, is also unchanged for different values of \u03bb12. However, the freeze-in contribution through annihilation depends on the \u03bb12 parameter as the dot-dashed lines indicate. The amount of DM production through annihilation depends quadratically on the \u03bb12 parameter.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 9. Dependence of the DM relic density on the quartic coupling between the WIMP DM and the SM Higgs (left) and the quartic coupling between the WIMP DM and the BSM Higgs (right). For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 6.\nThe left panel and the right panel of figure 9 show the dependence of the DM relic density on the quartic coupling between the WIMP DM and the SM Higgs \u03bb1h and the quartic coupling between the WIMP DM and the BSM Higgs \u03bb1H , respectively. The coupling \u03bb1h connects the WIMP DM to the visible sector through the SM Higgs. Since this quartic coupling does not affect the exponential growth of the FIMP DM and has a negligible effect on the FIMP DM through annihilation, there is no change in the FIMP DM production for different values of \u03bb1h. We can see, however, changes in the WIMP DM production, although the difference is small. The small dependence on \u03bb1h is due to the fact that the WIMP DM mass is chosen in such a way that it lies in the BSM Higgs resonance regime. Moreover, we have kept \u03bb1h below 0.1. Otherwise, the WIMP DM will be ruled out by the direct detection experiments.\nThe right panel of figure 9 indicates that the quartic coupling \u03bb1H has no effect on the FIMP DM production as well. However, we see that a change in \u03bb1H results in an order of magnitude variation in the WIMP DM relic density. This is because our parameters are chosen such that the WIMP mass is in the resonance region for the second, BSM Higgs, M1 'Mh2/2. Therefore, a change in \u03bb1H which measures the coupling strength for \u03c6 \u2020 1\u03c61h 2 2 has a direct impact on the thermal DM relic density. The left panel of figure 10 shows the dependence of the DM relic density on the quartic coupling between the FIMP DM and the SM and BSM Higgses \u03bb2i (i = h,H). Since \u03bb2h and \u03bb2H are associated with the FIMP DM, it does not affect the WIMP DM production as one may easily see from the figure. The quartic coupling \u03bb2i (i = h,H) also does not alter the FIMP DM production by the exponential enhancement. On the other hand, we see that the FIMP production by annihilation gets affected due to the variation of \u03bb2h and \u03bb2H . This is because the associated annihilation processes AB \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62, where A and B\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 10.

For the rest of the model parameters, see figure 6.\nbelong to the SM and BSM particles, directly depend on the strength of the \u03bb2h and \u03bb2H couplings. The changes in the solid line, which is the total sum of both the FIMP and WIMP contributions, are due to the variation in FIMP DM relic density coming from the annihilation part. The right panel of figure 10 shows the dependence of the DM relic density on the BSM Higgs mass Mh2 . Since in this regime, the decay process h2 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2020 2\u03c62 is not allowed, we do\nnot see any observable effect on the FIMP DM production. However, we see an effect on the production of WIMP DM. The reason is exactly the same as the one we discussed earlier for the left panel of figure 7. Here as well, since M1 = 500GeV, if Mh2 deviates from Mh2 = 1000GeV, we are basically going away from the resonance region. This means that DM freezes out earlier due to the reduction in the thermal cross section, and we get higher WIMP DM relic density. The changes in the solid line are purely due to variation in the WIMP contribution to the DM relic density.\n3.3 Regime III (Mh2 > 2M2 with \u00b5 negligible)\nIn this regime, one should take into account the FIMP DM production from the decay of the Higgses as well. Throughout the discussion, we assume that \u00b5 is negligible and focus on two-component DM scenarios. Since \u00b5 is negligible, we may neglect the exponential enhancement in the FIMP DM production. We note that this scenario is different from the individual study of WIMP [121, 137, 138] and FIMP [122] as the FIMP DM can also be produced from the annihilation of the WIMP DM through the process \u03c6\u20201\u03c61 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2020 2\u03c62. This annihilation contribution can be increased or decreased with the strength of the \u03bb12 parameter as discussed in the right panel of figure 8 and can produce the FIMP DM with the correct DM relic density. Therefore, our study on the two-component DM scenario in\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 11.

We stress that, when the sum of the WIMP and FIMP DM relic densities is smaller than \u2126DMh2 = 0.12, the rest of the amount can easily be obtained by suitably adjusting the \u00b5 parameter which we neglect at the moment. The allowed parameter regions in the M2\u2013\u03bb2h and M2\u2013\u03bb2H planes after imposing 0.01 \u2264 \u2126DMh2 \u2264 0.12 are shown in figure 11. From the left panel, we see a sharp correlation between the FIMP DM mass M2 and the coupling \u03bb2h for M2 . 62GeV. The sharp\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nFigure 12.

The muon g \u2212 2 tension may be relieved in the magenta-coloured region. The parameter ranges used in the scan are given in eq. (3.5).\ncorrelation may be understood as follows. For M2 . 62GeV, the DM can be produced from the SM Higgs decay. The decay mode h1 \u2192 \u03c6\u20202\u03c62 is proportional to \u03bb1h and the phase-space factor \u221a 1\u2212 4M22 /M2h1 . Moreover, the DM relic density is proportional to the DM mass as\nwell. Thus, as the DM mass increases, the \u03bb2h coupling needs to be decreased in order to obtain the correct DM relic density. For DM mass in the range 50\u201360GeV, we have the phase-space suppression. Hence, in order to get DM in this range, we need a larger value of \u03bb2h. For M2 & 62.5GeV, we do not have the decay channel of the SM Higgs into the FIMP DM, and annihilation processes take over. We thus do not have a sharp correlation in the large M2 region.\nFrom the right panel of figure 11, we also observe a similar kind of behaviour between M2 and \u03bb2H . However, for M2 & 62.5GeV, the \u03bb2H parameter cannot be arbitrarily large as the h2 decay mode is present. Moreover, we see that \u03bb2H may become as large as 10\u221210 whereas \u03bb2h can go only up to 10\u221211. The reason for this is that we varied Mh2 up to 1.1TeV and that the FIMP DM relic density through decay is proportional to \u03bb22H/Mh2 . Therefore, \u03bb2H may become larger as Mh2 takes a larger value, which is impossible for the SM Higgs case.\nThe left panel of figure 12 shows the allowed parameter region in the \u03bb2h\u2013\u03bb2H plane. Since we have considered both the WIMP and FIMP DM in the DM relic density bound, it is hard to bound the quartic couplings from below as there will always be a contribution from the WIMP DM. However, we may obtain an upper bound on \u03bb2h and \u03bb2H above which the DM is overproduced. We find the upper limits as \u03bb2h . 10\u221211 and \u03bb2H . 10\u221210 for the choice of model parameters used in the scan (3.5). The right panel of figure 12 shows the allowed parameter region in the Mh2\u2013\u2206a\u00b5 plane.

The parameter space above the allowed magenta-coloured band is ruled out, and the points below the band demand additional positive contributions in (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 to match the experimental range. One may see a correlation between \u2206a\u00b5 and Mh2 . For a larger value of Mh2 , we get a lower value of \u2206a\u00b5. This is due to the fact that a higher value of Mh2 indicates a higher VEV of the BSM Higgs, v\u00b5\u03c4 . Since v\u00b5\u03c4 = MZ\u00b5\u03c4 /g\u00b5\u03c4 , a higher VEV implies a lower value of g\u00b5\u03c4 which reduces the \u2206a\u00b5 contribution. In figure 13, we present the indirect and direct detection bounds on the mass of the WIMP DM. In the left panel, the AMS 02 indirect detection bound coming from the WIMP DM annihilation to bb\u0304 [17, 139] is indicated with a red line. We see a sharp rise around M1 ' 62GeV which corresponds to the SM Higgs resonance region. A part of the region is ruled out by the indirect detection bound and the rest of the region is to be probed shortly by different ongoing indirect detection experiments [17]. In the right panel, the spin-independent direct detection XENON-1T bound [15] on the WIMP DM is shown. One may see from figure 13 that a part of the M1 \u2264 500GeV region is already ruled out from the direct detection experiments. The rest of the region will be explored in the future by different proposed experiments like Darwin [140] and PandaX [141]."

The produced stochastic GW signals have a potential to be detected by future GW experiments such as LISA [87], DECIGO [88], and BBO [93], and this possibility gives a complementary detection signal to the standard (in-)direct detection and collider searches. In this section, we examine stochastic GW signals from a FOPT in our model and compare them with the sensitivity curves of future GW experiments. Furthermore, we present benchmark points that explain the muon g \u2212 2 tension, neutrino masses, and correct DM relic density, while producing strong GW signals that are within the detectability of Ultimate-DECIGO. We closely follow ref. [99] to estimate the stochastic GW signal from a FOPT.

(4.10)\nIn estimating the sound-wave contribution to the GW signal, we have ignored the possible suppression factor associated with the lifetime of the sound-wave source.3 The suppression factor may be estimated as [145\u2013148]\nSsw ' 1.81\u00d7min { 1, 2(8\u03c0) 1/3\n\u221a 3 vw ( H\u2217 \u03b2 )\u221a1 + \u03b1 \u03bav\u03b1 } , (4.11)\nwhich corresponds to O ( 10\u22122\u201310\u22121 ) for the benchmark points (BPs) presented in table 3. It is also important to note that such a suppression may be followed by a possible enhancement in the turbulence contribution to the GW signal [145]. The precise determination requires dedicated and sophisticated numerical simulations which go beyond the scope of the present work. From eqs. (4.2)\u2013(4.8), one may see that the key parameters that control the GW signal are \u03b1, \u03b2/H\u2217, and Tn, where\n\u03b1 = \u03c1vac \u03c1\u2217rad , \u03b2 H\u2217 = T\u2217 dSE dT \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T\u2217 , (4.12)\nwith SE being the Euclidean action of a bubble and \u03c1vac the energy density released during the FOPT. We note that \u03c1\u2217rad = g\u2217\u03c02T 4\u2217 /30. Throughout the section, we take T\u2217 to be the nucleation temperature Tn, i.e., T\u2217 = Tn.\nTo understand the dynamics of the FOPT, we use the one-loop effective potential,4\nV 1-loopeff = V tree + V 1-loopeff,T=0 + V 1-loop eff,T 6=0 . (4.13)\nHere, V tree is the tree-level potential and V 1-loopeff,T=0 is the zero-temperature one-loop ColemanWeinberg contribution [154] which, in the MS scheme, is given by\nV 1-loopeff,T=0 = \u00b1 \u2211 i ni M4i 64\u03c02\n[ ln M 2 i\n\u039b2 \u2212 ci\n] , (4.14)\nwhere \u039b is the renormalisation scale which we take to be \u039b2 = (v2 + v2\u00b5\u03c4 )/2, ni is the number of degrees of freedom of the particle with field-dependent mass Mi, the constants ci are 1/2 (3/2) for transverse gauge bosons (all other particles), and + (\u2212) is for bosons (fermions). The last correction, V 1-loopeff,T 6=0, is the finite-temperature one-loop correction given by [155]\nV 1-loopeff,T 6=0 = \u2211 i T 4 2\u03c02niI\u00b1 ( m2i T 2 ) , (4.15)\n3We thank the anonymous referee for pointing out this. 4For a gauge dependence issue, readers may refer to refs.

(4.22)\nFermions do not receive any corrections. In order to estimate the \u03b1 and \u03b2/H\u2217 parameters in our model, we performed a numerical analysis by using a modified version of CosmoTransitions [157] together with the mass spectra given above. We restrict our focus on the case where only the SM and the BSM Higgses develop VEVs, taking zero VEVs for the DM candidates \u03c61 and \u03c62 throughout the temperature evolution of the system. We work with the following input parameters:\nv\u00b5\u03c4 , Mh2 , \u03b8 , Mee , M1 , M2 , \u00b5 , g\u00b5\u03c4 , he\u03c4 ,\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb1h , \u03bb1H , \u03bb12 , \u03bb2h , \u03bb2H , (4.23)\nwith the assumptions Mee = M\u00b5\u03c4 and he\u03c4 = he\u00b5 which allow us to analytically diagonalise the RH neutrino mass matrix as we discussed in section 2. In the following, we take he\u03c4 = \u221a 2Mee/v\u00b5\u03c4 . We impose the vacuum stability conditions,\n\u03bbh > 0 , \u03bbH > 0 , 4\u03bbh\u03bbH \u2212 \u03bb2hH \u2265 0 , (4.24)\nas well as the perturbativity and unitarity bounds, |\u03bbh|< 4\u03c0, |\u03bbH |< 4\u03c0, |\u03bbhH |< 8\u03c0, 3\u03bbh+2\u03bbH+ \u221a (3\u03bbh\u22122\u03bbH)2+2\u03bb2hH < 8\u03c0 . (4.25)\nWe focus on the following range of the parameters:\n20\u2264 v\u00b5\u03c4 [GeV]\u2264 250 , 130\u2264Mh2 [GeV]\u2264 1000 , 0\u2264 \u03b8\u2264 0.4 , 1\u2264Mee [GeV]\u2264 100 , 0\u2264\u03bb1h\u2264 0.5 , 0\u2264\u03bb1H \u2264 0.5 , 10\u221212\u2264\u03bb2h\u2264 10\u221210 ,\n100\u2264M1 [GeV]\u2264 300 , 50\u2264M2 [GeV]\u2264 250 , (4.26)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nwhile fixing the other parameters as follows:\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0.1 , \u03bb2H = \u03bb12 = 6\u00d7 10\u221212 , g\u00b5\u03c4 = 6\u00d7 10\u22124 , \u00b5 = 10\u22127 . (4.27)\nWe note that the upper bound of the mixing angle, \u03b8 = 0.4, is chosen by considering the LHC constraints on the hV V couplings coming from the measurements of the Higgs decay into gauge bosons [158]. We observe FOPTs and its associated GW signals for a wide range of the parameter values, including the mixing angle. To show that GWs can be accompanied with both small and large values of the mixing angle \u03b8, we present two BPs with a large value of \u03b8 and two BPs with a small value of \u03b8.\nIn figure 14, we show the associated GW signals together with the sensitivity curves of future GW experiments. We select four BPs and present the results in table 3. From figure 14, we see that all of our four BPs, and many other signals, are well within the reach of detectability of Ultimate-DECIGO, while their signal strengths are below the sensitivity curves of BBO and DECIGO. Taking into account the suppression factor (4.11), we see that some of the GW signals for the chosen BPs fall below the sensitivity curve of the Ultimate-DECIGO, while some stay marginally within the sensitivity curve. However, we stress that the conclusion that the GW signals associated with the FOPT within our model, which simultaneously accounts for the muon g \u2212 2 tension, neutrino masses, and two-component DM scenarios, are within the reach of the Ultimate-DECIGO sensitivity curve remains intact.\nOne may see from table 3 that, in the parameter space that can solve the muon g \u2212 2 tension, generate the neutrinos masses, and produce the correct DM relic density, GWs are also expected whose signals are strong enough to be seen by Ultimate-DECIGO. The presented four BPs clearly showcase that the muon g \u2212 2, neutrino masses, and twocomponent DM scenarios are accounted for in our model which, at the same time, predicts stochastic GWs associated with the FOPT in a single unified framework.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\n10-5 0.001 0.100 10 10-22\n10-18\n10-14\n10-10\n10-6\nf [Hz]\n\u03a9 GW h2\nLISA BBO\nDECIGO Ultimate-DECIGO BP1 BP2 BP3 BP4\nFigure 14.

            "text": "In this paper, we studied an extension of the Standard Model that accounts for the dark matter, the muon g \u2212 2 tension, and the neutrino masses, in a single unified framework. We introduced three massive right-handed neutrinos which, through the type-I seesaw mechanism, provide a mass to the Standard Model neutrinos. We then extended the Standard Model by introducing two scalar fields that play the role of the dark matter. Finally, an extra U(1)L\u00b5\u2212L\u03c4 gauge symmetry is imposed, where the associated gauge boson Z\u00b5\u03c4 alleviates the muon g \u2212 2 tension.\nAs the model we considered contains two Standard Model-singlet scalar dark matter candidates, \u03c61 and \u03c62, we examined the possibility of a single-component as well as twocomponent dark matter scenarios. Focusing on three different regimes, we showed how a single-component or two-component dark matter scenario can emerge by numerically solving the coupled Boltzmann equations. We found that, when the \u00b5\u03c6\u20201\u03c632 term is not negligible, both the single- and two-component scenarios may be obtained, depending on the mass range. When the \u00b5 parameter is small or absent, we showed that a two-component dark matter scenario naturally arises without dependence on the mass range of the WIMP and FIMP DM. In the case of a two-component scenario, one component becomes the WIMP-type dark matter and the other component is the FIMP-type dark matter. We performed a numerical scan and presented viable parameter spaces which are compatible with the current experimental bounds such as the direct and indirect detections, relieving the muon g \u2212 2 tension at the same time.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 6 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 6\nThe presence of the extra scalar fields not only makes the dark matter phenomenology richer. It also affects the evolution dynamics of the vacuum state. As opposed to the Standard Model case whose phase transition is of the cross-over type, a first-order phase transition may be realised in our model. Consequently, stochastic GW signals may be emitted. We investigated the parameter space where the first-order phase transition occurs and scrutinised the associated stochastic gravitational wave signals. Performing a numerical scan, we showed that the predicted gravitational waves are strong enough to be probed by future gravitational wave experiments such as Ultimate-DECIGO. We explicitly demonstrated that our model is capable of accommodating the three problems of the Standard Model, namely the dark matter, neutrino masses, and the muon g \u2212 2 tension, by presenting four benchmark points. The chosen four benchmark points give rise to the first-order phase transition, and consequently, we observe the associated gravitational wave signals. All of the four benchmark points are within the reach of detectability of Ultimate-DECIGO. Furthermore, the chosen benchmark points realise two-component dark matter scenarios. We expect that the gravitational wave feature of our model may serve as a complementary detection signal to the standard (in-)direct detection and collider searches."
