In this paper, we present the first quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray detection in quiescence of the BH LMXB MAXI J1348\u2013630, which is known to display a hybrid disc/jet connection that depends on the accretion rate. We performed deep X-ray and radio observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. MAXI J1348\u2013630 is detected for the first time in quiescence at an X-ray luminosity L X = (7.5 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 30 ( D /2.2 kpc) 2 erg s \u22121 : one of the lowest X-ray luminosities observed for a quiescent BH LMXB, possibly implying a short orbital period for the system.

During such phases, he X-ray luminosity from the accretion disc increases by several rders of magnitude, and the systems transition between different ccretion states with well-defined spectral and timing properties Homan & Belloni 2005 ; Remillard & McClintock 2006 ; Belloni Motta 2016 ; Tetarenko et al. 2016 ). In addition, synchrotron-\nmitting compact jets and moving plasma bubbles, which carry away significant fraction of the accretion power, are observed in the radio and during, respectively, the hard state and the hard-to-soft state ransition (e.g. Corbel et al. 2000 ; Fender 2001 , 2006 ). Ho we ver, H LMXBs are for most of their time in a quiescent state, with low ccretion rates and X-ray luminosities in the range between 10 30 and 0 34 erg s \u22121 , corresponding to Eddington fractions of 10 \u22129 \u223c 10 \u22125 or a 10 M BH (e.g. Plotkin, Gallo & Jonker 2013 ; Reynolds et al. 014 ; Plotkin et al. 2021 ). While quiescence is the most common tate for a BH LMXB, the properties of the accretion flow and of the ets at low luminosities still need to be properly characterized.\nWhen in quiescence, the infrared and optical emission from these ystems is dominated by the companion star, while compact jets, lbeit faint, are still present and can be detected in the radio band e.g. Plotkin et al. 2017 ; Gallo et al. 2019 ). It appears that the jet roperties are essentially the same between outburst and quiescence, ith the radio spectrum that might change from flat-to-inverted to\nE-mail: francesco.carotenuto@physics.ox.ac.uk\nd \u03b2\nThe Author(s) 2022. ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

This upports the current picture of the quiescence state as a sort of ow-luminosity version of the hard state, with very similar spectral nd physical properties (e.g. Gallo et al. 2019 ). Moreo v er, the ompact jets in quiescence might channel a larger fraction (with espect to the outburst phase) of the radiative power of the accretion o w, strongly moti v ating radio observations of quiescent accreting ompact objects (e.g. Plotkin et al. 2019 ). The dominance of the jets t these low luminosities is also believed to be responsible for an bserv ed progressiv e X-ray spectral softening (e.g. Corbel, Tomsick Kaaret 2006 ; Plotkin et al. 2013 ). In analogy with the hard state, the roperties of the accretion flow should also be similar, and, according o one of the main proposed scenarios, the BH could be fed by a hot adiati vely inef ficient accretion flo w (e.g. Narayan & Yi 1994 ; Esin,\ncClintock & Narayan 1997 ). Compact jets from BH LMXBs are fundamentally connected to the ccretion flow, as the levels of jet emission strongly depends on the ccretion rate, both in outburst and in quiescence. This is observed n the hard state as a non-linear correlation between the radio and -ray luminosities taking the form of a power law ( L R \u221d L \u03b2X ). Such orrelation is observed over several orders of magnitude in luminosity n the so-called radio/X-ray diagram (e.g. Hannikainen et al. 1998 ; orbel et al. 2000 , 2003 ), and it is today an important diagnostic of the ccretion/ejection coupling in BH LMXBs, which can also be used o constrain the emission mechanisms in these sources. Two main roups of BHs are currently observed on the radio/X-ray diagram, isplaying two distinct correlations with different power law indices .

On the other hand, sources on he lower track are labelled as outliers (or radio-quiet ) and display ndices \u03b2 1 \u2212 1.4 (Coriat et al. 2011 ; Jonker et al. 2012 ; Gallo t al. 2014 ; Monageng et al. 2021 ; Carotenuto et al. 2021b ). The ajority of BH LMXBs appears now to belong to this second group. nterestingly, thanks to dense monitoring campaigns, some of the utliers were found to display a hybrid correlation, transitioning etween the two tracks at different X-ray luminosities, between 10 \u22124 nd 10 \u22123 L Edd (Coriat et al. 2011 ; Carotenuto et al. 2021b ). While he size of the available data sets of BH LMXBs on the radio/Xay diagram increased considerably in the recent years, the reasons or the observed distribution of sources on the diagram are still nclear. Possible explanations include geometric ef fects, dif ferent et physical properties, and different accretion flow properties (e.g. e\u2019er & Casella 2009 ; Coriat et al. 2011 ; Xie & Yuan 2016 ; Motta, asella & Fender 2018 ). Much less is known about the properties of the two groups of ources in quiescence, since the quiescent regions of the radio/X-ray iagram are still greatly unexplored, due to the extreme faintness of uiescent BH LMXBs. So far, only a handful of BH LMXBs have een detected in quiescence, mostly appearing to be compatible with he standard track (e.g. Gallo et al. 2006 ; Miller-Jones et al. 2011 ; orbel et al. 2013 ; Rib \u0301o et al. 2017 ; Tremou et al. 2020 ), while he behaviour of outliers is completely uncertain. Outlier (or hybrid) ources could re-join the standard track in quiescence (Coriat et al. 011 ), but this has still to be confirmed with additional observations. In this letter, we present the first radio and X-ray detection in quiesence of MAXI J1348\u2013630, constraining its location on the diagram t the lowest possible luminosities. MAXI J1348\u2013630 is a BH LMXB isco v ered in 2019, when it entered into a bright outburst (Tominaga t al. 2020 ). The source appears to be located at a close distance, beween 2.2 and 3.4 kpc (Chauhan et al. 2021 ; Lamer et al. 2021 ), which s fa v ourable for a study of the system in quiescence. In Carotenuto t al. ( 2021a ) we have presented the full radio and X-ray monitoring f MAXI J1348\u2013630 during its 2019/2020 outburst, and we refer to hat paper for details on the various outburst phases. Our radio obserations detected and co v ered the entire evolution of compact jets in he outburst phase, during which MAXI J1348\u2013630 also displayed ome extremely energetic large-scale discrete ejecta (Carotenuto t al. 2021a ; Carotenuto, Tetarenko & Corbel 2022 ). Combining the etections of compact jets with the quasi-simultaneous X-ray obserations, we were able to co v er the whole evolution of MAXI J1348\u2013 30 on the radio/X-ray diagram, finding that this source belongs to he numerous group of outliers. In fact, MAXI J1348\u2013630 displays clear hybrid radio/X-ray correlation, re-joining the standard track t L X 10 33 erg s \u22121 , and it is today the hybrid-correlation source ith the most detailed co v erage on the diagram, and such co v erage as obtained during a single outburst (Carotenuto et al. 2021b ). herefore, constraining its behaviour in quiescence is critical for ompleting the full track of the source on the radio/X-ray diagram, hich is something unprecedented an hybrid source.\nOBSERVATIONS\no constrain the quiescent level of MAXI J1348\u2013630 in radio and Xays, we performed a quasi-simultaneous observation of the source ith the NASA Chandra X-ray observatory (Weisskopf et al. 2000 ) nd with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA; Frater, rooks & Whiteoak 1992 ).\nNRASL 517, L21\u2013L25 (2022)\nhe Chandra observations of MAXI J1348\u2013630 were performed with he Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) on 2021 June 8 (30 ks; ObsId 25054) under Director\u2019s Discretionary Time (PI: F. arotenuto). We restricted the observation to the back-illuminated hip S3, providing the best low-energy response. The X-ray data nalysis was performed using the Chandr a Interactiv e Analysis of bservation (CIAO) software 4.14.1 (Fruscione et al. 2006 ), with he calibration files CALDB version 4.9.6. We filtered to only keep he events in the energy range 0.3\u20138 keV. No background flare was etected. The fluximage script was used to create the X-ray mages, keeping the bin size to 1 (1 pixel = 0.492 \u2032\u2032 ) (see Fig. 1 ). single X-ray source is detected at a position consistent with AXI J1348\u2013630. We extracted an energy spectrum in the 0.3\u20138 keV energy range rom a circular source region with a 2 arcsec radius, while the ackground was extracted from an annulus with an inner radius f 10 arcsec and an outer radius of 20 arcsec. Spectral analysis was arried out with XSPEC (Arnaud 1996 ). Our main goal with the -ray spectral analysis was to estimate the unabsorbed flux in the 1\u2013 0 keV band. Hence, we fitted the spectrum with a simple absorbed ower law model ( tbabs \u00d7powerlaw ), for which the tbabs omponent accounts for interstellar absorption, modelled with an qui v alent hydrogen column density ( N H ) by using wilm abundances Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000 ) and vern cross-sections (Verner t al. 1996 ). Concerning the spectral parameters, the power law hoton index was fixed to = 2.2, in accordance with what is enerally measured for BH LMXBs in quiescence (Corbel et al. 006 ; Corbel, Koerding & Kaaret 2008 ; Plotkin et al. 2013 ), and the olumn density was fixed to N H = 0.86 \u00d7 10 22 cm \u22122 , measured rom X-ray observations during the outburst (Carotenuto et al. 021a , b ). As generally prescribed for low-counts observations, Cash tatistics cstat (Cash 1979 ) was used in the fitting process. We then alculated the 1\u201310 keV X-ray unabsorbed flux using the XSPEC onvolution model cflux .\n2\nA 5 o t t o b fl g u A o w t a ( a u 3 s\n3\nW c I C b s F r = p q t (\nq e i fl c j 2 t l s L\nc c T d d ( c q s L C\nt T 0 C\n4\nM q q i o i \u223c t d d a c n\nt I 6 c t M e c m i c o p t (\no r F t e ( f ( d m o 2\no G h o q i p o a\nd M\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nrasl/article/517/1/L21/6695111 by C N R S - ISTO user on 23 M arch 2023\n.2 ATCA obser v ation\nlong ATCA observation was performed between 2021 July 3 and , less than a week after the Chandra observation, for a total of 24 h n source (proposal ID C3416, PI Carotenuto). During this interval, he array was in the 6B extended configuration. The observation was aken simultaneously in the C and X bands, at central frequencies f 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectiv ely. F or each central frequency, the total andwidth was 2 GHz. PKS 1934\u2013638 was used for bandpass and ux calibration, while PKS 1352\u201363 was used for the complex ain calibration. The data were first flagged and then calibrated sing standard procedures with the Common Astronomy Software pplication ( CASA ; McMullin et al. 2007 ). Imaging was carried ut with the standard tclean algorithm in CASA with a natural eighting scheme chosen in order to maximize sensitivity. To obtain he lowest possible rms, we stacked the two bands into a single image, dopting the Multi-term (Multi Scale) Multi-Frequency Synthesis MTMFS, or MS-MFS; Rau & Cornwell 2011 ) as a deconvolution lgorithm in order to take into account the large fractional bandwidth, sing two Taylor terms. In this configuration, the rms reached \u03bcJy beam \u22121 . To obtain the radio flux density S \u03bd , we fitted a point ource in the image plane with the CASA task imfit .\nT H E QU IESCENT LEVEL O F M A X I J 1 3 4 8 \u2013 6 3 0\ne obtained a significant detection of MAXI J1348\u2013630 in quiesence, both in radio and X-rays. The detection is shown in Fig. 1 . n the X-rays, 21 counts from MAXI J1348\u2013630 were collected by handra (0.3\u20138 keV) in the 30 ks of exposure, implying an unamiguous detection at the lo west le vel of activity of the source. After pectral fitting (Section 2.1 ), we obtain an integrated unabsorbed flux X = (1.3 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u221214 erg cm \u22122 s \u22121 in the 1 \u2212 10 keV energy ange. This can be then converted to the integrated luminosity L X 4 \u03c0D 2 S X . For consistency with Carotenuto et al. ( 2021b ), in this aper we assume distance D = 2.2 kpc (Chauhan et al. 2021 ), and we uote the luminosities with a factor ( D /2.2 kpc) 2 in order to include he distance estimation by Lamer et al. ( 2021 ). We obtain L X = 7.5 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 30 ( D /2.2 kpc) 2 erg s \u22121 .\nMAXI J1348\u2013630 has also been detected in radio during its uiescence phase. As can be seen from Fig. 1 , with 24 h of ATCA xposure time, MAXI J1348\u2013630 is detected as a point source at ts known location, at a significance level of 5 \u03c3 and with a peak ux of 15.3 \u00b1 2.5 \u03bcJy. The faint radio emission coming from the ore location can be safely attributed to the presence of compact ets in quiescence, as observed for other BH LMXBs (Corbel et al. 013 ; Gallo et al. 2019 ; Tremou et al. 2020 ). We then converted he measured radio flux density S \u03bd to the 5 GHz monochromatic uminosity L R = 4 \u03c0D 2 \u03bdS \u03bd , conserv ati vely assuming a flat radio pectrum. This leads to a monochromatic 5 GHz radio luminosity R = (4.3 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 26 ( D /2.2 kpc) 2 erg s \u22121 . With the quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray detection in quiesence, we obtain a new, critical measurement for MAXI J1348\u2013630, ompleting the co v erage of this source on the radio/X-ray diagram. he updated radio/X-ray diagram is shown in Fig. 2 . One can immeiately notice that MAXI J1348\u2013630 aligns very well with the stanard track defined by GX 339\u20134, V404 Cyg and MAXI J1820 + 070 e.g. Corbel et al. 2013 ). Along the detection in quiescence, the clear onfirmation that MAXI J1348\u2013630 lies on the standard track in uiescence is one of the main results of this work. We performed a a imple power law fit L R \u221d L \u03b2X to the three points on the diagram with X < L stand = 3 . 2 + 61 . 3 \u22123 . 0 \u00d7 10 32 ( D/ 2 . 2 kpc ) 2 erg s \u22121 (see Fig. 2 and arotenuto et al. 2021b ), including the detection in quiescence and\nhe two lowest detection in the outburst lying on the standard track. he fit, relying on curve fit from the SciPy package, yields \u03b2 = .57 \u00b1 0.08, which is fully consistent with the standard track (e.g. orbel et al. 2013 ).\nDI SCUSSI ON\nAXI J1348\u2013630 is one of the few BH LMXBs detected in uiescence both in the radio and X-ray bands. Due to the need of uasi-simultaneous deep observations, these detections are exceedngly rare at present. Even if a model-independent mass estimation f the BH is not yet available, the quiescence X-ray luminosty of MAXI J1348\u2013630 corresponds to an Eddington fraction\n10 \u22128.3 L Edd , assuming a 10 M BH. Currently, the BH LMXB with he lowest known X-ray luminosity in quiescence is GS 2000 + 25, etected with Chandra at \u223c10 30 erg s \u22121 , namely \u223c10 \u22129 L Edd (Roriguez et al. 2020 ). The detections at such low Eddington fractions re among the lowest level of activity ever explored for an accreting ompact object. Ho we ver, for GS 2000 + 25 a radio counterpart was ot detected (Rodriguez et al. 2020 ). The most interesting result of this work revolves around the locaion of MAXI J1348\u2013630 on the radio/X-ray diagram in quiescence. n Carotenuto et al. ( 2021b ), we demonstrated that MAXI J1348\u2013 30 belongs to the less-explored group of the so-called hybridorrelation sources. With this detection, we can confirm for the first ime that these sources follow the standard track down to quiescence.\noreo v er, after this work and the co v erage presented in Carotenuto t al. ( 2021b ), MAXI J1348\u2013630 becomes the first BH LMXB to be haracterized on the radio/X-ray diagram for o v er sev en orders of agnitude in X-ray luminosity and almost four orders of magnitude n radio luminosity, during a single outburst and in quiescence. The ontinuity of evolution on the standard track from the end of the utburst (see Fig. 2 and Carotenuto et al. 2021b ), and the displayed ower law X-ray spectrum, are consistent with the current picture of he quiescence state as a low-luminosity analogue of the hard state e.g. Gallo et al. 2019 ).\nIt is then possible to compare the location of MAXI J1348\u2013630 n the diagram with the handful of other BH LMXBs for which adio and X-ray detections in quiescence are av ailable, sho wn in ig. 2 . MAXI J1348\u2013630 appears to have a quiescence luminosity hat is comparable in radio and X-rays with A0620\u201300 (Gallo t al. 2006 ), MWC 656 (Rib \u0301o et al. 2017 ), and XTE J1118 + 480 Gallo et al. 2014 ). Stringent radio upper limits are also available or Swift J1357.2\u20130933 (Plotkin et al. 2016 ) and GS 2000 + 25 Rodriguez et al. 2020 ). On the other hand, MAXI J1348\u2013630 isplays a quiescent luminosity which is at least one order of agnitude lower than other very relevant quiescent BH LMXBs n the diagram, such as GX 339\u20134 (Corbel et al. 2013 ; Tremou et al. 020 ) and V404 Cyg (Plotkin et al. 2017 ). A relation between the quiescent X-ray luminosity L X and the rbital period P orb exists for X-ray binaries (Menou et al. 1999 ; arcia et al. 2001 ), where a higher L X in quiescence is expected for igher P orb , due to the larger size of the accretion disc. While the rbital period of MAXI J1348\u2013630 is currently unknown, from its uiescence X-ray luminosity it is possible to speculate that its P orb s likely shorter than 10 \u223c 20 h, as can be seen from Fig. 3 , at both ossible distances. This is also in line with the peak luminosity in utburst ( \u223c10 \u22121 L Edd , Carotenuto et al. 2021a ), which might suggest similar order of magnitude for P orb (Wu et al. 2010 ).\nA detection of MAXI J1348\u2013630 in quiescence on the stanard track also supports the findings obtained for V404 Cyg and AXI J1820 + 070 (Plotkin et al. 2017 ; Shaw et al. 2021 ), ruling\nMNRASL 517, L21\u2013L25 (2022)\nM\nFigure 2. Radio/X-ray diagram displaying MAXI J1348\u2013630 during its 2019/2020 outburst and in quiescence. For consistency with Carotenuto et al. ( 2021b ), we assume D = 2.2 kpc (Chauhan et al. 2021 ). The vertical dotted line marks the inferred transition luminosity to the standard track (albeit with a large uncertainty, Carotenuto et al. 2021b ), while the red and grey dashed lines represent, respectively, the standard ( \u03b2 = 0.6) and outlier ( \u03b2 = 1.4) tracks, which are shown for illustrative purposes. MAXI J1348\u2013630 is on the standard track in quiescence. For comparison, H1743\u2013322 (Jonker et al. 2010 ; Coriat et al. 2011 ) and GX 339\u20134 (Corbel et al. 2013 ) are shown on the diagram with smaller size points. Sources in quiescence are marked with different colours. The plot shows the location on the diagram in quiescence for A0620\u201300 (Gallo et al. 2006 ), MWC 656 (Rib \u0301o et al. 2017 ), XTE J1118 + 480 (Gallo et al. 2014 ), GX 339\u20134 (Tremou et al. 2020 ), BW Cir (Plotkin et al. 2021 ), and V404 Cyg (Plotkin et al. 2017 ), as well as upper limits for GS 2000 + 25 (Rodriguez et al. 2020 ), GS 1124\u2013684 (Plotkin et al. 2021 ), and Swift J1357.2-0933 (Plotkin et al. 2016 ; Charles et al. 2019 ).\nFigure 3.

Such scenario, in\nNRASL 517, L21\u2013L25 (2022)\nact, w ould result in a steepening of the observed correlation at low uminosities (Yuan & Cui 2005 ), which is instead not observed.\nThe X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1348\u2013630 in quiescence can be dequately described with an absorbed power law with = 2.2. The pectral softening when approaching quiescence is a well-known henomenon (Corbel et al. 2006 , 2008 ; Plotkin et al. 2013 ; Liu t al. 2019 ), observed also in MAXI J1348\u2013630 (Carotenuto et al. 021a ). Such softening could be explained by a lack of hard Xay photons resulting from the decrease of the inverse Compton cattering efficiency at low luminosities (Esin et al. 1997 ; Qiao & iu 2013 ; Liu et al. 2019 ), or by a dominance at low accretion rate of omptonization from thermal particles at the base of the jet, and not n the corona (Markof f, No wak & Wilms 2005 ; Poutanen, Veledina Re vni vtse v 2014 ; Plotkin et al. 2015 ). Thanks to this new detection in quiescence, we obtained the omplete co v erage of the evolution of MAXI J1348\u2013630 on the adio/X-ray diagram, from the quiescent state to the peak luminosity uring the outburst. We believe that the full data set of MAXI J1348\u2013 30 on the diagram will turn out to be particularly important or testing different models describing the disc/jet connection in ccreting BHs, leading to major impro v ements in our understanding f hybrid-correlation sources and, more in general, of the behaviour f BH LMXBs on the diagram.\nA\nW m u s a a s w N p a I p 1 h C d N\nD\nT A i a\nR\nA\nB\nB C C C C C\nC C C\nC C C C E F F\nF\nF\nG G\nG G G\nH H H H J J L\nL M M\nM\nM\nM\nM N P P P\nP P P\nP\nP Q R R R R\nR R S T\nT T V\nW\nW W X Y\nT\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nrasl/article/517/1/L21/6695111 by C N R S - ISTO user on 23 M arch 2023\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the anonymous referee for the careful reading of the anuscript and for the valuable comments.
