    "abstractText": "Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) prepared by metal-assisted chemical etching of crystalline silicon wafers followed by deposition of plasmonic gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) were explored as templates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from probe molecules of Methylene blue and Rhodamine B. The filling factor by pores (porosity) of SiNW arrays was found to control the SERS efficiency, and the maximal enhancement was observed for the samples with porosity of 55%, which corresponded to dense arrays of SiNWs. The obtained results are discussed in terms of the electromagnetic enhancement of SERS related to the localized surface plasmon resonances in Au-NPs on SiNW\u2019s surfaces accompanied with light scattering in the SiNW arrays. The observed SERS effect combined with the high stability of Au-NPs, scalability, and relatively simple preparation method are promising for the application of SiNW:Au-NP hybrid nanostructures as templates in molecular sensorics.",

            "text": "The phenomenon of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was first observed on a rough silver electrode with a pyridine monolayer in 1974 [1], and it has been studied for years (see, for example, Refs. [2,3]). Nowadays, the SERS effect is widely used for detecting target molecules at low concentrations that are important for numerous applications, from ecology [4] and chemistry [5] to biosensorics [6\u20138], including biomedical diagnostics [9\u201312]. The most convenient explanation of SERS considers two main mechanisms, i.e., (i) electromagnetic enhancement and (ii) chemical one [3]. While the contribution of the latter is usually considered much smaller than electromagnetic enhancement [3], both mechanisms are sensitive to the physical properties and morphology of SERS substrates [5,6]. Now, the most prominent SERS-active substrates employ an effect of the enhanced electric field due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in what are called plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) [3,4]. Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) NPs with amazing plasmonic characteristics are usually used to detect low concentrations of biomolecules by SERS [13\u201317]. While the SERS signal promoted by individual plasmonic NPs is characterized by relatively low intensity and poor reproducibility, which become a major obstacle for practical application and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23052590 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 2 of 12\ncommercialization, the use of specifically designed nanostructured substrates as templates for plasmonic NPs is the main direction for the development of SERS sensing systems for different biomolecules [16], living cells [17], and biosystems [18\u201320]. In recent years, various types of semiconductor nanostructures such as silicon nanowires (SiNWs), nanotubes, and porous films have attracted research interest as templates for SERS-active plasmonic NPs because of the high surface-to-volume ratio, roughness, and the tunability of pore sizes in the former [19\u201323]. For example, SiNWs [22] and amorphous/crystalline hybrid Si-based nanostructures [23] have opened a broad avenue for developing new SERS substrates, which complement pure metallic nanostructures [2,3,6]. Also, electrochemically prepared porous silicon (por-Si) and por-Si based 1D photonic crystals with deposited Ag-NPs have been explored as potential SERS templates with a detection limit up to 10\u221212 M [24]. Prior to this, SiNWs with deposited Ag-NPs were used for ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules [25]. Besides SERS application, SiNWs are extensively studied for their use in photovoltaics [26], photocatalysis [27], gas sensors [28], drug delivery [29], and biomedical diagnostics [30]. Modern methods for the preparation of SiNWs consist of different physical and chemical approaches, i.e., reactive ion etching [31], thermal evaporation [25,32], laser ablation [33], vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid growth [34], plasma etching [35], molecular beam epitaxy [36], and metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) [37,38]. Among them, MACE is very suitable because of the simplicity, low cost, and possibilities for tailoring the morphology of SiNW arrays, e.g., their surface roughness, length, porosity, and spacing between individual Si nanostructures [36,37]. Features of the spatial distribution of catalytic metal NPs on the surface of c-Si substrate, such as uniformity, density, and thickness, will affect the morphology of Si nanostructures formed during MACE [37]. When NPs of silver and gold as catalysts are deposited onto the c-Si surface, the MACE-formed structures can be changed from mesoporous Si layers to arrays of SiNWs with an increase in the spatial density of metallic NPs [36\u201338]. As for SERS application, SiNW arrays are usually decorated with Ag or Au-NPs by using chemical methods [39\u201342]. The advantages of chemical deposition include its implementation and simplicity; self-induced deposition does not need vacuum technology or a power supply [41]. Ag-NPs usually exhibit better plasmonic enhancement of SERS, but they do not possess surface stability and biocompatibility in comparison with Au-NPs [42]. Moreover, by adjusting the size, shape, and concentration of Au-NPs on the surfaces of semiconductor-based nanostructures, one can create new photonic materials with unique properties for biosensing applications [8,43\u201346]. The performance of SERS-active surfaces is usually characterized by an enhancement factor, which depends on the substrate morphology and physical properties of plasmonic NPs [2,3]. Maximal SERS efficiency is often associated with the formation of a so-called \u201chot spot\u201d of the electric field related to plasmonic NPs [3,17,18]. The reproducibility and stability of the SERS signal is an important metric for evaluating the effectiveness of SERSactive surfaces, which means that the surface must be well controllable and stable for a long time [45\u201347]. So, the search for a versatile and high-performance substrate for the SERS of biomolecules is still ongoing, with well-known technologies being developed and new fabrication technologies being proposed. Here, we investigate Au-NP-decorated SiNWs prepared using the MACE method followed by deposition of additional Au-NPs. The prepared samples, which represent either highly porous Si layers or arrays of relatively well spatially separated bundles of SiNWs, are tested as templates for the SERS detection of dye molecules of methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RB) with molar concentration varying from 10\u221215 to 10\u22126 M. The obtained results allow us to reveal an effect of the morphology of SiNWs on their activity as potential SERS substrates for the highly sensitive detection of molecules.\nInt. J. Mol.

In the first stage (Figure 1a), c-Si substrates were immersed in an aqueous solution of HAuCl4/HF to deposit Au-NPs, which were used to catalyze the heterogeneous dissolution of c-Si in hydrofluoric acid, i.e., MACE [42]. Three main series of the samples were prepared with Au-NP deposition times, tdep, which were 10, 20, and 30 s. The deposition of Au-NPs was carried out by immersing the c-Si substrate into an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.4 mM)/HF (5 M) for tdep. Different deposition times of Au-NPs were used to prepare series of samples with different surface densities of pores, i.e., low, medium, and high porosity. The resulting samples were washed with deionized water and dried in air. Then, c-Si wafers with deposited Au-NPs were etched in a solution of HF/H2O2 by using the MACE process (Figure 1b). The etching solution for MACE was a mixture of an aqueous solution consisting of HF (5 M, 40%) and H2O2 (37%) with a volume ratio of 2:10; the etching time was 30 min. Then, the samples were immersed in a mixture of HCl/HNO3 = 3:1 to remove residual Au-NPs (Figure 1c). Finally, the samples were immersed into the HAuCl4/HF solution to deposit Au-NPs on the SiNW\u2019s surfaces (Figure 1d).\nFigure 1.

Au-NPs are randomly distributed on the surface, and the size distribution can be described by the log-normal functions (insets of Figure 2) with mean sizes of about 16, 32, and 35 nm for the deposition times of 10, 20, and 30 s, respectively. These samples with different size distributions of Au-NPs were proceeded by MACE to form SiNW arrays with different morphologies.\nFigure 2.

However, the samples prepared with different tdep consist of SiNW arrays with different morphologies, and the mean spacing between neighboring NWs is controlled by the size distribution of catalyzing Au-NPs deposited at the first preparation stage (Figure 1a).\nTo quantify the volume fraction of pores, which are etched in the c-Si substrate due to the MACE process by catalytic Au-NP, we used an analysis by the box-counting method [48] of top-view SEM images of the prepared samples (Figure 3). According to this analysis (Supplemental Figure S1 and Equation S1), the porosity, P, accounts for 55, 72, and 83% for tdep = 10, 20, and 30 s, respectively. One can see that the sample with P = 55% can be considered a porous layer with partially fused mesopores, which form a dense array of SiNWs (Figure 3a). However, the sample with P = 72% looks like an array of relatively well-defined SiNWs with mean cross-sectional sizes of the order of 100 nm (Figure 3b). Furthermore, the sa ple with P = 83% r presents an array of SiNWs with significantly large spaci g between nanowires (Figur 3c).\nThe down insets of Figure 3 show SEM images of SiNW\u2019s tips with deposited plasmonic Au-NPs, which are seen as small black spots. The EDX analysis (Supplemental Figures S2\u2013S4) indicates that the total concentration of gold is 3.2, 3.8, and 3.0 weight % for the samples with P = 55, 72, and 83%, respectively. Thus, the gold concentration is about 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 at. %, and it is weakly dependent on the sample porosity. Figure 4 shows TEM images of an individual SiNW with deposited Au-NPs. The mean size of Au-NPs is about 10 nm, as shown in Figure 4b. This value is close to the size of Au-NPs, which is determined by the same deposition time for the flat surfaces of c-Si wafers, as shown in Figure 2. Besides isolated Au-NPs, there are many of their aggregates attached to the side surfaces (Figure 4a) and tips (Figure 4b) of SiNWs. The surface roughness of the latter promotes the tight binding between Au-NPs and SiNWs.\nFigure 4.

Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 5 of 12\nFigure 5a shows that the total reflection for SiNWs and SiNWs:Au-NP samples increases from about 4 to 26% in the spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm, while the samples with tdep = 30 s exhibit significantly lower reflectance of about 6\u201311% (Figure 5c). In the case of Au-NPs deposited on the c-Si surface for 20 s, the total reflection for SiNWs:Au-NPs shows higher reflectivity than that for pure SiNW arrays of the same porosity (Figure 5b). The low reflectivity of SiNW arrays is usually related to an effect of light localization, which is caused by strong elastic light scattering accompanied with light absorption in Si nanostructures [49]. The porosity of 55% for SiNW arrays likely promotes weaker light localization, which seems to be a little stronger for the sample of SiNWs:Au-NPs, as evidenced by the lower reflectance coefficient of the latter (Figure 5a).\nFigure 6a shows spectra of SiNWs:Au-NPs with adsorbed MB molecules. The spectra consist of narrow peaks of the SERS from MB molecules together with a broad background repeated to the photoluminescence (PL) of MB. The intensities of both SERS and PL decrease with increasing sample porosity. At the same time, the Raman intensity of MB was very weak for initial SiNWs without Au-NPs. The increase in the Raman signal for SiNWs with deposited Au-NPs in comparison with the initial ones is obviously explained by the SERS effect because of the LSPR-enhanced electric fields nearby Au-NPs. The difference in the SERS enhancement for SiNW arrays with different porosity cannot be explained by different concentrations of Au-NPs, which are approximately the same (0.4\u20130.5 at.%) for all samples of SiNWs:Au-NPs (Supplemental Figures S2\u2013S4 and Table S1).\nTo reveal the net Raman signal in SiNWs:Au-NPs structures, the PL background is subtracted from the total signal, as shown in Figure 6b. The PL spectrum is interpolated\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 6 of 12\nby a polynomial function centered near 1300 cm\u22121, which corresponds to a wavelength of 690 nm, in agreement with the well-known fluorescence spectrum of MB [50]. The spectrum with the subtracted PL contribution allows us to evaluate the net SERS effect in SiNWs:Au-NPs. Figure 7 shows that besides the Raman line of MB molecules, a line at 520.5 cm\u22121 is observed in the spectra of all investigated samples. This line is obviously related to the one-phonon Raman scattering by the crystalline lattice of SiNWs [49]. While the intensity of this line increases with decreasing total porosity of the samples, the SERS signal of MB increases even more and reaches a maximal value for the sample with P = 55% (black curve in Figure 7).\nThe SERS spectra of MB consist of numerous peaks with frequencies at 450, 500, 595, 669, 769, 874, 949, 1035, 1181, 1301, 1392, 1444, and 1625 cm\u22121, which correspond to different vibration modes of MB molecules [47]. The assignment of the Raman active vibration modes of MB is given in Table 1. Figure 8 shows SERS spectra of MB adsorbed with different concentrations on the surfaces of SiNWs:Au-NPs. One can see that the MB concentration of the order of 10\u221215 M can be easily detected for the samples with P = 55%, indicating the high efficiency of the prepared SERS substrates. As for the MB concentration dependence of the SERS intensity, it is weakly sensitive to the molecule concentration in the range from pico- to femtomolar. This fact can be related to the certain amount of MB molecules adsorbed in the hottest spots formed by neighboring Au-NPs on the surfaces of SiNWs, similar to the case of dried colloidal Au-NPs drop casted on a glass slide [47]. It should be noted that in our experiments, the SERS signal of MB adsorbed on flat c-Si substrates coved with Au-NPs deposited for 10 s was well detectable only at a rather high concentration of about 1 \u00b5M (Supplemental Figure S6) and it was nonreproducible at lower MB concentrations. The maximal SERS signal of MB adsorbed on the c-Si wafer with deposited Au-NPs was at least an order of magnitude lower than that for SiNWs:Au-NPs. This fact demonstrates that the latter structures promote the SERS efficiency due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of Si nanowires combined with the electromagnetic enhancement of the Raman scattering.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 7 of 12\nWe carried out additional experiments on the SERS efficiency of SiNWs:Au-NPs where we increased the incubation time of Au-NPs from 10 to 80 s at the last stage of preparation (Figure 1d). The experimental results showed that the SERS signal depended nonmonotonically on the incubation time and that it could be possible to additionally improve the SERS signal by about 1.5\u20132 times by using an incubation time of 80 s. However, the SERS signal improvement was accompanied with an increase of the PL background (Supplemental Figure S7). For shorter and longer incubation times, the SERS activity decreases. The nonmonotonic dependence of the SERS efficiency on the incubation time can be explained by an interplay between the creation of additional hot spots of the electric field nearby Au-NPs and the light absorption related to stronger light localization in arrays of SiNWs with deposited Au-NPs. Moreover, the SERS activity of SiNWs:Au-NPs samples\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 8 of 12\nprepared for longer incubation times can be influenced by aggregation of Au-NPs that will change both their mean size and morphology. To quantify the SERS efficiency of the investigated samples, we analyzed an enhancement factor (EF), which can be expressed by the following equation [3]:\nEF = IS\u00b7Cre f CS\u00b7Ire f\n(1)\nwhere IS and Iref are the Raman intensities of MB for the analyzed sample, i.e., SiNWs:AuNPs, and reference sample, respectively; CS and Cref are the MB concentrations in the analyzed and reference samples, respectively. If initial SiNWs are used as the reference sample, it allows us to assume the similar surface distribution of MB molecules in the samples. Using Equation (1), the EF factor for the Raman line of MB at 1625 cm\u22121 is estimated to be 6.1 \u00d7 104, 2.6 \u00d7 104, and 1.1 \u00d7 104 for the samples with P = 55, 72, and 83%, respectively (for details, see Figure S5). The maximal EF for SiNWs:Au-NPs with lower porosity can be related to the optimal morphology SiNW arrays, which control partial light localization in a combination with LSPR-enhanced electric fields nearby Au-NPs. The latter effect can also be stronger for rough surfaces at the nanoscale [14]. Table 1 summarizes the EF values of SiNWs:Au-NPs to MB with a concentration of 10\u22126 M for different molecular vibration frequencies. One can see that the strongest EF occurs for the band at 1444 cm\u22121, which can be assigned to the mixed vibrations coupled with \u03bd(C\u2014C)/\u03bd(C\u2014N) stretching and in plane \u03b2(CH) bending vibrations of the fused aromatic ring of the MB molecule [47]. The maximal EF for these vibration modes as well the EF variations for different bands can be related to an effect of the chemical factor of SERS [3], which influences the Raman polarizability of adsorbed dye molecules. To further demonstrate the high sensitivity of our sensory platform, the SERS spectra of RB molecules were measured in the range of molecule concentration from 10\u221215 to 10\u22126 M (Figure 9). Similar to the case of MB, the SERS signal of RB was weakly dependent on the molecule concentrations varying from 10\u22126 to 10\u22129 M. This fact can indicate both high sorption efficiency and tight binding of RB molecules at the hot spots between Au-NPs on the SiNW\u2019s surfaces. Such hot spots should be characterized by enhanced strength of the electric field, which will additionally bind and polarize the dye molecule [3,47,51]. The same effect is probably responsible for the EF spreading, which is observed for MB molecules, as shown in Table 1.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2590 9 of 12"

Spectra of the total (both diffused and specular) optical reflectance in the region from 400 to 1000 nm were measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, USA).

The prepared samples were explored as SERS templates for the sensitive detection of adsorbed molecules of Methylene blue and Rhodamine B. Significantly, such dye molecules could be easily detected at an extremely low concentration of the order of 1 fM. Both the enhancement factor and minimal detectable concentration of analyte can obviously be improved by further optimizing the morphology of SiNWs and the concentration of deposited Au-NPs. Our results demonstrate that SiNWs:Au-NPs structures with desired porosity possess the optimal conditions for the Raman scattering, which is combined with surface plasmon resonance, and that they substantially enhanced the SERS signal of adsorbed molecules. The operationally simple and inexpensive applied synthesis method yielding dense arrays of SiNWs with Au-NPs for the SERS detection of small target molecules can be useful in the preparation of SERS templates for biosensing applications.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/ijms23052590/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.Y.T. and Z.N.U.; methodology, V.Y.T. and K.K.D.; software, S.B.I.; validation, V.G.Y.; funding and resources, A.E.G., R.R.N. and Z.N.U.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.B.I.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.P.S., V.Y.T. and Z.N.U.
