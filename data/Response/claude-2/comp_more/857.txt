 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore other discourse parsing methods besides RST and compare their effectiveness in improving document-level machine translation. For example, try utilizing discourse relation graphs or entity grids.

2. Investigate integrating rhetorical relation labels and nuclearity labels from RST trees more effectively into the translation model. The paper mentioned this is still an open area.

3. Experiment with different paragraph segmentation methods such as neural models and study their impact on discourse parsing and translation quality.

4. Apply the proposed ideas to other language pairs besides English-German and analyze if the improvements transfer across languages.

5. Extend the work to other long-form text generation tasks that require discourse modeling, like summarization and story generation. The multi-granularity attention could help in these areas too.
