Although developmental scientists used virtual\nvisits prior to COVID-19, validation of virtual assessments of infant socioemotional and\nlanguage development are lacking. We aimed to fill this gap by validating a virtual visit\nprotocol that assesses mother and infant behavior during the Still Face Paradigm (SFP)\nand infant receptive and expressive communication using the Bayley-III Screening Test.\nValidation was accomplished through comparisons of data (i.e., proportions of missing\ndata for a given task; observed infant and maternal behaviors) collected during in-person\nlaboratory visits and virtual visits conducted via Zoom. Of the 119 mother-infant dyads\nwho participated, 73 participated in lab visits only, 13 participated in virtual visits only, and\n33 dyads participated in a combination of lab and virtual visits across four time points (3,\n6, 9, and 12 months). Maternal perspectives of, and preferences for, virtual visits were\nalso assessed. Proportions of missing data were higher during virtual visits, particularly\nfor assessments of infant receptive communication. Nonetheless, comparisons of virtual\nand laboratory visits within a given time point (3, 6, or 9 months) indicated that mothers\nand infants showed similar proportions of facial expressions, vocalizations and directions\nof gaze during the SFP and infants showed similar and expected patterns of behavioral\nchange across SFP episodes. Infants also demonstrated comparable expressive and\nreceptive communicative abilities across virtual and laboratory assessments. Maternal\nreports of ease and preference for virtual visits varied by infant age, with mothers of 12-\nmonth-old infants reporting, on average, less ease of virtual visits and a preference for\nin-person visits. Results are discussed in terms of feasibility and validity of virtual visits\nfor assessing infant socioemotional and language development, and broader advantages\nand disadvantages of virtual visits are also considered.\nKeywords: infant stress, language development, mother-infant interaction, virtual visits, participant experience"

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions have created\nchallenges for developmental research that relies heavily on traditional in-person methods of data collection. Yet, in meeting those challenges, and building on psychological researchers\u2019 successful use of online testing platforms with adults, adolescents, and school-age children (e.g., Buhrmester et al., 2011; Germine et al., 2012; Griffiths et al., 2019), developmental scientists have explored and fine-tuned creative and potentially transformative solutions to conducting research with infants and young children. Although online methods were in use by developmental researchers prior to COVID-19 (e.g., Scott and Schulz, 2017; Tran et al., 2017), the need for such methods during the\npandemic has spurred further development and proliferation (see Garrisi et al., 2020; Su and Ceci, 2021). The majority of online or virtual validation studies, to date, have focused on cognitive developmental assessments, whereas validated virtual assessments of infant socioemotional and language development have been sparse. We aimed to fill this gap.\nAs with almost all facets of life\u2014research and otherwise\u2014 across the globe, our longitudinal investigation of infant development was halted in March 2020. We quickly pivoted to a virtual visit protocol using a video conferencing platform, which resulted in a unique opportunity to compare laboratory and virtual visits in assessing infant socioemotional and language functioning. Specifically, we assessed (a) infant and maternal behavior and infant response to stress during the Still Face Paradigm (SFP; Tronick et al., 1978) using a micro-behavioral coding approach, and (b) infant language development using the expressive and receptive communication subtests of the BayleyIII Screening Test (Bayley, 2006a). We also examined maternal perceptions of, and preferences for, virtual vs. laboratory visits.\nOur study complements innovative efforts by cognitive developmentalists to collect data via online platforms. Asynchronous unmoderated platforms, such as LookIt (Scott and Schulz, 2017; Scott et al., 2017) and Amazon Mechanical Turk (Tran et al., 2017), have been used to conduct infant looking-time studies. Although asynchronous studies with infants and young children have demonstrated feasibility (e.g., Scott and Schulz, 2017; Tran et al., 2017; Rhodes et al., 2020), large portions of data (e.g., 40% in Tran et al., 2017) are typically excluded due to technical problems or procedural errors (e.g., infant position in the video). Online studies conducted synchronously (i.e., with a live experimenter present) have demonstrated feasibility, with minimal data loss, in assessing neurodevelopmental risk (Kelleher et al., 2020), looking time and learning (Smith-Flores et al., 2021) and cognition and memory (Sheskin and Keil, 2018) among infants and children. Importantly, both asynchronous and synchronous online studies of varied cognitive domains largely yield findings that replicate those from laboratory studies (e.g., Scott and Schulz, 2017; Sheskin and Keil, 2018; Rhodes et al., 2020; Smith-Flores et al., 2021).\nAlthough this growing literature suggests the promise of online platforms for assessing cognitive development in the context of highly structured tasks, the validity on such methods for assessing dimensions of infant social and emotional\nfunctioning, such as parent-infant interaction, infant response to stress, and infant expressive and receptive communication skills, remains unknown. Whereas certain advantages (e.g., greater flexibility, more diverse participant pool) and disadvantages (e.g., poor internet connectivity, decreased experimental control, increased potential for distractions, see Su and Ceci, 2021) regarding virtual visits will be common across studies of cognitive and socioemotional development, some issues are unique. On the one hand, virtual visits may be particularly conducive to capturing infant and maternal social and emotional behaviors that are more ecologically valid because assessments take place in the familiar home environment without experimenters physically present. On the other hand, and precisely because the home environment is highly familiar, the effectiveness of virtual visits in eliciting infant response to stress may be reduced. Additionally, intensive assessments of mother-infant interaction using microanalytic coding schemes typically require video recording procedures that involve multiple cameras and pan/zoom/tilt functionality. Although two recent studies indicate feasibility of administering mother-infant interaction tasks via a virtual visit protocol (Gustafsson et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2021), feasibility was assessed subjectively (e.g., research assistant ratings), and validity was not assessed. With these issues in mind, we examined objective indicators of feasibility and validity of synchronous virtual visit procedures designed to assess mother-infant interaction, infant stress regulation, and infant language development.\nWith respect to infant socioemotional functioning, the StillFace Paradigm (SFP; Tronick et al., 1978) is an established procedure to assess mother-infant interaction and infant responses to stress. The SFP involves three episodes, each typically 2 mins in length: (a) a \u201cplay\u201d episode, in which the mother and infant interact without toys, (b) a \u201cstill face\u201d episode, in which the mother looks at her infant but maintains a neutral facial expression and ceases interaction (i.e., vocalizations, touch), and (c) a \u201creunion\u201d episode, in which the mother resumes interaction with her infant. The still face episode, which violates infants\u2019 expectations for reciprocal interaction, typically elicits a distress response. Use of microanalytic coding procedures, in which infant and maternal behaviors are coded continuously, permits a window into maternal and infant behavioral coordination during the play and reunion episodes (e.g., Sravish et al., 2013; Pratt et al., 2015; Busuito and Moore, 2017). Further, a meta-analysis of 39 studies indicated robust and expected effects of the SFP on infant behavior coded in a microanalytic manner: infant gaze to mother and positive affect decreased and infant negative affect increased from the play to still face episode, whereas infant positive affect and gaze to mother increased from still face to reunion (Mesman et al., 2009).\nImportantly, Mesman et al. (2009) reported that SFP effects on infant behavior and affect were robust to procedural differences (e.g., length of episodes, use of transition interval in which mother turned away from infants between episodes) across studies, although consideration of the setting (i.e., lab vs. home) in which the procedure was carried out was not considered in this meta-analytic review. Whereas most studies using the SFP have been conducted in a controlled laboratory environment,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\nMoore et al. (2001) conducted the SFP during home visits at 2, 4, and 6 months and reported expected changes in infant behavior (i.e., increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect during the still face episode), thus supporting the use of the SFP in the home environment. Moreover, Gustafsson et al. (2021) reported that among 348 mother-infant dyads participating in a virtual visit procedure, including the SFP, 94\u201399% of videos passed data quality checks based on research assistant ratings. Although promising, objective evidence of feasibility (e.g., percentage of missing data) and validity of virtual SFP assessments is lacking.\nIn contrast to the lack of prior validation studies for remote assessments of mother-infant interaction during the SFP, several prior studies have reported feasibility and validity of assessing child language abilities using an online video conferencing format. Findings indicate that speech and language characteristics (e.g., mean length utterance, number of different words) among toddlers during play with a parent (Manning et al., 2020) and performance on a standardized language assessment among school-age children with language impairment (Sutherland et al., 2017) showed good feasibility, and reliability and/or validity of assessments did not differ significantly from data collected during face-to-face sessions. Ashworth et al. (2021), however, reported significantly higher verbal performance (assessed via the British Picture Vocabulary Scale, Third Edition [BPVS-3]) during online virtual visits vs. laboratory visits among school-aged children with Williams syndrome. Although these past studies indicate utility of conducting language assessments among toddlers and schoolaged children via a virtual visit platform, we are unaware of prior work that has compared infant language assessments conducted via a synchronous virtual visit vs. an in-person laboratory format.\nComplementing direct assessments of infant socioemotional and language functioning, assessing parents\u2019 perspectives about their virtual visit experiences is also needed. To date, the pros and cons of virtual visits for developmental research have been primarily discussed from the perspective of the researcher (see Su and Ceci, 2021). In this vein and in our own experience, advantages of virtual visits include greater re/scheduling flexibility, greater efficiency of cost and time, and better ability to recruit more (geographically) diverse samples, whereas disadvantages include diminished researcher control, greater dependence on parents to implement task procedures, and technical challenges that arise due to poor internet connectivity and/or shortcomings of participants\u2019 devices. Equally important, however, are parents\u2019 views about participation in developmental research using online platforms. Although there has been long-standing interest in clinical research (e.g., Yessis et al., 2012) and health care settings (e.g., Cleary and Edgman-Levitan, 1997) for assessing participants\u2019 or patients\u2019 perspectives of their experiences, such assessments are less common in developmental research (but see Kelleher et al., 2020; Maitre et al., 2021). Given the relative novelty of remote assessment methods in developmental research, and particularly the lack of suchmethods used to assess infant socioemotional and language development, mothers\u2019 perceptions of and preferences for visits of this type may provide a window into how and when\nsuch visits may be best used, as well as input for refining visit procedures in ways that not only increase data quality but also optimize participants\u2019 experience.\nIn the current study, we addressed three main objectives. First, we assessed whether infant and maternal SFP behaviors differed between laboratory and virtual visits on several objective metrics, including the frequency of missing data, distributions of behavioral codes, and expected changes in infant behavior across episodes. Second, we assessed whether infant receptive and expressive language differed between laboratory and virtual visits on similar metrics, including frequency of missing data and infant subtest scores. Third, we assessed mothers\u2019 perceptions of the virtual visit format and their preferences for virtual visits vs. in-person laboratory visits. We also conducted supplementary analyses to examine whether (a) the behavioral variables assessed during virtual visits and (b)maternal perceptions and preferences for virtual visits varied as a function of the dyad\u2019s prior experience with virtual visits."

Families were recruited from local pediatric clinics, community organizations, and online forums serving families from a wide range of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Families were excluded from participating if their infant had any known cardiac abnormalities, was born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), had birth complications and/or admission to the NICU, or had anMRI contraindication.

            "text": "Laboratory Visits Prior to COVID-19, infants and mothers participated in a 60- mins laboratory visit at 3, 6, and 9 months and a 90-mins visit at 12 months; infant brain scans (via magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) during natural sleep were also conducted at 3 and 12 months. The laboratory visits included assessments of behavior and physiology (using 3-lead ECG wireless monitors) during a baseline session, play session, challenging puzzle task (12 months only), SFP (3, 6, 9 months only; Tronick et al., 1978), Strange Situation Procedure (12 months only; Ainsworth et al., 1978), as well as administration of Bayley cognitive and language subtests. Behavioral data from the SFP and Bayley language subtests were examined in this report. For the SFP, the infant was seated in an age-appropriate seat (e.g., bouncy seat, high chair). Mothers were provided with both verbal and written instructions about the SFP episodes, and a gentle knock on the door to the laboratory playroom signaled when to transition to the next episode. Following the mother-infant interaction sessions, a trained research assistant administered the Bayley-III Screening Test. Two professional cameras were mounted in opposite corners of the playroom; cameras had pan/tilt/zoom capabilities and were controlled and viewed from an observational booth adjacent to the playroom. All tasks were recorded for later review or scoring. Parents also completed a series of online questionnaires at each time point via Qualtrics.\nVirtual Visits During a 40-min virtual visit, we conducted assessments paralleling our laboratory assessments of (a) infant baseline physiology, (b) mother-infant play, (c) SFP (3, 6, 9 months only), (d) challenging puzzle task (12 months only), and (e) Bayley language subtests. Prior to the virtual visit, mothers were emailed a Zoom link as well as a list of materials needed during the visit (e.g., bouncy seat or high chair for SFP) and were\nreminded to charge the device (e.g., laptop, tablet, phone) they planned to use for the visit (see Garrisi et al., 2020; SmithFlores et al., 2021, regarding recommendations for Zoom as platform for synchronous virtual visits). Zoom links were sent with the passcode function to protect participant privacy. Host and participant videos were switched to \u201con\u201d and the waiting room feature was enabled. The visit coordinator recorded the session directly to the local computer (vs. Zoom cloud option) and data were subsequently uploaded to secure servers. The visit coordinator used the share screen function in Zoom to present slides that detailed instructions for each activity. After giving an overview of the visit activities and informing mothers of their right to request that the session or recording be stopped at any time (as was also done at the beginning of the laboratory visits), the visit coordinator started video recording and pinned the participant\u2019s video. During all activities, the visit coordinator turned off her video camera and microphone (except during the Baseline video- unmuted) and asked mothers to minimize their Zoom window so that infants would not be distracted by the screen. The share screen function was also used to share (a) the sea animals video for the baseline physiological assessment and (b) picture items for the Bayley receptive communication subtest. The visit coordinator worked with the mother to obtain the optimal video angle for each activity (e.g., capturing faces of both the mother and infant).\nParticipants were video recorded in a variety of rooms including living rooms, dining rooms, parent and infant bedrooms, and kitchens. Nonetheless, virtual visits maintained consistency with the lab visits in that an infant bouncy seat or high chair was used for the SFP, with mothers seated on the floor or in a chair accordingly. To provide an optimal camera angle for behavioral coding of the SFP, mothers and infants sat facing each other and slightly angled themselves toward the camera so that their faces were visible. To proactively minimize distractions, mothers were asked to silence their phones, turn off any electronic toys used during the play sessions, and limit the presence of pets or other family members as much as possible. Following the virtual visit, parents completed online questionnaires, which included a brief survey about maternal perceptions of the virtual visit."

            "text": "To assess infant receptive and expressive communication, we used the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition, Screening Test (Bayley, 2006a). The Bayley-III Screening Test is made up of items from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley, 2006b) and is a well-established and validated screening instrument designed to assess cognitive, language, and motor functioning of infants and young children (Bayley, 2006a). This screening instrument was normed on a US representative sample of 1,675 children aged 1\u201342 months and demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability,\nadequate internal consistency among subscale items, and good construct validity (Bayley, 2006a,b).\nAt both the virtual and laboratory visits, subtests assessing receptive communication (24 items) and expressive communication (24 items) were administered by a trained research assistant. The cognitive subtest was administered during the laboratory visits as well, but it was not deemed feasible for the virtual visits due to the required testing manipulatives, number of items, and complexity of instructing mothers to effectively administer the items. For infants in the age range participating in this study (3\u201312 months), items assessing receptive communication captured auditory acuity (e.g., responding to voices, discriminating sounds, localizing sounds), vocabulary development and comprehension (e.g., identifying objects or pictures that are referenced), and social referencing. Items assessing expressive communication captured preverbal communication (e.g., babbling, gesturing, joint referencing, turn taking) and vocabulary development (e.g., imitating words, naming pictures).\nFollowing the Bayley (2006a) procedures, the infant\u2019s age determined the items to be administered, and administration ended when the infant failed four consecutive items. During the laboratory administration, the mother was present in the room. Administration for the language subtests took \u223c10\u201315 mins, although we note that the majority of the expressive communication items did not require formal administration and could instead be scored through \u201cincidental observation\u201d (i.e., observing the infant during any part of the laboratory or virtual visit for expressive behaviors that satisfied the scoring criteria for a given item).\nSeveral adaptations in administration procedures were made for the virtual visits. Prior to the visit, the visit coordinator informed the mother about materials needed for testing; these materials were typical items that a family with an infant would have at home (e.g., blocks, ball, spoon). To administer the BayleyIII Screening language subtests virtually, the visit coordinator (who had received extensive training in administration and scoring procedures) would observe the infant\u2019s verbal and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\ncommunicative behavior throughout the virtual visit to score items relevant to expressive communication and would guide the mother through the standard administration of items that could not be scored through incidental observation. In doing so, the visit coordinator provided verbal and written (through PowerPoint slides displayed via shared screen) instructions. For items in which a stimulus book was needed, we created comparable testing stimuli using open-source images available online, and the visit coordinator would show the pictures in PowerPoint slides via the share screen function in Zoom. The mother would verbally prompt the infant (e.g., Showme the bird.) The mother was instructed to indicate to the visit coordinator whether the infant was pointing or clearly looking at the item she mentioned. To minimize distractions, the visit coordinator also instructed mothers to minimize the Zoom screen during items where it was not needed.\nFor both laboratory and virtual visits, the researcher scored the receptive communication items as they were administered and reviewed the video recording following a given visit for any items for which questions arose. Scoring of expressive communication items varied slightly during laboratory vs. virtual visits. During the laboratory visits, the researcher administering the Bayley observed the infant via a video monitor during the different sessions (e.g., baseline, play, SFP), made detailed notes and scored items on the Bayley-III scoring form while carrying out these \u201clive\u201d observations of the infant; video recordings were reviewed following the visit if questions arose about scoring specific items. During the virtual visits, because one researcher managed all roles (e.g., providing mothers with task instructions, managing the video recording, administering Bayley items), the expressive items were scored almost exclusively by reviewing the video recording following the visit; paralleling scoring procedures from the laboratory visits, detailed notes were also entered on the scoring form. Further, a doctoral-level researcher with seven years of Bayley-III experience reviewed all Bayley procedures for all laboratory and virtual visits and corrected scores as needed to ensure accuracy of administration and scoring."

We assessed two types of missing data for mother-infant behavioral data from the SFP. First, at each time point, we compared proportions of data from laboratory vs. virtual visits that were completely missing (i.e., the observational assessment was attempted or fully conducted but could not be coded) using z tests. Second, for SFP sessions that were deemed codeable, we considered the proportion of missing data for a given code when parts of the recording were not codeable due to the camera angle (e.g., infant or mother\u2019s face out of camera view) or interruptions (e.g., a third person entered the room; a noise distracted baby ormother). Because the proportion scores showed high levels of skewness and kurtosis, we used the Mann Whitney U-test for independent samples to compare the distributions of missingness for lab and virtual visits; this nonparametric test, which does not assume normal distribution of the dependent variable, was more appropriate than an independent samples t-test.\nNext, to test whether infant and maternal behaviors varied by visit type, we first computed proportion scores for maternal and infant behaviors as the number of frames for a given behavior (e.g., gazing at mother\u2019s face) divided by the total number of frames coded for that particular behavioral category (e.g., infant direction of gaze), excluding frames that were coded as missing.We then tested whether proportion scores were different across lab and virtual visits using Mann-Whitney U-test s for independent samples. Given the multiple comparisons made (3 episodes \u00d7 3 time points), we applied a Bonferroni correction of p < 0.006 (0.05 divided by 9) for each infant and maternal code (facial expression, vocalization, direction of gaze).\nLastly, to assess whether expected patterns of change in infant negative affect, positive affect, and gaze varied as a function of visit type (and in accordance with prior work, see Mesman et al., 2009), we computed the following composite scores within episode and time point: infant negative affect (i.e., mean of infant negative facial affect [cry + frown] and vocalization [cry + fuss] proportion scores), infant positive affect (i.e., sum of infant mild positive and strong positive facial affect proportion scores), and infant gaze towardmother (i.e., sum of infant gaze atmother\u2019s face and gaze at mother\u2019s actions).

As a preliminary step, we assessed whether demographic characteristics (infant sex, maternal education, family income) were related to maternal virtual visit perceptions or preferences. We used maternal reports following the mother\u2019s first virtual\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\nvisit (regardless of time point, n = 44), and all associations were nonsignificant.\nNext, to assess whether maternal perceptions of virtual visits were significantly different than a \u201cneutral\u201d rating, single-sample t-tests were conducted within each time point and indicated a significant difference for maternal ratings of visit ease at each time point (see Figure 7A). Mothers, on average, rated the virtual visits on the \u201ceasy\u201d end of the scale compared with the scale midpoint (3 = \u201cneutral\u201d): t(12) = \u22125.52, p < 0.001 (3 months), t(17) = \u22125.83, p < 0.001 (6 months), t(28) = \u22128.05, p < 0.001 (9 months), and t(43) =\u22123.86, p< 0.001 (12 months). For maternal ratings of how well the lab vs. virtual visits captured typical interactions between the mother and her infant (see Figure 7B), maternal mean ratings were not significantly different from the scale mid-point (3= \u201cabout the same\u201d).\nOne-sample proportion tests of maternal preferences (prefer virtual visit, prefer lab visit, no preference, see Figure 7C) indicated a significant difference in maternal preferences at 12 months only, with 72% of mothers indicating preference for in-person visits, whereas 11% and 16% indicated preference for virtual visits or no preference, respectively, z = 5.40, p < 0.001. If a visit preference was indicated, we also asked mother to provide a brief explanation for her preference. Preferences for virtual visits included (a) convenience for mothers and families to schedule a visit without disruption to family routines (n = 10), (b) safety of families and their decreased potential exposure to COVID-19 (n = 6), and (c) familiarity, with a small group of mothers reporting their infant\u2019s behavior is more natural in the home environment vs. a new setting with strangers (n = 5). Preferences for in-person lab visits included (a) decreased distractions to mothers and infants (n = 25), (b) greater confidence in conducting visit procedures with the help of research staff, especially in handling technology (n= 11), and (c) desire for face-to-face interaction vs. interacting through a screen (n = 8). Mothers of older infants (12 months) were much more likely to report their preference for in-person lab visits due to\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\ndecreased distractions and greater assistance by research staff in carrying out study procedures.\nGiven the difference that emerged in maternal preferences at 12 months, we conducted two sets of follow-up analyses. First, using mothers\u2019 reports completed after their first virtual visit only, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with time point as the between-subjects factor with maternal \u201cease\u201d and \u201ctypical\u201d ratings, respectively, as the dependent variable. These analyses allowed direct tests of whether maternal perceptions differed as a function of time point and also controlled for mothers\u2019 prior experience with virtual visits. For maternal ratings of the degree to which the virtual visit was easy vs. difficult, the main effect of time point was marginally significant, F(3) = 2.37, p = 0.085, although a planned contrast revealed that mothers reported less ease of virtual visits at 12 months (M = 2.43, SD = 1.28) compared with maternal reports at the other three time points combined (3 months:M = 1.69, SD= 0.85; 6 months:M = 1.33, SD = 0.52; 9 months: M = 1.64, SD = 0.92), t(40) = 2.65, p = 0.011. No time-point effects emerged for maternal reports of how typical their interaction with their infant was during virtual vs. lab visits.\nSecond, we assessed whether maternal preferences for lab visits at the 12-month time point may have been due to COVID timing (e.g., the 12-month reports were collected later in the pandemic). To explore this possibility, we assessed whether there was a significant difference in COVID timing (computed as number of days between the date of the maternal report\nand March 13, 2020, marking the beginning of COVID-related shutdown) as a function of visit time point, and this test was nonsignificant, F(3) = 1.65, p = 0.182. At each time point, we also conducted a one-way ANOVA to examine whether COVID timing differed as a function of maternal visit preferences, and all tests were nonsignificant."

Of the 44 dyads participating in a virtual visit at 12 months, 29 had participated in one or more prior virtual visits (11 dyads at 3, 6, and 9 months; 7 dyads at 6 and 9 months; 12 dyads at 9 months). Given that participants differed in the degree to which they had previously experienced virtual visits, we conducted supplemental analyses that paralleled themain analyses reported above to assess whether key study variables (i.e., proportions of missing data, infant and maternal behaviors during the SFP, infant receptive and expressive language) differed as a function of prior virtual visit exposure (present vs. absent; 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points) or number of prior virtual visits (9- and 12-month time points).

At the 9- and 12-month time points, Kendall\u2019s tau-b (\u03c4b) correlations were tested to assess whether the number of prior virtual visits was associated with maternal ratings.

The current project adds to growing evidence for the feasibility and validity of virtual visits. Complementing existing online paradigms that have been used to assess infants\u2019 cognitive development (Scott et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2017; Smith-Flores et al., 2021), our study focused on the use of established assessments to capture infant socioemotional and language development during the first year of life. Further,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 14 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 15 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\nby conducting assessments at multiple time points, we were able to explore whether virtual visits were more or less feasible or valid at different periods during the first year. Lastly, we gained insight into maternal perspectives on virtual visits and how such perspectives differed by infant age.\nOur first objective was to assess the feasibility and validity of using the SFP in a virtual visit context. The SFP has demonstrated validity for assessing infant stress regulation in controlled laboratory settings (see Mesman et al., 2009), although Moore et al. (2001) provide evidence supporting use of the procedure in home environments. Our findings indicate that not only is it feasible to conduct the SFP using a virtual visit procedure (also see Gustafsson et al., 2021), but that applying a microanalytic coding scheme to video recordings from virtual visits yields data comparable to those collected in a controlled laboratory setting with professional camera capabilities. With respect to feasibility, the percentage of SFP protocols that were completely missing did not differ across lab and virtual visits, although reasons for missingness varied across visit type, with lab visits deemed not codeable largely due to technical issues or infant distress/fatigue (particularly among younger infants), whereas virtual visits were largely missing due to screen distraction among older infants.We note that we quickly adjusted our protocol (i.e., askingmothers to minimize their Zoom screen during the interactive tasks) when it became clear during our initial virtual visits that older infants were distracted by the computer screen. The convenience and scheduling flexibility of virtual visits also enabled us to minimize data loss due to infant distress or fatigue because we could more easily reschedule virtual visits when the mother indicated that another time would be better. These findings are consistent with prior online studies with a live experimenter that show minimal data loss (e.g., Sheskin and Keil, 2018), especially when task and recording/technical procedures have been thoroughly pilot tested and key privacy safeguards (e.g., waiting room, meeting password) are in place (e.g., see Garrisi et al., 2020, for a comprehensive set of recommendations).\nAmong cases that were deemed codeable, there were consistently higher levels of missing data during the virtual visits, as would be expected. In the laboratory playroom, two professional-grade cameras mounted in opposite corners of the room with zoom, pan, and tilt functions enabled high-quality recordings of mother and infant in split screen format. Nonetheless, despite the much more limited recording capabilities available during the virtual visits (i.e., only one camera angle was available for recording, and there was no ability to pan or tilt the camera to follow the mother and/or infant at moments when they moved out of the camera frame), missing data were relatively minimal and were highest for facial expressions (7\u201313% missingness, compared with <1\u20136% missingness for lab visits). Our visit coordinator worked with mothers to obtain the best recording possible, and the relatively low levels of missingness\u2014both in terms of completely missing and partially missing\u2014are acceptable, especially in comparison with levels of missing data observed for asynchronous sessions (e.g., Tran et al., 2017).\nWith respect to validity, we compared the proportions of behaviors for each infant and maternal code (i.e., facial\nexpressions, vocalizations, and directions of gaze) separately for SFP episodes and time points. Analyses indicated minimal differences in mean proportions. Of the 162 Mann-Whitney Utests conducted for infant behaviors and the 171 tests conducted for maternal behaviors, 4 total were significant at p < 0.006 (Bonferroni correction). Further, using a microanalytic coding scheme in which behaviors were coded continuously on a frameby-frame basis, our assessment of interobserver reliability on 19\u201325% of visits showed acceptable kappa statistics (>0.65) for all codes at all time points, regardless of visit type. Lastly, at each time point (3, 6, 9 months), infant negative affect, positive affect, and gaze to mother showed the expected patterns of change across play, still and reunion episodes of the SFP as reported in prior work (see Mesman et al., 2009). Importantly, the patterns of infant behavior change were largely consistent across time points, and in no instance did change patterns differ as a function of visit type. In prior studies, maternal and infant behavioral assessments during the SFP have typically been conducted in controlled laboratory settings (e.g., Sravish et al., 2013, but see Moore et al., 2001; Pratt et al., 2015; Busuito and Moore, 2017), raising questions about whether a virtual visit procedure carried out in the familiar home environment (and without researchers physically present) would elicit expected changes in infant affect and behavior. In addressing this concern, our study provides some of the first evidence for the feasibility and validity of assessing mother-infant interaction and infant behavioral regulation during the SFP using a virtual visit format.\nOur second objective was to assess infant expressive and receptive communication using the Bayley-III Screening Test. With respect to infant performance, expressive and receptive communication scores at a given time point (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) did not differ as a function of visit type. These results are consistent with prior studies indicating no difference in language performance assessed via virtual vs. face-to-face visits among toddlers (Manning et al., 2020) and school-age children (Sutherland et al., 2017). Nonetheless, despite similar performance across the virtual and laboratory visits on the language subtests, there were significantly higher amounts of missing data on the receptive language subtest at the 3-, 6- and 9- month virtual vs. lab visits, which is cause for concern. Although rates of missing data did not significantly differ by visit type at 12 months, there were relatively high rates of missing data for both lab and virtual visits at this time point. The rates of missing data among the expressive subtest scores, in contrast, were relatively low at all time points for both virtual and lab visits.\nUnlike the expressive language subtest, which relies mainly on researchers\u2019 \u201cincidental observations\u201d of the infant during the course of the virtual or lab visit, the receptive language subtest involves observing the infant\u2019s response to administered probes or items. We used stringent scoring criteria, in which subtest scores were considered to be completely missing if one or more items could not be adequately administered and/or scored due to infant compliance, distractions, and/or administrator error. Although we provided mothers with detailed instructions for administering the receptive language items, missing data during virtual visits at 3, 6, and 9 months was mainly due to faulty administration and related difficulty in scoring the infant\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 16 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\nresponse. At 12 months, missing data at both virtual and lab visits were predominantly due to infant fatigue, noncompliance, and/or distractions. Taken together, our findings for the BayleyIII Screening communication subtests indicate high levels of feasibility and validity for assessing expressive language via a virtual visit procedure in which the infant and mother engage in a variety of interactive tasks that permit observing a range of infant expressive communication skills. Our confidence in virtual assessments of infants\u2019 expressive language specifically is corroborated by Manning et al.\u2019s (2020) report on the validity of a virtual assessment of toddlers\u2019 language skills obtained during parent-toddler play session using indicators such as observed mean length utterance and number of different words spoken. Given the relatively large proportions ofmissing data for receptive language, however, we have less confidence in the feasibility of assessing this aspect of infant language development via a virtual visit procedure.\nOur final objective was to assess maternal perspectives of, and preferences for, virtual visits using a brief survey created for the purposes of this study. At each time point, mothers were significantly more likely to rate virtual visits as \u201ceasy\u201d compared with \u201cneutral.\u201d Nonetheless, mothers of 12-month-olds were significantlymore likely to rate virtual visits as less easy compared with maternal ratings at other infant ages. Mothers of 12-montholds also showed a preference for in-person visits. Interestingly, although supplementary analyses indicated that prior experience with virtual visits in the context of the current study was not related to infant or maternal behavioral measures (infant or mother SFP behaviors; infant Bayley language scores), mothers of 9-month-olds reported a greater preference for in-person visits when they had not had prior virtual visit experience, whereas mothers of 12-month-olds indicated preference for in-person visits regardless of prior virtual visit experience. A substantial proportion of mothers of older infants (9- and 12-month-olds) also reported that their interactions with their infants were more natural during lab visits compared with virtual visits, although all comparisons on this item were nonsignificant.\nReasons for preferring in-person visits among mothers of older infants centered on distractions that surrounded virtual visits as well as mothers\u2019 desire for support by research staff. Given that 9- and 12-month-olds are \u201con the go\u201d and more attuned to the wider environment, including the device used during the virtual visit, this pattern of maternal responses is perhaps not surprising. Yet, in-person lab visits may pose other challenges for older infants. Whereas it was possible for younger infants to take brief naps or feeding breaks during lab visits, such breaks were less feasible with older infants. As such, older infants may become more fatigued and fussier for some of the same reasons that mothers found virtual visits challenging. Because we did not collect mothers\u2019 ratings of relative ease or challenge of their experiences following in-person lab visits, we were unable to directly compare mothers\u2019 perceptions of virtual vs. lab visits. We were also unable to compare missingness, reliability, and validity of observational data from the 12-month visits because only data from the SFP sessions have been coded to date. In this light, we cannot make strong recommendations for the use of virtual visits at 12 months. In contrast, data at 3, 6, and 9 months suggest\nthat virtual visits are an acceptable, useful option for capturing infant socioemotional functioning observed during the SFP and infant expressive communication skills assessed via the Bayley-III Screening Test.\nWe note several limitations of the current study. First and foremost, we did not initially set out to assess the feasibility and validity of a virtual visit procedure. Instead, the study objectives in this report emerged as a result of necessary COVID-related restrictions that required us to pivot to a virtual visit protocol. Given the ad-hoc nature of the virtual visits, our sample sizes across visit types and time points were unbalanced, although we did conduct virtual visits at all time points to enable assessment of virtual visit feasibility and validity across a range of infant ages. Second, although few differences emerged between virtual and lab visits on our key study measures, COVID-19 posed a clear design confound. This confound was most concerning with respect to mothers of older infants showing a preference for lab vs. virtual visits. Follow-up analyses indicated that such preferences did not covary with when maternal reports were made relative to the COVID shutdown in March 2020. Nonetheless, more direct assessments of families\u2019 COVID-related stressors and experiences (e.g., disruptions to child care and work routines, illness, social isolation) are important to consider in relation to mothers\u2019 virtual visit perceptions and preferences. Likewise, certain advantages (e.g., scheduling flexibility) and disadvantages (e.g., distractions in the home) of virtual visits may be heightened due to the pandemic and become less salient in a post-pandemic environment.\nIn addition to limitations specific to COVID-19, the use of virtual visits to assess infant socioemotional and communicative competence requires consideration of broader advantages and disadvantages. Among older infants who are more mobile (crawling, walking), the lack of cameras that could follow the infant and often the lack of contained space in the home increased challenges of conducting assessments of motherinfant interactions with older infants. Further, distractions or interruptions from family members or pets during virtual visits can be a hindrance while carrying out standardized assessments, although we aimed to proactively limit distractions. During visits, mothers were also asked tominimize their Zoomwindows during interactive tasks to minimize screen distractions. As already noted above, an important advantage of virtual visits was greater convenience and flexibility in scheduling and/or rescheduling visits as needed due to infant sleep schedule or mood. For instance, we were able to minimize such missing data during our virtual visits by offering mothers the opportunity to schedule a \u201ccatch-up\u201d visit if their infant became fussy/tired. Although we provided this option at both lab and virtual visits, mothers were much more likely to schedule a catch-up virtual visit (n = 32) vs. a catch-up lab visit (n = 15). Not only does such flexibility in resuming virtual visits at a later time when infants are more alert decrease the likelihood of some types of missing data, it may also increase researchers\u2019 ability to more accurately capture infants\u2019 levels of competence.\nWe highlight two additional advantages of virtual visits that may provide further motivation for using such procedures to assess infant socioemotional development beyond the COVID-19\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 17 February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 734492\npandemic. First, virtual visits may provide a method to more effectively recruit fathers. Although we required mothers\u2019 participation for the current study to be consistent with our laboratory procedures, including fathers in virtual visit procedures will likely provide more flexibility to families and thereby increase participation rates. Research on the dynamics of parent-infant interaction and infant development has focused almost exclusively on mothers (e.g., see Davis and Logsdon, 2011), even though fathers have increasingly taken on caregiving roles over the past several decades and make unique contributions to children\u2019s socioemotional and cognitive outcomes (e.g., Cabrera et al., 2018; Ru\u00edz et al., 2019). Research indicates, however, that on average, fathers who agree vs. decline to participate in high-commitment, highstress research procedures (e.g., multiple videotaped procedures) differ on a host of factors, including education, race/ethnicity, infant characteristics, and family functioning (Costigan and Cox, 2001), suggesting the need for research approaches that are less burdensome to families and to fathers, in particular. Changes to family routines and stress on the whole family system brought about by the pandemic (Prime et al., 2020) further underscore the importance of capturing the larger family context and infants\u2019 experiences with mothers as well as fathers when present in the home. Virtual visits provide a novel, cost-effective, and family-friendly way to involve fathers more directly in research on infant development and family dynamics.\nSecond, and in a related vein, virtual visits may provide developmental researchers opportunities to recruit samples with greater racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and/or geographic diversity. To do so, however, researchers will need to be mindful of the \u201cdigital divide\u201d faced by participants from rural communities and/or lower SES backgrounds and the obstacles they face in terms of access to reliable computers and internet connectivity (see Lourenco and Tasimi, 2020; van Dijk, 2020). In addition, families characterized by lower socioeconomic status may have less easy access to physical space with few distractions. As such, infant or dyad performance on virtual visit tasks could be impeded due to higher rates of technical issues and/or distractions, and further validation of virtual visit procedures among geographically and socioeconomically diverse samples is warranted.\nIn sum, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of virtual visits by developmental researchers, and past work demonstrating validity of these techniques has predominantly focused on assessments of infant cognition. Our findings indicate that data obtained from assessments of infant socioemotional and language functioning using a synchronous virtual visit procedure\nare comparable to those obtained during in-person lab visits. Although the use and validation of these new procedures during a global pandemic present inherent limitations, infant assessments conducted via Zoom and other remote platforms are likely to be used well beyond the current pandemic. Developmental researchers should continue to assess their feasibility and validity."
