 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the framework to model more complex human behaviors like social preferences, cognitive biases, and moral values. The current work focuses primarily on temporal decision making but LLMs could potentially simulate a wider range of human behaviors.

2. Investigate techniques to improve the quality and coverage of the synthetic demonstrations generated by LLMs. This could involve developing better prompting techniques or combining RL and IL to handle demonstration gaps.

3. Evaluate the framework on a broader set of economic games and decision making tasks. The current empirical validation is limited to a few experiments, so expanding to other domains like household finance, healthcare, etc. would be valuable. 

4. Study methods to control the level of rationality/irrationality in the synthetic demonstrations. This could allow modeling a spectrum of human behaviors from perfectly rational to highly biased. Parameters could be exposed to control the degree of biases.

5. Analyze the societal impacts and ethical considerations of using LLMs to simulate human behaviors. As models become more realistic, it raises concerns around privacy, manipulation, and dual use that should be addressed.
