    "abstractText": "Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) present exciting possibilities across various industries, ranging from catalytic applications to water remediation. By immobilizing nanoparticles, LDHs\u2019 characteristics and functionality can be enhanced, allowing for synergetic interactions that further expand their potential uses. A simple chemical method was developed to produce well-dispersed Pd-Cu NPs on a Co-Cr LDH support using a combination of in situ coprecipitation/hydrothermal and sol-immobilization techniques. The Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalysts was obtained, showing its catalytic activity in promoting the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and enabling the reduction of nitrocompounds through NaBH4 mediation. The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalyst were comprehensively investigated utilizing a range of analytical techniques, comprising FTIR, XRD, XPS, TGA, nitrogen adsorption isotherm, FESEM, and HRTEM-EDX. The findings showed the significance of immobilizing the bimetallic Pd-Cu nanoparticles on the Co-Cr LDH via an exceptional performance in the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (16% conversion, 99.9% selectivity to benzaldehyde) and the reduction of nitrobenzene (98.2% conversion, rate constant of 0.0921 min\u22121). The improved catalytic efficacy in benzyl alcohol oxidation and nitrobenzene reduction on the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalyst is attributed to the uniform distribution and small size of the Pd-Cu NPs as active sites on the Co-Cr LDH surface. The prepared catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability during repeated runs. This study paves the way for multiple opportunities in tailoring, producing, and precisely controlling catalysts for various organic transformation reactions.",

            "text": "Industry often relies on oxidation reactions to convert petroleum-based feedstocks into chemical reagents, which are then utilized as precursor materials for various applications. However, they frequently employ harmful and polluting methods that yield hazardous wastes. Because of safety issues associated with the use of combustible organic solvents and environmental concerns regarding the generation of harmful side products, the industrial sector has begun to limit the use of oxidation processes [1]. The concepts of environmentally friendly, sustainability, and chemistry should be rigorously taken into consideration when developing a new oxidation process [2]. The research community has consistently aimed to discover an efficient oxidant that aligns with the aforementioned concepts, as traditional oxidation methods are no longer suitable [3]. Among the most extensively studied processes in synthetic organic chemistry is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13131956 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 2 of 19\nacids, ketones, and aldehydes. This is partly because of the widespread presence of these components in fragrances, vitamins, and medications [4]. To accomplish the foregoing efforts, tremendous work has been put into developing aerobic oxidation processes. The most effective substitute for the current approaches is the integration of metallic or bimetallic catalyst and molecular oxygen [5,6]. In fact, oxygen is an economical and low-polluted oxidizing agent with the highest oxygen content. This enables reactions to occur under moderate conditions, thereby conserving the overall energy required [7]. A desirable green approach for the manufacture of the finest chemicals in the industrial field has been identified as the use of molecular oxygen in the integration with heterogeneous catalytic systems. The basis of many current industrial operations is the use of stoichiometric inorganic oxidants, such as K2Cr2O7. Nonetheless, these procedures often generate significant waste and typically exhibit low atomic efficiency, making them ultimately uneconomical and environmentally unfriendly [8\u201310]. Because of the successful implementation of numerous homogeneous catalysts capable of catalyzing liquid phase oxidation, substantial product quantities have been achieved [11\u201314]. However, it is well known that isolation and recycling are the main drawbacks of using homogenous catalysis. Thus, research has switched to the design and tailor of heterogeneous catalysts that could be utilized for fixed-bed and batch reactors. The development of numerous catalysts based on multicomponent oxide support has occurred over the past ten years [15,16]. In reality, noble metals serve as the basis for some of the most intriguing heterogeneous catalysts in the field today [17,18]. One drawback of using noble metal catalysts is their tendency to exhibit low selectivity and suffer from catalyst deactivation. However, by utilizing a bimetallic catalyst that incorporates a secondary metal component, it is possible to improve the catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability while reducing the likelihood of deactivation [18]. Interestingly, recent research has demonstrated that bimetallic catalysts are highly effective in facilitating organic transformation reactions [19\u201331]. Cobalt\u2019s redox aptitude, which impacts the stability of an oxidation state, is influenced by several factors. These include the shape, particle size, and type of catalytic support used [30\u201332]. Cobalt\u2019s propensity for redox reactions can be altered by incorporating another oxide or metal, commonly referred to as a doping or promoter constituent. Because of their exceptional physicochemical properties and distinctive 2D structure, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have recently gained more attention in catalysis [33]. LDHs are materials characterized by a layered structure including positively charged metal cations, negatively charged hydroxide ions, and interlayer anions. These metal cations typically include divalent (II) and trivalent (III) metals, such as magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), or zinc (Zn). Within the layered structure, each layer contains a combination of (II) and (III) cations interconnected by hydroxide ions. Positioned between the layers, the interlayer anions can be replaced with other anions, providing unique versatility to the LDH materials [34]. The active sites in LDHs are typically located on the edges or basal planes of the sheets, where the metal cations are exposed and accessible to reactants. The dispersion of active sites refers to the distribution and accessibility of these sites within the LDH structure. The higher the dispersion, the more active sites are available for catalytic reactions, leading to increased catalytic activity. LDHs have been shown to be effective catalysts for a wide range of catalytic reactions, comprising oxidation, reduction, acid\u2013 base catalysis, and photocatalysis. The catalytic performance of LDHs can be affected by factors such as the size and composition of the metal cations, the interlayer anions, and the dispersion of active sites [35]. The novelty of the current work lies in the development of a chemical method to create well-dispersed Pd-Cu nanoparticles on a Co-Cr LDH support. This approach combines in situ coprecipitation/hydrothermal and sol-immobilization techniques, resulting in the formation of a Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalyst. The catalyst demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and the reduction of nitro compounds. Additionally, the comprehensive investigation of the catalyst\u2019s physicochemical properties using various analytical techniques provides valuable insight into its performance. The\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 3 of 19\nimproved catalytic efficacy, attributed to the uniform distribution and small size of the PdCu nanoparticles on the Co-Cr LDH surface, along with the exceptional stability during repeated runs, represents the novelty of this study. Additionally, the Co-Cr-LDH catalyst exhibits greater stability to the final matrix because of the resistance of both metals to leaching or deactivation during catalytic reactions. Moreover, the distinct arrangement of Co and Cr ions within the LDH structure influences the availability and distribution of the active sites on the material\u2019s surface. This specific arrangement impacts the dispersion and accessibility of active sites in Co-Cr-LDH, which subsequently affects its catalytic activity and selectivity [36]. These findings pave the way for opportunities in tailoring, producing, and controlling catalysts for diverse organic transformation reactions."

A centrifuge was used to filter the precipitate, and then it was rinsed with DI water until the pH became neutral.

Elemental Assessment\nThe percentages of copper and palladium in all of the LDH samples were determined using ICP analysis (7800 ICP-MS, Agilent, Wood Dale, IL, USA), as tabulated in Table 1. The findings imply that the actual amounts of both Pd and Cu in the synthesized catalysts closely correspond to the calculated values. According to our analysis, the measured values exhibit a slight deviation of only 0.01% to 0.03% from the expected values based on the synthesis process.\n3.1.2. Spectroscopic Evaluation\nATR-FTIR analysis was used to further verify the LDH structure by discovering cations and anions in the lamellar structure. This made it easier to comprehend of the composition and arrangement of the LDH and the incorporated ions. The FTIR spectra of Co-Cr LDH (black line), Cu@Co-Cr LDH (red line), Pd@Co-Cr LDH (blue line), and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH (green line) catalysts are illustrated in Figure 1A. The hydroxy moiety is confirmed by the characteristic broad band noted in all of the spectra at 3400\u20133500 cm\u22121, which is indicative of the stretching vibration of inter-lamellar molecular H2O and hydroxyl moiety that are found in layers of LDH. The band\u2019s extreme broadness suggests a diverse range of H-bonds. The weak absorption band at 2398 cm\u22121 is typically associated with the stretching vibration\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 6 of 19\nof carbon dioxide. This band is often observed in infrared spectroscopy (IR) analysis of LDH materials. The band that appeared at 1641 cm\u22121 is appointed to the bending vibration of intercalated water molecules. The peak of intercalated water molecules vanished after immobilization of the copper and palladium NPs. The distinctive band at 1347 cm\u22121 is indicative of the stretching vibration of NO3\u2212. Because of the hydrogen bonding and the effect of the \u201cn\u201d value in NO3\u2212 (H2O)n, the band at 1347 cm\u22121 was a little bit wider for the Co-Cr LDH. The incorporation of Cu or Pd NPs resulted in a diminishment in the intensity of the NO3\u2212 stretching peak with a shift to a higher wavenumber that significantly decreased upon loading of the bimetallic (Cu and Pd) NPs. This demonstrated that the anion exchange is indicative for the fastest NO3\u2212 rotation of anion [41]. It seems that the change in the Cu sample is more significant compared to the Pd sample. This suggests that the incorporation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles had a more pronounced effect on the NO3\u2212 stretching peak intensity than the incorporation of palladium (pd) nanoparticles. The greater significance of the change in the Pd sample could be attributed to a few factors: (i) Cu nanoparticles may exhibit electronic properties that enhance their interaction with the NO3\u2212 species more effectively than Pd nanoparticles. This could result in a more significant alteration of the NO3\u2212 stretching peak. (ii) Cu nanoparticles might have stronger surface interactions with the Co-Cr LDH matrix compared to Pd nanoparticles. These interactions could lead to more substantial modifications in the chemical environment surrounding the NO3- species, resulting in a larger impact on the spectral characteristics. Furthermore, the vibrations modes (O-M-O, M-O-M, and M-O-H) in the LDH structure is primarily responsible for the other characteristic absorption bands below 750 cm\u22121. These findings confirmed the development of LDH [41\u201343]. Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20\nThe XRD diffraction patterns of the developed Co-Cr LDH materials are illustrated in Figure 1B. All samples depict well-defined diffraction lines that might be pointing to the hydrotalcite-like structure (JCPDS#38\u20130487). That the diffraction patterns correspond to pristine Co-Cr LDH confirms the development of a hydrotalcite-like structure, where the distinctive diffraction lines at 11.24\u00b0, 23.2\u00b0, 34.15\u00b0, 38.22\u00b0, and 60.29\u00b0 could be attributed to the (003), (006), (009), (012), and (110) planes, respectively [44,45]. The XRD pattern of the Co-Cr LDH depicts a distinctive characteristic represented in its retained original hydrotalcite-like structure after incorporation of the Cu and Pd bimetallic NPs, although the diffraction lines become wider and slightly weak. No additional diffraction lines related to the crystalline phases of the Cu and Pd metallic NPs were noted, demonstrating their extensive dispersion over the LDH surface. The (003) basal diffraction spacing was determined to identify whether the Cu and Pd metallic NPs were intercalated into the layered structure or retained on the LDH surface (Table 2). An interlayer spacing of 0.7472 nm was determined by measuring the (003) basal spacing at 11.24\u00b0, suggesting the potential occupancy of NO3\u2212 and H2O species within the interlayer space. The incorporation of Cu and Pd metallic nanoparticles resulted in an increased interlayer space of 0.8621 nm. This change can be attributed to the presence of NO3\u2212 and H2O species in the interlayer space, indicating an interaction between these species and the layered material. The introduction of metallic nanoparticles can facilitate interaction with these interlayer species, either through electrostatic forces or chemical means. Consequently, this interaction leads to the rearrangement and slight separation of the layers, ultimately expanding the interlayer spacing.\nFigu e 1.

The mean crystallite sizes for the Co-Cr LDH, Cu@Co-Cr LDH, Pd@Co-Cr LDH, and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH were estimated to be 13.3, 13.1, 11.5, and 10.4 nm, respectively (Table 2). The LDHs synthesized using a 2 M solution of NaOH exhibited smaller crystallite sizes, which can be attributed to the lower concentration of the base. This observation is supported by the results of Reactions (6) to (8), which demonstrated the formation of a clear and intense blue solution when using 2 M NaOH, suggesting the generation of amphoteric components.\nCr(NO3)3\u00b79H2O + 6NaOH\u2192 Na3[Cr(OH)6] + 3NaNO3 + 9H2O (6)\nCo(NO3)2\u00b76H2O + 4NaOH\u2192 Na2[Co(OH)4] + 2NaNO3 + 6H2O (7)\nThe development of Co-Cr LDH might be disclosed by the following chemical Equation (8):\n3Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O + Cr(NO3)3\u00b79H2O + 6NaOH\u2192 Co3Cr[(OH)6]+3 \u00b7 3(NO3)\u2212 \u00b7 yH2O + 6NaNO3 (8)\nAdditionally, when the ionic radius of the cobalt and chromium ionic species are similar, fine crystalline LDH can develop using a low concentration of NaOH. In this work, we discovered that Co-Cr LDH also crystallizes more effectively when there are two ions with an identical ionic radius of 0.79 \u00c5 for Co(II) and 0.76 \u00c5 for Cr(III). The response process described above illustrates one potential cause. The (003) basal spacing and average particle size of the CoCr-LDH structure decreased when 2M NaOH was\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 8 of 19\nused in the experiment [46\u201348]. A presumable reason is disclosed in the aforementioned mechanism [49\u201352]. To explore the oxidation state of the pristine Co-Cr LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH, XPS experiments were conducted (Figure 2). The survey XPS spectrum and the core-level spectrum (Figure 2A) disclose that the Co-Cr LDH comprised the elements Cr, Co, and O. In the case of the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH (Figure 2A), in the survey spectrum typical distinctive peaks of Pd, Cu, Cr, Co, and O elements can be identified. The Co2p deconvolution spectra of Co-Cr LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH might be modeled by two wider spin-orbit doublets (Figure 2B). The Co-Cr LDH spectrum exhibits two distinct signals at 780.57 and 796.18 eV, corresponding to the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 orbitals, respectively. Additionally, there are minor peaks at 785.87 and 803.23 eV, which are associated with the shoulders of the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 signals. In comparison, the peaks for the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 orbitals in the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH show a shift to 781.31 and 797.54 eV, respectively. This shift indicates a strong interaction between the LDH and the Cu and Pd nanoparticles [49\u201352]. The altered positions of these peaks suggest changes in the electronic environment and bonding characteristics of cobalt in the presence of the Pd and Cu nanoparticles. For the Cr2p spectra (Figure 2C), the peak positions of Cr2p3/2 (577.31 eV) and Cr p1/2 (587.41 eV) for the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH also positionally shifted compared with those of the Co-Cr LDH (577.11 and 586.84 eV, respectively). The shift in the peak positions could also be attributed to the robust interaction of the loaded NPs with the LDH. The binding energy of Cr 2p at 577.31 eV could be related to the Cr-O and Cr-OH, which suggest that the majority of the Cr3+ (70%) and Cr6+ (the remaining 30%) were present. Figure 2D illustrates the division of the O 1s signals into distinct peaks for both Co-Cr LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH. The binding energies of 531.19 eV and 531.69 eV can be attributed to the hydroxyl form (OHgroup) for the pure Co-Cr LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH, respectively [53]. The observed peak shift in the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH can be ascribed to the electron transfer occurring between the nanoparticles (NPs) and the LDH matrix. The shifts in the binding peaks of Cr 2p, Co 2p, and O 1s between the pristine LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH indicate the presence of chemical interactions rather than a simple physical mixing state. These position changes suggest alterations in the electronic environment and bonding characteristics within the LDH structure upon the introduction of the Pd and Cu nanoparticles. In the case of the high-resolution XPS spectra of copper (Figure 2E), there were two sets of 2p bands: Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 at binding energies of 933.9 and 951.7 eV, respectively. This could be attributed to the presence of copper with low valance, which comprises Cu and Cu+. Meanwhile, the feeble bands of Cu 2p3/2 at 936.1 eV and Cu 2p1/2 at 955.1 eV, together with the satellite band at 942.8 eV, are typical features of Cu2+, which are the result of the eventual oxidation of Cu/Cu+ species in these nanocomposites. In Figure 2F of the Pd3d spectra, the prepared Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH displays two sets of peaks for Pd3d5/2 and Pd3d3/2. The low-energy Pd3d5/2 peak deconvoluted into doublets at 335.3 and 336.2 eV, which are associated with a mixture of Pd0 and Pd2+. On the other hand, the Pd 3d3/2 shows two bands at 340.5 and 341.2 eV, which are linked to a mixture of Pd\u25e6 and Pd2+. The atomic surface content is estimated to be 80.4% for Pd0 and 17.8% for Pd (II). The presence of PdO2 species is likely due to the oxidation of the exposed Pd nanoparticles during preparation, leading to substantial oxidation of the catalyst surface and resulting in the oxide state of Pd, namely, PdO2 (1.8%) [40].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 9 of 19\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 20 and Cr6+ (the remaining 30%) were present.

The TGA thermogram of the pristine Co-Cr LDH exhibited three-step weight loss. The initial weight loss of approximately 13.4% at appr ximately 213 \u25e6C was attributed to the removal f intercalated and weakly bound physically adsorbed water (H2O). As the temperature increased from 213 to 315 \u25e6C, a significant weight loss of about 15.4% occurred, which was associated with the loss of nitrate anions. The third weight loss step, observed above 315 \u25e6C, was attributed to the dehydroxylation process of the LDH. Similarly, for the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH, the TGA profile also showed three distinct stages of weight loss. The first weight loss, at approximately 213 \u25e6C, was attributed to the detachment of loosely bound H2O molecules from LDH. The second step, accounting for a weight loss of 15.8%, occurred up to 350 \u25e6C and corresponded to the removal of the interlayer of H2O and nitrate anions. The final weight loss step (17.29%) up to 600 \u25e6C was related to the dehydroxylation process, leading to the destruction of the layered structure. Notably, the TGA curve of the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH exhibited a similar decomposition pattern but with a higher total weight loss (46.59%).

As the temperature increased from 213 to 315 \u00b0C, a significant weight loss of about 15.4% occurred, which was associated with the loss of nitrate anions. The third weight loss step, observed above 315 \u00b0C, was attributed to the dehydroxylation process of the LDH. Similarly, for the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH, the TGA profile also showed three distinct stages of weight loss. The first weight loss, at approximately 213 \u00b0C, was attributed to the detachment of loosely bound H2O molecules from LDH. The second step, accounting for a weight loss of 15.8%, occurred up to 350 \u00b0C and corresponded to the removal of the interlayer of H2O and nitrate anions. The final weight loss step (17.29%) up to 600 \u00b0C was related to the dehydroxylation process, leading to the destruction of the layered structure. Notably, the TGA curve of the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH exhibited a similar decomposition pattern but with a higher total weight loss (46.59%). This increased weight loss in the TGA curve clearly indicates the formation of the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH nanocomposite.\nFigure 3.

All of the LDHs possessed type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, which are characteristics of plate-like particles and mesoporous materials (Figure 4A).

Figure 6A,B display the TEM, HRTEM, and the particle size distribution of the pristine Co-Cr LDH and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDHs. The pristine Co-Cr LDH displays irregular hexagonal nanoplatelets. The LDH interlayers are stacked together. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image reveals lattice spacing corresponding to the reflection planes of the LDH structure. Specifically, the lattice fringe was measured to be 0.23 nm, corresponding to the (015) plane of the Co-Cr LDH. Following the immobilization of the Pd-Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the LDH surface, distinct dark spots representing the Pd-Cu NPs can be observed to be uniformly distributed across the sample. The size distribution of the Pd-Cu NPs, as shown in the histogram (Figure 6B, inset), indicates a predominant population with an average size of 2.6 nm. Another HRTEM image (Figure 6B) was captured, revealing the lattice fringes corresponding to the different crystal planes. A lattice fringe measurement of 0.23 nm is assigned to the (015) plane of the Co-Cr LDH, while a lattice fringe of 0.21 nm corresponds to the (111) plane of the Pd NPs.

The performance of the bimetallic catalysts\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 14 of 19\nshowed significant differences compared to that of monometallic catalysts. The efficacy on the bimetallic catalysts was higher than that on the Cu@Co-Cr LDH and Pd@Co-Cr LDH. Generally, in catalysis, the oxidation state of the metal species have a significant impact on their reactivity and selectivity. In the case of copper and palladium, these metals can exist in different oxidation states, which can influence their activity in catalytic reactions. Copper can exist in various oxidation states, comprising Cu(0), Cu(I), and Cu(II). Cu(0) is metallic copper with no charge, while Cu(+) is a monovalent copper ion with a positive charge. The oxidation state of copper can influence its activity in catalysis, with Cu(0) often exhibiting superior catalytic activity compared to other oxidation states. Similarly, palladium can also exist in different oxidation states, including Pd(0), Pd(II), and Pd(IV). Pd(0) is metallic palladium with no charge, while Pd(II) is a divalent palladium ion with a positive charge. The oxidation state of palladium can also have a significant impact on its catalytic activity, with Pd(0) often exhibiting superior activity compared to Pd(II) and other oxidation states. In our case, the existence of both Cu(0) and Cu(+) in the catalyst and both Pd(0) and Pd(II) suggests that these metals could be playing different roles in the catalytic reaction. Additionally, the sol immobilization approach produced particles with a smaller size (approximately 2.6 nm) and a narrower size distribution of the particle, which was anticipated to affect the catalyst activity. Therefore, we believe that the distribution of the particle size is the main parameter controlling the catalyst efficacy. The results were compared with previous studies and are presented in Table 5. Notably, under comparable reaction conditions, the bimetallic combination of Cu and Pd supported on Co-Cr LDH exhibited the highest efficacy in the alcohol oxidation, surpassing other previously reported catalytic materials [51\u201355]. One potential reaction pathway for the alcohol oxidation over the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles (Pd-Cu) is as follows: the surface reaction of the O-H species from the alcohol with the unsaturated edge atoms of Pd(0) and Cu(0) produces a bimetallic alcoholate. This alcoholate then undergoes \u03b2-hydride removal to produce the aldehyde and hydride components in the subsequent step. Finally, the hydride component reacts with dioxygen to regenerate the zero-valence metallic nanoparticles, resulting in the liberation of H2O.\nUnder green conditions, the catalysts\u2019 reusability was investigated at 1 bar of O2 for 4 h at 120 \u25e6C. Throughout four consecutive cycles using the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalyst, there was a noticeable reduction in the catalytic performance from 16% to 13%, while the benzaldehyde selectivity was close to 99.9% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cycles (Figure 8a). The cause of the noticeable drop in the catalytic efficacy could be imputed to a little loss of the catalyst during the separation step. We tested the stability processes of the spent catalyst after the 4th consecutive catalytic cycles with XRD, as shown in Figure 8b. As demonstrated in Figure 8b, the XRD analysis revealed that the patterns of the catalyst before and after the fourth consecutive cycles were identical, indicating the high durability of the catalyst. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of the benzyl alcohol oxidation at 120 \u25e6C using Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH was investigated through hot-filtration experiments, as shown in Figure 8c. To determine this, the reaction was conducted under optimal conditions, and after 60 min, the catalyst was filtered out, allowing the reaction to continue in the filtrate under the same conditions.

Catalytic Activity for Nitrobenzene (NB) Reduction The catalytic performance of the Co-Cr LDH, Cu@Co-Cr LDH, Pd@Co-Cr LDH, and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH nanocomposites were quantitatively explored with a reduction of the NB into aniline (AN) by NaBH4 as a model reaction. The time-dependent UV-Vis absorption spectra might be used to readily monitor this reaction, as depicted in Figure 9. The blend of NaBH4 and NB exhibited a prominent band at 270 nm in the absence of the catalysts. The inclusion of the catalysts in the reaction mixture led to a rapid decline in the absorption band of NB at 270 nm, while the band at 230 nm corresponding to the reduced component, aniline, increased. Because the initial concentration of NaBH4 was considerably higher than that of nitrobenzene, the catalytic rate constant was determined using a pseudo-first-order model. Since, the band intensity at 270 nm decreased over time, it was possible to measure the rate constant (k) and the half-life time (t1/2) by adopting Equation (5). Figure 9a\u2013d depict the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the NB reduced by NaBH4; Figure 9a depicts the respective plots of the ln(C/Co) of NB against time in the presence of the Co-Cr LDH, Cu@Co-Cr LDH, Pd@Co-Cr LDH, and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH nanocomposites; and Figure 9b displays the conversion percentage of NB to AN at various reaction times.\nFigur 8.

From the linear relationships of ln(Ct/Co), depicted in Figure 10a, the greatest rate constant, k, for this reaction was 0.0921 min\u22121 for the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalyst, which is extremely high compared to 0.0073 min\u22121 for the pristine Co-Cr LDH. All of the nanocomposites showed strong linear correlations of ln(Ct/Co) against time (R2 > 0.955), supporting the pseudo-first-order kinetics (Figure 10a). It should be noted that the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH displayed the highest catalytic performance with only 15 min to attain a 98.2% conversion (Figure 10b), while the Co-Cr LDH exhibited the smallest catalytic performance and was unable to completely reduce NB even with 30 min (Figure 9b). This research shows that the integrated impact of the bimetallic Pd-Cu alloy-based nanocomposite created a unique platform for superior catalytic performance towards the NB reduction. The enhanced catalytic performance resulted from the great adsorption affinity of the LDH for NB, which resulted in a high content of NB close to the Pd-Cu and boosted the rate of reduction. As a result, both the Co-Cr LDH and bimetallic NPs were necessary for the catalytic activity of the prepared nanocomposites. The findings demonstrated that the reduction pathway occurred under the influence of stirring nitrophenol, NaBH4, and Pd-Cu@Co-Cr LDH catalyst. This mechanism involves the attachment of the acceptor moiety (nitrophenolate\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1956 16 of 19\nion) to the catalyst\u2019s surface and the generation of active hydrogen by the donor BH4\u2212. The produced active hydrogen converts the bound nitrophenolate species to amino derivatives and, ultimately, the resulting 4-aminophenol detaches from the Pd-Cu@Co-Cr surface. The LDH facilitates efficient electron transfer from the boron hydride ion (BH4\u2212) to the bimetallic surface, while the bimetallic NPs (Pd-Cu) provide the necessary active hydrogen for the reduction of the nitrophenolate ion to 4-AP.
