The obtained products have been characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, UV-Vis DRS, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. The results showed that the intimate contact of MCC and CdS is beneficial for enhancing the photocatalytic performance because heterojunction formation can efficiently promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes of the nanocomposite photocatalyst. By using 10% MCC coupled CdS, the decoloration rate of methylene blue (MB) in the solution under visible-light was increased nearly 50%. In addition, the reuse experiments confirmed that the CdS/MCC nanocomposite photocatalyst had outstanding cycle performance and durability. Mechanism study demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals, photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals were the active species in the photocatalytic oxidization degradation of MB.\nKeywords: cds, microcrystalline cellulose, visible-light photocatalysis, MB decolorization, charge separation\nINTRODUCTION\nSince TiO2 as a photocatalytic material for water decomposition in 1972, photocatalysis has attracted great interest and is recognized as a promising strategy for treating pollutants because it is highly effective, low cost and environmentally friendly (Liu et al., 2021; Mohua Li et al., 2020b; Ren et al., 2022; Fang Li et al., 2020). In view of the drawbacks of TiO2 (especially it can only utilize ultravioletlight from the Sun) (Sheng et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020), narrow bandgap visiblelight-active semiconductors such as BiOBr, BiOI, SnS2, CdS, g-C3N4, etc. have been increasingly studied as photocatalysts and their photocatalytic mechanisms have been explored in numerous published works (Yang et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2017; Silva-Gaspar et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Beyhaqi et al., 2021). For developing efficient visible-light-active photocatalyst, CdS is one of the extensively studied semiconductor materials because its bandgap matches well with the spectrum of visible light\nEdited by: Qingyi Zeng,\nUniversity of South China, China\nReviewed by: Li Yuhan,\nChongqing Technology and Business University, China\nYanbiao Liu, Donghua University, China\n*Correspondence: Chaosheng Zhu zhuchsh@foxmail.com Yongcai Zhang\nzhangyc@yzu.edu.cn Jin Liu liuzejin1026@126.com\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nInorganic Chemistry, a section of the journal Frontiers in Chemistry\nReceived: 09 March 2022 Accepted: 21 March 2022 Published: 06 April 2022\nCitation: Zhu C, Zhang X, Zhang Y, Li Y, Wang P, Jia Y and Liu J (2022) Ultrasonic-Assisted Synthesis of CdS/ Microcrystalline Cellulose\nNanocomposites With Enhanced Visible-Light-Driven Photocatalytic\nDegradation of MB and the Corresponding Mechanism Study.

However, the photocatalytic efficiency of CdS is fairly poor by reason of the fast recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons (Gurugubelli et al., 2022). Additionally, CdS nanoparticles are prone to encounter photocorrosion, namely, the surface sulfide ions can be oxidized to sulfur by photogenerated holes under the irradiation (Ning and Lu, 2020). In consideration of that photocatalytic reactions occur on the surface of CdS, necessary modifications are needed to stabilize the surface sulfide ions and to transfer the photogenerated holes out from the surface in order to suppress photocorrosion (Jiang et al., 2021). Many measures have been devoted to improving the photocatalytic efficiency and inhibiting the photocorrosion of CdS, like changing the surface structure of CdS nanoparticles by controlling morphology (Liu et al., 2021), doping with noble metal (Nawrot et al., 2020), combining with other semiconductors or organic polymers (Kiani et al., 2020). Among all the modification measures, combining with organic substances (especially conjugated polymers) shows great advantages owing to their excellent characteristics (Zhang et al., 2020). Polymers can provide a suitable cyberspace so as to limit the continuous growth of crystalline grain and prevent the particle aggregation. Moreover, the high stability, simple synthesis and good environmental compatibility of polymers are helpful for practical application (Chen et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2021). Besides, the CdS/conjugated polymer nanocomposites possess better machinability and optical performance (Lee and Chang, 2019; Melinte et al., 2019).\nCellulose, as one of renewable resources on the Earth and the most abundant natural polymers (Tian Li et al., 2021), has been widely investigated as a modifier for semiconductors because of its distinctive properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradation, mechanical strength, and chemical stability (Jiang et al., 2019). Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) is a kind of common organic conjugated polymers, which was obtained by\npurifying and depolymerizing cellulose. It possesses a lot of properties that eligible for modifying semiconductors, such as large surface area for interaction with water, water insolubility, high water absorption and retention capacity, good blinding nature, remarkable ability to prevent phase separation (Zhou et al., 2019; Amaly et al., 2022). Because of the above advantages, MCC has been considered as a promising material to modify semiconductor photocatalysts for enhanced water purification performance.\nIn this work, a simple and efficient ultrasound approach was designed to synthesize CdS/MCC nanocomposites. The photocatalytic activity of the products was tested based on the decoloration of MB aqueous solution under visible-light. The degradation mechanism of MB over CdS/MCC nanocomposite was also explored."

Compared with the standard XRD peaks of cubic phase CdS (JCPDS file No. 80\u20130019) and hexagonal phase CdS (JCPDS file No. 800\u20130006), the synthesized CdS comprised a mixture of major cubic phase and minor hexagonal phase. The peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 26.5\u00b0, 44.0\u00b0, and 52.1\u00b0 were in turn assigned to the (111), (220), and (311) planes of cubic phase CdS. The weaker peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 26.7\u00b0 and 28.3\u00b0 corresponded to the (111) and (101) planes of hexagonal phase CdS (Kong et al., 2022), respectively.\nThe XRD pattern of MCC showed sharp and high peaks, which revealed that the MCC itself has excellent crystallization. As for the various CdS/MCC composites, they display similar XRD spectra to mere CdS. Apparently, the XRD peaks of MCC did not appear in the XRD spectra of the CdS/MCC-3% and CdS/ MCC-7% samples, whichmay be because that the minor amounts of MCC cannot be detected by the XRD equipment. When the MCC content is more than 10%, the significant (100) peak of MCC at a 2\u03b8 value of 22.5\u00b0 begins to appear in the CdS/MCC composites. This confirmed that the MCC was successfully introduced to CdS and had formed CdS/MCC composites. Nevertheless, the introduction of MCC caused not shift of the XRD peak positions of CdS in the CdS/MCC composites, which suggested that MCC is not doped into the lattice of CdS nanocrystals.\nThe morphology, size and elemental compositions of the products were investigated using FE-SEM, TEM, and EDS.

Figure 5A and Figure 5B displays the degradation of MB photocatalyzed by pure CdS, MCC and CdS/MCC composites under visible-light. From tte figures, MCC has strong adsorption capacity for MB, but almost no photocatalytic effect. The photocatalytic performance of CdS/MCC composites (especially the CdS/ MCC-10% sample) improved significantly compared with CdS. When irradiated for 60 min, the CdS/MCC-10% sample has degraded 81.5% of the initial MB aqueous solution while the pure CdS degraded about 58.8%. When the MCC contents in the CdS/MCC composites were 3, 7, and 12%, the photodegradation rates of MB were lower than that over the CdS/MCC-10% sample. This suggests that MCC/CdS10% had the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity compared with other CdS/MCC composites. Hence, there is an optimum MCC content for CdS/MCC composite to reach the most efficient visible-light photocatalysis. When the combined MCC was excess, the MCC sites may also function as photogenerated charge recombination centers. Accordingly, the excessive MCC sites can significantly reduce the amount of photogenerated charges and decrease the visible-light photocatalytic efficiency of CdS/MCC composites. Nevertheless, too less MCC content in the CdS/ MCC composites resulted in less active sites, which also decreased the photocatalytic efficiency. Besides, the MB adsorption by CdS/MCC nanocomposites improved compared with pure CdS, which is consistent with the result of Nitrogen adsorption analysis."

The experimental procedure was the same as the photocatalytic activity test, but 50 ml of mixture of MB solution and scavenger, instead of 50 ml of MB solution was used. BQ (0.001 mol/L), TEOA (0.01 mol/L), and IPA (0.02 mol/L), were introduced into the reaction system as the scavengers for \u2022O2\u2212, h+, and \u2022OH (Zhu et al., 2016; Gao et al., 2021), respectively. As can be clearly seen from Figure 7, the presence of TEOA, IPA and BQ all remarkably reduces the photocatalytic decolorization efficiency of MB under the same condition, which suggests that all \u2022O2\u2212, h+, and \u2022OH participated in the decolorization reactions of MB. However, the photocatalytic degradation rate of MB after the addition of IPA is the slowest, indicating that \u2022OH played a major role in the photocatalytic degradation of MB by CdS/MCC composite.\nTo verify the above experiment results, the generated \u2022OH and \u2022O2\u2212 species in the photocatalytic process were inspected by COU photoluminescence probing and NBT transformation techniques, respectively. As \u2022OH can react with COU to generate strongly fluorescent substance (7- hydroxycoumarin), the generation of \u2022OH in the lightirradiated CdS/MCC-10% aqueous suspension was detected using fluorescent probe technique. In this experiment, a 50 ml COU solution (0.1 g/L) replaced the 50 ml MB solution. The supernatant was monitored directly using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (the excitation wavelength is 340 nm). The PL intensities emitted by the mixture of CdS/MCC-10% and COU solution at different visible-light irradiation times are shown in Figure 8A. Clearly, the PL intensity of the generated 7-hydroxycoumarin at about 453 nm became stronger as the irradiation time increased. These results indicated that the \u2022OH radicals were produced and they might act as the predominant active oxygen species during the photocatalytic process (Wang et al., 2020). The \u2022O2\u2212 radicals in the mixture of 50 mg CdS/MCC-10% and 50 ml 0.01 mmol/L NBT solution under light irradiation were determined employing NBT (Shi et al., 2020; Du et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2021). The time-varying absorption spectra of NBT in the presence of CdS/MCC-10% and visible-light are shown in Figure 8B. The maximum absorbance of NBT at 260 nm decreased fastly as the irradiation time increased, indicating the formation of \u2022O2\u2212 in the CdS/MCC-10% system under visible-light.\nBased on the above analysis, the photodegradation processes of MB over the CdS/MCC composite photocatalyst are interpreted in Figure 9. The photogenerated electrons and the photogenerated holes are produced respectively in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of CdS/MCC by excitation with visible-light (Eq. 2). Meanwhile a portion of the photogenerated charges would recombine. When MB molecules were adsorbed on the surface of CdS/MCC composite and excited, they would deliver electrons to the CB of CdS/MCC composites. The VB holes of CdS/MCC can oxidize MB (Eq. 3), or react with the surface bound OH\u2212 (or by H2O) to generate \u2022OH (Eqs 4, 5) (Liu et al., 2022). The \u2022OH can attack the chromophoric structure and the diethylamino groups effectively, causing the cycloreversion of MB molecules (Eq. 6) (Sun et al., 2021) as well as final mineralization into CO2, H2O, and other inorganic substances. Besides, the highly reducing electrons in the CB of CdS/MCC can reduce O2 to \u2022O2\u2212 (Yao et al., 2020), which are also able to oxidize MB (Eqs 7, 8). The MCC can transfer electrons from its excited energy level to the CB of CdS, increasing the reactive oxygen species (\u2022O2\u2212) and reducing electron-hole recombination (Hasanpour et al., 2021). Moreover, the heterojunction formed between the two components of the synthesized CdS/MCC nanocomposite (Figure 2C) also favors the charge separation.\nCdS + hv \u2192 h+ + e\u2212 (2) MB + h+ \u2192 oxide product (3)\nh+ +OH\u2212 \u2192 \u2022OH (4) h+ +H2O \u2192 \u2022OH +H+ (5) \u2022OH +MB \u2192 oxide product (6) e\u2212 +O2 \u2192 \u2022O\u22122 (7) \u2022O\u22122 +MB \u2192 oxide product (8)"

            "text": "CdS/MCC nanocomposite photocatalyst has been successfully prepared by a mild and simple sonochemical method. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of the prepared products was also assessed. The results indicated that the synthesized CdS/MCC nanocomposite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, and the optimum content of MCC in the CdS/MCC nanocomposite was found to be 10%. When irradiated by visible-light for 60 min, CdS/MCC-10% can catalyze the degradation of 81.5% of MB, much higher than pure CdS. The boosted photocatalytic efficiency of CdS/MCC10% was likely resulted from the tight junction between CdS and MCC and the larger surface area. Furthermore, the radicals capture experiments, NBT transformation and coumarin photoluminescence probing suggested that \u2022OH was the dominant active oxygen species in the photocatalytic degradation of MB by CdS/MCC-10%. Our research provides evidence that the modification with MCC can efficiently improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors (such as CdS).\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8926807"
