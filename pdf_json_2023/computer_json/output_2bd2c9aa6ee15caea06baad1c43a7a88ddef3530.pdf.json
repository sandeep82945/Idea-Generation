    "abstractText": "This paper investigates the problem of traffic surveillance using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and proposes a domain-knowledge-aided airborne ground moving targets tracking algorithm. To improve the accuracy of multiple targets tracking, the proposed algorithm incorporates domain knowledge into the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter as state constraints. The domain knowledge considered in this paper includes both road information extracted from a given map and local traffic regulations. Conventional track update method is modified to enhance the capability of recognition of temporarily track loss. A variable structure multiple model (VS-MM) method is developed to assign the road segment to a given target. The effectiveness of proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations.",

            "text": "Small-scale UAVs have been widely-used in many military and civilian applications in recent years, e.g., urban crowd surveillance [41, 44], ground vehicles monitoring [34, 45, 25, 30], search and rescue [5, 23], wild-land fire management [10], and borders surveillance [27]. One of the key enablers to improve the level of autonomy for UAV is autonomous ground targets tracking, which aims to find the states of targets of interest from the time history of noisy onboard measurements. Notice that this is a constrained nonlinear multiple targets tracking problem, where the constraints are topological limits and local traffic regulations. Up to now, this problem has not been well solved and requires new advances on many techniques involving constrained nonlinear state estimation, data association, track confirmation and termination.\nIn airborne target tracking, the sensor measurement is generally nonlinear with respect to the target state and many elegant nonlinear estimation filters are reported in the literature for this application. The authors in [30, 17] utilized an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the state of a single ground vehicle and the estimated information was used to analyze the behavior of the vehicle. A constraint particle filter was developed in [29] to predict the target existence area, guaranteeing that the target of interest remains tracked by UAVs. Reference [45] utilized Recursive Bayesian estimation (RBE) for target state estimation, and proposed a novel method to approximate the likelihood\n\u2217Corresponding Author.Email: shaoming.he@bit.edu.cn\nar X\niv :2\n30 3.\n06 59\n3v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\ndensity corresponding to no detection cases. To improve the estimation performance with high nonlinearity, a particle filter (PF) was proposed in [26] for ground moving targets tracking over a finite horizon. The authors [32] and [39] leveraged an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter [7] as a baseline for maneuvering target tracking. Reference [20] integrated variable structure IMM with EKF for a specific application of tracking move-stop-move target with airborne ground moving target indicator. However, most previous studies of airborne ground target tracking generally focus on single target tracking approaches. Realistic scenarios are often encountered with the multiple ground moving targets tracking problem and this is much more challenging than a single target due to data association uncertainty, constraint handling, track confirmation, deletion and continuation [25, 42, 11, 2].\nTechnically speaking, the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm, first proposed in [33], is believed to be the Bayesian optimal filter for multiple targets tracking [12]. Although it is recognized that MHT can track multiple targets with high accuracy by a delayed decision logic[22, 19, 31], the computational complexity of MHT prohibits its application in the small-scale UAVs with limited computational resource. Compared to the MHT, the joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) algorithm provides satisfactory performance with reduced computational burden for multiple target tracking in a cluttered environment [13, 3, 16]. However, the original JPDA assumes that the number of targets is known in advance and constant across the tracking process. To relax this assumption, the authors in [14, 15] leveraged a modified JPDA that utilizes probabilistic birth model for new born target confirmation and death target termination. However, applying existing JPDA or its variants in ground vehicle surveillance still face with two challenges. On one hand, the moving trajectory of a ground vehicle is naturally constrained by the topological pattern and local traffic regulations. Incorporating this domain knowledge as state constraint in JPDA is helpful to improve the estimation performance. Even though there are some studies about constraint filter design [37, 1, 38, 43, 21, 35], these algorithms are only dedicated to single target tracking and the extension to multiple targets tracking requires careful adjustment. On the other hand, the conventional track update logic [14], capable of recognizing targets that are covered by possible birth regions, fails to reconfirming temporarily disappeared targets, which are typical phenomena in our application scenarios due to occasional blocking by buildings or trees.\nIn this paper, a novel domain-knowledge-aided airborne ground moving targets tracking algorithm is proposed to fill the gap identified above. We approximate each road at the surveillance region by multiple straight-line segments, and the geographic information (e.g., heading direction) of each segment is extracted as domain knowledge. A new JPDA variant that actively leverages the domain knowledge, i.e., topological information and local traffic regulations, as state constraints is developed to improve the estimation performance. A modified track update approach is then proposed to ensure that the reappeared targets on the midway of a road can be confirmed with proper constraints. Variable structure multiple model (VS-MM) algorithm is utilized for associating targets with correct segment constraint models. By considering that a vehicle moves on a specific road segment as a constraint hypothesis, the VS-MM concept is leveraged for hypothesis propagation and a hard decision logic is suggested for hypothesis determination. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with extensive numerical simulations with various different conditions.\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold. On one hand, we propose a complete VS-MM tracking algorithm for multiple ground vehicles tracking. The algorithm is capable of new born target initialization, data association, state estimation, dead track deletion, reappeared target recognition, constraint handling and mode propagation. On the other hand, external domain knowledge information is extracted, modeled and integrated into the JPDA filter for constrained multiple targets tracking. This is demonstrated to significantly improve the estimation performance by providing reliable and robust tracking quality across various different conditions.\nThe remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some backgrounds and preliminaries of this paper. Section 3 extracts map information through a road approximation method. A modified JPDA filter which is integrated with multiple constraints and able to reconfirm temporarily disappeared targets is proposed in Section 4. Section 5 develops an approach using VS-MM concept for constraint hypothesis determination. The numerical simulations are presented in Section 6. Finally, some conclusions are given in Section 7."

            "text": "This section approximates the roads from a given map by 2-D line segments that will be utilized as domain knowledge to formulate the state constraints. We first propose an algorithm to show how to approximate a given road with multiple straight-line segments and then present an application example of the proposed algorithm.\nThe coordinates of equally-spaced discrete geographical points which belong to the road center-line in the geographic coordinate system (GCS) are extracted and converted to the Cartesian coordinate system (CCS) through Gauss\u2013Kru\u0308ger projection [18, 24]. Note that the number of discrete geographical points depends on the scale of the map and the shape of the road. The mathematical road model can then be formulated by applying polynomial fitting to the set of geographical points extracted from the map. However, it is worthy pointing out that the road shape could be\nextremely irregular, as shown in Fig. 3, where \u03b1 \u2208 (\u221290\u25e6, 270\u25e6) denotes the angle between the tangential direction at the discrete point and the positive direction of the X-axis. For the purposes of polynomial fitting, we define a new indicator, denoted by \u2135, to evaluate of orientation change of the road as{\u2135 = 1, \u221290\u25e6 < \u03b1 < 90\u25e6\n\u2135 = \u22121, 90\u25e6 < \u03b1 < 270\u25e6 (5)\nWe then split the road into several parts with each road part provides same \u2135, as shown in Fig. 3, where \u2135 = 1 for Parts 1, 3 and \u2135 = \u22121 for Parts 2, 4. The polynomial function with order Np is leveraged to approximate one specific road part as\nf(x) = Np\u2211 m=0 amx m (6)\nwhere am stands for the coefficients of the polynomial of the considered road part. Depending on the curvature of the road part, we can leverage different polynomials by tuning the value of Np to reach certain approximation accuracy. Obviously, increasing Np provides more accurate road approximation at the price of more computational burden and hence Np is a trade-off parameter for road approximation.\n3.0.1 Np \u2264 1 For the case where the road part is modeled as a straight-line segment, the majority of geographical information required for constraining the vehicle\u2019s states can be obtained from two boundary points, i.e., starting point ss = [xs, f(xs)] T and terminal point st = [xt, f(xt)] T. For an arbitrary discrete point s = [x, f(x)]T that locates on the straight line connecting ss and terminal point st, we have s \u2208 \u03b6 with \u03b6 = {lst + (1\u2212 l)ss|\u2200l \u2208 [0, 1]} and [\u2212 tan(\u03d1), 1]s = \u03ba (7a)\nwhere \u03d1 and \u03ba, respectively, denote the orientation angle and the intercept of the corresponding straight line as\n\u03d1 = arctan\n( f(xt)\u2212 f(xs)\nxt \u2212 xs\n) (7b)\n\u03ba = \u2212 tan(\u03d1)xs + f(xs) (7c)\n3.0.2 Np > 1\nIf the curvature of the road part cannot be omitted, using straight line to approximate the road might result in big approximation errors and hence it is desirable to leverage higher-order polynomials in road modeling. This, in turn, might impose nonlinear geographical constraint on target state estimation. Even though there exist some estimation algorithms nonlinear constraints reported in the literature [40, 43], there are few methods that provide the capability to handle higher-order nonlinear constraints. Besides, applying nonlinear constraints for the state estimation is computationally costly, which is undesirable for small-scale UAVs in practice. Hence, approximating the curve road part by\nmultiple straight line segments with a certain degree of precision is more practical. Given a higher-order polynomial function f(x), the accumulated heading change, denoted by \u2206\u03b4, from one point s1 = [x1, f(x1)]\nT to another point s2 = [x2, f(x2)] T can be determined by\n\u2206\u03b4 = \u222b x2 x1\nf \u2032\u2032(x)\n1 + [f \u2032(x)] 2 dx (8)\nFor one specific curved road part, we start from its initial point ss = [xs, f(xs)] T to evaluate Eq. (8) until \u2206\u03b4 > \u03b4m with \u03b4m being the upper threshold of the road heading change that a straight line can approximate with certain degree of accuracy. The straight line that connects the initial point and the cutting point constitutes the first segment of the considered road part. Now, starting from the cutting point we can then find another endpoint that by evaluating Eq. (8). By repeating this procedure until the terminal point st = [xt, f(xt)]\nT of the road part is reached, we can find multiple straight line segments to approximate the road part. Once all road parts are explored, the road can be approximated by a poly-line composed of Ns straight line segments and the rth segment, denoted by \u03b6r, is fully determined by its start point sr = [xr, f(xr)] T and terminal point sr+1 = [xr+1, f(xr+1)] T. Notice that the terminal point of the Nsth segment coincides with the terminal point of the road, i.e., sNs+1 = st. Similar to Eq. (7), the orientation angle and the intercept of the rth segment, denoted by \u03d1r and \u03bar, are given by\n\u03d1r = arctan f(xr+1)\u2212 f(xr)\nxr+1 \u2212 xr (9)\n\u03bar = \u2212 tan(\u03d1)xr + f(xr) (10)\nAn illustration of road approximation results obtained from the proposed algorithm is presented in Fig. 4, where the roads locate in Kirkliston and are directly taken from Google earth. From this figure, it is clear that there exist four roads in the surveillance region with two from west to east and the other two from east to west, as shown in Fig. 4a. The tuning parameters required to implement the proposed algorithm are selected as Np = 6, \u03b4m = 3\u25e6. From Fig. 4b, we can clearly observe that the intensity of nodes is proportional to the road curvature driven by the required approximation accuracy."

One feasible joint association hypothesis satisfies that at most one measurement originates from a target and at most one target can be assigned to a measurement. Under the assumption that all targets are mutually independent, the theoretical posterior of the ith target can be obtained from the Bayesian rule as [9]\np(xik|\u03c7ik,Zk) = Mk\u2211 j=0 p(xik|\u03c9ik = j, \u03c7ik,Zk)\n\u00d7 p(\u03c9ik = j|\u03c7ik,Zk) (11)\nwhere \u03c7ik denotes the existence of the ith target at scan k, and \u03c9 i k stands for the association event with \u03c9 i k = j meaning that the jth measurement is associated to the ith target. The term p(xik|\u03c9ik = j, \u03c7ik,Zk) denotes the associationconditioned posterior density of the target state. This information can be extracted from a nonlinear estimation filter, e.g., EKF, in consideration of state constraints. The function p(\u03c9ik = j|\u03c7ik,Zk) represents the existence-conditioned marginal association probability and can readily determined by the Bayesian rule as\np(\u03c9ik = j|\u03c7ik,Zk) = p(\u03c7ik|\u03c9ik = j,Zk)p(\u03c9ik = j|Zk)\np(\u03c7ik|Zk) (12)\nwhere the denominator is the posterior probability of target existence, which is utilized to confirm a new track and terminate an existing track. The first term in the numerator of Eq. (12) is the association-conditioned target existence probability, which corresponds to data association status. The second term in the numerator represents conditional marginal association probability.\nSubstituting Eq. (12) into Eq.

The proposed modified JPDA filter mainly includes three modules: calculating the marginal association probability p(\u03c9ik = j|Zk), domain-knowledge-aided state estimation p(xik|\u03c9ik = j, \u03c7ik,Zk) and track confirmation/termination using p(\u03c7ik|Zk). Notice that enumerating all feasible joint association hypotheses is generally time-consuming and hence the ellipsoid gate technique is usually leveraged to reduce the number of feasible measurements in JPDA [4]."

This can be attributed to the fact the birth place in the considered ground moving targets tracking scenario locates at the boundary of the surveillance region. To address this problem, we modify the tracking logic to realize the recognition and confirmation of reappeared tracks. The disappeared track (confirmed before) will not be removed immediately and will stay tentative with its state being predicted within a time interval threshold td. The predicted state then acts as a testing point for the selection of measurements with a predetermined covariance matrix Pir. Hence, if a temporary disappeared target appears within the time interval td and its track existence probability is bigger than pe, then the track is confirmed and maintained; otherwise, it is terminated and will be removed, as shown in Fig. 5."

The velocity of each vehicle changes dynamically and remains in a certain range which is assumed to be known. The scenario depicted above is shown in Fig. 7. The parameters required in the simulations, unless otherwise specified, are shown in Table 2.

With bigger value of \u03b4m, e.g., \u03b4m = 10\u25e6, the road segmentation is sparse and straight line approximation errors cannot be omitted, hence providing poor tracking quality. On the contrary, when the value of \u03b4m is too small, e.g., \u03b4m = 1\u25e6 shown in Fig. 8, the tracking performance degrades dramatically.

From the recorded results, pu = 0.65 provides better estimation performance than the other four cases in terms of the OSPA distance.

We can also note from Fig. 10 that the mean update time corresponding to pu = 0.55 and 0.61 of all targets is smaller than the true update time, meaning the update is confirmed earlier than the real transformation, resulting in a sharp decrease in tracking accuracy, as shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4. This result reveals that the constraint hypothesis update is sensitive to the segment transformation and hence contributes to a premature confirmation of the upcoming segment if the value of pu is too small. Conversely, the constraint hypothesis update module is believed to be conservative when the exact segment transformation occurs with bigger value of pu: the vehicles are still believed to move on the segments which deviate away from the correct ones. This can be confirmed by the existence of a time delay of mean update time corresponding to pu = 0.71 and 0.76 compared with the real update time, as shown in Fig. 10)."

A vehicle returns no measurement once it enters into this blocked region.

However, only the algorithm incorporated with the modified track update approach can recognize reappeared targets as shown in Fig. 11. More specifically, it can be observed that some targets move into the blocked area at around 30s and 52s, and both methods believe the targets disappear. When the targets get through this blocked area and reappear at about 36s and 60s, the modified approach confirms these targets successfully while the conventional approach fails.\nNow, let us check the performance of the proposed track update logic with various reconfirmation time thresholds td=5s, 10s, 20s. Figure 12 presents the simulation results of OSPA, and Table 5 summarizes the statistics of the estimation errors. It is clear from this figure that when the value of td is small, the proposed approach might fail to confirm the reappeared target since the temporarily disappeared target is removed before it reappears, as shown in Fig. 12.

For this purpose, the proposed method integrated with four different constraint combinations is considered, i.e., Condition 1: no constraints are included; Condition 2: only velocity direction constraint is considered (corresponds to Case 1 in Table 1); Condition 3: velocity direction and position constraints are considered (corresponds to Case 4 in Table 1); and Condition 4: velocity direction, position and speed limit are constrained (cor-\nresponds to Case 7 in Table 1). The simulations are carried out with two different scenarios: unblocked and partially blocked. The blocked region remains the same as the previous subsection.\nSimulation results of OSPA distance and mean cardinality of the two different scenarios are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively. The statistics of the estimation errors are summarized in Table 6 for clarity. According to the simulation results, it is clear that the tracking performance is improved by incorporating multiple sources of domain knowledge. From Figs. 13 and 14, we can also observe that the estimation errors decrease with the more valuable constraint information. Interestingly, leveraging domain knowledge as state constraint in JPDA is helpful to recognize temporarily disappeared targets."

            "text": "In this paper, a novel multiple ground vehicle tracking method integrated with domain knowledge is proposed for automatic aerial surveillance by a UAV. The topography information of the surveillance region is extracted from the local map as domain knowledge. This information is incorporated into the JPDA filter as state constraints to improve the tracking performance. A modified track update method is also developed for the purpose of reconfirming\ntemporarily disappeared targets. In order to properly utilize the domain knowledge, the VS-MM concept is leveraged to allocate a target to a specific road segment. The numerical simulation results show the proposed algorithm provides reliable tracking of ground moving targets and the performance can be improved with a proper choice of the required tuning parameters."
