 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the impact of deamidation on other functional properties of pea proteins besides solubility and heat stability, such as emulsification, foaming, and gelation. The structural changes induced by deamidation could potentially improve these properties as well. 

2. Apply deamidation using PG enzyme to other plant protein sources such as soy, wheat, rice, etc. and evaluate how it affects their functionality. This could expand the applicability of this modification approach.

3. Study the effects of deamidation on the allergenicity and digestibility of pea proteins. The structural changes may alter the allergenic epitopes and susceptibility to digestive enzymes. 

4. Evaluate the sensory attributes of food products formulated with deamidated pea proteins compared to unmodified pea proteins. Check if the modification impacts taste, texture, appearance etc.

5. Conduct storage studies on deamidated pea proteins under different conditions and monitor changes in functionality over time. This could provide insights into the shelf-life and stability.
