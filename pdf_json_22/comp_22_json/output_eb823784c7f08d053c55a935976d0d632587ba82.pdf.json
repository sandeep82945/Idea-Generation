    "abstractText": "This work presents the energy advantages allowed by the technology and voltage scaling of spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memories (STT-MRAMs) based on perpendicular double-barrier magnetic tunnel junction (DMTJ), with two reference layers. DMTJ is benchmarked against the single-barrier MTJ (SMTJ) based alternative, and a comprehensive evaluation is carried out through a cross-layer simulation framework, considering a state-of-the-art Verilog-A based SMTJ and DMTJ compact models, along with a 0.8V FinFET technology. Simulation results show that thanks to the lower voltage operating point, DMTJ-based STT-MRAM allows energy savings for write/read operations of about 38%/45%, as compared to its SMTJ-based counterpart. Moreover, scaling from the 28nm down to the 20nm node, the DMTJ-based offers improvements in terms of write/read energy of about 29%/33% at the expense of longer access times.",

INTRODUCTION\nSpin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) technology has grown in popularity thanks to its promising features, which include a relatively large endurance, reduced area footprint, inherent non-volatility, compatibility with CMOS processes, and ability to operate at low-voltages [1]\u2013[3]. In addition to application domains such as standalone and embedded non-volatile memories (NVMs), where STT-MRAMs have shown maturity, embedded NV cache memory has shown interesting characteristics not only in studies based on conventional CMOS technology, but also in designs that use low-power technologies like FinFET and TFET [2], [4], [5], to cryogenic applications to enable lowpower computing [6]\u2013[8]. In particular, the study reported in [4] presents a fine-grained technology scaling study of STTMRAMs based on single- and double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) [SMTJ and DMTJ], along with FinFET technology. Despite the promising DMTJ-based STT-MRAM results in terms of energy, and based on the insight that DMTJ-based STT-MRAM cells can operate at much lower\nvoltages in contrast to SMTJ-based alternative [9], further energy improvements can be exploited.\nUnder this framework, we present the energy advantages allowed by the technology and voltage scaling of DMTJbased STT-MRAMs. In our study, DMTJ-based STT-MRAM is mainly compared against the SMTJ-based solution. The main results of this work demonstrate that, as compared to SMTJ-based STT-MRAM, the DMTJ-based proposal allows the memory architecture to operate at a lower voltage operating point, enabling energy savings of about 38% and 45% for write and read access times, respectively, at the cost of increased write/read access latency of about 47%/10%.\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section II briefly introduces single and double MTJ devices. Section III presents the simulation setup used in this work, and provides obtained results at bitcell- and memory architecturelevel. Finally, Section IV concludes this work."

            "text": "Fig. 1 shows the STT SMTJ and DMTJ, which consist of a stack of two and three ferromagnetic (FM) layers, respectively, along with thin oxide barrier/s between its FM layers [10], [11]. For the SMTJ (DMTJ) device (see Fig. 1(a) [Fig. 1(b)]), the top (top and bottom) FM layer, known as\nthe reference layer (RL) (RLT and RLB, respectively), has a fixed magnetization orientation. Both devices present one FM, known as free layer (FL), which has a variable magnetization orientation, i.e., parallel (P) or antiparallel (AP) with respect to that of the RL (two RLs in the DMTJ), thus giving rise to two possible states. For the SMTJ, the resistance states can be high (RH) [AP orientation] or low (RL) [P orientation], based on the relative orientation of magnetization of the RL and FL. Conversely, for the DMTJ, the RH and RL, or R1 and R0, respectively, correspond to the FL in P (AP) and AP (P) configurations with respect to that of the top and bottom RLs, respectively, and are calculated as R0 = RP,T + RAP,B and R1 = RAP,T + RP,B, where RP,T (B) and RAP,T (B) are the P and AP resistances associated with the top (bottom) barrier. In contrast to the SMTJ, thanks to the presence of the two RLs (i.e., RLT and RLB), the DMTJ presents an enhancement on the total torque acting on the FL [12], leading to lower switching currents [12], [13], at the cost of increased resistance (due to the extra oxide barrier), and reduced tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio [12].\nTable I reports the main SMTJ and DMTJ device parameters considered in this study. The two perpendicular MTJ structures have been coherently scaled, and described through on-purpose developed macrospin-based Verilog-A compact models [10], [11]. As stated in Table I, we take into account the effect of process variability on MTJ devices, considering Gaussian-distributed variations with a variability (\u03c3/\u00b5) of 5% and 3% for the MTJ cross-section area and TMR ratio, respectively, and 1% for tOX, tOX,T, tOX,B, and tFL [10]. Note, the data reported in Table I are referred to data provided in [4]. For a deep insight of the device-level modeling and analysis used in this work, we suggest the reader refer to [4]."

            "text": "Fig. 2 shows the two-stage simulation flow used in this analysis. At the circuit-level, we have carried out hybrid FinFET/STT-MTJ electrical simulations into Cadence Virtu-\noso environment using the Spectre simulator by exploiting a state-of-the-art Verilog-A based SMTJ and DMTJ compact models [10], [11], along with transistor models provided by a 28 nm down to 20 nm FinFET technology featuring a nominal supply voltage (VDD) of 0.8 V. For the bitcell-level analysis, we referred to the two complementary transistors one-MTJ (2T1MTJ) cells, which in addition to being the best write energy-efficient topologies according to the assessment carried out in [4], they help to mitigate the effect of source degeneration that affects the one-transistor one-MTJ configurations [1]. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2, we consider the 2T1MTJ bitcells in reverse connection (access transistors connected to FL) and standard connection (access transistors connected to RL) for SMTJ- and DMTJ-based bitcells, respectively. Bitcelllevel results are then exploited for evaluations in DESTINY memory architecture tool [14]. This latter, as shown in Fig. 2, is configured with one memory bank, consisting of an array of Mats, in which each one is composed of an array of sub-arrays, along with a predecoder. The sub-array is the core memory block that includes the bitcells and peripheral circuits. It is worth mentioning that DESTINY tool was properly calibrated for the considered FinFET technology node [15]."

            "text": "The bitcell solutions mentioned above (i.e., the SMTJ-based 2T1MTJ-RC and DMTJ-based 2T1MTJ-SC topologies) were analyzed in terms of read and write operations through exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations. Fig. 3 shows the technology and voltage scaling results for the write operation in terms of worst-case write delay (twrite) to ensure a target write error rate (WER) = 10\u22127 [refer to Fig. 3(a)-(b)] and the corresponding average write energy per access (Ewrite) [refer to Fig. 3(c)(d)] as a function of the voltage for both SMTJ- and DMTJbased bitcells for different technology nodes. The SMTJ- and DMTJ-based bitcells correspond to an area of 231 F2 and 131 F2, respectively1. Despite the fact that the write current decreases as the MTJ resistance increases with the shrink of the device from 28 nm down to 20 nm (refer to Table I), the scaling allows lower twrite, and therefore better energy savings\n1This is the optimal bitcell topology leading to lowest twrite and Ewrite at a nominal VDD (refer to [4])\nfor a given VDD, as shown in Fig. 3(a)-(b) and Fig. 3(c)(d), respectively. This is explained by the reduction of the critical switching current (Ic0) and thermal stability factor (\u2206), as reported in Table I. In addition to the benefits of the technology scaling, voltage scaling of the bitcell shows further energy improvements, since the voltage corresponding to the minimum energy point (MEP), VMEP, moves towards lower operating voltages as the technology node scales.\nFor the reading performance of the bitcells operating at the VMEP, we used the conventional voltage sensing (CVS) scheme [16]. The read current (Iread) is properly set to a value that is sufficiently lower than Ic0 to ensure a low read disturbance rate (RDR), which is the probability of unintentional flipping the stored bit of information during the read operation. The target RDR is 10\u22129 along with a read pulse width (tread) of 1 ns [16]. Afterwards, for the considered bitcell topologies and technology nodes, we have calculated the read energy (Eread) and voltage sensing margin (VSM), which is the difference of the VBL in high and low resistance states, i.e., VSM = VBL(AP)\u2013 VBL(P). Accordingly, Fig. 4 shows the technology and voltage scaling for the read operation in terms of VSM [refer to Fig. 4(a)] and normalized Eread [refer to Fig. 4(b)]. It is worth noting in Fig. 4 that the VSM remains almost the same when the bitcells are operating on either VDD or VMEP, mainly due to the adopted CVS scheme. When compared to the SMTJ-based bitcell, the DMTJ-based solution presents reduced voltage sensing margins (\u201359%, on average) with the technology scaling. From Fig. 4(b), in which each node is normalized to the bitcell operating at nominal voltage VDD = 0.8 V, the SMTJ-based bitcell at VMEP shows a slight difference as compared to the case at nominal VDD. This is because the VMEP of SMTJ-based bitcells is very close\nto the nominal VDD [see Fig. 3(c)]. Conversely, the VMEP of DMTJ-based bitcell is much lower (\u201332%, on average) than the nominal VDD, leading to reduced Eread of about 7.3%, on average.\nTable II summarizes the write and read bitcell-level results of the SMTJ- and DMTJ-based solutions while considering the bitcells operating at the MEP resulted from the technology-voltage scaling analysis. Performance results for write (@WER = 10\u22127) and read (@RDR = 10\u22129) operations show that, in contrast to SMTJ-based bitcell, DMTJ-based bitcells are more energy-efficient under write/read access of about 77%/42%, thanks to the lower voltage operating point (i.e., VMEP), at the cost of reduced (\u201360%) VSM and increased (34%) write delay. Despite the fact that the considered bitcells present small VSM, this issue can be addressed by employing different approaches [17]."

However, due to the SRAM higher interconnection complexity, this penalty is reduced for larger memory capacities. From these results, we choose a memory capacity of 512 kB, and evaluate the energy benefits allowed by the technology and voltage scaling. Accordingly, Fig. 5 shows the architecture-level comparative results in terms of access times [see Fig. 5(a)-(b)] and energy consumption per access [see Fig. 5(c)-(d)] obtained for different nodes.\nHere, the reported data considers STT-MRAMs operating at VMEP (refer to Table II), and normalized to its characteristics when operating at the nominal VDD. From Fig. 5(a)-(b), we can observe that in contrast to SMTJ-based STT-MRAM, the DMTJ-based solution exhibits a penalty in terms of write and read access times of about 47% and 10%, respectively, on average. Moreover, while the penalty in terms of read access time remains relatively low, the penalty in terms of write access is increased at more scaled nodes (90% at the 20 nm node) due to the lower VMEP allowed by the DMTJ-based alternative. This latter (i.e., lower VMEP), permits larger energy savings as shown in the normalized energy per access results of Fig. 5(c)-(d). Here, we can observe that, as compared to the SMTJ-based STT-MRAM, DMTJ-based counterpart has lower write and read energy of about 38% and 45%, respectively, on average. Finally, in addition to the above-mentioned energy benefits, leakage has been also evaluated, showing that leakage presented in STT-MRAM based on DMTJ memory is lower by 57% as compared to the SMTJ alternative."

Circuit-level comparative results demonstrate that, operating at the VMEP, DMTJ-based bitcells present better technology-voltage scalability, proving to be the most energyefficient solution under write/read access at the cost of reduced sensing margins and penalty in write delay. Obtained memory architecture-level results show that combining technology with voltage scaling, DMTJ-based STT-MRAM can enable potential read/write energy savings, at the cost of increased write/read access times. This indicates DMTJ-based STTMRAM to be a competitive candidate for low-power/voltage applications."
