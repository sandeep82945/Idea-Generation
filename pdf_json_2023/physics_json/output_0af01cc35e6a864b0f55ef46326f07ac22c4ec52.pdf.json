    "abstractText": "Insertion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the bacterial outer membrane (OM) is mediated by a druggable OM translocon consisting of a \u03b2-barrel membrane protein, LptD, and a lipoprotein, LptE. The \u03b2-barrel assemblymachinery (BAM) assembles LptD together with LptE at the OM. In the enterobacterium Escherichia coli, formation of two native disulfide bonds in LptD controls translocon activation. Here we report the discovery of LptM (formerly YifL), a lipoprotein conserved in Enterobacteriaceae, that assembles together with LptD and LptE at the BAM complex. LptM stabilizes a conformation of LptD that can efficiently acquire native disulfide bonds, whereas its inactivation makes disulfide bond isomerization by DsbC become essential for viability. Our structural prediction andbiochemical analyses indicate that LptMbinds to sites in both LptD and LptE that are proposed to coordinate LPS insertion into the OM. These results suggest that, bymimicking LPS binding, LptM facilitates oxidative maturation of LptD, thereby activating the LPS translocon.",

Corey 2,6,7, Violette Morales1,7, Yves Quentin 1, Carine Froment3,4, Anne Caumont-Sarcos1, C\u00e9cile Albenne1, Odile Burlet-Schiltz3,4, David Ranava 1, Phillip J. Stansfeld 5, Julien Marcoux 3,4 & Raffaele Ieva 1\nInsertion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the bacterial outer membrane (OM) is mediated by a druggable OM translocon consisting of a \u03b2-barrel membrane protein, LptD, and a lipoprotein, LptE. The \u03b2-barrel assemblymachinery (BAM) assembles LptD together with LptE at the OM. In the enterobacterium Escherichia coli, formation of two native disulfide bonds in LptD controls translocon activation. Here we report the discovery of LptM (formerly YifL), a lipoprotein conserved in Enterobacteriaceae, that assembles together with LptD and LptE at the BAM complex. LptM stabilizes a conformation of LptD that can efficiently acquire native disulfide bonds, whereas its inactivation makes disulfide bond isomerization by DsbC become essential for viability. Our structural prediction andbiochemical analyses indicate that LptMbinds to sites in both LptD and LptE that are proposed to coordinate LPS insertion into the OM. These results suggest that, bymimicking LPS binding, LptM facilitates oxidative maturation of LptD, thereby activating the LPS translocon.\nGram-negative bacteria surround and protect their cytoplasm with a multilayered envelope formed by an inner membrane (IM), an outer membrane (OM) and a thin peptidoglycan layer, sandwiched in between. Both lipid bilayers carry out crucial functions, including nutrient uptake and energy metabolism, as well as cytoplasm detoxification andprotection against noxious chemicals, thereby promoting adaptability to a wide range of niches1. The OM forms the foremost barrier to cellular access and therefore, in the context of bacterial multidrug resistance, the OM is a particularly attractive drug target for the development of new antimicrobials2,3.\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major structural component that accumulates in the external leaflet of theOM lipid bilayer. LPS typically\ncontains six saturated acyl chains, surface displayed carbohydrates and negatively charged phosphate groups that are stabilized by divalent cations. This therefore structures a densely-packed layer that shields the cell from lipophilic molecules, detergents and antimicrobial compounds. LPS is also a modulator of protein homeostasis and peptidoglycan remodeling, regulating the overall architecture of thebacterial envelope4\u20137. In addition to its protective function, LPS acts as an endotoxin with potent immunogenic activity and represents a major target of the innate immune response8.\nAnterograde LPS transfer across the bacterial envelope is mediated by a dedicated LPS transport (Lpt) pathway. In the enterobacterial model organism Escherichia coli, the Lpt pathway relies on the activity\nReceived: 16 January 2023\nAccepted: 27 September 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Laboratoire deMicrobiologie et G\u00e9n\u00e9tiqueMol\u00e9culaires (LMGM), Centre de Biologie Int\u00e9grative (CBI), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier (UT3), Toulouse 31062, France. 2Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QU, UK. 3Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale (IPBS), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier (UT3), Toulouse 31077, France. 4Infrastructure Nationale de Prot\u00e9omique, ProFI, FR 2048, Toulouse, France. 5School of Life Sciences and Department of Chemistry, Gibbet Hill Campus, The University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK. 6Present address: School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Biomedical Sciences Building, Bristol BS8 1TD, UK. 7These authors contributed equally: Haoxiang Chen, Robin A.

Impairment of the Lpt pathway causes accumulation of LPS in the IM6, where it undergoes subsequent modification by colanic acid11, a polysaccharide produced upon envelope damage12. The terminal link of the Lpt pathway consists of an OM translocon that inserts LPS into the external leaflet of the OM. The OM LPS translocon, composed by an integral OM protein, LptD, and a cognate OM-associated lipoprotein, LptE, acquires a peculiar \u201cplugand-barrel\u201d architecture13\u201315. LptD consists of an amino (N)-terminal periplasmic \u03b2-taco domain and a carboxy (C)-terminal 26-stranded \u03b2barrel transmembrane domain. The \u03b2-taco domain receives LPS from a structurally analogous periplasmic protein, LptA. The C-terminal \u03b2barrel domain defines a large internal lumen that is partly plugged by LptE14\u201316. After docking onto the LptD \u03b2-taco domain, LPS enters the OM via a mechanism involving a membrane-embedded interface between the \u03b2-taco and the \u03b2-barrel domains of LptD. This region is proximal to the \u03b2-barrel lateral gate that forms between the first and the last \u03b2-strands of the LptD transmembrane domain15\u201319.\nBiogenesis of the OM LPS translocon requires the cooperation of the \u03b2-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) and the periplasmic disulfide bond formation machinery (Dsb). BAM is a heteropentamer (BamABCDE) that folds integral OM proteins, such as LptD, into membrane-spanning \u03b2-barrel structures20,21. The catalytic, integral OM protein BamA and the lipoprotein BamD are two essential BAM subunits that directly coordinate LptD and LptE assembly to form a plugand-barrel structure22. Chaperones and proteases help preventing the accumulation of off-pathway folding intermediates that wouldhamper OMP biogenesis if blocked at the BAM complex23,24. Within LptD, two native disulfide bonds between pairs of non-consecutive cysteine residues interlink the \u03b2-taco and the \u03b2-barrel domains, thereby activating the LPS translocon25. This complex LptD oxidation pattern occurs via a stepwise maturation process. The first two consecutive cysteines in the \u03b2-taco domain are initially oxidized by the oxidase DsbA, generating a non-native disulfide bond. After engaging with the BAM complex for assembly of LptD together with LptE in the OM, acquisition of native disulfide bonds in LptD activates the translocon26. Typically, DsbC promotes disulfide bond shuffling in secretory proteins27, however the role of this enzyme in LptD oxidative folding has been debated25,28.\nThe development of Lpt-targeted drugs requires detailed understanding of the process of LPS transport to theOM.Herewe report the discovery of LptM (formerly YifL) as a component of the OM LPS translocon. LptM binds the membrane-embedded portion of the translocon, making contacts with sites in both LptD and LptE that are proposed to mediate LPS insertion into the OM. Thus, LptM stabilizes an active conformation of the OM LPS translocon promoting its assembly by the BAM complex and oxidative maturation. LptM is a component of the Lpt pathway that controls activation of the OM LPS translocon by mimicking substrate binding."

            "text": "The OM LPS translocon stably interacts with LptM Wediscovered that the E. coliOMLPS translocon, LptDE, interacts with an uncharacterized lipoprotein, formerly known as YifL, that we have renamedLptM (LptDoxidativematuration-associated lipoprotein).We identified LptM upon expression and Ni-affinity purification of the LptDEHis complex (harboring a C-terminally poly-histidine tagged variant of LptE) using the mild, non-ionic detergent n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltopyranoside (DDM). The elution fraction was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining, revealing efficient copurification of LptD along with the bait protein LptEHis (Fig. 1a, lane 1). Analysis of the same elution fraction by blue native (BN)-PAGE showed that the OM LPS translocon migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ~140 kDa (Fig. 1a, lane 3). To verify the protein content of this major gel band, we employed trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF/TOF\ntandemmass spectrometry (MS). Surprisingly, in addition to LptD and LptE, this analysis identified LptM, an uncharacterized lipoprotein of ~6 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1a\u2013c). To explore the role of this factor, we purified the LptDE complex from a strain lacking the yifL/lptM gene. Although the yields of LptEHis and LptD resolved by SDS-PAGE were unchanged (Fig. 1a, lanes 1 and 2), the intensity of the blue native 140 kDa band was reduced (Fig. 1a, lanes 3 and 4). Part of purified LptEHis and LptD originated a slightly slower-migrating BN gel band that was most prominent in the sample lacking LptM. The accumulation of a slower-migrating form of the LptDE complex could be indicative of an effect of LptM on the native organization of the OM LPS translocon.\nTo address whether LptM can stably interact with the OM LPS translocon, a C-terminally poly-histidine tagged version of E. coli LptM (LptMHis) was overproduced together with LptD and LptE. Ni-affinity chromatography revealed efficient purification of the OM LPS translocon subunits along with the bait protein (Fig. 1b). Most notably, nativeMSdemonstrated that LptD, LptE andLptMHis formed a complex which is larger by 5900Da \u00b1 25Da compared to the LptDEHis heterodimer (Fig. 1c). This mass difference fits well with the theoretical molecular weight of mature tri-acylated LptM, 5888Da. Together, these results indicate that LptM stably associates with LptDE forming a 1:1:1 heterotrimeric complex.\nNext, we asked whether, by associating with LptDE, LptM integrates the transenvelope Lpt pathway, including the periplasmic LPS chaperone LptA that bridges the IM and OM Lpt complexes. An interaction of LptD with LptA can be monitored by site-directed photocrosslinking, introducing the photoactivatable amino acid analog para-benzoyl-phenylalanine (pBpa)29 in place of Y63 at the N-terminal region of the LptD \u03b2-taco domain, which interacts with LptA13. We observed that the population of LptD that stably associates with LptMHis could efficiently crosslink LptA in proximity of LptD Y63 (Fig. 1d, lanes 1 and 2). In a control experiment, pBpawas introduced in place of Y347, a position buried in the lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel, which inefficiently crosslinked LptA (Fig. 1d, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, LptA and, albeit to a lower extent, LptB were co-isolated along with DDM-solubilized LptMHis (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Of note, the overproductionof LptMHis had no detectable effect on bacterial growth nor on the OM permeability barrier to the large molecular weight antibiotic vancomycin (Supplementary Fig. 2b), suggesting that its association with the Lpt pathway did not interfere with LPS transport and OM homeostasis. We conclude that LptM stably interacts with the OM LPS translocon LptDE, thus integrating the transenvelope Lpt pathway.\nLptM is a lipoprotein conserved in Enterobacteriaceae The gene lptM codes for a small lipoprotein of ~6 kDa. The LptM lipobox cysteine residue is followed by a glycine residue (Fig. 1e), suggesting that the protein is transported to the OM30, in agreement with our finding that LptM interacts with theOMcomplex LptDE. LptM includes the annotated Pfam domain, PF13627 (Prokaryotic lipoprotein-attachment site), overlappingwith the protein lipobox and a short N-terminal region of themature protein. Thismotif was used to search lptM putative orthologs in a group of 2927 bacterial genomes (comprising at least one genome per bacterial family of those present in the bacterial Genome TaxonomyDatabase, GTDB)31. lptM-like genes were found in ~79% of Gamma- and 57% of Alpha-proteobacteria, and were virtually absent in non-proteobacterial genomes (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013d, see also Supplementary Methods). The degree of conservation of chromosomal neighboring genes surrounding lptM in Proteobacteria suggests inheritance of this gene from a common ancestor. Thus, the identified lptM genes can be considered orthologs. The amino acid sequence length downstream PF13627 is generally short with less than 70 amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Both the N-terminal PF13627 and the C-terminal moiety of the protein are conserved in a recently redefined Enterobacteriaceae family (Fig. 1e\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6368 2\nand Supplementary Fig. 4), whereas other Proteobacteria harbor a lipoprotein containing the N-terminal PF13627 motif followed by a C-terminal region that is poorly conserved with that of E. coli LptM (Supplementary Fig. 3e; see also Supplementary Methods). Taken together, our taxonomic analysis strongly suggests that distinct subregions of LptM from Enterobacteriaceae are functionally important.\nLptM promotes efficient assembly of the OM LPS translocon at the BAM complex The BAMcomplex plays a key role in the assembly of LptD and LptE as a two-protein plug-and-barrel complex. We noticed that purification of DDM-solubilized LptMHis co-isolated, to some degree, BAM subunits (Supplementary Fig. 2a, lane 4), raising the hypothesis that LptM could be assembled with the LPS translocon during its biogenesis at the BAM complex. We thus assessed whether LptM would be required for BAMmediated assembly of LptD together with LptE. To test this hypothesis, first we generated a double deletion strain lacking lptM and bamB, which encodes a subunit of the BAMcomplex that is particularly critical for LPS translocon biogenesis32. \u0394bamB is sensitive to detergents, such as SDS, and to large molecular weight antibiotics, such as vancomycin, which are normally excluded from the OM of wild-type cells.

The sensitivity of the double deletion strain to both SDS and vancomycin was considerably accentuated compared to \u0394bamB, especially at 42 \u00b0C (Fig. 2a, frames 4 and 6). This detrimental synergistic effect reveals a genetic association of lptM with bamB, pointing to a possible role of LptM in LptDE assembly. Mutations that impair the folding of LptD delay LPS translocon assembly into the OM, thereby prolonging its time of residence at the BAM complex22,33. We reasoned that, if LptM was indeed important for efficient assembly of LptDE, the deletion of lptM could cause accumulation of the LPS translocon at the BAM complex. To address this hypothesis, LptDEHis was produced either in wild-type (lptM+) or in \u0394lptM cells and affinity purified, yielding similar amounts of the bait\nFig. 1 | LptM interacts with the LPS translocon. a The envelope fractions of wildtype (WT, lptM+) and \u0394lptM transformed with pLptDEHis cells were solubilized using the mild detergent DDM and subjected to Ni-affinity purification. The purified OM LPS transloconwas analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lanes 1 and 2) and BN-PAGE (lanes 3 and 4) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Data are representative of three independent experiments. b DDM-solubilized LptMHis purified from \u0394lptM cells transformed with pLptDEMHis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.

A schematic diagram of each complex is shown for each spectrum; LptD in gray, LptE in yellow, LptM in purple. Top: LptDEHis formed a heterodimeric complex of 108,425 \u00b1 11 Da (LptD, theoretical mass of the mature protein = 87,080Da; LptEHis, theoretical mass of the mature and tri-acylated protein = 21,348Da).

The plot was obtained from the multiple alignment of 37 amino acid sequences of LptM in representative genomes of a restricted Enterobacteriaceae family reported in Supplementary Fig. 4 (see also Supplementary Information). The location of PF13627 is indicated above the logoplot.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6368 4\nprotein (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2). Western blot analysis of the elution fractions revealed that LptMwashighly enriched in the LptDEHis elution fraction obtained from lptM+ cells (Fig. 2b, lane 5). Strikingly, the BAM subunits BamD and BamE were also detected in the elution fraction obtained from \u0394lptM cells but not in that obtained from lptM+ cells, indicating aprolonged interactionof LptDEHis with theBAMcomplex in the absence of LptM (Fig. 2b, lanes 5 and 6). We conclude that LptM is required for efficient release of the OM LPS translocon by the BAM complex.\nInactivation of lptM impairs LptD oxidative maturation We asked whether LptM influences the oxidative maturation of LptD that occurs concomitantly to LPS translocon assembly by the BAM complex. LptD contains four cysteine residues at position 31, 173, 724 and 725 of its amino acid sequence, hereafter named C1 to C4, respectively (Fig. 3a). Upon transport into the periplasm by the Sec machinery, the two most N-terminal cysteine residues C1 and C2 are oxidized by DsbA, leading to formation of an oxidation intermediate (LptDC1-C2). Folding of LptDC1-C2 into a \u03b2-barrel structure that surrounds LptE13,22 is followed by the isomerization of the C1-C2 disulfide bond to the C2-C4 bond and further oxidation of the remaining C1 and C3 cysteines25,26. Hereafter, wewill refer to themature, fully oxidized form of LptD (LptDC1-C3,C2-C4) as LptDOx. At least one disulfide bond between non-consecutive cysteines (C1-C3 or C2-C4) is required for proper LPS translocon function, whereas the earlier assembly intermediate, LptDC1-C2, is functionally defective25,26,28. The mechanisms mediating LptD disulfide bond formation and isomerization, which are critical for LPS translocon activation, remain only partially understood25,28,34.\nThe oxidation states of LptD can be determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, as LptDC1-C2 migrates slightly faster than reduced LptD (LptDRed), whereas LptDOx migrates slower than both LptDC1-C2 and LptDRed (Fig. 3a)25,26. Strikingly, our analysis of endogenous LptD in wild-type and\u0394lptM cells revealed that the level of LptDOx was reduced in \u0394lptM and fully restored in a derivative complementation strain harboring plasmid-encoded LptMHis (Fig. 3b). Of note, \u0394lptM cells accumulated some low amount of a faster-migrating form of LptD. To identify this LptD form, we analyzed the migration of LptD produced by strains lacking single components of the periplasmic oxidative folding machinery. The lack of the oxidase DsbA caused the accumulation of the reduced form, LptDRed (Fig. 3c, lane 8)25, whereas elimination of the thiol-quinone oxidoreductase DsbB and the reductase DsbG had no obvious effect on LptD oxidation under these conditions (Fig. 3c, lanes 9 and 11). In contrast, the lack of DsbC and of its electron donor DsbD caused the accumulation of LptDC1-C2 (Fig. 3c, lanes 10 and 12). The LptD migration pattern obtained with the deletion of lptM is similar to that obtained with \u0394dsbC and \u0394dsbD, suggesting that \u0394lptM accumulates the LptDC1-C2 intermediate (Fig. 3b, lane 2; see also Fig. 3c lane 14). Furthermore, these results indicate that a \u0394lptM strain fails to efficiently form mature LptDOx. Lack of the periplasmic chaperone/ proteases BepA, which can degrade an early off-pathway intermediate of LptD assembly23,24, did not alter the pattern of LptD bands in \u0394lptM (Fig. 3c, lanes 13-16), suggesting that BepA does not function synergistically with LptM nor degrades LptD assembly intermediates in \u0394lptM, under our experimental conditions.\nTo further analyze the LPS translocon maturation defect caused by the absence of LptM, we overproduced LptD and LptEHis either with or without LptM and performed Ni-affinity purifications. As a reference, we also purified translocon mutant forms containing three combinations of Cys-to-Ser pair substitutions in LptD (LptDCCSS, LptDCSCS and LptDSCSC). With the overproduction of LptM, nickelaffinity purification of LptEHis yielded ~95% of LptD in its mature oxidized state, LptDOx (Fig. 3d, lane 2, and quantifications). In contrast, a significantly lower amount of LptDOx was obtained in the absence of LptM (Fig. 3d, lane 1). In this sample, approximately one third of LptD was either reduced or only partially oxidized (Fig. 3d, lane 1, and\nquantifications). These LptD oxidation intermediate forms included LptDC1-C2 (migration similar to that in lane 3 [LptDCCSS]) and a LptD form containing a non-consecutive disulfide bond thatmigrates slower than LptDOx, seemingly corresponding to LptDC2-C4 (Fig. 3d, compare lane 1 to lanes 4 [LptDCSCS] and 5 [LptDSCSC]). We also found that the complex containing LptDCCSS migrates slower on BN gel compared to the complex containing wild-type LptD (Fig. 3e, lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that, compared to the LPS translocon containing LptDOx, the presence of LptDC1-C2 retards translocon migration on BN gels, providing a plausible explanation for the differential BN-PAGE separation patterns of LptDE purified from wild-type cells (containing mostly LptDOx) or from \u0394lptM cells (containing also partially oxidized LptD forms) (Fig. 1a, lanes 3 and 4, and Fig. 3e, lanes 3 and 4). We conclude that LptM facilitates LptD oxidative maturation, whereas its inactivation causes the accumulation of intermediate oxidation forms, most prominently LptDC1-C2 (Fig. 3b, c and e).\nLptM functions synergistically with DsbA during LptD oxidative maturation The observation that \u0394lptM accumulates the LptDC1-C2 oxidation intermediate suggests that LptM is not strictly required for DsbA activity. Yet LptM could have a different role in LptD oxidative maturation, thus acting synergistically with DsbA. To test this hypothesis, we generated a double deletion strain lacking lptM and the cysteine oxidase gene dsbA by using a P1 phage transduction protocol. On LB agar plates, the \u0394lptM \u0394dsbA strain formed slightly smaller colonies compared to its parental single deletion strains (Fig. 4a, left). Furthermore, the double deletion strain showed an enhanced sensitivity to both vancomycin and SDS (Fig. 4a, center and right), indicative of a pronouncedOMpermeability barrier defect thatwasnotobserved with the single deletion strains. This result implies that, as hypothesized, LptM acts synergistically with DsbA in promoting proper oxidative maturation of LptD.\nWe also investigatedwhether the detrimental effect caused by the lptM dsbA double deletion was related to impaired LPS transport. LPS extracted from the wild-type and the single deletion strains showed similar SDS-PAGE and silver staining patterns (Fig. 4b, lanes 2-4), whereas slowermigrating forms of LPSwere obtained from the double lptM dsbA deletion strain (Fig. 4b, lane 1). A mass increment of LPS reveals a modification that can be triggered as a consequence of impaired anterograde transport along the Lpt pathway, causing LPS accumulation at the IM and modification with colanic acid6,11. Most importantly, the observed LPS alteration in the lptM dsbA double deletion strain corroborates our evidence that LptM promotes LPS translocon biogenesis, thereby facilitating efficient LPS transport to the OM."

However, we could not combine the deletion of lptM with that of dsbC by using P1 phage transduction (seeMethods for data quantification), suggesting that the double deletion of lptM anddsbC is synthetically lethal. Indeed, a strain lacking both chromosomal dsbC and lptM, and encoding DsbC under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter, PBAD, could grow efficiently only in the presence of the inducer (Fig. 4c), indicating that dsbC and lptM are nearly essential upon inactivation of the other. We conclude that in the absence of LptM, LptD disulfide bond isomerization by DsbC becomes critical.\nTo gain deeper understanding of the consequences related to impaired LptD disulfide bond isomerization, we challenged cells with the overproduction of LptE and wild-type LptD (LptDCCCC) or LptDCCSS, i.e. a form of LptD that can be converted to LptDC1-C2 but that cannot undergo subsequent disulfide bond shuffling as it contains serine\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6368 5\nresidues in place of C3 andC4. Notably, the overproduction of LptDCCSS impaired growth of \u0394lptM but not of cells overproducing also LptM (Fig. 4d), implying that the accumulation of LptDC1-C2 in the absence of LptM is detrimental. Given the prolonged residence of LptD and LptE at the BAM complex in \u0394lptM cells (Fig. 2b) and that LptDC1-C2 is the LptDoxidation intermediate that engageswith the BAMcomplex22,26, it appears reasonable to infer that the detrimental effect caused by LptDCCSS overproduction in the absence of LptM is related to the accumulation of an off-pathway intermediate at the BAM complex, which may interfere with the correct functioning of this essential\nFig. 3 | LptM promotes LptD oxidative maturation. a Schematic representation ofmature LptDprimary sequence indicating the position and oxidation state of Cys residues in LptDRed (top, left), LptDC1-C2 (middle, left) or fully oxidized LptDOx (bottom, left).

Taken together, our results suggest that, in \u0394lptM, DsbC helps rescuing LptD off-pathway oxidation intermediates that fail to assemble correctly at the BAM complex (Fig. 4e).\nLptM interacts with the OM embedded portion of the LPS translocon The structures of LptDE from different organisms have been determined14\u201316,18. To investigate the structural basis of how LptM interacts with LptDE, we used AlphaFold2-multimer to build a predicted model of the complex35\u201337. The top-ranking structures reveal a considerable amount of contact between LptM and LptDE (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5), with the N-terminal cysteine of LptM consistently placed in close proximity of the flexible hinge separating the periplasmic andmembrane domains of LptD16,38 that is adjacent to the LptD \u03b2-barrel lateral gate (Fig. 5a).\nWe next investigated how LptM might influence the conformational dynamics of the OM LPS translocon using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of our AlphaFold2-multimer model. The presence of the LptM N-terminus close to the LptD hinge was compatible with cysteine pairs C1/C3 and C2/C4 (all reduced) being in disulfide bond distances over a simulation time of 500ns, whereas C1\nandC2 remainedmore distant fromeachother (Supplementary Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, the positioning of the N-terminal LptM cysteine means that, when tri-acylated, the acyl tails are positioned at the interface of the LptD \u03b2-taco and \u03b2-barrel domains (Fig. 5b). This region presents several hydrophobic residues and was proposed to form a membrane-facing hole through which the acyl chainsof LPSwouldget inserted into theOM19,39. Fromour simulations, the presence of LptM at this position breaks several connections of the \u03b2-taco with the \u03b2-barrel domain (Fig. 5b), which has an impact on the angle of orientation of the LptD \u03b2-taco domain (Supplementary\nFig. 6b) and causes destabilization of the N-terminal loop of LptD that precedes the \u03b2-taco domain (Supplementary Fig. 6c). LptM also affects the LptD \u03b2-barrel lateral gate, reducing the number ofH-bonds formed between \u03b2-strands 1 and 26 at their periplasm-facing side (Fig. 5c). This is in line with a previously proposed model of LptD lateral gate opening18 and suggests that LptM may reduce the energetic barrier necessary for \u03b2-strand unzipping at the gate15,38.\nAside from these interactions, our model also predicts that LptM inserts into the lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel, establishing several interaction points with both LptD and LptE. These include a salt bridge formed between LptM K23 and LptD E275 (Supplementary Fig. 6d),\nFig. 4 | LptM functions synergistically with the oxidative folding machinery. a Drop dilution growth test of E. coli wild-type and the indicated derivative strains lacking lptM, dsbA or both under different conditions as indicated. vanc, vancomycin; SDS, sodiumdodecyl sulfate.b LPSwasextracted from the indicated strains, resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver stained.

In wild-type cells the four cysteines of LptD are oxidized stepwise: LptDRed is first oxidized to form LptDC1-C2. Disulfide bond shuffling in the latter generates LptDC2-C4. A final event of oxidation forms a disulfide between C1 and C3, thus generating LptDOx. LptM acts synergistically with the disulfide bond formation machinery in facilitating proper oxidation of LptD. In the absence of LptM (\u0394lptM, red arrow), a considerable fraction of LptD accumulates as off-pathway oxidation intermediates, most prominently LptDC1-C2. In this mutant, the assembly of LptD together with LptE stalls at the BAM complex and DsbC becomes essential for cell viability, suggesting that disulfide bond isomerization helps to rescue LPS translocon assembly.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6368 7\nb c\na\nF228 F211\nS226 Q217\nF228 F211\nS226 Q217\nH bonds 3.9 \u00b1 0.3\nH bonds 2.2 \u00b1 0.4\nd\nLptDE\nLptDEM\nLptDE\nLptDEM\nMembrane-facing hole Lateral gate\nLptM Acyl tails\ne\nHinge\n1\nLptM Acyl tails\nLoop 1\nLptD -barrel\nLptD -taco\nLptM LptE\n90\u00b0C20\nFig. 5 | LptM binds the membrane-embedded portion of the LPS translocon, influencing LPS-interaction sites. a View of top ranking AlphaFold2 model of LptDE-LptM.

In addition, the hook-shaped C-terminal region of LptM makes contact to LptE, as well as the inward folded LptD loop 4 that is critical for efficient LptD assembly at the BAM complex22,26,33. It should be noted, however, that the AlphaFold2 prediction confidence score decreases specifically for the C-terminal moiety of LptM,making less certain its localization in the ternary LptDEM complex (Supplementary Fig. 5C). In addition, our MD simulations predicted that the LptM C-terminal region is conformationally dynamic (Supplementary\nFig. 6c), suggesting that it may coordinate multiple interactions.\nOur structural model highlights that LptM mostly interacts with the OM-embedded portion of the LPS translocon. Several experiments corroborated this prediction. First, we purified LptMHis in cells that express, in addition to endogenous wild-type LptD, also a truncated form of LptD lacking the N-terminal \u03b2-taco domain, which can still interact with LptE14\u201316. In line with our AlphaFold2-multimer model, we found that the interaction of LptM with the LPS translocon does not require the LptD \u03b2-taco domain (Supplementary Fig. 8a, lane 2). Next, we employed site-directed photocrosslinking to probe the environment surrounding LptM in the attempt tomap its interactions with the OM LPS translocon. To this end, pBpa was introduced at 6 different positions of the LptMHis sequence. Upon affinity purification and western-blotting with LptM-specific antibodies, a number of UVinduced crosslink adductsweredetected (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The incorporation of pBpa at position L22 and, to a lower extent, Y27 led to the formation of a UV-dependent adduct of ~100 kDa that contained LptD (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c), which is in line with the AlphaFold2multimer prediction that the conserved LptM N-terminus interacts with LptD. Two major crosslink adducts of an apparent molecular weight of ~50 kDa were obtained with pBpa introduced in the C-terminal half of LptM (Supplementary Fig. 8b). These adducts corresponded to an interaction of LptM with the abundant OM protein OmpA ( ~ 37 kDa) (Supplementary Fig. 8d). As OmpA was not detected upon native purification of LptMHis (Supplementary Fig. 2a), we speculate that the observed LptM-OmpA crosslink adducts are due to spurious association of the overproduced bait with this abundant OM protein. The inefficient crosslinking of LptM C-terminal moiety with theOMLPS translocon suggests that this segmentof LptMmayacquire different conformations probably mediating short-lived interactions with LptD and LptE. To further probe for the presence of LptM in the lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel adjacent to LptE, we introduced pBpa at two amino acid positions in LptE: K70 that faces the periplasm oriented toward LptM and A83 in a \u03b2-strand of LptE, which faces the LptD \u03b2barrel lumen occupied by LptM in our structural model. Both LptE positions crosslinked to LptM (Supplementary Fig. 8e) supporting our prediction that LptM resides within the portion of the lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel that is left unoccupied by LptE (Fig. 5a).\nHDX-MS reveals a stabilization effect of LptM on LptDE conformational dynamics We also employed hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to monitor the dynamics and solvent accessibility of LptD and LptE in the LPS translocon produced in the presence or absence of LptM and purified in detergent micelles. We obtained 93% and 75% sequence coverage for LptD and LptE, respectively, and observed that the deuteration was very slow for the membrane-spanning portion of the LptD \u03b2-barrel domain and much faster in its periplasmic region, and extracellular loops (Supplementary Fig. 9), as expected for an integral membrane protein40,41. Less expected was the relatively high deuteration rates obtained for LptE, as this protein buries in the internal lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel. Comparing the deuteration of the LPS translocon with and without LptM, we observed that LptM stabilizes distinct regions of the OM LPS translocon in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 10\u201312, and Supplementary Data 2 and 3). These stabilized regions include LptE\n(Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 10\u201312, and SupplementaryData 2 and 3) and a segment of LptD (212-240) corresponding to the hinge followed by \u03b2 1 and loop 1 of the \u03b2-barrel domain (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Figs. 10\u201312, and Supplementary Data 2 and 3). The protection of LptE is in line with the multiple contacts between LptM and LptE in the lumen of the LptD \u03b2-barrel domain predicted by our AlphaFold2multimer model. Similarly, protection of the \u03b2-barrel N-terminal peptide (LptD 212-240) fits well with the predicted positioning of the LptM N-terminus in proximity of the LptD \u03b2-taco/\u03b2-barrel hinge and the \u03b2barrel lateral gate. This segment would also be proximal to the acyl tails of the LptM N-terminal cysteine, which might contribute to its stabilization (Fig. 5e). Notably, a recent HDX-MS analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) LptDE showed that, upon LPSbinding, deuterationof the N-terminal region of the LptD \u03b2-barrel in proximity to the lateral gate is reduced17. Thus, the presence of LptM produces a stabilization effect in proximity of the LptD lateral gate that is similar to that caused by LPS binding. Taken together, our structure modeling and HDX-MS results suggest an LPS-mimicking effect by LptM in the membrane embedded portion of the LPS translocon.\nDeuteration of the \u03b2-taco domain was also decreased in the presence of LptM. A bimodal isotopic distribution for peptides of the \u03b2taco domain was previously reported for Kp LptDE17. Based on this result, it was suggested that the \u03b2-strands of the \u03b2-taco domain undergo concerted closing and opening motions that occur with a kinetic slower than the rate of hydrogen/deuterium exchange (EX1 regime). For peptides of the central andC-terminal regionof the\u03b2-taco domain, LPS binding favored a mixed kinetics of deuterium uptake, whereas the antimicrobial peptide thanatin, which also binds the LptD \u03b2-taco domain42, shifted the equilibrium toward a slower uptake kinetics17. We observed a similar bimodal isotopic distribution for peptides of the \u03b2-taco (LptD 70-218) of the LptDE dimer in the absence of ligands, as previously reported17 (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, at this stage, we cannot exclude the presence of two populations that do not interconvert during the labeling time period, thus generating spectra that would resemble those obtained with EX1 regime kinetics. Strikingly, the presence of LptM abrogated this bimodal regime and shifted the mixed kinetics equilibrium toward the slower uptake behavior (Fig. 5d, and supplementary Figs. 10 and 12), suggesting an effect similar to that shown for Kp LptDE in the presence of thanatin. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the extensive contacts predicted between LptM and distinct regions of the LPS translocon may have important regulatory roles."

            "text": "Herewe report thediscoveryof the lipoprotein LptMasa key factor for the oxidative maturation of the OM LPS translocon. We have shown that LptM stably interacts with the OM-embedded portion of the translocon formed by LptD and LptE, promoting its assembly by the BAM complex. Our functional analysis of LptM reveals amechanismof activation of the LPS translocon upon assembly by the BAM complex, and clarifies the role of disulfide bond isomerization by DsbC during LptD oxidative maturation. Furthermore, our biochemical and structural analyses indicate that LptM integrates the Lpt transenvelope pathway by associating with LptDE and influences domains of the OM translocon reported to be crucial in coordinating LPS transport.\nWe provide three major lines of evidence demonstrating the critical role of LptM in the assembly of theOMLPS translocon. First, LptM interacts with the LptD \u03b2-barrel domain and LptE. This finding is fully supported by our biochemical assays, native-MS analysis, AlphaFold2 modeling, atomistic MD simulations and HDX-MS kinetics. Second, LptM improves the efficiency of LPS translocon assembly at the BAM complex. Third, LptM is required for proper oxidation of LptD and efficient anterograde transport of LPS. Our AlphaFold2-multimer model and atomistic MD simulations provide important clues as to how LptM promotes LptD maturation. LptM stably associates via its\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6368 9\nN-terminal region with the membrane-embedded portion of the LPS translocon, making contacts with both LptD and LptE. Furthermore, although with lower confidence, the LptM C-terminal region is also predicted to interact with the LPS translocon. Notably, the LptD assembly defect caused by the deletion of lptM (impaired oxidative maturation and prolonged residence at the BAM complex) is somewhat reminiscent of that reported for the variant encoded by the partial loss-of-function allele lptD421343,44. This allele encodes a formof LptD, LptD\u0394D330-D352, deleted of the segment comprising part of \u03b2 7 and of the inward-folded extracellular loop 4 of the \u03b2-barrel domain, which is critical for LPS translocon assembly at the BAM complex and its activation14\u201316. LptD\u0394D330-D352 accumulates as a C1-C2 intermediate that resides for a prolonged period of time at the BAM complex26,33, as also obtained for wild-type LptD upon deletion of lptM. This observation is consistent with a model where LptM facilitates the correct folding of LptD promoting its maturation to a fully oxidized form. However, in contrast to the LptDC1-C2 intermediate produced by the lptD4213 allele that is partly degraded by the chaperone/proteaseBepA23, the LptDC1-C2 intermediate produced in the absence of LptM does not appear to be influenced by this periplasmic factor.\nFormation of native disulfide bonds in LptD is carefully controlled and occurs only after the \u03b2-barrel domain of LptD engages with the BAM complex to assemble together with LptE into the OM22,26. Despite the fact that native disulfide bonds are crucial for LPS translocon activation, DsbA is not essential for viability, indicating that spontaneous oxidation sustains formation of a sufficient amount of properly oxidized LptD34. Our results indicate that, with the inactivation of the oxidative folding machinery, LptM is particularly critical for efficient LPS translocon activity. Thus, LptM acts independently of, but synergistically with, the oxidative folding machinery in promoting LPS translocon activation. As indicated by our structural modeling and HDX-MS analysis, LptM binds and stabilizes regions of the OMembedded portion of the translocon. By doing so, LptM stabilizes a conformation of the translocon that can most effectively be oxidized to form native disulfide bonds, even in the absence of a functional oxidative folding machinery (Fig. 4a and c).\nOur results show that LptM is not required to generate the LptDC1-C2 oxidation intermediate, as this accumulates in its absence (Fig. 3b and d). Instead, LptM plays an important role after this first LptD oxidation event mediated by DsbA. Different views exist on the mechanisms that mediate disulfide bond isomerization in LptDC1-C2. Experimental evidence that DsbC can form an intermolecular disulfide bond with LptD suggested that this enzyme could be involved in the rearrangement of its cysteine oxidation patterns28. Yet, the observation that DsbC is not essential for cell viability casted doubts on its role during functional activation of the LPS translocon25. Our results clearly indicate that DsbC is crucial for viability in cells that lack LptM. In these cells, LptD and LptE reside at the BAM complex for a prolonged period of time compared to cells that express LptM, which is indicative of a stalled assembly process. Stalling of a LptD assembly intermediate at the BAM complex might have catastrophic effects on the biogenesis of the OM, as it can potentially interfere not only with the maturation of the LPS translocon but also with the ability of the BAM complex to insert other proteins into the OM. Our results imply that DsbC plays a role in rescuing LptD off-pathway intermediates that accumulate in \u0394lptM (Fig. 4e), thus preventing deleterious consequences on OM biogenesis. In line with this scenario, overproduction of the non-isomerizable mutant form LptDCCSS in \u0394lptM is highly detrimental, suggestive of a higher propensity of \u0394lptM to generate LptDC1-C2 off-pathway folding intermediates. Taken together, we conclude (i) that LptM acts downstream of the first oxidation event mediated by DsbA and (ii) that, in the absence of LptM, LptD oxidation intermediates that fail to assemble into an active translocon require rescuing by DsbC (Fig. 4e). These considerations support a mechanistic model where LptM stabilizes a\nconformation of the LPS translocon in which LptD can efficiently complete oxidative maturation.\nFinally, our results suggest that LptM, besides being crucial for the correct assembly of the LPS translocon into the OM, can also regulate its function. LptM binds the periplasm-facing luminal region of the plug-and-barrel LPS translocon structure. The N-terminus of LptM interacts with a region of the translocon in proximity of the LptD lateral gate. Intriguingly, our structural model shows that the acyl tails at the N-terminus of LptM would insert into the membrane-facing hole that forms at the interface between the \u03b2-taco and the \u03b2-barrel domains of LptD reducing the hydrogen-bonding of the lateral gate. This result was validated by our HDX-MS analysis, showing that LptM reduced deuteration of the LptD lateral gate. The stabilization effect of LptM on the lateral gate of LptD is similar to that of LPS-binding observed for Kp LptD17. The interaction of LptM with LptE, which participate in binding LPS45, further supports a possible regulatory function. Taken together, our findings show that LptM binds region of the translocon that are crucial in coordinating LPS transport into the OM. This observation suggests that LptM stabilizes an active conformation of the LPS translocon bymimicking its natural substrate. Importantly, LptM also rigidifies the periplasmic \u03b2-taco domain of LptD, suggesting tight control of the initial event of LPS docking onto the translocon17. We postulate that, during LPS transport, the initial event of LPS binding to the \u03b2-taco domain increases translocon dynamics and progressively promotes LPS insertion into the OM via the LptD membrane-facing hole and \u03b2-barrel lateral gate. A possible scenario, which will warrant further analyses, is that LPS substitutes LptM in the membrane-embedded portion of the translocon prior to breaching the OM.\nThe broad conservation of the N-terminal LptM PF13627 protein motif in Proteobacteria and, most notably, the conservation of fulllength LptM in Enterobacteriaceae suggest that the role of LptM in LPS translocon biogenesis can be generalized to other bacteria. The two essential surface-exposedmachineries, the OMLPS translocon and the BAM complex, are emerging as attractive targets for the development of novel antimicrobial compounds2,3. In this context, by discovering LptM as a LPS translocon component that is assembled together with LptD and LptE at the BAMcomplex, our findings provide a key piece of information that can be important for the development of OMtargeting drugs."

TheC-terminus of LptE was truncated after Thr174 to remove contacts with the LptD barrel, and because the lDDT was low for this region. The N-terminal cysteine residues of LptM and LptEwere tri-palmitoylated. Side chain pKas were assessed using propKa3.161, and side chain side charge states were set to their default, apart from Glu263 and Asp266 of LptD, and Lys103 of LptE, which were all set to neutral. The proteins were built into asymmetric membranes, comprising 6:3:1 palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and cardiolipin in the inner leaflet, with LPS in the outer leaflet. The E. coli Lipid A core with two 3-deoxy-\u03b1-Dmanno-octulosonic acid units was chosen as a representative LPS molecule. The membranes were solvated with TIP3P waters and neutralised with K+, Cl- and Ca2+ to 150mM. This choice of force field and water model should be sufficient to model the internal protein dynamics needed for the study59. System boxes were ~11 \u00d7 11 x 13.5 nm, with ~170,000 atoms (see Supplementary Table 3). Each system was minimized and equilibrated according the standard CHARMM-GUI protocol. Production simulations were run in the NPT ensemble, with temperatures held at 303.5 K using a velocity-rescale thermostat and a coupling constant of 1 ps, and pressure maintained at 1 bar using a semi-isotropic Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling with a coupling constant of 5 ps62,63. Short range van der Waals and electrostatics were cut-off at 1.2 nm. Simulations were run to 500 ns and in triplicate for each system using independent initial starting velocities.\nAll simulations were run in Gromacs 2020.1 (https://doi.org/10. 5281/zenodo.7323409)64. Data were analyzed using Gromacs tools (including residue distances, H-bond number, RMSF and angle analysis) and visualized in VMD65. Plots were made using Matplotlib https:// ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4160265."
