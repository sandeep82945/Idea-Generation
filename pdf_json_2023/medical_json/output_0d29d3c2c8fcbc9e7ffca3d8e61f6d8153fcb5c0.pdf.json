It is estimated to occur in 2.1\u201314.3% of all magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Mindfulness decompression is an effective means to treat and reduce fear and anxiety. There is a rare report on the application of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy in the magnetic resonance examinations of patients with claustrophobia to date.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy on the MRI inspection of patients with claustrophobia.\nMethods: A total of 86 patients with claustrophobia requiring MRI in our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were divided into two groups. The control group was given routine psychological nursing, and the observation group was given a mindfulness breathing technique on the basis of the control group. Before and after the intervention, we\u00a0 compared the intervention effect, satisfaction with nurses\u2019 psychological intervention technique, severe autonomic nervous symptoms during the examination, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) scores, and profile of mood states revised (POMS-R) scores.\nResults: The total effective rate of intervention in the observation group was 90.90%, which was significantly higher (\u03c72 = 6.857, p = 0.00004) than that in the control group (26.19%). Severe autonomic nervous symptoms in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). After the intervention, SAS scores and POMS-R scores in the observation group decreased with statistical significance (p < 0.05).\nConclusion: Mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy can effectively help claustrophobic patients complete an MRI examination, which may be\u00a0worthy of wide promotion and application in the clinic.\nKEYWORDS\nmindfulness respiratory decompression therapy, claustrophobia, MRI, self-rating anxiety scale, stress reduction function"

Claustrophobia refers to severe autonomic nervous symptoms such as abnormal fear, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, sweating, a near-death feeling, and even syncope caused by patients entering narrow and dark spaces (1\u20133). Among various types of phobias, claustrophobia is more common than other phobias. This type of phobia is an unreasonable fear that occurs in enclosed spaces such as elevators, tunnels, and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment (3). According to a report (4), approximately 12.5% of the population has this fear, and most of them are women. It is estimated to occur in 2.1 to 14.3% of all MRI examinations (4\u20137). In the consensus of experts on magnetic resonance examination technology, claustrophobia is listed as a relative contraindication (8). A previous study (9) pointed out the specific diagnostic criteria of claustrophobia patients: fear of the imbalance between emotion and situation; cannot be\u00a0eliminated by explanation; uncontrollable; and an avoidance response occurs when patients are in a fearful environment.\nWith the popularization and promotion of MRI examinations in recent years, the number of patients undergoing the examination is gradually increasing. Claustrophobia caused by MRI examinations has attracted increasing attention (10). Since 2015, the Joint Committee has also put forward new diagnostic imaging requirements for MRI safety, including claustrophobia (5). At present, the solutions for MRI examinations for claustrophobic patients at home and abroad are as follows: Sedation is used in MRI examinations, but this method has certain risks (11), and some foreign scholars have pointed out that reducing noise and increasing space in the scanner can hopefully reduce the incidence of claustrophobia (12). However, the new scanner is expensive, and most existing magnets cannot reduce noise and improve space. Desensitization technology was supplied for treating other virtual reality phobias in MRI patients (11). MRI is a costly imaging method. Optimized contact can improve nursing quality, patient satisfaction, and the magnetic resonance utilization rate (13). Psychological intervention may become a coping strategy for claustrophobia (14).\nIn recent years, mindfulness, as a psychological intervention method, has been increasingly applied to treat patients with mental disorders and physical diseases. Mindfulness refers to a specific, non-judgmental focus on the present situation. Mindfulness-based stress reduction was proposed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979, and its main theoretical basis comes from the combination of Buddhism and modern psychology (15). It includes mindfulness breathing, mindfulness meditation, mindfulness movement, and body scanning. Through mindfulness-based stress reduction, patients can improve their mindfulness level, relieve anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions, and eventually improve their quality of life (16, 17). Many studies have shown that mindfulness decompression is an effective means to treat and reduce fear and anxiety (18\u201322). However, there is a rare report on the application of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy in the magnetic resonance examinations of patients with claustrophobia to date. Therefore, to explore the effectiveness of mindfulness decompression therapy in the magnetic resonance examinations of patients with claustrophobia, researchers tried to use the therapy to provide psychological intervention to claustrophobic patients in MRI examinations."

A player and a loudspeaker were provided in the operation and scanning frames, respectively. The control group adopted a conventional nursing method: filling out SAS and POMS-R before the intervention and then making patients fully aware of the importance of magnetic resonance examinations and cooperation, improving patients\u2019 awareness of MRI examinations, and performing detailed nursing education. We\u00a0used cotton balls to plug patients\u2019 ears to reduce noise or soothing and relaxing music to relieve patients\u2019 nervousness. Patients with severe symptoms may be\u00a0accompanied by family members. The SAS and POMS-R were also completed after the intervention. On the basis of the nursing of the control group, the study group was given nursing intervention by mindfulness decompression therapy. The SAS and POMS-R were completed before the intervention, and then the mindfulness-based stress reduction method was practiced. Before practice, the researchers handed out audio and books and then informed the patients about the background, theoretical connotation, and practice process of mindfulness respiratory therapy. It can encourage patients to establish a calm and peaceful, go with the flow, optimistic, and confident mindfulness attitude. The specific measures are as follows: Patients feel relaxed and comfortable when sitting or lying down. Breathing was selected as the object of observation. Patients need to pay attention to every inhalation and exhalation and can focus on the nasal cavity, chest cavity, abdomen, or any sensitive part brought on by breathing in this process. Patients can gently put their hands on their abdomen and feel the ups and downs of their abdomen as they breathe. Patients also can memorize the\nFrontiers in Medicine 03 frontiersin.org\n\u201csuck-breathe\u201d in their minds. When they find their thoughts wandering, they return to the present and breathe again, without judgment or remorse. Patients have an independent space to practice by themselves. Patients complete the SAS and POMS-R again before they are examined, and then they enter the MRI room to complete the examination."

            "text": "Anxiety status: Zung\u2019s self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) is used (23), and there are 20 questions in the scale. Criteria: the patient\u2019s test score is less than 50 points, which means no anxiety; 50\u201360 points, mild anxiety; 60\u201370 points, moderate anxiety; and > 70 points, severe anxiety.\nEmotional state: The profile of mood states revised (POMS-R) (24) is adopted, which is a highly reliable and valid emotional state rating scale. It includes six subscales (tension, depression, anger, energy, fatigue, and panic). Each subscale includes several adjectives (such as unhappy, unsatisfied, panicked, tired and sleepy, and listless). There are 65 adjectives in total. The words of each subscale are arranged in a mixed way, and each answer has five grades. The original scores of each subscale in five grades are accumulated separately, and the T score of each subscale is calculated by following the norm. The total score of emotional disorder (TMD) = the sum of the five negative emotional scores \u2212 the sum of the two positive emotional scores (energy and self-esteem) + 100. The higher the TMD score is the more negative the emotional state\u2014that is, the more confused, annoyed, or unbalanced the mood state.\nExamination completion effect: Marked effect: During the examination, patients can cooperate with the requirements of the medical staff to complete the examination in one attempt with a clear image. Effect: The examination process is not smooth, and it is necessary to communicate with the patient many times, but the patient can finally complete the examination with an effective image. Invalid: During the examination, the patient exhibits chest tightness, palpitation, and other clinical manifestations many times and cannot cooperate with the examination, and the image is invalid. Number of marked effects + effective number/total number * 100% = total effective rate of intervention.\nPatients\u2019 satisfaction with nurses\u2019 psychological intervention technique: very satisfied, satisfied, generally satisfied, and dissatisfied. Very satisfied number + satisfied number/total number * 100% = satisfaction rate. High satisfaction means good intervention.\nComparison of the number of patients with severe autonomic nervous symptoms (such as dying feelings, pressure, dyspnea, sweating, syncope, and fear of beating the fuselage) during the examination: The fewer people with severe autonomic nervous symptoms, the more effective the intervention is."

            "text": "Our study elucidated the potential benefits of mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy for claustrophobic patients undergoing MRI examinations. Within our cohort of 86 patients requiring MRI between January 2018 and December 2020, those who received mindfulness breathing techniques in addition to routine psychological care demonstrated a markedly enhanced intervention effect with a total effectiveness rate of 90.90%. This was considerably higher than the rate of the control group, which was 26.19%. Furthermore, severe autonomic nervous symptoms were significantly reduced in the observation group compared with the control group. Post-intervention assessments also revealed noteworthy reductions in\nboth SAS and POMS-R scores in the observation group, underscoring the potential efficacy of the mindfulness-based approach. In essence, our findings suggest that mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the MRI experience of claustrophobic patients.\nWith the transformation of modern medical models into biological, psychological, and social medical models, increasing attention has been given to the influence of psychological factors on diseases (25). Mindfulness-based decompression therapy is an effective psychotherapy method that is safe, simple, and low in cost. It is neither subjected to technical limitations such as instruments nor restricted by the venue. Nurses have subjective operability (26).\nIn this study, mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy was used in the magnetic resonance examinations of claustrophobic patients. The results showed that the SAS scores of the patients in the observation group after the intervention by mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy were significantly lower than those in the control group. The anxiety of the patients in the observation group was reduced from mild anxiety to no anxiety, while the anxiety of the patients in the control group was still slight before and after the intervention. There was no obvious change. It is suggested that mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy can improve the anxiety of claustrophobic patients. This is similar to the research results by Reich et\u00a0al. (27). Mindfulness decompression therapy can effectively improve pressure, anxiety, and depression in patients.\nIn addition to the assessment of anxiety, we\u00a0also compared the various emotions of patients by evaluating the POMS-R. In this study, patients with claustrophobia were evaluated by POMS-R before and after the intervention. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the POMS-R scores between the two groups before the intervention, but the TMD value, tension, anger, fatigue, depression, panic, and other negative emotions in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group after the intervention. Meanwhile, positive emotions such as self-esteem and energy were significantly higher than those in the control group, and\nFIGURE\u00a02 Comparison of the POMS-R scores between the two groups before and after the intervention.\nFIGURE\u00a03 Comparison of the number of patients with MRI examination completion between the two groups.\nFIGURE\u00a04 Comparison of the number of patients with MRI examination satisfaction between the two groups.\nFrontiers in Medicine 05 frontiersin.org\nthe difference was statistically significant. The TMD values of three claustrophobic patients before the intervention were 136.75, 128.59, and 130.78, respectively, and decreased to 88.63, 82.47, and 78.63, respectively, after the intervention. The TMD values of other patients decreased to different degrees. It is suggested that practicing mindfulness breathing and improving mindfulness levels can obviously improve the emotional state of claustrophobic patients, reduce negative emotions, and increase positive emotions.\nThe results showed that the completion rate of MRI examinations in the patients with claustrophobia in the observation group was 90.90% after the intervention, which was higher than that in the control group (26.19%). Patients\u2019 satisfaction with nurses\u2019 psychological intervention technique in the observation group was 97.72%, which was higher than that in the control group (77.29%). There were fewer patients with severe autonomic nervous symptoms in the observation group than in the control group. Mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy can reduce sympathetic nerve activity in claustrophobic patients, which is beneficial to the smooth completion of MRI examinations. Nurses pay attention to patients\u2019 psychology accurately, which increases patients\u2019 satisfaction. How does mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy accomplish this? Mindfulness emphasizes continuous attention and uncritical acceptance of internal and external stimuli in the moment. In this process, the individual\u2019s perceptual sensitivity, attention, memory ability, emotional state, and emotional adjustment ability change significantly (20). The study confirmed that short-term mindfulness exercises can cause changes in brain information processing patterns (21). Regarding the influence mechanism of mindfulness, mindfulness mainly affects the lateral frontal lobe and basal ganglia. Some studies have found that mindfulness is related to the nerve remodeling of cortical-marginal circuits responsible for stress response and emotion regulation, and the decrease in gray matter volume in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus is related to idiosyncratic mindfulness. The stress-induced enhancement of the amygdala-anterior cingulate function can be\u00a0 reversed by\nmindfulness meditation practice. At the same time, for the implementation of mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy, we\u00a0only need to prepare a relatively independent space to guide the patients to practice or watch the practice video and then let the patients practice by themselves. This method consumes a little time of staff and is easy for patients to accept, practice, master, and achieve good results.\nThis study had limitations. First, this was a single-center study, and the number of cases was relatively small. The indications, the adaptation population, and the maintenance time of the intervention through mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy need to be\u00a0further studied. Considering the different stressors and stress levels faced by patients in different departments, research can be\u00a0carried out for patients in different departments in future.\nIn conclusion, mindfulness respiratory decompression therapy is an economical, safe, effective, and comprehensive decompression method that plays the best role in nursing departments with medical imaging. It can improve patients\u2019 satisfaction with nursing services, effectively help claustrophobic patients complete magnetic resonance examinations, improve patients\u2019 satisfaction with nurses\u2019 psychological intervention techniques, reduce the occurrence of severe autonomic nervous symptoms, reduce anxiety, and stabilize the mood state. At the same time, it can also provide timely and effective imaging diagnosis data for clinicians. Therefore, it is of great significance to both clinicians and the treatment of patients. After the intervention of mindfulness breathing technology, the number of patients with claustrophobia with severe autonomic nervous symptoms decreased significantly during magnetic resonance imaging."
