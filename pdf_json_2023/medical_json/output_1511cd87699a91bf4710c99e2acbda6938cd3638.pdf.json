    "abstractText": "Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that leads to accelerated skeletal muscle atrophy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of salbutamol (SLB) on skeletal muscle atrophy in high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups (n = 6): control, SLB, HFD/STZ, and HFD/STZ + SLB (6 mg/kg orally for four weeks). After the last dose of SLB, rats were assessed for muscle grip strength and muscle coordination (wire-hanging, rotarod, footprint, and actophotometer tests). Body composition was analyzed in live rats. After that, animals were sacrificed, and serum and gastrocnemius (GN) muscles were collected. Endpoints include myofibrillar protein content, muscle oxidative stress and antioxidants, serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6), serum muscle markers (myostatin, creatine kinase, and testosterone), histopathology, and muscle 1H NMR metabolomics. Findings showed that SLB treatment significantly improved muscle strength and muscle coordination, as well as increased lean muscle mass in diabetic rats. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and muscle markers (myostatin, creatine kinase) indicate muscle deterioration in diabetic rats, while SLB intervention restored the same. Also, Feret\u2019s diameter and cross-sectional area of GN muscle were increased by SLB treatment, indicating the amelioration in diabetic rat muscle. Results of muscle metabolomics exhibit that SLB treatment resulted in the restoration of perturbed metabolites, including histidine-to-tyrosine, phenylalanine-to-tyrosine, and glutamate-to-glutamine ratios and succinate, sarcosine, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) in diabetic rats. These metabolites showed a pertinent role in muscle inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic rats. In conclusion, findings showed that salbutamol could be explored as an intervention in diabetic-associated skeletal muscle",

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that causes elevated blood glucose levels due to compromised insulin function and/or release [1]. Diabetes poses a significant global health challenge, with far-reaching implications that can impact patients\u2019 lives and well-being [2]. The interventions and management of microvascular (retinopathy,\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15082101 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 2 of 24\nnephropathy, and neuropathy) and macro-vascular (cardiomyopathy) problems associated with diabetes are key goals of care for diabetic patients [3,4]. Diabetes is associated with diabetic myopathy, resulting in reduced skeletal and muscular strength [1,5,6]. However, this common condition lacks adequate research attention. It poses a significant clinical challenge, leading to a poorer quality of life for affected individuals. Skeletal muscle, constituting over 40% of total body mass in men and around 30% in women, is the predominant component in the human body [7]. Skeletal muscle is involved in a broad spectrum of physiological activities, such as metabolism, thermogenesis, and protein synthesis. These functions enable it to establish connections with other tissues, support an upright posture, and facilitate movement throughout the body [8]. Being the largest organ, skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in regulating glucose levels in the body. During the postprandial stage, it serves as a primary site for insulin-stimulated glucose absorption, facilitated by the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) [9]. Oxidative stress and mild persistent inflammation are essential underlying causes of diabetic muscle dysfunction [1,10,11]. During oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways undergo activation or inactivation [11]. This process results in detrimental effects such as apoptosis, impaired muscle progenitor cells (muscle satellite cells), and compromised myogenic capacity. Additionally, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays a pivotal role in the primary pathology, contributing to substantial muscle mass loss [1]. Findings suggest that oxidative stress and increased levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 enhance ubiquitin proteolytic activity via specific E3 ubiquitin-ligase genes, including F-box-only protein 32 (FBXO32) and muscle-specific RING finger protein 1 (MuRF-1). This process leads to reduced protein synthesis and increased degradation of proteins in various skeletal muscles, including those affected by diabetic myopathy [12\u201314]. Salbutamol, known as albuterol, is a short-acting synthetic medication that is selective to \u03b22-adrenoceptors (\u03b2AR). It is primarily used as a bronchodilator to manage bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In previous research, it was observed that \u03b22-adrenoceptors (\u03b2AR) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) [15]. Additionally, the selective \u03b22-agonist clenbuterol, which belongs to the same drug category as salbutamoldemonstrated an anti-proteolytic effect during food deprivation. This effect is mediated through a cAMP/Akt-dependent pathway, leading to Foxo3a phosphorylation, suppression of atrogin-1, and inhibition of ubiquitination [16,17]. The study showed that short-term use of salbutamol increased voluntary muscle strength in humans [18]. However, the effect varied among different muscle groups. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists in modulating skeletal muscle function in humans. Both salbutamol and clenbuterol were administered to rats of different ages for three weeks, resulting in increased weight and protein content of hind-limb muscles in young and old rats. Additionally, both drugs increased the protein content of the whole body (carcass) and promoted muscle protein recovery in senescent rats [19]. Salbutamol has been found to enhance protein turnover rates in skeletal muscle after exercise in human subjects [20]. This effect involves the activation of cAMP/PKA and Akt2 signaling pathways and modulation of mRNA expression of growth-regulating proteins. These findings exhibit that salbutamol has the potential to enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle growth in response to exercise [20]. Interestingly, a two-week course of salbutamol administration improved abilities in performing repeated sprints, physical performance, and muscle strength in athletic individuals [20]. Furthermore, salbutamol stimulates the transformation of muscle fiber isoforms, specifically myosin-heavy-chain (MHC)-I to MHC IIa, and enhances the hypertrophy of MHC IIa fibers after weight exercise [21]. A recent clinical trial demonstrates that albuterol (salbutamol) improved muscle function in Pompe disease and showed potential benefit as an adjunctive treatment along with enzyme replacement therapy [22].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 3 of 24\nTaken together, these promising findings suggest that salbutamol could be repurposed for the treatment of muscle atrophy. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that salbutamol might provide protection against skeletal muscle atrophy in diabetic rats induced by a high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ). Furthermore, studies suggest that specific metabolites identified through plasma and skeletal muscle metabolomics profiles of wellphenotype diabetes patients may play a role in the pathophysiological pathway leading to the development of type 2 diabetes [23,24]. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a new technique used to detect these metabolites in the muscle tissue of diabetic patients [25] and enables researchers to provide insights into the metabolic disruptions in diabetic skeletal muscle. We further investigated how salbutamol modulates these altered metabolites in the skeletal muscle of diabetic rats."

BBDNIIT/IAEC/2019/19). Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 8\u201310 weeks and weighing 200 \u00b1 30 g were purchased from the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow, India. Standard laboratory conditions were maintained (22 \u00b1 4 \u25e6C), and the animals were kept under an ambient environment (12 h light/dark cycles), humidity (50\u201360%), and water ad libitum. Animals were housed in polypropylene cages, and one week before starting the experiment, the rats were acclimatized to workable conditions. Twenty-four rats were allocated and randomized into four groups (n = 6): group I (control) received citrate buffer as a vehicle; group II (salbutamol, per se) was the control group treated with 6 mg/kg salbutamol (SLB) orally for four weeks once daily; group III (HFD/STZ) had a high-fat diet ad libitum for two weeks and injected as a single low dose of 35 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) intraperitoneally (i.p.) (hereafter named as HFD/STZ group); and group IV served as HFD/STZ + salbutamol. SLB was prepared in distilled water at administered 6 mg/kg per oral for four weeks once daily. Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital plexus under light anesthesia, and serum was separated and stored at \u221220 \u25e6C for further endpoints. Rats were sacrificed humanely by cervical dislocation, and the gastrocnemius muscle (GN) was isolated and preserved in 10% formalin for histology and kept at \u221280 \u25e6C for other endpoint parameters. The gastrocnemius (GN) muscle is chosen for its unique composition of both type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers. Additionally, it has been extensively studied in previous research [26,27].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 4 of 24\n2.2.1. Induction of Type 2 Diabetes\nThe Srivansan et al. model was used for the induction of type 2 diabetes [28]. In brief, SD male rats were given ad libitum access to a high-fat diet (HFD), having fat (58%), protein (25%), and carbohydrate (17%) for two weeks. After the initial two weeks of HFD diet, a single intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of STZ (35 mg/kg) was administered, and the animals were then continued on the HFD feeding for an additional two weeks. At the end of the four weeks, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid profile (triglyceride and cholesterol) were measured to confirm the induction of type-2 diabetes. Rats with fasting plasma glucose levels of \u2265250 mg/dL or higher were considered diabetic and were used in the present experiments. The STZ was prepared in a citrate buffer (pH of 4.5, while the respective control rats were given a vehicle (citrate buffer) in volume of 1 mL/kg, intraperitoneally. Blood glucose levels were recorded with a glucometer (Dr Morepen GlucoOne, model-BG3).\n2.2.2. Rationale of Selection of Salbutamol Dose\nBased on an extensive literature review, it was observed that salbutamol is commonly administered in microgram doses, primarily in studies focusing on asthma. Furthermore, two findings were identified that repurposed salbutamol for different research purposes, specifically sepsis [29] and in the central nervous system [30]. In these studies, rats were administered salbutamol at doses of 4 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg for specific research objectives. Based on these findings, we carefully selected a dose within the range of these two studies. Therefore, in the present study, we chose a dose of 6 mg/kg of salbutamol."

Each rat was placed on the rotarod for a maximum of 5 min at a speed that increased from 4\u201340 rpm during the test, and the latency to fall was recorded [35].\n2.5.5. Assessment of Gait Speed by Footprint Test\nAt the end of the experiment, the gait cycle of the respective groups (control, salbutamol, HFD/STZ, and HFD/STZ + salbutamol) animals was assessed using the footprint test. The forefeet and hind feet of the different groups rats (control, salbutamol, HFD/STZ, and HFD/STZ + salbutamol) were painted with different non-toxic colors to obtain footprints. Subsequently, the rats were allowed to walk on white paper. The average distance moved forward between the steps was used to compute the stride length. The average distance between the left and right hind footprints was used to calculate the width of the hind and front bases. To assess step alternation homogeneity, the distance between the left-to-left and right-to-right front footprint/hind footprint overlap was measured. For the assessment, a set of six steps was chosen, eliminating impressions created at the start and end of the run [37]."

After that, GN muscle homogenates were centrifuged at 16,278\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C. After homogenization, the supernatant was collected, and from this, 250 \u00b5L of supernatant was mixed with 250 \u00b5L of 100% deuterium oxide (D2O). Following this step, 450 \u00b5L of this mixture was put in 5 mm NMR tubes (Wilmad Glass, Vineland, NJ, USA). A sealed capillary tube containing sodium salt of 3-trimethylsilyl-(2,2,3,3-d4)-propionic acid (1.0 mM) (TSP) dissolved in D2O as a co-solvent was used as an internal standard reference and inserted in the NMR tubes [45].\n2.10.2. NMR Measurements\nA Bruker 800 MHz NMR spectrometer (AVANCE-III, equipped with a cryoprobe) was used for NMR experiments at 298 K. The metabolic profiles of the muscles were determined using one-dimensional (1D) 1H CPMG (Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill) pulse sequence NMR. The tests were performed on all muscle samples with pre-saturation of the water signal during a recycle delay (RD) of 5 s using the Bruker standard library pulse program \u201ccpmgpr1d\u201d. The other acquisition parameters were as follows: the width of the 1H spectral sweep was 12 ppm, the number of transients was 128, and the T2 filtering time (to suppress the broad signals of higher molecular weight macromolecules, including proteins) was obtained with an echo time of 200 s repeated 300 times, which resulted in a total effective echo time of 60 ms. All NMR spectra were processed using the Bruker NMR data processing program Topspin (v2.1), employing a typical Fourier transformation (FT) technique, as well as manual phase and baseline correction. Before the FFT was performed, each FID was zero-filled to a total of 65,536 data points and then multiplied by an exponential line-broadening function operating at 0.3 Hz.\n2.10.3. Spectral Assignment and Concentration Profiling\nUsing the Chenomx NMR suite\u2019s 800 MHz compound spectral database library with pH set at 7.2 for all samples (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada), various peaks in the 1D 1H CPMG NMR spectra were identified and annotated for different muscle tissue metabolites. This was performed in conjunction with 2D homonuclear 1H-1H TOCSY and heteronuclear 1H-13C HSQC NMR [46]. The metabolic assignments were further confirmed using publicly accessible databases (such as HMBD: http://www.hmdb.ca (accessed on 21 October 2022) and BMRB: www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics (accessed on 15 September 2022) and and the NMR assignments of metabolites published in several previous metabolomics studies [47\u201350]. All CPMG pulse NMR spectra that were collected were visually inspected to determine whether they were acceptable. Additional analyses were performed using the NMR suite of the commercial software CHENOMX (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada). First, all of the NMR spectra were baseline corrected and calibrated internally to 1H NMR peak of formate (at \u03b4 = 8.43 ppm and with the concentration set to 0.01 mM). Next, concentration profiling of the 40 muscle tissue metabolites was carried out following the procedure described in the previous section [51]. Then, 3-hydroxy-butyrate\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 8 of 24\n(3HB), acetone, alanine, betaine, acetate, choline, citrate, dimethyl sulfone (DMS), creatine, dimethylamine (DMA), glutamine, glucose, glutamate, glycine, glycerol, isoleucine, isobutyrate (IsoB), leucine, lactate, phenylalanine, methanol, pyruvate, succinate, proline, serine, threonine, valine, tyrosine, histidine, and myoinositol. Following this, the metabolic profiles were utilized to estimate five key metabolic ratios, including the phenylalanine-totyrosine ratio (PTR), histidine-to-tyrosine ratio (HTR), and glutamate-to-glutamine ratio (EQR), as discussed in the preceding section [52,53].\n2.10.4. Multivariate Data Analysis\nThe resultant metabolic concentrations and ratio values were then transferred to the MS Office Excel program and transformed into a comma-separated values (CSV) text format file, which was then utilized for multivariate data analysis in MetaboAnalyst 4.0., which is an open-access web-based metabolomics data processing tool [54,55]. Principal component analysis, often known as PCA, was applied to locate data outliers and offer a concise picture of the trending grouping of the data set. Subsequently, supervised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to discover group separations and locate the discriminating metabolites that accounted for group separations. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to prevent overfitting of the PLS-DA model. For GN muscle metabolic profiling, NMR spectra acquired from the muscle tissue were processed using the PROFILER-Module of CHENOMX. Following this, the quantities of the selected metabolites were determined for each of the three sets of muscle tissue samples. PLS-DA analysis was used to evaluate the quantitative muscle metabolic profiles of the control, salbutamol, HFD/STZ, and HFD/STZ + salbutamol groups. Permutation analysis was performed to cross-validate the PLS-DA models a hundred times, and the resultant goodness-of-fit parameter R2 and goodness-of-prediction parameter Q2 were utilized to evaluate the characteristics of the PLS-DA models. The VIP score, also known as the variable significance on projection score, must have a value larger than 1.0 to be employed in the PLS-DA model\u2019s process of identifying the metabolites responsible for discrimination. The metabolite concentration profile data matrix was then exposed to a random forest (RF) classification model (a supervised machine learning method), and discriminatory metabolic profiles were cross-validated using a Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) score plot [56,57]. In summary, MDA reflects how much accuracy the model loses when each variable is removed from the RF classification model when comparing the study groups. The greater the loss of accuracy, the more critical the variable is for effective categorization. The statistical analysis module of MetaboAnalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca (accessed on 21 October 2022)) was used to analyze the RF classification model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple group comparisons was used to assess the statistical significance of the discriminating factors. The benchmark for statistical significance was a significance level of 0.05 or a p-value of 0.05. Chenomx NMR Suite v8.1 was used to quantitatively estimate the key metabolites."

However, the SLB treatment improved grip strength and wire-hanging performance compared to the control group (p < 0.001) (Figure 2A,B). SLB treatment significantly increased muscle coordination and balance. This was demonstrated by increased latency to fall (p < 0.001) (Figure 2C) and longer stride lengths (right-to-right and left-to-left) (p < 0.001) (Figure 2D,E) in diabetic rats.

Taken together, these findings showed that salbutamol attenuated skeletal muscle atrophy in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic rats. The results showed that salbutamol significantly increased body weight and gastrocnemius (GN) muscle weight but did not alter blood glucose levels in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic rats. Emery et al. showed that 16 days of treatment with \u03b22 agonists, viz. clenbuterol and fenoterol, increased the body weight and GN muscle mass as compared to the control rat [59]. A low dose of clenbuterol improved glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant rats. This was most likely mediated by increasing glucose absorption in skeletal muscle, which increased insulin sensitivity. A finding showed that salbutamol increased the GN muscle weight and protein content in both young and senescent rats [19]. Clinical studies in human subjects demonstrate that salbutamol treatment increased lean body mass, muscle strength, and endurance [20]. Our findings also showed that salbutamol significantly increased the lean mass and grip strength in diabetic rats. These findings indicate that salbutamol has the potential to increase muscle mass. Furthermore, protein accretion is linked to skeletal muscle growth, and muscle protein pools primarily contain myofibril, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic proteins [20]. Our results showed that salbutamol had a higher myofibrillar protein content in GN muscle as compared to diabetic rats. Recent findings have demonstrated that the \u03b22-agonist salbutamol promotes the transition of the muscle fiber isoform from MHC-I to MHCIIa [21]. Moreover, salbutamol intervention in resistance exercise increased the myofibrillar protein fractionation rate and turnover in young men [20]. Next, we checked the levels of testosterone and muscle damage markers, viz. creatine kinase and myostatin. Intriguingly, treatment with salbutamol increased testosterone levels in diabetic rats, which is consistent with the finding that salbutamol considerably increased plasma testosterone levels in athletic men following submaximal exercise [60]. Myostatin (also known as GDF-8) is a negative regulator that affects skeletal muscle growth [61]. Our results showed that salbutamol significantly decreased myostatin levels in diabetic rats. The results were also in line with findings where type 2 diabetic subjects showed increased mRNA expression of muscle myostatin linked to metabolism and systemic inflammation [62]. Contrary to the results presented here, salbutamol was shown to increase myostatin mRNA levels; however, this effect could be neutralized by the concomitant downregulation of activinRIIB, which is associated with resistance training [20]. Our results showed that salbutamol significantly decreased serum creatine kinase (CK) levels in diabetic rats. Because muscle has a large phosphocreatine reserve, changes in CK levels are associated with muscle injury and inflammation. Increased activity in the muscle implies muscular damage and CK leakage from the muscles. Earlier findings showed that creatine kinase levels were elevated in diabetic rats [63]. Thus, elevated serum CK levels observed in exercise-induced muscle damage can lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory markers. This activation can occur due to the destabilization of the cell and membrane, resulting in the infiltration of leukocytes during the process of repair. Next, we assessed the levels of serum inflammatory markers, including IL-2, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, and observed a significant increase in these markers in diabetic rats. However, our findings indicated that salbutamol treatment significantly restored these levels, suggesting that salbutamol possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Further, our results demonstrated that salbutamol significantly restored the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione in the GN muscle of diabetic rats. These enzymes and molecules act as antioxidants, and their restoration by salbutamol suggests its potential role in mitigating oxidative stress in diabetic conditions. Furthermore, GN muscle oxidative stress (MDA and protein carbonyl content) levels were significantly decreased by salbutamol treatment in diabetic rats. Previous studies have shown that salbutamol exerts significant antioxidative effects in rat models [64]. Moreover, our results showed that salbutamol treatment significantly increased the muscle fiber size and cross-sectional area in diabetic muscle. These findings demonstrate that salbutamol can attenuate muscle cellular architecture, highlighting its potential anti-atrophy properties in diabetic-induced skeletal muscle wasting.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 19 of 24\nPrevious findings have demonstrated that the \u03b2-2 agonist formoterol significantly increases muscle fiber size, area, and contractile performance in skeletal muscles [17]. Taken together, our findings support the notion that beta-2 agonists could be effective interventions against muscle wasting disorders. Next, we carried the 1H NMR muscle metabolomics to investigate the effects of salbutamol on diabetes-induced alterations in muscle metabolites. Findings showed that amino acids metabolites (e.g., glycine, histidine, tyrosine, and sarcosine), energy metabolites (e.g., choline, acetate, creatine, lactate, and succinate), and ketone bodies (e.g., betaine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and isobutyrate) were significantly altered in diabetic skeletal muscles. Furthermore, metabolites levels of succinate, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), and the ratios of histidine-to-tyrosine (HTR), phenylalanine-to-tyrosine (PTR), and glutamate-to-glutamine ratio (EQR), were elevated in the HFD/STZ-induced diabetic group, and salbutamol treatment restored these levels (Figure 10). Succinate is primarily recognized as a metabolite that serves as an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and plays a vital role in mitochondrial metabolism and ATP generation. However, recent studies have revealed that succinate has broader implications beyond being a substrate for succinate dehydrogenase and the respiratory chain [65]. Our findings indicated a significant increase in succinate levels in diabetic muscle while salbutamol treatment restored the same. Changes in the altered levels of succinate (an intermediate of the TCA cycle) may affect energy balance and muscle insulin sensitivity [66]. Moreover, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that succinate supplementation can disrupt skeletal muscle homeostasis and impair muscle regeneration [65]. These findings suggest that defects in the TCA cycle are commonly observed in wasting skeletal muscle, and diabetic muscle is not an exception. Furthermore, previous metabolomics and transcriptomic studies have shown that the loss of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) results in an excessive accumulation of succinate [67], which is consistent with the findings of our study. These studies have also revealed that SDH deficiency leads to the inappropriate activation of the mTORC1 pathway in \u03b2-cells, subsequently leading to mitochondrial dysfunction [67]. Overall, succinate appears to have multifaceted roles beyond its traditional function in the TCA cycle. Its dysregulation may contribute to skeletal muscle dysfunction and impaired regeneration observed in various pathological conditions, including diabetes [65]. Furthermore, intervention with salbutamol resulted in the restoration of the altered skeletal muscle metabolites. Our findings demonstrated a significant increase in 3-HB levels in the skeletal muscle of diabetic rats compared to the control group. Further, increased production of ketone bodies, such as \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, results in ketonemia. Moreover, the findings revealed that \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate, an organic acid derived from \u03b1-ketobutyrate, is a potential biomarker of insulin sensitivity in individuals with normal glucose tolerance. These findings suggest that impaired glucose metabolism and disrupted insulin regulation in diabetes indicate disturbances in fatty acid oxidation [68,69]. An elevated level of circulatory PTR (for oxidative markers) and HTR (for inflammatory markers) indicates that disease-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, and hyper-activation of the immune system led to predicated disease [53,70]. PTR and HTR assess the body\u2019s capacity to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine and the histidine-to-tyrosine ratio. The conversion enzyme requires cofactors, such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), niacin (B3), and iron. Increasing the muscle PTR ratio may aid in diagnosing inflammatory disease and a person\u2019s catabolic stage [71]. To preserve physiological homeostasis and fulfill the energy demands of muscle cells, it is necessary to increase their dependence on additional energy sources [72]. As a direct result, several gluconeogenic amino acids, including glutamine and glutamate, were present at lower concentrations in the diabetic group. The consumption of glutamine is directly associated with the suppression of inflammatory reactions in skeletal muscle [73]. In addition, extracellular glutamine concentration can control the production of the adaptor protein GRB10 and has a direct impact on the muscle\u2019s inflammatory response [73]. Next, sarcosine, chemically known as N-methyl glycine, is an intermediate in glycine biosynthesis and degradation and a glycine transporter inhibitor. However, sarcosine levels are governed by sarcosine dehydrogenase, an enzyme that con-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2101 20 of 24\nverts sarcosine to glycine, and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, which produces sarcosine from dimethylglycine. Owing to their capacity to regulate sarcosine levels in myonuclei cells, these enzymes may be essential for controlling sarcomere protein degradation [74]. Our 1H-NMR metabolomics analysis identified an intriguing and less-studied metabolite called sarcosine. It revealed a significant increase in sarcosine levels in diabetic muscle compared to the control group. Only one study has shown elevated sarcosine levels in rats exposed to a high-fructose and high-fat diet, utilizing LC/TOF-MS urine metabolomics analysis [75]. Interestingly, sarcosine has drawn attention as a potential biomarker for aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer, as elevated levels have been observed in tumors associated with this condition [76]. Sarcosine has been shown to activate autophagy in cultured cells and boosts autophagic flux in vivo, suggesting that it may play a role in the induction of autophagy caused by dietary constraints [77]. Additionally, a recent study published in the \u2018Lancet\u2019 found higher sarcosine levels in individuals who exhibited resistance to dietary changes following exercise training. This study involved muscle metabolomics combined with MS/MS analysis of plasma amino acids [78]. Taken together, these findings suggest that sarcosine may play a role in metabolic diseases and provide new evidence highlighting its significance in diabetic skeletal muscles. However, further research is necessary to fully elucidate the role of sarcosine in these conditions and explore its potential as a diagnostic or therapeutic target."

Our results demonstrated that salbutamol significantly increased grip strength and lean muscle mass in diabetic rats. Also, salbutamol treatment results in increased levels of antioxidants in the muscles and reduced muscle atrophy and inflammatory markers, and restored muscle damage biomarkers that indicate its potential to reduce muscle inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, the GN muscle metabolomics markers identified in this study could serve as valuable prognostic markers for diabetic skeletal muscle atrophy. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of salbutamol as a therapeutic intervention for managing skeletal muscle atrophy associated with diabetes."
