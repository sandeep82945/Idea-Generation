    "abstractText": "We examined the transcript-level expression of ErbB family protein tyrosine kinases, including ERBB1, in primary malignant lymphoma cells from 498 adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ERBB1 expression in DLBCL cells was significantly higher than in normal B-lineage lymphoid cells. An upregulated expression of ERBB1 mRNA in DLBCL cells was correlated with an amplified expression of mRNAs for transcription factors that recognized ERBB1 gene promoter sites. Notably, amplified ERBB1 expression in DLBCL and its subtypes were associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS). Our results encourage the further evaluation of the prognostic significance of high-level ERBB1 mRNA expression and the clinical potential of ERBB1-targeting therapeutics as personalized medicines in high-risk DLBCL.",

            "text": "ERBB1 (also known as EGFR) is broadly expressed in numerous cell types of epithelial or mesenchymal origin [1\u20133]. ERBB1 signaling plays a vital role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility, as well as de-differentiation and malignant transformation [1\u20136]. It serves as a receptor for several ligands, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin (AREG) [1\u20136]. The engagement of ERBB1 by one of its ligands results in the activation of its catalytic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) function and triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of the related receptor family of PTK, including ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 [1\u20133]. ERBB1 is overexpressed and/or intrinsically overactive due to mutations in malignant solid tumors [7\u201311]. Studies examining ERBB1 overexpression and/or overactivation demonstrated significant relationships in disease progression, fast invasive growth, and metastatic spread [7\u201311], as well as resistance to biotherapeutic drugs targeting inhibitor immune checkpoints [12]. While the expression and function of ERBB1 have been extensively studied in normal and malignant cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origins, very little is understood regarding its expression in normal or malignant lymphoid cells. Intriguingly, Zaiss et al. reported that CD4+ T-cells express ERBB1 in an antigen-dependent manner [13], which enables them to mount an innate-like immune response during gastrointestinal helminth infections [14]. ERBB1 signaling pathways play key roles in regulating T-cell homeostasis [15], and they may also influence the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis as a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease [16]. ERBB1 expression was detected in a B-ALL cell line and shown to promote stroma-independent survival and growth [17]. AREG [18] as well as EGF [19] are capable of supporting the proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells upon binding to their ERBB1. Additionally, ERBB1 pathway activation by AREG in MMderived exosomes has been reported to trigger osteoclastogenesis, and ERBB1 pathway inhibitors are cytotoxic to MM cells [20,21]. Our recent studies demonstrated that ERBB1 expression was upregulated in MM cells, and higher levels of ERBB1 were associated with poor treatment outcomes and survival in newly diagnosed MM [22].\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 770. https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13050770 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jpm\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 770 2 of 17\nIn the present study, we examined the transcript-level expression of ERBB1 in neoplastic cells from patients with the most common type of adult B-lineage lymphoid malignancies, namely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Notably, ERBB1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was overexpressed in malignant lymphoma cells (MLC) from DLBCL patients, especially those with the high-risk activated B-cell (ABC)-subtype. Upregulated expression of ERBB1 in DLBCL cells was correlated with an amplified expression of transcription factors (TF) that recognized ERBB1 gene promoter sites. Notably, amplified ERBB1 expression in DLBCL and its subtypes was associated with significantly worse overall survival (OS)."

In addition, we used the archived dataset from GSE12195 and GSE12453 for normal B-lineage lymphoid cell (BLC) populations, including CD77+ germinal center centroblasts isolated by magnetic cell separation from normal human tonsils (N = 5), CD10+CD77\u2212 germinal center centrocytes isolated by magnetic cell separation from normal human tonsils (N = 5), sIgD+CD27\u2212CD10\u2212CD38\u2212 na\u00efve B-cells isolated by magnetic cell separation from normal tonsils (N = 5), CD27+CD10\u2212CD38\u2212 memory B-cells isolated by magnetic cell separation from normal tonsils, FACS-sorted CD20lowCD38high plasma cells isolated from normal tonsils (N = 5), FACS-sorted sIgD+CD27\u2212 na\u00efve B-cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors (N = 5), FACS-sorted CD20+CD27+ memory B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors (N = 5), FACS-sorted CD20+CD38+CD77\u2212 centrocytes from normal tonsils (N = 5), and FACS-sorted CD20+CD38+CD77+ centroblasts isolated from normal tonsils (N = 5). Subsets of DLBCL patients were also used in our comparisons for gene expression and ERBB1-associated OS outcomes from the GSE10846 dataset. There were 188 limited-stage (Stage I or Stage II) patients and 218 advanced-stage (Stage III or Stage IV) patients. A total of 167 patients had ABC-type DLBCL, 183 had germinal center B-cell (GCB)-type DLBCL, and 64 had unclassified DLBCL. A normalization procedure performed at the level of each probeset enabled us to compare the mRNA expression of specific probesets in primary DLBCL cells vs. normal BLC populations from healthy volunteer donors. Batch normalized Affymetrix CEL files employing Aroma Affymetrix statistical packages ran in R quantified log2-scaled probeset-level PM signals using the method of Robust Multiarray Analysis as previously described [22]. We also examined ERBB1 expression levels (ERBB1 probesets 1565484_x_at and 1565483_at) in MLC from DLBCL patients with early treatment failures and fatal outcomes within 2.5 years. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with mixed effects was employed to compare the differential expression of ERBB1 mRNA in MLC from DLBCL patients who died within 2.5 years vs. DLBCL patients who remained alive at 2.5 years. Least square means and variance calculations from the \u201cprobeset \u00d7 patient outcome group\u201d interaction group were used for pairwise comparisons of patients experiencing death vs. alive patients at a follow-up time of 2.5 yrs. The genechip variance component was also considered in the model\u2019s random factor. Cluster figures were constructed to display mRNA expression levels in DLBCL patients experiencing death divided by the mean expression levels of patients who remained alive at 2.5 years follow-up.\nJ.

CD19 mRNA was also expressed at a 1.54-fold higher level in the MLC from DLBCL patients compared to BLC (Figure 1, Supplementary Materials: Table S1). Transcriptomes of MLC from GCB-type DLBCL patients (N = 183) were compared to those of MLC from non-GCB (ABC-type or unclassified) type DLBCL patients (N = 231), as well as the normal BLC in the control samples (N = 45). MLC in each DLBCL subset exhibited an amplified ERBB1 expression compared to normal control BLC populations, and the highest expression levels were observed in the non-GCB subset (Supplementary Materials: Figures S1\u2013S4, Tables S2\u2013S5). Next, we sought to determine if the expression levels of ERBB1 mRNA at the time of diagnosis were higher in DLBCL patients who did not achieve long-term survival after standard frontline therapy. To this end, we first compared ERBB1 mRNA expression levels in the MLC from DLBCL patients with different histologic subtypes who had died within 2.5 years vs. those who remained alive at 2.5 years. As shown in Figure 2, the MLC from patients who had died exhibited a significantly higher ERBB1 mRNA expression level than the MLC from patients in the same subsets who remained alive at 2.5 years. Very similar results were obtained for DLBCL patients with a limited stage (Stage I\u2013II) as well as advanced stage (Stage III or IV) disease (Figure 3).

            "text": "DLBCL has an incidence of seven cases per 100,000 people per year [44\u201348]. This aggressive non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) is thought to originate from transformed mature B-cell populations according to a complex molecular pathogenesis and displays a marked biological and prognostic heterogeneity. The majority of newly diagnosed patients show advanced (Stage III or IV) disease requiring intensive immunochemotherapy [49,50]. The GCB-type DLBCL is associated with a more favorable prognosis than the ABC-type DLBCL. Recent therapeutic advances yielded significant improvements in the survival outcomes of patients with B-lineage lymphoid malignancies, including DLBCL [51\u201357]. Furthermore, the therapeutic landscape is continually evolving with the introduction of biotherapy platforms, such as monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cells [55]. However, drug resistance continues to result in treatment failure [51\u201357]. For relapsed or refractory DLBCL patients, salvage treatment strategies include either CD20 or CD79b-directed antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates, CD19-directed antibodies, and CAR-T cells as well as bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation [51\u201357]. More effective treatment strategies are urgently needed for eradication of refractory MLC clones that contribute to disappointingly poor outcomes for DLBCL patients experiencing a relapse on contemporary frontline regimens. This study examined the transcript-level expression of ERBB1 in MLC from 498 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients. MLC in each histological DLBCL subset exhibited an amplified ERBB1 expression compared to normal control BLC populations, and the highest expression levels were observed in the non-GCB subset. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significantly higher ERBB1 mRNA expression levels in the MLC from DLBCL patients who died within 2.5 years vs. patients who remained alive after 2.5 years. These results suggested that the augmented ERBB1 mRNA expression level may be a prognostic biomarker for DLBCL patients associated with poor early survival outcomes. Notably, a comparison of DLBCL patients with the highest versus lowest expression levels for ERBB1 mRNA in their MLC revealed a significantly worse OS outcome for the EGFR/ERBB1high group. The prognostic significance of ERBB1 mRNA amplification was confirmed for the highrisk non-GCB (ABC-type + unclassified) type as well as advanced-stage DLBCL patients (Figures 7 and 8). We tested the hypothesis that amplified mRNA levels of the ERBB1 in MLC from DLBCL patients may be driven by the increased expression of specific TF that transcriptionally activate ERBB1 expression. Our findings demonstrated that an increased ERBB1 mRNA expression showed statistically significant correlations with upregulated mRNA levels of several such TF, including ETF [23\u201325], SP-1 [26\u201330], TCF/LEF1 [31,32], HOXB5 [33,34], RPF-1 [35], p53 [36] and AP-1 [22,36\u201338]. We propose a model according to which the observed upregulation of ERBB1 mRNA expression in DLBCL can be driven transcriptionally by a concerted action of several TF (Figures 4 and 5). Our study has significant limitations, including the absence of a large validation dataset, the bioinformatics-based analyses being used without additional supportive laboratory testing of ERBB1 mRNA levels using other methods (e.g., quantitative RT-PCR, RNA sequencing), and a lack of data to show MLC from EGFR/ERBB1high DLBCL patients with amplified ERBB1 protein expression and PTK activity. Our results need to be verified in a prospective study with integrated RNAseq and biochemical testing in a larger DLBCL patient population. A multivariate analysis of the prognostic significance of ERBB1 overexpression in relationship to other prognostic factors and patient treatment is very important. If confirmed and extended in additional validation and proof of concept studies, our findings suggest that ERBB1 may emerge as a genuine therapeutic target in DLBCL. Targeting ERBB1 with FDA-approved small molecule ERBB1 inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies (Table 1) [5,11] could potentially improve the treatment options for high-risk or relapsed DLBCL patients. Our results presented herein warrant further examination of the therapeutic potential of already FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies targeting ERBB1 that could be repurposed for use in high-\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 770 14 of 17\nrisk or relapsed DLBCL. Besides ERBB1, other ErbB family PTK may also affect the biology of malignant lymphomas. A recent study suggested that the overexpression of ERBB4 may render MLC resistant to inhibitors of BTK and PI3K [58]. Our findings should encourage a systematic review of the expression of ErbB family PTK in malignant lymphomas beyond DLBCL and in relation to clinical outcomes."
