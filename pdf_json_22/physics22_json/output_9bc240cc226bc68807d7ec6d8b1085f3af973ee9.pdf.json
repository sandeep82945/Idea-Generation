            "text": "The thermoelectric effect enables the conversion of thermal energy to electricity1. Asymmetry in the energydependent electronic conductivity between the hot and cold sides of a metallic conductor generates a driving force for a net flow of charge entropy. Whatever the microscopic origins of this entropy are, if they are coupled to charge carriers through inelastic scattering, one can imagine various intriguing ways to modulate thermoelectric effects. Manipulation of the magnetic degree of freedom is another attractive route to controlling the thermoelectric effect. For example, while a consensus has yet to be reached, a large spin entropy and anomalous electronic states near EF have been proposed to explain the giant Seebeck effect of cobalt oxides 2,3,4,5. Efforts to simultaneously engineer the heat, spin, and charge degrees of freedom have resulted in the field of spin caloritronics, where spin currents control and enhance thermoelectric phenomena 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Magnetic fluctuation driven enhancement of the thermopower has been reported, for example, in a Heusler compound12. Antiferromagnetism enhanced thermoelectricity has garnered considerable interest in from both a fundamental and practical perspective13,14. Research on the interaction between improved thermoelectric response and Berry curvature physics is also ongoing15,16,17. Although these recent explorations of the exotic interplay between magnetism and the thermoelectric response are promising, a microscopic understanding of the coupling between magnetism and thermoelectricity is still in its infancy. To promote understanding of the interaction between spins and charges in thermoelectric materials, ideal materials to focus on are those with widely tunable electronic band filling and deeply controllable magnetic structure.\nTransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a unique platform for tuning electronic and magnetic properties in low dimension. The atomic layers of TMDs are weakly coupled through the van der Waals (vDW) force, creating an opportunity to chemically tune their physical properties by intercalating native atoms into the vDW gaps18. Among the magnetic TMDs, Cr1+\u03b4Te2 (Fig. 1a) is a promising self-intercalated ferromagnet with widelytunable electronic and magnetic properties19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. Our recent efforts have yielded a unique recipe for the growth of epitaxial thin films of Cr1+\u03b4Te2 over a wide compositional range 38. Based on the previously reported phase diagram of this system, a Curie temperature (Tc) beyond room temperature is achieved as the intercalated Cr (\u03b4) increases (Fig. 1b left axis). Furthermore, the effective magnetic anisotropy energy (Keff), defined as the difference in energy to align spins along the in-plane (Kin) or out-of-plane (Kout) directions, shows a gradual change from positive to negative values as \u03b4 increases (Fig. 1b right axis). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have suggested an inherent magnetic frustration from competing magnetic interactions, which plays a role in modulating Keff in this system. This Keff modulation yielding enhanced magnetic fluctuation at Keff~0 has been speculated in literature 38.\nRecently, the doping-dependent electronic structure of Cr1+\u03b4Te2 has also been reported. Using in-situ angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a systematic energy shift of the semimetallic band portion was directly revealed around the zone boundary relative to the chemical potential (Figs. 1c and d)39. ARPES measurements at 14 K (well below TC) have yielded a characteristic energy (E0) for the semimetallic band portion around the M point (Fig. 1d). The Fermi energy EF was shown to approach E0 near a critical doping \u03b4c ~ 0.5. Alongside a metallic hole band near the \u0393 point at all doping levels, the formation of a pseudogap in the\ndensity of states (DOS) was predicted to occur around this critical composition. These ARPES findings prompted our current investigation of the doping-dependent longitudinal thermopower (Sxx), as its sign and absolute value should be sensitive probes of the existence of the pseudogap and its energy relative to the chemical potential. Another worthwhile motivation for measuring Sxx is to pursue any magnetism-driven enhancements to the thermopower that Cr1+\u03b4Te2 can be expected to host, being both magnetically and electronically tunable. However, the doping evolution of the thermoelectric response in the absence and presence of magnetic fields has not been investigated in Cr1+\u03b4Te2.\nWe report on the systematic measurement of Sxx and longitudinal electrical resistivity (\u03c1xx) in magnetic semimetal Cr1+\u03b4Te2. We discuss the doping, temperature, and magnetic field evolution of Sxx with respect to the underlying band structure and magnetism. As the most significant finding in this study, we show that at the critical doping level of \u03b4c ~ 0.5, a possible interaction between magnetic fluctuations and the formation of an anomalous electronic state at the chemical potential cooperatively leads to an enhancement of the thermoelectric properties in Cr1+\u03b4Te2.\nMethods"

Regardless of the detailed microscopic origins, suppression of electron-spin scattering can be expected to occur in magnetically-ordered states compared to paramagnetic states. Therefore, TC at each doping level is estimated\nfrom the position of the kink in the \u03c1xx(T) curves, as indicated by the arrows in Figs. 2b and c. The estimated TC values are consistent with those determined previously 38. The doping dependence of Sxx(T) also exhibits several characteristic behaviors. The samples with \u03b4 = 0.34 and \u03b4 = 0.4 show positive values with a nearly linear T dependence (left two panels in Fig. 2c). In contrast, Sxx for \u03b4 = 0.50 and \u03b4 = 0.54 (middle panel in Fig. 2c) show negative values with a kink around TC. Notably, such a kink structure around TC is nearly absent in the highest doped sample, \u03b4 = 0.68 (right panel in Fig. 2c). Hereafter, we focus on Sxx, as the essential trends in \u03c1xx(T) are qualitatively similar for all doping levels. In the following sections, we elaborate on the dopingdependent sign change in Sxx(T), followed by a discussion of the electronic and magnetic origins of the kink around TC in the Sxx(T) curves.\nMott formula for Sxx\nThe simplest model for the temperature dependence of thermopower Sxx in metals is the so-called Mott relation.\n= \u00d7 = \u2212 + ! 1\nHere, the spectral conductivity $ is proportional to the density of states N(E) and the scattering rate \u03c4(E), based on the relaxation time approximation from Boltzmann transport theory. By assuming an energyindependent scattering rate \u03c4 in Equation (1), Sxx can be expressed as:\n\u2248 &'()'*3, - 1. /0 1\u2212 2. / 2/ 3 4 2\nThe above relation makes it evident that the sign of Sxx corresponds to that of \u2013dN(E)/dEE = EF. In this case, if the chemical potential exists in a hole-like band (-dN/dE >0 at EF), the sign and slope of Sxx(T) become correspondingly positive, while if the chemical potential exists in an electron-like band (-dN/dE <0 at EF), the sign and slope of Sxx(T) become negative.\nRelation between Sxx(\u03b4) and band structure\nTo uncover the connection between the sign of Sxx and the corresponding band structure at each Cr(\u03b4), we plot the doping dependence of Sxx at 350 K and its correlation with the doping evolution of the semimetallic band portion at the M6 point (Fig. 2d). For a fair comparison, 350 K is chosen to be above TC for all doping levels. A sign change in Sxx at 350 K is evident as \u03b4 increases. Considering the semimetallic band around the M6 point (Fig. 1d), EF(\u03b4) - E0 > 0 leads to -dN/dE > 0 and consequently to a positive sign in Sxx. On the other hand, EF(\u03b4) - E0 < 0 leads to -dN/dE < 0, corresponding to a negative sign in Sxx. Admittedly, this is a simplified picture that ignores the existence of bands other than the semimetallic band around the M6 point. Moreover, this simplified picture deliberately excludes the nuance of a kz dispersion relying solely on the band dispersion around the M6 point probed using the single-photon energy available in our ARPES38. Nevertheless, a correlation can clearly be seen between the sign of EF(\u03b4) - E0 and Sxx(\u03b4). This correlation implies that the previously observed ARPES band around the M6 point in Fig. 1c governs the doping-dependent behavior of the thermoelectric properties in\nthis system. This simple picture is particularly justified at higher temperatures such as those examined in this study, as the near-EF fine band structure beyond considerations of a simple picture in Fig. 1c is thermally smeared out even if it exists. Also, note that the doping dependence of normal Hall coefficient does not show sign change with doping \u03b4 in a previous report38. However, this is not contradictory. While the normal Hall effect is more sensitive to electronic state anisotropy in momentum space at EF 40, Sxx is sensitive to electronic state anisotropy along energy axis relative to EF.\nMagnetic fluctuation driven enhancement of Sxx\nNext, we discuss the origin of the kink in the Sxx(T) curves across TC. Based on Equation (1), Sxx can be modulated by changes to both N(E) and \u03c4(E) by the magnetic phase transition. Before discussing these quantities, we first elaborate on the nature of magnetic fluctuations above TC. Focusing on the magnetic field dependence of Sxx is a rational method of investigating the influence that magnetic fluctuations have on the thermoelectric response41. Fig. 3a shows Sxx in an external magnetic field B = 0 (filled symbols) and 9 T (empty symbols). To quantify the magnetic field-dependent contribution, |\u2206SB(T)|=|Sxx(T)B = 9 T - Sxx(T)B = 0 T| is defined (see hatched area in Fig. 3a). Here, B = 9 T is chosen to be large enough compared to saturation field to completely suppress magnetic fluctuations in a wide temperature region both above and below TC 38. As the application of a magnetic field 9 T suppresses magnetic fluctuations, the quantity |\u2206SB(T)| can be considered a measure of the magnetic fluctuation-related contributions to Sxx in the absence of a magnetic field (Fig. 2). Such method was previously employed in studying the magnetic fluctuation enhancement of the thermopower in Heusler alloys12. In our case, while |\u2206SB (T)| for two doping levels \u03b4 = 0.34 and 0.40 are negligible, |\u2206SB(T)| becomes prominent for other three doping levels \u03b4 = 0.5, 0.54, and 0.68. This observation indicates that Sxx responds more sensitively to an external magnetic field around \u03b4 = 0.5, which results in a maximum |\u0394SB(T)| at TC around this doping level, as opposed to a monotonic increase of |\u2206SB(TC)| with \u03b4. Hereafter, we discuss the intertwined microscopic nature of the magnetic fluctuations and the enhancement in Sxx, focusing on the critical doping level \u03b4 ~ 0.5, which we designate \u03b4c."

            "text": "We begin by discussing the microscopic picture of the fluctuating magnetism around TC. The conventional mean-field picture for explaining magnetism in metals is known as the Stoner model. In this model, spindegenerate bands are split into majority and minority spin bands separated by an exchange energy that is associated with the energetic cost of transitioning from paramagnetic states (T > TC) to magnetically ordered states (T < TC) 42. An abrupt change in the band structure occurs near TC per this interpretation. However, this conventional Stoner model can be excluded as the origin of the magnetic behavior in our system, as we observe signature of magnetic fluctuation far above TC (Fig. 3b-c). As an alternative, we invoke the two pictures of the microscopic origins of magnetic fluctuations. The first picture is spin fluctuation theory, which has succeeded in explaining the physical properties of itinerant magnetism in various materials43. The second picture relies on the collective propagations of magnetic spin precessions, known as magnons, which emerge in localized magnetically ordered states. Spin fluctuations in itinerant electron systems predominantly influence the\nthermodynamic properties of weakly or nearly ferromagnetic metals, and such spin fluctuations can survive well above TC. Although the conventional formalism of magnons supports their dominant existence only below the Curie and N\u00e9el temperatures (TC and TN) of localized, magnetically-ordered systems 44, magnon excitations have been shown to persist above TC in the so-called paramagnon regime 45."

            "text": "To discern the nature of the magnetic fluctuations enhancing the thermopower, examining the exponents of the logarithmic thermopower temperature dependence has been recognized as a fruitful approach 12. The exponent of |\u0394SB(T)| up to TC was used to clarify the origin of the magnetic fluctuation enhanced thermopower. This approach is underpinned by microscopic models of the magnetic fluctuation contributions to the specific heat (Cmag), which are reflected in the thermopower temperature dependence below the transition temperature 12. While an itinerant spin fluctuation picture does not support the existence of a well-defined logarithmic temperature dependence46, the magnon picture does support a logarithmic temperature dependence47. Based on the hydrodynamic theory of magnon-electron drag44 |\u0394Sxx| can be expressed as:\n|8 | = ' 9:;< = >:/ :. Here, \u03c4em is the electron-magnon scattering time and \u03c4A is the total magnon scattering time for all magnon scattering events (i.e., electron-magnon, phonon-magnon, magnon-magnon) respectively. Note that \u03c4em \u2265 \u03c4m holds by definition. If \u03c4em >> \u03c4m holds (indicating weak electron-magnon coupling), the drag contribution in Sxx becomes negligible. On the other hand, if \u03c4em ~ \u03c4m holds (indicating strong electron-magnon coupling), then the temperature dependence of drag contribution in Sxx(T) is governed by Cmag(T). Importantly, based on magnon picture, Cmag(T) shows logarithmic temperature dependence T n, and Cmag of FM and AFM magnons are known to exhibit n ~ 1.5 and n ~ 3, respectively47. In our case, |\u0394SB| is expected to reflect |\u0394Sxx|, and it is a reasonable simplification not to consider a phonon drag contribution since our |\u0394SB| is dominated nearby magnetic phase transition temperature TC."

From this plot, the existence of a logarithmic temperature dependence of |\u0394SB(T)| near TC is visually discernable from the linear dependence. Indeed, around TC, a clear linearity can be recognized from log(\u2206SB) vs. log(T) plots of the three doping levels \u03b4 = 0.5, 0.54, and 0.68. From the fitting of the temperature region between TC and ~ 100 K below Tc at each doping level, the exponents n for three doping levels \u03b4 = 0.5, 0.54, and 0.68 are 3.2, 2.8, and 2.7, respectively (see lined in Fig. 3b-d). We also show the temperature dependence of the slope as defined by following equation ( ) {log( ) - log( )}/ log( ) B n T S T T= \u2202 \u2206 \u2202 . From the plot shown in Fig. 3e, this slope n is almost constant near TC, and the averaged estimated value of n at each of the three doping levels in this temperature region is around n ~ 3. Phenomenologically, our observation of an n = 3 at three different doping levels of B \u2265 B9 strongly implies the existence of AF magnon\ndrag with \u03c4em ~ \u03c4m, rather than an n ~ 1.5 based FM magnon picture. While the drag effect is seen mainly at very low temperatures where electron-boson coupling is strong, our magnon case shows a dominant drag contribution around TC. The potential reason leading to \u03c4em ~ \u03c4m is our nature of magnetism in our system, which at the cusp of itinerant and localized magnetism. Although quantifying \u03c4em and \u03c4m are generally challenging, similar magnon contributions have been observed near TC in several magnetic materials 48,49,50."

This notion is supported by the fact that E0-EF=0 is realized around \u03b4c ~ 0.5. As indicated previously, while a metallic hole band occurs near the \u0393 point at all doping levels, a pseudogap in the density of states at EF occurs exclusively at \u03b4c (see Fig. 1c and d). Therefore, we suspect that enhanced magnetic fluctuations alongside the pseudogap formation at EF in the \u03b4c sample cooperatively drive the observed enhancement in the zero-field thermoelectric energy conversion around TC. There are two paradigms by which to interpret such a cooperation. The first relies solely on the experimentally observed band structure around the M point from ARPES, disregarding the energy dependence of the scattering rate \u03c4(E). This picture is justified by the factor 1/N(E) in an application of Equation (2) to our observations, since the position E0 - EF = 0 is expected to lead a dip in N(E) (i.e., a pseudogap). A second and more holistic paradigm would be to consider the asymmetry in \u03c4(E) relative to EF, in addition to expected pseudogap in N(E). For instance, such asymmetric \u03c4(E) can be realized if a characteristic energy for an electronic state sensitive to the spin orientation and its fluctuations exists away from EF. Although modeling of the microscopic underpinnings of these observations in Sxx is anticipated as a future undertaking, it can be expected that a significant spin-orbit coupling effect arising from the presence of the heavy element Te plays a role in bridging between the spin and charge degrees of freedom near EF in Cr1+\u03b4Te2."
