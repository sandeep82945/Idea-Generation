 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Evaluate In-30 at later time points (48h, 72h etc.) to further characterize its pharmacokinetics and tumor retention. The paper suggests 24h was not a long enough timepoint. 

2. Modify the glutamate moiety of the EuK targeting vector in In-30 to reduce kidney uptake. The paper suggests replacing glutamate with aspartate or other amino acids could improve tumor-to-kidney ratios.

3. Explore different dimerization strategies or linkers to optimize the design of dimeric ligands like In-30. The 6-carbon linker seemed to improve stability but other designs could further enhance tumor uptake or retention.

4. Evaluate In-30 as a theranostic pair with a therapeutic radionuclide like Lutetium-177 or Actinium-225. The paper suggests In-30 has promising characteristics for radioligand therapy.  

5. Use an in vivo pretargeting approach with In-30 to reduce kidney uptake. Administer the radiolabeled DOTA-TCO first, then inject the dimerized compound 29 later when tumor-to-kidney ratios are optimal.
