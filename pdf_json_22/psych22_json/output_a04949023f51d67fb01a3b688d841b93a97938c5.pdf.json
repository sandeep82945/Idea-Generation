            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "Individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulties with controlling their behavior appropriately with respect to environmental demands. Two key cognitive systems that control our behavior with respect to the environment are the Pavlovian and instrumental systems (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002; Dolan and Dayan, 2013). Especially problems in Pavlovian control of goal-oriented instrumental behaviors are associated with a wide variety of psychiatric problems (e.g., Dayan et al., 2006; Heinz et al., 2016; Hallquist et al., 2018). This form of behavioral control might be key to adaptive inhibitory control which has since long been proposed to be central to understanding problems in ADHD (Barkley, 1997). Moreover, aberrant Pavlovian control over instrumental behavior can lead to maladaptive impulsivity in animals as well as in humans (Breland and Breland, 1961; Guitart-Masip et al., 2014; HinojosaAguayo and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2020). This form of control has been shown to depend on monoaminergic transmission relevant for understanding ADHD (Dalley and Roiser, 2012; Geurts et al., 2013b; Salamone et al., 2015) and can specifically be modulated by methylphenidate (Swart et al., 2017). Nevertheless, it has received relatively little attention in human and animal ADHD research (Natsheh and Shiflett, 2015). To fill this gap in the literature, we tested whether Pavlovian control of instrumental behavior [i.e., Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT)] is related to clinically relevant impulsivity/hyperactivity in ADHD. Therefore, we first compared Pavlovian control in adult ADHD patients diagnosed with and without clinically relevant impulsivity/hyperactivity. Second, we assessed the hypothesis that a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), i.e., an 8-week training program theoretically related to amending automatic tendencies (Segal et al., 2002) and shown to improve impulsivity/hyperactivity in ADHD (Janssen et al., 2018), should, accordingly, also modulate Pavlovian inhibitory control.\nA wide range of animals, including humans, are endowed with mechanisms shaped throughout evolution that drive behavior (Dolan and Dayan, 2013). These drivers take advantage of environmental information carried by stimuli that predict motivationally salient future events or outcomes. The instrumental control system enables us to use specific actions when confronted with a certain stimulus to obtain a specific outcome (i.e., stimulus-action-outcome learning or operant conditioning). This system allows us to optimize our chances to achieve specific goals by learning when to exert specific actions and when not to act. Complementary to this instrumental control system, the Pavlovian control system regulates automatic, motivational responses in reaction to external and internal stimuli (Dolan and Dayan, 2013).\nThis system enables us to associate neutral stimuli with motivationally salient outcomes in the environment (i.e., stimulus-outcome learning or classical conditioning). These neutral stimuli acquire part of the motivational properties of the outcome they are associated with (i.e., predict). When encountering these previously neutral, but now conditioned, stimuli (CS) again, the automatic preparatory reaction to the outcome will be elicited in response to these Pavlovian CSs. Critically, it has long been recognized that these two behavioral control systems do not act in separation, but interact. Pavlovian CS can (de) motivate ongoing instrumental behavior based on the valence (appetitive or aversive) of the Pavlovian CS (Rescorla and Solomon, 1967): Pavlovian CS that predict punishment (i.e., aversive Pavlovian CS) have the tendency to inhibit, whereas Pavlovian CS that predict reward (i.e., appetitive Palvovian CS) can activate instrumental behavior (Rescorla and Solomon, 1967; Huys et al., 2011; Geurts et al., 2013a). These interactions between instrumental and Pavlovian control of behavior are thought to be shaped by evolution and have adaptive properties in terms timing actions (i.e., when to make, and when not to make an action) to optimize gaining rewards and avoiding punishment at relatively low computational cost (Dolan and Dayan, 2013). However, too much or too little influence of the Pavlovian system on instrumental behavior has been proposed as a driver of several maladaptive behaviors (e.g., Dayan et al., 2006; Heinz et al., 2016; Hallquist et al., 2018). Too much potentiation of instrumental behavior by appetitive cues, or too little inhibition by aversive cues is linked to impulsive behavior in real life (Watson et al., 2014; Garbusow et al., 2016; Heinz et al., 2016; Hallquist et al., 2018). This latter source of disinhibition, i.e., disinhibition in the face of aversive affect, has been widely recognized to play a role in externalizing psychopathology, mainly under the umbrella of negative urgency (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Negative urgency has recently indeed been related to Pavlovian control of instrumental behavior in healthy controls (Hinojosa-Aguayo and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2020). However, whether the impact of appetitive activating and aversive inhibitory processes on instrumental behavior contributes to impulsivity/hyperactivity in ADHD remains an open question. We will test this specific hypothesis in ADHD patients diagnosed with and without clinically relevant impulsivity/hyperactivity symptomatology. Specifically, we compare patients diagnosed with the DSM-IV combined or hyperactive/impulsive subtype (both including relevant impulsive-hyperactive symptomatology) with those with the primarily inattentive subtype (without diagnosed impulsivity/hyperactivity).\nThe hypothesis that both increased appetitive PIT and decreased aversive PIT might drive impulsivity in ADHD can only be tested causally through an intervention study. A key prediction is that effective treatment of ADHD\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nshould modulatethe effect of Pavlovian cues on instrumental behavior. One candidate for this is MBCT. MBCT has significant beneficial effects in ADHD (Cairncross and Miller, 2016; Gu et al., 2017; Hepark et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2018), as well as impulsivity symptoms trans-diagnostically (Franco et al., 2016). It is a highly protocolled intervention that changes how patients deal with thoughts, emotions, bodily feelings and urges in reaction to both external and internal stimuli. Patients become more aware of internal and external triggers and consequent automatic patterns such as avoidance of aversive stimuli or attachment to appetitive stimuli, and learn to (initially) disengage from automatic reactivity (Segal et al., 2002, p. 217). Indeed, MBCT has been shown to reduce impulsivity/hyperactivity (Gu et al., 2017; Hepark et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2018), improve selfreported adaptive inhibition (Hepark et al., 2017; Janssen et al., 2018) and increases experimentally measured behavioral inhibition (see for meta-analyses and critical notes; Lao et al., 2016; Vago et al., 2019). Moreover, previous findings from our group suggest that effects of MBCT on selfreported adaptive inhibition mediated the effects of MBCT on clinician rated ADHD symptoms (Geurts et al., 2020). Taken together, to test the hypothesis that aberrant PIT may drive impulsive responding in ADHD, we will assess whether MBCT changes the inhibitory or activating effects of Pavlovian cues. In line with the hypothesized relation between impulsivity and Pavlovian control, we expect MBCT to diminish the motivating effect of appetitive Pavlovian CS and to enhance the inhibiting effect of aversive Pavlovian CS on instrumental behavior, leading to more inhibition and less impulsivity/hyperactivity, respectively."

We assessed these differential associations at baseline by assessing differences in PIT between the combined subtype (including hyperactivity-impulsivity) and the inattentive subtype (not including hyperactivity/impulsivity) of ADHD. Thus, we employed two generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) with, respectively, Pavlovian CS Appetitive (SP++ /SPn) and Aversive (SPn/SP\u2013\u2013 as within subject factor and ADHD subtype (combined/inattentive) as between-subject factor.\nSecond, to test whether MBCT modulated appetitive and aversive PIT we used a GLMM including the within-subject factors Pavlovian CS Valence (5 levels: SP++/Sp+/SPn/SP\u2212/SP\u2013\u2013) and Day (Pre vs. Post treatment), and the between-subject factors Treatment Group (TAU+MBCT vs. TAU).\nWe used GLMMs to account for both between- and withinsubject variability. We used the lme4 package in R (Bates et al., 2015; R Development Core Team, 2015). All GLMMs included all main effects and interactions as well as a full random effects structure to reduce inflation of Type I error (Barr et al., 2013).\nFurthermore, to interpret the results of the above analyses as true changes in the interaction between Pavlovian and instrumental control, i.e., PIT, there should be no differences between the Treatment groups in task performance during the instrumental and Pavlovian training per se on Day 1 or a difference in change between the Groups from pre- to post treatment in these parts of the training. We assessed whether this was the case by using, where appropriate, t-tests and repeated measure ANOVA\u2019s with, respectively, average performance at the end of the instrumental training stage (mean correct after more than 5 stimulus presentations), average performance at the end of Pavlovian training (mean correct after more than 5 query trials) and VAS ratings from pre-to post Pavlovian conditioning as dependent variables.\nWe note, that we did not pursue analysis of reaction time, because previous reports (Huys et al., 2011; Geurts et al., 2013b) with this paradigm did not find any meaningful effects on this outcome measure."

This prediction, however, remained untested for ADHD. We present two key findings. First, an ADHD diagnosis with clinically relevant impulsivity/hyperactivity was accompanied by an absence of aversive Pavlovian inhibition, while an ADHD diagnosis without clinically relevant impulsivity/hyperactivity was accompanied by the expected aversive Pavlovian inhibition, akin to multiple healthy control studies (e.g., Huys et al., 2011; Geurts et al., 2013a). In contrast to our expectations, we did not find a relation between appetitive Pavlovian activation and impulsivity/hyperactivity. Second, within a randomized controlled setting, MBCT enhanced this aversive Pavlovian inhibition across the whole group of patients.\nBoth our findings, the relation between impulsivity/hyperactivity and aversive Pavlovian inhibition and the strengthening of this inhibition through MBCT in ADHD, are particularly interesting when considering the wide ranging, adaptive effects of Pavlovian inhibitory processes in more detail. Pavlovian conditioned reactions have long been recognized to help the organism prepare (in a fast and computationally efficient manner) for the\npredicted outcome (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002). In case of appetitive outcomes these \u201cpreparations\u201d increase the chances to benefit from this outcome. In the case of aversive outcomes, the Pavlovian behavioral reactions (e.g., inhibition) might prevent damage to the organism. Allowing predictors of aversive outcome (i.e., aversive Pavlovian CS) to influence behavior thus might instigate adaptive behavior. Moreover, aberrant Pavlovian mechanisms, e.g., too much appetitive attraction and/or too little aversive inhibition, are thought to play a role in psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, different anxiety disorders, addiction (Huys et al., 2015; Heinz et al., 2016; Mkrtchian et al., 2017) and personality disorders associated with impulsive behaviors (Ly et al., 2016; Hallquist et al., 2018). It has been proposed that not only actions are under the influence of Pavlovian inhibitory mechanisms, but also our thoughts (Huys et al., 2012; Mendelsohn et al., 2014). Indeed, Huys et al. (2012); and Lally et al. (2017) recently provided empirical evidence that Pavlovian inhibitory processes have a central place in planning action sequences. This warrants future studies on the Pavlovian inhibitory mechanisms in especially impulsivity/hyperactivity in ADHD and with respect to MBCT that might advance our understanding of the\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org\nneurocognitive mechanisms of both ADHD and the workings of MBCT, respectively.\nOne question that follows from the current study is why ADHD patients with clinically diagnosed impulsivity/hyperactivity lack the aversive Pavlovian inhibition we normally observe in healthy populations (Huys et al., 2011; Geurts et al., 2013a) and in ADHD patients without overt impulsivity/hyperactivity (this study). First, we note that instrumental and Pavlovian stimulus-outcome contingencies were learned by these patients as well as by the non-impulsive/hyperactive patients: Performance on query trials during conditioning nor (changes in) VAS-ratings of the Pavlovian stimuli across Pavlovian conditioning nor instrumental performance differed between these patient groups. Thus, the difference in aversive PIT cannot be readily explained by differences in learning. Moreover, it is not likely that within the PIT stage, these aversive Pavlovian CS were simply not noticed, because Pavlovian CS with appetitive valence exerted their normal (invigorating) effect (Huys et al., 2011). Thus, the absence of the inhibitory effect has to be searched downstream, in the interaction effect of Pavlovian and instrumental information itself. On a cognitive-psychological level this interaction effect might only surface when the aversive predictions are processed and used as guidance for steering instrumental behavior. Disturbances might thus come about through not processing the aversive information as relevant for behavioral procedures. The finding that patients showed increased effects of aversive Pavlovian stimuli post MBCT might be informative from this perspective. First, we note that the finding that MBCT increases the effect of aversive Pavlovian CS is in general accordance with a recent report on aversive Pavlovian conditioning (i.e., fear conditioning) before and after Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)(H\u00f6lzel et al., 2016). This study showed that through MBSR, healthy controls remained sensitive, as revealed by psychophysiological responses to the aversive Pavlovian CS (predictive of electrical shocks), whereas participants in the waitlist group lost this sensitivity. Our finding extends this result by showing that MBCT might potentiate the inhibitory effect of an aversive Pavlovian CS in adult ADHD patients. We speculate that this might be due to more openness to guiding information of contexts predicting adversity, instead of avoiding aversive information, in combination with an enhanced tendency to not immediately react, facilitated by the training. Moreover, on a neurophysiological level it has been shown that aversive Pavlovian inhibition depends on serotonergic signaling (Crockett et al., 2009; Geurts et al., 2013b; den Ouden et al., 2015) and is also influenced by methylphenidate suggesting catecholaminergic involvement (Swart et al., 2017). On a speculative account, we hypothesize that aberrant monoaminergic signaling\nrelated to Pavlovian control might be at the roots of this disinhibition, paralleling the psychological process by which aversive information guides instrumental behavior. Moreover, our data suggest that this process can be changed by MBCT.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be noted: First we note that our relatively small sample size precluded us from assessing differential aspects of MBCT on the patients with the combined vs. the inattentive subtype of ADHD. This could have strengthened (or disproved) the suggestion that MBCT specifically remedies maladaptive aversive disinhibition. Moreover, including another active control treatment could have substantiated suggestions about the specificity of our result with regards to MBCT. With regard to the PIT paradigm, we think this might be improved by using a more naturalistic cover story (subjects informally reported that the game was boring) and more salient reinforcers (e.g., food, taste, shock, noise), which might make the task more ecologically valid and putatively more sensitive to change. Adding eye-tracking to this paradigm might also help to establish attentional components of the uncovered effect (e.g., more dwelling at the Pavlovian CS then at the instrumental stimulus) which might help to better understand the interindividual differences found here. Finally, because this paradigm has been shown to be sensitive to catecholaminergic modulation by methylphenidate and the current study suggests that it is also sensitive to change due to MBCT, it is interesting for future studies to assess whether this paradigm could have differential predictive properties in terms of treatment response for both pharmacological as well as psychotherapeutic interventions in ADHD.\nIn sum, our data suggests that the combined, but not the inattentive subtype of ADHD is associated with diminished aversive Pavlovian inhibition and that MBCT can enhance this inhibition. These findings offer new insights in the neurocognitive mechanisms of hyperactivity/impulsivity in the combined subtype of ADHD and point toward MBCT as an intervention that might influence these mechanisms."
