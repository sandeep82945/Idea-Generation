However, MRI, and particularly longitudinal MRI, is known to be time consuming. To accelerate imaging, compressed sensing (CS) theory has been applied to exploit sparsity, both on single image as on image sequence level. State-of-the-art CS methods however, are generally focused on image reconstruction, and consider analysis (e.g., alignment, change detection) as a post-processing step. In this study, we propose DELTA-MRI, a novel framework to estimate longitudinal image changes directly from a reference image and subsequently acquired, strongly subsampled MRI k-space data. In contrast to state-of-the-art longitudinal CS based imaging, our method avoids the conventional multi-step process of image reconstruction of subsequent images, image alignment, and deformation vector field computation. Instead, the set of follow-up images, along with motion and deformation vector fields that describe their relation to the reference image, are estimated in one go. Experiments show that DELTA-MRI performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art in terms of the normalized reconstruction error.",

Experiments show that DELTA-MRI performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art in terms of the normalized reconstruction error.\nIndex Terms\u2014 Longitudinal MRI, deformation vector field, DELTA-MRI\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn longitudinal MRI studies, repeated MRI scans are performed in specific clinical scenarios, such as follow up of patients [1], therapy response assessment [2], and large-scale longitudinal studies [3]. They constitute one of the most efficient tools to track pathology changes and to evaluate treatment efficacy in diseases. In such studies, patients are scanned on a regular basis, which calls for efficient longitudinal scan protocols.\nConventional longitudinal MRI workflows consist of multiple steps. First, complex-valued image data is acquired (in k-space) at different time points, from which (also complexvalued) images are individually reconstructed. Next, the magnitudes of the resulting images are mutually geometrically aligned. Finally, local structural deformations are detected by computing deformation vector fields, allowing for voxel-wise deformation analysis [4].\nUnfortunately, conventional longitudinal MRI workflows are characterized by a low time efficiency. To accelerate imaging, techniques based on compressed sensing (CS) theory have been applied that exploit sparsity in some spatial transform domain and reconstruct images from substantially less data (through k-space sub-sampling) [5]. Furthermore, since changes between two subsequent images in a longitudinal MRI study are generally small (apart from global transformations), temporal redundancy can be additionally exploited to shorten image acquisition time. Indeed, CS-based methods have successfully been applied to also accelerate longitudinal MRI scanning by extending spatial regularization with temporal regularization [6\u20139]. Such methods, however, require careful tuning of multiple regularization parameters to balance sparsity constraints (both in spatial and time domain) and data consistency, leading to impractical methods. Alternatively, deep learning methods have been investigated to automatically detect and exploit the distribution of expected images in both the spatial [10] and temporal [11, 12] domain. However, most data driven methods strongly rely on extensive training with a large number of datasets, which is especially non-trivial to obtain for longitudinal MRI applications.\nIn this paper, we propose DELTA-MRI, a novel framework to estimate longitudinal image deformations directly from a reference image and subsequently acquired, strongly sub-sampled MRI k-space data. In contrast to state-of-theart longitudinal MR image reconstruction methods, which rely on the image reconstruction followed by deformation vector field estimation, our method avoids this multi-step process. Instead, the set of follow-up images, along with motion parameters and deformation vector fields that describe their relation to the reference image, are estimated in one go.\nar X\niv :2\n30 1.\n09 45\n5v 1\n[ ee\nss .I\nV ]\n2 3\nJa n\nWe will show that DELTA-MRI performs significantly better compared to state-of-the-art CS based longitudinal MRI methods in terms of the normalized reconstructed error.\n2. METHODS\nLet x1 = {x1,k},x2 = {x2,k} \u2208 CN be two complex valued 3D MRI images withN voxels in the image domain, of which the elements can be expressed in polar form as\nxj,k = rj,ke i\u03c6j,k , with j = 1, 2 ; k = 1, ..., N (1)\nand with rj = {rj,k} \u2208 RN and \u03c6j = {\u03c6j,k} \u2208 RN the magnitude and phase of xj , respectively. Furthermore, let d1,d2 \u2208 CN be the k-space (Fourier) representations of x1,x2, respectively: dj = Fxj , with F \u2208 CN\u00d7N the discrete Fourier transform operator. Finally, let v \u2208 RN\u00d73 be a deformation vector field (DVF), comprised of one 3D vector per voxel, describing the geometrical deformation from r1 to r2, and let W (\u00b7,v) denote the image warping operator [13] along v that (approximately) yields r2 when applied to r1:\nW (r1,v) = r2 . (2)\nWe propose the estimation of v directly from k-space measurements of x1 and x2. These measurements, which will be denoted by {d\u0303j}2j=1 \u2208 Cnj , are noise disturbed and can be modelled as:\nd\u0303j = SjFxj + \u03b5j , with j = 1, 2 (3)\nwhere \u03b5j \u2208 Cnj is an additive noise contribution, modeled as a zero-mean, complex-valued Gaussian random variable, and Sj \u2208 {0, 1}nj\u00d7N , with nj \u2264 N , is a sub-sampling operator that selects the k-space points acquired for the j-th image. For fully sampled k-space data, denoted by d\u0303j , the operator Sj corresponds with the identity matrix I \u2208 RN\u00d7N .\nIn what follows, it is assumed that sufficient k-space data d\u03031 is acquired to allow a high quality reconstruction r\u03021 of the reference magnitude image r1. If fully sampled data d\u03031 is available, such an estimate can be calculated as r\u03021 = |F\u22121d\u03031|, with | \u00b7 | the point-wise modulus operator. Furthermore, it is assumed that the phase \u03c62 is slowly varying and that the low frequencies in k-space are sufficiently sampled to obtain a good estimate of \u03c62 by calculating \u03c6\u03022 = \u2220(F\u22121d\u03032), where d\u03032 is zero-filled at the non-sampled indices and \u2220(\u00b7) denotes the phase operator. Under these assumptions, v can be directly estimated by minimizing a regularized least-squares functional without requiring the reconstruction of x2:\nv\u0302 = argmin v\n( \u2016d\u03032 \u2212 S2FW (r\u03021,v)ei\u03c6\u03022\u201622 + \u03bbR(v) ) ,\n(4) with \u03bbR(v) a regularization term with weight \u03bb that imposes prior knowledge about v. In this work, R(v) is chosen equal\nto \u2016\u2207v\u20162, with \u2207 the gradient operator. This choice reflects the assumption that r2 only differs from r1 by a local, smooth deformation, for which this regularization term is small.\nIn practice, x2 will likely also differ from x1 by a rigid transformation, on top of the local deformation. This transformation can be included in the DVF v, but then v will no longer be mostly zero. Alternatively, the rigid transformation can be isolated from the DVF, and represented by rotation and translation parameters \u03b8, t \u2208 R3. Eq. (4) can then be extended as follows:\n{v\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, t\u0302} = arg min \u03b8,t,v (\u2016d\u03032 \u2212 SFW (r\u03021,\u03b8, t, v)ei\u03c6\u03022\u201622\n+\u03bbR(v)) , (5)\nwhere W (\u00b7,\u03b8, t, v) is an image warping operator that rotates the image according to \u03b8, translates the image according to t and then applies the local deformation described by v. The optimization problem of Eq. (5) can be solved using the cyclic Block Coordinate Descent (cBCD) method [14], where the first block consists of the parameters \u03b8 and t and the second block consist of v. In what follows, the initial estimates of v, t and \u03b8 will be denoted as v0, t0 and \u03b80, respectively.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\nHigh-resolution, fully-sampled k-space data was acquired using a Cartesian sampling scheme of a male C57BL/6 wildtype mouse using a 9.4T Biospec 94/20 USR horizontal MR system (Bruker Biospin MRI, Ettlingen, Germany), with a mouse head 2\u00d72 array cryo-coil (Bruker Biospin MRI, Ettlingen, Germany), using a 3D T2-weighted Turbo-RARE sequence with FOV: 20\u00d7 15\u00d7 10 mm3, image acquisition matrix: 256 \u00d7 192 \u00d7 128, 0.078 mm isotropic voxels, TE/TR: 67.2/1800 ms, RARE factor: 12. The fully-sampled multicoil k-space data was then averaged across the coils to obtain d\u03032.\nBased on the experimentally acquired dataset, simulation experiments were setup to validate DELTA-MRI. First, a complex valued image x2 = F\u22121d\u03032 was reconstructed, with corresponding magnitude r2 and phase \u03c62. From r2, a predefined rigid transform (\u03b8, t), and a predefined DVF v, a magnitude image r1 was constructed using an inverse image warp, such that W (r1,\u03b8, t,v) = r2. Fig. 1a shows a cross section of the ground truth DVF v. The ground truth parameter values of \u03b8 and t were given by (2.9\u25e6, 4.0\u25e6, 5.7\u25e6) and (\u22126,\u22125,\u22124.5) pixels, respectively. Fig. 2a, 2b, and 2c show cross sections of r1, its fully aligned version W (r1,\u03b8, t,0), and r2, respectively. Since DELTA-MRI does not depend on the phase of the reference image, its evaluation does not require the simulation of \u03c61. However, as will be described below, DELTA-MRI was benchmarked against a state-ofthe-art method that does depend on \u03c61 and assumes it to be similar to \u03c62. Therefore, a complex valued image x1 with magnitude r1 was constructed, by setting \u03c61 = \u03c62. This\ncomplex image was polluted with complex, Gaussian distributed white noise with standard deviation equal to 4% of the average foreground value of r1. We denote this noise disturbed image by x\u03021 and its magnitude and phase by r\u03021 and \u03c6\u03021, respectively. Next, a sub-sampling operator S2 was applied that under-samples d\u03032 by selecting a given percentage of the k-space data points. In particular, a small cubic central area was complemented by k-space points that were randomly drawn from a central Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation that corresponds with a quarter of the maximum frequency. Illustrative examples of the thus designed sampling schemes are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c. Finally, v, \u03b8 and t, were estimated from the under-sampled k-space data d\u03032 using the estimator described by Eq. (5). The experiments were repeated for different sub-sampling percentages.\nImplementation details: The optimization task of Eq. (5) was carried out using a cBCD approach with v0, t0 and \u03b80 all zero. The value of \u03bbwas set to \u03bb0\u00b75\u00b710\u22125, where \u03bb0 = \u2016d\u03032\u201622 maintains the regularization strength when varying the sampling scheme. This value was obtained by empirically minimizing the reconstruction error at 1% Gaussian sub-sampling. In the first block, \u03b8 and t were optimized with the L-BFGS-B method of SciPy 1.9.3 [15], with default stopping criteria and bounds t \u2208 [\u221220, 20]3,\u03b8 \u2208 [\u22120.3 rad, 0.3 rad]3. In the second block, v was optimized with the Barzilai-Borwein gradient method [16] with 2000 iterations to ensure convergence.\nThe derivatives of the objective function towards the deformation parameters were computed using ImWIP [13, 17]. Because the deformation is local, the initial estimate v0 was close enough to give an accurate estimation of \u03b8 and t. Therefore, each block was optimized only once. It was verified that adding more cycles did not change the results significantly.\nBenchmarking: DELTA-MRI was benchmarked against the Temporal Compressed Sensing MRI (TCS-MRI) method [6], which regularizes the reconstruction of the complex image x2 in the temporal and wavelet domain, by solving\nx\u03022 = argmin x2 (\u2016d\u03032 \u2212 S2Fx2\u201622 +\u03bb1\u2016diag(w)(x\u03021 \u2212 x2)\u20161 + \u03bb2\u2016\u03a8x2\u20161), (6)\nwith \u03a8 the Daubechies-4 wavelet transform and w a weight vector that controls the demand for similarity between x1 and x2, enforcing sparsity only in regions where x1 and x2 are similar. In our experiments,w was fixed to the support of the ground truth DVF.\nIt should be noted that TCS-MRI assumes that the rigid transformation aligning x1 and x2 is known. DELTA-MRI does not make this assumption, and instead estimates the rigid transformation, along with v, from the available, sub-sampled data. In each experiment, the rigid transformation estimated by DELTA-MRI was used to align the data before using TCSMRI. Furthermore, the regularization weights \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 in Eq. (6) were set to \u03bb0 \u00b7 5.85 \u00b7 10\u22129 and \u03bb0 \u00b7 3.63 \u00b7 10\u221210, respectively, where \u03bb0 = \u2016d\u03032\u201622 maintains the regularization strength when varying the sampling scheme. These values were obtained by empirical tuning to optimize reconstruction quality at 1% Gaussian sampling.\nTo evaluate how much information on r2 was present in d\u03032, and how much information was obtained from x\u03021, the results of TCS-MRI and DELTA-MRI were compared against a reconstruction obtained from d\u03032 alone by applying an inverse DFT to the zero filled data d\u03032. This method is denoted Z-IDFT.\nPerformance criterion: As a quantitative performance criterion, the normalized reconstruction error of the reconstructed image r\u03022 was calculated as:\n(r\u03022) = \u2016r\u03022 \u2212 r2\u20162/\u2016r\u03021 \u2212 r2\u20162 , (7)\nwhere r\u03022 :=W (r\u03021, \u03b8\u0302, t\u0302, v\u0302) for DELTA-MRI.\n4. RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nFigure 3 shows reconstruction results obtained from Gaussian sub-sampled k-space data with sub-sampling percentages equal to 5% and 1%. The left column shows (a cross-section of) the Z-IDFT reconstruction of r2. The middle and right column show the reconstructions of r2 obtained by TCS-MRI and DELTA-MRI, respectively. Figure 4 shows the normalized reconstruction error (7) as a function of the sub-sampling percentage for Z-IDFT, TCS-MRI and DELTA-MRI.\nThe results show that for sub-sampling percentages up to 20%, DELTA-MRI outperforms Z-IDFT and TCS-MRI . Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows that for a sub-sampling percentage below around 13%, TCS-MRI outperforms Z-IDF, whereas for higher sub-sampling percentages Z-IDF outperforms TCSMRI. This can be explained as follows. In our simulation study, the weights of the regularization terms and data-misfit term that together constitute the cost function of Eq. (6) were kept proportional to each other and were tuned to be optimal for a sub-sampling percentage of 1%. For increasing\nsub-sampling percentages, these regularization settings lead to over-regularization, causing TCS-MRI to be outperformed by Z-IDF beyond a certain turning point. Alternatively, the regularization settings of TCS-MRI and Delta-MRI could be optimized for each sub-sampling percentage individually, resulting in reduced reconstruction errors for all sub-sampling percentages excluding 1%. However, this approach would not be realistic, as in practice ground truth images are not available and regularization settings are typically sub-optimal.\nAdditionally, some remarks can be made about the comparison between DELTA-MRI and TCS-MRI. First, unlike DELTA-MRI, TCS-MRI assumes the phases of x1 and x2 to be similar. This assumption is reflected by the first regularization term of Eq. (6), which enforces similarity of x1 and x2 in the complex domain. In the simulation experiments, the ground truth phases \u03c61 and \u03c62 were chosen equal to meet this assumption, providing optimal conditions for TCS-MRI. In practice, however, the assumption of similar phase images may be violated, which may negatively affect the performance of TCS-MRI. Second, as mentioned above, unlike DELTAMRI, TCS-MRI does not include an alignment procedure, assuming that the rigid transformation aligning the images x1 and x2 is known beforehand. To allow a fair comparison that accounts for this difference, the rigid transformation estimated by DELTA-MRI was used to align the data before applying TCS-MRI. TCS-MRI could have been combined with alternative alignment procedures , but this is not expected to change the main conclusions of the comparison.\nThe current work has some limitations that will be addressed in future work. First, while the current version of DELTA-MRI was designed for single-coil data, the method can be extended to account for multi-coil data, taking coil sensitivities into account. Furthermore, to facilitate experiments with prospectively under-sampled longitudinal data, the Gaussian distributed sampling schemes used to evaluate DELTA-MRI in this work can be replaced by sampling schemes that are practically more feasible.\nFinally, it is worthwhile mentioning that the problem of determining a DVF that deforms a source image to a target image is underdetermined. In other words, many DVFs may transform the source image to the same target image. This is known as the aperture problem [18, 19]. For this reason, in simulation experiments, the quality of a DVF estimate is not appropriately measured in terms of its deviation from the ground truth DVF, but in terms of the difference between the ground truth target image and the image that is obtained by geometrically deforming the source image according to the estimated DVF. This motivates the use of the reconstruction error Eq. (7) as a performance criterion in this work.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWe proposed DELTA-MRI, a novel framework that estimates longitudinal image changes directly from a reference image\nand strongly sub-sampled k-space data of a follow-up image. The DVF and motion parameters that describe the relation between the reference image and the follow-up image are estimated in one-go. For sub-sampling percentages up to 20%, DELTA-MRI was shown to outperform a state-of-the-art longitudinal CS based method in terms of reconstruction error.\n6.
