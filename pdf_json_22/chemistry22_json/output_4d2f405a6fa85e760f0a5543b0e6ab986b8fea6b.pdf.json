This study aimed to develop a fast and stable ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of umbralisib in rat plasma and its application for evaluating the effect of sophocarpine on the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib. A direct protein preparation with acetonitrile was used to deal with rat plasma. Umbralisib and duvelisib (internal standard, IS) were isolated on aWaters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column with mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. The linear range was from 0.5 to 1,000 ng/ml. Both of the precision (RSD%) and accuracy (RE%) were less than 15% in a permissible range. The mean recovery and matrix effect of umbralisib were 86.3\u201396.2% and 97.8\u2013112.0%, respectively. When umbralisib was combinedwith sophocarpine, AUC0\u2192\u221e of umbralisib was significantly reduced to 2462.799 \u00b1 535.736 ng/ml\u2022h from 5416.665 \u00b1 1,451.846 ng/ml\u2022h, and Cmax also was markedly diminished. Moreover, CLz/F was increased more than two times. This developed, optimized and technical UPLC-MS/MS method was extremely suitable for detecting the concentrations of umbralisib in rat plasma after an oral administration, and sophocarpine significantly changed the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib in rats.

It brings not only an economic burden for the family, but also a big challenge for the healthcare system and society (Monga et al., 2019). Therefore, more effective and novel treatments for MZL and FL were needed and developed.\nEdited by: Olavi R.

Nowadays, umbralisib (Figure 1A) has become the first approved, oral and dual inhibitor of PI3K\u03b4 and CK1\u03b5 in the treatment for refractory or recurrent MZL and FL (Dhillon and Keam, 2021; Fowler et al., 2021). Following administration of a single dose of umbralisib in healthy subjects, the median time to reach peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of umbralisib is \u22484 h (TGTherapeutics, 2021. https://www.tgtherapeutics.com/. Accessed 23 Feb 2021). As seen from a previous study, umbralisib plasma concentrations in humans were found not to display any clinically significant differences in human demography (age, sex, race and body weight) and some clinical manifestations (mild hepatic/renal impairment) (FDA, 2021. Available: https://www.tgtherapeutics.com/prescribinginformation/uspi-ukon.pdf [Accessed 2021]). Interestingly, umbralisib is mainly metabolized by three isoforms of CYP450 enzymes in vitro, including CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2 (TG Therapeutics. UKONIQTM (umbralisib): United States prescribing information. 2021. https://www.tgtherapeutics. com/. Accessed 23 Feb 2021). Thus, we couldn\u2019t ignore its herb-drug interactions in combination with other drugs. Few studies of coadminstration with other drugs metabolized by these three CYP450 enzymes were reported due to its recent approval, so it is important to explore its potential herb-drug interactions with other drugs.\nAs reported, Compound kushen injection combination with other chemotherapies improved the efficiency and reduced the adverse effect rate in the treatment of lymphoma. In addition, Compound kushen injection is commonly used for reliefing cancer pain according to its package insert. A biologically active chemical alkaloid, sophocarpine, is separated from Compound kushen injection (Zhang et al., 2018). As reported before, sophocarpine might be a potential broad-spectrum\nanticancer agent (Zhang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021). What\u2019s more, sophocarpine also inhibited CYP3A4 noncompetitively and CYP2C9 competitively in human liver microsomes (Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, in this research, we decided to investigate the pharmacokinetic drug interactions between umbralisib and sophocarpine based on the possibility of co-administrations and interactions theoretically.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analytical method was developed for the measurement of umbralisib in biological fluids from pharmacokinetics and herb-drug interactions study. In this experiment, we tried to establish a novel, stable and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay in the application for quantitative analysis of the concentrations of umbralisib in rat plasma, and it was successfully applied in the investigation of the effect of sophocarpine on the pharmacokinetics of umbralisib in rats."

All samples were temporarily stored at an autosampler (10\u00b0C), and 2.0 \u00b5l of injection volume for each specimen was pushed into UPLCMS/MS system for further analysis. A gradient elution program composed of solvent A (acetonitrile) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in water) at a total flow rate of 0.40 ml/min was applied as follows: first, 10%A kept for half a minute; then, the proportion of A linearly increased to 90% in half a minute, maintained this proportion of A for 0.6 min; finally, the proportion of A linearly decreased to 10% in the next 0.1 min, and maintained for 0.3 min. Total consumption of time was 2.0 min. Time remaining was used for the equilibrium.\nA Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electro-spray ionization (ESI) source (Milford, MA, United States) was used to determine the concentrations of the target and IS. All quantitative analysis was based on a selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode and positive ion mode. Ion\ntransitions of umbralisib and IS were m/z 572.30 \u2192 246.10 and m/z 416.88 \u2192 281.88, respectively.\nThe flow rate of collision gas, cone gas and desolvation gas filled with high purity of nitrogen was 0.15 ml/min, 200 L/h and 1000 L/h, respectively. The optimized desolvation temperature reached 600\u00b0C. Collision energy of umbralisib and IS was separately 30 and 20 eV, and cone voltage was separately 15 and 20 V.

Firstly, 20 \u00b5l of IS working solution was added and mixed with five times volume of plasma specimens in an EP centrifuge tube (1.5 ml). Then, another addition of 300 \u00b5l acetonitrile was used as a protein precipitation solution to remove protein. Subsequently, sufficient vortexing (1 min) and centrifuging (13,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 10 min) were needed. Finally, a 100 \u00b5l aliquot of clear supernatant was transferred into autosampler vials for subsequent detection.\nMethod Validation In this study, we strictly and exactly adhered to the principles of FDA based on the validation of bioanalytical assay (Xu et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020). Generally, a complete methodology validation is selected to cover the calibration curve, selectivity, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), recovery, matrix effect, precision and accuracy, and stability.\nTo validate the selectivity of the method and check the absence of interferences at the nearby retention times of umbralisib and IS, we investigated and assessed three kinds of analytic samples, including blank rat plasma, standard solution (at the concentration of LLOQ) and plasma samples derived from rats with oral administration of umbralisib.\nSensitivity was systematically assessed by the value of LLOQ, which was identified as the lowest quantitative point and evaluated as 10 times of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Calibration curves were investigated in a weighted (1/x2) least square regression model. In this work, calibration curves represented the ratio of peak area of the analyte to peak area of IS against the nominal concentrations of the analyte.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 7490953\nSix replicates plasma specimens in each level were finally detected and applied in the estimation of precision, accuracy, recovery and matrix effect. The evaluation of precision and accuracy was performed using QC samples at four different concentrations including 0.5, 1, 80, 800 ng/ml in three continuous days. Recovery was recognized as the peak area of umbralisib before and after plasma preparation. Matrix effect was investigated by comparative study between the peak area of the spike-after-extraction samples and the corresponding results of the pure solution.\nStability (short-term and long-term) evaluation was examined respectively at ambient conditions temperature for 2 h and \u221280\u00b0C for 3 weeks. In addition, the stability after 4 h of preparation was tested in an autosampler at 10\u00b0C. Moreover, three complete freeze/thaw stability (\u221280\u00b0C to room temperature) was also studied. Stability of umbralisib with five replicates was studied at three different levels containing 1, 80 and 800 ng/ml."

The parent ion of umbralisib was m/z 572.30, and the corresponding ion of IS was 416.88. The most abundant fragment ion at m/z 246.10 and 281.88 separately belonged to umbralisib and IS, which were chosen as the product ions for the bioanalytical method.\nThe selection of mobile phase was an important procedure of bioanalytical method. Gradually, acetonitrile or methanol for the organic phase was investigated, and water with acetic acid, or formic acid or ammonium acetate for water phase was evaluated to acquire the satisfied sensitivity and symmetric peaks. In this investigation of the developed method, we finally used eight combinations to evaluate the sensitivity, including four kinds of water phase (water, 0.1% acetic acid solution, 0.1% formic acid solution and 1mM ammonium acetate solution) and two kinds of organic phase (acetonitrile and methanol). Finally, 0.1% formic acid solution as water phase and acetonitrile as mobile phase were adopted and acquired the best sensitivity and acceptable symmetric peaks.\nPlasma is filled with large amount of endogenous substances and protein is one kind of complicated matrix effect. Plasma specimens must be removed the interferences as much as possible before UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Compared with liquid-liquid extraction method, direct protein precipitation has the unique superiority with simpler\nprocess and less time consumption. One-step protein precipitation was the more effective method to reduce the endogenous interferences and to improve the recovery in plasma samples (Wei et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). In this study, we used acetonitrile to directly process rat plasma samples and got a good spectrum and an acceptable recovery.\nMethod Validation"

Figure 3 displayed the average plasma concentration-time curves of umbralisib or combination with\nsophocarpine in rats. As seen from the results of pharmacokinetic parameters, it was quickly absorbed that the time of maximum concentration (Tmax) was 3.667 \u00b1 0.516 h, which was similar with the reported result in human (Burris et al., 2018). And the corresponding maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) reached 283.803 \u00b1 84.714 ng/ml. We also could recognize umbralisib as a long-acting preparation with half-life (t1/2) reached 16.864 \u00b1 5.982 h.\nAfter combination with sophocarpine, significant alterations were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters. Among them, area under the curve for plasma concentration from zero to last measurable plasma sample time (AUC0-t) and the area under the curve for plasma concentration from zero to infinity (AUC0-\u221e) were separately significantly reduced to 2413.341 \u00b1 537.196 ng/ml\u2022h and 2462.799 \u00b1 535.736 ng/ml\u2022h, Cmax was dramatically reduced to 166.011 \u00b1 56.387 ng/ml, and Tmax was obviously reduced by nearly 1.0 h. It suggested that sophocarpine had significantly\nincreased the metabolism of umbralisib in rats. Therefore, the concurrent use of umbralisib with sophocarpine should be treated with extreme caution. If their combined use is unavoidable, our data suggested that dose increase should be taken. Otherwise, the patient might suffer from the failure of the treatment caused by decreased umbralisib plasma levels. However, it was reported that sophocarpine had the potential inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in vitro using human liver microsomes (Zhang et al., 2019),\nwhich was not consistent with our results in rats. The limitation of our research lies in the small number of rats used in the experiment. These results may aid in investigating the role of sophocarpine on umbralisib metabolism, and the potential of herb-drug interactions in humans in future studies should be done to evaluate the significance of this interaction."
