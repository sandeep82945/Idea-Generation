    "abstractText": "In this work, we developed an eco-friendly and facile microvia filling method by using printing and sintering of Cu-Ag core-shell nano-microparticles (Cu@Ag NMPs). Through a chemical reduction reaction in a modified silver ammonia solution with L-His complexing agent, Cu@Ag NMPs with compact and uniform Ag shells, excellent sphericity and oxidation resistance were synthesized. The as-synthesized Cu@Ag NMPs show superior microvia filling properties to Cu nanoparticles (NPs), Ag NPs, and Cu NMPs. By developing a dense refill method, the porosity of the sintered particles within the microvias was significantly reduced from ~30% to ~10%, and the electrical conductivity is increased about twenty-fold. Combing the Cu@Ag NMPs and the dense refill method, the microvias could obtain resistivities as low as 7.0 and 6.3 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm under the sintering temperatures of 220 \u25e6C and 260 \u25e6C, respectively. The material and method in this study possess great potentials in advanced electronic applications.",

            "text": "Microvia filling is an essential technology for the interconnection metallization of integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards (PCBs), and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as 3D electronic packaging [1\u20133]. The microvia filling technology enables the vertical electrical interconnections, and thus, improving the communication rate and reducing the volume and power consumption of electronic devices. To date, electroplating is still the predominant method for microvia filling. The electroplated microvias could obtain satisfactory electrical properties, however, this technique has several drawbacks: (1) The electroplating is a multi-step process composed by exposing, developing, etching, and plating procedures, which are complex and the by-products may cause environment pollution [4]. (2) For electroplated microvias with large depth/diameter ratio, it is difficult to achieve the \u201cbottom-up\u201d filling mode and voids will form inside the microvias [5]. As the current density is limited to maintaining stable plating, the efficiency of electroplated microvias with large diameter and depth is low [6]. With the rapid development of electronic industry, eco-friendly, fast and flexible microvia filling techniques are urgently needed and expected to be the substitute for traditional electroplating techniques. Selective printing and sintering of metallic NMPs might provide a possible approach for this issue [7,8]. Metallic (Cu, Ag, etc.,) particles are printed on a substrate and then sintered by a laser source or heat source. Via selective printing or laser sintering, the specifically designed patterns could be obtained. Due to the extremely high specific area\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1063. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12071063 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1063 2 of 13\nand surface energy, the required sintering temperature of metal nanoparticles is only 200\u2013300 \u25e6C [9], which enables the printing of electronic circuits on heat-sensitive substrates. In comparison with traditional electroplating technique, the selectively printing/sintering of metallic particles significantly reduces the processing period and the amount of toxic byproducts, and therefore, it is more efficient and eco-friendly. In recent years, the method has been extensively used in the investigations of printed electronic circuits with various conductive materials, line widths/spacings, upon diverse substrates, and in specific application scenarios [10\u201315]. The electrical conductivity of the as-sintered metallic particles could reach the order of 10 \u00b5\u2126\u00b7cm [16]. Nevertheless, the studies on microvia filling via selective printing and sintering of metallic particles are still far from enough [3,17]. Cho et al. attempted to fill blind vias with 100 \u00b5m in diameter by silver nanoparticle ink [18], Khorramdel et al. tried to fill microvias in silicon substrates by silver nanoparticle ink [3]. However, the resistivity of the filled microvias is 2\u20134 orders of magnitude higher than that of bulk copper, which is undesirable in electronic applications. Due to the porous structure of the sintered metallic particles, the conductivity of as-sintered metal nanoparticles is lower than that of the bulk metals. For the case of microvia filling, it is difficult to compactly fill metallic particles into the microvias and apply pressure to the metallic particles during sintering. Due to the solidification shrinkage of the particles, considerable pores will form inside the microvias, further deteriorating the electrical/mechanical properties and reliability [19]. Finding a path to improve the compactness and sintering performance of microvia filling with metallic particles is critical to their widespread application. In this study, we try to improve the microvia filling performance of metallic particles from the perspective of material design and filling method. In terms of filling materials, Cu and Ag particles are widely used in the previous studies of conductive inks, interconnect materials, and printed electronics [15,20,21]. However, Cu particles are easily oxidized in air, and Ag particles are prone to electromigration, which severely limit their applications [22]. Here we propose a chemical reduction method to synthesize Cu@Ag NMPs as microvia fillers. The as-synthesized Cu@Ag NMPs can achieve the combined properties of oxidation and electromigration resistance. The Cu@Ag NMPs are in a wide size range from 0.2~1.4 \u00b5m, which can reach higher packing density than uniform-sized particles. To further improve the filling compactness, the Cu@Ag NMPs are mixed with volatile, low-viscosity, and decomposable ethylene glycol solvent to prepare a paste with a reactively high solid content (80 wt.%). Compared with other metal particle conductive inks with relatively low solid content (40~50 wt.% [23]), and metal particle conductive adhesives with undecomposable organic additives such as film-forming agents and cross-linking agents [24], the Cu@Ag particle paste is able to reach better sinterability and conductivity. In terms of filling method, previous studies have tried screen printing [25\u201327], squeegee printing [28], and inkjet printing [7]. However, the filling performance of these methods are unsatisfactory, as the evaporation of solvents will lead to shrinkage cavities in the structure. Here we develop a dense filling method for microvias. Through drying and refilling the microvias, a better filling compactness can be obtained. With the combined improvements in material and filling method, a promising microvia filling performance can be achieved."

The Cu@Ag NMP pastes were filled into the microvias through a dense refill process as shown in Figure 1. Here, we describe all steps of the process in detail: (1) th Cu@Ag NMP pastes were printed on the top of the microvias by a nozzle (Figure 1b). (2) The samples were kept in vacuum chamber for 3 min, during which the air inside of microvias will escape and the pastes will permeate into the microvias due to the capillary phenomenon (Figure 1c). (3) Upper surface was roll pressed to further squeeze the paste into the microvias (Figur 1d). (4) The Cu@Ag NMP aste was reprinted o top f the microvias (Figure 1e) and the sample was dried in 80 \u00b0C air gas flow for 3 min (Figure 1f), and a part of the ethylene glycol solution in the paste evaporated. (5) The samples were roll pressed again to further squeeze the paste into the microvias (Figure 1g). Finally, the samples were sintered in 5%H2 + 95%Ar atmosphere by a hot-pressing furnace (Figure 1h). The pressure was 2 MPa and the sin e ing temperatures were 220 \u00b0C. Figure 2 shows a typical temperature curve during the sintering process.\nFigure 1. Procedures of the microvia filling process.

[40] filled TSVs with silver NPs paste under the sintering temperature of 220 \u25e6C, and the resistivity of the filled vias is relatively high (400 \u00b5\u2126\u00b7cm). With increasing sintering temperature, the sintering properties of metal particles can be significantly improved [41]. Quack et al. [42] filled TSVs with Ag NPs under the sintering temperature of 250 \u25e6C, and the resistivity is less than 200 \u00b5\u2126\u00b7cm.

The capillary phenomenon results in complete filling of the wet paste into the microvia. By contrast, dry particles can hardly completely fill the microvia, as the particles adhere to the sidewall of the microvias owing to the high surface tension and internal friction of the particles. Although wet paste fills the microvia better, the space occupied by the solution in the paste increases the gaps between the particles, and then forms pores after sintering. Therefore, after the wet filling process, the samples are re-dried (Figure 1f), during which a part of the ethylene glycol solution in the paste evaporates. Then the samples are roll pressed to squeeze the paste into the microvias and compensate the voids (Figure 1g). By this dry-refilling process, the compactness and sintering performance of the microvia can be significantly improved."

            "text": "In summary, we proposed an eco-friendly and facile microvia filling method through printing and sintering of Cu@Ag NMPs. Cu@Ag NMPs with compact and uniform Ag shells, good sphericity and promising oxidation resistance were obtained. The assynthesized Cu@Ag NMPs show optimal microvia filling property. Using a dense refill method, the compactness of the particles in the microvias is significantly improved and the resistivity is reduced by approximately ~95%. With the combination of the Cu@Ag NMPs and the dense refill method, the filled microvias could obtain resistivities as low as 7.0 and 6.3 \u00b5\u2126\u00b7cm under sintering temperatures of 220 \u25e6C and 260 \u25e6C, respectively. The property is comparable to that of the electroplated microvias, and much low than that of microvias filling with metallic particles in previous reports. The Cu@Ag NMPs and dense refill method in this study possess great potentials in future advanced electronic applications.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1063 11 of 13\nAuthor Contributions: G.Y.: conceptualization, methodology, investigation, visualization, formal analysis, writing\u2014original draft, writing\u2014review and editing.
