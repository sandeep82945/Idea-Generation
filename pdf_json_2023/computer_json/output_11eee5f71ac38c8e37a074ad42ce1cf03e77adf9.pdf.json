    "abstractText": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are getting more popular in the field of automobiles due to environmental factors and others. Since electric vehicles manage their power from the rechargeable battery so it\u2019s essential to have a reliable, efficient, and economical battery charger that can provide stable required output for the specified EV\u2019s battery. In this paper, a DC-DC converter with a modified PI controller has been presented which helps to achieve the required output voltage and high current density with negligible overshoot for the specified lithium-ion battery system to minimize the charging time. Apart from minimizing the power loss of the active switches, the proposed system minimizes the junction temperature which eventually improves the life cycle of the converter. The analysis of the proposed converter is performed both in ideal and non-ideal conditions. The power loss of the active switches and the junction temperature have also been analyzed. An economical and effective dc and ac side inductor has been designed and perform the total power loss and the temperature rise. The analysis results show that the proposed converter can maintain a power factor of more than 90% and a total harmonic distortion of less than 0.46%, which is ideal for the high-density load current. The reliability of the dc-dc converter is also evaluated. A hardware prototype has also been implemented to confirm its viability for EV battery charging applications.

INTRODUCTION In electric vehicles (EVs) the rechargeable battery is one of the important and sophisticated systems which deliver power to run the EVs. So, it is important to have an efficient, reliable, and economical battery charger for EVs. An AC-DC converter is needed to full fill the requirement [1-5].\nAn AC-DC converter can be isolated or non-isolated. In the non-isolated system, the diode and active switch do face more stress which conveys more power loss will take place, consequently, the temperature will be higher, and since isolation is not present it might be an issue in terms of safety. Whereas in an isolated system the diode and active switch might face less stress since the voltage can be lowered to maintain the requirement which states that the power loss will be lower, and the temperature will be lower in the junction of these devices besides the safety factor will be higher since its isolated. Consequently, improve the reliability of the overall system [6].\nTo perform the AC-DC operation the conventional diode rectifier might be used which leads to more power loss consequently the power factor as well as THD degrades. To maintain the PFC tropology might be used which is complicated and costly [7-18]. To get rid of it a low-frequency coupled inductor-based AC-DC converter has been used which is associated with a LCL filter and two diodes [19-22]. Afterward, the voltage might need to regulate according to the condition of the lithium-ion battery. To full fill this task, a close-loop DC-DC converter can be used. The conventional close-loop DC-DC converter does face high power loss in the active switches which might decay the life cycle of the overall system. The most power loss occurs in conventional closeloop DC-DC converters due to conduction, switching, and leakage power loss [23]. Besides, the overshoot does present at the output voltage and current which might be ailing the lithium-ion battery [24].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nTo conquer a modified proportional integral (MPI) controller be bought from our previous work and again modified which helps to reduce not only the overshoot at the output voltage and current but also to reduce the conduction power loss, switching power loss, and leakage power loss [25-26]. Besides, the current prosecution has also been improved. This implies total power loss will be reduced without sacrificing the switching frequency that helps to maintain the size of passive components.\nWith the active switch, the thermal management heatsink has been addressed which helps to maintain the junction temperature by increasing the surface area that is associated with ambient [27-28].\nThis paper presents a reliable, efficient, and economical AC-DC converter for Electric Vehicles\u2019 lithium-ion battery charging. A detailed analysis of the converter as well as the power loss and junction temperature of the MOSFET also be analyzed with three different conditions. At the end, the consequence of the hardware prototype also is presented to validate the proposed prosecution.\nII. ROPOSED SYSTEM The proposed system has depicted in Figure 1. The singlephase ac source delivers power to the load. Adjacent to the ac source the LCL network has been assigned for filtering purposes. It also helps to manipulate the power factor and THD. The two diodes D5 and D6 help to manipulate the ac flow to the primary side of the coupled inductor. From the secondary side of the coupled inductor, the rippled dc has been obtained. The RC3, RC4, C3, and C4 help to reduce the dc ripples. Afterward, the four MOSFETs M1, M2, M3, and M4 help to manipulate the dc voltage based on the consequence of the load and the closed loop controller. The other diodes D1, D2, D3, and D4 help to maintain the dc flow. Components like L1, L2, and C1 are responsible for storing and filtering purposes. The two fuses F1 and F2 are assigned for protection. Eventually, the Lithium-Ion battery (48V 100Ah) has been used as a load.\nIII. AC-DC SYSTEM WITH LCL FILTER Single phase ac does change the phase so this system will have two different modes and discussed hereunder.\nA. MODE ONE At 0\u00b0-180\u00b0 supply voltage, this mode would take place and L3, L4, D5, and L5 are in conduction mode whereas D6 is in nonconduction mode consequently generating positive voltage at L7 and depicted in Figure 2(a).\nB.

The modified desired output voltage is then compared with the actual output voltage and the resultant goes to the first PI block which is associated with the desired output current. The output of the first PI is then inverted and compared with the actual output current, and the resultant goes to the second PI block. The consequence of the second PI block goes to PWM Modulator. The PI tuning for both the first and second blocks has been done by utilizing Zeigler-Nichols Method. The PWM Generator block generates required pulses at a given frequency based on the consequence of the second PI and the Sawtooth block. Afterward, the generated pulse goes to the logic block which controls the MOSFETs. For the first conduction period, MOSFETs one and two conduct while three and four do not conduct. And for the second conduction period, MOSFETs three and four conduct while one and two do not conduct. In the non-conduction period, all MOSFETs stays in non-conduction mode as explained in the previous section.

PROPOSED SYSTEM RESULTS ANALYSIS The important parameters of the proposed system have been summarized in Table l.\nA comparison between the conventional PI and the proposed control system has been done and depicted in Figure 11. The graph implies that the proposed control system takes 96.98% less time to reach the steady state than the conventional PI after 1st PI controller in terms of the current control processing which makes the proposed control system computing faster. It is to be noted that the controller response shown in Fig.11 is the consequence of the 1st PI current control prosecution. This is not the direct battery response. The battery voltage, SOC, and current are shown in Fig.12 where currents settling time is 0.21 second. Here MATLAB\u2019s lithium-ion battery model is used for simulation.\nThe proposed system with the prosecution has been created in MATLAB Simulink and shown in Figure 9 to charge the lithium-ion battery from a single-phase ac grid. The results have been obtained from the simulation and depicted in Figures 12 to 14. The results show that the proposed system with the proposed prosecution successfully maintained the constant required battery voltage and current with negligible overshoot while charging the lithium-ion battery. The charging current was achieved up to around 152.1A. The battery voltage was maintained at around 53.3V, and the SOC increased from 60% to 60.04% within around 1 second which convey to charge to 100% the charger would require around 17 minutes which satisfied the twolevel fast charging characteristics and shown in Figure 12. Besides, while charging, the grid voltage and current were almost in phase and the power factor was found to be more than 0.90, and the THD was found to be 0.46% as depicted in Figures 13 and 14 respectively.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

            "text": "To predict the converter\u2019s reliability and effectiveness in terms of the proposed prosecution, the power loss of MOSFETs must be computed in non-ideal conditions. The control signal of each MOSFET and the consequence in terms of voltage and current of each MOSFET has shown in Figure 15. Where M1, M2, M3, and M4 are the control pulses and the M1p, M2p, M3p and M4p implicate the voltage and current phenomena indicated with blue and red consistently.\nFigure 15. Shows that the response of MOSFETs in terms of control pulse is not instantaneous and results in power losses [29].\nFor MOSFETs 1 and 2 from t4 to t9 the MOSFETs are in non-conduction mode and some current is flowing and the voltage is attenuated in between t6 to t7 since the adjacent MOSFETs 3 and 4 conducts in that time and the leakage power loss is minimized and the process repeats.\nFor MOSFETs 3 and 4 from t5 to t8 the MOSFETs are in conduction mode and the remaining times are in nonconduction mode and the voltage generated across these two MOSFETs are attenuated at t2-t3 and t10-t11 since the MOSFETs 1 and 2 conducts and as a result the leakage power loss minimized. Figure 15 also implies that while the MOSFETs are operating the frequency and the duty cycle of each MOSFET are divided into half of the control signal which has been generated from the close loop proposed control system consequently the conduction, switching and leakage power loss is minimized of each MOSFET.\nThe total power loss of each MOSFET can be computed from equation 57.\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d = \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf + \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 + \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b + \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b + \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd3 + \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 (57) where \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d = Total power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf = Turn on delay time power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 = Rise time power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = On time power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = Turn off delay time power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd3 = Fall time power loss \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 = Leakage power loss And can be computed using the following equation.\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf = \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c (58)\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 = \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc06 \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\n\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 (59)\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \u00d7 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c (60)\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \u00d7 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c (61)\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd3 = \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\n\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 (62)\n\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 = \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \u00d7 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12 \u00d7 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f \u00d7 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c (63)\nAfter manipulating equations 57 to 63 with parameters from Table l in MATLAB simulation in the non-ideal condition the power losses of MOSFETs have been computed and depicted in Figures 16 to 19. These graphs implicate that the MOSFETs do face spike power loss at the very beginning of the prosecution. The four MOSFETs\u2019 power loss patterns are almost identical. Each MOSFET generates a total power loss of 6.103W while charging the lithium-ion battery with 152.1A charging current.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Instead of the MOSFET control logic, all the other parameters with close loop controller were identical in both cases.\nThe result shows that the proposed converter does face less power losses whereas the reference converter does face significant power losses on each high-side MOSFET. The total each high-side MOSFET power loss for the proposed system is about 6.103W whereas the reference high-side MOSFET\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\ndoes dissipate almost about 37.13W while charging the lithium-ion battery with 152.1A. Which would increase the junction temperature of each MOSFET and decay the life cycle of the MOSFETs as well as the overall system.\nFigure 21 shows that instead of the leakage power loss all other power losses have been reduced. Since in the proposed converter each high-side MOSFET spends a longer time in non-conduction mode compared to the reference that\u2019s why the leakage power loss is higher. However, the total power loss of the proposed converter in terms of each high-side MOSFET has been reduced to 83.6%.\nIX. THERMAL ANALYSIS OF MOSFETS Based on the thermal conduction method the MOSFETs junction temperature has been analyzed. The geometrical thermal connection between the junction of the MOSFET and the heat sink has been expressed in equation 64.\n\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc23 = \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95 \u00d7 \ufffd\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b + \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b + \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2c + \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc23\ud835\udec9\ud835\udec9\ufffd + \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b (64) where Tj = MOSFET junction temperature Pt = MOSFET total power loss R\u03b8ja = Junction to Air thermal conduction resistance R\u03b8sa= Heat sink to Air thermal conduction resistance R\u03b8cs = Case to Heat sink thermal conduction resistance R\u03b8jc= Junction to Case thermal conduction resistance Ta = Ambient temperature\nThree different modes concerned with the MOSFETs junction temperature have been analyzed. MOSFET without an external heatsink and with natural cooling (t j1). MOSFET with external heatsink and with natural cooling (t j2). MOSFET with external heatsink and with forced cooling (t j3). For the external heatsink, the RA-T2X-64E has been chosen to perform the analysis. Besides in terms of forced cooling 500 (ft/min), airflow has been chosen at ambient temperature and assumed to be constant. Besides mica has been considered in\nbetween the external heatsink and MOSFET for better connection and isolation.\nAfter manipulating equations 57 to 64 the MOSFET junction temperature has been computed in three different modes by considering non-ideal conditions and depicted in Figures 22 to 25. These Figures imply that the temperature that is generated at the junction of each MOSFET is almost identical. Without an external heatsink and with natural cooling (t j1) each MOSFET generates around 271\u00b0C in the junction of the MOSFETs and a huge spike of around 1500\u00b0C takes place at the initial state. At the external heatsink and with natural cooling (t j2), each MOSFET generates around 60.055\u00b0C with an inrush temperature spike of around 250\u00b0C. After adding a cooling fan with an external heatsink (t j3), the temperature even dropped to around 33.61\u00b0C with an inrush temperature spike of 80\u00b0C. The consequence shows that in the t j1 and t j2 phenomenon, there is an inrush temperature spike present which exceeds the limitation of the selected MOSFETs maximum junction temperature limit. The consequence time is low and will not degrade the MOSFET\u2019s performance immediately but keep doing it over time might degrade the reliability of the MOSFETs, so it\u2019s wise to use t j3, which inrush temperature spike is in the limitation of the selected MOSFETs maximum junction temperature limit besides this phenomenon would improve the reliability of the MOSFETs as well as the overall system.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The wrong manipulation of an inductor would increase the total power loss, temperature, and saturation limit. Indeed, a parapet exists in size, efficiency, operating frequency, cost, and the material used in the core.

For each DC inductor L1 and L2, three parallel U93-76-16 ferrite core with #AWG 2 wire has been selected with 28 turns. And for AC inductors, both inductors L3 and L4 share the same core and three parallel 240UI silicon core with #AWG 0000 wire has been selected with 69 turns. To analyze the inductors all the required data has been taken from the simulation while supplying 152.1A load current and from the datasheets by considering non-ideal conditions. Afterward, the saturation, power loss, and temperature consequence of the designed inductors of the proposed prosecution have been computed and depicted in Figures 26 to 29.\nFigures 26 and 27 implicate the saturation consequence of the designed DC and AC inductors while supplying 152.1A charging current. In Figure 26, each high frequency designed DC inductor L1 and L2 exhibits a DC flux density of 0.39866 Tesla at 75.54644 oersted marked with blue color, and the peak flux density is 0.478 Tesla at 89.45572 oersted marked with purple color. Eventually, the peak flux density is underneath the saturation point of 0.5 Tesla at 94.425 oersted marked with red color.\nIn Figure 27, designed associated AC inductors L3 and L4 exhibit an AC flux density of 1.41 tesla at a grid voltage of 230v marked with blue color which is underneath the saturation point of 1.8 tesla at a grid voltage of 295v marked with red color.\nFigures 28 and 29 implicate that the power loss and temperature rise consequence of the designed DC and AC inductors.\nIn Figure 28, each DC inductor L1 and L2 exhibit 3.1536W of core power loss (Pfe) and 24.56W of copper power loss (Pcu) eventually a total power loss (\u03a3P) of 27.7136W. Consequently, the temperature (Tr) generated from each DC inductor is around 22.3872\u00b0C at natural cooling.\nFigure 29, states that associated AC inductors L3 and L4 exhibit 40W of core power loss (Pfe) and 169W of copper power loss (Pcu) eventually a total power loss (\u03a3P) of 209W. Consequently, the temperature generated (Tr) from AC inductors is around 38\u00b0C at natural cooling.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED DC-DC CONVERTER\nIn this section, the reliability of the proposed DC-DC converter with the modified proposed controller will be investigated. Afterward, the reliability comparison will be summarized between the proposed DC-DC converter and the reference DC-DC converter\u2019s topology. All the specification remains the same as explained in the previous sections.\nFrom the previous sections, it was found that each MOSFET will generate around 33.61\u00b0C junction temperature when a cooling fan with an external heatsink is added and each DC inductor will generate around 22.3872\u00b0C temperature at natural cooling. Eventually, for the sake of the overall system reliability analysis, a worst-case junction temperature of 105\u00b0C has been selected.\nTo analyze the failure rate the constitution of the part stress method has been utilized. Afterward, the required data has been collected from the military handbook, MIL-HDBK217F(N1/2) [32].\nEach component failure rate is associated with several factors and noted hereunder.\n\ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11 = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 (89) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 (90) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01 (91) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c = (\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13 + \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04)\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b (92) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00 = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 (93) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00 (94) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc12 = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc10\ud835\udc10\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 (95) \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc05 = \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1b\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 (96)\n\ud835\uded1\ud835\uded1\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13 = \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15 \u2212 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc24 \ufffd \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc09\ud835\udc09+\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \u2212 \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd6\ud835\udfd6\ufffd (97) where\n\ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11 = Resistor Failure Rate \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b = Inductor Failure Rate \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c = MOSFET Failure Rate \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0c = Microcontroller unit Failure Rate \ud835\udecc\ud835\udecc\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00 = Capacitor Failure Rate\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

(99)\nAfter manipulating the above equations, the overall proposed DC-DC system reliability has been computed and depicted in Figure 37 with the comparison of the reference [30].\nFor the proposed system the overall system reliability in terms of short (Ps) and open (Poc) circuit failure is marked with red solid and green solid lines whereas the reference system\u2019s overall reliability in terms of short (Rs) and open (Roc) circuit failure is marked with red dashed and green dashed lines.\nFrom the plot, it is clear that the proposed DC-DC converter with the proposed prosecution has higher reliability than the reference DC-DC converter topology in terms of both sort and open circuit failure. Eventually, the proposed DC-DC converter will perform much higher reliability than the computed reliability. Because in operation mode the component\u2019s junction temperature was lower than the worstcase temperature discussed in the previous sections.\nXII. STATE-SPACE ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED DCDC SYSTEM\nAfter manipulating section V, the state-space model of the proposed DC-DC converter with proposed prosecution in the open-loop condition is represented in A, B, C, and D matrices.\n\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc31 \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d = \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc31 + \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 100\n\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc04 = \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc31 + \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 101\nwhere at 0 < t < Ts would be.\n\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc31 = \ufffd \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ufffd \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc27 = \u23a3 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a2 \u23a1 \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03 \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b\u23a6 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a4\n102\n\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc00 = \ufffd A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 \ufffd 103\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01 = \ufffd \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd4\ud835\udfd4 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd6\ud835\udfd6 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd3 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd3\ud835\udfd3 \ufffd 104\nC= [\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce \ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce \ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfcf] D = [\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfce]\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

            "text": "This paper proposes a modified PI-controller-based DC-DC converter for EV charging applications. The steady-state analysis of the proposed converter both in ideal and non-ideal conditions shows the relation among input voltage, output voltage, and the prosecution. The power loss and thermal analysis of the MOSFET manifest that the proposed prosecution has the ability to reduce the total power loss of the MOSFETs as well as temperature. For effective and economical operation, the DC and AC side inductors have been designed properly and the results state that the designed inductors stay underneath the saturation region, and the temperature rise is at an acceptable range. With the proposed converter and prosecution, the system can charge the lithium-ion battery with 152.1A while maintaining the overshoot and other factors. Besides, the power factor and the THD were achieved at 0.90 and 0.46% respectively. The frequency response of the dc-dc converter confirms the stability of the system both in ideal and non-ideal conditions. The analysis of the MOSFETs power loss and temperature profile confirms that the proposed system will be more reliable and operational than the conventional system.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.
