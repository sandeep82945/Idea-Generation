    "abstractText": "(1) Background: Hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) is a limiting factor in the ability of molecules to pass through cell membranes and to perform their function. The ability to efficiently access cytosol is especially important when a synthetic compound has the potential to become a drug substance. D-Phe-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (BIM-23052) is a linear analog of somatostatin with established in vitro GH-inhibitory activity in nanomolar (nm) concentrations and high affinity to different somatostatin receptors. (2) Methods: Series of analogs of BIM-23052 were synthesized where Phe residue(s) in the BIM-23052 molecule were replaced with Tyr using standard SPPS, Fmoc/t-Bu strategy. Analyses of target compounds were performed using HPLC/MS technique. Toxicity and antiproliferative activity were studied using in vitro NRU and MTT assays. The values of logP (partition coefficient in octanol/water) for BIM-23052 and its analogs were calculated. (3) Results: The obtained data show the best antiproliferative effect against studied cancer cells for compound D-Phe-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (DD8), the most lipophilic compound according to the predicted logP values. (4) Conclusions: Multiple analyses of the obtained data reveal that compound D-Phe-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (DD8) where one Phe is replaced by Tyr has the best combination of cytotoxicity, antiproliferative effect and hydrolytic stability.",

            "text": "Somatostatin (SST) is a cyclic tetradecapeptide that exerts diverse activities, including strong regulatory effects throughout the body. Binding specific G-protein-bounded somatostatin receptors SST inhibits secretion of many hormones as well as tumor cell growth [1]. SST is a naturally occurring hormone secreted mainly in the nervous and digestive systems. It handles the normal release of hormones but is unable to cope with neuroendocrine cancer syndromes. The properties of SST are carried out via a family of five G protein-coupled receptors named SSTR 1 to 5 [2\u20136]. The latter are differently distributed not only in many places in the human body but also in some tumor cells. It was found that these receptors are overexpressed on the surface of many tumor cells, mostly those that arise in the lung, brain, digestive pancreatic tract, prostate, lymphatic system, etc. [7\u201313]. The most common SST analog drugs used are Lanreotide and Octreotide; they are clinically used in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1123. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15041123 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1123 2 of 14\ncell tumors). These medicines bind to the SST receptors and help them to both decrease hormone secretion and growth. D-Phe-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (BIM-23052), a linear analog of SST, has established vitro GH-inhibitory activity at low concentrations (nm range) and high affinity to several SST receptors (SSTRs) [14]. Many studies on this structure have revealed different structure\u2013activity relationships. Studying SST-14, Viber et al. revealed that the tetrapeptide sequence Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr from the somatostatin molecule is responsible for specific \u03b2folding and plays a key role in SST activity [15]. Further studies show that Trp and Lys are required for activity, while Phe and Thr can be replaced by Tyr, Ser, or Val. Addition of D-Phe at the N-terminus and L-Thr at the C-terminus and substitution of L-Trp with a D-form at position 8 all reduce the degradation of the resulting analogs [16]. Based on these modifications, several somatostatin analogs, Octreotide, Vapreotide, Lanreotide, and Seglitide, have been created and have been found to have wide application in medical practice [17\u201320]. In addition, Staykova et al. in several studies replaced some natural amino acids from the BIM-23052 structure with unnatural amino acids and found that some modifications exert a positive effect on the antiproliferative properties of newly synthesized peptides [21\u201323]. Searching for new structured analogs of SST with better pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics has continued in present years [24,25]. Our previous investigations showed that incorporation of \u03b1,\u03b1-dialkylated amino acids significantly affected the in vitro antitumor activity of the modified BIM-23052 analogs [26]. Additionally, several new analogs of BIM-23052 containing halogenated Phe were synthesized and studied by our group. This investigation revealed that the analog with one Phe(4-F) residue in the primary structure has good antiproliferative activity combined with acceptable cytotoxicity [27]. Tyrosine (Tyr) is a structural analog of phenylalanine (Phe), containing an additional OH group in the structure (Figure 1).\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1123 2 of 15\nneuroendocrine tumors (islet cell tumors).

            "heading": "4.2. Cytotoxicity, Docking Calculations, Antiproliferative Effect and Lipophilicity",
            "text": "Cytotoxicity studies have shown that the tested peptides do not show a cytotoxic effect at concentrations less than 250 \u00b5M. The cytotoxicity of BIM-23052 is similar to that of cisplatin (IC50 = 483.10 and 537.35 \u00b5m). The BIM-23052 analogs containing Tyr instead of Phe have significantly lower toxicity. For analogs D11, D6, D61, D9 and D101, the IC50 values significantly exceed 1000 \u00b5m, which is an indicator of a high level of safety. The most active compound DD8 has cytotoxicity equal to this of the parent compound BIM-23052. The logP values for this analog where only one Phe is substituted with Tyr show that the compound is lipophilic. Thus, compound DD8 could penetrate the cell membrane better than the other tested analogs, which means that additional mechanisms of action as anticancer agents are also possible for this peptide. In addition, the realized experiments revealed that subsequent substitution of Phe with Tyr residues does not lead to better antiproliferative activity. An exception is revealed for analog D6 with three Tyr (H-L-Tyr1-Tyr2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2). In this case, the N-terminal Tyr residue has a L-configuration. At the same time, docking calculations show weak selectivity of this analog according to the SSTRs, similar to the parent compound BIM-23052 and in contrast to DD8, where high selectivity is revealed by docking calculations according to SSTR1. However, the newly synthesized peptides do not show any selectivity for the tumor cell lines used in the experiments. Weak selectivity for the MCF-7 cell line (luminal-A type model, hormone-dependent breast cancer) commensurate with this of the parent molecule BIM-23052, and standard Cisplatin was observed only for compound D61, in which three Phe were replaced by Tyr. The calculated logP values indicate that this compound is less lipophilic than BIM-23052 and would have more difficulty penetrating the cell membrane to induce apoptosis by entering the cell. Tyrosine is expected to have a lower logP value than phenylalanine because it contains an additional hydroxyl group that contributes to its solubility in water. This is evident from numerous studies of the amino acid logP found in the literature [38\u201340]. However, when Tyr is incorporated in the primary structure of peptide molecules instead of Phe, the obtained results do not exactly match with this conclusion. The obtained results reveal that the addition of tyrosine residues decreases the lipophilicity by about 0.3 for each residue in the non-optimized structures, but the optimized single substitution analogs H-D-Phe-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Tyr7-Thr-NH2 (DD8) and H-D-Tyr1-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1123 11 of 14\nThr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (D11) are actually more lipophilic than the parent structure BIM-23052. The obtained data for the cytotoxicity of DD8 (IC50 = 482.93 \u00b1 33.88 \u00b5m) also match with the results from in silico calculations, and they show that this analog is the most cytotoxic one, which means that it influences the cell membrane not only specific to SSTR. However, the displacement of the Tyr residue closer to the N-terminus in D11 leads to a decrease in cytotoxicity, which clearly shows that the placement of the substituted residue plays a significant role in the penetration of the cell membrane. At the same time, analog D11 has the lowest activity between all other Tyr-containing compounds, which means that the D-Phe in the N-terminus is also key for bonding to the SSTR receptors. Peptide H-DPhe-Tyr2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (D101), where two tyrosines are added next to the N-terminus of the peptide, has similar logP to BIM-23052 but a several-times lower antiproliferative effect on all tested cancer cell lines. This result reveals that Phe residues assure better selectivity to SSTRs, but this substitution does not provide an additional option for action of the peptides through membrane penetration. All optimized structures show a lipophilic nature, while the non-optimized structures vary from slightly hydrophilic (D61, D9, D91 and D6) to slightly lipophilic (BIM-23052, DD8, D101, D7, D11). It can be assumed that this series of compounds affects cancer cells only by interaction with SSTS and not through cell penetration mechanisms. Finally, these results lead to the conclusion that the hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of the molecule also depend on the secondary structure of the molecule. The effect of L-Tyr at the N-terminus can be measured when comparing both compounds H-L-Tyr1-Tyr2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Tyr7-Thr-NH2 (D9) and H-D-Tyr1-Tyr2-Tyr3-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Tyr7-Thr-NH2 (D91), as the configuration of the amino acid in the first position is the only difference between these two analogs. While the non-optimized logP calculation yields the same result for both, after optimization, L-Tyr seems to increase the lipophilicity of the whole peptide. This is not to say that L- amino acids are more lipophilic in general, as it might be dependent on the neighboring residues as well. What should be noted though is the U-shape that the L-analogs take after optimization, which is visibly different from the straighter D-analog structures. The effect of tyrosine positioning can be studied when comparing structures of H-LTyr1-Tyr2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (D6) and H-L-Tyr1-Tyr2-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-ThrTyr7-Thr-NH2 (D7), where three phenylalanine residues have been replaced by tyrosine at different positions. Although they differ in non-optimized structures, when optimized, they curl up into similar shapes and experience the same logP coefficient. Optimizing all structures results in higher logP values, which means that their hydrophobic parts are more exposed. Overall, the addition of multiple polar residues diminishes the BIM-23052 drug properties, but the addition of a single tyrosine has a desirable result of increased lipophilicity and hence higher membrane permeability. Finally, docking calculations show that substitution of one Phe with Tyr at position 1 of the DD8 molecule leads to a change in selectivity according to the SSTRs. While the parent compound BIM-23052 demonstrates weak selectivity toward SSTR and bound SSTRs 3, 4 and 5 equally well, the newly synthesized analog DD8 has a narrow selectivity toward SSTR 1 (total energy of the complex is significantly higher than those of the complexes with other receptors)."

Herein, we have investigated the structure\u2013property relationship for a series of BIM-23052 analogs that have undergone structural modifications, and we identified those changes that lead to increased biological activity. The simple strategy used to produce BIM-23052 analogs was to replace Phe residue(s) with Tyr. Multiple analyses of the obtained data reveal that compound DD8 (D-Phe-Phe-Phe-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Tyr7-Thr-NH2), where one Phe is replaced by Tyr, has the best activity against the studied tumor cell lines. The logP values obtained from the in silico calculations show that DD8 is more lipophilic than BIM-23052 and thus is expected to have higher membrane permeability. At the same time, this analog has a narrow selectivity toward SSTR 1. Taking into account that somatostatin analogs bind specific receptors on the surface of tumor cell lines, the obtained data herein show that between all newly synthesized Tyr analogs of BIM23052, compound DD8 is the best candidate as an anticancer agent for oral administration, which could penetrate the cell membrane and start a different mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis than that characteristic for SST and its analogs. The additional substitution of Phe with Tyr residues does not lead to a better antiproliferative effect, i.e., there is no cumulative effect. However, replacement of the D-amino acid (compound D91) with L-one in the first position (compound D9) seems to slightly increase the lipophilicity of the peptide but does not increase the activity, which indicates that the binding to the SSTRs is the preferable mechanism of action of BIM-23052 Tyr analogs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.D., E.N., I.I. and S.A.; synthesis of target peptides, D.B., E.N. and D.D.; mathematical calculations of LogP values, S.D. and S.A.; docking calculations, T.D.; biological activity studies, I.I. and E.I.; hydrolytic stability study, S.P.; manuscript preparation and corrections D.D., E.N., I.I., S.D. and S.A.; funding acquisition, D.D., E.N. and I.I.
