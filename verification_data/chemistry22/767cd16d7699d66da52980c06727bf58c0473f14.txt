The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"Future work will aim to validate the chemoinformatics analyses described in this contribution using an experimental approach that includes the quantification of the binding affinity of small-sized inhibitors for Mps1 kinase using biophysical methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and/or microscale thermophoresis (MST), to name a few, as well as cytotoxic, clonogenic, and functional assays of Mps1 kinase activity inhibition to establish the relative potency of the compounds."
