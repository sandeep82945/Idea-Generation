    "abstractText": "Aphanomyces invadans is an aquatic oomycete pathogen and the causative agent of epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) in fresh and brackish water fish, which is responsible for severe mortalities and economic losses in aquaculture. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop anti-infective strategies to control EUS. An Oomycetes, a fungus-like eukaryotic microorganism, and a susceptible species, i.e., Heteropneustes fossilis, are used to establish whether an Eclipta alba leaf extract is effective against the EUS-causing A. invadans. We found that treatment with methanolic leaf extract, at concentrations between 50\u2013100 ppm (T4\u2013T6), protects the H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection. These optimum concentrations induced anti-stress and antioxidative response in fish, marked by a significant decrease in cortisol and elevated levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) levels in treated animals, as compared with the controls. We further demonstrated that the A. invadans-protective effect of methanolic leaf extract was caused by its immunomodulatory effect and is linked to the enhanced survival of fingerlings. The analysis of non-specific and specific immune factors confirms that methanolic leaf extract-induced HSP70, HSP90 and IgM levels mediate the survival of H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection. Taken together, our study provides evidence that the generation of anti-stress and antioxidative responses, as well as humoral immunity, may play a role in protecting H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection. It is probable that E. alba methanolic leaf extract treatment might become part of a holistic strategy to control EUS in",

            "text": "Aphanomyces invadans, an aquatic oomycete most frequently recognized as a causative agent of the epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is a seasonal epidemic pathogen of great importance in wild and farmed fish in both freshwater and estuarine environments [1\u20134]. EUS is an OIE-listed disease, causing complex infectious etiology, which leads to necrosis ulcerative lesions and granulomatous response in fishes. The disease was first identified from Japan in 1971, and later it was reported in south-east Queensland (Australia) in 1972. Subsequently, the outbreaks spread widely across North America and the Asia-Pacific region [5]. It is one of the most destructive diseases among freshwater and brackish water fish in the Asia-Pacific region, and about 125 fish species have been confirmed to be affected\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9020142 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142 2 of 17\nby EUS, causing a huge economic impact. For instance, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, it caused an estimated loss of USD 110 million in the aquaculture farms of the Asia-Pacific region [6,7]. The traditional methods applied so far in the mitigation or cure of microbial infection, such as disinfectants and antibiotics, had very limited success. Additionally, their application in the food production sector is under severe public and scientific scrutiny due to the development of multiple antibiotic-resistant microbial phenotypes. This created a huge concern among food production and drug development regulatory bodies, and more emphasis has been given in the development of plant-based and/or natural compounds to enhance the immune reactivity and disease resistance in fish against pathogenic microbes [8,9]. It is important to mention that several environmental and biological factors are responsible for the growth and establishment of A. invadans, which further attracts secondary pathogens to enter the lesions, thus increasing the severity of the infection [10\u201313]. Hence, a holistic approach focuses on the development of plant-derived compounds or natural products that enhance the host immune system and generate anti-infective strategies that will have the highest chance of decreasing the risk of pathogenic A. invadans infection in fish. The use of plant-based compounds or natural products has attracted keen interest in the past decades due to their antimicrobial, immunostimulant and antioxidant properties. For instance, Harikrishnan et al. [14,15] demonstrated that dietary supplementation of plant-based compounds significantly improves immune response and disease resistance in fish infected with the fungal pathogen, A. invadans. Afzali and Wong [16] reported that dietary supplementation of the Sonneratia alba extract enhances immunity and provides protection and disease resistance in goldfish against A. invadans. Kumar et al. [17,18] further highlighted that plant-based compounds (Mikania cordata leaf powder) can be used as a potential immunostimulatory agent to enhance the non-specific immune response and disease resistance of fish against the A. invadans infection. Although these studies have shown promising results in enhancing immune response and developing resistance in fish, there was no further work to utilize this management approach to control A. invadans infection. The Eclipta alba belongs to the family Asteraceae and is commonly known as false daisy in English and bhringraj in India; it has several ethnomedicinal properties. The plant has diverse medicinal values mainly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory tract disorders, fever, hair loss and graying of hair, liver disorders, skin disorders, spleen enlargement and cuts and wounds in higher vertebrates, including humans [19]. This motivated us to investigate the potential role of E. alba leaf extract against a commercially important Oomycetes disease, epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). The study describes that E. alba leaf methanolic extract induces anti-stress, antioxidant and non-specific and specific immunity that leads to increased survival of H. fossilis fingerlings against EUS-causing A. invadans. In this study, using an Oomycetes, a fungus-like eukaryotic pathogen, and a susceptible fish species, i.e., Heteropneustes fossilis, we aimed to investigate whether the methanolic extract of E. alba leaves potentiates the generation of in vivo anti-stress, antioxidant and immunity. Hereto, the H. fossilis fingerlings were exposed to methanolic leaf extract of E. alba and Oomycetes pathogen A. invadans. Underlying protective mechanisms were examined by studying the antioxidant enzyme activity, serum biochemical indices and immune-stress responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of E. alba leaves\u2019 methanolic extract-induced immunomodulation, resulting in the induction of resistance in H. fossilis fingerlings against pathogenic A. invadans."

Eclipta alba (Bhringaraj) Leaf Methanolic Extract Lethality Test and Challenge Assay\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines were followed for the handling and care of experimental animals. The animal utilization protocol was approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute, Kolkata, India, (IAEC/2021/04) for the experimental setup.\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142 6 of 17\n2.4.2. Acclimatization of Experimental Fish\nHealthy Heteropneustes fossilis (Stinging catfish) of size (length = 100.4\u00b1 5.3 mm, weight = 15.83 \u00b1 2.8 g) were collected from ICAR-CIFRI, Barrackpore, India culture facility. There were no external clinical symptoms, such as hemorrhage, ulcer, discoloration, descaling and redness, in the body of the fish. Additionally, before the challenge assay, the fish were randomly selected and screened for the presence of possible infectious microbes following the standard protocol (Nickum et al., 2004; Johansen et al., 2006). The fish were acclimatized in 200 L FRP tanks for 2 weeks and commercial floating feed (CP: 30%, CL: 5%) was fed to fish at 5\u20133% of the biomass in two equal installments (10:00 h, 15.00 h).\n2.4.3. Lethality Test of E. alba Extract\nIn the first experiment, the cytotoxic effect of E. alba (Bhringaraj) methanolic leaf extract was determined on the H. fossilis, as described previously [20] with slight modifications. Briefly, 20 nos. of H. fossilis fingerlings were randomly in 40 liters of glass aquaria containing 20 liters of water. The fingerlings were exposed to increasing concentrations of methanolic leaf extract, viz., 5 (T1), 10 (T2), 25 (T3), 50 (T4), 75 (T5), 100 (T6) and 125 ppm (T7) in 1% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 168 h. The H. fossilis fingerlings group that did not receive the Bhringaraj leaf extract but supplemented with only 1% of DMSO served as a control. The toxicity of the compound was determined 168 h post-exposure by scoring the number of survivors, as previously described [21]. Three replicates were maintained for each treatment and control group.\n2.4.4. LC50 Analysis of A. invadans\nIn the second experiment, it was determined whether A. invadans isolate could cause mortality in H. fossilis fingerlings, and to this end, an LC50 study was carried out. Following OIE (2019) bioassay protocol described for fish susceptible to infection with A. invadanssusceptible species (e.g., H. fossilis), serial dilutions of five test concentrations of A. invadans @ 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mL suspension of 100+ motile zoospores/liter of water were prepared to evaluate the Oomycetes lethal concentration required for mortality of 50% (LC50) of the fish population. The number of zoospores in the suspension was calculated by using a Neubauer counting chamber and was adjusted to the required concentration. The H. fossilis fingerlings (20 nos.) were randomly distributed in six different tanks; one tank for control and five tanks for challenge study. The fingerlings were exposed to increasing concentrations of A. invadans, viz., 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mL suspension of 100+ motile zoospores/liter of water at 20 \u25e6C. The control group of fish was added to a sterilized normal saline solution. The survival of H. fossilis fingerlings was scored 168 h after the addition of the pathogen, and each treatment was performed in triplicate.\n2.4.5. Dose Response Study\nIn the next experiment, independent challenge assays were performed to determine the dose\u2013response relationship (protective effect) of E. alba methanolic leaf extract. Firstly, 40 \u00b5L of A. invadans spore suspension in potato dextrose broth (PDB) (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) was inoculated onto 20 mL of sterile PDB in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The culture was incubated for 120 h at 20 \u25e6C. The zoospores number in the suspension was calculated by using a Neubauer counting chamber and was adjusted to the required concentration. Afterward, a group of 20 nos. of H. fossilis fingerlings was randomly distributed in 40 liters of glass aquaria containing 20 liters of water. The aquaria were supplemented with increasing concentrations of methanolic leaf extract (non-lethal dose), viz., 5 (T1), 10 (T2), 25 (T3), 50 (T4), 75 (T5), and 100 ppm (T6) in 1% of DMSO for 168 h, as described above in the toxicity assay. Simultaneously, the aquaria were added separately with A. invadans @ 4 mL suspension of 100+ motile zoospores/liter of water at 20 \u25e6C (based on LC50 analysis of A. invadans). The survival of H. fossilis fingerlings was scored 168 h after the addition of the pathogen. The non-exposed fingerlings supplemented with only 1% of DMSO (Bhringaraj\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142 7 of 17\nleaf extract) that were either challenged or not with A. invadans were maintained as positive and negative controls. Each treatment and control was performed in triplicate."

Briefly, the fish were anesthetized with clove oil (@ 50 \u00b5L per liter water), and 2 mL hypodermal syringe and 24 gauge needles were used to collect blood (100\u2013200 \u00b5L/ fish) by puncturing the caudal vein of the fish. The blood was kept in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube without anticoagulant and stored in a freezer (4 \u25e6C) overnight. Afterward, the samples were centrifuged at 4000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u25e6C and straw-colored serum was collected and stored in sterile Eppendorf tubes at \u221220 \u25e6C, until further used for analysis. All the procedures were carried out in sterilized conditions.\n2.6. Serum Biochemical Analysis 2.6.1. Antioxidant Enzymes\nThe activity of antioxidant and metabolic enzymes was measured in serum following the standard techniques with slight modifications. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured according to Misra and Fredovich (1972) in a medium containing sodium carbonate buffer (pH 10.2), EDTA, enzyme extract, and epinephrine. The change in absorbance was monitored at 480 nm using a microplate reader (BioTekEpochTM2 Take-3 plate reader, California, USA). The method of Calibrone (1985) was used to determine catalase (CAT) activity. The drop in intensity at 240 nm was used to determine the breakdown of H2O2. The reaction solution comprised 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 50 mM H2O2, and the efficiency of the reaction was determined at 240 nm using a microplate reader (BioTekEpochTM2 Take-3 plate reader, USA) calibrated to 320 nm H2O2 an extinction coefficient of 40 M\u22121 cm\u22121. CAT units were defined as one unit of H2O2 decomposed per minute per milligram of protein.\n2.6.2. Serum Biochemical Indices and Immune Stress Responses\nSerum protein was measured by using an automated biochemical analyzer (Auto Analyzer, Transasia-Erba EM\u2013200, USA). The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP70) activity in serum were quantified using standard protocols and reagents provided by the manufacturer. These assays were performed using an ELISA assay kit (EA0011FI and E0064FI, BT BioAssay, Shanghai, China), as per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The final OD was taken at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTekEpochTM2 Take-3 plate reader). The assay was performed in triplicate and is representative of two independent experiments. For the cortisol assay commercial kit provided by Bioassay technology laboratory (EA0004FI, BT BioAssay, Shanghai, China). Briefly, 20 \u00b5L of each of the cortisol standard solutions (0, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 ng.ml\u22121) and fish serum samples were added in duplicate to the microplate. Similarly, the samples for the recovery and linearity test were dispensed in other wells. Standard solutions and fish serum samples for the recovery test were assayed in duplicate. Subsequently, 200 \u00b5L of enzyme conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added into each well. Later, the wells were gently mixed for 10 min and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The solution of each well was removed by washing the plate three times with 400 \u00b5L of PBS and shaking out the content onto absorbent paper to remove residual drops that could affect the accuracy and precision of the assay. Subsequently, 100 \u00b5L of TMB (tetramethyl benzidine) enzyme substrate was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was visualized by the color change and was stopped by the addition of 100 \u00b5L of 0.5 M phosphoric acid (H2PO3). The intensity of color is inversely proportional to the concentration of cortisol in the samples. Absorbance was reading a spectrophotometer at 450 nm on a microtiter plate reader within 10 min after the addition of the stop solution. The total immunoglobulin M (IgM) in fish serum was measured using a commercial ELISA kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (E0025Fi, BT BioAssay, Shanghai,\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142 8 of 17\nChina). In brief, 50 \u00b5L of the standard sample was added on a standard well containing biotinylated antibody. Afterward, 40 \u00b5L of the sample, 10 \u00b5L anti-COR antibody, and 50 \u00b5L streptavidin-HRP were added into wells. The solution was thoroughly mixed and covered with plate sealer. The plate was incubated for 60 min at 37 \u25e6C. Later, the cover was removed and washed 5 times with wash buffer. During each washing, a minimum 0.35 mL of wash buffer was kept for 30 s to 1 min. An amount of 50 \u00b5L of substrate solution A and 50 \u00b5L of substrate solution B were added into wells. The plates were sealed and inoculated for 10 min at 37 \u25e6C in dark conditions. Afterward, 50 \u00b5L of stop solution was added in each well, and we observed the color change from blue to yellow. We measured the OD of each well immediately using a microplate reader at 450 nm within 10 min after the addition of the stop solution."

In contrast, the 125 ppm extract induced significantly high toxicity, and 40 % mortality was observed in the treatment group. This result indicates that methanolic leaf extract appeared to be toxic in high concentrations under the present experimental conditions. In the next experiment, we examined the optimum dose of A. invadans required for the dose\u2013response study. We found that H. fossilis fingerlings, when exposed to five infectious doses of A. invadans (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mL), showed a significant difference in the survival of fingerlings. The A. invadans infectious dose, 4 mL suspension of 100+ motile zoospores/litre of water, provoking significant mortality near 60% at 168 h, was considered an optimum dose and selected for the experimental challenge (Figure 5B). We next investigated whether E. alba methanolic leaf extract could confer protection to the host H. fossilis against A. invadans, which can cause epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) in both freshwater and brackish water fish. We found that H. fossilis fingerlings that received leaf extract in the range of 5\u2013100 ppm exhibited a significant increase in survival compared to positive control. However, the maximum survival (~2 folds) was observed at a concentration between 50\u2013100 ppm (Figure 5C).

Interestingly, the E. alba extract has shown promising results in aquaculture animals. A study by Citarasu et al. [30] demonstrated that E. alba significantly enhances survival and reduced the viral load in shrimps. Furthermore, the extract supplementation has been reported to enhance both the humoral and cellular non-specific immune responses and provide disease resistance in Oreochromis mossambicus against A. hydrophila [31]. Given the potential of the plant-based compound E. alba as an anti-infective agent, understanding the underlying mechanism of action of this compound against fungal infection is considered vital. The ability to stimulate the defense system of vertebrates is considered to be central to controlling the pathogenesis of many microbial pathogens [32,33]. In the case of aquatic animals that are constantly exposed to microbial pathogens, non-specific and specific immune factors might be a potential preventive modality for the control of biotic and abiotic stressors in the aquaculture production systems [34,35]. Although previous works have shown that natural/plant-based compounds increase the resistance of the host against bacterial infection by facilitating enhanced immune response [36,37], the role of natural/plant-based compounds against EUS-causing A. invadans Oomycetes pathogens and the molecular mechanism behind the protective effect in hosts remains to be established. In this study, using a H. fossilis and A. invadans host\u2013pathogen model system, it was shown that E. alba leaf methanolic extract protects H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans. The stress-mediated impairment of immune function has been widely described in cultured and wild fish and is associated with increased susceptibility to disease [38,39]. The stress response is initiated and controlled by the production of corticosteroids (mainly cortisol, a steroid hormone with many biological activities, including gluconeogenesis and immunosuppression). Cortisol, a principal corticosteroid released as part of the primary stress response, is normally associated with stressful and disease conditions, where the fish can perceive a threat. It plays a critical role in mediating adaptive metabolic, physiological, and behavioral adjustments. The level of cortisol in fish indicates the health status of animals, as extended increased cortisol level is often negatively associated with growth, development, disease resistance, immunity, and reproduction [34]. It is important to mention that oxidative stress and infectious disease are interrelated and the emergence of one phenomenon leads to the development of another and vice versa. For instance, the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by activated immune cells during microbial disease creates a highly cytotoxic environment that leads to an imbalanced immune response and direct damage to target organs [40]. In parallel, the study showed that A. invadans infection significantly induced stressful conditions in H. fossilis fingerlings, resulting in higher cortisol and lower antioxidative enzyme activity in the positive control group of fish. Interestingly, the observed cortisol concentrations are very low and indicate, at most, very mild stress. Similar observations were reported by Webster et al. (2020) in juvenile Atlantic salmon. Results showed that exposure to a mild confinement stressor for two weeks has a significant impact on the physiology of fish, marked by increased levels of cortisol [41]. In contrast, E. alba leaf methanolic extract supplementation exhibited a protective effect in H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection by a possible mechanism of anti-stress and antioxidant activity. In the methanolic extract treatment groups, reduced cortisol and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD and CAT) were observed. The antioxidant enzymes, viz., superoxide dismutases (SOD) (detoxifies toxic superoxide anion radicals) and catalase (CAT) (primary antioxidant defense component), located within different cellular compartments (mitochondrial and cytosolic) in fish, are responsible for the generation of antioxidant defense response and imparting protection from oxidative stress by the detoxification of free radicals. Our results were consistent with the known beneficial roles of plant-based compounds to induce resistance in the host and prevent microbial infection functionally through anti-stress, antioxidant, and immunostimulatory properties [42,43].\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 142 15 of 17\nThere exists a correlation between the reduced stress and enhanced antioxidative response, with non-specific immune response (HSP70, HSP90) and specific immune response (IgM) of animals against microbial infection [20,21,42\u201345]. Interestingly, E. alba leaf methanolic extract significantly enhances HSP70, HSP90, and IgM levels in H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection. Our results indicate that increased survival in H. fossilis treated with leaf methanolic extract is mostly due to a significant improvement in the health status of the fish. This is due to the fact that apart from reducing cortisol levels and enhancing antioxidative response, the methanolic leaf extracts significantly induce both the non-specific and specific immunity of H. fossilis fingerlings."

Our study provides strong evidence that the initial generation of anti-stress, antioxidative response, and non-specific and specific immunity plays a key role in the protection of H. fossilis fingerlings against A. invadans infection. The ability of the E. alba leaf extract to boost immunity and induce resistance in H. fossilis makes it a potent biocontrol agent that may be valuable to avert A. invadans infection in other fish species. The results obtained add new information about the mode of action of E. alba methanolic leaf extract and advance our knowledge of this compound as a potential disease-mitigating agent.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.K. and B.K.D.; methodology, V.K.; software, V.K.; validation, V.K. and H.S.S., formal analysis, V.K. and H.S.S.; investigation, V.K.; data curation, V.K., S.R., and R.C.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.K., B.K.D., H.C., A.K.B., and B.K.B.; visualization, V.K. and B.K.D.; supervision, B.K.D.; project administration, B.K.D. and B.K.B.; funding acquisition, B.K.D.
