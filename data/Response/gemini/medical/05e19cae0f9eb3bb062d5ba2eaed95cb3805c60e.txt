1. **Investigate the potential of combining IL-15-secreting poxviruses with other immunotherapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive T cell therapy, to enhance anti-tumor efficacy in glioma models.**


2. **Explore the use of IL-15-secreting poxviruses to target other types of brain tumors, such as medulloblastoma or meningioma, to determine their broad applicability in the treatment of brain cancer.**


3. **Investigate the mechanisms by which IL-15-secreting poxviruses modulate the tumor microenvironment, including their effects on immune cell infiltration, cytokine production, and angiogenesis, to gain a better understanding of their anti-tumor activity.**


4. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-15-secreting poxviruses in preclinical models of other types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or colon cancer, to assess their potential for use in a wider range of malignancies.**


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-15-secreting poxviruses in patients with recurrent or refractory gliomas, to determine their potential for translation into the clinic.**
