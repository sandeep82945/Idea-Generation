Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) eliminate reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide through a catalytic cycle of Cys oxidation and reduction. Additionally, upon Cys oxidation PRDXs undergo extensive conformational rearrangements that may underlie their presently structurally poorly defined functions as molecular chaperones. Rearrangements include high molecular-weight oligomerization, the dynamics of which are, however, poorly understood, as is the impact of disulfide bond formation on these properties. Here we show that formation of disulfide bonds along the catalytic cycle induces extensive \u03bcs time scale dynamics, as monitored by magic-angle spinning NMR of the 216 kDa-large Tsa1 decameric assembly and solution-NMR of a designed dimeric mutant. We ascribe the conformational dynamics to structural frustration, resulting from conflicts between the disulfide-constrained reduction of mobility and the desire to fulfill other favorable contacts. \u25a0 INTRODUCTION Peroxiredoxin enzymes (PRDXs), present in all kingdoms of life, play a key role in detoxifying cells from a variety of peroxides and act as peroxide sensors and protein redox regulation factors. Tsa1 is a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from yeast, with two conserved cysteines that participate in the catalytic cycle: the peroxidatic cysteine (CP, Cys47) is responsible for the catalytic activity by reacting with a peroxide, ROOH, to produce the reduced, nontoxic form, ROH, thereby getting itself oxidized to a sulfenic acid, CP\u2212 SOH. To regenerate the peroxidatic cysteine, the so-called resolving cysteine (CR, Cys170 in Tsa1) forms a disulfide bond with the oxidized CP, thereby releasing a water molecule. The disulfide, CP\u2212S\u2212S\u2212CR, is reduced to the sulfhydryl form, CP\u2212 SH and CR\u2212SH, by the NADPH-dependent Trx/TrxR system. The catalytic cycle is schematically depicted in Figure S1. During this cycle, the protein undergoes a number of structural modifications, which have been investigated by crystallography. Structures of oxidized and reduced forms, enabled in some cases by mutation of the peroxidatic cysteine, have been reported for several PRDXs (reviewed in refs 4 and 6). However, in crystal structures of oxidized states, large parts (>20 residues) have not been modeled, in particular around the cysteines, which has hampered the assessment of the structural and dynamical consequences of disulfide bond formation. For Tsa1 only the structure of a mutant has been reported, in which the catalytic cysteine CP is mutated to a serine (C47S), and which therefore cannot undergo the functional cycle. PRDXs switch between different oligomeric states (dimers, decamers and higher oligomerization states) depending on redox state, pH, and other factors. The dimer\u2212 decamer transition has even been observed directly in cells. The dimer\u2212decamer equilibrium is a complex and not entirely understood function of the above-mentioned parameters. Most of the available crystal structures report decameric rings, formed by the assembly of five dimers. Exciting discoveries over the past years have brought to light an additional role of PRDXs: they can act as chaperones, preventing other proteins from aggregation. Jang et al. demonstrated that cytosolic Tsa1/Tsa2 can reversibly assemble to high-molecular weight (HMW) species in vivo, and that the HMW species of Tsa1 inhibit aggregation of citrate synthase three times more efficiently than the small heat-shock protein alphaB-Crystallin. The conversion to high-molecular weight species of cytosolic Tsa1/Tsa2 in vivo is favored by exposing the cell to H2O2 and heat shock, and (at least in the former case) is thought to be due to oxidation of the catalytic cysteine thiol into a sulfinic acid, Cys\u2212 Received: February 1, 2023 Published: May 4, 2023 Article pubs.acs.org/JACS \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) eliminate reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide through a catalytic cycle of Cys oxidation and reduction. Additionally, upon Cys oxidation PRDXs undergo extensive conformational rearrangements that may underlie their presently structurally poorly defined functions as molecular chaperones. Rearrangements include high molecular-weight oligomerization, the dynamics of which are, however, poorly understood, as is the impact of disulfide bond formation on these properties.

To regenerate the peroxidatic cysteine, the so-called resolving cysteine (CR, Cys170 in Tsa1) forms a disulfide bond with the oxidized CP, thereby releasing a water molecule. The disulfide, CP\u2212S\u2212S\u2212CR, is reduced to the sulfhydryl form, CP\u2212 SH and CR\u2212SH, by the NADPH-dependent Trx/TrxR system.4 The catalytic cycle is schematically depicted in Figure S1. During this cycle, the protein undergoes a number of structural modifications, which have been investigated by crystallography. Structures of oxidized and reduced forms, enabled in some cases by mutation of the peroxidatic cysteine, have been reported for several PRDXs (reviewed in refs 4 and 6). However, in crystal structures of oxidized states, large parts (>20 residues) have not been modeled, in particular around the cysteines, which has hampered the assessment of the structural and dynamical consequences of disulfide bond formation.7,8 For Tsa1 only the structure of a mutant has been reported, in which the catalytic cysteine CP is mutated to a serine (C47S), and which therefore cannot undergo the\nfunctional cycle. PRDXs switch between different oligomeric states (dimers, decamers and higher oligomerization states) depending on redox state, pH, and other factors.

Additional factors, including phosphorylation (Thr90 in hPrxI)15 or exposure to low pH,16 have been shown to induce a functional switch of PRDXs from peroxidases to chaperones. Since these seminal discoveries of a chaperone function, a similar behavior has been found in other 2-Cys PRDXs in different organisms such as SmPrx1 from the parasite Schistosoma mansoni,17,18 the human hPrx1,15 and the mitochondr ia l PRDX from Lei shmania in fantum mTXNPx.19\u221221 The ATP-independent chaperone activity was generally found in vitro by biochemical assays; for example, mTXNPx prevents aggregation of citrate synthase at elevated temperatures.20 Understanding the structural and dynamical consequences of disulfide formation and of oligomerization appears necessary to understand peroxidase function as well as the intriguing chaperone activity of PRDXs.\nIn this study we use magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to probe dynamics of decameric Tsa1 in its reduced and oxidized forms. Recently developed NEar-rotary Resonance Relaxation Dispersion (NERRD) experiments demonstrate that disulfide formation induces extensive microsecond (\u03bcs) motions. Moreover, Bloch\u2212McConnell R1\u03c1 relaxation dispersion MAS NMR reveals \u03bcs dynamics in the dimer\u2212dimer interface. A mutation\nin this interface converts the protein to its dimeric form. Solution-NMR of this dimeric variant shows disorder in the vicinity of the cysteines, suggesting that the dynamic patch observed in oxidized decameric Tsa1 is at least in part present already in the dimer. We find a striking coincidence of the \u03bcs dynamics and structural frustration22 and propose that the induced dynamics in the oxidized form is important for the functional catalytic cycle, and possibly for chaperone function.\n\u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MAS NMR reveals that decameric reduced Tsa1 is\noverall rigid. We have performed size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and found that at ambient temperature Tsa1 exists primarily in a decameric state, accounting for more than 80% of the total protein concentration (216 kDa; Supplementary Figure S2A). When reinjecting the decameric species into SEC-MALS, only the decameric state is obtained (Figure S2B), which establishes that we can obtain stable homogeneous decamer samples. We have reinjected the decamer also in the presence of a reducing agent (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; TCEP), as well as after treating the sample with H2O2, and found that under all these conditions Tsa1 forms a decameric assembly of ca. 216 kDa (Figure S2). Based on the slightly altered elution profile upon TCEP-addition leading to two distinct peaks representing the oxidized and reduced decameric species (Figure S2B), we conclude that the recombinant expressed Tsa1 is in the oxidized state.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10701\nNMR is ideally suited to probe dynamics and local conformation at the level of individual atoms, but in solution the NMR signals of particles as large as decameric Tsa1 are broadened due to the associated slow overall tumbling. Indeed, a solution-NMR 1H\u221215N spectrum of Tsa1 at ambient temperature shows only very few peaks, even with a deuterated sample and TROSY experiments23 (Figure S3). The 1H\u221215N peaks observed at ambient temperature correspond to the flexible loop regions, according to the chemical-shift assignment (discussed below).\nMagic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR avoids the signal loss/ broadening induced by the slow tumbling in solution, by immobilizing the proteins:24 in the present case, we obtained MAS NMR samples by sedimenting (ultracentrifuging) decameric Tsa1 from a solution into an MAS rotor,25 thereby retaining a fully hydrated sample (approximately half of the rotor volume is aqueous buffer). Due to the absence of the overall tumbling in the sediment, MAS NMR spectra are not impacted by the particle size. We used MAS NMR to probe the structure and dynamics of the intact decameric assembly at ambient temperature. Under reducing conditions, i.e. in the presence of 5 mM TCEP in the solution, the MAS NMR spectra are of very high quality, as exemplified with a 1H\u221215N spectrum in Figure 1A. The reduced state stayed stable for more than one month in the MAS NMR rotor, as evidenced by unchanged spectra over at least this time period (possibly even longer; spectra of the oxidized state stayed unchanged for several months). Using a set of 1H-detected 3D H\u2212N\u2212C and H\u2212N\u2212N correlation spectra, we were able to assign the resonances of the majority (72%) of the backbone of this reduced state, Tsa1red. Example strip plots of the assignment are shown in Figure S4. The secondary structures, obtained from the chemical-shift assignment and TALOS-N,26 are in very good agreement with the crystal structure of Tsa1C47S that cannot form the (Cys47-Cys170) disulfide bond (Figures 1B, S5 and S6).\nExtensive \u03bcs Motion in Decameric Tsa1 in the Oxidized State. The oxidized state, Tsa1ox, differs very markedly from the reduced one, as immediately visible from its 1H\u221215N spectrum (Figure 1A). The oxidized state is obtained after purification in nonreducing (native) conditions or, equally, by treatment with H2O2 (see Methods). Because formation of a disulfide bond links the catalytic cysteine, CP, of one subunit to the CR of another subunit, the presence of a disulfide bond can readily be monitored by the appearance of dimeric species in sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2212polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Without any reducing treatment (but denatured by SDS which is expected to break noncovalent interactions within the decamer), Tsa1 indeed migrates as a dimer, demonstrating the presence of a disulfide bond; upon treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) only monomeric species are observed (Figure S7). We have verified by NMR that the native state of a dimeric Tsa1 described below before and after H2O2 treatment are identical (Figure S8; done for a dimeric mutant, see below).\nThe MAS NMR line widths in the decameric Tsa1ox are substantially larger than those of Tsa1red, and importantly, the number of observed cross-peaks is strongly reduced compared to Tsa1red: we observed ca. 92 1H\u221215N cross peaks (combining information from 2D hNH and 3D hCANH/hCONH spectra, disregarding side chains peaks), for an expected 184 nonproline residues.\nIt is known that increased line width can be induced by insufficient hydration, particularly dramatic for lyophilized proteins.27 We can, however, safely rule out that the lower quality of the spectra of Tsa1ox is the result of lower hydration levels: one-dimensional proton spectra show an intense water signal, similar to the one in Tsa1red (Figure S9). As the protein is sedimented from a solution, it is indeed expected that the sediment contains well-hydrated protein.\nThe reduced number of amide signals might possibly also be the result of incomplete back-exchange of amides from 2H to 1H after the protein has been produced in E. coli in D2O (2H2O). However, we can also safely rule out this possibility for two reasons: first, the Tsa1red sample has been obtained from Tsa1ox by addition of reducing agent, and in Tsa1red the amides are visible; second, comparison of solution-state NMR spectra of a dimeric mutant of Tsa1 produced in H2O does not show any additional peaks to samples produced in D2O, suggesting that amide reprotonation is not an issue (Figure S10).\nWe have considered the possibility that peaks are missing because they are highly flexible and dynamically disordered on ps\u2212ns time scales. If this was the case, the dipolar coupling would be strongly reduced; as the dipolar coupling is the basis for coherence transfer in the above-mentioned experiments, such motion would indeed render the transfer inefficient, leading to very low signal. However, the J-coupling is independent of such motion, and J-coupling based experiments may allow transfer, but they require fast motion of significant amplitude in order to obtain sufficiently long coherence life times. (This requirement for fast large-amplitude motion is relaxed to some degree in the kind of deuterated proteins used here.) We observed for Tsa1ox that J-coupling based experiments do not reveal any additional peaks (Figure S11). This observation allows us to exclude the hypothesis that fast (ps\u2212 ns) large-amplitude dynamics, reminiscent of random-coil behavior, causes the loss of those signals in dipolar-based experiments, which are observed in Tsa1red but not in Tsa1ox.\nWe have used dipolar-coupling based 3D and 4D correlation experiments of 1HN, 13C, and 15N nuclei along the backbone, to obtain residue-specific assignments of the observed crosspeaks (see Methods). We were able to assign the vast majority of the detectable backbone resonances, which correspond to 88 residues along the sequence (45%). The near-complete assignment of the peaks observed in the spectrum allows identifying which parts of the structure are not detectable in this oxidized decameric state: the undetected parts cluster around the \u03b1-helix that harbors the peroxidatic Cys (residues 38\u221255), the internal \u03b2-strands \u03b26 and \u03b27 (residues 123\u2212130 and 134\u2212140), and the structurally adjacent large C-terminal part (residues 166\u2212196) that comprises a long helix \u03b16 (residues 149\u2212165), a loop region that harbors the resolvingcysteine CR and the C-terminal helix. When seen in the context of the decameric ring, the unobserved residues in Tsa1ox are located on the outer rim of the ring (Figure 1C).\nTo identify the origin of the peak loss, we measured 15N spin relaxation in Tsa1ox and Tsa1red by MAS NMR. Longitudinal relaxation (R1) is sensitive mostly to amplitudes and time scales of motions occurring on ps-ns time scales. Relaxation of 15N coherence in the presence of a spin-lock pulse (R1\u03c1) is mostly sensitive to motions on time scales of tens of nanoseconds to hundreds of \u03bcs.28\u221234 Figure 2A, B shows calculated relaxation rate constants for motion occurring on different time scales. R1\u03c1 experiments can be applied at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10702\nmultiple radiofrequency (RF) spin-lock field strengths, and the dependence on the RF field strength reveals specifically \u03bcs\u2212ms motion (Figure 2A, insert), an effect sometimes referred to as NEar Rotary-resonance Relaxation Dispersion (NERRD; see below).30,35,36 Thus, these different relaxation measurements allow the identification and quantitative interpretation of motional time scales and amplitudes in different time windows.\nIn the reduced state, Tsa1red, R1\u03c1 rate constants at 10 kHz spin-lock amplitude are ca. 2.9 s\u22121 (median), and longitudinal relaxation rate constants (15N R1) are ca. 0.05 s\u22121. These are typical values for compact folded proteins without large-scale ns\u2212\u03bcs motion.37\u221243 Residues with higher-than-average relaxation rate constants include K30, G31, E117, V167, which are all located in loop regions, as well as the very C-terminal residues. The larger-amplitude motions reflected by these data are also typical for loops and termini. Overall, the 15N relaxation data show that Tsa1red is rather rigid on the ps\u2212ns time scales (sensed mostly by R1) and ns\u2212\u03bcs (sensed mostly by R1\u03c1) .\nThe oxidized state, Tsa1ox, differs strongly from its reduced counterpart, particularly with respect to transverse relaxation: the average R1\u03c1 is ca. 3-fold higher under the same conditions as used for the reduced sample. This finding unambiguously shows the presence of motion that is either of larger amplitude (on the ns\u2212\u03bcs time scale) or shifted toward the \u03bcs range, where R1\u03c1 is highest (Figure 2A). Longitudinal relaxation, reflecting faster motion, is more similar in the two states. However, the residues for which significantly faster R1 relaxation is observed are located in the vicinity of the two cysteines, suggesting that disulfide bond formation enhances not only \u03bcs motion but also faster (ns) dynamics (Figure 2F). Residues further away from the disulfide-bonded parts tend to have more similar R1 values (blue in Figure 2F). The overall enhanced transverse relaxation in Tsa1ox also provides a rationale why J-coupling based experiments do not provide additional (but rather much less) signal, as discussed above: enhanced transverse relaxation leads to rapid loss of signal in INEPT experiments.\nTo obtain more precise information about this motion, we performed 15N R1\u03c1 NEar-rotary Resonance Relaxation Dispersion (NERRD) experiments; i.e., we measured R1\u03c1 rate constants as a function of the applied spin-lock field strength, approaching the regime where the spin-lock field strength (nutation frequency \u03bdRF) approaches the MAS frequency \u03bdMAS. Nonflat NERRD profiles directly point to motion on time scales of \u03bcs (see Figure 2A). The underlying mechanism is the fluctuation of the H\u2212N bond orientation (dipolar coupling and chemical-shift anisotropy, CSA).28 In Tsa1ox we find strong NERRD effects for all observed residues (Figures 2D and S12).\nThe relaxation rate constants for the different experiments (R1 and R1\u03c1 at different RF field strengths) are the result of motions occurring with a distribution of amplitudes (1 \u2212 S2) and time scales (\u03c4c).44 To gain more quantitative insight, we Figure 2.

(A) 15N R1\u03c1 relaxation is most sensitive to motion on time scales from hundreds of ns to tens of ms. If the motion is slower than ca. 1 \u03bcs, R1\u03c1 depends on the spin-lock field strength, giving rise to NERRD dispersion profiles, i.e. a nonflat profile of R1\u03c1 vs spin-lock (insert).

Rather than fitting \u03bcs dynamics as a single process at one time scale, as commonly done in solution and solids,46 the spin relaxation is modeled as resulting from combined dynamical processes with correlation times across the ns\u2212ms range, assuming a distribution of correlation times \u03b8(z), given on a logarithmic scale, where z = log10 (\u03c4c/s). The detectors, which report on the distribution of motions over the range of correlation time, are shown in Figure 3A, and the responses of\nthese detectors (reporting on the respective amplitudes) for Tsa1ox are shown in panel B. This analysis points, on the one hand, to enhanced ns motion of the loop region comprising K30 and G31 (indicated also by the R1 data of Figure 2E, F). On the other hand, \u03bcs motion is found for most residues across the protein in Tsa1ox, mirroring the generally high levels of R1\u03c1 and the nonflat NERRD profiles. The last observed residue, T138, as well as residues around the nonassigned part (residues 34\u221256), have particularly enhanced \u03bcs mobility; this is also evident from the data at 10 kHz RF field strength (Figure 2C). This finding supports the notion that the parts that are not visible in Tsa1ox are broadened due to \u03bcs motion of even larger amplitude which, thus, have even larger transverse relaxation.\nWe have furthermore applied Bloch\u2212McConnell relaxation dispersion (BMRD) experiments, which detect \u03bcs\u2212ms exchange processes based on chemical-shift fluctuations (rather\nthan fluctuations of the dipolar coupling and CSA, which are the basis of NERRD): in BMRD, \u03bcs\u2212ms modulation of the chemical shift leads to enhanced transverse relaxation, which can be quenched by a spin-lock that is sufficiently strong; thus, a decrease of R1\u03c1 rate constants when increasing the RF field strength from ca. 2 to above 10 kHz reveals chemical-shift fluctuations on \u03bcs\u2212ms time scales.30,35,46,47 Below ca. 2 kHz, insufficiently suppressed dipolar dephasing may lead to increased R1\u03c1.\n35 (Because the NERRD effects in Tsa1ox are large and extend even to low RF field strengths where BMRD effects are expected, we corrected the BMRD data by subtracting the dipolar and CSA contributions; see Methods and Figure S13.)\nFigure 4 shows that residues with significant BMRD effects are located at the interface of dimeric building blocks. Interestingly, similar effects are found for both the oxidized and reduced species. We ascribe this process to some flexibility within the dimer-to-dimer interface, which prompted us to investigate more closely the dimeric state and the oligomerization.\nSolution-NMR of dimeric Tsa1 reveals disorder around the cysteines. To understand the effects of decamer formation from dimers on structural and dynamical properties, we searched for ways of stabilizing the dimer. At ambient conditions Tsa1 predominantly exists in the decameric state, where solution-NMR spectra are of poor quality (in Figures S2, S3, S15). We followed how temperature changes the oligomerization state by performing methyl-detected diffusionordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) in solution using a deuterated, Ile/Leu/Val methyl-labeled sample. Because of the high intrinsic sensitivity of methyl groups, together with the methyl-TROSY effect,48 the signals of methyl groups are detectable even in the 216 kDa-large decameric Tsa1 assembly (Figure S15), which allowed us to quantify the diffusion coefficient. Temperature-dependent DOSY data reveal the transition from the decameric to a dimeric state with a midpoint at ca. 315 K above which Tsa1 is predominantly dimeric (Figure S16).\nHowever, prolonged experiments at such high temperatures are not compatible with the sample integrity, which prompted us to insert a mutation in the dimer\u2212dimer interface that disrupts decamer formation also at low temperature. The S78D mutant, identified before,49 appears entirely dimeric as seen by size-exclusion chromatography (Figure S2C). Note that S78 is located close to the cluster of residues for which we detected \u03bcs motion in the decameric state by BMRD experiments (Figure 4C). In contrast to the wild-type protein, Tsa1S78D yields excellent solution-NMR spectra of both backbone and methyl groups already at 298 K (Figures S3 and S15). We assigned the backbone resonances as well as a large extent of the methyl resonances of Ile (\u03b41), Val (\u03b31 and \u03b32), and Leu (\u03b41 and \u03b42) of the oxidized state, which corresponds to the form obtained after purification from E. coli (Figure S8).\nThe chemical-shift derived secondary structure propensity of the S78D dimer is largely in agreement with the crystal structure of Tsa1 and with the chemical-shift derived secondary structures of the decameric state by MAS NMR, but there are notable exceptions (Figure 1B). Importantly, the part that carries the peroxidatic Cys-47 (helix \u03b12) does not have chemical shifts of a stable \u03b1 -helix, unlike in the decameric state, which shows that this helix is marginally stable in the Tsa1S78D dimer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10704\nTo gain direct insights into the dynamics, we have performed backbone 15N amide and Ile, Leu, Val methyl 1H\u221213C triple-quantum relaxation experiments (Figures S17 and 5). Backbone 15N transverse relaxation rate constants (R1\u03c1) are ca. 2\u22123-fold reduced for residues located C-terminal to residue 180, including the part the forms helix \u03b17 in the decamer. Moreover, the methyl order parameters of residues in this part (V167, L168, I179, V183) are low (S2 \u223c 0.1), much lower than for the majority of the protein, providing independent evidence that the C-terminal part has significant disorder in the dimeric, oxidized Tsa1S78D (Figure 5). These findings show that the disorder in this part of the protein exists also in the dimer.\nStructural Frustration around the Dynamic Disulfide Part. Collectively, our NMR data have revealed that the\nformation of the disulfide bond induces dynamic disorder. As a consequence, signals in MAS NMR spectra of the oxidized state are broadened beyond detection, and we find broadening and disorder (in particular of the peroxidatic Cys\u2212(CP)carrying helix and the C-terminal ca. 20 residues) also in the dimer. One may expect that the \u03bcs motion that we have revealed here is reflected in structural heterogeneity when viewed by X-ray crystallography. This hypothesis can be tested for the case of the human homologue (PRDX2), for which structures of reduced (CP\u2212SH), hyperoxidised (CP\u2212SO2H),50 and oxidized (CP\u2212S\u2212S\u2212CR)7 decameric states have been determined. For the reduced and hyperoxidised states of PRDX2, as well as for reduced-state-mimicking Tsa1C47S, essentially the entire protein has been modeled at ca. 1.7 to 2.3 \u00c5 resolution, and with only modestly increased B-factors toward the very C-terminal residues and low B-factors for the CP-carrying helix (Supplementary Figure S18). In the oxidized state, however, the entire C-terminal part, comprising the two last helices and the connecting loop, as well as the helix containing the CP have elevated B-factors, and ca. 40 residues have not been modeled in the crystallographic model; moreover, superposition of the ten subunits of the decamer reveals significant structural heterogeneity (Figure S18E).\nWe propose that this dynamic disorder induced by the CP\u2212 S\u2212S\u2212CR bond formation is due to conflicting structural constraints within the protein, also denoted as structural frustration,22 which arises when multiple energetically favorable interactions cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As a consequence of structural frustration, the protein explores a broad shallow conformational landscape on longer time scales, rather than populating a narrow range of conformations with low-amplitude (fast) fluctuations. To explore this idea we have used the available crystal structures and determined the structural frustration for the reduced and oxidized states of PRDX2 (Figure 6A) and also of the reduced-mimicking state of Tsa1 (C47S mutant; no crystal structure of oxidized Tsa1 is available; Figure 6B). These data show a cluster of structurally\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10705\nfrustrated sites at the outer rim of the decameric ring (ca. residues 165 to the C-terminus) already in the reduced state (red in Figure 6A and right side in panel B). The oxidized state has a substantially increased number of maximally frustrated sites which cluster in particular in the parts comprising the two cysteines and the structurally neighboring part of residues ca. 80\u2212100. As noted, a large C-terminal stretch that forms an \u03b1helix in the reduced state is not observed in the oxidized state. Taken together, in light of the strong correlation of dynamic (\u03bcs motions, blurred electron density) and structurally\nfrustrated sites, we propose that structural frustration induced by disulfide-bond formation is at the core of the functional cycle of PRDXs. \u25a0 CONCLUSION Disulfide bond formation is generally associated with an increased stability of a folded state.51 Contrary to this view, our quantitative dynamics investigations have shown the appearance of collective \u03bcs motions upon formation of the key catalytic disulfide bond in a peroxiredoxin. Our data mirror the lack of visible density in crystallographic structures of the decameric assembly. Our solution-NMR data, using a mutant that stabilizes the dimer, point to dynamic disorder already in the dimeric state. Our data reveal a link between slow (\u03bcs) dynamics, structural frustration, and disulfide-bond formation. We ascribe the appearance of dynamics to the structural strain imposed by the disulfide onto the rest of the protein (see Figure 7). The link between disulfide-bond formation and\nstructural frustration found here for Tsa1 may well be more general; indeed, a recent study reports disulfide-bond induced dynamics in the oxidoreductase DsbD.52 Although the extensive dynamics hamper the actual visualization of the structural ensemble at the atomic level, we propose that the disulfide-induced dynamics likely leads to exposure of hydrophobic patches and an increase of the conformational entropy. Both of these effects have been ascribed to chaperone function: the increased entropy would lower the free-energy penalty associated with binding a disordered protein to the chaperone, and the exposure of hydrophobic patches is, generally, a key to chaperone mechanisms.53,54 Ongoing studies assess the link of the observed structural frustration and chaperone activity of PRDXs. \u25a0 METHODS Cloning. The plasmid harboring wild-type Tsa1 (pET19b-Tsa1; corresponding to UniProt entry P34760) was originally obtained with an amino-terminal deca-histidine-tag in a codon-optimized manner from GenScript (kind gift from P.O. Widlund/T. Nystro\u0308m). A S78D\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10706\nsingle point mutation was introduced into the Tsa1 plasmid by standard methods using the following forward 5\u2032 GGT CCA CGC CAG CAG GTC GTA TTC GCT ATC GGT G 3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032 CAC CGA TAG CGA ATA CGA CCT GCT GGC GTG GAC C 3\u2032 primers. Primers were purchased from Eurofins.\nProtein Expression and Purification. Tsa1 wild-type or Tsa1S78D plasmids were chemically transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. The cell culture was initiated by inoculation of a single colony into a 20 mL preculture of LB medium supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL Ampicillin, and subsequently incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. This preculture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB culture medium supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL Ampicillin, and cells were grown until an OD600 \u223c 0.6 was reached. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.3 mM IPTG, and cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000g for 25 min at 4 \u00b0C, subsequently resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole), and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen until purification. After the cells were thawed, one cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche), HL-SAN DNase I (ArcticZymes), and 1 mM MgCl2 were added to the lysate. Cells were lysed by 4 passes through an Avestin Emulsiflex C3 (pressure between 20,000\u221225,000 psi) and centrifuged at 24,000g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C. The cleared supernatant was applied to a Ni2+\u2212HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 3-step imidazole gradient in lysis buffer ranging from 150 mM to 500 mM and finally 1 M imidazole. Tsa1 typically eluted within the 500 mM imidazole fraction. The fractions containing Tsa1 were dialyzed against lysis buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C, concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Vivaspin concentrators, Sartorius), and applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex S200 increase, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with NMR buffer (typically 50 mM potassium-phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl or PBS pH 7.4). Fractions of the same oligomeric state were concentrated, and the concentration of the sample was quantified by measuring the optical density (OD280) based on the theoretical molar extinction coefficient of 24,500 M\u22121 cm\u22121.\nIsotope Labeling. Isotope labeled proteins were expressed either in H2O or D2O based M9 minimal media supplemented with the desired isotopes.55 For the uniformly labeled [U\u221215N] and [U\u221215N, 13C] proteins, (15NH4)Cl and D-(13C)-glucose were used, whereas for [U\u22122H,15N,13C] labeling, D2O-based M9 medium supplemented with (15NH4)Cl and D-(2H,13C)-glucose were used. For production of specific methyl-group labeled Tsa1, D2O-based M9 medium with D(2H, 12C)-glucose and (15NH4)Cl was used, and deuterated biosynthetic precursors (keto-acids, see below) with specific 13CH3 labeling were added to the culture 1 h prior to induction at OD280 around 0.5: for labeling of isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV) methyl groups, 85 mg/L of \u03b1-ketoisovalerate-(3-methyl-13C),4-13C, 3-d and 50 mg/L of [2H], 3,3-[13CH3]-ketobutyrate were added to the medium resulting in [U\u22122H,15N, Ile-\u03b4 1-13CH3, Leu/Val-13CH3] labeled Tsa1 and Tsa1S78D.56 The stereospecific labeling of valine methyl groups only was achieved by adding 85 mg/L of \u03b1ketoisovalerate-(3-methyl-13C),4-13C, 3-d and 40 mg/L of L-leucined10, to produce [U\u22122H,15N, Val-13CH3] labeled Tsa1S78D sample.57 All stable isotopes were purchased from Merck.\nSolution NMR Spectroscopy. NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance III HD 700 or 800 MHz spectrometer, using Topspin 3.5 software and equipped with either TCI or TXO cryogenically cooled triple resonance probes. All experiments were performed either in 50 mM KPi, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4 buffer or PBS pH 7.4 at the indicated temperatures. For the sequence specific backbone resonance assignments of [U\u22122H,15N,13C] Tsa1S78D the following TROSY-type experiments were recorded at 37 \u00b0C: 2D [15N, 1H]-TROSY,23 3D trHNCO, 3D trHNCA, 3D trHNCACB, 3D trHNCOCACB.58 Complementary sequence specific backbone and side-chain assignments of [U\u221215N, 13C ] Tsa1S78D were recorded: BEST-type triple resonance experiments 3D BT-HNCA+, 3D BTHNCO,59 BT-HNCACB+,59,60 and CBCA(CO)NH.61 Aliphatic sidechain resonance assignment for [U\u221215N, 13C] Tsa1S78D was performed based on 2D 1H\u221213C HMQC spectra with/without the constant time version, as well as 3D HBHA(CO)NH, and HCCH-\nTOCSY-experiments.61 To confirm methyl group assignments on ILV-samples 3D 13C methyl-SOFAST-NOESY experiments62,63 with mixing times of 50 and 600 ms as well as a 3D HMBC-HMQC spectrum64 were measured in 99.8% D2O-based NMR buffer. For quantitative analysis of signal intensities, the amplitudes were corrected by differences in the 1H-90\u00b0 pulse length, the number of scans, and the dilution factor.65 Further, a weighting function with weights 1\u22122\u22121 for residues (i\u22121)\u2212i\u2212(i+1) was applied to the raw data.66 NMR data were processed with a combination of NMRPipe67 and mddNMR2.6,68 and analyzed using CARA.69 Secondary chemical shifts were calculated relative to the random coil values calculated by the POTENCI program.70 Methyl group assignment was performed using the MAGIC algorithm71 and confirmed by a combination of manual analysis of the side-chain TOCSY, HMBC-HMQC, and NOESY data sets. This approach yielded the following degree of assignment (\u223c92%): Ile \u03b41 (13/13), Leu \u03b41, \u03b42 (30/34), and Val \u03b31, \u03b32 (34/36).\nTranslational diffusion coefficients were measured by recording a series of 1D 13C-edited DOSY spectra at different temperatures ranging from 25 to 60 \u00b0C, using a pulse scheme (13C -edited BPPLED72) that is similar to a 15N-edited BPP-LED experiment with 15N and 13C pulses interchanged.73 The gradient duration \u03b4 was adapted to 3.2 ms instead of 4.8 ms used in the 15N-filtered version, and a diffusion delay T of 400 ms and a \u03c4 of 0.1 ms were used. The strength of the encoding/decoding was increased stepwise. The resulting 1H signal was integrated over the methyl 1H frequency range to obtain intensities as a function of encoding/decoding gradient strength. In addition, 1D 1H diffusion experiment (DOSY) with 13C filter and decoupling were recorded at the same temperatures. To adjust for the temperature-dependent changes in viscosity of the buffer, the obtained translational diffusion coefficient was adjusted on the basis of temperature-dependent viscosity values for D2O-based buffers over the used temperature range.74 DOSY data were compared to previously reported data to obtain a quantitative benchmark,75\u221277 as described in Figure S16. Structure-based diffusion coefficients (Figure S16) were obtained with HYDROPRO.78\nMagic-Angle Spinning NMR Sample Preparation. 2.5 mg of [U\u22122H,15N,13C] Tsa1WT protein sample in 50 mM KPi, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.4 buffer were thawed at room temperature and sedimented into a 1.3 mm rotor using ultracentrifugation at 50,000g overnight at 6 \u00b0C, using an in-house-built device for ultracentrifuges.\nMagic-Angle Spinning NMR Spectroscopy. MAS NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance-III spectrometer at a 1H Larmor frequency of 600 MHz, equipped with a 1.3 mm probe tuned to 1H, 13C, 15N, and 2H frequencies. Sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of [U\u22122H,15N,13C] Tsa1WT have been recorded at ca. 25 \u00b0C effective sample temperature at 55 kHz magic angle spinning (MAS) by the following 1H detection experiments: 2D hNH, 3D hCONH, 3D hCOcaNH, 3D hCANH, 3D hCAcoNH. 3D hCACBcoNH, 3D hCACBcacoNH, 3D hcaCBCAcoNH, 4D hCACONH, 4D hCOCANH and 4D hCACBcaNH and 3D hNcocaNH and 3D hNcacoNH experiments. The experiments use cross-polarization (CP) transfer steps for all heteronuclear transfers; for CA-CO transfer a BSH\u2212CP was used;79 CA-CB out-and-back transfers used 6.5 ms-long INEPT transfers. All experiments were used as implemented in the NMRlib library.80 In 3D experiments the 15N dimension was sampled up to a 16.4 ms evolution time (40 ppm spectral width; 80 points). In the hCANH experiment, the CA dimension was sampled to 6.6 ms (40 ppm; 80 points; 24 scans per increment); in the hCONH experiment, the CO dimension was sampled to 12.3 ms (15 ppm; 56 points; 40 scans); in the hcaCBcaNH experiment, the CB dimension was sampled to 6.8 ms (70 ppm; 144 points) and in the hcaCBcacoNH experiment to 6.0 ms (70 ppm; 128 points; 24 scans); in the 3D N\u2212N\u2212H experiments the two N dimensions were both sampled to 14.8 ms (hNcocaNH; 40 ppm; 72 points; 48 scans) or 15.2 ms (hNcacoNH; 40 ppm; 74 points; 80 scans). The acquisition parameters for the 4D experiments were set as follows. 4D hCACONH: CO (7.1 ms; 13 ppm; 28 points); N (12.3 ms; 36 ppm; 54 points); CA (5.1 ms; 40 ppm; 62 points). hCOCANH: CA (5.2 ms; 38 ppm; 60 points); N (13.2 ms;\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c01200 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 10700\u221210711\n10707\n36 ppm; 58 points); CO (7.1 ms; 13 ppm; 28 points). hcaCBCANH: CA (4.0 ms; 30 ppm; 36 points); N (9.1 ms; 36 ppm; 40 points); CB (3.4 ms; 70 ppm; 72 points). The number of scans per increment was 8 in the three 4Ds, and the grids were uniformly sampled; nonuniform sampling could have been used to reduce acquisition time, at some expense of sensitivity. The use of high-dimensional assignment experiments has been demonstrated by several groups.81\u221285 The 4D data have been very valuable for the assignment to discriminate different assignment possibilities of the 3D-based assignment strategy. The NMR data were processed with NMRPipe67 and subsequently analyzed with CcpNmr Analysis 3.0.1.86\nNMR Backbone and Side Chain Dynamics. For the analysis of the dynamic properties of Tsa1S78D, the following relaxation experiments were measured: R1(15N), 87 15N(1H)-NOE (hetNOE),87 R1\u03c1(15N), 88 and TROSY for rotational correlation times (TRACT).89 Nonlinear least-squares fits of relaxation data were done with NMRFAM-Sparky 1.47.90 Side-chain dynamics experiments were performed on a [U\u22122H, 15N, Ile-\u03b41-13CH3, Leu-, Val-13CH3] labeled Tsa1S78D sample at 37 \u00b0C in 99.9% D2O based NMR buffer. Side chain methyl order parameters (S2) were determined by a relaxationviolated coherence-transfer triple-quantum experiment.91 The buildup of triple-quantum (3Q) coherence was monitored in a series of 1H\u221213C experiments at different delay times (13 values from 1 to 35 ms). The decay of single-quantum (SQ) coherence was followed in a set of reference experiments at the same delays. Ratios of the peak intensities of these two sets of experiments were fitted to obtain sitespecific order parameter S2 using the separately determined (TRACTapproach) overall correlation time \u03c4c in 100% D2O of 27 ns.\nFor the analysis of the dynamic properties of Tsa1WT, 15N-R1 and 15N-R1\u03c1 relaxation experiments were measured by MAS NMR on the [U\u22122H,15N,13C] Tsa1WT sample. The experiments were based on hNH 2D experiments with CP transfer.40 15N-R1 was measured at a MAS frequency of 55 kHz, and relaxation delays of 0.1 to 15 s. A series of 15N-R1\u03c1 experiments were collected at delay times ranging from 1 to 200 ms at 15N spin-lock radio frequency field strengths from 2.3 to 15 kHz, resulting in a Bloch\u2212McConnell-type relaxationdispersion experiment.35 This approach monitors microsecond\u2212 millisecond dynamics by the chemical-shift fluctuations. NEarRotary-Resonance relaxation Dispersion (NERRD) 15N-R1\u03c1 experiments were recorded at a MAS frequency of 45 kHz, which allows approaching the rotary-resonance condition (spin-lock RF field equals MAS frequency) without requiring extensively high RF fields. A series of 2D spectra with spin-lock durations ranging from 1 to 50 ms was recorded at RF field strengths from 10 to 41 kHz. This experiment detects \u03bcs\u2212ms motion involving bond reorientation.35,36 All experiments are implemented in NMRlib.80\nThe analysis of the NERRD data was performed using the pyDIFRATE program, a python-based tool for detectors analysis (github.com/alsinmr/pyDR).45 We used either three or four detectors, both of which give similar results (see Figure 3).\nGiven the large NERRD effects for almost all residues, which extends to even below 10 kHz, the analysis of Bloch\u2212McConnell relaxation-dispersion (BMRD) data involved a correction for the NERRD effect, as outlined in Figure S13. In brief, the detector parameters were used to back-calculate R1\u03c1 rate constants at all RF fields used in the BMRD experiment, and subtracted from the experimental rate constants. These rate constants are close to zero. Analysis of the nonflat profiles (shown in Figure 4) was done with the program relax,92 used on the NMRbox server.93 As the program cannot handle negative relaxation rate constants, which result from the above-described subtraction procedure, a constant value (5 s\u22121) was added to all data. This plateau value is of no influence for the data analysis, because in the fit procedure the plateau value is fitted and generally not interpreted.\nPreparation of Reduced Tsa1 Samples. In order to obtain a reduced sample, 2.1 mg of [U\u22122H,15N,13C] Tsa1WT were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min with 5 mM DTT. The protein solution was quickly centrifuged at 10,000g in a benchtop centrifuge to pellet down eventual aggregates. Protein supernatant was sedimented into a 1.3 mm rotor overnight by ultracentrifugation at 50,000g, 6 \u00b0C. The\nprotein sample showed stability in a reduced state for several weeks, as evidenced by 2D hNH MAS NMR experiments.\nSize-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Light Scattering. SEC-MALS experiments were performed using a Superdex Increase 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) on an Agilent 1260 HPLC Infinity II in phosphate buffer (PBS or 50 mM KPi KCl pH 7.4) at RT (ca. 297 K). Protein elution was monitored by three detectors in series namely, an Agilent multiwavelength absorbance detector (absorbance at 280 and 254 nm), a Wyatt miniDAWN TREOS multiangle light scattering (MALS) detector, and a Wyatt Optilab rEX differential refractive index (dRI) detector. The column was pre-equilibrated overnight in running buffer to obtain stable baseline signals from the detectors before data collection. Molar mass, elution concentration, and mass distributions of the samples were calculated using the ASTRA 7.1.3 software (Wyatt Technology). A BSA solution (2\u22124 mg/mL), purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and directly used without further purification, was used to calibrate interdetector delay volumes, band broadening corrections, and lightscattering detector normalization using standard protocols within ASTRA 7.1.3.\n\u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT"
