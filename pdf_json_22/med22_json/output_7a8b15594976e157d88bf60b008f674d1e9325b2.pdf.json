    "abstractText": "The exact pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains largely unknown. While current management strategies are effective at stabilizing the disease or relief the symptoms, new approaches are required to target underlying disease process and reverse lung function deterioration. Recent research showed that pneumonia bacteria is critical in disease progression and gut microbiome is likely perturbed in COPD, which is usually accompanied by a decreased intestinal microbial diversity and a disturbance in immune system, contributing to a chronic inflammation. The cross-talk between gut microbes and lungs, termed as the \u201cgut-lung axis,\u201d is known to impact immune response and homeostasis in the airway. Although the gut and respiratory microbiota exhibit compositional differences, the gut and lung showed similarities in the origin of epithelia of both gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the anatomical structure, and early-life microbial colonization. Evidence showed that respiratory infection might be prevented, or at least dampened by regulating gut microbial ecosystem; thus, a promising yet understudied area of COPD management is nutrition-based preventive strategies. COPD patient is often deficient in nutrient such as antioxidant, vitamins, and fiber intake. However, further larger-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are required to establish the role of these nutrition-based diet in COPD management. In this review, we highlight the important and complex interaction of microbiota and immune response on gut-lung axis. Further research into the modification and improvement of the gut microbiota and new interventions through diet, probiotics, vitamins, and fecal microbiota transplantation is extreme critical to provide new preventive therapies for COPD.",

While current management strategies are effective at stabilizing the disease or relief the symptoms, new approaches are required to target underlying disease process and reverse lung function deterioration. Recent research showed that pneumonia bacteria is critical in disease progression and gut microbiome is likely perturbed in COPD, which is usually accompanied by a decreased intestinal microbial diversity and a disturbance in immune system, contributing to a chronic inflammation. The cross-talk between gut microbes and lungs, termed as the \u201cgut-lung axis,\u201d is known to impact immune response and homeostasis in the airway. Although the gut and respiratory microbiota exhibit compositional differences, the gut and lung showed similarities in the origin of epithelia of both gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the anatomical structure, and early-life microbial colonization. Evidence showed that respiratory infection might be\u00a0prevented, or at least dampened by regulating gut microbial ecosystem; thus, a promising yet understudied area of COPD management is nutrition-based preventive strategies. COPD patient is often deficient in nutrient such as antioxidant, vitamins, and fiber intake. However, further larger-scale randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are required to establish the role of these nutrition-based diet in COPD management. In this review, we\u00a0highlight the important and complex interaction of microbiota and immune response on gut-lung axis. Further research into the modification and improvement of the gut microbiota and new interventions through diet, probiotics, vitamins, and fecal microbiota transplantation is extreme critical to provide new preventive therapies for COPD.\nKeywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, gut-lung axis, microbiota, nutrition\nINTRODUCTION\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which affects over 400 million people globally, is characterized by increasing breathlessness, chronic cough, and sputum production that are associated with irreversible progressive inflammatory condition and major lung destruction with airflow limitation (Raherison and Girodet, 2009). The classification of\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 868086\nseverity of COPD includes four stages based on spirometry and the degree of worsening airflow limitation from stage I\u00a0to IV (Wedzicha and Seemungal, 2007; Vestbo et\u00a0al., 2013). The mechanism of the occurrence and development remains largely unknown (Agusti et\u00a0 al., 2020). Evidence showed that COPD is a polygenic disorder with the involvement of epigenetic components. There are multiple environmental risk factors such as cigarette smoking, bacteria/virus infection, and environmental pollutant exposure that could affects a range of potential lung function trajectories through life. Although there is no cure for COPD, early diagnosis and treatment from a multidisciplinary approach is critical for preventing or slowing the progression of COPD and reducing mortality (Criner et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nGrowing evidence revealed that dysbiosis of gut microbiota is considered as an important component in the pathophysiology of COPD (Chotirmall et\u00a0 al., 2017; Shukla et\u00a0 al., 2017; Chunxi et\u00a0 al., 2020). The gut and lungs are anatomically distinct, but both are originated from endosome and abundant bacterial communities (Mjosberg and Rao, 2018). A balanced microbial community in both gut and lungs is important in regulating immune function and overall health of the host. Disturbance in gut microbiota is shown to impact multiple distant organs including the lung. The cross-talk between gut microbes and lung microbes is termed as the \u201cgut-lung axis.\u201d This axis facilitates the passage of endotoxins, microbial metabolites, cytokines, and hormones into the bloodstream connecting the gut and lung. The composition of pneumonia bacteria can be\u00a0 altered by changes in intestinal microbiota and vice versa (Mateer et\u00a0 al., 2015, 2018; Budden et\u00a0 al., 2017, 2019). The gut-lung axis concept postulated that disturbance in gut microbiota may have a profound effect on lung disease (Al Bander et\u00a0 al., 2020). Thus, the bacteria in the intestinal tract can exert either good or bad impact on the lung health (see\nFigure\u00a0 1).\nEvidence from the gut-lung axis research on respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and respiratory infections suggested that respiratory diseases might be\u00a0 prevented or at least can be\u00a0 ameliorated by regulating gut microbial ecosystem through manipulation of gut microbiota (Zhang D. et\u00a0 al., 2020). Interventions including antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and natural products or diet have shown positive outcomes on balancing gut microbiota and enhancing immune response, but the underlying mechanisms of these therapeutic approaches remain unclear (Zhang D. et\u00a0 al., 2020). COPD patient is often deficient in nutrient such as antioxidant, vitamins, and fiber intake. Nutrition-based preventive strategies might be\u00a0 a promising new interventional strategy for COPD management, especially in a long-term setting (Schols et\u00a0 al., 2014). In addition, further larger-scaled RCTs are required to establish the role of these nutrition-based diet in the management of COPD patients. In this review, we\u00a0 evaluate the role of the gut-lung axis in disease progression and update recent research on the treatment of COPD via the gut-lung axis. This review highlights the necessity to develop non-drug interventions as effective adjunctive treatment for COPD."

The gut microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract that in a health individual comprises 150 distinct bacterial species, mainly Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (Qin et\u00a0 al., 2010). Besides, fungi have been identified as an integral part of commensal flora, and the diversity of the gut microbiota in healthy subjects is limited to few genera, with a high prevalence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Malassezia restricta, and Candida albicans (Nash et\u00a0 al., 2017). Fungi are 100 to 1,000 times larger than bacteria, but less frequent than bacteria sequences. Fungi may compensate the bacterial functions of immune modulation and protect mucosal tissue damage at the physiological state and during gut microbiota disturbances (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2017). In addition, bacteria can affect the function of fungi (Tso et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nWhile the lung and gut originate from the same embryonic organ in the primitive foregut, the microbiota of lung and gut differ significantly in taxonomic composition, diversity, and function (Girosi et\u00a0al., 2006). The lung microbiota is composed of transient microorganisms mainly derived from upper respiratory tract (URT) including nostrils, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. While Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the most abundant bacterial phyla in both microbiotas, the lung and gut microbiota are very different at the species level. In the lungs, the genera Streptococcus spp., Veillonella spp., and Prevotella were abundant, whereas Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium are more prevalent in the gut (Sender et\u00a0 al., 2016). In a disease or dysbiotic state, other organisms such as viruses or fungi are present in the lung (Limon et\u00a0 al., 2017)."

            "text": "Lung microbiota plays key roles in the development and progression of COPD. The disease is associated with dysbiosis of the lung microbiota with the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, resulting in accelerated decline in lung function. Studies on the lung microbiota of COPD showed reduced lung microbial community diversity compared with those of healthy individuals, with an expansion of Hemophilus spp. Afipia, Brevundimonas, Curvibacter, Moraxella, Neisseria, and Undibacterium spp. of the Proteobacteria phylum, Corynebacterium spp. of the Actinobacteria phylum, Capnocytophaga spp. of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and Leptolyngbya spp. of the Cyanobacteria phylum (Erb-Downward et\u00a0 al., 2011; Garcia-Nunez et\u00a0 al., 2014; Huang et\u00a0 al., 2014; Millares et\u00a0al., 2014; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, the severity of COPD is associated with less diverse lung microbiota and an expansion of pathogenic microbes (Garcia-Nunez et\u00a0al., 2014;\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 868086\nWang et\u00a0 al., 2016; Mayhew et\u00a0 al., 2018; Wang Z. et\u00a0 al., 2018). The culture of bronchial secretion from the lower airway of stable COPD patients showed bacteria such as H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In contrast, the exacerbated COPD patients present an unstable lung microbiota with an increased relative abundance of Moraxella spp. of the Proteobacteria, but a decreased abundance of the Firmicutes (Rosell et\u00a0al., 2005; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016; Sun et\u00a0al., 2020). Notably, increased Proteobacteria: Firmicutes ratio suggested that the cause of exacerbation is due to bacterial dysbiosis, whereas eosinophilic exacerbation exhibits a decrease in Proteobacteria: Firmicutes ratio (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2016). Disturbance in core lung microbiota during acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) leads to the outgrowth of pathogen including Acinetobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp., indicating that commensal lung microbiota protects the lung from colonization of pathogenic microbes (Sun et\u00a0al., 2020). Reduced microbial diversity in COPD showed negative correlation with CXCL8, indicating that reduced species diversity might be\u00a0 associated with clearance by neutrophil extracellular traps through invading host epithelial cells. Furthermore, mannose binding lectin (MBL) was shown to interferes with phagocytosis of H. influenza. Study by Dicker et\u00a0 al. (2018) showed that COPD patients with MBL deficiency have a more diverse lung microbiota and a lower risk of exacerbation. Additionally, viral infections such as rhinoviruses and influenza virus are detected in around 10%\u201315% of sputum sample from stable COPD patients in comparison with 30%\u201360% in severe COPD patients (Mallia et\u00a0 al., 2011; Utokaparch et\u00a0 al., 2014; Tan et\u00a0 al., 2016). Moreover, the mycobiome in the lung microbiota showed an increased relative abundance of Candida spp., Aspergillus, Candid, Phialosimplex, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Eutypella in the lung of COPD patients (Charlson et\u00a0 al., 2012; Su et\u00a0 al., 2015). Thus, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections may lead to exacerbated airway and systemic inflammation (Sethi and Murphy, 2008). The Interaction Between Gut and Lung Microbiota in COPD The research on gut-lung axis in respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and respiratory infections suggested that these diseases might be\u00a0 prevented, or at least ameliorated by regulating gut microbial ecosystem through manipulation of gut microbiota (Zhang D. et\u00a0 al., 2020). The intestinal and respiratory microbiota may affect each other by changing mucosal immunity. On one hand, mice lacking an intestinal microbiota through antibiotic treatment are more susceptible to pneumonia and the alveolar macrophages showed an altered transcriptome which results in decreased phagocytic activity and bacterial clearance (Chen et\u00a0al., 2011; Schuijt et\u00a0al., 2016). On the other hand, bacterial and viral respiratory infections in mice lungs lead to gut dysbiosis (Sze et\u00a0 al., 2014; Samuelson et\u00a0 al., 2016). The murine model of sepsis suggested that dysbiosis in gut microbiota influenced composition of the respiratory microbiota through changes in circulating inflammatory cytokines and translocation of intestinal microbiota to the airway (Gauguet et\u00a0 al., 2015).\nFIGURE\u00a01 | The proposed mechanisms of gut-lung axis involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The gut-lung axis concept postulated that disturbance in gut microbiota may have a profound effect on lung disease. The microbiota in gut and lung is closely linked to each other. The microbiota in both organs can be\u00a0influenced by chronic lung infections, smoking, malnutrition, drugs, and asthma. COPD is highly associated with the dysbiosis in the gut and lung, which can be\u00a0induced by epigenetic changes or regulated via NLRP3 inflammasome. In COPD, disturbance in gut-lung axis leads to decreased microbiota diversity, altered microbiota composition, disturbance in metabolites, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and dysfunctional immune response, resulting in poor clearance of infection in the lung or gastrointestinal symptoms or diseases. NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing protein; ncRNA, non-coding RNA; and SCFAs, short-chain fatty acids.\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 868086\nClinical data have been available for COPD. The first study that showed increased gastrointestinal (GI) permeability in AECOPD (Sprooten et\u00a0 al., 2018) suggested the involvement of the gut microbiota in exacerbation of COPD. Mucosal epithelial integrity is critical for preventing the entry of harmful particles (e.g., bacteria and their product) into the systemic circulation. Disturbed intestinal integrity may contribute to increased permeability of the intestinal mucosal barrier, resulting in bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation (Turner, 2009). The changes in gut microbiota for COPD have also been observed. For instance, by using untargeted fecal metagenomics and metabolomics, a recent study reported that composition of intestinal microbiota and metabolome in COPD patient was significantly different from those of healthy controls, with an increased abundance of several Streptococcus parasanguinis_B in COPD (Bowerman et\u00a0 al., 2020). In an earlier study of AECOPD, it identified increased abundance of both Streptococcus parasanguinis_B and Streptococcus salivarius in fecal microbiome, while only Streptococcus parasanguinis_B was observed increased in sputum (Chan et\u00a0al., 2015). Furthermore, in a study comparing both gut and lung microbiota in samples collected from 15 AECOPD patients over a 14-day period of antibiotic and steroid treatment, it only observed difference in abundance of certain phyla but not in diversity of core flora between these two sample types (Sun et\u00a0al., 2020). These studies together suggested a potential cross-talk in the gut-lung axis that may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of COPD, but the mechanisms how the axis regulates microbiota remain unknown."

Although 15%\u201320% smokers develop COPD in the United\u00a0 States, approximately 80% COPD patients being past or current smokers (Warren et\u00a0 al., 2014). Smoking is also associated with high mortality rate of COPD (Warren et\u00a0al., 2014). Although the bacterial communities in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from smokers with COPD were similar to those from healthy smokers and non-smokers, the lung tissues of smokers with COPD showed the heterogeneity and diversity in the lung microbiota at different regions of abnormal lung (Erb-Downward et\u00a0al., 2011), suggesting that long-term smoking may contribute to the development and exacerbation of COPD. In addition, tobacco smoke has been previously associated with infections of pathogenic microorganisms in the lungs, as well as persistent colonization of opportunistic pathogens in lower respiratory tract, which all in turn lead to exacerbation and progression of COPD (Bagaitkar et\u00a0 al., 2008; Garmendia et\u00a0 al., 2012). Pathophysiologically, this may be\u00a0established by modification of ciliary movements, damage of tight junctions that increases epithelial permeability, and elevation of neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells along the airways of COPD patients\n(Garmendia et\u00a0 al., 2012). Notably, exposure to smoke may also modify relative abundance of microbiota of the lungs, as indicated by animal studies (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2018). Cigarette smoking has been shown to reduce the diversity of microbes in the gut (Faith et\u00a0 al., 2013). However, such smoking-related diversity of gut microbiota has not been compared between COPD patients and healthy smokers."

Around 20% COPD patients have weight loss and malnutrition in protein and calorie, which have negative impact on mortality (Hillas et\u00a0 al., 2015). A 5-year follow-up study showed that individuals that consume less fiber, vitamin, and folic acid are prone to develop airflow limitation and COPD (Jung et\u00a0al., 2021). The gut microbiome produces a large number of metabolites, e.g., short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), through fermentation of fiber. SCFAs are potent anti-inflammatory molecules which reduced chemotaxis and adherence in immune cells while increasing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inducing apoptosis (Ratajczak et\u00a0 al., 2019). SCFAs are absorbed into the systemic circulation and can influence lung health. Trompette et\u00a0 al. (2014) showed that dietary fiber leads to altered composition of gut and lung microbiota, and mice with prolonged high-fiber feeding are protected against the allergic inflammation in the lung. A lack of fermentable fibers can lead to malnourishment of the microbiota, resulting in gut dysbiosis and affect lung physiology (Makki et\u00a0al., 2018; Vaughan et\u00a0al., 2019)."

The metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from patient with asthma demonstrated a decreased diversity in the gut microbiota compared to a healthy cohort (Wang Q. et\u00a0 al., 2018). In addition, the antibiotics and steroid treatments for COPD seem to have differential effects on lung and gut microbiota (Sun et\u00a0 al., 2020). After treatments with antibiotics and steroid, the abundance and diversity of sputum bacterial flora decreased initially and returned to normal on day 14, whereas the abundance of gut bacteria increased throughout the 14 days post-treatment without affecting diversity of gut microbiota. Of note, these COPD patients have a history of frequent antibiotic use; therefore, the prolonged antibiotic pressure has caused a long-term disturbance in the microbiota with a shift toward bacterial community resistant to antibiotics."

The NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells and regulates immune response in the gastrointestinal tract and the lung (Donovan et\u00a0 al., 2020). Most bacterial infections in the gut could be\u00a0 cleared via gut immunity response. However, for those that escape from the clearance, some has been reported to transfer to circulation and travel to the lung, which results in activation of inflammation. The gut and lung microbiota can influence the function of NLRP3 inflammasome (Donovan et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, inflammasomes may also be\u00a0activated by interactions between bacteria and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with alterations of inflammasome responses presented in different severities of COPD (Donovan et\u00a0 al., 2020). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome mediates caspase-1 activation and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b/IL-18. This process was shown to link to the development of airway inflammation in COPD (Wang H. et\u00a0al., 2018). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchial tissues, the mRNA levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, apoptosis-associated spec-like protein containing CARD (ASC), IL-18, and IL-1b were elevated in AECOPD comparing with smokers; however, the mRNA levels of these gene were decreased in COPD patients in stable stage (Wang H. et\u00a0 al., 2018), suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasome is associated with AECOPD.\nSome RCTs have shown that targeting inflammasome-related effectors (i.e., IL-1a and IL-1b) failed to benefit COPD patients at moderate to severe stages. For instance, a 45-week monthly treatment on COPD patients via intravenously infusing canakinumab, a human anti-IL-1b monoclonal antibody, did not show statistical difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) between treatment and placebo groups (Rogliani et\u00a0 al., 2015). Furthermore, MEDI8968, a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against IL-1 receptor 1, did not show any beneficial effects on lung function or quality of life of AECOPD patients within 52 weeks of treatment (Calverley et\u00a0al., 2017). Similar results were obtained for MEDI2338, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds IL-18, and AZD9056, a P2X7 antagonist that binds human P2X7 receptor. However, some of these RCTs failed to assess the impact of these drugs on disease pathogenesis due to the lack of adequate endpoints; thus, further larger-scaled welldesigned studies are required to draw a conclusion for these inflammasome-related effectors.\nImmunoproteasome is a specialized type of proteasome required for intracellular protein degradation in immune cells. It also acts as a key regulator for immune cell differentiation, inflammatory activation, and autoimmunity. A recent study demonstrated that proteasome expression was upregulated in PBMCs isolated from severe COPD patients as compared to that from matching controls (Kammerl et\u00a0 al., 2021). The distinct activation of proteasome was observed in PBMCs of young male smokers and severe COPD individuals. The same study also showed that inhibiting immunoproteasome reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression in COPD-derived immune cells (Kammerl et\u00a0al., 2021), suggesting\nthat targeting immunoproteasome may be\u00a0 a potential treatment for severe COPD."

            "text": "Epigenetic modifications have also been identified to participate in altering composition of gut microbiota and in the development of COPD (Zhang L. et\u00a0 al., 2020). However, the exact role of these epigenetic modifications in regulating gut and lung microbiota of COPD remains largely unclear. Firstly, DNA methylation is widely used in the study of epigenetic dysregulation in smokers with or without COPD. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are enzymes catalyzing the addition of a methyl (CH3) group to the DNA strands to regulate gene expression. DNMTs are highly sensitive to the availability of nutrients, and they are affected by metabolites produced by gut microbial species (Ansari et\u00a0 al., 2020). DNA methylation is associated with gene expression profile in COPD lung tissues (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2017), however, whether such an epigenetic modification alters COPDrelated gut and lung microbiota remains to be\u00a0further elucidated. Secondly, COPD patients have a reduced level of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) compared with non-smokers (Barnes, 2009), which may results in expansion of inflammation. Other HDACs such as HDAC5, HDAC8, and SIRT1 are all decreased in COPD (Ito et\u00a0 al., 2005; Rajendrasozhan et\u00a0 al., 2008). It is known that gut microbiome can modulate the activity of HDACs by producing SCFAs (Yuille et\u00a0 al., 2018). Therefore, targeting HDAC complex may be\u00a0 a potential therapy for COPD (Zwinderman et\u00a0 al., 2019). Thirdly, increased evidence have shown that gut microbiome plays a key role in regulating microRNAs (miRNAs; Malmuthuge and Guan, 2021), whereas miRNAs are capable of suppressing or preventing COPD development (Zhang L. et\u00a0al., 2020). Based on profiling analysis, approximately 140 miRNAs are dysregulated in COPD compared to healthy controls, whereas around 70 miRNAs are differentially expressed in COPD compared to smokers (Leidinger et\u00a0al., 2011; Osei et\u00a0 al., 2015). Clinical data have shown that these miRNA targets were enriched in genes associated with cytokine production (Faiz et\u00a0 al., 2019; Hobbs and Tantisira, 2019). However, the profiling of miRNA has not been compared between lung and gut in COPD. Future studies are required to understand the immune-modulatory role of miRNA in the gut and lung axis.\nEpigenetic modifications can be\u00a0 regulated by metabolites of gut microbiota including SCFAs, folates, biotin, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Increased circulating TMAO level was associated with increased mortality of COPD patients, which was independent of disease severity (Ottiger et\u00a0al., 2018). However, the role of epigenetic modifications on the mechanisms of regulating TMAO levels is still unclear. There are several therapeutic strategies developed to lower TMAO levels to treat atherosclerosis, but with potential side effects (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2019). Whether these therapeutic strategies targeting TMAO levels can be\u00a0 used for COPD should be\u00a0 addressed in future studies. Despite TMAO, the study by Bowerman et\u00a0 al. (2020) also identified a list of metabolites from lipid, amino acids, or xenobiotic classes that are associated with COPD, suggesting these metabolites can be\u00a0used as biomarkers for COPD diagnosis in the future studies.\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 868086"

A direct association between Western diet and increased risk for COPD has been shown in both genders (Varraso et\u00a0 al., 2015; Mekary, 2016; Young and Hopkins, 2018), indicating that diet is strongly associated with the risk of COPD. For consumptions of specific type of food, several studies have shown that total and cereal dietary fiber are inversely associated with COPD incidence, whereas results of fruits and vegetables are inconsistent (Varraso et\u00a0 al., 2010; Kaluza et\u00a0 al., 2018; Szmidt et\u00a0 al., 2020). Therefore, nutrition-based treatment, particularly high dietary fiber intake, may be\u00a0a potential non-pharmaceutical approach for managing or preventing COPD."

Hence, the probiotic treatment yielded positive outcomes in COPD mice, suggesting its potential therapeutic value for the disease, which needs to be\u00a0 testified in large-scaled RCTs for clinical use."

Dysbiosis in the gut can be\u00a0 modified through fecal transplantation in the cigarette-smoking-based model, indicating that gut microbiota may play a causal role on COPD pathogenesis (Lai et\u00a0 al., 2021). In particular, Parabacteriodies goldsteinii (P. goldsteinii) was shown to reduce intestinal inflammation, enhance mitochondrial functions, ribosomal activities in colon, restore amino acids metabolism in sera, and inhibit lung infection, at least partially through inhibiting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway via the lipopolysaccharide derived from P. goldsteinii (Lai et\u00a0 al., 2021). Thus, this bacterial strain or its derived lipopolysaccharide could be\u00a0 used as a new therapeutical agent for COPD. At present, no fecal transplantation studies have been conducted in COPD patients, hence, whether this approach is effective for COPD awaits further clinical investigations."

            "text": "COPD is a common but poorly recognized disease worldwide (Agusti et\u00a0al., 2020). Current management strategies for COPD have focused on alleviating symptoms and preventing exacerbation. However, new interventions are required to improve predictiveness, preventiveness, and personalization. While recent research highlights the significance of the gut-lung\naxis in COPD, there is still limited laboratory data for its related mechanism and clinical data for its practical use. We\u00a0 need to put more efforts to clarify how gut microbiota is affected in COPD and how gut dysbiosis can be\u00a0 modified to treat the disease. In addition to exploring the change in diversity and relative abundance of gut microbiota, we\u00a0should also concentrate on investigating the underlying mechanisms to better understand whether a particular interventional approach exerts beneficial and protective effects on diseased individuals and how it works. For instance, the modulation of innate immunity and systemic inflammation (as indicated by specific inflammatory markers), maintenance of epithelial integrity from microbial invasion, and stimulation of beneficial bacteria that generate specific metabolites [e.g., small chain fatty acids (SCFAs)]. Furthermore, multicenter analysis could be\u00a0 considered as different demographic backgrounds may contribute to the diversity of microbiota in the gut and lung. Lastly, longitudinal studies are crucial, as they may represent a change, particularly disease-related change of an individual, which may assist with revealing the role gut-lung axis played in COPD.\nIt is noteworthy that region of sampling may affect evaluating microbiota dysbiosis in the gut-lung axis. For instance, though considered sterile in the past, the lower respiratory tract has now been considered to host smaller amount of the microbiota. For gut microbiota, although fecal specimens are more commonly used due to easy accessibility, the colonized germs vary significantly in different regions of gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, sampling methods should be\u00a0 carefully determined in the design of future studies.\nSeveral risk factors, including smoking, diet, antibiotics, and steroid treatments, are involved in affecting the gut-lung axis. The cross-talk between the gut and the lung has been hypothesized to involve various pathways, probably via NLRP3 inflammasome, COPD-related epigenetic modification, immunological changes, and various microbiota-specific metabolites. However, the significance and mechanism of each factor in regulating the gut-lung axis remain unclear yet. In addition, previous studies have highlighted the potential use of metabolites, miRNAs, or miRNA targets to be\u00a0used as diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, further investigation will help to determine whether these are cost-effective ways for COPD diagnosis. The relatively successful modification by using antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics add evidence of the crucial part microbiota dysbiosis played in the gut-lung axis.\nGut dysbiosis in COPD may be\u00a0 a modifiable factor to be\u00a0 developed as a non-drug therapeutical strategy for the prevention and management of the disease, as studies of nutrient-based diet have shown positive results in reducing COPD risk. Meanwhile, probiotic supplementation and fecal transplantation have also shown positive outcomes in murine COPD models. More RCTs are required to investigate the effectiveness of these interventions on the prevention and treatment of COPD.\nIn summary, the gut-lung axis is highly associated with COPD and the gut and lung microbiota can influence lung immunity and health. Modifying the gut microbiota could\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 868086\nbe\u00a0an effective strategy to treat or even prevent COPD. Further studies are required to understand the role of gut-lung axis in the pathogenies of COPD and lung health."
