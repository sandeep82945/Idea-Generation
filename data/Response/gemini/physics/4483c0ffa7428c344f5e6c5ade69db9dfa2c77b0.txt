1. **Investigate the use of PEO-PCL copolymers for the delivery of gene therapy.** PEO-PCL copolymers have been shown to be effective in delivering small molecule drugs, but their potential for gene therapy has not been fully explored. Gene therapy is a promising new approach to treating a variety of diseases, but it is often limited by the difficulty of delivering genetic material to the target cells. PEO-PCL copolymers could potentially be used to overcome this challenge by providing a safe and effective way to deliver gene therapy vectors to cells.


2. **Develop PEO-PCL-based nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery to the brain.** The brain is a challenging target for drug delivery due to the blood-brain barrier, which prevents many drugs from entering the brain. PEO-PCL copolymers could potentially be used to overcome this challenge by developing nanocarriers that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs directly to the brain. This could lead to new treatments for a variety of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.


3. **Explore the use of PEO-PCL copolymers for the delivery of vaccines.** Vaccines are an important tool for preventing disease, but they can be difficult to deliver to the body. PEO-PCL copolymers could potentially be used to develop new vaccine delivery systems that are more effective and easier to administer. This could lead to new vaccines for a variety of diseases, including HIV/AIDS and malaria.


4. **Investigate the use of PEO-PCL copolymers for the delivery of proteins and peptides.** Proteins and peptides are important therapeutic agents, but they can be difficult to deliver to the body due to their large size and susceptibility to degradation. PEO-PCL copolymers could potentially be used to develop new protein and peptide delivery systems that are more effective and stable. This could lead to new treatments for a variety of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes.


5. **Develop PEO-PCL-based nanocarriers for theranostics.** Theranostics is a new field of medicine that combines therapy and diagnostics. PEO-PCL copolymers could potentially be used to develop theranostic nanocarriers that can both deliver drugs and image the target tissue. This could lead to new treatments for a variety of diseases that are more effective and less invasive.
