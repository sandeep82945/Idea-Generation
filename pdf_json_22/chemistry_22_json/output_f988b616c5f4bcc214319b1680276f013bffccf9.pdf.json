    "abstractText": "The genomes of many filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., include diverse biosynthetic gene clusters of unknown function. We previously showed that low copper levels upregulate a gene cluster that includes crmA, encoding a putative isocyanide synthase. Here we show, using untargeted comparative metabolomics, that CrmA generates a valine-derived isocyanide that contributes to two distinct biosynthetic pathways under copper-limiting conditions. Reaction of the isocyanide with an ergot alkaloid precursor results in carbon-carbon bond formation analogous to Strecker amino-acid synthesis, producing a group of alkaloids we term fumivalines. In addition, valine isocyanide contributes to biosynthesis of a family of acylated sugar alcohols, the fumicicolins, which are related to brassicicolin A, a known isocyanide from Alternaria brassicicola. CrmA homologs are found in a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, some of which produce fumicicolin and fumivaline. Extracts fromA. fumigatuswild type (but not crmA-deleted strains), grown under copper starvation, inhibit growth of diverse bacteria and fungi, and synthetic valine isocyanide shows antibacterial activity. CrmA thus contributes to two biosynthetic pathways downstream of trace-metal sensing.",

Gonz\u00e1lez6,9, B. Gillian Turgeon6, Nancy P. Keller 2,3 & Frank C. Schroeder 1\nThe genomes of many filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., include diverse biosynthetic gene clusters of unknown function. We previously showed that low copper levels upregulate a gene cluster that includes crmA, encoding a putative isocyanide synthase. Here we show, using untargeted comparative metabolomics, that CrmA generates a valine-derived isocyanide that contributes to two distinct biosynthetic pathways under copper-limiting conditions. Reaction of the isocyanide with an ergot alkaloid precursor results in carbon-carbon bond formation analogous to Strecker amino-acid synthesis, producing a group of alkaloids we term fumivalines. In addition, valine isocyanide contributes to biosynthesis of a family of acylated sugar alcohols, the fumicicolins, which are related to brassicicolin A, a known isocyanide from Alternaria brassicicola. CrmA homologs are found in a wide range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, some of which produce fumicicolin and fumivaline. Extracts fromA. fumigatuswild type (but not crmA-deleted strains), grown under copper starvation, inhibit growth of diverse bacteria and fungi, and synthetic valine isocyanide shows antibacterial activity. CrmA thus contributes to two biosynthetic pathways downstream of trace-metal sensing.\nThe Kingdom Fungi produces an enigmatic diversity of secondary metabolites derived from dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that encode the enzymes required to convert common primary metabolic building blocks into secondary metabolites. Genomic sequencing of 1000 s of fungi has revealed a vast space of BGCswith as yet undetermined function; however, their distribution among taxa is uneven: whereas yeasts contain few, if any, BGCs, some filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus spp. may have upwards of 70 BGCs/genome1. This tremendous expansion of BGCs in specific taxa remains an evolutionary enigma. Experimental evidence for functional roles of a few secondary metabolites (such as polyketide pigment protection of fungal spores from UV light2 or antibacterial properties of fungal secondary metabolites induced in fungal/bacterial culture2) supports the hypothesis that BGC-encoded metabolites are produced to address specific environmental constraints or challenges. We became intriguedwith the potential of fungal BGCs evolved to fit specific environmental niches upon our discovery of a new family of secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, the isocyanide synthases\nReceived: 2 June 2022\nAccepted: 29 July 2022\nCheck for updates\n1Boyce Thompson Institute andDepartment of Chemistry andChemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. 2Department ofMedicalMicrobiology and Immunology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. 3Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. 4Department of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. 5Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. 6Department of Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. 7Present address: Department of Molecular Microbiology, John Innes Centre, Norwich NR4 7UH, United Kingdom. 8Present address: Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. 9Present address: 104 Peckham Hall, Nazareth College, 4245 East Avenue, Rochester, NY, USA.\ne-mail: npkeller@wisc.edu; schroeder@cornell.edu\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4828 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n(ICSs), in the filamentous pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus3. Curiously we found thatone ICS-BGCwas regulatedbyMacA (also calledMac1), a copper fist transcription factor that functions to activate copper importers during copper starvation4. This BGC, termed the crm (copper responsive metabolite) BGC, was activated in defined media lacking the essential trace element copper in a MacA-dependent manner3. Copper homeostasis is carefully controlled in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as many biological processes require copper ions, yet too much copper is toxic.\nBecause loss of MacA and/or its importers greatly impair A. fumigatus growth in copper-limited conditions4,5, we wondered if the crm BGC was involved in fungal biology under low copper environments. We found that, under copper starvation conditions, CrmA converts Lvaline to (S)\u22122-isocyanoisovaleric acid, which is then used for two different biosynthetic pathways. The isocyanide, in an unusual chemical reaction, attaches to chanoclavine-1 aldehyde (an ergot alkaloid biosynthesis intermediate)6,7 to form a new family of alkaloid peptides named the fumivalines. The formation of the fumivalines involves a carbon-carbonbond-forming reaction that is analogous to awell-known synthetic reaction, the Strecker amino acid synthesis. Penicillium spp., which contains a homolog of the crm BGC as well as an intact ergot alkaloid pathway, also produce fumivaline, which is, as in A. fumigatus, induced by copper starvation. Alternatively, the valine-derived isocyanoisovaleric acid is employed for the synthesis of acylated D-mannitol derivatives that represent plausible intermediates toward the biosynthesis of brassicicolin A, an isocyanide previously identified from Alternaria brassicicola8. Another ascomycete, Cochliobolus heterostrophus, whose genome includes a crmA homolog but lacks the ergot alkaloid pathway, produces related acylated D-mannitol derivatives under copper starvation conditions, but lacks the fumivalines.\nHere we show that A. fumigatus employs an ICS to produce a reactive building block that is then integrated into two different secondary metabolite families via distinct chemical reactions, one of which provides the first example for Strecker-like amino acid biosynthesis in eukaryotes9. Copper starvation dependence of the identified metabolites and their antibacterial effects suggests that CrmAdependent pathways provide fungi with niche-specific weaponry to increase fitness under environmental stress."

            "text": "CrmA encodes a multidomain ICS-NRPS-like enzyme Comparative analyses of available fungal genomes revealed the multidomain ICS-NRPS-like gene crmA encoding adenylation, thiolation, and transferase domains, in addition to the isocyanide synthase domain (Fig. 1a)3. CrmA homologs are present primarily in three diverse ascomycete classes: Eurotiomycetes (e.g., Aspergillus, Penicillium, Talaromyces, Trichophyton spp.), Dothideomycetes (e.g., Cochliobolus, Leptosphaeria, Alternaria spp.) and Sordariomycetes (e.g., Verticillium, Metarhizium, Fusarium, Cordyceps, Beauveria, Trichoderma spp.) with the majority of genera consisting of pathogenic fungi. Variations in domain structure include the addition of a transporter domain found primarily in the Dothideomycetes, a clade that contains common leaf blight/spot fungal pathogens (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data 1). In A. fumigatus, CrmA is part of the four-gene Crm cluster which additionally includes a predicted alcohol-O-acetyl transferase (crmB), siderochrome-iron transporter (crmC), and CtrA1 copper transporter (crmD), all of which are co-regulated by copper (Fig. 1a)3. To our surprise, we found little conservation crmB, C, and D in more distantly related species.\nIdentification of crm cluster-derived metabolites To identify crm-derived metabolites, we started by comparing the metabolomes of wildtype (WT) A. fumigatus and a \u0394crmA deletion mutant grown under copper-limited and copper-replete conditions, given that crmA expression is strongly copper-dependent3. Metabolite\nextracts were analyzed by high-resolution HPLC-MS (HPLC-HRMS), and the resulting datasets were compared using the Metaboseek software platform10, which facilitates comparative analysis of HPLC-HRMS data from multiple different conditions. These comparative analyses revealed a large number of MS features upregulated under low copper conditions. For example, we detected 385 features thatwere 20-fold or more upregulated under copper-limited conditions (p <0.05) among a total of 30,000 detected features from both positive and negative ionizationmodes (Fig. 1b, seeMethods for details on data processing). Production of 236 features induced under copper-limited conditions, representing ~30 distinct metabolites, was abolished in the \u0394crmA mutant, and in fact all features abolished in the \u0394crmA mutant were also copper-dependent (Fig. 1c). Next, we examined the metabolome of a crmAoverexpressionmutant (OE::crmA) under copper-limited and copper-replete conditions. Production of most metabolites abolished in the \u0394crmAmutant was increased above wild-type levels in OE::crmA regardless of a copper regime (Fig. 1c), further supporting that they represent CrmA-derived metabolites. Interestingly, none of the crmAdependent features were affected by the deletion of any of the other cluster genes, crmB-D (Supplementary Data 2).\nThe crmA- and copper-dependent MS features were further characterized via tandem MS (MS2) and MS2 networking, which revealed several families of structurally related crmA-dependent metabolites. We then selected the most abundant family members for partial purification via reversed-phase preparative HPLC for NMR spectroscopic analysis (Fig. 1d\u2013g, Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013e, see Supplementary Information for NMR data). This analysis revealed two distinct families of metabolites, both of which integrate an N-formylvaline moiety. Fumivaline A (1) (Fig. 1d) and the hydroxylated derivative fumivaline B (Supplementary Fig. 2a) represent modified ergot alkaloids featuring a festuclavine (2)-like ring system, whereas fumicicolin A (3) (Fig. 1e) and fumicicolin B (Supplementary Fig. 2b) represent esters of N-formylvaline with D-mannitol or a hexose, respectively. In addition, we detected free N-formylvaline (4) (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2c), as well as small amounts of (S)\u22122-isocyanoisovaleric acid (5) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2d, e), a plausible precursor of the identified N-formylvaline derivatives (Supplementary Table 1). The identities of fumicicolin A (3) and (S)\u22122-isocyanoisovaleric acid (valine isocyanide, 5) were further confirmed using synthetic standards prepared from commercially available Nformylvaline (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Detailed descriptions of the syntheses are provided in the Supplementary Information. The (S)configuration of the\u03b1-carbon in the valine-likemoieties in fumivalineA and N-formylvaline was established using Marfey\u2019s method11 (Supplementary Fig. 2g, h), suggesting that the crmA-derived metabolites are derived from L-valine. Lastly, we showed that the relative configuration of fumivaline A is identical to that of the related ergot alkaloid festuclavine (2) using NOESY spectra (Supplementary Fig. 2i)7,12.\nFumivaline biosynthesis requires the ergot alkaloid BGC Ergot alkaloids are a class of tryptophan-derived alkaloids featuring the characteristic ergoline tetracyclic ring structure (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3a)12,13. Given that the structures of the fumivalines are related to that of the ergot alkaloid festuclavine, it appeared that crmA worked in conjunction with the ergot alkaloid BGC for fumivaline biosynthesis. To confirm the requirement of the ergot alkaloid BGC in the biosynthesis of fumivalines, we examined the metabolome of a deletion mutant of DmaW, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the condensation reactionof tryptophananddimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) in ergot alkaloid BGCs7,14,15, in A. fumigatus (Fig. 2a, b). Deletion of dmaW eliminated the production of fumivalines A and B as well as of festuclavine and pyroclavine, whereas the abundance of other crmA-derived metabolites, including N-formylvaline remained unchanged or increased (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3b). In turn, deletion of crmA eliminated N-formylvaline, fumivalines A and B\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4828 2\nsynthesis but slightly increased the production of festuclavine and pyroclavine (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3b). These data confirm that both crmA and the ergot alkaloid BGC are required for the production of the fumivalines.\nStrecker-like peptide formation in fumivaline biosynthesis Known ergot alkaloids can be divided into three classes, ergoclavines, ergoamides, and ergopeptines, based on their substituents at C-8 position (Supplementary Fig. 3a). D-lysergic acid and its amides are ergoamides derived from the oxidation of a methyl group at the C-8 position of ergoclavines. Ergopeptines12,13 are peptides of D-lysergic acid showing complex structures linkedwith a peptide bond at the C-8 position synthesized via a canonical NRPS pathway. In contrast, fumivalines identified in this study represent a new class of ergot alkaloids that contains an unprecedented peptide moiety attached to the C-7 position.\nFumivaline A biosynthesis could plausibly result from a nucleophilic attack of valine-derived isocyanide from CrmA on an imine intermediate of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis (Fig. 2a, b). Therefore,\nwe hypothesized that CrmA first generates valine isocyanide (5), which is then attached to a previously proposed precursor of festuclavine, dehydrofestuclavine (6), via nucleophilic attack of the isocyanide carbon of 5 at the imine carbon of 6. The formation of the carboncarbon bond is then followed by hydration, resulting in the amide bond in position C-7 of the fumivalines (Fig. 2a). This mechanism is closely related to thewell-knownStrecker synthesis of amino acids and peptides from isocyanides and imine intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 3c).\nThe Strecker reactions usually yield racemic mixtures of \u03b1-amino acids as products. Correspondingly, our HPLC-HRMS analyses revealed multiple isomers of fumivalines A and B with identical MS2 spectra, likely representing diastereomers (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a), consistent with non-stereoselective peptide bond formation in fumivaline biosynthesis. Therefore, we asked whether fumivaline formation could have resulted from the reaction of valine isocyanide with festuclavine biosynthesis intermediates, e.g., 6, during the processing or extraction of the fungal cultures. Although we did not detect valine isocyanide in WT A. fumigatus and the amounts of\nFig. 1 | The crm BGC and associated metabolites from A. fumigatus. a Comparison of crm BGCs in A. fumigatus, P. commune, and C. heterostrophus.

In fact, we found that synthetic valine isocyanide is rapidly hydrated to form N-formylvaline under acidic conditions, e.g., duringHPLCanalysis. To testwhether the N-formylvaline in our fungal extracts was derived from the hydration of valine isocyanide, we extracted WT A. fumigatus cultures grown under copper-limited conditions with deuterium-labeled solvents. If valine isocyanide was hydrated during extraction or subsequent solvent removal, some of the resulting N-formylvaline would incorporate one deuterium. In fact, HPLC-HRMS analysis of the deuterium-labeled extracts indicated that 5.7% of the observed N-formylvaline was deuterated (Fig. 2d), indicating that roughly 18% of the detected N-formylvaline in the MS analyses is derived from hydrolysis during or post extraction (also seeMethods, Supplementary Table 2). Themajority of the detected N-fomylvaline thus formed prior to extraction, either\nnon-enzymatically or via one of the five putative isocyanide hydratases in A. fumigatus identified via a search for homologs of ThiJ/PfpI isocyanide hydratases from Pseudomonas putida16 (Supplementary\nTable 3). Likewise, 29% of fumicicolin A was observed to incorporate one deuterium when using deuterium-labeled extraction solvents, indicating that the majority of detected fumicicolin A is derived from hydrolysis of an ester of valine isocyanide and D-mannitol during extraction (fumicicolin C, Supplementary Fig. 3d).\nConservationof fumivalinebiosynthesis inPenicilliumcommune Known producers of ergot alkaloids include the fungal genera Claviceps, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Epichlo\u00eb12,13. Many Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. produce ergoclavines as final products, whereas the Claviceps and Epichlo\u00eb spp. instead produce D-lysergic acid derivatives, ergoamides, and ergopeptines (Supplementary Fig. 3a). crmA homologs are conserved in the ergot alkaloid producing P. commune as well as in the non-ergot alkaloid producing P. expansum (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data 1).

The two Penicillium spp. produced N-formylvaline under copper-limited conditions, whereas neither N-formylvaline nor any of the other crmA-dependent metabolites we had identified inA. fumigatuswere present under copper-replete conditions (Fig. 2c). These results confirmed that in Penicillium spp., as in A. fumigatus, production of crmA-dependent metabolites is strongly regulatedby copper levels. In addition,wedetected fumivalines A andB under copper-limited conditions in P. commune but not in P. expansum (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3b), consistent with the presence of the festuclavine pathway in P. commune but not P. expansum (Fig. 2a, b). Taken together, our results show that fumivaline production requires crmA, the festuclavine pathway, and copper starvation.\nNextwe askedwhether the putative precursors of the fumivalines, dehydrofestuclavine and valine isocyanide, canbe exchanged between different fungi. For this purpose we used mixed cultures of A. fumigatus\u0394crmA, whichproduces ergot alkaloids but not valine isocyanide, with two different strains producing valine isocyanide but lacking ergot alkaloid biosynthesis: A. fumigatus \u0394dmaW, which is defective in\nergot alkaloid production, orOE::crmA of P. expansum, which lacks the ergot alkaloid pathway. Fumivaline A was not detected in the coculture of A. fumigatus \u0394crmA and P. expansum, whereas appreciable amounts of fumivaline A were detected in the co-culture of the two A. fumigatus mutants (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). The latter result suggests that valine isocyanide or ergot alkaloid precursors can be exchanged between the two A. fumigatus strains, but not between A. fumigatus \u0394crmA and P. expansum.\nConservation of crmA-dependent mannitol derivatives Homology searches showed that crmA homologs are also found in several species that lack ergot alkaloid BGCs, e.g., P. expansum, as well as in several phytopathogenic fungi including A. brassicicola, L. maculans, and C. heterostrophus (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data 1). crmA and crmB, with the addition of an \u03b1/\u03b2hydrolase between the two genes, are conserved in A. brassicicola, L. maculans, and C. heterostrophus, whereas homologs of the two transporters, crmC and crmD, were not identified in any of these species (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nTo investigate the role of crmA in fungi that lack ergot alkaloid BGCs, we constructed crmA-deletion mutants for P. expansum and C. heterostrophus. Untargeted metabolomic comparison of C. heterostrophus crmA mutant and WT under copper-limited conditions followed by MS2 networking revealed several groups of crmA- and copper-dependent MS features (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4).\nlog (WT( -Cu)/WT)\n-10.0 10.0\nSI-11\n3\n10\n12\nSI-13\nba R1O\nOR1\nOR2\nOR3\nOR3\nOR2\nBrassicicolin A (17) Maculansin A (16) R1=B, R1=Ac, R2=C, R2=A, R3=Ac R3=H\nO HO\nB:\nO N\nC:\nC\nO N\nA:\nC\nO O\nOH OH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nO N H\n3\n12 10\n86 10 Retention time [min]\nWT (-Cu) WT \u2206crmA (-Cu)\nm/z (+) 459.1944\n64 8 Retention time [min]\nWT (-Cu) WT \u2206crmA (-Cu)\nm/z (+) 374.1411\n53 7 Retention time [min]\nWT (-Cu) WT\n\u2206crmA (-Cu)\nm/z (+) 305.1203\nO O\nOH OH\nOH\nOH\nOAc\nO N H\nO O\nO OH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nO N H\nO H N O\nc\n14 4R 15 4S\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nO OH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nO HO\n4\nIn te\nns ity\n(l og\n10 )\nW T\nW T(\n-C u)\nc rm\nA (-C u) O E: :c rm A\nA. fumigatus\nP . e\nxp an\nsu m\nP . c\nom m\nun e\nC . h\net er\nos tro\nph us\nW T\nW T(\n-C u)\nc rm\nA (-C u) O E: :c rm A\nW T\nW T(\n-C u)W T\nW T(\n-C u)\nc rm\nA (-C\nu)\nFig. 3 | Identification of fumicicolin A and related metabolites. a Partial representation of MS2 network (cosine >0.7) for WT C. heterostrophus in ESI+, showing the cluster containing fumicicolin A (3) and the heterocicolins (10\u201313).

In addition to N-formylvaline moieties, the heterocicolins additionally incorporate acetyl and/or 2-hydroxyisovaleryl moieties, similar to brassicicolin A (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c). The identities of heterocicolins C, E, and F were confirmed with synthetic standards (Supplementary Fig. 5d), whereas the structures of acetylated heterocicolins A, B, and D, which are produced as mixtures of isomers, were proposed solely based on MS2 spectra (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Similar to the crmA-dependent metabolites in A. fumigatus, production of heterocicolins A-F, fumicicolins A and B, and N-formylvaline was abolished or strongly downregulated under copper-replete condition (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5a, c). Similarly, crmA-dependent production of Nformylvaline and fumicicolins A and B was observed in P. expansum under copper-limited but not copper-replete conditions (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). crmA overexpression in P. expansum resulted in increased production ofN-formylvaline and fumicicolins A and B, as in A. fumigatus, and deletion of the gene eliminated production of all three metabolites (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Fumicicolins A and B were also detected in copper-limited P. commune (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The results indicate that crmA is required for the biosynthesis of the fumicicolins and related mannitol esters incorporating N-formylvaline. The D-mannitol derived fumicicolins and heterocicolins are closely related to maculansin A (16), and brassicicolin A (17), previously described from L. maculans20 and A. brassicicola21, respectively (Fig. 3b), both of which also harbor crmA homologs (Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that 16 and 17 are derived from the crmA homologs in these species20\u201322. Differences in the composition of the crm cluster in these fungi may account for the observed differences in crmAdependent D-mannitol derivatives. For example, the \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase present in the crm clusters of C. heterostrophus, L. maculans, and A. brassicicola, but not A. fumigatus, could be responsible for the additional attachment of the hydroxyisovaleric acid or acetic acidmoieties in the crmA-dependent D-mannitol derivatives in these species (Supplementary Fig. 1). \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold family of enzymes can have diverse biosynthetic roles23 and have been shown to serve as acyltransferases in natural products biosynthesis in Acremonium chrysogenum24 and Caenorhabditis elegans25,26.

Zones of inhibition were observed against all fungi and all bacteria, except P. aeruginosa, from all OE::crmA extracts and, less consistently, from WT extracts grown under copper-limited conditions, in contrast to no inhibition zones observed from extracts of copper-replete WT or either extract of the \u0394crmA mutant (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5). These results suggested that CrmA metabolites contribute to the antimicrobial properties of A. fumigatus extracts.\nNext we selected four CrmA-derived metabolites, valine isocyanide, N-formylvaline, fumivaline A, and fumicicolin A, for testing against E. coli, S. aureus, C. auris and P. expansum. Both bacteria were inhibited by valine isocyanide (Fig. 4c), but not the other metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 6a). No metabolite showed antifungal activity when applied alone, but a combination of valine isocyanide with Nformylvaline inhibited C. auris growth at early time points, suggestive of possible synergy or additive effects of the two compounds (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 6b) against this pathogen, which is listed by the CDC as an emerging global health threat due to its inherent antifungal resistance30. Valine isocyanide had no significant impact on growth of A. fumigatus (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Taken together, these data suggested that valine isocyanide, possibly in combination with other A. fumigatus metabolites, was partly responsible for the observed crmA-dependent activity of A. fumigatus extracts against\nbacteria and may contribute to antifungal activities as well; all in the context of environments devoid or poor in copper availability."

            "text": "Filamentous fungi synthesize specific natural products to facilitate survival in response to various environmental stressors. Natural products can be elicited in response to abiotic stimuli, for example, UV induction of melanins protects fungal spores from harmful radiation15,31,32, or in response to competing microbes, where antibacterials33 or antifungals34 can confer competitive advantages to the producing fungus. Limitation of critical resources may also impact microbial secondarymetabolite synthesis, as suggestedbymodulation of bacterial iron uptake genes dependent on confrontations with WT or a secondary metabolite mutant of Penicillium35. Like iron, copper levels are tightly regulated by microbes: copper is essential, but too much is toxic36,37. A. fumigatus maintains copper homeostasis in copper-deficient environments via the transcription factor MacA that activates copper importers during times of copper starvation4. Here we present a new paradigm inwhichMacA regulates the production of crmA-dependent antibiotics that inhibit the growth of potential A. fumigatus competitors under copper-deficient conditions. Our data support a view that crmA metabolites may function as conserved fitness factors in copper-deficient environments across fungal taxa (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Data 1). Valine isocyanide was efficient in inhibiting bacterial growth (Fig. 4c). This could be due to direct toxicity and/or the result of its copper chelating properties, as shown for\nb\nNRPS\nXenorhabdus bovienii\nIsocyanide synthase\nMetarhizium spp.\nAlternaria spp.\nAspergillus fumigatus\nEntomopathogenic\nLeaf pathogen Lung competition\nSoil competition\nN\nR1 O\nN H\nR2\nOHO\n-CO2 N\nR1 O\nN H\nR2\nN R3\nC\nHN\nR1 O\nN H\nNHO R3\nR1R1\nH2O\nR1\nR2\na\nN\nO\nO\nNHAc\nOH\nOH\nR2R1\nR3\nFig. 5 | Phylogenetic tree and proposed functions of CrmA-derivedmetabolites in fungal ecology. a CrmA proteins are found in three fungal taxa (for details, see Supplementary Data 1). CrmA is primarily found in pathogenic fungi including the insect pathogens Metarhizium, Cordyceps and Beauveria and the fungal parasite Trichoderma (Sordariomycetes), leaf blight pathogens Bipolaris (e.g., Cochliobolus) and Alternaria (Dothideomycetes) as well as in opportunistic pathogens and\nsaprophytic Aspergillus and Pencillium spp. and the dermatophytic genus Trichophyton (Eurotiales). Our model proposes that CrmA metabolites are synthesized under copper starvation, where they act as virulence factors facilitating copper acquisition during fungal/host encounters or as antimicrobial compounds during competition in copper-limited niches. b Proposed rhabdoplanin A biosynthesis via an Ugi-like reaction in bacteria9. Panel (a) was created with BioRender.com.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4828 7\nother isocyanides including the A. fumigatusmetabolite xanthocillin28. The antifungal effects of crude extracts ofWT grown in copper-limited conditions may result from additive effects or synergy of valine isocyanide with other metabolites (Fig. 4b, d), including both CrmA- and non-CrmA-derived compounds. For instance, we found that in addition to CrmA metabolites, copper-starved A. fumigatus also produced higher quantities of helvolic acid, a known antifungal agent38\u201340 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). A. fumigatus occupies diverse primary niches, e.g., the lung as a common opportunistic pathogen, and as a common saprophyte in organic debris in fields and the rhizosphere where any advantage in the competition for scarce nutrients can be a significant fitness attribute (Fig. 5a). More detailed elucidation of the biological functions of the CrmA-derived metabolites we identified, e.g., to investigate synergistic activities, will require additional method development to ensure stability and accurate quantification of the involved metabolites, given that our isotope labeling studies demonstrated that valine isocyanide and its mannitol ester, fumicicolin C, are highly susceptible to hydrolysis and reaction with other nucleophiles.\nOur analysis of CrmA-derived metabolites revealed biosynthetic pathways that produce (i) a new class of ergot alkaloids derived from Strecker-like peptide formation and (ii) valine isocyanide D-mannitol derivatives, whereby both pathways are strongly induced by copper starvation (Fig. 4a). In the former pathway, formation of the peptide bond in fumivaline biosynthesis appears to result from the nucleophilic attack of an isocyanide on an imine intermediate of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, an unprecedented reaction in fungi that yields a new class of ergot alkaloids. Recently, a similar reaction was reported to be responsible for the formation of a peptide bond in the rhabdoplanins, a family of natural products isolated from the bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii9 (Fig. 5b). Formation of the peptide bond in the rhabdoplanins was proposed to proceed as an Ugi-like reaction involving a decarboxylation step to generate the imine intermediate to which the isocyanide is then coupled, effectively resulting in replacement of the carbon lost by decarboxylation with the carbon from the isocyanide (Fig. 5b). In contrast, fumivaline A biosynthesis appears to proceed via nucleophilic attack of the isocyanide to the imine intermediate (Fig. 2a), thus producing a new ergot alkaloid carbon scaffold.\nErgot alkaloids have been primarily shown to be active against vertebrates ranging from insects to humans41,42 (Fig. 5a), and their pharmacological activities have been harnessed for diverse clinical uses43. Interestingly ergot alkaloid synthesis by insect pathogenic fungalMetarhizium spp. is tightly regulated and associated with insect colonization41, and we note that A. fumigatus ergot alkaloids are toxic to insects44. Regardless of fumivaline function, the intriguing reactivity of isocyanides shows their potential to function as versatile building blocks in the biosynthesis of other yet uncharacterized natural products9.\nThe valine isocyanide D-mannitol pathway, on the other hand, requires CrmA and the polyol, D-mannitol, where acylation, likely by an as-yet-unknown acyl transferase, with N-formylvaline or valine isocyanide followed by hydration yields fumicicolin A. Mannitol is a common sugar across the fungal Kingdom and thought to provide protection against osmotic stress45,46. Its role as a precursor for CmrAdependent metabolites appears to be conserved in phytopathogenic fungi, such as A. brassicicola, L. maculans, and C. heterostrophus. In these species, CrmA homologs are located next to \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolases that could be involved in the attachment of additional acyl moieties26. Notably, the CrmA homologs in these clades contain an additional transporter domain (Fig. 1a) thatmay also contribute toCrmApathway metabolism in these fungi. The varying level of conservation of the other genes in the A. fumigatus Crm gene cluster, crmB, C, and D, in more distantly related species is consistent with a model in which CrmA-derived valine isocyanide is integrated into different pathways in different species, and is consistent with our finding that none of the\nother cluster genes are required for the CrmA-dependent metabolites in A. fumigatus.\nFumicicolin-related metabolites identified from phytopathogenic fungi, such as brassicicolin A synthesized by A. brassicicola and maculansins A and B produced by L. maculans, are host-selective phytotoxins8,20. Phytotoxin synthesis by leaf pathogens results in necrotic lesions in plant tissues and provides a source of easily obtained nutrients for the pathogen. A recent study of the plant pathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum showed that host copper was transported from healthy leaf tissues to necrotic tissues during infection, thus supplying the fungus with access to this micronutrient47. We speculate that the low copper availability in leaf tissues may be the signal to induce CrmA-derived phytotoxins which, in a similar manner as with S. sclerotiorum, could redirect copper supply to necrotic tissues colonized by the fungi (Fig. 5a).\nThe requirement of physically separated loci for fumivaline biosynthesis (conserved in both A. fumigatus and P. commune) demonstrates the complex signaling network fungi use to couple expression of non-clustered genes to increase unique chemical diversity. Although most secondary metabolites are reported to be generated from a single locus, examples of natural products requiring genes found in more than one locus are known, such as aspercryptin and nidulan A from A. nidulans48,49, aflatrem in A. flavus50, T toxin in C. heterostrophus51 and trichothecenes in some Fusarium spp.52. These examples suggest that greater consideration of cross-cluster exchange of intermediates could reveal other intriguing pathways. Our work further demonstrates that BGCs are still invisible to current bioinformatics tools (ICSs are not currently identified by BGC algorithms such as antiSMASH) but inferred from gene expression pattern changes in response to environmental stimuli, here copper starvation, can uncover unexpected chemical space. Our study shows that this approach can enable major advances in understanding fungal secondary metabolism, including genuinely new biosynthetic pathways and small-molecule functions. Given that homology searches revealed a large number of CrmA and other ICS homologs in fungi, it seems likely that isocyanides contribute to the production of many as-yetundiscovered compounds.\nIn summary, our data show that the analysis of ICS-generated metabolites can reveal not only intriguing new structures and biosynthetic strategies but also striking connections of secondary metabolism with copper homeostasis. Our previous work on the A. fumigatus xanthocillin ICS-BGC showed that xanthocillin and xanthocillin-like isocyanides bind copper, deprive competing microbes of copper, and may facilitate copper uptake28. This latter study, coupled with the copper regulation of CrmA-dependent antimicrobials reported here, makes a strong case for micronutrient scarcity regulating fungal secondary metabolites biosynthesis to enable starvation survival via complementary ecological strategies (Fig. 5a)."

The reactionmixture was incubated in a water bath at 80 \u00b0C for 3min. Then 50\u03bcL of 2 N hydrochloric acidwas added to quench the reaction by neutralization. Additionally, 300\u03bcL of aqueous 50% acetonitrile was added to the solution to dissolve the reaction products. A 2\u03bcL aliquot of the reactionmixture was analyzed by LC/MS using the gradient scheme described above. The same procedure was performed for a metabolome fraction containing Nformylvaline. Standards of L-valine and D-valinewere derivatizedwith LFDAA as described above. The FDAA derivatives of valine derived from fumivaline A and N-formylvaline showed the same retention time as the FDAA derivative of L-valine, which established that the valine moieties inN-formylvaline and fumivaline A possessed L-configuration (Supplementary Fig. 2g, h).\nFungal culture extraction with deuterium-labeled solvents About 5mL of 7:3 mixture of methanol-d1 and deuterium oxide were added to liquid fungal cultures (5mL), including fungal tissue and medium and vigorously mixed. The sample was frozen using a dry ice acetone bath and lyophilized. The lyophilized residueswere extracted with 2.5mL of 7:3:10 mixture of methanol-d1, deuterium oxide, and water for 24 h with vigorous stirring. Extracts were pelleted at 5000 \u00d7 g for 10min, and supernatants were transferred to another 4mL glass vials. Samples were then dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific) vacuum concentrator. Dried materials were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of methanol and vortexed for 1min. Samples were pelleted at 5000\u00d7g for 5min, and supernatants were transferred to 2mL HPLC vials. Clarified extracts were transferred to fresh HPLC vials and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Percent of valine isocyanide hydrolysis was calculated using the following formula: Ratio (%) = (deuterated N-formylvaline, %) \u00d7 (abundance of H + abundance of D)/(abundance of D), which takes into account the ratio between hydrogen and deuterium in the extraction solvent, also considers the contribution from water in the culture media (Supplementary Table 2)."

            "text": "An MS2 molecular network64 was created using Metaboseek version 0.9.7 and visualized in Cytoscape65. Features were matched with their respective MS2 scan within an m/z window of 5 ppm and a retention time window of 15 s, using the MS2scans function. To construct a molecular network, the tolerance of the fragment peaks was set to an m/zof 0.002 or 5 ppm, theminimumnumber of peakswas set to 3, and the noise level was set to 2%. Once the network was constructed, a cosine value of 0.7 was used, the number of possible connections was restricted to 6 for positive ion mode, and the maximum cluster size was restricted to 200 for positive ion mode.\nSynteny analysis of crmA loci To locate crmA homologs, a local BLAST66 search was conducted against a database ofA. fumigatus (NCBI accession: GCF_000002655.1), A. brassicicola (ATCC96836)67, C. heterostrophus (GCA_000338975.1), and P. commune (GCA_000338975.1, sequenced generously received from Dr. Benjamin Wolfe)19. Protein domains were predicted for the eight genes flanking the left and right of all three crmA homologs by searching against the CDD v3.19 database on the NCBI conserved domains web tool68. The expected value thresholdwas kept at 0.01 and composition-based statistic adjustment was turned on. Clinker and clustermap.js was utilized to make comparisons of gene cluster similarity69. Similarity scores were calculated by Clinker and are based on the cumulative sequence identity of homologous sequences and the number of shared contiguous sequence pairs. Visualization of the results was done with clustermap.js.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4828 10\nIdentification of all crmA homologs To locate all of the crmA homologs, we extracted the predicted crmA isocyanide synthase domain amino acid sequence from A. fumigatus. This was done to capture variations of the crmA gene that have homologous ICS regions. The following was run using BLAST+70 version 2.12.0 on 11/01/2021: blastp -query ICS_crmA.fa -remote -db nr -evalue 1e-6 -out ICScrmAHits.txt -outfmt \u201c6 qseqid sseqid sacc sgi staxids sscinames scomnames sblastnames sskingdoms stitle length mismatchgapopen qstart qend sstart send sstrand evalue bitscore\u201d. As only the crmA isocyanide regionwas used in this search, wefiltered out hits that had a protein length of less than 1000 amino acids (for reference the crmA protein in A. fumigatus is 1537 amino acids). This prevented returned hits from proteins that were solely an ICS domain (Supplementary Data 1). To generate a visualization of these hits, species with homologs to the crmA protein were mapped onto a taxonomic tree that was generated by identifying single copy orthologs from BUSCO71, followed by an estimation of the maximumlikelihood phylogeny with IQ-TREE72.\nAntimicrobial assay using crude extracts Antimicrobial assays were assessed for Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. expansum, A. brassicicola, Candida albicans, and C. auris using Kirby\u2013Baur\u2019s disc-diffusionmethod73. A loopful ofE.coliwas inoculated in 4mL of LB media and L. monocytogenes in 4mL of BHI (brain\u2013heart infusion) liquid media, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C in a shaker incubator at 200 rpmovernight.C. auris andC. albicansweregrownon YEPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) media at 33 \u00b0C for 48 h, a small amount of the yeast was scraped off of the plates using a sterile toothpick and resuspended in 4ml 0.85% sodium chloride. A sterile cotton swab was used to dip and swab the yeast and overnight bacterial cultures, completely and evenly on the respective agar plates. 1 \u00d7 106 spores from 5-day old P. expansum plates and 7-day old A. brassicicola plates were inoculated in 10mL GMM top agar (GMMwith 0.75% agar) and MEA top agar (MEA with 0.75% agar), respectively, before pouring them on the respective agar plates. The lyophilized crude extract samples were resuspended with 500uL of 100% methanol and mixed well. Sterile 6mm blank paper disks were individually injected with 25 \u00b5L of crude extracts from wildtype A. fumigatus, crmA deletion and crmA overexpression strains grown on GMM liquid media with copper and without copper. They were then placed at equal distances from each other on all the bacterial and fungal plates, immediately after their inoculation. The bacterial plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, while the P. expansum plate was incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 3 days and A. brassicicola at 25 \u00b0C for 5 days. The Candida plates were incubated at 33 \u00b0C for 2 days. The presence or absence of antimicrobial susceptibility with all the extracts was determined and zones of inhibition were measured at the end of the respective incubation periods.\nAntimicrobial assay using purified metabolites All antimicrobial assays with purified compounds were performed in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates. Bacteria used in these assays (E. coli and S. aureus) were used from fresh plates of LB incubated at 30 \u00b0C overnight. Liquid cultures were raised in 3mL of liquid LB medium by inoculating a single colony incubated at 30 \u00b0C with constant shaking at 250 rpm. Overnight cultures were harvested with centrifugation, washed 2X with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to be used as inoculum for the assays.\nSamples of purified fumivaline A, synthetic fumicicolin A, synthetic (S)\u22122-isocyanoisovaleric acid, andN-formylvaline obtained from TCI America were resuspended to a final concentration of 10mM in water,DMSO, andmethanol respectively,whichwere treated as stocks. A concentration gradient was set up using these stocks for each\nmetabolite against each bacterium. All metabolites were set up at half gradients; valine isocyanide with 1mM as the highest and 15 \u00b5M as the lowest concentrations; fumivaline A and N-formylvaline with 250 \u00b5M and 4 \u00b5M as the highest and lowest concentrations respectively. Each well of the96-well platewas inoculated tohold afinal volumeof 200 \u00b5L with 2.5% by volume of the desiredmetabolite (for fumivaline A and Nformylvaline) and 10% by volume of valine isocyanide. Corresponding solvents were used as positive control and gentamicin at 50 \u00b5g/mLwas used as the negative control. Bacteria were added to obtain a final OD600 = 0.01. The plates were incubated for 24 h before OD600 was read again. Percent survival reported was calculated by normalizing OD600 at 24 h to OD600 at inoculation (0 h).\nAntifungal assays were carried out against C. auriswith the stocks prepared as above. Synergistic activities of valine isocyanide with Nformylvaline (see results in Fig. 4d) were tested in 96-well plates. The compounds were added at concentrations of 1mM and 250 \u00b5M, respectively, with corresponding solvent combinations as a control in a total volume of 200 \u00b5L of YPD medium (10 g yeast extract, 20 g peptone, and 20 g glucose in 1 L). Three replicates weremonitored per treatment.C. auris cells were grownovernight in a 1mLYPDmediumat 30 \u00b0C without shaking. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and added to YPDat afinal concentration of 5 \u00d7 104 cells/mL. The plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C and OD600 readings were taken after 24\u201336 h. Percent survival reported was calculated by normalizing OD600 at 36 h to OD600 at inoculation (0h).\nAntifungal activity of valine isocyanide against A. fumigatus was tested using stocks prepared as above. The compoundwas testedwith 5mMas the highest concentration and a serial half dilution from 1mM to 15.62 \u00b5M as the lowest concentration. About 100 \u00b5L of the A. fumigatus spores in GMM liquid media74,75 were inoculated to each well of the96-well plate for afinal concentrationof 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mLwith 100 \u00b5L of each concentration of valine isocyanide in water. Water was used as negative control and polymyxin B76 at 40mM was used as a positive control. Three replicates were monitored per treatment. The entire experiment was set up on ice and optical density was checked at 600 nm upon completion. The plate was then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, afterwhichcontents of thewellsweremixedusing amultichannel pipette to resuspend fungi, and OD600 was measured again.\nOne-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test was performed to assess if the differences in survival at the range of concentrations were statistically significant (at p value <0.05) from survival with solvent only."
