    "abstractText": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of spin-1/2 nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratio is challenging due to the low NMR signal strength. Methodology for the rapid acquisition of Rh NMR parameters is demonstrated for the case of the rhodium formate \u201cpaddlewheel\u201d complex Rh2(HCO2)4. A scheme is described for enhancing the Rh signal strength by polarization transfer from H nuclei, which also greatly reduces the interference from ringing artifacts, a common hurdle for the direct observation of low-\u03b3 nuclei. The Rh relaxation time constants T1 and T2 are measured within 20 min by using H-detected experiments. The field dependence of the Rh T1 is measured. The high-field relaxation is dominated by the chemical shift anisotropy mechanism. The Rh shielding anisotropy is found to be very large: \u2223\u0394\u03c3\u2223 = 9900 \u00b1 540 ppm. This estimate is compared with density functional theory calculations. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION Rhodium paddlewheel complexes have attracted significant\nattention due to their unique properties and diverse applications where they have played roles as catalysts and potential anticancer agents.1\u20135 These complexes consist of two rhodium atoms bridged by four carboxylate ligands, forming a lantern-like structure, with some resemblance to the paddlewheels of a river boat. A typical example is rhodium formate, Rh2(HCO2)4, see Fig. 1.\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful probe of the properties of rhodium complexes. 103Rh carries the distinction of being one of only 4 (with 19F, 31P, and 89Y) spin-1/2 nuclei with a natural abundance of 100%. Nevertheless, it has been relatively neglected by spectroscopists: 103Rh is a member of what Mann dubbed \u201cthe Cinderella nuclei\u201d6\u2014transition metals with spin-1/2 but very low magnetogyric ratio \u03b3. The NMR of 103Rh is associated with multiple experimental challenges leading to a relative scarcity of experimental data. However, many of these challenges have been successfully overcome by the creative application of modern NMR methodology, such as heteronuclear multiple-quantum (HMQC) NMR.7 However, although HMQC experiments allow the rapid acquisition of 103Rh NMR spectra in suitable cases, it is not possible\nto estimate 103Rh spin\u2013lattice and spin\u2013spin relaxation time constants through HMQC experiments. For this purpose, experiments exploiting 103Rh magnetization are needed.\nIn this work, we utilize a variant of the PulsePol polarization transfer technique8\u201310 to enhance the 103Rh NMR spectroscopy of the rhodium formate paddlewheel complex in solution. We report the following: (i) NMR methodology for the acquisition of directly detected 103Rh spectra with effective ringing filtration and (ii) NMR methodology for the rapid measurement of 103Rh T1 and T2 relaxation time constants over a range of magnetic field strengths. We observe a strong field dependence of the 103Rh T1, which is qualitatively consistent with a dominant chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation mechanism. We estimate the 103Rh shielding anisotropy by using information from 13C and 103Rh relaxation experiments in solution and from 13C solid-state NMR."

Each three-pulse sequence is, therefore, a \u201cwindowed\u201d version of a composite 180\u25cb pulse.21 Therefore, we call this three-pulse sequence a \u201cR-element,\u201d using notation originally introduced in the context of broadband heteronuclear decoupling,29 and later adapted for symmetry-based recoupling sequences in solid-state NMR30 and symmetry-based singlet-triplet conversion sequences in solution NMR.10 In the case of DualPol, there is no special constraint or matching condition on the duration \u03c4R of the R-element, except that it should be much shorter than the period of the relevant J-coupling, \u03c4R \u226a \u22233J RhH\u2223\n\u22121.

After an initial pair of 90\u25cb pulses, used for the suppression of ringing artifacts (see below), the DualPol sequence transfers z-magnetization from the 1H to the 103Rh nuclei, exploiting the form of the DualPol average Hamiltonian [Eq. (4)]. The resultant 103Rh z-magnetization is converted into observable transverse magnetization by a final 90\u25cb pulse. The 103Rh NMR signal is enhanced by a factor of up to \u2223\u03b3I/\u03b3S\u2223 \u223c 31, relative to that induced by a single 90 \u25cb pulse applied to 103Rh nuclei in thermal equilibrium. Ringing artifacts are strongly suppressed by a phase-cycled pair of 90\u25cb pulses on the proton channel, before the polarization transfer takes place. The signs of the 1H magnetization and the 103Rh receiver are simultaneously inverted in successive scans. Since the phases of the ringing are correlated with the phases of the pulses on the 103Rh channel, the ringing is strongly suppressed in the 103Rh spectrum. Further suppression of ringing is achieved by additional phase cycling of the PulsePol blocks. The sign of the 103Rh magnetization is invariant under global phase shifts of the DualPol sequence, while the ringing contribution is phase-correlated and largely cancels out. Similar logic has been used to design excitation schemes for ringing suppression in homonuclear NMR experiments.34,35\nFIG. 7.

For field-dependent relaxation measurements, the sample is shuttled to a region of lower magnetic field during this interval, and back again. A proton destruction filter is applied to eliminate any residual proton magnetization, such as that generated during \u03c4relax through longitudinal relaxation toward equilibrium. Remaining 103Rh z-magnetization, selected for by the two 90\u25cb pulses, is now transferred back to 1H z-magnetization by a second DualPol block and is selected for by a proton z-filter. A final 1H 90\u25cb pulse generates observable 1H transverse magnetization.

The trajectory fits well to a singleexponential decay with time constant T1(103Rh) = 0.483 \u00b1 0.002 s. A trajectory in the low magnetic field of 1 mT is shown in Fig. 11(b).

The fielddependent relaxation rate constant is a reasonable fit to the quadratic function T\u221211 (B) = T \u22121 1 (0) + aB 2, where T\u221211 (0) = 0.065 \u00b1 0.04 s \u22121 and a = 0.023 \u00b1 0.001 s\u22121 T\u22122.\n2. 1H-detected 103Rh T 2 The sequence shown in Fig. 12 was used to measure the 103Rh\nspin-spin relaxation time constant T2 in high magnetic field. Conversion of 1H z-polarization into 103Rh z-polarization is achieved via DualPol. 103Rh transverse magnetization is generated by a 90\u25cb pulse and allowed to decay during the subsequent spin echo of duration \u03c4echo. The ensuing 90\u25cb 103Rh pulse returns the remaining transverse 103Rh magnetization back to longitudinal 103Rh polarization. A 1H destruction filter destroys any residual 1H magnetization before another DualPol cross-polarization block transfers 103Rh z-magnetization back to 1H z-magnetization. The 1H z-filter selects for 1H z-magnetization before the 1H signal is induced by the final 90\u25cb 1H pulse. The pulse sequence is repeated varying the echo delay \u03c4echo in order to follow the decay of 103Rh transverse magnetization.\nThe trajectory of indirectly detected 103Rh transverse magnetization in a field of 9.4 T is shown in Fig. 13. The trajectory fits well to a single-exponential decay with time constant T2(103Rh) = 0.181 \u00b1 0.001 s. Note that the measured value of T2 is much smaller than T1 under the same conditions.\n3. 13C inversion-recovery As discussed below, the rotational correlation time \u03c4c of the rhodium formate complex may be estimated by a study of the 13C longitudinal relaxation.

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 11(c), the 103Rh relaxation rate constant T\u221211 has a quadratic dependence on magnetic field B, with an additional zero-field contribution of T\u221211 (0) = 0.0653 \u00b1 0.0383 s\n\u22121. The quadratic field dependence is consistent with a dominant chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) relaxation mechanism, as is commonly observed for the 103Rh NMR of rhodium complexes.12,37\nIt is difficult to estimate the 103Rh chemical shift anisotropy by solid-state NMR. The small magnetogyric ratio of 103Rh and the very large CSA value make solid-state 103Rh NMR very difficult. Our attempts to use the PROSPR method38 to observe the 103Rh spectrum indirectly in the solid state, by saturation transfer to the 1H nuclei, were also unsuccessful. This is likely due to the very small dipole-dipole couplings between 1H and 103Rh nuclei in this\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 104307 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0165830 159, 104307-6\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\ncomplex, which greatly inhibits dipolar-mediated polarization transfer in the solid state.\nThe symmetry of the complex indicates that the 103Rh CSA tensors should have uniaxial symmetry (\u03b7 = 0) with their unique principal axis along the Rh\u2013Rh bond. This property is assumed in the following discussion.\nAlthough the 103Rh CSA may not be measured directly, it is possible to estimate it by a combination of field-dependent 103Rh and 13C T1 measurements. The compact cage structure of the rhodium formate complex (Fig. 1) suggests that, to a good approximation, the complex tumbles in solution as a near-rigid body, with a common rotational correlation time \u03c4c for all spin interactions. This approximation allows a correlation time estimate from 13C NMR to be applied in the context of 103Rh NMR.\nA 13C nucleus of rhodium formate experiences two strong anisotropic interactions: the 13C\u20131H dipole\u2013dipole coupling with the directly bonded hydrogen nucleus and the 13C chemical shift anisotropy. For point nuclei (i.e., ignoring the spatial spread of the nuclear wavefunctions), the 13C\u20131H dipole\u2013dipole coupling constant is given by bCH = \u2212(\u03bc0/4\u03c0)h\u0335\u03b3C\u03b3Hr\u22123CH , where rCH is the 13C\u20131H internuclear distance.39 Quantum chemical calculations33 (see the supplementary material) predict an internuclear 13C\u20131H distance of 1.097 \u00c5, corresponding to a dipole\u2013dipole coupling constant of bCH = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 22.8 kHz. However, solid-state NMR studies have shown that the true dipole\u2013dipole coupling is weakened by the angular spread of the 1H wavefunctions, associated with the zero-point librational motion of the C\u2013H bonds.40 In the calculations below, we, therefore, assume a 13C\u20131H dipole-dipole coupling constant of bCH = \u22122\u03c0 \u00d7 (20.4 \u00b1 0.5) kHz.\nFor isolated 13C\u20131H spin systems in the extreme narrowing approximation (fast tumbling), the theoretical recovery of 13C longitudinal magnetization Mz(t) after perturbation from equilibrium at time t = 0 is expected to follow the biexponential curve:\nMz(t) =Meqz + (Mz(0) \u2212M eq z ) 1 2 (exp{\u2212( 1 2 b2CH + 1 5 \u03c92CSA)\u03c4c}\n+ exp{\u2212( 3 2 b2CH + 1 5 \u03c92CSA)\u03c4c}), (6)\nwhere Meqz is the thermal equilibrium 13C magnetization, and \u03c9CSA is defined as follows:\n\u03c9CSA = \u2212\u03b3CB0\u2225\u03c3(2)\u2225, (7)\nwhere \u2225\u03c3(2)\u2225 is the norm of the 13C shielding tensor, as defined in Eq. (5). The biexponential form of Eq. (6) is due to 1H\u201313C crossrelaxation during the magnetization recovery.41\u201343\nIn a magnetic field of 9.4 T, the 13C CSA, as estimated by 13C solid-state NMR (Sec. III A 3), corresponds to an interaction strength of \u03c9CSA \u2243 2\u03c0 \u00d7 (9.7 \u00b1 0.1) kHz. By fitting the experimental 13C inversion-recovery trajectory to an equation of the form in Eq. (6), we obtain the following estimate of the rotational correlation time for the rhodium formate paddlewheel complex in THF-d8 solution at 298 K: \u03c4c \u2243 24.5 \u00b1 1.5 ps. The 103Rh relaxation may now be analyzed using the estimate of \u03c4c from the 13C data. As shown in Fig. 11, the 103RhT\u221211 relaxation rate constant is well-described by the function T\u221211 (B) = T \u22121 1 (0) + aB\n2, with the field-independent term T\u221211 (0) = 0.065 \u00b1 0.038 s\n\u22121 and the quadratic coefficient a = 0.023 \u00b1 0.001 s\u22121 T\u22122.\nThe quadratic field-dependent term may be ascribed to the CSA mechanism. In the extreme narrowing approximation (fast tumbling), the CSA contribution to the T\u221211 relaxation rate constant for 103Rh is given by43\n(T1(103Rh)) \u22121 CSA = 2 15 B20\u03b3 2 Rh\u0394\u03c3 2\u03c4c, (8)\nwhere the shielding anisotropy \u0394\u03c3 is defined as follows:43\n\u0394\u03c3 = 3 2 (\u03c3ZZ \u2212 \u03c3iso) = \u2212 3 2 \u03b4aniso. (9)\nEquation (8) implies that the quadratic field-dependent coefficient a for the 103RhT\u221211 relaxation rate constant is given by\na = 2\n15 \u03b32Rh\u0394\u03c3 2\u03c4c. (10)\nThe experimental estimate of the quadratic coefficient a = 0.023 \u00b1 0.001 s\u22121 T\u22122 may be combined with the correlation time estimate \u03c4c \u2243 24.5 \u00b1 1.5 ps to obtain the following experimental estimate of the 103Rh shielding anisotropy: \u2223\u0394\u03c3\u2223 = 9900 \u00b1 540 ppm.\nThis is a very large number. Although prior estimates of the 103Rh CSA are scarce in the literature, CSA values for heavy spin1/2 nuclei are sometimes of a similar magnitude,44\u201353 with closely related platinum (II) compounds displaying 195Pt CSA values on the order of 10 000 ppm.44,46,51,53 To our knowledge, the only other measurements of 103Rh CSAs, in very different Rh(III) compounds, were on the order of \u223c500\u20131500 ppm.54,55 This dramatic range is also typical47,48,52 for heavy spin-1/2 nuclei.\nUsing ORCA,33,56,57 103Rh shielding tensors were computed at the TPSSh/SARC-ZORA-TZVPP level of theory using implicit solvation (CPCM58,59 for THF), the zeroth-order regular approximation (ZORA)60,61 for the inclusion of relativistic effects, GaugeIndependent Atomic Orbitals (GIAOs), the Resolution of Identity (RI) approximation,57 and the tau-dependent correction as suggested by Dobson62\u201364 (see the supplementary material). The result is summarized in Table I.\nThe calculated CSA is somewhat smaller than the experimental estimate. Underestimation of CSAs calculated using the ZORA method has been reported for other heavy spin-1/2 nuclei,65\u201367\nwhere better agreement might be obtained with higher order fourcomponent relativistic calculations66 or by accounting for the relativistic breakdown of the relationship between spin-rotation and the paramagnetic contribution to the anisotropy.67\nThe origin of the zero-field contribution T\u221211 (0) to the 103Rh relaxation rate constant is currently unknown. As discussed in the supplementary material, the 103Rh\u2013103Rh and 103Rh\u20131H\nTABLE I. Estimates of the 103Rh shielding tensor anisotropy \u0394\u03c3 of Rh formate, defined in Eq. (9).

In the literature, the low-field relaxation of heavy spin-1/2 nuclei is often6,68\u201370 attributed to a spin-rotation71 mechanism. However, to our knowledge, this conclusion has not been supported by any theoretical or computational studies.\nThe experimental estimate of the 103Rh T2 is much shorter than the estimate of T1 under the same conditions (T2 = 0.181 \u00b1 0.001 s as against T1 = 0.483 \u00b1 0.002 s, in a field of 9.4 T. We tentatively attribute the short T2 value to the modulation of the isotropic chemical shift by ligand exchange at the axial positions. Other decoherence mechanisms, such as diffusion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic fields, are expected to be too weak to account for the observed T2 value in this case.\nIn conclusion, this paper has demonstrated methodology for the indirect estimation of 103Rh T1 and T2 values by magnetization transfer to and from 1H nuclei using the DualPol pulse sequence. Field-dependent 103Rh T1 measurements indicate a very large chemical shift anisotropy for the 103Rh sites in the rhodium formate paddlewheel complex. The field-independent contribution to the 103Rh relaxation rate constant is not fully understood at the current time.\nA limitation of the methodology described here is the prerequisite of a spin system with direct scalar couplings between 103Rh nuclei and a proton, which is not present in all rhodium complexes. This limitation may be addressed via the use of a relay nucleus, such as 13C at natural abundance.7,72\u201374\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe supplementary material includes the 13C relaxation data, experimental parameters for the solid-state 13C spectrum, and details of the DFT calculations in ORCA."
