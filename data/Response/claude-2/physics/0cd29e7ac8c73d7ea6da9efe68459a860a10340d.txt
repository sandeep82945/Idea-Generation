 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on using soy protein hydrolysates to stabilize palm olein during deep frying:

1. Investigate the antioxidant and oil-stabilizing effects of specific peptide sequences identified in the pepsin and trypsin hydrolysates. The paper showed the pepsin hydrolysate had higher activity but did not identify the key active peptides. Bioinformatics could be used to predict promising peptides.

2. Test the soy protein hydrolysates in stabilizing other vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, etc. during deep frying. The effects may differ for oils with varying fatty acid compositions. 

3. Evaluate the sensory qualities of foods fried in palm olein stabilized with the soy protein hydrolysates compared to unstabilized oil. This could include assessing odor, taste, and textural changes.

4. Study the effects of the hydrolysates on the nutritional quality of the palm olein during repeated deep frying cycles. Parameters could include vitamin E content, formation of trans fats, and retention of essential fatty acids. 

5. Investigate combining the soy protein hydrolysates with other antioxidants like rosemary extract or green tea to evaluate synergistic effects on stabilizing frying oils. Mixtures may provide greater protection than individual additives.
