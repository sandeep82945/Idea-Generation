Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Database (VIP), and Wan Fang Database up to May 2022 for relevant studies. Relevant studies were identified by using specific eligibility criteria and data were extracted. Results: A total of 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1,698 patients were included. Compared with routine treatment, electroacupuncture treatment had lower visual analog scale (VAS) score [mean difference=\u22120.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): \u22121.11 to \u22120.47, P <0.00001], and the symptom severity scale and function status scale in electroacupuncture group were significantly lower than the control group (P=0.0001 and P=0.006). Moreover, the electrophysiological parameters in the electroacupuncture group were better than the control group. The electroacupuncture group had higher total effective rate than the control group (odds ratio =4.94, 95% CI: 3.44\u20137.08, P <0.00001). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicated that electroacupuncture had lower VAS score, higher total effective rate, a lower the scores of symptoms and function and electroacupuncture had better electrophysiological parameters. However, these findings needed to be verified further by multicenter, double-blind, and large-sample RCTs.\nKEYWORDS\nmeta-analysis, carpal tunnel syndrome, electroacupuncture, effect, systematic review\n1. Introduction\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of the median nerve. CTS adversely affects daily activities and affects general health and quality of life. The prevalence of CTS has been reported to be 36 per 10,000 people, and in the United States, approximately 25 women and 13 men per 10,000 adults receive carpal tunnel\n01 frontiersin.org\nrelease surgery per year (1\u20133). CTS is diagnosed by clinical symptoms (such as discomfort, paraesthesia, and numbness) and electrophysiological diagnostic tests (4, 5). Occupational risk factors have long been recognized, including repetitive, forceful hand work, wrist extension and vibration, and cold conditions (6).\nCurrently, standard surgical and nonsurgical strategies for treating CTS have been reported, but the safety and efficacy are still unclear (7). Mild-to-moderate degree CTS patients often opt for nonsurgical treatments. Nonsurgical treatments include laser therapy, pharmacotherapy, therapeutic ultrasound, musculoskeletal manipulation, splinting, and acupuncture (4, 8, 9). Electroacupuncture treatment can relieve pain by activating a variety of bioactive chemicals through peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal mechanisms, and a review reported that electroacupuncture might be more effective in relieving pain than standard manual acupuncture (10, 11).\nHowever, some studies demonstrated that electroacupuncture treatment is not superior to acupuncture in improving symptomatic. On the contrary, control treatment can exert positive therapeutic effects for CTS patients, as evidenced by improved symptomatology, electrophysiological function, and physical provocation sign (12). Hence, electroacupuncture treatment is still questioned. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature to assess the relative benefits and risks of electroacupuncture treatment compared with control treatment."

            "text": "Compressive median neuropathy, also known as CTS, is the most common entrapment neuropathy at the wrist, and tingling, numbness, and pain in the median nerve distribution in the hand are typical symptoms (40). Mild-to-moderate degree CTS usually is treated by nonsurgical therapy such as wrist splinting, corticosteroid injection, acupuncture, and so on, but the evidence on the rest or modification of activity and tendon and nerve gliding regimens is unclear (41). Study reported that low-intensity electroacupuncture was antiinflammatory and relieved pain by driving the vagal-adrenal anti-inflammatory axis and by inducing vagal activation of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (42, 43). Recently, some studies (34, 35) have reported that electroacupuncture provided better clinical outcomes than other treatments. However, no guideline or consensus was established regarding\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 13 A funnel plot showing publication bias.\nwhich type of treatment was preferable to improve clinical outcomes.\nThe Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ: Symptom Severity Scale and Function Status Scale) and VAS are comparable and these validated clinical outcomes for CTS patients (44, 45). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that electroacupuncture treatment had lower VAS pain score and symptom severity scale and function status scale than the control group. The total score of symptom severity scale and function status scale was calculated, with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity, so we believed that electroacupuncture treatment could improve the patient\u2019s symptoms and function. Unfortunately, because of the small size and high heterogeneity for the symptom severity scale and function status scale, the results of studies included in our meta-analysis were of low quality. A clinical trial reported that electroacupuncture reduced pain severity by 1.9 points than the control group (P < 0.001) (46). Maeda et al. reported that VAS scores for paresthesia showed significant reductions for\nFrontiers in Surgery 11\nelectroacupuncture but not for the sham group (electroacupuncture: \u22121.3 \u00b1 1.6, P < 0.001; sham: 0.2 \u00b1 3.5, P = 0.82) (21). Moreover, a randomized clinical trial also demonstrated that there was lower VAS score in the electroacupuncture group than the control group, and this clinical trial also found that in the electroacupuncture group, the mean of the symptom severity scale and function status scale decreased significantly (P < 0.05); on the contrary, in the control group, symptom severity scale and function status scale did not show significant improvements (P = 0.154 and 0.273, respectively) (15). Similarly, Chung et al. also reported that the electroacupuncture group showed greater improvements than the control group at 17 weeks in symptom severity scale and function status scale (P = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively) (28). Our meta-analysis also demonstrated that electroacupuncture was superior to the control group, and we performed sensitivity analysis to explore the potential source of heterogeneity. We found that the study by Maeda et al. had high heterogeneity for VAS score (I2 = 58% to I2\nfrontiersin.org\n= 0%), but we found no source of heterogeneity for symptom severity scale and function status scale. We believed that this heterogeneity might come from race, different control methods, treatment time, and follow-up time.\nElectroacupuncture treatment targets local oxidative injury by enhancing endogenous Nrf2-mediated antioxidative mechanism to relieve pain and inflammation (47). Some studies have found that acupuncture and electroacupuncture can promote nerve regeneration and improve nerve function (48, 49). McCaig et al. demonstrated that electroacupuncture might promote nerve regeneration by an increase in calcium concentration, leading to the activation of nerve outgrowth and repair (50). Our metaanalysis demonstrated that electroacupuncture had shorter DML (median nerve distal motor latency), higher CMAP (compound muscle action potentials amplitude), faster thumb-carpal SCV (sensory conduction velocity), faster middle finger-carpal SCV, higher thumb-carpal SNAP (sensory nerve action potential), and faster middle finger-carpal SNAP. Similarly, Ho et al. also found that electroacupuncture treatment could improve symptomatology, grip strength, and electrophysiological function, and this study also reported that the median motor distal amplitude was significantly increased (P = 0.02) and median sensory latency was significantly shortened (P = 0.04) (12). In addition, some studies reported that electroacupuncture could increase hand grip strength (51, 52). However, our results demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the electroacupuncture group and the control group for grip and pinch clinical outcomes. According to our meta-analysis, we infer that electroacupuncture could improve electrophysiological parameters but could not increase grip and pinch clinical outcomes.\nThe results of thismeta-analysis showed that electroacupuncture is significantly more effective than control treatment (OR = 4.94, 95% CI: 3.44\u20137.08, P < 0.00001). Moreover, we also found that electroacupuncture had lower recurrence rate than control, and the radio of proximal swelling of median nerve of carpal tunnel \u226510 mm2 also was lower. In the present study, electroacupuncture improved all clinical outcomes, especially in the pain score, and these findings were relevant to the improvement of nerve conduction after electroacupuncture treatment (53). A Cochrane review also demonstrated that electroacupuncture treatment had lower pain and higher effective rate than the control group (54), which is similar to our results. Moreover, we also found that there was no significant difference between electroacupuncture treatment and the control group in terms of complications."

(3) We only consider electroacupuncture treatment as an intervention, without consideration of other details of the treatment, such as selection of acupoints and manual techniques. (4) Some results have significant heterogeneity. Although we perform the sensitivity analysis to explore the potential source of heterogeneity, there are still clinical outcomes that have not found the source of heterogeneity. Moreover, though a total of 26 randomized controlled trials with 1,698 patients were included in our study, we still needed a lot of large-sample RCTs to decrease bias and to verify the clinical outcomes. The results of this study will provide reliable and practical suggestions for acupuncture practitioners in clinical decision-making."
