Bioremediation of toxic compounds is an appellative sustainable technology with a balanced cost-effective setup. To pave the way for the potential use of Deinococcus indicus, an arsenic resistant bacterium, as a platform for arsenic bioremediation, an extensive characterization of its resistance to cellular insults is paramount. A comparative analysis of D. indicus cells grown in two rich nutrient media conditions (M53 and TGY) revealed distinct resistance patterns when cells are subjected to stress via UV-C and methyl viologen (MV). Cells grown in M53 demonstrated higher resistance to both UV-C and MV. Moreover, cells grow to higher density upon exposure to 25 mM As(V) in M53\u00a0in comparison with TGY. This analysis is pivotal for the culture of microbial species in batch culture bioreactors for bioremediation purposes. We\u00a0also demonstrate for the first time the presence of polyphosphate granules in D. indicus which are also found in a few Deinococcus species. To extend our analysis, we\u00a0also characterized DiArsC2 (arsenate reductase) involved in arsenic detoxification and structurally determined different states, revealing the structural evidence for a catalytic cysteine triple redox system. These results contribute for our understanding into the D. indicus resistance mechanism against stress conditions.\nKEYWORDS\nmetals, UV-C, oxidative stress, PolyP granules, arsenate reductase, arsenate\nIntroduction\nArsenic presents high toxicity and has been classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic element (Machado et\u00a0al., 1999; National Research Council, 2001; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). Due to the electronic configuration of its valence orbitals, it presents a unique chemical nature that allows several changes in oxidation states and bonding configurations, forming a wide diversity of inorganic and organic species (O\u2019Day, 2006).

Arsenite, As(III), is mainly present in groundwater under reducing conditions while arsenate, As(V) is present in oxidizing conditions (Bissen et\u00a0al., 2003; James et\u00a0al., 2017). As a metalloid, arsenic is a pnictogen found in group\u00a015 of the periodic table and presents high physicochemical similarities with phosphorus (Dani, 2011; Fekry et\u00a0al., 2011; Tawfik and Viola, 2011; Varadwaj et\u00a0al., 2022). The uptake of arsenate by cells follows through the phosphorus pathways mainly by phosphate transporters (Rosenberg et\u00a0al., 1977; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2014; Garbinski et\u00a0al., 2019). Arsenate (AsO4\u22123) and phosphate (PO4\u22123) share similar chemical speciation, thus as a chemical analog of phosphorus, arsenate is able to act as substrate for several enzymes, leading to harmful cellular effects (Strawn, 2018). To cope with arsenic, most living organisms have evolved mechanisms to circumvent its toxicity. Most bacterial species bear an arsenic resistance (ars) operon that encompasses at least three main core genes: (1) an arsenic responsive repressor (arsR), (2) As(III) efflux permease (arsB) and (3) arsenate reductase (arsC) (P\u00e1ez-Espino et\u00a0al., 2009; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016; Yang and Rosen, 2016). Deinococcus indicus Wt/1aT was isolated from an arsenic contaminated aquifer in West Bengal, India and it is the first known species of the Deinococcus genus able to withstand high concentrations of both arsenate and arsenite (Suresh et\u00a0al., 2004). D. indicus contains the typical arsRBC operon that encodes two regulatory proteins (ArsR1 and ArsR2), two arsenate reductases (ArsC2 and ArsC3) and an arsenite efflux pump protein (ArsB). Besides this ars operon, it also encodes an additional arsenate reductase, ArsC1 (Suresh et\u00a0 al., 2004; Tawfik and Viola, 2011; Ranganathan et\u00a0al., 2023).\nThe Deinococcus genus is widespread in the environment, colonizing extreme habitats such as deserts, hot springs and polar regions (Hirsch et\u00a0al., 2004; De Groot et\u00a0al., 2005; Makk et\u00a0al., 2016; Jin et\u00a0al., 2019). Members of this genus present high resistance to radiation and desiccation (Jin et\u00a0al., 2019). Nevertheless, with the exception of Deinococcus radiodurans, the model organism for radiation resistance, and Deinococcus geothermalis, a biofilm forming organism that heavily affects the paper industry, most Deinococcus sp. have been poorly characterized to date (Kolari et\u00a0 al., 2001, 2003; Peltola et\u00a0al., 2008; Slade and Radman, 2011; Gerber et\u00a0al., 2015; Lim et\u00a0al., 2019). D. radiodurans and D. geothermalis have shown high efficiency in the detoxification of toxic materials (Brim et\u00a0al., 2000, 2003; Misra et\u00a0al., 2012; Choi et\u00a0al., 2017; Manobala et\u00a0al., 2019). Nonetheless, before exploring the bioremediation capabilities of an organism, the characterization of its resistance to cellular insults is imperative. Moreover, the analysis of culture conditions is vital for the application of microbial species in batch bioreactors for toxic waste removal (Tekere, 2019). So far, D. indicus ability to survive under UV-B radiation was evaluated and no information is available regarding oxidative stress resistance (Suresh et\u00a0al., 2004).\nHere, D. indicus resistance to UV-C, oxidative stress and arsenate was investigated in two rich nutritional media (M53 and TGY). Interestingly, a media-dependent response was observed for UV-C and methyl viologen (MV) damage, with D. indicus presenting higher resistance in M53. Upon exposure to As(V), D. indicus was able to grow in the presence of 25 mM of As(V) and to tolerate 50 mM of As(V) while D. radiodurans had its growth compromised in the presence of 50 fold lower concentration. Polyphosphate granules have been shown to be\u00a0involved in heavy metal detoxification in different\nmicroorganisms, and indeed elemental analysis by cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) revealed the presence of prominent polyphosphate granules in D. indicus. To extend our understanding of arsenic resistance in D. indicus, the crystal structure of DiArsC2 arsenate reductase was determined in two states: native and bound to arsenic."

For all assays, cells were grown at 30\u00b0C and 150 rpm agitation; for solid cultures, 1.5% (w/v) agar-agar (Carl Roth) was added. For each assay, two sequential subcultures were grown for 14\u201316 h prior to the final culture. Final cultures were diluted to an early-exponential phase either (Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2) for arsenate exposure growth curves and STEM-EDX or (OD600\u00a0 = 0.5) for oxidative stress, in-plate arsenate stress and UV assays.\nOxidative and arsenate stress response\nOxidative and arsenate stress assays were performed by adapting the disk diffusion method (Bauer et\u00a0al., 1966; Hudzicki, 2012). Briefly, 400 \u03bcl of cells grown in either M53 or TGY (at an OD600\u00a0= 2) were evenly spread on the surface of an agar plate (120.5 \u00d7 120.5 mm) using a cotton swab and allowed to dry for 15 min before the application of the disks (6 mm, PRAT DUMAS). Afterwards, oxidative stress inducer compounds or arsenic (20 \u03bcl) were applied on top of the disk in increasing concentrations. Plates were incubated for 3 days and halos were measured using Fiji/ImageJ (Schindelin et\u00a0 al., 2012). Oxidative stress compounds: (1) Methyl viologen dichloride, MV (C12H14Cl2N2\u00b7 xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich); (2) Hydrogen peroxide 30% (w/w), H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich). Arsenic stress compound: sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate 98%, As(V), (HAsNa2O4 \u00b7 7H2O, Sigma Aldrich).\nUV-C radiation survival curves\nUltraviolet (UV) irradiations were performed at UV-C (254 nm) with a fluence of 3 mW/cm2 throughout the assay. Fluence was assessed using a MS-100 optical radiometer with a MS 125 UVC sensor (Ultra-Violet Products, Upland, CA). D. indicus cells grown in either M53 and TGY (at an OD600\u00a0= 2) were serially diluted and plated in duplicate for each dose. Plates were air dried for 15 min and placed under the UV lamp to be\u00a0 exposed from 300 to 1800 J/m2 (in increments of 300 J/m2 which corresponds to an exposure of 10 s). Afterwards, plates were incubated for 3 days and the colony forming\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\nunits (CFU) were assessed. The average CFU mL\u22121 of non-irradiated sample aliquots represented 100% survival. The surviving fraction at a given dose is the average CFU mL\u22121 from each irradiated sample (N) divided by the average CFU mL\u22121 of the non-irradiated sample (N0). Survival curves were obtained by plotting the logarithm of N/N0 versus the dose. To determine the survival curve parameters, the multi-hit model was applied (equation 1), S(D) = Survival fraction (where 1 is 100%); D = Dose (J/m2); K = inactivation constant and n = extrapolation number (obtained by the intercept of the extrapolated semi-log straight-line), (Severin et\u00a0al., 1983; Kowalski et\u00a0al., 2000; Kowalski, 2009). For statistical intercomparison of the different D10 values extrapolated from the survival curves of M53 and TGY a Student\u2019s t-test was used and \u03a1\u00a0 \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant (De La Vega et\u00a0al., 2005).\nS D e kD n ( ) = \u2212 \u2212( )\u22121 1 (1)\nArsenic resistance growth curves\nArsenic resistance was assessed by adding As(V) to broth cultures (OD600\u00a0= 0.3) for both M53 and TGY. D. indicus cells were incubated with 10, 25 and 50 mM while D. radiodurans was incubated with 0.05, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mM of As(V). Growth curves were obtained by plotting the measured OD600 versus time.\nSEM of Deinococcus indicus\nDeinococcus indicus cells were grown in M53 or TGY in 24 well plates for 3 days at 30\u00b0C. Grown cells were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and applied over a lamella. Samples were fixed using a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, samples were washed 3 times with 0.1 M of sodium cacodylate buffer and dehydrated by sequential washing with increasing concentration of ethanol solutions (50, 70, 90, and 100%). Ethanol was removed and tert-butyl alcohol was added. Samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min followed by 1 h in a vacuum desiccator and kept at room temperature until the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed. Samples were incubated for 10 min with 2% solution of osmium tetroxide and gold sputtered with 8 nm gold in an electron sputter (Cressington 108). Imaging was performed using a Hitachi TM3030Plus scanning electron microscope, at 1.5 kV.\nSTEM imaging and EDX of Deinococcus indicus\nDeinococcus indicus cells were grown in M53 broth media (OD600 of 0.3) and washed twice with M53 at 4000 rpm, 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, cells were diluted to an appropriated concentration and 4\u00a0\u03bcL deposited onto a glow-discharged Quantifoil copper grid. The grids were blotted, and plunged into liquid ethane with an automated plunger (EM-GP, Leica Microsystems). STEM imaging was performed under cryogenic conditions with a field-emission Talos F200X (S)TEM microscope\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 200 kV accelerating voltage (extraction voltage 3,850 V, gun lens 4, spot size 9), with a condenser aperture of 70 \u03bcm in microprobe mode with a semi convergence angle of 2.1 mrad. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed using an energy dispersive spectrometer encompassing a Super-X G2 detector that features 4 silicon drift detector (SDDs) for substantially enhanced sensitivity, which is critical for trace element detection, with 8\u00a0\u03bcs dwell time per pixel, and dispersion of 5 eV per channel. Acquired images and EDX data were processed using Velox\u2122 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) software followed by analysis in ImageJ (Schindelin et\u00a0al., 2012).\nCo-localized Deinococcus indicus-granule size metrics\nTo identify D. indicus cells and the granules residing within them, grids were imaged using a Talos Arctica 200 kV FEG STEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) applying the same settings described above with a few variations: spot size 4, camera length 160 mm and 6.66 nm pixel size with 1 \u03bcs dwell time per pixel. To quantify the size and distribution of granules within the bacteria, we\u00a0used tiling and stitching images taken using TFS Tomography software to cover large field of view with multiple bacteria. Stitching was done using Fiji Grid/Collection stitching plugin (Preibisch et\u00a0al., 2009). Segmentation of the individual bacteria and individual granules residing within them was performed and the number of granules and their average and total size within each bacterium was measured. To segment the bacteria and granules, we\u00a0 used a workflow combining Ilastik (Berg et\u00a0 al., 2019), pixel classifier followed by further processing using dedicated Fiji macro (Schindelin et\u00a0al., 2012). We\u00a0used multiple fields of view from different conditions for training two-stage machine-learning classifier in Ilastik \u201cautocontext\u201d approach to classify pixels into four categories: bacteria, granules, background and unclassified. The trained classifier was applied to the stitched images in Fiji (Schindelin et\u00a0al., 2012). Bacteria were segmented based on connected component analysis of a filled mask of all pixels classified as bacteria, followed by size (1.6 < size [\u03bcm2] < 6) and shape filtering (circularity >0.2). Granules were then segmented based on connected component analysis of a mask of all pixels classified as granules within segmented bacteria and further filtered by size (0.012 < size [\u03bcm2] < 0.12) and shape (circularity >0.3). Manual correction was applied to correct the segmentation of some missed or falsely detected bacteria. The size and number of all valid bacteria and granules were extracted and analyzed.\nSequence alignment and phylogenetic tree\nMultiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (Thompson et\u00a0al., 1994). Aligned sequences were used as input and the phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum likelihood (ML) in IQ-TREE2 (version 2.2.2.6) (Minh et\u00a0al., 2020), software with the mod LG + G4 substitution model. The model was selected by running the first tree using the model finder option (Kalyaanamoorthy et\u00a0 al., 2017). The final tree was generated by performing bootstrap analysis of 1,000 data sets and was treated and displayed using the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) (version 6) web service (Letunic and Bork, 2021).\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org"

Cells were disrupted by 5 cycles of freeze and thaw, and the soluble fraction containing overexpressed DiArsC2 was obtained by centrifugation at 25,931 x\u00a0g, 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded onto a His Trap excel column (Cytiva) using as binding buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mM imidazole, and the elution buffer was 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 1 M imidazole. DiArsC2 eluted at 300 mM of imidazole and was further loaded onto a desalting column (Hipreptm 26/10 Desalting, Cytiva) using 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v). Afterward, the DiArsC2 His-tag was cleaved by adding Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease (Sigma) at 12\u00b0C with gentle shaking for 14 h. DiArsC2 was loaded onto His Trap excel (Cytiva) using the same buffers as described above. The final purification step was done by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, Cytiva), with the buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7 and 250 mM NaCl. The protein was pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and concentrated to 21 mg/mL prior to being used for crystallization trials.\nCrystallization and X-ray diffraction data collection\nCrystallization screens for DiArsC2 were setup at the nL scale in a Crystallization Robot Mosquito LCP (SPT Labtech) with triple sitting drop\u00a0 96-well plate (TTP Labtech) and using commercial screens Structure 1 and 2 (Molecular Dimensions). Needle- and platelike crystals appeared in several conditions, three of which were selected for further optimization: #37 (0.2 M Sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000); #46 (0.05 M Potassium phosphate monobasic and 20% (w/v) PEG 8000); and #47 (15% (w/v) PEG1500). These were optimized by vapor diffusion using 2 \u03bcl hanging drops equilibrated against 500 \u03bcl reservoir solution in XRL 24-well crystallization plates (Molecular Dimensions), at 20 and 4\u00b0C with varying ratios of protein and crystallization solution in each drop. For the final optimized crystallization condition, a ratio of 1:1 (protein to crystallization solution) with 0.2 M Sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 20% (w/v) PEG 4000 for DiArsC2 native (henceforth referred to as DiArsC2) at 4\u00b0C. In the case of DiArsC2 bound to arsenic (DiArsC2-As), a ratio of 1:0.8 (protein to crystallization solution) was used using 0.2 M Sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, plus 0.2 \u03bcl of 0.1 M As(V) at 20\u00b0C. DiArsC2 crystals appeared after 7 days while DiArsC2-As crystals appeared after 3 days. Crystals were dipped in a cryoprotecting solution that consisted of the crystallization buffer\nsupplemented with 10% (v/v) PEG 400 and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\nStructure determination, refinement, and quality assessment\nDiArsC2 crystals were initially screened in-house using Cu K\u03b1 radiation with 1.5418 \u00c5 wavelength in a Bruker AXS Proteum Pt135 CCD detector system coupled to an Incoatec Microfocus X-ray Source with Montel mirrors. Bruker Proteum software package were used to process and scale the images. The structure was solved by Molecular Replacement using MORDA (Vagin and Lebedev, 2015) and using as phasing model the structure of arsenate reductase from Bacillus subtilis (PDB code: 1JL3) (Bennett et\u00a0 al., 2001). In addition DiArsC2-As crystal was also tested in-house and the structure was solved by PHASER (McCoy et\u00a0al., 2007) in the PHENIX suite (Adams et\u00a0 al., 2010; Liebschner et\u00a0 al., 2019) using the DiArsC2 as phasing model.\nDiffraction data to higher resolution were collected at the XALOC beamline BL13 of the ALBA Synchrotron (Barcelona, Spain) (Juanhuix et\u00a0al., 2014). The images were processed with autoPROC (Vonrhein et\u00a0al., 2011), which makes use of XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and the CCP4 suite (Potterton et\u00a0 al., 2003) for integration and conversion of integrated intensities to structure factors. Each dataset was integrated with XDS, followed by POINTLESS (Evans, 2011) for space-group determination, scaling and merging with AIMLESS and application of an anisotropic resolution cut-off at CC1/2\u00a0< 0.3 with STARANISO (Tickle et\u00a0al., 2018). The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P21 and contained two molecules per asymmetric unit, as estimated by the Mathews coefficient probability (Matthews, 1968; Kantardjieff and Rupp, 2003). The data processing statistics are given in Supplementary Table S1. Higher resolution crystallographic structures for both DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As were determined by molecular replacement using PHASER-MR (McCoy et\u00a0al., 2007) via the CCP4 Graphics User Interface (Potterton et\u00a0al., 2003) or PHENIX Suite (Adams et\u00a0 al., 2010; Liebschner et\u00a0 al., 2019), and using the DiArsC2-As structure obtained from the in-house data as the phasing model. For DiArsC2, an initial refinement was done with REFMAC (Murshudov et\u00a0 al., 1997) and continued with PHENIX.REFINE (Terwilliger et\u00a0al., 2007; Adams et\u00a0al., 2010; Afonine et\u00a0al., 2012) while for DiArsC2-As refinements were done using PHENIX. REFINE. Throughout the refinement, the model was periodically checked and corrected with COOT against \u03c3A-weighted 2|Fo|-|Fc| and |Fo|-|Fc| electron-density maps. Solvent molecules were added manually by inspection of electron-density maps in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). TLS (translation-libration-screw) reciprocal space refinement was carried out for both structures. Hydrogen atoms were included in calculated positions with the PHENIX.READYSET tool and isotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms. The final structures were validated using MOLPROBITY (Chen et\u00a0al., 2010). Refinement statistics are given in Supplementary Table S2. Structure factors and associated structure coordinates of DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As were deposited in the Protein Data bank (Berman et\u00a0al., 2003) with accession code 8P6M and 8P5N, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).\nA simple ensemble refinement protocol in PHENIX was run for both final structures DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As considering one\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\ndomain per independent molecule in the asymmetric unit, of the crystal structure, and using 80% of the non-hydrogen atoms to include in the TLS fitting of the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from a previous refinement with isotropic ADPs (Burnley et\u00a0al., 2012). The secondary structure was determined running PROCHECK within CCP4 Graphics User Interface (Laskowski et\u00a0al., 1993; Potterton et\u00a0al., 2003). Figures of the structures were prepared using PyMOL (Delano, 2022)."

To evaluate D. indicus tolerance, we\u00a0subjected the cells grown in M53 and TGY to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and methyl viologen (MV). MV is known to catalyze the formation of superoxide anion (O2\u2022-), (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1999; Halliwell, 2006). D. indicus cells presented higher resistance to H2O2 than to MV in both media (Figure\u00a01). Upon exposure to MV, cells grown in M53 showed higher resistance than the ones grown in TGY. In fact, at 20 mM of MV, cells in M53 were neither inhibited nor had their cell growth compromised. However, the same was not observed when directly applying H2O2, in which case the cells responded in the same way independently of the culture medium\n(Figure\u00a01B). D. indicus cells were also exposed to UV-C irradiation. It is known that when UV radiation is applied to microbial populations a slight delay is often observed before the onset of an exponential decay (Cerf, 1977; Munakata et\u00a0al., 1991; Pruitt and Kamau, 1993; Kowalski et\u00a0al., 2000; Kowalski, 2009). This effect is usually named as a shoulder curve due to its shape and for this reason the multi-hit model was applied to determine curve parameters and extrapolate the D10 (i.e., the dose required to yield 10% survival) for the cells grown in both culture media (Severin et\u00a0 al., 1983; Kowalski et\u00a0 al., 2000; Kowalski, 2009). Interestingly, in M53 cells exhibited significant higher resistance to UV-C in contrast to the ones grown in TGY (Figure\u00a02). This was verified by calculating the D10 values (\u03a1\u00a0\u2264 0.05): in M53 a dose of 809 \u00b1 66 J/m2 (30s exposure) is required to eliminate 90% of cells, while in TGY 619 \u00b1 82 J/m2 (20s exposure) was sufficient to achieve the same result."

To evaluate its ability to cope with higher concentrations of As(V), D. indicus and D. radiodurans (non-arsenic resistant specie) were exposed to As(V) in their early exponential growth phase (OD600\u00a0= 0.3). D. indicus was able to grow in the presence of 25 mM As(V) in both media cultures. However, an extended lag phase was observed and at 50 mM As(V),\nFIGURE\u00a01 Survival of D. indicus at mid-exponential phase (OD600\u00a0= 2.0) to different oxidative stress conditions.

Nevertheless, cells harvested and applied to fresh media were able to recover their growth in normal conditions (Supplementary Figure S1). Regarding D. radiodurans, different As(V) concentrations were tested, namely 0.05, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mM, our results show that in the presence of 5, 10, or 20 mM, the cells are not able to recover the growth after 24H (Figure\u00a03B). Cells were only able to display normal growth in 50 \u03bcM As(V), a 500-fold lower concentration than applied to D. indicus. When exposed to 1 mM, an evident decrease in growth was observed (Figure\u00a03B). This observation was more evident in cells grown in TGY than for those grown in M53.\nTo further assess their resistance to As(V) in a solid matrix, D. indicus and D. radiodurans were exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenate ranging from 200 mM to 1 M (Figure\u00a04). Interestingly, in the solid matrix D. indicus was not fully inhibited by 1 M of As(V) in either culture medium. Nevertheless, partial inhibition halos (reduction of cellular density) were observed in cells grown in M53 upon submission to 600 mM to 1 M of As(V). In contrast, D. radiodurans is inhibited by 200 mM of arsenate (Figure\u00a04).\nSEM of Deinococcus indicus\nPreviously, it was demonstrated that D. indicus presents growth media-induced morphotypes displaying a reversible behavior from single cells to multi-cell chain morphology (Chauhan et\u00a0al., 2019b). To explore this capacity and understand if differences in morphotypes account for the behavior disparities observed against cell insults, D. indicus grown in M53 and TGY media were observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM data revealed small\ndifferences on the size of the cells, where D. indicus grown in TGY presented slightly lower cell lengths. However, no differences in cell chain clustering were observed (Figure\u00a05). Nevertheless, the addition of 500 \u03bcM MnCl2 seems to affect cells grown in TGY, where cell septation is compromised and cell length is vastly increased (Supplementary Figure S2).\nCryo-STEM EDX of Deinococcus indicus\nPolyphosphate-like granules (pPLGs) are known to be\u00a0involved in the sequestration of cation ions as well as in heavy-metal detoxification (Peverly et\u00a0 al., 1978; Urech et\u00a0 al., 1978; Scott and Palmer, 1990; Keasling, 1997; Kulakovskaya, 2018). D. radiodurans, Deinococcus murrayi and Deinococcus proteolyticus present pPLGs in their native compositions, but no information is available for D. indicus (Thornley et\u00a0 al., 1965; Sleytr et\u00a0 al., 1976; Ferreira et\u00a0 al., 1997; Eltsov and Dubochet, 2005; Copeland et\u00a0al., 2012). Wolf et\u00a0al. (2015) was carried out to image D. indicus in native conditions at the early-exponential phase in M53 medium. Through the ImageJ macro previously trained using ilastik \u201cautocontext\u201d approach, we\u00a0were able to rapidly quantify and segment D. indicus cells and their granules using Cryo-STEM stitched images (Figure\u00a06A). We\u00a0observed a wide heterogeneity of electron dense granules distribution ranging from 0 to 8 granules per cell (Figure\u00a06B). Overall, from the 435 cells analyzed 31.8% of the cells had no granules, followed by 17.2% of the cells containing 1 or 2 granules. Only 1.4 and 0.5% of the cells contained 7 and 8 granules, respectively (Figure\u00a0 6B). The average granule area (n\u00a0 = 803) was 0.040 \u00b1 0.019 \u03bcm2 with the smallest granules measuring 0.012 \u03bcm2 while the biggest granule measuring 0.107 \u03bcm2 (Figure\u00a0 6C).

The main counter ion found was magnesium (Supplementary Table S3).\nDiArsC2 (arsenate reductase) phylogenetic analysis\nIn order to explore the difference between the two species, D. radiodurans and D. indicus, to the arsenate resistance we\u00a0analyzed the arsenate reductases that belong to the ars operon, which are able to convert As(V) into As(III) (Mukhopadhyay and Rosen, 2002). It is predicted that D. indicus possesses three genes that encode cytosolic arsenate reductases, DiArsC1, DiArsC2, and DiArsC3 while D. radiodurans possesses two arsenate reductases, DrArsC1 and DrArsC2 (Figure\u00a08). There are three families of cytosolic arsenate reductases: one belongs to the E. coli R773 plasmid and comprises glutaredoxin (Grx)-coupled enzymes, while another class belongs to the Staphylococcus aureus Plasmid pI258 comprising the thioredoxin (Trx)-coupled enzymes (Ji et\u00a0al., 1994; Oden et\u00a0al., 1994; Shi et\u00a0al., 1999; Messens et\u00a0al., 2002a; Messens and Silver, 2006) and the final class belongs to eukaryotic organisms, encompassing the ACR2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mukhopadhyay and Rosen, 1998; Mukhopadhyay et\u00a0 al., 2000). A sequence analysis of the different\nprotein sequence, shows that the three arsenate reductases from D. indicus, DiArsC1, DiArsC2 and DiArsC3 belong to three branches (Figure\u00a08). Interestingly, DiArsC1 and DrArsC1 branch closely to the E. coli ArsC from the Grx-linked prokaryotic family (Figure\u00a0 8; Gladysheva et\u00a0al., 1994; Rosen, 1999). DiArsC3 and DrArsC2 branch closely to Thermus thermophilus ArsC that belongs to the Trx-linked prokaryotic ArsC reductases family. DiArsC2 branch closely to Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 ArsC3 (Nunes et\u00a0al., 2014), which are in the main branch with S. aureus pI258 ArsC (Ji et\u00a0al., 1994; Rosen, 1999; Figure\u00a08). Since DiArsC2 did not cluster together with any of D. radiodurans ArsCs, we\u00a0decided to further unveil the structural mechanism for arsenate detoxification.\nDiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As structural insights\nThe crystal structures of DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As were determined and refined at resolutions of 1.65 and 1.50 \u00c5, respectively. The space group of both crystal structures is P21, presenting two molecules in the asymmetric unit. DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As structures were refined to final Rfactor/Rfree values of 0.224/0.254 and 0.152/0.172, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The superposition of both chains based on the secondary structure matching algorithm yields a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.6 \u00c5 between the superimposed C\u03b1 carbon atoms and 127 aligned amino acid residues.\nFIGURE\u00a03 Growth curves in TGY and M53 media cultures of Deinococcus cells exposed to increasing concentrations of As(V) at an early exponential phase (OD600\u00a0= 0.3).

In fact, in DiArsC2 it was not possible to build the protein chain between the residues 89\u201396 for Chain A and 89\u201393 for Chain B (Figure\u00a09B). Thus, the structural analysis for both structures were performed with Chain B. Ensemble refinements (Burnley et\u00a0al., 2012) were performed for DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As (leading to Rfactor/Rfree values of 0.221/0.255 and 0.160/0.177 respectively) where the most flexible regions were residues 31\u201336 and the loop\u00a086\u201397 that contains the two conserved cysteines (Cys87 and Cys94) involved in As(V) reduction (Figures\u00a09C, 10). The loop that contains the conserved catalytic Cys15 does not show a high degree of structural flexibility between the two structures here presented. DiArsC2 structures are composed of an \u03b1/\u03b2 domain and four parallel \u03b2-strands which are flanked by three helices and two small helices (Figures\u00a010, 11). These crystal structures are similar to the arsenate reductases from B. subtilis (Bennett et\u00a0al., 2001), (PDB 1JL3) and S. aureus, (PDB 1LJL) (Messens et\u00a0 al., 2002b). The crystal structures of DiArsC2 and DiArsC2-As presented an r.m.s.d. value of 1.3 \u00c5 with 127 aligned amino acid residues with the arsenate reductases from B. subtilis (Bennett et\u00a0al., 2001) (PDB 1JL3).

Oxidative stress analysis revealed that different culture conditions promote dissimilar responses to oxidative stress agents, and D. indicus presents a higher resistance to MV when grown in M53 than in TGY, while the same resistance pattern is observed in both media when exposing the cells to H2O2. Interestingly, D. indicus cells are more resistant to H2O2 than to MV. In bacteria, an increase in the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalases has been observed upon exposure to arsenic (Weiss et\u00a0al., 2009; Ciprandi et\u00a0al., 2012; Belfiore et\u00a0al., 2013; Andres and Bertin, 2016; Shah and Damare, 2018). It is predicted that D. indicus has two superoxide dismutases (SOD), a MnSOD (accession number: GHG29236.1) a Cu/Zn SOD (accession number GHG15276.1) and one catalase (accession number: GHG14730.1). Moreover, both the superoxide anion and H2O2 can damage proteins containing iron sulfur clusters with the release of Fe2+ that can react with hydrogen peroxide, leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction (Koppenol, 1993; Valentine et\u00a0al., 1998; Kehrer, 2000; Kohen and Nyska, 2002). D. indicus also possesses one DNA-binding protein under starved conditions, Dps (accession number: GHG25447.1). D. radiodurans Dps proteins are known to sequester iron and manganese (Ishikawa et\u00a0al., 2003; Santos et\u00a0al., 2015). D. indicus Dps presents high identity (75.5%) with DrDps1 which is known to utilize hydrogen peroxide for the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+(Santos et\u00a0al., 2015). In addition, it has been previously reported that D. radiodurans protein extracts present a higher ROS scavenging ability than in E. coli, namely 30 fold-higher for H2O2 and 6 fold higher for O2.- (Tian et\u00a0al., 2004).\nSo far, there is no information regarding UV-C resistance of D. indicus. In fact, D. indicus was screened for UV-B when first isolated by Suresh and co-workers, presenting 2\u20134% survival at 50000 J/m2 in nutrient broth media (Suresh et\u00a0 al., 2004). Here, we\u00a0showed that UV-C resistance in D. indicus is media-dependent: cells grown in M53 require a dose of 809 \u00b1 66 J/m2 to eliminate 90% of cells, while cells grown in TGY required a lower dose of 619 \u00b1 82 J/m2.\nMoreover, D. indicus cells grown in M53 were also more resistant than the ones in TGY when subjected to MV. Interestingly, it has been previously reported that D. radiodurans response to UV-C exposure is also media-dependent (Chen et\u00a0al., 2023). We\u00a0can postulate that this media dependent response to MV and UV-C could indicate similar resistance mechanisms are in place and they act in a media dependent way, however the molecular mechanisms involved need to be\u00a0further investigated.\nPreviously, it was demonstrated that D. indicus Wt/1aT can survive to 10 mM of arsenate As(V) (Suresh et\u00a0al., 2004). To further extend arsenic resistance characterization, herein we\u00a0showed that D. indicus is able to reach control conditions in the presence of 25 mM of As(V). Interestingly, in M53 medium and in the presence of 10 mM and 25 mM of arsenate, cells presented higher OD600 compared to control conditions, while the same behavior was not observed in TGY. This could be\u00a0due to higher resistance to oxidative stress conditions, or perhaps other transcripts are modulated when cells are grown in M53. Moreover, an extended lag phase in the presence of 25 mM of arsenate before resuming normal growth was observed in both media although it was more pronounce when the cells were grown in TGY. This is a fairly common effect, for instance, methylmercury acetate causes an extended lag-phase on Rhodopseudomonas capsulata before resumption of normal growth (Nielsen and Sojka, 1979; Brochiero et\u00a0al., 1984; Jaiganesh et\u00a0al., 2012; Aljerf and AlMasri, 2018). In\nE. coli, cadmium quantum dots caused a longer lag-phase until normal proliferation was restored (Jaiganesh et\u00a0al., 2012). Moreover, D. indicus growth was suppressed by the presence of 50 mM of As(V). However, upon As(V) removal, D. indicus was able to restore normal growth conditions. In this case, an extended lag-phase similar to post-antibiotic effect (PAE) noted on antibiotic applications was also observed (Zhanel et\u00a0al., 1991; Li et\u00a0al., 2016; Srimani et\u00a0al., 2017). PAE is characterized as the time period after total removal of antibiotic during which no growth is observed. Our data for arsenic resistance is consistent with that for D. indicus strain DR1 isolated from the wetlands of Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India (Chauhan et\u00a0al., 2017, 2019a). Regarding D. radiodurans, no lag phase was observed upon exposure to 0.5 and 1 mM of As(V), even though cell growth was compromised. No differences were observed between media cultures in D. radiodurans and the same pattern was verified by exposing the cells to As(V) in a solid matrix. In contrast, D. indicus is able to survive up to 1 M of As(V) in solid matrix.\nSince D. indicus presents higher resistance to MV, UV-C and a faster response and growth in M53 when submitted to As(V), a STEM-EDX analysis was performed. Here we\u00a0reported for the first time the presence of polyphosphate-like granules (pPLGs) in D. indicus. Moreover, more than 30% of the cells contained no granules while a few cells contained up to 8 granules. This high heterogeneity reveals high plasticity in PolyP granules of D. indicus cells, and could indicate that cells adopt specific roles in the community, specializing in PolyP storage to gain an advantage upon environmental changes. pPLGs are also known to be\u00a0 involved in heavy-metal detoxification (Pan-Hou et\u00a0al., 2001, 2002; Alvarez and Jerez, 2004; Ruiz et\u00a0al., 2011; Orell et\u00a0al., 2012; Jasso-Ch\u00e1vez et\u00a0al., 2019; Sanz-Luque et\u00a0 al., 2020). In Anabaena cylindrica a higher accumulation of aluminum was observed on cells exhibiting pPLGs that were grown in a phosphate-rich medium (Annette et\u00a0al., 1985). It is known that polyphosphate kinases (PPKs) are involved in the formation of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) and pPLGs (Kornberg, 1999). In E. coli, higher resistance to Hg2+ was observed after the introduction of ppk into the merA-deleted mer operon (Pan-Hou et\u00a0al., 2001, 2002). Moreover, it was proposed that polyP was involved in conversion of Hg2+ to a less toxic molecule via chelation mechanisms (Pan-Hou et\u00a0 al., 2001, 2002). Nevertheless, further analysis of D. indicus ability to utilize polyP for arsenic detoxification is required, especially since D. radiodurans also presents pPLGs and is sensitive to arsenic. It would be\u00a0vital to understand if D. indicus pPLGs aid on the detoxification of arsenic either being directly involved or indirectly.\nIn order to complement our studies and to further understand the resistance to arsenate by D. indicus the arsenate reductase DiArsC2 was chosen since it did not cluster with any of ArsC from D. radiodurans. Thus, we\u00a0undertook the structural studies of DiArsC2 and we\u00a0were able to crystallize two different forms of the enzyme: native (DiArsC2) and bound to arsenite (DiArsC2-As). The crystal structures present high similarities with the B. subtillis ArsC that belongs to the Trx-linked family (Bennett et\u00a0al., 2001). Based on the conservation of the 3 cysteines (Cys15, Cys87, and Cys94) (Figure\u00a010) and structural analysis (Figures\u00a09, 11), we\u00a0 infer the As(V) mechanism of reduction is identical to the one proposed for B. subtillis, i.e., a triple redox system (Bennett et\u00a0al., 2001). The DiArsc2-As structure represents the final stage, where Cys15 is bound to As(III), however the ligand cannot be\u00a0released since Cys87 forms a disulfide bridge with Cys94 (Figure\u00a011). Moreover, the arsenate is located in a positive-charged pocket which is accessible from the external environment. Since in our DiArsC2 structure the disulfide bridge between\nFrontiers in Microbiology 13 frontiersin.org\nthese two residues is not formed (at least in chain B, where density is observed) this could indicate that an As(V) reduction event already took place in the DiArsC2-As structure, leading to the formation of the Cys87 \u2013 Cys94 disulfide bridge (Figure\u00a011). The lack of mobility of the PTPase loop (where Cys15 is located) together with the high flexibility of the loop that contains Cys87 and Cys94 suggests that Cys87 is the residue responsible for the release of As(III) bound to the Cys15 (Figure\u00a09). In fact this loop is readily accessible by the thioredoxin reductase system to reduce the Cys87 \u2013 Cys94 disulfide bridge and allow a new As(V) reduction cycle to occur (Messens et\u00a0al., 1999; Bennett et\u00a0al., 2001). It would be\u00a0 interesting to assess whether the presence of Cys87\u00a0 in the DiArsC2 structure is essential for the ligation of As(V). Moreover, the mutation of Cys87 could allow DiArsC2 to be\u00a0used has a tool for of As(V) removal by inhibiting the release of As(III)."

D. indicus is an arsenic resistant organism belonging to Deinococcaceae family that present high resistant to UV radiation. Here we\u00a0performed a characterization of stress resistance of D. indicus and provide insights toward exploiting D. indicus as a tool for bioremediation. D. indicus exhibited a media-dependent response upon exposure to UV-C and MV, and demonstrated higher resistance in M53 compared to TGY. Moreover, cells grown in M53 upon exposure to 25 mM As(V) exhibited higher growth (OD600). This may indicate that optimization of culture conditions could lead to a higher resistance to cellular insults including arsenic stress. Using STEM-EDX we\u00a0were able to detect the presence of polyphosphate granules in D. indicus. Nevertheless, more studies are required to infer the potential utilization as a path for the detoxification process via arsenic bioaccumulation. Additionally, the D. indicus ars operon contains two arsenate reductases (DiArsC2 and DiArsC3). The DiArsC2 structure revealed detailed insights into the molecular mechanism of the arsenate reduction, in which As(V) is converted to As(III) and remains bound to Cys15. These findings, contribute to the knowledge to apply D. indicus in bioremediation of arsenic either by following a cell-based approach or at the protein level using DiArsC has a tool to remove As(V)."
