    "abstractText": "We perform the first calculation of form factors in the semileptonic decays B\u2192D1(2420)`\u03bd` and B \u2192 D\u2032 1(2430)`\u03bd` using QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) with B-meson distribution amplitudes. In this calculation the c-quark mass is finite. Analytical expressions for two-particle contributions up to twist four are obtained. To disentangle the D1 and D\u2032 1 contributions in the LCSRs, we suggest a novel approach that introduces a combination of two interpolating currents for these charmed mesons. To fix all the parameters in the LCSRs, we use the two-point QCD sum rules for the decay constants of D1 and D\u2032 1 mesons augmented by a single experimental input, that is the B \u2192 D1(2420)`\u03bd` decay width. We provide numerical results for all B \u2192 D1 and B \u2192 D\u2032 1 form factors. As a byproduct, we also obtain the D1and D\u2032 1-meson decay constants and predict the leptonflavour universality ratios R(D1) and R(D\u2032 1).",

            "text": "The B \u2192 D`\u03bd` and B \u2192 D\u2217`\u03bd` weak semileptonic decays have been broadly studied in the last decades (for a recent review see, e.g., ref. [1]). The predictions of observables in these decays critically depend on our knowledge of the corresponding hadronic form factors. The B \u2192 D(\u2217) form factors are calculated in lattice QCD with a continuously increasing accuracy [2]. These form factors can also be obtained from QCD sum rules, where the most advanced computations are in refs. [3\u20135]. In addition, in the heavy-mass limit \u2014 that is for mc,mb \u2192\u221e \u2014 the B \u2192 D(\u2217) form factors are constrained and normalized at the zero recoil point corresponding to the maximal momentum transfer to the leptons. Less explored from both the theoretical and the experimental sides are the B-meson semileptonic transitions to the lowest lying excited charmed mesons D\u22170, D (\u2032) 1 , D\u22172 with the spin-parity JP = 0+, 1+, 2+, respectively. Nonetheless, an accurate knowledge of the\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nform factors of these transitions is important for several reasons. Firstly, there is a long standing problem of filling the gap between the inclusive B \u2192 Xc`\u03bd` width and the sum of the exclusive semileptonic widths dominated by the B \u2192 D`\u03bd and B \u2192 D\u2217`\u03bd modes [6]. Secondly, the constraints on the B \u2192 D(\u2217)0,1,2 form factors from the heavy-mass limit are weaker, since we do not have a normalization condition for these cases. Finally, the observed tension in the lepton-flavour universality (LFU) ratios R(D) and R(D\u2217) demands LFU tests in all channels of the exclusive b \u2192 c transitions, including B \u2192 D(\u2217)0,1,2`\u03bd`. It is therefore extremely important to calculate the form factors of B transitions to each of these excited charmed mesons. The masses and widths of the lowest four charm resonances with JP = 0+, 1+, 2+ are collected in table 1. In the heavy mass limit for the charm quark, e.g. within Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), one indeed expects four states with one unit of orbital angular momentum. Since the heavy quark spin decouples, these states fall into two (mass degenerate) spin-symmetry doublets, differing by the total angular momentum j of light degrees of freedom. One doublet with j = 1/2 consists of 0+ and 1+ states and a second doublet with j = 3/2 consists of 1+ and 2+ states. In this work we focus on the two 1+ mesons D1 and D\u20321. Again, one invokes HQET where the strong transition |j = 1/2\u3009 \u2192 |j = 1/2\u3009+ \u03c0 proceeds via S-wave whereas in the transition |j = 3/2\u3009 \u2192 |j = 1/2\u3009 + \u03c0 only the D-wave is possible, causing a kinematical suppression. Hence, the j = 1/2 state has a significantly larger total width than the j = 3/2 state [7, 8]. It is then natural to expect that the observed narrow D1 (broad D\u20321) resonance decaying to D\u2217\u03c0 is predominantly the j = 3/2 (j = 1/2) state. In reality, a mixing between the two HQET states inevitably takes place if one goes beyond the mc \u2192 \u221e limit. Note that the mixing pattern of D1 and D\u20321 in terms of HQET states is purely non-perturbative. It has been discussed in a model dependent framework (see, e.g., ref. [9] for further details). It is then desirable to calculate the B \u2192 D1 and B \u2192 D\u20321 form factors in a finite c-quark mass framework. QCD sum rules [10] have been already used to evaluate the D(\u2032)1 decay constant and the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors from two-point and three-point correlators, respectively. This was done mostly in HQET (see, e.g., refs. [11\u201314]), where the separation of the two lowest 1+ states from each other is straightforward, due to their different orbital angular momentum j. One has to choose an appropriate interpolating current with j = 1/2 or j = 3/2 and\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nconsider two separate correlators. However, for a finite c-quark mass the two 1+ states mix in the observed D1 and D\u20321 mesons, making the HQET sum rules inadequate for these mesons. Correlators with a finite c-quark mass were used in, e.g., refs. [15, 16]. Still, these calculations assume that only one 1+ lowest state is interpolated by the conventional axial current c\u0304\u03b3\u00b5\u03b35q. This is however in contradiction with HQET that predicts a second 1+ state in the same mass region, which has been confirmed by experimental data. Consequently, the assumption that only a single state is present within the duality window of a QCD sum rule cannot be justified.\nQCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) [17\u201319] opened up new possibilities to calculate the B-to-charm form factors, especially their version with B-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) proposed in refs. [20, 21]. These sum rules are derived for a finite c quark mass, which makes them suitable for our task. They can be used in principle for any charmed hadron in the final state, and not only for D and D\u2217 mesons as in, e.g., refs. [3\u20135]. Nevertheless, we encounter also in this approach the problem of defining a current that interpolates only one of the 1+ states at a time.\nIn this paper, we suggest a novel procedure to separate nearby resonances that supersedes the standard LCSR approach. This procedure consists in defining two independent currents with JP = 1+, which in general interpolate both the D1 and D\u20321 mesons. By finding a suitable linear combinations of these currents that interpolate only one 1+ state at a time, we can write down the desired LCSRs. However, these linear combinations of currents depend on four unknown decay constants (one for each meson-current combination). Using two-point QCD sum rules, we are able to determine only three out of the four decay constants. The fourth one is determined a posteriori, by using the experimental measurement of the B \u2192 D1`\u03bd` decay width. After determining this remaining unknown parameter, we predict the B \u2192 D1 and B \u2192 D\u20321 form factors. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we derive the two-point sum rules for the decay constants and fix three out of the four decay constants that enter in our calculation. In section 3 we define the dedicated interpolating currents and derive the LCSRs. In section 4 we fix the remaining unknown decay constant by fitting the expression for the B \u2192 D1`\u03bd` total decay width to its measured value. Then, we predict the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors, the D (\u2032) 1 -mesons decay constants, and the LFU ratios R(D (\u2032) 1 ). A series of appendices contain details regarding the B-meson DAs (in A), our analytical results for the LCSRs (in B), and the formulae for the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 `\u03bd` differential decay widths (in C)."

Throughout this paper we work in the isospin limit and do not distinguish the flavors of the two light quarks, whose masses are neglected. The two currents (2.2)\u2013(2.3) are linearly independent since they interpolate different states: while the current J (1)\u00b5 creates from the vacuum (apart from 0\u2212 states) 1+ states, for which the light degrees of freedom have exclusively an angular momentum of j = 1/2, the current J (2)\u00b5 interpolates, in addition, 1+ states with j = 3/2. In eq. (2.2) we also added a factor (mc +mq) to the dimension-3 operator, such that both currents have the same mass dimension. The hadronic states with spin-parity JP = 1+ contribute to both invariant amplitudes in eq. (2.1), since their contributions are proportional to the transverse combination (q2g\u00b5\u03bd + q\u00b5q\u03bd). Conversely, the pseudoscalar states \u2014 which start from D meson \u2014 contribute only to the amplitude multiplying the q\u00b5q\u03bd structure.1 Hence, we consider the invariant amplitude \u03a0(ij)(q2) to isolate the axial charmed meson contributions. We also notice that the currents J (1)\u00b5 and J (2)\u00b5 interpolate both the D1 and the D\u20321 mesons. Therefore, to extract the decay constants of these mesons, we need to consider simultaneously the three independent sum rules for the relevant correlators: \u03a0(11), \u03a0(22), and \u03a0(12) since \u03a0(12) = \u03a0(21). We express these correlators in terms of hadronic dispersion relations in section 2.1, while we compute the same correlators using an operator product expansion (OPE) in section 2.2. These two representations of the correlators are then matched. In addition, semi-global quark-hadron duality is used to remove the contribution of the continuum and further excited states. A Borel transform is then performed to reduce the systematic uncertainty due to quark-hadron duality. The procedure up to this point is a standard one [10] with many successful applications in the literature (see, e.g., the review [22]). In this article, we extend this procedure to deal with the case where there are two mesons with very close masses in the same spin-parity channel, like the D1 and the D\u20321 mesons."

In eq. (2.4)\u2013(2.6), we have isolated the ground-state resonances and attributed a generic hadronic spectral density \u03c1(ij)cont(s) to the rest of the hadronic spectrum including continuum and excited states. To make this hadronic representations more accurate, we take into account the large total width of the D\u20321 meson, replacing the zero-width resonance by a Breit-Wigner form with the energy-dependent width. After performing the Borel transform, this corresponds to the replacement of a simple exponential in eq. (2.4)\u2013(2.6) by the following expression:\ne \u2212m2 D\u20321 /M2\n\u2192 E(\u0393D\u20321 ,M 2) = \u221e\u222b sth ds e\u2212s/M 2 [ 1 \u03c0\n\u221a s\u0393D\u20321(s)\n(s\u2212m2D\u20321) 2 + s\u03932D\u20321(s)\n] .

The ansatz (2.8) can be interpreted as a result of the resummation of the D\u2217\u03c0 intermediate states strongly coupled to the D\u20321 resonance. In other words, we effectively take into account the most important D\u2217\u03c0 continuum state with the lowest threshold in the hadronic spectrum of the correlator.2 Since the spectral\n2This interpretation of the energy-dependent width for a broad \u03c1 resonance is explained, e.g., in ref.

This means that the part of the D\u2217\u03c0-state contribution above that threshold is subtracted as a part of the duality approximation. We do not apply the replacement (2.8) for the D1 meson, since its width is relatively small and hence the narrow-width limit is a reasonable approximation in this case.\nFinally, eq.

To calculate the d = 3 quark condensate terms we use the vacuum average\n\u30080|q\u0304\u03b1iqk\u03b2 |0\u3009 = 1\n4Nc \u3008q\u0304q\u3009\u03b4ki \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .\nWe find\n\u03a0(11)q\u0304q (q2) = \u3008q\u0304q\u3009 m3c\nm2c \u2212 q2 , \u03a0(12)q\u0304q (q2) = \u03a0 (22) q\u0304q (q2) = 0 . (2.18)\nNote that including the next-to-leading term in the expansion of quark field at x = 0, namely\nq\u0304(x) = q\u0304(0) + x\u00b5q\u0304(x)\u2190\u2212D\u00b5 \u2223\u2223\u2223 x=0 + 12x \u00b5x\u03bd q\u0304(x)\u2190\u2212D\u00b5 \u2190\u2212 D\u03bd \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=0 + . . . , (2.19)\ngenerates contributions in eq. (2.18) proportional to the light-quark mass and hence they can be neglected.\nThe d = 4 contributions to eq. (2.18) proportional to the gluon condensate density\n\u3008GG\u3009 \u2261 \u03b1s \u03c0 \u30080|Ga\u00b5\u03bdG\u00b5\u03bda |0\u3009\nare conveniently calculated adopting the Fock-Schwinger gauge, defined as\n(x\u2212 x0)\u00b5Aa\u00b5(x) = 0\nfor x0 = 0 (see, e.g., the reviews [26, 27]). In figure 1 we display the diagrams which provide non vanishing contributions to the gluon condensate term in the OPE. The remaining diagram where the light quark emits two gluons vanishes in the adopted limit mq = 0.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nAlso the additional diagrams for \u03a0(12),(22) with a gluon emitted from the vertex J (2)\u00b5 with covariant derivative are vanishing. The diagrams in figure 1 yield\n\u03a0(11)GG (q 2) = \u2212 112\u3008GG\u3009 m2c m2c \u2212 q2 , (2.20)\n\u03a0(12)GG (q 2) = 124(q2)2 \u3008GG\u3009m 2 c\n(( m2c \u2212 3q2 ) log ( m2c\nm2c \u2212 q2\n) \u2212 q2 ) , (2.21)\n\u03a0(22)GG (q 2) = 124(q2)2 \u3008GG\u3009\n( \u2212m2cq2 + ( \u22124m2cq2 +m4c + 3(q2)2 ) log ( m2c\nm2c \u2212 q2\n)) . (2.22)\nIn the last equation we omit the constant terms since they vanish after performing the Borel transform. The functions in eq. (2.21)\u2013(2.22) that multiply the gluon condensate\ndensities develop imaginary parts at q2 = s > m2c :\n\u03c1 (12) GG (s) =\nm2c ( m2c \u2212 3s ) 24s2 \u03b8 ( s\u2212m2c ) , (2.23)\n\u03c1 (22) GG (s) =\n( m4c \u2212 4m2cs+ 3s2 ) 24s2 \u03b8 ( s\u2212m2c ) . (2.24)\nTherefore, the gluon condensate contributions (2.21) and (2.22) can be represented in the form of an unsubtracted dispersion relation:\n\u03a0(12),(22)GG (q 2) = \u3008GG\u3009 \u221e\u222b m2c ds s\u2212 q2 \u03c1 (12),(22) GG (s) . (2.25)\nWe treat these contributions in the same way as the perturbative contributions of eq. (2.14)\u2013 (2.16), i.e. we include them into the OPE spectral density. Truncating the short-distance OPE at d = 5, we also take into account the quark-gluon condensate:\n\u3008q\u0304Gq\u3009 \u2261 \u30080|q\u0304gsGa\u00b5\u03bdta\u03c3\u00b5\u03bdq|0\u3009 = m20\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 .\nThe calculation of this contribution \u2014 although technically more complicated than for the quark condensate \u2014 is well documented in the reviews such as refs. [26, 27] and hence we do not dwell on details. We only mention that here again the diagrams with a gluon emitted from the vertex containing a covariant derivative vanish. The results for the quark-gluon condensate contributions are\n\u03a0(11)q\u0304Gq(q 2) = \u221212m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 m5c (m2c \u2212 q2)3 , \u03a0(22)q\u0304Gq(q 2) = 38m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 mc (m2c \u2212 q2) ,\n\u03a0(12)q\u0304Gq(q 2) = 112m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 mc q 2 (m2c \u2212 q2)2 .\n(2.26)\nFinally, we note that neglecting the d = 6 four-quark condensate contributions is justified because in the correlators of heavy-light currents these corrections are in general numerically negligible (for example in the sum rule for the D\u2217 decay constant of ref. [25]).\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nFollowing the standard procedure to derive a sum rule, we perform a Borel transform of the results listed in this section. We obtain the following expressions for the OPE of the three correlators to the adopted accuracy:\n\u03a0(11)OPE(M 2) = \u221e\u222b m2c ds e\u2212s/M 2 \u03c1 (11) pert(s) + [ \u3008q\u0304q\u3009m3c \u2212 1 12\u3008GG\u3009m 2 c \u2212 1 4m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 m5c M4 ] e\u2212m 2 c/M 2 ,\n(2.27)\n\u03a0(12)OPE(M 2) = \u221e\u222b m2c ds e\u2212s/M 2[ \u03c1 (12) pert(s) + \u3008GG\u3009\u03c1 (12) GG (s) ] \u2212 112m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009mc ( 1\u2212 m 2 c M2 ) e\u2212m 2 c/M 2 ,\n(2.28)\n\u03a0(22)OPE(M 2) = \u221e\u222b m2c ds e\u2212s/M 2[ \u03c1 (22) pert(s) + \u3008GG\u3009\u03c1 (22) GG (s) ] + 38m 2 0\u3008q\u0304q\u3009mce\u2212m 2 c/M 2 .

We also use semi-global quark-hadron duality to remove the contributions of the continuum and excited states encoded in the functions \u03c1(ij)cont. This implies that the upper limit of the integrals in the OPE results (2.27)\u2013(2.29) and, simultaneously, the upper limit in the expression for E(\u0393D\u20321 ,M\n2) are replaced by the respective effective thresholds s\n(ij) 0 , whose choice is discussed in section 4.

(2.32)\nSince there are only three independent sum rules for four unknown decay constants, it is not possible to determine all of them. We then consider eq. (2.30)\u2013(2.32) as a system of equations to express fD\u20321 , gD1 , and gD\u20321 as a function of fD1 . This system has four distinct solutions, which are discussed in detail in section 4. These decay constants serve as input parameters for the LCSRs, which are derived in the next section.\nEven though we cannot calculate the individual decay constants with the information inferred from the sum rules, we can still set bounds on their value. In fact, the two diagonal correlators \u03a0(11)\u00b5\u03bd and \u03a0(22)\u00b5\u03bd have positive definite spectral densities. Hence, independent of the quark-hadron duality assumption, the following model-independent upper bounds are valid for the squared decay constants (see, e.g., ref. [28] where the upper bounds for the\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nD(s) decay constants were obtained):\nf2D1 < \u03a0(11)OPE(M2)\nm4D1e \u2212m2D1/M\n2 , f 2 D\u20321\n< \u03a0(11)OPE(M2)\nm4D\u20321 E(\u0393D\u20321 ,M\n2) ,\ng2D1 < \u03a0(22)OPE(M2)\nm4D1e \u2212m2D1/M\n2 , g 2 D\u20321\n< \u03a0(22)OPE(M2)\nm4D\u20321 E(\u0393D\u20321 ,M\n2) .\n(2.33)\nThe numerical value of these bounds are presented in section 4."

            "text": "Here we derive the LCSRs with B-meson DAs for the B \u2192 D1 and B \u2192 D\u20321 form factors. This method is well established and has already been applied to several B-meson transitions. For the derivation of our sum rules we follow refs. [3, 5]. In analogy with the two-point sum rules considered in the previous section, we start by defining suitable B-to-vacuum correlators:\nF (R)\u00b5\u03bd (p, q) = i \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u30080|T { J (R)\u2020\u03bd (x), Jw\u00b5 (0) } |B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009 , (R = D1, D\u20321) . (3.1)\nHere, Jw\u00b5 = c\u0304\u03b3\u00b5(1 \u2212 \u03b35)b is the weak current with the momentum q while p + q is the momentum of the B meson state, so that (p + q)2 = m2B. The interpolating currents J (D1) \u00b5 or J (D \u2032 1)\n\u00b5 with momentum p are chosen such that they only interpolate the D1 or D\u20321 meson, respectively. This can be easily achieved by combining the decay constants defined in eq. (2.7):\nJ (D1)\u00b5 = J (1)\u00b5 \u2212 fD\u20321 gD\u20321 J (2)\u00b5 , J (D\u20321) \u00b5 = J (1)\u00b5 \u2212 fD1 gD1 J (2)\u00b5 . (3.2)\nAgain, the correlators (3.1) can be both expressed in terms of hadronic quantities and computed using \u2014 in this case \u2014 a light-cone OPE. The details of these calculations are given in section 3.1 and section 3.2, respectively. The LCSRs are then obtained by matching the results of the hadronic representation and OPE calculation and using semiglobal quark-hadron duality.\n3.1 Hadronic representation of the B-to-vacuum correlator\nTo obtain the hadronic dispersion relation for the correlators (3.1), we calculate the imaginary part with respect to the variable p2, by inserting a complete set of hadronic states in eq.

Note that our form factor definitions are analogous to the conventional definitions of the B \u2192 D\u2217 form factors of, e.g., ref. [3]. There are now one axial-vector and three independent vector form factors instead of one vector and three axial-vector form factors in the B \u2192 D\u2217 case, since the parity of the final state is opposite.

(3.8)\nHere, as in section 2.1, we take into account the width of the D\u20321 state and, for the sake of brevity, introduce a notation for the two combinations of decay constants:\nhD1 \u2261 ( fD1 \u2212\nfD\u20321 gD\u20321 gD1\n) , hD\u20321 \u2261 ( fD\u20321 \u2212\nfD1 gD1 gD\u20321\n) .\nFor future convenience, we decompose the correlator F (R)\u00b5\u03bd (p, q) in a set of independent Lorentz structures L\u00b5\u03bd(p, q) multiplied by the corresponding invariant amplitudes F (R)L (p2, q2):\nF (R)\u00b5\u03bd (p, q) = \u2211 L L\u00b5\u03bd(p, q)F (R)L (p 2, q2) . (3.9)\nFrom the above decomposition we specifically choose the Lorentz structures\nL\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd , p\u00b5q\u03bd , q\u00b5q\u03bd , \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2p\u03b1q\u03b2 , (3.10)\nsince they are free from the contributions of pseudoscalar charmed mesons. Indeed, the hadronic matrix elements \u30080|J (R)\u2020\u03bd |D(p)\u3009 are proportional to the momentum p\u03bd , which does not appear in eq. (3.10). Finally, we can write down a hadronic dispersion relation for each function F (R)L (p2, q2):\nF (R)had,L(p 2, q2) = 1\n\u03c0 \u221e\u222b sth ds Imp2F (R) had,L(s, q2) s\u2212 p2 , (3.11)\nwhere sth is the same threshold as in the hadronic dispersion relations for the two-point correlator considered in section 2.1.\n3.2 Light-cone OPE of the B-to-vacuum correlator\nThe calculation of the light-cone OPE for the correlators (3.1) is analogous to the one performed in refs. [3, 5, 21] for the B \u2192 P or B \u2192 V form factors, where P = \u03c0,K,D and V = \u03c1,K\u2217, D\u2217. The main difference with these calculations is the choice of the interpolating current, which has already been discussed at the beginning of this section.\nIt is more convenient to consider separately the correlators\nF (i)\u00b5\u03bd (p, q) = i \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u30080|T { J (i)\u2020\u03bd (x), Jw\u00b5 (0) } |B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009 , (i = 1, 2) (3.12)\nwhich are related to the ones in eq. (3.1) through the following equations:\nF (D1)\u00b5\u03bd = F (1)\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 fD\u20321 gD\u20321 F (2)\u00b5\u03bd , F (D\u20321) \u00b5\u03bd = F (1)\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 fD1 gD1 F (2)\u00b5\u03bd . (3.13)\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nWe expand the correlators F (i)\u00b5\u03bd at near light-cone separations x2 ' 0, which in momentum space implies that our calculation is valid for p2 m2c and q2 (mb + mc)2. Using the Wick\u2019s theorem to compute the time-ordered product in eq. (3.12) and expanding the c-quark propagator near the light-cone, we obtain\nF (1)OPE,\u00b5\u03bd(p, q) = i \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u30080|mcq\u0304(x)\u03b3\u03bd\u03b35iSc(x, 0)\u0393w\u00b5 b(0)|B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009 , (3.14)\nF (2)OPE,\u00b5\u03bd(p, q) = \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u30080|q\u0304(x)\u03b35(D\u03bd \u2212 \u2190\u2212 D\u03bd)iSc(x, 0)\u0393w\u00b5 b(0)|B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009 , (3.15)\nwhere \u0393w\u00b5 = \u03b3\u00b5(1 \u2212 \u03b35). We neglect the gluon emission effects which generate quarkantiquark-gluon (three-particle) components of the B meson DAs. Indeed, their contributions turned out to be numerically irrelevant in LCSRs for the B \u2192 D(\u2217) form factors [5, 29]. We also do not take into account the O(\u03b1s) corrections which can be relevant [4] but would demand involved loop diagram calculations which are out of our scope. Thus, the covariant derivatives in eq. (3.15) can be replaced with partial derivatives and in both correlation functions the free c-quark propagator can be used:\nSc(x, 0) = \u222b d4k\n(2\u03c0)4 e \u2212ik\u00b7x /k +mc k2 \u2212m2c . (3.16)\nUsing these approximations, eq.

Eq. (3.18) is further simplified integrating by parts its second line:\nF (2)OPE,\u00b5\u03bd(p, q) = i \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u30080|q\u0304\u03b1(x)b\u03b2(0)|B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009\n\u00d7 { 2 [ \u03b35\u2202\u03bdSc(x, 0)\u0393w\u00b5 ] \u03b1\u03b2 + ip\u03bd [ \u03b35Sc(x, 0)\u0393w\u00b5 ] \u03b1\u03b2 } . (3.19)\nThis allows us to write the correlators F (1)OPE,\u00b5\u03bd and F (2) OPE,\u00b5\u03bd in the same compact form\nF (i)OPE,\u00b5\u03bd(p, q) = \u222b d4x eip\u00b7x \u222b d4k (2\u03c0)4 e \u2212ik\u00b7x[\u0393(i)\u03bd \u03b35 /k +mcm2c \u2212 k2 \u0393w\u00b5 ]\u03b1\u03b2\u30080|q\u0304\u03b1(x)b\u03b2(0)|B\u0304(p+ q)\u3009 ,\n(3.20)\nwhere\n\u0393(1)\u03bd = mc\u03b3\u03bd , \u0393(2)\u03bd = p\u03bd \u2212 2k\u03bd .\nTo proceed, we approximate the B-to-vacuum matrix element in the above expression by its HQET limit, replacing the b-quark field by the heavy-quark effective field with\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nvelocity v = (p + q)/mB, i.e. b(0) \u2192 hv(0). This non-local B-to-vacuum matrix element can now be expanded in B-meson light-cone DAs of increasing twist. We emphasize that even though we apply the HQET approximation for the b quark and light degrees of freedom within B meson, we still treat the virtual c quark in the correlation functions as a full QCD object with a finite mass. In our calculation of correlation functions we specifically use the DAs given in ref. [30] up to twist four. In addition, we include the twist-five DA g\u2212 in the Wandzura-Wilczek limit as in ref. [5]. For the reader\u2019s convenience we collect the relevant formulae in appendix A. Using the expressions given there, taking the traces, and isolating the Lorentz structures L\u00b5\u03bd listed in (3.10), eq. (3.20) can be written as\nF (i)OPE,L(p 2, q2) = fBmB \u2211 k \u221e\u222b 0 d\u03c3 I (i,k) L (\u03c3, q2) (p2 \u2212 s)k , (i = 1, 2) (3.21)\nwhere\n\u03c3 \u2261 \u03c9 mB\n, s(\u03c3, q2) \u2261 \u03c3m2B + m2c \u2212 \u03c3q2\n\u03c3\u0304 , \u03c3\u0304 \u2261 1\u2212 \u03c3 . (3.22)\nThe functions I(i,k)L are linear combinations of the four B-meson DAs:\nI (i,k) L (\u03c3, q 2) = \u2211 \u03c8 C(i,k)L,\u03c8 (\u03c3, q 2)\u03c8(mB\u03c3) , (3.23)\nfor \u03c8 = \u03c6+, g+,\u03a6\u00b1, G\u00b1. Our results for the coefficients C(i,k)L,\u03c8 are collected in appendix B. This completes our OPE calculation for the correlators F (1)\u00b5\u03bd and F (2)\u00b5\u03bd ."

            "text": "Turning to the numerical analysis, we note that each of the LCSRs for a B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factor presented in eq. (3.25)\u2013(3.32) depends on all four decay constants of D(\u2032)1 -mesons. In a standard LCSR with B-meson DAs, a form factor is multiplied by a single decay constant of the final-state hadron. This decay constant can be replaced by its analytical expression inferred from the two-point sum rule. However, here we only have at our disposal three two-point sum rules (2.30)\u2013(2.32). Hence, one of the decay constants, which we choose to be fD1 , remains a free parameter to be fixed from an additional external input specified below. The two-point sum rules provide three relations that allow us to express the three decay constants fD\u20321 , gD1 and gD\u20321 as functions of fD1 . In more details, we adopt the following procedure:\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\n\u2022 We set the input parameters and evaluate the OPE part of the two-point sum rules in eqs.

(3.24). This is done for negative values of the momentum transfer squared, where the OPE in the adopted approximation is valid. Using conformal mapping and a z expansion, we extrapolate these results to positive q2 values.\n\u2022 The extrapolated OPE results, together with the hadron masses and expressions for the decay constants, are substituted in the LCSRs (3.25)\u2013(3.32) yielding the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors as functions of fD1 .\n\u2022 Employing these expressions for B \u2192 D1 form factors, we compute the B \u2192 D1`\u03bd decay width as function of fD1 . Matching this computation with the corresponding experimental value, we determine the numerical value of fD1 .\n\u2022 Finally, using fD1 , extracted with the procedure outlined above we evaluate the numerical values of all B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors and predict the lepton-flavour universality ratios R(D(\u2032)1 ). As a byproduct, the values of other decay constants are calculated as well.\n4.1 Numerical analysis of the sum rules and fD1 determination\nThe input parameters that we use for the numerical analysis outlined above are listed in table 2. For the parameters determining the OPE such as the c-quark mass, the vacuum condensate values and the characteristics of B meson DAs, we quote their sources. Our choice of the sum-rule specific parameters deserves separate comments. For instance, for the normalization scale we use a typical interval established in the analyses of other correlation functions with a virtual c-quark. In these cases (see, e.g., refs. [25, 32]) not only the LO, as here, but also the NLO gluon radiative corrections were taken into account. Importantly, their numerical effect turned out to be mild, indicating a good convergence of perturbative series at these particular scales. In addition, to evaluate the OPE part of the two-point sum rules, that is the r.h.s. of the eq. (2.30)\u2013(2.32), we need to choose a suitable interval for the Borel parameter M2 and to determine the effective thresholds s(ij)0 . The Borel parameter has to be chosen such that both the contributions of states above D(\u2032)1 and higher-power terms in the OPE are sufficiently suppressed. An indicator of the goodness of this interval is a mild variation of the sum rule result. For the sum rules (2.30)\u2013(2.32) the requirements listed above are fulfilled for the interval quoted in table 2. Moreover, we find that the same interval represents a reasonable choice for the Borel parameter M\u03022 in LCSRs as well. Concerning the choice of the duality threshold, the commonly used procedure consists in taking the ratio between the derivative of a sum rule over \u22121/M2 and the initial sum rule.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nParameter Value/Interval Ref. normalization scale \u00b5 = 1.5GeV (1.3\u20132.5)GeV [25, 32]\nc-quark mass mc(\u00b5 = 1.5GeV) = 1.205\u00b1 0.035GeV [6] quark condensate \u3008q\u0304q\u3009(\u00b5 = 1.5 GeV) = \u2212 (0.278\u00b1 0.022 GeV)3 [2] Ratio \u3008q\u0304Gq\u3009/\u3008q\u0304q\u3009 m20 = 0.8\u00b1 0.2GeV2 [33] Gluon condensate \u3008GG\u3009 = 0.012+0.006\u22120.012 GeV4 B-meson decay constant fB = 189.4\u00b1 1.4MeV [34] Parameters of the \u03bbB = 0.460\u00b1 0.110GeV [35] B-meson DAs3 \u03bb2E = 0.03\u00b1 0.02GeV2 [37]\n\u03bb2H = 0.06\u00b1 0.03GeV2\nBorel parameters M2 = (2.5\u20133.5) GeV2, M\u03022 = M2\nDuality thresholds s(22)0 = (7.20\u00b1 0.65)GeV2\ns\u03020 = s0 = s(11)0 = s (12) 0 = s (22) 0 .\nTable 2. Input values used in the numerical analysis of the two-point sum rules and the LCSRs.\nFor the charmed meson channel this procedure was used, for example, in the LCSRs for the B \u2192 D(\u2217) form factors. Note that here, apart from the conventional axial interpolating current, we deal with a nonstandard current with a derivative. It is therefore important to clarify if a correlator of these currents reveals a peculiar duality threshold. To find that out, we have considered the sum rule for the correlator \u03a0(22) and applied the differentiation procedure to establish the value of s(22)0 . The resulting interval for which the masses of the D1 and D\u20321 mesons (neglecting their small difference) are reproduced, is displayed in table 2. It also turns out to be in the same ballpark as the thresholds for various two-point sum rules and LCSRs with D\u2217 mesons (see, e.g., [3, 5, 25, 32]). Guided by this affinity and by the fact that the correlators \u03a0(11) and \u03a0(12) yield similar values for the threshold, we simplify our numerical analysis adopting one and the same threshold for all remaining sum rules. Using the inputs in table 2, we evaluate the OPE part of the two-point sum rules and LCSRs in eq. (2.30)\u2013(2.32) and (3.24), respectively. Inspecting the light-cone OPE in the LCSRs, we observe that for q2 < 0 there is a strong suppression of the higher-twist contributions (of the DAs g\u00b1). However, at q2 \u2265 0 these contributions almost reach the level of the lower-twist ones (of the DAs \u03c6\u00b1). To ensure a maximal predictivity of the OPE results, we follow the same strategy as in ref. [5] and calculate the OPE at negative values, choosing the points q2 = {\u221220.0,\u221215.0,\u221210.0,\u22125.0}GeV2. We then extrapolate these OPE results to the semileptonic region 0 < q2 < (mB \u2212 m D\n(\u2032) 1\n)2 using a parametrization similar to the one proposed in refs. [40]. Each function\n3For the parameter \u03bbB we use the value obtained from a QCD sum rule in ref. [35]. This value has recently been confirmed in ref. [36]. For the parameters \u03bb2E and \u03bb2H we use the results of ref. [37], which are in agreement \u2014 due to the large uncertainties \u2014 with an independent recent calculation of ref. [38].\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nF (i)OPE,L is written as\nF (i)OPE,L(q 2) = 1\n1\u2212 q2 m2 JP\nK\u2211 k=0 \u03b1 (k) L [ z(q2)\u2212 z(0) ]k , (4.1)\nwhere\nz(q2) = \u221a t+ \u2212 q2 \u2212 \u221a t+ \u2212 t0\u221a\nt+ \u2212 q2 + \u221a t+ \u2212 t0 , (4.2)\nwith the parameters\nt+ = (mB +mD)2 , t0 = (mB +mD) ( \u221a mB \u2212 \u221a mD)2 . (4.3)\nThe parametrization (4.1) isolates the Bc(JP ) resonances located below the thresholds of the continuum bc\u0304 states. The masses mJP of these resonances, listed in table 3, have been calculated in lattice QCD. One can see from eq. (3.25)\u2013(3.32) that each Lorentz structure is related to a certain form factor, which in turn has certain spin-parity quantum numbers of the bc\u0304 states in the timelike region. For the function F (i)OPE,r\u00b5q\u03bd , which corresponds to the form factors with both the 0+ and the 1\u2212 states, we take for simplicity the mass m0+ . Since q2max = (mB \u2212 mD(\u2032)1 )\n2 m20+ this assumption has no significant numerical effect. Note that we truncate the series in eq. (4.1) already at K = 1. Given the uncertainties of the LCSRs, a third coefficient in this expansion should not affect significantly the results of the extrapolation. Having the OPE results in the semileptonic region, we obtain the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors in this region as functions of fD1 using eq. (3.25)\u2013(3.32). Then, we calculate the total semileptonic width \u0393(B \u2192 D1`\u03bd) \u2261 \u0393thD1 as a function of fD1 . The formulas for the decay width expressed via form factors are given in appendix C. We determine fD1 by fitting \u0393thD1(fD1) to its experimental value obtained using the corrected experimental measurement quoted in ref. [41]\nB(B+ \u2192 D\u030401`+\u03bd\u0304`) = (0.67\u00b1 0.05) \u00b7 10\u22122, (` = e, \u00b5) (4.4)\nand \u03c4B\u00b1 = 1.638 ps [6]. Note that, as we have already mentioned in section 2.3, there are four solutions expressing the decay constants fD\u20321 , gD1 , and gD\u20321 in terms of fD1 . This is due to the fact\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nthat eq. (2.30) and eq. (2.32) are quadratic in the decay constants. However, only two of these solutions lead to phenomenologically different results. The other two solutions can be related to the former two via a redefinition of the form-factor phase which is not observable. As a result, the two independent solutions that the fit to eq. (4.4) yields are\nsol. 1: fD1 = (60\u00b1 20)MeV , (4.5) sol. 2: fD1 = (95\u00b1 25)MeV . (4.6)\nWe stress that the difference between the two solutions is not only in the resulting value of fD1 , but also in the functional dependence of the other decay constants and the form factors on fD1 . For each of these solutions we obtain numerical results for the full set of B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors and D (\u2032) 1 decay constants. These results are presented in the next subsection. The twofold ambiguity that emerges in our approach could be resolved by using additional experimental data. However, the form factors obtained for both the solutions, (4.5) and (4.5), predict similar intervals of the B \u2192 D\u20321`\u03bd` width which is not used in the fit (see section 4.2). These intervals, within large errors, are in agreement with the measured value. Hence, the currently achieved accuracy of both LCSRs and experimental widths is not sufficient to distinguish the two solutions. Certain angular observables might be able to resolve this twofold ambiguity, due to their different dependence on the form factors in contrast to the total decay width. Alternatively, further theoretical inputs could also simplify the extraction of the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors within out approach. For instance, if one of the D(\u2032)1 decay constants was known from lattice QCD, we would not need to perform any fit to extract fD1 and thus we would be able to compute the form factor with no ambiguity.\nNote that a systematic comparison of our results with the ones obtained in refs. [41, 42] in the framework of HQET is not straightforward and demands additional studies which are beyond our scope. The evident reason for that is that in HQET the D1 and D\u20321 resonances are assumed to be pure j = 3/2 and j = 1/2 states, respectively, whereas our approach does not use this assignment. Still, comparing the slopes of differential distributions obtained in [41] with our predictions, we observe a better agreement when our form factors are obtained using \u201csol. 1\u201d."

            "text": "We predict the B \u2192 D1 and B \u2192 D\u20321 form factors using the OPE results obtained in the previous subsection for the two alternative solutions emerging from our analysis. The plots of these form factors are given in figure 2, where it is also possible to observe the difference between the two solutions in eq. (4.5)\u2013(4.6) of the fit to fD1 . For a practical use, we fit our form factor results to the following parametrization:\nFBR(q2) = F BR(0)\n1\u2212 q2 m2 JP\n{ 1 + \u03b2F [ z(q2)\u2212 z(0) ]} , (4.7)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nfor FBR = ABR, V BR0 , V BR1 , V BR2 , (R = D1, D\u20321). Here, we use the same definition of the variable z as in eq. (4.2). The central values, the uncertainties, and the correlation of the coefficients in eq. (4.7) are given in table 4. We predict also the decay constants fD\u20321 , gD1 , and gD\u20321 using the two-point sum rules derived in section 2. For the two solutions we obtain:\nsol. 1: fD\u20321 = \u2212110\u00b1 28 MeV , gD1 = \u2212110\u00b1 38 MeV , gD\u20321 = \u221222\u00b1 31 MeV . (4.8) sol. 2: fD\u20321 = 5\u00b1 34 MeV , gD1 = 0\u00b1 34 MeV , gD\u20321 = \u2212136\u00b1 44 MeV . (4.9)\nThe predicted values for the decay constants together with the fitted values (4.5), (4.6) for\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n9\nfD1 , lead to the following observation. If the solution 1 is adopted, then the interpolating current J (1)\u00b5 has a larger overlap with the broad resonance D\u20321 than with the narrow resonance D1. Simultaneously, the current J (2)\u00b5 with derivative of quark field has a larger decay constant with D1 than with D\u20321. The solution 2 clearly manifests an opposite situation. The observed correlation between the structure of the interpolating currents and the decay constants deserves further investigation. Furthermore, the values (4.9) together with the ones for fD1 in eq. (4.5)\u2013(4.6) satisfy the upper bounds given in section 2.3. Evaluating the r.h.s. of the inequalities (2.33) we obtain\n|fD1 | < 181 MeV , |fD\u20321 | < 220 MeV , |gD1 | < 266 MeV , |gD\u20321 | < 323 MeV , (4.10)\nwhere, to stay on the conservative side, we have increased the central values of these bounds by one standard deviation. By construction, our calculated value of the B \u2192 D1`\u03bd total decay width reproduces the measured one in eq. (4.4). On the other hand, our predictions of the B \u2192 D\u20321`\u03bd\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\n(` = e, \u00b5) width converted into branching fraction are\nsol. 1: B(B+ \u2192 D\u030401`+\u03bd\u0304`) = (2.0+2.8\u22121.4) \u00b7 10\u22122 , (4.11) sol. 2: B(B+ \u2192 D\u030401`+\u03bd\u0304`) = (1.7+2.1\u22121.1) \u00b7 10\u22122 . (4.12)\nThey are still compatible with the measured value B(B+ \u2192 D\u030401`+\u03bd\u0304`) = (0.2 \u00b1 0.05) \u00b7 10\u22122 [6, 41] but only within large uncertainties. Currently, a very important observable for a semileptonic exclusive B decay is the corresponding lepton-flavour-universality (LFU) ratio. In our case, these ratios are defined as\nR(D(\u2032)1 ) = \u0393(B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 \u03c4\u03bd) \u0393(B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 `\u03bd)\n(4.13)\nwith ` = e, \u00b5. Our predictions are the same for both solutions and read\nR(D1) = 0.10\u00b1 0.02 , (4.14) R(D\u20321) = 0.10\u00b1 0.03 . (4.15)\nThe relatively small uncertainties of these results indicate a partial cancellation of parametric uncertainties in the ratios of widths. These predictions are in agreement with the results of refs. [41, 43]."

            "text": "In this paper, we have performed the first calculation of the B \u2192 D1 and the B \u2192 D\u20321 form factors using QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs) with B-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs). In order to disentangle the D1 and D\u20321 mesons, which are close in mass and are both 1+ states, we have set up a novel approach that combines QCD two-point sum rules and LCSRs. This approach consists in defining two currents that interpolate both D1 and D\u20321 states and finding a linear combinations of these currents, which interpolate each of these states individually. This implies that four decay constants are needed as inputs to evaluate the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors from the LCSRs with the properly defined currents. Using three independent two-point sum rules, we have related three decay constants to the fourth one, which we have chosen to be fD1 and which is then determined a posteriori using the experimental measurement of the B \u2192 D1`\u03bd (` = e, \u00b5) branching ratio. Our new results include analytical expressions for the diagonal and non-diagonal twopoint correlators of the two interpolating currents obtained with local OPE and used to derive the two-point sum rules. In addition, we have calculated the light-cone OPE in terms of B-meson DAs for the two vacuum-to-B correlators formed by the same interpolating currents with the weak b\u2192 c current and used them to derive LCSRs. A drawback of our approach is that it yields to a twofold ambiguity, which could be resolved in future with more precise experimental data and/or further independent inputs from theory. For example, if a lattice QCD result for one of the decay constants would\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 9\nbe available, we would neither have a twofold ambiguity nor need to use experimental information. Hence, it is an important, albeit challenging task for lattice QCD to isolate the narrow D1 resonance and calculate its decay constant of at least one of the interpolating currents. Our main numerical results include the full set of the B \u2192 D(\u2032)1 form factors in the whole semileptonic region. Even though these results suffer from large uncertainties caused also by the twofold ambiguity, we have found that important observables \u2014 such as the lepton flavour universality ratios R(D1) and R(D\u20321) \u2014 can be predicted with a moderate error. It will be interesting to use our results for comparison with the future measurements of semileptonic B \u2192 D\u2217\u03c0`\u03bd` decays which are accessible, e.g., with the Belle II detector. An angular analysis disentangling S and D waves of the D\u2217\u03c0 final state in these decays will allow to obtain more accurate information on the positions and widths of both 1+ states. Especially important is to confirm the properties of the broad resonance D\u20321 which are currently less certain. Another type of processes where our predictions could be used are various nonleptonic B decays with D1 and D\u20321 in the final state observed as D\u2217\u03c0 resonances. Here both LHCb and Belle-II measurements are possible. To give just one example: the B(s) \u2192 D\u2217\u03c0\u03c0(K) modes where the predicted decay constants fD(\u2032)1 of the axial current can be used in the factorizable approximation to the decay amplitudes. Future improvements of the approach suggested in this paper are possible and realistic. They include a more precise calculation of the OPE for both two-point sum rules and LCSRs, for instance by taking into account perturbative radiative corrections and, for the LCSRs, also the subdominant three-particle contributions. Moreover, an improvement of the input parameters of B-meson DAs, especially of its first inverse moment, will also help to pin down the overall parametric uncertainty of our results. Achieving this precision of OPE in future would also demand a more refined analysis of the duality thresholds. One should use a threshold fixing procedure with the inverse Borel-mass differentiation for each sum rule separately. Furthermore, a relation to HQET in the context of QCD sum rules remains a very important issue. Starting from the correlators with a finite c-quark mass considered in this paper and expanding them in the powers of inverse mass, could provide a link to the heavy-quark limit of the resulting sum rules and to get insight into the mixing pattern of j = 1/2 and j = 3/2 states. Studying this mixing pattern could also help to resolve the twofold ambiguity of our results. We plan to return to this problem in future. In conclusion, let us mention that the LCSR method with B meson DAs and finite c quark mass is universal enough to be used also for the B-meson transitions to the other excited charmed mesons listed in table 1, which will be another natural continuation of this work."
