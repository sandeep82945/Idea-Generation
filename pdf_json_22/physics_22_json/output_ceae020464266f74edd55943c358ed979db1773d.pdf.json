    "abstractText": "The Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 family of spacetimes are a class of static, geodesically complete asymptotically locally AdS5 soliton solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant. They have negative mass and are parameterized by an integer p \u2265 3 with a conformal boundary with spatial topology L(p, 1). We investigate mode solutions of the scalar wave equation on this background and show that, similar to AdS5, the geometry admits a normal mode spectrum (i.e. solutions that neither grow or decay in time). In addition, we also discuss other geometric properties of these soliton spacetimes, including the behaviour of causal geodesics and their thermodynamic properties. We also point out a surprising connection with the AdS soliton.",

            "text": "A classic theorem of Wang [1] states that Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime is the unique conformally compact (globally) static solution to the vacuum Einstein equations Gab+\u039bgab = 0 where \u039b < 0 and with spherical conformal spatial boundary. The theorem holds in situations where the positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds is valid (see also [2, 3]). This result lends support to the expectation that AdS spacetime is the appropriate \u2018ground state\u2019 amongst the class of all solutions with the same asymptotic behaviour. A putative ground state would, in turn, be expected to be dynamically stable, and indeed studies of the wave equation on a fixed AdS background are consistent with this intuition. However, the remarkable result of Bizon et al. [4] demonstrates that, in fact, AdS is nonlinearly unstable under arbitrarily small perturbations whose endpoint is the formation of black holes \u2014 that is, small amounts of energy tend to concentrate at shorter and shorter scales, rather than dissipating as in Minkowski spacetime [4, 5]. A natural question is whether the vacuum Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant admit other static solutions that are asymptotically locally AdS but with a different conformal boundary. The family of AdS soliton spacetimes provides such an example with toroidal conformal spatial boundary [6, 7]. Clarkson and Mann considered the problem of finding static solutions asymptotic to a freely acting discrete quotient of AdS [8, 9]. They succeeded in constructing solutions in odd dimensions (referred to as Eguchi-Hanson-AdS spacetimes) that are asymptotic to AdSd+1/Zp. These spacetimes have negative energy relative to that of pure AdS. In five spacetime dimensions, p \u2265 3 (see below) and spatial cross sections of the conformal boundary are lens spaces L(p, 1) equipped with the standard round metric. Clarkson and Mann conjectured that these metrics are the states of lowest energy in their asymptotic class [8]. The Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 geometry, in addition to being static, has a local SU(2)\u00d7U(1) isometry group, which acts with three-dimensional orbits. Hence its spatial sections belong to the biaxial Bianchi IX class of geometries. Dold exploited this symmetry to study the evolution of initial data within this symmetry class [10]. In addition to showing that the resulting system of equations forms a well-posed initial-boundary value problem (with the fields satisfying an appropriate Dirichlet condition at conformal infinity), he rigorously proved that the maximal development of this restricted class of initial data sufficiently close to Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 data cannot form a horizon in the future. Assuming that Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 is indeed the only static solution within its conformal class, this implies that the endpoint of the evolution must generically be a spacetime containing a naked singularity. In the present article, we will take a different perspective and study mode solutions to the massless Klein-Gordon equation\ng\u03a6 = 0 (1.1)\non the fixed Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 background. One advantage of this approach is that we do not need to make any special symmetry restrictions on \u03a6. It easy to see that (1.1) is separable and so it is relatively straightforward to reduce the problem to a single radial Schr\u00f6dinger-type equation. Since the background is static, it is straightforward to show\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nthat there is a conserved energy and hence a uniform bound for the energy associated with the field \u03a6 in terms of its initial energy. This kind of bound, however, does not tell us if the field is being concentrated within a compact region as a result of some geometric mechanism (e.g. trapping). For simplicity we will study quasinormal mode solutions of (1.1). We will show that, similar to AdS spacetime, Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 admits normal mode solutions (i.e. they neither grow nor decay in time). Our results will be based on a robust numerical approach as well as analytic methods. In addition to the Klein-Gordon test field, we consider many other aspects of these solutions that have not been addressed to date in the literature. We begin with an analysis of the mechanical properties of these solitons. We compute their mass and show that these solutions have a non-trivial thermodynamic volume of topological origin [11, 12]. Examining the thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble, we show that there is an analog of the Hawking-Page phase transition [13]. The two relevant states in the phase transition are the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton and the black hole resulting from performing Zp identifications to the spherical AdS black hole. We then study the geodesics in the spacetime, which is relevant for two reasons. First, we seek to find whether or not there exists stable trapping of null geodesics (the confinement of null geodesics to a compact subregion of space) in the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 spacetime. Stable trapping presents an obstruction to proving strong decay statements for solutions of the wave equation [14, 15]. For example, decay might be no faster than inversely logarithmic in time, rather than inverse polynomial [16]. The latter is expected to be necessary if there is any hope of demonstrating nonlinear stability. In particular, stable trapping has been shown in several examples of families of horizonless soliton spacetimes, which typically have some nontrivial spatial topology (e.g., two-cycles or \u2018bubbles\u2019) [12, 16, 17] or ultracompact objects [18]. However, we find that stable trapping is absent in the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 spacetime. Second, we investigate the light-crossing time of the geometry and find that it turns out to be relevant to understanding the spacing between overtones for the normal mode solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. A recurring theme throughout each aspect of our work is a connection between the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton and the AdS soliton that has not been pointed out in the literature. Namely, starting with the former with spatial boundary metric (the round L(p, 1) lens space), we find that formally taking the p\u2192\u221e limit gives the (universal cover of the) AdS soliton as the limiting solution. As such, we show how the relevant quantities of the AdS soliton govern the asymptotics of the corresponding quantities for the Eguchi-Hanson soliton. The outline of our paper is as follows. In section 2, we review the basic structure of the Eguchi-Hanson soliton and show its limit is AdS soliton as p\u2192\u221e. In section 3, we analyze the mass and thermodynamic behaviour of the soliton, and in section 4, we consider the behaviour of timelike and null geodesics in this spacetime. We find that both massive and null particles oscillate between the edge of the soliton and infinity, with no stable trapping regions. In section 5, we proceed with the main purpose of our paper, that of analyzing the scalar wave equation in the Eguchi-Hanson soliton spacetime. As an analytic solution is apparently intractable, we solve the equation numerically, checking our results against various approximations in certain limits. Amongst our most intriguing results is that the\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nnormal modes interpolate between those of a scalar wave on the orbifold AdS5/Z2 and on the AdS soliton as the parameter p is varied. We close our paper with some concluding remarks in section 6. Several appendices contain details showing how we arrived at our results."

The Killing vector field \u2202/\u2202\u03c8 becomes degenerate at r = a; examining the (r, \u03c8) sector of the geometry, absence of conical singularities requires the identification\n\u03c8 \u223c \u03c8 + 2\u03c0 2 \u221a g(a) .

(2.10)\nIn the strict p\u2192\u221e limit, this is an AdS5 soliton belonging to the class first reported in [20], in coordinates such that the location of the bubble is at z = 1. One can easily check that the coordinate \u03d5 is periodic with period 2\u03c0. Strictly speaking, there are several topologically distinct solitons that can be obtained from the same local metric (2.10) depending on identifications performed on the auxiliary flat directions (x, y) \u2014 see, e.g., [21]. In this case, the soliton corresponding to the large p limit of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS has no identifications on these coordinates, i.e. the spatial part of the boundary metric is S1\u00d7R2. This is the same configuration first considered in [20], and henceforth we will refer to this case as \u201cthe\u201d AdS soliton. To the best of our knowledge, this connection between the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton and the AdS soliton has not been previously reported on.1\nRegularity of the solution requires that p \u2265 3 is an integer. Therefore, the p \u2192 \u221e limit may be most cautiously considered as a \u2018formal\u2019 limit. Nonetheless, it is difficult to overstate the utility of this result. As we will see in the subsequent sections, many of the quantities of interest cannot be evaluated exactly for the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton, but the asymptotics of these quantities can be effectively captured by the corresponding quantities for the AdS soliton. Said another way, Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 solitons for large values of p behave in a manner similar to the AdS soliton.\n1The connection between the Eguchi-Hanson and AdS soliton geometries could be inferred from the results for lensed CFT partition functions [22].

This was rigorously demonstrated in the asymptotically flat case in [23], and extended to a particular example of an asymptotically globally AdS soliton in [12]. Here we apply these considerations to the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton. While the mass was calculated in the original manuscript [8], the notion of thermodynamic volume [11] \u2014 which proves crucial for deriving the Smarr relation and first law in this case \u2014 was at that point not developed. We note also that considerations of extended thermodynamics have been previously carried out for Eguchi-Hanson-dS soliton in [24]. In appendix A we compare the results of these computations with the formalism of holographic renormalization. Let \u03be = \u2202t be the stationary Killing field. It has zero divergence so d ? \u03be = 0, where ? is the Hodge dual.

(3.8)\nNote that the degeneracy of \u2202/\u2202\u03c8 at the \u2018centre\u2019 r = a implies that ?$ is not well defined there unless C1 is chosen to be C1 = \u2212a4/4. However, as is typical \u2014 and as we will see below \u2014 regularity is not the correct prescription for fixing the parameter C1. Next, we integrate the closed form defined by (3.3) over a hypersurface \u03a3 defined as a surface of constant time, t = constant, over the region R0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e with R0 > a.

Let us first focus on the contribution at conformal infinity. A calculation shows that as r \u2192\u221e,\n? d\u03be = ( \u2212 r 4\n2`2 + a4 2`2 +O(1/r 2) ) sin \u03b8d\u03c8 \u2227 d\u03b8 \u2227 d\u03c6 , (3.10)\nand we note that the divergent term is precisely cancelled by the corresponding divergent term of ?$ when the two terms are combined as in (3.9). We identify a renormalized Komar mass as [11]\nMKomar := \u2212 3\n32\u03c0 \u222b \u2202\u221e\u03a3 ? ( d\u03be \u2212 8 `2 $ ) = \u2212 3\u03c08p`2 ( a4 + 4C1 ) . (3.11)\nThe fact that the free parameter C1 appears in the Komar mass can be understood as an ambiguity in the ground state energy. We will now fix this ambiguity. We can ensure the integral over the asymptotic boundary evaluates to the mass by choosing C1 appropriately. To calculate this we use the Ashtekar-Magnon procedure [25] which is well-defined in this setting. The relevant component of the Weyl tensor is\nCtrtr = \u2212 a4 (r2 + `2)(r4 \u2212 a4) = \u2212 a4 r6 +O(r\u22128) (3.12)\nas r \u2192\u221e. Setting \u2126 = `/r and defining the conformal metric g\u0304ab = \u21262gab with \u2126 = 0 as r \u2192\u221e, the Ashtekar-Magnon mass is then defined as\nQ[\u2202t] = `\n16\u03c0 \u222b \u2202M E\u0304ab(\u2202t)bdSt (3.13)\nwhere dSt is a constant time slice of the conformal boundary, which has a round lens space metric of radius `.

(10) of that work. Comparing the above with the result of the Komar integration implies C1 = \u2212a4/6. Once the Komar mass has been computed, the thermodynamic volume is identified by evaluating the integral of the Killing potential over the inner boundary, and taking the limit R0 \u2192 a. This gives:\nV = \u2212 \u222b \u2202\u03a3R ?$ = \u03c0 2 2p ( a4 + 4C1 ) = \u03c0 2a4 6p , (3.17)\nusing the choice C1 = \u2212a4/6. For some black hole solutions the thermodynamic volume can be interpreted as the volume of a Euclidean ball of radius a that is removed from the spatial hypersurface [26]. This interpretation is not available in this case because there is no \u2018ball\u2019 in Euclidean space for which a lens space is its boundary. In this case, the thermodynamic volume V has a topological origin: it arises not due to the presence of an horizon, but instead because the choice of constant C1 that leads to the correct mass leads to a Killing potential that is not regular at the location of the bubble.\nNoting that thermodynamic pressure is [26]\nP := \u2212 \u039b8\u03c0 = 3 4\u03c0`2 (3.18)\nthen we have M = \u2212PV (3.19)\nwhich is the Smarr formula for this system. Using the regularity condition (2.5) and the mass (3.16) we have\ndM = \u2212 \u03c04p\n( p2 4 \u2212 1 )2 `d` (3.20)\nAlternatively, using (3.17), (3.18), and the regularity condition (2.5), we have\nV dP = \u2212 \u03c04p\n( p2 4 \u2212 1 )2 `d` (3.21)\nand consequently dM = V dP (3.22)\nwhich is the expression of the first law for the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton. The fact that the regularity condition is required for the validity of the first law is consistent with previous studies of (extended) mechanics of smooth geometries [12, 23, 27].\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nIt is worth remarking that in some cases, e.g., for accelerating black holes or spacetimes containing Misner strings, it is possible to formulate the Smarr relation and first law without requiring the regularity condition to hold [28, 29]. It may be interesting to better understand when, exactly, regularity of the geometry is crucial for formulating a sensible first law and Smarr relation."

The vector field \u2202\u03c4 is nowhere vanishing since g(r) > 0 and therefore this S1 does not degenerate. In particular there is no condition on \u03b2. The underlying manifold will therefore be S1 \u00d7 T \u2217S2 (the latter factor being the cotangent bundle of S2).

In the geometric optics approximation, the propagation of solutions to the wave equation in a fixed background can be described by the trajectory of null geodesics. Stable trapping is a phenomena by which properties of the geometry create obstacles forcing null geodesics to be confined in a spatially compact region. The prototypical example of null trapping is the photon sphere at r = 3M in the Schwarzschild spacetime; null geodesics exist in circular orbits at fixed radius. Such trapping, however is unstable because any small perturbation of the orbit will cause the null geodesics to either fall towards the horizon or escape to infinity. By contrast, stable trapping occurs when small perturbations of the orbits remain small so the trapping region is \u2018attractive\u2019. Stable trapping has been shown to lead to inverse-logarithmic time decay of wave energy in both asymptotically flat [15\u201317] and asymptotically AdS spacetimes [14]. As discussed in the introduction, this is suggestive of a non-linear instability, as linear stability typically requires decay that is an inverse polynomial function of time. To exploit the local R\u00d7 SU(2)\u00d7 U(1) isometry of the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 spacetime, it is convenient to (2.2) in the form\nds2 = \u2212g(r)dt2 + dr 2 f(r)g(r) + r2f(r) 4 [d\u03c8\u0304 + cos(\u03b8)d\u03c6] 2 + r 2 4 d\u2126 2 2 (4.1)\nwhere we have defined a new coordinate \u03c8\u0304 = 2\u03c8.

In particular the Hamiltonian for the motion of uncharged particles is H = gabpapb where pa are the canonical momenta.

            "text": "Let us begin with a consideration of time-like geodesics, i.e. m\u0302 6= 0. To illustrate some similarities/differences with time-like geodesics in AdS, we will restrict attention here to radial time-like geodesics. After defining E = E/m\u0302 and rescaling the affine parameter accordingly, we arrive at the equation\nr\u03072 = f(r) [ E2 \u2212 g(r) ] . (4.14)\nWe immediately see that the large\u2212r turning point of the motion is exactly the same as it is for AdS:3\nrmax = ` \u221a E2 \u2212 1 . (4.15)\nThis result is sensible \u2014 the space is asymptotically locally AdS and so at large enough distances the radial motion should approach that of AdS. There is a further constraint to consider since the only physically relevant cases are those for which rmax \u2265 a. This in turn enforces that the energy must be larger than a given threshold,\nE \u2265 Emin = p 2 , where a ` =\n\u221a p2\n4 \u2212 1 . (4.16)\n3Of course, the radial coordinate for the soliton is not the same as the radial coordinate for pure AdS. These differences disappear at sufficiently large r, as can be confirmed by putting the metric into Fefferman-Graham form. What we mean here is that the functional form of rmax is identical.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nA second turning point arises due to the presence of the bubble, this is at r = a, where f(r) = 0. The motion of a massive particle is therefore oscillatory, bouncing back and forth on the interval a \u2264 r \u2264 rmax. The presence of the bubble has implications for the motion at smaller values of r. To highlight this, consider the acceleration\nr\u0308 = \u2212 r `2 \u2212 a\n4\nr3`2 + 2a 4(E2 \u2212 1) r5\n(4.17)\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side is the acceleration term present in pure AdS. This makes manifest the well-known fact that the motion of time-like geodesics in AdS is periodic with period 2\u03c0`. Further, note that the sign of the acceleration in pure AdS is always negative \u2014 a stone tossed in AdS will always be returned to sender.\nThe additional acceleration terms for a 6= 0 have interesting consequences. The last term in the above always makes a positive contribution, since E \u2265 Emin > 1. Close to the bubble this positive term actually dominates, leading to a region where the acceleration is positive, indicating a repulsion.\nIt is a simple matter to prove this. First, note that sufficiently large r, the leading AdS term will always dominate, meaning that r\u0308 < 0 at large r. Next, let us consider the possibility of solutions to the equation r\u0308 = 0. Define a new variable r = `(x + \u03b1) where \u03b1 = a/`. Then, the equation r\u0308 = 0 becomes equivalent to the polynomial equation4\nx6 + 6\u03b1x5 + 15\u03b12x4 + 20\u03b13x3 + 16\u03b14x2 + 8\u03b15x+ 2\u03b14 ( 1\u2212 E2 + \u03b12 ) = 0 . (4.18)\nEvery term in this polynomial is manifestly positive except for the very last one. It will vanish for\nE = Emin = p\n2 . (4.19)\nFor E > Emin the last term is negative. In this case, applying Descartes\u2019 rule of signs tells us that there will be a single positive value of x where the above polynomial has a zero. There are no zeros for positive x under other circumstances. Undoing our substitutions, x > 0 implies r > a. Thus, we have concluded that there is exactly one zero for the acceleration for r > a. Since we know from the above analysis that r\u0308 < 0 for sufficiently large r, we then conclude that in a neighbourhood of the bubble the acceleration is positive for particles with E > p/2. Since this corresponds to the minimum possible energy, it follows that all massive particles feel a repulsion in the vicinity of the bubble, except those for which E is exactly Emin as these particles just sit at the bubble without motion. The extent of this repulsion is bounded and approaches a constant, as can be seen by expanding the acceleration in the vicinity of the bubble:\nr\u0308 = (4E 2 \u2212 p2) ` \u221a p2 \u2212 4 +O(r \u2212 a) . (4.20)\n4While an explicit solution for x in this equation can be obtained, it is sufficiently complicated that it is not beneficial to present it here.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nThe origin of this effect is the negative mass of the bubble. To see this, it is instructive to re-write the expression for the acceleration in terms of the mass given in (3.16). It is a simple matter to show that it then takes the form,\nr\u0308 = \u2212 r `2 \u2212 8pM \u03c0\n( 2r2max \u2212 r2 ) r5 , (4.21)\nwhere rmax was introduced in eq. (4.15). Since r \u2264 rmax we see directly that if it were possible to have positive mass, then the acceleration would always be attractive. However, since the mass is necessarily negative, there is a competition between the confining potential of AdS and the negative mass repulsion of the bubble. This leads to a thin layer in the vicinity of the bubble where massive particles find themselves accelerated away from the bubble. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the repulsion does not result in a situation where a (positive energy) particle \u2018hovers\u2019 at some fixed position r > a. When E > Emin the velocity is necessarily non-zero at the point where the acceleration vanishes. The only case when it is possible for r\u0307 = r\u0308 = 0 simultaneously is when E = Emin, corresponding to a particle at the location of the bubble. The (radial) motion of massive particles in Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 is therefore qualitatively similar to the motion of massive particles in AdS. The motion is forever oscillatory, with particles confined in some layer surrounding the bubble, the thickness of which depends on the energy of the particle. Unsurprisingly, this suggests that Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 may suffer from a similar non-linear instability as global AdS, however, here without the possibility of forming horizons [10]."

Examining the potential as a function of x we see that it vanishes at the boundaries x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, and there are no turning points on the interior domain. We can then apply directly the results of [40, section 10.5] for the quantization condition of normal mode solutions in the geometric optics approximation:\n\u03c9` \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u221a V (x)dx = ( N + 12 ) \u03c0 +O ( 1 \u03c9 ) , (5.18)\nwhere N is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, applying the\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nquantization condition as above, we have in the geometric optics approximation the following result for the frequencies:\n\u03c9 = ( N + 12 ) 2\u03c0 Tp = ( N + 12 ) \u03c9fun , (5.20)\nwhere the fundamental frequency \u03c9fun = 2\u03c0/Tp for the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton. We expect this relationship to be accurate in the limit of large overtone number, since we have assumed that `\u03c9 is large. Later, in our numerical results, we will verify this is remarkably accurate even at small overtone number. As explained below (4.36), the light crossing time can be evaluated analytically and was presented in eq. (4.37). While this closed-form solution for the light-crossing time (or, equivalently, the fundamental frequency) is convenient, it is not necessarily illuminating. Therefore in table 1 we list the numerical values for the fundamental frequency for a few values of p. Since the asymptotics of Tp are dominated by a 1/p term, we have factored out an overall multiple of p in the numerical expressions for \u03c9fun. This allows one to see more clearly the limiting behaviour for larger values of p. The results in this table should be compared with the fundamental frequency for the AdS soliton, which is\n`\u03c9AdSSfun = 4 \u221a 2\u03c03/2 \u0393[1/4]2 = limp\u2192\u221e 2`\u03c9fun p \u2248 2.39628 . (5.21)\nThat is, at large values of p, the fundamental frequency, which governs the normal modes at large overtone number N k, n, asymptotically approaches p/2 times the fundamental frequency of the AdS soliton. This is directly related to the fact that there is a sense in which the AdS soliton is formally the large p limit of the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton, as explained in section 2.1. The factor of 2/p is precisely the factor required to match the time coordinates between the two geometries."

It will also be more convenient to compactify the semi-infinite domain to a finite interval. We therefore begin our numerical analysis of the radial equation with an analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions and boundary conditions. For the sake of comparison with the broader literature, here we will re-instate the mass parameter M\u0302 in our formulas.\nWe begin by introducing a new coordinate\nu = 2(r \u2212 a) r + a \u2212 1 , (5.22)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nwhich maps the semi-infinite domain r \u2208 (a,\u221e) to the interval u \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. To understand the singularity structure, we perform a Frobenius analysis. Near r = a we write,\nR(u) = (u+ 1)s \u2211 i=0 ai(u+ 1)i (5.23)\nand extract s by solving the differential equation near u = \u22121. Provided that m 6= 0, the equation allows for two solutions, corresponding to the values\ns = \u00b1m2p . (5.24)\nWe require regularity of the solution as u \u2192 \u22121, and therefore only one of the above solutions is physically acceptable, depending on the sign of m. In general, for m 6= 0 we have the regular behaviour s = |m|/(2p). The case m = 0 must be treated separately, since the Frobenius method gives a degenerate root in that case. Since the degenerate root corresponds to s = 0, from the general theory of Frobenius analysis, we can conclude in this case that the solution must be of the form\nR(u) = \u2211 i=0 ai(u+ 1)i + log(u+ 1) \u2211 i=0 bi(u+ 1)i . (5.25)\nIt can easily be shown that this ansatz leads to a consistent series solution in the vicinity of u = \u22121. Regularity of the solution there forces us to set b0 = 0, and so when m = 0, the solution approaches a constant as r \u2192 a. This behaviour is in fact captured by the result above, s = |m|/(2p), in the case m = 0. The asymptotic analysis near u = 1 (i.e. r \u2192 \u221e) is more standard. We can again proceed via Frobenius analysis. Taking the Frobenius ansatz\nR(u) = (u\u2212 1)s\u0302 \u2211 i=0 ai(u\u2212 1)i , (5.26)\nexpanding the differential equation near u\u2192 1 and demanding a solution of the indicial equation, we find\ns\u0302 = 2\u00b1 \u221a 2 + (M\u0302`)2 . (5.27)\nRequiring the solution to be real gives the well-known Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [41], (M\u0302L)2 > \u22122. As usual, we proceed by taking the normalizable solution,\ns\u0302 = 2 + \u221a 2 + (M\u0302`)2 . (5.28)\nWith the asymptotic behaviours understood, we now recast the differential equation into a form that is more amenable to numerical solution. To this end, we define a new function\nR(u) = (1\u2212 u)2+ \u221a 2+(M\u0302`)2(1 + u)|m|/(2p)h(u) . (5.29)\nWe then recast (5.7) in terms of the new function h(u). The resulting expression is somewhat messy, and so we do not present it here. The prefactors implement the appropriate fall-off conditions in the two relevant limits, and therefore the only requirement on h(u) is that it\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nshould be regular. Demanding this, a series solution near either u\u2192 \u22121 or u\u2192 +1 results in Robin boundary conditions\nh\u2032(\u22121) = [\n(4 + p2)(m2 + 2|m|p) + 4p4 + 8\u03c92 + 2p2(\u00b5\u2212 \u03c92) 2p3(|m|+ p)\n] h(\u22121) (5.30)\nh\u2032(1) = (\n1 + |m|4p\n) h(1) (5.31)\nthat must be imposed on the function h(u). Before moving on, it is worth commenting in a bit more detail about the solution in the near bubble regime r \u2192 a. In this regime, the radial solution behaves as R(r) \u223c (r \u2212 a)n/2, and so it appears to be continuous but not smooth there. To study this more carefully, we carry out the transformation\n\u03c1 = 4 \u221a r \u2212 a p \u221a f \u2032(a) , \u03d5 = p\u03c8 (5.32)\nwhich yields ds2 = d\u03c12 + \u03c12d\u03d52 (5.33)\nnamely the standard polar metric on R2 as r \u2192 a, with \u03d5 \u223c \u03d5 + 2\u03c0 due to the 2\u03c0/p periodicity of \u03c8. Consider next the solution to the wave equation as r \u2192 a. Focusing just on the terms with r and \u03c8 dependence, and transforming these according to the polar coordinates (5.32) defined above, we obtain\n\u03c6(r, \u03c8) \u223c \u03c1nein\u03d5 . (5.34)\nDespite the fact that neither \u03c1 nor \u03d5 are themselves smooth functions \u2014 as can be confirmed by transforming these quantities to a Cartesian frame \u2014 the combinations as appearing here are indeed smooth.

            "text": "We can now perform a numerical analysis of the radial equation (5.7), which we carry out for the case M\u0302 = 0. To solve this equation, we have employed two different numerical schemes. Our primary method has been a pseudospectral method for obtaining the eigenvalues of the differential operator. However, we have also cross-checked and benchmarked this method with a simpler shooting method. In appendix B we compare the two techniques. For an in-depth review of the pseudospectral method we refer to various references, e.g. [42\u201344]. After the transformations (5.22) and (5.29), the radial equation is a problem on the interval [\u22121, 1]. On this interval, we introduce a grid consisting of N + 1 grid points ui, which we take to be the Gauss-Lobatto points,\nui = cos i\u03c0\nN for i = 0, . . . ,N . (5.35)\nWe then discretize the differential equation. The eigenfunction h(u) becomes a vector defined at the Gauss-Lobatto points, hi := h(ui), and the derivatives appearing in the differential\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nequation are replaced with the corresponding Chebychev differentiation matrices6 Di,j . The differential equation then reduces to a generalized eigenvalue problem,\nHi,jhj = \u03c92Vi,jhj (5.36)\nwhereHi,j is the discretization of the differential operator and Vi,j is the matrix discretization of the terms multiplying \u03c92 in the original differential equation. To implement the Robin boundary conditions, we replace the first row of the above with the discretization of equation (5.31), and the last row with the discretization of equation (5.30). After the differential equation has been discretized, we utilize the built-in eigenvalue solvers of Mathematica to obtain the eigenvalues \u03c9. For a given choice of N we will obtain a set of eigenvalues {\u03c9}N for the generalized eigenvalue problem described above. Of course, for any discretization of the differential equation, the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix equation will differ from the true eigenvalues of the differential operator. We expect that the error in this discretization will become smaller as N is increased. We monitor convergence in the following way. We set a priori a tolerance that we regard as the minimum acceptable absolute error in the eigenvalue \u03c9. We then choose a number of grid points N and compute the spectrum {\u03c9}N first for N and then the spectrum {\u03c9}N+1 for a grid with N + 1 points. For each eigenvalue in {\u03c9}N we assess whether there is a corresponding eigenvalue in {\u03c9}N+1 that is within the specified tolerance. If it is, then we conclude that this particular eigenvalue has been determined to the specified tolerance. We continue in this way, identifying each eigenvalue in {\u03c9}N that has converged within the specified tolerance. For most of our results the tolerance has been set to 10\u22125, meaning the eigenvalues are accurate to at least five decimal places. In most cases, we have repeated the above procedure for several values of N to gain a better understanding of the convergence properties. In appendix D we present additional details on convergence for particular cases. Furthermore, in appendix B we compare the results obtained via the pseudospectral method with those obtained via the shooting method, to ensure consistency. When confusion may arise, when referring to a particular element of {\u03c9} we will use the notation \u03c9(p)N,k,n to indicate the dependence on the various parameters that appear in the equation. Here N is a non-negative integer indicating the overtone, and n = m/p. Since the equations and boundary conditions are invariant under m\u2192 \u2212m, we will without loss of generality consider only the case where n is a non-negative integer. When there is less risk of confusion, we will suppress additional data attached to the spectral element \u03c9(p)N,k,n to avoid unnecessary bulky notion. To begin our discussion of the numerical results, we compare the output of the pseudospectral method with the approximate results obtained via the WKB method. In the case of modes with n = k = 0, the WKB approximation is rather accurate for all overtone numbers. This is shown in figure 2, where we show the output of the numerical methods (coloured dots) with the analytic approximation provided by the WKB method (black lines). The plot shows this comparison for overtones up to N = 50 for p = 3, 4, 5 and 6. In all cases, the agreement between the WKB result and the more accurate numerical approach\n6We refer to, for example, [43] for an explicit form of these objects \u2014 cf. section 2.4.2 therein.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0 100\n200\n300\nFigure 2. A comparison of the WKB approximate results for n = k = 0 (black lines) with the numerically computed eigenvalues for p = 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponding to the blue, red, green and orange dots, respectively.\nis superb. This is further backed up by figure 3, which shows the relative error between the WKB approximation and the numerical result for the same set of p values. This plot shows that the WKB approximation is most accurate for the p = 3 case, but in all cases is accurate to about one part in one-thousand for overtone number N \u2265 10. As expected, the accuracy of the WKB approximation becomes better the larger the overtone number becomes.\nWhen n and k are non-vanishing, the WKB result no longer provides particularly good agreement, and we will discuss these cases at greater length below. However, it is important to note that even in these cases the WKB approach yields the correct spacing between overtones, provided the overtone number is sufficiently large compared to the values of n and k. We illustrate this in figure 4, which compares the overtone spacing \u03c9N+1 \u2212 \u03c9N as obtained numerically to the fundamental frequency, which governs the overtone spacing in the WKB approximation. The plot shows this comparison as a function of overtone number for the n = 20 and k = 0 mode for the cases of p = 3, 4, 5 and 6. We see in all cases that the absolute difference between the numerically determined spacing and the fundamental frequency is a monotonically decreasing function of the overtone number. This result, which we have verified in more examples in our numerical computations, is consistent with the notion that the fundamental frequency universally governs the spacing between overtones in the large overtone limit.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 10-6 10-5\n10-4\n0.001\n0.010\nFigure 3. A plot showing the error in the WKB approximation as a function of overtone number for p = 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponding to the blue, red, green and orange dots, respectively. Here we show the logarithm of the relative absolute error, |\u03c9WKB \u2212 \u03c9Num|/\u03c9Num.\nAs mentioned, the WKB results provide a good approximation to the eigenvalues when n = k = 0, and more generally allow us to understand the spacing between overtones in the limit of large overtone number. However, there are a number of instances when the approximate solutions obtained in this way are insufficient. We move on to discuss these cases now. While the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton is defined only for integer p \u2265 3, the radial equation is sensible from a mathematical perspective under more general circumstances. To understand the spectrum {\u03c9} for the soliton, we have found it useful to analyse the radial equation for real values of p \u2208 [2,\u221e). The main reason for this is that it is possible, through a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, to obtain simple asymptotic forms for \u03c9 as p \u2192 2 and as p \u2192 \u221e. By piecing together these approximate forms in various ways it is possible to get a good handle on the spectra over the full range of parameters.\nIn the limit p\u2192 2 we find the following behaviour:\n\u03c9 (p) 0,k,n \u2248 2 (2 + k + n) + n (p\u2212 2)\n+ [\n6 ( 2n2 \u2212 n\u2212 k ) (k + n)(1 + 2k + 2n)(\u22121 + 2k + 2n) ] (p\u2212 2)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (5.37)\nwhere the first term has been obtained analytically; the analysis is outlined in appendix D. Essentially, in the strict p = 2 limit, the radial equation reduces to that of a Klein-Gordon field on the orbifold AdS5/Z2. That problem is obviously analytically solvable, and leads to\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 0.005 0.010\n0.050\n0.100\n0.500\n1\nFigure 4.

The plot shows the case n = 20, k = 0 for p = 3, 4, 5, 6 corresponding to the blue, red, green and orange dots, respectively. The results are consistent with the fundamental frequency governing the spacing between successive overtones provided that N n, k.\nthe first term in the above. We find excellent numerical agreement between the p\u2192 2 limit of the numerical results and this analytically derived result, as detailed in appendix D.\nThe second and third terms in (5.37) have been inferred from the numerical results. For simplicity, we have focused here only on the fundamental mode, and have not worked out the dependence for the overtones due to the complexity. Our procedure to determine these corrections was the following. We have computed, for numerous choices of n and k, the spectrum on the interval p \u2208 (2, 3]. For a given choice of n and k, we then fit the numerical results to a polynomial in (p\u2212 2). Adjusting the order of the polynomial fit, we see that the coefficients converge rapidly to particular values.7 We take this as an indication that a series in (p\u2212 2) captures accurately the behaviour of the spectrum in the close vicinity of p = 2 for given values of n and k. By comparing the results of this procedure across several different values of n and k, we arrive at a collection of values cn,k,i for the coefficients of the (p\u2212 2)i term in the polynomial fit. We then study the way the different cn,k,i depend on n and k, and from this infer their analytical dependence. The analytic dependence is then cross-checked against numerical results for values of n and k that were not part of the sample used when deducing the candidate analytic form. This process becomes more involved as\n7For example, including terms up to order (p\u2212 2)10 in the fit we find that the coefficient of the linear term (p\u2212 2) converges to five decimal places.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0\n8.0\n8.2\n8.4\n8.6\n8.8\n9.0\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 26.0\n26.2\n26.4\n26.6\n26.8\n27.0\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0\n26\n28\n30\n32\n34\n36\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\nFigure 5. Here we compare the approximate form of fundamental mode (black line) against the numerically determined spectra (blue dots) over the range p \u2208 (2, 3]. The plots show the cases n = 1, k = 1 (top left), n = 1, k = 10 (top right), n = 10, k = 1 (bottom left) and n = 10, k = 10 (bottom right). The plots indicate that the approximate form is valid over a larger range of p values as the value of n or k is made larger.\nthe power i is increased. However, for the linear and quadratic terms, the dependence is simple enough that it can be inferred, giving the results presented above.8 The fact that the dependence of these terms on n and k appears so simple suggests that it may be possible to determine these corrections analytically, though we shall not pursue this any further.\nIn figure 5, we compare the analytic approximation (5.37) with the numerical results for different values of n and k, over the interval p \u2208 [2, 3). While this range of p does not correspond to regular five-dimensional geometries, it does concisely summarize important information about this approximation. First, we see that the approximate form is quite accurate over this interval. Second, we note that the approximation does better for large values of n and k. The reason for this second fact seems to be the following. For large n or k, the coefficient of the quadratic term in (5.37) behaves like 1/n or 1/k2, respectively. This suggests that series (5.37) \u2014 if it is convergent \u2014 converges more rapidly for large values of these quantum numbers, or \u2014 if it is an asymptotic series rather than a convergent one \u2014 that the series approximates the true function for a large range of p values in this limit.\n8We have also found that the behaviour of the (p \u2212 2)3 term can be deduced in certain limits. For example, we have found that for n = 0 the coefficient of this term is \u22123/(4k2 \u2212 1) while for k = 0 the coefficient of this term is 3/(2n+ 1)2. However, the functional form of the cubic term for general values of n and k has eluded us.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n2 3 4 5 6\n21.8\n21.9\n22.0\n22.1\n22.2\n2 3 4 5\n25.80\n25.85\n25.90\n25.95\n26.00\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n29.8\n30.0\n30.2\n30.4\n30.6\n30.8\n2 4 6 8 10\n43.8\n44.0\n44.2\n44.4\n44.6\n44.8\n45.0\nFigure 6. Plots of the frequencies vs. p for n = 0 and k = 9, 11, 13 and 20 (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively). These plots highlight the fact that, for k > 2n2 \u2212 n, it is possible for the eigenvalue to initially decrease as p increases. In all cases, the light gray line indicates the analytic approximation (5.37), while the blue dots indicate numerical data.\nA careful analysis of the analytic approximation shows that the quadratic term is negative whenever k > 2n2 \u2212 n. This leads to some interesting structure in the spectrum, but does not lead to any complex eigenvalues. Namely, we find that in some circumstances the eigenvalues can initially decrease as a function of p. However this behaviour is ultimately reversed when p becomes large \u2014 for sufficiently large p, the eigenvalues are monotonically increasing as a function of p, as we will discuss below. Examples are shown in figure 6 for n = 0 and different choices of k. For all values of k that we have explored, the shape of the eigenvalue curve as a function of p is qualitatively the same. At larger values of k, the \u2018dip\u2019 occurs at larger values of p. In all cases, the depth of the dip is rather small, and in no cases do the eigenvalues come close to crossing through zero. In practice, we observe this effect for physical values of p only in the case n = 0. For n 6= 0, the small p\u2192 2 approximation is less accurate for k > 2n2\u2212n. Indeed, for any fixed values of n and k, the approximate form derived in the p\u2192 2 limit will ultimately become bad when p is sufficiently large. Roughly, this occurs when the quadratic piece in the approximation dominates.\nWhen p becomes sufficiently large compared to the quantum numbers n and k, the approximate form derived in the p\u2192 2 limit fails to accurately capture the details of the spectrum. In this regime, we can make progress by understanding the solution of the radial equation in the limit of large p. Numerical experiments suggest that, when p n, k the eigenvalues exhibit a linear dependence on p. This observation can be explained analytically.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nAs described in section 2.1, in the large p limit, there is a formal sense in which the geometry limits to the AdS soliton. The normal modes of the AdS soliton then govern the slope of the eigenvalues \u03c9N,k,n. Explicitly, we have the following relation that holds for large p:\nd\u03c9 (p) N,k,n\ndp = \u03b1N,n + . . . as p\u2192\u221e , (5.38)\nwhere the dots denote terms that are subleading as p\u2192\u221e. Here \u03b1N,n are the normal modes of the AdS soliton which, unfortunately, cannot be determined analytically.9 We tabulate in appendix C the numerically determined values of these normal modes and overtones for several values of n. We also note that the WKB approximation gives a reasonably accurate approximation when N n,\n`\u03b1N,n \u2248 2 \u221a\n2\u03c03/2 \u0393[1/4]2 ( N + 12 ) . (5.39)\nNote that the fact that the quantum number k is absent in the above expressions is result of neither an assumption nor a typo. There is an \u2018emergent degeneracy\u2019 that appears for sufficiently large p that eliminates any dependence on k in the leading expressions. While (5.38) provides a good approximation for the slope, additional details are required to determine the intercept and thereby obtain a good approximation to the eigenvalues themselves, rather than just their slope. One simple \u2014 and surprisingly accurate \u2014 option is to combine this large p approximation with the fact that we know as p\u2192 2 the eigenvalues approach 2(2 + n + k + N). Choosing the constant of integration to be such that the eigenvalues have this point as the intercept, we obtain the approximation:\n\u03c9 (p) N,k,n \u2248 (p\u2212 2)\u03b1N,n + 2(2 + n+ k +N) . (5.40)\nThis approximate form gives very good agreement with the numerically determined eigenvalues over the full range of physical p values, provided that n is sufficiently large. In this sense, one may consider (to a first approximation) that the normal modes of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS interpolate between the normal modes of AdS5/Z2 and the AdS soliton as the parameter p is varied. A more accurate approximation can be obtained by carrying out the same series of steps that we followed in the p \u2192 2 limit. That is, through a combination of numeric and analytic techniques, we can determine the next-to-leading order terms in the large p expansion. If instead we do this, we obtain the following:\n\u03c9 (p) N,k,n \u2248 p\u03b1N,n + n(2k + 1) \u03b1N,n +O(1/p) . (5.41)\nWe show this approximation for a few representative cases in figure 7 for small values of n. Despite the constant term being heuristically derived, the approximation (5.40) actually does a better job than one might naively expect, at least for the fundamental mode. One 9Strictly speaking, \u03b1N,n are the normal modes for the AdS soliton when the time coordinate is rescaled by a factor of 2 from the usual value.\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nFigure 7.

The solid black lines correspond to an analytic approximation to the curves, while the coloured discs correspond to the results of the numerical computation.\nreason for this is the following. Though we have not been able to prove this behaviour analytically, we numerically observe that as n becomes large, \u03b10,n \u2248 n. Therefore, in this limit, the large p approximation given in (5.40) approaches\n\u03c9 (p) 0,k,n \u2248 2(2 + n+ k) + n(p\u2212 2) for n\u2192\u221e . (5.42)\nIf we compare this result with the large n \u2192 \u221e limit of the p \u2192 2 approximation given in (5.37) we see that the two expressions are exactly the same. Therefore, the approximate forms derived in the p n and p n limits are identical. This explains why both approximate forms do better than expected for large values of n. For the sake of completeness, we tabulate a number of the numerically determined normal modes in appendix E."

            "text": "Eguchi-Hanson-AdS solitons are conjectured to be the ground states for anti de Sitter gravity with lens space L(p, 1) boundary conditions at infinity, analogous to how the AdS soliton is the conjectured ground state for toroidal boundary conditions at infinity. In this manuscript, we have considered various aspects of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 solitons. Our primary objective, which we have initiated here, is to understand to what extent these geometries are likely\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nto be stable or not. In this sense, it is known [10] that under certain circumstances perturbations of the geometry may result in the formation of naked singularities. However, the precise mechanism underlying such an instability remains unknown. Since relatively little is understood about these geometries, our study here has focused on other related properties as well. A key observation we have made concerns the relationship between the Eguchi-HansonAdS5 soliton and the AdS soliton. We demonstrated that in the limit where the lens space L(p, 1) parameter p\u2192\u221e, the geometry becomes identically equal to that of the AdS soliton, up to a rescaling of the time coordinate. This observation is more than a curiosity, as we have found here this allows one to obtain approximations for various quantities of interest in terms of those same quantities for the simpler AdS soliton geometry.10 We have studied the conserved quantities of the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton and constructed the extended first law of soliton mechanics. In doing so, we observe that these solitons possess a non-trivial thermodynamic volume, despite having vanishing entropy. Commensurate with a previous study of thermdynamic volume for asymptotically globally AdS5 solitons [12], the source of this quantity is topological in nature, and has to do with the structure of the Killing potential in the vicinity of the bubble. It would be interesting to extend these observations for other examples of solitons, as it may allow for further elucidation of the role and interpretation of thermodynamic volume in gravitational thermodynamics. We also considered the thermodynamics of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton in the canonical ensemble. After computing the on-shell action, we showed that for low temperatures the soliton dominates the canonical ensemble, while at higher temperature a Schwarzschild-AdStype black hole with lens space horizon dominates. The phase transition between these two states is of the same type as studied for the toroidal AdS black hole and the AdS soliton first studied in [34]. We examined the geodesics of the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton, finding no evidence suggestive of instability such as trapping of null geodesics. However, the time-like geodesics exhibit are oscillatory in nature analogous to geodesics in global AdS. Thus, an instability of the type shown in [4] for pure AdS may be present also for these solitons. Investigating this in more detail is something we hope to return to in the future. Finally, we studied the separable solutions to the massless Klein-Gordon equation on this background. Via numerical and approximate analytical methods, we find a set of modes that oscillate, never decaying, analogous to AdS. We find no evidence of frequencies with a non-vanishing imaginary component. Using the WKB approximation, we have been able to study the separation between successive overtones, showing that it is well-approximated by the light-crossing time of the geometry by radial null geodesics. We have found it possible to understand the normal mode frequencies by piecing together two approximations. The first involves an analysis of the equation in the vicinity of the value p\u2192 2. While this does not correspond to a physical soliton solution, the radial equation in this limit reduces to\n10After the first version of this manuscript appeared, Edgar Shaghoulian brought to our attention [22], where the same observation was made for the partition functions of CFTs on lens spaces. Our result for the connection between Eguchi-Hanson-AdS and the AdS soliton could be inferred from these results.\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nthat for AdS5/Z2, which admits analytic solutions. The second approximation involves the p\u2192\u221e limit of the radial equation, which reduces to the wave equation on the AdS soliton. Joining the two approximations together gives a quite accurate approximation for the normal modes of the Eguchi-Hanson-AdS5 soliton for any physical value of p in terms of a single parameter that must be numerically determined: the normal modes for the AdS soliton. In an approximate sense, one can then consider the normal modes of the Eguchi-Hanson solitons as interpolating between those of the orbifold AdS5/Z2 and the AdS soliton. There remain a number of areas for future investigation. First among these, along the lines of understanding potential mechanisms for instability, would be an understanding of the gravitational perturbations of the geometry. This task is simplified since the solution is cohomogeneity-one, allowing for the techniques of [45] to be used. An understanding of these perturbations may hint toward the existence of \u2018resonating\u2019 solutions constructible as non-linear extensions of the normal mode solutions [46, 47]. It would furthermore be interesting to understand the implications of these geometries within the AdS/CFT correspondence, where they may be relevant for understanding aspects of confined phases of CFTs on lens space geometries [36, 48, 49]. It would also be interesting to understand the role of higher-curvature corrections for these geometries [50\u201352]."

In this appendix, we briefly compare this computation with holographic renormalization, and in particular map the choice of gauge to a choice of quadratic counterterms.11\n11We thank the anonymous referee for encouraging us to elaborate on this connection.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nConsider the following counterterm action,\nIct = 1\n8\u03c0G\n\u222b d4x \u221a h [3 ` + `4R+ ` 3 ( \u03b11R 2 + \u03b12RabRab + \u03b13\u03c74 )] , (A.1)\nwhere \u03c74 = RabcdRabcd \u2212 4RabRab + R2 is the Gauss-Bonnet density. This counterterm action includes the terms necessary to cancel all divergences coming from the bulk action and Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms. The quadratic terms included here are not necessary to cancel divergences. Nonetheless, these terms can have the effect of shifting the action by a solution-independent constant, as we will now show. Without presenting details, the computation of the Euclidean action proceeds in exactly the same manner as discussed in the main text. Now, with the quadratic counterterms we arrive at the final result\nIE = \u2212 \u03c0a4\u03b2 8`2pG + 3\u03c0`2\u03b2 32pG (1 + 96\u03b11 + 32\u03b12) , (A.2)\nwhere the contributions from the quadratic counterterms are manifest. It is then a trivial matter to obtain the mass,\nM = \u2212 \u03c0a 4 8`2pG + 3\u03c0`2 32pG (1 + 96\u03b11 + 32\u03b12) , (A.3)\n= MAM + 3\u03c0`2 32pG (1 + 96\u03b11 + 32\u03b12) . (A.4)\nHere, in the second line, we have introduced MAM which denotes the Ashtekar-Magnon mass computed in the main text. In the absence of the quadratic counterterms, the mass computed via holographic renormalization differs from the AM mass by a constant term,\nM0 = 3\u03c0`2 32pG . (A.5)\nThis term has the same origin as the Casimir energy present for global AdS with spherical boundary \u2014 see e.g. [30]. By restricting to the family of quadratic counterterms\nIquadct = 1\n8\u03c0G\n\u222b d4x \u221a h [ `3 ( \u03b11R 2 \u2212 ( 1 32 + 3\u03b11 ) RabR ab + \u03b13\u03c74 )] , (A.6)\nthe M0 term can be eliminated and the mass computed via holographic renormalization agrees with the Ashtekar-Magnon mass. We can also identify the gauge ambiguity in the Komar mass (3.11) in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic counterterms introduced above. Comparing the mass computed via holographic renormalization with (3.11) we identify\nC1 = \u2212 a4 6 \u2212 ( 6\u03b11 + 2\u03b12 + 1 16 ) L4 . (A.7)\nWe then see how the appropriate choice of quadratic counterterms described above yields the value of C1 chosen in the main text. A few comments are in order. The main thing we have done here is to show how the gauge ambiguity in the Komar potential can be directly related to the coefficients of certain\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nquadratic terms in the counterterm action. The relationship between the AM mass and holographic renormalization has been previously explored in certain cases [55, 56]. A term such as M0 is present only for even boundary dimensions. In odd boundary dimensions the Ashtekar-Magnon mass agrees with that mass computed via holographic renormalization using the standard counterterms. It would be interesting to perform a similar analysis for the Komar mass, in particular demonstrating how the gauge ambiguity is related to ambiguities in the counterterm action under more general circumstances."

            "heading": "B Solution of the radial equation via the shooting method",
            "text": "In this section, we provide independent confirmation for the results obtained via the pseudospectral method. To this end, we consider the solution of the radial equation via the shooting method. We construct two numerical solutions of the radial equation. One solution begins near the bubble at r = a, using a power series solution of the differential equation in this neighbourhood to construct initial conditions, along with an initial guess for the eigenvalue \u03c9. This solution is integrated outward, toward r =\u221e, using the standard built-in numerical methods of Mathematica. The second numerical solution proceeds in much the same way, but begins near the asymptotic boundary, and is integrated inward toward r = a. The idea is simple: if \u03c9 has been chosen correctly, then the solution must be everywhere regular, and moreover, the two numerical solutions should agree over the domain. However, since the equation is linear, and both R(r) and cR(r) for some constant c are equally valid solutions, it is not so simple to directly compare the solutions obtained by integrating from either end. (As there is no simple way to ensure consistent normalization from the different starting points.) Instead, we compare a logarithmic derivative,\nR\u2032in/out Rin/out , (B.1)\nof the numerical solutions at intermediate points. In this way, differences in the normalization of the solution can be eliminated. Matching of the logarithmic derivatives of the two numerically constructed solutions over the domain is taken to mean the correct value of \u03c9 has been identified. As the purpose of this method is to serve as independent confirmation of the pseudospectral results, we will not perform an exhaustive analysis here. Rather, we will present a few instances that demonstrate consistency of the two approaches. We show in figure 8 an example of how the process works. The graphs show the logarithmic derivative of the solution over the domain u \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. The blue curves are those solutions obtained by numerically integrating the equation beginning at u = \u22121, while the red curves are those solutions obtained by numerically integrating the equation beginning from u = +1. The three graphs correspond to three different choices of the eigenvalue \u03c9, while we have set p = 3, n = 0 and k = 0 here. The pseudospectral method outputs a value \u03c9PS = 5.2985999 \u2014 this choice of \u03c9 appears in the rightmost graph. The leftmost graph corresponds to the choice \u03c9 = 5.2, while the center one corresponds to \u03c9 = 5.4. For both\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\ncases shown where \u03c9 is different from \u03c9PS, the two solutions are clearly in disagreement. However, for the choice \u03c9 = \u03c9PS the curves are visually indistinguishable over much of the domain, except for very near the end points.12 This is consistent with \u03c9 = \u03c9PS being the correct choice for a consistent solution.\nIt is also insightful to understand the difference in the in/out solutions as a function of \u03c9, to ensure that the implementation of the pseudospectral method is not missing certain overtones, or returning incorrect eigenvalues. To this end, it is useful to introduce an integrated residual. Of course, for any finite resolution, we expect that the numerical solution that begins from u = \u22121 to blow up sufficiently close to u = +1, and vice versa for the solution that begins from u = +1. Therefore, an integrated residual should focus on an intermediate domain where both solutions can be expected to be accurate. For this, we (arbitrarily) choose u \u2208 [\u22121/2, 1/2]. Another issue is the following. When \u03c9 becomes larger than the fundamental frequency, the solution possesses a zero somewhere in the domain. (The number of zeros increases as \u03c9 becomes larger than the various overtones). This leads to poles in the logarithmic derivative \u2014 see the center plot of figure 8 for an example. To remedy this, it is convenient to work with an integrated reciprocal residual,\nRes(\u03c9) = \u222b 1 2\n\u2212 12\ndu\n|\u2202u logRout \u2212 \u2202u logRin| . (B.2)\nViewed as a function of \u03c9, the residual Res(\u03c9) will peak when the difference between the two solutions tends to zero. We can identify those peaks as the values of \u03c9 where a consistent solution exists.\nWe show a few representative examples in figure 9. In these plots, the peaks correspond to values of \u03c9 for which the boundary value problem admits a sensible solution. In all cases, these peaks correspond exactly to those values of \u03c9 obtained via the spectral method. No additional values of \u03c9 have been obtained, and no errors have been determined.\n12Quantitatively, the difference in solutions is on the order of 10\u22126 over the interval u \u2208 [\u22121/2, 1/2].\n\u2013 34 \u2013"

            "text": "As discussed in the numerical solution of the radial equation, it is fruitful to consider the radial equation for arbitrary values of p. In particular, we have discussed the numerical observation that the behaviour of the eigenvalue \u03c9 rapidly becomes dominated at large p by a linear dependence. This fact can be explored in more detail, semi-analytically, to give a better understanding of that result.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nConsider the radial equation (5.7) and perform the transformation\nr = za , (C.1)\nwhich maps the domain to z \u2208 [1,\u221e).

Consider (C.2) in the limit where p is very large. Doing so, it becomes clear that the leading-order behaviour in each term behaves as O(p2). Thus, a consistent possibility is for the dominant p-dependence of \u03c9 to be such that\n\u03c9 \u223c \u03b1 ` p (C.3)\nat large p. We can extract the equation that governs this behaviour and determines \u03b1. Rescale \u03c9 = \u03b1p and peel off the terms in the differential equation that behave as O(p2) at large p. For consistency of notation, let us call Rp(z) in this limit h0(z). Carrying this out, we find the following differential equation:\n0 = (\u22121 + z4)h\u2032\u20320(z) + (\u22121 + 5z4)\nz h\u20320(z) + 4\n( n2z4 1\u2212 z4 + \u03b1 2 ) h0(z) . (C.4)\nBy determining the values of \u03b1 for which regular solutions to the above equation exist, we can determine the large p slope of the eigenvalues \u03c9. Note that it is only the quantum number n (= m/p) that enters into the equation, as k has no fixed dependence on p. Thus, the eigenvalues \u03b1 = \u03b1N,n are characterized by two numbers: the overtone N and the quantum number n. In other words, there is an \u2018emergent degeneracy\u2019 at large p: the eigenvalues for all choices of k are effectively the same, provided that p > k is sufficiently large. Unfortunately, we have not been able to solve this problem analytically (the equation is of Heun type). However, it is straight-forward to apply the same pseudospectral numerical techniques to this problem. We do not repeat the basic set up of this problem, and proceed directly to the results. Some selected values of \u03b1N,n are presented in table 2. These have been computed using the pseudospectral method to the accuracy shown in the table. While there is not a clear, discernible pattern for smaller values of n, it is clear that when n becomes large we have \u03b1N,n \u2248 n. Unfortunately, it becomes increasingly expensive to perform the computations when n becomes very large. Computing \u03b1N,n to five decimal places requires a Chebychev discretization of more than 1000 points when n exceeds about 1000.\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 1 4\nValues of \u03b1N,n n N\n0 1 2\n0 1.70203 2.93798 4.15256 1 2.42243 3.61436 4.80816 2 3.25439 4.38480 5.54238 3 4.14123 5.21301 6.33085 4 5.05869 6.07883 7.15802 5 5.99504 6.97048 8.01368 6 6.94397 7.88064 8.89089 7 7.90176 8.80456 9.78483 8 8.86607 9.73904 10.69202 9 9.83533 10.68180 11.60991 10 10.80848 11.63122 12.53658"

It is possible to do somewhat better than this, without encountering additional obstructions. To this end, we approach the problem as one in perturbation theory, expanding in the small parameter \u03c1 = 1/p.\nWe begin by expanding the eigenvalue and the eigenfunction as a perturbative series in \u03c1:\n\u03c12Rp(z) = h0(z) + \u03c1h1(z) + \u03c12h2(z) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (C.5) \u03c12\u03c92 = \u03b12N,n + \u03c1\u03b21 + \u03c12\u03b22 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

In general, determining the corrections requires knowledge of both the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions at previous orders. However, a happy accident at O(\u03c1) allows for direct determination of \u03b21. The differential operator for h1(z) is identical to that determining h0(z), allowing for all terms involving derivatives to be eliminated. The problem then reduces to an algebraic equation that determines \u03b21, with the result\n\u03b21 = 2n(1 + 2k) .

The limit should be taken at fixed cosmological scale `, so that the theory under consideration is not altered. To this end, we write a = A ` and consider the limit p\u2192 2. This is simple, and just results in A \u2192 0.

The metric on the sections of constant (t, r) is that of the projective space S3/Z2. The analysis of the wave equation on this space is useful for understanding the normal modes of Eguchi-Hanson-AdS for smaller values of p.\nD.1 Solution of the radial equation as p \u2192 2\nWhile (regular) Eguchi-Hanson solitons exist only for integer p \u2265 3, it is sensible from the mathematical point of view to study properties of the radial equation (5.7) without this restriction imposed on p. Within this line of thought, the case p = 2 is special, since for p = 2 the parameter a vanishes. That is, if we directly substitute p = 2 into the radial equation, it reduces to the radial equation for a scalar field on AdS, but with a special choice m = 2n inherited from the fact that the limiting geometry is not globally AdS5, but instead the quotient space AdS5/Z2. In this special case, the equation can be solved directly.\nSubstituting p = 2 into the radial equation we obtain,\n0 = r2(r2 + `2)R\u2032\u2032(r) + r(3`2 + 5r2)R\u2032(r) + `2 ( \u22124(k + n)(1 + k + n) + ` 2r2\u03c92\n`2 + r2\n) R(r) .\n(D.2) After setting L = 1, the above equation has the following solution in terms of hypergeometric functions\nR(r) = (1 + r2)\u03c9/2 [ C1r 2(\u22121\u2212k\u2212n) 2F1 ( \u22121\u2212 k \u2212 n+ \u03c92 , 1\u2212 k \u2212 n+ \u03c9 2 ,\u22122k \u2212 2n,\u2212r 2 )\n+ C2r2(k+n)2F1 ( k + n+ \u03c92 , 2 + k + n+ \u03c9 2 , 2(1 + k + n),\u2212r 2 )] . (D.3)\nEnforcing the boundary conditions proceeds in exactly the same manner as when studying the wave equation on AdS. To ensure regularity as r \u2192 0 we must set C2 = 0.

(D.4)\nTo obtain the proper fall off, we must have the first two terms vanish, so that the radial solution decays at O(r\u22124). Obviously, we cannot set C1 = 0, since this results in the trivial solution. Therefore, we use the property of the gamma function that \u0393[\u2212N ] =\u221e. Then, taking \u03c9 to be a positive quantity, we obtain the solution:\n\u03c9 (p=2) N,k,n = 2 (2 + k + n+N) . (D.5)\nRemarkably, this analytic result matches with numerical results, despite the fact that the limit p\u2192 2 is in a sense singular.13 Numerical indications suggest that the eigenvalues \u03c9 of the radial equation have a well-defined limit as p \u2192 2 with result the same as that given just above:\n\u03c9p\u21922 + N,k,n = \u03c9 (p=2) N,k,n = 2 (2 + k + n+N) , (D.6)\nwhereN is the overtone. We initially deduced this form by inspection, computing numerically values of \u03c9 as a function of p in the close vicinity of p = 2 for several values of n and k.14 To highlight the convergence of the numerical scheme in the limit p\u2192 2, we include in figure 10 relevant plots. The top row depicts the case n = 0, k = 0 with p = 2 + 10\u22123, while in the bottom row the case n = 1, k = 0 is shown \u2014 the results for different parameters are qualitatively similar. The top left plot shows the numerically computed value for the fundamental frequency as a function of the number of points used in the Chebychev discretization. The result converges to (D.6) from above/below depending on whether the number of points is odd/even. In the top right plot, we show the difference between the numerical results computed with N and N + 1 points. The plot shows clearly the convergence. The plots included in the bottom row illustrate how, for n 6= 0, convergence is much more rapid (this has been a general feature of all our analysis here; it is not particular to the p\u2192 2 limit.) Finally, in figure 11, we illustrate the dependence of the eigenvalues on n and k as a function of p in the case when p \u2192 2. The left plot shows n = 1 with the three curves corresponding to k = 0, 1, 2 (bottom to top), while the right plot shows the same values of k now for n = 2. The structure of the curve is rather close to a linear dependence on p, but this is not as accurate as in the large p limit.\n13Consider the behaviour in the vicinity of r = a.
