    "abstractText": "Pyrola corbieri Levl has been used to strengthen bones and nourish the kidney (the kidney governs the bone and is beneficial to the brain) by the local Miao people in China. However, the functional components and neurotrophic activity have not been reported. A new acidic homogeneous heteropolysaccharide named LTC-1 was obtained and characterized by periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, partial acid hydrolysis, GC\u2013MS spectrometry, methylation analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and its molecular weight was 3239 Da. The content of mannuronic acid (Man A) in LTC-1 was 46%, and the neutral sugar was composed of L-rhamnose (L-Rha), L-arabinose (L-Ara), D-xylose (D-Xyl), D-mannose (D-Man), D-glucose (D-Glc) and D-galactose (D-Gal) with a molar ratio of 1.00:3.63:0.86:1.30:6.97:1.30. The main chain of LTC-1 was composed of Glc, Gal, Man, Man A and the branched chain Ara, Glc, Gal. The terminal residues were composed of Glc and Gal. The main chain and branched chains were linked by (1\u21925)-linked-Ara, (1\u21923)-linked-Glc, (1\u21924)linked-Glc, (1\u21926)-linked-Glc, (1\u21923)-linked-Gal, (1\u21926)-linked-Gal, (1\u21923, 6)-linked-Man and ManA. Meanwhile, neurotrophic activity was evaluated through PC12 and primary hippocampal neuronal cell models. LTC-1 exhibited neurotrophic activity in a concentration-dependent manner, which significantly induced the differentiation of PC12 cells, promoted the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, enhanced the formation of the web architecture of dendrites, and increased the density of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons and the expression of PSD-95. These results displayed significant neurotrophic factor-like activity of LTC-1, which suggests that LTC-1 is a potential treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "The progressive loss of neuronal cells is a common pathological symptom of neurodegenerative diseases in the brain [1]. It might be important to employ the localized delivery of neurotrophic factors to prevent or treat this cell loss [2]. Neurotrophin is an especially important protein that encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses, maintains the function of mature neurons and partially protects neurons against cell death [3]. The beneficial effects of neurotrophic factors on depression and antidepressant diseases have been recognized previously [4\u20136]. However, protein neurotrophic factors have difficulty crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier, resulting in difficulty in clinical administration [7]. When degraded before arriving at the action sites, only trace amounts of this kind of protein are in effect. Recently, apart from some molecules [8,9], it was reported that polysaccharides have neurotrophic factor-like effects, and a variety of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041544 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544 2 of 15\nnatural polysaccharides, including MAPs from Opuntia Milpa Alta [10], polysaccharides from Rosa roxburghii [11], GLPS from Ganoderma lucidum and fucoid from brown seaweeds, were reported to exhibit neurotrophic or neuroprotective activity [12]. The neuroprotective effect of polysaccharides has received increasing attention. Pyrola Linn. is a morphologically distinctive genus belonging to the Pyrolaceae family, according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group\u2019s most recent classification [13]. This genus mostly occurs in the northern temperate zone, containing approximately 30 species, with 27 species in China. P. corbieri Levl. is predominantly distributed in karst areas in Guizhou Province, southwestern China. It has been used for the treatment of weakness, cough and kidney diseases for a long time in Chinese folk medicine and is used to nourish the kidney, strengthen bones, and enhance immunity by the local Miao people [14]. Modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that P. corbieri Levl. herb has high nutritional and health value, good antioxidation, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, and cartilage protection and can effectively improve the symptoms of coronary heart disease [15\u201317]. It has been reported that P. corbieri Levl. mainly contains polysaccharides, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic glycosides, quinones, etc. [18\u201322]. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the kidney governs bone and is beneficial to the medullary brain. To investigate the effect of invigorating the brain and neurotrophic activity of P. corbieri Levl, we obtained a new polysaccharide, LTC-1, and evaluated its neurotrophic activity through PC12 and primary hippocampal neuronal cell models."

The polysaccharide did not contain protein or nucleic acids according to the lack of absorption at 280 or 260 nm by UV spectrophotometry. GPC analysis of LTC-1 revealed a single symmetric peak, indicating that it was a homogeneous polysaccharide (shown in Figure S1). LTC-1\u2019s average molecular weight was 3239 Da, according to GPC analysis. The FT-IR spectrum of LTC-1 (Figure 1) revealed strong bands at 3423.59 and 2923.75 cm\u22121, which were attributed to the O-H and C-H vibrations of the polysaccharide. The C=O stretching vibration caused the band at 1623.36 cm\u22121. The peaks at 1323.35, 1242.11, 1038.33 and 1023.48 cm\u22121 corresponded to the O-H variable angle vibrations of glycoid hydroxyl (C-O-H) and C-H variable angle vibrations. The characteristic absorption peak at 937.23 cm\u22121 was due to the C-O-C stretching vibration of the pyran ring, while the band at 884.23 cm\u22121 was attributed to the variable-angle vibration of the C\u2013H of the pyran ring."

The higher the concentration, the closer the cell morphology was to neuron-like cells and the more similar the cell morphology of the positive control group. Especially when the polysaccharide concentration reached 30 \u00b5g/mL, cells with obvious neuron-like morphology were observed (Figure 3). LTC-1 promoted the extension of PC12 cell protrusions in a dose-dependent manner. With increasing polysaccharide concentration, the proportion of protruding cells gradually increased. When the LTC-1 concentration was 10 \u00b5g/mL, the proportion of protruding cells was 13.33%. When the concentration was increased to 50 \u00b5g/mL, the proportion of protruding cells increased by nearly three times, to 38.2% (Figure 4A). However, the time dependence of LTC-1 in promoting protrusion extension was not obvious. After LTC-1 acted on the cells for 48 h, the change in the ratio of protrusion cells was not obvious, and even a slight decrease in the ratio of protrusion cells was found from the statistical chart (Figure 4B).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544 5 of 15\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16\nmorphology of the positive control group.

            "text": "There are several methods for determining polysaccharide monosaccharide composition, and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) has long been the preferred method due to its high sensitivity, simple processing, and time savings [26]. Therefore, this study investigates the composition of monosaccharides in LTC-1 using a gas-mass spectrometry method. In our previous study [18], at that time, it was also the first report of polysaccharide LTC-II from the whole herb Pyrola corbieri Levl. LTC-II was discovered to have a molecular weight of 22,000 Da. and found to be arabinose, mannose, glucose, galactose in a molar ratio of 35.2:1.0:13.4:4.2. The main chain of LTC-II is composed of glucose, mannose, galactose and the branched chain possessed arabinose, glucose, galactose. The main chain and branched chains are linked by (1\u21926)-linkaged glucose and (1\u21925)-linkedarabinose, respectively. In this study, a new acidic homogeneous heteropolysaccharide named LTC-1 differs significantly from LTC-II in terms of molecular weight, monomer composition, and content. Neurological diseases are common neurological disorders that significantly affect patient quality of life. Neurotrophic factors (NTFS) have therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disorders [27]. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on neurotrophins. In addition to proteins [28] and small molecules [29], a number of polysaccharides have also been reported to possess neuroprotective/neurotrophic effects in vitro and in vivo [30,31]. Neurons typically consist of a single axon and multiple dendrites, and neurite outgrowth is the first step for the formation of dendrites and axons, which is an important hallmark of neuron maturation and differentiation [32]. The elongation and branching of neuronal processes are critical links in the advancement of the brain and are key to the survival of the neuronal network system. Processes are of great significance for the construction of the entire neural circuit and the transmission of information between neurons [33]. The growth\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544 9 of 15\nof neuronal processes is a key link in understanding and solving nerve regeneration and some degenerative diseases [34]. The hippocampus is one of the oldest neuromodulatory phylogenetic systems and has a highly polarized lamellar structure and a relatively independent distribution of neurons [35]. Due to their clear boundary with the surrounding brain tissue and easy separation, hippocampal neurons are often used in experiments as cell models for the study of neuroprotective properties [36]. At the same time, primary neuronal cells retain much of the activity of in situ neurons [37]. Therefore, it is more accurate to use it as a screening model for specific cell populations, closer to the specific location in vivo of cell origin, and suitable as an observation model for neurite outgrowth. In this study, LTC-1 neurotrophic activity was studied in combination with folk applications. Experiments on the neurotrophic activity of LTC-1 were carried out through PC12 and primary hippocampal neuronal cell models. These findings suggest that LTC-1 has neurotrophic factor-like activity. This exciting work not only enriches the types of neurotrophic active substances but also provides scientific data for the development and utilization of undeveloped natural resources."

Monosaccharide Composition Analysis\nApproximately 5 mg of LTC-1 was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 2 M, 2 mL) and hydrolyzed at 100 \u25e6C for 8 h. After TFA was removed by vacuum evaporation, the precipitate was reduced in 2 mL distilled water with NaBH4 and acetylated with acetic anhydride (1 mL) and pyridine (1 mL). Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) was used to analyse the resulting alditol acetates using an HP6890 instrument outfitted with an Agilent 19091S-433 HP-5MS quartz capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 m) and an Agilent 5975C MS detector. The temperature program ranged from 50 \u25e6C to 300 \u25e6C at an 8 \u25e6C/min rate, with a 10-min stop at 300 \u25e6C.\n4.4.3. Periodate Oxidation-Smith Degradation\nLTC-1 (25 mg) was oxidized in the presence of 15 mM NaIO4 (25 mL) and stored at 4 \u25e6C in the dark. The retest lasted an average interval of 5 h. NaIO4 consumption was quantitatively measured using the UV spectrophotometric method. Ethylene glycol was added to remove excess periodate after the sample solution was completely oxidized with stable absorbance. The periodate product solution (2 mL) was sampled to calculate the yield of formic acid by titration with 5 mM NaOH (bromocresol purple as an indicator), and the remainder was extensively dialyzed against distilled water for 48 h, vacuum concentrated below 40 \u00b0C and then reduced with NaBH4 for 24 h at room temperature and dialyzed again for 48 h. After the pH was adjusted to 5.5 using acetic acid, the mixture was dialyzed for 48 h against water. The alcohol derivative of polysaccharide was lyophilized and then hydrolyzed in 2 mL 2 M TFA at 120 \u00b0C for 2 h. After TFA was removed by vacuum evaporation, 1 mL acetic anhydride and 1 mL pyridine were used to acetylate the hydrolysate. The standard monosaccharides were converted into their respective acetates as described above and analyzed by GC\u2013MS.\n4.4.4. Partial Acid Hydrolysis LTC-1 (20 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of 0.05 M TFA, hydrolyzed at 90 \u25e6C for 8 h, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The residue was marked as part I. After TFA evaporated from the supernatant, the hydrolysate was dialyzed for 24 h with distilled water, and then the outer part of the dialysis membrane was concentrated, dried and marked as\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544 11 of 15\npart IV. The inner part was concentrated to a small volume, and anhydrous ethanol was added for alcohol precipitation to ensure that the alcohol concentration was not less than 80%, which was left overnight and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The precipitate was part II, and the supernatant was part III. Parts I\u2013IV were operated according to the above \u201cmonosaccharide composition analysis\u201d to prepare alditol acetate derivatives. The monosaccharide composition was determined by GC\u2013MS.\n4.4.5. Methylation Analysis\nLTC-1 (10 mg) was methylated three times in dimethyl sulfoxide with powdered sodium hydroxide and methyl iodide using the modified Ciucanu method described by Needs and Swlvendran [41]. The lack of hydroxyl absorption in the IR spectrum at 3400 cm\u22121 confirmed the completeness of methylation. The permethylated product was depolymerized with 1 mL 85% formic acid at 100 \u25e6C for 4 h before being hydrolyzed with 2 M TFA for 6 h at 100 \u25e6C. The residues were reduced and acetylated. The resulting products were subjected to GC\u2013MS analysis. The analysis and detection conditions were the same as above for the \u201cmonosaccharide composition analysis\u201d. LTC-1 (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water, 10 mg carbondimine was added, and the pH of the sample solution was adjusted to 4.8 using 0.04 M HCl, and the sample solution was placed at room temperature for 1 h. After 30 mg NaHB4 was added and reacted at 50 \u25e6C for 1.5 h, 2 M acetic acid was added to quench the reaction. The sample was subjected to dialysis with tap water for 48 h and distilled water for 24 h. The M-hydroxybiphenyl method was used to detect whether the reduction was complete. After uronic acid reduction as described by Taylor and Conrad [42], the reduction intermediate was methylated according to the above \u201cmethylation analysis\u201d."

PC12 Cell Culture and Administration Treatment\nPC12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% horse serum (HS) at a density of approximately 3 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 per 6-well plate. The cells were cultured for 12 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified environment of 95% air and 5% CO2. Different concentrations of LTC-1 (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mg/mL) were added and further incubated for 48 h, and culture medium (DMEM + 1% FBS and 2% HS) of PC12 and NGF (final concentration: 30 ng/mL) was used as a blank control and positive control, respectively.\n4.5.2. Morphological Observation and Neurite Growth Analysis of PC12 Cells\nA phase contrast microscope was used to examine cell morphology (Olympus CKX41; Tokyo, Japan), and neurite length was quantified. Cells were observed under a microscope with four to five visual fields randomly selected for each well, and images were captured. 3\u20135 significantly differentiated cells were chosen from each field, and the length of their longest neurite was measured. For each concentration, at least 100 cells were scored. Each data point was repeated three times.\n4.5.3. Measurement of Acetylcholinesterase Activity PBS was added to the cells, mixed well and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, and the supernatant was discarded. Cell lysate was added to the pellet, incubated in an ice bath for 30 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 \u25e6C, and the supernatant was extracted into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Ten microliters of supernatant was extracted for protein quantitative detection. The remaining supernatant was added to acetylthiocholine iodide and Ellman reagent to react and then immediately placed into a microplate reader, and the readings were read at 0 and 15 min at 412 nm wavelength.\n4.5.4. GFP Transgenic Mouse Hippocampal Neuron Culture and Administration Treatment Hippocampi were extracted from 18-day-old GFP-transgenic mouse embryos, and neuronal cell culture was carried out as previously described. Briefly, hippocampi were\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1544 12 of 15\nplaced in an ice-cold balanced salt solution in a sterile 35 mm petri dish. The hippocampal tissues were isolated and chopped into three pieces of 1 mm under a microscissor and digested with 0.25% trypsin, HBSS and 1 \u00b5g/mL DNAase at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 1 mL FBS. One-third of the medium was changed every two days, and the cells were cultured up to day 14. Polysaccharide and 0.1 mM Trolox were added to the medium.\n4.5.5. Long-Term Recording of Living Cells\nAn X-Y automated positioning system was used to resolve cell positions over multiple time points. The primary and secondary dendrites with clear dendritic spines were selected for experimental recording, and photographs were taken every 0.5 h and continued for 24 h at Living Cell Station (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA). The dendrite length was calculated from the neuron cell body to the dendrite terminal. When there was a branch, one of the branches was included in the dendrite of the previous level, and the length of at least 30 dendrites was counted; then, the average value was obtained. Averaged from >300 dendritic spines out of 10\u201330 dendrites on at least 6 neurons. The length of a dendritic spine was the distance from the root on the dendrite to the very tip of the head, and the size of the head depended on the width at the widest point of the head of the spine. For the measurement of dendritic spine size, a clear area 50\u2013200 \u00b5m from the soma in the primary dendritic spines of each neuron was used for statistics. Its density statistics include all dendritic spines on the entire dendritic section. The size of all dendritic spines on the neuron was counted first, and the average value of each neuron was taken. Then, the average value of all neurons was taken.\n4.5.6. Western Blot Analysis\nProtein concentrations in total cell lysates were determined using a Pierce BCA protein kit and the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cultures were rinsed three times with D-Hanks before being scraped and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged for supernatant collection. Each lane of an 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS\u2013PAGE) was loaded with approximately 15 g for electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using standard procedures. The membranes were blocked at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST; 20 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20; pH 7.6) for 2 h and then incubated at 4 \u25e6C overnight with the primary antibody against PSD-95 (1:2000 dilution). The blots were washed three times in TBST for 10 min each and then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. An enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate kit was used to detect immunoreactivity signals. The gray density level difference was determined using Photoshop software. As an internal control, a rabbit anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody was used."

However, LTC-1 is urgently needed to confirm its molecular structure through NMR data, it was not performed because a solvent that would dissolve it well could not be found. Meanwhile, LTC-1 demonstrated significant neurotrophic factor-like activity, increasing neurite length, enhanced the formation of the web architecture of dendrites and increased the density of dendritic spines in vitro. We will conduct in vivo experiments of neurotrophic properties in the future. Therefore, LTC-1 has tremendous potential as a brain-protective agent or as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041544/s1, Figure S1: GPC analysis of LTC-1; Figure S2: Part of GC-MS TIC from derivative of LTC-1 Smith degradation; Figure S3: 0riginal western blot for three repeats; Table S1: The result of LTC-1 periodate oxidation; Table S2: The result of LTC-1 partial hydrolysis.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed to this work as follows.
