    "abstractText": "The present work is focused on the physicochemical characteristics, chemical composition, and some biological activities of Koelreuteria paniculata seed oil. The glyceride oil, obtained with a Soxhlet apparatus by extraction with hexane, was characterized by a relatively high oil content (over 20%), and it is defined as a non-drying oil (iodine value\u201444 gI2/100 g) with good oxidative stability (over 50 h). There were identified 11 fatty acids, 6 sterols, 3 tocopherols, and 6 phospholipids, as the last group was reported for the first time. The major components among them were\u2014monounsaturated eicosenoic and oleic acids, \u03b2-sitosterol, \u03b2-tocopherol, and phosphatidylcholine. The in vitro tests demonstrated DNA protective activity and a lack of cytotoxicity of the oil, data that has been reported for the first time. The in vitro MTT test of the oil on HT-29 and PC3 cell lines did not indicate antitumor activity. The seed oil studied contains valuable bio-components, which have proven benefits for human health, and that is why it could be used in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products.",

Different classes of primary and secondary metabolites, such as unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and others\u2014responsible for the antioxidant potential of plants have been identified [2,3]. These phytochemicals, through various mechanisms, help to alleviate oxidative stress and prevent damage from ROS (reactive oxygen species)-DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, etc., which are the root cause of the occurrence of various human diseases (cancer, diabetes, digestive and neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune pathologies, etc., [4\u20136]. Unsaturated fatty acids are known to have a proven beneficial effect on the human body. A positive correlation between the consumption of essential fatty\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12112230 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 2 of 15\nacids and the prevention of heart disease, hypertension, inflammation, cancer, neurological diseases, etc., has also been proven [3]. These valuable food compounds can be obtained from both various animal and vegetable oils [7,8]. A possible source of bioactive components with antioxidant and other beneficial properties could be the Asian tree species Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm. (\u201cGolden rain tree\u201d) from the Sapindaceae family. The species was brought to Europe for decorative purposes, but it spread rapidly, and in Bulgaria, it is considered potentially invasive [9]. The plant species is used in traditional Chinese medicine, and nowadays it is the subject of phytochemical and biological studies. The content of primary metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, amino acids, fatty acids and their esters, as well as various secondary metabolites (polyphenols, tannins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenes, terpenoids, sterols, saponins, etc.), has been proven mainly in extracts and their fractions from different plant parts [10\u201316]. The compounds contained in K. paniculata are the basis for determination of the biological activities. The gene-protective potential of the leaf extracts and their fractions (chloroform, ethyl acetate, hexane, butanol), by applying molecular genetic methods, has been proven [4,17\u201319]. The DNA-protective capacity of the flower, leaf, and stem bark ethanolic extracts against oxidative damage were proved by [20]. Antioxidant activities of K. paniculata have been reported for different fractions of leaf extracts [4,17,18], carotenoid fraction of flowers [21], and extracts from aerial plant parts [20]. Antiproliferative activity of K. paniculata extracts and carotenoid fraction against HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cells), and PC3 (prostate carcinoma) tumor cell lines were also reported [21,22]. Relatively less research is done on the glyceride oil of golden rain tree seeds. Evaluation of the nutritional value of the seeds characterizes it as a source of oil with high oil, protein, and fiber contents [23]. A high oil content (28\u201330%) and a low percentage of free fatty acids (0.91%) were found by [24]. Monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids are included in the composition of the seed oil of K. paniculata, among which are cis 11-eicosenoic, arachidonic, palmitic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic acids [24\u201327]. Other authors indicate eleven fatty acids in the seed oil, with eicosenoic acid being the most abundant [28]. The species is also of interest as a crop suitable for biofuel production, given the good characteristics of the seed oil\u2014it contains small amounts of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and has desirable values of iodine number and cetane number [24,25,27,28]. The present study is a continuation of our team\u2019s research on K. paniculata in search of valuable phytocomponents of useful applications. It aims to study the glyceride oil of K. paniculata seeds, namely its chemical composition, and physicochemical characteristics, as well as DNA protective, cytotoxic, and antitumor activities. This goal stems from the fact that there is a lack of research data on the biological activities of K. paniculata seed oil."

Fatty Acid Composition\nThe fatty acid composition of the seed oil was determined by gas chromatography (GC) [41]. About 100 mg of the oil was trans-esterified with sulfuric acid in methanol in order to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) [42]. Determination of FAMEs was performed on HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with Supelco SPTM\u20132560 Fused Silica Capillary Column (75 m \u00d7 0.18 mm \u00d7 0.14 \u00b5m (film thickness) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and a flame ionization detector (FID).

Determination of Sterols\nThree grams of the seed oil was saponificated with 2 N KOH and the unsaponifiables were extracted with hexane. Their content was determined gravimetrically [43]. Total sterols were isolated from the unsaponifiable matter by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and their content was determined spectrophotometrically (at 597 nm) [44]. Sterol composition was determined on HP 5890 gas chromatograph. It was equipped with DB\u20135 capillary column (25 m \u00d7 0.25 mm) and FID. The temperature was from 90 \u25e6C (3 min) up to 290 \u25e6C at a rate of 15 \u25e6C/min and then up to 310 \u25e6C at a rate of 4 \u25e6C/min (10 min). The detector temperature was 320 \u25e6C, while injector temperature was 300 \u25e6C. Hydrogen was the carrier gas. Identification was confirmed by comparison of retention times with a standard mixture of sterols [45]. The determination of the sterols was performed using a calibration curve of \u03b2-sitosterol (the concentration ranged from 0 to 3000 \u00b5g/mL). The linear regression coefficient (R2) was 0.9987, the limit of detection (LOD) was 91 \u00b5g/mL, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 295 \u00b5g/mL.\n2.2.5. Determination of Tocopherols\nTocopherols were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescent detection (295 nm of excitement and 330 nm of emission) using Nucleosil Si 50-5 column (250 mm \u00d7 4 mm). The mobile phase was hexane: dioxane, 96:4 (v/v) and the flow rate was 1 mL/min [46]. Tocopherol content was calculated on the base of the tocopherol peak areas in the sample vs. tocopherol peak area of a standard tocopherol solution.\n2.2.6. Determination of Phospholipids\nThe phospholipid classes were isolated by two-dimensional TLC [47]. The content was determined spectrophotometrically at 700 nm after mineralization of the phospholipid spots with a mixture of perchloric and sulfuric acid, 1:1 (v/v) [48].\n2.3. DNA Nicking Protection Assay 2.3.1. Reagents\nTrolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid), hydrogen peroxide solution, and potassium phosphate dibasic were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim am Albuch, Germany); di-Potassium hydrogen phosphate and iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); TBE buffer and Agarose SPI were purchased from Duchefa (Haarlem, The Netherlands).\n2.3.2. Determination of DNA Protection Activity\nThe DNA protective effect of the glyceride oil was assessed using supercoiled plasmid DNA (pUC19) as it is described (with minor modifications) by [20,49]. Briefly, one microliter of the preparation was suspended in 10 \u00b5L of 12% solution of methylated cyclodextrin (CAVASOL W7 M, Wacker Chemie AG, Munich, Germany) and then added to 600 ng of pUC19 and subsequently incubated with Fenton\u2019s reagent at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min.

            "text": "The contents of glyceride oil, proteins, carbohydrates, fiber, ash, and moisture in the seeds were determined (Table 1). K. paniculata seeds contain a high percentage of glyceride oil (over 20%). The total amount of carbohydrates (54.5%), among which starch was the best represented (14.2%), dominated over the proteins in the composition. The determined amounts of fiber (17.2%) characterize the seeds of K. paniculata as a good source of dietary fiber.\n* The samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. \u00bb\u2014the components noted are part of the total carbohydrates.\nOther research have also characterized K. paniculata seeds and the oil obtained from them, regarding the chemical composition and physicochemical parameters. The oil content in K. paniculata seeds, found in our study, is close to the previous findings [51], who determined that the glyceride oil content of the seeds was 22.2%. On the other hand, some authors found an oil content in K. paniculata seeds over 40% [23]. Obviously, the method of glyceride oil isolation is important for the amount obtained (cold pressing, petroleum ether extraction, and hexane extraction) [25]. The author found that the highest yield was obtained with petroleum ether extraction (35.66%), while for cold-pressed seeds and those extracted with hexane, it was lower\u201425.51% and 32.34%, respectively. The yield of K. paniculata seed oil was close to that reported for the well-known olive oil (20%) and sesame oil (19%) [52,53]. The protein and fiber amounts, found in the seeds, were lower than those reported in the previous studies, 18.95\u201320.11% and 26.13\u201328.12%, respectively [23], and the ash and moisture contents were in agreement with the data published by [25]\u20143.53% and 6.90%. It was established that the seeds from K. paniculata were rich in glyceride oil and carbohydrates, especially starch and dietary fibers which made them a good source of these components. Seven physicochemical characteristics of glyceride oil were determined (Table 2). The peroxide value indicates the degree of oxidation of the vegetable oils, and the value for this indicator for the examined oil was 10 meq O2/kg. The acid value determined the free fatty acid content of the oils and the present value was in accordance with the requirements\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 7 of 15\nfor glyceride oils (up to 4 mg KOH/g) [54]. The measured iodine value (44 gI2/100 g) characterizes K. paniculata seed oil as a non-drying oil. The oxidative stability of K. paniculata glyceride oil was over 50 h, indicating a high oxidative stability. The data for the other measured characteristics (saponification value, relative density, refractive index) are shown in Table 2.\nOxidative stability, h Over 50 * The sample was analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nThe peroxide value of the tested glyceride oil from K. paniculata seeds was twice to almost five times higher than the values obtained by [25]. On the other hand, the acid value was lower compared to the previous studies\u20141.27 and 1.89 mg KOH/g [25,27,28]. The saponification value of the studied oil from K. paniculata was higher than previously established by [25] and [28], and those of the iodine value were almost twice lower, compared to the studies by other authors [25,27,28,51]. The refractive index of the glyceride oil coincides with the previously reported values [51]. Another study also concluded good oxidative stability, based on the measured peroxide value and p-anisidine value [25]. The content of fat-soluble biologically active components in the seeds and in the glyceride oil of the golden rain tree was also determined (Table 3). The content of unsaponifiable matter in K. paniculata seed oil was found to be 1.7% in the oil (0.3% in the seeds, respectively). The main representatives from this fraction were sterols (0.4% in the oil and 0.1% in the seeds) and tocopherols (345 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg in the oil and in the seeds, respectively). Total sterols were about 24% from the fraction of the unsaponifiables. According to [54], the total content of sterols in the studied glyceride oil approaches the values of some widely used vegetable oils, such as sunflower (0.24\u20130.46%), cotton (0.27\u20130.67%) and soybeans (0.18\u20130.41%). The total content of the phospholipids accounted to 2.2% in the oil and 0.4% in the seeds, respectively, which was similar to the total phospholipids in soybean oil (1.5\u20133.0%) and soybean seeds (0.3\u20130.6%) [55].\nThe samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Different letters next to the values in the same column mean significant differences (p < 0.01) using Student\u2019s t-test.\nEleven fatty acids were identified in K. paniculata glyceride oil composition (Table 4). The main components were eicosenoic acid (46.5%), followed by oleic acid (41.8%). The content of saturated palmitic acid was 6.6%, and that of polyunsaturated linoleic acid\u20143.4%. The amount of the rest fatty acids identified varied between 0.1 and 0.7%. The percentage distribution of the different fatty acid classes in the oil composition is presented also in Table 4. Unsaturated fatty acids predominated in the oil (92.2%), with monounsaturated fatty acids being better represented than polyunsaturated fatty acids. The amount of saturated fatty acids in the lipid fraction was only 7.8%. The higher content of\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 8 of 15\nmonounsaturated fatty acids is due to the greater amount of omega-9 oleic and eicosenoic acids in the oil.\n* C 14:0\u2014myristic; C 14:1\u2014myristoleic; C 16:0\u2014palmitic; C 16:1\u2014palmitoleic; C 17:1\u2014heptadecenoic; C 18:0\u2014stearic; C 18:1\u2014oleic; C 18:2\u2014linoleic; C 20:1\u2014eicosenoic; C 20:5\u2014eicosapentaenoic; C 23:0\u2014tricosanoic; SFA\u2014saturated fatty acids; MUFA\u2014monounsaturated fatty acids; PUFA\u2014polyunsaturated fatty acids. ** The sample was analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\nHigh content of eicosenoic acid in the glyceride oil from the seeds of K. paniculata was also found in previous studies [24,25,27,28,51], where the amount varies between 43.3% and 48.5%. The same authors found that the content of oleic acid is from 21.77% to 32.0%, that of linoleic acid is from 7.01% to 13.0%, and that of palmitic acid is from 4.50% to 9.7%. Different results regarding the fatty acid composition of K. paniculata oil were published [26], who found that oleic acid is predominant (80.1%), and the content of the other fatty acids (palmitic, linoleic, stearic, and linoleic) is significantly low (respectively 8.0%, 6.7%, 4.0%, and 1.1%). The contents of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the glyceride oil from the studied K. paniculata seeds are in agreement with the data of previous studies, where unsaturated fatty acids predominate (from 84.1 to 88.5%), and that of saturated is between 11.5 and 15.9% [28]. Of the unsaturated fatty acids with a larger share were monounsaturated ones, the amount of which varied between 71.8 and 77.6% [25,28]. The consumption of foods rich in unsaturated fatty acids has many benefits for the human body\u2014it improves physical functioning, accelerates metabolism, and provides protection against autoimmune diseases, cancer, osteoarthritis, etc. These compounds support cellular activities such as cellular signaling, cellular structural integrity, regulation of blood pressure, glucose levels, inflammatory responses, blood clotting, skeletal muscle metabolism, etc., [56]. Summary information from multiple sources reports that they improve the condition of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. When taken as food supplements, their intake leads to a significant reduction in pain, the number of swollen and sensitive joints, as well as a reduction in disease activity, compared to the control group. The consumption of unsaturated fatty acids can be an adjunctive therapy for the successful control of rheumatoid arthritis [57]. Many studies are being focused on the health benefits of MUFA and especially of oleic acid. There are numerous evidence on the impact of high oleic diet on the decreasing rate of the coronary heart disease, diabetes type 2, hypertension and may have protective effect against stroke [58\u201360]. A diet with high content of eicosenoic acid is also observed to have beneficial effect toward obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions [61]. The high percentage content of biologically active substances obtained in the glyceride oil became the reason for determining its individual sterol, tocopherol, and phospholipid composition. The data are presented in Table 5. Six phytosterols were identified and the main component in the sterol fraction was \u03b2-sitosterol (75.9%), followed by stigmasterol\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 9 of 15\n(15.1%) and campesterol (6.6%). A smaller amount of \u22067-stigmasterol-corresponding to 1.9% was found. The content of \u22067-campesterol and brassicasterol was significantly low.\nThe samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. According to Tukey\u2019s HSD test (p < 0.01), different superscript letters denote significant differences. *\u2014not detected.\nThree components were identified in the individual tocopherol composition of the studied glyceride oil, the main representative of which was \u03b2-tocopherol (56.6% of the total tocopherol content), followed by \u03b3-tocopherol (33.4%) and \u03b1-tocopherol (10.0%) (Table 5). Six phospholipid classes were identified, which were distributed between 29.1% and 12.8%. The highest amount was phosphatidylcholine (29.1%), followed by phosphatidylinositol (17.5%), and the remaining phospholipids were represented in almost equal amounts\u2014 from 12.8% (diphosphatidylglycerol) to 14.2% (phosphatidylethanolamine). The individual phospholipid composition of K. paniculata seeds was determined for the first time in the present study. Vitamin E, sitosterol, and stigmasterol were also chromatographically identified in extracts of K. paniculata plant parts [13\u201316]. Phytosterols are a group of bioorganic molecules known for a long history of consumption as food and pharmaceutical products [62]. \u03b2-sitosterol, which was represented in the highest percentage content of the studied group of compounds, is one of the most abundant, naturally occurring phytosterols in plants. In the review of the above-cited authors, \u03b2-sitosterol has therapeutic value against various tumor cells (malignant tumors of the prostate, breast, kidney, pancreas, stomach, lung, and other cancers), confirmed by various pharmacological studies. Some of its antitumor mechanisms are indicated, which enables its use in the preparation of new antitumor drugs [62]. \u03b2-sitosterol is contained in various dietary and non-dietary plants. In vivo studies on mice proved its safety\u2014it does not cause genotoxicity and cytotoxicity [63]. In addition to being proven harmless, the authors report various beneficial health effects\u2014it reduces the risk of coronary disease, heart attack, and atherosclerosis; it lowers the level of low density lipid plasma cholesterol (LDL), as well as supports the body\u2019s natural recovery process. Other studies have shown the strong anti-inflammatory activity of \u03b2-sitosterol derived from plant extracts, accounted for by the release of histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandin [64]. Total tocopherol content of the examined oil from K. paniculata seeds was similar to those of grape seed oil (240\u2013410 mg/kg), safflower oil (240\u2013670 mg/kg) [54], and amaranth seed oil (54.2\u201355.5%) [65]. The three isoforms of vitamin E (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-tocopherol) in K. paniculata seed oil, proven in our study, represent a part of the eight isoforms, in which this vitamin exists. It has been found that some isoforms suppress the generation of new free radicals (\u03b1-tocopherol), and others neutralize the existing ones (\u03b3-tocopherol) [66]. Vitamin E is an essential antioxidant in cardiovascular disease prevention [67] and it plays a protective role in a number of diseases resulting from the action of free radicals\u2014atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, etc., [66]. Phospholipids are another well-represented bio-active group of the lipid fraction. They are the main components of cell membranes and they have various physiological properties that determine their pharmaceutical potential [68]. According to recent research, their ability to form liposomes makes them suitable carrier molecules for medicinal compounds. They can increasingly penetrate through the skin and, when applied locally, enhance the\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 10 of 15\neffectiveness of the active components. In addition, the formed phospholipid complexes are more stable compared to other lipids, which guarantees their stability and facilitates the preparation of substances for the treatment of various diseases [69]."

Antiproliferative activity was expressed as IC50 values (oil concentrations (\u00b5g/mL) required for 50% inhibition of cell growth). Cisplatin was used again as a standard to confirm the suitability of the used antitumor method. The obtained results are summarized and shown in Figure 4 and Table 7. Concentrations from 15 to 4000 \u00b5g/mL for the oil were tested. It is apparent that there is no activity up to 10 \u00b5g/mL, which is for all three cell lines. Such is observed at concentration above 1000 \u00b5g/mL. The selectivity (SI) is ratio of the investigated substance to normal and to tumor cell line. The higher index value means higher selectivity. In the present study, this was not reported in both the investigated cell lines. The obtained results showed that the tested oil did not show antiproliferative activity against the tested tumor and normal human cell lines. Moreover, no selectivity toward them was found. The information on the studied antitumor activity in the species is scarce, so a comparison cannot be made. Week antineoplastic potential on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) is reported for pure carotenoid fraction, isolated from flowers [21]. In our previous study, a significant antiproliferative activity on the HT-29 cell line was found for the flower and leaf ethanol extracts of K. paniculata and a weaker one for bark extract [22]. The study showed that extracts from the different plant parts of the tree species had an antitumor potential, but no such effect was confirmed for the glyceride seed oil. Other tumor cell lines could be tested in future studies.\nFoods 2023, 12, 2230 12 of 15\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nIn the present study, in vitro antiproliferative test were conducted on HT-29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and PC3 (prostate carcinoma) tumor cell lines and MCF-10A (normal human epithelial cells).

            "text": "The evaluation of the chemical composition of K. paniculata seeds showed that they are rich in glyceride oil, dietary fiber, protein, and starch. Glyceride oil has high oxidant stability, it is rich in healthy unsaturated fatty acids (mainly omega-9 eicosenoic and oleic acids), vitamin E (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-tocopherols), sterols (\u03b2-sitosterol prevail), and for the first time established phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine was the major compound). DNA protective activity of glyceride oil was proven for the first time by using a qualitative in vitro DNA nicking protection assay, as well as a lack of cytotoxicity. Unfortunately, there was not found any antiproliferative activity of the oil against PC3 and HT-29 human tumor cell lines. In brief, K. paniculata glyceride oil could be a source of health-promoting components or a natural preservative in various food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.A. and I.D.-D.; methodology, Z.P., O.T., G.A., S.N. and I.S.; software, E.A. and T.A.; formal analysis, Z.P., O.T., S.N., T.A., Y.M., I.S. and E.A.; data curation, T.A. and Z.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.A., I.D.-D., Y.M., Z.P., O.T., G.A., S.N. and E.A.; supervision, I.D.-D.
