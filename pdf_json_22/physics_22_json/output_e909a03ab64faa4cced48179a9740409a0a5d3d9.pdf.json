Solutions of the PN BBH systems with arbitrary parameters (masses, spins, eccentricity) are required for modeling the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by them. Accurate models of GWs are crucial for their detection by LIGO/Virgo and LISA. Only recently, two solution methods for solving the BBH dynamics were proposed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 100, 044046 (2019)] (without using action-angle variables), and Refs. [Phys. Rev. D 103, 064066 (2021), Phys. Rev. D 107, 103040 (2023)] (action-angle based). This paper combines the ideas laid out in the above articles, fills the missing gaps and compiles the two solutions which are fully 1.5PN accurate. We also present a public Mathematica package BBHpnToolkit which implements these two solutions and compares them with the result of numerical integration of the evolution equations. The level of agreement between these solutions provides a numerical verification for all the five action variables constructed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. D 103, 064066 (2021), Phys. Rev. D 107, 103040 (2023)]. This paper hence serves as a stepping stone for pushing the action-angle-based solution to 2PN order via canonical perturbation theory.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nConstruction of accurate gravitational wave (GW) templates (or models) has been crucial to the the GW detections that have taken place so far since 2015 [1\u20133]. This is so because the method of matched filtering for GW detection requires as one of the inputs, the theoretical templates of the GW signal to be detected. Post-Newtonian (PN) theory serves as a useful framework within which GWs from binary black holes (BBHs) are modeled when the system is in its initial and longest-lived inspiral stage [4]. At this stage, the two black holes (BHs) of the BBH are far apart and move slowly around a common center. This is also referred to as the PN regime. In the PN framework, quantities of interest are presented in a PN power series in the small PN paramter (ratio of the typical speed of the system and that of light). As is typical of power series, higher-order corrections are of smaller magnitudes and carry higher PN orders. Since GWs from a BBH are functions of the positions-momenta of the source, modeling the positions-momenta of the BBH system is crucial for constructing the GW templates. This paper deals with the construction of 1.5PN accurate closed-form solutions of the BBH system.\nSince we restrict ourselves to 1.5PN order, the dissipative effects on the BBH dynamics due to GW emission don\u2019t enter the picture; they show up at 2.5PN. The conservative dynamics of the system can be described with the PN Hamiltonian framework, wherein the system\n\u2217 sashwat.tanay@obspm.fr\npossesses a Hamiltonian that is a function of the system\u2019s canonical coordinates [5]. The leading PN order effect is simply that of two point masses moving under mutual Newtonian gravitational attraction whose Hamiltonian treatment is a textbook subject matter. Such systems, move on a closed ellipse if they are bound. The next level of sophistication is at 1PN order wherein 1PN effects are added to the above Newtonian system. At this level, spin effects are ignored (they enter at 1.5PN). Ref. [6] provided the quasi-Keplerian parametric solution for this system; the trajectory is no longer a closed ellipse and the system features the advance of periastron. The orbit still remains confined in a plane due to the constancy of the angular momentum vector.\nMoving further up the PN ladder, we encounter the 1.5PN system whose Hamiltonian was proposed in Ref. [7]. At 1.5PN order, spin effects come into play for the first time via a spin-orbit interaction (linear-in-spin), while the spin-spin interaction terms enter at 2PN. Via numerical integration of the resulting equations of motion (EOMs), it is seen that the orbital plane precesses; the orbital angular momentum is constant only in magnitude, but not in direction. This system displays the rich interplay of non-zero BH spins, periastron precession, along with spin and orbital-plane precession. We concern ourselves with this system in this paper.\nOver the past decades, solutions to the dynamics of the spinning BBH system (at 1.5PN order or higher) have been constructed by many groups [8\u201316], but most of them worked under some simplifying specialization like only one BH spinning, equal masses, small eccentricity, orbit-averaging, etc. Two recent breakthroughs have occurred on the front of finding solutions to the most general\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n01 60\n5v 3\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 5\nD ec\n2 02\n3\n2 1.5PN BBH system without any simplifying assumptions where the qualifier \u201cmost general\u201d indicates a system with arbitrary values of masses, spins, and eccentricity, while still falling under the PN regime1. The first breakthrough was made by Cho and Lee in Ref. [17] where they succeeded in integrating the EOMs of the system; the 1PN term in the Hamiltonian was ignored throughout for simplicity. The second breakthrough came in the form of Refs. [18, 19], where the authors evaluated all the action variables (actions as in action-angle (AA) variables) and laid out a scheme on how to construct the AA-based solution of the system2. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to target the following objectives\n1. Re-present the solution of Ref. [17] but with the 1PN terms included. We will call it the Standard Solution.\n2. Present a systematic procedure to construct the AAbased solution. As we will see later, the construction of the AA-based solution requires the Standard Solution as one of the inputs.\n3. Make available BBHpnToolkit, a public Mathematica package [21] which (1) implements the Standard Solution, the AA-based solution, and the numerical solution (2) gives the numerical values of all five frequencies (rate of increase of the angle variables) of a given BBH system, (3) computes the Poisson brackets (PBs) between any two functions of the phase-space variables.\nLet us mention that the AA-based solution provides a significant advantage over the Standard solution. This is so because while extending the Standard Solution to 2PN appears quite difficult, the AA-based solution should be extendable to 2PN via canonical perturbation theory. This paper assembles the ideas put forth in Refs. [18, 19, 22], and provides a solid platform from where one can springboard to push the 1.5PN solutions to 2PN order using canonical perturbation theory.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the phase space, the Hamiltonian, the EOMs of the system as well as the concept of AA variables. In Sec. III, we re-present the solution of Ref. [22] with the 1PN terms included (Standard Solution). In Sec. IV, we lay out an in a step-by-step fashion, the strategy to construct the alternative AA-based solution. In Sec. V, we introduce the Mathematica package BBHpnToolkit that we release with this paper. We also make comparisons of our analytical solutions with the numerical one, before summarizing in Sec. VI.\n1 In the PN approximation, the spin magnitude of a maximally spinning BH is 0.5PN order smaller than the BH\u2019s orbital angular momentum. 2 See Ref. [20] for a pedagogical introduction to the action-angle method of solution."

We also define the total mass M = m1 +m2, the reduced mass \u00b5 \u2261 m1m2/M , the symmetric mass ratio \u03bd \u2261 \u00b5/M , and \u03c31 \u2261 1 + 3m2/4m1 and \u03c32 \u2261 1 + 3m1/4m2, along with\nS\u20d7eff \u2261 \u03c31S\u20d71 + \u03c32S\u20d72. (1)\nAs usual, G and c denote the gravitational constant and the speed of light, respectively. Finally, note that we represent the physical time with t\u2032, whereas t \u2261 t\u2032/(GM) is reserved for the scaled time. Dots represent a derivative taken with respect to t. The norm of any 3D vector will be denoted by the same letter as the vector but without the arrow, i.e. V \u2261 |V\u20d7 |. The unit vector V\u20d7 /V corresponding to a vector V\u20d7 is denoted by the use of a hat V\u0302 \u2261 V\u20d7 /V .\nWe now present the 1.5PN Hamiltonian of the system using scaled variables r\u20d7 \u2261 R\u20d7/(GM), p\u20d7 \u2261 P\u20d7 /\u00b5,\nH = HN +H1PN +H1.5PN + O ( c\u22124 ) , (2)\nwhere the various PN components are\nHN =\u00b5 ( p2\n2 \u2212 1 r\n) , (3)\nH1PN = \u00b5\nc2 { 1 8(3\u03bd \u2212 1)p 4 + 12r2 (4)\n\u2212 12r [ (3 + \u03bd)p2 + \u03bd(r\u0302 \u00b7 p\u20d7)2 ]} , (5)\nH1.5PN = 2G c2R3 S\u20d7eff \u00b7 L\u20d7. (6)\nThe evolution of any function g is given by its Poisson bracket (PB) with H\ndg dt\u2032 = {g,H} . (7)\nA few basic rules are needed to evaluate the PB between any two functions of the phase space variables R\u20d7, P\u20d7 , S\u20d71 and S\u20d72, the first one being the PB between the phase space variables. The only non-vanishing PBs between the\n3 phase-space variables are given by{ Ri, Pj } = \u03b4ij , and { Sia, S j b } = \u03b4ab\u03f5ijk S k a , (8)\nand those related by the property of anti-symmetry of the PBs\n{f, g} = \u2212{g, f}. (9)\na, b have been used to label the BHs, whereas i, j, k label the components of the vectors. \u03f5ijk is the usual LeviCivita symbol in three dimensions. This is despite the appearance of lower index k, whose sole purpose is to implement Einstein summation. The second rule is the so-called chain rule (with vl\u2019s standing for the phase-space variables)\n{f, g (vl)} = {f, vl} \u2202g\n\u2202vl . (10)\nFinally, with the aid of Eqs. (8), (9), and (10), we can evaluate the PB between any two quantities. This also lets us evaluate the time derivative of any quantity via Eq. (7).\nTwo quantities f and g are said to commute or be in involution if {f, g} = 0. A system with Hamiltonian H in 2n canonical momenta-positions coordinates (P\u20d7, Q\u20d7) is said to be integrable if there exists a canonical transformation to new momenta-positions coordinates (J\u20d7 , \u03b8\u20d7) such that H is a function of only the J \u2019s, and that all the P\u20d7 and Q\u20d7 are 2\u03c0-periodic functions of the angle variables \u03b8\u20d7 [23]. An integrable system possesses n mutually commuting constants, including the Hamiltonian (Liouville-Arnold theorem). Another equivalent but practically more useful definition of actions is given via [23, 24]\nJk = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222e Ck \u0398 = 12\u03c0 \u222e Ck PidQi , (11)\nwhere Ck is any loop in the kth homotopy class on the n-torus defined by the constant values of the n commuting constants.\nBefore ending this section, we will touch upon the concept of flows under a function f of the phase-space variables and the associated vector fields. f(P\u20d7, Q\u20d7) defines a vector field as {\u00b7, f} = \u2202/\u2202\u03bb, and its action on another function g(P\u20d7, Q\u20d7) is \u2202g/\u2202\u03bb = {g, f} [25]. The integral\ncurves of the vector field is referred to as the flow of the field. With this, it is easy to see that the equation governing the real-time evolution of a Hamiltonian system dg/dt\u2032 = {g,H} is basically the flow equation under the Hamiltonian where the flow parameter \u03bb is to be taken as time t\u2032. The next two sections deal with two equivalent ways of constructing the solution of 1.5PN BBH system."

Here we include the 1PN terms too. Most of the derivation in Ref. [17] goes through, even after including the 1PN terms. So, we closely follow their approach and do not present the entire derivation. We provide derivation details only for those segments where the derivation presented in Ref. [17] has to be significantly modified due to the inclusion of the 1PN terms. Needless to say, we refer the reader to Ref. [17] for the derivation of many of the results that we present in this section. Ref. [17] also has some typos which we fix in this paper."

So, unlike previous sub-sections, we will present the derivation of the solution for \u03d5. Since the magnitude of R\u20d7 has already been worked out in the literature, we will simply state the relevant results without presenting the derivation.\nLet us first focus on the magnitude r of the scaled position vector r\u20d7 = R\u20d7/(GM). The 1PN and 2PN contributions (without spins) can be found in Ref. [6], whereas the 1.5PN contribution (with the 1PN effects ignored) can be found in Ref. [26].

(59) In the NIF, the various vector components are\nl\u20d7 =  00 l  n\n(60)\ns\u20d71 = s1  sin \u03ba1 cos \u03besin \u03ba1 sin \u03be cos\u03ba1  n\n(61)\ns\u20d72 = s2  sin \u03ba2 cos (\u03be + \u03c8)sin \u03ba2 sin (\u03be + \u03c8) cos\u03ba2  n\n(62)\nr\u20d7 =  r cos\u03d5r sin\u03d5 0  n\n(63)\nNote that with the aid of Eqs. (61) and (62), we have actually defined the angles \u03be and \u03c8, that is to say, \u03be and\n\u03be+\u03c8 are azimuthal angles of s\u20d71 and s\u20d72 in the NIF. Implicit in Eq. (63) is the definition that \u03d5 is the azimuthal angle of r\u20d7 in the NIF. Also, the subscript \u201cn\u201d after the above columns denotes that the components have been written in the NIF.\nBeing cognizant of the fact that the time derivative of a vector changes (as a geometrical object) with a change of the frame in which it is viewed (see Sec. 4.9 of Ref. [27]), we mention here that all time derivatives of vectors in this paper are to be viewed in the IF. With that, we now wish to express the components of dr\u20d7/dt in the NIF. We do so by first writing the r\u20d7-components in the IF (using Eq. (63) and the inverse of EL of Eq. (59)), taking derivatives of the components with respect to t, and then transforming the components of this time derivative to the NIF (using EL). The end result is\n\u02d9\u20d7r =  r\u0307 cos\u03d5\u2212 r sin\u03d5 (\u03d5\u0307L cos \u03b8L + \u03d5\u0307)r\u0307 sin\u03d5+ r cos\u03d5 (\u03d5\u0307L cos \u03b8L + \u03d5\u0307) r ( \u2212\u03d5\u0307L sin \u03b8L cos\u03d5+ \u03b8\u0307L sin\u03d5 ) \nn\n(64)\nNow we want to express l\u20d7 = r\u20d7\u00d7 p\u20d7 in component form in the NIF. The components of l\u20d7 and r\u20d7 in the NIF are already given by Eqs. (60) and (63). For p\u20d7, we start with Eq. (58), where we use Eqs. (61) and (62) for expressing s\u20d7eff , and Eq. (64) for dr\u20d7/dt. With all this, the third component of the relation l\u20d7 = r\u20d7 \u00d7 p\u20d7 when written out gives us (with \u03f5 \u2261 1/c2 and h \u2261 H/\u00b5)\nd\u03d5 dt = \u2212 2(\u03f5s1\u03b41 cos\u03ba1 + \u03f5s2\u03b42cos\u03ba2 + lr) r2 ( \u22122\u03f5(3 + \u03bd) + ( \u22122 + \u03f5(\u22121 + 3\u03bd) ( (p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302)2 + l2r2 )) r ) \u2212 cos\u03b8L d\u03d5L dt , (65)\nWe mention that to arrive at Eq. (65) we eliminated p2 in favor of p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302 (or p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u20d7) with the aid of\np2 = (p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302)2 + l 2\nr2 , (66)\nwhere p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302 is given by (see Eq. (36) of Ref. [18])\np\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302 = (( 2h\u2212 \u03f5(3\u03bd \u2212 1)h2 )\n+ 2(1 + \u03f5(4 \u2212 \u03bd)h) r\n+ ( \u2212l2 + \u03f5(6 + \u03bd) ) r2 + \u2212\u03f5\u03bd ( l2 + 2seff \u00b7 l/\u03bd ) r3 )1/2 . (67)\nWe want to rewrite Eq. (65) so that the only time-varying quantities on the RHS are cos\u03ba1 and r. Therefore, we need to eliminate p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302, d\u03d5L/dt, cos \u03b8L, and cos\u03ba2. To do so, we make use of Eqs. (32), (67) and the relations\nL\u20d7 \u00b7 J\u20d7 = JL cos \u03b8L = L\u20d7 \u00b7 (L\u20d7+ S\u20d71 + S\u20d72) = L2 + LS1 cos\u03ba1 + LS2 cos\u03ba2, (68) d\u03d5L dt = 1 c2r3 ( \u03b21 cos\u03ba1 + \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b22cos\u03ba1 + \u03b12 ) . (69)\n8 Eq. (69) has already been derived in Ref. [17], see its Eq. (3.27). Finally, Eq. (65) becomes\nd\u03d5 dt = \u03f5 r3\n( \u03b21\ncos\u03ba1 + \u03b11 + \u03b22cos\u03ba1 + \u03b12 ) \u2212 l\u03f52(\u22121 + 3\u03bd) ( 2seff \u00b7 l + l2\u03bd ) 2r5 + l\u03f52 ( \u22126 + 17\u03bd + 3\u03bd2 ) 2r4 + l ( 2 \u2212 h2\u03f52(1 \u2212 3\u03bd)2 + 2h\u03f5(\u22121 + 3\u03bd) ) 2r2\n\u2212 \u03f5 ( \u2212seff \u00b7 l + l2 ( 4 + 4h\u03f5\u2212 2\u03bd \u2212 13h\u03f5\u03bd + 3h\u03f5\u03bd2 + \u03b41 + \u03b42 ) + ls2\u03b42\u03a32 ) lr3 , (70)\n\u2261 \u03f5 r3\n( \u03b21\ncos\u03ba1 + \u03b11 + \u03b22cos\u03ba1 + \u03b12 ) + A5 r5 + A4 r4 + A3 r3 + A2 r2 . (71)\nwhich when integrated gives\n\u03d5\u2212 \u03d50 = 2\u221a\nA (x3 \u2212 x1)\n\u03b21\u03a0 ( x1\u2212x2 \u03b11+x1 , am(\u03a5, \u03b2), \u03b2 ) \u03b11 + x1 + \u03b22\u03a0 ( x1\u2212x2 \u03b12+x1 , am(\u03a5, \u03b2), \u03b2 ) \u03b12 + x1 +A5R5 +A4R4 +A3R3 +A2R2 (72)\nwhere \u03d50 is an integration constant to be determined by substituting t = 0 in the above equation. Note that Eq. (71) defines A2, A3, A4, and A5. Also, Rj is the indefinite integral of r\u2212j with respect to t. For brevity, we don\u2019t write out Rj \u2019s explicitly but they can be easily had from the Newtonian-accurate expressions\nr = a (1 \u2212 e cosu) , (73) l\u2032 \u2261 n (t\u2212 t0) = u\u2212 e sin u. (74)\nn and e are given in Eqs. (28) and (27), respectively. a is the Newtonian version of the RHS of Eq. (49). Note that we have kept more than necessary PN accuracy in Eq. (70) and by extension, Eq. (72) just for the purposes of illustration; any additive term containing \u03f5q with q \u2265 2 can be dropped.\nE. Solution for P\u20d7\nWe present the determination of P\u20d7 = \u00b5p\u20d7 in a step-bystep algorithmic fashion\n1. From Eqs. (66) and (67), determine p2 or p, which takes care of the magnitude of p\u20d7 . With this, we also have in our hands the value of p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302, which will be used in the next step. What now remains is to determine the azimuthal angle of p\u20d7 in the NIF.\n2. Next we compute the angle \u03d5offset, which is defined as\n\u03d5offset = arcsin L(t)\nr(t)p(t) if p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302 > 0,\n\u03d5offset = \u03c0 \u2212 arcsin L(t) r(t)p(t) if p\u20d7 \u00b7 r\u0302 < 0. (75)\n3. Now it is a simple matter to see that the azimuthal angle that p\u20d7 makes with the x-axis of the NIF is \u03d5 + \u03d5offset, where \u03d5 is the azimuthal angle of r\u20d7 in the NIF and \u03d5offset is the relative azimuthal angle between r\u20d7 and p\u20d7. This completes the specification of P\u20d7 ."

            "text": "We devote this section to explaining our construction of an alternate AA-based solution to the 1.5PN BBH system. We will present in a step-by-step algorithmic fashion.\n1. The phase space of the 1.5PN system is 10 dimensional (since spin magnitudes are constants) and has five mutually commuting constants, resulting in an integrable system. These constants are C\u20d7 = {J, Jz, L,H, Seff \u00b7 L}. We thus have five action variables J\u20d7 = {J1 = J,J2 = Jz,J3 = L,J4,J5}, which can be found in Refs. [18] and [19]; their notations and definitions are somewhat different from those in this paper6.\n2. Under the real-time evolution of the BBH system, the angles change as \u2206\u03b8i = \u03c9it\u2032, t\u2032 = tGM being the physical time; \u03c9i\u2019s are naturally called the frequencies of the system and are constants since they are functions of the action variables, which are themselves constants. Sec. VI-A of Ref. [19] shows how to compute the five frequencies. The process mainly consists of constructing the Jacobian matrix of the actions with respect to the commuting constants, inverting this Jacobian matrix, and\n6 J4 was obtained by using Damour and Sch\u00e4fer\u2019s PN extension of the Sommerfeld radial action complex contour integral [28], whereas J5 was obtained using the method of fictitious phase-space variables [19].\n9 the row corresponding to the Hamiltonian (one of the commuting constants) contains the five frequencies.\n3. Let all the phase space variables be collectively denoted by V\u20d7 = { R\u20d7, P\u20d7 , S\u20d71, S\u20d72 } with their initial values\nbeing V\u20d70 \u2261 V\u20d7 (t\u2032 = 0). Suppose that V\u20d70 represents the state of the system at t\u2032 = 0, and we want to obtain V\u20d7 (t\u2032) at any non-zero time t\u2032.\n4. At t\u2032 = 0, assign all the angle variables of the system to have the value equal to 0; \u03b8\u20d7(t\u2032 = 0) = 0\u20d7. Then at the final time t\u2032, the angles of the system would have become \u03b8\u20d7 = \u03c9\u20d7 \u00d7 t\u2032. The problem of finding the state of the system at t\u2032 now becomes that of increasing all the angle variables by \u03c9\u20d7 \u00d7 t\u2032.\n5. As shown in Sec VI-B of Ref. [19], the angle \u03b8i can be increased by a certain amount if we flow under the corresponding action Ji by the same amount. Therefore the problem becomes that of flowing under the actions Ji by amounts \u03c9it\u2032 (starting from the V\u20d70 configuration). The order of flows does not matter because just like all the members of C\u20d7, all the actions mutually commute among themselves too.\n6. Because the flow equation under the actions reads\ndV\u20d7 d\u03bb = { V\u20d7 ,Ji(C\u20d7) } = { V\u20d7 , Cj } \u2202Ji \u2202Cj , (76)\na flow under an action Ji by \u2206\u03bbi can be achieved by flowing under all the commuting constants Cj \u2019s by respective amounts (\u2202Ji/\u2202Cj)\u2206\u03bbi. Again, we can flow under the commuting constants Cj \u2019s in any order, since they all mutually commute. This finally breaks down our problem to that of flowing under all five Cj \u2019s by certain amounts, whose closed-form solution is discussed in Appendix A.\nNow it should be clear as to why one of the inputs to the AA-based solution is the Standard Solution that was presented in Sec. III. This is so because one of the commuting constants is the Hamiltonian itself and in Sec. III, we presented the solution of the flow under this commuting constant. This also happens to be the solution of the system since the system\u2019s evolution equations are same as the equations governing the flow under the Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, the AA-based solutions appears to have the advantage to be pushed to 2PN using canonical perturbation theory which is a perturbation technique designed around the action-angle framework [27]."

            "text": "With this article, we are releasing a public Mathematica package BBHpnToolkit, which accomplishes the following objectives [21].\n1. Implements the Standard Solution of Sec. III obtained by integrating the flow under the Hamiltonian.\n2. Implements the action-angle-based solution of Sec. IV.\n3. Provides the numerical solution of the system by numerically integrating the EOMs.\n4. Provides numerical values of all five frequencies of the system, wherein by frequency we refer to the rates of change of the five angles (as in action-angle variables) of the system.\nFor the reference of the future users of our Mathematica package, we mention herein that we have retained some unnecessary high PN terms in the coded expressions which implement the two analytical solutions in the package. The full account is given in Appendix B. We devote this section to investigating the PN accuracy of the two analytical solutions with respect to the one obtained by direct numerical integration of the EOMs. In this section, we will refer to both these two analytical solutions collectively as just \u201canalytical solutions\u201d, for these two analytical solutions agree with each much better than they do with the numerical one.\nWe first begin by displaying the plots of the analytical solutions along with the numerical one in Fig. 2. Plots corresponding to the two analytical solutions (Standard and AA-based solutions) cannot be distinguished visually. But they are collectively distinguishable from the numerical solution at late times. As displayed in the caption of this figure, the parameters taken for these plots do not correspond to astrophysically relevant systems. But this is not a cause of concern because our focus in this section is to explore the mathematical accuracy of our solutions which are valid for a wide set of parameters, and not just those which correspond to real astrophysical scenarios. Later in this section, we will see that it is actually helpful to study these solutions under non-physical scenarios (such as changing the value of \u03f5 \u2261 1/c2), to determine the PN accuracy of our solutions (via the method of linear fit between the error and the PN parameter).\nLet us now switch to a more technical task of determining the PN accuracy of our analytical solutions against the numerical one. We explain our comparison method with the aid of Fig. 3. Starting from t\u2032 = t0 = 0, we evolve the system numerically up to a certain time t\u2032 = t1, such that R\u20d7n (R\u20d7 obtained via numerical integration) differs by a small amount from R\u20d7a (R\u20d7 obtained from the analytical solution). By \u201csmall amount\u201d, we mean an opening angle (\u03b63 in Fig. 3) of \u223c 0.5\u25e6 to 1\u25e6 between R\u20d7a and R\u20d7n. The dashed circle in the figure denotes the plane perpendicular to L\u20d7n (L\u20d7 obtained via numerical integration at t\u2032 = t1). R\u20d7a\u2225 is the projection of R\u20d7a on this plane. The difference between R\u20d7n and R\u20d7a is greatly exaggerated in this figure for the purposes of illustration. Now, even if we ignore the numerical roundoff errors, we expect R\u20d7a \u0338= R\u20d7n because of the PN truncation errors that crept in while deriving the analytical solutions. For this section, we force the roundoff errors to be much smaller than the truncation errors by\n10\nFigure 1: Test\nkeeping sufficient numerical precision while constructing the numerical solution.\nNow, the R\u20d7a \u2212 R\u20d7n can be broken down into two components: an in-plane component R\u20d7a\u2225 \u2212 R\u20d7n, and an outof-plane component R\u20d7a \u2212 R\u20d7a\u2225. The in-plane difference is brought about by an in-plane (perpendicular to L\u20d7) dephasing which occurs due to the difference between the numerical and the analytical values of the mean motion n (a kind of frequency). The out-of-plane difference is brought about by the difference L\u20d7a \u2212 L\u20d7n, where L\u20d7a is the analytical L\u20d7.\nFor comparison purposes, it is convenient to think of the in-plane and out-of-plane differences as in-plane and out-\nof-plane dephasings happening due to a difference in some angular velocities d\u03c9\u2225, and d\u03c9\u22a5 in the two directions, with the former being essentially the difference between the analytical and numerical mean motions. As is suggested from Eq. (51), these frequencies are often expressible as a PN series. Hence, we schematically write the difference between the numerical and analytical frequencies as a PN series along the two directions as\nd\u03c9\u2225 = \u03bepd\u03c9\u2225p + \u03bep+1d\u03c9\u2225p+1 + O(\u03bep+2), (77) d\u03c9\u22a5 = \u03beqd\u03c9\u22a5q + \u03beq+1d\u03c9\u22a5q+1 + O(\u03beq+2), (78)\nwith \u03be standing for the PN parameter GM/(c2R). The above equations indicate that the differences in the fre-\n11\nquencies along the two directions occurs at PN orders p and q. Note that unlike earlier sections, p does not stand for the magnitude of the scaled momentum, but is rather a PN power-counting index. It then follows that\n|R\u20d7a\u2225 \u2212 R\u20d7n| = \u03bepRnd\u03c9\u2225pt1, (79) |R\u20d7a\u2225 \u2212 R\u20d7a| = \u03beqRnd\u03c9\u22a5qt1, (80)\nwhere the LHS is the small arc length which subtends an angle \u03bepd\u03c9\u2225pt1 or \u03bepd\u03c9\u22a5pt1 a distance Rn away. Adding the vectors R\u20d7n\u2212R\u20d7a\u2225 and R\u20d7a\u2225\u2212R\u20d7a and taking the modulus of the sum, with the aid of the above two equations gives us at leading order\n|R\u20d7n \u2212 R\u20d7a| = \u03bert1Rnd\u03c9\u2225r if p \u0338= q (81) = \u03bert1Rn ( d\u03c92\u2225p + d\u03c92\u22a5p )1/2 if p = q, (82)\nwhere r = min(p, q)7, which is not to be confused with r \u2261 |r\u20d7|. This finally leads to\nlog (\n|R\u20d7n \u2212 R\u20d7a| t1Rn\n) = r log \u03be + constant. (83)\nIn Eq. (82), use has been made of Pythagoras theorem since R\u20d7n \u2212R\u20d7a\u2225 is perpendicular to R\u20d7a\u2225 \u2212R\u20d7a, and R\u20d7n \u2212R\u20d7a forms the hypotenuse.\nEq. (83) is the key to testing the PN accuracy of our analytical solutions against the numerical one. It says that a linear fit between the two logarithms has a slope equal to the integer r. From Eqs. (77) and (78), we know that r is also the PN order at which our analytical solution starts to diverge from the numerical one, if one focuses their attention on the frequencies associated with the dephashings. In our numerical experiments with a handful of cases, we find r = 2 \u00b1 2.5%, which indicates that the analytical solutions (both kinds) deviate from the numerical one at 2PN order, as far as the combined (in-plane and out-of-plane) dephasing effect goes. To perform the linear fit associated with Eq. (83), we needed the values of the PN parameter \u03be. We simply used \u03be = GM/(c2 \u27e8R\u27e9), where \u27e8R\u27e9 is the numerical orbit-averaged value of R.\nAnother way to compare the analytical solutions with the numerical one is to compare the timescale TN of variation of the Newtonian orbit against timescale TD at which R\u20d7n \u2212 R\u20d7a varies. Assuming a relation of the form\nTN = \u03berTD, (84)\nour objective is to determine r. The above equation gives\nlog TD = \u2212r log \u03be + log TN , (85)\n7 Here min(p, q) \u2261 p if p < q, and min(p, q) \u2261 p if p = q.\nA linear fit between log TD and log \u03be gives us a slope of \u2212r. For the purposes of linear-fitting, we can approximate TD as\nTD = 2\u03c0t1\narccos R\u0302n \u00b7 R\u0302a , (86)\nand \u03be is to be approximated the same way as before. This linear fit again gave us r = 2 \u00b1 2.5%, which means that the analytical and the numerical solutions differ at 2PN order. We finally mention that the verification of the solutions presented here also serves as a verification for the five action variables constructed in Refs. [18, 19].\nThere is a subtle aspect of the above procedure of determining the PN accuracy of the analytical solutions, which needs further elaboration. A question arises: how to vary the PN parameter \u03be \u2261 GM/(c2R) to prepare the data for linear-fitting as per Eqs. (83) and (85)? We put forth two options: (1) Vary the average value of R (physically sensible) (2) Vary \u03f5 = 1/c2 (unphysical). We will argue below that the latter option, though unphysical, is the mathematically sound option and the former is not.\nThe multiplicative factors attached to powers of \u03be in Eqs. (77) and (78) are assumed to depend on quantities like energy, mass ratio etc. This comes from our previous experience of the PN literature; for example see the expression of the mean motion in Eq. (51) or Eq. (28- b) of Ref. [29]. So this means that care must be taken while selecting the sample BBH systems for performing the above linear fits so that all the systems which are supposed to fall on a straight line have almost the same energy and mass ratio. One way to achieve this is to vary c, while keeping other parameters like m1,m2 and average R almost constant. Doing so does vary \u03be. Another way to vary \u03be would be to vary the masses or the average R. Doing so would also change the energy and the mass-ratio in general, which is something we want to avoid. The unphysical aspect of varying the speed of light is of no concern to us as far as checking the PN accuracy of the analytical solutions is concerned. This is so because our solutions to the BBH system are valid for any arbitrary positive speeds of light, provided \u03be \u226a 1.\nAt this point, we would like to mention that if the above procedure of linear fitting to determine the PN accuracy of our solutions (embodied in Eq. (83)) is applied to the spin vectors, we get r \u223c 1.5, rather than 2. However, this is no cause for alarm. The evolution equation for the spins due to only the 1.5PN part of the Hamiltonian is (A = 1, 2)\ndS\u20d7A dt\u2032\n= { S\u20d7A, H1.5PN } = 2G\u03c3A\nc2R3 L\u20d7\u00d7 S\u20d7A (87)\n\u2261 \u2126\u20d7A \u00d7 S\u20d7A, (88)\nfrom which we can conclude that the angular velocity imparted to the spins due to the 1.5PN part of the Hamiltonian scales as \u2126\u20d7A \u223c 1/c2. The same is not true for R\u20d7 since the corresponding angular velocity due to H1.5PN\n12\n(contribution to the mean motion n due to H1.5PN in Eq. (51)) scales as \u223c 1/c3. It is due to this difference in the nature of evolution of R\u20d7 and S\u20d7A that we should expect to obtain r \u223c 2 for the former and r \u223c 1.5 for the latter when the procedure surrounding Eq. (83) is applied to the two vectors. Recall that by definition, r tells us how does the angular velocity of the error vector (R\u20d7a \u2212 R\u20d7n or S\u20d7Aa \u2212 S\u20d7An, with the subscripts \u201ca\u201d and \u201cn\u201d denoting the analytical and the numerical solutions, respectively) scales with 1/c. Our findings did match the above expectations for R\u20d7 and the spin vectors. We did not work with P\u20d7 when it came to applying this linear-fitting procedure."

            "text": "With this paper, we conclude the old problem of solving the dynamics of the 1.5PN BBH system, whose Hamiltonian was introduced in Ref. [7]. This is done for arbitrary masses, spins and eccentricity, and without any averaging. First we re-presented the solution of Ref. [22] but for completeness, unlike Ref. [22], we included the 1PN effects too. Then we show how to construct the alternative AAbased solution in an algorithmic style. The construction of the latter solution requires former solution as one of the inputs. But the AA-based solution is superior in the sense that it can be extended to 2PN order via canonical perturbation theory, with relative ease. We finally introduce BBHpnToolkit, a Mathematica package which implements our solutions for practical use. We finally make comparison of the two analytical solutions against the numerical one employing linear regression, and the analytical solutions indeed appear to be 1.5PN accurate.\nThe theoretical ideas that form the foundations of the two analytical solutions have been presented in Refs. [18, 19, 22]. Here we have assembled them, filled in the gaps (missing 1PN effects in Ref. [22]), implemented the solutions in a public Mathematica package, thereby establishing a platform (both in theoretical and practical-implementation sense) from where we can aim to push these solutions to 2PN. Moreover, the agreement between the numerical and AA-based solution serves as a non-trivial check of all the five actions constructed in Refs. [18, 19].\nThe next natural line of action would be to extend our AA-based solution to 2PN order using canonical perturbation theory. On a parallel track, one can try to construct GWs for these systems now that their dynamics have been solved. Adding the 2.5PN dissipative effects due to radiation reaction to our analytic solution will also be an interesting endeavor for the future."

These four equations seem to determine only R\u20d7, L\u20d7, and S\u20d71, and not S\u20d72 and P\u20d7 . But once we have R\u20d7, L\u20d7, and S\u20d71, determining S\u20d72 and P\u20d7 is quite easy. The former is found via S\u20d72 = J\u20d7 \u2212 L\u20d7\u2212 S\u20d72, and the latter is determined by making the following observations (i) P is a constant under the Seff \u00b7L flow. So all we need to care about is the orientation of P\u20d7 , which is dealt with in the next two bullet points. (ii) L\u20d7 = R\u20d7\u00d7 P\u20d7 ; hence L\u20d7 is perpendicular to R\u20d7 and P\u20d7 . (iii) under the Seff \u00b7L flow, the azimuthal angle of P\u20d7 (around L\u20d7) changes by the same amount as that of R\u20d7. Bullets (ii) and (iii) let us determine the orientation of P\u20d7 using the orientation of R\u20d7. Note that the definitions and conventions of Ref. [19] don\u2019t totally align with those followed in this paper; so care has to be taken when merging the results of the two papers."

However doing so may bring the analytical solutions closer to the numerical\nsolution (obtained by numerically integrating the 1.5PN EOMs)\n\u2022 As mentioned already at the end of Sec.

(70) are unnecessary.\n\u2022 The derivation of the solution Eqs. (12)-(30) of the mutual angles between the angular momenta for a flow under the Hamiltonian depends on the integration \u222b dt/r3; see Eq. (3.6) of Ref. [17]. Here\nNewtonian r is enough for the desired level of accuracy, and Eqs. (12)-(30) have been derived using Newtonian r in \u222b dt/r3. But in our BBHpnToolkit, we have coded the results obtained by integrating 1.5PN accurate 1/r3. Eqs. (48) give the 1.5PNaccurate r.\n[1] B. Abbott et al.
