We identify the member stars of these clusters from the precise astrometric and deep photometric data from Gaia Early Data Release 3 using the robust membership determination algorithm, ML-MOC. We identify 46 open clusters having a stellar corona beyond the tidal radius, 20 of which exhibit extended tails aligned with the cluster orbit direction in galactocentric coordinates. Notably we find NGC 6940 (at a distance of \u223c 1 kpc) is the furthest open cluster exhibiting tidal tails that are \u223c 50 pc from its center, while also identifying \u223c 40 pc long tidal tails for the nearby Pleiades. Using the minimum spanning tree length for the most massive stars relative to all cluster members, we obtain the mass segregation ratio (\u03bbMSR) profiles as a function of the number of massive stars in each cluster. From these profiles, we can classify the open clusters into four classes based on the degree of mass segregation experienced by the clusters. We find that clusters in the most mass segregated classes are the oldest on average and have the flattest mass function slope. Of the 46 open clusters studied in this work, 41 exhibit some degree of mass segregation. Furthermore, we estimate the initial masses (Mi) of these open clusters finding that some of them, having Mi & 104M , could be the dissolving remnants of Young Massive Clusters.",

            "text": "All stars likely form in clusters, which over time disintegrate to make up the field population of the Galaxy (Portegies Zwart et al. 2010). Two-body relaxation over time leads to more-massive stars sinking to the central regions of the cluster while less-massive stars occupy a larger volume and gradually evaporate. Additionally, the Galactic potential perturbs clusters to form tidal tails, an effect observed for both open (e.g. Berkeley 17 - Chen et al. 2004; Bhattacharya et al. 2017b; NGC 6791 - Dalessandro et al. 2015) and globular clusters (e.g. Palomar 5 - Odenkirchen et al. 2001; NGC 5466 - Belokurov et al. 2006). Identification of such tidal features in open clusters, which are more abundant in the Galactic disc, has long been challenging from photometric observations alone, despite the use of novel techniques (e.g. Bhattacharya et al. 2017a). This is because low-density features such as tidal tails are difficult to identify against the strong field contamination in the Galactic disc. Reliable astrometry (proper motion and parallax) fromGaiaData Release 2 (GaiaDR2; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and recentlyGaiaEarly Data Release 3 (GaiaEDR3; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) has allowed for improved field-star decontamination of many nearby open clusters, resulting in the recent discovery of a many open clusters with extended stellar coronae (e.g. Carrera et al. 2019; Meingast et al. 2021; Tarricq et al. 2022), as well as 13 of those with tidal tails \u2013 Hyades: R\u00f6ser et al.

(2022) recently carried out a systematic search for tidal tails in open clusters by identifying elongated features in the 2D projected spatial distribution of cluster members identified from Gaia EDR3 data. While they identified elongated features in 72 open clusters, terming them as tidal tails, they did not check the alignment of these extended features with the cluster orbit direction.\nIn this work, we utilise the 2D shape morphology computed by Hu et al. (2021) to systematically search for tidal features in a sample of open clusters showing elongated morphology. The cluster selection and membership determination using Gaia EDR3 is presented in Section 2. As in Bhattacharya et al. (2021a) for NGC 752, we adopt the following criteria for the 2D projected extended spatial features of any cluster to be tidal tails: in tri-dimensional projections in the galactocentric coordinate system, the cluster members constituting the leading (trailing) tails, identified in the 2D projected spatial distribution, should point towards (away from) a direction intermittent between the direction of the cluster orbit and the Galactic Center (GC) in at least two of the three planes. The methodology for reliably determining tidal features is presented in Section 3. We discuss the results, including a discussion on the mass segregation of the clusters, in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n08 25\n9v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n6 O\nct 2\n02 2"

(2021) obtained shape parameters for 265 open clusters, particularly including ecore (core ellipticity) and eall (all member ellipticity). We posit that the open clusters showing the most elongated morphology (evidenced from their ecore and eall) are more likely to harbour tidal tails which may be identified with improved membership determination using the more accurate Gaia EDR3 data. We note that only 7 of the 13 known open clusters with tidal tails are present in the catalogue of Hu et al. (2021), namely Praesepe, M 67, Alpha Persei, NGC 2516, NGC 6633, NGC 752 and Pleiades. In order to shortlist clusters with possible tidal tails, we carried out the following steps:\n(i) We first selected a third of the open clusters having the highest eall values, since these are the most elongated ones. This corresponded to open clusters having eall > 0.19. Given the cluster outskirts may not have been adequately covered by the members identified using Gaia DR2, any cluster showing elongated core morphology (top 20%) were further selected, corresponding to ecore > 0.28. Figure 1 [top] shows the distribution of eall values against the ecore values determined by Hu et al. (2021) for 265 open clusters. The 106 clusters satisfying the aforementioned criteria are marked in blue, while the others are in grey. (ii) For each of these 106 clusters, we determined the maximum ellipticity, eall,max, as the upper limit of eall. The bottom 10% of clusters which had least eall,max values, making them unlikely to be elongated in the outskirts, were discarded. We were thus left with 95 cluster candidates which may be searched for possible tidal tails. Figure 1 [bottom] shows the distribution of eall,max values against the ecore for these 95 clusters shown in yellow, while those in blue were discarded. (iii) Of the 95 clusters, only three with already known tidal tails\nsurvive the selection (Alpha Persei, NGC 752 and the Pleiades). The Pleiades has only short tidal tails discovered (Ye et al. 2021) with possibility of longer tails being uncovered. Alpha Persei\u2019s tidal tails were only identified by Nikiforova et al. (2020) as photometric overdensities against the forground and background sources, and the tail members were not identified from kinematic measurements. We thus continue to include Alpha Persei and the Pleiades in our study. NGC 752 already has long tails discovered and studied in depth in Bhattacharya et al. (2021a). It is marked in red in Figure 1 [bottom] and has been excluded from this study. The other 94 clusters were chosen for membership determination and a search for tidal tails was carried out in some of them (see Section 3)."

            "text": "For each of the 94 clusters, we obtainGaia EDR3 positions, trigonometric parallaxes (\ud835\udf14), proper motions (PM), radial velocity (RV) as well as photometry in three broad-band filters (G, BP, and RP) within a search radius of twice the entire cluster half-length around its center as noted by Hu et al. (2021). Then quality cuts are applied as mentioned in Agarwal et al. (2021, see their Section 3.1). This sample is termed All sources for each cluster. We useML-MOC (Agarwal et al. 2021) to identify members for each cluster using the proper motion and parallax information. ML-MOC is based on the k-nearest neighbour algorithm (kNN; Cover & Hart 1967) and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM;Mclachlan& Peel 2000). It identifies cluster members in the PM\u2013\ud835\udf14 parameter space, independent of the spatial density of the cluster. This allows for the identification of faint extended spatial structures, as already demonstrated for NGC 752 (Bhattacharya et al. 2021a). Note the completeness ofGaia EDR3 data and the contamination fraction for ML-MOC identified open cluster members are discussed in Appendix A. Briefly, the Gaia EDR3 data for open clusters is more than 90% complete down to G \u223c19.5 mag with a contamination \u223c 2.3%. Details of the membership selection are described in Agarwal et al. (2021) and we briefly describe it as follows, taking the cluster Teutsch 35 as an example:\n(i) In the first step of the membership selection, kNN is utilised to remove the obvious field stars such that the remaining member candidates have more cluster members than field stars. This is done by applying kNN (with 25 nearest neighbours) to those stars within the central region of the cluster (within a radius equal to the cluster core half-length noted by Hu et al. 2021) to calculate a broad range of PM and \ud835\udf14 values for the cluster members. For Teutsch 35, we find the range of PM in RA, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udefccos(\ud835\udeff) = \u22121.546 \u2013 0.549 mas/yr, PM in DEC, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff = \u22123.543 \u2013 \u22121.453 mas/yr, and \ud835\udf14 = 1.401 \u2013 2.983. The stars inAll sourceswhich fall in the aforementioned parameter ranges are termed Sample sources. Their spatial, PM and\ud835\udf14 distributions are shown in Figure 2. (ii) For the second step, a three dimensional GMM is used in the PM\u2013\ud835\udf14 parameter space of the Sample sources to distinguish between the cluster and field members, also assigning a membership probability (pmemb). Those sources having pmemb \u2265 0.6 are considered as high probability members. (iii) A small number of stars having 0.2 \u2264 pmemb \u2264 0.6 are also considered as members if their \ud835\udf14 values lie within the range of \ud835\udf14 values specified by the members that have pmemb \u2265 0.8. This results in the identification of 172 members (Nmemb) in Teutsch 35 whose spatial, PM and \ud835\udf14 distributions are also shown in Figure 2. Note the extended tails are clearly visible in the spatial distribution.\nAmong the 94 clusters whose membership determination was attempted, ML-MOC failed to securely identify cluster members in 20\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nof them for the large search radius required to find extended structures. This was because the Sample sources of these clusters had overlapping cluster members and field stars in the PM\u2013\ud835\udf14 parameter space, not allowing for two distinguishable gaussian fits (see Agarwal et al. 2021, for details of such cases).WhileML-MOCmay have been more successful in identifying members in a smaller search radius, such a search was not attempted as we are interested primarily in extended features in the cluster outskirts. A further 17 clusters had very few members determined (also in the Gaia DR2 membership determination by Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018) and were discarded as it would not have been possible to securely identify extended features in clusters with such low member density. Finally, 11 more clusters did not have members identified beyond their tidal radius (fitted in Section 3.2) and were also excluded from further study. The remaining 46 clusters with extended features have been studied here and\nsearched for tidal tails. These also include 33 open clusters studied by Tarricq et al. (2022), 10 of which were identified as having extended features from their 2D spatial distribution but the tidal nature of their tails is yet to be determined.\nThe 46 open clusters studied in this work are highlighted in black in Figure 1 [bottom]. Their identifiedmembers and colour magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in Gaia filters are presented in Appendix B. Their cluster parameters are tabulated in Table 1, including the cluster age, extinction, distance and metallicity taken from Bossini et al. (2019) and the ellipticities from Hu et al. (2021). We also note that the fractional uncertainty in parallax for our cluster members varies with distance with typical values of 0.008, 0.021, 0.066 & 0.055 for IC 2602, NGC 6475, NGC 6940 & Gulliver 44 respectively which are at respective distances of 152.34 pc, 279.77 pc, 1041.36 pc & 1258.92 pc.

            "text": "While extended tails are clearly visible in the spatial distribution of Teutsch 35 (Figure 2 [right]), we need to estimate the tidal radius (rt) of the cluster in order to ascertain the extra-tidal nature of these tails. Estimating the tidal radius from fitting the King function (King 1966) to the radial density of the cluster is not appropriate for a dissolving cluster with extended structures as such a fit would overestimate rt (See Appendix C). It is because the King model is appropriate only for a system in equilibrium, inappropriate for extended systems such as open clusters with tidal tails, though still appropriate within rt for older open clusters in equilibrium (Elson et al. 1987). Thus, rt may be calculated from the enclosed mass within rt ignoring the mass contribution from beyond (Meingast et al. 2021). We thus calculate rt following Pinfield et al. (1998) as:\nr3t = GMenc 2(A\u2212B)2 (1)\n1 http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, A and B are the Oort constants (A = 15.3 \u00b1 0.4 km/s/kpc, B = \u221211.9 \u00b1 0.4 km/s/kpc; Bovy 2017). Following Meingast et al. (2021), we obtain rt by comparing the radial fractional mass distribution of the cluster members (black solid line in Figure 5) to that of the rt corresponding to the enclosed mass (red dotted line in Figure 5). Where the two curves meet in Figure 5 is the rt of the cluster. Note that we have assumed the observed photometric mass to be the enclosed mass but an error of \u223c3% would need to be added to account for unobserved stars2. Including the error on the Oort constants, the uncertainty on rt would\n2 We saw in Bhattacharya et al.

We calculate rt = 0.7807\u25e6 = 6.54 pc at the distance of Teutsch 35. The identified members within and beyond rt in the 2D spatial projection are classified as intra-tidal and extra-tidal members respectively (Figure 6). The extra-tidal members go out to 33.17 pc at the distance of the cluster. The extended features beyond the tidal radius are clearly visible in Figure 6 but to check their alignment with respect to the cluster orbit, we explore their positions in galactocentric coordinates."

            "text": "Similar to Tang et al. (2019) for Coma Berenices and Bhattacharya et al. (2021a) for NGC 752, we explore the position of cluster members of Teutsch 35 with respect to the cluster orbit in a galactocentric coordinate system. These coordinates have a positive x direction pointing from the position of the Sun towards the GC; the y-axis points toward l = 90\u25e6 and the z-axis roughly points toward b = 90\u25e6. We take the distance of the Sun to the GC as 8.3 kpc, and solar motion parameters as U = 12.9 km s\u22121, V = 245.6 km s\u22121 and W = 7.78 km s\u22121. (Reid & Brunthaler 2004). A known effect of distance estimation fromparallaxmeasurements (required for conversion to the galactocentric coordinate system) is that the morphology of star clusters appears to be stretched along the line of sight when distances are obtained by simple parallax inversion (E.g. Pang et al. 2021). This effect becomes more prominent with increasing cluster distance. To mitigate this issue, we use the photogeometric distances to our cluster members for Gaia EDR3 as found by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). They estimate stellar distances following a probabilistic approach using a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of the Galaxy, taking into account interstellar extinction, the Gaia variable magnitude limit, and the color and apparent magnitude of each star. Figure 7 shows the X-Y (left), Y-Z (middle) and X-Z (right) projections of the cluster members. We compute the average position of all member stars as the cluster mean position and its mean space velocity for only those sources having RV measurements (see Table 2). These values are utilised to calculate the cluster orbit using the python package galpy (Bovy 2015) which accounts for solar motion and includes the Milky Way potential model MWPotential2014 (a fitted Galactic potential model incorporating the bulge, disc and halo). Orbits are integrated 20 Myr forward in time. Figure 7 shows the orbit direction (red solid line) of Teutsch 35 in the three galactocentric projections. Also shown are the line-of-\nsight direction (grey dotted line) and the direction towards the GC (black dashed line). Clearly the cluster still appears extended along the line-of-sight, including the extra-tidal members, most prominent in the X-Y plane in Figure 7. Despite the extension along the lineof-sight, the extra-tidal members encircled in yellow in Figure 7 point towards the GC in the X-Y plane and intermediate between the direction of the cluster orbit and the GC in the X-Z plane. These form the leading tail of Teutsch 35 while those encircled in green point in the opposite direction and form its trailing tail. As the cluster orbit direction is nearly opposite to that of the GC in the Y-Z plane, the tidal tail members do not occupy distinct areas in this plane. Thus, we find that Teutsch 35 is a dissolving open cluster exhibiting tidal features. Figure 6 shows the distinct sub-regions of Teutsch 35, its intra- and extra-tidal regions as well as the leading and trailing tails. The leading and trailing tails extend to 28.11 pc and 30.31 pc respectively at the distance of the cluster. We note that to confirm if these tails are indeed tidally formed, their kinematic dissipation along the cluster orbit needs to be checked. Such a check is only possible when many of the tail members have 6D astrometric information such as the nearby Coma Berenices studied by Tang et al. (2019) but not possible for Teutsch 35 or most of the other clusters studied in this work."

For Teutsch 35, this corresponds to G = 17.5 mag, much brighter than the 90% completeness limit (see Appendix A). The mass function of all the identified members of the cluster is shown in Figure 8 [top]. Using the relation log(dN/dM) = \u2212 (1 + \ud835\udf12) \u00d7 log(M) + constant, where dN represents the number of stars in amass bin dMwith central mass M, we obtain the slope of the mass function for Teutsch 35, \ud835\udf12 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.38.

The Pleiades has the largest physical coronal radius (RC = 58.78 pc) while Alessi Teutsch 3 has the smallest (RC = 9.88 pc). From the spatial distribution of cluster members, extended features beyond the tidal radius are visually identified in each cluster and tentatively marked as tidal tail candidates. As in Section 3.3 for Teutsch 35, we check the alignment of the cluster members with the cluster orbits in galactocentric coordinates. 19 clusters (see Figure D1) meet the tidal tail criteria. The alignment of their tails with the cluster orbit is clear despite the line-of-sight elongation for most of these clusters. Note that we are not sensitive to the presence of tidal tails along the line-of-sight given this apparent elongation. These 19 clusters, in addition to Teutsch 35, have thus been identified to have extended tidal tails and their spatial positions are shown in Figure 9. The members of these clusters not belonging to either of the tails but present beyond the tidal radius form part of the cluster corona. Table 2 notes their mean galactocentric positions and space velocities as well as the physical extent of their tidal tails. NGC 6940 has the largest physical tidal tail length (Llead = 49.17 pc; Llag = 41.7 pc) while ASCC 101 has the smallest (Llead = 11.09 pc; Llag = 9.15 pc). The majority of the other 26 open clusters only have a corona of extra-tidal members, without any clear tidal extension. Some of these have seemingly extended features observed spatially (namely, Alessi 62, ASCC 41, Gulliver 36, Gulliver 44, NGC 1528, NGC 2448 and Ruprecht 161) but these features do not align securely with the cluster orbit or GC direction and are thus not classified as having tidal tails.

However, it is already known that tail members identified at larger distances from the center of any cluster would necessarily span separate regions in the proper motion and parallax parameter spaces depending on the cluster properties (E.g. Jerabkova et al. 2021). So tail members beyond a certain radius would not be identified by ML-MOC and this limit would be distinct for each cluster depending on its age, distance and other properties. Boffin et al. (2022) explored the distribution of a synthetic cluster model akin to NGC 752. They find that ML-MOC identifies only those tail members in NGC 752 (Bhattacharya et al. 2021a) that are very close to the cluster core, though those identified are consistent with the modelled tail region. Membership determination algorithms constrained by tailored synthetic models made for NGC 752 are required to identify the full extent of its tidal tails (Boffin et al. 2022). Such synthetic models are beyond the scope of this paper and our goal is to reliably identify clusters with tidal tails using MLMOC, knowing that the length of tidal tails found in this work are a lower limit on the actual cluster tidal tail length. We discuss our results keeping this in mind."

Given the range of distances and extinctions for the clusters studied in this work, the mass of 0.5 M corresponds to a wide range of G-band magnitudes. We, however, limit ourselves to fitting themass function to stars brighter thanG=18.5mag (where the cluster membership contamination and completeness are secure; see Appendix A) for the clusters where 0.5 M corresponds to fainter G-band magnitudes. The fitted mass function slopes for the entire cluster, \ud835\udf12all, for the intra-tidal members, \ud835\udf12intra and for the extra-tidal members, \ud835\udf12extra have been noted in Table 3. Figure 11 [top] shows \ud835\udf12intra against \ud835\udf12all for all the clusters, separately for the clusters with tidal tails (black) and those only with a corona (grey). The two quantities follow the 1:1 line within error with few exceptions, having no clear difference between the clusters with tidal tails and those with only a corona. This tight correlation also implies that the fitted mass function within the tidal radius is a good approximation for the mass function of the entire cluster. This result confirms that the estimated mass function using cluster members within the inner regions of open clusters (generally close to or within its tidal radius) as carried out in earlier studies (E.g. Bhattacharya\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\net al. 2017a,b) prior to Gaia DR2 is still a valid approximation for the entire cluster. For the clusters studied here, both \ud835\udf12intra and \ud835\udf12all values are flatter than the Salpeter slope including uncertainties (see Table 3).\nFigure 11 [bottom] shows \ud835\udf12extra against \ud835\udf12intra for all the clusters,\nseparately for the clusters with tidal tails (black) and those only with a corona (grey). The two quantities either follow the 1:1 line within error or \ud835\udf12extra is steeper than \ud835\udf12intra. This implies that open clusters have the same mass function slope in the outskirts as the inner regions (where \ud835\udf12extra \u2248 \ud835\udf12intra) or they have a steeper slope in\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nthe outskirts (where \ud835\udf12extra > \ud835\udf12intra). The effect is independent of whether the cluster has identified tidal tails or just a corona. This implies that though inner regions of the cluster may be experiencing mass segregation, with mass function slopes flatter than the Salpeter value, the effect may not be as prominent beyond the tidal radius, where themass function slopes can be relatively steeper (see Table 3). We also calculate the mass function for the tidal tails where possible as noted in Table 3. The tidal tails generally have very few stars with the mass function slopes fitted having large uncertainty, though they typically have mass function slopes more positive than \ud835\udf12intra. We reiterate that since ML-MOC would not be able to identify tail\nmembers out to large distances (Boffin et al. 2022), the fitted mass function of the tail members is highly uncertain."

            "text": "While the deviation of themass function slope from theSalpeter value is an indicator of mass segregation, the degree of mass segregation can be quantified in open clusters following the prescription by Allison et al. (2009) which utilizes minimum spanning trees (MSTs3).\n3 An MST of a set of points is the path connecting all the points, with the shortest possible path length and without any closed loops.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nThe method calculates the mass segregation ratio (\ud835\udf06MSR) of a cluster by comparing the length of the MST (lmassive) of the most massive members (numbering Nmassive) with the length of theMST of a set of the same number of randomly chosen member stars (lrandom). \ud835\udf06MSR is thus described by the following equation:\n\ud835\udf06MSR (Nmassive) = <lrandom>lmassive \u00b1 \ud835\udf0e (lrandom) lmassive (2)\nwhere < lrandom > and \ud835\udf0e(lrandom) refer to the mean and standard deviation of lrandom calculated in N random samples of cluster members. In this work, we sample Nmassive random cluster members N = 100 times. Only those cluster members brighter than G = 18.5 mag are sampled in order to avoid completeness issues (see Appendix A for details). The \ud835\udf06MSR value thus calculated varies with the chosen Nmassive value. If a cluster is mass segregated, its \ud835\udf06MSR value would be greater than 1, with the value increasing with higher degrees of mass segregation. If more cluster members feel the effect of mass segregation, then \ud835\udf06MSR value would remain greater than 1 for higher Nmassive values. We calculate the \ud835\udf06MSR values for each of the 46 clusters studied in this work limiting the Nmassive value to the number of cluster members brighter than G = 14 mag (this generally covers 3\u20134 mag below the brightest most massive member even in the most distant clusters in our sample) up to a maximum Nmassive = 100. We find that the \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profiles of the open clusters can be visually\nclassified into four general classes (noted in Table 3). An example of a cluster for each of these classes is shown in Figure 12 and we describe each class as follows:\n\u2022 Class 1: The \ud835\udf06MSR value is low (generally below 1) for small Nmassive values but increases with increasing Nmassive values remaining above 1 (including the 1 \ud835\udf0e uncertainty) till the maximum measured Nmassive value. NGC 6475 is such a cluster whose \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profile is shown in Figure 12. There are 6 clusters in our sample which show such profiles, 3 of which have tidal tails. The mass segregation effect seems to be felt for the largest number of cluster members.\n\u2022 Class 2: The \ud835\udf06MSR value is close to its highest value for small Nmassive values but then decreases with increasing Nmassive values. However, the \ud835\udf06MSR value eventually plateaus to a value above 1 (including the 1 \ud835\udf0e uncertainty) till the maximum measured Nmassive value. NGC 6940 is such a cluster whose \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profile is shown in Figure 12. There are 16 clusters in our sample which show such profiles, 5 of which have tidal tails. As for Class 1 clusters, the mass segregation effect seems to be felt for a large number of cluster members.\n\u2022 Class 3: As for Class 2 clusters, the \ud835\udf06MSR value is close to its highest value for small Nmassive values but then decreases with increasing Nmassive values. However, the \ud835\udf06MSR value eventually plateaus to a value around 1 (including the 1 \ud835\udf0e uncertainty) till the maximum measured Nmassive value. NGC 7243 is such a cluster whose \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profile is shown in Figure 12. There are 19 clusters in our sample which show such profiles, 7 of which have tidal tails. The mass segregation effect seems to be felt only for the most massive cluster members.\n\u2022 Class 4: These clusters show \ud835\udf06MSR values around 1 (including the 1 \ud835\udf0e uncertainty) for nearly all measured Nmassive values. Teutsch 35 is such a cluster whose \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profile is shown in Figure 12. There are 5 clusters in our sample which show such profiles, all of which have tidal tails. These clusters do not show mass segregation.\nIt is not clear whether Class 1 or Class 2 host the most mass segregated clusters, but broadly speaking they have the clusters where the mass segregation effect is experienced by most members. Class 3 clusters have mass segregation for just the most massive members while Class 4 clusters are non-mass segregated. It is intriguing that all Class 4 clusters in this work host tidal tails. Onemay naively interpret that there is a 78.27\u00b121.72% probability (95% binomial confidence interval calculated for finding all 5 clusters with tidal tails) that all non-mass segregated clusters have tidal tails. Since such a scenario is unlikely for all non-mass segregated clusters, we speculate that our initial selection of elongated clusters in 2D space (Section 2) is responsible for preferentially selecting only those non-mass segregated clusters with tidal tails. It is possible that an elongated cluster that is not mass segregated would only seem elongated because of its tidal tails while elongated clusters that are mass segregated would have a more populated halo of lower mass stars whose 2D spatial distribution may appear elongated. Thus all 5 Class 4 clusters hosting tidal tails may just stem from our initial selection of elongated clusters, implying that such a selection of non-mass segregated clusters would yield a 78.27\u00b121.72% probability of such clusters having tidal tails."

The mean age (\u00b1 error on the mean) for each class is also marked. As expected from the \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profiles, the most-mass segregated Class 1 and Class 2 clusters are the oldest with mean ages of 8.62 \u00b1 0.16 log(year) and 8.52 \u00b1 0.12 log(year) respectively. It is unclear whether Class 1 or Class 2 open clusters are older as their mean ages overlap. Class 3 clusters, less mass segregated than Class 2, are younger on average with a mean age of 8.21 \u00b1 0.11 log(year). The non-mass segregated Class 4 clusters with a rather uncertainmean age 7.98\u00b10.26 log(year) of are younger than Class 1 and Class 2 clusters but overlap in mean age with Class 3 cluster. Using an Anderson-Darling test (AD-test; Scholz & Stephens 1987; see Section 3.4 in Bhattacharya et al. 2021b for a detailed description), we can statistically compare if the cluster ages in the different classes are drawn from the different parent distributions. The test requires at least 8 clusters in each class to make an accurate comparison. Hence, we restrict our comparison to the ages of the most mass segregated clusters (22 clusters in Class 1 and Class 2 combined) with that of the relatively less mass-segregated Class 3. With a significance of 0.03 (less than 0.05 thereby rejecting the null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution), the AD-test confirms that the Class 1 and Class 2 clusters have a statistically distinct age (older on average) than Class 3 clusters. We thus statistically find that more mass segregated clusters are older on average than less mass segregated ones. The variation of the degree of mass segregation with age was also studied by Tarricq et al. (2022) for their open clusters (see their Section 5) using the same\ud835\udf06MSR prescription. They had defined\ud835\udf0610 as the MSR for the ten most massive members to compare the degree of mass segregation between clusters. They had found no correlation of\n\ud835\udf0610 with age. Given the variation of the \ud835\udf06MSR values with Nmassive, we do not think it is appropriate to compare the degree of mass segregation between clusters by restricting the comparison to the \ud835\udf06MSR for any one Nmassive value. Finding an appropriate quantifiable comparison between these profiles for different clusters is beyond the scope of this work. The broad division into classes is sufficient to show hints of mass segregation increasing with age (Figure 13)."

            "text": "Themass functions of all 46 open clusters presented here, 20 ofwhich have extended tidal features are a telltale sign of their dissolution. Environmental effects like tidal shocks due to close interactions with giant molecular clouds, spiral arms, the Galactic disc and, in general, interactions with the Galactic tidal field or internal dynamical effects like two-body relaxation lead to mass-loss in an open cluster (Dalessandro et al. 2015). We can estimate the initial mass (Mi) of an open cluster which has lost mass due to interaction with the Galactic tidal field following the analytical prescription by Lamers et al. (2005), as was done for NGC 752 by Bhattacharya et al. (2021a).Mi is estimated with the following relation:\nMi = [( MC M )\ud835\udefe + \ud835\udefett0 ] 1 \ud835\udefe [1 \u2212 qev (t)]\u22121 (3)\nwhere t0 is the dissolution time-scale parameter andMC is the present cluster mass. By comparing the distribution of mass and age of OCs in the solar neighbourhood with theoretical predictions, Lamers et al. (2005) obtained t0 = 3.31.4\u22121.0 Myr. \ud835\udefe is a dimensionless index which depends on the cluster initial density distribution. We adopt \ud835\udefe = 0.62 which is the typical value for open clusters (Lamers et al. 2005; Dalessandro et al. 2015). The function qev(t) describes the mass-loss due to stellar evolution and can be approximated by the following analytical formula:\nlog10 (qev (t)) = (log10 (t) \u2212 a)b + c (4)\nwhere a = 7.0, b = 0.255 and c = \u22121.805, appropriate for all our clusters that have near-solar metallicity, except Alessi 6 for which a = 7.03, b = 0.26 and c = \u22121.8 (see Table 1 in Lamers et al. 2005). Given that the unobserved mass would be small for all our clusters with only the least massive stars remaining unobserved we assume MC = mp. Furthermore, the uncertainty in Mi is dominated by the uncertainty in t0 with the uncertainty in MC having a negligible effect, as was seen for NGC 752 (Bhattacharya et al. 2021a). We thus ignore the uncertainty in MC in calculating Mi. Plugging the values in to Equations 3 & 4, we find Mi for all our clusters, noted in Table 1. Gulliver 44 has the highest Mi = 1410810180\u22125698 M having lost 98.770.52\u22120.84% of its mass, while NGC 3228 has the lowest\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nMi = 19328\u221218 M having lost just 37.44 8.55 \u22126.44% of its mass. Notably, Gulliver 44, IC 4756, NGC 1662, NGC 2423, NGC 2527, NGC 5822 and NGC 6940 are candidates for being the remnants of Young Massive Clusters (which have stellar masses & 104M ) such as those observed in the Milky Way and other galaxies (see review by Portegies Zwart et al. 2010). Figure 15 [top] shows the variation of Mi with the logarithm of cluster age. Older clusters are also clearly seen to have higher initial masses, as expected from Equation 3. There is no clear difference between clusters with tidal tails and those with only a corona. Figure 15 [bottom] shows the variation of Mi with \ud835\udf12intra. The clusters having Mi < 2000 M have higher \ud835\udf12intra and thus are relatively less mass segregated. Clusters with Mi > 2000 M tend to cover a large range in \ud835\udf12intra, indicating that while all the clusters are mass segregated there is no clear relation between \ud835\udf12intra and the amount of mass segregation."

We identify the leading and lagging tail of the Pleiades to be 41.19 pc and 34.5 pc long respectively, within range of that of Blanco 1. Figure D1 for the Pleiades shows that the leading and lagging tidal tails respectively point away from and towards the direction intermediate between the cluster orbit and the GC direction in all three panels. However, conspicuously, there are extra-tidal members other than the tidal tails which point towards the positive Z direction from the cluster center visible in the X-Z and Y-Z panels for the Pleiades in Figure D1. This stream of stars does not seem to be tidally induced as per the criteria discussed in Section 3.5. It corresponds to the direction of the extended tail of the cluster identified by Lodieu et al.

For 5 of them (namely NGC 2527, NGC 5822, NGC 6940, M 39, and Teutsch 35), we confirm the tidal nature of their tails from the distribution of their identified members with respect to the cluster orbit in the galactocentric phase space (Figure D1). For the other 5 (namely Alessi Teutsch 3, NGC 1039, NGC 1528, NGC 2423, and NGC 2546), we find that the extra-tidal members do not show any extended features which point to or away from the direction intermediate between the cluster orbit and direction of the GC (Figure D2). Thus these clusters do not have tidal tails identified in this work.\n\u2022 IC 4756: Ye et al. (2021) claim tidal tails in IC 4756 as it appears extended in the X-Y plane of the galactocentric phase space, similar to the tails of the Hyades (Meingast & Alves 2019) and Praesepe (R\u00f6ser & Schilbach 2019). However the extension in the X-Y plane may simply be due to the line-of-sight extension at the distance of IC 4756 and not due to tidal tails4. In this work, we identify the extended corona of this cluster for the first time.\n\u2022 Previously identified clusters with coronae: Among the 20 clusters having tidal tails identified in this work, IC 2602, M 39 and Pleiades have already been identified by Meingast et al. (2021) to have a corona although they do not explore the tidal nature in these clusters. Pang et al. (2021) searched for tidal tails in IC 2602 but did not identify them. In NGC 2451B, they identified no tidal tails but did identify an extended feature that may be a possible remnant of a star-forming filament (or formed from early stage gas expulsion in the cluster as predicted by Tutukov (1978)). We also identify this extended structure, most clearly visible as the extra-tidal members of NGC 2451B not belonging to either tail in the galactocentric phase space in Figure D1. Thus in this work, we identify the tidal tails of IC 2602 and NGC 2451B for the first time even though their extended corona was known. IC 4665 had already been observed by Pang et al. (2021) to have a corona, which is also what we find.\n\u2022 Newly discovered extended coronae and tidal tails: The tidal tails of all other clusters mentioned have been discovered in this\n4 IC 4756, however, may have tidal tails based on the dissipation of their spatially identified tail members using measured Gaia DR3 astrometry (Xianhao Ye, private communication).\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nwork totalling 14 clusters, with 5 more identified by Tarricq et al. (2022) being confirmed to have tidal tails in this work. We report just the extended coronae of 26 open clusters. Notably, NGC 6940 is the most distant cluster with tidal tails discovered fromGaia data at over 1 kpc away. Alessi 6 in particular has an elongated feature in addition to its tidal tails (see its extra-tidal members in Figure D1). Given the cluster has an age of log(t) = 8.803, it is unlikely that this elongated feature is associated with the remnants of a filament. However, it is possible that this feature belongs to a stream associated with Alessi 6, as was found for Coma Berenices (Tang et al. 2019) and Alpha Persei (Nikiforova et al. 2020)."

            "text": "Selecting a sample of open clusters having elongated morphology (determined by Hu et al. 2021), we utilise the robust membership determination algorithm, ML-MOC, to identify their member stars in the deep Gaia EDR3 data. 46 open clusters were found to have an extended corona of stars beyond their tidal radius. We computed the mass function slopes (Section 3.4) for all the clusters separately for all members, the intra-tidal members, the extra-tidal members and the tails where possible. The mass function slopes for all members and just the intra-tidal members were flatter than the Salpeter value for all clusters. The mass function slope for the intra-tidal region was shown to be a good approximation of the mass function slope of the entire cluster. We also estimated the initial mass for the open clusters, which was found to increase linearly with age. Furthermore, clusters with low Mi had a relatively higher \ud835\udf12intra while those with high Mi spanned a wide range in \ud835\udf12intra. We further computed the \ud835\udf06MSR vs. Nmassive profiles (Section 4.2) of the open clusters using the MST-based prescription described in Allison et al. (2009). From these profiles, we can divide our sample into four assigned mass segregation classes, with Class 1 and Class 2 clusters being more mass segregated, being the oldest and showing the largest deviation of the mass function slope from the Salpeter slope on average. Class 3 clusters are relatively less mass segregated, having lower age on average and lower average mass function slope deviation from the Salpeter value compared to Class 1 and Class 2 clusters. Class 4 clusters are non-mass segregated with a younger mean age but consistent within errors with Class 3 clusters. 41 of the 46 open clusters studied in this work exhibit mass segregation to some degree. We note that the mass function slope\u2019s deviation from the Salpeter value is not a measure of an individual cluster\u2019s degree of mass segregation and is also not a sufficient condition for mass segregation in a cluster (Section 4.4). 20 of the open clusters have tidal tails based on their relative position to the cluster orbit direction, discussed in Section 3.3. 14 of them have their tidal tails identified for the first time in this work with 5 more candidates whose tail alignment with the cluster orbit are confirmed in this work. We find more extended tails for the Pleiades than previous works. We also find that NGC 6940, the most distant open cluster with tidal tails found till date, has the longest physical distance spanned by its tidal tails in this work. We thus add 19 open clusters to the 13 that were already known to have tidal tails. With future data releases of Gaia, we expect to find even more open clusters with tidal tails while also better estimating the spatial distribution of those already known as well as checking the dissipation of tail members."

Z., 2020, ApJ, 889, 99\nAPPENDIX A: COMPLETENESS OF GAIA EDR3 DATA AND CONTAMINATION OF ML-MOC MEMBERSHIP DETERMINATION\nGaia EDR3 completeness has been explored for globular clusters by comparing the observed Gaia EDR3 sources with deeper Hubble Space Telescope data (Fabricius et al. 2021). The 90% completeness limit ranged from G\u223c16\u201320 mag depending mostly on stellar density (and the scanning law), being deepest at the less dense outskirts of some of the globular clusters6. The number density towards most open clusters is \u223c 104\u2013105 stars per sq. deg. at their densest centers (E.g. Rao et al. 2021), even less dense than the outskirts of globular clusters. We explore the completeness of Gaia EDR3 data at the position of NGC 2448, as a representative of open clusters in this work.\n6 see Gaia EDR3 Documentation Chapter 8.7.1 for examples.\nFigure A1. Percentage completeness of the Gaia EDR3 catalogue at the position of NGC 2448.\nFigure A2. CMD showing the ML-MOC member candidates identified for Berkeley 39 from Gaia EDR3 data. Those candidates classified as members using their RV measurements from GES are marked in blue while those classified as outliers are marked in red.\nWe compare the Gaia EDR3 data with the deeper Pan-STARRS-1 DR2 catalogue (Flewelling et al. 2020) in the same spatial region around this cluster (within 15.07 pc, which is the cluster radius). The Pan-STARRS-1 DR2 (PS1) astrometry is already matched to the Gaia reference frame, so we identify PS1 counterparts in the Gaia EDR3 data around this cluster. 90% of PS1 sources are identified down to G\u223c 20 mag with the percentage completeness rapidly declining beyond G\u223c 20.5 mag (Figure A1). While the Gaia EDR3 completeness is a function also of the Gaia scanning law (Fabricius et al. 2021), the position of most of our open clusters near the galactic plane (Figure 3) would mean they occupy the deepest parts of the sky scanned by Gaia. As such, the 90% completeness limit would likely not be much brighter than G\u223c 20 mag for these clusters. Contamination of ML-MOC selected cluster members in Gaia DR2 data has been explored by Agarwal et al. (2021) with contamination fractions varying between 5\u201312%, with contaminants being mostly present at the faint end. With the improved Gaia EDR3 photometry and astrometry, the percentage contamination of ML-MOC\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201317 (2022)\nmembers is expected to reduce. A way to check the contamination fraction is to compare the ML-MOC members identified in an open cluster from Gaia EDR3 data with RV members determined from deep spectroscopic data. Since none of the open clusters studied in this work have such deep spectroscopic data available publicly, we utilise the ML-MOC members of Berkeley 39 (whose blue straggler population was studied by Vaidya et al. 2020 and Rao et al. 2021 from Gaia DR2) which has deep spectroscopic observations from the Gaia ESO survey (GES Bragaglia et al. 2022) down to G\u223c 19.5mag. ML-MOC identified 963 members in Berkeley 39 out to\u223c 44\u2032 from the cluster center, 481 of which have RVmeasurements from GES (limited to within 14\u2032 from the cluster center). The mean RV of these GES stars is 59.17 km s\u22121 with \ud835\udf0e = 5.62 km s\u22121. We assume that those sources within 3 \ud835\udf0e of the mean RV are cluster members while the rest are outliers (its possible for members to have RV beyond this limit especially if they are binary stars but we take this as a conservative estimate). Only 11 stars were identified as outliers this way giving a contamination of 2.3%. Figure A2 shows all the ML-MOC members of Berkeley 39 in grey, those identified as GES RV members in blue and those as GES RV outliers in red. Note the outliers cover a wide magnitude range and are not restricted to the faint end. As such GES RV members are reliably identified also down to G\u223c 19.5 mag. The contamination percentage of ML-MOC members for the clusters studied in this work should also be close to 2.3% down to G\u223c 19.5 mag, where the Gaia data is also more than 90% complete."

(2022) have estimated rt for their studied open clusters from the King profile fit to their identified members. In Figure C1, we compare the estimated rt for the 33 open clusters in common between Tarricq et al. (2022) and this work. The rt value from Tarricq et al. (2022) is significantly larger in most cases compared to that estimated from this work.
