1. **Investigate the effect of different linker lengths and compositions on the binding affinity, internalization, and biodistribution of PSMA-targeting ligands.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with varying linker lengths and compositions and evaluating their properties in vitro and in vivo.
2. **Explore the use of different chelators for radiolabeling PSMA-targeting ligands.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different chelators and evaluating their radiochemical properties, stability, and biodistribution.
3. **Develop theranostic pairs of PSMA-targeting ligands for both imaging and therapy.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different targeting moieties and therapeutic payloads and evaluating their efficacy in vitro and in vivo.
4. **Investigate the use of PSMA-targeting ligands for targeted drug delivery.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different targeting moieties and drug payloads and evaluating their efficacy in vitro and in vivo.
5. **Develop PSMA-targeting ligands that are resistant to proteolytic degradation.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different linker sequences and evaluating their stability in the presence of proteolytic enzymes.
