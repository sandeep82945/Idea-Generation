            "text": "Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began in early 2020, close to 760 million cases of infection and over 6.8 million deaths have been reported by the WHO. The emergency use authorization by drug administration agencies worldwide allowed anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to start by the end of 2020, with over 5.5 billion people receiving at least 1 dose and more than 5.1 billion fully vaccinated (at least 2 doses) as of April, 2023. This astounding global vaccination effort has been kick-started by mRNA-based vaccines encoding a stabilized version of the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, developed by either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech. Both vaccines had indeed demonstrated rapid and strong immune responses and efficacy in phase III studies, eliciting effective B cell\u2013dependent humoral immunity, with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, which are key to prevention of severe COVID-19 and mortality (1\u20137). Yet, the neutralizing antibody titers in sera from vaccinees decreased rapidly for the first 3 months, with a relatively slow decrease thereafter (8, 9). SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination generates protective B cell responses targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Whereas anti-spike memory B cell responses are long lasting, the anti-spike humoral antibody response progressively wanes, making booster vaccinations necessary for maintaining protective immunity. Here, we qualitatively investigated the plasmablast responses by measuring from single cells within hours of sampling the affinity of their secreted antibody for the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in cohorts of BNT162b2-vaccinated naive and COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals. Using a droplet microfluidic and imaging approach, we analyzed more than 4,000 single IgG-secreting cells, revealing high interindividual variability in affinity for RBD, with variations over 4 logs. High-affinity plasmablasts were induced by BNT162b2 vaccination against Hu-1 and Omicron RBD but disappeared quickly thereafter, whereas low-affinity plasmablasts represented more than 65% of the plasmablast response at all time points. Our droplet-based method thus proves efficient at fast and qualitative immune monitoring and should be helpful for optimization of vaccination protocols.\n2 R E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E JCI Insight 2023;8(13):e166602 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166602 An additional challenge is the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, raising concerns that the immunity raised against the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (termed Hu-1 herein), either following natural infection or following vaccination, would not be protective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) (10, 11). Whereas most VOCs (B.1.1.7 [Alpha], B.1.351 [Beta], P.1 [Gamma], B1.617.2 [Delta]) harbor relatively few (8\u201312) amino acid mutations in their spike protein as compared with the original Hu-1 strain, the Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.4/BA.5 variants harbor 24\u201334 mutations, making immune escape by these latter variants highly probable (12). Most clinically approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) indeed fail to protect from these newest variants (13, 14). This continuous emergence of novel viral variants isolated from patients drives a continuous vaccination effort to induce long-term immune responses with the hope to cover all present and future viral variants. The main efforts to characterize the patient\u2019s immune response to natural infection and/or vaccination focused on serological profiling of the circulating neutralizing antibody responses, and on spike- or RBDspecific memory B cells (MBCs), from which a selection of antibodies was expressed and assayed in vitro for neutralization potency and binding affinity (15, 16). While convergent results following natural infection and/ or vaccination report a fast decrease in serum neutralization over the first 3 months, the MBC response over time remains relatively stable against the original Hu-1 strain as well as most VOCs, with antibodies expressed from these repertoires exhibiting a wide range of 0.2\u20132,000 nM binding affinity against Hu-1 spike/RBD (3, 7, 15, 17). Moreover, the cross-reactivity of anti\u2013Hu-1 antibody and MBC responses with Omicron was reported to be approximately 30% after 2 vaccine doses (18, 19) and up to 50% after 3 doses (16). Rare studies have included the analysis of spike-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), i.e., plasmablasts and plasma cells. Two investigations published by the Ellebedy lab analyzed bone marrow cells and fine-needle aspirates of lymph nodes (9, 20). These studies described expression of antibodies from bone marrow, lymph node plasma cells, and circulating plasmablasts, with up to 1,500 mAbs recombinantly expressed for a single study (20). This impressive work nevertheless required single-cell sorting, antibody variable region (VH-VL) gene sequencing, repertoire analyses, cloning/synthesis, recombinant expression, and finally, affinity measurements. Therefore, while being extremely informative, such an approach entails a large workload, cost, and time investments, and thus the total number of antibodies that can be eventually analyzed is limited. The ability to measure large numbers of spike-specific antibody binding affinity directly can shed light on the immune response following infection or vaccination in a rapid fashion that will help evaluate vaccination protocols and public health measures. We describe here an adaptation for such human studies of a dropletbased microfluidic technology (DropMap) with same-day results obtained at highly reduced workload and costs (21). DropMap combines the immobilization within an observation chamber of approximately 100,000 picoliter-size droplets containing nonsorted single cells with an ultrasensitive fluorescent bioassay. DropMap was reported for mouse studies to qualitatively follow immune responses to protein immunization (22), bacteria (23), viruses (24), and abnormal IgG secretion (25), and for clinical studies to measure single-cell cytokine secretion from sepsis patients (26), cytotoxicity from single human NK cells (27), and affinity and secretion rate of IgGs secreted by autoreactive IgG-secreting cells from blood, spleen, and bone marrow of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (28). Using this massively parallel kinetic analyses of single ASCs, we evaluated the initial circulating ASC responses in cohorts of individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Two cohorts were included, one of individuals with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19\u2013naive), and one of individuals who had recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 year before (COVID-19\u2013revovered). We followed these cohorts over time, after 1 or 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and analyzed their ASC response against Hu-1 RBD, and for selected individuals also for BA.1 RBD."

            "text": "Single-cell bioassay allows phenotypic characterization of RBD-specific ASCs. For this study, we adapted a singlecell bioassay in microfluidic droplets termed DropMap that we have described previously (22, 26, 28). DropMap allows for a direct sorting-free assessment of the antibody-based cellular immune response, while characterizing the secretion rate, specificity, and affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Hu-1 RBD of human IgG secreted by circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells, which here we collectively term IgG-secreting cells (IgG-SCs), allowing for analysis of 10,000\u201320,000 cells/hour. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of volunteers were coencapsulated in droplets along with paramagnetic nanoparticles and fluorescent bioassay reagents that were immobilized within an observation chamber and imaged over 1 hour by time-lapse fluorescence imaging (Figure 1A\n3 R E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E JCI Insight 2023;8(13):e166602 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166602 and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi. org/10.1172/jci.insight.166602DS1). Including paramagnetic beads in the droplets allows the use of a magnetic field to align them and make a clearly distinguishable pattern (termed the \u201cbeadline\u201d) by microscopy. The beads were coated with an IgG capture reagent, and the droplets contained a fluorescently labeled IgG detection reagent and fluorescently labeled monomeric RBD, leading to a fluorescent beadline when IgG is secreted within the droplet. The beadline thus serves as a physical surface for a double-fluorescent sandwich immunoassay, revealing IgG secretion from the cell and specificity of that IgG for the antigen (i.e., Hu-1 RBD; Figure 1, B and C). Image analyses consisted of 5 stages: (i) identifying each droplet and its spatial coordinates within the DropMap chamber; (ii) identifying the beadline within each droplet; (iii) selecting droplets containing a single cell; (iv) extracting for each time point the fluorescence signals of the beadline, and of the entire droplet without the beadline; and (v) calculating the fluorescence accumulation on the beadline over time. Each droplet is assessed individually, both computationally and visually, to ensure proper assay formation and data fidelity. The time-resolved fluorescence signals allow for the estimation of IgG secretion rates and affinity for RBD of the secreted IgG by using calibration curves generated with a monoclonal anti-RBD IgG with known affinity (KD) encapsulated at various concentrations (Supplemental Figure 1B). The resulting anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD reference curve, generated using 7 different anti-RBD IgG mAbs of various affinities (29), allows for measurements with certainty over 2 logs of affinities, i.e., 2 \u00d7 10\u201310 \u2264 KD \u2264 5 \u00d7 10 \u20138 M (Figure 1D). Therefore herein, IgG interacting with RBD at a calculated KD below 5 \u00d7 10 \u20138 M is considered binding, i.e., anti-RBD IgG antibodies, and the cell secreting such IgGs is termed RBD-specific IgG-SCs. Selected individuals were part of 2 longitudinal cohorts: a first cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients (4 severe [S-CoV] and 14 mild [M-CoV]), which is part of the MEMO-COV-2 cohort (7) followed for 1 year after initial infection prior to vaccination; and a second cohort of 11 COVID-19\u2013naive healthcare workers, with no clinical history of COVID-19 and no serological evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (verified by the absence of anti\u2013SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies), vaccinated as part of the French vaccination program. All individuals received the BNT162b2 vaccine and were sampled for circulating IgG-SC analyses after prime and/or boost (17). At the time of this clinical study, COVID-19\u2013naive individuals could receive a primary vaccination and a booster vaccination, whereas COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals were considered already primed by the infection, and therefore were given only 1 vaccine dose. As an example, blood was obtained from 1 COVID-19\u2013naive donor (donor Na-5; 33 y/o, male) who was sampled 6 days after booster vaccination, from 1 mild COVID-19\u2013 recovered patient (patient M-CoV39; 34 y/o, male) and 1 severe COVID-19\u2013recovered patient (patient S-CoV16; 61 y/o, male) who were sampled 7 days after vaccination (Figure 1E), with detectable Hu-1 RBD\u2013specific IgG-SCs for all 3 individuals. These cells displayed a large range of secretion rates of IgG (~15\u2013300 molecules per second [IgG/s]), with median values of approximately 30, 60, and 60 IgG/s in these 3 individuals, respectively. Anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD IgG-SC populations following vaccination in naive or COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals. Our 2 cohorts included a total of 29 individuals, with a median age of 47 years (ranging from 27 to 65 years). Clinical characteristics are presented in Supplemental Table 1 and anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD titers in Supplemental Figure 2, A and B. To investigate the affinity and secretion rate of anti-RBD IgG-SCs, fresh blood samples were acquired in duplicate and analyzed on the same day, enabling the analysis of 10,000\u201320,000 single cells in total for each sample. We found that the frequency of IgG-SCs was from 0.01% to 2.5% of the mononuclear cell pool in the blood across all time points in the cohort. RBD-specific IgG-SCs could be identified in all samples, with high reproducibility in total and RBD-specific IgG-SC detection per replicate (exemplified in Supplemental Figure 2C). The 2 COVID-19\u2013naive sampled before vaccination exhibited rare but detectable low-affinity (50 nM \u2264 KD \u2264 10 nM, median of 34 nM) anti-RBD IgG\u2013producing IgG-SCs (Figure 2A), even if their serum anti-RBD IgG titers were negative (Supplemental Figure 2A). IgG-SCs represented approximately 1% of total PBMCs, with approximately 6% RBD-binding among total IgG-SCs in both naive individuals. We also identified rare low-affinity anti-RBD ASCs in frozen prepandemic PBMC samples of 3 blood bank donors (Supplemental Figure 2D), suggesting that seasonal Betacoronavirus led to the generation of these cross-reactive low-affinity IgG-SCs to SARS-CoV-2 Hu-1 RBD. The 2 COVID-19\u2013 recovered individuals sampled before vaccination also exhibited only low-affinity (median of 47 nM) antiRBD IgG\u2013producing IgG-SCs, with IgG-SCs representing approximately 1% of total PBMCs and with 2% RBD-binding among total IgG-SCs (Figure 2A). Based on these data, we conclude that previous COVID-19\nR E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E\nR E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E\n6 R E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E JCI Insight 2023;8(13):e166602 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166602 increase (1.5-fold) in IgG secretion rate was detected more than 6 weeks after the second dose in COVID-19\u2013naive individuals compared with prevaccination. Noticeably, this increase reached the levels found in COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals (Figure 2B). No correlation was found, however, between affinity for RBD and IgG secretion rate using either the pooled data from all individuals or pooled data from subgroups of individuals (Supplemental Figure 5, B\u2013K). In terms of range of affinities and their distribution, the anti-RBD IgG-SC response appeared very similar between COVID-19\u2013naive and COVID-19\u2013recovered within 1 to 2 weeks after receiving the second and the first vaccine dose, respectively, with both cohorts displaying similar proportions between low-, medium-, and high-affinity IgG-SCs. Both groups demonstrated over the following weeks a rapid disappearance of high- and medium-affinity IgG-SCs in circulation, while keeping a similar fraction of low-affinity RBDspecific IgG-SCs among circulating IgG-SCs (Figure 2C). Thus, in both cohorts, the recall response mobilizing RBD-specific B cells generated a few weeks after mRNA vaccination in COVID-19\u2013naive or in COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals (1 year after infection) elicits a burst of low-affinity anti-RBD IgG-SCs that rapidly wanes in the circulating blood. Anti\u2013Omicron BA.1 RBD IgG-SC populations following vaccination in naive or recovered individuals. The Omicron BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in France in early December, 2021, and we considered whether we could detect anti\u2013BA.1 RBD cross-binding IgG-SCs in the samples collected before its emergence. Using fluorescently labeled BA.1 RBD, we generated a droplet bioassay (Figure 3A) and reference curve using BA.1 RBD cross-binding mAbs (Figure 3, B and C). Frozen samples of 1 vaccinated COVID-19\u2013naive individual (Na-15; 41 y/o female; 6 days after second dose), 1 vaccinated mildCOVID-19\u2013recovered individual (M-CoV-45; 41 y/o female; 8 days after first dose), and 1 vaccinated severe-COVID-19\u2013recovered (S-CoV16; 61 y/o male; 55 days after first dose) individual were assayed in duplicate and in parallel the same day for measurement of affinity of their IgG-SCs for Hu-1 and BA.1 RBD. The distribution and affinity ranges of anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD IgG-SCs in these thawed samples (Figure 3D) were similar to those detected in the fresh samples (panels Na-15, M-CoV-45, and S-CoV-16 in Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Interestingly, anti\u2013BA.1 RBD IgG-SCs could be detected in all 3 samples collected before the appearance of this SARS-CoV-2 variant, with 20%\u201350% fewer BA.1 RBD IgG-SCs compared with Hu-1 RBD IgG-SCs (Figure 3, D and E). Medium- and high-affinity anti\u2013BA.1 RBD IgG-SCs were detected, with similar median affinities in each individual for BA.1 and Hu-1 RBD, and also between these 3 individuals. As in our analyses of anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD IgG-SCs, low-affinity anti\u2013BA.1 RBD IgG-SCs largely predominated in circulation over high-affinity IgG-SCs (Figure 3E). We conclude that approximately 50%\u201380% of the Hu-1 RBD IgG-SCs elicited by booster vaccination were crossreactive with the Omicron BA.1 VOC."

            "text": "This study demonstrates the power of the droplet-based microfluidic approach (DropMap) (22, 28) for the rapid follow-up of the human immune response to a pathogen, with results obtained within hours of sampling. Herein we provide a broad \u201caffinity repertoire\u201d characterization of circulating IgG-SCs over several time points following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination for the original Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 RBD. It describes similar expansion and contraction of the circulating RBD-specific plasmablast pool following mRNA-based vaccination for prime/boosted COVID-19\u2013naive and boosted COVID-19\u2013 recovered individuals, reaching high proportions (up to a third) of the total circulating plasmablast pool, in agreement with flow cytometry analyses (9, 30, 31) and proportions of RBD-specific antibodies among circulating antibodies (15). We make the unanticipated observation that the majority of RBD-specific IgG-SCs were of lower affinity both in COVID-19\u2013naive and \u2013recovered individuals. The Ellebedy lab also reported that a large majority of plasmablasts producing antibodies with lower affinities \u2014 median of 80 nM \u2014 were also found in individuals who had received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine 6 months earlier (20). Unexpectedly, we identified in the prevaccination samples of 2 COVID-19\u2013naive donors with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, as well as in 3 prepandemic blood bank samples, rare IgG-SCs with low affinity for Hu-1 RBD. As Betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1) shared some, albeit limited, degree of homology with the Hu-1 RBD (32), this suggests, as previously described in the MBC compartment (7), a cross-reactivity against conserved epitopes. Alternatively, the detection of IgG-SCs with low affinity for Hu-1 RBD may also reflect intrinsic polyreactivity in the plasma cell compartment (33, 34).\nR E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E\n8 R E S O U R C E A N D T E C H N I C A L A D V A N C E JCI Insight 2023;8(13):e166602 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166602 prevalence of Hu-1 RBD\u2013specific IgG-SCs among the total IgG-SC population (9, 31). Our results thus further support the notion that the reduced neutralization capacity of vaccinee plasma toward BA.1 SARSCoV-2 is largely due to a drop in the number of antibodies recognizing the BA.1 RBD, as opposed to a global shift in affinity, within the context of RBD-specific clones. The DropMap technique also allows for precise quantification of single-cell antibody secretion. The amount of Ig secreted by single IgG-SCs remains poorly characterized, with most studies assessing only global Ig concentrations or titers. Previous attempts to quantify IgG secretion by human IgG-SCs were performed only on in vitro\u2013derived B cells and have reported a broad range of estimated secretion rates, including approximately 450,000 IgG/s (~1 ng/cell/day) (39) down to approximately 10 IgG/s (~20 fg/cell/day) (40). We have recently reported that ex vivo IgG-SCs from healthy individuals had IgG secretion rates between approximately 5 and 500 IgG/s in the blood, bone marrow, and spleen (28), which are consistent with the secretion rates we describe here for vaccine-induced IgG-SCs. Our data show that COVID-19\u2013recovered individuals display a higher basal IgG secretion level in anti\u2013Hu-1 RBD IgG-SCs compared with COVID-19\u2013naive individuals. This heightened level of secretion was reached in COVID-19\u2013naive individuals several weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2. More investigation would be valuable to further establish physiological secretion rates of IgG-SCs and what conditions either attenuate or potentiate Ig secretion over time, and to guide alternative vaccine design. This study is the second application of DropMap to monitor human IgG-SCs, with several consistent findings regarding IgG-SC physiology between 2 different antigens (a human glycoprotein [28] versus a viral surface protein) and models driving IgG-SC generation (autoimmunity versus immunization). DropMap has also been used in other aspects of immune monitoring, including cytokine secretion by T cells from healthy or sepsis patients (26) and cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity from single human NK cells (27, 41). Despite the advantages afforded by droplet microfluidic techniques, it should be noted that such analyses require precise fabrication of imaging apparatuses and microfluidics consumables, which are currently not commercially available. Nonetheless, the affinity repertoire is a valuable component of the B cell responses to evaluate. Combining DropMap with other single-cell technologies, such as BCR sequencing and single-cell transcriptomics to correlate phenotype with genotype, and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry proteomics will ultimately allow for a more complete understanding of the key aspects in antibody-mediated immunity (reviewed in ref. 21). This study provides direct ex vivo, sorting-free analyses to assess the prevalence and quality of antigen-specific cells among circulating IgG-SCs following human vaccination. Application of similar DropMap screenings following vaccination could be valuable to determine whether the proportions of specific IgG-SCs we observed is consistent between vaccine designs (adenovirus-, protein-, or mRNAbased), different types of pathogens (bacteria vs. viruses), and different antigens and doses. Together, these endeavors highlight the functional diversity of antibodies generated following immunization and offer demonstration of efficient, high-throughput methods for characterizing B cell responses."

Aqueous phase I: preparation of cells for droplet compartmentalization Cell suspensions were centrifuged (300g, 5 minutes) and resuspended twice using MACS buffer (PBS pH 7.2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mM EDTA). After each resuspension, cells were filtered through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer to eliminate aggregates. Cells were then spun (300g, 5 minutes) and resuspended in DropMap buffer (RPMI without phenol red supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic F68, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5% KnockOut serum replacement [Thermo Fisher Scientific], and 0.5% human serum albumin [Sigma-Aldrich]). Cell density was adjusted to achieve a mean number of cells per droplet of approximately 0.3. For calibration curves, monoclonal IgG antibodies were diluted in DropMap buffer. Aqueous phase II: preparation of beads and bioassay reagents Paramagnetic nanoparticles (Strep Plus 300 nm, Ademtech) were washed with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS with calcium and magnesium (DPBS++, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In each fluorescence channel and for each droplet, the pixel intensities of the beadline and the mean pixel intensities except the beadline (background fluorescence) were extracted. Droplet fluorescence relocation at each time point was calculated by dividing the intensity of the beadline by that of the background. Data were exported to Excel (Microsoft) and sorted for droplets showing an increase in relocation of the anti-IgG reporter fluorescence (Alexa Fluor 647) over time and above a threshold of Alexa Fluor 647 relocation greater than 1.3. Sorted droplets were visually assessed for the presence of a single cell within the droplet, no droplet movement between image acquisitions, the absence of fluorescent particles other than the beadline (e.g., fluorescent protein aggregates, cell debris), and undesired aggregation of fluorescent reporters on the cell surface inside the droplet. IgG secretion rate and dissociation constant (KD) were estimated as described previously (22).\nEstimation of KD for RBD within each droplet. A reference curve was obtained by defining relocation values for anti-IgG (Alexa Fluor 647) and RBD with a panel of 7 anti-RBD mAbs with a 1 log KD range, determined using bio-layer interferometry (ForteBio). Droplet populations were generated with different concentrations of each mAb or buffer and the DropMap bioassay. A curve was defined by plotting the relocation from the anti-IgG (Alexa Fluor 647) against relocation of RBD, and the slope of the resulting line was calculated and termed \u201cDropMap slope.\u201d The reference curve was defined by the linear relationship between KD for RBD as defined by bio-layer interferometry and the DropMap slope of each mAb."
