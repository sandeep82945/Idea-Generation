    "abstractText": "In this paper we present an overview on recent progress in studies of QCD at finite temperature and densities within the functional renormalization group (fRG) approach. The fRG is a nonperturbative continuum field approach, in which quantum, thermal and density fluctuations are integrated in successively with the evolution of the renormalization group (RG) scale. The fRG results for the QCD phase structure and the location of the critical end point (CEP), the QCD equation of state (EoS), the magnetic EoS, baryon number fluctuations confronted with recent experimental measurements, various critical exponents, spectral functions in the critical region, the dynamical critical exponent, etc., are presented. Recent estimates of the location of the CEP from first-principle QCD calculations within fRG and Dyson-Schwinger Equations, which passes through lattice benchmark tests at small baryon chemical potentials, converge in a rather small region at baryon chemical potentials of about 600 MeV. A region of inhomogeneous instability indicated by a negative wave function renormalization is found with \u03bcB & 420 MeV. It is found that the non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis of the net-proton number distributions on the beam collision energy observed in experiments, could arise from the increasingly sharp crossover in the regime of low collision energy.",

China\nIn this paper we present an overview on recent progress in studies of QCD at finite temperature and densities within the functional renormalization group (fRG) approach. The fRG is a nonperturbative continuum field approach, in which quantum, thermal and density fluctuations are integrated in successively with the evolution of the renormalization group (RG) scale. The fRG results for the QCD phase structure and the location of the critical end point (CEP), the QCD equation of state (EoS), the magnetic EoS, baryon number fluctuations confronted with recent experimental measurements, various critical exponents, spectral functions in the critical region, the dynamical critical exponent, etc., are presented. Recent estimates of the location of the CEP from first-principle QCD calculations within fRG and Dyson-Schwinger Equations, which passes through lattice benchmark tests at small baryon chemical potentials, converge in a rather small region at baryon chemical potentials of about 600 MeV. A region of inhomogeneous instability indicated by a negative wave function renormalization is found with \u00b5B & 420 MeV. It is found that the non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis of the net-proton number distributions on the beam collision energy observed in experiments, could arise from the increasingly sharp crossover in the regime of low collision energy.\nCONTENTS\nI.

INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most challenging questions in heavy-ion physics arises from the attempt to understand how the deconfined quarks and gluons, i.e., the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), evolve into the confined hadrons. This\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n00 46\n8v 1\n[ he\npph\n] 1\nM ay\n2 02\n2\n2 evolution involves apparently two different phase transitions: One is the confinement-deconfinement phase transition and the other is the chiral phase transition related to the breaking and restoration of the chiral symmetry of QCD. When the strange quark is in its physical mass and the u and d quarks are massless, i.e., in the chiral limit, the chiral phase transition in the regime of small chemical potential in the QCD phase diagram, see e.g., Figure 14, might be of second order, and belongs to the O(4) symmetry universality class [1, 2]. With the increase of the baryon chemical potential, the second-order phase transition might be changed into a first-order one at the tricritical point. When the u and d quarks are in their small, but nonvanishing physical masses, due to the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry, the O(4) second-order chiral phase transition turns into a continuous crossover [3], which is also consistent with experimental measurements, cf. e.g., [4]. The tricritical point in the phase diagram evolves into a critical end point (CEP), which is the end point of the first-order phase transition line at high baryon chemical potential or densities.\nAlthough the phase transition at the CEP is of second order and belongs to the Z(2) symmetry universality class, the location of CEP and the size of the critical region around the CEP are non-universal. From the paradigm of the QCD phase diagram described above, one can easily find that the CEP plays a pivotal role in understanding the whole QCD phase structure in terms of the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. As a consequence, it becomes an very important task to search for and pin down the location of the CEP in the QCD phase diagram. Lattice simulations provide us with a wealth of knowledge of QCD phase transitions at vanishing and small baryon chemical potential, cf. e.g., [5\u201316], but due to the sign problem at finite chemical potentials, lattice calculations are usually restricted in the region of \u00b5B/T . 2 \u223c 3, where no signal of CEP is observed [17]. Notably, recent estimates of the location of CEP from first-principle functional approaches, such as the functional renormalization group (fRG) and DysonSchwinger Equations (DSE), which passes through lattice benchmark tests at small baryon chemical potentials, converge in a rather small region at baryon chemical potentials of about 600 MeV [18\u201320], and see also, e.g., [21] for related discussions.\nSearch for the CEP is currently under way or planned at many facilities, see, e.g., [4, 22\u201333]. Since the CEP is of second order, the correlation length increases significantly in the critical region in the vicinity of a CEP. Moreover, it is well known that fluctuation observables, e.g., the fluctuations of conserved charges, are very sensitive to the critical dynamics, and the increased correlation length would result in the increase of the fluctuations as well. Therefore, it has been proposed that a non-monotonic dependence of the conserved charge fluctuations on the beam collision energy can be used to search for the CEP in experimental measurements [34\u2013\n36], cf. also [22]. In the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the last decade, cumulants of net-proton, net-charge and net-kaon multiplicity distributions of different orders, and their correlations have been measured [37\u201344]. Notably, recently a non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis of the net-proton multiplicity distribution on the collision energy is observed with 3.1\u03c3 significance for central gold-on-gold (Au+Au) collisions [42].\nIn this work we would like to present an overview on recent progress in studies of QCD at finite temperature and densities within the fRG approach. The fRG is a nonperturbative continuum field approach, in which quantum, thermal and density fluctuations are integrated in successively with the evolution of the renormalization group (RG) scale [45], cf. also [46, 47]. For QCD-related reviews, see, e.g., [48\u201355]. Remarkably, recent years have seen significant progress in first-principle fRG calculations, for example, the state-of-the-art quantitative fRG results for Yang-Mills theory in the vacuum [56] and at finite temperature [57], vacuum QCD results in the quenched approximation [58], unquenched QCD in the vacuum [59\u201361] and at finite temperature and densities [18, 62].\nIn this paper we try to present a self-contained overview, which include some fundamental derivations. Although new researchers in this field, e.g., students, may find these derivations useful, familiar readers could just skip over them. Furthermore, in this paper we focus on studies of fRG at finite temperature and densities, so we have to give up some topics, which in fact are very important for the developments and applications of the fRG approach, such as the quantitative fRG calculations to QCD in the vacuum [56, 58, 61].\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section II we introduce the formalism of the fRG approach, including the Wetterich equation, the flow equations of correlation functions, the technique of dynamical hadronization, etc. Moreover, we also give a brief discussion about the Wilson\u2019s recursion formula and the Polchinski equation, which are closely related to the fRG approach. In Section III we discuss the application of fRG in the low energy effective field theories (LEFTs), including the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model and the quark-meson model. The relevant results in LEFTs, e.g., the phase structure, the equation of state, baryon number fluctuations, critical exponents, are presented. In Section IV we turn to the application of fRG to QCD at finite temperature and densities. After a discussion about the flows of the propagators, strong couplings, four-quark couplings and the Yukawa couplings, we present and discuss the relevant results, e.g., the natural emergence of LEFTs from QCD, several different chiral condensates, QCD phase diagram and QCD phase structure, the inhomogeneous instability at large baryon chemical potentials, the magnetic equation of state, etc. In Section V we discuss the real-time fRG. After the derivation of the fRG flows on the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, one formu-\n3 lates the real-time effective action in terms of the \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cquantum\u201d fields in the physical representation. The spectral functions and the dynamical critical exponent of the O(N) scalar theory are discussed. In Section VI a summary with conclusions is given. Moreover, an example for the flow equations of the gluon and ghost self-energies in Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature is given in Appendix A. The Fierz-complete basis of four-quark interactions of Nf = 2 flavors is listed in Appendix B, and some useful flow functions are collected in Appendix C."

It can even include fields which do not appear in the original classical action, and we will come back to this topic in what follows. The suffix of \u03a6\u0302, a, denotes not only the discrete degrees of freedom, e.g., the species, inner components of fields, etc., but also the continuous spacetime coordinates or the energy and momenta. The external source Ja is conjugated to \u03a6\u0302a. A summation or/and integral is assumed for a repeated index as shown\nin Equation (1). The k-dependent regulator \u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] in Equation (1) is used to suppress quantum fluctuations of momenta q . k, while leave those of q > k untouched. Usually, a bilinear term, convenient in actual computations, is adopted for the regulator, which reads\n\u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] = 1\n2 \u03a6\u0302aR\nab k \u03a6\u0302b , (2)\nwith Rabk = R ba k for bosonic indices and R ab k = \u2212Rbak for fermionic ones. See e.g., [49] for discussions about\ngeneric regulators. We will see in the following that the IR cutoff k here is essentially the renormalization group (RG) scale.\nWe proceed to taking a single scalar field \u03d5 for example, and the relevant regulator reads\n\u2206Sk[\u03d5] = 1\n2\n\u222b d4xd4y\u03d5(x)Rk(x, y)\u03d5(y) . (3)\nIt is more convenient to work in the momentum space. Employing the Fourier transformation as follows\n\u03d5(x) =\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03d5(q)eiqx , (4)\nRk(x, y) =\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 Rk(q)e\niq(x\u2212y) , (5)\none is led to\n\u2206Sk[\u03d5] = 1\n2\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03d5(\u2212q)Rk(q)\u03d5(q) . (6)\nHere, the regulator has the following asymptotic properties which read\nRk\u2192\u221e(q)\u2192\u221e, and Rk\u21920(q)\u2192 0 , (7)\nwith a fixed q. In order to fulfill the aforementioned requirement, viz., only suppressing quantum fluctuations of momenta q . k selectively, one could make the choice as follows\nRk(q) \u2223\u2223 q<k \u223c k2, Rk(q) \u2223\u2223 q>k \u223c 0 . (8)\nOne may have already noticed that there are infinite regulators fulfilling Equation (8). Here, we present two classes of regulators that are frequently used in literatures: One is the exponential-like regulator as follows\nRexp,nk (q) = q 2rexp,n(q 2/k2) , (9)\nwith\nrexp,n(x) = xn\u22121\nexn \u2212 1 . (10)\nThe sharpness of regulator in the vicinity of q = k is determined by the parameter n, as shown in Figure 1, where the exponential regulators with n = 1 and 2 are depicted as functions of q with a fixed k. In Figure 1 we also plot another commonly used regulator, i.e., the flat or optimized one [63, 64], which reads\nRoptk (q) = q 2ropt(q 2/k2) , (11)\nwith\nropt(x) = ( 1 x \u2212 1 ) \u0398(1\u2212 x) , (12)\n4 q= k k 2 q R optk (q) R exp, 1k (q) R exp, 2k (q) 1 2 t R optk (q) 1 2 t R exp, 1k (q) 1 2 t R exp, 2k (q)\nFIG. 1. Comparison of several different regulators and their derivative with respect to the RG scale k as functions of the momentum q with a fixed k.\nwhere \u0398(x) is the Heaviside step function. Moreover, the derivative of regulator with respect to the RG scale k, to wit,\n\u2202tRk(q) \u2261 k\u2202kRk(q) , (13) is also shown in Figure 1, where t is usually called as the RG time. For more discussions about regulators, see, e.g., [65].\nIt is more convenient to use the generating functional for connected correlation functions, viz.,\nWk[J ] = lnZk[J ] , (14)\nwhich is also known as the Schwinger function. Then, the expected value of a field is readily obtained as\n\u03a6a \u2261 \u3008\u03a6\u0302a\u3009 = \u03b4Wk[J ]\n\u03b4Ja , (15)\nand the propagator reads\nGk,ab \u2261 \u3008\u03a6\u0302a\u03a6\u0302b\u3009c = \u3008\u03a6\u0302a\u03a6\u0302b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a6\u0302a\u3009\u3008\u03a6\u0302b\u3009\n= \u03b42Wk[J ]\n\u03b4JaJb , (16)\nwhere the subscript c stands for \u201cconnected\u201d. Moreover, Legendre transformation to the Schwinger function leaves us immediately with the one particle irreducible (1PI) effective action, which reads\n\u0393k[\u03a6] = \u2212Wk[J ] + Ja\u03a6a \u2212\u2206Sk[\u03a6] . (17) In order to take both bosonic and fermionic fields into account all together, we adopt the notation introduced in [49], to wit,\nJa\u03a6a = \u03b3 a b\u03a6aJ b , (18)\nwith\n\u03b3ab = { \u2212\u03b4ab, a and b are fermionic, \u03b4ab, others.\n(19)\nInserting Equation (18) into Equation (17) and differentiating both sides of Equation (17) with respect to \u03a6a, one is led to\n\u03b4(\u0393k[\u03a6] + \u2206Sk[\u03a6])\n\u03b4\u03a6a = \u03b3abJ b , (20)\nwhereby, the propagator in Equation (16) is readily written as the inverse of the second-order derivative of \u0393k[\u03a6] w.r.t. \u03a6, i.e.,\nGk,ab = \u03b3 c a\n( \u0393\n(2) k [\u03a6] + \u2206S (2) k [\u03a6] )\u22121 cb , (21)\nwith\n( \u0393\n(2) k [\u03a6] + \u2206S (2) k [\u03a6]\n)ab \u2261 \u03b4 2(\u0393k[\u03a6] + \u2206Sk[\u03a6])\n\u03b4\u03a6a\u03b4\u03a6b . (22)\nWe proceed to considering the evolution of Schwinger function with the RG scale, i.e., the flow equation of Wk[J ], which is straightforwardly obtained from Eqs. (1) and (14). The resulting flow reads\n\u2202tWk[J ] = \u2212 1\n2 STr\n[( \u2202tRk ) Gk ] \u2212 1\n2 \u03a6a\u2202tR\nab k \u03a6b , (23)\nwhere we have introduced a notation super trace for compactness, which can also be expressed as\nSTr [( \u2202tRk ) Gk ] = ( \u2202tR ab k ) \u03b3cbGk,ca . (24)\nThe factor \u03b3 in the equation above indicates that the super trace provides an additional minus sign for fermionic degrees of freedom. Note that in deriving Equation (23) we have used the relation in Equation (16). Applying Legendre transformation in Equation (17) to the flow equation of Schwinger function in Equation (23) once more, one immediately arrives at the flow equation of the effective action, as follows\n\u2202t\u0393k[\u03a6] = \u2212\u2202tWk[J ]\u2212 \u2202t\u2206Sk[\u03a6]\n= 1\n2 STr\n[( \u2202tRk ) Gk ] , (25)\nwhich is the Wetterich equation [45]. Note that the flow equation of effective action in Equation (25) would be modified when the dynamical hadronization is encoded, see Equation (80). In Section II C we would like to give an example for the application of fRG, and postpone discussions of the dynamical hadronization in Section II E."

We begin\n6 with a generating functional for a scalar field theory in four Euclidean dimensions with a momentum cutoff, i.e.,\nZ[J ] = \u222b (D\u03c6) exp {\u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4\n[ \u2212 1\n2 \u03c6(p)\u03c6(\u2212p)(p2 +m2)\n\u00d7K\u22121 ( p2\n\u039b20\n) + J(p)\u03c6(\u2212p) ] + Lint(\u03c6) } , (42)\nwith a cutoff function given by\nK(p2/\u039b20) = { 1, p2 < \u039b20, 0, p2 \u039b20.\n(43)\nEvidently, here \u039b0 plays a role as a UV cutoff scale, and Lint in Equation (42) is the interaction Lagrangian at the scale \u039b0, that for example reads\nLint(\u03c6) =\n\u222b d4x [ \u2212 1\n2 \u03c101\u03c6 2(x)\u2212 1 2 \u03c102 ( \u2202\u00b5\u03c6(x) )2\n\u2212 1 4! \u03c103\u03c6\n4(x) ] , (44)\nwhere we have used the notation in [69], and \u03c10a\u2019s stand for bare quantities.\nOne would like to integrate out the high momentum modes of \u03c6 and reduce the UV cutoff \u039b0 to a lower value, say \u039b.

Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish different strong couplings. The renormalized strong couplings in the glue sector read\ng\u0304A3,k = \u03bbA3,k\nZ 3/2 A,k\n, g\u0304A4,k = \u03bb\n1/2 A4,k\nZA,k , g\u0304c\u0304cA,k =\n\u03bbc\u0304cA,k\nZ 1/2 A,k Zc,k\n,\n(51)\nwhere \u03bbA3,k, \u03bbA4,k and \u03bbc\u0304cA,k stand for the three-gluon, four-gluon, ghost-gluon dressing functions, respectively, as shown in Equation (A42), Equation (A48), Equation (A36). In Equation (50) the gluonic strong couplings are denoted collectively as g\u0304glue,k. In the same way, the quark-gluon coupling reads\ng\u0304q\u0304qA,k = \u03bbq\u0304qA,k\nZ 1/2 A,k Zq,k\n, (52)\nwith the quark-gluon dressing function \u03bbq\u0304qA,k. The covariant derivative in the fundamental and adjoint representations of the color SU(Nc) group reads\nD\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5 \u2212 iZ1/2A,kg\u0304q\u0304qA,kAa\u00b5ta , (53)\nDab\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03b4 ab \u2212 Z1/2A,kg\u0304c\u0304cA,kfabcAc\u00b5 , (54)\nrespectively. Here fabc is the antisymmetric structure constant of the SU(Nc) group, determined from its Lie algebra [ta, tb] = ifabctc, where the generators have the normalization Tr tatb = (1/2)\u03b4ab.\nIn Equation (48) the formalism of Nf = 3 flavor quark is built upon that of Nf = 2 by means of addition of a dynamical strange quark qs, whose constituent quark mass ms(\u03c3s) is determined self-consistently from a extended effective potential of SU(Nf = 2), and see [18] for more details. Therefore, we have the quark field q = (ql, qs), where the u and d light quarks are denoted by ql = (qu, qd). The light quarks interact with themself through the four-quark coupling in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0 channel, and they are also coupled with the \u03c3 and \u03c0 mesons via the Yukawa coupling. Here T i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the generators of the group SU(Nf = 2) in the flavor space with\nTrT iT j = (1/2)\u03b4ij and T 0 = (1/ \u221a\n2Nf )1Nf\u00d7Nf with Nf = 2. In Equation (48) \u00b5\u0302 = diag(\u00b5u, \u00b5d, \u00b5s) stands for the matrix of quark chemical potentials.\nThe effective potential in Equation (48) can be decomposed into two parts as follows\nVk(\u03c1,A0) = Vglue,k(A0) + Vmat,k(\u03c1,A0) . (55)\nThe first term on the r.h.s. of equation above is the glue potential, or the Polyakov loop potential. The temporal gluon field A0 is intimately related to the Polyakov loop L[A0], see e.g., [70]; the second term is the mesonic effective potential of Nf = 2 flavors, which is O(4)-invariant with \u03c1 = \u03c62/2. Moreover, in the effective action in Equation (48) c\u03c3 and c\u03c3s are the parameters of explicit chiral symmetry breaking for the light and strange scalars \u03c3, \u03c3s, respectively.\nApplying the fRG flow equation in Equation (25) to the QCD effective action in Equation (48), one immediately arrives at the QCD flow equation, which is depicted in Figure 2. One can see that the flow of effective potential receives contributions from the gluon, ghost, quark, and composite fields separately, each of which is one-loop structure. It should be emphasized that, although it is a one-loop structure, the flow is composed of full propagators which are in turn dependent on the second derivative of the effective action, see Equation (21). Thus, the flow equation in Figure 2 a functional self-consistent differential equation, which will be explored further in the following."

            "text": "In Section II C we have mentioned that the mesonic fields in Equation (48) are not added by hands. On the contrary, these composite degrees of freedom are dynamically generated from fundamental ones with the evolution of the RG scale from the ultraviolet (UV) toward infrared (IR) limit. This is done via a technique called the dynamical hadronization, which was proposed in [71, 75], and subsequently the formalism was further developed in [49]. Notably, recently the explicit chiral symmetry breaking and its role within the dynamical hadronization have been investigated in detail in [18], and a flow of dynamical hadronization with manifest chiral symmetry is put forward therein. In this section, we follow [18] and present the derivation of flow equation of the dynamical hadronization.\nWe denote the original or fundamental degrees of freedom in QCD as \u03d5\u0302 = (A\u0302, c\u0302, \u02c6\u0304c, q\u0302, \u02c6\u0304q) with the expected value \u03d5 = \u3008\u03d5\u0302\u3009, whereas composite degrees of freedom are introduced via a RG scale k-dependent composite field \u03c6\u0302k(\u03d5\u0302) [49, 71, 75], which is a function of the fundamental field \u03d5\u0302. Then the superfield reads\n\u03a6 = (\u03d5, \u03c6k) = (A, c, c\u0304, q, q\u0304, \u03c6k) , (62)\nwith\n\u03c6k = \u3008\u03c6\u0302k(\u03d5\u0302)\u3009 . (63)\nThe generating functional in Equation (1) is modified a bit such that\nZk[J ] = exp ( Wk[J ] )\n= \u222b (D\u03d5\u0302) exp { \u2212 SQCD[\u03d5\u0302]\u2212\u2206Sk[\u03d5\u0302, \u03c6\u0302k] + J\u03d5 \u00b7 \u03d5\u0302\n+ J\u03c6 \u00b7 \u03c6\u0302k } , (64)\n9 where the external source J = (J\u03d5, J\u03c6) with J\u03d5 = (JA, Jc, Jc\u0304, Jq, Jq\u0304) is conjugated to the field \u03a6 = (\u03d5, \u03c6k), distinguished with different labels of indices, i.e.,\nJ \u00b7 \u03a6\u0302 = Ja\u03a6\u0302a, J\u03d5 \u00b7 \u03d5\u0302 = J\u03b1\u03d5 \u03d5\u0302\u03b1, J\u03c6 \u00b7 \u03c6\u0302k = J i\u03c6\u03c6\u0302k,i . (65)\nThe regulator of bilinear fields in Equation (64) reads\n\u2206Sk[\u03d5\u0302, \u03c6\u0302k] = \u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] = 1\n2 \u03a6\u0302aR\nab k \u03a6\u0302b . (66)\nThe effective action is obtained via a Legendre transformation to the Schwinger function as shown in Equation (17). Note that the term of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the effective action, e.g., \u2212c\u03c3\u03c3 or \u2212c\u03c3s\u03c3s/ \u221a\n2 in Equation (48), does not contribute to the flow of effective action, and thus the effective action can always be decomposed into that in the case of chiral limit plus an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term. We follow [18] and separate the explicit breaking out, such that\n\u0393k[\u03a6] = \u0393\u0304k[\u03a6]\u2212 c\u03c3\u03c3 , (67)\nwhere we have concentrated on the case of Nf = 2, that can be easily extended to include the strange quark. \u0393\u0304k in Equation (67) stands for the effective action without the explicit chiral symmetry breaking. From Equation (67), one arrives at\n\u0393k[\u03a6]\u2212 J \u00b7 \u03a6 = \u0393\u0304k[\u03a6]\u2212 c\u03c3\u03c3 \u2212 J \u00b7 \u03a6\n= \u0393\u0304k[\u03a6]\u2212 J\u0304 \u00b7 \u03a6 , (68)\nwith\nJ\u0304 = (J\u03d5, J\u03c3 + c\u03c3, J\u03c0) , (69)\ni.e.,\nJ\u0304\u03c3 = J\u03c3 + c\u03c3 , J\u0304\u03d5 = J\u03d5 , J\u0304\u03c0 = J\u03c0 . (70)\nEquation (68) combined with Equation (17) leaves us with the relation for Schwinger functions as follows\nWk[J ] = W\u0304k[J\u0304 ] , (71)\nwhere one has\nW\u0304k[J ] = Wk[J ] \u2223\u2223\u2223 c\u03c3\u21920 , (72)\nthat is, W\u0304k denotes the Schwinger function in the absence of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking. Similar with Equation (25), one arrives at\n\u2202t\u0393\u0304k[\u03a6] = \u2212\u2202tW\u0304k[J\u0304 ]\u2212 \u2202t\u2206Sk[\u03a6] , (73)\nwhere W\u0304k[J\u0304 ] = ln Z\u0304k[J\u0304 ] can be obtained in Equation (64) with J\u0304 in lieu of J and a chiral symmetric SQCD[\u03d5\u0302]. Sub-\nsequently, one arrives at\n\u2202tW\u0304k[J\u0304 ]\n= 1\nZ\u0304k[J\u0304 ]\n\u222b (D\u03d5\u0302) ( \u2212 \u2202t\u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] + J\u0304\u03c6 \u00b7 \u2202t\u03c6\u0302k )\n\u00d7 exp { \u2212 SQCD[\u03d5\u0302]\u2212\u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] + J\u0304\u03d5 \u00b7 \u03d5\u0302+ J\u0304\u03c6 \u00b7 \u03c6\u0302k } .\n(74)\nIt is straightforward to obtain\n\u2202t\u2206Sk[\u03a6\u0302] = 1 2 \u03a6\u0302a ( \u2202tR ab k ) \u03a6\u0302b + \u03c6\u0302k,iR ij k,\u03c6 ( \u2202t\u03c6\u0302k,j ) . (75)\nInserting Equation (75) into Equation (74) and then to Equation (73), one is led to\n\u2202t\u0393\u0304k[\u03a6] = 1\n2 Gk,ab\u2202tR\nab k + \u3008\u03c6\u0302k,iRijk,\u03c6 ( \u2202t\u03c6\u0302k,j ) \u3009\n\u2212 J\u0304 i\u03c6\u3008\u2202t\u03c6\u0302k,i\u3009 , (76)\nwhere Equation (16) has been used.

(79)\nGiven the relation in Equation (68) and the fact that c\u03c3 is independent of the RG scale k, we finally obtain the flow equation of effective action with dynamical hadronization, to wit,\n\u2202t\u0393k[\u03a6]\n= 1\n2 STr\n( Gk[\u03a6] \u2202tRk ) + Tr ( G\u03c6\u03a6a [\u03a6]\n\u03b4\u3008\u2202t\u03c6\u0302k\u3009 \u03b4\u03a6a R\u03c6\n)\n\u2212 \u222b \u3008\u2202t\u03c6\u0302k,i\u3009 ( \u03b4\u0393k[\u03a6]\n\u03b4\u03c6i + c\u03c3\u03b4i \u03c3\n) , (80)\nwhere some summations for the indices {a} and {i} as shown in Equation (65) have been replaced with the super trace and trace, respectively; the integral over the spacetime coordinate is recovered for the last term on the r.h.s. of Equation (80). The propagator Gk,ia in\n10\nEquation (79) is relabeled with Gk,\u03c6i\u03a6a that has a clearer physical meaning. One can see that in comparison to Equation (25), there are two additional terms, i.e., the last two on the r.h.s. of Equation (80), in the flow equation of the effective action. These additional terms arise from the RG scale dependent composite field in Equation (63), and they can be employed to implement the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation for every value of the RG scale, which eventually transfers the degrees of freedom from quarks to bound states."

            "text": "One prominent feature characteristic to the nonperturbative QCD is the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, which is regarded as being responsible for the origin of the \u223c 98% mass of visible matter in the universe [78\u201381], in contradistinction to the \u223c 2% electroweak mass. Within the fRG approach, the dynamical breaking or restoration of the chiral symmetry is well encoded in the four-fermion flows, that is illustrated briefly in what follows. For more details, see, e.g., [77, 82\u201390] and a related review [53].\nUsing the method to derive the flow equation for a generic vertex as shown in Equation (61), one is able to obtain the flow equation of four-quark coupling, depicted schematically in Figure 4. Here we refrain from going into the details of a realistic calculation, but rather try to infer behaviors of the four-quark flow connected to breaking or restoration of the chiral symmetry. It follows from Figure 4 that the \u03b2 function for the dimensionless\nfour-quark coupling \u03bb\u0304 \u2261 k2\u03bb reads\n\u03b2 \u2261\u2202t\u03bb\u0304 = (d\u2212 2)\u03bb\u0304\u2212 a\u03bb\u03042 \u2212 b\u03bb\u0304g2 \u2212 cg4 , (81)\nwith the dimension of spacetime d = 4 and the strong coupling g. Note that apart from the first term on the r.h.s. of Equation (81) arising from the dimension of \u03bb, the remaining three terms corresponds to the three classes of diagrams in Figure 5 one by one, and their coefficients are denoted by a, b, c, respectively. Further computation indicates one has a > 0 and c > 0 [76].\nIn the left panel of Figure 5, a typical \u03b2 function is plotted as a function of the dimensionless four-quark coupling schematically in different cases. When the gauge coupling g is vanishing and at zero temperature, there are two fixed points: One is the Gaussian IR fixed point \u03bb\u0304 = 0, the other the UV attractive fixed point at a nonvanishing \u03bb\u0304, and they are shown in the plot by red and purple dots, respectively. The position of the UV fixed point determines a critical value \u03bb\u0304c, which is necessitated in order to break the chiral symmetry, since only when \u03bb\u0304 > \u03bb\u0304c, the four-quark coupling grows large and eventually diverges with the decreasing RG scale. When the temperature is turned on, the IR fixed point remains at the origin while the UV fixed point move towards right, as shown by the red dashed line. As a consequence, the broken chiral symmetry in the vacuum is restored at a finite T , if one has a value of \u03bb\u0304 with \u03bb\u0304c(T = 0) < \u03bb\u0304 < \u03bb\u0304c(T ). When the strong coupling is nonzero, the parabola of \u03b2 function moves downwards globally as shown by the blue curve in the left panel of Figure 5. There is a critical value of the strong coupling, say gc, once one has g > gc, the whole curve of the beta function is below the line \u03b2 = 0, which implies that the chiral symmetry breaking is bound to occur, no matter how large the initial value of \u03bb\u0304 is.\nThe four-fermion flow is also well suited for an analysis of the chiral symmetry breaking in an external magnetic field. The inclusion of a magnetic field would modify the four-quark flows as well as the fixed-point structure [77, 84]. The plot in the right panel of Figure 5 is obtained in [77], which demonstrates that in the case with a magnetic field the flow pattern of the four-quark coupling has been changed and the chiral symmetry is always broken. This is in fact due to the dimensional reduction under a finite external magnetic field. Moreover, it is found that once the in-medium effects of temperature and densities are implemented, long-range correlations are screened and the vanishing critical coupling shown by the red line in the right panel of Figure 5 is not zero anymore [77].\nRecently, a Fierz-complete four-fermion model is employed to investigate the phase structure at finite temperature and quark chemical potential, and it is found that the inclusion of four-quark channels other than the conventionally used scalar-pseudoscalar ones not only plays an important role in the phase diagram at large chemical potential, but also affects the dynamics at small chemical potential [86]. The related fixed-point structure is analyzed at finite chemical potential in the Fierz-complete\nNJL model, and it is found the dynamics is dominated by diquarks at large chemical potential [87]. Resorting to the fRG flows of four-quark interactions, one is able to observe the natural emergence of the NJL model at intermediate and low energy scales from fundamental quark-gluon interactions [88]. Equation of state of nuclear matter at supranuclear densities is also studied in the Fierz-complete setting [89], and a maximal speed of sound is found at supranuclear densities, that is related to the emergence of color superconductivity in the regime of high densities, i.e., the formation of a diquark gap, see also [90] for details. Moreover, the UA(1) symmetry and its effect on the chiral phase transition are investigated in the Fierz-complete basis [91].\nUp to now, we have only discussed the chiral symmetry and its breaking by means of the four-fermion flows. As mentioned in the beginning of Section III A, a direct consequence of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is the production of mass, that is our central concern in the following. Here, we discuss a recent progress in understanding the quark mass generation and the emergence of bound states in terms of RG flows [92]. Considering only the quark degrees of freedom in Equation (48) and extending the scalar-pseudoscalar four-quark interaction to a Fierz-complete set of Nf = 2 flavors, denoted by B in the following, one arrives at a RG-scale dependent effective action, given by\n\u0393k[\u03a6]\n=\n\u222b\nx,y\n[ Zq,k(x, y)q\u0304(x)\u03b3\u00b5\u2202\u00b5q(y) +mq,k(x, y)q\u0304(x)q(y) ]\n\u2212 \u222b\nx,y,w,z\n\u2211 \u03b1\u2208B \u03bb\u03b1,k(x, y, w, z)O\u03b1ijlmq\u0304i(x)qj(y)q\u0304l(w)qm(z) ,\n(82)\nwith \u03a6 = (q, q\u0304) and \u222b x,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2261 \u222b d4x \u222b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Here O\u03b1ijlm stands for the four-quark operator of channel \u03b1, where\nthe indices i, j, l, m run over the Dirac, flavor and color (Nc = 3) spaces, and the related coupling strength is given by \u03bb\u03b1,k. In the same way, summation is assumed for repeated indices. In Appendix B ten independent Fierz-complete channels of four-quark interactions of Nf = 2 flavors are presented.\nThe two-quark correlation function reads\ni j\npp \u2261 \u2212\u0393(2)q\u0304qk,ij (p\u2032, p) , (83)\nwith\n\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k,ij (p\n\u2032, p) \u2261 \u2212 \u03b4 2\u0393k\n\u03b4q\u0304i(p\u2032)\u03b4qj(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03a6=0\n= [ Zq,k(p)i(\u03b3 \u00b7 p)ij +mq,k(p)\u03b4ij ] (2\u03c0)4\u03b44(p\u2032 + p) . (84)\nThen one arrives at the quark propagator with an IR regulator, viz.,\nGqq\u0304k (p, p \u2032) =\n[ \u0393\n(2)q\u0304q k +R q\u0304q k\n]\u22121\n= Gqk(p)(2\u03c0) 4\u03b44(p\u2032 + p) , (85)\nwith a fermionic regulator given by\nRq\u0304qk = Zq,krF (p 2/k2)i\u03b3 \u00b7 p , (86)\nand\nGqk(p) = 1\nZq,k(p)i\u03b3 \u00b7 p+ Zq,krF (p2/k2)i\u03b3 \u00b7 p+mq,k(p) .\n(87)\nNote that the fermionic regulator in Equation (86), in comparison to the bosonic one in Eqs. (9) and (11), is implemented in the vector channel rather than the scalar one, which guarantees that the chiral symmetry is not\nbroken by the regulator. In the same way, one is allowed to make a choice for the specific formalism of the fermionic regulator, e.g., the optimized one,\nrF,opt(x) = ( 1\u221a x \u2212 1 ) \u0398(1\u2212 x) , (88)\nor the exponential one in Equation (10),\nrF (x) = rexp,n(x) = xn\u22121\nexn \u2212 1 , (89)\nand even the simplest exponential regulator as follows\nrF,exp(x) = 1\nx e\u2212x . (90)\nThe four-quark correlation function reads\nm\nli\njq s\np r\n\u2261 \u2212\u0393(4)q\u0304qq\u0304qk,ijlm (p, q, r, s) .

We also depict the flow equation of the two-quark correlation function, i.e., the quark self-energy, in Figure 6."

The coefficient F \u2019s depend on the quark propagators and regulators, and see [92] for their explicit expressions. The flow of quark mass is readily obtained by projecting the flow equation of the quark self-energy in the first line in Figure 6 onto the scalar channel, which reads\n\u2202tmq,k(p)\n=\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 ( \u2202\u0303tG\u0304 q k(q) ) mq,k(q) [3 2 \u03bb\u03c0,k(p, p, q, q)\n+ 23\n2 \u03bb\u03c3,k(p, p, q, q)\u2212\n3 2 \u03bba,k(p, p, q, q)\n+ 1\n2 \u03bb\u03b7,k(p, p, q, q) +\n8 3 \u03bb(S+P )adj\u2212 ,k (p, p, q, q)\n\u2212 16 3 \u03bb(S+P )adj+ ,k\n(p, p, q, q)\u2212 4\u03bb(V+A),k(p, p, q, q) ] ,\n(97)\nwith\n\u2202\u0303tG\u0304 q k(q) = \u22122 ( G\u0304qk(q) )2 ZRq,k(q)q 2\u2202tRF,k(q) .

(99)\nFor the moment, we assume Zq,k = 1 and use the truncation as follows\n\u03bb\u03b1,k = \u03bb\u03b1,k(pi = 0) , (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 4) , (100)\nmq,k = mq,k(p = 0) , (101)\n14\nthat is, neglecting the momentum dependence of the fourquark coupling and quark mass. The dimensionless fourquark coupling \u03bb\u0304\u03b1,k = \u03bb\u03b1,kk\n2 and quark mass m\u0304q,k = mq,k/k are also very useful in the following.\nIn order to focus on the mechanism of quark mass production, we make a further approximation as follows\n\u03bb\u03b1,k = 0 , (\u03b1 /\u2208 {\u03c3, \u03c0}) , (102)\n\u03bb\u03c3\u2212\u03c0,k \u2261 \u03bb\u03c3,k = \u03bb\u03c0,k , (103)\ni.e., only keeping the scalar-pseudoscalar \u03c3 and \u03c0 channel. Then the flow equations in Eqs.

Here we have used the dimensionless variables, which entails that the RG scale k-dependence for\nthese equations is removed. RG flows of \u03bb\u0304\u03c3\u2212\u03c0 and m\u0304q in Eqs. (104) and (105) are depicted in Figure 7.\nThe plane in Figure 7 is segmented into two parts by the red solid line. In the chiral limit the red line crosses the x-axis at the UV fixed point, as shown in Figure 5, and the critical value here is \u03bb\u0304c\u03c3\u2212\u03c0 = 23.08. Interestingly, the UV critical point is extended to being an approximate critical line in the flow diagram in Figure 7, where the word \u201capproximate\u201d is used because the exact chiral symmetry is lost once the quark mass is nonzero. On the l.h.s. of the critical line, there is little dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the quark mass is dominated by the current mass, while on the r.h.s. the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking plays a dominant role. Furthermore, it is observed that in the regime of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, that is, on the r.h.s. of the red line, the dimensionless four-quark coupling increases firstly and then decreases. This is due to the competition between the flow equations of the quark self-energy and the four-quark coupling shown in Figure 6, where the fish diagrams drive the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and result in the increase of the quark mass via the flow of quark self-energy, and in turn the increase of quark mass suppresses fluctuations of the four-quark flow. Finally, a balance is obtained with the decrease of RG scale, where the dimensional mq,k and \u03bb\u03c3\u2212\u03c0,k are not dependent on k any more.\nIn Figure 8 the evolution of four-quark couplings \u03bb\u03b1,k and their dimensionless counterparts \u03bb\u0304\u03b1,k = \u03bb\u03b1,kk\n2 with the RG scale for ten Fierz-complete channels is shown. The results are obtained from calculations, in which the initial values of couplings are chosen to be \u03bb\u0304\u03c0,k=\u039b = \u03bb\u0304\u03c3,k=\u039b = 24.2 and \u03bb\u0304\u03b1,k=\u039b = 0 (\u03b1 /\u2208 {\u03c3, \u03c0}) for other channels, i.e., the coupling strength of channels except the \u03c3 and \u03c0 ones is assumed to be vanishing at the UV cutoff. In the meantime, results obtained from two initial values of quark mass, viz., m\u0304q,k=\u039b = 5\u00d7 10\u22123 (top panels) and 1\u00d710\u22122 (bottom panels), are compared. In both cases one finds that the \u03c0 and \u03c3 channels play a dominant role in the whole range of RG scale, and they are no longer degenerate with the scale evolving towards the IR limit. The strength of the \u03c0 channel is larger than that of the \u03c3 channel. Moreover, one observes that the interaction strength of channels (V \u2212A)adj in Equation (B4) and (S+P )adj\u2212 in Equation (B6) are also excited to some values, though they are significantly smaller than those of the \u03c0 and \u03c3 channels. On the contrary, magnitudes of the remaining channels are very small, and they could be neglected in the whole range of RG scale. In Figure 9 dependence of the quark mass on the RG scale is shown, and in the same way calculations are done with the Fierzcomplete basis of four-quark interactions. Same initial values of the four-quark couplings as those in Figure 8 are employed, and results obtained from different initial values of the quark mass are compared.\n15"

            "text": "Properties of bound states of quarks or antiquarks, e.g., the pions and nucleons, in principle can be inferred from the relevant four-point and six-point vertices of quarks, in some specific channels and regimes of momenta [93]. In Figure 10 a sketch map shows how this happens at the example of mesons. The square denotes a four-point vertex of quark and antiquark. If the total momentum of a quark and an antiquark, denoted by P here, is in the Minkowski spacetime and in the vicinity of the on-shell pole mass of a meson in some channel, i.e., P 2 \u223c \u2212m2meson, the full four-quark vertex can be well described by a resonance of the meson, as shown on the r.h.s. of Figure 10, where two quark-meson vertices are connected with the propagator of meson. Therefore, one has to calculate the full four-quark vertex or quark-meson vertex in some specific regime of momentum, which is usually realized by resuming a four-quark kernel to the order of infinity in the formalism of Bethe-Salpeter equations [94, 95]. Note that the necessary resummation for the four-quark vertex is well included in the flow equation of four-quark couplings in Equation (96), and it is, therefore, natural to expect that the RG flows are also well-suited for the description of bound states as same as the quark mass production in Section III A 1. Moreover, the advantage of RG flows is evident, that is, the self-consistency between the bound states encoded in the flow of four-quark vertices in Equation (96) and that of quark mass gap in Equation (97) can be well guaranteed, once a truncation is made on the level of the effective action, such as that in Equation (82).\nIn order to investigate the resonance behavior of fourquark vertices in Equation (96), one has to go beyond the truncation in Equation (100) and include appropriate momentum dependence for the four-quark vertices. The external momenta of couplings in Equation (96) are parameterized as follows\np1 =p+ P\n2 , p2 = p\u2212\nP 2 , (106)\np3 =p \u2032 \u2212 P\n2 , p4 = p\n\u2032 + P\n2 . (107)\nThen, one is left with the relevant Mandelstam variables\ngiven by\ns =(p1 + p3) 2 = (p+ p\u2032)2 , (108)\nt =(p1 \u2212 p2)2 = P 2 , (109)\nu =(p1 \u2212 p4)2 = (p\u2212 p\u2032)2 . (110)\nIn the following, we focus on the \u03c0 meson and assume, that the total momentum of quark and antiquark in the tchannel is near the regime of on-shell pion mass, viz., one has the t-variable P 2 \u223c \u2212m2\u03c0 in Equation (109). Consequently, the four-quark coupling of the pion channel would be significantly larger than those of other channels, and its dependence on external momenta would be dominated by the t-variable. Thus, one is allowed to make the approximation as follows\n\u03bb\u03c0,k(p1, p2, p3, p4) ' \u03bb\u03c0,k(P 2) , (111)\n\u03bb\u03b1,k(p1, p2, p3, p4) ' \u03bb\u03b1,k(0) , \u03b1 6= \u03c0. (112)\nFurthermore, insofar as the four-quark vertices on the r.h.s. of the flow of coupling in the second line of Figure 6, a simple analysis of relevant momenta for each vertex indicates, that the t-variable dependence is only required to be kept for the vertices in the diagram of t channel, i.e., the first diagram. One is thus allowed to simplify the flow equation of \u03bb\u03c0,k in Equation (96) as\n\u2202t\u03bb\u03c0,k(P 2) = Ck(P 2)\u03bb2\u03c0,k(P 2) +Ak(t, u, s) , (113)\nwith two coefficients given by\nCk(P 2) = \u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 F t\u03c0\u03c0,\u03c0 , (114)\nand\nAk(t, u, s) = \u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4\n{ \u2211\n\u03b1\u2032,\u03b1\u2032\u2032\u2208B\n[ \u03bb\u03b1\u2032,k\u03bb\u03b1\u2032\u2032,k ( F t\u03b1\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032,\u03c0\n+ Fu\u03b1\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032,\u03c0 + Fs\u03b1\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032,\u03c0 )] \u2212 \u03bb2\u03c0,kF t\u03c0\u03c0,\u03c0 } . (115)\nNote that all the four-quark couplings in Equation (115) are momentum independent. If one adopts further p = p\u2032 = 0 in Eqs. (106) and (107), two Mandelstam variables are vanishing, i.e., s = u = 0, and one arrives at\nAk(t, u, s)\u2192 Ak(P 2) . (116)\nOne is able to observe the natural emergence of a bound state arising from resummation of the four-quark vertex from Equation (113), whose solution is readily obtained once the last term on the r.h.s. is ignored. One has\n\u03bb\u03c0,k=0(P 2) =\n\u03bb\u03c0,k=\u039b\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u03c0,k=\u039b \u222b 0 \u039b Ck(P 2)dkk , (117)\n16\nwith \u03bb\u03c0,k=\u039b the four-quark coupling strength of the pion channel at the UV cutoff, that is independent of external momenta. Evidently, when a value of P 2 is chosen appropriately, such that the denominator in Equation (117) is vanishing, the four-quark coupling in the IR \u03bb\u03c0,k=0 is divergent. As a consequence, one can employ this condition to determine the pole mass of the bound state, i.e., the pion mass, which reads\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u03c0,k=\u039b \u222b 0\n\u039b\nCk(P 2 = \u2212m2\u03c0) dk\nk = 0 . (118)\nWhen the coefficient Ak(P 2) in Equation (113) is taken into account, there is no analytic solution anymore. However, as would be shown in the following, direct numerical calculation of Equation (113) indicates that the qualitative behavior of pole displayed by Equation (117) is not changed.\nIn the left panel of Figure 11 the inverse four-quark coupling of the pion channel in the IR limit, i.e., 1/\u03bb\u03c0,k=0, is shown as a function of the Mandelstam variable t = P 2 = P 20 + ~P 2 with ~P = 0. In order to solve the flow equation of four-quark coupling in Equation (113) directly in the Minkowski spacetime with P 2 < 0, one has employed the 3d regulator as follows\nRq\u0304qk = Zq,krF (~p 2/k2)i~\u03b3 \u00b7 ~p , (119)\nin lieu of the 4d one in Equation (86). Relevant results are shown in the plot by scattering points, where different symbols correspond to several different values of\nthe quark mass at the UV cutoff scale m\u0304q,k=\u039b. The 3d regulator allows one to compute the flow equation of the four-quark coupling not only in the Euclidean (P 2 > 0) but also Minkowski (P 2 < 0) regimes, viz., the part on the r.h.s. of the dashed vertical line in the plot and that on the l.h.s., respectively. As shown in Eqs. (117) and (118), the pole mass of pion is determined from position of the zero point of 1/\u03bb\u03c0,k=0, that is, the crossing point between the horizontal dashed line and those of 1/\u03bb\u03c0,k=0 in the left panel of Figure 11. Besides the direct calculations, results of analytic continuation from the Euclidean to Minkowski regimes are also presented in the left panel of Figure 11. Two methods of analytic continuation are employed. One is to fit a simple function which reads\n\u03bb\u03c0,k=0(P 2) \u2248 a0 + a2P\n2 + a4P 4\nc0 + P 2 + c4P 4 . (120)\nHere the coefficients a0, a2, a4, c0, and c4 are determined by fitting the numerical results of P 20 > 0 from Equation (113), and then results of P 20 < 0 are predicted by Equation (120). The other is the Pade\u0301 approximation, where the simple function on the r.h.s. of Equation (120) is replaced by a Pade\u0301 fraction, to wit,\n\u03bb\u03c0,k=0[n, n](P 2) \u2248 \u03bb\u03c0,k=0(P 2) , P 2 > 0 . (121)\nHere, a diagonal fraction with the same order of the polynomials n in the numerator and denominator is used. Note that the simple function in Equation (120) is in fact a Pade\u0301 fraction of order n = 2. The order of Pade\u0301 fraction is varied with n = 25 \u223c 100 in the calculations.\n17\nIn the left panel of Figure 11 the analytically continued results based on the two methods are in comparison to those of direct computation in the Minkowski region with P 2 < 0. Remarkably, it is found that both the analytically continued results are in excellent agreement with the data points obtained from Equation (113). Moreover, in order to verify Goldstone theorem and the nature of Goldstone boson of the pion in the RG flow, one shows the extracted pion mass as a function of the quark mass at the UV cutoff in the right panel of Figure 11. Evidently, the pion mass is found to decrease with the decreasing current quark mass, and it is exactly massless in the chiral limit.\nIn Figure 12 one shows the same physical quantities as the left panel of Figure 11, but obtained with the 4d reg-\nulator. Quite apparently, in the 4d case direct calculation of the flow equation in Equation (113) is only accessible in the Euclidean region, as shown in the scattering points in Figure 12. Thus one has to rely on the analytic continuation to infer the pole mass of pion, and the relevant results are also presented in the plot, where the same two methods of analytic continuation as the case of 3d regulator is used. It is found that, in comparison to the analytically continued results of the 3d regulator, those of the 4d case have significant larger errors, as shown by the bands in Figure 12. The errors are inferred from varying the range of P0, i.e., (0, 0.1\u039b), (0, 0.2\u039b), (0, 0.3\u039b), that is used to fix the analytically continued functions in Equation (120) or Equation (121). In Table I one shows the analytically continued values of the pole mass of pion."

The effective interactions between quarks and mesons in the rebosonized QCD effective action in Equation (48), and their natural emergence resulting from the RG evolution of fundamental degrees of freedom will be discussed in detail in Section IV D. There is a wealth of studies in the literature relevant to the QM model within the fRG approach, see, e.g., [50, 96\u2013151].\nFor the moment, we only consider the degrees of freedom of quarks and mesons and their interactions via the Yukawa coupling in Equation (48).

Thus, one is led to\nVk(\u03c1,A0) =Vglue,k(A0) + Vmat,k(\u03c1,A0) , (123)\nwhere the first term on the r.h.s. is the glue potential or the Polyakov loop potential, since it is usually reformulated by means of the Polyakov loop L(A0), and the latter can be calculated through the flow equation within the QM model. In the following, we still use Vk(\u03c1) to stand for Vmat,k for simplicity in a slight abuse of notation.\n18"

There are two classes of methods to solve the flow equation of the effective potential in Equation (124). The methods of the first class capture local properties of the potential and are very convenient for numerical calculations, but fail to obtain global properties of the potential. A typical method in this class is the Taylor expansion of the effective potential. On the contrary, the methods in the other class are able to provide us with the global properties of the potential, but usually their numerical implements are relatively more difficult. The second class includes the discretization of the potential on a grid [97], the pseudo-spectral methods [152\u2013155], e.g., the Chebyshev expansion of the potential [151], the discontinuous Galerkin method [156, 157], etc. In what follows we give a brief discussion about the Taylor expansion and the Chebyshev expansion of the potential.\nThe Taylor expansion of the effective potential reads\nVk(\u03c1) =\nNv\u2211\nn=0\n\u03bbn,k n! (\u03c1\u2212 \u03bak)n , (132)\nwith the expansion coefficients \u03bbn,k and the expansion point \u03bak that might be k-dependent, where Nv is the maximal expanding order in the calculations. Reformulating Equation (132) in terms of the renormalized variables, one is led to\nV\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) =\nNv\u2211\nn=0\n\u03bb\u0304n,k n! (\u03c1\u0304\u2212 \u03ba\u0304k)n , (133)\nwith\nV\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) = Vmat,k(\u03c1) , \u03c1\u0304 = Z\u03c6,k\u03c1 , (134)\n\u03ba\u0304k = Z\u03c6,k\u03bak , \u03bb\u0304n,k = \u03bbn,k\n(Z\u03c6,k)n , (135)\nSubstituting Equation (133) into the left hand side of Equation (124), one arrives at\n\u2202n\u03c1\u0304 ( \u2202t \u2223\u2223 \u03c1 V\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c1\u0304=\u03ba\u0304k\n=(\u2202t \u2212 n\u03b7\u03c6,k)\u03bb\u0304n,k \u2212 (\u2202t\u03ba\u0304k + \u03b7\u03c6,k\u03ba\u0304k)\u03bb\u0304n+1,k . (136) If the expansion point \u03bak is independent of k, i.e., \u2202t\u03bak = 0, which is usually called as the fixed point expansion, the expression in the second bracket on the r.h.s. of Equation (136) is vanishing. One can see that in this case the expansion coefficients of different orders in Equation (133) decouples from each other in the flow equations, which results in an improved convergence for the Taylor expansion and a better numerical stability [116]. Another commonly used choice is the running expansion, whereof one expands the potential around the field on the EoS for every value of k, that is,\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c1\u0304\n( V\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304)\u2212 c\u0304k\u03c3\u0304 )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c1\u0304=\u03ba\u0304k = 0 , (137)\n19\nwith\n\u03c3\u0304 = Z 1/2 \u03c6,k \u03c3 , c\u0304k = Z \u22121/2 \u03c6,k c . (138)\nHere c is independent of k. Then one arrives at the flow of the expansion point, as follows\n\u2202t\u03ba\u0304k = \u2212 c\u03042k\n\u03bb\u030431,k + c\u0304 2 k\u03bb\u03042,k\n[ \u2202\u03c1\u0304 ( \u2202t \u2223\u2223 \u03c1 V\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) ) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c1\u0304=\u03ba\u0304k\n+ \u03b7\u03c6,k\n( \u03bb\u03041,k\n2 + \u03ba\u0304k\u03bb\u03042,k\n)] . (139)\nFor more discussions about the fixed and running expansions, see, e.g., [59, 116, 118, 128, 148, 158]. In the same way, the field dependence of the Yukawa coupling, i.e., hk(\u03c1) can also be studied within a similar Taylor expansion [116, 148], which encodes higher-order quark-meson interactions. Moreover, effects of the thermal splitting for the mesonic wave function renormalization in the heat bath are also investigated in [148].\nAs for the Chebyshev expansion, the effective potential reads\nV\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) =\nNv\u2211\nn=1\ncn,kTn(\u03c1\u0304) + 1\n2 c0,k , (140)\nwith the Chebyshev polynomials Tn(\u03c1\u0304) and the respective expansion coefficients cn,k. Then, one arrives at the flow of the effective potential as follows\n\u2202t \u2223\u2223 \u03c1 V\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304) = Nv\u2211\nn=1\n( \u2202tcn,k \u2212 dn,k\u03b7\u03c6,k(\u03c1\u0304)\u03c1\u0304 ) Tn(\u03c1\u0304)\n+ 1\n2\n( \u2202tc0,k \u2212 d0,k\u03b7\u03c6,k(\u03c1\u0304)\u03c1\u0304 ) , (141)\nwhere the field dependence of the meson wave function renormalization Z\u03c6,k(\u03c1) as well as the meson anomalous dimension \u03b7\u03c6,k(\u03c1\u0304) is taken into account. Note that the coefficients dn,k are related to cn,k through a recursion relation as shown in [151]. The flow equations of the coefficients in Equation (140) are given by\n\u2202tcm,k = 2\nN + 1\nN\u2211\ni=0\n( \u2202t \u2223\u2223 \u03c1 V\u0304k(\u03c1\u0304i) ) Tm(\u03c1\u0304i)\n+ 2\nN + 1\nNv\u2211\nn=1\nN\u2211\ni=0\ndn,kTm(\u03c1\u0304i)Tn(\u03c1\u0304i)\u03b7\u03c6,k(\u03c1\u0304i)\u03c1\u0304i\n+ 1\nN + 1 d0,k\nN\u2211\ni=0\nTm(\u03c1\u0304i)\u03b7\u03c6,k(\u03c1\u0304i)\u03c1\u0304i , (142)\nwhere the summation for i is performed on N + 1 zeros of the polynomial TN+1(\u03c1\u0304)."

            "heading": "3. Phase structure",
            "text": "In Figure 13 the phase diagram of the Nf = 2 flavor QM model in the chiral limit obtained in [97] is shown. In order to investigate the phase structure, especially in the regime of large chemical potential, the global information of the effective potential in Equation (124) is indispensable. Thus, the potential is discretized on a grid to resolve the flow equation, and see [97] for more details. One\ncan see that in the region of small chemical potentials, there is a second-order chiral phase transition denoted by the blue dashed line. With the decrease of the temperature, the second-order phase transition is changed into the first-order one at the tricritical point denoted by a green asterisk. The red solid lines stand for the first-order phase transition. Moreover, with the further decrease of the temperature, one observes that the firstorder phase transition splits into two phase transition lines, one of which even evolves again into the secondorder phase transition at high chemical potentials. Note that the first-order phase transition line backbends at high chemical potentials [135].\nIn Figure 14 the phase diagram of the Nf = 2 flavor\n21\nQM model obtained with the Chebyshev expansion in [151] is shown. The black dashed line denotes the O(4) second-order phase transition in the chiral limit, and the black dot stands for the tricritical point. The back solid line is the first-order phase transition in the chiral limit, where the splitting at large baryon chemical potential as shown in Figure 13 is not shown explicitly here, and only the left branch is depicted. The solid lines of different colors in Figure 14 correspond to different strengths of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking, i.e., different pion masses, and their end points, that is, the critical end points (CEP) comprise a Z(2) second-order phase tran-\nsition line, which is denoted by the red dashed line.\nAs we have mentioned above, the first-order phase transition line backbends at large chemical potential. It is conjectured that this artifact might arise from the defect that the discontinuity for the potential at high baryon chemical potential is not well dealt with within the grid or pseudo-spectral methods. Recently, a discontinuous Galerkin method has been developed to resolve the flow equation of the effective potential [156, 157], and the relevant result for the two-flavor phase diagram is shown in Figure 15 [157]. Within this approach, the formation and propagation of shocks are allowed, and see [156, 157] for a detailed discussion.\nHowever, very recently another research in [159] finds that the back-bending behavior of the chiral phase boundary at large chemical potential has another different origin. It is found that the appearance of the back-bending behavior depends on the employed regulator [159]. In Figure 16 results of the chiral phase boundary and the entropy density obtained with two different regulators are compared. The left panel corresponds to the usually used 3d flat or optimized regulator, cf. Equation (12) and Equation (88), and the right is obtained with a 3d mass-like regulator, see [159] for more details. The same truncation, i.e., the LPA approximation, is used in both calculations. It is observed that the usually used flat (Litim) regulator results in a back-bending of the chiral phase line at large chemical potential, which is also accompanied by a region of negative entropy density in the chirally symmetric phase, as shown by the blue area in the left panel of Figure 16. On the contrary, in the right panel one finds that the chiral phase line shows no back-bending behavior and the entropy density stays positive if a mass-like regulator is used. See [159] for a more detailed discussion.\nIn heavy-ion collisions since the incident nuclei do not carry the strangeness, the produced QCD matter af-\n22\nter collisions is of strangeness neutrality, that is, the strangeness density nS is vanishing. Usually, the condition of strangeness neutrality requires that the chemical potential of strangeness \u00b5S in Equation (148) is nonvanishing with \u00b5B 6= 0 [140, 141]. The influence of the strangeness neutrality on the phase boundary is investigated in [140], which is presented in Figure 17. One can see in comparison to the case of \u00b5S = 0, the phase boundary moves up slightly due to the strangeness neutrality. In another words, the curvature of the phase boundary is decreased a bit by the condition of strangeness neutrality, and see Section IV F for more discussions about the curvature of phase boundary."

Equation (232) and the relevant discussions in Section IV E, is shown as a function of the reduced temperature t = (T \u2212 Tpc)/Tpc obtained in [110], where Tpc denotes the pseudocritical temperature for the chiral crossover. The fRG calculations are in agreement with the lattice simulations [160]. Furthermore, the mean-field results are also presented for comparison, where those labelled with \u201ceMF\u201d and \u201cMF\u201d are obtained by taking into account or not the fermionic vacuum loop contribution in the calculations, respectively, and see, e.g., [104] for more discussions. In Figure 19 the pressure and the trace anomaly in the Nf = 2 + 1 flavor QM model obtained in [110] are shown as functions of the reduced temperature. The fRG results are compared with the lattice results [161, 162], and it is observed that the fRG results are consistent with the lattice results from the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration (WB), except that the trace anomaly from fRG is a bit larger than that from WB in the regime of high temperature with t & 0.3. Moreover, the mean-field results as well as those including a contribution of the thermal pion gas, are also presented for comparison.\nThe equations of state in Figure 19 are obtained in fRG within the local potential approximation (LPA), where the RG-scale dependence only enters the effective potential in Equation (122). The equations of state are also calculated beyond the LPA approximation in [118]. The relevant results are presented in Figure 20. In the calculations the wave function renormalizations for the mesons and quarks, and the RG scale dependence of the Yukawa coupling are taken into account. In Figure 20 the results beyond LPA are in comparison to the lattice and LPA results. One can see that the trace anomaly is decreased a bit beyond LPA in the regime of T & 1.1Tc. In Figure 21 the influence of the strangeness neutrality on the isentropes is presented obtained in [140]. It is found that, in comparison to the case of \u00b5S = 0, the isentropes with nS = 0 move towards the r.h.s. a bit, and their turning around in the regime of crossover becomes more abruptly. Moreover, isentropes obtained from the Taylor expansion and the grid method for the effective potential are compared, and consistent results are found [163].\nNote that calculations of the equations of state at high baryon densities within the fRG approach have also made progress recently, see, e.g., [89, 164, 165], and the obtained EoS has been employed to study the phenomenology of compact stars [164, 165].\n23"

Here P (NB) denotes the probability distribution of the net baryon number, which can\nbe calculated theoretically from the canonical ensemble with an imaginary chemical potential, and see, e.g., [115, 142] for a detailed discussion. In experimental measurements, since neutrons are difficult to detect, the net proton number distribution is measured, as a proxy for the net baryon number distribution, and see, e.g., [22] for more details. Evidently, \u3008NB\u3009 is the ensemble average of the net baryon number.\nThe relations between the generalized susceptibilities in Equation (164) and the cumulants in Equation (165) for the lowest four orders read\n\u03c7B1 = 1\nV T 3 \u3008NB\u3009 , (166)\n\u03c7B2 = 1\nV T 3 \u3008(\u03b4NB)2\u3009 , (167)\n\u03c7B3 = 1\nV T 3 \u3008(\u03b4NB)3\u3009 , (168)\n\u03c7B4 = 1\nV T 3\n( \u3008(\u03b4NB)4\u3009 \u2212 3 \u3008(\u03b4NB)2\u30092 ) , (169)\nwhich leaves us with the experimental observables as\nfollows\nM =V T 3\u03c7B1 , \u03c3 2 = V T 3\u03c7B2 ,\nS = \u03c7B3 \u03c7B2 \u03c3 , \u03ba = \u03c7B4 \u03c7B2 \u03c3 2 . (170)\nHere M , \u03c32, S, \u03ba stand for the mean value, the variance, the skewness, and the kurtosis of the net baryon or proton number distributions. In the same way, calculations can also be extended to the hyper-order baryon number fluctuations, i.e., \u03c7Bn>4 [104, 150, 166\u2013168].

The baryon number fluctuations as well as fluctuations of other conserved charges, e.g., the electric charge and the strangeness, and correlations among these conserved charges, have been widely studied in literatures. For lattice simulations, see, e.g., [5\u20137, 9\u201311, 15]. Investigations of fluctuations and correlations within the fRG approach to LEFTs can be found in, e.g., [99, 101, 118, 119, 127, 138, 140, 141, 143, 147, 150, 168, 169], and within the mean-field approximations in, e.g., [104, 167, 170\u2013172]. For the relevant studies from Dyson-Schwinger Equations, see, e.g., [173, 174]. Remarkably, recently QCDassisted LEFTs with the fRG approach have been developed and used to study the skewness and kurtosis of the\nbaryon number distributions [118, 119, 127], the baryonstrangeness correlations [140, 141], and the hyper-order baryon number fluctuations [150].\nIn Figure 22 the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions is shown as a function of the temperature at vanishing chemical potential. In the calculations the frequency dependence of the quark wave function renormalization is taken into account [127], whose contribution to the flow of the effective potential is shown schematically in Figure 23. It is found that a summation for the quark external frequency is indispensable to the Silver Blaze property at finite chemical potential, see [127] for a more detailed discussion. From Figure 22, one can see that the summation for the external frequency of the quark\n26\nwave function renormalization improves the agreement between the fRG results and the lattice ones.\nIn Figure 24 the fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order baryon number fluctuations divided by the quadratic one are shown as functions of the temperature at vanishing baryon chemical potential. The fRG results [150] are compared with lattice results from the HotQCD collaboration [9, 10, 15] and the Wuppertal-Budapest collabo-\nration (WB) [11]. It is observed that the fRG results are in quantitative, qualitative agreement with the WB and HotQCD results, respectively. In Figure 25 the baryon number fluctuations of different orders, RB31, R B 42, R B 51, RB62, R B 71 and R B 82, are shown as functions of the temperature with several different values of the baryon chemical potential from 0 to 400 MeV. One finds that the dependence of fluctuations on the temperature oscillates\n27\nmore pronouncedly with the increasing order of cumulants. Moreover, with the increase of the baryon chemical potential the chiral crossover grows sharper, which leads to the increase of the magnitude of fluctuations significantly.\nIn the left panel of Figure 26 the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions is depicted in the phase diagram [150]. The black dashed line denotes the chiral phase boundary in the crossover regime. The green dotted line stands for the chemical freeze-out curve obtained from the STAR freeze-out data [175], see [150] for a more detailed discussion. One can see that there is narrow blue area near the phase boundary with \u00b5B & 300 MeV, which indicates that the kurtosis becomes negative in this area. Moreover, it is found that with the increase of the baryon chemical potential, the freeze-out curve moves towards the blue area firstly, and then deviates from it a bit at large baryon chemical potential. The skewness of the baryon number distributions as a function of the collision energy calculated in the fRG approach is presented in the right panel of Figure 26 [150], which is in comparison to the STAR data of the skewness of the net-proton number distributions Rp32 with centrality 0-5% [176]. It is found that the fRG results are in good agreement with the\nexperimental data except the two lowest energy points, which is attributed to the fact that other effects, e.g., volume fluctuations [177\u2013179], the global baryon number conservation [180\u2013182], become important when the beam collision energy is low.\nIn Figure 27 baryon number fluctuations RB42, R B 62,\nRB82, R B 31, R B 51, and R B 71 are shown as functions of the collision energy obtained within the fRG approach [150], where the chemical freeze-out curve obtained from STAR data as shown in the left panel of Figure 26 is used. The fRG results are compared with experimental data of the kurtosis of the net-proton number distributions Rp42 with centrality 0-5% [42], and the sixth-order cumulant Rp62 with centrality 0-10% [43]. A non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis RB42 on the collision energy is also observed in the fRG calculations, which is consistent with the experimental measurements of Rp42. Moreover, it is found that this non-monotonicity arises from the increasingly sharp crossover with the decrease of the collision energy, which is also reflected in the heat map of the kurtosis in the phase diagram in the left panel of Figure 26. The fRG results of RB62 are also qualitatively consistent with the experimental data of Rp62.\nIn Figure 28 the full results of the baryon number fluc-\n28\ntuations RB42 and R B 62 are compared with those of Taylor expansion for the baryon chemical potential up to the eighth and tenth orders, which can be used to investigate the convergence properties of the Taylor expansion for the baryon chemical potential. For the two values of the temperature, T = 155 MeV and 160 MeV, it is found that the full results deviate from those of Taylor expansion significantly with \u00b5B/T & 1.2 \u223c 1.5. The oscillating behavior of the full results at large baryon chemical potential is not captured by the Taylor expansion, which hints that the convergence radius of the Taylor expansion for the baryon chemical potential might be restricted by some singularity, e.g., the Yang\u2013Lee edge singularity, and see, e.g., [183\u2013186] for more discussions.\nWe close this subsection with a discussion about the correlation between the baryon number and the strangeness, i.e.,\nCBS =\u2212 3 \u03c7BS11 \u03c7S2 , (176)\nwhich is calculated within the fRG approach in [141]. There, the influence of the strangeness neutrality on CBS is investigated, and the relevant results are presented in Figure 29. One can see that the correlation between the baryon number and the strangeness is suppressed by the condition of the strangeness neutrality."

            "text": "According the scaling argument, when a system is in the critical regime, its thermodynamic potential density can be decomposed into a sum of a singular and a regular\npart [66], viz.,\n\u2126 ( t, h )\n= fs(t, h) + freg(t, h) , (177)\nwhereof, the singular part satisfies the scaling relation to the leading order as follows\nfs(t, h) = ` \u2212dfs(t ` yt , h `yh) , (178)\nwith a dimensionless rescaling factor ` and the spacial dimension d. In Eqs. (177) and (178) t and h stand for the reduced temperature and magnetic field, respectively. They are given by\nt = T \u2212 Tc T0 , h = c c0 , (179)\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature in the chiral limit, and T0 and c0 are some normalization values for the temperature T and the strength of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking c as shown in Equation (122), respectively. In the following, the order parameter will be denoted as the magnetization density, and c as the magnetic field strength, i.e.,\nM \u2261 \u03c3 , H \u2261 c . (180) The scaling relation in Equation (178) leaves us with a set of scaling relations for various critical exponents, cf.[66, 190], such as,\nyt = 1\n\u03bd , yh =\n\u03b2\u03b4\n\u03bd , \u03b2 =\n\u03bd 2 (d\u2212 2 + \u03b7) , \u03b3 = \u03b2(\u03b4 \u2212 1) ,\n\u03b3 = (2\u2212 \u03b7)\u03bd , \u03b4 = d+ 2\u2212 \u03b7 d\u2212 2 + \u03b7 , \u03bdd = \u03b2(1 + \u03b4) .\n(181)\nThe critical behavior of the order parameter is described by the critical exponents \u03b2 and \u03b4, which read\nM(t, h = 0) \u223c (\u2212t)\u03b2 , (182)\nwith t < 0, and\nM(t = 0, h) \u223c h1/\u03b4 . (183)\nMoreover, one has the susceptibility of the order parameter \u03c7 and the correlation length \u03be, which scale as\n\u03c7 \u223c |t|\u2212\u03b3 , and \u03be \u223c |t|\u2212\u03bd . (184)\nRecently, the pseudo-spectral method of the Chebyshev expansion for the effective potential has been used to calculate the critical exponents [151]. In the Nf = 2 QM model within the fRG approach, the critical exponents for the 3d O(4) and Z(2) symmetry universality classes, which correspond to the black dashed O(4) phase transition line and the red dashed Z(2) phase transition line as shown in Figure 14 respectively, are calculated with the Chebyshev expansion of the effective potential. Both the LPA and LPA\u2032 approximations are used in the calculations. In the LPA\u2032 approximation a field-dependent mesonic wave function renormalization is taken into account. The relevant results are show in Table II, which are also compared with results of critical exponents from\nother approaches, e.g., Taylor expansion of the effective potential [187\u2013191] and the grid method [192] within the fRG approach, the derivative expansions (DE) up to orders of O(\u22024) and O(\u22026) with the fRG approach [193, 194], the conformal bootstrap for the 3d conformal field theories (CFTs) [195, 196], Monte Carlo simulations [197], and the d = 3 perturbation expansion [198]. In the mean time, the mean-field values of the critical exponents are also shown in the last line of Table II.\nIn Figure 30 the critical exponent \u03b2 for the 3d O(4) and Z(2) symmetry universality classes extracted from different ranges of the temperature is shown, which is obtained with the Chebyshev expansion for the effective potential in the fRG [151]. It is found that only when the temperature is very close to the critical temperature, say |T\u2212Tc| . 0.01 MeV, the fRG results of both the O(4) and Z(2) symmetry universality classes are consistent with the conformal bootstrap results. This indicates that the size of the critical region is extremely small, far smaller than \u223c 1 MeV. Similar estimates for the size of the critical region are also found in, e.g., [98, 190, 199, 200].\n30"

The relevant fRG flows at finite temperature and densities there have been developed from the counterparts in the vacuum in [59, 60]. Furthermore, these flows are also built upon the state-of-the-art quantitative fRG results for Yang-Mills theory in the vacuum [56] and at finite temperature [57], QCD in the vacuum [58, 61].\nIn the following we focus on the chiral phase transition. As mentioned above, the QCD phase transitions involve both the chiral phase transition and the confinementdeconfinement phase transition. In fact, related subjects of the deconfinement phase transition, such as the Wilson loop, the Polyakov loop, the flows of the effective action of a background gauge field, the relation between the confinement and correlation functions, etc., have been widely studied within the fRG approach to Yang-Mills theory and QCD. Significant progresses have been made in relevant studies, see [55] for a recent overview, and also e.g. [70, 108, 201\u2013216]."

            "text": "The flow equations of inverse propagators are obtained by taking the second derivative of the Wetterich equation in Equation (80) with respect to respective fields. The resulting flow equations of the inverse quark, gluon and meson propagators are shown diagrammatically in Figure 31. Making appropriate projections for these flow equations, one is able to arrive at the flow of the wave function renormalization Z\u03a6,k as shown in Equation (49) for a given field \u03a6, which includes nontrivial dispersion relation for the field, and is more conveniently reformulated as the anomalous dimension as follows\n\u03b7\u03a6,k = \u2212 \u2202tZ\u03a6,k Z\u03a6,k . (185)\nThe quark two-point correlation function defined in Equation (84), see also Equation (A24), reads\n\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k (p) =\u2212\n\u03b42\u0393k[\u03a6]\n\u03b4q\u0304(\u2212p)\u03b4q(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03a6=\u03a6EoM\n=Zq,k(p)i\u03b3 \u00b7 p+mq,k(p) , (186)\nwhere \u03a6EoM denotes the fields in Equation (62) on their respective equations of motion, that are vanishing except the \u03c3 field and the temporal gluon field A0. Note that the minus sign on the r.h.s. of Equation (186), while not appearing in Equation (A24), is due to the fact that the right derivative is used in Equation (A24). Moreover, the quark chemical potentials in Equation (48) have been assumed to be vanishing in Equation (186). Apparently, the quark wave function renormalization and mass are readily obtained by projecting Equation (186) onto the vector and scalar channels, respectively, which read\nZq,k(p) = 1\n4i\n1 p2 tr ( \u03b3 \u00b7 p\u0393(2)q\u0304qk (p) )\nmq,k(p) = 1 4 tr ( \u0393 (2)q\u0304q k (p) ) , (187)\nwhere the trace runs only in the Dirac space. Neglecting the dependence of the quark wave function renormalization on the spacial momentum p, one arrives at the quark anomalous dimension as follows\n\u03b7q,k(p0) = 1\n4Zq,k(p0) \u00d7 Re [ \u2202\n\u2202(|p|2) tr ( i\u03b3 \u00b7 p ( \u2202t\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k (p)\n))]\np=0\n,\n(188)\nwhere the computation is done at p = 0, and p0 is a small, but nonvanishing frequency. The nontrivial choice of p0 and the fact that the expression in the square bracket in Equation (188) is complex-valued at nonzero chemical potentials, are both related to constraints from the SilverBlaze property for the correlation functions at finite chemical potentials, and see, e.g., [18, 119, 120, 127, 222] for more details. In Equation (188) Re denotes that the real part of the expression in the square bracket is adopted. Note that in Equation (188) the difference between the parts of the quark wave function renormalization longitudinal and transversal to the heat bath is ignored, where the projection is done on the spacial component, and thus the transversal anomalous dimension is used. The explicit expression of \u03b7q,k is given in Equation (C1). In the left panel of Figure 32, the quark wave function renormalization Zq,k=0(p0,p = 0) is depicted as a function of the temperature with different values of the baryon chemical potential.\nThe mesonic two-point correlation functions, i.e., those\n31\nof the \u03c0 and \u03c3 fields, are given by\n\u0393 (2)\u03c0\u03c0 k (p) =\n\u03b42\u0393k[\u03a6]\n\u03b4\u03c0i(\u2212p)\u03b4\u03c0j(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03a6=\u03a6EoM\n= ( Z\u03c0,k(p)p 2 +m2\u03c0,k ) \u03b4ij , (189)\nand\n\u0393 (2)\u03c3\u03c3 k (p) =\n\u03b42\u0393k[\u03a6]\n\u03b4\u03c3(\u2212p)\u03b4\u03c3(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03a6=\u03a6EoM\n=Z\u03c3,k(p)p 2 +m2\u03c3,k , (190)\nrespectively, where the curvature masses of the mesons\n32\nread\nm2\u03c0,k =V \u2032 k(\u03c1) , m 2 \u03c3,k = V \u2032 k(\u03c1) + 2\u03c1V (2) k (\u03c1) . (191)\nAs same as the quark wave function renormalization, the thermal splitting of the mesonic wave function renormalization in parts longitudinal and transversal to the heat bath is neglected. Moreover, one has assumed a unique renormalization for both the pion and sigma fields, viz., Z\u03c6,k = Z\u03c0,k = Z\u03c3,k. The validity of these approximations have been verified seriously in [148]. The anomalous dimension of mesons at vanishing frequency p0 = 0\nand a finite spacial momentum p is given by\n\u03b7\u03c6(0,p) =\u2212 \u03b4ij\n3Z\u03c6(0,p)\n\u2202t\u0393 (2) \u03c0i\u03c0j (0,p)\u2212 \u2202t\u0393(2)\u03c0i\u03c0j (0, 0)\np2 ,\n(192)\nTwo cases are of special interest: One is the choice p2 = k2, i.e., \u03b7\u03c6(0, k), which captures the most momentum dependence of the mesonic two-point correlation functions, and thus is usually used in the r.h.s. of flow equations involving mesonic degrees of freedom, for more detailed discussions see [18]. The anomalous dimension \u03b7\u03c6(0, k) leaves us with the renormalization constant defined as follows\n1\nZ\u0304\u03c6,k \u2202tZ\u0304\u03c6,k \u2261 \u2212\u03b7\u03c6(0, k) , with Z\u0304\u03c6,k=\u039b = 1 . (193)\nIn the right panel of Figure 32, Z\u0304\u03c6,k=0 is depicted as a function of the temperature with different values of the baryon chemical potentials. The other is the case p = 0, and Equation (192) is reduced the equation as follows\n\u03b7\u03c6(0) = \u2212 1\n3Z\u03c6(0) \u03b4ij\n[ \u2202\n\u2202p2 \u2202t\u0393\n(2) \u03c0i\u03c0j\n]\np=0\n. (194)\nThe related wave function renormalization Z\u03c6,k(0) is used to extract the renormalized meson mass as\nm\u0304\u03c0 = m\u03c0,k=0\u221a Z\u03c6,k=0(0) , m\u0304\u03c3 = m\u03c3,k=0\u221a Z\u03c6,k=0(0) , (195)\nwhere m\u0304\u03c0 and m\u0304\u03c3 are approximately equal to their pole masses, respectively. The explicit expressions for Equation (194) and Equation (192) are presented in Equation (C2) and Equation (C3), respectively.\nFor the ghost anomalous dimension, one extracts it from the relation as follows\n\u03b7c =\u2212 p\u2202pZ\nQCD c,k=0(p)\nZQCDc,k=0(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p=k , (196)\nwhere ZQCDc,k=0(p) denotes the momentum-dependent ghost wave function renormalization in QCD with Nf = 2 flavors in the vacuum obtained in [61]. Note that the ghost propagator is found to be very insensitive to the effects of finite temperature as well as the quark contributions for Nf = 2 and Nf = 2 + 1 flavors, see e.g. [57].\nThe gluon anomalous dimension is decomposed into a sum of three parts, as follows\n\u03b7A =\u03b7 QCD A,vac + \u2206\u03b7 glue A + \u2206\u03b7 q A , (197)\nwhere the first term on the r.h.s. denotes the gluon anomalous dimension in the vacuum, and the other two terms stand for the medium contributions to the gluon anomalous dimension from the glue (gluons and ghosts) and quark loops, respectively. The vacuum contribution in Equation (197) is further expressed as\n\u03b7QCDA,vac = \u03b7 QCD A,vac \u2223\u2223\u2223 Nf=2 + \u03b7sA,vac , (198)\nwhere the two terms on the r.h.s. denote the contributions from the light quarks of Nf = 2 flavors and the strange quark. The former one is inferred from the gluon dressing function ZQCDA,k=0(p) for the Nf = 2 flavor QCD in [61], which reads\n\u03b7QCDA,vac \u2223\u2223\u2223 Nf=2 =\u2212 p\u2202pZ QCD A,k=0(p)\nZQCDA,k=0(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p=k . (199)\nThe explicit expressions of \u2206\u03b7qA in Equation (197) and \u03b7sA,vac in Equation (198) can be found in Equation (C4), Equation (C5), Equation (C6). Moreover, the in-medium contribution to the gluon anomalous dimension resulting from the glue sector, i.e., the second term on the r.h.s. of Equation (197), is taken into account in Equation (C7).\nIn Figure 33 the gluon dressing functions 1/ZA(p) of Nf = 2 and Nf = 2 + 1 flavor QCD in the vacuum are shown. The fRG and lattice results are presented. Here the fRG gluon dressing of Nf = 2 flavors is inputted from [61], as shown in Equation (199), which is also in quantitative agreement with the lattice result in [217]. Note that the gluon dressing of Nf = 2 + 1 flavors here is a genuine prediction, which is in good agreement with the respective lattice results [218, 219]. In Figure 34 both the gluon dressing function and the gluon propagator of Nf = 2 + 1 flavors are presented. The calculated gluon dressing functions at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential in fRG are shown in Figure 35. In the left panel of Figure 35 several different values of temperature are chosen with \u00b5B = 0, and it is found that the gluon dressing function 1/ZA decreases with the increase\nof temperature. In the right panel, several different values of \u00b5B are adopted while with T = 150 MeV fixed. It is observed that the dependence of the gluon dressing function on the baryon chemical potential is very small. The gluon dressing functions at finite temperature obtained in fRG are compared with the relevant lattice results from [221] in Figure 36, where several different values of temperature are chosen. One can see that the gluon dressing at finite temperature in fRG is comparable to that of lattice QCD."

However, when the momenta or the RG scale are decreased to k . 1 \u223c 3 GeV, the gluon mass gap begins to affect the running of strong couplings, and also the transversal strong couplings can not be identified with the longitudinal ones via the modified STIs, see, e.g., [56, 216, 223, 224] for more details. Consequently, different strong couplings deviate from one another in the low energy regime of k . 1 \u223c 3 GeV [56\u2013 58, 61], and thus it is necessary to distinguish them by adding appropriate suffixes. The couplings of the purely gluonic sector read\n\u03b1A3,k = 1\n4\u03c0 \u03bb2A3,k Z3A,k , \u03b1A4,k = 1 4\u03c0 \u03bbA4,k Z2A,k , (200)\n\u03b1c\u0304cA,k = 1\n4\u03c0 \u03bb2c\u0304cA,k ZA,k Z2c,k , (201)\nwhere \u03bbA3,k, \u03bbA4,k and \u03bbc\u0304cA,k denote the three-gluon, four-gluon, ghost-gluon dressing functions, respectively, as shown in Equation (A42), Equation (A48), Equation (A36).

From the calculated results in, e.g., [59, 61], it is reasonable to adopt the approximation as follows\n\u03b1A4,k = \u03b1A3,k , \u03b1c\u0304cA,k ' \u03b1l\u0304lA,k .

Here gq\u0304qA,k \u2261 \u03bbq\u0304qA,k is used. In Equation (205) the flow of quark-gluon vertex, i.e., the r.h.s. of the first line in Figure 37, is denoted by\n( Flow (3)\nq\u0304qA )a \u00b5 =\u2212 1 Z\n1/2 A,kZq,k\n( \u2202t\u0393 (3)q\u0304qA k )a \u00b5 , (206)\nwith\n( \u0393\n(3)q\u0304qA k )a \u00b5 \u2261 \u03b4 \u03b4Ac\u00b5 \u2212\u2192 \u03b4 \u03b4q\u0304 \u0393k \u2190\u2212 \u03b4 \u03b4q . (207)\nNote that besides the classical tensor structure of the quark-gluon vertex in Equation (204), some nonclassical tensor structures also play a sizable role in the dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry [58, 61, 225], see, e.g., [18] for more detailed discussions. From Equation (205) one formulates the flow of the light-quark\u2013gluon coupling as\n\u2202tg\u0304l\u0304lA,k =\n( 1\n2 \u03b7A + \u03b7q\n) g\u0304l\u0304lA,k + Flow (3),A (l\u0304lA) + Flow (3),\u03c6 (l\u0304lA) ,\n(208)\nwhere the second term on the r.h.s. corresponds to the two diagrams on the r.h.s. of the flow equation for the quark-gluon vertex as shown in the first line of Figure 37, and the last term to the last diagram, which arise from the quark-gluon, quark-meson fluctuations, respectively. For the strange-quark\u2013gluon coupling, one has\n\u2202tg\u0304s\u0304sA,k =\n( 1\n2 \u03b7A + \u03b7q\n) g\u0304s\u0304sA,k + Flow (3),A (s\u0304sA) , (209)\nwhere the contribution from the strange-quark\u2013meson interactions are neglected, that is reasonable due to relatively larger masses of the strange quark and strange mesons. The explicit expressions in Eqs. (208) and (209) can be found in Equation (C9) and Equation (C10).\nIn the same way, the flow equation of the three-gluon coupling, gA3,k \u2261 \u03bbA3,k, is readily obtained from the flow of the three-gluon vertex in the second line of Figure 37. The flow of the three-gluon coupling is decomposed into a sum of the vacuum part and the in-medium contribution, as follows\n\u2202tg\u0304A3,k =\u2202tg\u0304 vac A3,k + \u2202t\u2206g\u0304A3,k , (210)\nwhere the vacuum part, i.e., the first term on the r.h.s. is computed in [59], and the second term is identified with the in-medium contribution of the quark-gluon coupling, to wit,\n\u2202t\u2206g\u0304A3,k =\u2202t\u2206g\u0304l\u0304lA,k . (211)\nIn Figure 38 the light-quark\u2013gluon coupling, the strange-quark\u2013gluon coupling, and the three-gluon coupling are depicted as functions of the RG scale for several different values of the temperature. It is observed that different couplings are consistent with one another in the regime of k & 3 GeV, while deviations develop in the nonperturbative or even semiperturbative scale. Moreover, one can see that the strong couplings decrease with the increasing temperature.\n35"

It is more convenient to adopt the dimensionless, renormalized hadronization function and four-quark coupling\n\u02d9\u0303A = Z\n1/2 \u03c6,k\nZq,k k2A\u0307k , \u03bb\u0303q,k = k2\u03bbq,k Z2q,k , (213)\nand the renormalized Yukawa coupling,\nh\u0304k = hk\nZ 1/2 \u03c6,kZq,k\n. (214)\nInserting the effective action in Equation (48) into Equation (80) and performing a projection on the fourquark interaction in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0 channel, one is left with\n\u2202t\u03bb\u0303q,k =2(1 + \u03b7q,k)\u03bb\u0303q,k + Flow (4) (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 + \u02d9\u0303A h\u0304k , (215)\nwhere\nFlow (4) (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 \u2261\u2212 k2\nZ2q,k\n( \u2202t\u0393 (4) k,(q\u0304\u03c4q)2 ) A\u0307k=0 , (216)\nis the flow of the four-quark coupling in the \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0 channel, whose contributions have been depicted in Figure 39. One can see that the contributed diagrams can be classified into three sets, which correspond to the three lines on the r.h.s. of the flow equation in Figure 39. The first line is comprised of diagrams with two gluon exchanges, and the second line with two meson exchanges. The last\nline denotes the contributions from the mixed diagrams with one gluon exchange and one meson exchange. The mixed diagrams are negligible, since the dynamics of gluons and mesons dominate in different regimes of the RG scale, as shown in Figure 40. Therefore, the four-quark flow in Equation (216) can be further written as\nFlow (4) (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 =Flow (4),A (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 + Flow (4),\u03c6 (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 , (217)\nwhere the two terms on the r.h.s. correspond to the contributions from the two gluon exchanges and two meson exchanges, respectivley. Their explicit expressions are presented in Equation (C11) and Equation (C12). In Figure 40 the two terms on the r.h.s. of Equation (217) and their ratios with respect to the total flow of the fourquark coupling are depicted as functions of the RG scale with T = 0 and \u00b5B = 0. It is observed that the flow resulting from the gluon exchange is dominant in the region of high energy, while that from the meson exchange plays a significant role in lower energy.\nThe dynamical hadronization is done by demanding\n\u03bb\u0303q,k =0 , (218)\nfor every value of the RG scale k, which is equivalent to the fact that the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation is performed for every value of k. Thus from Equation (215) one arrives at the hadronization function as follows\n\u02d9\u0303A =\u2212 1 h\u0304k Flow (4) (q\u0304\u03c4q)2 . (219)\nInserting the effective action in Equation (48) into Equation (80) and performing a projection on the Yukawa interactions between quarks and \u03c3-\u03c0 mesons, i.e., q\u0304\u03c4 \u00b7 \u03c6q, one is led to\n\u2202th\u0304k =\n( 1\n2 \u03b7\u03c6,k + \u03b7q,k\n) h\u0304k + Flow (3)\n(q\u0304\u03c4q)\u03c0 \u2212 m\u03032\u03c0,k \u02d9\u0303A , (220)\nwith the dimensionless and renormalized pion mass as follows\nm\u03032\u03c0,k = m2\u03c0,k Z\u03c6,kk2 .

It is observed that with the increase of T or \u00b5B , the Yukawa coupling decays rapidly due to the restoration of the chiral symmetry. In the right panel of Figure 41 the dependence of the renormalized Yukawa coupling on the RG scale for different values of temperature is investigated. One can see that the Yukawa cou-\npling is stable in the region of k & 1 GeV, and the effects of temperature play a role approximately in k . 2\u03c0T . The effective four-quark coupling in the \u03c3-\u03c0 channel can be described by the ratio h\u03042k/(2m\u0304 2 \u03c0,k) [18, 59], which is shown as a function of the RG scale with several different values of temperature and \u00b5B = 0 in Figure 42. It is observed that with the decrease of k and entering the regime of the chiral symmetry breaking, a resonance occurs in the scalar-pseudoscalar channel, which results in a rapid increase of the effective four-quark coupling. Moreover, the dependence of the effective four-quark coupling\n37\non the baryon chemical potential is shown in Figure 43. One finds that the effective four-quark coupling decrease with the increasing temperature or baryon chemical potential."

In the right panel of Figure 46, the derivative of \u2206l,R with respect to the temperature, i.e., the thermal susceptibility of the renormalized light quark condensate, are shown. The peak position of the thermal susceptibility can be used to define the pseudocritcal temperature, which is found to be Tc = 156 MeV for \u00b5B = 0, in good agreement with the lattice result. In Figure 47 one shows the reduced condensate as a function of the temperature with \u00b5B = 0, in comparison to the lattice simulations.

            "text": "The QCD phase diagram in the plane of T and \u00b5B is shown in Figure 48. The first-principle fRG results in [18] are in comparison to state-of-the-art calculations of other functional approach, e.g., the Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE) [19, 20], and lattice QCD [8, 12]. The phase boundary in the regime of continuous crossover at small or medium \u00b5B shows the dependence of the pseudocritical temperature on the value of the baryon chemical\n39\npotential. In the calculations of fRG, this pseudocritical temperature is determined by the thermal susceptibility of the renormalized light quark chiral condensate, \u2202\u2206l,R/\u2202T , as discussed in Section IV E. Expanding the pseudocritical temperature around \u00b5B = 0, one arrives at\nTc(\u00b5B)\nTc = 1\u2212 \u03ba ( \u00b5B Tc )2 + \u03bb ( \u00b5B Tc )4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (234)\nwith Tc = Tc(\u00b5B = 0), where the quadratic expansion coefficient \u03ba is usually called as the curvature of the phase boundary. It is a sensitive measure for the QCD dynamics at finite temperature and densities. Therefore, it provides a benchmark test for functional approaches to make a comparison of the curvature at small baryon chemical potential with lattice simulations. The curvature values of the phase boundary obtained from fRG, DSE, and lattice QCD are summarized in the second line of Table III. It is found recent results of the curvature from state-of-the-art functional approaches, e.g., fRG [18], DSE [19, 20], have already been comparable to the lattice results. By contrast, those obtained from relatively former calculations of functional methods, e.g., [21, 232, 233], are significantly larger than the values of\nthe curvature obtained from lattice simulations.\nBesides the curvature of the phase boundary, another key ingredient of the QCD phase structure is the critical end point (CEP) of the first-order phase transition line at large baryon chemical potential, which is currently searched for with lots of efforts in experiments [22, 37\u201341, 43, 176]. Lattice simulations, however, are restricted in the region of \u00b5B/T . 2 \u223c 3 because of the sign problem at finite chemical potentials, and in this region no signal of CEP is observed [17]. Passing lattice benchmark tests at small baryon chemical potentials, functional approaches are able to provide relatively reliable estimates for the location of the CEP. The recent results of CEP after benchmark testing are presented in the third line of Table III, and also depicted in the phase diagram in Figure 48. Remarkably, estimates of CEP from fRG and DSE converge in a rather small region at baryon chemical potentials of about 600 MeV. Note that results of [20] in Table III are obtained without the dynamics of sigma and pion, and the relevant results are \u03ba = 0.0167 and (T, \u00b5B)CEP = (117, 600) MeV when they are included, and see also, e.g., [21, 232, 234] for related discussions. It should be reminded that errors of functional approaches increase significantly when \u00b5B/T & 4,\n40\nfor a detailed discussion see [18, 235], and thus one arrives at a more reasonable estimation for the location of CEP as 450 MeV . \u00b5BCEP . 650 MeV."

            "text": "At large baryon chemical potentials, it is found within the fRG approach to QCD, that the mesonic wave function renormalization in Equation (189) and Equation (190) develops negative values at small momenta [18]. As shown in Figure 49 the mesonic wave function renormalization at vanishing external momenta Z\u03c6,k=0(0) is depicted as a function of the temperature with several different values of \u00b5B . One can see a negative Z\u03c6,k=0(0) begins to appear for a temperature region when \u00b5B & 420 MeV. The negative regime is clearly shown in the right plot of \u2223\u22231/Z\u03c6,k=0(0) \u2223\u2223 between the two spikes, and it widens with the increase of the baryon chemical potential. From the two-point correlation functions of mesons as shown in Eqs. (189) and (190), the negative Z\u03c6,k=0(0) implies that, for the dispersion relations of mesons, there is a minimum at a finite p2 6= 0. This nontrivial behavior that the minimum of dispersion is located at a finite momentum is indicative of an inhomogeneous instability, for instance, the formation of a spatially modulated chiral condensate. However, it should be reminded that a negative Z\u03c6,k=0(0) is not bound to the formation of an inhomogeneous phase, it can also serve as an precursor for the inhomogeneous phase. See, e.g., [135, 137, 236\u2013245] for more related discussions. Most notably, very recently consequence of\nthe inhomogeneous instability indicated by the negative wave function renormalization on the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions has been studied. It is found that this inhomogeneous instability would result in a moat regime in both the particle pT spectrum and the two-particle correlation, where the peaks are located at nonzero momenta [244, 245]. The region of negative Z\u03c6,k=0(0) is shown in Figure 50 by the blue area, while the red hatched area shows where this region overlaps with a sizable chiral condensate."

Similar with the difference between the light quark condensate and the renormalized light quark condensate, the susceptibilities for them differ by the vacuum contribution. Among these three susceptibilities, the reduce susceptibility for the reduced condensate defined in fRG and lattice QCD, e.g., [13], matches better.\n41\nIn Figure 51 the susceptibility obtained from the reduced condensate as a function of the temperature for different pion masses in the fRG approach [62], is compared with the lattice results [13]. One can see that the fRG results are in good agreement with the lattice ones for pion masses m\u03c0 & 100 MeV. There are some slight deviations from the two approaches for small pion masses. From the dependence of the reduced susceptibility on the\ntemperature for a fixed pion mass in Figure 51, one is able to define the pseudocritical temperature for the chiral crossover at such value of pion mass, via the peak position of the curves, denoted by Tpc.\nIn Figure 52 one shows the dependence of the pseudocritical temperature on the pion mass, obtained both from the fRG approach and the lattice QCD. The values of pseudocritical temperature at finite pion masses are also extrapolated to the chiral limit, i.e., m\u03c0 \u2192 0, which leaves us with the critical temperature Tc in the chiral limit. One obtains T fRGc \u2248 142 MeV from the fRG approach [62], and T latticec = 132 +3 \u22126 MeV from the lattice QCD [13], that is, the critical temperature obtained in\n42\nfRG is a bit larger than the lattice result. Recently, the critical temperature in the chiral limit from DSE is found to be TDSEc \u2248 141 MeV [247].\nFrom the general scaling hypothesis, see e.g., [66], in the critical regime the pseudocritical temperature scales with the pion mass as\nTpc(m\u03c0) \u2248 Tc + cmp\u03c0 , (236)\nwhere c is a non-universal coefficient, while the exponent p is related to the critical exponents \u03b2 and \u03b4 through p = 2/(\u03b2\u03b4) [62]. Inputting the values of \u03b2 and \u03b4 for the 3-d O(4) universality class [197, 248, 249], one arrives at p \u2248 1.08. On the contrary, fitting of the fRG data in Figure 52 leads to p \u2248 0.91+0.03\u22120.03 [62]. This discrepancy indicates that the pion masses under investigation in [62], i.e., m\u03c0 & 30 MeV are beyond the critical regime. In fact, the critical regime is found to be extremely small, m\u03c0 . 1 MeV, in fRG studies of LEFTs, and see, e.g., [98, 151, 190, 199] for a more detailed discussion."

The Schwinger-Keldysh path integral is devised to study real-time quantum dynamics [250, 251], which has been proved be very powerful to cope with problems of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium many-body systems, see, e.g., [252\u2013255] for relevant reviews.\nWithin the fRG approach on the closed time path, nonthermal fixed points of the O(N) scalar theory are investigated [256, 257]. The transition from unitary to\ndissipative dynamics is studied [258]. Spectral functions in a scalar field theory with d=0+1 dimensions are computed within the real-time fRG approach [259]. Moreover, it has also been employed to study the nonequilibrium transport, dynamical critical behavior, etc. in open quantum systems [260, 261], see also [55, 255] for related reviews. Recently, the real-time fRG is compared with other real-time methods [262].\nFurthermore, it should be mentioned that another conceptually new fRG with the Keldysh functional integral is put forward in [263\u2013266], and the regulation of the RG scale there is replaced with that of the time, which is also called as the temporal renormalization group. Noteworthily, recently the Ka\u0308lle\u0301n-Lehmann spectral representation of correlation functions has been used in the approach of DSE, to study the spectral functions in the \u03c64-theory and Yang-Mills theory [267\u2013269]. The spectral functions provide important informations on the timelike properties of correlation functions, see, e.g., [270\u2013 273]. Besides the real-time fRG, another commonly adopted approach is the analytically continued functional renormalization group, where the Euclidean flow equations are analytically continued into the Minkowski spacetime on the level of analytic expressions with some specific truncations, and see, e.g., [112, 129, 274\u2013276] for more details.\nIn this section we would like to discuss the fRG formulated on the Keldysh path at the example of the O(N) scalar theory [277]."

In thermal equilibrium at a temperature T , the Pk matrix reads\nPk = (\n0 PAk PRk PKk\n) , (270)\nwhere the inverse retarded propagator is given by\nPRk = (PR\u03c3,k 0\n0 PR\u03c0,k\n) , (271)\nwith\nPR\u03c3,k =Z\u03c6,k [ q20 \u2212 q2 ( 1 + rB (q2 k2 ))] \u2212m2\u03c3,k\n+ sgn(q0)i , (272)\n( PR\u03c0,k ) ij = { Z\u03c6,k [ q20 \u2212 q2 ( 1 + rB (q2 k2 ))] \u2212m2\u03c0,k\n+ sgn(q0)i } \u03b4ij . (273)\nThe inverse advanced propagator is related to the retarded one through a complex conjugate, to wit,\nPAk =(PRk )\u2217 . (274)\nThe qq component of the inverse propagator in Equation (270), i.e., PKk , reads\nPKk = (PK\u03c3,k 0\n0 PK\u03c0,k\n) , (275)\nwith\nPK\u03c3,k =2i sgn(q0) coth ( q0\n2T\n) , (276)\n( PK\u03c0,k ) ij = [ 2i sgn(q0) coth ( q0 2T )] \u03b4ij . (277)\nThen, one can obtain the propagator matrix as follows\nGk = ( Pk )\u22121 =\n( GKk G R k\nGAk 0\n) , (278)\nwith the retarded and advanced propagator being\nGRk =(PRk )\u22121 , GAk = (PAk )\u22121 , (279)\n45\nand the correlation function or Keldysh propagator being\nGKk =\u2212 (PRk )\u22121PKk (PAk )\u22121 = \u2212GRk PKk GAk . (280)\nFinally, one can verify the fluctuation-dissipation relation in thermal equilibrium, as follows\nGKk = ( GRk \u2212GAk ) coth ( q0 2T ) . (281)\nFrom Equation (278) one arrives at the three different propagators which read\niGR\u03c6,k =\u3008Tp\u03c6c(x)\u03c6q(y)\u3009 , iGA\u03c6,k = \u3008Tp\u03c6q(x)\u03c6c(y)\u3009 , (282)\niGK\u03c6,k =\u3008Tp\u03c6c(x)\u03c6c(y)\u3009 = ( iGR\u03c6,k )( iPK\u03c6,k )( iGA\u03c6,k ) ,\n(283)\nwhere Tp denotes the time ordering from the positive to negative time branch in the Keldysh closed time path, and Equation (283) follows directly from Equation (280).

(307)\nThus, the spectral function is proportional to the imaginary part of the retarded propagator, i.e.,\n\u03c1(p0, |p|) =\u2212 2=GR(p0, |p|) . (308)\nNotice that here the IR limit k \u2192 0 is tacitly assumed. The retarded propagator is just the inverse of the twopoint correlation function, to wit,\nGR(p0, |p|) = [ \u0393 (2) \u03c6q\u03c6c (p0, |p|) ]\u22121 . (309)\nConsequently, the spectral function can be expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the two-point correlation function, that is,\n\u03c1(p0, |p|) = 2=\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0, |p|)[\n<\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0, |p|) ]2 + [ =\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0, |p|) ]2 .\n(310)\nEvidently, one has\n\u03c1(\u2212p0, |p|) =\u2212 \u03c1(p0, |p|) . (311)\nIn Figure 56, the spectral function \u03c1(p0, |p| = 0) is shown as a function of p0 with different values of the temperature. In the left panel, the temperatures are above but close to the critical temperature Tc = 20.4 MeV for the phase transition, where the symmetry is broken from O(N) to O(N\u22121) when T < Tc, while in the right panel, the temperatures are far larger than Tc. One can see that when temperature is large, one has a negative spectral function in the regime of small p0, and there is a minus peak structure around the pole mass. It is found that the negative spectral function results from the contributions of the Landau damping, and see [277] for a more detailed discussion. Nonetheless, when the temperature is decreased below about 60 MeV, the Landau damping is dominated by the process of creation and annihilation of particles, and the spectral function is positive. Moreover, when the temperature is more and more close to the critical temperature, the peak structure on the spectral function becomes more and more wider, and finally disappears at the critical temperature. The 3D plots of the spectral function as a function of p0 and |p| are shown in Figure 57 with two different values of the temperature.\nWe proceed to the discussion of the dynamical critical exponent, and begin with the kinetic coefficient \u0393(|p|) that is defined as\n1 \u0393(|p|) =\u2212 i \u2202\u0393\n(2) \u03c6q\u03c6c (p0, |p|) \u2202p0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p0=0\n= \u2202=\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0, |p|)\n\u2202p0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 p0=0 , (312)\nwhere the parity properties of the real and imaginary parts of the two-point correlation function have been used, i.e.,\n<\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(\u2212p0, |p|) =<\u0393 (2) \u03c6q\u03c6c (p0, |p|) , (313)\n=\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(\u2212p0, |p|) =\u2212=\u0393 (2) \u03c6q\u03c6c (p0, |p|) . (314)\nThe relaxation rate, or dissipative characteristic frequency, is given by\n\u03c9(|p|) =\u0393(|p|) ( \u2212\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0 = 0, |p|) )\n=\u2212 \u0393(|p|)<\u0393(2)\u03c6q\u03c6c(p0 = 0, |p|) . (315)\nWhen the momentum is larger than the correlation length |p| > \u03be\u22121, with \u03be \u223c m\u22121\u03c6 , the relaxation rate scales as\n\u03c9(|p|) \u221d|p|z , (316)\nthrough which one can extract the dynamical critical exponent z [278]. From Figure 58 the value of the dynamical critical exponent in the real-time 3d O(4) scalar theory is extracted, and one arrives at z = 2.02284(6), where the numerical error is shown in the bracket.\n48\nAccording to the standard classification for universalities of the critical dynamics [278], it is argued that the critical dynamics of the relativistic O(4) scalar theory belongs to the universality of Model G [279], see also [280], which leaves us with z = 3/2 in three dimensions. The dynamic critical exponent for the O(4) model is also calculated in real-time classical-statistical lattice simulations, and it is found that z is in favor of 2, but there is still a sizable numerical error [280]. The dynamic critical exponent in a relativistic O(N) vector model is also found to be close to 2 [258]. Similar result is found in a O(3) model in [281]. Moreover, z = 1.92(11) is found for Model A in three spatial dimensions from real-time classical-statistical lattice simulations [282]. In short, the dynamic critical exponent is far from clear and conclusive in comparison to the static critical exponent, and more studies of the critical dynamics from different ap-\nproaches, including the real-time fRG, are necessary and desirable in the future."

            "text": "In this paper we present an overview on recent progress in studies of QCD at finite temperature and densities within the fRG approach. After a brief introduction of the formalism, the fRG approach is applied in low energy effective field theories (LEFTs) and the first-principle QCD. The mechanism of quark mass production and natural emergence of bound states is well illustrated within the fRG approach, and a set of self-consistent flow equations of different correlation functions provide the necessary resummations, and plays the same role as the quark gap equation and Bethe-Salpeter equation of\n49\nbound states.\nWe present results for the QCD phase structure and the location of the critical end point (CEP), the QCD equation of state (EoS), the magnetic EoS, baryon number fluctuations confronted with recent experimental measurements, various critical exponents, etc. It is found that the non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis of the net-baryon or net-proton (proxy for netbaryon in experiments) number distributions could arise from the increasingly sharp crossover with the decrease of the beam collision energy, which in turn indicates that the non-monotonicity observed in experiments is highly non-trivial. Furthermore, recent estimates of the location of the CEP from first-principle QCD calculations within fRG and Dyson-Schwinger Equations, which passes through lattice benchmark tests at small baryon chemical potentials, converge in a rather small region at baryon chemical potentials of about 600 MeV. But it should be reminded that errors of functional approaches increase significantly in the regime of \u00b5B/T & 4, and thus one arrives at a more reasonable estimation for the location of CEP as 450 MeV . \u00b5BCEP . 650 MeV. Moreover, a region of inhomogeneous instability indicated by a negative wave function renormalization is found with \u00b5B & 420 MeV, and its consequence on the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions has been investigated very recently [244, 245]. It is found that this inhomogeneous instability would result in a moat regime in both the particle pT spectrum and the two-particle correlation. By investigating the critical behavior and extracting critical exponents in the vicinity of the CEP, it is found that the size of the critical region is extremely small, quite smaller than \u223c 1 MeV.\nIn this review we also discuss the real-time fRG,\nin which the flow equations are formulated on the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path. By organizing the effective action and the flow equations in terms of the \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cquantum\u201d fields, one is able to give a concise diagrammatic representation for the flow equations of propagators and vertices in the real-time fRG. The spectral functions of the O(N) scalar theory in the critical regime in the proximity of the critical temperature are obtained.

Gluon propagator\nThe kinetic term for the gluon field in Equation (48) in momentum space is given by\n\u0393k,2A \u2261 1\n2\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 Aa\u00b5(\u2212q)q2\n[( ZMA,k(q)\u03a0 M \u00b5\u03bd(q)\n+ ZEA,k(q)\u03a0 E \u00b5\u03bd(q)\n) + 1\n\u03be \u03a0\u2016\u00b5\u03bd(q)\n] Aa\u03bd(q) , (A1)\nwhere the magnetic projection operator reads\n\u03a0M\u00b5\u03bd(q) =(1\u2212 \u03b4\u00b50)(1\u2212 \u03b4\u03bd0) ( \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd \u2212\nq\u00b5q\u03bd q2\n) , (A2)\nand the electric projection operator\n\u03a0E\u00b5\u03bd(q) =\u03a0 \u22a5 \u00b5\u03bd(q)\u2212\u03a0M\u00b5\u03bd(q) , (A3)\nwith the transverse and longitudinal tensors given by\n\u03a0\u22a5\u00b5\u03bd(q) =\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 q\u00b5q\u03bd q2 , and \u03a0\u2016\u00b5\u03bd(q) = q\u00b5q\u03bd q2 , (A4)\nrespectively. Note that in Equation (A1) different magnetic and electric gluonic dressing functions, i.e., ZMA,k(q) 6= ZEA,k(q), are assumed at finite temperature. Differentiating Equation (A1) w.r.t. the gluon field twice, one obtains\n( \u0393\n(2)AA k,2A )ab \u00b5\u03bd (q\u2032, q) \u2261 \u03b4 2\u0393k,2A\n\u03b4Aa\u00b5(q \u2032)\u03b4Ab\u03bd(q)\n=q2 [( ZMA,k(q)\u03a0 M \u00b5\u03bd(q) + Z E A,k(q)\u03a0 E \u00b5\u03bd(q) ) + 1\n\u03be \u03a0\u2016\u00b5\u03bd(q)\n]\n\u00d7 \u03b4ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) . (A5)\nMoreover, the regulator for the gluon reads\n( RAAk )ab \u00b5\u03bd (q\u2032, q)\n= [( ZMA,kq 2rB(q 2/k2)\u03a0M\u00b5\u03bd(q) + Z E A,kq 2rB(q 2/k2)\u03a0E\u00b5\u03bd(q) )\n+ 1\n\u03be q2rB(q\n2/k2)\u03a0\u2016\u00b5\u03bd(q) ] \u03b4ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) , (A6)\nwhere ZMA,k and Z E A,k are independent of momentum q by contrast to those in Equation (A5). The threshold function rB(x) can be chosen to be that in Equation (10) or Equation (12). Therefore, the gluon propagator is readily obtained from Equation (21), as follows\n( GAAk )ab \u00b5\u03bd (q, q\u2032) = (2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) ( GAAk )ab \u00b5\u03bd (q) , (A7)\nwith\n( GAAk )ab \u00b5\u03bd (q) = ( GMA,k(q)\u03a0 M \u00b5\u03bd(q) +G E A,k(q)\u03a0 E \u00b5\u03bd(q) ) \u03b4ab ,\n(A8)\nwhere one has\nGMA,k(q) = 1\nq2 [ ZMA,k(q) + Z M A,krB(q 2/k2) ] , (A9)\nGEA,k(q) = 1\nq2 [ ZEA,k(q) + Z E A,krB(q 2/k2) ] . (A10)\nHere the gauge parameter is chosen to be \u03be = 0.\nb. Ghost propagator\nIn the same way the kinetic term for the ghost field in Equation (48) reads\n\u0393k,2c \u2261 \u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 Zc,k(q)c\u0304\na(\u2212q)q2ca(q) , (A11)\nwhere we have used the convention of Fourier transformation for the Grassmann fields as follows\nc\u0304a(x) =\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 c\u0304a(q)eiqx , (A12)\nca(x) =\n\u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 ca(q)eiqx . (A13)\nThen, it follows that\n( \u0393\n(2)c\u0304c k,2c\n)ab (q\u2032, q) \u2261\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b4\n\u03b4c\u0304a(q\u2032) \u0393k,2c\n\u2190\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03b4cb(q)\n=Zc,k(q)q 2\u03b4ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) , (A14)\nand\n( \u0393\n(2)cc\u0304 k,2c\n)ab (q\u2032, q) \u2261\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b4\n\u03b4ca(q\u2032) \u0393k,2c\n\u2190\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03b4c\u0304b(q)\n=\u2212 Zc,k(q\u2032)q\u20322\u03b4ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q)\n=\u2212 ( \u0393\n(2)c\u0304c k,2c\n)ba (q, q\u2032) = \u2212 [( \u0393\n(2)c\u0304c k,2c\n)T ]ab (q\u2032, q) , (A15)\nNote that, for a Grassmann field, the relation such as\n\u0393 (2)cc\u0304 k,2c = \u2212\n( \u0393\n(2)c\u0304c k,2c\n)T , (A16)\nalways holds. The regulator for the ghost field reads\n( Rc\u0304ck )ab (q\u2032, q) = Zc,kq 2rB(q 2/k2)\u03b4ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) ,\n(A17)\nand Rcc\u0304k = \u2212 ( Rc\u0304ck )T\n. As a consequence, the P matrix in Equation (58) for the ghost field reads\nPc = (\n0 \u2212(\u0393(2)c\u0304ck,2c +Rc\u0304ck )T \u0393\n(2)c\u0304c k,2c +R c\u0304c k 0\n) , (A18)\n51\nwhose inverse matrix is just the ghost propagator which is given by\n( 1\nP\n)\nc\n=\n( 0 Gcc\u0304k\n\u2212(Gcc\u0304k )T 0\n) , (A19)\nwith\nGcc\u0304k = 1\n\u0393 (2)c\u0304c k,2c +R c\u0304c k\n. (A20)\nRecovering the indices, one obtains the ghost propagator as follows\n( Gcc\u0304k )ab (q, q\u2032) = ( Gcc\u0304k )ab (q)(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q + q\u2032)\n= Gck(q)\u03b4 ab(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q + q\u2032) , (A21)\nwith\nGck(q) = 1\nq2 [ Zc,k(q) + Zc,krB(q2/k2) ] . (A22)\nc. Quark propagator\nThe kinetic term for the quark field in Equation (48) reads\n\u0393k,2q \u2261 \u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 q\u0304(\u2212q)\n[ Zq,k(q)i\u03b3 \u00b7 q +mq,k(q) ] q(q) .\n(A23)\nIt follows that\n( \u0393\n(2)q\u0304q k,2q ) ij (q\u2032, q) =\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b4\n\u03b4q\u0304i(q\u2032) \u0393k,2q\n\u2190\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03b4qj(q)\n= [ Zq,k(q)iq\u00b5(\u03b3\u00b5)ij +mq,k(q)\u03b4ij ] (2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) ,\n(A24)\nand\n( \u0393\n(2)qq\u0304 k,2q ) ij (q\u2032, q) =\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b4\n\u03b4qi(q\u2032) \u0393k,2q\n\u2190\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03b4q\u0304j(q)\n=\u2212 [ Zq,k(q \u2032)iq\u2032\u00b5(\u03b3\u00b5)ji +mq,k(q \u2032)\u03b4ji ] (2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q + q\u2032)\n= \u2212 [( Zq,k(q \u2032)iq\u2032\u00b5\u03b3\u00b5 +mq,k(q \u2032) )T ]\nij (2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q + q\u2032)\n= \u2212 [(\n\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k,2q )T ] ij (q\u2032, q) . (A25)\nThe regulator reads\n( Rq\u0304qk ) ij\n(q\u2032, q) = Zq,kiq \u00b7 \u03b3ijrF (q2/k2)(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q\u2032 + q) . (A26)\nThe P matrix for the quark field reads\nPq = (\n0 \u2212(\u0393(2)q\u0304qk,2q +R q\u0304q k ) T\n\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k,2q +R q\u0304q k 0\n) , (A27)\nand the relevant propagator is given by\n( 1\nP\n)\nq\n=\n( 0 Gqq\u0304k\n\u2212(Gqq\u0304k )T 0\n) , (A28)\nwith\nGqq\u0304k = 1\n\u0393 (2)q\u0304q k,2q +R q\u0304q k\n. (A29)\nDisplaying the momentum explicitly, one arrives at the quark propagator as follows\nGqq\u0304k (q, q \u2032) = Gqq\u0304k (q)(2\u03c0) 4\u03b44(q + q\u2032)\n= Gqk(q)(2\u03c0) 4\u03b44(q + q\u2032) , (A30)\nwith\nGqk(q) = 1\nZq,k(q)i\u03b3 \u00b7 q + Zq,krF (q2/k2)i\u03b3 \u00b7 q +mq,k(q) .\n(A31)\nd. Ghost-gluon vertex\nFirst of all, we consider the case in the vacuum. The action relevant to the ghost-gluon interaction in Equation (48) reads\n\u0393k,2cA \u2261 \u222b\nx\n(\u2212g)fabc\u2202\u00b5c\u0304a(x)cb(x)Ac\u00b5(x)\n=\n\u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 d4q (2\u03c0)4 (\u2212g)fabcip\u00b5c\u0304a(p)cb(q)Ac\u00b5(\u2212p\u2212 q) ,\n(A32)\nwhich yields\n( \u0393\n(3)c\u0304cA k,2cA )abc \u00b5\n(p, q, k) \u2261 \u03b4 \u03b4Ac\u00b5(k)\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b4\n\u03b4c\u0304a(p) \u0393k,2cA\n\u2190\u2212 \u03b4\n\u03b4cb(q)\n=\u2212 gfabcip\u00b5(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(p+ q + k) . (A33)\nThus, the Feynman rule for the ghost-gluon vertex in the vacuum is given as follows\nq \u0580\n\u0581 p\n\u2190\u2212 k\nb\na\nc,\u00b5 \u2261 \u2212 ( \u0393\n(3)c\u0304cA k,2cA )abc \u00b5 (p, q, k)\n=\u2212 g ( S\n(3) c\u0304cA )abc \u00b5 (p, q, k) . (A34)\n52\nwith the classical tensor of the ghost-gluon vertex defined by\n( S\n(3) c\u0304cA )abc \u00b5 (p, q, k) \u2261 \u2212ip\u00b5fabc , (A35)\nAt finite temperature, the external leg of gluon would be split into the magnetic and electric sectors, and thus the general form for the ghost-gluon vertex at finite temperature reads\nq \u0580\n\u0581 p\n\u2190\u2212 k\nb\na\nc,\u00b5 = \u2212 ( S\n(3) c\u0304cA )abc \u00b5\u2032 (p, q, k) ( \u03bbc\u0304cA ) \u00b5\u2032\u00b5 (k) .\n(A36)\nwith\n( \u03bbc\u0304cA ) \u00b5\u2032\u00b5 (k) \u2261 \u03bbMc\u0304cA\u03a0M\u00b5\u2032\u00b5(k) + \u03bbEc\u0304cA\u03a0E\u00b5\u2032\u00b5(k) , (A37)\nwhere \u03bbMc\u0304cA and \u03bb E c\u0304cA are the dressing couplings of the ghost-gluon vertex for the magnetic and electric components, respectively. Note that the couplings are dependent on the RG scale, and their subscript k has been suppressed.\ne. Three- and four-gluon vertices\nFrom the effective action in Equation (48), one is able to obtain the three-gluon vertex in the vacuum, as follows\n( \u0393 (3)A3\nk\n)a1a2a3 \u00b51\u00b52\u00b53 (q1, q2, q3)\n\u2261 \u03b4 3\u0393k\n\u03b4Aa1\u00b51(q1)\u03b4A a2 \u00b52(q2)\u03b4A a3 \u00b53(q3) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 A=0\n=(2\u03c0)4\u03b44(q1 + q2 + q3)g ( S (3) A3 )a1a2a3 \u00b51\u00b52\u00b53 (q1, q2, q3) , (A38)\nwith the classical three-gluon tensor\n( S\n(3) A3 )a1a2a3 \u00b51\u00b52\u00b53 (q1, q2, q3)\n\u2261\u2212 ifa1a2a3 [ \u03b4\u00b51\u00b52(q1 \u2212 q2)\u00b53 + \u03b4\u00b52\u00b53(q2 \u2212 q3)\u00b51\n+ \u03b4\u00b53\u00b51(q3 \u2212 q1)\u00b52 ] .

The external momentum is chosen to be |p| = k.\nThe contribution to the gluon anomalous dimension from the quark loop reads\n\u03b7qA = \u2212 Nf \u03c02 g2q\u0304Aq,k\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx [ (1\u2212 \u03b7q,k) \u221a x+ \u03b7q,kx ]\n\u00d7 \u222b 1\n\u22121 d cos \u03b8\n[( FF (1,1)(m\u03032q,k, m\u03032q,k)\n\u2212FF (2,1)(m\u03032q,k, m\u03032q,k) ) + (\u221a x cos2\u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 ) \u00d7 ( 1 + rF (x \u2032) )( FF (2,1)(m\u03032q,k, m\u03032q,k)\n\u2212 1 2 FF (1,1)(m\u03032q,k, m\u03032q,k)\n)] . (C4)\nAs same as in Equation (C3), the external momentum in Equation (C4) is chosen to be |p| = k. The in-medium\n59\ncontribution from the light quarks, included in Equation (197), is given by\n\u2206\u03b7qA = \u03b7 q A \u2212 \u03b7qA \u2223\u2223 T,\u00b5=0 , (C5)\nwith m\u0304q = m\u0304l, Nf = 2 and the light-quark\u2013gluon coupling, gl\u0304Al in Equation (C4). For the strange quark, since the vacuum contribution is also presented in Equation (198), one needs\n\u03b7sA = \u03b7 s A,vac + \u2206\u03b7 s A , (C6)\nwhich is obtained from Equation (C4) with m\u0304q = m\u0304s, Nf = 1 and the strange-quark\u2013gluon coupling gs\u0304As.\nThe second term on the r.h.s. of Equation (197), \u2206\u03b7glueA , denotes the contribution to the gluon anomalous dimension from the thermal part of glue sector, which is taken into account through the thermal screening mass of gluons. The modified gluon anomalous dimension reads\n\u03b7\u0304A =\u03b7A + \u2206m2scr(k, T )\nZ\u0304Ak2 (2\u2212 \u03b7A)\n\u2212 1 Z\u0304Ak2\n\u2202t ( \u2206m2scr(k, T ) ) . (C7)\nwith \u03b7\u0304A = \u2212\u2202tZ\u0304A/Z\u0304A, where \u03b7A is the gluon anomalous dimension without the thermal screening mass, and see [18] for a more detailed discussion. The screening mass reads\n\u2206m2scr(k, T ) = (c T ) 2 exp [ \u2212 ( k \u03c0T )n] . (C8)\nwhere c = 2 is adopted for Nf = 2+1, which is consistent with the result in [57]. Furthermore, n = 2 is chosen in Equation (C8).\nThe flow of the quark-gluon couplings in Equation (208) and Equation (209) are given by\nFlow (3),A (q\u0304qA) = 3\n8\u03c02Nc g\u03043q\u0304qA,km\u0303 2 q,k\n{ 2\n15 (5\u2212 \u03b7A,k)FB(2,2)(m\u03032q,k, 0)\n+ 1\n3 (4\u2212 \u03b7q,k)FB(3,1)(m\u03032q,k, 0)\n}\n+ 3Nc 8\u03c02 g\u03042q\u0304qA,kg\u0304A3,k\n{ 1\n20 (5\u2212 \u03b7q,k)FB(1,2)(m\u03032q,k, 0)\n\u2212 1 6 (4\u2212 \u03b7q,k)FB(2,1)(m\u03032q,k, 0) + 1 30 (5\u2212 2\u03b7q,k)\n\u00d7FB(2,2)(m\u03032q,k, 0)\u2212 4\n15 (5\u2212 \u03b7A,k)\n\u00d7FB(1,2)(m\u03032q,k, 0) + 1\n30 (10\u2212 3\u03b7A,k)\n\u00d7FB(1,3)(m\u03032q,k, 0) } .
