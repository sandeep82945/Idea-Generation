 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Apply the techniques to other command-line interfaces and APIs beyond PowerShell to demonstrate broader applicability. The paper mentions this could work for other CLIs.

2. Explore using different machine learning models like recurrent neural networks that can better capture word order and context. The paper mainly looked at logistic regression, AdaBoost trees, and basic neural networks.

3. Investigate more advanced natural language processing techniques like named entity recognition to identify different types of sensitive information beyond just detecting its presence. 

4. Evaluate the real-world performance of the approach by deploying it in a production Sovereign Cloud environment to redact sensitive data from PowerShell commands.

5. Expand the problem formulation from binary classification of sensitive/non-sensitive to multi-class classification of different types of sensitive data like passwords, API keys, etc. The paper suggests this as a direction for future work.
