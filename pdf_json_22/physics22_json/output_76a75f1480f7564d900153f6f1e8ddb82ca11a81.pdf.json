    "abstractText": "A rich variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors is an important unsolved problem in strongly correlated electron systems. A unified understanding of these orders has been investigated for the last decade. In this study, we explain the B1g symmetry nematic transition in FeSe1\u2212xTex, the B2g symmetry nematicity in AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb), and the smectic state in BaFe2As2 based on the same framework. We investigate the quantum interference mechanism between spin fluctuations by developing the density wave equation. The observed rich variety of nematic/smectic orders is naturally understood in this mechanism. The nematic/smectic orders depend on the characteristic shape and topology of the Fermi surface (FS) of each compound. 1) In FeSe1\u2212xTex (nd = 6.0), each FS is very small and the dxy-orbital hole pocket is below the Fermi level. In this case, the small spin fluctuations on three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively lead to the B1g nematic (q = 0) order without magnetization. The experimental Lifshitz transition below the nematic transition temperature (TS) is naturally reproduced. 2) In BaFe2As2 (nd = 6.0), the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges around the M point, and each FS is relatively large. The strong spin fluctuations due to the dxy-orbital nesting give rise to the B1g nematic (q = 0) order and the smectic [q = (0, \u03c0)] order, and the latter transition temperature (T* ~ 170K) exceeds the former one (TS ~ 140K). 3) In heavily hole-doped AFe2As2 (nd = 5.5), the large dxy-orbital hole pocket and the four tiny Dirac pockets appear due to the hole-doping. The B2g nematic bond order emerges on the dxy-orbital hole pocket because of the same interference mechanism. The present paramagnon interference mechanism provides a unified explanation of why the variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors is so rich, based on the well-established fermiology of Fe-based superconductors.",

A unified understanding of these orders has been investigated for the last decade. In this study, we explain the B1g symmetry nematic transition in FeSe1\u2212xTex, the B2g symmetry nematicity in AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb), and the smectic state in BaFe2As2 based on the same framework. We investigate the quantum interference mechanism between spin fluctuations by developing the density wave equation. The observed rich variety of nematic/smectic orders is naturally understood in this mechanism. The nematic/smectic orders depend on the characteristic shape and topology of the Fermi surface (FS) of each compound. 1) In FeSe1\u2212xTex (nd = 6.0), each FS is very small and the dxy-orbital hole pocket is below the Fermi level. In this case, the small spin fluctuations on three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively lead to the B1g nematic (q = 0) order without magnetization. The experimental Lifshitz transition below the nematic transition temperature (TS) is naturally reproduced. 2) In BaFe2As2 (nd = 6.0), the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges around the M point, and each FS is relatively large. The strong spin fluctuations due to the dxy-orbital nesting give rise to the B1g nematic (q = 0) order and the smectic [q = (0, \u03c0)] order, and the latter transition temperature (T* ~ 170K) exceeds the former one (TS ~ 140K). 3) In heavily hole-doped AFe2As2 (nd = 5.5), the large dxy-orbital hole pocket and the four tiny Dirac pockets appear due to the hole-doping. The B2g nematic bond order emerges on the dxy-orbital hole pocket because of the same interference mechanism. The present paramagnon interference mechanism provides a unified explanation of why the variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors is so rich, based on the well-established fermiology of Fe-based superconductors.\nKeywords: nematic order, smectic order, orbital order, bond order, quantum critical point, iron-based superconductors\nEdited by: Laura Fanfarillo,\nInternational School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Italy\nReviewed by: Avraham Klein,\nAriel University, Israel Samuel Lederer,\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, United States\n*Correspondence: Seiichiro Onari\nonari@s.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Condensed Matter Physics,\na section of the journal Frontiers in Physics\nReceived: 08 April 2022 Accepted: 14 June 2022 Published: 19 July 2022\nCitation: Onari S and Kontani H (2022) Diverse Exotic Orders and Fermiology in FeBased Superconductors: A Unified\nMechanism for B1g/B2g Nematicity in FeSe/(Cs,Rb)Fe2As2 and Smectic\nOrder in BaFe2As2.

            "text": "The emergence of an electron nematic (q = 0) state is one of the most important unsolved problems in Fe-based superconductors [1]. In LaFeAsO and Ba122 compounds, the antiferro (AF) magnetic state appears at the N\u00e9el temperature TN, which is lower than the nematic transition temperature TS. Since the superconducting phase with a high transition temperature (Tc) appears near the nematic phase and the AF magnetic phase, it is expected that the nematic fluctuations and the spin fluctuations are related to the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. However, the questions appear before discussing the superconductivity: 1) what is the order parameter of the nematic state? 2) What is the driving force of the nematic state? 3) Why do the diverse nematic states emerge in various compounds?\nIt is known that the nematic order cannot be derived from the mean-field theory since the spin-channel order always dominates over the nematic order unless unphysical parameters (such as negative Hund\u2019s coupling) are assumed. Previously, to explain the nematic state [2], the vestigial order (spin nematic) scenario [3\u20139] and the orbital order scenario [10\u201322] have been proposed.\nTo investigate the nematic state, the FeSe family is an ideal platform since the AF magnetic state is absent [23\u201326]. This family is also ideal from the aspect of superconductivity since the highest Tc \u2273 65K in Fe-based superconductors has been reported in electron-doped FeSe [27\u201331]. In FeSe, the orbital polarization between dxz and dyz orbitals in the nematic state has been observed by angle-resolved-photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [32\u201336]. To be more precise, the orbital polarization\nenergy Exz \u2212 Eyz has k dependence and changes the sign between the \u0393 point and the X (Y) point. This sign reversal orbital polarization has been explained by the orbital order scenario [16, 17, 19, 20] based on the paramagnon interference mechanism and by the renormalization group (RG) theory [37, 38]. In both theories, the vertex correction (VC) of the Coulomb interaction, which corresponds to the higher-order many-body effect, plays an essential role. Since the AF magnetic correlation is weak in FeSe, it is difficult to explain the nematic state by the vestigial order (spin nematic) scenario. Based on the paramagnon interference mechanism, the B1g nematic orders in LaFeAsO and FeSe [14\u201318] and the nematic orders in cuprate superconductors [39\u201341] and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene [42] have been explained as the orbital/bond orders. CDW orders in the transition metal dichalcogenide [43] and kagome metal [44] have also been explained by the paramagnon interference mechanism.\nThe rich variety of nematicity in the FeSe family remains a significant open problem. In FeSe1\u2212xSx, TS disappears at x ~ 0.17, where the emergence of the nematic quantum critical point (QCP) has been suggested by experiments [45\u201348]. Recently, the whole x dependent phase diagram for FeSe1\u2212xTex (x \u2272 0.6) has been reported [49\u201351]. In the phase diagram shown in Figure 1A, TS decreases with Te doping x, and TS disappears at x ~ 0.5. Tc becomes maximum ~ 15K at x ~ 0.6, which indicates that the nematic fluctuations enlarge the superconducting pairing interaction near the nematic QCP. Thus, it is essential to clarify the mechanism of x dependence of TS to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in the FeSe family.\nFIGURE 1 | (A) Schematic x-T phase diagram of FeSe1\u2212xTex, where TS decreases with x, and Tc becomes maximum near the nematic QCP. (B) Schematic x-T phase diagram of BaFe2(As1\u2212xPx)2, where tiny nematicity appears for TS < T < T*.

An actual bulk nematic transition at T = T* has been reported in many experimental studies, such as a magnetic torque study [52], an X-ray study [53], an optical measurement study [54], and a laser photoemission electron microscope (PEEM) study [55]. Since the orthorhombicity (a \u2212 b)/(a + b) \u226a 0.1% below T* is tiny, an extrinsic origin such as inhomogeneity of the nematic transition temperature TS due to local uniaxial pressure and randomness was proposed [4, 56\u201360]. On the other hand, T* seems not to be sensitive to the sample quality and the local strain, and the domain structure of nematicity observed above TS is homogeneous [54, 55]. It is noteworthy that bulk orbital polarization starts to emerge at T = T*(>TS) in Ba122 compounds, according to the recent PEEM study [55]. In this study, we will explain the multistage smectic/nematic transitions: the smectic order (q \u2260 0) at T = T* and the nematic order (q = 0) at TS. In this scenario, T* is given by the intrinsic smectic order free from randomness.\nIn contrast to B1g nematicity in typical Fe-based superconductors, the emergence of 45\u00b0-rotated B2g nematicity in heavily hole-doped AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb) has been reported in Refs. [61\u201364], while Refs. [65, 66] have reported the absence of the nematic order. As shown in Figure 1C, the dominant B1g nematicity changes to B2g nematicity with doping x in Ba1\u2212xRbxFe2As2. As for the mechanism of B2g nematicity, vestigial nematic order by using the double-stripe magnetic configuration was suggested [67]. However, no SDW transition has been observed [64, 68] in AFe2As2, and the spin fluctuations are weak around TS in RbFe2As2 [69]. In this study, we reveal the emergence of B2g-symmetry bond order in AFe2As2.\nAs described previously, the variety of nematicity in Fe-based superconductors is very rich. To understand the mechanism of nematic/smectic states and superconductivity, it is important to explain these nematic/smectic states in the same theoretical framework.\nIn this study, we study B1g nematicity in FeSe1\u2212xTex (nd = 6.0), the tiny nematicity below T* in BaFe2As2 (nd = 6.0), and B2g nematicity in AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb) (nd = 5.5) by developing the density wave (DW) equation theory. In this theory, the paramagnon interference mechanism due to the Aslamazov\u2013Larkin (AL) type VCs shown in Figure 1D is taken into account. We also take into account of the selfenergy effect shown in Figure 1E. In this mechanism, the rich variety of nematicity is naturally understood. The obtained nematicity depends on the shape and topology of FSs, as shown in Figures 2A\u2013C. 1) In FeSe1\u2212xTex, all FSs are very small, and dxy-orbital hole pocket is absent. The small spin fluctuations on the three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively lead to the B1g nematic order, where the orbital order for dxz and dyz orbitals coexists with the bond order for the dxy orbital. The experimental Lifshitz transition below TS is naturally explained by the nematic order. 2) In BaFe2As2, the dxy hole pocket emerges, and each FS is relatively large. The smectic order at T = T*(>TS) and the nematic order at T = TS emerge due to the strong dxyorbital nesting. The smectic order explains the tiny nematicity below T*, and the multistage transitions are explained by the smectic and nematic orders. 3) In heavily hole-doped AFe2As2, the large dxy-orbital hole pocket and the four tiny Dirac pockets appear. The B2g nematic bond order emerges due to the dxyorbital paramagnon interference mechanism, where the nesting between the Dirac pockets and the large dxy-orbital hole pocket plays an important role. By considering the fermiology of each compound, these various nematic/smectic states are explained by the same theoretical framework based on the paramagnon interference mechanism.\nIn the present study, we intensively study the effect of selfenergy on the nematic/smectic orders. It has been dropped in many previous studies, despite the fact that self-energy is necessary to satisfy the criteria of Baym\u2013Kadanoff\u2019s conserving approximation [70, 71]. We revealed that 1) the nematic/smectic order is stabilized by the AL-type VCs, while 2) TS is reduced to become realistic (~ 100K) by introducing self-energy. These results validate the idea of the \u201cnematic/smectic state due to the paramagnon interference mechanism\u201d proposed in our\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156193\nprevious studies [14\u201320, 39\u201344]. In addition, 3) the phase diagram of FeSe1\u2212xTex [49\u201351] is understood by using a fixed Coulomb interaction because of self-energy (in the absence of self-energy, add-hoc doping x dependence of the Coulomb interaction has to be introduced). The main merits (1)\u2013(3) in the present study strongly indicate that the nematic/smectic states originate from the paramagnon interference mechanism [14\u201320, 39\u201344]."

The effect of self-energy on the nematic/smectic order caused by the VCs is systematically studied in the present work. Because of self-energy, TS is reduced to become realistic (~ 100K), while the symmetry of the nematic/ smectic order is unchanged. Thus, the idea of electronic nematicity due to \u201cthe paramagnon-interference mechanism\u201d proposed in Refs. [14\u201320, 39\u201344] has been confirmed by the present study.\nHereafter, we fix r = 0.35, T = 15 meV in calculations with selfenergy and r = 0.15, T = 15 meV in calculations without the selfenergy, unless otherwise noted.\nFigures 4A,B show x dependent FSs and band structures, respectively. The FSs are small compared to other Fe-based superconductors. The dxy orbital level EMxy at the M point increases with increasing x, as shown in Figure 4C. This behavior is consistent with ARPES measurements [77, 78]. On the other hand, the dxy orbital level E\u0393xy at the \u0393 point decreases with increasing x. E\u0393xy becomes lower than the dxz(yz) orbital level for x \u2273 0.3, and the topology of band changes. The change in topology has been observed between \u0393 and Z points in ARPES measurements of FeSe0.5Te0.5 [79, 80]. Figure 4D shows the density of state (DOS) of orbitals 3 and 4 for x = 0, 0.5. The DOS near the Fermi level for x = 0.5 is larger than that for x = 0 since the bandwidth decreases, and EMxy comes close to the Fermi level with increasing x. In addition, the dispersion of orbitals 2 and 3 at the \u0393 point becomes flat as E\u0393xy decreases with increasing x, which also enlarges the DOS for orbitals 2 and 3 near the Fermi level.\nTo discuss the self-energy effect, we calculate the mass enhancement factors. Figure 5 shows the obtained x dependence of the mass enhancement factors z\u22121l (\u03c0, 0) for orbital l = 3, 4, which are given by z\u22121l (k) 1 \u2212 Im\u03a3l,l(k, \u03c0T)/\u03c0T in the FLEX approximation. The value of z\u22121l (\u03c0, 0) increases with increasing x since the electron correlation increases due to the reduction in the bandwidth and the increase in the DOS as shown in Figure 4D. Particularly, z\u221214 (\u03c0, 0) is enhanced by the dxy orbital electron correlation between the electron pockets and the band around the M point since EMxy comes close to the Fermi level, as shown in Figure 4C. The behaviors of z\u22121l are similar to those given by the dynamical mean-field theory [81] and experiment [82].\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156195\nFigure 6 shows x dependences of \u03c7s3,3;3,3(\u03c0, 0) and \u03c7s4,4;4,4(\u03c0, 0) in the FLEX approximation and the RPA. \u03c7s3,3;3,3(\u03c0, 0) is almost independent of doping x, which means that change in topology or the number of FS around \u0393 comprising dxz and dyz orbitals does not strongly affect the spin fluctuation for the dxz(yz) orbital. On the other hand, \u03c7s4,4;4,4(\u03c0, 0) in the RPA without self-energy is strongly enhanced with increasing x since the electron correlation for the dxy orbital between electron pockets and the band around the M point is significant for the enhancement of \u03c7s4,4;4,4(\u03c0, 0). The strong enhancement of \u03c7s4,4;4,4(\u03c0, 0) is suppressed by the selfenergy in the FLEX approximation. This suppression is necessary to reproduce the x dependence of TS in the phase diagram.\nHereafter, we discuss the DW instability given by the DW Eq. 9. Figure 7A shows x dependences of \u03bb0 for the B1g nematic state with and without the self-energy. \u03bb0 without the self-energy rapidly increases with doping x due to the paramagnon interference shown in Figure 1D. \u03bb0 is enlarged by the\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156196\ninterference between \u03c7s4,4;4,4 strongly enhanced in the RPA, as shown in Figure 6. Since this result means TS increases with x, the phase diagram in Figure 1A cannot be explained when the selfenergy is absent. However, \u03bb0 including the self-energy decreases with doping x since the enhancement of \u03c7s4,4;4,4 in the FLEX approximation is moderate and the self-energy suppresses the G\u0302 and I\u0302 in the DW Eq. 10. The value of \u03bb0 increases with decreasing T, as shown in Figure 7B, and T = TS is given when \u03bb0 = 1 is satisfied. Thus, TS at x = 0 is higher than that at x = 0.5, and TS at x = 0.65 cannot be obtained for T > 6 meV. The x dependence of TS obtained by the paramagnon interference mechanism is consistent with the phase diagram in Figure 1A [49]. We see that T dependences of the strength of nematic fluctuations 1/(1 \u2212 \u03bb0) satisfy the Curie\u2013Weiss law at low temperatures, as shown in Figure 7C. We note that the B1g nematic state is realized because of the small FSs even for the weak spin fluctuations [16, 17].\nHere, we analytically explain that TS is reduced by self-energy by focusing on the mass renormalization factor z. As discussed in\nRef. [17], \u03b1s(c) is independent of z under the scaling T \u2192 zT and r\u2192 r/z. Under this scaling, the eigenvalue of the DW equation is unchanged [17]. Thus, TS obtained by the DW equation without the self-energy is reduced to zTS because of the self-energy. As a result, realistic TS is obtained by taking self-energy into account.\nFigure 8A shows q dependences of \u03bbq with the self-energy at x = 0, 0.5. \u03bbq has peak at q = 0, which means that the ferro nematic order is favored. Figure 8B shows k dependences of the static form factors f033(k) and f044(k), where f\u0302\nq(k) is given by the analytic continuation of f\u0302\nq(k). f033(kx, ky) \u2212f022(ky, kx) represents B1g orbital order between orbitals 2 and 3. From the k dependence of f033(22)(k), the sign-reversing orbital order is confirmed along the kx(ky) axis. As shown in Figure 8C, k dependence of f044(k)\u221d cos(kx) \u2212 cos(ky) causes the B1g nearest-neighbor bond order, which is the modulation of correlated hopping. Based on the paramagnon interference mechanism, we find that the small spin fluctuations on the three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively cause the B1g nematic orbital + bond order. The FSs and the band structure under the nematic order with the maximum value of the form factor f0max 80meV are shown in Figures 8D,E. f0max 80meV with the mass enhancement factor z\u22121l 2 ~ 4 is consistent with ARPES measurements [35, 36]. The Lifshitz transition, where the FS around the Y point is missing, has been reported in recent experiments [83\u201386]. The Lifshitz transition is naturally explained by the increase of the dxy level around the Y point induced by f044(k). We note that the obtained coexistence of the bond order on the dxy orbital and the orbital order on the (dxz, dyz) orbitals has already been shown in the supplementary material of Refs. [19, 20]. In Figure 8D, we derived the Lifshitz transition by setting f0max 80meV by hand. It is noteworthy that the same result is recently obtained by solving the full DW equation in Ref. [87]. The full DW equation enables us to study the electronic states below TSwithout introducing additional fitting parameters.\nHere, we confirm that the dxy orbital levels at \u0393 and M points are important for the x dependence of \u03bb0. We use the simple model, where only the shift of E\u0393xy or E M xy is introduced for the x = 0 model. Figure 9A shows E\u0393xy dependences of z \u22121 l (\u03c0, 0) and \u03bb0,\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156197\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156198\nrespectively. z\u22121l (\u03c0, 0) is almost independent of the value of E\u0393xy. \u03bb0 decreases with decreasing E\u0393xy, which is consistent with the result shown in Figure 7A. The topology of the band structure changes at the \u0393 point with decreasing E\u0393xy, which plays an important role in decreasing \u03bb0. Figure 9B shows EMxy dependences of z\u22121l (\u03c0, 0) and \u03bb0, respectively. The behaviors of z\u221214 (\u03c0, 0) and \u03bb0 are similar to the results shown in Figure 5, Figure 7A. The x dependences of z\u221214 (\u03c0, 0) and \u03bb0 are explained by the electron correlation between the electron pockets and the dxy band around theM point. \u03bb0 is suppressed by self-energy for the dxy orbital. The suppression becomes strong with increasing EMxy due to the feedback effect of the self-energy. To summarize, the B1g nematic orbital + bond order is explained by the paramagnon interference mechanism in FeSe1\u2212xTex, and x dependence of TS is well reproduced by the self-energy effect for the dxy orbital."

            "text": "In this section, we discuss the multi-nematicity in BaFe2As2 [20].\nThe effect of self-energy on the nematic/smectic orders caused by the VCs is studied in the present work. Transition temperatures are reduced to become realistic because of the self-energy, while the symmetries of the nematic/smectic orders are unchanged. We reveal the origin of the tiny nematicity below T = T* and explain the multistage transitions\nat T = T* and TS in the phase diagram shown in Figure 1B. As shown in Figure 2B, the size of the hole FS around the M point comprising the dxy orbital is similar to that of electron FSs around the X and Y points, which causes good intra- and inter-orbital nestings. As explained later, inter-orbital nesting is important to realize the smectic state at T = T*.\nFigure 10A shows the q-dependence of \u03bbq with and without self-energy. The q = (0, \u03c0) smectic bond order is dominant over the q = 0 nematic orbital + bond order because of the relation \u03bb(0,\u03c0) > \u03bb0, which is robust in the presence of moderate spin fluctuations \u03b1s \u2273 0.85. Thus, the nematic orbital + bond transition temperature TS is lower than T*, where the smectic bond order appears. Figure 10B shows the dominant component of the static form factor, fq3,4(k), for q = (0, \u03c0). Focusing on the X and M points, f(0,\u03c0)3,4 (k) is proportional to \u2212 cos(ky), which corresponds to the inter-orbital smectic bond order, where the y-direction hoppings between orbitals 3 and 4 are modulated by the correlated hopping \u03b4t3,4(y; y \u00b1 1) = \u2212\u03b4t4,3(y; y \u00b1 1) = \u03b4t(\u22121)\ny. It is to be noted that \u03b4tl,m(y; y\u2032) is real and equal to \u03b4tm,l(y\u2032; y).\nAs shown in Figure 1D, the origin of the smectic bond order f(0,\u03c0)3,4 is the quantum interference between the spin fluctuations \u03c7s(Q) forQ \u2248 (0, \u03c0) and \u03c7s(0) due to the AL terms. In this case, q = (0, \u03c0) (=Q +Q\u2032) is given byQ\u2032 = 0. \u03c7s(Q) is enhanced when the FS appears around theM point since nesting between FSs around the\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9156199\nX andM points becomes good, while the moderate \u03c7s(0) is caused by forward scattering. We find that f(0,\u03c0)3,4 is significantly enlarged by inter-orbital nesting between the dxy-orbital FS around the M point and the dyz-orbital FS around the X point. In addition to the quantum interference due to the AL terms, the MT terms strengthen the sign change of f(0,\u03c0)3,4 (k) between the X and M points, as reported previously [16, 19, 37]. Thus, the smectic bond order originates from the cooperation between the AL and MT\nterms due to good inter-orbital nesting between FSs around the X and M points. In contrast, the B1g nematic orbital + bond order shown in Figures 10C,D originates from the interference between \u03c7s(Q) and \u03c7s(\u2212Q). This nematic orbital + bond order is similar to that in FeSe and FeSe1\u2212xTex.\nHere, we examine the DOS under the smectic bond order to verify the present theory. For T < T* = 32.4 meV without selfenergy, we introduce the mean-field-like T-dependent form factor f\u0302\nq(T) fmax tanh(1.74 T*/T \u2212 1\u221a )f\u0302q, where f\u0302q is the obtained form factor for q = (0, \u03c0) normalized as maxk| f\nq(k)| = 1. We put fmax = 60 meV. Figure 11A shows the DOS at T = T* and 28 meV(<T*). For T < T*, a pseudogap appears due to the smectic bond order, which is consistent with the experiments [88, 89]. Since the smectic bond order is an antiferroic order, the folded band structure emerges below T*, which is also consistent with the experiment [90].\nNext, we focus on another mystery, the T-linear behavior of tiny nematicity \u03c8 in Ba122 [52] below T*. To solve this mystery, we calculate the T dependence of uniform nematicity \u03c8 = (n2 \u2212 n3)/(n2 + n3) in Figure 11B, where both f\u0302\n(0,\u03c0)(T) for T < T* and the ferro nematic orbital + bond order f\u0302\n0(T) for T<TS 27.8meV) are introduced. For T < TS, we assume f\u0302 0(T) fmax tanh(1.74 TS/T \u2212 1\u221a )f\u03020, where f\u03020 is the obtained form factor normalized as maxk|f 0(k)| = 1. We use fmax = 60 meV, which corresponds to the dxz(yz) orbital energy split ~ 60meV in the ARPES measurements [91] by considering the mass enhancement factor z\u22121l ~ 2 for l = 2, 3. The T-linear behavior \u03c8 \u221d (T* \u2212 T) for TS < T < T* is a consequence of the relation \u03c8\u221d [f(0,\u03c0)(T)]2 because the f(0,\u03c0) term cannot contribute to any q = 0 linear response. It is to be noted that the form factor f\u0302 (\u03c0,0)\nfor q = (\u03c0, 0) gives \u03c8 < 0. Thus, the T-linear behavior of \u03c8 below T* is also naturally explained by the smectic bond order. On the other hand, \u03c8\u221d TS \u2212 T\u221a for T < TS is induced by the nematic orbital + bond order. To summarize, the multistage transitions at T = T* and TS, and the T-linear \u03c8 below T*, are naturally explained by the smectic bond order and nematic orbital + bond order. The hole pocket around the M point is necessary to realize the smectic bond order by the paramagnon interference mechanism.\nFIGURE 12 | (A) q dependence of \u03bbq with self-energy in CsFe2As2, and that without self-energy in the inset.

The present smectic order originates from the AL\u2013VC and the FS nesting between the dxyorbital hole pocket and the electron pockets [20]. We stress that the present theory explains the absence of the smectic order in bulk FeSe [55] because the dxy-orbital hole pocket, which is necessary for smectic order formation, is below the Fermi level in FeSe.\nHere, we explain the details of the recent microscopic measurements in P-doped Ba122 [54, 55] that support the present intrinsic scenario. These are bulk and real-space measurements. In the PEEM measurement [55], very uniform bulk nematic domains have been observed for TS < T < T*. The width of each nematic domain is about 500 nm. The structure of the nematic domains is unchanged for T < TS. In addition, once the nematic domain completely disappears by increasing T, it never appears at the same location if the temperature is lowered\nagain. These results are consistent with the present intrinsic smectic order scenario for TS < T < T* in P-doped Ba122. In the photo-modulation measurement [54], uniform nematic domains have also been observed. The observed nematicity becomes small near the nematic domain boundary, irrespective of the fact that large local strain anisotropy is observed at the domain boundary. The observed anticorrelation between the nematicity and the local strain anisotropy may conflict with the assumption of the extrinsic scenario of the nematicity above TS.\nIn contrast, the extrinsic scenario has been proposed by other groups [4, 56\u201360]. In the extrinsic mechanism, nematicity for T > TS in Co-doped Ba122, which exhibits large residual resistivity (>100 \u03bc\u03a9cm), has been explained by the inhomogeneity of TS induced by the disorder and local strain. However, it is not easy to explain the nematicity above TS in clean P-doped (non-doped) Ba122 on the same footing in the extrinsic scenario.\nFIGURE 14 | (A) Schematic picture of the B1g nematic orbital + bond order in FeSe1\u2212xTex and BaFe2As2, where the orbital order for the dxz and dyz orbitals coexists with the bond order for the dxy orbital.

            "text": "In this section, we discuss B2g nematicity in heavily hole-doped compound AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb) [19]. The effect of self-energy on the nematic order caused by the VCs is studied in the present work. Because of self-energy, TS is reduced to become realistic, whereas the symmetry of the nematic order is unchanged. The direction of B2g nematicity is rotated by 45\u00b0 from that of the conventional B1g nematicity. Figure 2C shows FSs of CsFe2As2: the hole FS around theM point comprising the dxy-orbital is large, whereas the Dirac pockets near the X and Y points are small. In this system, the dxy-orbital spin fluctuations are dominant.\nFigure 12A shows the q dependence of the largest eigenvalue \u03bbq with self-energy for r = 0.96 at T = 5meV and that without selfenergy for r = 0.30 at T = 20meV \u03bbq becomes maximum at q = 0 and the dominant form factorf04,4(k)\u221d sin(kx) sin(ky) at q = 0 is shown in Figure 12B. As shown in Figure 12C, this form factor corresponds to the B2g next-nearest-neighbor bond order for the dxy orbital, which is consistent with the experimentally observed B2g nematicity [61\u201364]. By analyzing the irreducible four-point vertex I04,4;4,4(k, k\u2032) in the DW Eq. 10, we find that the attractive (repulsive) interactions originate from the AL (MT) terms, as shown in Figure 12D. The obtained q = 0 B2g bond order is derived from these interactions. Since the AL terms are enhanced by the quantum interference between the spin fluctuations with Q and Q9(= \u2212Q), as shown in Figure 1D, the q = 0 nematic bond order is realized. The value of \u03bb0 is strongly enhanced by the attractive interactions for the dxy orbital due to the AL terms. In this system, the nesting vector is short Q ~ (0.5\u03c0, 0), as shown in Figure 12B. Because of repulsive interaction by the MT terms, f04,4(k) changes sign between the k points on the FSs connected by Q, as shown in Figure 12D. To summarize, the AL terms strongly enlarge \u03bb0 due to the paramagnon interferencemechanism, and the MT terms favor B2g symmetry. Cooperation of the AL and MT terms is important to realize the B2g bond order.\nWe comment on the recent experiments on RbFe2As2. The specific heat jump at TS = 40K (\u0394C/TS) is very small [64]. However, it is naturally understood based on the recent theoretical scaling relation \u0394C/TS \u221dTbS with b ~ 3 derived in Ref. [87]. Although the smallness of B2g nematic susceptibility in RbFe2As2 was recently reported in Refs. [65, 66], the field angle-dependent specific heat measurement has shown finite B2g nematicity above Tc [93]. Further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary to clarify the nematicity in AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb).\nFinally, we discuss the x dependence of nematicity in Ba1\u2212xAxFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb). The schematic phase diagram of Ba1\u2212xRbxFe2As2 given by the experiment [64] is shown in Figure 1C. We introduce the model Hamiltonian for Ba1\u2212xCsxFe2As2, by interpolating between the BaFe2As2 model and the CsFe2As2 model with the ratio 1 \u2212 x: x. Figure 13A shows x dependences of \u03bbq=0without self-energy for the B2g and the B1g symmetries by fixing T = 30 meV and r = 0.30. Below x = xc ~ 0.5, the B1g nematic orbital order is dominant as discussed in the previous section, while the B2g nematic bond order dominates over\nthe B1g nematic orbital order for x > xc. As shown in Figure 13B, the Lifshitz transition occurs at x ~ xc, where the electron pockets split into the four tiny Dirac pockets. Thus, the B2g nematic bond order appears when the nesting vectorQ between the electron pockets and hole pocket around the M point becomes short Q ~ (0.5\u03c0, 0). By taking account of the Lifshitz transition at x ~ xc, the schematic phase diagram in Figure 1C is also well reproduced by the orbital/ bond order because of the paramagnon interference mechanism. We note that the q = (0, \u03c0) smectic order is dominant over the q = 0 B1g nematic order at x = 0, as shown in the previous section."

            "text": "We discussed the rich variety of nematic/smectic states in Febased superconductors in the same theoretical framework based on the paramagnon interference mechanism. In this mechanism, the charge-channel order is induced by the quantum interference between the spin fluctuations, as shown in Figure 1D. The form factor and wave vector of the DW instability are derived from the DW equation based on the paramagnon interference mechanism. Recently, a rigorous formalism of the DW equation has been constructed based on the Luttinger\u2013Ward (LW) theory in Ref. [87]. According to Ref. [87], the solution of the DW equation gives the minimum of the grand potential in the LW theory. Thus, the nematic/smectic order discussed in the present study is thermodynamically stable in the framework of the conserving approximation.\nBy considering the characteristic fermiology of each compound, the paramagnon interference mechanism explains the rich variety of the nematic/smectic states. In Figures 14A\u2013C, we summarized the nematic/smectic orders revealed by the mechanism in the present study. 1) In FeSe1\u2212xTex, each FS is very small and the dxy-orbital hole pocket is absent. In this case, the small spin fluctuations on the three orbitals cooperatively lead to the B1g orbital order for the dxz and dyz orbitals coexisting with the dxyorbital bond order, as shown in Figure 14A. The nematic orbital + bond order causes the Lifshitz transition, where the FS around the Y point disappears, which is consistent with the recent experiments. The x dependence of TS in the phase diagram is reproduced by introducing self-energy. 2) In BaFe2As2, the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges. Since each electron and hole pocket is relatively large and similar in size, the strong dxy-orbital spin fluctuations due to good nesting give rise to the smectic order shown in Figure 14B and the B1g nematic order. The smectic order explains the tiny T-linear nematicity belowT =T*(>TS).We predict themultistage transitions with the smectic order at T = T* and the nematic order at TS. 3) In heavily hole-doped AFe2As2 (A = Cs, Rb), the tiny Dirac pockets around the X(Y) point and the large dxy-orbital hole pocket appear due to hole-doping. The B2g bond order for the dxy orbital shown in Figure 14C emerges due to the dxy-orbital paramagnon interference mechanism. The B2g bond order is triggered by the Lifshitz transition of the electron FSs by hole-doping.\nThe limitation of this theory is that the calculatedVCs are reduced to an infinite series of the MT and AL terms. To verify the validity of the present theory, we performed the functional renormalization group (fRG) analysis for the single-orbital Hubbard model for\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 91561912\ncuprates [41] and the two-orbital Hubbardmodel for ruthenates [94], and obtained the bond-order (orbital order) in the former (latter) model. These results are consistent with previous experiments, and they are also obtained by the DW equation analysis. In the fRG theory, a huge number of higher-order VCs are generated in an unbiased manner by solving the RG equation. Thus, the significance of theMT and AL terms in the present theory has been confirmed by the different and excellent theoretical frameworks.\nIn future, it is to clarify themechanism of superconductivity and non-Fermi-liquid behaviors of transport phenomena in the FeSe family by considering the nematic fluctuations enlarged near the nematic QCP. This issue will be discussed in future studies [95].\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article; further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nSO performed all calculations with contributions from HK.
