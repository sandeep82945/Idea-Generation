Comparative Effectiveness of XHP Against Other Treatments: Conduct a comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of XHP against existing ALD treatments, including pharmaceuticals and other TCM formulations. This research could involve both preclinical models and clinical trials to provide a direct comparison in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.

Mechanistic Studies of Individual Components within XHP: While the paper identified 199 compounds within XHP, detailed mechanistic studies on how individual components contribute to the hepatoprotective effect could provide insights into their roles. Isolating specific compounds and evaluating their effects on ALD pathogenesis, including their interactions with key molecular targets, could uncover new therapeutic pathways.

Long-term Efficacy and Safety of XHP: Investigate the long-term effects of XHP treatment on ALD progression and liver health in general. This would involve longitudinal studies tracking the progression of ALD in subjects treated with XHP over extended periods, monitoring for any potential side effects, and evaluating the sustainability of liver function improvement.

Elucidation of XHPâ€™s Effects on Liver Regeneration: Beyond its hepatoprotective effects, exploring whether XHP promotes liver regeneration and the mechanisms underlying such potential effects could open new therapeutic avenues for ALD and other liver diseases. This could involve studies on stem cell activation, hepatocyte proliferation, and the role of specific signaling pathways.

Personalized Medicine Approaches Using XHP: Considering the complex nature of TCM formulations like XHP, research into personalized medicine approaches could be beneficial. This would involve identifying patient-specific factors (e.g., genetic, metabolic, lifestyle) that influence the efficacy and safety of XHP, thereby optimizing treatment plans for individual patients.
