    "abstractText": "Background Adverse childhood life events are associated with increased risks of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke later in life. Limited evidence also suggests that stress in adulthood may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether childhood adversity may lead to the development of AF is unknown. We investigated whether the loss of a parent or sibling in childhood is associated with an increased risk of AF and compared this effect to that of similar losses in young adulthood. Methods We studied 6,394,975 live-born individuals included in the Danish (1973\u20132018) and Swedish Medical Birth Registers (1973\u20132014). We linked data from several national registers to obtain information on the death of parents and siblings and on personal and familial sociodemographic and health-related factors. We analyzed the association between bereavement and AF using Poisson regression. Results Loss of a parent or sibling was associated with an increased AF risk both when the loss occurred in childhood and in adulthood; the adjusted incident rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.24 (1.14\u20131.35) and 1.24 (1.16\u20131.33), respectively. Bereavement in childhood was associated with AF only if losses were due to cardiovascular diseases or other natural causes, while loss in adulthood was associated with AF not only in case of natural deaths, but also unnatural deaths. The associations did not differ substantially according to age at loss and whether the deceased was a parent or a sibling. Conclusions Bereavement both in childhood and in adulthood was associated with an increased AF risk.",

We linked data from several national registers to obtain information on the death of parents and siblings and on personal and familial sociodemographic and health-related factors. We analyzed the association between bereavement and AF using Poisson regression.\nResults Loss of a parent or sibling was associated with an increased AF risk both when the loss occurred in childhood and in adulthood; the adjusted incident rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.24 (1.14\u20131.35) and 1.24 (1.16\u20131.33), respectively. Bereavement in childhood was associated with AF only if losses were due to cardiovascular diseases or other natural causes, while loss in adulthood was associated with AF not only in case of natural deaths, but also unnatural deaths. The associations did not differ substantially according to age at loss and whether the deceased was a parent or a sibling.\nConclusions Bereavement both in childhood and in adulthood was associated with an increased AF risk.

            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated prevalence of 33 million cases and an annual incidence of 5 million cases globally [1]. Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure [2]. A substantial proportion of AF cases may not be attributable to its main known risk factors, i.e., genetic predisposition, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle [3, 4], emphasizing the importance of identifying novel risk factors [5]. Furthermore, given its strong association with age, AF is often regarded as a disease of the elderly. However, AF occurs\u2014even if with a low incidence\u2014also in childhood and in early adulthood; nevertheless, knowledge about the etiology of the disease in the young is very limited.\nSeveral studies reported that adverse psychological factors in adulthood\u2014primarily work stress [6], adverse life events [7], or emotional distress [8, 9]\u2014are associated with a modestly increased risk of AF. However, evidence in this field is limited and inconsistent as several studies did not find such associations [10, 11]. A recent meta-analysis suggests a modest association between stress assessed in adulthood and the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke (1.1- to 1.6-fold increased risk) but a higher relative risk in case of stress in childhood (an approximately 2-fold increased risk) [12]. To our knowledge, no previous study investigated whether stress in childhood may increase the risk of AF.\nThe death of a parent in childhood is one of the most stressful events that a child can experience [13] and is likely to adversely affect the child\u2019s daily routines, psychological functioning, social support, financial situation, and living environment and to lead to attachment difficulties to a partner, lower educational attainment, and unemployment in adulthood [14, 15]. The relationship with the sibling may be the longest and one of the closest over life; thus, loss of a sibling may be a further devastating event in childhood [16]. The acute or chronic stress related to bereavement may lead to changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous, endocrine, immune, and cardiovascular systems [17, 18], all of which may initiate and/or maintain AF by inducing electrical and structural remodeling of the heart [2, 18\u201323]. Thus, if stress in childhood is implicated in the etiology of AF, we may expect to observe an association between bereavement in childhood and AF risk.\nIn this prospective study based on a bi-national Nordic cohort, we aimed to investigate whether severe stress, defined as the death of a parent or sibling, in childhood is associated with an increased AF risk. Secondary\naims were (1) to analyze whether the association differs according to the relationship to the deceased, the relative\u2019s cause of death, and age at loss in childhood and (2) to estimate similar associations for loss in adulthood and to compare them to those observed in case of childhood loss, given the limited and inconsistent evidence regarding the role of stress in adulthood in the etiology of AF."

We treated exposure as a time-varying variable, i.e., exposed offsprings contributed person-time from birth\nuntil the death of the parent or sibling to the unexposed group and to the exposed group afterwards; unexposed offsprings contributed person-time only to the unexposed group. We ran analyses with any loss in childhood and in adulthood, as well as with these exposures further categorized according to the cause of the parent\u2019s or sibling\u2019s death and the child\u2019s age at loss (\u2264 5, 6\u201312, 13\u201318, 19\u201325, 26\u201330, or > 30 years) and separately for the loss of a parent (and for mother and father) and loss of a sibling. We ran models adjusted for time since birth and calendar year of follow-up and models additionally adjusted for country, maternal age at the offspring\u2019s birth, and the parents\u2019 country of origin, highest education, and history of psychiatric disorders; we treated time since birth (in 5-year intervals) and calendar year of follow-up (1973\u20131979, in 10-year intervals from 1980) as time-varying variables.\nWe investigated whether the risk of AF varies according to the time since the loss by splitting the follow-up of the exposed as < 3 months, 3 months to 1 year, 1\u20135 years, 5\u201310 years, and > 10 years. Given that information on several covariates (e.g., gestational age, maternal and paternal income, maternal smoking and BMI in early pregnancy, maternal hypertension and diabetes, parents\u2019 history of CVD, and family history of CVD and psychiatric disorders before the offspring\u2019s birth) was available only for a sub-cohort (mainly because such information was recorded in the registers in the later parts of our study period) (Additional file\u00a0 1: Table\u00a0 S1), we adjusted for these potential confounders among those with such data. We adjusted for the offspring\u2019s highest educational level in addition to the factors in the main model to study whether this variable mediated the association between parent\u2019s death in childhood and the risk of AF. To investigate whether offspring\u2019s heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders contributed to the association studied, we classified exposed individuals according to whether they had these medical conditions after loss. We run analyses stratified by sex, study country, and parents\u2019 highest education to analyze whether the association of interest differed according to these characteristics. We ran analyses after excluding offsprings (1) whose father died before birth (n = 1762) and (2) whose parent or sibling died before age 2 given concerns that these losses might eventually not cause stress in these very young offsprings (n = 32,315).\nWe used SAS 9.4.

However, losses in adulthood were associated with AF not only in cases of natural deaths, but also in cases of unnatural deaths of relatives. The association did not substantially differ when we more finely classified exposure according to the age of the offspring at loss in adulthood. The risk of AF was highest during the 3 months to 1 year after loss, both for losses in childhood and in adulthood (Fig.\u00a01). The association between a parent\u2019s or a sibling\u2019s death in childhood and adulthood and the risk of AF did not substantially alter after additional adjustment for gestational age, maternal and paternal income, maternal smoking and BMI in early pregnancy, maternal hypertension and diabetes, parents\u2019 history of CVD, and a family history of CVD and psychiatric disorders"

The findings that the death of a parent or sibling, both in childhood and in early adulthood, was associated with an increased risk of AF corroborate the results of earlier studies showing that individuals who lost a partner or child had higher risks of AF than their unexposed counterparts [5, 26]. Similarly, the results were in line with the findings of several [6\u20139], though not all [10, 11], previous studies suggesting that job stress, adverse life events, psychological distress, and certain psychiatric disorders are associated with AF, as well as those\nof several earlier studies reporting an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality or incident ischemic heart diseases, stroke, or heart failure in adulthood after experiencing the death of a parent [15, 27\u201329] or sibling in childhood [30] or after exposure to other childhood adversities [31]. Our study contributes to the existing literature on the role of stress and adverse life events in the etiology of AF by investigating the exposure to death of a close relative in childhood (overall and by subtypes) in a large bi-national cohort study, by comparing the effects of childhood and adult bereavement, and by considering a large number of potential confounders of this association.\nWe found that the risk of AF was increased when the loss\u2014in childhood or adulthood\u2014was due to CVD or other natural causes. This finding is in line with that of several other studies reporting the highest risks of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality after the loss of a parent in childhood [15, 28] and of a sibling in childhood and adulthood [32\u201334] if the relative\u2019s death was due to natural, in particular, cardiovascular deaths. One potential explanation for these findings is confounding due to shared familial cardiovascular risk factors,\ne.g., genetic susceptibility, diet, or living environment. Alternatively, it is possible that childhood adversity may increase the risk of AF only among those with a cardiometabolic vulnerability, which is likely to be more pronounced among those who lost a parent due to CVD or other related diseases. In contrast, unnatural deaths of the relatives\u2014which are less likely to be affected by cardiovascular risk factors clustering in the family\u2014were associated with the risk of AF only if the loss occurred in adulthood, providing stronger support for the hypotheses that stress-related mechanisms may operate.\nThe association between the parent\u2019s or the sibling\u2019s death in childhood and the risk of AF may differ according to the age of the child at loss. The first few years of life are a sensitive period regarding the loss of a parent as the early interaction with caregivers is critical for the development of the brain architecture and the programming of stress reactivity [35]. Adolescence is another potentially sensitive period, given that adolescents exposed to stress may adopt negative coping strategies in terms of adverse health behaviors [36]. Nevertheless, we found no evidence that the risk of AF differed according to the minor child\u2019s age at loss. Similarly, we\nexpected that the death of parents may have a stronger emotional impact and be more closely related to the adverse health outcomes than the death of a sibling in childhood. Similarly, mothers are often the primary attachment figures and are probably more involved in their children\u2019s upbringing than fathers [37, 38]. However, the associations did not differ substantially when comparing the loss of a sibling to that of a parent, and a link between the death of a parent in childhood and the risk of AF was observed only in the case of deaths of the father, but not of the mother. We speculate that a possible explanation for this latter finding may be related to better statistical power in case of paternal deaths in childhood or a higher proportion of cardiovascular and other natural deaths among the fathers than the mothers during childhood."

            "text": "It is not clear why we did not find an association between bereavement due to unnatural causes in childhood\u2014 which are less likely to be affected by cardiovascular risk factors than natural deaths\u2014and the risk of AF. One explanation may be related to the earlier observation in adult samples that the AF risk increase after the loss was more pronounced in the short than in the long term [5]. A similar triggering effect may not apply for pediatric AF, a condition with largely unknown, but potentially different etiology than AF in adulthood, nor for the relation between exposure in childhood and AF in adulthood. Moreover, detecting AF in children may be more difficult than in adults due to the differences in symptom presentation or the lower quality of the information provided by children on their symptoms or because physicians would normally not expect AF in childhood [39]. Though we did not observe an association in the case of unnatural deaths in childhood, it is still possible that stress in childhood may increase the risk of AF if it interacts with cardiometabolic vulnerability.\nBereavement, in childhood or adulthood, may increase the risk of AF through several pathways. An increasing number of studies suggest an elevated autonomic nervous system activity before episodes of paroxysmal AF [40, 41], while others document a higher frequency of stressful life events before paroxysmal AF [42] or first AF diagnoses [5, 26], i.e., a triggering effect. In the longer term, bereavement stress and the associated chronic activation and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system may increase the risk of psychological distress, mental disorders, adverse lifestyle, and unfavorable changes in the autonomic tone and in endocrine, immune, inflammatory, hemodynamic, and cardiovascular activity [17, 18]. These in turn may promote electrical changes and the structural remodeling of the heart [18\u201322], thereby triggering and sustaining AF [2, 23]. Our findings of a lower AF risk in bereaved individuals who did not develop compared to those who developed ischemic heart diseases, heart failure and hypertension after the loss, may be supportive of these hypotheses, though differences in detection of AF may have also contributed to these findings."

            "text": "Our study had several strengths. First, we had prospectively collected information on offsprings from birth up to early middle age for both exposure and outcome. Second, the large sample size yielded us the possibility to detect modest associations, to conduct several important sub-analyses according to the characteristics\nof bereavement, or to relevant sociodemographic factors. Third, the extensive register linkages allowed us to adjust for several important covariates. Nevertheless, our findings need to be interpreted in light of some limitations. First, though we adjusted for several covariates, we did not have information on other potential confounders such as genetic factors, lifestyle, and living environment. Second, our findings may only be generalized to countries comparable to Denmark and Sweden in terms of their welfare system, sociocultural context, and quality and accessibility of healthcare. We could expect that the association between bereavement and AF would be stronger in countries with more limited resources for bereaved children or where adults rely to a larger extent on support from family than the state. Third, though the positive predictive value of the AF diagnoses in the Danish and Swedish patient register has been shown to be very high [24, 25], we may have missed (1) some mild AF cases and (2) AF diagnoses before the coverage of the Danish Hospital Register and the Swedish Patient Register with respect to specialized outpatient care became complete. Similarly, since information on psychiatric disorders was retrieved from specialized outpatient and inpatient care, we may have missed the milder forms of psychiatric diseases in our variables concerning parents\u2019 and family history of psychiatric disorders. Fourth, as information on cardiovascular medications was available only for individuals born after 2005 in Sweden, our possibilities to investigate the importance of antihypertensive or other medication in the studied association were limited."

            "text": "In this large bi-national cohort study, we found an association between death of a parent or sibling and an increased risk of AF. The finding that the association between bereavement in childhood was confined to natural deaths of the relatives suggests that confounding by familial cardiovascular factors or an interaction between familial cardiometabolic risk factors and stress is likely an explanation for this link. In contrast, the finding that losses due to unnatural causes in adulthood were associated with AF risk may be supportive of stress-related mechanisms for the link between bereavement and AF.\nAbbreviations AF Atrial fibrillation BMI Body mass index CI Confidence interval CVD Cardiovascular diseases DMBR Danish Medical Birth Register ICD International Classification of Diseases IRR Incidence rate ratio SMBR Swedish Medical Birth Register\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12916- 022- 02707-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1.
