    "abstractText": "Informationally complete (IC) positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) are generalized quantum measurements that offer advantages over the standard computational basis readout of qubits. For instance, IC-POVMs enable efficient extraction of operator expectation values, a crucial step in many quantum algorithms. POVM measurements are typically implemented by coupling one additional ancilla qubit to each logical qubit, thus imposing high demands on the device size and connectivity. Here, we show how to implement a general class of IC-POVMs without ancilla qubits. We exploit the higher-dimensional Hilbert space of a qudit in which qubits are often encoded. POVMs can then be realized by coupling each qubit to two of the available qudit states, followed by a projective measurement. We develop the required control pulse sequences and numerically establish their feasibility for superconducting transmon qubits through pulse-level simulations. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of a qudit-space POVM measurement on IBM Quantum hardware. This paves the way to making POVM measurements broadly available to quantum computing applications.",

For instance, IC-POVMs enable efficient extraction of operator expectation values, a crucial step in many quantum algorithms. POVM measurements are typically implemented by coupling one additional ancilla qubit to each logical qubit, thus imposing high demands on the device size and connectivity. Here, we show how to implement a general class of IC-POVMs without ancilla qubits. We exploit the higher-dimensional Hilbert space of a qudit in which qubits are often encoded. POVMs can then be realized by coupling each qubit to two of the available qudit states, followed by a projective measurement. We develop the required control pulse sequences and numerically establish their feasibility for superconducting transmon qubits through pulse-level simulations. Finally, we present an experimental demonstration of a qudit-space POVM measurement on IBM Quantum hardware. This paves the way to making POVM measurements broadly available to quantum computing applications.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033027\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSteady progress in the field of quantum technology, attested by continuing improvements in both quantum algorithms [1\u20133] and hardware performance [4,5], suggests that quantum computers may soon provide significant advantages over their classical counterparts in fields such as optimization, machine learning, finance, quantum physics, and chemistry. In particular, ab initio computational studies of molecular systems and materials represent natural areas of application for quantum computers [6\u201311]. These prospects have also attracted interest from the material and drug design industries [12,13].\nProof-of-principle experiments for small molecular systems have been successfully demonstrated on various quantum computing platforms [14\u201316]. Crucially, these applications should be extended to problem sizes of practical interest to reach the scale at which quantum advantage can be indisputably claimed. On current noisy hardware without error correction, the realizable circuit depths are limited by finite gate fidelities and qubit coherence times. Variational algorithms address these issues by leveraging classical resources in combination with, e.g., adaptive quantum protocols and effective sampling from parametrized quantum states [17,18]. For example, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) can\n*aur@zurich.ibm.com \u2020deg@zurich.ibm.com \u2021ita@zurich.ibm.com\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nbe used, among other applications, to obtain the ground state energy of molecules [19]. This is achieved by measuring the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for a trial state prepared with a parametrized ansatz circuit. By updating the parameters with a classical optimizer, the energy is minimized to approach the true ground state, in the spirit of the variational principle. A sufficiently good accuracy is only reached if the ansatz circuit is expressive enough to closely approximate the actual ground state. Moreover, the convergence of the classical optimizer can be obstructed by vanishing gradients and local minima, particularly under the influence of hardware noise [20]. Overcoming these issues [10,21\u201323] still leaves the large number of measurement shots needed to estimate the target observables as a major bottleneck of VQE [24]. This is commonly referred to as the measurement problem. For example, the small-scale molecular calculations of H2, LiH, and BeH2 reported in Ref. [14] required measuring O(109) quantum circuits. On larger problem instances, these requirements can grow unsustainably large; e.g., an estimate for the Fe2S2 complex predicts up to O(1013) required measurements per energy evaluation [25]. Even with the high sampling rate of superconducting quantum processors of up to 100 kHz, this task would take decades to complete. Circuit execution speed [26] and measurement number reduction are therefore crucial to variational algorithms.\nKnown strategies to alleviate the measurement problem include Pauli groupings [14,27\u201331], classical shadows [32\u201334], and machine learning [35]. Recent work suggests that informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) can also efficiently estimate quantum states and observables; for example, they achieve a near optimal scaling in the number of measurements for the reconstruction of fermionic reduced density matrices [36,37]. In the context of observable expectation value sampling, adapting the POVM to the target observable reduces the measurement overhead by\n2643-1564/2022/4(3)/033027(17) 033027-1 Published by the American Physical Society\none order of magnitude compared to a standard Pauli grouping in hydrogen chains with 14 qubits [38]. However, the experimental realization of IC-POVMs requires coupling each qubit representing the trial state to two additional quantum states [39]. Traditionally, this is done by coupling each qubit to an ancillary one before readout [38,40]. This approach doubles the number of necessary qubits during the measurement stage, and therefore halves the usable portion of a quantum chip. Moreover, the limited connectivity of most quantum architectures leads to a significant SWAP-gate overhead [41].\nIn this work, we conceptualize and implement a measurement scheme for IC-POVMs, which does not require ancilla qubits. Many quantum computing architectures encode qubits in two levels of a larger Hilbert space, e.g., the energetically lowest states of a transmon or two long-lived states of an atom or ion [42\u201344]. We use two additional states in this surrounding qudit space to realize programmable single-qubit POVM measurements. This requires the ability to distinguish four qudit states through projective measurements and a short pulse sequence coupling to the qudit states at the very end of a quantum circuit. As a result, the coherence and gate fidelity requirements of these additional states are much less stringent than for the qubit states.\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we propose a practical implementation of POVM measurements for qubits embedded in a qudit space. In Sec. III, we demonstrate an experimental implementation of our scheme on a superconducting qubit in IBM Quantum hardware. Finally, in Sec. IV, we show how qudit-based POVMs implemented in superconducting transmon hardware can sample operators with low variance through pulse-level numerical simulations."

            "text": "The POVM formalism describes general measurements of a state \u03c1S on a system Hilbert space HS. Formally, an M-outcome POVM is a set of M positive-semidefinite Hermitian operators 0, . . . , M\u22121 acting on HS which satisfy the completeness relation \u2211M\u22121 m=0\nm = 1, where 1 is the identity. Each operator m represents one possible outcome of the measurement that occurs with a probability\npm = Tr(\u03c1S m). (1) Standard projective measurements of an orthonormal basis of pure states |\u03c8m\u3009 form a special case of POVM measurements, where m = |\u03c8m\u3009\u3008\u03c8m|. A POVM measurement is informationally complete (IC) if every Hermitian operator O can be written as\nO = \u2211\nm\ncm m, cm \u2208 R. (2)\nIn this case, the probability distribution {pm} in Eq. (1) contains the full information about the state \u03c1S. In particular, {pm} suffices to compute the expectation value of O as\n\u3008O\u3009 = Tr(\u03c1SO) = \u2211\nm\ncm pm. (3)\nThis expectation value can thus be estimated from N samples drawn from the POVM outcome distribution as \u3008\u0302O\u3009 =\u2211\nm cmNm/N , where Nm denotes the number of times\noutcome m was observed. The error on this estimator is the standard error of the mean:\n2(\u3008\u0302O\u3009) = Var(O)/N = (\u2211\nm\nc2m pm \u2212 \u3008O\u30092 ) /N . (4)\nTailoring the POVM operators to the specific observable O and the state \u03c1S considerably reduces the corresponding variance Var(O) [38].\nGeneral POVMs on HS can be implemented by coupling to an extended space Hext either through a tensor product extension (TPE) Hext = HS \u2297 HA or a direct sum extension (DSE) Hext = HS \u2295 HA [39]. To realize POVM measurements, a specific unitary U is applied to Hext such that the probability distribution of a subsequent M-outcome projective measurement on Hext coincides with the POVM outcome distribution {pm} for the original state \u03c1S. Before applying U , the initial state on Hext is of the form \u03c1 = \u03c1S \u2297 \u03c1A in a TPE while in a DSE it has no support on HA. In both cases, the existence of U is guaranteed by Naimark\u2019s dilation theorem [45].\nWe consider IC-POVM measurements on N-qubit systems, specifically product POVMs where each global operator m is given by a tensor product of local single-qubit operators with M = 4 linearly independent operators each [39]. Such product POVMs are particularly suited for chemistry applications when using fermion-to-qubit mappings that lead to Hamiltonians of limited Pauli weight, such as the BravyiKitaev mapping [36,46]. This guarantees that the variances in Eq. (4) do not scale exponentially with the system size [38]. The global POVM then consists of 4N product operators, the minimal number required for informational completeness. Such POVMs are typically implemented in a TPE by coupling each of the N qubits to an ancilla qubit. The single-qubit POVM operators then define a two-qubit unitary U acting on the system and ancilla qubit. This can be accomplished with three controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates and single-qubit gates through Cartan\u2019s decomposition [47,48], which can also be improved by scaling pulses [49]. The relation between U and the POVM operators m is detailed in Appendix A 1.\nThe overhead of ancilla-based POVM implementations in a TPE, which doubles the qubit count, can be avoided if the qubit states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 are encoded in the higher-dimensional Hilbert space of a qudit. Instead of an ancilla, we use two additional states of the qudit space, denoted |2\u3009 and |3\u3009, which are not populated during the quantum circuit to realize a single-qubit POVM through a DSE (see Fig. 1). The states |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 may be higher-excited states of a superconducting transmon qubit [42] or additional states of the level structure in trapped ions [43] and neutral atoms [44]. We implement the POVM-encoding unitary U on the qudit space through a sequence of pulses that couple adjacent levels. This approach is suitable to architectures where an external drive with a dipole coupling is available, e.g., through microwave or laser pulses.\nWe now review the action of individual pulses and then decompose U into rotations generated by such pulses. Let H lf0 =\u2211d\u22121\nn=0 En|n\u3009\u3008n| denote the qudit Hamiltonian in its eigenbasis in the laboratory frame (lf). An external drive\n(t ) = (t ) cos (\u03c9Dt \u2212 \u03c6) (5)\n033027-2\nwith envelope (t ), drive frequency \u03c9D, and phase \u03c6 leads to an interaction Hamiltonian\nH lfint(t ) = (t ) d\u22122\u2211 n=0 gn|n\u3009\u3008n + 1| + H.c. (6)\nHere, gn denotes the coupling strength to the n\u2194n + 1 transition and we set h\u0304 = 1. By transforming into the rotating frame (rf) of the drive, and applying the rotating wave approximation (dropping terms rotating at 2\u03c9D), these Hamiltonians become\nH rf0 = d\u22121\u2211 n=0 (En \u2212 n\u03c9D)|n\u3009\u3008n| and (7)\nH rfint(t ) = (t )\n2 d\u22122\u2211 n=0 gne i\u03c6 |n + 1\u3009\u3008n| + H.c.

(9)\nHere, we assume that other transitions are far detuned. The qudit operator Gn\u2194n+1(\u03b8, \u03c6) applies a Givens rotation\nG(\u03b8, \u03c6) = (\ncos(\u03b8/2) \u2212i sin(\u03b8/2)e\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212i sin(\u03b8/2)ei\u03c6 cos(\u03b8/2)\n) (10)\nto the subspace spanned by |n\u3009 and |n + 1\u3009 and acts as the identity everywhere else. G(\u03b8, \u03c6) is a rotation of angle \u03b8 \u223c gn \u222b T 0 (t ) dt around an axis in the xy plane with a polar angle\ngiven by the drive phase \u03c6. The diagonal matrix in Eq. (9) imprints phases on all nonresonant states.\nWe further define generalized Zn\u2194n+1(\u03d5) rotations, that act as diag(e\u2212i \u03d5 2 , ei \u03d5\n2 ) on the states |n\u3009 and |n + 1\u3009 and as the identity elsewhere. Such generalized Z gates can be engineered from two Givens rotations [43]. For qubits, it is common to implement z rotations virtually by adjusting the phases \u03c6 of subsequent drive pulses [50,51]. We generalize this concept to virtually implement qudit-space Z gates, as detailed in Appendix A 3.\nWe construct the POVM-encoding unitary U from R rotations as in Eq. (9) by adapting an algorithm presented in Ref. [52] that decomposes U (up to remaining phases on the diagonal) into a sequence of Givens rotations Gn\u2194n+1(\u03b8, \u03c6), following a strategy similar to a QR decomposition [53]. We extend this algorithm in two ways. First, we add Z gates to the sequence to fully decompose U (including all relative phases) without increasing the number of pulses. Second, we replace the inaccessible G rotations in the decomposition of U with the realistic R rotations in Eq. (9), that include additional phases acquired by idle levels. We absorb these phases into the angles \u03c6 of the subsequent R pulses. The details of the decomposition algorithm of U into R gates are given in Appendix A. Here, we only quote our main result: The target unitary U can always be realized as a sequence of five R rotations:\nU = R1\u21942(\u03b85, \u03c65)R2\u21943(\u03b84, \u03c64) (11) \u00d7 R0\u21941(\u03b83, \u03c63)R1\u21942(\u03b82, \u03c62)R0\u21941(\u03b81, \u03c61).\nThe specific choice of the targeted POVM operators m enters through the angles \u03b8i and \u03c6i, while the order in which the transitions are driven is fixed and independent of the POVM.\nFinally, let \u221a X n\u2194n+1 denote a \u03c0/2 pulse around the x axis between the states |n\u3009 and |n + 1\u3009. Any R rotation can be realized by two \u221a X pulses and three virtual Z gates (see Appendix A 2). This has the great practical benefit that only the three pulses \u221a X 0\u21941, \u221a X 1\u21942, and \u221a X 2\u21943, rather than a parametrized family of pulses, require calibration. It is thus helpful to decompose the pulse sequence in Eq. (11) into\u221a X gates, shifting all angular dependencies into near-perfect virtual Z gates. Common calibration techniques applicable to the qudit-space pulses are readily available [54]. The resulting pulse sequence for the implementation of U requires a total of ten \u221a X pulses; see Fig. 1(c) for an example where each pulse is depicted with a Gaussian envelope.\nIII. IMPLEMENTATION IN SUPERCONDUCTING QUBITS\nWe now present and discuss experimental results of a qudit-space POVM measurement in a superconducting transmon qubit. Transmons are a popular qubit architecture as they enjoy long coherence times relative to the duration of their gates [4] and can gather measurements at elevated trigger rates, typically around 1\u2013100 kHz [26]. They are built from a nonlinear resonance circuit created by a Josephson junction shunted by a capacitor and are characterized by the ratio of the Josephson energy EJ to the charging energy EC, with EJ/EC 1 [55]. The spectrum of a transmon is described by an anharmonic oscillator, with the qubit encoded in the\n033027-3\nground state |0\u3009 and the first excited state |1\u3009. For details on this architecture see Appendix B."

            "text": "We propose to use the energetically next-highest states |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 in addition to the qubit states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 to implement qudit-based POVM measurements. With the decomposition in Eq. (11), we only need to drive transitions between adjacent states. In existing experimental setups, these states are accessed by switching the carrier frequency of the microwave drive pulses. Current IBM Quantum systems employ qubits with 0\u21941 transition frequencies of \u223c5 GHz and anharmonicities of \u223c \u2212 300 MHz. Drive pulses are generated by an arbitrary waveform generator with a sampling rate of 4.5 \u00d7 109 s\u22121 [56]. We can thus apply modulations to the carrier frequency of up to approximately \u00b11 GHz (still oversampling by a factor of 4.5). The carrier frequencies of \u223c4.7 and \u223c4.3 GHz required to address the 1\u21942 and 2\u21943 transitions, respectively, are thus well within the capabilities of our control hardware. Coherent control of the |2\u3009 state following this procedure has already found applications in excited state promotion readout [5,57], entanglement studies [58], gate decompositions [59,60], fast resets [61], and entangling operations [62].\nQudit-based POVM measurements require sufficient lifetimes of the higher-excited states. On typical transmon qubits, we observe that the decay from |3\u3009 occurs predominantly sequentially as |3\u3009\u2192|2\u3009\u2192|1\u3009\u2192|0\u3009, while transitions such as |3\u3009\u2192|1\u3009 are strongly suppressed (see Appendix B 2). This is in agreement with theory [63], and previous experiments [42]. For our purposes, coherence in |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 is only required during the POVM pulse sequence, which lasts a total of O(100 ns) using at most ten \u221a X pulses. With measured lifetimes of >25 \u03bcs for the |3\u3009 and |2\u3009 states, we do not expect the decay of higher-excited states to be a limiting factor.\nTransmons are dispersively measured by coupling them to a readout resonator [64]. Extracting the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) component of the transmitted signal results in a point in the IQ plane, which is then discriminated into |0\u3009 and |1\u3009. Dispersive readout can be extended to distinguish between the four qudit states [60]. Recently, separation of the lowest three states with fidelities >95% has been demonstrated experimentally [65].\nA challenge for qudit control of transmons is the charge dispersion of higher-excited states. The exact eigenenergies of all transmon states fluctuate under charge noise of the environment (see Appendix B 1). This effect increases exponentially for the energetically higher states posing a threat for high-fidelity pulses on the 1\u21942 and especially on the 2\u21943 transition. As a result, transition frequencies fluctuate considerably from one experimental run to another. For IBM Quantum hardware with EJ/EC \u223c 40, we observe that the 2\u21943 transition frequency varies by 15 to 20 MHz (see Appendix B 3). To ensure a resonant driving of the transition, the corresponding drive pulses thus need to cover a broad spectral range. This can be achieved by shortening the pulses, which typically increases phase errors and leakage to neighboring levels. Pulse shaping techniques such as Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) and advanced optimal control help\nalleviate this issue [66\u201368]. Furthermore, applying the POVM pulse sequence requires tracking the phases of idle levels. The acquired phases depend on the eigenenergies of each level, which are subject to charge dispersion. Conveniently, the unitary that encodes the POVM requires a single drive of the 2\u21943 transition [see Eq. (11)]. Hence, the |3\u3009 state is only populated once during the sequence, so that any phase uncertainty after the 2\u21943 pulse becomes irrelevant upon measurement in the qudit basis. Thus, whereas full coherent control of the |3\u3009 state is difficult to achieve, the relatively simple pulse sequence required for the POVM measurement is particularly robust to phase uncertainties of this state."

            "text": "As a proof-of-principle demonstration on IBM Quantum hardware, we implement a single-qubit IC-POVM which consists of the target POVM operators\n0 = 34 |\u03c80\u3009\u3008\u03c80|, 1 = 12 |+\u3009\u3008+|, 2 = 12 |0\u3009\u30080|, 3 = 14 |\u2212i\u3009\u3008\u2212i|,\n(12)\nwith |\u03c80\u3009 = (|0\u3009 + (i \u2212 2)|1\u3009)/ \u221a\n6. Three of the operators ( 1, 2, and 3) point along the Cartesian axes of the Bloch sphere, while 0 points into the octant which lies opposite of all other vectors [see Fig. 2(a)]. The unitary that encodes this POVM is realized with a sequence consisting of two\u221a X 0\u21941 gates, two \u221a X 1\u21942 gates, and one \u221a X 2\u21943 gate (see Appendix B 4). We use the standard single-qubit SX gate that comes with a highly calibrated DRAG pulse exposed to the user by IBM Quantum systems as the \u221a X 0\u21941 pulse. All further pulse-level calibrations and the POVM measurements are implemented through QISKIT\u2019s pulse module [69,70]. For the 1\u21942 and 2\u21943 transitions, we first calibrate the transition frequency with spectroscopy after preparing the initial states |1\u3009 and |2\u3009, respectively. For simplicity, we implement the \u221a X gates on these transitions with Gaussian pulses. We\nchoose a duration of 32 ns for the \u221a X 1\u21942 and 14 ns for\nthe \u221a X 2\u21943 pulse. These durations are shorter than the 36-ns standard single-qubit pulse to mitigate charge dispersion in higher-excited states by an increased spectral width. Simulations suggest that even shorter pulses are beneficial (see Appendix E). However, we find it more difficult to calibrate them. After fixing the pulse duration, we calibrate the angle of the rotations through sinusoidal fits to Rabi oscillations with varying pulse amplitudes. To calibrate the readout, we prepare and measure the states |0\u3009, |1\u3009, |2\u3009, and |3\u3009 separately through a sequence of appropriate \u221a X gates and use these data to perform a quadratic discriminant analysis leading to decision boundaries shown in Fig. 2(b). We find that this performs slightly better than a linear discriminant analysis. For each state, we obtain a characteristic signal that clusters in different regions of the IQ plane.\nWe investigate how well our pulse sequence along with the calibrated measurement implements the desired POVM with quantum detector tomography (QDT) [71,72], which characterizes the realized POVM operators. Hereby, a set of reference states is prepared and measured by our POVM implementation. We choose the set of single-qubit states |0\u3009, |1\u3009, |+\u3009, |\u2212\u3009, |i\u3009, and |\u2212i\u3009 for this purpose. From the\n033027-4\nobtained outcome distributions, shown in Fig. 2(c), the underlying experimental POVM operators can be estimated with a maximum-likelihood (ML) procedure, which guarantees that they form a valid POVM [73] (see Appendix D). Note that, on the Bloch sphere, the tomography states |\u2212\u3009, |1\u3009, and |i\u3009 lie opposite the POVM operators 1, 2, and 3, respectively. They should thus have zero measurement probability of the corresponding outcomes, which is attested by a noticeable lack of counts in the respective regions of the IQ plane in the raw data of Fig. 2(c). As a result, the operators obtained from the maximum-likelihood detector tomography are in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical target operators [see Fig. 2(d)].\nWe quantify the fidelity through the operational distance DOD [74,75], a measure on the POVM space, between the experimentally realized and the target POVM with 0 DOD 1 and DOD = 0 for coinciding POVMs (see Appendix C). The raw measurement data presented in Fig. 2(c) yield DOD = 0.22. We identify the overlap of the detection regions in the IQ plane between |1\u3009 and |2\u3009 and especially |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 as the main experimental limitation for qudit-based POVM measurements. Specifically, in our experiments, around one-quarter of the prepared states in |3\u3009 are identified as |2\u3009 and vice versa (see Table I). To mitigate misassignment errors, we apply readout error mitigation based on the inversion of the misassignment matrix, constrained to non-negative probability vectors [74]. Thereby, we can partially correct the measured raw data and achieve an improved DOD of 0.15 between the theoretical and the ML-estimated experimental POVM.\nThe difficulty to reliably distinguish the states |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 complicates the calibration of the average 2\u21943 transition frequency. At the moment, this renders the implementation of POVMs that require virtual Z2\u21943 gates infeasible. This motivates the choice of the POVM operators in Eq. (12) for our experiments, which are achievable with a slightly simplified\npulse sequence, compared to the most general case of Eq. (11) (see Appendix B 4). The measurement pulses used in our experiment are the default pulses provided by the back end, which are optimized for maximal separation of the |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 states. A large-scale implementation of qudit-space POVM measurements would require a more careful calibration of the readout pulses, which optimizes the separation of all four involved basis states. This would make the virtual Z2\u21943 gates feasible and improve the \u221a X 2\u21943 gate."

            "text": "In the previous section, we demonstrated a qudit-based POVM measurement on a quantum device with an EJ/EC ratio of \u223c45. This value was chosen for optimal qubit operation. However, the substantial charge dispersion in states |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 of the transmon suggests that larger EJ/EC ratios may be advantageous for qudit POVMs. This would sacrifice some anharmonicity to decrease the charge noise. We now quantitatively assess this trade-off through numerical pulse-level simulations, which account for both leakage errors due to finite anharmonicity and phase errors due to charge noise, but neglect readout misassignment errors.\nTABLE I. Measured readout assignment error probabilities when preparing the four qudit states of a transmon.\nPrepared\nMeasured |0\u3009 |1\u3009 |2\u3009 |3\u3009 |0\u3009 98.3 % 4.2 % 0.6 % 0.2 % |1\u3009 0.5 % 88.8 % 8.8 % 2.1 % |2\u3009 0.8 % 6.9 % 59.3 % 22.8 % |3\u3009 0.4 % 0.1 % 31.3 % 74.9 %\n033027-5\nWe start by probing how the achievable DOD depends on EJ/EC, using a single-qubit symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVM SIC as an example of a generic POVM. It consists of four operators mSIC = 12 |\u03c8m\u3009\u3008\u03c8m| with |\u03c80\u3009 = |0\u3009 and |\u03c8m\u3009 = (|0\u3009 + \u221a 2e2\u03c0 i(m\u22121)/3|1\u3009)/\u221a3 with m \u2208 {1, 2, 3} that point towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron [see Fig. 1(a)]. In contrast to the experimentally demonstrated POVM in Eq. (12), SIC requires implementing the pulse sequence from Eq. (11) in its full generality. We simulate this sequence with Gaussian pulse envelopes on a single transmon by numerically integrating the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. For details on how we model charge dispersion and calibrate pulses see Appendix E. As the EJ/EC ratio increases and charge noise becomes less prevalent, DOD( SIC, sim) decreases [see Fig. 3(a)]. While the DOD is limited to 0.1 for EJ/EC \u223c 40, it improves to 0.01 for EJ/EC \u223c 80. The change in anharmonicity with EJ/EC affects the duration of the pulse sequence that achieves the optimal DOD, as plotted in Fig. 3(b). In the low-EJ/EC regime, short pulses are favored as a broad spectral width is required to cover the large spread of the charge noise, and leakage is minimal due to the large anharmonicity. Conversely, with increasing EJ/EC, the anharmonicity of the transmon is reduced, which amplifies leakage. The optimal pulse durations thus increase with the ratio EJ/EC.\nThe longer the pulse sequence, the more it is subject to nonunitary processes like decoherence, which are not considered in our simulation. Consequently, there is a trade-off between the optimal durations of the pulses under unitary\ndynamics and noise induced by finite coherence times. We therefore limit the total duration of the POVM-encoding pulse sequence to different maximally allowed durations tmax [see Fig. 3(a)]. We find that, for fixed tmax, the DOD improves with increasing EJ/EC until an optimal ratio is reached after which the DOD gradually increases. In the parameter regime of current IBM Quantum hardware (EJ/EC \u223c 35\u201345), the optimal POVM pulse sequence time is \u223c100 ns. On this timescale, we do not expect decoherence to be significant (see Appendix B 2). For reference, single-qubit gates typically last 36 ns [56]. Finally, changing the transmon parameters also affects the conventional gates run in the quantum circuit prior to the POVM measurement. This is exemplified by the average gate fidelity F of a single-qubit 36-ns SX gate, which is shown in Fig. 3(c). As EJ/EC increases from 20 to 120 the gate fidelity decreases by roughly one order of magnitude due to the reduced anharmonicity.\nThe trade-off between anharmonicity and charge noise in a transmon qubit is a complex interplay of many factors, including coherence times, gate fidelities, and gate speed [55]. Our simulations suggest that, when taking qudit POVM fidelities into account, the optimal hardware regime shifts towards higher EJ/EC ratios. While this improves the quality of qudit-space POVM measurements, it comes at the expense of either slightly worse gate fidelities or slightly slower gate speeds, whose severity ultimately depends on the available coherence times. Optimal control methods may alleviate such issues [68]."

(1). However, due to device noise, the effective (experimental) channel that is applied to the qudits encodes a different POVM, denoted by expt, which slightly deviates from the theoretical one. In practice, expt defines the experimental measurement probabilities of the outcomes pexptm , while theo is used to obtain the decomposition of O with coefficients ctheom , as defined in Eq. (2). The combined estimator converges to \u3008\u0302O\u3009 = \u2211m ctheom pexptm , which differs from the theoretical expectation value due to the imperfections in the device, leading to a bias \u2211 m c theo m (p expt m \u2212 ptheom ).\nTo estimate the impact of this bias on practical applications, we study its effects on energy measurements of trained VQE ansatz states for small molecular Hamiltonians mapped onto four to eight qubits. As the target operators theo, we\n033027-6\nuse POVMs that minimize the variance for the respective Hamiltonians over the trial states as reported in Ref. [38]. These POVMs are simulated under charge noise for a device with EJ/EC = 45 (see Appendix E). The biases that arise from the device noise are shown in Fig. 4(a) (red bars). In most cases, we observe that charge noise creates biases that prevent energy estimations down to chemical accuracy.\nTo attenuate the large biases induced by the hardware noise, we propose an efficient error mitigation strategy in which the mismatch between theo and expt is reduced by means of quantum detector tomography [71,72]. This process allows an accurate estimation of the POVM operators that are actually implemented in the device, denoted by tomo. With this procedure, we first compute the decomposition of O into the operators of tomo, i.e., O = \u2211 m c tomo m m tomo, and\nthen use the new coefficients ctomom to estimate the expectation value as \u3008\u0302O\u3009 = \u2211m ctomom pexptm . With an increasing number of tomography shots, the OD between expt and tomo can be arbitrarily decreased (see Fig. 4). In turn, the systematic bias\u2211\nm c tomo m (p expt m \u2212 ptomom ) converges to zero for infinitely many tomography shots. The desired accuracy in a given application thus defines how many measurements should be dedicated to the detector tomography. Crucially, since the POVMs we consider are always products of single-qubit POVMs, the tomographic reconstruction can be carried out on all qubits in parallel. Thus, the overhead in the shot budget is constant, and we do not expect this process to hamper the scalability of qudit-based POVMs. Our simulations indicate that, even for current transmon hardware with EJ/EC \u223c 45, quditspace POVM measurements characterized through detector tomography are sufficiently accurate for quantum chemistry applications."

            "text": "Finally, we discuss whether the qudit POVM measurements in noisy conditions can be utilized to reduce the variance of an estimator of \u3008O\u3009. As an example, we consider the six-qubit Hamiltonian OLiH of a LiH molecule in the STO-3G basis obtained from the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping and investigate the number of shots needed to estimate the energy of a trained VQE state |\u03c8\u3009VQE within chemical accuracy (in the chosen basis set). We compare two situations where first, each qubit is measured using a SIC-POVM, and second, the qubits are measured by means of a product POVM that minimizes the variance of OLiH in the state |\u03c8\u3009VQE. In practice, such an optimized POVM can be efficiently obtained from an adaptive scheme [38], even if there is no prior knowledge of the state |\u03c8\u3009 available. For a given POVM, the variance of a specific observable is determined by its decomposition coefficients cm and the measurement probability distribution pm of the state [see Eq. (4)]. Namely, the second moment \u2211 m c 2 m pm determines the accuracy of the POVM-based estimator. In particular the outcomes m with both high absolute value of cm and high measurement probability pm contribute to . For the outcome distribution of the SIC-POVM, due to the symmetry of the POVM operators, the data are highly structured [see Fig. 5(a)]. The outcomes with highest probability attain high values of |cm|, which results in a large second moment of 80.86 hartree2. By measuring in an optimized POVM, even under charge noise, the second moment is considerably reduced to 1.59 hartree2. This approaches the optimum set by the squared first moment \u3008O\u30092 = 1.12 hartree2. This effect can be explained by inspecting the shape of the the distribution in Fig. 5(b), which shows a \u201csqueezing\u201d such that the most probable outcomes are associated with low absolute values of cm. This in turn leads to very large absolute coefficients for other outcomes, which, in contrast, have negligible measurement probability and thus hardly contribute to the variance.\nWe observe that with the generic SIC-POVM scheme about 3.5 \u00d7 107 shots are required to estimate \u3008OLiH\u3009 to within chemical accuracy. In contrast, only 3.1 \u00d7 105 shots are required when using the optimized POVM in a qudit-based scheme using a transmon affected by state-of-the-art charge noise. This number already includes 105 shots devoted solely to the detector tomography used for the bias mitigation discussed in Sec. IV A. With a circuit execution rate of 10 kHz, the optimized POVM reduces the measurement time from 1 h down to 30 s. It is important to note that in this application the mitigated bias lies well within chemical accuracy, as shown in Fig. 4. Based on this example, we conclude that quditspace POVM measurements constitute a valid, shot-efficient approach to estimate observables with high precision."

Our strategy makes optimal use of the available quantum resources in a system without requiring full qudit control\u2014a challenging task in general. We couple\n033027-7\nthe qubit states to the two additional levels of the surrounding qudit for only a short duration at the measurement stage of the quantum circuit. Therefore, only modest coherence and pulse fidelities are required. Compared to ancilla-based POVM implementations, we circumvent the doubling of the quantum register size and thus save half of the qubits on the chip, while also avoiding a considerable SWAP-gate overhead in case of limited device connectivity. The result is a protocol that is applicable to various qubit architectures including super- and semiconducting qubits, trapped ions, and cold atoms.\nFor a superconducting transmon qubit, we detailed an implementation of qudit-space POVM measurements, including a description of the decomposition into suitable elementary pulses between adjacent levels, and of the required calibrations. Specifically, we proposed ways to operate the necessary frame changes by tracking advances in relative phases, as well as generalizing the concept of virtual Z gates to the qudit space. Compared to the standard qubit setting, our proposal admittedly requires further calibrations involving the additional states. However, these calibrations can be performed on all qudits in parallel and are typically faster than two-qubit gate calibrations.\nExploiting the functionalities of QISKIT PULSE [69], we successfully performed a proof-of-principle experiment using the four lowest levels of a transmon in IBM Quantum hardware. We found that measurement misassignments are currently the main limitation of the proposed qudit-based POVMs, which prevents the scaling up to multiqubit implementations. This calls for a more thorough design and optimization of the shape and frequency of measurement pulses with the aim of obtaining a sufficient dispersive shift for all four qudit levels. Moreover, the importance of choosing the readout resonator frequency appropriately, such that no transitions\nbetween higher-excited states are accidentally resonant to the resonator frequency, has also been pointed out [42].\nFrom preliminary pulse-level simulations, we conclude that tuning the qubits deeper into the transmon regime would be beneficial to achieve optimal POVM fidelities, as this limits the impact of charge noise in the higher-excited states. Nonetheless, our results indicate that the implementation of qudit-based POVMs in state-of-the-art IBM Quantum hardware can significantly reduce the number of measurements required to estimate expectation values. To achieve this goal, we designed a shot-efficient strategy based on detector tomography to mitigate systematic errors arising from experimental imperfections.\nIn addition to operator averaging, informationally complete POVMs can be employed for other paradigmatic quantum information tasks, including state tomography [76] and the extraction of classical shadows [77]. In all these cases, our strategy offers a resource-effective route towards their implementation in state-of-the-art quantum processors. On a broader perspective, our results open up new opportunities to exploit the multilevel structure available on many different qubit architectures, thus contributing to the development of a richer operational toolbox, and extending the native capabilities of current quantum computing architectures."

In a tensor product extension (TPE), the four basis states of Hext are formed with an ancilla qubit as |0\u3009ext = |0\u3009S \u2297 |0\u3009A, |1\u3009ext = |1\u3009S \u2297 |0\u3009A, |2\u3009ext = |0\u3009S \u2297 |1\u3009A, and |3\u3009ext = |1\u3009S \u2297 |1\u3009A. In contrast, in a direct sum extension (DSE), the four states |i\u3009ext form a qudit space, where the qubit is encoded in the states |0\u3009ext \u2261 |0\u3009S and |1\u3009ext \u2261 |1\u3009S.\nFor simplicity, we assume a pure state of the system qubit |\u03c8\u3009S = \u03b1|0\u3009S + \u03b2|1\u3009S. A Naimark construction for both a TPE and a DSE applies a unitary U to the initial state |\u03c8\u3009init = \u03b1|0\u3009ext + \u03b2|1\u3009ext, to create the final state\nU |\u03c8\u3009init = 3\u2211\nm=0 (\u03b1Um,0 + \u03b2Um,1)|m\u3009ext. (A1)\nMeasuring U |\u03c8\u3009init in Hext produces an outcome m \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3} with a probability pm = |Um,0\u03b1 + Um,1\u03b2|2. This is equal to the probabilities pm = Tr( m|\u03c8\u3009S\u3008\u03c8 |S) associated with a POVM of four rank-one operators\nm = m|\u03c0m\u3009\u3008\u03c0m| (A2) acting on HS, which are proportional to projectors along the states\n|\u03c0m\u3009 = 1\u221a m\n( U \u2217m,0|0\u3009S + U \u2217m,1|1\u3009S ) (A3)\nwith normalization factors m = |Um,0|2 + |Um,1|2. Through Eqs. (A2) and (A3), the unitary U applied to Hext can emulate the measurement of any POVM with four rank-one operators on HS.\nSince the desired POVM only defines the first two columns of U , i.e., Um,0 and Um,1, we find the remaining columns with a Gram-Schmidt procedure to ensure U is unitary. Without loss of generality, for the decomposition algorithm presented in Appendix A 2, it is convenient to choose the top right element of U to vanish, i.e., U0,3 = 0."

            "text": "Here, we review the decomposition algorithm that we use to realize the unitary U with Givens rotations G and Z gates, as defined in the main text. Since this algorithm decomposes special unitary operators, we first define the SU(4) operator U (0) = U det(U )\u22121/4, which encodes the same POVM as U . The decomposition routine iteratively reduces U (0) to the identity matrix through a sequence of gates. We denote the unitary after the ith gate is applied to U (0) by U (i+1).\nThe reduction to the identity matrix is accomplished by creating zeros in the off-diagonal entries starting from the top entry in the fourth column [52]. Since by choice, the first entry U (0)0,3 is already zero, we create a second zero in the\nfourth column of U (1) with a Givens rotation G (0)1\u21942(\u03b81, \u03c61) that must satisfy G (0)1\u21942(0,U (0) 1,3,U (0) 2,3,U (0) 3,3 ) T = (0, 0,U (1)2,3,U (1)3,3 ) T . If U (0)1,3 = r1ei\u03b41 and U (0)2,3 = r2ei\u03b42 then the angles of the Givens rotation must be [52]\n\u03b81 = 2 arctan ( r1\nr2\n) and \u03c61 = \u03c0\n2 \u2212 \u03b41 + \u03b42. (A4)\nIn the next iteration, we similarly apply another Givens rotation such that G (1)2\u21943(0, 0,U (1) 2,3,U (1) 3,3 ) T = (0, 0, 0,U (2)2,3 ) T\n. Due to unitarity, the remaining nonzero entry is a phase factor U (2)2,3 = ei\u03b2 . A rotation Z (2)2\u21943 with an angle \u03d5z = \u22122\u03b2 sets the phase \u03b2 to zero. This finally results in the matrix\nU (3) = Z (2)2\u21943U (2) = \u239b\u239c\u239c\u239d \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\n0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 \u239e\u239f\u239f\u23a0 (A5) that has been reduced to a 3\u00d73 block. The above procedure is now repeated for the third column. This requires two Givens rotations and one Z rotation such that\nZ (5)1\u21942G (4) 1\u21942G (3) 0\u21941 ( U (3)0,2,U (3) 1,2,U (3) 2,2, 0 )T = (0, 0, 1, 0)T . (A6) Finally, applying the same strategy once more to the second column results in the identity matrix. Our initial choice of an SU(4) matrix ensures that the final phase of the top left entry vanishes.\nAs a result, applying the inverse of all gates in reverse order gives a decomposition (up to an irrelevant global phase) of the target unitary U into elementary operations of Givens rotations and (potentially virtual) Z gates:\nU = G (0)\u20201\u21942 G (1)\u20202\u21943 Z (2)\u20202\u21943 \u00d7 G (3)\u20200\u21941 G (4)\u20201\u21942 Z (5)\u20201\u21942 G (6)\u20200\u21941 Z (7)\u20200\u21941. (A7)\nTo simplify pulse calibrations, we restrict the gate set to virtual Z gates and the gates \u221a X = G(\u03b8 = \u03c02 , \u03c6=0) which describe a \u03c0/2 rotation around the x axis between the states |n\u3009 and |n + 1\u3009. A general Givens rotation G(\u03b8, \u03c6) can be exactly realized by a sequence of two \u221a X and three Z gates,\nG(\u03b8, \u03c6) = Z(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0 2\n) \u221a X Z(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8 ) \u221a X Z(\u2212\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0\n2 ),\n(A8)\nwhere we have omitted the subscripts n\u2194n + 1 [50]. Replacing every G gate in Eq. (A7) with the decomposition in Eq. (A8) results in a decomposition of U that only contains 10 \u221a X and 11 Z gates.\nFor a qudit-space POVM realization in realistic hardware we need to apply the sequence of G or \u221a X and Z gates through the hardware-native rotations R derived in Eq. (9) of the main text. It is sufficient to implement a unitary U\u0303 equivalent to the target unitary U as long as the same measurement probabilities for any initial qubit state are recovered. In Appendixes A 3 and A 4, we detail how to realize such an equivalent unitary U\u0303 with realistic R rotations.\n033027-9"

While the frequencies of the drives in these frames always remain fixed to the transition energies of the system such that \u03c9n = En+1 \u2212 En, the phases of the frames need to be adjusted to account for phase advances during R rotations and to virtually implement Z gates.\nAs an example of a Z rotation in qudit space, consider the gate\nZ1\u21942(\u03d5) = \u239b\u239c\u239c\u239d 1 0 0 0 0 e\u2212i \u03d5 2 0 0 0 0 ei \u03d5\n2 0 0 0 0 1 \u239e\u239f\u239f\u23a0, (A9) which applies a relative phase of \u2212\u03d5 between states |1\u3009 and |2\u3009. Therefore, an angle \u03d5 needs to be subtracted from the phase of all subsequent pulses played in the 1\u21942 frame. However, while the above gate leaves the levels |0\u3009 and |3\u3009 unchanged, it applies a relative phase of \u03d5/2 between the levels |0\u3009 and |1\u3009, as well as between |2\u3009 and |3\u3009. Hence, in addition to affecting all following phases in the 1\u21942 frame, an angle \u03d5/2 must be added to all drive phases in the 0\u21941 and 2\u21943 frames. In general, Zn\u2194n+1(\u03d5) gates can be virtually implemented by adding \u03d5/2 to all subsequent pulses in the n + 1 \u2194 n + 2 and n \u2212 1 \u2194 n frames while deducting a phase \u03d5 from the following pulses in the n \u2194 n + 1 frame."

The Hamiltonian of the circuit is\nH\u0302TM = 4EC(n\u0302 \u2212 ng)2 \u2212 EJ cos(\u03c6\u0302), (B1) where n\u0302 and \u03c6\u0302 are dimensionless conjugate variables describing the number of Cooper pairs on the capacitor and the superconducting phase across the Josephson junction, respectively [79]. The offset charge ng is a constant that results from capacitive coupling of undesired voltage sources due to imperfect isolation from the environment. We denote the Hamiltonian in its eigenbasis by H\u0302TM =\u2211 n En|n\u3009\u3008n|, where the qubit is encoded in the lowest-lying eigenstates |0\u3009 and |1\u3009.

However, the higher powers of \u03c6\u0302 create an anharmonic spectrum where the spacing of the eigenenergies is not equidistant, but decreases with higher levels. With the excitation energies \u03c9n = En+1 \u2212 En between adjacent levels, we define the anharmonicity \u03b1n = \u03c9n \u2212 \u03c9n\u22121, n 1, as the difference in adjacent transition frequencies.\nIn a realistic experimental setting, ng is subject to fluctuations called charge noise. This causes changes of the eigenenergies En which are periodic in ng [55] [see Fig. 6(a)]. The maximal difference in eigenenergies of\nn = |En(ng = 0) \u2212 En(ng = 1/2)| (B2) is commonly called the charge dispersion. Thus, under charge noise, the exact transition frequencies \u03c9n fluctuate, which creates phase errors [80]. Transmons mitigate this by increasing the ratio of EJ/EC, which decreases charge dispersion,\nas shown in Fig. 6(b). However, the charge dispersions in the |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 states remain at least one and two orders of magnitude larger than in the |1\u3009 state, respectively. As EJ/EC increases, the absolute value of the anharmonicity decreases [see Fig. 6(c)], which complicates driving the individual transitions due to leakage into adjacent levels and phase errors. The transmon relies on the fact that the charge dispersion decreases exponentially with EJ/EC while the anharmonicity is only reduced with a weak power law, making control at high EJ/EC favorable [55]. Therefore, IBM Quantum devices currently employ transmon qubits with EJ/EC \u223c 35\u201345, \u03c90/(2\u03c0 ) \u223c 5 GHz, and \u03b11/(2\u03c0 ) \u223c 300 MHz [56]."

The system is left to decay for a time t prior to a projective measurement which extracts the populations p(t ) from 1000 measurements at each time step (see Fig. 7).\nTo estimate the T1 times, we fit a model based on a multichannel rate equation d p(t )/dt = T p(t ). is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix that contains the decay rates i j associated with the decay from |i\u3009 to | j\u3009 and diagonal entries ii = \u2212 \u2211i\u22121 j=0 i j .

We measure the signal in the IQ plane as tRamsey is increased. This results in oscillations at the difference between the drive frequency and the true 2\u21943 transition frequency [see Fig. 8(a)]. Transforming the signal into Fourier space reveals that the oscillation is a beating between two contributing frequencies f1 and f2 [see Fig. 8(b)]. This can be attributed to quasiparticle tunneling across the qubit junction\n[42,81]. While repeating the Ramsey sequence 50 times, the two frequency components f1 and f2 fluctuate symmetrically around a center frequency f of \u223c13 MHz [see Fig. 8(c)]. This represents the average detuning of the applied drive pulses. In total, these data suggest that the true frequency of the 2\u21943 transition fluctuates by as much as 15\u201320 MHz. For this particular qubit with a frequency of \u03c90/(2\u03c0 ) = 5.2 GHz and an anharmonicity of \u03b11/(2\u03c0 ) = \u2212340 MHz, a direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian from Eq.

            "text": "In an experiment that performs a quantum measurement, the implemented POVM operators can be characterized through quantum detector tomography (QDT) [71,73]. In combination with the better known quantum state tomography (QST) and quantum process tomography (QPT), QDT is required for a full specification of a quantum experiment [72]. In QST an unknown state \u03c1 is estimated from measurements in a known set of reference POVM operators { mref}. By contrast, in QDT the unknown POVM operators { m} are estimated from a known set of prepared reference quantum states {\u03c1 iref}. As in QST, there is the concept of informational completeness: For a full characterization of { m} through QDT, the reference states {\u03c1 iref} need to span the operator space of m [72]. One possible set of such states for single-qubit POVMs are projectors on the six single-qubit stabilizer states {|0\u3009, |1\u3009, |+\u3009, |\u2212\u3009, |+i\u3009, |\u2212i\u3009} which are the eigenstates of \u03c3z, \u03c3x, and \u03c3y, respectively. This is a convenient choice since the initialization in |0\u3009 and subsequent single-qubit rotations to either of these states can be implemented with high fidelity on existing quantum processors. The POVM measurement is carried out on each such reference state, sampling from the probability distributions p( j)m = \u3008\u03c8 j | m|\u03c8 j\u3009. Let N ( j)m be the number of times outcome m \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3} is recorded for initial state |\u03c8 j\u3009. One way to obtain an estimator for the underlying single-qubit POVM operators is to invert the system of linear equations\n\u3008\u03c8 j | m|\u03c8 j\u3009 \u223c N ( j) m\u2211\nm\u2032 N ( j)m\u2032\n(D1)\nto obtain the entries of m. This approach suffers from the fact that the obtained POVM operators might be nonphysical, as they are not necessarily positive. An analogous issue exists for QST through linear inversion of Eq. (D1) [82]. Positivity can be enforced with a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation by maximizing the likelihood functional\nL ( 0, 1, 2, 3 ) = \u220f m, j (\u3008\u03c8 j | m|\u03c8 j\u3009)N ( j) m (D2)\nunder the constraint that the operators m form a valid POVM [73]. As laid out in Ref. [83], the optimization can be performed with an iterative algorithm that converges to the ML estimator. This procedure has recently been demonstrated experimentally on IBM hardware as a means to mitigate readout noise [74,84]. In this work, we make use of ML quantum detector tomography to reconstruct the implemented POVM operators both for the verification of the experimental proof of principle in Sec. III B and for the simulations of our error mitigation scheme in Sec. IV A."

            "text": "In this Appendix, we summarize the technical details of the numerical simulations from Secs. III C and IV. Transmons are modeled by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (B1). This Hamiltonian is diagonalized in the charge representation after truncating to 20 Fourier modes in the superconducting phase \u03c6\u0302 to obtain the low-energy spectrum [79]. The parameters EJ and EC are then adjusted to fix the base frequency of the qubit (at ng = 0) at 5 GHz. The dynamics of the system under a drive as defined in Eq. (5) are modeled by the interaction Hamiltonian from Eq. (8), where we assume the relative coupling of a harmonic oscillator, i.e., gn \u221d \u221a n + 1, and truncate the system at d = 5 levels. To implement a desired POVM, we decompose the cor-\nresponding target unitary into a sequence of \u221a X pulses with virtual Z gates. For simplicity, we employ Gaussian pulse envelopes with a standard deviation of one-quarter of the pulse duration. The pulses feature a piecewise constant envelope with a sample duration of 222 ps, matching IBM control hardware [56]. The transition frequencies depend on ng, whose exact value fluctuates from one experimental run to another. We model ng to be uniformly distributed as p(ng) \u223c Uni([0, 1]), which is sufficient due to the periodicity of the eigenenergies with ng (see Fig. 6). Each pulse is played at the average transition frequency \u03c9n = \u222b 1 0 p(ng)\u03c9n(ng) dng. The pulse amplitudes are chosen such that the resulting rotation angles for the average transition frequency are \u03c0/2.\nWe model the quantum dynamics of a state \u03c1 under a pulse sequence by an effective channel\nE : \u03c1 \u2212\u2192 \u222b 1\n0 p(ng)U (ng)\u03c1U (ng)\n\u2020 dng, (E1)\nwhere U (ng) are the unitary dynamics for a fixed offset charge ng. We obtain U (ng) under a sequence of pulses with an integrator of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation provided by QUTIP [85]. The channel E is numerically approximated by computing U (ng) for 20 values of ng equally spaced between 0 and 1.\n033027-13\nF (\n\u221a\nX ) in the qudit space relevant for the POVM encoding as a function of the gate duration for selected values of EJ/EC. (d) Optimal times\ntopt that maximize F ( \u221a X ) for different EJ/EC.\nTo calibrate \u221a X pulses in the simulation, we keep the amplitude fixed while varying the duration of the pulses. The target unitary of such a pulse is given by the implemented rotation U tar = R(\u03d5 = \u03c0/2, \u03b3 = 0), defined in Eq. (9), which includes phases that are accumulated in the idle levels. As a figure of merit, we compute the average gate fidelity F (E,U tar ) between the target unitary and the channel of the simulated unitary under charge noise [86]. We hereby restrict the computation of F (E,U tar ) to the subspace that is relevant for the POVM pulse sequence. Recall that the POVMencoding unitary is always realized with pulses that couple adjacent levels in the order 0\u21941, 1\u21942, 0\u21941, 2\u21943, and finally 1\u21942. Since the |3\u3009 state is only populated once prior to measurement, the phases acquired by |3\u3009 during a 0\u21941 and 1\u21942 gate do not affect the encoded POVM operators. The fidelities of \u221a X 0\u21941 and \u221a X 1\u21942 are thus only computed over the subspaces spanned by |0\u3009, |1\u3009, and |2\u3009. Similarly, only the |1\u3009, |2\u3009, |3\u3009 subspace is considered for the fidelities of \u221a X 2\u21943 since no 0\u21941 pulses are applied after the 2\u21943 pulse. The average gate fidelities for different hardware parameters as a function of the pulse duration are shown in Fig. 10. For short durations, the broad spectral range of the pulse leads to leakage errors. In contrast, for long pulse durations, the phases accumulated over time by the idle levels become difficult to track due to charge noise. The infidelities 1 \u2212 F ( \u221a X ) thus typically show a distinct minimum where these two effects are traded off optimally. As EJ/EC increases, this\noptimum shifts towards longer gate durations [see Fig. 10(d)]. For reference, the default single-qubit SX gate in current IBM Quantum hardware is carried out with DRAG pulses of a duration of 36 ns. We find that it is important to employ much shorter pulses when including the phase uncertainty of a neighboring state, despite our use of simple Gaussian pulse envelopes, which are not specifically designed to correct for leakage errors (especially for the \u221a X 2\u21943 gate). This suggests that phase uncertainties in higher-excited states have an overall bigger impact on the qudit gate fidelities than leakage. The remaining leakage errors could be further reduced by a careful calibration of DRAG pulses. For current hardware (EJ/EC \u223c 35\u201345), our simulations suggest achievable gate fidelities in the relevant qudit spaces that reach up to 99.9% for the \u221a X 0\u21941 and \u221a X 1\u21942 gates, and 98% for \u221a X 2\u21943. This can be improved by over an order of magnitude by tuning deeper into the transmon regime (e.g., EJ/EC \u223c 60), at the expense of increased gate durations.\nFor our simulation of the full POVM pulse sequences in Secs. III C and IV, we employ the durations of the \u221a X n\u2194n+1 pulses that maximize their respective fidelities. When limiting the total duration of the sequence as in Fig. 3(a), we incrementally shorten those pulses whose fidelity is affected the least. This is repeated until a pulse sequence is obtained which is at most as long as the desired total length. From the implemented channel E of the pulse sequence, we finally obtain an effective POVM sim as the average over the POVM operators encoded by the unitaries U (ng).\n[1] D. Grinko, J. Gacon, C.
