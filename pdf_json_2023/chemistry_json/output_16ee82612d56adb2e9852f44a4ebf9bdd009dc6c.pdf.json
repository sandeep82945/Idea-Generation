    "abstractText": "A series of five naturally occurring oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids, namely, the coumarins auraptene (7-geranyloxycoumarin) 1 and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin 2, and the coumaric acid and ferulic acid derivatives, 4\u2032-isopentenyloxycoumaric acid 3, boropinic acid 4, and 4\u2032-geranyloxyferulic acid 5 were tested for their effects on mitochondrial functionality using the organophosphate pesticides glyphosate and chlorpyrifos, and resveratrol, as the reference. While not showing an appreciable in vitro antioxidant activity, and virtually no or a little effect on the viability of non-cancer cell lines BEAS-2B and SHSY-5Y, all phytochemicals exhibited a marked protective effect on mitochondrial potential and activity, with values that were comparable to resveratrol. Auraptene 1 and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin 2 were seen to be the most effective secondary metabolite to this concern, in particular in being able to completely abolish the decrease of mitochondrial potential induced by increasing concentration of both glyphosate and chlorpyrifos. All the compounds tested also exhibited a protective effect on mitochondrial activity. The potency displayed will shed more light on the molecular basis of the beneficial effects of auraptene, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin, and structurally related oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids reported to date in the literature.",

These secondary metabolites have been recognized in the last twenty-five years as promising and valuable biologically active phytochemicals in several therapeutic areas such as oncology, neuroprotection, inflammation, stroke, cardiovascular disorders, microbial infections, dermatology, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and several others. Until now, approximately 350 compounds have been isolated and structurally characterized from plants, primarily belonging to the families Rutaceae and Apiaceae, which in turn comprise several edible vegetables and fruits, fungi, protozoa, and bacteria. As a continuation of our ongoing studies aimed to gain further insights into the pharmacological profiles and potentialities of naturally occurring oxyprenylated secondary metabolites and their semisynthetic derivatives, we decided to investigate the effects of five selected sample plant compounds, namely auraptene 1, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin 2, 4\u2032-isopentenyloxycoumaric acid 3, boropinic acid 4, and 4\u2032-geranyloxyferulic acid 5 on mitochondrial functionality stressed by the application of increasing concentrations (10\u2013100 \u00b5M) of organophosphate pesticides such as glyphosate and chlorpyrifos.

In particular, their main mitogen stimuli on mitochondria are represented by a massive induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [44,45]. In detail, it has been seen how glyphosate, through the increased production of ROS (in particular hydrogen peroxide was found to be the main product of this oxidative burst) led to huge reductions in the proton gradient and ATP levels. On the other hand, chlorpyrifos was shown to induce via the mentioned ROS generation mitochondrial fragmentation via reduction of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 1, a massive decrease of the membrane, and a marked decrease in ATP production.

The compounds selected are the most representative and most abundant O-prenylphytochemicals occurring in nature and are compounds that have also received the most detailed investigations. Previous studies about the interaction of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids and\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 259 9 of 14\nmitochondria reported the activity of only auraptene 1. Data in the literature concerning these appears to be somewhat controversial. Thus, the first observation to this concern dates back to 2006, when Jeong and coworkers reported that compound 1, extracted from the aerial parts of Dictamnus albus L. (Fam. Rutaceae, common names \u201cburning bush\u201d, \u201cdittany\u201d, or \u201cfraxinella\u201d) showed a slight and potently selective inhibitory effect against monoamino oxidase (MAO)-B (IC50 = 0.6 \u00b5M,) compared to MAO-A (IC50 = 34.6 \u00b5M), both representing two flavin-containing enzymes located in the outer mitochondrial membrane [49]. However, these authors did not refer further about potential applications both in in vitro and in vivo pharmacological models. In 2007 Jun and coworkers highlighted that this O-prenylcoumarin, extracted from the leaves of the Chinese medicinal plant Zanthoxylum schinifolium Siebold & Zucc. (Fam. Rutaceae, common name \u201cmastic-leaf prickly ash\u201d), was able to induce apoptosis in human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells. However, this effect was given by an interaction of auraptene with endoplasmic reticulum. This in turn stress-mediated the activation of resident caspases 12 and 8 and led to the subsequent and final involvement of mitochondrial structures by the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases 9 and 3. This cascade of events provided Jurkat T cells apoptosis. Consequently, the paper by Jun and coworkers described only an indirect interaction between auraptene 1 and mitochondria [50]. In 2013 Nagle and coworkers indicated that the biomolecular mechanism underlying this effect consisted in the inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1\u03b1 activation, thus suppressing mitochondria-mediated hypoxic signaling [51]. A similar finding was reported in 2015 by Jang and coworkers [52]. These authors reported that compound 1 acted as a mitochondrial poison in RCC4 (human renal carcinoma) cancer cell lines and found that auraptene abolished RCC4 cells motility through a marked decrease of mitochondrial respiration and of the expression of glycolytic pathway-related genes expression. Furthermore compound 1 strongly disrupted vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Aurpatene also impeded the hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a), well known nowadays to play a key role in the metabolism of cancer cells, as well as migration, and, more importantly, angiogenesis. This process in particular is stably expressed and active in RCC4 cells due to a resident genetic mutation in the von Hippel\u2013Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein. In particular, such a blockade could contribute to the observed suspension of RCC progression. Thus, results and outcomes form this last study showed that auraptene may represent a beneficial compound being able to counteract cancer progression, while in the one reported by Nagle and coworkers, the same effects by compound 1, were seen in a negative light with regard to its claimed cancer chemo-preventive properties. In 2019, Jang and coworkers described for the first time results in which auraptene exerted protective effects against the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration [53]. In particular, these authors pointed out that compound 1 markedly protected dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra from rotenone (another well-known pesticide and mitochondrial poison) evoked a boost of ROS and overall mitochondrial oxidative damage. Auraptene also massively induced the expression of antioxidant enzymes Jang and coworkers tested auraptene also in vivo. In detail, 1 was assessed recording the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting step enzyme in the biosynthesis of dopamine, in the striatum and substantia nigra of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease model mice and behavioral changes after injection of the same auraptene. Treatment with compound 1 largely ameliorated movement, in manner consistent with the observed increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Data by Jang and coworkers led to the hypothesis that auraptene may target dual pathogenic mechanisms by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and attenuating ROS production. These findings could account for the observed ameliorating effects of oxyprenylated coumarin in subjects affected by Parkinson\u2019s disease. Similar beneficial effects by compound 1 were recorded in 2021 by Akashi and coworkers [54]. These authors found that an extract of the Japanese fruit Citrus x hassaku Hort. Tanaka enriched in auraptene (>80%) strongly increased the expression of the proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) in skeletal muscle. In\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 259 10 of 14\nparticular, auraptene, administered in the diet for five weeks with the enriched extracts to C57BL/6J mice, provided a large increase of PGC-1\u03b1 and overall mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle fibers to oxidative fibers. Furthermore, the auraptene-enriched extract increased the expression of the protein sirtuin 3, of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and of the transcriptional activity of PGC-1\u03b1. Considered as a whole, the findings by Akashi and coworkers led tem to hypothesize that auraptene, as part of the phytocomplex from C. hassaku, may mediate PGC-1\u03b1 expression in skeletal muscles and may serve as a dietary supplement to prevent metabolic disorders, as previously demonstrated in other in vitro and in vivo models. Based on the observed results, which can be summarized in an increased metabolism of sugars and lipids and their catabolism at the mitochondrial level, the authors stated that auraptene could represent an efficient means for the dietary chemoprevention of metabolic disorders. Finally, the last acquisition in the literature was reported in the same year by Lee and coworkers, who described how auraptene was able to enhance junction assembly in cerebrovascular endothelial cells by exerting beneficial effects against mitochondrial stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes, in the same way as observed by Jang and coworkers, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) [55]. In particular, these authors highlighted that the increase of the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes induced by auraptene provided a parallel increase of the expression of the junctional proteins occluding, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Compound 1 was also able to depolarize mitochondrial membrane potential leading to the activation of mtUPR. The capacity by auraptene to protect the brain against ischemia was also assessed using cells deprived of oxygen and glucose. Thus, pretreatment of these cells with compound 1 prevented the damage to junctional proteins, including occludin, claudin-5, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin. A stress resilience response regulated by increased levels of mRNAs related to Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) 5, Lon Protease (LONP) 1 and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 60 was also observed. As a conclusion, Lee and coworkers stated that auraptene is an efficient promoter of resilience against oxidative stress at a mitochondrial level, helping to maintain intact barriers in cerebrovascular endothelial cells. This brief survey of the already reported literature acquisitions seems to indicate how apparently contrasting results about the interaction of an oxyprenylated phenylproanoid such as auraptene with mitochondria have been reported in the literature. In some cases, disruptive outcomes have been recorded, while in the most recent studies, a protective role has been highlighted. However, this discrepancy may derive from the fact that different targets at a mitochondrial level have been selected. When assayed on HIF-1a and associated cell responses, auraptene led to negative effects, leading to huge disorders in mitochondrial functions. In this case, no stress stimuli have been administered to mitochondria. For the investigations reported in the literature between 2019 and 2021, such a stimulus (represented by a pesticide or ROS) was applied. In this context, compound 1 acted to improve the content of antioxidant enzymes, to increase the extent of biogenesis of mitochondria, and finally to restore the mitochondrial potential as the main biomolecular pathways. In line with what has been reported earlier and just mentioned, results obtained in the present study are a confirmation of the protective effects of auraptene on mitochondria when exposed to stress stimuli, represented herein by the organophosphates pesticides chlorpyrifos and glyphosate. Such positive effects have been exerted not only by auraptene itself, but also by other oxyprenylated coumarins such as 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin. Such findings have been reported in the literature herein for the first time. On the other hand, p-coumaric and ferulic acids derivatives 3\u20135 cannot be claimed as protective agents on mitochondrial functions, as the recorded results are rather controversial. Thus, in terms of structure-activity relationship considerations, the presence of a coumarin core may be a determinant for the observed effects. Results reported in the present investigation may represent an effective boost to investigating the effects of a wider panel of naturally occurring oxyprenylated coumarins as protective agents for mitochondria stressed by mitogen stimuli.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 259 11 of 14\nBoth auraptene 1 and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin have been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects, also in terms of amelioration of symptoms and clinical significance associated to the development and progress of Parkinson\u2019s disease [13,14]. In the meantime, pesticides, including glyphosate [56] and chlorpyrifos [57], have been claimed to be possible causes of neurodegenerative diseases in humans upon chronic exposure with the effective involvement of mitochondria and associated disruption. Data reported in the present paper are a valid contribution in trying to explain and clarify the mechanism of action underlying the observed and reported properties of compounds 1 and 2 as neuroprotective and anti-Parkinson\u2019s disease agents."
