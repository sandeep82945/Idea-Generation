    "abstractText": "Acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and electro-optical modulator (EOM) are applied to realize the all-fiber current sensor with a pulsed light source. The pulsed light is realized by amplitude modulation with AOM. The reflected interferometer current sensor is constructed by the mirror and phase modulation with EOM to improve the anti-interference ability. A correlation demodulation algorithm is applied for data processing. The influence of the modulation frequency and duty cycle of AOM on the optical system is determined by modeling and experiment. The duty cycle is the main factor affecting the normalized scale factor of the system. The modulation frequency mainly affects the output amplitude of the correlation demodulation and the system signal-to-noise ratio. The frequency multiplication factor links AOM and EOM, primarily affecting the ratio error. When the frequency multiplication factor is equal to the duty cycle of AOM and it is an integer multiple of 0.1, the ratio error of the system is less than 1.8% and the sensitivity and the resolution of AFOCS are 0.01063 mV/mA and 3 mA, respectively. The measurement range of AFOCS is from 11 mA to 196.62 A, which is excellent enough to meet the practical requirements for microcurrent measurement.",

            "text": "The all-fiber optic current sensor (AFOCS) can measure the current accurately based on the Faraday effect and Ampere circuital theorem [1]. AFOCS has many advantages, such as excellent insulation characteristics, simultaneous measurement of AC and DC, flexible sensor diameter, and digital output [2]. It has gradually replaced electromagnetic current transformers in the fields of pulsed current measurement [3], ultra-high voltage electrical network [4], and plasma current measurement [5]. The AFOCS is essential and will play a critical role in the smart grid [6]. Learning from the fiber optic gyroscope principle, the AFOCS also uses a continuous wide spectrum light source to reduce the coherence length, restrict the influence of backscattered light, and improve the signal-to-noise signal ratio of the system [7]. However, some applications need a pulsed light source, such as to suppress the backscattered light [8], suppress power frequency interference in AC measurement applications [9], and the weak current measurement with the fiber loop architecture [10]. Therefore, research of AFOCS with pulsed light sources has essentially practical significance. Currently, there are two types of pulsed light sources. One is the laser diodes. Zhang et al. use laser diodes as pulsed light sources to study the loop structure with single-polarization single-mode couplers [11]. The other type is the pulsed light source generated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Du et al. use AOM for pulse regulation when studying the sensitivity of all-fiber optic current with recirculating loop structure [12]. These methods both adopt the polarimetric current sensor. However, the optical system of the polarimetric current sensor has the disadvantage of the weak anti-interference ability, which is an enormous challenge in practical engineering.\nSensors 2022, 22, 430. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020430 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nIn this paper, an optical interferometer current sensor with pulsed light is constructed to suppress external interference and restrict the influence of backscattered light. An electro-optical modulator (EOM) is applied to phase modulation. AOM is used to generate the pulsed light source simultaneously. Under the dual modulation of AOM and EOM, AFOCS with pulsed light is conducted. This article mainly talks about the relationship of modulation signal between AOM and EOM. In a particular case, when the frequency multiplication factor is equal to the duty cycle of AOM while the frequency multiplication factor is an integer multiple of 0.1, the sensitivity and the resolution of AFOCS are 0.01063 mV/mA and 3 mA, respectively. The ratio error is less than 0.3%, which can meet the requirement of microcurrent measurement applications, such as partial discharge detection [13] and leakage detection [14]. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the principle of operation. The optical design and data processing method are also discussed in this section. In Section 3, we model and simulate to explore the influence of modulation parameters on AFOCS. An experiment is established to verify the correctness of the theory in Section 4. The conclusion is in Section 5."

            "text": "The polarization state of the polarized light is adjusted by the magnetic field generated by the current to be measured. The rotation angle of the polarization plane is proportional to the electric current based on the principle of the Faraday effect [15]. AOM is applied to generate a pulsed light source based on a reflective interferometer current sensor. The structure of AFOCS is shown in Figure 1.\nThe black dotted line represents single-mode optical fiber, which mainly realizes energy transmission. The orange dot-dash line represents the polarization-maintaining fiber, which can reduce the influence of environmental factors on the polarization state. The spun highly birefringent fiber is applied as the sensing fiber, which is shown as the solid black line in Figure 1. The green arrow line represents the electrical signal transmission, including photoelectric signal conversion, modulation signal generation, and data processing. The current-carrying wire is the light blue line, as shown in Figure 1. The principle is as follows. Continuous light of the superluminescent diode will be modulated to pulsed light by AOM. The frequency of pulsed light is adjustable, and the amplitude of pulsed light is the same as continuous light. After passing through the circulator, the pulsed light is sent to the polarizer, and then it will change into linearly polarized light. The polarized light will convert into two linearly polarized light beams when the optic axis of the polarizer and EOM is aligned with a 45\u25e6 offset.Therefore, the input polarized light will be equally launched into both polarization modes. These two linearly polarized lights are orthogonal and convert into left-handed and right-handed circularly\npolarized light after passing through the quarter-wave plate. The phase velocities of the two circularly polarized light beams are different when they pass through the magnetic field generated by the electric current to be measured. The Faraday rotation angle is applied to represent the rotation angle of the polarization plane. The Faraday rotation angle is doubled when the circularly polarized light beams come back in the same optical path when the mirror reflects them. The circularly polarized lights convert into linearly polarized light when they pass through the quarter-wave plate. Finally, the interference occurs at the polarizer. The light intensity with electric current information is sent to the photodetector through the circulator and processed by the data processing system. EOM is used to modulate the phase and improve the sensitivity of AFOCS. The modulation frequency is related to the optical path length, which is adjusted by the polarization-maintaining delay fiber and sensing fiber [16]. When the action of AOM is not considered, the light power detected by the photodetector is [1]\nP(t) = P0 \u00b7 1 + cos[\u03b8 \u2212 \u2206\u03d5(t)]\n2 (1)\nHere, P0 is proportional to the source power. \u2206\u03d5 denotes the phase difference modulated by EOM and \u03c4 represents the transmission delay in the fiber. \u03d5(t) is the modulated signal in the forward transmitting direction, \u03d5(t + \u03c4) expresses the modulated signal in the backward transmitting direction with \u03c4 time delay. \u03b8 = 4NVI denotes the Faraday rotation angle, N is the number of turns of the sensing fiber coil wrapped around the current-carrying wire. V represents the Verdet constant related to the material of sensing fiber, the working wavelength of the light source, and the operating temperature [17]. I expresses the electric current to be measured.\nThe modulation signal of AOM is a periodic gate signal.\nx(t) = {\n1 ntd + t \u2264 t0 + ntd 0 others\n(2)\nHere, t \u2265 0. td and t0 represent the period of the modulation signal and the pulse width, respectively. The duty cycle of the modulation signal is RD = t0/td. n denotes a positive integer, which expresses the number of pulse repetition periods.

The principle of correlation detection is shown in Figure 3.\nThere are two channels in the phase-sensitive detector (PSD): the signal and reference channels. The electric signals from photodetector (P\u2032(t)) and signal generator (r1 = sin \u03c90t) enter the signal channel and reference channel, respectively. The output of PSD (up(t)) is the product of these two input signals. A low-pass filter (LPF) is applied to eliminate the difference-frequency and sum-frequency terms. We define another essential parameter as the duty cycle correlation coefficient. The duty cycle correlation coefficient m0 is the ratio of duty cycle to frequency multiplication factor.\nm0 = RD\nk (13)\nHere, RD and k denote the duty cycle and the frequency multiplication factor as previously defined, respectively. If m0 is a positive integer, which indicates the frequency multiplication factor is related to the duty cycle. Otherwise, the frequency multiplication factor is not related to the duty cycle.

When the duty cycle is from 10% to 99% and the frequency multiplication factor is from 0.1 to 2, the relationship between the ratio error and the duty cycle or the frequency multiplication factor is shown in Figure 4. The ratio error changes with the duty cycle and the frequency multiplication factor, as shown in Figure 4. However, it is difficult to obtain the mathematical relationship directly from Figure 4. Therefore, we will analyze the duty cycle and frequency multiplication factor separately to get a clear connection with the ratio error.\n3.1.1. The Effects of Frequency Multiplication Factor\nWe fix the duty cycle of AOM and simulate the relationship between the ratio error and the frequency multiplication factor. The Faraday rotation angle is \u03b8 = 0.125 rad. \u03b8 is the angle when we compute the faraday rotation angle by Equations (16) and (17). The modulation signal of EOM is a sine wave with a modulation frequency of 50 kHz and an amplitude of 0.9205 V. The modulation signal of AOM is a square wave signal with a duty cycle of 50%. The relationship between ratio error and frequency multiplication factor is shown in Figure 5.\nWhen the modulation frequency of AOM is greater than that of EOM (k > 1), the ratio error of the system decreases with fluctuation. When the modulation frequency of AOM is smaller than that of EOM (k < 1), the ratio error of the system fluctuates with frequency. When k is less than 0.8, a subplot is drawn to describe the relationship between ratio error and frequency multiplication factor within Figure 5 with the red line. There are some peak points where the ratio error is more prominent than 100%. There are also many trough values on the waveform simultaneously, which will be described later. When 0.9 < k < 1.1, there is a maximum that AFOCS can not be applied. This phenomenon can be explained as follows. When the Fourier series of the square wave signal is expanded, there is an unavoidable spectrum leakage. The Fourier series expansion of the square wave contains only the first harmonic when the modulation frequency of the AOM is the same as that of EOM. Finally, there is some energy leakage. When the duty cycle is 50%, the relationship between the Fourier series expansion of the periodic signal and the original signal is shown in Figure 6. The black line is the original square wave signal, and the red line is the fitted signal with the sum of the odd number harmonics, as shown in Figure 6. When the number of harmonics is minor, the square wave signal is quite different from the fitted signal. The matched signal tends to be a square wave signal as the Fourier series increases. The frequency multiplication factor equals the duty cycle as a particular case. The relationship between ratio error and frequency multiplication factor is shown in Figure 7.\nWhen the frequency multiplication factor is equal to the duty cycle of AOM, some troughs will appear periodically, as shown in Figure 7a. When the frequency multiplication factor is an integer multiple of 0.1, the system ratio error will be less than 0.1%, except the frequency multiplication factor equals 0.5, as shown in Figure 7b, which can also be explained as previously with the energy leakage.\n3.1.2. The Effects of Duty Cycle\nWe fix the frequency multiplication factor of AOM and simulate the relationship between the ratio error and duty cycle. The frequency multiplication factor is 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5. The duty cycle is from 10% to 99%, and the interval is 1%. The other parameters of the simulation are the same as Section 3.1.1. The relationship between ratio error and the duty cycle is shown in Figure 8. The ratio error is minimum when the frequency multiplication factor (except 0.5) is an odd multiple of 0.1, and the duty cycle is integral multiples of 0.1. When the frequency multiplication factor is 0.5, the minimum ratio error will occur when the duty cycle equals 50%. When the frequency multiplication factor is an even multiple of 0.1, and the duty cycle is integral multiples of 0.2, we will also get the minimum ratio error, as shown in Figure 8. Therefore, when the multiplication factor equals duty cycle, and both are the integral multiple of 0.1, the minimum ratio error will be obtained, which is consistent with the above analysis results in Section 3.1.1."

If km 6= 1 or km = 1, but the frequency multiplication factor is related to the duty cycle, the relationship between the normalized scale factor and the duty cycle is shown in Figure 10. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the normalized scale factor has a linear relationship with the duty cycle. This phenomenon can be explained by energy. As the duty cycle of AOM increases, the light power detected by the system increases steadily. Therefore, the normalized scale factor rises as the energy received by the detector increases.\nBased on Figures 9 and 10, we can conclude that the main factor affecting the normalized scale factor is the duty cycle of AOM, and the frequency multiplication factor is weakly related to the normalized scale factor."

The duty cycle of the AOM is from 5% to 100%, and the\ninterval is 5%. The relationship between the normalized scale factor and the duty cycle is shown in Figure 12.\nThe normalized scale factor of the system increases with the duty cycle, which is consistent with the simulation results in Figure 10. The duty cycle of 100% is the continuous light, which has the most significant normalized scale factor. We introduce the dispersion coefficient to characterize the relationship between duty cycle and system anti-interference ability. The dispersion coefficient is defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean value. The electric current to be measured was 2 A, and we eliminated the influence of zero bias. The dispersion coefficient of the Faraday rotation angle was calculated and normalized. The relationship between the normalized dispersion coefficient and the duty cycle is shown in Figure 13.\nWhen the duty cycle is less than 50%, the normalized dispersion coefficient decreases rapidly with the increase of the duty cycle, as shown in Figure 13. We can conclude that the anti-interference ability of the system increases with the duty cycle in this case. When the duty cycle exceeds 50%, the decrease of normalized dispersion factor is not apparent, and raising the duty cycle can not improve the anti-interference ability of the system effectively. This phenomenon can be explained by energy. When the duty cycle increases, the light energy detected the photodetector increases accordingly. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio and anti-interference ability of the system increases with the light power. However, when the light intensity reaches a certain level, it is impossible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and anti-interference ability by increasing the optical energy [21].\n4.2.2. The Effect of the Frequency Multiplication Factor\nWe fixed the duty cycle and tested the impact of the frequency multiplication factor on the optical system. The duty cycle of AOM was 50%. We outputted the electric current with amplitude modulated by DC stabilized power supply. The software screenshot of the demodulation result of the lock-in amplifier is shown in Figure 14.\nThe frequency multiplication factor is 0.3, 0.7, and 0.9. The range of the electric current is 11 mA to 96 mA, and the interval is 5 mA. The measured data is filtered by the moving average filter and fitted by the polynomial fitting method. The observed and fitted values are shown in Figure 15.\nThe fitted value has good linearity with the measured value, as shown in Figure 15. The normalized scale factor and the ratio error were obtained by calculation, and the result is given in Table 2.\nThe normalized scale factor is nearly the same when the duty cycle is fixed at 50%, as shown in Figure 15a and Table 2. Therefore, we can conclude that the duty cycle is the main factor that affects the normalized scale factor, which is consistent with the simulation in Section 3.2 and the experiment results in Section 4.2.1. When the duty cycle of AOM equals frequency multiplication factors, and the frequency multiplication factor is an integer multiple of 0.1, the ratio error is small, as shown in Figure 15b and Table 2, which is consistent with the previous analysis in Section 3.1.\nThe sensitivity of AFOCS is the slope of the fitting curve, which is 0.01063 mV/mA when the duty cycle is 90%, and the frequency multiplication equals the duty cycle of AOM. The lock-in amplifier determines the resolution. The output range of the lock-in amplifier is \u00b110 V, and the D/A conversion is 18 bit [22]. The resolution of AFOCS is about 3 mA by computing. The measurement range of AFOCS is 11 mA to 196.62 A by calculation."
