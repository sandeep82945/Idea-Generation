    "abstractText": "Mindfulness has long been concerned and emphasized by scholars in the field of psychology, but there is still a lack of research on mindfulness in management in China. In this study, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 483 employees in the new media industry in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou, China. After modeling and analysis, it was found that employee mindfulness has a positive influence on innovative behavior. Employee mindfulness and innovative behavior are mediated by positive emotions. Employee mindfulness and innovative behavior are mediated by work engagement. Employee mindfulness and innovative behavior are mediated by a chain of positive emotions and work engagement. Enterprise managers should improve the level of mindfulness of employees in the new media industry through mindfulness training and courses for mindfulness training, create an organizational environment that can arouse positive emotions and improve the positive emotions of employees, pay attention to arousing the enthusiasm of the staff, and promote the innovative behavior of staff while enhancing work engagement.",

In order to meet the needs of the public, new media practitioners not only need to have various professional skills, but also need to have the ability to innovate. Employees in the new media industry inevitably encounter various high demands in their daily work (Dediu et\u00a0al., 2018), which greatly reduce their innovative behavior and willingness while affecting their mood as well as their work status (Mart\u00edn-Hern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0 al., 2020). The innovative behavior of employees is essential for the sustainability of the organization (De Jong and den Hartog, 2010; Mart\u00edn-Hern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2020). How to cultivate, develop, stimulate, and utilize the innovative ability of employees in the new media industry is an issue that managers should pay attention to.\nMindfulness is a relatively new concept in psychological research (Keng et\u00a0 al., 2011), which refers to \u201cawareness and observation of the present moment without responsiveness or judgment\u201d (Glomb et\u00a0 al., 2011). As the study progressed, researchers found that mindfulness also plays a huge role in the field of management (Good et\u00a0al., 2016), especially in enhancing employees\u2019 innovative behavior. When mindfulness helps employees to slow down and concentrate (Hensley, 2020), it enables people to retain useful and relevant information, which, in turn, increases the ability of individuals to generate new ideas (Montani et\u00a0al., 2018) and innovative behavior (Khan and Abbas, 2022). In addition, studies have found that positive emotions (Wang Z. et\u00a0al., 2021) and work engagement (Montani et\u00a0al., 2020) also play an important role in enhancing employees\u2019 innovative behavior. On the one hand, employees with positive emotions have a wide range of ideas (Isen, 1993) and are not afraid of the risks and challenges brought by innovation (Schwarz and Bohner, 1996), so they are more likely to carry out innovative activities. On the other hand, employees with high work engagement are more focused on their work (Amabile, 1997), and will stimulate their initiative and put more ideas into action (Pieterse et\u00a0al., 2010), thus stimulating their innovative behavior. Mindfulness as a trait has a significant positive impact on regulating employees\u2019 emotions (McLaughlin et\u00a0al., 2019) and enhancing employees\u2019 work engagement (Leroy et\u00a0 al., 2013). According to resource conservation theory, mindfulness is found to be\u00a0 beneficial in helping employees store, perceive, and utilize individual resources, and when employees\u2019 own resources are increased, it stimulates and enhances positive emotions (Du et\u00a0al., 2019; Alhawatmeh et\u00a0al., 2022) as well as work engagement (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Leroy et\u00a0al., 2013), thus promoting the occurrence of innovative behaviors of employees.\nCurrently, the literature researching the role between employee mindfulness and innovative behavior is scarce. The existing literature mostly starts the analysis from the aspects of creative process engagement (Khan and Abbas, 2022) and\nsubjective well-being (Liu et\u00a0al., 2020a,b). Positive emotions and work engagement are important internal factors to stimulate employee innovative behavior (Amabile et\u00a0al., 2005; Kim and Park, 2017; Jung and Yoon, 2018), but almost no scholars have analyzed the mechanism of the interaction between mindfulness and innovative behavior, and no one has taken employees in the new media industry as the research object. The vigorous development of the new media industry is inseparable from innovation. Therefore, this study explores the relationship among employee mindfulness, positive emotion, work engagement, and innovative behavior through empirical research, which is of great significance to stimulate the innovation ability of employees in the new media industry and the innovation level of enterprises."

            "text": "Employee mindfulness and innovative behavior\nMindfulness, originally derived from the meditation training of Buddhism, mainly refers to the intensity of individual attention (Jacobs and Blustein, 2008). Research on mindfulness is generally divided into trait mindfulness and state mindfulness (Randal et\u00a0al., 2015). State mindfulness can be\u00a0changed due to internal and external environmental stimuli and lasts for a short time (Liu et\u00a0al., 2022a), and this state is not fixed (Said and Tanova, 2021). Trait mindfulness is a tendency to remain stable over time, that is, individuals actively and consciously pay attention to the surrounding environment and remember relevant useful information, so that the mind can focus more on the objects related to the goal and be\u00a0more determined (Wang X. et\u00a0al., 2021). The improvement of innovative behavior of employees is exactly the stimulation of trait mindfulness. This study mainly analyzes and studies long-term and sustained behavioral effects, and therefore investigates mindfulness as a trait.\nInnovation refers to the new integration of the knowledge owned by individuals and the new knowledge acquired, which can enable enterprises to obtain new opportunities more effectively and rationally utilize existing opportunities (Matzler et\u00a0al., 2013). Innovative behavior often occurs at the individual level (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). When individuals are creative, they can not only complete their work better, but also help enterprises gain competitive advantages in an uncertain environment (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). As a trait, employee mindfulness is an important factor affecting their innovative behavior (Mulligan et\u00a0al., 2021). On the one hand, mindfulness can improve individual alertness and cognitive flexibility (Good et\u00a0al., 2016; Van gelderen et\u00a0al., 2019). The flexible cognition generated by mindfulness supports adaptation by generating novel ideas and responses (Good et\u00a0al., 2016), while alertness helps individuals maintain extensive external attention and capture important information, thereby reducing error rate and enhancing their ability to generate new\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nideas (Dane and Brummel, 2014). On the other hand, mindfulness reduces automatic responses and enhances attentional breadth (Dane and Rockmann, 2020). When mindfulness helps individuals to focus (Hensley, 2020), it will make them retain useful and relevant information, so as to have a deeper understanding of the problem, and then generate more flexible new ideas (Montani et\u00a0al., 2018; Khan and Abbas, 2022).\nAccording to social cognitive theory, individual psychological traits can influence individual behavior (Bandura, 1986). Mindfulness is an individual\u2019s internal perception of inner changes or inner emotional changes caused by external stimuli (Brown and Ryan, 2003). Innovation behavior is a phased process, including not only the generation of new ideas, seeking support for individual innovation ideas, but also the implementation of new ideas (Scott and Bruce, 1994). Previous studies have confirmed that mindfulness positively affects innovative behavior (Jobbehdar Nourafkan et\u00a0al., 2022; Khan and Abbas, 2022). In conclusion, we\u00a0make the hypotheses:\nH1: Employee mindfulness has a significant positive impact on innovative behavior.\nEmployee mindfulness, positive emotion, and innovative behavior\nEmotion is a physiological arousal state and a cognitive state corresponding to this arousal state (Schachter and Singer, 1962). People\u2019s emotions in the face of various things in life reflect people\u2019s evaluation of these things (Diener et\u00a0al., 1999). Emotions include both positive and negative emotions (Watson and Tellegen, 1985). At present, negative emotions have been studied by many psychologists, and some scholars say that studying positive emotions is also very important (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2014). Positive emotion is often a transient emotional experience, which is an individual\u2019s response to meaningful events in life (Fredrickson, 2001). Individuals with high levels of positive emotions show more flexible thinking, faster conversion speed, and accept a wider range of behavioral choices (Kahn and Isen, 1993). In essence, negative and positive emotions are incompatible, but experiments have shown that positive emotions can reduce or eliminate reactions caused by negative emotions (Fredrickson, 1998; Fredrickson, 2001). At the same time, people can improve their mental resilience and mental health by cultivating positive emotions at appropriate times, thus promoting their physical health (Fredrickson, 2000). Mindfulness is not only a way of emotion regulation, but also a kind of emotion regulation ability. Previous studies have shown that mindfulness is closely related to emotion regulation (Lutz et\u00a0al., 2014; McLaughlin et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2022b), in which there is a spiraling process between mindfulness and positive emotions, that is, by improving individual mindfulness, people with positive emotions will generate more positive emotions in the future, and the increase of positive emotions predicts more mindfulness (Du et\u00a0al., 2019).\nNumerous studies have shown that positive emotions positively predict employees\u2019 innovative behavior (Madrid et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2014; Wang Z. et\u00a0al., 2021; Caniels et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2022). The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions can expand the scope of an individual\u2019s immediate thinking actions by constructing more enduring personal resources such as psychological, social, physical, and intellectual resources to provide more sustainable adaptive benefits for the development provided by the individual (Fredrickson, 2001). On the one hand, individuals under the influence of positive emotions can flexibly adjust their cognitive state and improve the level of thinking activity (Madrid, 2020), thus generating extensive and diverse ideas, which is often the source of individual innovative behaviors (Isen, 1993). On the other hand, positive emotions, as a comfortable state, can make individuals not afraid of risks and challenges in the process of innovation, show amazing expansion of thinking in urgent problems (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2022), and enhance the exploration of new procedures, so as to carry out innovative activities (Schwarz, 1990; Schwarz and Bohner, 1996). In addition, positive emotions also expand the attention range of individuals (Fredrickson and Branigan, 2005), which enables individuals to guide their behavioral responses more effectively. When individuals are in a state of positive emotion, they are more likely to choose more challenging goals (Cardon et\u00a0al., 2009) and motivate them to act in an innovative way and make more efforts (Caniels et\u00a0al., 2022).\nAccording to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (Fredrickson, 2001), mindfulness promotes the generation of positive emotions and further improves the cognitive flexibility and attention of individuals, thus expanding the scope of instant thinking and action of individuals and generating innovative behaviors. Previous studies have confirmed the mediating effect of positive emotions between mindfulness and creativity (Chen et\u00a0al., 2022). Based on this, we\u00a0propose the following three hypotheses:\nH2: Positive emotions play a mediating role in the relationship between employee mindfulness and innovative behavior.\nH2a: Employee mindfulness positively affects positive emotions.\nH2b: Positive emotions positively affect innovative behavior.\nEmployee mindfulness, work engagement, and innovative behavior\nWork engagement is an active state of work, characterized by concentration, energy, and dedication (Schaufeli et\u00a0al., 2002). As a good working attitude (Rahman and Karim, 2022), work engagement not only affects organizational commitment (Ahmad and Gao, 2018), employee job satisfaction (Van Tuin\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2021), and turnover intention (Cao and Chen, 2021), but also has an important influence on organizational citizenship behavior (Ismael et\u00a0al., 2022) and innovative behavior (Bakker et\u00a0al., 2014), which is one of the basic factors influencing the results and attitudes of various behaviors in the workplace (Han et\u00a0al., 2021).\nInnovation is a dynamic and complex process, and the stimulation of innovative behavior requires individuals not only to possess certain professional knowledge, ability, and motivation, but also to invest a lot of energy and time in continuous trial and error and improvement (Amabile, 1997). It has been found that the employee\u2019s work engagement can promote innovative behavior (Hakanen et\u00a0al., 2008; Zhang and Bartol, 2010). On the one hand, employees with high work engagement are more focused on their work, and they will continue to finish their work when faced with difficulties or bottlenecks, such concentration and persistence are the sources of promoting their creativity (Amabile, 1997). On the other hand, high work engagement will reduce employees\u2019 stress (Britt et\u00a0al., 2001) and promote an increase in positive emotions (Hakanen et\u00a0al., 2008), which will further stimulate their initiative and put more ideas into action. Thus, more innovative behaviors are generated (Pieterse et\u00a0al., 2010). Mindfulness can enhance engagement in activities or work by increasing the vividness and clarity of an individual\u2019s experience (Brown and Ryan, 2003), helping employees to \u201caccept\u201d what is known and change their perspective (Shapiro et\u00a0 al., 2006; Carmody et\u00a0 al., 2009), and making employees more focused on their work and maintain interest in it, thus stimulating employees\u2019 innovative behavior (Sonnentag, 2003).\nConservation of Resource Theory holds that individuals are motivated to use and invest resources (Hobfoll, 1989). When initial resources are abundant, individuals will make full use of existing resources and put them into subsequent activities or work (Hobfoll, 2011; Halbesleben et\u00a0al., 2014). However, when initial resources are relatively scarce, individuals are vulnerable to the risk of resource loss, which leads to more cautious use of resources. Mindfulness is an internal resource possessed by individuals (Grover et\u00a0al., 2017; Montani et\u00a0al., 2018; Fisher et\u00a0al., 2019). It can help individuals store energy and enhance their awareness of other resources so that individuals can perceive more alternative resources (Kroon et\u00a0al., 2015) and make good use of resources in subsequent activities (Shapiro et\u00a0 al., 2006; Good et\u00a0 al., 2016). Therefore, when employees experience high mindfulness, they will devote more resources to their work, making them more focused, and the resulting high level of work engagement will further promote the occurrence of innovative behavior. Previous studies have confirmed that mindfulness can enhance individual concentration and immersion and has a positive correlation with work engagement (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Leroy et\u00a0al., 2013). Meanwhile, work engagement has a promoting influence on increasing employee innovative behavior (Rich et\u00a0al., 2010; Aryee et\u00a0al., 2012; Kim and Park, 2017; Jung and Yoon, 2018), but fewer studies have used work engagement as a mediator to\nstudy employee mindfulness and innovative behavior. Thus, we\u00a0propose the following three hypotheses:\nH3: Work engagement plays a mediating role in the relationship between employee mindfulness and innovative behavior.\nH3a: Employee mindfulness positively affects work engagement.\nH3b: Work engagement positively affects innovative behavior.\nPositive emotion and work engagement\nWork engagement is a pleasant state of mind associated with one\u2019s job (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004), which essentially contains a series of positive emotions (Ouweneel et\u00a0 al., 2012b). The broaden-and-build theory for positive emotions holds that positive emotions can not only bring instantaneous expansion of individual thinking activities, but also help individuals build long-term and abundant individual resources (Fredrickson, 2001), and the increase in individual resources is usually caused by positive emotional experience. This side effect will increase the motivation, initiative, and enterprising spirit of the individual (Schaufeli et\u00a0 al., 2002). When employees are in a positive emotional state, they will positively evaluate and experience their work and surrounding environment, thus stimulating the behavior of absorbing new information, experience, and exploration, and in this process, expand themselves and become more engaged in their work to achieve their goals (Forgas, 1995). Therefore, individuals with positive emotions are more inclined to increase their personal and job resources and devote them to work (Ouweneel et\u00a0al., 2012a). Scholars have confirmed that positive emotions have an important positive influence on employees\u2019 work engagement (Leavitt et\u00a0al., 2019; Wu and Wu, 2019; Ameer and Zubair, 2020; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2020).\nIn addition, according to the conservation of resource theory, mindfulness is conducive to the storage, perception, and utilization of individual resources, and when employees\u2019 own resources are increased, it will stimulate and enhance employees\u2019 positive emotions (Du et\u00a0 al., 2019; Alhawatmeh et\u00a0 al., 2022) and work engagement (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Leroy et\u00a0al., 2013), which will promote the occurrence of employee innovative behavior.\nHence, we\u00a0propose the following hypothesis:\nH4: Positive emotions positively affect work engagement.\nH5: Positive emotion and work engagement play a chain mediating role between employee mindfulness and innovative behavior.\nTo summarize, Figure\u00a0 1 shows the research model and hypothesis established in this study.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org"

In this study, employees in the new media industry are defined as employees engaged in relevant enterprises (such as Weibo, WeChat, webcast, short video, etc.) that use Internet technology as the media of information dissemination. According to China Statistical Report on Internet Development, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou are the five cities with good economic development and the most listed Internet companies (China Internet Network Information Center, 2021). Research has found that economic development and Internet penetration rate are both important driving forces to promote the development of new media industry (Guo and Fang, 2022). Therefore, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou were selected as sample collection sites in this study.\nQuestionnaire Star,1 one of the largest questionnaire collection platforms in China, is a professional survey distribution platform. In the collection of questionnaires, in order to ensure the authenticity of the questionnaire recovery, the questionnaire must be\u00a0filled by a real-name user (the questionnaire fillers are informed in advance that it is only for academic research and will not involve any privacy), and each user can only fill in the questionnaire once. The participants of the questionnaire\n1 https://www.wjx.cn\nresponded more positively to the collection of the online questionnaire (Huang et\u00a0al., 2016), and the online questionnaire can not only expand the sample size, but also improve the reliability and validity of the sample (Cao et al., 2021). Therefore, this study adopts online questionnaire to conduct convenient sampling of employees in the new media industry in these five cities. Convenient sampling is easy to implement and has the advantage of saving time and cost. Previous studies have also confirmed the effectiveness of convenient sampling based on online questionnaire (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThe questionnaire consists of two parts. The first part contains four scales of employee mindfulness, positive emotion, work engagement, and innovative behavior, and the second part contains relevant information of the questionnaire fillers. A total of 550 questionnaires were collected in this study, of which 483 were valid, with an effective rate of 87.82%. There were 310 females (64.2%) and 173 males (35.8%). In terms of age, the number of people aged 26\u201335 was the largest (36.2%). In terms of marital status, 52.8% of employees were married. In terms of education, the largest number of people had a bachelor\u2019s degree (48%). The number of people who had worked for more than 10 years was the highest in terms of working years (34.2%). In terms of jobs, the proportion of ordinary employees (Ordinary employees are employees in non-management positions) was up to 60.7% (see Table\u00a01 for details)."

            "heading": "Theoretical significance",
            "text": "First, most previous studies on workplace employees have focused on state mindfulness (e.g., Olafsen, 2017; Said and\nTanova, 2021), which focuses on the antecedents of state mindfulness. However, there are few studies on employee trait mindfulness. Trait mindfulness is a personal trait that focuses more on how it affects work outcomes as a predictor (Wang X. et\u00a0al., 2021). This study confirmed that trait mindfulness is initiated by a top-down mechanism (Wang Z. et\u00a0al., 2021), in which employees are conducive to the occurrence of innovative behavior. This study has helped spark researchers\u2019 interest in the effects of trait mindfulness on employee behavior and attitudes.\nSecondly, previous antecedent studies on employees\u2019 innovative behavior have focused on external factors, such as external environment, leadership influence, leadership style, and the exchange relationship between leaders and subordinates (Dhar, 2016; Leitch and Volery, 2017; Hoang et\u00a0 al., 2022). However, these studies ignore the vulnerability of external factors to other factors (such as the closeness of the relationship between enterprise managers and employees; Kim et\u00a0al., 2021) and the importance of internal factors. Studies show that positive emotions and work engagement, as positive mental states of individuals, play an important role in improving their innovative behavior. This study helps us to understand the influencing factors and influencing mechanism of employee innovation behavior from the perspective of internal factors of employees, and further enriches the theoretical development of innovative behavior.\nFinally, although previous studies have explained the importance of mindfulness in improving innovative behavior among employees (Jobbehdar Nourafkan et\u00a0al., 2022; Khan and Abbas, 2022), but very little is known about how it works. This study uses a research model to clarify how mindfulness improves the operating mechanism of employees\u2019 innovative behavior, thus helping enterprises gain competitive advantages. This study supports the theory of resource conservation, in which individuals are motivated to use and invest resources. Studies have shown that mindfulness, as an individual trait, can help employees store resources and enhance the perception, discovery, and utilization of other resources (Good et\u00a0al., 2016), by stimulating employees\u2019 positive emotions, more resources will be\u00a0put into work, which will greatly enhance employees\u2019 focus and cognitive flexibility, so as to promote the occurrence of innovative behavior. Few scholars have studied the chain mediating effect of positive emotions and work engagement on the relationship between mindfulness and employees\u2019 innovative behavior, let alone employees in the new media industry. This study not only broadens the research scope of employee mindfulness, but also deeply analyzes the mechanism of employee mindfulness in the new media industry on innovative behavior, which has important theoretical contributions."

Scholars have pointed out that specific forms of practice, training, and experience can help employees skillfully focus their attention on specific work environments (Hulsheger et\u00a0al., 2013). At the same time, some scholars have proposed that mindfulness training for employees can help them focus on the present (Dane and Brummel, 2014), improve performance, and reduce employee pressure (Allen et\u00a0al., 2015), etc. Employees in the new media industry will inevitably meet various high requirements in their work (Dediu et\u00a0al., 2018). The huge work pressure will have a direct impact on employees\u2019 emotions and work status, and then affect employees\u2019 innovative behavior. Therefore, the management department of the new media industry can improve the mindfulness level of employees in the new media industry through mindfulness training and mindfulness training courses. At the same time, enterprise managers can also incorporate mindfulness into employee training programs and conduct regular training so as to regulate employees\u2019 emotions and work status and lay the foundation for stimulating employees\u2019 innovative behavior.\nSecondly, current research results show that positive emotions have a positive effect on improving employees\u2019 innovative behavior. Therefore, enterprise managers can improve employees\u2019 positive\nemotions by creating an organizational environment that can evoke positive emotions. In the organizational environment, both work and non-work factors may trigger emotional reactions of employees. Therefore, managers in the new media industry can stimulate employees\u2019 positive emotions by creating a relaxed and free working atmosphere, giving positive feedback and encouragement to employees\u2019 work achievements or phased progress, and improving family welfare, and leaders\u2019 care and encouragement. At the same time, they strengthen emotion management ability training, so that new media industry employees can form a stable positive mood, so as to stimulate employees\u2019 innovative behavior.\nFinally, work engagement has a positive effect on employees\u2019 innovative behavior, which is another important finding of this study. This finding indicates that managers in the new media industry should attach importance to arousing the enthusiasm of employees. On the one hand, managers can improve the autonomy and enthusiasm of employees by optimizing the work process and content and paying attention to the design of work, enable employees to gain a sense of accomplishment and excitement in the process of work, enhance their enthusiasm and investment in work, and promote their innovative behavior. On the other hand, managers should recognize and encourage employees\u2019 innovative behavior and achievements and provide certain material rewards in addition to spiritual incentives, so as to guide work engagement to produce more innovative achievements.\nLimitations and future research directions\nThis paper discusses the relationship between mindfulness and innovative behavior among employees in China\u2019s new media industry. Although some valuable research conclusions and practical implications have been obtained, there are still some deficiencies and limitations.\nFirstly, the research object of this paper is employees in the new media industry, but employees in different industries have different individual characteristics. Therefore, future research can target employees in different industries to conduct research on mindfulness and innovative behavior. Secondly, convenience sampling was adopted to sample five cities in this study, which was deficient in sample size and sample scope, and the data obtained were all cross-sectional data. In future studies, more effective methods (such as systematic sampling) can be\u00a0adopted to expand the sample size and sample scope of data collection, and longitudinal"
