    "abstractText": "Acoustic simulation of sound propagation inside the vocal tract is a key element of speech research, especially for articulatory synthesis, which allows one to relate the physics of speech production to other fields of speech science, such as speech perception. Usual methods, such as the transmission line method, have a very low computational cost and perform relatively good up to 4-5 kHz, but are not satisfying above. Fully numerical 3D methods such as finite elements achieve the best accuracy, but have a very high computational cost. Better performances are achieved with the state of the art semi-analytical methods, but they cannot describe the vocal tract geometry as accurately as fully numerical methods (e.g. no possibility to take into account the curvature). This work proposes a new semi-analytical method that achieves a better description of the three-dimensional vocal-tract geometry while keeping the computational cost substantially lower than the fully numerical methods. It is a multimodal method which relies on twodimensional finite elements to compute transverse modes and takes into account the curvature and the variations of cross-sectional area. The comparison with finite element simulations shows that the same degree of accuracy (about 1 % of difference in the resonance frequencies) is achieved with a computational cost about 10 times lower.

GENERAL CONTEXT Speech sounds are produced by sound sources (vocal fold oscillations and/or turbulent flow) placed inside a waveguide, the vocal tract, defined as the air volume between the vocal folds and the lips. The motion of the articulators, such as the tongue or the jaw, modify the vocal tract shape and the speech sound produced. Resonances are generated inside the vocal tract by the wave propagating forward and backward from the glottis to the mouth and the mouth to the glottis. They enhance some part of the speech spectrum, usually referred to as formants, which constitute acoustic cues allowing us to differentiate phonemes.\nAcoustic simulation of the vocal tract is useful to establish a relationship between the vocal tract shape and the acoustic properties of speech. Thus, it is possible to synthesise speech directly from the vocal tract shape using articulatory synthesis [8], [23], [36], [48], [49], [51].\nThe most popular method to simulate vocal tract acoustics is the transmission line model (TLM) [49]. It takes advantage of the fact that acoustic waves are guided along the vocal tract, and that under a low frequency assumption (valid up to about 5 kHz), only plane waves propagate. This means that the local cross-sectional shape has little impact on the propagation and that one needs to consider the cross-sectional area only. Thus, under these hypotheses, the curvature of the vocal\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The TLM can be implemented in both frequency and time domain. It requires very few computational resources and can run in real time.\nB. LIMITS OF CURRENT SIMULATION METHODS A first limitation of the TLM is the impossibility to take into account accurately the three-dimensional (3D) shape of the vocal tract. A second one is that it can intrinsically not describe a non uniform transverse acoustic field. The consequence of this is particularly visible at high frequencies, above about 4-5 kHz, when other modes than plane waves (higher order modes) can propagate [11], [40], [41]. This induces additional resonances and antiresonances in the vocal tract that cannot be predicted by TLM. However, it has also consequences at lower frequencies in the vicinity of discontinuities where the transverse acoustic field can be slightly non-uniform. This induces inaccuracies in the prediction of the resonance frequencies. Note that it is theoretically possible to reduce these inaccuracies by applying length corrections to the TLM segments [49].\nThese limitations motivated the use of 3D simulation methods to study vocal tract acoustics. For this purpose, finite elements (FEM) [2], [24], [55], boundary elements (BEM) [34], finite differences (FDM) [53], waveguide meshes [20], [31] and the multimodal method [11], [42], [56] have been used.\nThe consequences of each of the two limitations of the TLM have been explored. On one hand, the effect of geometrical details such as the piriform fossae,1 the vallecula,2 the inter-dental space, the nasal cavity or more generally the precise 3D vocal-tract shape have been observed to affect resonance frequencies and induce additional resonances and anti-resonances [53], [54]. On the other hand, the higherorder modes have been shown to induce additional resonances and anti-resonances at frequencies above 4-5 kHz [11] and affect speech radiation patterns [12], [16]. Note that side branches can be modelled with TLM, however, to our knowledge, no correction has been proposed to take into account transverse modes.\nSo far, most of the works using 3D acoustics simulations have been limited to small numbers of static geometries. Some of the most recent works are focused on the generation of articulated sounds such as specific diphthongs [3], [5], [18], [31] or consonant-vowel sequences [4], [32].\nThe main reason for this limitation is that the 3D numerical methods are strongly limited by their high computational cost, which prevent to use them as a substitute for the TLM. To illustrate that, using the FEM in the frequency domain, about 10 hours are required to simulate 1000 frequencies using a standard single processor (without meshing the outer space though) [10]. The BEM may have a lower compu-\n1Two small sides cavities located at the base of the vocal tract. 2A groove between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis.\ntational cost because it does not require to mesh the outer space and involves a smaller number of degree of freedom compared to FEM and FDM [35]. However, its application to vocal tract acoustics simulation is very anecdotal [34].\nOne possibility to reduce this cost is to use analytical or semi-analytical methods which have a lower computational cost, but are limited in term of geometrical accuracy. As for the TLM, it is possible to take advantage of the elongated shape of the vocal tract to simulate the propagation of higherorder modes, in addition to the plane waves simulated with the TLM. This type of method, which simulates several transverse modes instead of just the plane mode is called multimodal method. For example Motoki [42], [43] have taken advantage of the lower computational cost of this type of method to run numerous simulations with small perturbations of the geometry. However, the use of rectangular crosssections, which allowed a fully analytical solution with a very small computational cost, implied a strong geometrical approximation of the vocal tract shape. Blandin et al. [11] improved this method by introducing a numerical computation of the transverse modes that substantially increased the realism of the cross-sectional shapes. However, the curvature was not taken into account, the cross-sectional area was piecewise constant and no wall losses were simulated. The multimodal method can also help to understand the physical phenomena involved in speech production better than fully numerical methods, as they provide a theoretical background (higherorder modes propagation) that can be related to experimental observations. For example, it was useful to Yoshinaga et al. [56] for understanding better the mechanisms of sound generation of the fricative /s/. However, in this case as well, the use of rectangular cross-sections made the geometry used less realistic than what could be achieved with fully numerical methods."

The local transverse modes are computed with two-dimensional (2D) FEM, and the propagation along the waveguide axis is solved using a multimodal formulation. The wave problem is solved for a static geometry. Similar semi-analytical finite-elements (SAFE) methods have already been applied to the simulation of street acoustics [47] or vibrations in rails [6], [26], [33], [38]. The multimodal formulation of the propagation along the waveguide axis allows us to take into account the effects of the curvature and cross-section area variations, as detailed below in Sec. II.

SEGMENTATION OF THE 3D GEOMETRY The 3D vocal tract geometry can be provided as a 3D surface mesh (e.g. from medical image) or by a set of functions defining 3D surfaces (e.g. from an articulatory model). In order to apply the proposed method, they are first segmented in portions with constant cross-sectional shape, as illustrated in Fig. 1. For this purpose, a curve, referred to as the centerline, passing through the vicinity of the centers of the transverse cross-sections and contained in the sagittal plane is defined [9]. The 3D geometry is cut in several planes perpendicular to the centerline. A segment is defined between two consecutive\nX\nY\nZ\nx\ny\nz\na)\nb) t\nnynz\ni\nj k\nt\nny nz\nC\nO\nO\nC\nl=0.67\nl=0.83 l=1 l=1.16\nl=1.3\nFIGURE 2.

It is characterized by a contour extracted from one of the cuts, the local curvature of the centerline and a scaling factor describing the area variation along the centerline (see Fig. 2a). Keeping the contour shape constant along the segment allows one to use the same transverse modes along the segment. Several methods have been proposed to implement this segmentation process [7], [9], [28], [36]. For classical TLM simulation, the number of segments generated for vocal tract geometries ranges between 40 and 80 [50], [52]. For 3D simulations, the comparison of FEM simulations of geometries without segmentation and segmented with 40, 60 and 80 segments showed that the segmentation process induces an upward shift (lower than 5% for 80 segments below 5 kHz) of the resonance frequencies, the global shape of the transfer functions being preserved [2]."

A Neumann boundary condition was considered as it is closer to the properties of the walls of the vocal tract and thus, ensure a faster convergence of the method. Note that an improved formulation using a so called supplementary mode would further improve the convergence [21]. The solution obtained is used to compute the propagation matrices E, C, K2 andD, defined in Eqs. (25), (26), (27) and (29).\nThe transverse functions \u03d5n can be expressed as the summation of shape functions ei(y, z) corresponding to the finite elements\n\u03d5n = N\u2211 i=1 \u03beniei = \u03ben \u00b7 e, (30)\nwhere \u03beni are the amplitudes of the shape functions.

The expression of the transverse modes and the propagation matrices for a rectangular shape are provided in Appendix A.\nThe relative error of the matrices C, D, E and KR2 has been computed as the ratio of the norm of the difference between the numerical and the analytical solutions over the norm of the analytical solution. For example, for the matrix C the relative error is ||CA \u2212 C||/||CA||, with CA the analytical solution. It is presented for various densities in\nVOLUME 4, 2016 5\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The mesh density is defined as the ratio of the square root of the cross-sectional surface over the average side length of the triangular elements. It can be seen as the number of elements per characteristic length.\nAs expected, the relative error decreases when the mesh density is increased. For the 10 first modes a density of 15 is sufficient to obtain an error lower than 1%. But for the 50 first modes, one need a density of 30 to achieve this. The error depends on the type of matrix: the matrix C has the lowest errors, and the matrix D has the highest. This may be due to the approximation of the gradient of the modes \u2207\u22a5\u03d5 for the matrices D and E which could potentially generate more errors, and of the integration on the contour for the matrixKR2 which involves less elements than surface integration. The impact of the mesh density on the computation of transfer functions is evaluated in Section IV-A.\n2) Connection of the segments\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the vocal tract geometry is described by a succession of segments which need to be connected to each other. This is done by assuming the continuity of the\nacoustic field at the junctions, as proposed by Pagneux et al. [45].\nFig. 4 illustrates a junction between two waveguide segments with different cross-sectional contours and area varying along the propagation axis. The cross-section of the segment a is contained in the one of the segment b, and, hence, the surface Sa (in grey in Fig. 4) is smaller than the surface Sb. The variations of cross-sectional area inside the segments a and b are described by the scaling functions la(xa) and lb(xb) respectively.\nRelationships between the modal amplitudes at both sides of the interface between the segments a and b can be derived from the condition of continuity of the acoustic field on the common surface Sa and the boundary condition qb = 0 on the surface Sb \u2212 Sa of the wall of the largest segment\npa = lb la Fpb, (42) qb = lb la F tqa, (43)\nwhere\nF = \u222b SaX \u03d5a\u03d5 t b dY dZ lalb , (44)\nwhere SaX is the surface Sa expressed in Cartesian coordinates (X,Y, Z). The scaling factors la and lb must be introduced as the integration is done in Cartesian coordinates (X,Y, Z) (see Appendix C).\nCombining Eqs. (42) and (43) and introducing the impedance and admittance matrices Z and Y defined as p = Zq and q = Yp allows one to derive relationships between the impedance and admittance matrices on side a and b\nZa = ( lb la )2 FZbF t, (45)\nYb = ( lb la )2 F tYaF . (46)\nHowever, the segment interfaces obtained by slicing vocal tract geometries do not always correspond to this case: the cross-section of side a may not be fully contained in the cross-section of side b. According to Ginsberg [27], this case cannot be treated directly using an orthogonality based method as used here. To overcome this limitation, zero length segments whose cross-section is the intersection between the cross-section a and b are introduced in this case. This allows one to use the expression derived above. Note that, according to Ginsberg [27], a collocation based method would not have this limitation, and could be used as an alternative."

This is obtained through the relationship\nZn+1 = (\u039b1Zn + \u039b2) (\u039b3Zn + \u039b4)\u22121 .

GENERAL WORKFLOW The whole process of solving the wave problem is described in the pseudo-code algorithm 1. The different physical quantities implied in solving the wave problem are shown in Fig. 5.\nThe equation (20) is solved by setting a radiation impedance boundary condition at the mouth end and a particle velocity field at the glottis end. The radiation impedance condition is described by a radiation impedance matrix which can be numerically integrated following the method described in [13]. It is necessary to compute this radiation\nimpedance matrix in the Cartesian coordinates system. Thus, the distances must be multiplied by the factor l at the end of the last of the Ns segments. In an infinite baffle, the radiation impedance matrix ZoutNs is given by\nZoutNs = \u22121 2\u03c0 \u222b S \u222b S0 \u03d5(y, z)\u03d5t(y0, z0) e\u2212jklh lh dS0dS, (53)\nwhere h = \u221a\n(y \u2212 y0)2 + (z \u2212 z0)2. Alternatively, the radiation impedance matrix can be computed using the method proposed by Felix and Doc [22].\nThe impedance and admittance matrices are computed from the mouth to the glottis, and the acoustic field is computed from the glottis input particle velocity to the mouth using the impedance and admittance matrices computed previously.\nThe acoustic pressure radiated to an external point (xr, yr, zr) is computed with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral in the same scaled space\np(xr, yr, zr) = \u22121 2\u03c0 \u222b S qoutNs \u00b7\u03d5(y, z) ejklr lr dS, (54)\nwhere r = \u221a x2r + (y \u2212 yr)2 + (z \u2212 zr)2 and (y, z) \u2208 S.\nThis simulation method was implemented as a new functionality of the articulatory synthesizer VocalTractLab [8], which will be made available to the public soon on the website www.vocaltractlab.de."

Equation (57) is supplemented with the following set of boundary and initial conditions (see Fig. 6)\nu \u00b7 nX = g(t) on \u0393G, t > 0, (58a) u \u00b7 nX = p/Zw on \u0393W, t > 0, (58b) u \u00b7 nX = 0 on \u0393H, t > 0, (58c) u \u00b7 nX = p/Z0 on \u0393\u221e, t > 0, (58d)\np = 0, u = 0 in \u2126, t = 0. (58e)\ng(t) is used to introduce a particle acoustic velocity at the glottal cross-sectional area \u0393G, Zw is the wall impedance imposed at the vocal tract walls \u0393W to introduce losses, and Z0 = \u03c1c is the air impedance used in (58d) to implement a Sommerfeld boundary condition so as to absorb sound waves reaching the outer boundary \u0393\u221e. Zw is computed from the boundary admittance coefficient \u03b6 = Z0/Zw, which was set to the same value as for the multimodal simulations: \u03b6 = 0.005. A rigid wall boundary condition was enforced on the baffle surface \u0393H of the external domain.\nFor the vocal tract geometries, the computational domain \u2126 consists of a vocal tract set in a hemisphere of radius 0.16 m to allow sound waves radiate outwards from the mouth (see Figure 6). In the single segment geometry,\nhowever, the radiation domain is removed and \u2126 terminates at the horn exit. A zero pressure release condition (p = 0) is imposed on it to emulate an open-end condition. A volume mesh was next generated discretizing \u2126 in a set of tetrahedra of average size 0.003 m in the horn or vocal tract, and {0.004, 0.0065} m in the inner and outer radiation domains of the vocal tract geometries.\nThe wave equation (57) with boundary and initial conditions (58) was next solved in \u2126 using a custom FEM code based on the stabilization strategy defined in [29]. The stabilization parameter was reduced from 0.05 to 0.01 compared to [29], which allowed us to use larger time steps while preserving a low numerical dissipation. The following Gaussian pulse was used as input for the vocal tract,\ng(t) = e\u2212[(t\u2212Tgp)/0.29Tgp] 2 [m/s], (59)\nwith Tgp = 0.646/fc and fc = 10 kHz. This pulse was low-pass filtered at 10 kHz to avoid numerical errors above the maximum frequency of analysis (10 kHz). A numerical simulation of a time event lasting 0.05 s was then performed using a time step of 2e-6 s. The acoustic pressure po(t) was tracked close to the vocal tract exit, inside of it, at 3 mm from the mouth aperture center. This helped us to minimize possible spurious reflections coming from \u0393\u221e, compared to capturing the acoustic pressure in the radiation domain. A vocal tract transfer function was finally computed in the same way as for the multimodal simulations defined in Eq. (56). Po(f) and G(f) were computed as the Fourier transform of po(t) and g(t) respectively.\nThis simulation method showed in previous studies a good agreement with experimental data [2], [11]. More generally, the FEM can be trusted to describe accurately vocal tract acoustics, as illustrated by the good agreement obtained by Fleischer et al. [25] between a different implementation of FEM and experimental data."

SINGLE SEGMENT The figure 7 shows the transfer function of the single segment computed with FEM and the multimodal method with 53 modes, a mesh density of 30 and a 200 integration points (about 12 points per centimeter). It shows the typical resonances produced by the plane mode, but also exhibits troughs and additional resonances related to transverse resonances induced by the curvature and higher order modes propagation. See as an example the trough located at 5755 Hz and the corresponding acoustic field, computed with the multimodal method, presented in Fig. 8, in which these effects are clearly observable. The wall boundary condition described in Eq. (7) implies that in the vicinity of the walls the normal gradient of the acoustic pressure is very small. This implies that the isoamplitude lines are almost perpendicular to the walls. This can be observed in Fig. 8, thus, confirming that this boundary condition is properly simulated.\nThe influence of the number of modes, the mesh density and the number of integration points on the simulations was examined by computing the transfer function with different values of these parameters.

The outliers are plotted individually as crosses.\n53 modes, a mesh density of 30 and 200 integration points (corresponding to about 1.5 to 12 points per centimeter).\nThis reference case was first compared with the FEM simulation with which a very good agreement was observed. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the amplitude of both transfer functions is almost perfectly superimposed, with some slight differences increasing toward the high frequencies which consists mainly in stronger losses and slightly higher resonance frequencies for FEM. The latter can be attributed to the stiffening effect of FEM [19]. More precisely, the average differences are 0.16%, 15.6% and 1.2 % for the resonance frequencies, bandwidth and amplitudes respectively. The maximal differences are 0.33%, 51.3% and 3.7% for the frequencies, bandwidth and amplitudes respectively. The significant differences in bandwidth can be attributed to the time and spatial discretization of FEM, which tends to artificially increase the losses with frequency. Indeed, note that below 8 kHz the FEM and MM curves match to a large extend, reducing the average differences to 0.1%, 6.8% and 0.45% for the resonance frequencies, bandwidths, and amplitudes, respectively. It is to be mentioned that FEM results could be improved using a finer mesh and smaller time step, but at the price of increasing the computational cost.\nThe relative difference between different values of parameters and the reference case (mesh density of 30, 53 modes and 200 integration points) are presented as box plots in Fig. 9.

The differences reduce as the parameters get closer to the reference case. The parameter which induces the greatest impact is the number of modes. Large differences are observed for the bandwidth which is equally influenced by the three tested parameters. 32 modes are sufficient to achieve an average difference lower than 0.1% for the frequencies and amplitudes, but still more than 1% for the bandwidths.\nB. VOCAL TRACT GEOMETRIES a: Transfer functions The transfer functions of the vowel geometries obtained with different geometrical approximations and with FEM are presented in Fig. 10. There is an overall good agreement for the 3-4 first resonances between the different geometrical approximations: the difference in resonance frequencies with FEM remains lower than 5% in all cases. This is in line\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nPa\nFIGURE 11. Acoustic pressure amplitude computed with the proposed method in the sagittal plane and in two transverse cutting planes indicated as dashed lines in a vocal tract geometry corresponding to the vowel /i/ at 7500 Hz for an input volume velocity of 1cm3/s. This corresponds to the 6th resonance of the transfer function obtained with curved segments in Fig. 10. The iso-amplitude lines are highlighted in black.\nwith the fact that the plane wave assumption is a good approximation up to 4-5 kHz [15].\nThe agreement with the FEM solution is better when the curvature is considered, and further improved when the variations of cross-sectional area are taken into account. The resonance frequencies are generally lower with the straight segment approximation. In particular for the second resonance of the /i/ (see Fig. 10b). This is in line with the findings of Arnela et al. [2]. Furthermore, taking into account the curvature just by changing a parameter of the model confirms that this effect is induced by the curvature alone. As a matter of fact, in the study of Arnela et al. [2] this could have also been induced by the method used to straighten the vocal tract geometries.\nThere is overall more difference between the geometrical approximations above 4-5 kHz, in particular for /i/ and /u/. Taking into account the variation of cross-sectional area substantially improves the agreement with FEM in this frequency range for /u/ (see Fig. 10c). Thus, the high frequency acoustic properties of the vocal tract appear to be sensitive to small geometrical details. This is in line with the findings of Motoki [43] who showed that small geometrical perturbations of simplified vocal tract geometries induced more important variations of the transfer function above 4 kHz. Despite the roughness introduced by the contour change, there is a relatively good agreement with FEM simulation performed with a smoother geometry.\nSubstantial differences remain between FEM and the multimodal method for the case accounting for the curvature and the cross-sectional area variations (about 1 % of difference in the resonance frequencies), see also around 8 kHz for /i/ and /u/ (see Figs. 10b and 10c). This can be attributed\nVOLUME 4, 2016 11\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The small geometrical differences could be slightly reduced, for example by using a better interpolation of the cross-sectional area, or by refining the segmentation of parts having significant changes of crosssectional shape. However, the gain in accuracy may be of the order of the uncertainties in the extraction of the vocal tract geometries from medical images. It would also be possible to optimise the segmentation by using longer segments in the parts having little variations of cross-sectional shape, and thus further reduce the computational cost. The algorithm used to generate the centerline curve can have an impact as well, as it was observed by Arnela et al. [5]. However, it is expected to be smaller for 3D simulations than for TLM simulations.\nThe losses are slightly lower with the multimodal method: the resonances have smaller -3 dB bandwidths (of the order of 10%). This can be attributed to the perfectly reflective surfaces which are considered at the discontinuities between the segments (see Section II-C2). On the other hand, the numerical scheme used for the FEM could tend to slightly artificially increase the losses as the frequency increases due to the adopted stabilization strategy and the time and space discretization (see Section III-C).\nb: Acoustic field The Fig. 11 illustrates the acoustic field computation inside a segmented geometry with the field corresponding to the 6th resonance of the vowel /i/ (7500 Hz). As for the single segment, the effect of the transverse modes is clearly visible as transverse variations both in the sagittal and transverse planes. The iso-amplitude lines tend to be perpendicular to the walls of the geometry, confirming that the boundary condition is properly simulated. When looking carefully, the effect of the segmentation is visible as small discontinuities in the iso-amplitude lines where there is a strong discontinuity at the interface between two segments (see as an example at the expansion at the base of the geometry). This may be improved by using more transverse modes to describe the strong discontinuities.\nc: Influence of the number of modes Multimodal simulations were run with values of the maximal cutoff frequency ranging from 20 kHz to 60 kHz using the best geometrical approximation (taking into account the curvature and the variations of cross-sectional area). The resonance frequencies of the transfer functions were compared with the solution obtained with 60 kHz and the FEM solution. The distribution of the relative error is presented as box plots in Fig. 12. For the 3 vowels tested the simulations converge toward the 60 kHz solution, with less than 1 % of difference from 40 kHz. It does not strictly converge toward the FEM solution, as from 40 kHz onward the difference with FEM remains stable or slightly increases, but remains smaller than 1 %. Note also that for some resonances the difference does\nnot decrease rigorously monotonously: it can increase for some specific values of the maximal cutoff frequency (see as an example the outlier at 30 kHz for /a/).\nd: Computation time\nFig. 13a presents the computation times for the transfer functions of the vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ for different values of the maximal cutoff frequency, a mesh density of 15, 3 integration points per segment (about 20 points per centimeter) and 1000 frequencies. The computations were run in a single thread on a processor Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae W-2145 3.7 Ghz. The computation time varies with the vowel geometries, and from 30 kHz onward, it increases exponentially.\nFig. 13b shows the distribution of the computation time over the different tasks required to solve the wave problem for the vowel /i/ (vowels /a/ and /u/ show similar trends). They consist in the computation of the transverse modes, the junction matrices (Eq. 44), the radiation impedance matrix (Eq. (53)), the propagation of the physical quantities (Z , Y , p and q) and the computation of the radiated field (Eq. (54)). The computation time for the propagation is split into the computation of the matrix exponential in Eq. (48) and the other parts of the task since this part of the process"

Most of the computation time is dedicated to the computation of the transverse modes and the matrix exponential. When few modes are used, the computation time is mainly spent in the computation of the modes. As the number of modes used is increased, the time spent in the computation of the matrix exponential increases and becomes the task occupying most of the computation time. Note that the computation of the transverse modes, the junction matrices and the radiation impedance are done only at the beginning of the whole process. Thus, the time required for these tasks is not affected by the number of frequencies at which the transfer function is computed. A maximal cutoff frequency of 40 kHz appears to be a good compromise between the accuracy and the computation time.\nFor frequency domain FEM, 10 hours were necessary to compute 1000 frequencies with a single processor [10]. However, in this example a simplifying assumption was made for the radiation and the external space was not meshed, which reduces the computation time in comparison to a more accurate simulation. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed method provides simulations with the same degree of accuracy as FEM, but with a computation time reduced by about a factor 10. The implementation used can be optimised to achieve even shorter computation times. One can also mention that it requires far less exchange memory, and it is thus easier to run on a standard laptop without special equipment for simulations (e.g. additional memory).\nV. CONCLUSION The proposed method can simulate curved vocal tract geometries with realistic cross-sectional shapes and cross-sectional area variations within the segments. The same degree of accuracy as FEM is achieved for the computation of transfer functions of a single segment (about 0.2 % of differences in the resonance frequencies). Accounting for the curvature and the cross-sectional area variation substantially improves the agreement with FEM, particularly above 4-5 kHz. The\nsegmentation process of realistic 3D vocal-tract geometries introduces small differences, but the agreement with FEM simulations remains very good (less than 1 % of difference in the resonance frequencies). A good trade-off between accuracy and computation time is achieved using a mesh density of 15, about 10 integration points per centimeter and a maximal cutoff frequency of 40 kHz. With these parameters, the proposed method achieves computation times about 10 times shorter than FEM while preserving the same degree of accuracy. The proposed method can be used to synthesize articulated sounds by simulating a succession of static geometries corresponding to various instants of the articulation motion and following the approach proposed by Sondhi and Schroeter [49]."
