Development of More Efficient Nanocarrier Systems: Research could focus on creating new or improving existing nanocarrier systems for dsRNA delivery, such as enhancing the stability, uptake efficiency, and targeted delivery capabilities. This includes the design of novel nanocarriers that can overcome plant cell barriers more effectively while being biodegradable and non-toxic to the environment.

Understanding and Mitigating Off-target Effects: Since potential off-target effects of dsRNA are a significant concern, future studies could aim at developing more precise bioinformatics tools and experimental approaches to predict and assess off-target risks. Research could also explore the mechanisms of specificity in RNAi to enhance target selectivity and minimize unintended impacts on non-target species.

Cost-effective dsRNA Production Technologies: Given the high cost of dsRNA production, research into more economical methods of dsRNA synthesis is crucial. This could involve optimizing microbial fermentation techniques, exploring plant-based production systems, or developing novel enzymatic synthesis methods that could reduce the cost of large-scale dsRNA production for agricultural use.

Long-term Environmental and Ecological Impact Studies: There is a need for comprehensive studies to understand the long-term environmental and ecological impacts of using dsRNA and nanocarriers in agriculture. This includes assessing the persistence and degradation of dsRNAs in various environmental conditions, their effects on soil microbiomes, and potential impacts on non-target organisms over extended periods.

Regulatory Framework and Public Acceptance: Research into developing clear, science-based regulatory frameworks for evaluating and approving RNAi-based biopesticides is necessary. This includes addressing public concerns and misconceptions about RNAi technology through transparent communication and engagement strategies to build public trust and acceptance. Studies could also explore the ethical, legal, and social implications of deploying RNAi technology in agriculture.
