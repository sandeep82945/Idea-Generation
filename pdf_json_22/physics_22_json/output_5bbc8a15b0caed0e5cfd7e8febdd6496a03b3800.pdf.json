INTRODUCTION\nThe presence of a magnetic field affects the interactions among the nuclei and electrons that make up atoms and molecules. On Earth, these effects are small and can be accurately described using perturbation theory and response methods. Elsewhere in the universe, the effects of a magnetic field can be much stronger. In the atmosphere of a magnetic white dwarf star, for example, field strengths of the order of 100 000 T can be observed,1 close to one atomic unit field strength, B0 = h\u0335/(ea20) \u2248 2.35 \u00d7 10\n5 T. Under such conditions, magnetic interactions compete with the electric interactions, strongly affecting the electronic structure of atoms and molecules.2\nThe electronic structure of atoms in the presence of a magnetic field has been studied for decades, and theoretical predictions of spectral transitions have been used to map out the magnetic field strength on the surface of white dwarfs\u2014see, for example, Ref. 3. The\ntheoretical description of molecules in a magnetic field is more complicated than that of atoms, and it is only during the past decade that a general study of molecules in a strong magnetic field has become possible. An essential step forward was the introduction of London atomic orbitals (LAOs) in a finite magnetic field, making it possible to study molecules in an arbitrary orientation relative to the magnetic field.4 A number of such studies have now been published using special codes developed for such studies\u2014calculations can now be carried out at all the standard levels of electronic structure theory, including Hartree\u2013Fock theory,4\u20137 full-configurationinteraction theory,8,9 coupled-cluster theory,10\u201313 density-functional theory,14\u201318 and GW theory.19\u201321 Non-Born\u2013Oppenheimer calculations have also been carried out for atoms and molecules using explicitly correlated Gaussians.22\u201325 Methods for analytical calculation of forces and geometry optimizations are available.6,18,26 These studies have revealed a number of interesting features of molecules in a strong magnetic field, including the existence of a new bonding\nJ.

Within the Born\u2013Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, the theoretical foundation of ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) in a magnetic was laid more than 30 years ago by Schmelcher and co-workers27\u201329 and by Mead and co-workers.30\u201332 In particular, these authors discussed how the Lorentz force acting on the moving nuclei is screened by the electrons in the molecule, requiring the evaluation of the Berry curvature for all pairs of atoms in the system. The importance of the screening force was demonstrated by Ceresoli et al.,33 who in 2007 calculated the Berry curvature of H2 from a Hartree\u2013Fock wave function in a minimal basis of Slater orbitals equipped with London phase factors. Using a parameterized BO potential, these authors presented the first molecular dynamics calculations with a screened London force for H2 in a perpendicular field orientation.\nThe first general scheme for ab initio BO molecular dynamics was presented by Culpitt et al.34 and Peters et al.35 in 2021. Obtaining the Berry curvature by a finite-difference approach,34 these authors calculated BO trajectories of He and H2 at different field strengths at the Hartree\u2013Fock level of theory in a basis of London Gaussian orbitals.35 The trajectories were propagated using a series of new propagators and designed to include the nonconservative screened Lorentz forces in the dynamics in a stable and efficient manner. From the trajectories, rovibrational spectra of H2 were calculated, revealing a number of features not observed in the field-free cases: couplings of rotations/vibrations with the cyclotron rotation, overtones with unusual selection rules, and hindered rotations that transmute into librations with increasing field strength. More recently, these authors have presented an analytical scheme for the evaluation of the screened Lorentz force.36\nIn this paper, we present more extensive studies of molecular dynamics in a strong magnetic field, introducing a highly efficient Tajima propagator for the trajectory calculations. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of H2 and LiH reveal a more detailed and complete picture of the rovibrational spectra of molecules in a magnetic field."

Choosing the Coulomb gauge for the magnetic vector potential, \u2207 \u22c5 A = 0, an explicit form for a vector potential of a static, homogeneous magnetic field may be written out as\nAO(r) = 1 2 B \u00d7 (r \u2212O), (1)\nwhere O is the arbitrarily chosen gauge origin of the system and r is the position vector of any point in space. The dependency of\nthe magnetic vector potential on the arbitrary gauge origin can lead to unphysical contributions to observable quantities, which must be carefully avoided.\nThe fundamental equation governing the dynamics of molecules in finite magnetic fields is the non-relativistic time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (in atomic units),\nH\u0302\u2223\u03a8\u27e9 = i \u2202\n\u2202t \u2223\u03a8\u27e9, (2)\nwhere H\u0302 = T\u0302n + H\u0302el + V\u0302nn is the molecular Hamiltonian operator consisting of the nuclear kinetic energy operator (T\u0302n), the electronic Hamiltonian operator (H\u0302el), and the nuclear repulsion potential operator (V\u0302nn). Since even a strong magnetic field does not change the fact that the motions of the nuclei and the electrons, respectively, occur on completely different time scales, we use the Born\u2013Oppenheimer (BO) ansatz to approximate the wave function,\n\u03a8(r, R, t) \u2248 \u03c6(r, R)\u03d5(R, t), (3)\nwith R and r denoting nuclear and electronic positions, respectively. As a consequence, two coupled equations of motions, the electronic and nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equations, can be formulated as\nH\u0302el\u2223\u03c6\u27e9 = i \u2202\n\u2202t \u2223\u03c6\u27e9, (4)\nH\u0302n\u2223\u03d5\u27e9 = i \u2202\n\u2202t \u2223\u03d5\u27e9. (5)\nAssuming that the nuclei can be regarded as classical particles and that the electronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation only depends parametrically on their position, a potential energy surface (PES),\nUBO(R) = \u27e8\u03c6\u2223H\u0302el(R)\u2223\u03c6\u27e9, (6)\nmay be calculated for any set of fixed nuclear coordinates by solving the electronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In order to avoid gauge-origin dependencies of UBO, London atomic orbitals37,38 have to be used consistently throughout its construction.4,5,39 Gradients of the PES may also be constructed in a similar fashion, employing LAOs in order to eliminate gauge-origin dependencies.6,18 The PES can be constructed at any level of quantum-chemical theory, although it is preferable to use size-consistent methods in order to avoid internal inconsistencies."

The second term constitutes the Lorentz force of the external magnetic field on the moving charged particle, that is, the nucleus. The third and last term represents the force generated by the interaction with the screened charges of all other nuclei in the molecule. It should be noted that if all quantities in Eq.

For field free dynamics, it is common to use a symplectic integration scheme like the often discussed velocity-Verlet propagator41 or propagators of higher order like Runge\u2013Kutta42 or Forest\u2013Ruth.43 However, the presence of the Lorentz force and Berry curvature in the equation of motion does not allow for a separation into a pure coordinate propagation step and a pure velocity propagation step while simultaneously maintaining symplecticity.44\nTao was able to solve this problem by introducing an auxiliary Hamiltonian that couples to the original through an empirical coupling constant. Peters and co-workers adapted this propagation for MD simulations in magnetic fields.35,45 However, in order to propagate the molecule one step in time, the auxiliary coordinates and momenta (ACM) propagator requires three gradient calculations, making it three times more expensive than the regular Verlet algorithm. In addition, an empirical coupling constant \u03c9 must be optimized for every molecule and the intended initial conditions.\nIn this section, we present an alternative integration scheme that is directly derived from the nuclear equation of motion in Eq. (14). Using the matrix representation B\u0303 for the cross product of the Lorentz force in Eq. (14), it can be rewritten in terms of the more compact matrix equation,\nMR\u0308(t) = \u2212\u2207UBO(R(t)) \u2212Q(t)R\u0307(t), (15)\nwhere M denotes a diagonal matrix containing the atomic masses.

Inserting Eq. (17) into Eq.

There are several advantages of the Tajima approach compared to using the ACM propagator. Mainly, one propagation step \u0394\u03c4 requires only a single gradient and Berry curvature calculation. In addition, both the auxiliary coordinates and momenta, as well as the empirical coupling constant, can be dropped. The Tajima propagator is, thus, both more compact and efficient than the ACM propagator. This is especially advantageous for on-the-fly simulations where the molecular gradients and the Berry curvature have to be calculated ab initio during every propagation step.\nFinally, we would like to note that the computational cost and numerical stability of the matrix inversion needed in the framework of the Tajima approach are not issues for the very small molecules studied in this work. This may become more important when treating very large molecular systems."

Moreover, any observable quantity can also be precalculated and stored on a disk if needed. For instance, it is helpful to examine if the energy is properly conserved, which requires the electronic energy to be stored. Furthermore, electric dipole moments are needed in order to obtain infrared spectra. It should be noted that any observable quantity should be calculated using LAOs to maintain gauge origin invariance.\nAll relevant quantities are then fitted by calculating root points on a fine meshed grid and the corresponding partial second derivatives are estimated so that a bivalent spline function can be created during the simulation. This procedure was already presented in an earlier publication,35 where the molecular gradients and Berry curvature were obtained as derivatives of the electronic energy and wave function.\nHowever, since the PES is already approximated via a spline, there really is no need to pre-compute the molecular gradients and use a spline fit for them as well, as they can simply be computed as derivatives of the PES spline during the simulation. We have compared the two approaches (pre-calculated analytical molecular gradients vs gradients of the PES spline) and have found no discernible differences in the results.\nIn addition, such an approach allows us to take correlation effects into account while the gradients are automatically obtained at the same level of theory. In this work, all correlated calculations are performed at the two-component MP2 level. It should be noted that the first derivatives of the PES spline have to be calculated for both dimensions of the PES (d and \u03b8). The Berry curvature tensor is calculated at the GHF level and each of its elements must be fitted separately through a spline function.\nAll pre-calculations for this work have been carried out at the GHF/def2-TZVP and MP2/def2-TZVP levels of theory using the TURBOMOLE program package while using a convergence criterion of 10\u221211Eh.

First is the influence of the magnetic field on the electronic wave function through paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions as presented in Eq. (4). This, of course,\naffects the BO potential energy surface UBO, leading to an altered PES, which additionally depends on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field. Second, since during molecular rotations and vibrations, the atomic nuclei can essentially be considered as moving charges, an external magnetic field interacts with them through a Lorentz force. However, it can be assumed that the electrons screen the positively charged nuclei to some extent, meaning that only a portion of the Lorentz force that would interact with the bare nuclei will actually have an impact. This effective screening is considered through the Berry curvature tensor as shown in Eq. (16).\nBoth of these considerations have been introduced as well as discussed in an earlier publication.35 However, we believe that it is important to carefully assess them once more, particularly in order to capture some effects that have not yet been covered. In addition, correlation effects should be taken into account by employing a PES generated by the MP2 level of theory, leading to small shifts in the vibrational and rotational spectra.

Under the influence of a magnetic field, however, the system is no longer rotationally invariant, and thus, the polar angle between the field and the molecular bond, \u03b8, has to be considered as well. A two-dimensional contour plot of the potential energy surface in a magnetic field of B = 0.4B0 is shown in Fig. 2(a). The most apparent change caused by the magnetic field is the molecule\u2019s preferred parallel orientation relative to the field and the resulting potential barrier for a perpendicular orientation. Since the height of the cos2(\u03b8)-like potential is almost proportional to the magnetic field strength, it is reasonable to assume that its effects also scale linearly with respect to the field strength.

However, compared to the previously discussed potential energy barrier, this effect turns out to be comparably small.\nBefore studying the dynamics of H2 in detail, a qualitative assessment of the expected influence of such a potential barrier should be discussed. Since the system\u2019s total energy has to be conserved, the kinetic energy is reduced every time the molecule is near the perpendicular orientation, resulting in a hindered rotation of the molecule. Moreover, if the potential energy barrier is large enough (i.e., in extremely strong magnetic fields), the kinetic energy reduces to almost zero and a rotation of the molecule over the barrier is no longer possible. Such a trajectory is called a libration. Since all assumptions about the molecular rotation behaving like a free rigid rotor fail under such conditions, a sudden shift in the rotational spectrum at a certain magnetic field strength is to be expected.\nThe correlation effects on the potential energy barrier should also be assessed. In Fig. 2(b), the potential energy barrier is plotted for different field strengths using both the GHF and the MP2 methods. While the correlation effects appear to be small, it should be noted that they become more pronounced with an increasing field strength."

            "text": "The distinction between the trajectories of an (allowed but hindered) rotation and a libration is depicted in Fig. 3. Both trajectories were simulated in an external field of 0.2B0, but slightly different initial velocities were chosen. For the first simulation shown in Fig. 3(a), the molecule was given an initial kinetic energy of 3.5 mEh, which is just enough to ensure that the potential energy barrier is crossed, resulting in a rotation. For the second simulation shown in Fig. 3(b), the simulation was started with a kinetic energy of 2.8 mEh, which is not sufficient to overcome the potential energy barrier. In both cases, some energy was also put into a stretching vibration that couples with the rotation and libration, respectively, while any center-of-mass motion was suppressed.\nThe trajectories in Fig. 3 also reveal the main influence of the Lorentz force interacting with the nuclear velocities: a slow rotation of the molecule about the field axis. It should be noted that the corresponding simulations were initiated from the equilibrium orientation parallel to the field with no initial angular velocity around the field axis. Thus, according to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, such a rotation can only be caused by an external force, which, in this case, corresponds to the Lorentz force acting on the (partially screened) nuclei. We refer to this motion as Lorentz-force induced precession of the rotational axis. This precession has to be carefully distinguished from center-of-mass cyclotron rotations of charged systems like the H+2 molecule. In such cases, the Lorentz force would initiate a regular cyclotron rotation of the entire molecule about a fixed point in space, whereas the Lorentz-force induced precession does not correspond to an overall movement of the center-of-mass of the molecule in space.\nBy performing a large number of MD simulations on the H2 molecule, we have assessed the two main effects of an external magnetic field on molecular rotations and vibrations. On the one hand, we have to consider an additional potential barrier arising from a dependency of the PES on the orientation between the molecule and the magnetic field. On the other hand, Lorentz forces will interact with the screened atomic nuclei, leading to additional movements. While most of this work is, therefore, focusing on these two effects, it should be noted that the MD simulations also take into account other effects. First, as already mentioned, the equilibrium bond distance depends on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field. Thus, it is likely to change during a molecular rotation, inducing stretching vibrations that are coupled to the respective rotations. Second, the reversed case is also relevant, as stretching vibrations can induce rotations at a very low frequency. This was shown previously by Ceresoli et al.33 Third, coupling effects from field-free dynamics, such as centrifugal lengthening, also occur in a magnetic field. However, these effects are not the subject of detailed analysis in this work.\nJ. Chem.

            "text": "After having assessed molecular rotations and librations qualitatively in Sec. IV B, it is time to analyze them quantitatively as well. A power spectrum can be obtained by recording the nuclear velocities from an MD simulation and subsequently performing a Fourier transformation.58\u201360 In general, such a spectrum can be regarded as a vibrational spectrum without selection rules so that the obtained intensities reflect how often a mode occurred during the simulation instead of spectroscopic intensities.\nTo get a better picture of the two major effects that the external magnetic field has on the molecular rotations or librations, it is helpful to study the influence of the potential barrier and the Lorentz forces separately. This can easily be done by first carrying out a simulation while neglecting the Lorentz force and Berry curvature in Eq. (14), which corresponds to a physical picture where the nuclear charges are fully screened by the electrons. A subsequent simulation where both the Lorentz force and the Berry curvature are taken fully into account is then carried out in order to study their effects as well. For the simulations in this discussion, the same initial conditions shown for the trajectories in Fig. 3 were chosen. The resulting spectrum is presented in Fig. 4.\nIt is now possible to analyze the influence of the potential energy barrier on the spectrum by neglecting the Lorentz force and the Berry curvature in Eq. (14) during the simulation. The most noticeable change in the spectrum is that, because of the anharmonic shape of the potential energy barrier, rotational overtones become visible that would otherwise not appear in the spectrum of the field-free case. While these overtones can be observed for both rotations and librations, they differ fundamentally in these two cases. For a rotation, overtones will appear at every odd multiple of the fundamental frequency, while even multiples are unoccupied. Carrying out a Fourier transformation for each Cartesian component (x, y, z) separately reveals a great deal about the symmetry of these frequencies. They are aligned in a pattern that can be described by the following notation:\n(x, y, z)rot \u2192 (x, y, z),\u2205, (x, y, z),\u2205, . . . .\nIn this notation, the fundamental oscillation (rotation, libration, and stretching vibration) is written to the left and denotes the union of all frequencies occurring in the corresponding fine structure, which can be found on the right hand side of the arrow. A singular peak is represented by a bracket with the associated designation of symmetry. The frequencies appear in ascending order from left to right. The notation \u2205 is used for an unoccupied frequency, and the fundamental frequency is underlined.\nAn entirely different case presents itself for librations. As shown in the spectrum, every multiple of the fundamental frequency is occupied with an overtone. Moreover, an analysis of the different Cartesian components reveals that the fundamental frequency is only active in the (x, y) component and that overtones alternate between (z) and (x, y) symmetry. Thus, peaks of (z) symmetry occupy the even multiples of the fundamental frequency, while peaks of (x, y) symmetry are found at the odd positions,\n(x, y, z)lib \u2192 (x, y), (z), (x, y), (z), . . . .\nA similar pattern presents itself for the stretching vibration, which, as mentioned before, couples directly to all rotational or librational motions. In a field-free spectrum, this would lead to characteristic P- and R-branches to the left and right of the fundamental vibrational frequency. The presence of additional rotational overtones, however, gives rise to a complex coupling pattern, where each vibrational mode is coupled to all rotational modes. A single vibrational peak, therefore, leads to a multiplet mirroring the rotational spectrum. Moreover, if the magnetic field strength is large enough to induce molecular librations, an additional mode corresponding to (z) symmetry remains uncoupled from the stretching vibration (Q-branch). This situation can be summarized in the following patterns:\n(x, y, z)strrot \u2192 . . . ,\u2205, (x, y, z),\u2205, (x, y, z),\u2205, . . . , (x, y, z)strlib \u2192 . . . , (z), (x, y), (z), (x, y), (z), . . . .\nFIG. 4. Spectrum for the H2 molecule in a magnetic field of 0.2B0. The initial conditions were chosen to be equivalent to the trajectories in Fig. 3. The molecule was simulated for a timespan of 20 ps.\nJ.

This precession is an effect of the Lorentz force and Berry curvature, and as such, it is not visible in trajectories or spectra where these terms are neglected. If all terms are fully taken into account, then the modes corresponding to the precession occur naturally in the respective spectrum.\nTwo main conclusions can be drawn from the spectra where these effects are included. First, since the frequency of such a rotation is relatively low, their contribution to the spectrum is usually small. Second, since Lorentz forces are applied perpendicular to the external magnetic field along the (z) axis, precessions can only couple to motions in the (x) and (y) components, while motions parallel to the (z) axis remain unaffected. As a consequence, frequencies of (x, y) symmetry are split into doublets, with a coupling constant equal to twice the frequency of the precession.\nFor a rotation, this yields a (x, y)\u00b1 doublet, where the \u00b1 notation indicates the splitting, and an uncloupled (z) singlet,\n(x, y, z)rot \u2192 (x, y, z)\u00b1,\u2205, (x, y, z)\u00b1,\u2205, . . . ,\nand similarly, for a libration,\n(x, y, z)lib \u2192 (x, y)\u00b1, (z), (x, y)\u00b1, (z), . . . .\nThis coupling pattern works also for stretching vibrations. It should be noted that the frequency of the Lorentz-force induced precession itself does not appear in the spectrum and becomes visible only through couplings in the (x, y) components of the rotation or libration.\nMoving on to the contribution of electron correlation on the rotational and vibrational spectra of H2 in a strong magnetic field, it is helpful to analyze the differences between a simulation on a GHF PES and on an MP2 PES, which is also found in Fig. 4. As mentioned before, MP2 calculations lead to slightly higher potential energy barriers than do their GHF counterparts [Fig. 2(b)] and, as a consequence, rotations are slightly more hindered and shifted to the red. For librations, on the other hand, a higher potential energy barrier means that the molecule loses kinetic energy faster, reaching the maximum amplitude of its libration sooner. Frequencies of a libration are, therefore, blue-shifted. This effect can be observed particularly well for overtones since the shifts of the fundamental frequencies are multiplied there as well. Finally, stretching vibrations are shifted to lower frequencies, presumably due to a less sharp potential with respect to the bond distance. Qualitatively, however, GHF and MP2 PESs produce the same results. Note that, by also calculating the Berry curvature at the MP2 level of theory, the differences might be larger.\nOne very important contribution to the rotational and vibrational spectra has been neglected up until now. So far, only those trajectories and spectra were shown and discussed that were generated from initial conditions corresponding to a parallel orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field, that is, the equilibrium conformation. In principle, while any conformation on the PES could be used as the initial geometry and for molecules in field-free simulations, it is generally assumed that the equilibrium geometry is a good starting point.\nFor H2 in a strong magnetic field, however, this equilibrium orientation is a special point on the PES for two reasons. First, at equilibrium, no initial energy can be put into the precession around the (z) axis, meaning that the entire initial nuclear kinetic energy is put into rotations pointing toward the potential energy barrier. As a consequence, the potential energy barrier can be overcome relatively easily, which is not at all representative of the system in general. These initial conditions, thus, favor rotations over librations. Second, the splitting of the (x, y)\u00b1 components presented so far could be taken to imply that their coupling is constant, but this is only true for simulations started from the parallel-field orientation since no initial rotation about the field axis can be excited. By choosing a different starting geometry, an initial energy can also be added to these rotations, leading to different coupling constants.\nSince simulations started from the equilibrium orientation are, thus, not necessarily representative of the ensemble, they should be viewed with some caution. Different initial conditions and especially different initial orientations can change the spectrum quite significantly. Nevertheless, simulations started from the equilibrium orientation will exhibit all effects induced by an external magnetic field and, as such, they are a good starting point for a qualitative assessment of rotational and vibrational spectra of H2 in a strong magnetic field.\nD. Impact of field strength on the spectrum Having discussed the general changes of rotational spectra in external magnetic fields, the next step will be an investigation of how those changes occur depending on the magnetic field strength. For this, a set of 200 spectra were calculated for field strengths between 0B0 and 2B0 while keeping the initial velocity fixed for all simulations. By plotting all peaks with an intensity above a given threshold against the magnetic field strength, it is possible to observe how the spectrum changes gradually. This is depicted in Fig. 5. The\nJ.

It should, however, be stressed that other initial conditions would lead to different spectra.\nStarting from the zero-field case and going up to higher magnetic field strengths, this section\u2019s aim is a quantitative assessment of a rovibrational spectrum as a function of the field strength. It should be noted that the graph in Fig. 5 is not sensitive to the intensities of the peaks. Often, different intensities can differ by a factor of up to 103, for instance, a stretching vibration and its first harmonic. Nevertheless, it can be fruitful to track even small peaks in order to capture all effects of the magnetic field on the spectrum. It is, however, necessary to be able to differentiate between very small peaks and background noise, which is why a threshold intensity needs to be defined. Every signal with an intensity greater than the threshold is considered to be a peak. For very small peaks with intensities close to the threshold, it is, thus, possible that they are visible at a certain field strength but not at another one. This does not imply that a peak vanishes, just that its intensity dropped below the arbitrarily but carefully chosen threshold."

Consequently, the second rotational overtones start to appear in the spectrum. As expected for a rotation, only uneven multiples of the fundamental frequency appear in the spectrum, so the first overtone is missing. Furthermore, the nuclear velocities interact with the magnetic field and a precession around the field axis (z) is induced. This precession couples to all frequencies assigned to the (x, y) components of the rotational modes, and hence, they are split into doublets, while peaks belonging to the (z) component remain unaffected. As mentioned before, the isolated frequency of the precession never appears in any of the spectra and can only be observed through the couplings to other rotational modes.\n3. 0.1\u20130.4B0 The height of the potential energy barrier increases and slows down the rotational movement. As a consequence, all frequencies corresponding to the rotation are red-shifted. In addition, even more overtones become visible.

As the potential energy barrier becomes even higher, the initial kinetic energy is no longer large enough for a rotation to take place. At this point, the calculated trajectory alternates between very slow rotations and a libration, which is why no evaluable spectrum can be obtained from it. This might be fixed by choosing a longer simulation time. The transition from the rotational case to the librational one can be seen clearly in Fig. 5. The most noticeable changes in the spectrum are the shifted frequencies belonging to the (z) component of the modes that now appear at even multiples of the fundamental frequency. Furthermore, the stretching vibration and its first harmonic now not only exhibit P- and R-branches but also a Q-branch belonging to the uncoupled vibrational frequency of (z) symmetry.\n5. 0.4\u20131.5B0 As expected, the frequencies of librations are blue-shifted because the potential energy barrier increases even further with the field strength. A similar blue-shift can also be obtained for the Q- and R-branches of the stretching vibration due to a sharper potential in the bond distance. The P-branch, on the other hand, is red-shifted because the corresponding libration frequencies with which the P-branch couples show a stronger blue-shift than the Q-branch. In this region, three particular field strengths (0.56B0, 0.67B0, and 1.2B0) exhibit unusual behavior. At these points, peaks of modes belonging to the same symmetry cross, leading to a resonance phenomenon where many modes couple in an almost chaotic fashion, creating a multitude of small coupled peaks. For these particular field strengths, librational overtones and coupled stretching vibrations appear at the same frequencies, which implies that the coupling is almost akin to a Fermi resonance. It should be noted that these resonances can only appear for crossings of the same symmetry, for example, an (x, y) libration crosses a (x, y) stretching vibration or the same pattern for the (z) component."

Essentially, the librational movement can be well described by a harmonic approximation, simplifying the spectrum significantly.

Furthermore, a strong coupling between liberations and stretching vibrations leads to an interconnection between these two phenomena, making them almost indistinguishable. The spectrum is now more akin to that of a harmonic oscillator, which is to be expected as the physical case slowly enters the Landau region.\nIt should be emphasized once more that all spectra in Fig. 5 were generated from the same initial conditions (parallel orientation to the magnetic field, same nuclear kinetic energy).

For this investigation, we have chosen the canonical (N, V , T) ensemble so that integrals of peaks in the ensemble spectrum reflect the number of underlying modes. Note that, according to Ref. 61, this corresponds to a quantum-mechanical spectrum with the discrete rotational bands smeared out. At this point, we want to stress again that the power spectrum does not take into account spectroscopic selection rules. To obtain a representative ensemble for the temperature T, the initial velocities were randomly chosen from a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution at temperature T. The subsequent MD simulation was aborted after a suitable time period \u0394\u03c4 and a spectrum was generated. Then, a new set of initial velocities is drawn while the coordinates from the previous simulation are maintained.61 Finally, all calculated spectra are averaged, and in order to generate a smoother spectrum, the intensities were averaged over a constant interval of \u03c9 \u00b1 20 cm\u22121. A series of spectra generated for a canonical ensemble at 1500 K are shown in Fig. 6 for a subset of different magnetic field strengths.\nFor the field-free case, one rotational band can be observed, and for the stretching vibration, the corresponding P- and R-branches. If the magnetic field is increased, the first noticeable effect is the appearance of a Q-branch in the stretching vibration, which indicates the presence of librations. However, since the potential energy barrier is still relatively low, rotations are still more likely for this field strength.\nContinuing to higher magnetic field strengths, a small red-shift of the entire rotational band becomes visible. This is to be expected for rotations, implying that rotation-like trajectories dominate the ensemble for up to 0.4B0. For higher field strengths, on the other hand, the entire rotational band starts to be blue-shifted, which is the first indicator for a significantly increased number of librations in the ensemble. In addition, the first overtone of the rotation appears within the spectrum, indicating the anharmonicity of the respective\npotential. Both of these findings strongly imply that librations start to become more likely in this region and for higher field strengths.\nAs mentioned before, librational frequencies are expected to increase linearly with the magnetic field strength, which corresponds directly to the linear dependency between the librational frequency and the height of the potential barrier (see Fig. 2). Corresponding to the higher fundamental frequencies of librations, the coupling between P- and R-branches also becomes stronger. Furthermore, the Q-branch is blue-shifted as well, as the potential for the bond length becomes sharper, too. Finally, for field strengths larger than 1.6B0, the coupling to the precession becomes visible in the fundamental frequency of the libration, which splits into a doublet.\nIn summary, all major effects that have been described in Sec. IV A are present in the spectrum of the canonical ensemble. The effect of the magnetic field on a rotational spectrum can, thus, be summarized as an initial red-shift of the frequencies due to a majority of trajectories belonging to rotational movements. If the field strength becomes larger, the frequencies are blue-shifted as librations become more and more important. In addition, the first rotational overtones start to appear. Moreover, in the stretching vibrational spectrum, an additional Q-branch starts to appear, indicating the presence of librations. The frequency of the whole stretching vibration is also blue-shifted due to a sharper potential in the bond distance."

H2, on the other hand, is not IR active but possesses a Raman spectrum instead, which directly follows from basic principles of group theory and the rule of mutual exclusion for a molecule with a center of inversion.\nThe electronic states of LiH have previously been investigated by Stopkowicz et al.10 including electron correlation effects in a magnetic field. We have performed quantum-chemical calculations at the MP2/def2-TZVP level in order to confirm these findings at the level of theory used throughout this section. They are depicted in Fig. 7. While the singlet state (1\u03a3, 1A\u2032, or 1A depending on the orientation with respect to the magnetic field) is the most stable at small magnetic field strengths, the spin- and orbital-Zeeman contributions lead to a change in the electronic ground state at about 0.1B0. Above this field strength, the triplet states (3\u03a0, 3A\u2032, or 3A) become more stable. While 3\u03a0 and 3A\u2032 are in principle slightly bound, no stable vibrational state can exist within the potential energy wells of these states. Therefore, no vibrational or rotational spectra will exist for these states, and this work is only concerned with singlet states. While these singlet states may be excited states for all magnetic field strengths above 0.1B0, the general behavior of vibrational and rotational spectra for linear molecules with permanent dipole moments is still captured and, thus, worth investigating."

Figure 8(b) also depicts the potential energy barrier as a function of the angle between LiH and the external field for different field strengths.\nWhile a parallel equilibrium orientation (H2) only corresponds to a single conformation, there exists an infinite set of degenerate conformations for the perpendicular orientation (LiH). This is due to the fact that the molecule can be freely rotated around the azimuthal angle \u03d5, which is not referenced in Fig. 8(a). The immediate consequence of these different equilibrium conformations for H2 and LiH becomes apparent by examining the trajectories in Fig. 9. The clear distinction between rotations and librations as discussed for H2 cannot be made for LiH. While the hydrogen molecule must pass the maximum of the potential energy barrier (an infinite number of points corresponding to a 360\u25cb rotation in \u03d5) in order to perform a proper rotation, there is no need for LiH to perform a similar movement. As depicted in Fig. 9(a), LiH will instead have a precession-like movement corresponding to a rotation, and during such a trajectory, the molecule never passes the parallel conformation. Some trajectories may then be more rotation-like [Fig. 9(a)] and some more libration-like [Fig. 9(b)]; however, a clear distinction between these two phenomena cannot be made anymore.

The same is true for LiH, and thus, a precession is obtained in a similar manner. However, this behavior is dependent on the nuclear kinetic energy of the system, and if it sinks below a certain limit, the precession is replaced by a more libration-like trajectory around the magnetic field axis. This is somewhat surprising since the molecule behaves as if it were interacting with an additional potential energy barrier for an orientation parallel to the direction of the intrinsic translation.

A plausible explanation for this behavior is that the Lorentz force interacts with the pseudocharges of the permanent dipole moment while the aforementioned intrinsic translation is coupled to the center-of-mass movement of the molecule. The complex interaction between these two movements leads to the presence of a pseudopotential dependent on the initial conditions, and only one of these motions can relax at the same time. The consequence of this can be seen as a twitching in the intrinsic translation, which, thus, becomes more wave-like.\nTo summarize the differences between the nuclear dynamics of the hydrogen and lithium hydride molecules, the presence of a permanent dipole moment and a perpendicular equilibrium orientation leads to somewhat different trajectories for LiH. While for H2 a clear distinction between rotations and librations can be made, this is no longer possible for LiH. The precession around the field axis induced by Lorentz force and Berry curvature can be present for both molecules; however, for LiH, the nuclear kinetic energy needs to be above a certain threshold for this to occur. If the kinetic energy drops below this limit, LiH interacts with a velocity-dependent pseudopotential and rotation-like movements are replaced by more libration-like movements."

            "text": "The LiH molecule possesses a permanent dipole moment. Therefore, we have not only computed power spectra from the nuclear velocities but also a spectrum from the time derivative of the dipole moment according to Eq. (10) of Ref. 60 (Fig. 10). For a spectrum corresponding to a more rotation-like movement, the rotational and vibrational spectra of LiH and H2 are very similar. Rotational overtones appear at every odd multiple of the fundamental frequency. In addition, couplings to the precession will split peaks corresponding to (x, y, z) components of the rotational movement into (x, y) multiplets and (z) singlets. Libration-like movements are, on the other hand, slightly different from H2. Due to the in someway inverted potential barrier [see Figs. 2(b) and 8(b)],\nthe order of the peaks is also inverted. Therefore, peaks corresponding to the (z) component now occur at odd multiples of the fundamental frequency, and peaks corresponding to the (x, y) components can be found at even positions. This is summarized in the following patterns:\n(x, y, z)rot \u2192 (x, y, z)\u00b1,\u2205, (x, y, z)\u00b1,\u2205, . . . ,\n(x, y, z)lib \u2192 (z), (x, y)\u00b1, (z), (x, y)\u00b1, . . . .\nA similar coupling pattern is also found for the stretching vibration, where the additional Q-branch now corresponds to the (x, y) components,\n(x, y, z)libsv \u2192 . . . , (x, y) \u00b1, (z), (x, y)\u00b1, (z), (x, y)\u00b1, . . . .\nMoving on, the effects of the precession and libration also differ from the H2 case, where it was responsible for a splitting of all frequencies active in the (x, y)\u00b1 component into doublets. For a more rotationallike movement, the fine structure of the peaks is analogous to the H2 molecule, and thus, all peaks corresponding to the (x, y) components of the movements are split into doublets. The precession itself is not visible in the power spectrum and only appears through its couplings.\nFor low nuclear kinetic energies, the precession is replaced by a libration-like movement. For an orientation parallel to the (x)-axis, the intrinsic translational movement points toward the (y) direction, and therefore, all peaks corresponding to the (y) component couple to an even multiple of the fundamental frequency of the precession. The peaks corresponding to the (x) component, however, couple to odd multiples of it. Thus, all peaks of the (x, y) components split into multiplets of alternating symmetry according to the following pattern:\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 054106 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0097800 157, 054106-13\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:18:10\nFor an initial orientation of the molecule parallel to the (y) axis, this pattern is simply inverted,\n(x, y)\u00b1 \u2192 . . . , (y), (x), (y), (x), (y), . . . .\nHere, the similarities to the stretching vibration become apparent as a peak of (x, y, z)libsv character is coupling in a very similar manner."

            "text": "In order to obtain a spectrum that is independent of the chosen set of initial conditions, a canonical ensemble from a set of 2000 spectra was calculated. For all simulations, the initial velocities were drawn from a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution using a target temperature of 1500 K. In order to obtain a smoother spectrum, the wavenumber \u03c9 was averaged over a constant interval (\u03c9 \u00b1 20 cm\u22121).\nThe field-free spectrum of LiH shows a strong rotational band and corresponding P- and R-branches for the stretching vibration (Fig. 11). As the magnetic field strength increases, the P- and R-branches broaden and an additional Q-branch appears, which cannot be resolved in detail. The stretching vibration itself (including P-, R-, and Q-branches) is blue-shifted for higher field strengths due to a sharper potential energy surface connected to the bond length. For field strengths greater than 0.2B0, libration-like movements begin to dominate the ensemble and their first overtones become clearly visible in form of a shoulder of the fundamental frequency."

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this work, we have presented a detailed analysis of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for linear molecules in strong magnetic fields and investigated the rovibrational spectra of the H2\nand LiH molecules. Nuclear trajectories were simulated using an adapted Tajima algorithm, which includes the screening of nuclear charges by the electrons through the inclusion of the Berry curvature tensor. Compared to the auxiliary coordinates and momenta (ACM) algorithm developed in previous work, the Tajima propagator is significantly more efficient without any loss of accuracy. In addition, no empirical coupling constant needs to be adjusted for the Tajima propagator, making it the algorithm of choice.\nRovibrational spectra of H2 and LiH in magnetic fields up to 2B0 were simulated and carefully assessed. For molecular rotations, an energy barrier induced by the external field leads to hindered rotations (librations) at higher field strengths. The stretching vibration couples to rotations as well as to librations, but in a slightly different pattern since all nuclear motion has to be distinguished between different Cartesian components due to the broken isotropy of space. As a result, the coupling between stretching vibrations and rotational motion only results in P- and R-branches while an additional Q-branch becomes visible for coupling between vibrations and librations. The existence of a Q-branch may, therefore, be used as an indicator for librational motion at higher magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, rovibrational spectra exhibit signals belonging to precessions as previously observed for H2 as well as an intrinsic translation for molecules with permanent dipole moments such as LiH. All effects listed here as well as the increasing importance of rotational overtones in stronger fields are not only visible in individual spectra but also in canonical ensembles of spectra.\nHaving established the key components of calculating and interpreting rovibrational spectra in strong magnetic fields, the door is opened for further investigations on even larger systems. The effects of electron correlation beyond second-order perturbation theory on rovibrational spectra may also be of interest in future work. A fully quantum-mechanical treatment of rotational motion using, for instance, the rigid rotor approximation in a strong magnetic field could also provide more insight by including purely quantum effects such as nuclear tunneling."
