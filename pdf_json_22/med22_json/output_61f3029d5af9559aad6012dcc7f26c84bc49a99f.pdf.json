    "abstractText": "Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to identify clinical studies concerning the impact of intra-articular administration of hyaluronic acid (HA) on mandibular mobility and to make an attempt at determining the efficacy of HA in this indication. Methods: The review included primary studies involving groups of at least 10 patients who were diagnosed with pain in the temporomandibular joint and who were injected with hyaluronic acid as the only intervention. The outcomes pursued were changes in mandibular mobility and pain intensity. Four databases of medical articles were searched, including PubMed and BASE. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane methodology tools. The therapy\u2018s efficacy was calculated in the domains of mandibular abduction, protrusive movement, lateral mobility, and pain relief. For these values, the regression and correlation with variables characterizing the interventions were analyzed. Results: In total, 16 reports on 20 study groups with a total of 1007 patients qualified for the review. The mean effectiveness in the domain of mandibular abduction over the 6-month follow-up period was 122% of the initial value, and the linear regression model can be expressed as 0.5x + 36. The level of pain in the same time frame decreased to an average of 29%. The severity of pain 6 months after the beginning of treatment positively correlates with the number of injections per joint (0.63), the total amount of drug administered in milliliters (0.62), and the volume of drug administered monthly per joint (0.50). Limitations: In some studies, the patient groups were heterogeneous in terms of diagnosis. The studies varied depending on the joint into which the HA was administered. The synthesized studies differed with regard to the method of measuring the mandible abduction amplitude. Conclusions: The increase in the amplitude of mandibular abduction was expressed as the quotient of the mean values during the observation periods, and the initial value was achieved in all study groups, and in the linear regression model, it was 0.5 mm on average per month. Multiple administrations of the drug may reduce the analgesic effectiveness of the treatment.",

Restrictions in the mobility of the mandible can be a consequence of TMJ pain, classified in accordance with, among others,\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 1901. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11071901 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 1901 2 of 19\nthe International Classification of Orofacial Pain, 1st edition (ICOP) [1,2]. There is a substantial number of diverse treatments for abnormal function and hence pain in these joints [3,4]. The most frequently used methods of treating TMJs dysfunction include pharmacotherapy, physiotherapy, splint therapy, surgery (arthroscopy in particular), and intra-articular punctures [3,4]. The latter may be rinsing of the joint cavity (called arthrocentesis), intra-articular administration of autogenous blood products (e.g., platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or injectable platelet rich fibrin (I-PRF)) or drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) [3\u20137]. In addition, TMJ punctures allow for viscosupplementation, i.e., administration of the synovial fluid\u2019s main component, hyaluronic acid (HA) [3,4]. The administration of HA into the TMJ cavity is a surgical procedure that does not require hospitalization, same as arthroscopy; multiple synovial fluid replacements, e.g., arthrocentesis; additional puncture into a peripheral vein, such as therapy with blood products; or administration of drugs with many known side effects, for instance, intraarticular corticosteroid therapy [3]. The absence of the above-mentioned drawbacks and numerous positive evaluations of HA administration to TMJ suggest that this therapy may be the solution of choice in many circumstances, especially in patients for whom a more invasive treatment is contraindicated."

Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 1901 5 of 19\n2.9. Synthesis Methods 2.9.1. Efficiency Evaluation\nThe condition required to include a given group of HA treated in the collective synthesis of effectiveness was the ability to calculate at least one value of effectiveness in a given domain. The quantitative synthesis covered only the groups treated with HA and was carried out in the domains: (1) maximal mandibular abduction; (2) range of mandibular protrusive movement; (3) the range of lateral mobility of the mandible; (4) joint pain. In the above-mentioned domains, the relative coefficients of the opening efficiency, protrusion, and lateral mobility, as well as changes in the level of pain, were taken into account, independent of the absolute values of individual variables. In the case of several measurement methods in (1) domain, the maximum unassisted opening of the mouth was included in the synthesis, and in its absence, the maximum abduction of the mandible without pain. The maximum assisted opening was only taken into account in the absence of both of the above-mentioned measurements. Due to the assessment of the lateral mobility range of the mandible in some studies, taking into account the healthy and the diseased side, and in others the right and left side of the body, the arithmetic mean of the effectiveness for lateral movements was calculated according to the formula:\ne = (e1 + e2)/2,\nwhere e1 and e2 are different efficiencies of lateral mobility within one test group.\n2.9.2. Regression Analysis\nMeta-regression analysis was performed for each of the domains. The fitted regression models are shown as trend lines in graphs showing the change in treatment effectiveness over time. This analysis, apart from determining the averaged effectiveness of therapy with intra-articular injections of HA, allowed for the indication and an attempt to interpret the outliers. The coefficient of determination was denoted as R2.\n2.9.3. Correlation Analysis\nThe correlation was searched between data items (5)\u2013(10), (12), (14), (17), the initial values of variables, and efficiencies in domains (1)\u2013(4) after 1 and 6 months. In case of the unknown value of the variable after 6 months, the value after 12 months was given for the purposes of this analysis, and in the absence of both, the closest. Coefficients with more than half of the missing data were discarded. To determine the correlation, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients (r) were calculated and presented in the form of a matrix. To calculate the t-score (t) of each correlation, the following formula was used:\nt = r \u221a (n \u2212 2)/ \u221a (1 \u2212 r2),\nwhere n is a sample size. Test probability (p) was calculated using the two-tailed Student distribution. The adopted significance level was \u03b1 = 0.05."

Pain\nThe severity of pain 6 months after the beginning of treatment positively correlates with the number of injections per joint (0.63), the total amount of drug administered in milliliters (0.62), and the volume of a drug administered monthly per joint (0.50). These correlations are not strong, but they are enough to raise suspicions whether repeated interventions reduce the analgesic effect, i.e., fewer administrations of HA may be more effective in managing TMJ pain. The intensity of pain after 6 months, starting from the beginning of the therapy, depends, to some extent (0.45), on the initial pain value as well. This means that the stronger the pain before starting the treatment, the greater its severity may remain during the follow-up period.\n3.6.2. Abduction\nThere is a stronger than the previous negative correlation (\u22120.70) of the increase in the maximum opening of the mouth after 6 months from the beginning of the treatment with the initial values of this variable. Therefore, it can be assumed that the stronger the restriction of vertical mobility of the mandible, the greater the effect in this domain will be achieved by HA therapy. Weak negative correlations are observed between the increase in the maximum mandibular abduction after six months from the beginning of treatment and\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 1901 16 of 19\nthe following values: (1) ml of the drug per injection (\u22120.34); (2) number of injections per joint (\u22120.24); (3) total amount of drug administered per joint expressed in ml (\u22120.30); (4) the number of ml of drug administered monthly per joint (\u22120.28). For the four correlations mentioned, the p coefficient did not reach the required value. However, the possibility that a greater supply of HA reduces the effectiveness of the therapy should be taken into account."

Limitations of the Evidence 4.5.1. Patient Description\nIn some studies, patient groups were heterogeneous in terms of diagnosis. In future reviews involving subsequent reports, it is worth considering subgrouping patients with the following diagnoses in particular: (1) disk displacement with reduction; (2) disk displacement without reduction; (3) osteoarthritis, and (4) degenerative joint disease. Such division may help in assessing the effectiveness of HA therapy in individual patient groups.\n4.5.2. Intervention Description\nThe studies differed in the compartment of the joint into which the HA was administered. Assessment of the effectiveness of HA therapy depending on the administration to\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 1901 17 of 19\nthe upper or lower part of the joint cavity (above or below the articular disc) is a significant problem and should be considered in future systematic reviews based on more reports. In addition, various drugs containing HA in different concentrations have been used, which further complicates the formulation of strong conclusions.\n4.5.3. Comparators Description\nIn this systematic review, baseline values for the variables of mobility and pain were taken as reference values. The efficacy of HA treatment compared to alternative therapies was addressed in the discussion. More high-quality studies comparing HA treatment with placebo with alternative treatments are needed, especially arthrocentesis and intra-articular administration of blood products.\n4.5.4. Outcomes Description\nThe synthesized studies differed with regard to the method of measuring the amplitude of the mandible abduction. The authors of this systematic review are not aware of any studies indicating the most appropriate method of measuring this value. For the purposes of the synthesis, it was assumed that in the case of varying methods of measuring the extent of mandible abduction, the maximum value of the opening that is unsupported manually should be used, and then the value of the maximum pain-free mouth opening. Only in the absence of the above-mentioned data, the value of the manually assisted opening of the mouth was used.\n4.6. Limitations of the Review Processes 4.6.1. Settings\nOnly the reports published in English were eligible for systematic review.\n4.6.2. Information Sources\nDue to the transparency and repeatability of the selection process, it was decided to search only the databases with free access. This could have resulted in the omission of reports indexed only in commercial databases, in particular those kept by publishers."

The increase in the amplitude of mandibular abduction was expressed as the quotient of the mean values during the observation periods, and the initial value was achieved in all study groups, and in the linear regression model, it was 0.5 mm on average per month. The increase in the mouth opening range is probably inversely proportional to the initial value of this parameter. The mean value of pain in the temporomandibular joints decreased in each of the study groups over the course of the therapy. Multiple administrations of the drug may reduce the analgesic effectiveness of the treatment.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/jcm11071901/s1, Supplementary S1: PRISMA 2020 Checklist; Supplementary S2: PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts Checklist; Supplementary S3: Stages of qualifying articles for systematic review.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: M.C., M.S. and D.C.; data curation: M.C., Z.N. and K.C.; investigation: M.C., Z.N., K.C. and M.S.; writing\u2014original draft: M.C., K.C. and M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing: M.S., Z.N. and D.C.; supervision: D.C.; overall responsibility: M.S. and D.C.
