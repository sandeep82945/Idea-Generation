1. **Investigate the impact of different 3D data representations on viewpoint understanding.** The current study uses a spherical camera system to represent 3D objects. However, other representations, such as point clouds or meshes, may be more suitable for certain tasks or objects. Future research could explore how different representations affect the performance of viewpoint retrieval models.


2. **Develop new methods for evaluating viewpoint understanding in L&V models.** The current study uses a KL divergence-based metric to evaluate the quality of viewpoint retrieval. However, this metric may not be sensitive to all types of errors. Future research could develop new metrics that are more comprehensive and informative.


3. **Explore the use of viewpoint understanding in other L&V tasks.** Viewpoint understanding is a fundamental aspect of many L&V tasks, such as image-based navigation, object manipulation, and scene understanding. Future research could explore how viewpoint understanding can be used to improve the performance of these tasks.


4. **Investigate the use of viewpoint understanding in real-world applications.** The current study focuses on synthetic data. However, it is important to understand how viewpoint understanding generalizes to real-world data. Future research could explore the use of viewpoint understanding in real-world applications, such as robotics and autonomous vehicles.


5. **Develop new L&V models that are specifically designed for viewpoint understanding.** The current study uses a pre-trained CLIP model that was not specifically designed for viewpoint understanding. Future research could develop new L&V models that are specifically designed for this task. These models could potentially achieve better performance than pre-trained models that are fine-tuned on viewpoint-specific data.
