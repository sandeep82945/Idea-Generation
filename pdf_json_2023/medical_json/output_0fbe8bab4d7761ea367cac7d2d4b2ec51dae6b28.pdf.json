    "abstractText": "Background Acute chest discomfort is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department. There is a paucity of studies related to clinico-epidemiological profile of patients with acute chest discomfort in the emergency department (ED). Hence, we intended to conduct the study to address the dearth of research in this field. Aims and objectives The primary objective of this study was to study the clinico-epidemiological profile of patients with acute chest discomfort presenting to the ED. The secondary objectives were to assess the prevalence of premature acute coronary syndrome (ACS), to study the ED disposition and final hospital discharge diagnosis, and to assess the predictors of 24-hour mortality in such patients. Methods A prospective observational study of patients presenting with acute chest discomfort was conducted in the emergency medicine department of a tertiary care hospital. We included adults above the age of 18 years from December 2021 to December 2022 and excluded trauma patients. A standardized form was used to document patient demographic patterns, comorbidities, chest discomfort description, physical findings, investigations, consultations, ED management, and disposition. Variables having p-value \u2264 0.05 were considered to be significant. Results A total of 200 patients were included. The most common cause of chest discomfort in the ED was cardiac, accounting for 48.5% (n = 97) of patients. The most common cardiac cause of acute chest discomfort was STelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) ~ 21% (n = 42). Cardiac diagnosis was associated with the maximum number of admissions (\u224880%; n = 78). The prevalence of premature ACS was 13.9% (n = 10). A 24-hour mortality was significantly associated with male gender, ambulance transport, history of coronary artery disease, and hypoxia and hypotension at the initial presentation. Conclusions ACS followed by respiratory causes are the predominant etiologies of acute chest discomfort in the ED. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of acute chest discomfort in the ED can aid in prompt diagnosis and delivery of lifesaving treatment to these patients.

Discomfort can be categorized as somatic or visceral in origin. Somatic discomfort includes pain from the musculoskeletal structures, coverings of major organs, and dermal tissues, whereas visceral discomfort includes pain from organs like\nHow to cite this article Chanda A, Kaeley N, Kumar B, et al.

Cureus 15(9): e44681. DOI 10.7759/cureus.44681\nthe heart, liver, etc. [2].\nDifferentiating between life-threatening and non-life-threatening causes of chest pain is a key aspect of emergency medicine [3].\nPotentially life-threatening causes include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism (PE), ruptured aortic aneurysm, and tension pneumothorax. In patients with non-life-threatening chest discomfort, a diagnosis can be made only after a thorough work-up [2].\nStudies have reported that patients with non-cardiac chest discomfort and a normal coronary angiogram may be suffering from various psychiatric disorders, most commonly panic disorder, anxiety, and depression [2].\nACS is a group of conditions caused by a sudden blockage of the blood supply to the heart. It constitutes an important problem because of the devastating effect of this disease on the more active lifestyle of young adults [4].\nThere are no universal definitions/criteria to describe the cut-off age for premature ACS, so we defined a case with premature ACS as one below the age of 40 years as described in a study by Noeman et al. [5].\nAcute chest discomfort is one of the common emergencies. There is a paucity of studies in the Indian population describing the causes, prevalence, and disposition of patients with acute chest discomfort presenting to the emergency medicine department of a tertiary care hospital. Expanding our knowledge base on the etiologies, required investigations, and management of patients with acute chest discomfort will aid emergency physicians in focused, appropriate, and cost-effective patient care. It can aid in the formulation of a diagnostic algorithm and protocolized management of acute chest discomfort."

It is a tertiary care government hospital situated in the state of Uttarakhand, India. The study population consisted of patients above the age of 18 years presenting to ED with acute non-traumatic chest discomfort from December 2021 to December 2022. We took 200 as the sample size following the convenient consecutive sampling method.\nThe aims of the study were to study the clinico-epidemiological profile of patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the ED, to assess the prevalence of premature ACS, to study the ED disposition and final hospital diagnosis or discharge, to assess the predictors of mortality in patients with acute chest discomfort.\nThe attending emergency medicine resident used a standardized form to document patient demographics, comorbidities, chest discomfort description, physical findings, investigations, consultations, ED management, and disposition. The included patients were followed up in the hospital till discharge/death for final diagnosis and outcome.\nAll data was entered into an Excel sheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and analyzed using the SPSS software version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and the outcome were measured as mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.\nData presentation was done graphically wherever appropriate using histograms for quantitative data and bar charts/pie charts for qualitative data. The prevalence of ACS was expressed in proportion.\nThe association between two categorical variables was explored using the Chi-square test. In case the expected frequency in the contingency tables was found to be less than five for >25% of the cells, Fisher\u2019s exact test was used instead.\nAssociations between variables where one is continuous and one is categorical were explored using independent sample \u201ct\u201d-test when the categorical variable had two categories and one-way ANOVA when it had more than two categories. If data was found to be non-normally distributed, appropriate non-parametric tests in the form of the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U Test/Kruskal-Wallis Test were used for these comparisons. Statistical significance was kept at p < 0.05."

DOI 10.7759/cureus.44681 10 of 14\nThis was a prospective observational study to evaluate the patients with non-traumatic acute chest discomfort in the tertiary care hospital of Uttarakhand.\nTwo hundred patients were enrolled in the study. A thorough work-up was done by the primary attending physician. The patients were then treated, and their disposition was done accordingly.\nEtiology of acute chest discomfort Participants with cardiac cause of chest pain were older than the average age with a mean (\u00b1 SD) age of 56.6 years \u00b1 14.83. Comorbidities of hypertension (47.4%; n = 46) and diabetes mellitus (42.3%; n = 41) were the most prominent in the cardiovascular disease group. These findings were similar to the study done by Geyser et al. [2]. This could be explained by the fact that non-communicable diseases are common in the geriatric population. In particular, cardiovascular patients were transported more by ambulance than by their own or private transport; this could be because of the critical illness of the cardiac patients, and a majority of patients were referred from primary care centers via ambulance.\nThe most common diagnosis for pulmonary cause of chest pain made in ED was pneumonia (46.2%; n = 24), which was followed by an acute exacerbation of COPD (26.9%; n = 14) followed by pleural effusion (7.7%; n = 4) and PE (5.8%; n = 3). About 13.5% (n = 7) of these patients were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis at some point in their lifetime. About 75% (n = 39) of these patients were smokers, and 36.5% (n = 19) of patients were diagnosed cases of COPD, which explains the high prevalence of acute exacerbations of COPD in our spectrum of pulmonary diagnosis.\nChest pain is commonly present in 60% of patients with PE, and PE is classically said to be one of the most frequently under-reported diagnoses [6]. Therefore, a detailed history and thorough clinical examination should be done along with point-of-care investigations to rule out PE as the diagnosis for acute chest discomfort.\nThe prevalence of gastrointestinal causes of acute chest discomfort in our patients was 11.5% (n = 23). Gastro-esophageal reflux disease is often reported in around one-third of cases of recurrent non-cardiac chest pain [7].\nMusculoskeletal cause of acute chest discomfort as final ED diagnosis was present in 7% (n = 14) of total patients. This might be a good reflection of the real frequency of musculoskeletal pathology in ED patients presenting with acute chest discomfort.\nIn our study, only 2.5% (n = 5) of cases were found to have somatization/psychiatric disorders. This could be attributed to the fact that detailed psychiatric evaluation is seldom done in ED patients. These patients are often referred to OPDs.\nPsychiatric diseases are one of the causes of hyperventilation in patients presenting to the ED [8]; however, we should rule out the more life-threatening causes of acute chest discomfort and hyperventilation first before considering a psychiatric cause of underlying illness in these patients.\nEpidemiological profile of patients with acute chest discomfort"

These results were comparable to the previous studies done by Knockaert et al. [9] and Buntinx et al. [10]. The mean age reported by these studies was 60 years. Most of the patients reported by previous studies were more than 50 years of age. It is a known fact that noncommunicable diseases such as ACS, hypertension, respiratory diseases, etc. are common among the geriatric population [11-14]. Although our population had younger patients (13.9%; n = 10) as well who presented with premature ACS, there has been an increase in cases of coronary artery disease among the younger population in the last three decades [15]. Patients with premature ACS have a similar risk factor profile, with smoking being the most common [16]. The incidence of coronary artery disease among younger patients varies between 12% and 16%, and around one-fourth of them are reported to be under 40 years of age [17]."

The underlying pathophysiology is that smoking causes a pro-thrombotic state, and a simultaneous reduction in the coronary reserve flow [19].\nThe most common comorbidities among the participants were hypertension (35.5%; n = 71) and diabetes mellitus (30.5%; n = 61). Geyser et al. [2] reported hypertension and diabetes mellitus as the most prevalent comorbidities in the cardiovascular disease group. Hypertension has been reported in around 31%-59% of patients with ACS [20,21]. Uncontrolled hypertension results in the formation of fatty deposits in the arteries and the development of vulnerable plaques whose instability or rupture is responsible for the development of ACS [22]. Diabetes mellitus is reported in approximately 30% of patients with ACS [23,24]. The underlying pathophysiology is endothelial dysfunction, plaque alteration, platelet activation, and coagulation disturbances. The interplay of these factors leads to an intense pro-thrombotic, pro-inflammatory state [25]."

ECG for most of the patients (91%) was done within 5-10 minutes of the ED presentation.\nIn our study, the prevalence of premature ACS that is present in <40 years old is 13.9%; 10 out of the total 72 participants had premature ACS (\u226440 years of age).\nThe last two to three decades have seen an exponential rise in coronary artery disease (CAD) cases in the young, but the data regarding premature coronary heart disease and ACS (\u2264 40 years) is limited [15].

Our results regarding the disposition of such patients were similar to the study done by Geyser et al. [2].
