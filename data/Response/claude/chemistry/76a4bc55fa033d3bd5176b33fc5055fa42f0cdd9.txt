 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the mechanisms of IBP synthesis, transport, and incorporation into plant cell walls. This could provide insights into how to enhance IBP content through breeding or biotechnology. 

2. Develop more efficient and non-destructive methods to extract IBPs from food matrices while preserving their bioactivity. This could enable better utilization of these compounds.

3. Conduct more in vivo studies on the bioavailability and metabolism of IBPs, especially through colonic fermentation. This is important to understand their health effects. 

4. Evaluate synergistic effects between IBPs and other phytochemicals or nutrients. This may reveal enhanced bioactivities compared to individual compounds.

5. Explore the potential of IBPs in food packaging and coating materials. Their antioxidant and antimicrobial effects could help improve food quality and safety.
