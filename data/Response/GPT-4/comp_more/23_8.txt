Expanding Multimodal Data Sources: Beyond aligning music and lyrics, future studies could explore the integration of additional modalities, such as music videos or live performance footage, to enrich the music captioning model. Incorporating visual cues from videos could provide deeper insights into the music's context, emotion, and narrative, potentially enhancing the accuracy and richness of generated captions.

Cross-Lingual and Cross-Cultural Music Captioning: Investigating the effectiveness of music captioning across different languages and cultural contexts could open new avenues for research. This includes developing models capable of understanding and captioning music from diverse cultural backgrounds, potentially leveraging cross-lingual learning techniques to handle multiple languages and dialects within music lyrics.

Personalization in Music Captioning: Tailoring music captioning to individual listener preferences and contexts could enhance user experience in streaming platforms. Research could focus on personalizing captions by incorporating listener history, demographic information, or situational context, thereby making music discovery and recommendation more relevant and engaging.

Improving Music Encoder Architectures: While the paper used a pre-trained music encoder with fixed parameters, future work could explore the development of novel music encoder architectures specifically optimized for music captioning. These could involve fine-tuning strategies or entirely new architectures that better capture the nuances of musical composition, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony, in relation to lyrics.

Ethical and Bias Considerations in Music Captioning: As the model learns from user-generated content, there's a potential risk of perpetuating biases or inaccuracies present in the dataset. Future research could focus on developing methods to identify, mitigate, and correct biases in music captioning datasets. Additionally, exploring ethical considerations in the automated interpretation of music and lyrics could ensure that generated captions are respectful, accurate, and inclusive of diverse perspectives and cultures.
