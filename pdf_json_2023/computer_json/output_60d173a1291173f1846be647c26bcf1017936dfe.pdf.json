All patients enrolled were split randomly into a training set and a validation set. Six ML models were established to evaluate the initiation of EN, and the best model was determined according to the area under curve (AUC) and accuracy. The best model was interpreted using the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values.\nResults: A total of 53,150 patients participated in the study. They were divided into a training set (42,520, 80%) and a validation set (10,630, 20%). In the validation set, XGBoost had the optimal prediction performance with an AUC of 0.895. The SHAP values revealed that sepsis, sequential organ failure assessment score, and acute kidney injury were the three most important factors affecting EN initiation. The individualized forecasts were displayed using the LIME algorithm.\nConclusion: The XGBoost model was established and validated for early prediction of EN initiation in ICU patients.\nKEYWORDS\nenteral nutrition, intensive care unit, machine learning, initiation, prediction\n1. Introduction\nThe nutritional status has a strong association with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. Malnutrition can lead to more complications, difficulty in ventilator discontinuation, prolonged length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU), and increased readmission rate and mortality (1). Enteral nutrition (EN) refers to a nutrition therapy that foods for special medical purposes are administered via the gastrointestinal tract. EN should be\u00a0 preferred when gastrointestinal function allows (2, 3)."

EN promotes the recovery of intestinal function and reduces the consumption of skeletal muscle. EN can also decrease the incidence of infection and mortality and shorten the time of hospitalization and medical expenses (4, 5). The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends early use of EN in appropriate critically ill patients (6). However, the proportion of EN feeding is suboptimal (7). Therefore, there is a need to identify highrisk patients who will benefit from early EN, which may aid clinicians in decision-making and improve the outcome of critically ill patients.\nAt present, EN initiation largely depends on physicians\u2019 awareness. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) with the ability to process complex data and quantify the risk of event occurrence (8). It includes logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), \u03ba-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), etc. (8). ML algorithms have been widely used in clinical nutrition and critical care (9\u201311), including diet pattern analysis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis prediction. However, it has not been applied to initiate EN in ICU patients. Accordingly, we\u00a0aimed to develop a model to predict EN initiation for patients in an ICU setting. This model can assist early identification of populations in need of EN, and provide a basis for physicians\u2019 decision-making to initiate EN. Furthermore, we\u00a0wished this model can guide the development of standard nutrition protocol and the improvement the nutrition therapy."

Age, sex, weight, and ethnicity were collected as demographic characteristics. Comorbidities in our study included diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic lung disease, liver disease, renal disease, tumor, dementia, rheumatic disease, intestinal fistula, short bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, abdominal hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, paraplegia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision coding systems were used to define these conditions (14). Within the first 24 h of their ICU stay, we\u00a0collected averages of vital signs such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, body temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2). We\u00a0extracted the maximum values in the initial 24 h admitted to ICU for laboratory findings (Supplementary Table S1). For treatment, EN route (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ), Nasogastric tube, and Nasointestinal tube), dialysis, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation were chosen within 24 h of ICU admission. Simplified Acute Physiology Score II for severity scores of illness and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were gathered within the initial 24 h after ICU admission. The missing data of all valuables in this study were below 20% and dealt with by the multiple imputation (MI) method (Supplementary Table S2). The main process of MI begins by creating multiple data sets, which are then analyzed separately to obtain a set of parameter estimate values. Finally, all estimates is combined and evaluated to get the plausible estimates for the missing data (15). In this study, we\u00a0perform MI using the MICE package of R software, whose default interpolation method is multiple imputation by chained equations. EN is defined as nutritional support via a nasoduodenal or nasogastric tube during the ICU (16). For each patient, the protein intake was 1.2\u20132.0 g/kg/ day and lower energy intake should be\u00a0preferred in the early stage (6). The optimal nutrition formula of patients was confirmed based on nutritional status and primary diseases."

Likely, the predicted outcome of the XGBoost model was that the risk of not using EN was 94% (Figure\u00a05A). The AKI and body temperature of 37.23\u00b0C contributed to the increased EN initiation rate. Factors that did not recommend EN were no PEG, no PEJ, no sepsis, no paraplegia, no cerebrovascular disease, or no nasointestinal tube. The other patient was a 34-year-old man and used EN.

            "text": "In this study, we\u00a0developed and validated the application of six machine learning methods for early evaluation of EN in ICU patients, and the XGBoost model showed the best accuracy. The ranking of feature importance and the influence of variables on XGBoost prediction were described per SHAP values. The top\u00a04 significant factors were sepsis, SOFA score, AKI, and body temperature. We\u00a0also used the LIME algorithm to perform the individualized predictions of XGBoost. Only 13.57% (7,210/53150) of patients used EN in this study. Early prediction of EN initiation may be\u00a0helpful to improve EN implementation in ICU patients.\nBased on the MIMIC-IV database, we\u00a0 developed and validated an effective tool for predicting EN initiation. XGBoost combines multiple weak classification tree models to establish an accurate prediction model. It offers the benefits of excellent generalization ability, automatic processing of missing values, flexibility and robustness, and fast operation speed. XGBoost, on the other hand, can solve this problem of overfitting or underfitting in ML models, which results from the low\noccurrence rate of the predicted events (the ratio of the number of events to the total number of samples is less than 1:10) (19). Choi et\u00a0 al. predicted refeeding hypophosphatemia, XGBoost showed higher accuracy than Logistic, Lasso, and Ridge pressures (20).\nAdditionally, explainable AI (XAI) was applied to facilitate users\u2019 comprehension of the decision-making process of the models (21). In the present study, SHAP values and the LIME method were incorporated into the XGBoost model to attain the highest predicted accuracy and interpretability. Individual explanations by the LIME algorithm can provide evidence for the model\u2019s prediction results and assist physicians in better use models when making decisions.\nOur study found that sepsis was the strongest predictor of EN initiation. In sepsis, inflammatory mediators induce the catabolism of protein, fat, and carbohydrate stored in the body, which leads to severe energy shortage in patients. There are studies showing that early moderate EN decreases mortality and incidence of secondary inflammation in sepsis patients (22, 23). Several guidelines recommend that EN be\u00a0 initiated early and gradually after hemodynamic stability (3, 17).

The prediction probabilities by LIME are depicted in the left of the two screenshots. The first 8 features that significantly affected on using EN or not are presented in the middle sections from top to bottom. The weight (importance) of each feature in risk prediction is indicated per the bar\u2019s length. The longer bar represents the more contribution to EN initiation or not. The critical values of these 8 features are shown on the right parts when they had the maximize effect on using EN or not.

In ranking the XGBoost model\u2019s feature importance, the SOFA score was found to be\u00a0the second key factor, consistent with previous findings (24). Increased nutritional intake can improve outcomes in patients with higher SOFA scores (24). In addition, AKI and body temperature were also important factors affecting EN initiation. The patients with AKI have not only abnormal metabolism of water and electrolyte but also carbohydrates, protein, and lipid. They are at high risk for malnutrition and muscle wastage (25). This study considered that the possibility of starting EN was greater, as the body temperature increase led to more body consumption. Unfortunately, a study showed that elevated body temperature was related to the failure of EN initiation in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (26). To investigate the relationship between body temperature and EN initiation, more studies should be\u00a0performed. Interestingly, this study found that the placement of PEG is another predictor of EN initiation. ESPEN recommends that PEG is preferred for patients with prolonged EN (27).\nThis was, as far as we\u00a0are aware, the first study to use the XGBoost model as a predictive tool in EN initiation. We\u00a0 are committed to opening the black box of ML models and using interpretable ML approaches (SHAP value and LIME algorithm) to better explain how predictors contribute to the model and how the model makes judgments. It is important to note that the study\nhas limitations. We\u00a0neglected to include the acute gastrointestinal injury grade, a crucial indicator of understanding gastrointestinal function, in the models\u2019 development, because it was not reported in the MIMIC-IV database. These may have led to selected bias. This is a retrospective study. The patients had already been discharged from the hospital at the time of data extraction, and the use of EN had already been determined. Thus, we\u00a0have no way of knowing if the EN was started according to the gold standard. Thirdly, XGBoost can explore the interaction between features, but not all interactions can be\u00a0displayed in LIME. Finally, this study developed a model based on single-center data and only conducted internal validation. These findings may not generalize to other populations. More factors need to be\u00a0included for further model optimization, and prospective multicenter studies should be\u00a0performed to verify the external applicability of this model."
