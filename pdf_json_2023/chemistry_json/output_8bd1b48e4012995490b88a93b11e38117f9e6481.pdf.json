    "abstractText": "Cationic surfactants carry antimicrobial activity, based on their interaction and disruption of cell membranes. Nonetheless, their intrinsic toxicity limits their applicability. To overcome this issue, a feasible strategy consists of using solid nanoparticles to improve their delivery. The zein nanoparticles were loaded with four cationic arginine-based surfactants: one single chain N\u03b1-lauroylarginine (LAM) and three Gemini surfactants N\u03b1 N\u03c9-Bis (N\u03b1-lauroyl-arginine) \u03b1, \u03c9\u2014diamide) (C3(LA)2, C6(LA)2 and C9(LA)2). Blank and loaded zein nanoparticles were characterized in terms of size, polydispersity and zeta potential. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeasts and the hemolytic activity were investigated and compared to the surfactants in a solution. Nanoparticles were found to be monodisperse, presenting a size of between 180\u2013341 nm, a pdI of <0.2 and a positive zeta potential of between +13 and +53 mV, remaining stable over 365 days. The nanoencapsulation maintained the antimicrobial activity as unaltered, while the extensive hemolytic activity found for the surfactants in a solution was reduced drastically. Nuclear Magnetic Ressonance (NMR), molecular docking and monolayer findings indicated that zein entraps the surfactants, interfering in the surfactant\u2013membrane interactions. Accordingly, the nanoepcasulation of arginine surfactants improved their selectivity, while the cationic charges were free to attack and destroy bacteria and fungi; the aliphatic chains were not available to disrupt the cellular membranes.",

Cationic gemini surfactants offer a different possibility for interacting with the cellular membranes of microorganisms [2]. These surfactants carry two polar heads and two fatty chains resulting from connecting with a spacer chain two single chain cationic surfactants. Their physicochemical properties make these molecules easily absorbed within solid\u2013liquid interphases, while the flexible structure can modify their properties [3]. One of the major sanitary concerns is the rise of resistant pathogens. Uncommon species of yeasts such as Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and more recently the worrisome\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2568. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032568 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2568 2 of 31\nCandida auris have been spreading over the last years. The number of antibiotic resistant bacteria has also been responsible for a rapid increment in infectious caused mortality. All these factors reinforce the urgent search for new potential treatments. An effective strategy to meet today\u2019s demand to heal a number of infections like pulmonary, skin or wounds, is to use cationic surfactants with antimicrobial properties. Those surfactants are molecules with an amphiphilic structure, containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. Their structure determines the physicochemical and biological properties, being determinant on their biomedical applicability. Cationic surfactants are extensively used in a number of fields, although they present an intrinsic toxicity which limits their applicability in medical treatments. Arginine-based cationic surfactants have shown great potential as antimicrobials because of their ability to interact with the negatively charged cell membranes [4], provoking their permeabilization and the extravasation of the intracellular content. This process occurs in two phases: First, the hydrophilic positivelycharged region interacts with the negatively-charged molecules of the membrane. Then, the hydrophobic region interacts with the lipid bilayer. This mechanism of action limits the microorganisms\u2019 resistance to surfactants. Moreover, their biocide effect was found to be more pronounced against bacteria than yeasts [5,6]. This difference can be attributed to the differences found in their cell wall composition. While the cell wall of yeasts is composed mainly of molecules with positive electrostatic balance, bacteria show negatively charged molecules in their surface: lipoteichoic acid for Gram positive and lipopolysaccharides for Gram negative strains. As a result, cationic molecules, such as surfactants, can interact easier with bacteria than yeasts. Despite these favorable properties, their activity, in some cases, is also limited by their limited solubility in water over the critical micellar concentration (CMC) [7]. Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) have shown some unique properties when designed for drug delivery, such as drug protection, controlled release, selective/enhanced activity and targeting. The PNPs\u00b4 structure is often designed to enable delivery to target cells or to reach metabolic pathways. Biopolymers are among the most advantageous materials to formulate nanocarriers, due to their superior biocompatibility and biodegradability. Zein, a prolamine found in the endosperm of maize (Zea mays), presents the ability to entrap and carry therapeutic molecules. This protein can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules and is listed in the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) FDA list. Recently, it has been used in the composition of different delivery systems, demonstrating its versatility as a nanocarrier [8\u201313]. These studies have shown that zein can modulate the release of their nanoparticles\u00b4 content in a non-aqueous environment such as simulated gastric and intestinal fluid, which allows the nanoparticles\u2019 content to resist adverse conditions such as acid and basic pH [12]. The use of nanotechnology is currently studied for several purposes in the medical field, including both the enhanced antimicrobial activity associated with a reduction in adverse effects [14,15]. A large range of materials have been used in the composition of drug delivery systems, while biopolymers present some advantages, such as: biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, easy handling and tolerable regulatory aspects. Zein was used in this study to prepare arginine-based nanoparticles. Zein presents key functional properties such as hydrophobicity, which facilitates the spontaneous formation of nanoparticles and the remarkable capability of carrying different molecules, such as drugs, genetic material and antigens [12] and in our case amino acid-based surfactants, allowing us obtaining nanoparticles with favorable properties. Despite the great effectiveness against microorganisms, amino-acid derived surfactants can also interact indiscriminately with the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, making them susceptible to toxicity. This is especially important with Gemini surfactants, as the gain in the antimicrobial activity is unbalanced with a higher hemolytic activity. This is still a major limitation for new biodegradable and biocompatible surfactants [15\u201317].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2568 3 of 31\nTherefore, in this paper, arginine-based surfactants (Figure 1) were loaded in the zein nanoparticles and evaluated in terms of antimicrobial and hemolytic activity in order to determine their selectivity. In addition, the interactions between zein and arginine-based surfactants have been investigated. Accordingly, the encapsulation of these surfactants in nanoparticles could reduce their hemolytic properties, thanks to the entrapment and controlled release, while their antimicrobial properties could be maintained [18].\nInt.

Nanoparticles\u2019 stability was tested at two different temperatures, at mild room temperature (25 \u25e6C) and, to mimic storage in a refrigerator, at (4 \u25e6C). Blank nanoparticles prepared by method A and stored at 4 \u25e6C (BNp-A-F) precipitated after 24 h, while those stored at 25 \u25e6C (BNp-A-R) remained unaltered over the studied period (Figure 2A). Blank nanoparticles prepared by method B were found more stable despite the storage temperature. At 25 \u25e6C (BNp-B-R), they only precipitated after 90 days (Figure 2A), while no precipitation was observed for the same formulation stored at 4 \u25e6C (BNp-B-F). The stability of BNp-B can be attributed to the fact that the particle size does not change over time. The value of the zeta potential gives an idea of the stability of the nanoparticle dispersion. When the zeta potential is larger than +15 mV or smaller than \u221215 mV the degree of stability is high [20]. For values of zeta potential within the interval [\u221215, +15] mV effects of aggregation, coagulation or flocculation appear due to van der Waals interparticle attraction. In our study, both nanoparticles BNp-A and BNp-B showed a zeta potential value higher than +15 mV at both temperatures 25 \u25e6C and 4 \u25e6C. BNp-B was found stable in all cases. However, BNp-A at 4 \u25e6C precipitates. Clearly, temperature determines the nanoparticles\u2019 stability."

They formed nanoparticles with homogeneous distribution (pdI 0.048 and 0.057, respectively) and presented a zeta potential over +30 mV, indicating a greater level of stability. The larger size observed in method A could be explained by the loading of the surfactant in the matrix of the nanoparticles, as it has been mixed together with zein previously to the nanoparticles\u00b4 formation and as such, could have occupied more extensively the protein pockets. Contrariwise, the surfactant could have been disposed majorly in the surface when the method B was used, possibly improving the protein packing and nanoparticles dispersion, reducing as a result their size, even when compared to the blank formulation. The LAM-loaded nanoparticles remained mostly stable in terms of size and zeta potential (>+27.4 mV) over 90 days (Figure 2B)."

These small differences may be due to the residual cationic charge of the arginine guanidino group from the interaction with zein. C3(LA)2 have a positive charge in each of the arginine guanidino groups, therefore, when coating the zein nanoparticles with the C3(LA)2 surfactant by method B, repulsions between the cationic charges are produced, preventing aggregation and particle size growth. The storage temperature of the C3(LA)2 zein nanoparticles did not change the particle size. No precipitation was found in these nanoparticles during this study (Figure 2C)."

The NOE-exchange relayed (NOEexch) experiment [23] is aimed to detect high-affinity ligands for species with sufficiently long T1 relaxing protons (KD between 1 mM up to 10 nM) producing a plot of normalized signal intensity with a characteristic \u2018dipping\u2019 curve for some of the ligand protons that is indicative of binding. We used those experiments to evaluate the surfactants: the zein mechanism of interaction and the role of the water as a co-solvent in the complexes formed under the conditions in which the sample is forming a colloidal dispersion, as it is required for the nanoparticles\u2019 formation. Figure 4 shows the 1H NMR spectra correspond to the pure surfactants used to prepare the nanoparticles. LAM is the single chain surfactant counterpart of the arginine Gemini surfactants C3(LA)2, C6(LA)2, C9(LA)2 in which the difference remains solely in the space chain. Therefore, their 1H spectra of the four surfactants are very alike, variating mostly in the intensity of the peaks. Table S2 lists the corresponding peaks of each surfactant. The spectra corresponding to the mixture of LAM with zein are shown in Figure 5. The STDoff-on spectrum (Figure 5b) shows the responses of the protons H-1 and H-11 of the surfactant upon saturation of the aliphatic protons of zein. The waterLOGSY (Figure 5c) shows the response of the proton H-15 of the surfactant which is mediated by bound water molecules. The NOE-exch curves (Figure 5e) did not detect binding given that the normalized intensity essentially grows monotonously for all the protons considered [23]. In summary, these results prove the formation of a complex LAM\u2013zein involving the aliphatic side chain of LAM and the positively charged guanidium group with this latter being in contact to bound water attached to the zein. The spectra corresponding to the mixture of C3(LA)2 with zein are shown in Figure 6. The STDoff-on spectra (Figure 6b,c) do not show any response to this surfactant upon saturation of the zein protons. In contrast, the waterLOGSY (Figure 6d) shows the response of the proton H-16 to the surfactant mediated by bound water molecules. The NOE-exch curves (Figure 6e) detect a dip for the curve of H-16 of the surfactant which is an indication of binding. In summary, these results prove that the formation of a complex C3(LA)2 \u2013zein involving the positively charged guanidium group is in contact to bound water that is attached to the zein. The spectra corresponding to the mixture of C6(LA)2 with zein are shown in Figure 7.

NMR Studies NMR experiments have been gradually gaining interest in the detection or characterization of macromolecule\u2013ligand or supramolecular\u2013ligand interactions. The STD experiment provides a simpler access to the ligand binding epitope and to other relevant aspects such as the ligand binding affinity in the regime of weak\u2013intermediate affinity (KD between 10 mM to 10\u22124 mM) [21].

Although basically all the studies on surface pressure-area isotherms involve amphiphiles that are practically insoluble in the subphase, soluble surfactants monolayers can also be compressed in some cases.

For example, Gemini arginine surfactants are partially soluble in water. Hence, they do not form high stable monolayers against surface pressure and their isotherms show a characteristic profile for partially soluble surfactants. Results are shown in Figure 12. Under compression, monolayers of the Gemini arginine surfactants form expanded gas and liquid phases. Their isotherms show that the larger the spacer chain, the more favorable is the adsorption of the surfactant at the air\u2013water interphase. For C9(LA)2, the surface pressure values are observed over wider areas than those of both C3(LA)2 and C6(LA)2 that show isotherm shapes that rapidly grow within a narrow area region. Gemini C9(LA)2 form more stable monolayers than their homologues, as suggested by the flat collapse shown in Figure 12.\nIn addition to the solubility, the differences observed on the monolayer can be attributed to the arrangement of the molecules of the cationic Gemini surfactants at the air\u2013water interface. Short spacer chains (C3, C6) entails reduced head group separation, leading to a head group with a high charge density and therefore the presence of repulsion forces between them which destabilizes the monolayer [24,25]. For longer spacer chains (C9) [26\u201328] as the monolayer is progressively compressed the spacer chain penetrates into the two hydrophobic chains forming part of the hydrophobic component of the surfactant and thus improving the cohesion forces between the molecules and the stability of the monolayer.\nFigure 12 shows plots of the surface pressure-area isotherm of zein at the water/air interface. The isotherm indicates that zein forms stable monolayers starting at a low surface pressure in the expanded state, followed by a steep increase in surface pressure as\ngas and liquid phases.

The isotherm indicates that zein forms stable monolayers starting at a low surface pressure in the expanded state, followed by a steep increase in surface pressure as liquid condensate.

Mixed Systems\nThe compression isotherms of arginine surfactants zein-systems were studied to know the extent to which the mixture compounds are forced into the bulk subphase. If the mixed isotherm is similar to that of the pure zein, it can be suggested that the surfactant desorbed totally when the mixed monolayer was compressed and weak or no interactions were present.

Figure 13 shows the isotherms of arginine surfactant\u2013zein mixtures. The profile of the obtained isotherms showed significant changes (Figure 13) compared to the isotherm of zein alone (Figure 12).\nThe isotherm of the C9(LA)2\u2013zein mixture is shifted to larger molecular areas. When it is compared to the profiles of each component of the mixture (Figure 12), it is observed that in the mixture the flat collapse observed in the C9(LA)2 isotherm has disappeared and the corresponding profile is similar to that of zein alone but moved to higher molecular areas. This shift suggests some kind of interaction between the two components of the mixture related to occupied area.\nThe profile isotherms of C3(LA)2 mixtures with zein are similar to that of C6 (LA)2 and both are displaced to lower molecular areas with respect to the profile of zein alone (Figure 13). This displacement could be interpreted as a dissolution towards the subphase of the components of the monolay r due to the formation of sol ble mixed aggregates.\nAs the three studied surfactants have two cationic charges in the arginine guanidino groups, in theory the ionic interactions of these groups with zein should be the same for the three surfactants, so the observed differences of the isotherm profile of the C9 (LA)2\u2013 zein mixture should have their origin in the hydrophobic interactions. In the air/water interface, the zein molecules oriented their polar residues to water subphase and the nonpolar residues to the air [29]. In this scenario, as C9(LA)2 has a large spacer chain which may form part of the hydrophobic, it can interact with the zein hydrophobic residues, reinforcing the zein\u2013surfactant interactions and increasing the area occupied by the two components of the monolayer.\nis compared to the profiles of each component of the mixture (Figure 12), it is observed that in the mixture the flat collapse observed in the C9(LA)2 isotherm has disappeared and the corresponding profile is similar to that of zein alone but moved to higher molecular areas.

The compressibility modulus (C) of the monolayer was computed from the surface pressure, \u03c0 and the area, A, data according to the equation\nC = \u22121/A (\u03b4A/\u03b4\u03c0)\nInt. J. Mol.

In general, the value of E depends on the state of the monolayer [31], in such a way that high values of E appear when the rigidity of the monolayer is high due to strong interfacial cohesive forces. For instance, high values of E (100\u2013200) are typical of condensed phases. Plots of E as a function of \u03c0 are shown in Figure 14. The values of E for zein increased with the increment of the surface pressure, reaching a maximum close to 70 m/mN, which corresponds to the almost condensed liquid phase. The shapes of the C9(LA)2\u2013zein mixture and zein are parabolas that share their starting and ending segments but with \u03c0 zein values being always higher.

Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of the monolayer can be inferred from its compressibility modulus [30]. The compressibility modulus (C) of the monolayer was computed from the surface pressure, \u03c0 and the area, A, data according to the equation C = \u22121/A (\u03b4A/\u03b4\u03c0)\nand the elastic modulus (E) that measures the resistance to elastic deformation is defined as\nE = 1/C = \u2212A (\u03b4\u03c0/\u03b4A)\nTo gain further insight into the surface properties of the Gemini arginine\u2013zein monolayers we analyzed the above compression isotherms (Figure 13) in terms of the E modulus as a function of \u03c0. In general, the value of E depends on the state of the monolayer [31], in such a way that high values of E appear when the rigidity of the monolayer is igh due t strong interfacial cohesive forces. For instance, high values of E (100\u2013200) re typical of condensed phases.\nPlots of E as a function of \u03c0 are shown in Figure 14. The values of E for zein increased with the increment of the surface pressure, reaching a maximum close to 70 m/mN, which c rr sponds to the almost condensed liquid phase. The shapes of the C9(LA)2\u2013zein mixture and zein are parabolas that share their starting and ending segments but with \u03c0 zein values being always higher. This aspect indicates that C9(LA)2 interacts favorably with zein in such a way that it does ot destabilize the monolayer. Plots of the rest of the surfactants present a different profile with maximum values of E being lower than those of the C9(LA)2\u2013zein mixture and zein alone.

C3(LA)2 solution exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than LAM. In general, Gemini surfactants show better antimicrobial efficiency than their single counterparts. For arginine Gemini surfactants the combination of their structural features (two positive charges and two alkyl chains per molecule) and their physicochemical properties (low critical micellar concentration and high solubility) seems to improve the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of these surfactants with the bacterial membranes [1]. C3(LA)2 nanoparticles (NpC3(LA)2) showed lower activity than the free surfactant although they maintained a very potent activity with MIC values lower than 20 \u00b5g/mL. These nanoparticles did not present inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and L. monocytogenes (Figure 15). Regarding their bactericidal activity (MBC), it was found that these aggregates can be considered good bactericidal agents against S. aureus and E. faecalis (MBC 17.8 \u00b5g/mL), while no bactericide activity was observed for the other strains (Figure S1). C6(LA)2 nanoparticles (Np C6(LA)2) showed similar or lower activity than pure solution of this Gemini surfactant. Regarding the preparation method, the nanoparticles Np C6(LA)2-A and Np C6(LA)2-B presented similar MIC values against P. aeruginosa, E. coli and E. faecalis, while none of them had any effect over B. subtilis (Figure 15). The bactericidal effect of NpC6(LA)2-A against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa was similar. Moreover, NpC6(LA)2-B and pure C6(LA)2 solution also showed similar MBC values against S. epidermidis (Figure S1). C9(LA)2 nanoparticles (NpC9(LA)2) (Figure 15) did not present inhibitory nor bactericide activity against the bacteria tested (Figure S1), unlike its solution that did show inhibitory and bactericide activity against most strains tested, with the exception of B. subtilis (Figures 15 and S1). Figures 16 and S2 show the activity of these systems against representative yeasts. Np-LAM-A exhibited very low MIC values against all microorganisms, it was noteworthy active (MIC 4.45 \u00b5g/mL) against C. auris, a novel Candida species that has been rapidly spreading and has shown high resistance to conventional antifungal drugs. The encapsulation of LAM in these nanoparticles using the method A improved the activity of this surfactant against the yeasts tested. However, nanoparticles prepared using method B were found to have lower activity than LAM in solution. The MFC followed the same tendency as the MIC values found for LAM nanoparticles prepared by methods A and B, where an equal or improved activity was found against most yeast, except for C. auris, C. paropsilosis and C. tropicalis (Figures 16 and S2). The Gemini C3(LA)2 pure solution showed better antifungal activity than its single chain homologue LAM. The C3(LA)2 nanoparticles (Np C3(LA)2) exhibited good antifungal efficiency (MIC values lower than 20 \u00b5g/mL) although the activity of the surfactant slightly decreases when it is incorporated into zein the nanoparticles and their efficiency was not affected by the preparation method (Figures 16 and S2). C6(LA)2 nanoparticles (NpC6(LA)2) also presented very good activity with a similar inhibitory activity to its solution against the yeasts tested (Figure 16), except for C. tropicalis and C. albicans, in which the MIC values of the nanoparticles were higher. The activity of the NpC6(LA)2 was in general lower than that obtained with the NpC3(LA)2. Notice than six of the eight strains tested exhibited MIC values lower than 10 \u00b5g/mL while for the other two strains the MIC values were lower than 20 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 16). The MFC was partially equivalent to the C3(LA)2 solution (Figure S2). Unlike the other Gemini surfactants, C9(LA)2 nanoparticles (NpC9(LA)2) exhibited remarkably higher MIC values against the yeasts tested, compared to it solution (Figure 16). Even so these nanoparticles also retain the antifungal activity with MIC values lower than 40 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 16). The MFC for NpC9(LA)2-A and specially NpC9(LA)2-B was also higher (Figure S2). A similar activity for both nanoparticles and its solution was maintained solely against C. jadinni and C. albicans.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2568 22 of 31\nIt has been reported that smaller nanoparticles have larger specific surface areas which result in better antimicrobial systems because these aggregates have greater probability to pass through the bacterial cell membrane [32].

A discrete decrease in the antimicrobial activity of these amino acid based surfactants was found when nanoencapsulated in the zein nanoparticles; but, in general, these aggregates still maintain a very potent antimicrobial activity. This difference is more notable in the Gemini surfactant with large spacer chains, C9(LA)2. In fact, the NpC9(LA)2- nanoparticles were not active against any bacteria tested unlike its solution, which presented still a good activity. The same behavior has been observed when phenylalanine\u2013arginine surfactants were loaded to the zein nanoparticles [34]. It was observed that in most cases the nanoparticles obtained by method A, where the surfactants were dissolved together with zein prior to the nanoparticles\u00b4 formation, were more effective than those obtained by method B, in which the surfactants were disposed in the zein nanoparticles previously formed, for both the yeasts and the bacteria. Few cases of low/lack of activity of the surfactant-nanoparticles were observed. The development of antibacterial nanoparticles is a promising approach for combating drug resistance [34]. Most of the antibiotic resistance mechanisms are irrelevant for antibacterial nanoparticles because the mode of action of these aggregates mainly involves direct contact with the bacterial cell wall and its disruption. This mode of action reduces the probability of bacterial drug resistance because the bacterial membrane is difficult to change through only a few genetic mutations [32]."

This reduction in the hemolytic activity for the nanoparticles can be due to the interactions found between the hydrophobic residues of the zein and the hydrophobic regions of the surfactant, which would make the surfactant\nore internalized or immobilized. This internalization would induce the reduction of both the antimicrobial properties and the hemolytic activity [34]. This behavior can be also related to the morphology and size of the aggregates formed by every compound. Aqueous solutions of pure LAM, C3(LA)2 and C6(LA)2 contain spherical micelles, then when these compounds are incorporated in the zein nanoparticle the size of the aggregates increases a l t and the hemolysis diminishes substantially. C9(LA)2 forms viscous solutions with big aggregates such us worm-like micelles [35]. In this case, when this compound was incorporated into the zein nanoparticles the increase of the aggregate\u2019s size was not so marked and the same happened with the hemolytic activity. Our results suggest that the aggregate size and morphology play an important role in the hemolytic character of these formulations. It has been reported that these physicochemical properties also affect significantly the hemolysis of aggregates formed by these Gemini surfactants with cholesterol and dilauroyl phosphatidyl choline (DLPC) [15]. It is noteworthy that the reduction in the hemolytic activity is considerably higher than that observed for the antimicrobial activity. The formation of complexes C6(LA)2 and C9(LA)2\u2013zein could explain the reduction in their hemolytic activity when nanoencapsulated in the zein nanoparticles. As the aliphatic moieties were complexed to the protein, the cationic moieties (arginine groups) were still found available to interact biologically with the bacteria and the fungi, maintaining their biocide activity equal to their solution. Nonetheless, the shorter space chain found in C3(LA)2 made it more hydrophilic, and similarly to LAM, it was not found to cause membrane disruption in the erythrocytes. According to the docking results, the formation of the zein nanoparticles containing the surfactants is likely to be manifested by interactions in which different groups in the molecular structure of the surfactants are involved. The two polar heads and hydrophobic parts are unlikely involved in the modes of interaction. In three or two active sites, we have\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2568 24 of 31\neventually seen that one of the polar heads or one of the alkyl chains participates in the interaction mode which indicates that even if the surfactant molecules are engaged in the nanoparticles\u00b4 formation, they keep their hydrophobic and electrophilic characteristics. This aspect justifies the antimicrobial power which remains active for the nanoparticles containing the surfactant molecules compared to their free forms. Notice that biomedical applications of antimicrobial formulations will be important only if they are lethal to bacteria or fungi at concentrations that are not toxic toward mammalian cells. Then it could be assessed that the preparation of these Gemini surfactantsbased nanoparticles increases the safety of these antimicrobials and then widens the range of their potential biomedical applications."

The measurements were performed at 25 \u00b0C after 0, 7, 30, 90 and 365 days in triplicate for each sample. The morphology of the nanoparticles was observed with Transmission Electronic Microscopy (JEOL JEM-2010, Electron Microscope, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). For that, a drop of each dispersion was deposited on a copper grid covered by an amorphous carbon film, dried and submitted for observation.\n3.4.

The spectrometer control software was TopSpin 4.0. The chemical shifts reported are referenced to the lock deuterium solvent. Spectra were processed and analyzed with Mestrenova software v14.0 (Mestrelab Inc., Santiago de Compostela, Spain).\nIn order to investigate the chemical interactions between the surfactants and zein, the single compounds LAM, C3(LA)2, C6(LA)2 and C9(LA)2 and their binary mixtures with zein were dissolved and homogenized in 0.6 mL of CD3OD:D2O 9:1 (v/v). The concentration of zein was fixed at 8 mM, while the mixtures were prepared at a molar ratio surfactant: zein of 50:1. NMR spectra were measured following our previous studies [18,29].

Frozen stocks of microorganisms were seeded in culture media plates (M\u00fcller Hinton agar, MHA, for bacteria and Sabouraud, SBA, for yeasts) and incubated overnight at 35 \u25e6C and 30 \u25e6C, respectively. Three to four colonies of each strain were dispersed in the appropriate sterile broth (MHB for bacteria and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium RPMI 1640 for yeasts) to obtain dispersions equivalent to 0.5 in the McFarland turbidity scale (McFarland DEN-1B Grant-bio model densimeter, Shepreth, Cambs, UK). To obtain the bacteria inoculum, the suspensions were diluted to 10 in MHB to reach 107 colony forming units (CFU)/mL. The yeast inoculums were used without dilution (~1.5 \u00d7 107 CFU/mL).\n3.7.2. Minimum Inhibitory and Minimum Bactericide/Fungicide Concentrations\nThe minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and minimal fungicide concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution method according to the CLSI protocol [44]. Each well of a 96-well plate contained 150 \u00b5L of sterile broth (MH for bacteria and RPMI 1640 for yeasts). The nanoparticles were serially diluted resulting from 35.6 to 2.225 \u00b5g/mL. Surfactant solutions were also prepared in the same manner and used to compare the response to the nanoparticles. The negative control contained sterile broth. Finally, 10 \u00b5L of each inoculum was added to the corresponding wells, resulting in a final concentration of 106 UFC/mL. The plates containing bacteria and yeasts were incubated at 30 \u25e6C and 37 \u25e6C for 24 h, respectively. After the incubation period, the turbidity of wells was checked. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration without apparent turbidity. To confirm this observation, 20 \u00b5L of resazurin at 0.015% w/v was added to each well and left to react for approximately 1 h for bacteria and 3 h for yeasts at 35\u25e6 and 30 \u25e6C, respectively. After the incubation period, the indicative of bacterial growth, i.e., changing from blue to pink, confirmed the MIC value observed.

The blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The supernatant containing the white cells was discarded, while the erythrocytes were suspended in fresh PBS (phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4). The suspension was centrifuged three times at 3000 rpm for 10 min, in order to eliminate the lysed cells and possible residues, assuring that the analyzed solutions would contain only hemoglobin from the erythrocytes\u2019 residues. After the last washing, a volume of PBS 7.4 equivalent to twice the initial volume was added to dilute the erythrocytes to 8 \u00d7 109 cells/mL. To check the quality of the blood 975 \u00b5L of ultrapure water and 25 \u00b5L of the erythrocytes\u00b4 suspension were mixed and gently homogenized for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at \u03bb = 575 nm (Spectrophotometer Shimatzu UV240, Shimatzu\u00ae, Kyoto, Japan), using PBS 7.4 as the blank. Before the test, the basal hemolytic activity (0%) was checked using PBS 7.4 as control, while the 100% hemolysis was determined using ultrapure water. The last was used to determine comparatively the individual hemolytic activity (in %). After that, blank and surfactant-loaded zein nanoparticles and their solutions were assayed using the adjusted erythrocytes suspension.

            "text": "Zein nanoparticles containing arginine-based surfactants have been prepared using two different methods. Both preparation methods are viable for loading the surfactants into zein nanoparticles The antimicrobial properties and the hemolytic activity of these cationic nanoparticles have been studied. Zein is a protein which offers a great versatility for nanoparticle formation, which allows the obtaining of nanoparticles with different characteristics. The NMR results indicate that when using H2O as a co-solvent, there is a binding between the surfactants and the zein mediated by a layer of water molecules that have relative long residence times attached to the hydrophilic surface of the protein (bound water fraction). Qualitatively, the poor transference of saturation from the protein to the surfactants in the STDoff\u2013on spectra could reflect either a relative strong binding or a relevant fraction of bound water molecules in the zein binding site. The stability is affected by the type of surfactant loaded, being more notable in Gemini surfactants with longer spacer chains such as C6(LA)2 and C9(LA)2. LAM enhanced its antimicrobial activity when nanoencapsulated, while the Gemini surfactants experienced a slightly reduced activity against the bacteria and fungi when loaded in the zein nanoparticles. The nanoencapsulation reduced extensively the hemolytic activity of all surfactants, while the highest reduction was observed in the Gemini surfactants, specially C6(LA)2. This improves their selectivity when considering the differentiation between microbial and human cell membranes. Therefore, these nanoparticles can become candidates for antimicrobial therapies as a potent activity together with a reduced toxicity which could be achieved after the nanoencapsulation in zein nanoparticles. Those results are in agreement with the NMR, Langmuir monolayers and docking findings, indicating that zein interacts with the surfactants by the aliphatic chain and as a result interferes in the surfactant\u2013lipid interaction necessary for the microbial and cellular interactions. As a result, the cationic charges are freely available to\nInt. J. Mol.
