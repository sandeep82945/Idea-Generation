MnBi4Te7 is a recently discovered antiferromagnetic topological insulator with TN ~12.5 K, which is constituted of alternatively stacked magnetic layer (MnBi2Te4) and non-magnetic layer (Bi2Te3). By means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we clearly observe the electronic state present at a step edge of a magnetic MnBi2Te4 layer but absent at non-magnetic Bi2Te3 layers at 4.5 K. Furthermore, we find that as the temperature rises above TN, the edge state vanishes, while the point defect induced state persists upon temperature increasing. These results confirm the observation of magnetism induced edge states. Our analysis based on an axion insulator theory reveals that the nontrivial topological nature of the observed edge state.",

MnBi4Te7 is a recently discovered antiferromagnetic topological insulator with TN ~12.5 K, which is constituted of alternatively stacked magnetic layer (MnBi2Te4) and non-magnetic layer (Bi2Te3). By means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we clearly observe the electronic state present at a step edge of a magnetic MnBi2Te4 layer but absent at non-magnetic Bi2Te3 layers at 4.5 K. Furthermore, we find that as the temperature rises above TN, the edge state vanishes, while the point defect induced state persists upon temperature increasing. These results confirm the observation of magnetism induced edge states. Our analysis based on an axion insulator theory reveals that the nontrivial topological nature of the observed edge state.\nKEYWORDS:\nAntiferromagnetism, Topological Insulator, Edge State, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Axion Insulator\nH.-K.

For example, in a two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin hall insulator, the strong spin-orbit coupling inverts the conventional band order between the conduction band and the valence band and opens a nontrivial band gap in bulk electronic structure, leading to a gapless state at the material\u2019s boundary 1-4. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) plays a key role in topological matter study5-8, especially has been employed to directly visualize the topological edge states. To-date, most of these measurements are performed in quantum spin hall states, for example, Bi, WTe2, ZrTe5 and others 9-17. Many theoretically predicted unique phenomena of the quantum spin hall edge state, such as the back-scattering forbidden effect, helical Tomonaga\u2013Luttinger liquid state, were also discovered using STM and STS 10, 12.\nThe axion insulator is an important class of topological nontrivial material, characterized by the effective Chern-Simons term with a quantized bulk magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Once the magnetism opens a gap at the boundary of the axion insulator, the Chern-Simons term ensures a non-trivial phase with half-quantized anomalous Hall effect 18. Unlike the study of 2D quantum spin Hall insulator, direct demonstration of such bulk-boundary correspondence in an axion insulator still remains elusive. Zero Hall conductance and resistance plateaus have been suggested as evidence to prove the axion insulator state in a magnetically\ndoped topological insulator heterostructure 19,20. However, debates have been raised that such transport measurements are not sufficient to distinguish the axion insulator phase from the trivial insulator phase 21-23, half-quantized anomalous hall effect, which supposed as a fingerprint of axion, is still unrevealed 24,25. Recently, MnBi2nTe3n+1 class of stoichiometry materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally proven as time-reversal symmetry breaking topological insulators 26-52. Various topological phases are predicted or measured in such material family, including the axion insulator state 27-31,53-58 . Detection of the bulk-boundary correspondence in this series of materials using STM/S is a valuable task.\nIn this work, we apply temperature-dependent STM/S to study the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers of MnBi4Te7 and clearly find the magnetism-induced electronic state on magnetic layer\u2019s edge. Our model analysis certifies the nontrivial Chern number of our observed topological edge state."

            "text": "MnBi4Te7 is a layered material. As shown in Fig. 1, Bi2Te3 and MnBi2Te4 layers are alternatively stacked along c axis. (MnBi2Te4 and Bi2Te3 layers are denoted as 124 and 023 respectively, in the following.) The sample is easily cleaved due to the weak Van Der Waals interaction between layers. After cleavage, both 124 and 023 terrace can be found in our experiment. The step heights of the 124 and 023 layers are 1.3 nm\nand 1.0 nm, respectively. The spin of the Mn atoms aligns ferromagnetically within each 124 layer, while antiferromagnetically between adjacent 124 layers. In other words, an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is formed. Indeed, transport measurements confirm the antiferromagnetism in our samples and demonstrate that the N\u00e9el temperature is around 12.5 K (Fig. S1). On the STM images (Figs. 1b and c), we reveal that both 124 and 023 surfaces are clean and atomically flat, but feature different types of point defects. For example, dark triangle shaped defects can be found on both 124 and 023 surfaces, but bright dotted shaped defects can only be seen on a 124 surface. According to a previous STM research 46, we attribute the former to the Te atom on the top surface being replaced by Bi, and the later to Mn-Bi anti-site.\nThe electronic characteristics on both surfaces are then evaluated using dI/dV spectra. Our spectral shapes on both surfaces are consistent with recent reports 45,46. In Fig. 1d, we observe a \u201cV\u201d shaped feature in the energy range of 0.2 eV to -0.4 eV, with the bottom of the V at -0.27 eV. To further explain our findings, we use first-principles calculations to simulate the surface band structure on 124 and 023 surfaces. We find that a single Dirac cone-shaped surface state with its Dirac node at -0.27 eV according to the minimum of the local density of state (LDOS), i.e. the bottom of the V. The valence band maximum and conduction band minimum in our sample are at -0.14 eV and -0.36 eV respectively, based on the comparison of our dI/dV spectra and band structure maps in Figs.1 and S2. On both 124 and 023 surfaces, pure topological surface states without mixture of bulk bands can be\nidentified within this energy range.\nStep edge is a boundary of a material and consequently an indicator of the bulk topology in a crystal. We first pay attention to a step with 1.3 nm height, indicating that the upper and lower terraces belong to a 124 and a 023 surface respectively. We measure the position-dependent dI/dV spectra, which traverses a 1.3 nm height step and is 20 nm long (Fig. 2). The LDOS at the step edge drastically differs from the one within the terrace, indicating the existence of an edge state. When the spectrum is moved away from the edge, such character vanishes. Moreover, the peak positions, i. e. -0.27 eV, corresponds to the energy level of the surface Dirac node. We suggest it is the topological edge state in MnBi4Te7. More evidences shall be offered in the following.\nAs a controlled experiment, we repeat the position-dependent dI/dV measurement on a 1.0 nm high step that separates an upper non-magnetic 023 terrace and a lower 124 terrace. Our results in Figs. 3 a and b reveal that the dI/dV spectra taken at the step edge have almost same shapes as the ones measured within terrace. In another word, we don\u2019t find evidences of edge states on a 023 layer.\nAll of the above experiments are carried out at 4.5 K, which is lower than our MnBi4T7 sample\u2019s N\u00e9el temperature of 12.5 K. We find that the electronic edge state is only present on the magnetic 124 terrace but not on the nonmagnetic terrace. To\nbetter understand the relationship between the edge state and magnetism, we now raise the system temperature to 77 K, driving the MnBi4T7 crystal into a nonmagnetic (paramagnetic) state. The LDOS obtained on and off step edge (Fig. 3 c and d) have nearly identical shapes (especially near the energy of surface Dirac node). Despite the fact that data quality at 77 K degrades due to the increased thermal fluctuation, our results still can conclude that the edge state on a 124 terrace vanishes at this temperature.\nMnBi4Te7 is a complex material, which possesses many defects. Previous works discovered that a specific sort of defect in MnBi4Te7 can also produce a Dirac resonance state 46,59. We successfully repeat the prior result in Fig. 4. However, we clearly discern that the Dirac resonance defect state, on the other hand, does not change at 77 K, which contrasts sharply with the temperature dependent evolution of the step edge state.\nWe note that during cleaving, the sample breaks at the step edge resulting in numerous defects. For example, we observe lots of bright dots on the step edge in Fig. 2b, which can be attributed to point defects. The defects may induce extra electronic states, such as additionally peaks in LDOS.\nIn order to clarify the influence of the defect states, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the edge states. We focus on a step of a 124 layer (Fig. 5), and\nintentionally take a number of dI/dV spectra at many positions along the step edge. In Fig. 5b, we observe that the dI/dV spectra take various shapes. Moreover, the LDOS peaks are not always located at -0.27 eV, which is the energy of the Dirac node measured on a defect free region. In principle, a topological edge state should appear at the Dirac energy. But in reality, some sort of defects may be able to change the local potential and thus shift the Dirac node energy away from the value -0.27 eV (by several tens of meV). We emphasize that all of our spectra have a peak close to (although not exactly at) -0.27 eV. More importantly, we raise up the temperature to 77 K, and record again a series of dI/dV spectra along a 124 magnetic layer edge (Fig. 5 c and d). In this situation, one can find no LDOS peak close to the Dirac node energy (around -0.27 eV). In contrast, certain peaks located between -0.1 eV to -0.2 eV remain, which can be attributed different types of defect states. Based on the fact that the LDOS peaks close to -0.27 eV appear everywhere on a 124 step edge at 4.5 K but disappear at 77 K, we believe that their origins are the topological edge state.\nWe summarize our experimental results, i. e. the dI/dV spectra and maps on distinct terminations of our MnBi4Te7 sample under varied measurement temperatures in Fig. 6 and conclude that edge state appears at the boundary of magnetic layer only below MnBi4Te7 \u2019s N\u00e9el temperature.\nTheoretically speaking, bulk-boundary correspondence is the key feature of various topological phases, and it takes on distinct forms in each one. There are two\nmechanisms that support a topological boundary mode in an axion insulator: (i) a hinge between the top surface and the side surface. Both surfaces of an axion insulator are gapped, resulting in a local Chern marker Ctop =\u00b1 1 2 and Cside =\u2213 1 2 . In this sense, the hinge carries a quantized anomalous Hall conductivity, i. e. \u03c3edge =\nCtop \u2212 Cside e2 h =\u00b1 e 2 h ; (ii) a surface magnetic domain wall, as shown in Figs. 6 and S3, that divides two different magnetic domains. When a domain wall is crossed, the spin orientation is flipped, leading to a chiral mode manifesting as the changes in the Chern marker, i. e. \u0394C = 1 2 \u2212 \u2212 1 2 = 1 in an axion insulator60. To depict this domain wall, an effective Hamiltonian H x, y =\u2212 iv \u2202y\u03c3x \u2212 \u2202x\u03c3y \u2212 sgn y Mz\u03c3z can be employed, leading to a cross-gap boundary state located at the domain wall. Our observed magnetism-induced step edge state is consistent with of the axion insulator state.\nWe note that two very recent works have reported the observation of edge states in thin film MnBi2Te4, with the thickness ranging from 1 to 6 layers 61,62. The underlying mechanism of these works can be attributed case (i). However, we believe that the origin of the observed edge states in our antiferromagnetic MnBi4Te7 is related to mechanism (ii) for two reasons. First, because of the T\u03c41/2 -symmetry, the center of the side surface in MnBi4Te7 possess a gapless Dirac cone. As a result, the gap closing process from the center of top surface to the center of the side surface is progressive, with no abrupt boundary 31. Second, the edge states can only be observed on a 124 terrace edge but not on 023 terrace. The 124 step edge is magnetic domain wall as\nwell as a geometrical step edge, whereas the 023 step edge is not. Furthermore, temperature dependent measurement validates the magnetic origin of the edge states. Taken these evidences together, we believe that the surface magnetic domain wall, which emerges naturally and inevitably at the magnetic layers edge, is a critical ingredient to our discovery."

The tunnelling differential conductance (dI/dV) signal was obtained by standard Lock-in technique, where 5 mV, 991 Hz were chosen as bias amplitude and oscillation frequency.\nTheoretical study\nDFT calculations were performed using the projector-augmented wave 63 pseudopotentials within the scheme of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 64 form of GGA approach, as implemented in the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) 65,66. PBE+U method 67with U(Mn) = 5 eV was used to consider the correlation effect of the Mn-d electrons. The Brillouin zone was sampled by a 6\u00d76\u00d73 \u0393-centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. The energy cutoff and total energy tolerance for the self-consistent calculations were 500 eV and 10-6 eV, respectively. The lattice constants (a0 = 4.355 \u00c5 and c0= 47.63 \u00c5) were fixed in all the calculations, and the atomic positions were fully relaxed until the force on each atom is less than 10-1\neV/\u00c5. Spin-orbit coupling was included in the calculations self-consistently. The spectral functions for various surface terminations were computed using iterative Green\u2019s function method as implemented in the Wannier Tools package 68. Tight-binding models within the Wannier representations by projecting the Bloch states onto Mn-d, Bi-p, and Te-s orbitals were constructed with the WANNIER90 code interfaced to VASP 69, 70."
