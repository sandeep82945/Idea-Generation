In this reaction, two hadrons are produced in opposite hemispheres along the z axis in the virtual photon-target nucleon centerof-mass frame, with the first hadron produced in the current-fragmentation region and the second in the target-fragmentation region. The data were taken with longitudinally polarized electron beams of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV incident on an unpolarized liquid-hydrogen target using the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. Observed nonzero sin\u0394\u03d5 modulations in ep \u2192 e0p\u03c0\u00feX events, where \u0394\u03d5 is the difference of the azimuthal angles of the proton and pion in the virtual photon and target nucleon center-of-mass frame, indicate that correlations between the spin and transverse momenta of hadrons produced in the target- and current-fragmentation regions may be significant. The measured beam-spin asymmetries provide a first access in dihadron production to a previously unexplored leading-twist spin- and transverse-momentumdependent fracture function. The fracture functions describe the hadronization of the target remnant after the hard scattering of a virtual photon off a quark in the target particle and provide a new avenue for studying nucleonic structure and hadronization.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.022501\nIntroduction.\u2014In deep inelastic scattering (DIS) a lepton scatters off a nucleon with sufficient energy and momentum transfer that the process is well described by incoherent scattering from individual partons (quarks or gluons). In semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), one or more hadrons are detected in coincidence with the scattered lepton, providing information on the initial quark flavor, transverse momentum, and spin [1]. The majority of SIDIS studies have focused on the analysis of hadron production in the current-fragmentation region (CFR), where the final-\nstate hadrons are produced from the struck quark. In QCD, the production of hadrons in the CFR can be described in a factorized framework by the convolution of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) [2]. Here, the PDFs describe the probability of finding a specific quark or gluon in a particular state inside the nucleon [3,4] and the FFs describe the formation of hadrons out of quarks and gluons [5]. However, hadrons produced in the target-fragmentation region (TFR), formed under the participation of the spectator partons, are not described by this picture and have been largely unexplored until now. This Letter describes the first ever SIDIS detection of a hadron in the CFR in coincidence with a hadron in the TFR. The corresponding theoretical basis to study the TFR is based on the fracture function formalism and was established in Ref. [6] for the collinear case.

Funded by SCOAP3.\n022501-2\nbeen generalized to the spin- and transverse-momentumdependent case [7]. The fracture functions describe the conditional probability for the target remnant to form a specific final state hadron after the ejection of a particular quark. In leptoproduction, the polarization state of the virtual photon depends on the longitudinal polarization of the lepton beam, which in turn selects preferentially one polarization state of the struck quark. The opposite polarization and transverse momentum of the remnant can introduce correlations between final-state hadrons produced in the TFR and hadrons produced in the CFR. The study of dihadron production in SIDIS with a longitudinally polarized lepton, where one hadron is produced in the CFR and another in the TFR, provides access to leading twist fracture functions [8]. In the valence-quark region, the polarization transfer from the beam to the active quark is expected to be significant at the relatively low center-ofmass energies accessible at CLAS12 [9]. Preliminary studies using CLAS data indicated that these target-current correlations may be significant [10]. The high luminosity and high polarization of the electron beam along with a wide acceptance for the detection of many final-state particles makes CLAS12 an ideal place for studies of correlations between the target- and current-fragmentation regions. Sizable beam spin-dependent asymmetries (SSAs) for a longitudinally polarized lepton beam on nucleon targets and one or two hadrons detected in the CFR have been observed at JLab [11\u201314], HERMES [15], and COMPASS [16\u201318]. These results have been interpreted in terms of higher twist contributions, related to quark-gluon correlations. Here, higher twist refers to quantities that are suppressed by the hard scale of the process [19]. When one of two hadrons is detected in the TFR and the other in the CFR, the beam SSAs reported in this Letter appear at leading twist [20] without this suppression. The process considered here is shown in Fig. 1. We use the standard DIS variables: the momentum of the exchanged virtual photon q \u00bc l \u2212 l0, the scale of the process Q2 \u00bc \u2212q2, the fractional longitudinal target momentum carried by the struck quark x \u00bc Q2=2P \u00b7 q, the fractional energy loss of the scattered electron y \u00bc P \u00b7 q=P \u00b7 l, and the hadronic mass of the system W2 \u00bc \u00f0P\u00fe q\u00de2. For the case of a longitudinally polarized beam and unpolarized target after the integration over \u03d52 (the azimuthal angle of the TFR hadron) and keeping\u0394\u03d5 \u00bc \u03d52 \u2212 \u03d51 fixed, there are two contributions to the cross section, \u03c3UU and \u03c3LU [20],\n\u03c3UU \u00bc C\u00bdu\u03021D1 ; \u00f01\u00de\n\u03c3LU \u00bc PT1PT2 mNm2 C\u00bdw5l\u0302\u22a5h1 D1 sin\u0394\u03d5; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere C denotes the transverse momentum convolution of the leading twist fracture functions u\u03021 and l\u0302 \u22a5h 1 with the unpolarized fragmentation function D1 is defined as\nC\u00bdf\u00f0k\u20d7\u22a5; k\u20d70\u22a5;\u2026\u00de \u00bc X\na\ne2ax Z d2k\u20d7\u22a5 Z d2k\u20d70\u22a5\n\u00d7 \u03b42\u00f0k\u20d7\u22a5 \u2212 k\u20d70\u22a5 \u2212 P\u20d7T1=z1\u00def\u00f0k\u20d7\u22a5; k\u20d70\u22a5;\u2026\u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere ea is the quark charge, k\u22a5 is the transverse momentum of the initial quark with respect to the virtual photon, k0\u22a5 is the transverse momentum after the interaction and the summation runs over the quark flavors, and weight factor w5 is given by [8]\nw5 \u00bc \u00f0k\u20d7\u22a5 \u00b7 P\u20d7T2\u00de\u00f0P\u20d7T1 \u00b7 P\u20d7T2\u00de \u2212 \u00f0k\u20d7\u22a5 \u00b7 P\u20d7T1\u00deP\u20d72T2\n\u00f0P\u20d7T1 \u00b7 P\u20d7T2\u00de2 \u2212 P\u20d72T1P\u20d72T2 : \u00f04\u00de\nNote that \u03c3UU and \u03c3LU depend on the kinematic variables x;Q2; z1; \u03b62; P2T1; P 2 T2, and P\u20d7T1 \u00b7 P\u20d7T2. The masses of the nucleon target, forward and backward produced hadrons are denoted asmN ,m1, andm2. The hadron 1, h1, produced in the CFR is characterized by the standard scaling variable z1 \u00bc P \u00b7 P1=P \u00b7 q, describing the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried by the CFR hadron, and its transverse momentum P\u20d7T1 (defined relative to the q vector in the target rest frame) with magnitude PT1 and azimuthal angle \u03d51. The hadron 2, h2, produced in the TFR is described by similar variables: the fractional longitudinal target momentum carried by the TFR hadron, \u03b62 \u2243 E2=E where E is the energy of the target, and P\u20d7T2 (PT2 and \u03d52) in the virtual photon and target nucleon center-of-mass frame. The usual\n022501-3\nhadronic scaling variable z is not used in the TFR because of ambiguities between soft hadron emission and target fragmentation [7]. In particular, the structure function in Eq. (2) contains the fracture function l\u0302\u22a5h1 \u00f0\u03b62; PT2\u00de, describing the production of h2 after the emission of a longitudinally polarized quark in an unpolarized nucleon and D1\u00f0z1; PT1\u00de, the unpolarized fragmentation function describing the formation of h1. This structure function depends on the relative azimuthal angle of the two hadrons, indicating a long-range correlation between hadrons produced in the CFR and the TFR. The resulting beam-spin asymmetry, which is a ratio of structure functions, contains the convolution of the fracture function and the fragmentation function modulated by sin\u0394\u03d5,\nALU \u00bc \u2212 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u2212 \u03f52 p jP\u20d7T1jjP\u20d7T2j mNm2 C\u00bdw5 l\u0302\u22a5h1 D1 C\u00bdu\u03021D1 sin\u0394\u03d5: \u00f05\u00de\nThe depolarization factor in the front of Eq.

Experiment.\u2014The data, corresponding to SIDIS events with a \u03c0\u00fe in the CFR and proton in the TFR, were taken in two run periods in the fall of 2018 and spring 2019 using, respectively, 10.6 and 10.2 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beams delivered by the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab [21]. The electron beam was incident on a liquid-hydrogen target and reactions were recorded using the CLAS12 spectrometer [9]. The beam polarization was flipped at a rate of 30 Hz to minimize systematic effects and its average modulus was 85.7 1.6. A tracking subsystem consisting of drift chambers in a toroidal magnetic field was used to reconstruct particles scattered in the forward direction. A high-threshold Cherenkov counter was used to distinguish between electrons and final-state hadrons. Additional identification criteria for the electrons was also imposed using a series of electromagnetic calorimeters. The CLAS12 forward time-of-flight systems, composed of six arrays of plastic scintillation counters, were used to analyze the velocity vs momentum relationship of positive tracks to distinguish between hadron species. The pions\u2019 momenta were limited to 1.2 < p < 4.0 GeV in order to avoid regions of low efficiency (lower limit) and minimize misidentification of kaons (upper limit). Protons were required to have a momentum greater than 0.5 GeV (no upper limit was enforced since the distribution of protons\u2019 upper momenta dies down around 2.5 GeV, before any significant contamination from lighter hadron species). The reconstructed\nelectron and hadrons were required to have been identified in the so-called \u201cforward detector\u201d of CLAS12 and a requirement has been placed on the polar angle of each track, \u03b8 < 30\u00b0. SIDIS events were selected with the usual requirement that Q2 > 1 GeV2 and the mass of the hadronic final-state, W > 2 GeV. Events with a radiated photon were limited by requiring y < 0.75. At energies accessible by fixed target experiments there is no rapidity gap which makes defining CFR and TFR origins difficult. The forward and backward regions were defined by the variable xF, in the virtual photon-nucleon center-of-mass frame, with the requirement that xF1 > 0 and xF2 < 0, respectively. The Feynman-x variable is defined as xF1\u00f02\u00de \u00bc 2Pk1\u00f02\u00de=W, where Pk is the longitudinal momentum of the hadron. The xF variable takes a positive value if the hadron moves in the same direction along the z axis as the momentum transfer dictated by virtual photon and a negative value if it moves in the same direction of the target remnant in the center-of-mass frame. An additional requirement on the boost-invariant quantity \u0394Y \u2261 Y1 \u2212 Y2 > 0, where Y is the rapidity evaluated in the Breit frame defined as 2Y1\u00f02\u00de \u00bc ln\u00f0E1\u00f02\u00de \u00fe Pk1\u00f02\u00de\u00de=\u00f0E1\u00f02\u00de \u2212 Pk1\u00f02\u00de\u00de, was required to enforce separation between the hadrons. The asymmetries were studied as a function of both of these variables to investigate the transition from one region to another. A requirement of z1 > 0.2 was enforced in order to limit pions coming from target fragmentation. Contributions from \u0394\u00fe\u00fe decays (regardless of kinematic origin) were minimized by requiring the invariant mass of the observed hadrons to have Mp\u03c0 > 1.5 GeV. Finally, the missing mass of the process ep \u2192 e0p\u03c0\u00feX was restricted to be greater than 0.95 GeV in order to avoid contributions from diffractive meson production (missing \u03c0\u2212 or \u03c1\u2212). Results.\u2014The beam-spin asymmetry can be accessed using the yields N of events with a proton in the backward region and a positive pion in the forward region, produced from the scattering of an electron with helicity , written\nALU\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de \u00bc 1\nPbeam\nN\u00fe\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de \u2212 N\u2212\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de N\u00fe\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de \u00fe N\u2212\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de\n\u2243Asin \u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00deLU sin\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de \u00feAsin \u00f02\u0394\u03d5\u00deLU sin\u00f02\u0394\u03d5\u00de; \u00f07\u00de\nwith the dependence on sin\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de and sin\u00f02\u0394\u03d5\u00de described in Ref. [20], and fitting for the resulting azimuthal modulation amplitudes. The asymmetry has been corrected for the beam polarization on an event-by-event basis in the likelihood function. The amplitudes in Eq. (7) were extracted from the data using an unbinned maximum likelihood fit that includes both modulations of ALU. A binned \u03c72minimization fit with nine bins in \u0394\u03d5 was also performed and is in very good agreement with the unbinned fit with a mean reduced \u03c72 of 1.01. The count-rate asymmetry between positive and negative electron helicities as a\n022501-4\nfunction of \u0394\u03d5 is shown in Fig. 2. A \u03c72-minimization fit to the asymmetry is shown as a dashed red line and exhibits a clear sin\u00f0\u0394\u03d5\u00de behavior with a much smaller sin\u00f02\u0394\u03d5\u00de contribution and a reduced \u03c72 \u00bc 0.92. The dependence of Asin\u0394\u03d5LU on the product of transverse momenta of the proton and pion is shown in Fig. 3 and is consistent with a linear increase in magnitude and approaches zero as the transverse momentum goes to zero, following the kinematic dependence predicted by theory [see. Eq. (5)]. Additional multidimensional asymmetries as a function of the product of the transverse momenta in bins of z1 are given in Supplemental Material [22]. Because of the correlation between different kinematic variables and the product of the transverse momenta of both hadrons, the asymmetries can be weighted by dividing out the depolarization and kinematic weighting factor in Eq.

The dependence\nof the resulting ratio, which should directly depend on the ratio of the convolutions of fracture and fragmentation functions, was studied for several different kinematic variables. The x dependence, shown in Fig. 4, has the general trend of increasing in magnitude as x increases. This strong dependence implies that the correlation of final-state hadrons is most significant in the valence quark region. The dependence on z1 of the pion, which reflects the fragmentation function dependence, is shown in Fig. 5. At relatively small z1, contributions from the initial quark transverse momentum can be neglected and the main contribution to the produced hadron transverse momentum comes from the struck quark hadronization process. This relatively weak dependence may also be a consequence of cancellation between the pion fragmentation functions in the numerator and denominator. The dependence on \u03b62, shown in Fig. 6, is stronger and may be interpreted in terms of strong correlations with other variables such as x; typically the higher longitudinal momentum carried by\n022501-5\nthe initial quark, the lower the longitudinal momentum available for the TFR hadron. Additional kinematic dependences are included in Supplemental Material [22]. The asymmetries plotted versus xF2 and \u0394Y (with the kinematic constraints on xF2, xF1, and \u0394Y removed) show a relatively flat dependence in the xF1 < 0 region with a possible transition in the positive region where the proton is increasingly likely to have originated in the CFR and the back-to-back fracture function formalism no longer holds. Finally, the dependence on the missing mass, with the Mx > 0.95 GeV requirement removed, shows a relatively flat behavior above the contributions from diffractive ep \u2192 e0p\u03c0\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 and ep \u2192 e0p\u03c0\u00fe\u03c1\u2212 events. Relevant systematic uncertainties have been estimated using a number of methods. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the PEPSI generator [26] and a GEANT4-based simulation [23,28] of the detector for acceptance, efficiency and particle-ID studies. Good agreement for all underlying variables was observed. Systematic uncertainties due to bin migration and the scale uncertainty on the beam polarization can reach a few percent in each bin. Other effects due to particle misidentification, accidental coincidences, photoproduction of electrons and contamination from target-fragmentation pions (baryonic decays like \u0394\u00fe\u00fe \u2192 p\u03c0\u00fe) have all been estimated to be small. Contributions from radiative effects are avoided by limiting our kinematic range and are estimated to be small. However, more theory effort will be needed in the future for detailed studies of radiative corrections in SIDIS in general, and back-to-back dihadron production in particular. The largest systematic uncertainty comes from contributions from the unpolarized cross section. After integration over \u03d52, the only remaining structure functions are \u03c3UU and \u03c3LU in Eqs. (1) and (2). However, due to the nonperfect acceptance of CLAS12 and the potential resulting nonorthogonality of modulations, the other unpolarized\nstructure functions may impact our extraction of the FLU amplitudes. Since there are no experimental data on the spin-independent (UU) modulations, the uncertainty due to not including these modulations in our fit has been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations by injecting various values of the amplitudes and then performing fits not including the UU modulations in order to measure the possible deviation in our LU amplitudes. The effect is heavily bin dependent, but can only reach magnitudes similar to the statistical uncertainty at edges of kinematic space. For example, in the lowest x bin we assign an uncertainty to Asin\u0394\u03d5LU of 0.006 compared to 0.021 at the highest x bin where the measurement is less constrained. This Letter is both dependent on our injected amplitudes and fairly conservative and so, therefore, may correspond to an overestimate. Conclusions.\u2014In summary, the kinematic dependences of beam SSAs in the production of two hadrons in opposite hemispheres have been measured for the first time. The asymmetries may be interpreted in a framework described by transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization into fracture functions and fragmentation functions, with the conditional probability of finding a proton originating from the target remnant after the emission of a quark which undergoes hadronization to form a final-state \u03c0\u00fe. The PT dependence of the asymmetries is consistent with predictions of the factorized framework and can ultimately be used to test TMD factorization once extractions of the relevant functions are available and predictions have been made. Our measurement of correlations between the target- and current-fragmentation regions develops a new methodology to quantify the relationship between the spin and transverse momenta of quarks in the nucleon and provides a new avenue for studies of the complex nucleonic structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. The kinematics of the generated asymmetries are not in the perturbative regime, but instead, the asymmetries likely originate due to entanglement of the longitudinally polarized struck quark and the target remnant [7]. Future work will extend the analysis to other hadron species in both the TFR and CFR in order to test the universal nature of fracture functions. The flavor dependence of fracture functions can be extracted by comparing with deuterium targets, of which comparable statistics to the proton-target data shown here have already been collected by CLAS12. Finally, polarized-target measurements will enable access to the complete set of leadingtwist fracture functions.\nWe acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the staff of the Accelerator and the Physics Divisions at Jefferson Lab in making this experiment possible.
