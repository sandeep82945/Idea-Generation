 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following ACSCR patients over time to see if TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX levels normalize after recovery. This could help determine if these molecules are biomarkers or directly involved in pathogenesis. 

2. Explore whether modulating gut microbiota with probiotics or diet to lower TMAO levels can prevent or improve ACSCR. This could elucidate the role of TMAO and lead to new treatment approaches.

3. Investigate if administering SPX supplements can reduce macular thickness and improve visual acuity in ACSCR patients. This could validate SPX as a novel therapy. 

4. Examine if drugs that block ALA signaling pathways like vasoconstriction can reduce edema and hypertension in ACSCR. This could uncover new drug targets.

5. Analyze PNX levels in animal models of stress and inflammation to better understand its compensatory and protective mechanisms. This could provide insight into developing PNX-based treatments.
