Exploration of CAPP Technology in Different Matrices: Building on the observed variation in antibiotic degradation efficiency due to the matrix's composition (e.g., surface water vs. milk), future studies could explore the application of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) technology across a broader range of environmental and food matrices. This could include testing in soil, different types of water bodies (e.g., groundwater, industrial effluents), and a variety of food products (e.g., fruits, vegetables) to understand the generalizability and limitations of CAPP technology in degrading antibiotic residues.

Long-term Ecological and Health Impacts of CAPP-treated Water/Food: Although the study showed no immediate toxicity or resistance development from CAPP-treated samples, there's a need to investigate the long-term ecological and health impacts of consuming CAPP-treated water or food products. This could involve chronic exposure studies in animal models to assess potential long-term effects on health and whether any subtle impacts on microbial communities might emerge over time.

Mechanistic Studies on By-Product Formation and Degradation Pathways: The study identified specific by-products from the degradation of β-lactam antibiotics via CAPP but suggested further work is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action. Future research could focus on a detailed mechanistic study of how different antibiotics degrade under CAPP treatment, including identifying intermediate compounds and understanding how the treatment alters antibiotic molecular structures. This would also involve assessing the safety and environmental impact of these by-products.

Optimization and Scale-up of CAPP Technology for Industrial Applications: While the study optimized certain parameters (e.g., plasma jet voltage, gas composition) for β-lactam degradation, comprehensive research on scaling up this technology for industrial applications is required. This includes engineering challenges related to integrating CAPP systems into existing wastewater treatment facilities, optimizing energy consumption, and ensuring consistent degradation efficiencies at larger scales.

Development of Predictive Models for CAPP Treatment Efficiency: The study highlighted the impact of various factors (e.g., pH, residue concentration, presence of polar macromolecules) on the efficiency of antibiotic degradation. Future research could focus on developing predictive models that incorporate these variables to forecast treatment outcomes. Such models would be invaluable for tailoring CAPP treatments to specific environmental conditions or types of waste, thereby enhancing the technology's applicability and efficiency.
