1. **Investigate the effect of deamidation on the emulsifying properties of pea proteins.** This could be done by measuring the ability of deamidated pea proteins to form and stabilize emulsions with different types of oils.
2. **Study the impact of deamidation on the foaming properties of pea proteins.** This could be done by measuring the ability of deamidated pea proteins to form and stabilize foams with different types of gases.
3. **Explore the use of deamidated pea proteins in food applications.** This could involve developing new food products that incorporate deamidated pea proteins and evaluating their sensory and nutritional properties.
4. **Investigate the effect of deamidation on the allergenicity of pea proteins.** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the allergenic potential of deamidated pea proteins.
5. **Study the long-term stability of deamidated pea proteins.** This could involve storing deamidated pea proteins under different conditions and monitoring their functional properties over time.
