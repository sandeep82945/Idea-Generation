OBJECTIVE To investigate whether individuals newly diagnosed with a BHC who used OPBHT incurred lower medical and pharmacy costs over 15 and 27 months of follow-up compared with those not using OPBHT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study of commercially insured individuals in the US was conducted using administrative insurance claims data for individuals newly diagnosed with 1 or more BHCs between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. Data were examined using a 12-month period before BHC diagnosis and 15and 27-month follow-up periods. Participants included individuals aged 1 to 64 years who received any OPBHT with or without behavioral medication or who did not receive OPBHT or behavioral medication in the 15 months following diagnosis. Data were analyzed from May to October 2021. EXPOSURES Receipt of OPBHT both as a dichotomous variable and categorized by number of OPBHT visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was the association between OPBHT treatment and 15and 27-month medical and pharmacy costs, assessed using a generalized linear regression model with \u03b3 distribution, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS The study population included 203 401 individuals, of whom most were male (52%), White, non-Hispanic (75%), and 18 to 64 years of age (67%); 22% had at least 1 chronic medical condition in addition to a BHC. Having 1 or more OPBHT visits was associated with lower adjusted mean per-member, per-month medical and pharmacy costs across follow-up over 15 months (no OPBHT: $686 [95% CI, $619-$760]; 1 OPBHT: $571 [95% CI, $515-$632]; P < .001) and 27 months (no OPBHT: $464 [95% CI, $393-$549]; 1 OPBHT: $391 [95% CI, $331-$462]; P < .001). Furthermore, almost all doses of OPBHT across the 15 months following diagnosis were associated with lower costs compared with no OPBHT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study, medical cost savings were associated with OPBHT among patients newly diagnosed with a BHC in a large, commercially insured population. The findings suggest that promoting and optimizing OPBHT may be associated with reduced overall medical spending among patients with BHCs.

In this study, we sought to examine whether individuals newly diagnosed with a BHC who use any outpatient behavioral health treatment (OPBHT) following diagnosis incur lower medical and pharmacy costs over the following 15or 27-month follow-up period compared with those not using OPBHT and to quantify the amount of OPBHT associated with optimized medical and pharmacy costs.",

            "text": "This retrospective cohort study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. The principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki14 and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act15 were followed during the study, which was deemed exempt from institutional review and informed consent by Evernorth Health because it was conducted with deidentified insurance claims data from Cigna. The study population included US individuals newly diagnosed (having no BHC claims in the 12 months prior) with 1 or more BHCs in the study period between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. The date of first BHC diagnosis was the index date, and preperiod costs were calculated for the 12 months prior to the index date. We measured OPBHT costs for 15 months after diagnosis to accurately capture the association of OPBHT with costs for a full year during which treatment occurred, as the first 3 months after a new BHC diagnosis can be a period during which OPBHT and medication use are more likely to fluctuate. In a subset of the population with extended coverage, we calculated costs across 27 months following the index date to assess persistence of effects after the first year during which treatment occurred.\nAn eligibility criterion for inclusion in the study was continuous medical, behavioral, and pharmacy eligibility for the 12-month preperiod and the 15-month postperiod (and, if available, 27 months). In the 12-month preperiod, individuals could not have preperiod BHC diagnoses, behavioral claims, or pharmacy spending. Eligible individuals were between 1 and 64 years of age (to exclude infants and older individuals eligible for Medicare) and had no pregnancies during the entire study period (to exclude high sex-specific costs unique to child-bearing individuals). Individuals in the treatment group must have had at least 1 OPBHT within the first 30 days of BHC diagnosis (irrespective of pharmacy spending for prescription behavioral medications). The rationale for requiring at least 1 visit within the first 30 days was to limit the temporal association between OPBHT and a new BHC diagnosis to the month immediately following the BHC diagnosis. In the no OPBHT control group, individuals could not have had any pharmacy spending for prescription behavioral medications or any OPBHT visits during the 15-month postperiod.\nThe primary aim of this study was to quantify the association of 1 or more OPBHTs with postperiod medical and pharmacy costs. The secondary aim was to assess whether different quantities of OPBHTs were associated with differences in postperiod costs. An OPBHT was defined by 116 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes,16 of which 95% of claims came from the predominant CPT codes associated with psychotherapy (90837, 90834, 90847, 99214, 99213, 90833, 90853, and 90836) or psychiatry (90791, 90792). The OPBHT claims came from licensed\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(12):e2244644. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.44644 (Reprinted) December 6, 2022 2/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/25/2024\nbehavioral clinicians, including counselors (35%), social workers (22%), psychologists (19%), psychiatrists (13%), and behavioral nurses (2%).\nWe controlled for confounding variables associated with exposure and outcome, including preperiod medical and pharmacy costs, age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, retrospective episode risk group (ERG) score (using Optum Insight\u2019s ERG method for underlying medical risk),17 chronic medical conditions, postperiod behavioral medication use (treatment group), BHCs (Table 1), any behavioral higher-level-of-care utilization in the 15-month postperiod, and behavioral insurance product type.

Race and ethnicity were determined from selfreported membership data or secondarily from commercially purchased information from a thirdparty vendor. Chronic medical diagnoses were assessed from preperiod International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes on claims data and included diagnoses for asthma, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, lower back pain, a recent oncology diagnosis, peripheral artery disease, or osteoarthritis.18 Behavioral health conditions were categorized as high acuity (F20.xx-F29.xx, F30.xx, F31.xx, F33.2x, F33.3x, F50.xx, and F84.xx), substance use and alcohol use disorder (F1x.xx, excluding F17.xx), depression or anxiety (F32.xx, F33.xx [excluding F33.2 \u00d7 and F33.3x], F34.xx, F39.xx-F42, F44, F45, and F48), or other (Fx.xx, excluding the previously listed categories). Behavioral medication use was depicted by any pharmacy spending for prescription behavioral medications vs no such spending. Higher-level-of-care utilization included any psychiatric inpatient, residential treatment, partial hospitalization, or intensive outpatient utilization. Behavioral insurance product type was a categorical variable and included 4 product types encompassing all participants in the current analysis. Missing categorical data were coded as missing, and individuals were included in the adjusted analysis with the exception of individuals (n = 216) missing continuous ERG data, who were excluded. Costs were calculated as the total of all medical and pharmacy claims for the period, capped at the 99th percentile. Behavioral health conditions were defined as any ICD-10 code starting with Fxx.xx within the first 10 diagnosis code fields on a claim with the exception of F17 (nicotine dependence only, without any other F codes). OPBHT visits across the 15-month postperiod were categorized both continuously and as a binary variable (0 or 1) or were evenly binned in 2-visit groups until 20 visits, after which they were binned by 10 visits until 40 to account for decreasing sample size with increasingly higher utilization."

The secondary analysis assessing the dose-response relationship between OPBHT volume and adjusted costs (Table 2) supported that all doses of OPBHT utilization were associated with lower costs: 15-month costs varied from $618 (95% CI, $557-$685) to $620 (95% CI, $557-$691) PMPM across the lowest number of visits (1-2) to the highest ( 41), respectively, compared with the no OPBHT group ($681; 95% CI, $615-$755) (all P < .001). Similarly, the 27-month costs were significantly lower for those receiving OPBHT for all visit categories except 41 or more visits, ranging from $424 (95% CI, $358-$501) to $397 (95% CI, $332- $474) PMPM across 1 to 2 and 31 to 40 visits, respectively, compared with the no OPBHT group ($466; 95% CI, $395-$551) (all P < .001). Including an age category by OPBHT interaction in the model (Figure 2) did not markedly change results at 15 months (primary and secondary analyses) or at 27 months (primary analysis). When examining OPBHT across all utilization levels and by age categories at 27 months (Figure 2D), results were not statistically significant at some OPBHT levels in all age groups or in an age-dependent manner; significantly lower costs were found at 10 treatment levels in adults receiving OPBHT (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 17-18, 19-20, 21-30, and 31-40 visits) but only at 5 levels in young adults (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 11-12, and 17-18 visits) and children (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 11-12, and 41 visits); however, this was likely influenced by the smaller sample size in the 27-month cohort, particularly among children and young adults, combined with increasing variance in costs across a longer follow-up period."

We found that any amount of OPBHT (vs none) was associated with reduced medical costs over the 15 and 27 months following the initial diagnosis. Moreover, our study found a dose-response relationship between OPBHT and medical and pharmacy costs, such that estimated cost savings were significantly lower in the treated vs untreated groups at almost every level of treatment. These findings support the cost-effectiveness of practitioner- and insurance-based interventions to increase OPBHT utilization, which is a critical resource as new BHC diagnoses continue to increase.\nFigure 1.

Our findings were also largely age independent, especially over 15 months, suggesting that OPBHT has favorable effects among children, young adults, and adults. This is promising given that disease etiology and progression, treatment paradigms, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and overall medical and pharmacy costs differ among the 3 groups.\nNotably, our data set largely encompassed in-person OPBHT since the study period preceded the systemic transition into virtual care that occurred in 2020, and consequently, we observed similar trends in utilization as in previous studies. OPBHT utilization in the overall study population was low, with older adults, adults with lower income, individuals with comorbid medical conditions, and racial and ethnic minority individuals being less likely to receive OPBHT.1,20 The promising advances in widespread access to virtual behavioral health care services and therapist-matching algorithms are reducing barriers to initiating and continuing care that underlie these established patterns.21,22 Consequently, data from 2020 and beyond can assess the effects of these advances on OPBHT adherence.\nFigure 2.

Previous studies have been specific to individual conditions within controlled research settings.10-12,23,24 Our findings suggest that promoting OPBHT as part of a population health strategy is associated with improved overall medical spending, particularly among adults. Future research should validate these findings in other populations, including government-insured individuals, and explore data by chronic disease category, over longer time horizons, by type and quality of OPBHT, by type of medical spending, within subpopulations with BHCs, and including virtual and digital behavioral health services.25,26"

            "text": "As in other studies of insurance claims data, this study has limitations. First, underdiagnosis of BHCs could mean that the study population was missing individuals in the control group. Second, the observational nature of this study using administrative claims data also means that we were unable to control for clinical data and individual behaviors to fully account for all characteristics that may differ between individuals seeking vs not seeking OPBHT. Third, our outcomes could also significantly vary by condition (behavioral or medical) and treatment type. As noted, further research should explore this variation explicitly as our results are applicable only to the study population, which focused on individuals newly diagnosed with a BHC. Fourth, the study population required continuous eligibility across commercial medical, pharmacy, and behavioral insurance, which may have introduced selection bias around health and employment status and excluded individuals older than 65 years. We also did not attempt to separate the independent and synergistic associations of medication use with our outcomes. Finally, we sought to examine the immediate impact of OPBHT utilization in the first 15 months following diagnosis, not continued use beyond the first 15 months."
