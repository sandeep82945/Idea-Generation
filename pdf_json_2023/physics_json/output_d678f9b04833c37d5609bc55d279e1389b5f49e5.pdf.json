    "abstractText": "In Bacillus fermentation processes, severe foam formation may occur in aerated bioreactor systems caused by surface-active lipopeptides. Although they represent interesting compounds for industrial biotechnology, their property of foaming excessively during aeration may pose challenges for bioproduction. One option to turn this obstacle into an advantage is to apply foam fractionation and thus realize in situ product removal as an initial downstream step. Here we present and evaluate a method for integrated foam fractionation. A special feature of this setup is the external foam column that operates separately in terms of, e.g., aeration rates from the bioreactor system and allows recycling of cells and media. This provides additional control points in contrast to an internal foam column or a foam trap. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, the foam column was exemplarily operated during an aerated batch process using the surfactinproducing Bacillus subtilis strain JABs24. It was also investigated how the presence of lipopeptides and bacterial cells affected functionality. As expected, the major foam formation resulted in fermentation difficulties during aerated processes, partially resulting in reactor overflow. However, an overall robust performance of the foam fractionation could be demonstrated. A maximum surfactin concentration of 7.7 g/L in the foamate and enrichments of up to 4 were achieved. It was further observed that high lipopeptide enrichments were associated with low sampling flow rates of the foamate. This relation could be influenced by changing the operating parameters of the foam column. With the methodology presented here, an enrichment of biosurfactants with simultaneous retention of the production cells was possible. Since both process aeration and foam fractionation can be individually controlled and designed, this method offers the prospect of being transferred beyond aerated batch processes.",

Although they represent interesting compounds for industrial biotechnology, their property of foaming excessively during aeration may pose challenges for bioproduction. One option to turn this obstacle into an advantage is to apply foam fractionation and thus realize in situ product removal as an initial downstream step. Here we present and evaluate a method for integrated foam fractionation. A special feature of this setup is the external foam column that operates separately in terms of, e.g., aeration rates from the bioreactor system and allows recycling of cells and media. This provides additional control points in contrast to an internal foam column or a foam trap. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, the foam column was exemplarily operated during an aerated batch process using the surfactinproducing Bacillus subtilis strain JABs24. It was also investigated how the presence of lipopeptides and bacterial cells affected functionality. As expected, the major foam formation resulted in fermentation difficulties during aerated processes, partially resulting in reactor overflow. However, an overall robust performance of the foam fractionation could be demonstrated. A maximum surfactin concentration of 7.7 g/L in the foamate and enrichments of up to 4 were achieved. It was further observed that high lipopeptide enrichments were associated with low sampling flow rates of the foamate. This relation could be influenced by changing the operating parameters of the foam column. With the methodology presented here, an enrichment of biosurfactants with simultaneous retention of the production cells was possible. Since both process aeration and foam fractionation can be individually controlled and designed, this method offers the prospect of being transferred beyond aerated batch processes.\nKEYWORDS\nin-situ product removal, foam fractionation, surfactin, Bacillus, aerated fermentation processes, downstream processing\n1 Introduction\nThe fermentation process of Bacillus spp. to produce cyclic lipopeptides faces many challenges. Amongst them is excessive foam formation, especially during aerated cultivation (Coutte et al., 2017; Geissler et al., 2019a).

The foaming ability, alongside surface active properties (Arima et al., 1968) makes surfactin an attractive agent for various industries, including their use as detergents or emulsifiers (Coutte et al., 2017; Geissler et al., 2019a). Thereby, the isolation of production strains from food resources is of particular interest in this context to enable the application of lipopeptides, e.g., in the food sector (Akintayo et al., 2022). However, during surfactin production processes with uncontrolled foaming, foam formed in the headspace of the bioreactor can enter the exhaust line (Figure 1A) and lead to clogging of the exhaust filters (Vardar-Sukan, 1998). This can be associated with increased pressure in the bioreactor system and a severe loss in bioreactor volume due to overflowing (Vardar-Sukan, 1998; Davis et al., 2001) (Figure 1B). Another problem is that cells can be enclosed in the foam and therefore might be transferred with the culture broth out of the bioreactor system. In that case, cells as well as media can no longer be used for production (Vardar-Sukan, 1998; Coutte et al., 2017; Oraby et al., 2022). Therefore, some research studies have been aimed at developing surfactin production processes in which strong foam formation is circumvented. Examples include the use of a bubbleless membrane bioreactor (Coutte et al., 2010) or foam-free anaerobic cultivation (Willenbacher et al., 2015a; Hoffmann et al., 2020), further novel process strategies are summarized by Geissler et al. (2019a). However, the highest reported surfactin concentration of 26.4 g/L in laboratory scale was still reached during an aerated highcell density fed-batch process by Klausmann et al. (2021). Intense foam destruction strategies had to be used in their process to cope with the strong foam formation, including mechanical and chemical methods. Additionally, to prevent a blockage of the filter system and collect overflowing culture broth, a foam trap (illustrated in Figure 1) can be connected downstream of the exhaust pipe as applied by Yeh et al. (2006) and Klausmann et al. (2021). The characteristic feature of the biosurfactant to accumulate at the gasliquid interface can also be used as an advantage for process design (Coutte et al., 2017; Stevenson, 2019). Using in situ product removal (ISPR), the foam can continuously be collected, and the foaming capabilities of surfactin can be exploited (Rangarajan and Clarke, 2016). As the lipopeptide is enriched in the foamate, a first purification step in the downstream chain can be realized by using ISPR in the bioreactor process (Winterburn and Martin, 2012; Rangarajan and Clarke, 2015; Oraby et al., 2022). This would be advantageous insofar as the downstream process is known to be a high cost factor (Mukherjee et al., 2006; Winterburn andMartin, 2012). A recent review by Oraby et al. (2022) summarized foam fractionation in aerated stirred tank reactors, including coverage of numerous fractionationmethods. They concluded that as of January 2021, foam fractionation was mainly applied for the production of biosurfactants, namely, in 74% of investigated cases. The vast majority of these studies use a method in which a foam trap is connected to the bioreactor systems. Thereby, the foam is collected via a pipe due to overflowing (Oraby et al., 2022). The earliest example of this method in surfactin production processes was conducted in Cooper et al. (1981). In comparison, a lower number of studies use a foam column, and external foam columns are used even less frequently (Oraby et al., 2022). In this study, an external foam column for integrated foam fractionation with a recirculation unit of the liquid is presented (Figures 2, 3), which can be categorized as \u201c4b\u201d according to the classification of Oraby et al. (2022). The number \u201c4\u201d refers to the method (integrated foam fractionation with an external column) and the letter \u201cb\u201d refers to the presence of a recirculation unit (Oraby et al., 2022). In the here applied method, the culture broth is sparged and brought to foaming in the foam column itself and is not collected via the headspace. In this way, the aeration of the foam column is not dependent on the aeration of the bioreactor system and is not used as a primary method for foam control, but rather as a tool for product enrichment. This is one of the highlights of the presented method, as it might potentially find application in foam-free and bubbleless fermentations. Since the culture broth is introduced into the foam column from below and then sparged, the system operates in the simple mode (Lemlich, 1968), and a pneumatic foam is created (Stevenson, 2019). A proof of principle is demonstrated using a standardized aerated batch process with the laboratory strain Bacillus subtilis JABs24. To test the influence of surfactin, cells and cell metabolites on the functionality of the foam column, two control experiments were performed. First, cell-free medium was examined with the addition of surfactin and then the non-surfactin producer B. subtilis 168 (sfp\u2212) was cultured as a negative control (Figure 2). In this way, the method can be evaluated and recommendations are made on the applicability of an external foam column with individual aeration using surfactin production in Bacillus as an example. Based on the faced challenges during the fermentation process, a need for smart control systems for future foam fractionation applications can be identified. Although external foam columns have generally been used for biosurfactant recovery (Blesken et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this type of fractionation has been evaluated for surfactin production processes."

Cells and media components that were transferred into the foam column but not enriched in the foam could flow downwards by gravity, and thus be recycled back to the bioreactor.

The parameters were chosen based on a previous experiment (data not shown). In addition, a foam trap was connected to the exhaust pipe to analyse the differences in enrichment between the two fractionationmethods. For sampling with the foam trap, the foam centrifuge was switched off, resulting in an overflow shortly thereafter. Sampling was then possible via a bypass from the exhaust pipe. All samples from the medium, foam trap and foam column were taken in a comparable time-frame and analysed for surfactin concentration by HPTLC. In the case of the foam column, the duration of sampling and the weight of the foamate were additionally determined in order to calculate a flow rate of the foam."

Based on these results, the following recommendations can be made for operating the foam column. In dependence on the estimated surfactin concentration achieved during cultivation, a liquid flow between 7.5\u201315 mL/min and a gas flow between 4.5\u20136 L/min provided good functionality of the foam column. In the next step, cell-free medium containing surfactin was used to compare the foam column with the foam trap, also analysing the influence of operating parameters. Thereby, the applied surfactin concentration was in range to that obtained in the performed cultivations with B. subtilis JABs24 (Table 3). The test was carried out starting with the lowest operating parameters. Samples were taken from the foam trap as well as the foam\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org05\ncolumn (Table 1). The sampling with the foam column could take up to 1 h. The foamate collected reached mfoamate = 2.8\u201313.7 g with the foam column and mfoamate = 8.2\u201315.8 g with the foam trap. Thereby the surfactin concentration in the foamate averaged csurfactin = 6.8 \u00b1 2.5 g/L for the foam column and csurfactin = 4.7 \u00b1 1.0 g/L for the foam trap. However, the absolute amount of surfactin was similar for both methods, averaging 0.05 g surfactin in the foamate. The average enrichment with the foam trap was 3.3 \u00b1 0.5 and 4.7 \u00b1 1.4 with the foam column. Furthermore, a gas flow of 4.5 L/min resulted in overall higher surfactin enrichment, with 6.5-fold enrichment for a liquid flow of 7.5 mL/min and 5.8-fold enrichment for a liquid flow of 10 mL/min. However, these parameters also resulted in the lowest flow rate with only 0.07 gfoam/min and 0.08 gfoam/ min. Vice versa, the highest flow rate of 0.23 gfoam/min, which was achieved with the operating parameters of 7.5 mL/min liquid flow and 6 L/min gas flow, resulted in the lowest enrichment of 2.6. The measured surfactin concentration in the medium decreased with increasing test duration. From an initial surfactin concentration of 1.6 \u00b1 0.0 g/L, only 75%, namely, 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 g/L, remained in the medium. With an initial bioreactor volume of 20 kg, this led to a decrease in absolute surfactin values from 32.4 \u00b1 0.2 g to 23.4 \u00b1 1.8 g. Thereby the surfactin lost through sampling can be neglected as the weight of the discharged foamate was less than 100 g, which corresponded to a deduction of approximately 0.5 g surfactin (Table 1)."

In this way, it could be analysed whether the functionality of the foam column was reliant on surfactin. Samples withdrawn from the bioreactor during cultivation were analysed for surfactin to control that the lipopeptide was not present. The HPTLC measurement confirmed that no surfactin was detectable with the method of choice and an application volume of 1 \u00b5L. During cultivation, foam formation was visible in the bioreactor system. When reaching stationary phase, the external foam column was operated using various parameters (Table 2). However, sampling was not possible with any of the tested parameters. In general, it was observed that although bubbles formed in the foam generator part of the foam column, the stability seemed not sufficient for the foam to rise in the drainage column. Most of the foam collapsed and caused the foam generator column to fill up with liquid. Also, the broth accumulated in the recirculation tube and was recycled to the bioreactor. Exemplary images of foam behavior in the column are presented in Figure 4. Here it can be seen that during cultivation with surfactin producer JABs24 small, almost evenly distributed bubbles were formed (Figure 4A). In comparison bubble size varied and was increased when cultivating non-surfactin producer 168 (Figure 4B). Additionally, the foam generator part filled up with liquid (Figure 4C). The last two observations were occasionally also found during cultivations with JABs24 in dependence of the chosen operation parameters and point of time during cultivation.TA B LE 1 O ve rv ie w of re su lt s ob ta in ed b y ap p ly in g th e fo am co lu m n to th e b io re ac to r fi lle d w it h M SM\nan d su rf ac ti n .T\no ca lc ul at e th e ab\nso lu te\nam ou\nn t of\nsu rf ac ti n m\nsu rf a ct in ,i t w as\nas su m ed\nth at\n1 g of\nfo am\neq ua\nls 1 m L of\nfo am .

Figure 5 shows exemplary time-courses of the bioreactor cultivations up to t = 60 h, also featuring the negative control using non-surfactin producer B. subtilis 168 up to t = 36 h.

In terms of cell growth and maximum optical densities, a similar trend was observed for all three fermentation processes. Differences mainly occurred in the duration of the lag phase and the overall cultivation time. In the reference process with strain JABs24, the highest OD600 value of 19.0 \u00b1 0.0 was registered after 51 h with a maximum growth rate of \u00b5max = 0.40 1/h (Table 3). For the proof of principle with an attached foam column, the highest OD600 value of 24 \u00b1 0.5 was reached after 57 h with maximum growth rate of \u00b5max = 0.45 1/h. In comparison, the non-surfactin producer B. subtilis 168 reached the maximumOD600 after 30 hwith 20.0 \u00b1 0.0 and a growth rate of 0.46 1/h. After glucose depletion, a reduction in biomass could be detected in all experimental approaches. However, in the foam column process a residue of 3.3 \u00b1 0.1 g/L glucose remained. In terms of the nitrogen source, residual concentrations of around 0.6 g/L were measured in the culture broth."

For example, a reduction from an initial 19.5 kg at tstart to 12.0 kg at tend was observed in replicate 2 of the foam column process (Supplementary Figure S4B). Thereby an interval-like decrease in reactor volume was seen with the biggest drop at t ~ 23 h. Within a timeframe of approximately 10 min, only 13.6 kg of an initial 18.3 kg remained in the bioreactor. This means that about a quarter of the reactor volume, namely, 4.8 kg (26.2%) was lost due to uncontrollable foaming in a short time interval. In severe cases, overfoaming potentially led to complete failure and premature termination of the experiment. In one of these fermentations 11.3 kg, responding to 55.9% of the initial volume were lost within only 20 min and in another case <3 kg of culture broth remained in the bioreactor, which also resulted in the probes no longer being covered properly (Supplementary Table S3). Whereas the processes employing the external foam column could not or only slightly be regulated using chemical antifoam agent, the application of such was possible in the reference process in addition to the foam centrifuge. Nonetheless an overfoaming was still observed for one of the reference processes,\nFIGURE 4 Exemplary images of foam behavior in the lower foam generator part of the foam column.

Within a timeframe of 2 h (between t ~ 22:35 h and t ~ 24:35 h) a reduction of the reactor volume from an initial 20.1 kg to a volume of 15.9 kg was observed. This resulted in a media loss of 4.3 kg (21.3%). In general, overfoaming was observed when agitation and sometimes also aeration were increased with stirrer speeds up to a maximum level of >800 rpm tomaintain the set pO2 level. It was also found that foam\nfrom the headspace could potentially be forced through the recirculation tube. Therefore, a non-return valve was installed in the course of experimental runs to improve this (see Supplementary Table S3 for detailed process information). Another challenge during the bioreactor processes was maintaining a continuous pO2 level, as the regulation occasionally failed to operate (see individual processes in the Supplementary Material for more detailed information on process performance). Among other factors, the addressed challenges during bioproduction made it difficult to achieve reproducibility of the process performance."

Replicate 1 reached its maximum of 7.4 \u00b1 0.2 g/L after 57 h with a specific growth rate of \u00b5overall = 0.11 1/h. Replicate 2 however reached the highest biomass already after 30 h with a CDWmax of 6.3 \u00b1 0.2 g/L and a slightly increased growth rate of \u00b5overall = 0.20 1/h (Table 3). Interestingly the biomass formation in the foam column process was increased in both cases compared to the reference processes. The highest overall biomass in the foamate was detected for replicate 2 with 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 g/L after 30 h (Table 3). The highest overall biomass enrichment of 2.4 was observed for the same replicate after 54 h (Table 3; Figure 7A). In general, the mean values of biomass enrichment ranged from 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 to 1.8 \u00b1 0.6 between replicates (Table 3). Despite observed variations in bacterial growth, the overall trend for surfactin production over time was comparable (Figure 6). Maximum product concentrations of 3.6 \u00b1 0.1 g/L and 3.0 \u00b1 0.0 g/L surfactin were reached during reference processes. When applying the foam column, surfactin concentrations in the culture broth were lower compared to the reference processes. Here surfactin levels of Pmax = 1.9 \u00b1 0.0 g/L and Pmax = 2.6 \u00b1 0.0 g/L were reached after 51 h and 48 h respectively (Table 3). Surfactin concentration in the foamate was increased and levels of 6.4 \u00b1 0.3 g/L and 7.7 \u00b1 0.4 g/L were determined towards the end of the cultivation at t = 51 h. Although variations in bacterial growth and hence inmaximum surfactin concentrations were observed between the replicates, a different picture emerged for surfactin enrichment (Figure 7B). Despite an initial peak for replicate 1 at the beginning of foam collection (4.0-fold enrichment after 24 h), the highest enrichments obtainedwere generally similar with a maximum enrichment of 3.3 after 51 h (Table 3). From about 40 h of cultivation, enrichment values have converged and settled between 2\u20133. Across the replicates, the mean enrichments were 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 for replicate 1 and 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 for replicate 2. Additional information on the individual sampling points with regard to surfactin enrichments, foam column parameters and flow rates of the foamate is provided in Supplementary Tables S1, S2. Interestingly during the bioreactor cultivations, the parameters of the foam column were adjusted depending on the foam formation and the process stage and were not limited to the previously defined operation window. The liquid flow was generally between 10\u201320mL/min and the gas flow was between 3\u20139 L/min (Supplementary Table S3).

At the end of the experiment, it was observed that the measured concentration in the medium decreased from 1.6 \u00b1 0.0 g/L surfactin to an amount of 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 g/L, which referred to 75% of the initial measured concentration. Since foam fractionation is intended to remove surfactin from the process, it seems logical at first that the concentration in the bioreactor would decrease. However, in this experiment, the absolute amount of discharged surfactin only accounted to 0.5 g. Therefore, the observation rather indicated that the surfactin distributed to a large extent in the foam which was built in the headspace of the bioreactor. This would also explain why the measured concentration in the medium was 1.6 g/L, although 2 g/L were initially added. The results and the hypothesis are in line with\nFIGURE 6 Time-course of cell dry weight (CDW) and surfactin production during exemplary batch cultivations.

To put the observation in numbers, Coutte et al. (2010) described that in one of their experiments, 714 mg surfactin were found in the foam whereas only 60 mg of surfactin were measured in the culture broth. This is an important factor to consider, as samples during bioreactor cultivation are often taken only from the culture broth to analyze titer and yield of the produced biosurfactant. In that case, the amount of foam in the headspace alongside the concentration of the biosurfactant in the foam is neglected, suggesting even higher titers and yields than described in the literature."

It was observed that the average surfactin enrichment achieved with the foam column (4.7 \u00b1 1.4) surpassed the surfactin enrichment using the foam trap (3.3 \u00b1 0.7). This might be explained by the so-called drainage effect. As the foam flows upward in the foam column, or builds up in the headspace, culture broth is also being held in the foam. Due to gravity, the liquid part can flow down, which results in a dry and enriched foamate (Burghoff, 2012; Winterburn and Martin, 2012; Oraby et al., 2022). This allows larger parts of unwanted substances such as cells and medium to be rinsed down, which further increases the enrichment in the foamate (Burghoff, 2012; Oraby et al., 2022). The set-up of the foam column used in this study additionally had a recirculation unit in which the liquid part could be directed back to the bioreactor. This recycling step was not possible with the here applied foam trap which might explain the overall lower enrichments achieved compared to the foam column. Interestingly, it has been reported in the literature that the recycling of collapsed foam or foaming of cells has a positive impact on surfactin production as well as cellular growth (Atwa et al., 2013; Alonso and Martin, 2016). In addition, the removal of the lipopeptide was suggested to be advantageous for production efficiency (Cooper et al., 1981), and that high surfactin concentrations also have a negative impact on bacterial growth (Lilge et al., 2022). In this study higher biomass titers were achieved in the foam column process compared to the reference process, which is in accordance with the literature findings. However, surfactin titers in the culture broth were not increased when introducing the foam column. In fact, concentrations that were in range of typically produced surfactin titers by B. subtilis JABs24 (between 1\u20133 g/L) were observed (Geissler et al., 2019b; Hoffmann et al., 2021). This indicates that the positive effect of foaming described above was not clearly recognizable at first glance. Reasons for this might have been due to the low flow rates of the foamate, as maybe not as much foam and/or cells have been removed and recycled. Moreover, cells were subjected to foaming in both process scenarios. In order to understand the findings and correlations even better, further investigations also regarding production efficiency can be considered in follow-up studies."

It was observed that a lower aeration also resulted in a lower flow rate as it took longer for the foam to travel through the foam column. Simultaneously it was observed that the sample with the lowest flow rate also had the highest enrichment. This was most likely due to an increased time for drainage (view chapter 4.2) as Zhang et al.

In the described examples the aeration and agitation were monitored however in the bioreactor itself, as the foam column was attached to the headspace of the bioreactor. Again, high agitation and/or aeration was found to increase foam formation, which was associated with a higher flow rate of the foamate, but at the same time, lower enrichment of surfactin (Davis et al., 2001; Santos da Silva et al., 2015)."

            "text": "Although foam formation occurred during cultivation of B. subtilis 168 in the bioreactor, it appeared that surfactin was required for the functionality of the foam column. Foam formation itself in aerated fermentation processes is not unusual (VardarSukan, 1998), however the foam was not stable enough to rise in the foam column. This underlined that the presence of surfactin was required to operate the column in this process. This observation was as expected, since surfactin is a surface-active compound (Arima et al., 1968) and as such is able to stabilize the foam (Burghoff, 2012; Stevenson, 2019). Due to this feature, Burghoff (2012) even described foam fractionation as a method to separate surfaceactive compounds from other metabolites of the culture broth. Additionally, in a study by Chen et al. (2006) it was observed that a minimum of 10 mg/L of surfactin was required to achieve foaming.\nHowever, not only surfactin had an influence on foam stability, but also the presence of cells and cell metabolites. Davis et al. (2001) described that in a cell-free operation, the foaming capacity was lowered and hypothesized that cells have a positive effect on foaming. Additionally, it was also determined, that cell-free samples had a higher enrichment (Davis et al., 2001), which was in line with here obtained results. The average enrichment in cell-free medium (4.7 \u00b1 1.4) was higher compared to the average enrichment during cultivation (2.5 \u00b1 0.6). Junker (2007) summarized in their review various factors that influence foam stability during cultivation, amongst them were cells and cell metabolites, medium components, and bacterial growth. Another interesting fact to consider is the natural ability of Bacillus species to secrete proteins and enzymes (van Dijl and Hecker, 2013). Foam fractionation is not limited to the separation of biosurfactants, but is also applied for proteins (Stevenson, 2019; Oraby et al., 2022) which, among other metabolites, can have a positive effect on foam stability (St-Pierre Lemieux et al., 2019). When using foam fractionation in the negative control B. subtilis 168, the foam column did not work without the surface-active lipopeptide being present. However, protein quantification or further protein investigation was not considered in the experiments but could be an interesting element for future works, especially when applying strains that produce large amounts of protein. In this context it would then also be interesting to conduct a proteomic analysis of the cell-free supernatant to gain clarity on the extracellular proteins present during fermentation."

(2014), with a mean bacterial enrichment of <0.2 to 1.6. Alongside the bacterial growth, surfactin production also showed deviations, though maintaining a similar trend. For Replicate 1 an initial highpoint of a 4.0-fold enrichment was measured at the beginning of sampling. An initially high surfactin enrichment was also observed byWillenbacher et al. (2014) and Santos da Silva et al. (2015). This might also be caused by the previously discussed drainage effect (see chapter 4.2) as it took some time for the foam column to run before sampling was possible. Therefore, the first sample might have been more dry and therefore more enriched (Burghoff, 2012). This characteristic high point at the beginning of sampling might have been missed in the second replicate. Despite difficulties in reproducibility and a large number of influencing parameters, both the average and maximum surfactin enrichment were in a comparable range between 1.0\u20134.0 when looking at the overall performed experiments (Supplementary Table S3). However, the achieved surfactin enrichments in this process were generally lower compared to other studies. For example, Davis et al. (2001) and Chen et al. (2006) achieved enrichments of >50. Results by Santos da Silva et al. (2015) were more comparable with enrichments of 1.4\u20137.4 depending on aeration and agitation rates. However, the highest enrichment obtained in their study (28.7) was still considerably higher than the values obtained here. These differences in enrichment could have been due to a number of reasons. First, it should be noted that different cultivation and foam fractionation methods have been applied, as well as different bacterial strains, which makes a direct comparison difficult. Especially the influence of aeration and agitation rates during the process have been proven to have an influence on the surfactin concentration and enrichment (Davis et al., 2001; Santos da Silva et al., 2015) as discussed in chapter 4.3. The design of the foam column also has an influence on the drainage effect and thus on the enrichment of the surfactant (Zhang et al., 2015; Oraby et al., 2022). As shown by Willenbacher et al. (2014), the choice of the bacterial strain should also not be neglected. They found a discrepancy as surfactin enrichment was ranging from 12.7 \u00b1 1.0 (DSM 3258) to 161.1 \u00b1 6.0 (DSM 1090) in dependence of the used strain. These observations suggest that before applying ISPR for lipopeptide production, not only the choice of foam fractionation method, but also the choice of fermentation process and bacterial strain should be carefully evaluated. Oraby et al. (2022) came to similar conclusions in their literature review by pointing out that there is no standardized foam fractionation method and emphasizing the need for individual process design. This indicates that the research results obtained in this study and the conclusions from the literature review are complementary and supportive of each other, also with regard to the difficulties encountered during foam fractionation (Oraby et al., 2022).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org11"

            "text": "Although a mechanical foam disruption technique was used, the foaming was difficult to control in the bioreactor vessel. Overfoaming occurred regularly during cultivations with surfactin producer B. subtilis JABs24, also leading to failure of the experiments (Supplementary Table S3). An application of chemical antifoam was problematic, as foaming itself is essential to enable sampling. It has to be noted that even in the antifoam-controlled reference processes, overfoaming occurred as both the mechanical and the chemical foam disruption were not sufficient. Intense loss in culture medium was also observed during foam fractionation processes in Davis et al. (2001) and Santos da Silva et al. (2015). The deduction of culture broth in other studies could only be contained by lowering the aeration and agitation rates (Santos da Silva et al., 2015) or compensated by using two subsequent vessels to collect the overflowing liquid with a recycling unit to the bioreactor (Gong et al., 2009). Furthermore, it was seen that the overfoaming sometimes happened in a wave-like manner (Supplementary Figure S4B). This suggests that a collection of foam during cultivation over a foam trap seems to be challenging as continuous foam removal can be difficult to reach. This was already put forward by Rangarajan and Clarke (2015) who included the \u201cmainte-nance of uniform foaming characteristics and foam stability\u201d (Rangarajan and Clarke, 2015) as a challenge for foam fractionation. However, as reviewed by Oraby et al. (2022) the use of a foam trap is still one of the favoured methods for foam fractionation and is used in more than 50% of the applications studied, and when the products were biosurfactants, foam traps were used in as many as two-thirds of the cases. Besides the overfoaming, sensitivity towards fluctuations in pO2 regulation and difficulty in maintaining a steady measurement were observed, possibly explaining differences in bacterial growth and surfactin production throughout the biological replicates. The extremely non-stationary behavior during fermentation due to strong foam formation with corresponding inhomogeneity might have hampered the measurements of the pO2 probes (Vardar-Sukan, 1998; St-Pierre Lemieux et al., 2019), apart from potential technical performance problems. However, a stable pO2 regulation is crucial as we previously discussed that aeration and agitation directly influence the foam behavior and enrichment (view chapter 4.3). Therefore, the regulation of it should be reliable and robust. These challenges highlight the need for a better control system that continuously measures foam formation and not only monitors and regulates pO2, but is also able to adjust to process dynamics. This seems plausible when looking at how the foam is built in the foam column. As described by Stevenson (2019), there are three phases: i) the \u201cliquid pool\u201d or \u201cpulp phase\u201d, ii) the \u201cfoam phase\u201d where the foam flows up the column and iii) the \u201ccollection zone\u201d in which the foam can be sampled (Stevenson, 2019). If no or too little surfactin was present or if parameters were not adjusted accordingly, it was observed in this study that the phases were not in equilibrium to allow continuous sampling (Figure 4), for example, the liquid pool was too extensive (Figure 4C). The way the foam is built up in the foam generator column, which is decoupled from the bioreactor system, displays one of the highlights of the presented method and is a decisive distinction to a foam column that is directly connected to the bioreactor headspace. However, foam control was not achievable with the here applied set-up as the primary method, so additional measures had to be taken. Follow-up studies could therefore consider the application of the foam column in processes with minimal or no foam formation so that the advantages can be fully exploited. But also, the bubble size distribution in the foam is important for the success of foam fractionation and it is difficult to be measured and to be reproduced (Stevenson, 2019). Although its concrete influence is not fully elucidated as of yet, it is known that the bubble size (distribution) determines the dryness and the flow rate of the foamate and thus the overall perfomance (Stevenson, 2019). This is another reason why antifoam can hardly be used because it affects the bubble size and leads to heterogeneous bubble distribution (Al-Masry et al., 2006). To control these difficulties and to achieve an optimal ratio between the enrichment and the flow rate of the foamate, dynamic monitoring in the sense of a model-based process control (Oraby et al., 2022) or a specific sensor system would be of interest to address the discussed obstacles. Current advances on modelling foam fractionation focus on the broad parameters influencing foam fractionation. For example, a quasistatic model for foam fractionation was developed by Grassia (2023) to better understand the influences of operating conditions on the fractionation process and performance. In addition, Garc\u00edaFigueroa et al. (2023) worked on a model to also consider the biochemical properties and adsorption of the product as an influence on the separation. Another recent attempt was made by Keshavarzi et al. (2022), modeling BSA recovery by froth flotation with an emphasis on bubble size distribution as well as foam stability. These approaches underline the complexity of foam fractionation processes and proof that model implementation can be very extensive."

            "text": "A method for foam fractionation that is independent of the aeration in the bioreactor systems has been presented and evaluated for application in lipopeptide production processes. The functionality of this external foam column for lipopeptide enrichment was demonstrated on the example of surfactin. The main obstacle was the severe foam formation during the aerated fermentation process, which challenged reproducibility. Therefore, differences in bacterial growth and surfactin production were observed between replicates, yet the average surfactin enrichment was comparable throughout the experiments. This demonstrated the robustness of the here applied method. However, due to the described challenges, the external foam column can only be conditionally recommended in the case of highly aerated surfactin production processes. The bioprocess should therefore be thoroughly assessed before applying ISPR. Moreover, a smart control system, that adapts to the process dynamics would be advantageous for future monitoring of foam fractionation applications. However, an application of an external foam column as shown here would be conceivable for non-foaming\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org12\nprocesses, since the aeration and foaming can be monitored independently from the bioreactor process, which is one of the highlights of this method."
