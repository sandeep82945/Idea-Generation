    "abstractText": "Carbohydrate-based low-molecular-weight gelators are interesting new materials with many potential applications. These compounds can be designed to include multiple stimuli-responsive functional groups. In this study, we designed and synthesized several chemically responsive bolaglycolipids and dimeric carbohydrateand diarylethene-based photoswitchable derivatives. The dimeric glycolipids formed stable gels in a variety of solvent systems. The best performing gelators in this series contained decanedioic and dithienylethene (DTE) spacers, which formed gels in eight and nine of the tested solvents, respectively. The two new DTE-containing esters possessed interesting photoswitching properties and DTE derivative 7 was found to have versatile gelation properties in many solvents, including DMSO solutions at low concentrations. The gels formed by these compounds were stable under acidic conditions and tended to hydrolyze under basic conditions. Several gels were used to absorb rhodamine B and Toluidine blue from aqueous solutions. In this study, we demonstrated the rational design of molecular gelators which incorporated photoresponsive and pH responsive functions, leading to the discovery of multiple effective stimuli-responsive gelators.",

Among the many different types of molecular assemblies, lowmolecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) are a fascinating class of compounds which can be used to form supramolecular gels with different properties and applications. The formation of the resulting supramolecular gels from LMWGs relies on non-covalent intermolecular forces, including hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, and van der Waals interactions, etc. [1]. The gels formed by LMWGs have been explored as new materials with applications in various fields such as biomedical applications [2], drug delivery systems [3], optical and electronic materials [4], and the removal of pollutants [5]. Molecular gelators obtained from natural sources, such as carbohydrates, are especially useful new materials. Carbohydrates have been explored extensively to form supramolecular gels. The intrinsic chirality and biocompatibility of sugar-derived self-assembling systems lend them to many practical applications, including environmental applications and controlled-release delivery systems [6,7]. The conversion of sugars into useful functional materials using simple modifications to their original structure is a valuable strategy for the development of new advanced materials. The formation of supramolecular gels containing designed structures that are responsive to various stimuli is a well-studied method for creating novel functional materials. The typical gels formed by LMWGs are reversible and temperature sensitive, as they are in a solution phase at elevated temperatures and self-assemble to form gels at cooler temperatures. Many functionalities have been incorporated in the structure-based design of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6228. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176228 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6228 2 of 15\nnew molecular gelators, including functional groups sensitive to pH, light, and chemical stimuli. Among these various stimuli-responsive LMWGs, photoresponsive gelators are exceptionally interesting new materials showing great promise for practical applications. Utilizing light as a trigger can induce new material properties and has the potential for practical applications in interesting interdisciplinary applications. There are many photoresponsive functional groups that have been utilized in the design of molecular gelators including but not limited to azobenzene, diacetylene, and diarylethene [8\u201311]. Diarylethene (DAE)- or dithienylethene (DTE)-based molecular switches have gained great attention in recent years [12\u201317]. DAE-based systems have unique advantages and properties because they can form a stable cyclized isomer upon photo irradiation. Both the open and closed isomers are stable and can be interconverted with different stimuli [18]. Figure 1 depicts the isomerization of dithienylethene-based dicarboxylic acid 1 and the hexafluorinated derivative 2. Upon treatment with UV light, the DTE diacids are converted to the closed isomers that have extended conjugation, which produces red or blue colored products.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nin a solution phase at elevated temperatures and self-assemble to form gels at cooler tem-\nperatures.

Two main types of pho-\ntoresponsive DAE-based supramolecular gels have been studied. The first class incorpo-\nrates the DAE molecules with a known gelator to form a two-component gel system [19\u2013\n21]. The DAE photoswitches are used to modulate the properties of the resulting gels.\nBispyridinium dithienylethene derivatives have been applied in the formation of various\nhybrid gels with polymers or metal ions and other ligands to form photochromic supra-\nmolecular gels [22\u201326]. In the second main class of DAE-based gelators, the diarylethene\nfunctionality is part of the gelator structure, where the diarylethene moieties have been\nfunctionalized with a variety of other functional groups to form a low-molecular-weight\ngelator. Feringa et al. have reported several different DAE-based photoswitchable organo-\ngelators [27\u201330]. Tian et al. also reported DTE-based organogelators which contain a flu-\norescent naphthylamide functional group [31] or metal ion recognition unit [32]. Besides\nthese studies, several other dithienylcyclopentene-based low-molecular-weight organo-\ngelators have been synthesized and reported [33,34]. There are not many DTE-based low-\nmolecular-weight hydrogelators due to the hydrophobic properties of the DTE system. A\nseries of maleimide-based dithienyl switches incorporating tripeptides was reported to\nform hydrogels at 20\u201340 mg/mL [35]. Recently, Feringa et al. designed single-stranded\nDNA-based hydrogels which contain a diarylethene photoswitch [36].

Sodium salts of 1,2-bisthienylperfluorocyclopentene have also been covalently functionalized to form gels in DMF and DMSO [37]. Recently, an interesting photochromic LMWG which contains a hexafluorocyclopentene diethienyl moiety (F6DTE) with a covalently linked terpyridine moiety was studied, and the gelator formed assemblies with lanthanide ions that formed coordination polymeric gels [38].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6228 3 of 15\nDespite the examples of DTE-based LMWGs, to the best of our knowledge, using a sugar template to form a new DTE-based gelator has not been reported yet. Sugar-based DTE glycoconjugates have been designed and utilized for a variety of biomedical applications [39,40]. We are intrigued by the possibility of creating a novel class of photoswitchable carbohydrate-based gelators by incorporating DAE units into the sugar gelator template. As shown in Figure 2, we have previously prepared monomeric glucosamide esters (I) that were excellent gelators for many solvents, and these gelators showed potential applications in the biomedical and environmental sciences [41]. In this research, in order to design carbohydrate-based gelators with enhanced molecular assembling properties, we envisioned that dimeric derivatives (II) may increase intermolecular interactions and, therefore, result in more stable gels. Moreover, the differences in the hydrophobicity of the linkers between the sugar headgroups may also affect the gelation properties.

Gelator 5 had a relatively simple structure and was used for a gel stability study under basic conditions. Scheme 2 illustrates the cleavage of the respective short chain ester dimers under basic conditions to give the hydrolyzed product 9, whose gel test results were previously reported [41]. The gels of compound 5 were made in DMSO:H2O (v/v, 1:1) at a concentration of 8.0 mg/mL, after which they were allowed to sit for 2 h before adding the different pH solutions. At mild basic conditions of pH 12, full hydrolysis was seen for the gel of compound 5 after 120 h. The gel photos are included in ESI Figure S9. At pH 12, the gel appeared to disintegrate partially after 4 h, and did not fully dissolve until reaching 120 h, at which time the gelator was extracted and analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The NMR spectrum of the extracted crude compound is shown in Figure S10, which corresponds to the hydrolyzed product 9. This confirmed that the diesters could be hydrolyzed under basic conditions, and that if the compound forms a gel then it could be base-triggered to form a solution. Gelator 5 was also tested for its stability under acidic conditions, since the compound has an acetal functional group. Interestingly, under acidic conditions, the gels were still quite stable after 18 days. The recordings of their appearances are included in Table S1 and selected gel photos are included in ESI Figures S11 and S12 for pH 2 and pH 4, respectively.

Melting point measurements were carried out using a Fisher\u2013Johns Melting Point apparatus. UV-Vis experiments were performed using a SHIMADZU UV-1800 Spectrophotometer. The LCMS data were obtained using an Agilent 6120B Single Quad mass spectrometer and a LC1260 HPLC system. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained with a Thermo Scientific LTQ Discovery spectrometer using +ESI and reported for the molecular ion [M + Na]+. Optical Microscopy: A small amount of gel was transferred onto a clean glass slide and then left to air dry for approximately a day. The gel was then observed under an Olympus BX60M optical microscope at brightfield using an Olympus DP73-1-51 high-performance 17 MP digital camera with pixel shifting and Peltier cooling. The program used to acquire and store the images was CellSens Dimension 1.11. Gelation test: Approximately 2 mg of the desired compound was placed in a one-dram vial and 0.1 mL of the gelation solvent or solution was placed inside the vial to attain a concentration of 20 mg/mL. The vial was then heated until the gelator dissolved fully; sometimes the mixture was sonicated if necessary to help with dilution. After dissolving, it was left to cool for approximately 15 min or longer for the gel to form. After this period, if the sample was clear, it was recorded as soluble; if solid reappeared, it was recorded as a precipitate; if the sample formed a gel, then the vial was inverted; if there was no solvent flowing this indicated a stable gel; otherwise, it was recorded as an unstable gel. If gelation occurred, another 0.1 mL was added, and the method was repeated until an unstable gel formed. The MGC, which is the concentration prior to unstable gelation, was obtained.

Toluidine Blue Dye Absorption Studies\nThe gels formed by compound 7 in 4 mg/mL DMSO:H2O 1:2 were evaluated for their absorption of Toluidine blue dye. The solution was heated and then after cooling transferred into the gel column and left to settle for 14 h. For the closed form study, the solution was irradiated under UV 302 for 30 min to close the ring and heated. Then, after cooling it was transferred into the gel column and left to settle for 14 h in a dark room. In both the open and closed form column, 1 mL DI water was added on top of the column to flush DMSO from the gel column. Then, Toluidine blue dye 0.1 mL (50 mg/L) was added to 1 mL gel and left to settle for 30 min. When the dye finished passing, 1 mL water and 1.2 mL eluted liquid was added and diluted to 2.2 mL. The gel was stable enough to be inverted at the end of the experiment. Absorbance at \u03bbmax (630 nm) of Toluidine blue was measured using a calibration curve."

            "text": "General procedure for the derivative 5\u20138 synthesis from headgroup 4 Compound 4 was synthesized using a previously reported procedure [41]. In a 50 mL\nround bottom flask equipped with a drying tube the carboxylic acid (1.0 equivalents) was added to the flask, followed by diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (2.0 equivalents) and 1\u20132 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile/DMF. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then the headgroup, compound 4 (approximately 100 mg, 0.24 mmol, 2 equivalents), was added with 1\u20132 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile/DMF. The reaction mixture was then stirred for approximately 6\u201324 h at 70\u201375 \u25e6C, at which time TLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy were used to monitor the progress of the reaction. If not complete, the reaction mixture was stirred for longer. After the starting material was fully converted to the product, the reaction mixture was cooled and concentrated on a rotavap to remove the solvent. The crude product was worked up with DCM and 5% NaHCO3 solution, followed\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6228 12 of 15\nby water.
