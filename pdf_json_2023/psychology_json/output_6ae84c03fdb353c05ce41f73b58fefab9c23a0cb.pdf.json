    "abstractText": "There is an ever increasing use of local density dependent potentials in the mesoscale modeling of complex fluids. Questions remain, though, about the dependence of the thermodynamic and structural properties of such systems on the cutoff distance used to calculate these local densities. These questions are particularly acute when it comes to the stability and structure of the vapor/liquid interface. In this article, we consider local density dependent potentials derived from an underlying van der Waals equation of state. We use simulation and density functional theory to examine how the bulk thermodynamic and interfacial properties vary with the cutoff distance, rc, used to calculate the local densities. We show quantitatively how the simulation results for bulk thermodynamic properties and vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium approach the van der Waals limit as rc increases and demonstrate a scaling law for the radial distribution function in the large rc limit. We show that the vapor\u2013liquid interface is stable with a well-defined surface tension and that the interfacial density profile is oscillatory, except for temperatures close to critical. Finally, we show that in the large rc limit, the interfacial tension is proportional to rc and, therefore, unlike the bulk thermodynamic properties, does not approach a constant value as rc increases. We believe that these results give new insights into the properties of local density dependent potentials, in particular their unusual interfacial behavior, which is relevant for modeling complex fluids in soft matter.

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe modeling of structured fluids, such as micellar solutions, remains a challenge in soft matter. These fluids often consist of molecular aggregates whose dimensions vary between hundreds of nanometers and micrometers. The timescale of the motion of these aggregates can approach microseconds. These length and time scales are out of the reach of atomistic simulation, so mesoscale simulation techniques are required. These simulations should retain sufficient chemical detail to link phase structure to the chemical composition of constituent molecules, but they should also be\nsimple enough to allow the modeling of systems of many aggregates.1\u20135 Many mesoscale simulation techniques have been developed, and these have been applied to a wide variety of systems.\nOne methodology in common use is coarse-grained molecular simulations, where multiple atoms are subsumed into single effective beads, allowing for the simulation of larger systems. The form of the coarse-grained bead\u2013bead interaction potential may be obtained in a variety of ways, but in the majority of cases, such coarsegrained interaction potentials exhibit strong, short-range repulsions. It is possible to go further and make use of an ultra-soft coarsegrained interaction potential where the energy penalty for particle\nJ. Chem.

Such pair potentials have been used to model polymer\u2013polymer interactions, and they are in common use in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations.6\u20138 The absence of large forces allows relatively large simulation time steps, leading to a substantial speed-up of the simulation.\nThe greater the degree of coarse-graining, however, the more details of the original system are lost. Thus, the normal DPD interaction potential, for example, gives a poor approximation to the true equation of state (EoS), precluding the study of phase transitions.9 An interesting way to circumvent some of these problems while still retaining the computational efficiency of DPD is to introduce a potential energy function that depends on instantaneous, local densities. The local density for particle i, denoted here by \u03c1\u0304i, is a measure of the instantaneous number of particles within a cutoff distance, rc, of particle i. The potential energy function may then be chosen to yield, to some level of approximation, the thermodynamic behavior of an equation of state selected by the user. This approach is used in the gen-DPDE methodology10 and also in Many-body Dissipative Particle Dynamics (MDPD).11 Again, the softness of the interactions permits the use of large time steps, but now the user has control over the system\u2019s thermodynamic properties via the choice of the underlying equation of state.\nThe original MDPD model was proposed by Pagonabarraga and Frenkel11 and developed further by Trofimov et al.12 Various underlying equations of state have been studied.11\u201318 Square gradient terms have also been included in the potential energy function so as to give the user greater control over interfacial properties.14,19 On the theory side, liquid state integral equation theories have been developed to study the fluid structure and to calculate the degree to which the simulated bulk thermodynamic properties differ from those of the underlying equation of state.20,21 Recent reviews of MDPD are given in the following Refs. 15, 22, and 23. Some of the applications of MDPD include the simulation of droplets on various surfaces,14,24\u201327 nanodroplets,19,28 polymer solutions,29 and vapor\u2013liquid equilibria.9,13,17,18\nLocal density dependent interactions can also be used to improve the properties of traditional pairwise interactions, in effect adding an additional term correcting for some of the degrees of freedom imperfectly integrated out in the coarse-graining procedure in a simple and computationally efficient manner.30\u201333 Several applications have been suggested; notable among these are implicit solvent models32\u201334 and systems under highly non-equilibrium conditions, such as under shock.35,36 We also highlight the recent work of Hendrikse et al.,37 which proposes a MDPD parameterization for surfactant solutions and demonstrates the formation of micelles and the collection of surfactants at a liquid surface.\nIn this article, we present simulation results for a fluid where the local-density dependent potential (LDDP) is derived from an underlying van der Waals EoS. We compare these simulation results with the predictions of density functional theory (DFT), using the free-energy functional initially developed by Pagonabarraga and Frenkel.11 First, we report how the bulk thermodynamic properties, the vapor\u2013liquid coexistence curve, and the bulk fluid structure depend on the cutoff distance, rc. One would expect that an increase in rc would lead to an increased degree of mean-field behavior and an approach to the thermodynamic properties of the underlying EoS, but it is of interest to elucidate the nature of this approach.\nSecondly, we analyze the properties of the vapor\u2013liquid interface. This is of particular interest as it has been suggested that a stable vapor\u2013liquid interface requires the attractive and repulsive terms in the LDDP to have different length scales.11 Our LDDP has just one length scale, rc, yet we still find a stable interface. We go on to analyze how the interfacial properties depend on rc."

For the present study, we use a dimensionless form of the EoS in which the properties are given in terms of the parameters a and b. This takes the form\np\u2217 = \u03c1\u2217T\u2217\n1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 \u2212 \u03c1\u22172, (2)\nwhere the reduced density, pressure, and temperature are expressed as \u03c1\u2217 = b\u03c1, p\u2217 = b2p/a, and T\u2217 = b kBT/a, respectively. The reduced excess Helmholtz energy of the vdW EoS is given by\n\u03b2\u2217a\u2217,ex(\u03c1\u2217) = \u2212 ln (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217) \u2212 \u03b2\u2217\u03c1\u2217, (3)\nwhere \u03b2\u2217 = 1/T\u2217. To simplify the notation, we drop the asterisk from now on, but the reader should bear in mind that all thermodynamic and structural properties reported in this work are given in terms of the constants a and b.\nWe use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the canonical NVT ensemble to study this system. First, we define the coarse-grained density centered on particle i, \u03c1\u0304i, by\n\u03c1\u0304i =\u2211 j\u2260i w(rij), (4)\nwhere rij is the interparticle distance, and w(r) is a weighting function. This weighting function vanishes for r > rc, where rc is the cutoff distance, and is normalized such that \u222b drw(r) = 1. We use a quadratic weighting function throughout that is given in three dimensions by9\nw(r) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 15 2\u03c0r5c (r \u2212 rc)2, r < rc, 0, otherwise. (5)\nAll lengths, including rc, are in units of b1/3. Note that this is a different scaling to that used by Pagonabarraga and Frenkel,11 where lengths are expressed in units of rc. The scaling used here is helpful in the analysis of how properties vary with rc. Note that the vdW constants a and b can be seen as the molecular parameters that measure the scales for energy and molecular size. The parameters \u03f5 and \u03c3 play a similar role in the case of the Lennard-Jones fluid. However,\nJ. Chem.

The potential energy of the system, U, is related to the excess Helmholtz energy of the underlying van de Waals EoS and is given by\nU =\u2211 i\naexEoS(\u03c1\u0304i). (6)\nHere the sum is over all particles, and aexEOS(\u03c1) is the excess Helmholtz energy per particle of the underlying EoS as a function of the local density \u03c1, as given in Eq. (3). This choice of potential should yield an average potential energy, \u27e8U\u27e9, which is approximately equal to the excess Helmholtz energy of the chosen EoS,9 i.e.,\n\u27e8U\u27e9 \u2248 Aexsim \u2248 A ex EoS(\u03c1). (7)\nHere, Aexsim is the excess Helmholtz free energy obtained from the simulations and AexEoS = N a ex EoS. One of the main goals of the present study is to investigate how well these approximations hold. It is also necessary to obtain an expression for the force Fij exerted by particle i on particle j for the calculation of the pressure from the virial equation. This force is given by\nFij = \u2212[a\u2032(\u03c1\u0304i) + a\u2032(\u03c1\u0304j)]w\u2032(rij) rij rij , (8)\nwhere a\u2032 = daexEoS(\u03c1)/d\u03c1, w \u2032 (r) = dw(r)/dr,11 rij = rj \u2212 ri is the interparticle vector connecting the centers of mass of particles i and j, ri is the position of particle i, and rij = \u2223rij\u2223. With this expression, the pressure tensor p\u03b1\u03b2virial can be determined through the virial route as\np\u03b1\u03b2virial = \u03c1T\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 + \u27e8 1 V\u2211i \u2211 j>i r\u03b1i jF \u03b2 i j\u27e9, (9)\nwhere p\u03b1\u03b2 is the \u03b1\u03b2 component of the pressure tensor and V is the volume. The isotropic pressure is obtained as\np = 1 3 (pxx + pyy + pzz). (10)\nThe surface tension \u03b3 can be obtained from the simulation of the vapor\u2013liquid planar interface and is given by the difference between the normal (pN) and tangential (pT) pressures via\n\u03b3 = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e dz(pN(z) \u2212 pT(z)) \u2248 Lz 2 [pzz \u2212 1 2 (pxx + pyy)], (11)\nwhere Lz is the length of the simulation box in the direction normal to the interface, and the factor of 2 arises from the presence of two interfaces in the simulation.38\nThe excess chemical potential \u03bcex is calculated in the canonical simulations using Widom\u2019s particle insertion method.39,40 This is particularly efficient for soft-core potentials, such as those used in this work, because the absence of hard-core interactions means that insertions have an acceptably high probability of success even at high densities.\nOnce the chemical potential and the pressure are known, the excess Helmholtz energy Aexsim can be obtained from the Euler relation\nAexsim = N\u03bc ex sim \u2212 p ex virialV.

Starting configurations are created by either melting a cubic lattice or by producing a random configuration using PACKMOL.41 The simulation explicitly models a planar vapor\u2013liquid interface by placing N particles in an orthorhombic box of dimensions Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz , where Lm is the simulation box length in the m direction.38 This approach is usually known as the direct coexistence method. If, at a given temperature, the overall density of the system lies within the coexistence region, the system will separate into vapor and liquid regions. To promote the formation of a stable planar interface oriented perpendicular to the z direction, the dimensions of the simulation box are chosen such that Lx = Ly = L\u226a Lz . In our simulations, an overall density of approximately \u03c1 = 0.3 is selected. This density is reasonably close to the average of the co-existing vapor and liquid densities for all systems studied and, therefore, from the lever rule, gives reasonable volume fractions of the co-existing vapor and liquid. In the majority of our simulations, the box dimensions are chosen to be L = 3rc, while Lz is adjusted to generate the correct density. Simulations are performed with a range of N between 2197 and 8000 particles, with N adjusted in order to produce enough bulk liquid to establish the density profiles. To study the effect of rc, several values of rc are simulated to study the effect on the equilibrium properties. For each system size and rc value, a vapor\u2013liquid interface is first equilibrated at the lowest temperature analyzed. Subsequently, higher-temperature boxes are prepared by equilibrating a lower-temperature box at the new temperature. Equilibration simulations are run for \u223c105 cycles, followed by 105 cycles to obtain ensemble averages, where a cycle consists of N trial particle displacements. The densities of each phase, as well as the width of the interface, are obtained from the calculation of the density profile, which is sampled every 25 cycles using a bin width of 0.05rc.\nIt is of interest to examine how the interfacial properties depend on the interfacial area. To study this effect at a given state point and for two values of rc, boxes were again prepared with the direct-coexistence method. L was adjusted to vary the interfacial area, while the density of the VLE system was set to \u223c0.3. These simulations were performed with a range of number of particles N between 1446 and 13 709, depending on the interfacial area and rc.\nSubcritical and supercritical isotherms have also been studied using MC-NVT simulations for systems comprising N = 4096 particles. For a particular temperature, simulations at different densities, ranging from low-density to high-density fluid states, are performed. For each simulation, the pressure is calculated using the virial expression given by Eq. (9), while the excess chemical potential is calculated using the Widom particle insertion method by performing 200 insertions every 25 cycles.\nJ. Chem.

In this section, we outline how the interfacial and structural properties can be calculated using DFT, based on the functional first described by Pagonabarraga and Frenkel.11 We define a continuous version of Eq. (4), i.e.,\n\u03c1\u0304(r) = \u222b \u03c1(r \u2032 )w(\u2223r \u2212 r\u2032\u2223)dr\u2032, (13)\nwhere \u03c1(r) is the number density at position r, \u03c1\u0304(r) is the corresponding coarse grained density field, and w(r) is the weighting function described in Sec. II A.\nThe excess Helmholtz energy functional Aex11 is given by\n\u03b2Aex[\u03c1] = \u222b \u03c1(r){\u2212 ln (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r)) \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u0304(r)}dr. (14)\nThis is a reasonable choice of functional as, in the mean field limit corresponding to rc \u2192\u221e, \u03c1\u0304(r) = \u03c1(r) = \u03c1bulk, where \u03c1bulk is the bulk density of either vapor or liquid phases, Eq. (14) becomes exact by design. Note, however, that a second excess Helmholtz energy functional can be proposed, where the outer \u03c1 is replaced by \u03c1\u0304, which yields a functional Aex of the form\n\u03b2Aex[\u03c1] = \u222b \u03c1\u0304(r){\u2212 ln (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r)) \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1\u0304(r)}dr. (15)\nWhile both functionals recover the homogeneous vdW Helmholtz energy in the mean field limit, the second functional formulation given in Eq. (15) is found in all cases to give worse agreement with simulation than that given in Eq. (14). Equation (14) would seem a more natural choice, as it replaces the sum over particles in the potential energy function with an integral over the true, rather than the coarse-grained, number densities.\nThe grand potential, \u03a9, is given by\n\u03b2\u03a9[\u03c1] = \u03b2Aid[\u03c1] + \u03b2Aex[\u03c1] \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc\u222b \u03c1(r)dr, (16)\nwhere \u03b2Aid = \u222b\u03c1(r)[ln (\u039b3\u03c1(r)) \u2212 1]dr is the ideal gas contribution, and \u039b is the thermal de Broglie wavelength. An expression for the one-particle density is then obtained by the minimization of the grand potential with respect to the density, viz.,\n\u03b2 \u03b4\u03a9\n\u03b4\u03c1(r) = 0. (17)\nThis minimization yields\n\u03c1(r) = exp [ \u03b2\u03bc \u039b3 ] \u00d7 exp [ln (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r)) + \u03b2\u03c1\u0304(r)]\n\u00d7 exp [\u2212\u222b { 1 1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r\u2032) \u2212 \u03b2}\u03c1(r\u2032)w(r\u2032 \u2212 r)dr\u2032]. (18)\nFor the case of a planar vapor\u2013liquid interface, the densities depend only on z, and we have the boundary conditions,\n\u03c1(z) = \u03c1\u0304(z) = \u03c1liq, z \u2192 +\u221e, \u03c1(z) = \u03c1\u0304(z) = \u03c1vap, z \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n(19)\nThis ensures that the densities far from the interface correspond to the equilibrium bulk densities of the co-existing phases. Once the equilibrium density profile is determined, the surface tension \u03b3 can be calculated from\n\u03b3A = \u03a9 \u2212 pV , (20)\nwhere A is the interfacial area. The systems of equations were solved on a grid using the Picard iterative method to a tolerance of a norm of 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 using a grid size of 0.005 over a z distance of 20rc.\nIt is also possible to compute the radial distribution function g(r) of the bulk fluid through knowledge of the direct pair correlation function c(r1, r2). This can be obtained from the Helmholtz energy functional Aex via\nc(r1, r2) = \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b42 Aex\n\u03b4\u03c1(r1)\u03b4\u03c1(r2)\n={2\u03b2 \u2212 1\n1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r1) \u2212 1 1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r2) }w(r1 \u2212 r2)\n\u2212 \u222b \u03c1(r) 1\n(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304(r))2 w(r \u2212 r1)w(r \u2212 r2)dr.

From the direct correlation function, the total distribution function h(r) can be calculated from the Ornstein\u2013Zernike relationship\nh\u0302(k) = c\u0302(k)\n1 \u2212 \u03c1c\u0302(k) , (22)\nwhere f\u0302 (k) is the Fourier transform of a function f (r). From h\u0302(k), and subsequently from h(r), the radial distribution function g(r) can be calculated from g(r) = h(r) + 1.\nIt is also possible to estimate the value of \u03c1\u0304 at a given \u03c1 using DFT. This is given by\n\u03c1\u0304 = 4\u03c0\u03c1\u222b \u221e\n0 r2w(r)g(r)dr. (23)\nIf g(r) = 1, then we recover \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1."

III B, we discuss vapor\u2013liquid coexistence in more detail. Deviations between the simulation and analytic vdW results are always greater in the liquid phase, as was previously reported by Trofimov et al.12 The simulation results for the vapor phase do not show any significant deviation from the analytic vdW values. We have attempted to find numerically a scaling law for how the simulation results converge to the analytic vdW predictions with increasing values of rc, but unfortunately, this was not successful due to the limited number of rc values simulated. A much more intensive study would be needed to establish the form of this scaling from simulation.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we show that the average potential energy per particle, \u27e8U\u27e9/N, approaches the excess Helmholtz energy per particle of the analytic vdW EoS, given in Eq.

As before, the simulation data monotonically converges to the vdW predictions as rc increases. If we consider the isotherms in Fig. 2(a), we note that the deviations between the simulation and the analytical vdW predictions are greater at high densities.

III C, where we attempt to link these results to the fluid structure.\nB. Vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium Here we consider the dependence of the vapor\u2013liquid coexistence curve on the cutoff distance, rc. The simulation results have been obtained from the direct coexistence method outlined in Sec. II B.\nThe vapor\u2013liquid coexistence curves for a range of values of rc are shown in Fig. 3. Once again, we see a monotonic approach to the vdW predictions with increased rc. Indeed, for rc = 5, there is excellent agreement between simulation and vdW over the whole temperature range studied. The discrepancies are largely on the liquid side of the curve, with the simulations underestimating the co-existing liquid densities.\nThe direct coexistence method is unsuitable for the investigation of the critical region due to the presence of interfacial instabilities. Inferences, however, can be made about how the critical point depends on rc based on the data displayed. At the critical point, the liquid and vapor densities (denoted \u03c1l and \u03c1v, respectively) will converge and the difference will vanish. The change of (\u03c1l \u2212 \u03c1v) with T for varying rc is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3. In addition, plotted is the difference according to the analytical vdW EoS. We observe that as rc becomes smaller, (\u03c1l \u2212 \u03c1v) also decreases at any given temperature. An extrapolation of these curves indicates that Tc decreases as rc decreases, departing further and further from the prediction of the vdW EoS.\nA thorough characterization of the critical region, however, will require the use of specialized simulation techniques to assess if there is any departure from the expected mean-field behavior of the vdW EoS."

            "text": "We now turn to the structure of the bulk fluid. It is helpful to set the scene by beginning with DFT. An analysis of Eqs. (22) and (23) shows that DFT predicts an exact scaling law for the dependence of the total correlation function on rc, viz,\nh\u2217(r\u2217) = r3c h(r; rc). (24)\nHere r\u2217 = r/rc. Therefore, if DFT were an exact theory, then plots of the simulated values of h\u2217(r\u2217) vs r\u2217 would be identical for all values of rc at a given temperature and density. Before making this comparison, however, we first note in passing that a consequence of this scaling law is that in the limit of large rc, the total correlation function must tend to zero, and thus g(r)\u2192 1. This corresponds to the mean-field limit, where inter-particle correlations have negligible influence on equilibrium properties.\nWe now consider to what extent our simulation data accords with this scaling prediction. In Fig. 4, we present plots of h\u2217(r\u2217) vs r\u2217 for T = 0.175 and \u03c1 = 0.85. Simulation data for various values of rc are compared with the DFT prediction. While we are not able to claim that the DFT prediction of h\u2217(r\u2217) is exact, it would appear that the scaled simulation data appears to be approaching a limit as rc increases and that this limit appears to be in good agreement with the DFT prediction.\nFor systems that interact via pair potentials, one may relate the cavity function at zero separation, y(r = 0), to the excess chemical potential of a particle whose interaction with a bath particle is twice the pair potential of two bath particles. This is the separation theorem, which takes a particularly simple form for hard bodies.42 One might hope that such an analysis would provide insight into the magnitude of h(r = 0). One can still obtain an exact result that depends on the excess chemical potential of a particle with twice the weighting function of that of a normal fluid particle but, unfortunately, the resulting expression is not sufficiently transparent to give much insight into the value of h(r = 0).\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 194109 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0171331 159, 194109-6\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n11 January 2024 21:25:22\nIn the inset of Fig. 4, we plot the unscaled radial distribution functions, showing the approach to the mean-field limit of g(r) = 1 with increasing rc.\nGiven a radial distribution function for a fluid interacting via a pairwise additive potential, one is in a position to predict thermodynamic properties. One may, therefore, wonder if one may use the DFT prediction of g(r) to a similar effect and obtain corrections to the vdW EoS results for finite rc. The answer, unfortunately, appears to be no. The compressibility equation of state, for example, may be written as\n( \u2202p \u2202\u03c1 )\nT = kBT(1 \u2212 \u222b c(r)dr). (25)\nIf we convert to reduced units and integrate the direct correlation function, as given in Eq. (22), the result obtained for (\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202p)T is\nidentical to that obtained directly from the vdW equation of state, with no correction terms related to a finite value of rc.\nThe virial equation of state, Eq. (9), is not of a two-body form due to the many-body nature of the forces, so the virial pressure cannot be calculated given only a knowledge of g(r). Other quantities, such as the internal energy, are also many-body in nature, so again, knowledge simply of pair-correlations does not permit a calculation of the internal energy either.\nWhat is possible, however, is to use DFT to analyze the average of \u03c1\u0304i, denoted by \u03c1\u0304, using Eq. (23). In Fig. 5(a), we compare the\nDFT prediction for r3c( \u03c1\u0304\u2212\u03c1\n\u03c1 ) as a function of \u03c1 with values obtained from simulation for various values of rc for T = 0.3, which is a supercritical temperature. First, for DFT, given the scaling relationship for h(r), given by Eq. (24), and the fact that the weighting function, w(r), given in Eq. (5), has an identical scaling, one may show that r3c( \u03c1\u0304\u2212\u03c1 \u03c1 ) is independent of rc. This result shows that DFT predicts, as expected, that \u03c1\u0304 = \u03c1 as rc \u2192\u221e. We also note that the agreement between simulation and DFT improves as rc increases, though the simulation values are still far from the DFT peak at \u03c1 = 0.33. Furthermore, we note that r3c( \u03c1\u0304\u2212\u03c1 \u03c1 ) is positive for \u03c1 < 0.6 and negative thereafter. This is true for both simulation and DFT. Insight into this is given by the DFT plots of h\u2217(r\u2217) against r\u2217 for various values of \u03c1, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The simulation results are qualitatively similar to those predicted by DFT, with the agreement improving as rc increases, where there is a change of sign in h\u2217(r\u2217) for small r\u2217 as the density increases. At low densities, the attractive terms in the analytic vdW EoS dominate, and this is responsible for the clustering of particles and a positive value of h\u2217(r\u2217) at small r\u2217. At higher densities, repulsions set in to an ever-increasing degree, leading to negative values. In the region r\u2217 < 1, h\u2217(r\u2217) is largest at \u03c1 = 0.33. This correlates with the position of the peak in the r3c( \u03c1\u0304\u2212\u03c1 \u03c1 ) vs \u03c1 plot in Fig. 5(a). To gain more insight into the shape of this plot, we consider the integral over all space of h(r). The compressibility equation of state, given by Eq. (25), may be rewritten so as to relate this integral to (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202p)T via the equation\n\u222b h(r)dr = kBT( \u2202\u03c1 \u2202p )\nT \u2212 1/\u03c1. (26)\nIn the large rc limit, the right-hand side of this equation may be calculated from the analytic vdW EoS. As might be expected, given the short range of h\u2217(r\u2217) at this temperature, a plot of the integral on the LHS of Eq. (26) vs \u03c1 shows similar features to the r3c( \u03c1\u0304\u2212\u03c1 \u03c1 ) vs \u03c1 plot. The position of the maximum in Fig. 5(a) is roughly at the density for which (\u2202p/\u2202\u03c1)T is a minimum. This is equivalent to the density at which (\u22022p/\u2202\u03c12)T = 0, which is an inflection point in the p vs \u03c1 plot. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature, one would expect the magnitude of this peak to diverge.\nWe now return to the thermodynamic properties of the system, as plotted in Figs. 1 and 2. One might think that for finite rc, one may improve on Eq. (6) by replacing \u03c1 with \u03c1\u0304 in the final term, i.e.,\n\u27e8U\u27e9 \u2248 Aexsim \u2248 A ex EoS(\u03c1\u0304). (27)\nThis would correspond to the zeroth-order approximation of a fluctuation theory in which one expanded \u03c1\u0304i about its average value. Illustrative results are shown in Fig. 6(a), where we compare, as a function of density, the excess Helmholtz energy per particle (aexsim) and the average potential energy per particle (\u27e8U\u27e9/N) from our simulations with the analytic vdW predictions as a function of both \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0304, which were calculated from the simulations. We first note that \u27e8U\u27e9/N is always more negative than aexsim, with the magnitude of the difference increasing with increasing density. This indicates a negative excess entropy per particle. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that, on the whole, asimex is closer to the analytic vdW predictions when the density inserted into the vdW expression is \u03c1 rather than\nJ. Chem.

Conversely, \u27e8U\u27e9/N tends to lie closer to the analytic vdW expression using \u03c1\u0304.\nFigure 6(b) shows the variation of the excess pressure with density, comparing simulation data with the analytic vdW expression for the pressure [Eq. (2)] evaluated both at \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0304. Here, the agreement of all three values is good up to a density of around 0.7, after which the simulation data falls roughly halfway between the two analytic vdW predictions. Admittedly, the plots shown are for one temperature and one value of rc, but we have examined similar plots for other temperatures and other rc values, and the general message is that the simulation results do not, in general, agree better with the corresponding analytic vdW prediction using \u03c1\u0304 rather than \u03c1. A related discussion is provided by Trofimov et al.12"

            "text": "Finally, we turn to the liquid\u2013vapor interface, and we present both simulation and DFT results for the interfacial density profile and the interfacial tension \u03b3, as described by Eqs. (11), (18), and (20). DFT yields a scaling relation for the dependence of \u03b3 on rc, viz., \u03b3 = rc\u03b3\u2217, where \u03b3\u2217 is independent of rc. To explain this scaling relationship, we first note that in Eqs. (13) and (18), rc makes its appearance only via the weighting function, w(r), given in Eq. (5). If one changes to scaled coordinates r\u2217 = r/rc, then one may write w(r) = (1/r3c)w\u2217(r\u2217), where w\u2217 does not depend on rc.\nFIG. 7. Plots of the scaled surface tension \u03b3\u2217, against temperature. Symbols correspond to the MC simulation results at various values of rc, while the dashed curve is the DFT prediction.\nIf one changes the integration coordinates in Eqs. (13) and (18) to the scaled values, then all dependence of rc disappears, leading to the results that \u03c1(r; rc) = \u03c1(r\u2217). Therefore, within DFT, the density profile depends only on z\u2217. To calculate the surface tension from Eq. (20), a one-dimensional integration is required over z, while the integrand depends only on z\u2217. Changing the integration variable to scaled form leads to the scaling result \u03b3 = rc\u03b3\u2217. We note that we also checked these scaling results by numerical calculation.\nIt is thus natural, when comparing simulation results at various rc values with DFT, to compare \u03b3\u2217 rather than \u03b3. We do this in Fig. 7, where we plot \u03b3\u2217 against temperature. It is clear that the simulation results get close to the DFT predictions as rc increases. Again, this suggests that the DFT is a highly accurate theory for large rc.\nIt is worth comparing this result with that found for hard spheres with an additional weak but long-ranged repulsive pair potential. In the Kac limit, where the integral of this potential remains finite but the range tends to infinity, Sear and Frenkel43 also predicted a divergent surface tension between solid and fluid.\nThe observation that the surface tension is approximately proportional to rc is of practical importance for the simulation of systems, such as surfactants, where interfacial effects are important. While bulk thermodynamic properties appear to converge to those given by the underlying equation of state with increasing rc, this is not the case for surface tension or, as we will see below, for the interfacial density profile. To reproduce an experimental surface tension with the local density-dependent potential investigated here, one will need to choose a specific value of rc.\nWe now turn to the interfacial profiles. DFT predicts a density profile, \u03c1(z), that is a universal function of z/rc. Here, z represents the normal distance to the planar interface. In Fig. 8(a), we plot \u03c1(z\u2217) against z\u2217, where z\u2217 = z/rc. In general, there is a very good agreement between the simulation and the DFT results, particularly at low temperatures. One observes that for the range of temperatures shown, the density profiles on the liquid side of the interface are oscillatory. This is in contrast to the monotonically decreasing profiles commonly observed for fluids whose particles interact via standard pair potentials.44,45 These oscillations are found both in simulation and in DFT. This strongly suggests that these oscillations\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 194109 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0171331 159, 194109-8\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n11 January 2024 21:25:22\nare genuine features of the model rather than a simulation artifact. Simulations using a different local density-dependent potential than that studied here have also found such oscillations.14,18,31 Oscillations have also been observed in the simulation of liquid metals.46 To investigate the effects of interfacial area, we have run simulations for various areas and for two values of rc. The results are shown in Fig. 8(b) for rc = 3 and T = 0.15, while the inset shows results for rc = 4 at the same temperature. We observe that the oscillations begin to wash out as the interfacial area increases, presumably due to the increasing impact of capillary waves. The effects of capillary waves are not included in our DFT, so we surmise that the interfacial profiles calculated with DFT are related to the intrinsic interface (see, for example, Refs. 47 and 48). We have also calculated the area-dependent surface tension. Despite the noticeable area dependence of the interfacial profile, the surface tension showed negligible variation.\nPagonabarraga and Frenkel11 analyzed the interfacial properties of this system by conducting a gradient expansion of their DFT up to the square gradient term. They found a threshold temperature at which the sign of the square gradient term changed from positive to negative on lowering the temperature. They inferred that this was a sign of an unstable interface. An alternative explanation, however, is that the interface is stable but that the sign change is related to the\noscillatory structure of the density profile. Indeed, our simulations indicate the interface to be stable over a wide range of temperatures, possessing a well-defined surface tension. One way to analyze these oscillations theoretically is to seek a connection with a crossing of a Fisher\u2013Widom or Kirkwood line in the bulk liquid.49,50 Such lines mark the transition between regimes in which the asymptotic approach of h(r) to zero changes from monotonic to oscillatory. We have, therefore, analyzed the pole structure of h(k) as obtained from DFT for complex k at the co-existing vapor\u2013liquid densities.51,52 As might be expected, there are no oscillations in h(r) for the bulk saturated vapor at any temperature, but for the bulk saturated liquid, there is a transition of the Kirkwood type from oscillatory to monotonic at T = 0.2915. We note that this temperature is close to the critical temperature of 0.3. While one might expect the asymptotic form of h(r) to correlate with the asymptotic form of the density profile, this analysis does not deal with the form of the density profile close to the interface. That said, however, a numerical analysis of the DFT interfacial profile at T = 0.2925 shows a monotonically varying density profile with no sign of oscillation."

            "text": "In this paper, we have explored the thermodynamic, structural, and interfacial properties of a local density-dependent potential corresponding to an underlying van der Waals equation of state. The focus has been on the approach to the mean-field limit with an increase in the distance criterion used in calculating local densities, rc. The analysis is based both on simulation and DFT. The main points are as follows:\n(1) The bulk thermodynamic properties and the vapor\u2013liquid coexistence curves all converge to those given by the underlying EoS as rc increases. (2) DFT yields a scaling law for the radial distribution function of the bulk fluid. The simulation data appear to approach the DFT limit for large values of rc. (3) For finite rc, the average local density, \u03c1\u0304, differs from the bulk density, \u03c1. We compared simulation data with the predictions of the underlying vdW EOS, using both \u03c1\u0304 and \u03c1 in the vdW expressions. The conclusion is that using \u03c1\u0304 rather than \u03c1 in these expressions does not improve agreement with simulation. Indeed, for various state points, the agreement worsens. (4) At the vapor\u2013liquid interface, DFT predicts the surface tension to have a linear dependence on rc. The simulation data appears to show a similar scaling in the large rc limit, with the data appearing to approach the DFT predictions. Therefore, unlike the bulk thermodynamic properties, the interfacial tension does not approach a limiting value with increasing rc. (5) Both DFT and simulation both predict stable vapor\u2013liquid interfaces over a wide range of temperatures. The density profiles, however, are oscillatory up to temperatures close to the critical temperature. (6) It would appear that the DFT gives an excellent account of how this system approaches the mean-field limit for large rc. This is both for the radial distribution function of the bulk fluid and the interfacial tension and density profile.\nJ. Chem.

One is a careful analysis of the critical region. Another is a fuller analysis of the finite rc regime, making detailed comparisons with integral equation predictions.20,21 The existence of a high-quality DFT also makes the investigation of inhomogeneous fluids an interesting venture.\nFrom a practical point of view, we believe this work gives increased insight into how close the predictions of a simulation using a local density-dependent potential with a given value of rc would approach those of the underlying equation of state. The DFT, in particular, could be a helpful tool in aiding parameterization. Most important, though, is that vapor\u2013liquid interfaces are likely to be stable, even if the potential only involves a single value of rc, and that the interfacial tension has an asymptotic linear scaling with rc. If one wished to use a standard EoS without the use of additional square gradient terms to generate a local density-dependent potential function, then a specific value of rc would be needed to reproduce the target interfacial tension."
