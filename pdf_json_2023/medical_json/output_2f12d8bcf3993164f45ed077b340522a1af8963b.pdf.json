    "abstractText": "Our previous work showed that KRAS activation in gastric cancer cells leads to activation of an epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesen\u2010 chymal transition (EMT) program and generation of cancer stem\u2010like cells (CSCs). Here we analyze how this KRAS acti\u2010 vation in gastric CSCs promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Gastric cancer CSCs were found to secrete pro\u2010 angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF\u2010A), and inhibition of KRAS markedly reduced secretion of these factors. In a genetically engineered mouse model, gastric tumorigenesis was markedly attenuated when both KRAS and VEGF\u2010A signaling were blocked. In orthotropic implant and experimental metastasis models, silencing of KRAS and VEGF\u2010A using shRNA in gastric CSCs abrogated primary tumor formation, lymph node metas\u2010 tasis, and lung metastasis far greater than individual silencing of KRAS or VEGF\u2010A. Analysis of gastric cancer patient samples using RNA sequencing revealed a clear association between high expression of the gastric CSC marker CD44 and expression of both KRAS and VEGF\u2010A, and high CD44 and VEGF\u2010A expression predicted worse overall survival. In conclusion, KRAS activation in gastric CSCs enhances secretion of pro\u2010angiogenic factors and promotes tumor progression and metastasis.",

            "text": "Worldwide, there are over one million new gastric cancer cases and nearly 800,000 gastric cancer deaths per year, and thus gastric cancer accounts for almost 10% of all cancer deaths [1]. Gastric adenocarcinomas (GAs) comprise the vast majority of gastric cancers, and most patients with GA present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The response rate of GA to chemotherapy can be 50% or greater, but nearly all patients develop chemotherapy resistance, and median survival is extended only to about one year [2]. Thus, there is an urgent need for new and more effective therapies.\nIn the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study of GA, genes encoding the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)RAS signaling pathway were altered in 60% of GAs [3]. The RAS family of proteins in humans includes KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS [4], and KRAS is specifically amplified or mutated in 17% of GAs [3]. Upon stimulation by upstream receptors, KRAS recruits RAF to the cell membrane where it promotes RAF dimerization and activation. Activated RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, and activated MEK in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK.\nWe previously found that oncogenic Kras can increase gastric tumorigenesis and metastasis in a genetically engineered mouse model [5]. In GA driven by Cdh1 loss and Trp53 loss in gastric parietal cells, 69% of mice developed diffuse-type GA that metastasized to lymph nodes at one year [6]. Combining Cdh1 loss and Trp53 loss with oncogenic Kras (KrasG12D) increased the penetrance of GA to 100% and reduced survival to 76days. In these mice, both intestinal and diffuse primary tumors were observed throughout the stomach, as well as lymph node, lung, and liver metastases. In a subsequent study, we demonstrated that KRAS activation promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) phenotypes, including metastatic potential and chemoresistance [7]. Levels of KRAS and levels of KRAS activation in numerous gastric cancer cells lines grown as monolayers and as spheroids were significantly increased in gastric cancer cells grown as spheroids vs. monolayers. CD44 is a marker of gastric cancer stem-like cells. CD44( +) cells exhibited significantly higher levels of KRAS signaling activation compared to CD44(-) cells. However, the exact mechanism by which metastasis was enhanced was not specifically elucidated.\nAngiogenesis, or new blood vessel formation, is a vital process in the progression and metastasis of solid tumors, including GA [8]. Tumors induce angiogenesis by secreting pro-angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and VEGF-A inhibition has become a common therapeutic strategy for\nmany cancers [9]. Several drugs targeting the VEGF-A pathway have been approved for clinical use in selected solid tumors, and several anti-VEGF-A strategies have been examined for GA. Two international phase III trials examined ramucirumab, an antibody targeting the primary receptor for VEGF-A, VEGFR-2, as second line therapy for advanced GA and found a survival benefit both as single agent therapy and when combined with chemotherapy [10, 11].\nIn this study, we hypothesized that KRAS signaling in gastric CSCs promotes the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors that would enhance primary tumor formation and metastasis."

All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee, Columbia University. This research was in accordance with ARRIVE quidelines.

To harvest the tumors, 2 mice in each group were sacrificed at 12\u00a0weeks, stomachs were harvested and processed as above.\nLung, liver, and\u00a0lymph node metastasis models To generate experimental lung metastases, mice were injected via the tail vein with 5 \u00d7 104 CD44( +), CD44(-), or unsorted Tcon3077 cells (n = 6 per group).

In a subsequent experiment, 5 X104 CD44( +) cell stably transduced with control shRNA, KRAS shRNA, VEGF-A shRNA, or both KRAS and VEGF-A shRNA were injected into the tail vein of mice (n = 7 per group). At 3.5weeks after tumor cell injection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 \u03bcL D-luciferin solution (150mg/kg, #122,799, Perkin Elmer), anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and imaged in a Xenogen IVIS 200 (PerkinElmer) after 5min according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol.

These triple conditional or Tcon mice developed both intestinal and diffuse type GAs with 100% penetrance and metastases to lymph nodes, lung, and liver. We generated tumor-derived organoids and cell lines from two tumors from Tcon mice and labelled them Tcon3077 and Tcon3944.\nGrowth of tumor cells as spheroids enriches for cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) [18]. We first harvested conditioned media from Tcon3944 cells grown as monolayer cells and as spheroids, and applied the conditioned media to mouse vein endothelial cells (MVEC) in a tube formation assay. Conditioned media from Tcon3944 spheroid cells led do a 2.2-fold increase in tube formation compared to conditioned media from Tcon3944 monolayers cells (Fig.\u00a01A). Similar results were seen with conditioned media from Tcon3077 cells (data not shown). We next examined human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation in conditioned media from four human GA cell lines (AGS, MKN-45, SNU668, and KATOIII) grown as monolayers or as spheroids. Conditioned media from spheroid cells led to a 1.9\u20134.3-fold increase in tube formation compared to conditioned media from monolayer cells (Fig.\u00a01B).\nTo determine if KRAS promotes secretion of angiogenic factors in GA spheroid cells, we knocked down KRAS using shRNA. The knockdown efficiency of KRAS in all GA cell lines was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a0 1C, Suppl. Figs. S5A, B). KRAS knockdown in Tcon3944 spheroid cells reduced the ability of conditioned media to promote MVEC tube formation by 86.3% (Fig.\u00a01D). Similar results were found when KRAS was knocked down in Tcon3077 spheroid cells (data not shown) and in spheroid cells from the four human GA cell lines, with decreases in HUVEC tube formation of 75\u201391% (Fig.\u00a01E). These data suggest that KRAS activation in GA spheroid cells promotes secretion of pro-angiogenic factors.\nKRAS promotes GA spheroid cell secretion of\u00a0VEGF\u2011A, FGF\u20112, and/or\u00a0EGF To determine which pro-angiogenic factors were being secreted, we collected conditioned media from Tcon3944 cells grown as monolayers and as spheroids and examined for secreted angiogenic factors using the Proteome Profiler Mouse Angiogenesis Array kit. The four angiogenic factors secreted most by Tcon3944 spheroid cells\nrelative to monolayer cells were FGF-2, IL-1\u03b1, EGF, and VEGF-A (spheroid secretion 5.7\u201313.5-fold higher than monolayer secretion) (Fig.\u00a0 2A). KRAS shRNA knockdown in Tcon3944 spheroid cells led to 72\u201381% reductions in the secretion of these factors, including an 80% reduction in VEGF-A secretion (Fig.\u00a02B). The angiogenic secretomes of SNU668 human GA cells grown as spheroids and as monolayers differed somewhat from that of Tcon3944 cells. Secretion of EGF, Amphiregulin, and VEGF were upregulated 10.8\u201336.6-fold (Fig.\u00a02C). KRAS shRNA in SNU668 spheroid cells led to 49\u201380% reductions in secretion of these angiogenic factors, including an 80% reduction in VEGF-A secretion (Fig.\u00a0 2D). The angiogenic factors EGF and FGF-2 were also secreted at increased levels by AGS and MKN-45 spheroid cells compared to monolayers cells (Suppl. Figs. S1A, B). VEGF-A secretion was only 2.2\u20133.1-fold higher. However, for all five cells lines, KRAS shRNA dramatically reduced VEGF-A secretion between 50\u201390% (Figs.\u00a02B, D, Suppl. Figs. S1C, D).\nTo confirm that VEGF-A, FGF-2, and/or EGF were responsible for promoting tube formation, we again knocked down KRAS in AGS and MKN-45 spheroid cells and applied the conditioned media supplemented with recombinant VEGF-A, FGF-2, or EGF to HUVEC in a tube formation assay. The addition of these proangiogenic factors partially restored tube formation, with recombinant VEGF-A having the most significant effect (Fig.\u00a02E). These data confirm that KRAS activation promotes secretion of pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF-A in GA spheroid cells.\nRTK/KRAS and\u00a0VEGF\u2011A/VEGFR\u20112 in\u00a0GA organoid cells combine to\u00a0promote primary tumor growth To examine the role of the KRAS and VEGF-A in tumorderived organoid formation, we knocked down KRAS, VEGF-A, or both in Tcon3077 cells and grew them as organoids. Western blot analysis confirmed stable KRAS and/or VEGF-A knockdown by shRNA in Tcon3077 organoids (Suppl. Figs. S1E, S6A). KRAS shRNA attenuated organoid growth, but VEGF-A shRNA did not (Fig.\u00a0 3A). In addition, expression of the CSC marker CD44 in Tcon3077 organoids was reduced by KRAS shRNA but not by VEGF-A shRNA. (Fig.\u00a03B).\nWe previously inhibited RTK/KRAS signaling in Tcon mice by treating with a MEK inhibitor starting at 4weeks of age, and median survival increased from 76 to 95\u00a0days [5]. DC101 is a neutralizing antibody for VEGFR-2, the primary receptor for VEGF-A [19]. We next examined the combination of VEGF-A inhibition and MEK inhibition in Tcon mice (n = 7 per group). MEK inhibition alone increased median survival by 23\u00a0days, DC101 increased median survival by 45\u00a0days,\nand combination therapy increased median survival by 91\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a03C). Two mice in each group were sacrificed at 10\u00a0weeks of age, and 3 tumors in each stomach were examined. Inhibition of both MEK and VEGF-A at this time point led to smaller and earlier stage stomach tumors (Fig.\u00a03D), decreased expression of the CSC marker CD44 (Fig.\u00a03E, Suppl. Fig. S2A), and decreased microvessel density (Fig.\u00a03F, Suppl. Fig. S2B) compared to MEK inhibition alone or VEGF-A inhibition alone.\nThe effects of RTK-RAS and VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 inhibition were next examined in an orthotropic model of GA. CD44 + Tcon3077 cells were isolated by FACS and then stably transduced with lentiviral shRNA vectors to knockdown KRAS, VEGF-A, or both (Fig.\u00a0 4A, Suppl. Fig. S6B). The lentiviral shRNA vectors also transduced the luciferase reporter gene. Stably transduced CD44 + Tcon3077 cells were grown as organoids and injected into the gastric wall of syngeneic mice (n = 7 per group) and bioluminescence imaging using the Xenogen IVIS system was performed at 8, 10, 12, and 15\u00a0weeks. At 10\u00a0weeks, tumor bioluminescence was decreased by 39% with KRAS knockdown, 44% with VEGF-A knockdown, and 96% with combined KRAS and VEGF-A knockdown (Fig.\u00a04B). Two mice were sacrificed at 12\u00a0weeks and stomach were analyzed. In this orthotopic model, mice generally develop a single tumor at the injection site. By gross inspection, tumors from control organoid cells were\nlarge, tumors from organoid cells with knockdown of KRAS or VEGF-A were intermediate in size, and tumors from organoid cells with knockdown of both KRAS and VEGF-A were hard to distinguish (Fig.\u00a0 4C). Given only two tumors were analyzed for each group, we increased the number of sections analyzed per tumor from 3 to 5. Following H&E staining, tumors were identified in all 4 groups, but tumors from organoid cells with knockdown of both KRAS and VEGF-A were small and early stage (Fig.\u00a04C, Suppl. Fig. S2C). Tumors were then stained by immunofluorescence for CD44, CD31, and phosphorylated MEK (Fig.\u00a0 4D). Knockdown of KRAS or VEGF-A led to reduced expression of CD44, CD31, and phosphorylated MEK by 36.7\u201361.5%, while knockdown of both KRAS and VEGF-A reduced expression of these proteins by 94.1\u201395.6%. Median survival of mice was 66\u00a0 days, 85\u00a0days, 91\u00a0days, and 121\u00a0days for tumors with no knockdown, knockdown of KRAS, knockdown of VEGF-A, and knockdown of both KRAS and VEGF-A, respectively (Fig.\u00a04E).\nRTK/KRAS and\u00a0VEGF\u2011A/VEGFR\u20112 in\u00a0CD44( +) GA cells promotes metastasis GA metastasizes to lymph nodes, liver, and lung. We examined the role of KRAS and VEGF-A in promoting metastases using experimental metastasis models. Tcon3077 cells were FACS sorted into CD44( +) and CD44(-) cells, and experimental lung metastases were generated by injecting CD44( +), CD44(-), and unsorted cells into the tail veins of syngeneic mice (n = 6 per group). Based on our previously published paper on CD44 expression in gastric cancer cells, the proportion of CD44-expressing cells in unsorted cells is less than 1% of the total cell population [18]. Mice were sacrificed 3.5\u00a0weeks after tumor cell injection, and lungs were examined by H&E staining. CD44( +) cells formed significantly more lung metastases than CD44(-) or unsorted cells (Fig.\u00a0 5A). In a subsequent experiment, Tcon3077 CD44( +) cells were stably transduced with KRAS shRNA, VEGF-A shRNA, or both, and injected into the tail vein of syngeneic mice to form experimental lung metastases (n = 7 per group). At 3.5\u00a0 weeks, bioluminescence imaging was performed, mice were sacrificed, and lungs were analyzed. Knockdown of KRAS or VEGF-A led to a 45\u201348% reduction in bioluminescence compared\nto controls, while knockdown of both KRAS and VEGFA led to an 86% reduction (Fig.\u00a05B, Suppl. Fig. S2D). H&E staining and YFP immunofluorescence revealed large lung metastases in control mice, smaller lung metastases in mice injected with cells with KRAS or VEGF-A knockdown, and only a few microscopic metastases in mice injected with cells with both KRAS and VEGF-A knockdown (Fig.\u00a0 5C). Next VEGF-A immunohistochemistry and VEGF-A/CD31/CD44 triple immunofluorescence were performed on harvested lungs, and VEGF-A, CD31, and CD44 expression were all dramatically reduced in mice injected with cells with both KRAS and VEGF-A knockdown (Fig.\u00a05D).\nNext, the effect of VEGF-A and KRAS knockdown in Tcon3077 cells was assessed in an experimental lymph node metastasis model [20]. CD44( +) Tcon3077 cells stably transduced with KRAS shRNA and VEGF-A shRNA or control shRNA were inoculated into the footpads of mice (n = 6 per group). After 4\u00a0 weeks, inguinal lymph nodes were assessed. Mice bearing tumors cells with KRAS and VEGF-A knockdown had inguinal node metastases that were significantly smaller than those of mice bearing control tumors (Suppl. Figs. S3A, B). Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE 1) is a cell surface receptor on\u00a0 lymphatic endothelial cells\u00a0 that can be used as a lymphatic endothelial cell marker [21]. Node metastases from cells with knockdown of KRAS and VEGF-A also had 3.8-fold reduced expression of LYVE-1 and 4.9-fold reduced expression of CD44 compared to control node metastases as measured by immunofluorescence staining (Suppl. Fig. S3C).\nExpression of\u00a0CD44, KRAS, AND\u00a0VEGFA genes in\u00a0GA patient tumors We next analyzed expression of CD44, KRAS, and VEGFA using RNA-sequencing data from paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from 83 GA patients previously examined by Jun et\u00a0al. [14]. Expression of CD44, KRAS, and VEGF-A were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues (Fig.\u00a0 6A, Suppl. Fig. S4A). Hierarchical clustering of patients based on log2 fold-change values of these three genes showed that patients could be divided into three groups as defined by CD44 expression level: CD44 Low, CD44 Intermediate, and CD44 High (Fig.\u00a0 6B) [15].

Of note, our CD44 High cluster was also enriched for the microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ACRG classifications [22].\nWe performed a functional gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that compared the transcriptome data of the CD44 Low and CD44 High clusters using the MSigDB Hallmark gene sets [16, 17]. We found that tumors in the CD44 High cluster were significantly enriched in cancer promoting pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and KRAS signaling up (Suppl. Fig. S4B). Both KRAS and VEGF-A expression were significantly higher in the CD44 High cluster than in the CD44 Low cluster (Fig.\u00a0 6C), and the expression levels of the two genes showed a significant positive correlation (Suppl. Fig. S4C).\nWe previously demonstrated that higher expression of CD44 and phosphorylated MEK (a marker of KRAS pathway activation) in GA patient tumors are poor prognostic factors for overall survival [23]. We next investigated the prognostic significance of CD44 and VEGF-A in 112 GA patients undergoing surgical resection at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (FMUUH). The clinicopathological characteristics of these patients are shown in Supplemental Table\u00a01. Tumor samples were stained by immunofluorescence for expression of CD44 and VEGFA (Suppl. Fig. S4D). We confirmed that patients with higher levels of tumor CD44 expression had worse 5-year overall survival than patients with lower levels of tumor CD44 expression (Suppl. Fig. S4E). Moreover, we found high expression of VEGF-A was significantly associated with worse overall survival (Fig.\u00a0 6D). The worst overall survival was seen in patients with tumors with high level of both CD44 and VEGF-A (Suppl. Fig. S4F)."

            "text": "GAs and other solid tumors need to induce angiogenesis, or new blood vessel formation, to expand and metastasize [8]. Solid tumors are comprised of heterogeneous cell populations, and thus it would not be surprising that some populations could induce tumor angiogenesis better than others. CSCs are a minority subset of tumor cells with the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation [24].\nThese CSCs may be the primary source of metastases [25]. In a prior study, we found that KRAS is upregulated in gastric CSCs and drives various phenotypes including EMT, chemotherapy resistance, and metastasis [7]. In this study, we find that KRAS in CSCs drives secretion of pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF-A. Inhibition of both KRAS and VEGF-A either genetically by RNA interference or pharmacologically using inhibitors or antibodies greatly attenuates primary tumor growth, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Analysis of human tumors using RNA sequencing and IHC reveals a high correlation between expression of the CSC marker CD44 and expression of KRAS and VEGF-A. Furthermore, high CD44 and high VEGF-A expression correlate with worse overall survival. These data indicate that dual targeting of KRAS and VEGF-A may be an effective strategy against GA, particularly in those patients having tumors with high levels of KRAS activation and VEGF-A secretion.\nThere is evidence from other investigators and our group that RTK-RAS signaling is important in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of gastric CSCs, and gastric tumorigenesis. Many of the phenotypic differences between CSCs and bulk tumor cells that lack stemness can be attributed to epigenetic changes caused by the EMT program [26]. This link between the passage through EMT and the acquisition of stem-like properties is vital for cancer cells in order to metastasize. Some evidence linking RTK-RAS signaling to EMT and CSCs comes from Yoon et\u00a0al., who treated Runx3\u2212/\u2212 p53\u2212/\u2212 murine gastric epithelial cells with TGF\u03b21 to induce EMT and found an increase in the EGFR/ Ras gene expression signature [27]. The addition of EGF or the increased expression of KRAS led to increased sphere formation and colony formation in soft agar, suggesting that the EGFR/Ras pathway is involved in the promotion of EMT to generate CSCs. Finally, Min et\u00a0al. found that inhibition of KRAS activation using a MEK inhibitor inhibited dysplastic organoids derived from Mist1-KrasG12D mouse stomach corpus [28].\nThe relationship between RTK-RAS activation and CSC function has not been extensively studied in GA, but several studies of other gastrointestinal tumors have found that mutated KRAS promotes the emergence of stemness traits [29]. In colorectal cancer, Blaj et\u00a0 al. found that high MAPK activity (downstream of KRAS signalling) promoted EMT and marked a progenitor cell\nFig. 6 Expression of CD44, KRAS, and VEGFA in GA patient tumors. A Gene expression of CD44, KRAS, and VEGF\u2011A in gastric tumors compared to adjacent normal tissues. B Hierarchical clustering of gene expression in 83 patient tumors based on the log2 fold\u2011change in gene expression in tumor compared to adjacent normal tissue. Clinical information, including tumor location, Lauren classification, TNM stage, and the molecular classifications by Splicing, ACRG, and TCGA methods are indicated for the three clusters defined by CD44 expression (low, intermediate, and high). C Box plots of KRAS and VEGFA expression in each CD44 patient cluster. D Kaplan\u2013Meier overall survival curves stratified by expression of VEGF\u2011A in the FMUUH cohort\n(See figure on next page.)\nsubpopulation that served as the predominant source of growth in flank xenografts [30]. Also in colorectal cancer, Moon et\u00a0al. showed that in cells carrying mutated APC, oncogenic KRAS increases expression of CSC markers (CD44, CD133, and CD166), spheroid formation, and the size of xenografts [31]. In pancreatic CSCs, inhibition of KRAS led to downregulation of JNK signaling and loss of self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity [32]. In this study, we found that at least part of the ability of CSCs to form metastases is due to their increased expression of KRAS, which in turn promotes secretion of pro-angiogenic factors.\nThere are few studies examining the role of CSCs in promoting tumor angiogenesis or on the role of that oncogenic pathways play in this process. However, the association between KRAS and VEGF-A has been examined in some tumor types. A study of 204 patients with lung adenocarcinoma found that KRAS mutation was significantly associated with a high level of co-expression of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 [33]. Takahashi et\u00a0al. found that combining MEK1/2 inhibition and VEGF-A inhibition led to synergistic inhibitory effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model of KRAS-mutant human non-small cell lung cancer [34]. In a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Fedele et\u00a0al. found that KRAS inhibition via SHP2 inhibition inhibited tumor angiogenesis and vascularity [35]. In this study, we found that KRAS activation specifically in GA CSCs promotes expression of pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF-A, and that targeting both KRAS and VEGF-A in CSCs results in more-than-additive effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis.\nThe cancer stem cell theory proposes that CSCs play a key role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. KRAS activation has been shown to contribute to the development and maintenance of CSCs in various tumor types, including gastric cancer. Additionally, VEGF-A has been implicated in the regulation of CSC self-renewal, differentiation, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, there is rationale to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between KRAS activation, VEGF-A expression, and CSCs. One study by Sennino B et\u00a0al. found that inhibition of VEGF signaling by neutralizing antibodies or small molecule inhibitors significantly suppressed the growth of human pancreatic tumors with activating mutations in KRAS [36]. Another study by Majeti BK et\u00a0 al. showed that conditional deletion of VEGF in mouse models of KRAS-driven lung cancer significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival [37]. This study also showed that overexpression of VEGF in the lung epithelium of mice with KRAS mutations enhanced tumor growth and metastasis. These studies suggest that VEGF is indeed required for\ntumor progression driven by activated KRAS. One possible mechanism could involve the activation of downstream effectors of KRAS, such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which have been shown to regulate VEGF-A expression and angiogenesis [38]. Furthermore, the expression of various transcription factors, including HIF-1\u03b1 and STAT3, may be regulated by KRAS and contribute to the transcriptional activation of VEGF-A [39]. In addition, other molecules such as miRNAs and exosomes, which have been implicated in the regulation of CSCs and angiogenesis, may also play a role in this mechanism. To further investigate the mechanistic link between KRAS activation, VEGF-A expression, and CSC behavior, future studies could focus on the identification of specific downstream effectors, transcription factors, and other molecules involved in this pathway. Additionally, the use of genetic and pharmacological approaches to modulate the activity of these molecules could provide insights into their functional roles in regulating CSC behavior and angiogenesis. Overall, understanding the mechanistic link between these pathways could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs and angiogenesis in cancer.\nTo determine the translational relevance of the findings in this study to GA patients, we evaluated expression of the CSC marker CD44 and VEGF-A as prognostic factors for overall survival in a cohort of patients undergoing curative-intent gastrectomy for GA. CD44 and VEGF-A expression independently predicted worse overall survival. Our finding that patients with increased tumor levels of CD44 and VEGF-A expression had significantly worse overall survival after resection of their tumors suggests that this may be a subgroup in which combined KRAS inhibition and VEGF-A inhibition would be most beneficial.\nBecause RAS GTPases including KRAS have historically been difficult to target directly with drugs because of structure\u2013function considerations [40], we inhibited the KRAS pathway using a MEK inhibitor. Several MEK inhibitors including trametinib, cobimetinib, and binimetinib are currently FDA-approved for use in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma [41]. The MEK inhibitor used in this study, PD0325901, is currently being studied in clinical trials for patients with various solid tumors. There have been significant recent advances in the development of direct inhibitors of KRAS [42]. Sotorasib was developed as a direct inhibitor of KRASG12C (a common KRAS mutation). In a phase I trial of 59 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 42 with colorectal cancer, and 28 with other solid tumors, sotorasib appeared to be well tolerated, with 11.6% of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity [43]. Of the NSCLC patients, 32.2% had an objective response, with a total of\n88.1% having disease control (objective response or stable disease). The median progression free survival (PFS) was 6.3months. In the colorectal cohort, 7.1% had a confirmed response with 73.8% having disease control, and a median PFS of 4months. Adagrasib is another potent, highly selective inhibitor of KRASG12C. In a phase I/II study of 116 patients with pretreated NSCLC, the overall response rate to Adagrasib was 42.9%, disease control rate (DCR) was 79.5%, and median PFS was 6.5months (Spira et\u00a0 al. 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting). RMC-6236, developed by Revolution Medicine, directly targets multiple KRAS mutations at codon 12 and is currently being investigated in a phase I trial (Singh M et al. 2022 AACR Annual Meeting). Given that these agents that directly target oncogenic KRAS have few side effects, a combination strategy against oncogenic KRAS and VEGF-A as used in this study seems feasible in GA patients.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the importance of KRAS in GA CSCs in terms of promoting angiogenesis and metastasis and to demonstrate that inhibition of KRAS and VEGF-A may be an effective combination strategy. Studies were performed using human and mouse GA cell lines, in a genetically engineered, orthotopic implant, and two experimental metastasis mouse models. The relevance of these studies were confirmed by RNA protein analyses of patient tumors. These studies provide rationale for studying inhibitors of KRAS and VEGF-A in GA to block angiogenesis and metastasis.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12885\u2011 023\u2011 11170\u20110.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplemental Figure S1.
