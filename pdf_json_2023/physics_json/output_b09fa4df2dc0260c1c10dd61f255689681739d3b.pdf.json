    "abstractText": "Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) have attracted attention from several fields due to their high industrial applicability. In the present study, rhizosphere strain CJ11T was isolated from the root of Glycine max L. in Goyang-si, Republic of Korea, and a novel exopolysaccharide was purified from the Lysobacter sp. CJ11T fermentation broth. The exopolysaccharide\u2019s average molecular weight was 0.93 \u00d7 105 Da. Its monosaccharide composition included 72.2% mannose, 17.2% glucose, 7.8% galactose, and 2.8% arabinose. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy identified the exopolysaccharide carbohydrate polymer functional groups, and the structural properties were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition, a microstructure of lyophilized EPS was determined by scanning electron microscopy. Using thermogravimetric analysis, the degradation of the exopolysaccharide produced by strain CJ11T was determined to be 210 \u25e6C. The exopolysaccharide at a concentration of 4 mg/mL exhibited 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free-radical-scavenging activity of 73.47%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing results revealed that strain CJ11T was a novel isolate for which the name Lysobacter soyae sp. nov is proposed.",

            "text": "Soil is a repository of various microorganisms, and soil microorganisms inhabiting it are very important to humans because they also affect air quality [1]. Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are biological polymers secreted by microorganisms to cope with harsh environmental conditions such as antibiotics, pH, osmotic stress, and host immune defenses [2\u20134]. Naturally occurring biopolymers are produced by living organisms and the like [5]. Polysaccharides are considered natural polymers because they are complex polymers composed of monosaccharide chains linked by glycosidic bonds and are considered nontoxic, with good biocompatibility [6,7]. EPSs produced by microorganisms are polymer materials widely used in various industries [8\u201310]. The biopolymers produced by bacteria have different chemical properties, and some of these biopolymers have physiologically active functions [11\u201313]. Bacterial EPSs perform anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant functions [14]. Moreover, bacterial EPS production is one way to survive changes in the microenvironment, which prevents plants from drying out due to their high water-holding capacity and improves survival by avoiding the drying of bacterial cells [15]. To withstand soil drying, rhizosphere microbes employ a variety of strategies to maintain high water content using exopolysaccharides that are characterized as hygroscopic. This will help to keep the plant growing and prevent the roots from drying [16,17]. Additionally, EPS not only protects plants from drought stress, but also helps bacteria to attach to plant roots [18]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of oxygen metabolism and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis and redox balance [19]. However,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11081900 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900 2 of 20\nsince excessive ROS can cause damage to the body, including cancer, diabetes, aging, and chronic diseases, it is important to reduce the negative aspects. Finding natural antioxidants rather than chemical ones is extremely important [20,21]. Using DPPH free radicals, it was confirmed that EPS produced by strain CJ11 had free-radical-scavenging activity [22]. The genus Lysobacter, belonging to the family Lysobacteraceae within the class Lysobacterales, was first proposed by Christensen and Cook as a nonfruiting, gliding bacterium [23], and most of the species in this genus are rhizosphere, freshwater, and soil-dwelling organisms [23,24]. Lysobacter species are Gram-negative, aerobic, nonfruiting, gliding bacteria. The Lysobacter strain CJ11T isolated in this study was isolated from the roots of Glycine max L. and showed typical Lysobacter species characteristics. The genus Lysobacter consists of more than 70 species, which have potential in waste degradation and biotechnology because they can produce enzymes such as proteases, chitinases, and lipases [25\u201328]. In addition, some strains have been found to inhibit biofilm formation or produce antioxidants, biocontrol agents, and antibiotics, and they are expected to have potential in various industries [13,29,30]. Antibacterial compounds produced by Lysobacter include maltophilin, dihydromaltophilin, lysobactin, tripopeptin, phenazine, and lactivicin [30]. The potential of the Lysobacter species for protection against plant pathogenicity has been asserted in some studies [31,32]. In this study, the EPS produced by the Lysobacter species isolated from the rhizosphere of beans in the Republic of Korea was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, bio-liquid chromatography (Bio-LC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Furthermore, the EPS showed DPPH-scavenging ability, thus displaying potential antioxidant capability. Moreover, on the basis of phylogenetic and polyphasic analyses, the isolated Lysobacter species is proposed as a novel species in the genus Lysobacter. Among the strains isolated from the rhizome (soybean field) in Ilsan, Korea, strains that were confirmed to produce EPS and exhibited DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity were selected. Accordingly, CJ11T, a rhizosphere strain, was proposed as a novel species in the genus Lysobacter through phylogenetic and polyphasic analysis.

            "text": "A novel bacterial strain, designated CJ11T, was isolated from the root of Glycine max L. in Goyang-si, Republic of Korea (Figure S1; 37\u25e640\u203232.0\u2032\u2032 N, 126\u25e648\u203219.7\u2032\u2032 E). To purify this novel strain, a standard dilution method was employed, as described previously, using Reasoner\u2019s 2A agar (R2A; MB cell, Seoul, Republic of Korea) plates [33]. One hundred microliter aliquots of the aforementioned sample suspensions were spread onto R2A plates supplemented with 1% glucose (w/v) and subsequently incubated at 30 \u25e6C for 3 days. The purification procedure was repeated four times. Lysobacter tolerans UM1T and Lysobacter silvestris AM20-91T were obtained from The Leibniz Institute DSMZ German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures GmbH (DSMZ; Braunschweig-S\u00fcd, Germany). The selected CJ11T strain and reference strains were stored in 25% glycerol (w/v) at \u221280 \u25e6C. All strains used in taxonomic experiments were cultured on R2A agar plates or in R2A broth at 30 \u25e6C for 72 h. The isolated CJ11T strain was deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC, Jeonju, Republic of Korea) and the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE) Biological Resource Center (NBRC, Shibuya-ku, Japan) (CJ11T = KACC 21716T = NBRC 114478T). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CJ11T was amplified using universal bacterial primer sets 27F, 518F, 805R, and 1492R, and sequencing was performed by SolGent Co., Ltd. (Daejeon, Republic of Korea) [34]. The nearly complete sequence of the 16S rRNA genes (1469 bp) was assembled using the SeqMan 2 software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA), and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1547 bp) were extracted from the genome using Basic Rapid Ribosomal RNA Predictor (Barrnap) (0.9-dev) (https://github. com/tseemaan/barrnap (accessed on 13 September 2022)); both yielded identical results.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900 3 of 20\nIn order to compare the complete sequence of 16S rRNA genes with those of the other taxa, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the EzBioCloud.net (https://www.ezbiocloud.net/ (accessed on 4 August 2022)) databases were searched [35,36]. Multiple sequences were aligned using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 11 software and analyzed using CLUSTAL W [37,38]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed according to the neighborjoining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods employing the Kimura two-parameter model [39]. The min-mini heuristic algorithm was applied to the maximum-parsimony (MP) method to compare the phylogenetic trees that were constructed using the neighborjoining method [40]. MEGA 11 software was used to not only construct neighbor-joining trees to estimate the confidence of tree topologies, but also construct phylogenetic trees using bootstrap analyses with 1000 replications [41]. The Gram staining reaction for the strain was performed using a previously described method [42]. To identify the morphology of strain CJ11T, cells that were grown in R2A agar at 30 \u25e6C for 3 days were negatively stained using 3% uranyl acetate and observed under a transmission electron microscope (TEM; Libra 120; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The growth of strain CJ11T was examined on R2A, marine agar (MA; MB cell), nutrient agar (NA; Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), Luria\u2013Bertani agar (LB; Difco), and tryptic soy agar (TSA; Difco) media at 30 \u25e6C for 10 days to identify the optimal medium. The growth of strain CJ11T was assessed at temperatures of 2, 4, 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, 37, 40, and 42 \u25e6C on R2A and MA for 10 days. In addition, NaCl tolerance was tested by culturing the strains in R2A broth containing various NaCl concentrations ranging from 0% to 8% (with intervals of 1%) for 10 days. The optimal pH for growth was determined by culturing the cells in R2A broth made using four different buffers with pH levels ranging from 5.0 to 11.0 (with 1 unit pH intervals) and subsequently incubating these cultures at 30 \u25e6C for 10 days. The pH level was modulated using the following filter sterilized buffers at a final concentration of 50 mM: acetate buffer (pH 5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0\u20138.0), Tris buffer (pH 9.0\u201310.0), and Na2HPO4/NaOH buffer (pH 11.0). A GasPak jar (BBL, Cockeysville, MD, USA) was used to assess bacterial growth under anaerobic conditions on R2A plates at 30 \u25e6C for 10 days. An oxygen absorber strip (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was used and continuously monitored to remove oxygen in the anaerobic chamber. Catalase activity was observed by detecting oxygen bubble production using a 3% (v/v) aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, and oxidase activity was observed through the oxidation of 1% (w/v) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (BioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC, USA). Motility was observed by employing a 0.4% agar stabbing technique (tube method), and gliding motility was tested using the hanging-drop technique [43]. Hydrolysis of DNA (DNase agar; MB cell), CM-cellulose (2%; Duksan, Seoul, Republic of Korea), and casein (2% skim milk powder; Biopure, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was tested on R2A, as described previously [44]. The presence of flexirubin-type pigments was investigated using a 20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (w/v) [45]. Biochemical and enzymatic tests were performed using the API 20NE kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (BioM\u00e9rieux). CJ11T cells grown on R2A plates at 30 \u25e6C for 3 days were used to analyze quinone and polar lipid contents. The polar lipid extracts were separated via two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) by employing two different development solvents, with a chloroform\u2013 methanol\u2013water ratio of 65:25:4 (v/v/v) and a chloroform\u2013acetic acid\u2013methanol\u2013water ratio of 80:15:12:4 (v/v/v/v). The results were visualized by spraying with Zinzadze\u2019s reagent (molybdenum blue spray reagent, 1.3%; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to detect phospholipids, molybdophosphoric acid (phosphomolybdic acid reagent, 5% v/v solution in ethanol; Sigma, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan) to detect total lipids, \u03b1-naphthol reagent to detect glycolipids, and ninhydrin reagent (0.2% solution; Sigma) to detect amino lipids [46]. Isoprenoid quinones were extracted using chloroform and methanol at a ratio of 2:1 (v/v) and were analyzed using high-performance lipid chromatography by following a previously published method [47,48].\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900 4 of 20"

The reads were assembled using the SPAdes ver. 3.14.1 de novo assembler [49]. The bioinformatics tool CheckM was used to analyze the completeness and contamination of strain CJ11T [50]. A phylogenomic tree was constructed using an up-todate bacterial core gene set (UBCG) and whole-genome sequences of the closely related genera were obtained from the EzBioCloud Whole-Genome database [51]. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were achieved using the e-service of EzBioCloud [52]. The ANI between the novel strain and its close relatives was calculated using KBase wrapper for Fast ANI (https://github.com/ParBLiSS/FastANI (26 April 2023)) [53,54].

The eight major parts of the COG categories were as follows: S (function unknown; 23.8%), K (transcription, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; 7.9%), M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; 7.3%), E (amino-acid transport and metabolism; 6.5%), C (energy production and conversion; 6.0%), L (replication, recombination, and repair; 5.9%), O (post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones; 5.6%), and T (signal transduction mechanisms; 5.1%). The overall comparative analysis of strain CJ11T and its phylogenetically related neighbors are shown in Figure S4. A total of 1467 orthologous genes were shared among all three compared species (strain CJ11T, L. tolerans UM1T, and L. silvestris AM20-91T), of which 130 orthologous genes were shared only between strains CJ11T and L. silvestris AM20-91T, and 86 orthologous genes were shared between strains CJ11T and L. tolerans UM1T (Figure 3). To compare the metabolic abilities between CJ11T and two phylogenetically related Lysobacter species, the Refined Annotation of Metabolism function of the Distilled and KBase platforms was used. The DRAM tool provided a metabolic profile for each genome (Figure 4). The metagenomeassembled genome (MAG) of strain CJ11T showed that its genes were involved in glycolysis (Embden\u2013Meyerhof pathway), the pentose phosphate pathway (pentose phosphate cycle), reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle), reductive citrate cycle (Arnon\u2013Buchanan cycle), dicarboxylate\u2013hydroxybutyrate cycle, and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood\u2013 Ljungdahl pathway). In addition, glycolysis, the phosphate pathway, citrate cycle (TCA cycle or Krebs cycle), glyoxylate cycle, reductive Acetyl-CoA pathway, reducing pentose phosphate cycle, dicarboxyl ate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and reducing citrate cycle were found in all MAGs. The carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were examined in MAGs, and it was confirmed that all three strains (strain CJ11T, L. tolerans UM1T, and L. silvestris AM20-91T) lacked genes related to carbohydrate decomposition, such as xylan and chitin (Figure S5). Bacterial alcohol production is known to be commonly used in the production of alcoholic beverages and can be used as an important renewable energy source in the production of biofuels such as ethanol. However, this study does not suggest that strain CJ11T fulfills the aforementioned roles.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900 9 of 20\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 21\nknown to be commonly used in the production of alcoholic beverages and can be used as an important renewable energy source in the production of biofuels such as ethanol.

Bacterial Growth and EPS Production Kinetics Growth and fermentation kinetics are required for cultivating strain CJ11T and determining the maximum EPS yield. When the novel strain CJ11T was inoculated into a fresh sterile medium containing 1% (w/v) galactose, mannose, and glucose, it showed rapid cell growth for 24 to 48 h in a medium with mannose and galactose. The medium with glucose showed rapid cell growth between 48 and 60 h (Figure 5a). The logarithmic phase was confirmed between 48 and 72 h in the liquid medium supplemented with 1% glucose, and the stationary phase was shown for about 72 h after approximately 72 h. In addition, we elucidated the cell cycle of strain CJ11T and identified the step-by-step fermentation kinetics of EPS production. The lyophilization of the EPS showed the highest yield in the medium supplemented with 1% glucose (Figure 5b). The bacterial growth curves over time for 0\u20137 days showed a classical pattern, and the EPS yields were generated faster in the medium supplemented with galactose and mannose within 96 h. However, after 96 h, the medium supplemented with glucose showed a higher yield than the medium supplemented with galactose and mannose, and at 144 h, the maximum yield was 1.2 g/L, which was confirmed to be higher than the EPS yield of the previously studied strains of the genus Lysobacter [13]."

Chemical Analysis, Average Mw, and Monosaccharide Composition of EPS The Lowry assay and bovine serum albumin (BSA) method of protein determination indicated that EPS contains 1.2% (w/w) protein content. The percentage of the carbohydrate content in lyophilized EPS was 83.8% (w/w). The protein content of the EPS produced by the novel strain, Lysobacter soyae CJ11T, was lower than that of Lysobacter sp. MMG2 [13]. As a result of measuring the average molecular weight of EPS produced by the new strain CJ11, it was confirmed to be 0.93 \u00d7 105 Da (Figure S6). Although similar to the EPS and average molecular weight of previously published Lysobacter species, it was confirmed that the average molecular weight of the EPS produced by our strain was slightly lower [13]. Meanwhile, it was confirmed that the molecular weight was lower than that of Bacillus haynesii CamB6 [10]. Mw is a parameter that affects the functional properties of a exopolysaccharide and can vary depending on the nature of the starting material, the extraction temperature of the exopolysaccharide, and the fractionation method used [75,76]. The EPS was hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoracetic acid, and monosaccharide composition was confirmed by Bio-LC analysis. In the acid-hydrolyzed EPS, four peaks were observed: mannose (29.53 min), glucose (24.04 min), galactose (20.93 min), and arabinose (19.56 min). Among them, mannose (72.2%) accounted for the overwhelming majority, followed by glucose (17.2%), galactose (7.8%), and arabinose (2.8%; Figure S7). Arabinose, on the other hand, is not a sugar commonly found in EPS produced by bacteria [77]. Previous studies have shown that arabinose partially inhibits sucrase activity and lowers the insulin peak [78]. Therefore, EPS containing arabinose may be useful. However, in this study, the characteristics of arabinose as an EPS composition of strain CJ11T were not studied.\n3.5.

The surface structure of the EPS produced by CJ11T was observed at 10,000\u00d7 and 30,000\u00d7. The surface morphology of the EPS, observed by SEM, was rough, irregular, and bumpy (Figure 6a,b). EPSs (white arrow) were observed on the surface of CJ11T cells grown on R2A agar plates supplemented with 1% glucose. In contrast, the EPS layer was hardly observable on the surfaces of cells grown on R2A medium not supplemented with a carbon source, and the cells appeared rod-shaped (Figure 6c,d).\nFigure 5.

FTIR analysis was applied to confirm the presence of functional groups in EPS (Figure 7). A hydroxyl expansion vibration of the polysaccharide band was observed at 3281 cm\u22121 of the FTIR peak of the CJ11T EPS [79], thus suggesting that this polymer is EPS. The peak observed around 2933 cm\u22121 in the spectrum corresponding to the methyl group was due to the C\u2013H stretching vibration [80]. A 1631 cm\u22121 peak was found predicting the presence of a C=O group, which showed similar results in our previous study [81]. A peak corresponding to the N\u2013H vibration of the amine group (peptide or proteins) was observed at 1540 cm\u22121 [82]. The peaks appearing around 1412 cm\u22121 and 1223 cm\u22121 were presumed to be COO\u2212 vibrations and O\u2013S\u2013O groups, which are evidence of sulfuric acid esters, respectively [83]. The signal representing the stretching vibration of C\u2013O and the changing angle vibration of O\u2013H appeared around 1048 cm\u22121 [84]. The absorption band at 1048 cm\u22121, which is in the range of 1000\u20131200 cm\u22121, corresponded to the presence of carbohydrates [85]. The peak near 915 cm\u22121 was suggested to be pyranose [86].

The XRD result is an indication that the EPS is in an amorphous state, and the EPS pattern shows a similar result to the EPS produced by Lysobacter sp. MMG2 [13]. The XRD pattern is a frequently used tool for confirming the crystallization and properties of materials, and crystallization analysis is important because it greatly reflects the thermal properties of materials and affects their temperature [87]. The thermal stability of EPS is important in industrial applications where sterilization is required, such as food processing and manufacturing [88]. Looking at the TGA analysis results in Figure 8b, the descending line (a) represents the weight loss of the EPS generated during the heating process, and the blue line \u201c(b)\u201d represents the heat flux (mW). The first mass loss occurred between 28 and 92.7 \u00b0C. This first weight loss was primarily due to gelatinization and swelling associated with water loss [89]. A weight loss of 8.08% at 210 \u00b0C indicated the onset of energy release associated with a maximum exothermic peak. At roughly 300 \u00b0C, the weight of the EPS dropped dramatically, with a mass loss of 29.9%.\nFigure 7.

API ZYM strips gave negative results for lipase (C14), esterase (C4), cystine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, trypsin, \u03b1chymotrypsin, \u03b1-galactosidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, \u03b1-mannosidase, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b2-glucuronidase, and \u03b2-galactosidase, but positive results for the production of alkaline phosphatase, esterase lipase (C8), acid phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, and naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase. The type strain of Lysobacter soyae is CJ11T (type strain CJ11T = KACC 21716T = NBRC 114478T), which was isolated from the roots of Glycine max L. at Dongguk university, Goyang-si, Republic of Korea. The G + C content of the genomic DNA is 59.2 mol.%. The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ/PIR accession numbers of the 16S rRNA gene sequences and the whole-genome sequences of Lysobacter soyae CJ11T are MN915129 and CP080544, respectively."

            "text": "In this study, EPSs were extracted, isolated, and purified from the fermentation broth of the novel strain L. soyae CJ11T supplemented with glucose. EPS produced by a novel strain was composed of mannose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose, of which mannose was the most dominant, and the average molecular weight of EPS was 0.93 \u00d7 105 Da. Through 13C-NMR spectral analysis at \u03b4 95.576 ppm, we found a signal of one anomeric region. In addition, one anomeric region was also detected on the basis of 1H-NMR spectral analysis at \u03b4 4.79 ppm. SEM showed a rough, irregular, and bumpy structured surface\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 1900 16 of 20\nmorphology. In addition, EPS was additionally characterized by FTIR and XRD. Functional characterization of EPS was also performed, showing DPPH radical-scavenging activity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating potential as a natural antioxidant and high thermal stability. To our knowledge, no previous studies have reported the properties of EPS produced by Lysobacter isolated from Glycine max. Thus, this study demonstrates the theoretical knowledge and potential that the EPS produced by the critical strain CJ11T could benefit several industries. On the basis of our results, we proposed that CJ11T could be a novel Lyobacter species, which we named Lysobacter soyae sp. nov. and designated as CJ11T.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11081900/s1: Figure S1.
