    "abstractText": "Background: Patient simulators are an increasingly important part of medical training. They have been shown to be effective in teaching procedural skills, medical knowledge, and clinical decision-making. Recently, virtual and augmented reality simulators are being produced, but there is no research on whether these more realistic experiences cause problematic and greater stress responses as compared to standard manikin simulators. Objective: The purpose of this research is to examine the psychological and physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) in medical simulation training as compared to traditional manikin simulations. Methods: A within-subjects experimental design was used to assess the responses of medical students (N=89) as they completed simulated (using either manikin or AR) pediatric resuscitations. Baseline measures of psychological well-being, salivary cortisol, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were taken before the simulations began. Continuous GSR assessments throughout and after the simulations were captured along with follow-up measures of emotion and cortisol. Participants also wrote freely about their experience with each simulation, and narratives were coded for emotional word use. Results: Of the total 86 medical students who participated, 37 (43%) were male and 49 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 25.2 (SD 2.09, range 22-30) years and 24.7 (SD 2.08, range 23-36) years, respectively. GSR was higher in the manikin group adjusted for day, sex, and medications taken by the participants (AR-manikin: \u20130.11, 95% CI \u20130.18 to \u20130.03; P=.009). The difference in negative affect between simulation types was not statistically significant (AR-manikin: 0.41, 95% CI \u20130.72 to 1.53; P=.48). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in self-reported stress (AR-manikin: 0.53, 95% CI \u20132.35 to 3.42; P=.71) or simulation stress (AR-manikin: \u20132.17, 95% CI \u20136.94 to 2.59; P=.37). The difference in percentage of positive emotion words used to describe the experience was not statistically significant between simulation types, which were adjusted for day of experiment, sex of the participants, and total number of words used (AR-manikin: \u20134.0, 95% CI \u20130.91 to 0.10; P=.12). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in terms of the percentage of negative emotion words used to describe the experience (AR-manikin: \u20130.33, 95% CI \u20131.12 to 0.46; P=.41), simulation sickness (AR-manikin: 0.17, 95% CI \u20130.29 to 0.62; P=.47), or salivary cortisol (AR-manikin: 0.04, 95% CI \u20130.05 to 0.13; P=.41). Finally, preexisting levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, perceived stress, and reported depression were not tied to physiological responses to AR. Conclusions: AR simulators elicited similar stress responses to currently used manikin-based simulators, and we did not find any evidence of AR simulators causing excessive stress to participants. Therefore, AR simulators are a promising tool to be used in medical training, which can provide more emotionally realistic scenarios without the risk of additional harm.

            "text": "Background: Patient simulators are an increasingly important part of medical training. They have been shown to be effective in teaching procedural skills, medical knowledge, and clinical decision-making. Recently, virtual and augmented reality simulators are being produced, but there is no research on whether these more realistic experiences cause problematic and greater stress responses as compared to standard manikin simulators.\nObjective: The purpose of this research is to examine the psychological and physiological effects of augmented reality (AR) in medical simulation training as compared to traditional manikin simulations.\nMethods: A within-subjects experimental design was used to assess the responses of medical students (N=89) as they completed simulated (using either manikin or AR) pediatric resuscitations. Baseline measures of psychological well-being, salivary cortisol, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were taken before the simulations began. Continuous GSR assessments throughout and after the simulations were captured along with follow-up measures of emotion and cortisol. Participants also wrote freely about their experience with each simulation, and narratives were coded for emotional word use.\nResults: Of the total 86 medical students who participated, 37 (43%) were male and 49 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 25.2 (SD 2.09, range 22-30) years and 24.7 (SD 2.08, range 23-36) years, respectively. GSR was higher in the manikin group adjusted for day, sex, and medications taken by the participants (AR-manikin: \u20130.11, 95% CI \u20130.18 to \u20130.03; P=.009). The difference in negative affect between simulation types was not statistically significant (AR-manikin: 0.41, 95% CI \u20130.72 to 1.53; P=.48). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in self-reported stress (AR-manikin: 0.53, 95% CI \u20132.35 to 3.42; P=.71) or simulation stress (AR-manikin: \u20132.17, 95% CI \u20136.94 to 2.59; P=.37). The difference in percentage of positive emotion words used to describe the experience was not statistically significant between simulation types, which were adjusted for day of experiment, sex of the participants, and total number of words used (AR-manikin: \u20134.0, 95% CI \u20130.91 to 0.10; P=.12). There was no statistically significant difference between simulation types in terms of the percentage of negative emotion words used to describe the experience (AR-manikin: \u20130.33, 95% CI \u20131.12 to 0.46; P=.41), simulation sickness (AR-manikin: 0.17, 95% CI \u20130.29 to 0.62; P=.47), or salivary cortisol (AR-manikin: 0.04, 95% CI \u20130.05 to 0.13; P=.41). Finally, preexisting levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, perceived stress, and reported depression were not tied to physiological responses to AR.\nConclusions: AR simulators elicited similar stress responses to currently used manikin-based simulators, and we did not find any evidence of AR simulators causing excessive stress to participants. Therefore, AR simulators are a promising tool to be used in medical training, which can provide more emotionally realistic scenarios without the risk of additional harm.\nJMIR Med Educ 2022 | vol. 8 | iss. 3 | e36447 | p. 1https://mededu.jmir.org/2022/3/e36447 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\n(JMIR Med Educ 2022;8(3):e36447) doi: 10.2196/36447"

            "text": "Patient simulators have demonstrated improved learning outcomes in medical training [1-4]. Consequently, over the past decade, the use of simulators has become an increasingly important and prominent part of medical training. These include mechanical manikins (ie, Laerdal SimMan) and the \u201cbuddy\u201d system in which a fellow student pretends to be a patient. High-fidelity simulation has been defined as \u201can opportunity to interact within a realistic clinical environment able to reproduce a wide range of clinical conditions\u201d [5]. The Laerdal SimMan varies by model but is capable of showing respiration, seizures, pupillary changes, auscultatable breath sounds and heart sounds, as well as palpable pulses. However, there is no literature on how realistic these methods are and whether they provoke a realistic emotional response comparable to true emergency medical scenarios in trainees. As such, they may not adequately support the development of critical decision-making behaviors in highly emotional contexts.\nTo address this lack of realistic emotional context, there has been movement toward using augmented reality (AR) approaches that may substantially improve realism. AR simulation has been increasingly used in medical education over the last decade [6-8]. Most studies regarding AR in medical education focus on the development and initial evaluation of utility and feasibility, particularly in surgical and anatomical education [9-12]. The MedCognition AR system, PerSim, is an augmented reality program used for this study. It uses a HoloLens (Microsoft Corp) headset showing the user a virtual patient who can display various physical exam findings and vitals that are subsequently adjusted by the instructor. Physical exam findings that can be shown include seizures, diaphoresis, retractions, respiratory distress, level of consciousness, and cyanosis, which are not well shown on standard mechanical manikins. HoloLens has been previously shown to be effective in teaching medical students [13].\nProblematic here is that it is not known if this increased realism evokes a substantially different stress response in learners than traditional simulation modalities. While a small amount of stress can aid learning outcomes [14], excessive stress could be harmful to the health and well-being of medical trainees. This may be particularly problematic for individuals with certain preexisting psychological traits (eg, psychological disorder and past stressful experiences) that may predispose them to more adverse reactions during training simulation scenarios. There are no existing studies evaluating the psychological or physiological stress response that AR may evoke in learners when used for medical education simulations, and thus, there is a need for systematic evaluation of the educational and safety features of these AR simulations.\nThere are a variety of ways to assess the physical impact of AR as compared to past manikin approaches. Responses to acute\nstress, physiologically, are most typically mapped by either the sympathetic response (a general physiological fight-or-flight change that prepares the body for action) or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, which directs a range of hormonal and immune changes in the body [15]. While acute changes are considered adaptive in the face of stress, especially when recovery is swift, at high or prolonged elevated levels, dysfunctions in these systems can lead to health problems. In human studies, HPA axis activity is most typically gauged by salivary cortisol levels, long considered a gold standard marker of acute stress [16]. Similarly, markers of sympathetic activity (eg, galvanic skin responses [GSR]) [17] in response to stressful stimulation have long been considered biomarkers of stress, cognitive load, and attention [18-20].\nFrom the psychological perspective, there are a host of approaches that can assess how AR fares in terms of altering the well-being of those using it. Most obviously, researchers studying acute stressors focus on self-reported measures of acute stress, but also emotional changes such as an increase in negative emotions (eg, fear, anxiety, and sadness) and a decrease in positive emotions (eg, calm and happiness). While some studies have found well-being benefits from the use of certain AR games, the concern is that the negative emotional impact could be severe in medical simulations that depict realistic illness and even death [21,22]. Therefore, we conjectured that assessing both physical and psychological responses to the simulations, as well as less obvious self-report approaches (eg, approaches that detect emotion without overtly asking), is key given the possibility that demand characteristics may alter the ability to identify changes in well-being (eg, medical students may feel uncomfortable admitting feelings of depression or stress, especially in the presence of other students and instructors). This echoes previous calls for multimethod approaches in well-being research [23].\nOne final important consideration of using emotionally realistic depictions of a traumatic event in AR is the possibility that preexisting psychological experiences may make the simulation more damaging. For example, do individuals coming into a simulation with a history of trauma or depression face potentially aversive psychological or physiological responses, and should these preexisting characteristics be considered risk factors for the use of AR? Past research has not examined this question specifically; however, research has clearly shown that past trauma can be a risk factor for numerous future health and stress concerns [24], and the same can be said for past major stressors and other psychological traits that can similarly predict future disorder [25]. This is thought to be due to individuals with risks such as past traumas resulting in excess stress responses (eg, HPA axis and sympathoadrenal responses), thereby increasing vulnerability to stress-related disease and depression [26-28]. Thus, it is important that with this new approach to teaching, we examine whether certain individuals have excessive stress responses that could be an early indicator of future problems.\nJMIR Med Educ 2022 | vol. 8 | iss. 3 | e36447 | p. 2https://mededu.jmir.org/2022/3/e36447 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nIn this study, we hypothesized that the higher-fidelity, more realistic AR simulation would more successfully elicit emotional stress compared to a standard manikin simulator. Specifically, we predicted that the AR simulation would be associated with higher levels of negative emotion and self-rated stress, and lower levels of positive emotion as compared to the manikin simulation. Similarly, we hypothesized that the AR simulation would be tied to higher changes in both GSR and salivary cortisol. Finally, we predicted that preexisting psychological traits would not significantly influence the psychological and physiological responses to the simulation."

Participants had all previously been trained on basic operational procedure for the HoloLens headsets, which provided the hardware for the AR simulation. Before participating in the study sessions, the participants were consented and completed a baseline questionnaire from home, which assessed health behaviors, trait\naffect, and demographic characteristics relevant to controls. Upon arrival on each study day, the participants were instructed as to what to expect (without disclosing the nature of the simulation), outfitted with an ambulatory wrist or hand GSR monitor and provided a resting salivary cortisol sample. Within each study session, students completed 1 of 2 scenarios centered on pediatric resuscitation and subsequent death of the patient: 1 status asthmaticus and 1 pediatric sepsis, both with unstable vital signs requiring acute resuscitation, who ultimately succumbed to their illness regardless of learner actions. These cases were integrated into the medical student curriculum with the objective of covering personal emotional stressors in work and difficult conversations; however, they also allowed maximum specific psychological effects. Scenarios lasted approximately 10 minutes each.\nElectrodermal activity was continuously assessed via wrist monitor before, during, and after the scenario to establish baseline, task (stress reactivity), and recovery periods. Additionally, salivary cortisol samples were collected to align with times before, immediately following, and 15 minutes after each simulation. Psychological data (eg, stress and emotion) were collected through surveys administered before and immediately following each simulation session. The postsimulation survey additionally included qualitative debriefing questions related to the passing of the participant and the medical knowledge of the participant."

Timepoints were (1) baseline (before simulation), (2) reactivity (during simulation), and (3) recovery (15 minutes after simulation). Experimental sessions were scheduled between 12 PM and 5 PM to account for the diurnal rhythm of cortisol. Salivettes were stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until batch analysis at the end of data collection at the laboratory of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research (University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA).

            "text": "This finding is consistent with previous studies, which showed that simulation in medical education can elicit a stress response [41-43] as well as a range of emotional and cognitive changes. As these studies suggest, small stress increases are tied to better learning outcomes, which in turn suggests that both modalities of simulation can have a beneficial effect for learners; however, future studies will need to evaluate the actual learning outcomes. Of note, there was some concern that AR might be associated with a dangerously high level of stress because of the added realism and interactive nature; however, it does not seem to be any more stressful than past medical training approaches (ie, manikin here), adding some indication that dangerous levels of stress are not a concern, at least in this simulation. Further subanalysis examining preexisting trauma, perceived stress, and depression did not show statistically significant differences in stress with AR simulation, suggesting that even those with preexisting psychological conditions may not need to be excluded from AR technology in this type of context. Further, stress and negative emotion reported in these simulations do not appear to be at levels that are different compared to other study averages [44-46].\nFrom the physiological stress perspective, this study shows no significant differences between AR and standard manikin simulation technology, except a small difference where the increase in skin conductance in response to the manikin simulator was significantly higher than that of AR\u2014the opposite\nJMIR Med Educ 2022 | vol. 8 | iss. 3 | e36447 | p. 6https://mededu.jmir.org/2022/3/e36447 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nof what was anticipated. Cortisol differences, however, were not different across the 2 platforms. This suggests that, contrary to expectations, and despite heightened realism and more animated interactions, the AR approach is psychologically and physically comparable to standard manikin-based simulators, and it is perhaps even slightly less physiologically stressful than past learning modalities.\nGiven the nature of the simulations involving pediatric deaths, it is not surprising that the overall stress increased during and after each simulation. However, students showed decreased stress levels in their second simulation. Previous studies have shown that stress factors in simulation-based training may help with the acquisition of stress management skills [41]. In addition to stress management skills, it could suggest a desensitization to the simulation regardless of type of simulator. Chang et al [47] suggested that VR simulation could be used to desensitize pediatric physicians from stressful situations based on their study evaluating VR stress response and real-life situations. However, Hardernberg et al [48] showed no decreased stress response in nursing students with repeated simulations, which is contradicted with our results. Decreasing levels of stress response could be very useful for educational purposes and future training for many types of medical practitioners who experience high-stress situations."

While we attempted to look at multiple evaluators of emotional stress (cortisol, self-reported stress, and electrodermal activity), these still may not have fully captured the stress response of the students. Some students had higher levels of sweat on their palms making GSR data less reliable, as the sensors were more difficult to maintain on their hands. Finally, while we controlled for numerous possible confounders of our biological markers (eg, medication, time of day, and sex), there may be other factors unaccounted for, which may have resulted in bias or noise in the data."

AR technology is relatively new and its ability to elicit a stress response when compared to standard manikin simulation technology could help guide future educational practices and research."
