    "abstractText": "Transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in mediating the plant response to various abiotic stresses, particularly heat stress. Plants respond to elevated temperatures by modulating the expression of genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways, a regulatory process primarily governed by multiple TFs in a networked configuration. Many TFs, such as WRKY, MYB, NAC, bZIP, zinc finger protein, AP2/ERF, DREB, ERF, bHLH, and brassinosteroids, are associated with heat shock factor (Hsf) families, and are involved in heat stress tolerance. These TFs hold the potential to control multiple genes, which makes them ideal targets for enhancing the heat stress tolerance of crop plants. Despite their immense importance, only a small number of heat-stress-responsive TFs have been identified in rice. The molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of TFs in rice adaptation to heat stress still need to be researched. This study identified three TF genes, including OsbZIP14, OsMYB2, and OsHSF7, by integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic sequencing data analysis of rice in response to heat stress. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we demonstrated that OsbZIP14, one of the key heat-responsive TF genes, contained a basic-leucine zipper domain and primarily functioned as a nuclear TF with transcriptional activation capability. By knocking out the OsbZIP14 gene in the rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, we observed that the knockout mutant OsbZIP14 exhibited dwarfism with reduced tiller during the grain-filling stage. Under high-temperature treatment, it was also demonstrated that in the OsbZIP14 mutant, the expression of the OsbZIP58 gene, a key regulator of rice seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation, was upregulated. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments uncovered a direct interaction between OsbZIP14 and OsbZIP58. Our results suggested that OsbZIP14 acts as a key TF gene through the concerted action of OsbZIP58 and OsbZIP14 during rice filling under heat stress. These findings provide good candidate genes for genetic improvement of rice but also offer valuable scientific insights into the mechanism of heat tolerance stress in rice.",

            "text": "Rice is one of the world\u2019s most important food crops, and its productivity and quality are vital for global food security [1]. With global warming and the increasing frequency of hot weather, rice productivity is subjected to more extreme temperature stress than ever before [2]. In southern China, rice-producing areas are significantly impacted by heat and drought, which limit rice productivity [3]. Rice is highly sensitive to heat stress, especially during the reproductive and grain-filling stages. Heat adversely affects rice quality, such as increasing amylose, decreasing kernel weight, and increasing chalkiness [4].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5619. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24065619 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5619 2 of 17\nThe physiological deterioration of quality is mainly due to an accelerated grain-filling rate and the grain-filling period being shortened under heat-stress conditions [5\u20137]. The transcriptional regulation of genes involved in storage protein biosynthesis is crucial for rice quality under heat conditions [8,9]. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms by which plants perceive and transduce stress signals to cellular machinery to initiate adaptive transcription factors for heat stress tolerance in plants is an essential prerequisite for identifying key genes and pathways to breed heat-stress-tolerant crops [10]. Transcription factors (TFs) in plants play crucial roles in response to a range of abiotic stresses. They are continuously synthesized in plants and relay and amplify stress signals within cells. TFs can precisely interact with cis-acting elements in gene promoter regions, thereby activating or inhibiting the transcription of specific genes [11]. Furthermore, they induce changes in plant physiology and biochemistry by regulating the expression of downstream-related genes [12]. There are more than 50 known TF families in plants, which often have the characteristic of simultaneously regulating multiple stress responses due to more complex internal connection between various TFs [13]. Among them, heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), dehydration response element binding protein (DREB), multiprotein binding factor (MBF), WRKY, MYB, ERF, NAC, and basic leucine zipper (bZIP) have been involved in heat stress response [14\u201317]. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool for understanding plant gene expression and screening for stress-resistance genes [18\u201320]. However, as highthroughput sequencing technology advances, many omics technologies emerge. Any mono-omics is insufficient to explain the mechanism of plant stress response systematically, and the combination of multi-omics is an inevitable trend of future development [21]. The combination of epigenome and transcriptome analysis has attracted more and more attention. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with High-Throughput Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a widely used technique for determining chromatin accessibility throughout the genome. This method is sensitive, specific and uses fewer cells [22,23]. Due to the simple procedure and low material input, ATAC-seq has been widely used in the detection of DNA regulatory regions in plants such as Arabidopsis [24], rice [25], tomato [26], and wheat [27]. A study focused on the response of grapes to cold stress identified nine cold-responsive TFs, including CBF4, RAV1, and ERF104, by integrating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq methods [28]. Similar methods were also applied to identify nine TF genes including ATHB7, HAT5, and WRKY26 in apple that played important roles in drought resistance [29]. Therefore, the combined analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-Seq is a powerful tool in rapidly and efficiently identifying stress-responsive TFs in plants. To the best of our knowledge, only a few TF genes have been reported which play key roles in rice in response to heat stress. However, the mechanism of how different TFs respond to heat stress is still unclear. In this study, the transcriptomic and epigenomic data of rice under heat stress were used to screen the heat-responsive TF genes. Then we used different protein-protein docking tools to predict the interaction between the predicted TF gene and a target gene. Finally, we verified the interaction by using the Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) method. The results of this study provide potential heat stress tolerant candidate genes and provide scientific inspiration for understanding the heat tolerance of rice."

            "text": "To define the chromatin accessibility of rice under heat stress, ATAC-seq data analysis was performed. Signals of open chromatin were obtained by alignment, removing duplication, and peak calling. The result showed consistent peaks in both the control and treated, confirming the reproducibility of the ATAC-seq libraries used in this study (Figure S1). Structural annotation of the peaks showed that the ratio of ATAC signal transposase hypersensitive sites (THSs) present in the promoter region (0\u20133 kb upstream of transcription start site (TSS)) in rice under heat stress was 68.25% (Figure 1A), while it was 66.60% in rice\nInt.

Heatmap and signal average plot analysis of the THSs demonstrated that heat stress promoted signaling at the TSS and enhanced accessibility in the transcription initiation region (Figure 1C). We then characterized the number of THSs used to identify a gene. We found that most of the THSs were uniquely mapped to one gene. However, the ratio of THSs mapped to one gene decreased after heat stress treatment, whereas the proportion of THSs corresponding to two or three genes showed a relative increment (Figure 1B).\nInt.

Analysis of the Enriched Motif in ATAC Peaks in Rice under Heat Stress THS enrichment was performed by using Homer software. The enrichment results showed that 1652 THSs were positively enriched whereas 156 THSs were negatively enriched, of which differentially enriched THSs accounted for 7.07% of the overall THSs identified (Table S3). Structural annotation of these differentially enriched THSs showed that the proportions of positive and negative enrichment regions in the upstream 0\u20131, 1\u2013 2, 2\u20133 Kb regions of TSS were 34.18% and 48.39%, 17.68 and 19.35%, 13.07%, and 10.32%, respectively, and the proportions in the intergenic regions were 33.41% and 17.42%, respectively. The highest proportion at the genomic level was in the upstream \u22641 Kb region of TSS (Figure S2). This indicated that heat-responsive cis-regulatory elements were primarily located in the core promoter. To identify the genes with heat-responsive binding elements, we used the TFs in the model plant Arabidopsis to search in the rice genome with the enriched motifs (Figures S3 and S4). This analysis led to the identification of 37 rice genes with heat-responsive TFs (Supplementary Table S2). After removing duplicate genes and selecting the genes with\nFigure 1.

The resulting fusion proteins were then observed by fluorescence microscopy. The signal from both rice protoplast cells and tobacco epidermal cells showed that the OsbZIP14 protein was localized in the nucleus, as shown in Figures 5A and 5B. After that, we used the yeast two-hybrid technique to verify the self-activation and transcriptional activation effect of OsbZIP14. The positive control bacterial solution for interaction grew normally on both the two-deficient and four-deficient media, while the negative control did not grow on the four-deficient medium (Figure 5D). Co-transformation of the OsbZIP14 gene product protein and the corresponding empty vector confirmed that OsbZIP14 has a self-activation function and transcriptional activation activity.

After treatment, it was observed that the leaf tip of WT and OE plants withered, yellowed, and aged, but the OE lines showed better growth than WT (Figure 9A). After this, DAB (3, 3\u2018-diaminobenzidine) and trypan blue staining were used to detect H2O2 accumulation and cell death of rice seedlings under heat stress (Figure 9C). It was found that under heat stress, the leaf tip of the WT lines was stained deeper than that of the OE lines, indicating that the accumulation of H2O2 and the level of cell death in WT were higher than those of OE lines under heat stress. To further investigate the impact of the heat treatment, we transferred the OE and WT plants to normal condition (28 \u25e6C) for one month to recover from stress. It was demonstrated that the survival rate of OsbZIP14 OE and its WT lines were 65.22% and 49.60%, respectively (Figure 9D). On the other hand, these results implied that over-expression of OsbZIP14 gene contributed to the plants\u2019 recovery from rice heat stress (Figure 9B).Int. J. Mol.

The results showed that the OsbZIP14 mutants were dwarfs with fewer tillers under heat stress when compared to the WT plants, indicating that OsbZIP14 promoted the growth and development of rice plants under heat stress (Figure 10A).

Discussion Heat stress poses a major abiotic challenge to the growth and productivity of rice in many countries worldwide. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms of rice to heat stress may facilitate the development of heat-tolerant rice varieties, thereby enhancing productivity in regions with warm climates. he alterations in the expression levels and patterns of TF genes may have a significant impact on rice\u2019s ability to adapt to various abiotic stressors, including light, water, and temperature. With the current focus on climate resilience, a closer examination of the diverse TF genes can lead to more precise crop improvement breeding. Moreover, advances in sequencing technology and omics resources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenome sequencing, are making it increasingly feasible to identify stress-responsive TFs. In this study, we combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data analysis to identify novel TFs that might play key roles in heat stress responses in rice, along with studying their adaptive mechanisms for heat stress. Given the correlation between TF regulation and chromatin accessibility, we sought to identify differentially expressed TFs and motifs enriched in differential chromatin accessibility regions (DARs). Three TF genes were identified, including OsHSF7, OsbZIP14, and OsMYB2. Among these, OsHSF7 had been found to play a critical role in the heat stress responsive pathways in rice. Liu et al. (2009) found that this gene was rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response [30]. In another study, Cheng et al. (2014) also reported that OsHSF7 encodes two main splice variant proteins, OsHSFA2dI and OsHSFA2dII in rice. Under normal conditions, OsHSFA2dII is dominant but it is a transcriptionally inactive spliced form. However, when the plant is under heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response [31]. OsMYB2 was also identified as a regulator in\nFigure 10. OsbZIP14 gene knockout and its WT plants under heat stre s.

OsMYB2 was also identified as a regulator in cold and salt stress responses in rice [32]. Similarly, OsbZIP14 was also reported to be involved in drought stress tolerance in rice [33]. All these results indicated that the three TFs identified in this study had been reported to be involved in rice\u2019s response to different abiotic stresses. Several reports have shown that the expression of bZIP transcription factor genes is altered in response to various abiotic stresses [34,35]. Thus, in this study, we primarily focused on the gene, OsbZIP14, to further investigate its role in rice in response to heat stress. In this investigation, we successfully amplified the crucial TF gene, OsbZIP14, whose expression was significantly downregulated by heat stress. We found that OsbZIP14 was a nuclear transcription factor with transcriptional activation ability and which is localized in the nucleus. To further confirm its function in heat stress response, we obtained homozygous mutant materials for OsbZIP14 loss-of-function and OE through continuous multi-generational breeding in the field. The phenotypic and physiological studies showed that OsbZIP14 played a role in plant growth and development under heat stress. Many senescence-associated mutants have been identified in various plant species to interpret the senescence-related genetic mechanisms [36,37]. To explore the association between the OsbZIP14 gene and heat stress-induced premature leaf senescence, we carried out a heat treatment on OsbZIP14 OE lines at the seedling stage. Excessive accumulation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can induce plant cell death [38,39]. We hence detected H2O2 accumulation and cell death of OsbZIP14 OE seedlings with and without heat treatment by using 3,3\u2032- diaminobenzidine (DAB) and trypan blue staining. The results showed that OsbZIP14 OE had a similar level of H2O2 accumulation and cell death before heat treatment at 28 \u25e6C, whereas WT had higher levels of H2O2 accumulation and cell death after heat treatment at 45 \u25e6C compared with OsbZIP14 OE (Figure 9C). These results indicated that OsbZIP14 could positively contribute to heat tolerance, while dysfunction of OsbZIP14 in WT resulted in higher heat stress susceptibility associated with cell membrane damage and H2O2-induced cell death. Previous studies have also found that the bZIP TFs played pivotal roles in the plant\u2019s abiotic stress response [40]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, bZIP1 was known as a key TF implicated in light and nitrogen sensing [41], while OsbZIP60 was a significant regulator of rice chalkiness and an essential player in water conservation and heat injury resistance [15,42]. Furthermore, the computational analysis and wet experimental results demonstrated that OsbZIP14 protein could directly interact with OsbZIP58 protein product, in which the expression was highly upregulated in the OsbZIP14 mutants at grain filling stage under heat stress (Figure 9C). In silico protein docking analysis was applied through a template based modeling to obtain the lowest energy model, which was a critical step for the subsequent analysis in which PLIP and PDBsum software predicted the structural interaction between OsbZIP14 and OsbZIP58 [43\u201345]. Both tools predicted the presence of hydrogen bonds between the two interacting proteins. The hydrogen bond formation provides a protein and its ligands a directionality and specificity of interaction that is a fundamental aspect of molecular recognition [46]. In another study by Jiang et al.(2002), it was suggested that the hydrogen bond makes an important contribution to the association of stability of protein complexes and in protein\u2013protein interaction studies [47]. Besides the hydrogen bond, the PDB-sum tool also predicted the presence of three salt bridges between the two genes. Salt bridges are also known for their preferences within proteins and at protein\u2013protein interfaces [48]. Finally, the specific interactions of these two genes were confirmed by both pairwise Y2H and BiFC assays. The bZIP family members have been found to be engaged in cooperative binding as homodimers to achieve synergistic effects and interactions [49]. Meanwhile, It was reported that OsbZIP58 and Dof transcriptional activator RPBF jointly regulated the expression of seed storage proteins and grain filling of rice [50,51]. A study conducted by Xu et al. (2020) also revealed that heat stress caused selective splicing of the OsbZIP58 gene, which affects\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5619 12 of 17\nthe accumulation of storage substances and grain quality. According to their finding, under heat stress alternate splicing of OsbZIP58 results in two protein isoforms, the full length OsbZIP58a and the shorter one OsbZIP58b with lower activity. It was also demonstrated that the efficiency of OsbZIP58 pre-mRNA splicing was higher in more thermo-tolerant rice varieties, suggesting a direct link between pre-mRNA splicing and heat stress seed resilience [51]. Despite the phenotypic variation, our findings demonstrated that the OsbZIP58 gene was up-regulated both in the wild type and the mutant. Therefore, OsbZIP14 might play a key role in efficient pre-mRNA splicing of OsbZIP58 to regulate its expression at the grain filling stage of rice under heat stress."

Using this combined approach, we predicted three TF genes, including OsbZIP14, OsMYB2, and OsHSF7. Further investigation on the predicted transcription factor OsbZIP14 was conducted through a series of physiological and biochemical studies to reveal its role as a key regulator in response to heat stress. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we demonstrated that OsbZIP14 contained a basic-leucine zipper domain and primarily functioned as a nuclear TF with transcriptional activation capability. Additionally, we also validated the role of this gene in rice growth under heat stress by using OsbZIP14 gene overexpression and knockout lines during early seedling and the grain-filling stages. Finally, by combining computational and experimental methods we verified the interaction between OsbZIP14 and OsbZIP58 gene, a key regulator of rice seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation. These findings provide good candidate genes for genetic improvement of rice and offer valuable scientific insights into the mechanism of heat tolerance stress in rice.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24065619/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.H.; methodology, F.Q., Y.Z.; writing original draft preparation, F.Q., Y.Z.; software, F.Q., Y.L. and S.T.W.; validation, Y.A., H.S., and Y.X.; formal analysis, F.Q. and S.T.W.; investigation G.H. and S.X.; resources Y.A. and W.L.; writing review and editing\nInt.
