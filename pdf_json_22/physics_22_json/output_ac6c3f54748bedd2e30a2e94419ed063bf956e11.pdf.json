            "text": "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful and widely used research tool that can help\nresearchers study the dynamics of materials at the atomic scale. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is the trajectory of a group of atoms. From the trajectory, many physical quantities can be calculated according to multiscale theory, such as stress and strain [1-5]. The atomic volume and surface area are two geometric quantities, and they play an important role in calculating the physical quantities of an atomic cluster. For example, to calculate the first PiolaKirchhoff stress distribution within an atomic cluster, the intermediate quantities need to be divided by atomic volumes [2-4]. However, an individual atomic volume is not well defined or easy to compute in a MD simulation [6-10].\nLee and Richards presented the three-dimensional shape representation models of solvent\naccessible surface (SA) and molecular surface (MS) for the protein [12]. The molecular volume obtained from the MS model is named the solvent excluded volume. In the special case of a point-sized solvent, these two types of molecular surfaces coincide, referred to as the van der Waals surface (VW). These surface models are shown in Fig. 1. The surface area and volume computational methods based on SA, MS, and VW models can be broadly divided into two types: approximation methods [13-22] and analytic methods [23-29]. Most approximation methods involve certain discretizations, such as polyhedral (generally triangular) decompositions or the representation of a surface with a large number of dots. PyMOL [30] and VMD [31] adopted approximation methods to generate the surface representation of a protein. Representing atoms by spherical balls provides an opportunity for analytically calculating the surface areas and volumes of an atom cluster. Connolly developed an analytical molecular surface and volume calculation method based on the MS model [23, 25]. McConkey introduced an analytic algorithm\nto quantify the atomic surface and volume for a protein based on the SA model [32]. McConkey defined an atomic volume as the intersection between the atom sphere and its Voronoi cell. Based on McConkey\u2019s work, Cazals et al. gave a derivation proof of the calculation formulae of the atomic surface and volume [33]. In addition, they implemented a computational program and performed a detailed numerical analysis.\nThe SA, MS, and VW models were originally designed for protein molecules without\nregard to metallic materials. One general way to compute individual atom volumes for metallic materials is calculating the Voronoi tessellation of atoms and defining the Voronoi cells as individual volumes [3, 4, 6, 7]. However, this method treats atoms as points without considering the effect of atom sizes, and it is sometimes wrong for boundary atoms because the Voronoi cells of the boundary atoms may be unbounded. Stukowski [34] proposed a geometric model to characterize the surface and volume of a metal cluster. First, Stukowski performed Delaunay triangulation to a metal cluster and obtained a set of tetrahedrons. Then, to identify the details of the solid surface and the holes or small gaps in the cluster, Stukowski introduced the concept of a probe sphere. Stukowski chose the size of the probe sphere, compared the probe sphere with the circumscribed sphere of each tetrahedron in the space, and then deleted the tetrahedrons whose circumscribed sphere radius was larger than the probe sphere. The remaining tetrahedrons were the metal cluster volume, and the outer faces of these tetrahedrons formed the cluster surface. However, this model also treats atoms as points without considering the atom size effect, and it can only calculate the overall volume/surface of a metal cluster, not the individual volume/surface for each atom.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for calculating the atomic surfaces and volumes of\na metal cluster. This new method is mainly based on the MS model and absorbs some of the features of Stukoiski's model. First, this method adopts metallic radii to describe atom sizes and constructs the overall volume/surface by the MS model. Then, it divides cluster atoms into two types: interior atoms and boundary atoms. For an interior atom, the method defines a variational Voronoi cell as its volume. For a boundary atom, the method defines the intersection of the overall cluster volume and its variational Voronoi cell as its volume. The atomic surfaces are calculated along with calculating the volumes. Essentially, we define all atomic volumes (both interior and boundary atoms) as the intersection of the overall cluster volume and the corresponding Voronoi cells. Here, we do not adopt the atomic volume definition by McConkey\n[32] and Cazals [33]: the atom sphere intersects with its Voronoi region, because their method was based on the SA model, while ours is based on the MS model. Our new atomic volume/surface method takes into account the effect of atom sizes and can calculate not only the overall volume/surface of a cluster but also the individual volume/surface for each atom.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 reviews the MS model and surface\ndefinition equations. Section 3 gives the surface calculation methods for a metal cluster and individual atoms. Section 4 gives the corresponding volume calculation methods. Section 5 discusses the self-intersecting surface problem encountered in constructing a MS surface. Section 6 discusses the probe radius selection problem. Section 7 gives numerical examples of 3D copper (Cu) nanowire stretching and bending to verify the effectiveness of the volume/surface calculation method. In Section 8, the conclusion is presented."

            "text": "The molecular surface (MS) model defines a geometric description of the outer and inner\nboundaries of an atom cluster. The molecular surface is a smooth network of convex and reentrant faces traced by the inward-facing part of a probe sphere as it rolls over the cluster [23]. The volume obtained by the MS model is also called the solvent-excluded volume [25]. It is a spatial region from which the solvent is excluded by the presence of the molecule (atom cluster). The solvent is also modeled as a hard sphere and chosen as the probe sphere. The solventexcluded volume is the van der Waals volume plus the interstitial volume. The interstitial consists of packing defects between atoms that are too small to admit a probe sphere. This means that the MS model can characterize defect structures in a metal cluster if an appropriate probe sphere is selected. Therefore, the MS model is suitable for describing the occupied volume of a metal cluster. Another advantage of the MS model is that the surface it generates is smooth, which facilitates subsequent multiscale calculations of physical and chemical properties for an atom cluster.\nThe MS definition equations are given in Table 1. A torus between atoms i and j is\ngenerated as a probe sphere rolls around the pair of atoms. The torus has an axis iju , center ijt , and radius ijr .

A tetrahedron is generated\nwhen the probe is simultaneously tangent to three atoms i , j , and k .

Figure 7(a) shows the normal Voronoi tessellation using the Euclidean distance, all interior Voronoi cells are the same size. Figure 7(b) shows the variational Voronoi tessellation using distance Eqs. (5)(6), and the Voronoi cell of atom i is smaller than other interior Voronoi cells. This means that variational Voronoi cells can reflect the influence of atom sizes. From the perspective of atomic physics, the larger an atom is, the larger the region it affects. Therefore, the variational Voronoi cell is more suitable as the interior atom occupied volume than the normal cell.\nThe faces of a variational Voronoi cell are polygons. The surface area of the cell is the sum\nof those polygonal areas that can be calculated using the vertices of the cell. There are two ways to describe a variational Voronoi cell: one is by a set of inequalities, and the other is by vertex coordinates. Eqs. (5) and (6) describe a variational Voronoi cell by a set of inequalities. Through the primal\u2013dual methods [35, 36], the inequalities can be transformed into a set of vertices of the Voronoi cell.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the surface of a boundary atom consists of six parts: partial concave\nfaces, partial saddle faces, convex faces, interior faces, concave supplementary faces and saddle supplementary faces. The surface area of atom i is\ni i i ii i i i i ii i i s n c sc c s n c sc c\nA A A A A A A\u2212 + \u2212 + = + + + + +\u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211    \uff0c\nwhere ic\u2212 , is , ic+ , in , ic , and is represent a partial concave face, partial saddle face, interior face, concave supplementary face, and saddle supplementary face, respectively.\nA concave face is shared by three atoms, as shown in Fig. 9. It should be divided into three\nparts. Each partial concave face belongs to the corresponding atom. There is one torus between every two atoms. Three tori converge at the concave face. The middle section planes of those tours intersect at point ijkc on the concave face, and they divide the concave face into three parts, ic\u2212 , jc\u2212 and kc\u2212 , each of which corresponds to atoms i , j , and k , respectively. The area of partial concave face ic\u2212 is\n( )2 , i p i ic A r \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03c0\u2212 = \u22c5 + + (7)\nwhere i\u03b2 is a concave triangle angle corresponding to atom i , and i\u03b3 is an interior angle on ijkc .\nA saddle face is shared by two atoms, as shown in Fig. 10. It should be divided into two\nparts. Each partial saddle face belongs to the corresponding atom. As shown in Fig. 10, a saddle face is a part of the torus that is between atoms i and j . The middle section of the torus divides\nthe saddle face into two parts that belong to atoms i and j , denoted as partial saddle faces is and js , respectively. The area of is is\n( )sin , i s p ij ss i p si A r r r\u03d5 \u03b8 \u03b8= \u2212 (8)\nwhere s\u03d5 is a saddle wrap angle, ijr is a torus radius, and si\u03b8 and sj\u03b8 are saddle width angles.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, a convex face only relates to a single atom, so its area is completely\ncontained in that atom surface area. A convex face area is given by Eq. (4).\nAs shown in Fig. 8, interior faces are the red lines of the gray region, which are inside the\ncluster. In fact, an interior face is a part of the variational Voronoi partition plane between two atoms. Assuming that atom i forms a torus with atom j , the inequalities describing the shaded region of atom i are\nfor all ,\nfor all ,\nij ij ij\nih h h\nj\nT  \u22c5 \u2264 \u22c5    \u22c5 \u2264 \u22c5 x v t v x n a n\n   \n   \n(9)\nwhere x is a point in the shaded region, ijt is a torus center between ia and ja , ijv is the unit direction vector from ia to ja , hT is a triangle formed by three boundary atoms (including atom i ), and hn is an outward unit normal vector of hT . Similar to calculating the face areas of an interior atom variational Voronoi cell above, the primal\u2013dual methods [35, 36] can be used to convert equalities of Eq. (9) to vertices of the shaded region. Then, interior face areas can be obtained.\nFor a boundary atom, each related concave face produces two supplementary faces, called\nconcave supplementary faces. Figure 11 shows concave supplementary faces as shaded areas. A concave supplementary face is the intersection of a torus middle section and the region between the concave face and triangle base. In fact, it lies on an unbound face of the Voronoi cell of a boundary atom.

A\nsaddle supplementary face is the intersection of a saddle piece (as defined hereinafter), a torus middle section and the corresponding unbounded face of the variational Voronoi cell, as shown in Fig. 12.

The vertices of the variational Voronoi cell can be obtained by Eqs. (5)(6) and the primal\u2013dual methods [35, 36].

The surface of a boundary atom we defined above encloses a bounded region, and the larger the atom is, the larger the enclosed region.

Therefore, the section of pr needs to be carefully considered. In chemistry, the solvent molecule radius is often chosen as pr [32, 33, 37].

It should be noted that to calculate accurate volumes, the prerequisite is to accurately calculate surface areas, as shown in the atomic volume calculation formulae above.\n6.1 Cu nanowire stretching\nFigure 18 shows the initial state of a Cu nanowire with the crystal direction [100] along the\nx-axis, [010] along the y-axis, and [001] along the z-axis. The Cu nanowire has 12\u00d740\u00d712 unit cells along the x, y and z directions, and its size is 43.38 \u00c5\u00d7144.6 \u00c5\u00d743.38 \u00c5 for a total of 25,313 atoms. We loaded the Cu nanowire along the y-axis direction, and the x and z directions were set to have stress-free boundary conditions. We calculated the total potential energy of a Cu nanowire using the EAM potential function proposed in [38].\nThe loading was conducted by the quasi-static loading method. The nanowire was first\nrelaxed for 60 ps to obtain its equilibrium configuration. For the relaxation method, the two layers of atoms at both ends were fixed, and all the remaining atoms were relaxed for 30 ps in the NVT (or canonical) ensemble. The target temperature was 300 K, and the temperature was controlled by the Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat [39]. Then, the last two layers of atoms in the\nnegative y-axis direction were fixed, and the remaining atoms were moved certain distances along the y-axis direction in each loading step. The end atoms in the y-axis direction were moved by 0.2 \u00c5, and the other atoms were moved in proportion to their relative locations. After each loading step, the nanowire was relaxed at a constant temperature of 300 K for 60 ps, and the average atomic positions in the last 2 ps were recorded.\nFigure 19 shows the overall stress\u2013strain curve of the single-crystal Cu nanowire during\nstretching. The stress of the 49th loading step passed the stress peak, indicating that defects were generated in the nanowire.\nWe chose the initial configuration and the 49th loading step configuration to calculate the\nstress distribution, and Figure 20 is the 49th loading step configuration.\nFirst, we calculated the atomic volumes of the initial configuration and 49th loading step\nconfiguration. Figure 21 shows the atomic volume distributions of the two configurations. In Fig. 21(a), atoms in the bin of [2.5, 3.5] were the edge atoms of the nanowire, atoms in the bin of [2.5, 3.5] were face atoms, and atoms in the bin of [10.5, 11.5] were interior atoms. In addition, each of 8 vertex atoms of the nanowire occupied a volume of 1.52 \u00c53. Since their number was too small, they are not shown in the figure. In Fig. 21(b), the atomic volume distribution\nchanged, and the occupied volumes of surface and interior atoms changed more obviously because the dislocations glided over the entire nanowire and the defects were generated.\nFigure 22 shows the stress distributions of the initial configuration and the 49th loading step\nconfiguration. Figure 22(a)(c) shows the stress distributions of the longitudinal sections of the two configurations. Figure 22(b)(d) shows the stress distributions of the cross-sections of the two configurations. In the initial configuration, the internal stresses were small and evenly distributed. The surface stresses were relatively large because the atomic coordination number of the surface atom was less than that of the internal atom. In the 49th loading step configuration, the internal stresses generally increased, but the distribution was no longer uniform. The stresses were concentrated near the defects because the original lattice structure was destroyed (defects were generated), and the strain energy density near the defects was higher than that in other regions. The stress distributions corresponded to the positions of different crystalline structures within the configurations. This result indicated that the stress distributions were consistent with the physical reality and that the atomic volumes calculated by our method were physically meaningful and correct.\n(a) (b)"

In many multiscale models, atomic volumes and surfaces are important innate quantities to calculate macroscopic physical quantities from atomic models. This paper proposes an atomic surface and volume calculation method for metal clusters based on the MS model. This method defines a variational Voronoi diagram. The variational Voronoi cell size is affected by the atom sphere size; the larger the atom is, the larger the cell. There are two atom types in the cluster: interior atoms and boundary atoms. For an interior atom, the method defines a variational Voronoi cell as its volume. For a boundary atom, the method defines the intersection of the overall cluster volume and its variational Voronoi cell as its volume. This atomic volume/surface method considers the effect of atom sizes. Therefore, the method is applicable not only to pure metals but also to alloys. The surface calculations of interior and boundary atoms are along with the volume calculations. Finally, we provide numerical examples of single-crystal Cu nanowire stretching and bending to verify our method. According to the numerical results, the stress distributions were consistent with the defect distributions within nanowires, which indicated that the atomic volumes/surfaces generated by our method are physically meaningful and accurate."
