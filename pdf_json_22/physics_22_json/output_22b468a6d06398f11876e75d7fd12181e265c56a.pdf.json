    "abstractText": "The design of fast algorithms for combinatorial optimization greatly contributes to a plethora of domains such as logistics, finance, and chemistry. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs), which utilize the power of quantum machines and inherit the spirit of adiabatic evolution, are novel approaches to tackle combinatorial problems with potential runtime speedups. However, hurdled by the limited quantum resources nowadays, QAOAs are infeasible to manipulate large-scale problems. To address this issue, here we revisit the MaxCut problem via the divide-and-conquer heuristic: seek the solutions of subgraphs in parallel and then merge these solutions to obtain the global solution. Due to the Z2 symmetry in MaxCut, we prove that the merging process can be further cast into a new MaxCut problem and thus be addressed by QAOAs or other MaxCut solvers. With this regard, we propose QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA) to solve arbitrary large-scale MaxCut problems using small quantum machines. We also prove that the approximation ratio of QAOA is lower bounded by 1/2. Experiment results illustrate that under different graph settings, QAOA attains a competitive or even better performance over the best known classical algorithms when the node count is around 2000. Our method can be seamlessly embedded into other advanced strategies to enhance the capability of QAOAs in large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.",

Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs), which utilize the power of quantum machines and inherit the spirit of adiabatic evolution, are novel approaches to tackle combinatorial problems with potential runtime speedups. However, hurdled by the limited quantum resources nowadays, QAOAs are infeasible to manipulate large-scale problems. To address this issue, here we revisit the MaxCut problem via the divide-and-conquer heuristic: seek the solutions of subgraphs in parallel and then merge these solutions to obtain the global solution. Due to the Z2 symmetry in MaxCut, we prove that the merging process can be further cast into a new MaxCut problem and thus be addressed by QAOAs or other MaxCut solvers. With this regard, we propose QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA2) to solve arbitrary large-scale MaxCut problems using small quantum machines. We also prove that the approximation ratio of QAOA2 is lower bounded by 1/2. Experiment results illustrate that under different graph settings, QAOA2 attains a competitive or even better performance over the best known classical algorithms when the node count is around 2000. Our method can be seamlessly embedded into other advanced strategies to enhance the capability of QAOAs in large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCombinatorial optimization [1], which aims to search for maxima or minima of an objective function with discrete solution space, is an indispensable tool in various application domains such as portfolio investment, vehicle routing and transportation [2, 3]. Driven by its fundamental importance, huge efforts have been dedicated to devising efficient algorithms for combinatorial problems during past decades. Representative examples include using semidefinite programming techniques to approximate the solution of MaxCut and maximum 2- satisfiability problems [4, 5], adopting the simulated annealing methods to solve constrained problems [6], and exploiting other heuristics such as expert knowledge and the structure of studied problems to solve traveling salesman problems [7\u20139]. Recently, attributed to the power of neural networks, deep learning techniques have also been employed in solving combinatorial optimization problems [10\u201312]. Nevertheless, due to the intrinsic hardness of most combinatorial problems [13], existing methods request expensive computational overhead to estimate the optimal solution and thus it is highly demanded to design more powerful algorithms to speed up the optimization.\nQuantum computers have the ability to efficiently solve certain problems that are computationally hard for classical computers [14]. This superiority could be preserved for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) ma-\n\u2217 This work was done when he was a research intern at JD Explore Academy, zhouzeqiao@mail.ustc.edu.cn \u2020 Corresponding author, duyuxuan123@gmail.com \u2021 Corresponding author, xinmei@ustc.edu.cn \u00a7 Corresponding author, dacheng.tao@sydney.edu.au\nchines [15], because both theoretical and experimental studies have exhibited their runtime merits over the classical counterparts for certain tasks [16\u201318]. For this reason, there is a growing interest in designing NISQ algorithms with computational merits. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) [19], which consist of parameterized quantum circuits [20] and classical optimizers to adequately leverage accessible quantum resources and suppress the system noise, are leading solutions to achieve this goal. Notably, initial studies have exhibited that quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) [21], as one crucial paradigm of VQAs, can be used to tackle combinatorial optimization with potential computational advantages [22, 23]. The underlying principle of QAOAs is mapping a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem describing the explored combinatorial problem to a Hamiltonian whose ground state refers to the optimal solution [24, 25]. In this way, various manipulable quantum systems can be used to advance combinatorial problems [26\u201328].\nEnvisioned by the promising prospects, both empirical and theoretical studies have been carried out to understand the foundation of QAOAs and improve their performance. One critical line of research is unveiling the connection between adiabatic quantum computation [29, 30] and QAOAs and showing that QAOAs can be seen as a parameterized Trotterization of adiabatic evolution [21, 31, 32]. Making use of this relation, the parameter initialization of QAOAs can be simplified associated with an improved performance [32\u201334]. In parallel to explore the initialization strategy, another crucial topic is designing advanced training strategies of QAOA to avoid local optima and accelerate optimization. Concrete examples include modifying the objective functions [35], applying the iterative training strategy [36, 37], and\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n11 76\n2v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 4\nM ay\n2 02\n2\n2 \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udefe 1 ) \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udefe p ) \u2026 \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefd1 \ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefd1\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefd1\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefd1\n\ud835\udefe = \ud835\udefe1, \u2026 , \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udefd = (\ud835\udefd1, \u2026 , \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc5d)\n(a)\nz\n|+\u27e9\n|+\u27e9\n|+\u27e9\n|+\u27e9\n1-level p-level\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefdp\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefdp\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefdp\n\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udefdp\n(b)\nFIG. 1.

The classical optimizer uses the measured bitstring to updated parameters of the circuit.\nusing adaptive mixing operators [34, 38\u201340]. Despite the remarkable achievements, little progress has been made in overcoming the scalability issue of QAOAs, whereas the ultimate goal of the most advanced QAOA is solving a problem with hundreds of vertices [41]. The main challenges come from the fact that manipulating a graph with n-nodes requires O(n) qubits but the most advanced quantum machines nowadays can only provide a very limited number of qubits with n \u2248 100. Moreover, due to the a high-level noise and barren plateaus, QAOAs may suffer from the trainability issue for the large n [42\u201346], which degrade their performance [28, 47]. Although an initial attempt of the scalable QAOAs has been addressed by [48, 49], their approach encounters the sample complexity issue [50]. To this end, it still remains obscure whether QAOAs can outperform classical approaches towards large-scale combinatorial problems.\nTo further enhance the capability of QAOAs, here we investigate the possibility of QAOAs toward solving large-scale MaxCut problems, especially when the problem size is greatly larger than the qubit count of the accessible quantum machines. In particular, we revisit MaxCut through the lens of the divide-and-conquer heuristic, i.e., splitting the given graph into multiple subgraphs, seeking the solutions of these subgraphs in parallel, and then merging these solutions to obtain the global solution. Notably, we prove that due to the inherent Z2 symmetry in MaxCut, the merging process can be cast to a new MaxCut problem. This observation hints that the large-scale MaxCut problem can be tackled by MaxCut solvers in a hierarchical way. To this end, we propose QAOA-in-QAOA (QAOA2) to solve MaxCut with tens of thousands of nodes using NISQ machines. In addition, QAOA2 can integrate with the community detection method in the process of graph partition to attain better performance. On the theoretical side, we show that\nthe lower bound of the approximation ratio of QAOA2 is 1/2. On the experimental side, we first approximate the solution of MaxCut instances with 2000 vertices using QAOA2 executed on a 10-qubit quantum simulator. The achieved results are competitive or even better than the best known classical method. Moreover, through a systematical investigation, we verify that the density of graphs and subgraphs, the size of subgraphs and partition strategies are the decisive factors effecting the performance of QAOA2. These results suggest that QAOA2 provides a potential and novel way of utilizing NISQ machines to solve practical learning problems with computational advantages.\nII. PRELIMINARIES\nThe main focus of this study is solving MaxCut problems as shown in Fig. 1(a). Formally, let G(V,E) be an undirected graph, where the number of vertices is |V| = N and the edge weight for (i, j) \u2208 E is Wij = Wji. Define a cut as a partition of the original set V into two subsets S and T with V = S \u22c3 T and S \u22c2 T = \u2205. The aim of MaxCut is to find S maximizing the sum of edge weight connecting vertices in S and T. Denote zi = +1 (zi = \u22121) when the i-th vertex is in S (T), any partition of V can be represented by a bitstring z \u2208 {+1,\u22121}n. The optimal solution z\u2217 of MaxCut maximizes the following objective function\nC(z) := 1\n2 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208E Wij(1\u2212 zizj) = c\u2212 1 2 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208E Wijzizj ,\n(1) where c = 12 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208EWij only depends on the problem and is independent of z. Theoretical studies have proven that finding z\u2217 is NP-hard so in most cases we are searching for an approximation of z\u2217 [13]. The best-known classical MaxCut solver is Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm [5], which uses the semi-definite programming (SDP) technique to ensure 0.879 approximation ratio [4].\nTo carry out combinatorial problems on physical systems, it is necessary to map the problem to a Hamiltonian whose ground state corresponds to the optimal solution [25]. In the task of MaxCut with n vertices, this Hamiltonian yields\nHC = \u2211\n(i,j)\u2208E\nWijZiZj , (2)\nwhere Zi refers to the Pauli-Z operator applied on the i-th qubit with i \u2208 [n] [51]. The optimal solution |z\u2217\u3009 amounts to the computational basis state |z\u3009 minimizing \u3008z|HC |z\u3009. Since HC is diagonal, |z\u2217\u3009 also refers to its ground state.\nQuantum approximate optimization algorithm and its variants (QAOAs) [21], which absorb the merits of quantum annealing [22] and variational quantum algorithms [19], are proposed to solve combinatorial problems\non NISQ machines with potential advantages. As shown in Fig. 1(b), when applied to MaxCut, QAOA approximates the ground state by an ansatz state\n|\u03a6(\u03b3,\u03b2)\u3009 = UB(\u03b2p)UC(\u03b3p) . . . UB(\u03b21)UC(\u03b31)|s\u3009 (3)\nwhere |s\u3009 = (|0\u3009\u2297n + |1\u3009\u2297n)/ \u221a\n2 is the initial state, \u03b3,\u03b2 \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0]p are variational parameters, and UB(\u03b2) = exp(\u2212i\u03b2 \u2211n k Xk) and UC(\u03b3) = exp(\u2212i\u03b3HC). To find |z\u2217\u3009, a classical optimizer is used to update \u03b3 and \u03b2 by minimizing the following objective function\nC(\u03b3,\u03b2) = \u3008\u03a6(\u03b3,\u03b2)|HC |\u03a6(\u03b3,\u03b2)\u3009. (4)\nIn the optimal setting, the optimal solution yields |z\u2217\u3009 = |\u03a6(\u03b3\u2217,\u03b2\u2217)\u3009 with |\u03a6(\u03b3\u2217,\u03b2\u2217)\u3009 = arg minC(\u03b3,\u03b2).\nIII. QAOA-IN-QAOA\nStandard QAOAs require n qubits to solve a MaxCut problem with n vertices. This linear dependence suppresses the power of QAOA, since the accessible quantum resources nowadays are vey limited. To assign the capability of QAOAs for solving large-scale problems, here we revisit MaxCut through the lens of the divide-and-conquer heuristic. Specifically, in the dividing step, we partition the given graph G into h subgraphs\n{Gi(Vi,Ei)}hi=1, where V = \u22c3h i=1 Vi and Vi \u22c2 Vj = \u2205 when i 6= j. An intuition of this partition process is exhibited in Fig. 2(a). Once the partition is completed,\nthe MaxCut solvers are exploited to seek optimal solutions of these subgraphs in parallel. We denote the optimized solutions for all h subgraphs as {xi}hi=1 with xi \u2208 {+1,\u22121}|Vi| for \u2200i \u2208 [h]. Due to the Z2 symmetry in MaxCut [36], the bitstring x\u0304i, which flips all bits in xi, also corresponds to the solution of Gi for \u2200i \u2208 [h]. In the conquering step, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the obtained solutions of all subgraphs are merged to obtain the global solution z of G. Since there are two solutions for each subgraph, the total number of the possible global solutions is 2h, i.e., z \u2208 Z := {x1, x\u03041}\u2295{x2, x\u03042}...\u2295{xh, x\u0304h}. Taking into account the connections among h subgraphs, the global solution yields\nz\u0302 = arg max z\u2208Z C(z). (5)\nThe following theorem illustrates that seeking z\u0302 can be cast into a new MaxCut problem, where the corresponding proof is provided in Appendix B.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that the graph G is partitioned into h subgraphs {Gi}hi=1 and the optimized local solutions are {xi}hi=1. To find the bitstring z\u0302 in Eq. (5), let si = +1 (or \u22121) be the indicator of adopting xi (or x\u0304i). Then z\u0302 is identified by s = (s1, . . . , sh) \u2208 {\u00b11}h, i.e.,\nmax z\u2208Z C(z) \u2261 max s C \u2032(s) = \u22121 2 \u2211 i<j w\u2032ijsisj + c, (6)\nwhere w\u2032ij = 1 2 \u2211 u \u2211 v x (u) i x (v) j Wiu,jv, x (u) i is the u-th bit in xi, Wiu,jv is the weight of edge between the two nodes\ncorresponding to x (u) i and x (v) j , and c = \u2211 i Ci(xi) +\u2211\ni<j 1 2 \u2211 u \u2211 vWiu,jv, Ci(xi) is the optimized value of\ncut for the subgraph Gi.\nThe above results hint that MaxCut problems can be tackled in a hierarchical way. According to the reformulated MaxCut in the divide-and-conquer manner, we devise QAOA-in-QAOA, dubbed QAOA2, which allows us to use an n-qubit quantum machine to solve an N - vertex MaxCut with n N . The schematic of QAOA2 is shown in Fig. 2. More specifically, in the partition procedure, the graph is divided into several subgraphs that are compatible with quantum devices. This step can be achieved by using random clustering, community detection, or other advanced strategies (See Appendix A for elaborations). The setting of h is flexible, whereas the only requirement is that the size of subgraphs should be less than n, i.e., |Vi| \u2264 n, \u2200i \u2208 [h]. After partitions, all subgraphs {Gi}hi=1 are solved independently by QAOAs to collect {xi}hi=1. Last, to obtain the estimated global solution z\u0302, we apply QAOAs again to optimize the merging through reformulated MaxCut according to Theorem 1. Note that when h > n, the available number of qubits is insufficient to complete the merging process. As such, QAOA2 applies the partition procedure successively on C \u2032(s) until the number of subgraphs is no larger than n. The diagram of QAOA2 is summarized in Fig. 2(c).\nQAOA2 embraces two attractive theoretical advantages. First, compared with other QAOA solvers, QAOA2 is immune to the scalability issue. This characteristic is highly desired for NISQ machines, which provides the opportunity to attain potential quantum advantages towards large-scale combinatorial problems. Moreover, the following theorem whose proof is given in Appendix C guarantees that the approximation ratio of QAOA2 is always better than the random guess.\nTheorem 2. Following notations in Theorem 1, the estimated solution z\u0302 output by QAOA2 always satisfies\nC(z\u0302) \u2265 1 2 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208E Wij . (7)\nIV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS\nIn this section, we conduct numerical simulation to evaluate the ability of QAOA2 towards large-scale MaxCut problems. Specifically, we first give the setup of our experiments, including hyper-parameter settings and the constructions of graphs for MaxCut. Then we compare performance of our proposal with other MaxCut solvers. Last, we comprehend the potential factors influencing the performance of QAOA2.\nTo fully evaluate the performance of QAOA2, we collect a set of graphs varying in size, degrees of nodes, and\n5 G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 0.880 0.884 0.888 0.892 Unweighted Regular A p p ro x im at io n R at io 0.8872 0.8870 0.8836 0.8865 0.8855 0.8827 0.8846 0.8837 0.8855 0.8854\nG1 G2 G3 G4 G5\n0.880\n0.884\n0.888\n0.892 Unweighted ER\nA p\np ro\nx im\nat io\nn R\nat io\n0.8849\n0.8875\n0.8858 0.8845 0.8846\n0.8815\n0.8827\n0.8821\n0.8836 0.8837\nFIG. 4. Approximation ration of QAOA2 and GW over 2000-vertex graph instances under C\u2217asymp. The labels follow the same meaning with those used in Fig. 3. The only difference is the way of calculting the approximation ratio, where the denominator is replaced by C\u2217asymp.\nthe weight of edges. For convenience, an unweighted (or weighted) d-regular graph with n nodes is abbreviated as \u201cudr-n\u201d (or \u201cwdr-n\u201d). Similarly, for the Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph whose degree of each node is randomly assigned, an unweighted (or weighted) ER graph with the average degree being d and the node size being n is abbreviated as \u201cude-n\u201d (or \u201cwde-n\u201d). For the weighted graphs, their weights are integers uniformly sampled from [0, 5]. For each setting, we generate multiple instances to obtain the statistical results of the employed MaxCut solver.\nWhen QAOA2 is applied, we specify that the allowable number of qubits is n \u2264 10 and the random partition strategy is adopted. To find the local solutions xi in the dividing step, we use a 1-layer QAOA (i.e., p = 1 in Eq. (3)) and the number of iterations for training QAOA is set as T = 20. To systematically investigate the potential of QAOA2 compared with the classical MaxCut solvers, we employ GW algorithm as the reference. The setting of hyper-parameters of adopted MaxCut solvers is given in Appendix E.\nIn all simulations, we adopt the approximation ratio as the metric to compare the performance of different MaxCut solvers. Mathematically, given a MaxCut problem, denote CA as the cuts achieved by algorithm A, the approximation ratio yields\nrA = CA C\u2217 . (8)\nwhere C\u2217 denotes the optimal value of MaxCut. Considering that the exact optimal value C\u2217 is exponentially difficult to get for large N , we substitute it with the op-\ntimal value C\u2217SDP of semidefinite programming optimization step in GW. Another metric we adopt for unweighted regular graphs and unweighted ER graphs with degree d is an asymptotic value derived in [52], where the optimal\nvalue of cut is (d4+P \u221a d 4+o( \u221a d))N and P = 0.7632 is the constant in Parisi formula. In calculating approximation\nrate, we set the optimal result as C\u2217asymp = ( d 4 +P \u221a d 4 )N .\nWe first apply QAOA2 to 2000-vertex graphs, i.e., u100r-2000, w100r-2000, u100e-2000, and w100e-2000. The numerical results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 under the measures C\u2217SDP and C \u2217 asymp, respectively. Each setting includes 5 graph instances. Meanwhile, for each instance, we use 5 different random seeds to initialize parameters of QAOA2. In almost all instances, QAOA2 outperforms GW. For example, under the measure C\u2217SDP, the averaged approximation ratio QAOA2 is higher than that of GW, except for the instance G3 with u1000r-2000, the instance G5 with w1000r-2000, and the instances G2, G3, and G5 with w1000e-2000. Under the measure C\u2217asymp, the averaged approximation ratio QAOA\n2 is higher than that of GW, except for the instance G3 with u1000r-2000. In this instances, the maximal differences of the approximation ratio is only 0.0001. Moreover, both QAOA2 and GW can obtain a better performance on unweighted graphs than weighted graphs. A possible reason is the intrinsic hardness in finding optimal solution for weighted graphs. Besides, since the distribution of weighted edges is unbalanced and the graph connectivity is sparse, random partition used in QAOA2 is not a suitable choice, which may leave most edges remained among subgraphs. To this end, we exhibit how advanced partition methods, i.e., community detection algorithm, can further improve the power of QAOA2 in Appendix E. Note that QAOA2 may attain a better runtime efficiency than GW, benefiting from its hierarchical scheme and the computational advantage of quantum algorithm.\nWe next explore the potential factors that may influence the performance of QAOA2. As mentioned previously, the sparsity of graph may reduce the power of QAOA2. To fully understand this effect, we conduct the systematical simulations on mild-size graphs varying in the number of nodes and the graph connectivity. Specifically, we study udr-n, wdr-n, ude-n and wde-n with d \u2208 [3, 9] and n \u2208 [20, 100]. For each setting, we generate 10 instances and use the average approximation ratio of them to evaluate the performance of QAOA2. Here both C\u2217SDP and C \u2217 asymp are too loose, so we use the value of cut searched by GW algorithm as C\u2217 to calculate the approximation ratio rA. As shown in Fig. 5(a), an evident observation is that QAOA2 prefers denser graph than sparse graph. For example, QAOA2 achieves an approximation ratio of 0.9488 on u9r-20 but only 0.5836 on u3r-100. Consequently, a reasonable conjecture is that the main contribution of cuts comes from the cuts inside subgraphs. In order to improve the performance of QAOA2, one possible way is making the subgraphs as\ndense as possible. An alternative approach is adopting a better graph partition strategy such as the community detection method discussed in Appendix A.\nApart from the property of graph, the hyperparameter setting of QAOA2, i.e., the qubit counts n and the number of layers p, may also effect its performance. With this regard, we consider the setting of graphs with 60 vertices and 9 degree i.e. u9r-60, u9e-60, w9r-60, and w9e-60. The number of qubits n is chosen in {8, 10, 12, 15} and the level p is chosen in [1, 5]. The results are collected across 10 instances for each setting. The achieved results are shown in Fig. 5(b). Specifically, under the measure of the averaged approximation ration, a deeper level p slightly contribute much improvement. A concrete example is u9e-60, where the performance of QAOA2 with p = 4 is inferior to the performance of QAOA2 with p = 3. Nevertheless, the performance QAOA2 can increase significantly with the larger subgraph size n. For example, when the level is specified to be p = 1, the approximation ratio of QAOA2 is increased by 0.06 in u9r-60 and 0.1 in w9r-60 when n improves from 8 to 14. These observations indicate that executing QAOA2 on a large quantum system contributes to a better performance.\nV. DISCUSSION\nIn this study, we propose QAOA2 that utilizes the structure of graphs and Z2 symmetry to solve large-scale MaxCut problems on small-scale quantum devices. We prove that a hierarchical scheme can be achieved via\nreformulated MaxCuts. The approximation ratio is always greater than 0.5. The numerical results show that the proposed QAOA2 achieves comparable performance on 2000-vertex graphs against the best known classical algorithm. Moreover, numerical results indicates that QAOA2 can attain better performance for denser graphs which are hard for conventional QAOAs. Our work sheds light on solving large-scale problems with potential advantages in NISQ era.\nThere are several important future research directions. First, it is crucial to design more instance-aware partition strategies to further improve the capabilities of QAOA2. Furthermore, an intriguing direction is integrating QAOA2 with with distributed variational quantum optimization techniques [53\u201355], which allows us to accelerate the optimization and understand the power of QAOA2 on large-scale problems. Next, since the subgraphs are independent, the performance of QAOA2 could be enhanced by employing advanced and problemspecific local QAOA2 solvers [38, 40, 56]. Last, the concept of decomposing Hamiltonian by its symmetric property used in QAOA2 can be generalized to boost other variational quantum algorithms. For example, in quantum chemistry, some proposals of variational eigensolvers have used the natural symmetry of some molecular to reduce the required number of qubits [57\u201359]. In quantum machine learning, the concept of decomposing Hamiltonian by its symmetric property can be leveraged to design powerful Hamiltonian-based quantum neural networks with some invariant properties [60, 61]. In this way, these QNNs can attain better convergence and generalization [62\u201366].\n7 [1] Bernhard Korte and Jens Vygen. Combinatorial Optimization: Theory and Algorithms.

[77] https://github.com/networkx/networkx.\n11\nSupplementary Material: \u201cQAOA-in-QAOA: solving large-scale MaxCut problems on small quantum machines\u201d\nThe organization of Supplementary Material is as follows. In Appendix A, we present how advanced partitioned methods can further improve the performance of QAOA2. In Appendix B, we provide the proof of Theorem 1. Then in Appendix C, we demonstrate the proof of Theorem 2. Subsequently, we discuss how QAOA2 relates to the Hamiltonian splitting method ind Appendix D. Last, in Appendix E, we exhibit the omitted simulation details and more simulation results of QAOA2.\nAppendix A: Graph partitioning\nA crucial step in QAOA2 is partitioning graph into subgraphs. We note that the way of partition is diverse. Here we present two possible partition methods, i.e., random partition and community detection based partition. We leave the design of more advanced partition methods as the future work.\nRandom partition. The algorithmic implementation of the random partition is as follows. Given the number of qubits n and a graph with size N , random partition successively samples n vertices as a subgraph without replacement until all dN/ne subgraphs are collected.\nWe remark that for dense graphs, random partition promises a good learning performance of QAOA2 since the probability of an edge existing between arbitrary two vertex is high. In contrast, for graphs whose expected vertex degree is low, random partition may lead to an inferior performance. This is because the collected subgraphs may contain few edges and most edges remaining between subgraphs.\nCommunity detection based partition. According to the above explanations, a natural idea to enhance the power of QAOA2 is to maintain as many edges inside each subgraph as possible, which in turn suppresses the error incurred by partition. With this regard, we introduce modularity [67] as a measure of the quality of partitioning. A mathematical definition of modularity is\nQ = 1\n2m \u2211 ij [ Aij \u2212 kikj 2m ] \u03b4(ci, cj), (A1)\nwhere m is the sum of weights of all edges, Aij is the element of adjacency matrix, ki is the sum of weights of edges connected to vertex i, and ci is the community that the vertex i is assigned. Intuitively, the term kikj 2m indicates the probability of edge existing between i and j in a randomized graph. When the fraction of edges within communities equals to a randomized graph, the quantity Q will be zero. When Q > 0.3, it indicates a significant community structure [68].\nQAOA2 pursues a high modularity Q, where the connectivity in subgraphs is dense but the connectivity between different subgraphs is sparse. An algorithm searching for high modularity partition is referred to as community detection algorithm, which regards subgraphs as communities. Several algorithms have been proposed to maximize modularity and to find community structure in graphs [67\u201370]. Here we consider the greedy modularity maximization algorithm [68]. In particular, starting with each vertex being only member of its own community, the algorithm joins the pair of communities that increases the modularity the most. This procedure is continuously conducted until no such pair exists or the termination condition is met.\nWe benchmark the performance of QAOA2 with different partition methods in Appendix E.\nAppendix B: Proof of Theorem 1\nProof of Theorem 1. Although xi and x\u0304i yield the same local objective value (i.e., Ci(xi) = Ci(x\u0304i)), they may lead to a distinct objective value (i.e., C(x1...xi...xh) 6= C(x1...x\u0304i...xh)), because of the connection between Gi and other subgraphs {Gi\u2032}i\u2032 6=i. Considering that there are in total 2h candidates in Z in Eq. (5), our goal here is formulating an equivalent objective function that finds the target bitstring satisfying z\u0302 = arg minz\u2208Z C(z) using NISQ devices.\nConsidering two neighboring subgraphs Gi and Gj , we denote si \u2208 {+1,\u22121} as flipping indicator in the sense that si = \u22121 flips xi to be x\u0304i and si = +1 keeps xi unchanged. When two subgraphs are synchronous, i.e. si = sj , the inter-cut between them is retained and the inter-cut size is\nwsyncij = \u2211 u \u2211 v 1 2 (1\u2212 x(u)i x (v) j )Wiu,jv, (B1)\n12\nwhere x (u) i denotes the u-th bit in local solution bitstring xi with u \u2208 [|Vi|] and Wiu,jv is the weight of edge in G corresponding to two vertices x (u) i and x (v) j . Note that here we define xi \u2208 {+1,\u22121}|Vi|, the coefficient 12 acts as a standardization term to make sure wsyncij is the sum of cut edges between Gi and Gj when adopting xi,xj (or x\u0304i, x\u0304j). When two subgraphs are asynchronous, i.e., si = \u2212sj , the inter-cut takes the form\nwasyncij = \u2211 u \u2211 v 1 2 (1\u2212 x(u)i x\u0304 (v) j )Wiu,jv\n= \u2211 u \u2211 v 1 2 (1 + x (u) i x (v) j )Wiu,jv,\n(B2)\nwhere the second equality uses the relationship x\u0304j = \u2212xj . Let s = (s1, s2, . . . , sh) \u2208 {+1,\u22121}h be an h-length bitstring as the indicator for the selection of {xi, x\u0304i} to form z. Define w\u2032ij = w async ij \u2212w sync ij , c = \u2211h i=1 Ci(xi) + \u2211 i<j 1 2 (w sync ij +w async ij ), and Ci(xi) as the local cut size of Gi. For \u2200z \u2208 Z, the objective value C(z) in Eq. (5) yields\nC(z)\n=C(s1x1, . . . , shxh) = \u2211 i<j \u2211 u \u2211 v 1 2 (1\u2212 six(u)i sjx (v) j )Wiu,jv + \u2211 i Ci(xi)\n= \u2211 i<j 1 2\n( \u2212sisj\n\u2211 u \u2211 v Wiu,jvx (u) i x (v) j + \u2211 u \u2211 v Wiu,jv ) + \u2211 i Ci(xi)\n= \u2211 i<j 1 2 [ (wsyncij + w async ij ) + (w sync ij \u2212 w async ij )sisj ] + \u2211 i Ci(xi) =\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i<j w\u2032ijsisj + c,\nwhere the second equality consists of two summations, i.e., the first term is the sum of inter cut between each pair of subgraphs and the second term is the sum of local cut inside subgraphs (which is not influenced by s), the last second equality uses wasyncij \u2212 w sync ij = \u2211 u \u2211 vWiu,jvx (u) i x (v) j and w async ij + w sync ij = \u2211 u \u2211 vWiu,jv.\nDefine C \u2032(s) = c\u2212 12 \u2211 i<j w \u2032 ijsisj . Since all local cuts {Ci(xi)} are fixed, we have\nmax s\u2208{+1,\u22121}h C \u2032(s) = max z\u2208Z C(z). (B3)\nWe find a good merging by optimizing the above.\nIn most cases, optimizing merging of local solutions will improve the value of cut. However, if the local solutions happens to be in a good order, one can merge them without further optimization. We show the effect of merging optimization through experiments in Appendix E.\nAppendix C: Proof of Theorem 2\nProof of Theorem 2. We follow notations defined in Appendix B to prove Theorem 2. Suppose that G is partitioned into h subgraphs G1, . . . ,Gh, we can divide edges into two parts E = E inner \u22c3 Einter where Einner = \u22c3h i=1 Ei denotes\nthe set of edges inside all subgraphs and Einter = \u22c3\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h Eij denotes the set of edges between subgraphs. Here the\n13\nweight of edge e \u2208 E is denoted by w(e). Then we have\u2211 e\u2208E w(e) = \u2211 e\u2208Einner w(e) + \u2211 e\u2208Einter w(e)\n= \u2211\ne\u2208 \u22c3h\ni=1 Ei\nw(e) + \u2211\ne\u2208 \u22c3\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h Eij\nw(e)\n= h\u2211 i=1 \u2211 e\u2208Ei w(e) + \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264h \u2211 e\u2208Eij w(e).\n(C1)\nWhen optimizing subgraphs, we can use any MaxCut solvers to return a set of local solutions {xi}hi=1 such that the cut value is greater than half of the sum of edge weights for all subgraphs {Gi}hi=1. Mathematically, the sum of edge weight for each subgraph satisfies\nCi(xi) \u2265 1\n2 \u2211 e\u2208Ei w(e) (C2)\nand the sum of edge weight for all subgraphs yields\nC inner = h\u2211 i=1 Ci(xi) \u2265 1 2 \u2211 e\u2208 \u22c3h i=1 Ei w(e). (C3)\nThe above result means that we can always at least obtain half of the sum of edge weight edges inside h subgraphs. Combining Eq. (C1) and Eq. (C3), an observation is that if QAOA2 outputs a solution s = {si}hi=1 such that the cut value of intra-subgraphs achieves at least half of the second term \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264h \u2211 e\u2208Eij w(e) in Eq. (C1), then the\ntotal cut value for the whole graph is greater than 12 \u2211 e\u2208E w(e). Recall the terms w async ij and w sync ij defined in Theorem 1, we have \u2211 e\u2208Einter w(e) = \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264h \u2211 e\u2208Eij w(e)\n= \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h \u2211 u \u2211 v Wiu,jv\n= \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h\nwasyncij + w sync ij\n= \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h\n2wsyncij + (w async ij \u2212 w sync ij )\n= \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h\n2wsyncij + w \u2032 ij\n= \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h\n2wsyncij + \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264h\nw\u2032ij .\n(C4)\nNote that the reformulated MaxCut in Theorem 1 in QAOA2 is\nC \u2032(s) = \u2211 i<j 1 2 [ (wsyncij + w async ij ) + (w sync ij \u2212 w async ij )sisj ] + \u2211 i Ci(xi)\n= \u2211 i<j wsyncij + \u2211 i<j (wasyncij \u2212 w sync ij )(1\u2212 sisj)\n+ \u2211 i Ci(xi)\n= \u2211 i<j w\u2032ij(1\u2212 sisj) + \u2211 i<j wsyncij + C inner\n14\nwhere \u2211\ni<j w \u2032 ij(1 \u2212 sisj) is optimized by the MaxCut solver and at least half of \u2211 i<j w \u2032 ij is cut.

(C3), the second inequality uses the result of Eq. (C4), and the last equality uses Eq. (C1).\nWe end this section by illustrating when the lower bound is achieved, Consider the example of a four-vertex unweighted ring where V = {1, 2, 3, 4} and E = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 4)}. Suppose we partition it into two subgraphs G1 and G2 with V1 = {1, 3} and V2 = {2, 4}. So further if one of the local solutions is (+1,\u22121), the final cut is 2 and the ratio is 12 no matter how the global solution is merged. A smarter partition will be V1 = {1, 2} and V2 = {3, 4} where all edges are cut eventually. This case shows that the lower bound can be attained in worst case and effective partition strategy can alleviate this issue.\nAppendix D: Relation with Hamiltonian splitting\nMany quantum computing tasks such as QAOA or VQE aims to find an eigenstate (ground state or most excited state) corresponding to a target eigenvalue of a given Hamiltonian H. We prepare a quantum state |\u03c8(\u03b8)\u3009 on parameterized circuit and measure it with H. Then we feed \u3008\u03c8(\u03b8)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8)\u3009 to an optimizer and update the parameters. To measure states on qubit quantum computers, this Hamiltonian is represented in terms of Pauli words and each Pauli word can be written as tensor product of Pauli matrices i.e. H = \u2211 k \u03b1kPk. Thus we have\n\u3008\u03c8(\u03b8)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8)\u3009 = \u2211 k \u03b1k\u3008\u03c8(\u03b8)|Pk|\u03c8(\u03b8)\u3009. (D1)\nThis allows us to measure each Pauli words individually and add them together. In QAOA for MaxCut problem, H takes the form of 2 where all Pauli words are tensor products of two Pauli-Z matrices corresponding to edges in problem graph.\nIn general, an arbitrary Hamiltonian of n-qubit has O(4n) Pauli words so the query of circuit grows exponentially with qubit counts if we simply measure one Pauli word at a time. Note that two observables can be measured simultaneously if they are commutable. Moreover, if a group of pairwise commuting observables share the same eigenbasis that diagonalizes them all simultaneously, they can be also measured on the same prepared state. For example in MaxCut problem, all Pauli words share the same eigenbasis (computational basis) so we don\u2019t need to measure O(n2) terms individually but only once. One method to reduce circuit query is to split Hamiltonian into several clusters and each cluster is a commuting group of Pauli words we mentioned above. The less number of clusters, the less of circuit query. Recent researches mapped Hamiltonian splitting task into MinCliqueCover problem [71, 72]. Besides, additional speedup can be introduced by distributed quantum computing on multiple untangled quantum computers [55].\nNevertheless, this does not reduce the required qubit counts on quantum computer. In order to reduce qubit counts, we need to ensure that any two clusters do not share common qubit i.e. Hamiltonian of each cluster cannot be used to measure the same qubit. Since there are always Pauli words with small coefficients which play little role in final \u3008\u03c8(\u03b8)|H|\u03c8(\u03b8)\u3009, one can pretend they don\u2019t exists when constructing circuit thus partition qubits into several parts. If so, we can built several small and independent circuit and measure each cluster on distributed quantum computers with less qubits. The partitioning may follow the property of primal problem such as graph weight or the mutual information between clusters [73]. To minimize the performance loss introduced by partitioning, one can use dressed Hamiltonian in measuring [73] or include a fixing step as we discussed in Appendix B.\n15\nAppendix E: Details of numerical simulations\n1. Implementation details of QAOA2\nImplementation details of QAOA2. The QAOA used in QAOA2 are implemented by Pennylane [74]. In optimization, QAOA2 adopts the vanilla gradient descent method to update the trainable parameters of QAOAs in which the learning rate is set as 0.01. The number of shots of each circuit is set as 1000 to approximate the expectation value of the measurements in calculating gradients. In the process of sampling solutions, QAOA2 runs the optimized circuit for 1000 times to return the same number of bitstrings as solution candidates. To be more specific, in each run, all n qubits are measured by the computational basis along the Z direction and the measured result of each qubit is either +1 or -1. Thus an n-dimensional bitstring z \u2208 {+1,\u22121}n is sampled in one query of the circuit. We collect 1000 such bitstrings as candidates and select the one as solution whose corresponding eigenvalue is the smallest among the candidates.\nThe source code of QAOA2 is available at the Github Repository https://github.com/ZeddTheGoat/QAOA_in_ QAQA.\nGW algorithm. GW maps the primal integer programming to continuous vector space and optimizes it with semidefinte programming. The binary solution is obtained by projecting vectors to a plane. Our SDP solver is implemented by CVXPY [75], which uses SCS (Splitting Conic Solver) [76] following conventions. Here we adopt the default parameters in executing GW, where the max number of iterations is 2500, the convergence tolerance is 1e\u22124, the relaxation parameter is 1.8, and the balance between minimizing primal and dual residual is 5.0. After optimization, the solution is projected to 100 random vectors and rounded to bitstrings.\n2. More simulation results of QAOA2\nPerformance of QAOA2 with the advanced partition methods. We investigate how the advanced partition method, i.e., the greedy community detection introduced in Appendix B, effects the performance of QAOA2. To do so, we apply QAOA2 to two types of graphs, i.e., w3e-60 and w3e-80. To collect the statistical results, we generate 10 instances for each setting. The allowable number of qubits is n < 15. The implementation of the community detection method follows the algorithm proposed in [68], which is realized by NetworkX library [77].\nThe simulation results are showin in Fig. 6, where the performance of QAOA2 is dramatically increased when the random parition is replaced by the community detection. Specifically, for the 7-th instance of w3e-60 and the 4-th instance of w30e-80, the approximation ratio is increased by more than 0.3 compared to the random partition. Uder the measure of the modularities defined in Eq. A1, the achieved results of QAOA2 with the community detection strategy are all above 0.4. This indicates good partition, which implies that most edges are kept within subgraphs. By contrast, the modularities of QAOA2 with the random partition strategy are about 0. These observations accord with our conjecture in main text that the cut mainly comes from within subgraphs. The advanced partition strategy, e.g., the community detection, ensures the subgraphs as dense as possible and the number of edges left between subgraphs is minimized.\n16\nEffect of merging optimization. We next elucidate the importance of recasting the merging process as a new MaxCut problem used in QAOA2. Particularly, we conduct an ablation study by evaluating the performance of QAOA2 when the merging process is replaced by a naive heuristic, i.e., flipping non-local solutions as s = 1. To do so, we compare these two merging methods on udr-60, udr-80, ude-60 and ude-80 with d \u2208 [3, 9] and 10 instances per setting. The number of qubits is set as n < 10. The collected results are shown in Fig. 7. For almost all settings, QAOA2 outperforms the naive approach, except for u6r-80 and u5e-80. One possible reason is that local solutions is already good enough."
