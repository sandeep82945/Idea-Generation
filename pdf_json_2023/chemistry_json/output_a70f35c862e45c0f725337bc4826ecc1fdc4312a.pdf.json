With the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the incidence of complications of T2DM is also on the rise. Sitagliptin, as a targeted drug of DPP4, has good therapeutic effect for T2DM. It is well known that sitagliptin can specifically inhibit the activity of DPP4 to promote insulin secretion, inhibit islet b cell apoptosis and reduce blood glucose levels, while other pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear, such as improving insulin resistance, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-fibrosis. The aim of this study was to explore novel targets and potential signaling pathways of sitagliptin for T2DM.\nMethods: Firstly, network pharmacology was applied to find the novel target most closely related to DPP4. Semi-flexible molecular docking was performed to confirm the binding ability between sitagliptin and the novel target, and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) was carried to verify the stability of the complex formed by sitagliptin and the novel target. Furthermore, surfaceplasmon resonance (SPR) was used to explored the affinity and kinetic characteristics of sitagliptin with the novel target. Finally, the molecular mechanism of sitagliptin for T2DM was predicted by the enrichment analysis of GO function and KEGG pathway.\nResults: In this study, we found the cell surface receptor\u2015angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) most closely related to DPP4. Then, we confirmed that sitagliptin had strong binding ability with ACE2 from a static perspective, and the stability of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 complex had better stability and longer binding time than BAR708\u2015ACE2 in simulated aqueous solution within 50 ns. Significantly, we have demonstrated a strong affinity between sitagliptin and ACE2 on SPR biosensor, and their kinetic characteristics were \u201cfast binding/fast dissociation\u201d. The guiding significance of clinical administration: low dose can reach saturation, but repeated administration was needed. Finally, there was\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\ncertain relationship between COVID-19 and T2DM, and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis may be the important pathway of sitagliptin targeting ACE2 for T2DM.\nConclusion: This study used different methods to prove that ACE2 may be another novel target of sitagliptin for T2DM, which extended the application of ACE2 in improving diabetes mellitus.\nKEYWORDS\nACE2, sitagliptin, type 2 diabetes mellitus, network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, SPR"

            "text": "Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia caused by multiple causes, which can lead to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic complications (1). Diabetes has become a major global public health problem, seriously affecting people\u2019s daily life. In the world, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing year by year, and the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients (2, 3). At present, the drugs for T2DM are divided into two categories: traditional drugs (e.g., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, biguanides, and insulin) and new target drugs (e.g., multiple incretin agonists, glucokinase agonists, and glucagon receptor antagonists) (4).\nSitagliptin was approved by the Food andDrugAdministration (FDA) in 2006 and can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to treat T2DM and improve blood glucose control (5). It was the first dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitor for the treatment of T2DM, which mainly reduced the degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) by selectively inhibiting the activity of DPP4, thereby exerting hypoglycemic effect (6). DPP4, also known as CD26, was a 110 kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in various tissues (e.g., brain, endothelium, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, and lymphocytes) (7). GLP-1 was an endogenous physiological substrate of DPP4. GLP-1 mainly stimulated insulin secretion and inhibited glucagon secretion, thereby limiting postprandial blood glucose fluctuations. As a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake, it also inhibited gastrointestinal peristalsis and gastric acid secretion. GLP-1 secretion increased rapidly after meals, but about 75% of the secreted peptides were degraded by DPP4 on the lumen surface of endothelial cells, and only 25% reached the portal circulation. 50% of the remaining GLP-1 was further degraded under the action of liver DPP4 and soluble DPP4 (8). Therefore, DPP4 was closely related to T2DM, and we believed that finding\n02\nDPP4-related targets may provide a new idea for the development of T2DM targeted drugs.\nIn this study, we found a novel target of sitagliptin for T2DM closely related to DPP4 frommultiple databases, and explored the affinity and kinetics characteristics of sitagliptin and the novel target by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) approach, and predicted the molecular mechanism of sitagliptin in the treatment of T2DM by network pharmacology, which provided more feasible drug targets for T2DM."

Therefore, it was speculated that ACE2 may also be a novel target for sitagliptin in the treatment of T2DM.\n3.3 Static molecular modeling of BAR708\u2015ACE2 and sitagliptin\u2015ACE2\nBased on apo ACE2, we constructed a receptor model for ACE2 agonist with reference to the structure of BAR708\u2015ACE2 (22). Here, BAR708 was used as a positive control to verify the binding ability and binding mode between sitagliptin and ACE2 from a static perspective.\nFirstly, the crystal structure of ACE2 (PDB ID: 1R42) was downloaded from the RCSB PDB (https://www.rcsb.org/)\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 04\ndatabase (23, 24). We downloaded the molecular structure of sitagliptin from PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/) and converted it to a 3D structure file using OpenBabel software. The structure of ACE2 was processed by PyMOL software as follows: removing water, Cl-, and Zn2+, deleting irrelevant component structures (UNK, NAG), and extracting the original ligand BAR708 from BAR708\u2015ACE2. Then, we used AutoDockTools to process ACE2, BAR708, and sitagliptin, respectively. ACE2: adding hydrogen atoms, computing charges, assigning AD4 atom type, finding and merging nonpolar hydrogens, repairing amino acid residues, and saving them as PDBQT structural files. BAR708 and sitagliptin: adding hydrogen atoms, computing charges, setting rotatable chemical bonds, minimizing energy, and saving them as PDBQT structural files. The relevant parameters of the active pocket for molecular docking were determined with BAR708 as the center. The center coordinates were (72.554, 62.452, 41.772), the exhaustiveness of the program was 8, the number of modes was 9, and the maximum energy difference was 3. Here, we used AutoDock Vina software and python script to realize the molecular docking process.\nFIGURE 1 Venn graph of sitagliptin-related targets and T2DM-related targets.\nfrontiersin.org\nIn the molecular docking score, we obtained the best conformation of sitagliptin, and the score \u22128.7 kcal/mol was significantly better than \u22128.1 kcal/mol (BAR708). It is generally believed that the score is lower than \u22125 kcal/mol, indicating that a receptor has good binding ability with a ligand (25). As shown in Figure 3, the 3D structure of the results was displayed by PyMOL software, and the 2D structure was displayed by Discovery Studio 4.5 software. From the above figures, sitagliptin can be well embedded in the active pocket of ACE2, and the bonding types were mainly hydrogen bond, halogen bond and hydrophobic interaction. As an important index to measure the binding ability of proteins to small molecules, hydrogen bonds were included in the scope of this study. Among them, BAR708 formed hydrogen bonds with three amino acid residues (ASN210, LEU95 and GLN102), and sitagliptin formed hydrogen bonds with five amino acid residues (ASN210, ASP206, GLY205, GLU208 and TYR196). In short, sitagliptin had strong binding ability with ACE2.\n3.4 Dynamic molecular modelling of BAR708\u2015ACE2 and sitagliptin\u2015ACE2\nTo explore the stability of the complex structures formed by sitagliptin and ACE2, MD were performed using Gromacs software and program packages.\nWe used PRODRG server (http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac. uk/cgi-bin/prodrg) and gmx pdb2gmx program to generate ligand and receptor topology files respectively, and selected GROMOS96 43a1 force field to construct receptor-ligand complexes topology files (26). The gmx editconf and gmx solvate programs were used to construct dodecahedral boxes\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 05\nand SPC water models, respectively (26). Based on the gmx genion program, ions were added to ensure the electroneutrality of system. The steepest descent minimization method was performed to minimize the energy of system. The V-rescale coupling method was chosen to realize the balance of heat bath (NVT, Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature), and the following parameters were defined: the reference temperature was 300 K, the step length was 2 fs, and the running time was 100 ps. The Parrinello-Rahman coupling method was chosen to realize the balance of pressure bath (NPT, Number of particles, Pressure, and Temperature), and the running time was 100 ps (27). Particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was used to calculate the long-range electrostatic interaction; the cut-off algorithm was used to calculate the short-range electrostatic interaction, and the cut-off radius was 1.2 nm (28). Starting from the balanced result file of NPT, the MD time was set to 50 ns, and the trajectory file of the simulation operation was saved. The gmx grompp and mdrun programs were used to simulate the molecular dynamics of complex solution systems.\nFirstly, root mean square deviation (RMSD) can reveal the position change between real-time conformation and initial conformation of protein-ligand complex during MD simulation. The variation trend of RMSD for protein-ligand complex was an important characterization for judging the stability of MD simulation. As shown in Figure 4A, the backbone RMSD of BAR708\u2015ACE2 complex reached the maximum value of 0.38 nm at 19 ns, then stabilized around 0.31 nm, and the RMSD amplitude was less than 0.2 nm; the RMSD value of BAR708 reached the maximum value of 0.20 nm at 19 ns, although the RMSD value of BAR708 had large amplitude, it was still within 0.2 nm. As shown in Figure 4B, the backbone RMSD value of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 complex reached a stable state after 11 ns and was near 0.30 nm. During the MD time, the\nA B\nFIGURE 2 PPI network of potential targets.

Compared with BAR708\u2015ACE2 and sitagliptin\u2015ACE2, the stability of the complex formed by sitagliptin and ACE2 was the best, and the RMSD of the complex was close to that of the ligand, indicating that sitagliptin did not interfere with the stability of the complex. Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) showed the fluctuation amplitude of each atom relative to the average position. Here, RMSF was used tomeasure the flexibility of amino acid residues of receptor protein, and characterize the flexibility and motion intensity of amino acid residues in the whole simulation process. The larger the RMSF value, the more obvious the atomic free movement, indicating that the flexibility of amino acid residues was greater. Except for the N-terminus and Cterminus, the amino acid residues of BAR708\u2015ACE2 and sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 showed similar flexibility and motion intensity, so sitagliptin may activate the amino acid residues of ACE2 at active sites. The potential energy of SPC water model system constructed by sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 was approximately equal to that of BAR708\u2015ACE2, and was stable around \u22121.03e +006 kJ/mol. In addition, we extracted the conformation of the last frame of the sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 and BAR708\u2015ACE2 to\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 06\nexplore the energy decomposition of amino acid residues, respectively. The former showed better binding free energy distribution than the latter. The amino acid residues near the active sites had the greatest effect on the binding of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2. Hydrogen bond as an important indicator of binding capacity had been included in this study. The number and duration of hydrogen bonds in sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 were significantly higher than those in BAR708\u2015ACE2. Therefore, The MD results proved that sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 complex had good stability, and sitagliptin might have a longer binding time than BAR708\u2015ACE2."

The P values of GO functional items were sorted from small to large (Table S1), and the top 10 items were visualized by bioinformatics (Figure 6A).

            "text": "Diabetes and its complications bring great suffering to patients around the world, seriously affecting people\u2019s daily lives. Accordingly, diabetes related basic research is particularly important. This study explored new mechanisms and found new targets from old drugs, and provided new reference for the development of targeted drugs.\nThrough PPI network, we found that ACE2 had the greatest correlation with DPP4 from 35 potential therapeutic targets, so it was used as the research object for further research. Also, ACE2 and DPP4 were both cell surface receptor proteins, which increased the possibility of our speculation. Then, we used semi-flexible molecular docking technology to realize the virtual docking of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 and BAR708\u2015ACE2. The results showed that sitagliptin could well combine with ACE2, and could be well embedded in the active pocket. The main forces were van der Waals, conventional hydrogen bond, carbon hydrogen bond, halogen (fluorine), alkyl, pi-alkyl and pi-sigma. Furthermore, we usedmolecular dynamics simulation technology to further verify it.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 09\nCompared with BAR708\u2015ACE2, sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 had better stability, more hydrogen bonds and longer survival time of hydrogen bonds, whichwas consistent with the results ofmolecular docking. It can be seen fromFigure 4 that the changes of energy and RMSF value of the two complex systems were generally consistent, indicating that the biological effects of sitagliptin and BAR708 on ACE2 might be similar in the simulated real aqueous solution environment. In addition, in the free binding energy decomposition of the last frame conformation, it was found that the results in BAR708\u2015ACE2 were unsatisfactory, but the results in sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 performed better. ASP206 and GLU208 were beneficial to the binding of sitagliptin, while ARG219 and LYS562 showed that they were not conducive to the binding of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2. Interestingly, in the BAR708-ACE2 complex, Fiorillo also found that BAR708 bound to the backbone of GLU208 in a hydrogen bondmanner, which played an important role in the stability and activity of the complex (22). We also compared three different states of ACE2: natural opening (PDB ID: 1R42), inhibitor closure (PDB ID: 1R4L), and agonist opening (Figure S2). From the conformation of the last frame, therewas nomotion of subdomain I toward subdomain II in the presence of sitagliptin, and ACE2 still showed an open state.\nIn addition, we explored the affinity and kinetic characteristics of sitagliptin\u2015ACE2 by SPR assay analysis. The high-precision molecular interaction instrument (Biacore T200) provided reliable data support for this study. Figure 5 showed that there was a strong affinity between sitagliptin and ACE2, the response value of affinity was dose-dependent, and the kinetic characteristic was \u201cfast binding/fast dissociation\u201d. It was suggested that low-dose sitagliptin (about 6\u00d710\u22126 M) can achieve saturated efficacy and dissociate quickly, which may require repeated administrations.\nEnrichment analysis of GO function and KEGG pathway were performed on 35 potential targets, and a drug\u2015target\u2015signaling pathway\u2015disease network was constructed to find the action pathway of sitagliptin targeting ACE2 for T2DM: ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis in coronavirus disease\u2015COVID-19 signaling pathway.

Later studies have also shown that ACE2 also played an important role in liver, intestine and other organs. ACE2 was an enzyme on the cell surface, and it was proved to be a key receptor for SASRSCoV-2 invading the host cells (30). When SARS-CoV-2 invaded the host cells through ACE2, the biological activity of ACE2 in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was immediately lost, breaking the steady state of RAS and causing cardiovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 (31, 32). The S protein of coronavirus was a highly glycosylated glycoprotein with a trimer structure, which had three receptor-binding domains (RBD) in a closed state. In the open state, there was only one \u201cupward\u201d conformation of RBD, and the open state was the premise of SARS-CoV-2 fusion with the host cell membrane (33). SARSCoV-2 recognized and bound to the ACE2 through the RBD of its S1 subunit (34).\nAlso, some researchers found that the mortality of pulmonary infection in diabetic patients was significantly higher than that in non-diabetic patients, so they believed that there was a correlation between the severity of diabetes and\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 10\nCOVID-19 (35, 36). In diabetic state, hyperglycemia activates ACE in the myocardium, generated a large amount of angiotensin II (Ang II), which stimulated the proliferation of myocardial fibroblasts and collagen synthesis, eventually led to myocardial interstitial fibrosis. ACE2 was an ACE homologue discovered in recent years, which can hydrolyze Ang II to Ang(1\u20137) (37). ACE played a role in vasoconstriction and fibrosis by binding to AT1, resulting in a significant reduction in insulin secretion, inducing and aggravating diabetes. In contrast to its role was the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis, ACE2 catalyzed Ang II to generate Ang-(1-7), which bound to the MasR, increasing the release of NO by bradykinin. NO played a role in vasodilation, increased islet blood perfusion, thereby improving the blood supply of islets (38). MasR deficiency can lead to decreased expression of glucose transporter 4, decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased utilization of glucose in adipose tissue, and decreased tolerance to high glucose, thereby leading to glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and aggravating insulin resistance (39). Studies have shown that ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis can significantly improve liver insulin resistance (40). Ad-hACE2eGFP significantly improved fasting blood glucose, enhanced intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, increased insulin content and\nfrontiersin.org\nislet b cell proliferation, and reduced islet b cell apoptosis in 8- week-old db/db mice through Ang-(1-7)\u2013mediated pathways (41). In addition, the increased expression of ACE2 and Ang(1-7) can down-regulate the related inflammatory pathways through ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis, play a role in antiinflammatory and anti-fibrosis, and delay the process of diabetic nephropathy (42, 43). Also, the activation of ACE2/ Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis can promote the release of NO and improve oxidative stress to protect the renal vascular injury caused by diabetes (44). The results of the clinical trial showed that sitagliptin exerted pharmacological effects such as promoting insulin secretion (6), inhibiting islet b cell apoptosis (45), improving insulin resistance (46), antiinflammatory (47), anti-oxidative stress (48), and anti-fibrosis (49). It is well known that sitagliptin can specifically inhibit the activity of DPP4 to promote insulin secretion, inhibit islet b cell apoptosis and reduce blood glucose levels, while other pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear (6, 45). In this study, we found that there was a co-expression relationship between ACE2 and DPP4, with a similar protein expression profile (Figure 2). Sitagliptin may specifically stimulate the activity of ACE2 through ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis to promote insulin secretion, inhibit islet b cell apoptosis and reduce blood glucose levels, which may be synergistic with DPP4-related pharmacological activity. Also, sitagliptin may improve insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis through ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis to treat T2DM and its complications.\nIn conclusion, we confirmed that sitagliptin can bind to ACE2 and they belonged to \u201cfast binding/fast dissociation\u201d kinetic characteristics. ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis was predicted to be the important signaling pathway of sitagliptin targeting ACE2 for T2DM. This study extended the application of ACE2 as a drug target in the treatment of T2DM, based on which the development of drugs or dosage forms was a promising direction."
