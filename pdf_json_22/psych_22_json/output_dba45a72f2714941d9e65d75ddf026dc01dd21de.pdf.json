Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a 2-day school simulation exercise that randomized students to different masking recommendations. Parent-report of mental health and post-simulation child-report of COVID-19-related anxiety and mask-wearing were analyzed using descriptive and multiple regression analyses. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with older students to supplement questionnaire data. Results: Of 190 students in this study, 31% were in grade 4 or lower 95% looked forward to returning to in-person school. Greater child anxiety about COVID-19 was predicted by increased parent/caregiver anxiety (\u03b2=0.67; P<0.001), and lower parental educational attainment (\u03b2=1.86; P<0.002). Older students were more likely than younger students to report that mask-wearing interfered with their abilities to interact with peers (\u03c72(1)=31.16; P<0.001) and understand the teacher (\u03c72(1)=13.97; P<0.001). Students in the group that did not require masks were more likely than students in the masking group to report worries about contracting COVID-19 at school (\u03c72(1)=10.07; P<0.05), and anticipated difficulty wearing a mask (\u03c72(1)=18.95; P<0.001).\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Future research should examine the impact of prolonged implementation of public health mitigation strategies in school on academic achievement and children\u2019s mental health.\nKeywords: Children; COVID-19; Masks; Mental health; School reopening.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evoked unprecedented changes, eliciting mental health concerns for school-aged youth (1\u20133). Disease-containment measures during previous pandemics, such as quarantine, were associated with increased likelihood of post-traumatic stress disorder among parents and children (4). Early research from the pandemic has demonstrated worsened mental health among children, presumably as a result of diminished social and physical contact with others (5\u20138). Concerns regarding harms from school closures also include disruption to daily routines, including regular physical activity, sleeping schedules, and eating schedules, as well as from the suspension of school-based nutrition and mental health services, with children from low-income households and racial/ ethnic minority groups reportedly disproportionately affected (1,9\u201311).\nTo mitigate viral spread within schools, several health and safety measures, including the use of non-medical masks, have been recommended in schools. Canadian guidelines included the use of medical or cloth masks in schools for students in grade 1 and above, as well as teachers\u2019 masks (12,13). Minimal research has explored the psychological, social, and communication consequences of mask-wearing in schools (14). Extant research has suggested, however, that although masks may be effective in reducing viral spread among children, they may also impair face recognition, verbal and non-verbal communication, and emotion signalling between teacher and student (14). Our study sought to examine the experiences and perspectives of school-aged children about returning to school in September 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and about wearing masks in the classroom. Given indications of worsened anxiety and depression among children and adolescents following the onset of the pandemic (15), we also explored variables predicting worsening mental health symptoms.\nM ET H O D S"

The study was registered with full protocol on ClinicialTrials. net (#NCT04531254) and approved by the Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Board.\nAt the start of day 1, participants (parents or children) completed a pre-simulation questionnaire about underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma, inflammation), medications, allergies, and safety requirements, as well as parent and child concerns regarding COVID-19, public health measures for school reopening, and child mental health symptoms during the pandemic. Children were then randomized using\ncomputer-generated allocation assignment, stratified by age and sex, to either a Mask condition, where students always wore masks (except when eating/drinking) or No-Mask condition, where students did not wear masks (grade 4 and lower) or only wore masks when unable to maintain physical distance (>2 m) (grade 5 and above). There were two classrooms (i.e., a Mask classroom and a No-Mask classroom) for each grade level ( JK/SK, grades 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, 11/12), resulting in 14 classes in total. In all classes, teachers always wore masks and were provided optional face shields. Students and teachers completed the school simulation in their respective classrooms over 2 full days. These simulated school days were structured like typical school days, in which teachers instructed on standardized curriculum, children completed independent and group activities, and on-site breaks were taken for recess and lunch. At the end of day 2, students completed a self-report post-simulation questionnaire (all students) and semi-structured focus groups (grade 5 and above) about their experiences."

Child anxiety about contracting COVID19 at school was positively associated with parent/caregiver anxiety about COVID-19, irrespective of mask use (B=0.063; P=0.020). Greater parental anxiety about COVID-19 was associated with the presence of food insecurity (B=0.020; P=0.035).\nAttitudes toward school reopening and public health measures\nNearly all (95%) children reported looking forward to school, irrespective of grade (P=0.21) or mask use (P=0.32), supported by participant responses: \u2018I kind of stepped into the classroom, saw how far away the desks were, it felt pretty safe. [\u2026] I\u2019m excited to go back to school\u2019. Children\u2019s appraisal of mask use in post-simulation questionnaires varied by both grade and experience (Figures 1 and 2).

Of the 114 participants who reported worsened mental health, 30 (26%), 27 (24%), and 57 (50%) reported deterioration in one, two, or three domains, respectively. Figure 3 shows the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child mental health, by domain.\nChange in family financial circumstance during COVID-19, indicated by receiving government subsidies during COVID-19, was related to worsened child anxiety, (\u03c72(1)=4.79; P=0.029), mood (\u03c72(1)=11.55; P=0.001) and hyperactivity (\u03c72(1)=15.36; P<0.001). In addition, children with a pre-existing underlying medical condition were more likely to experience increased anxiety during the pandemic (\u03c72(1)=4.11; P=0.04).\nOf mental health domains, child anxiety about COVID19 was only associated with greater difficulty concentrating (B=0.04; P=0.008). Parent anxiety about COVID-19 was not associated with deterioration in any child mental health domain (all P values >0.13). Worsened mental health during the pandemic (deterioration in at least one domain) was not associated with post-simulation attitudes toward school reopening and public health measures (all P values >0.28).\nD I S C U S S I O N This study found that parental anxiety and lower parental education were associated with child anxiety about COVID-19. Despite anticipated or experienced difficulties of wearing masks in class, nearly all children in this study looked forward to returning to school. Older and No-Mask-group children were more likely than younger and Mask-group children to report expected or experienced difficulties with mask-wearing. The majority of children reported worsened mental health during the pandemic in at least one of five domains, associated with factors such as pre-existing medical concerns.\nGreater anxiety about COVID-19 was associated with lower parental educational attainment and food insecurity, both of which are potential indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage, and also associated with greater parental anxiety.

Given our findings, future work may consider the specific role of parental education in child anxiety associated with socioeconomic disadvantage. In addition, a recent study identified that anxiety about financial hardships during COVID-19 was higher among adults with children at home than among those without (23), suggesting that baseline anxiety levels among lower-income parents may be elevated during COVID-19 compared with higher-income parents, and that these effects may generalize to include anxiety about\nCOVID-19. Our findings are also consistent with pre-COVID research demonstrating the importance of parental anxiety in precipitating or perpetuating anxiety among children (24). The addition of parental anxiety management to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for children is more efficacious than CBT alone for children with anxiety disorders, particularly when increased parental anxiety is present (25). This suggests that parental anxiety may be a key target for child anxiety interventions during the pandemic and that COVID-19-specific education and support, particularly for families struggling financially, may be important to the well-being of children.\nn = 59\nn = 59\nn = 59\nn = 131 n = 131\nn = 131\nWearing a mask all day was/would be hard\nTalking and playing with my classmates while wearing a mask was/would be hard Understanding my teacher while she/he was wearing a mask was/would be hard\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nGrade \u2264 4\nGrade \u2265 5\nPost-Simula on Ques onnaire Item\nPe rc\nen t\nFigure 1.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report children\u2019s thoughts and feelings about mask-wearing in the classroom. Our findings are consistent with studies reporting that children experience social and communication difficulties when interacting with mask-wearing adult physicians (26\u201328). In post-simulation questionnaires, children in the Mask group were less likely than children in the No-Mask group to report worries about contracting COVID-19 at school, and to expect social and learning difficulties while wearing a mask at school, indicating that the reality of mask-wearing may be less problematic than children anticipate. Despite these group differences, however, focus group responses suggest that children in the Mask group also had significant concerns about wearing masks in class, and found that masks served as a barrier to communication, learning, and social connectivity (29). These findings highlight the importance of communication strategies that do not rely on facial expression in the classroom, including clear body language, dynamic storytelling, attention to humour and tone of voice, and of the value of teaching children to actively listen and articulating their thoughts and feelings clearly to be understood.\nThe majority of participants reported worsened mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in one or more domains, consistent with extant literature suggesting increased depressive and anxiety symptoms among children in general, and exacerbation of mental health symptoms among children with physical health concerns, during COVID-19 (15,30\u201332). In this study, worsened mental health during the pandemic was not associated with post-simulation attitudes toward school reopening and masking, although these attitudes would be interesting to revisit following a longer period of classroom mask implementation."

            "text": "As the school simulation study lasted for 2 days, the maskwearing period was brief relative to the reality of children\nreturning to school in Fall 2020, and thereby limits extrapolation to the non-simulation experience. Socioeconomically disadvantaged families were under-represented in the study sample, potentially limiting generalizability of findings. These limitations likely serve to underestimate the effect sizes related to indicators of economic disadvantage observed in the current study. Finally, the cross-sectional study design limits inferences regarding directionality of the associations observed."

Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating teaching and communication strategies that do not rely on facial expression in the classroom and while at school, and of exploring other public health mitigation strategies that do not obscure facial expression, such as transparent face shields or maintaining social distancing during instruction. Paediatricians and child health care providers may play a key role in educating anxious parents about the impact of their anxiety on their child\u2019s mental health (MH), educating families about COVID-19, and connecting anxious parents with MH resources. Future research, including longitudinal evaluation, should examine the impacts of prolonged implementation of these strategies in schools on academic achievement and children\u2019s mental health outcomes."
