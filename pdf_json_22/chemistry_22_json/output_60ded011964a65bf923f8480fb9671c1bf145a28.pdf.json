It relies on the formation and use of \u03b1-xanthyl-\u03b2-hydroxy ketones, which can be considered as synthetic equivalents of the high energy and difficult to tame alkenyl radicals. The process, which can often be accomplished one-pot, could be extended in one case to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester. \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated carbonyls, and enones in particular, are of paramount importance in organic synthesis because of their exceptionally rich chemistry and their central role in the planning and execution of total syntheses of natural products. Nonetheless, the facile creation of a new C-C bond in the \u03b1-C(sp) position to the carbonyl is a long standing problem, partially addressed by the pioneering work of Stork, Mukaiyama, Corey and Enders, Noyori and others. Although the modern toolbox for the \u03b1-substitution of enones has been expanded by the Morita-Baylis-Hillman and Rauhut-Currier reactions, 7 and Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings, both approaches suffer from significant drawbacks. The Morita-Baylis-Hillman and Rauhut-Currier reactions are usually limited to simple electrophilic coupling partners and their scope is therefore relatively narrow (Scheme 1a), whereas Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings require prefunctionalized substrates, often obtained by multi-step sequences, and involve expensive and sometimes also toxic reagents and substrates (Scheme 1b). This is for instance the case with the Stille coupling which involves organotin derivatives. Pd-catalyzed transformations are moreover generally better suited for the C(sp)-C(sp) and C(sp)-C(sp) than for C(sp)C(sp) couplings. The Negishi approach, for example, depends on the formation of organozinc intermediates from \u03b1-iodocycloalkenones (4, X = I), which are then coupled to alkenyl or aryl halides. Alternatively, \u03b1-iodocycloalkenones are coupled with alkenyl or alkynyl zinc partners 5 (Scheme 1b). Recently, the direct C-H \u03b1-arylation of enones via reductive iodonium Claisen rearrangement was reported; however, this reaction is restricted to aryl substituents. A radical route has also been explored, starting from \u03b1-iodocycloalkenes; but it also requires unpleasant organotin reagents and its scope is limited to a few activated alkenes. As a part of our work on the xanthate transfer methodology we devised synthetic equivalents to challenging radicals such as alkynyls. Following this line of investigation, we wondered if was possible to generate synthetic equivalents of sp-hybridised radicals from enones 1 via easily accessible \u03b1-epoxy ketones and thus provide a general solution to the problem of \u03b1-substitution of enones (Scheme 1c). The hydroxy group in the derived xanthate 8 would act as a dummy group, which would finally be eliminated to reform the double bond. This concept can be summarized as the formal fusion of enones 1 and alkenes 10 to produce substituted enones 11. Scheme 1. Routes to a-Substituted Enones To implement this approach, however, two major difficulties had to be overcome. As outlined in generic form in Scheme 2, opening of an \u03b1-epoxy ketone 12 by the xanthate salt would give initially \u03b1xanthyl-\u03b2-hydroxy ketone 8 via intermediate 13. Although, as far as we know, the reaction of \u03b1-epoxy ketones with xanthate salts has not been described previously, the opening of such epoxides with other nucleophiles, including thiolates, has been reported and shown to take place with the desired regiochemistry, but it is often followed by spontaneous dehydration to the enone. In the case of a xanthate, this would correspond to compound 14.

This is the first major hurdle. The second serious hurdle arises from the need to perform the addition under conditions that do not cause premature elimination of water from starting xanthate 8 to give \u03b1-xanthyl enone 14. This would indeed fatally harm our plans, precisely because generating high energy alkenyl radical 9 from \u03b1-xanthyl enone 14 is an uphill process. Elimination of water from adduct 19 would then provide enone 20, from which the xanthate group can be reduced off or further modified by ionic or radical processes. Thus, enone 20 would derive formally from the intermolecular addition of inaccessible (from xanthate 14) radical 9 to alkene 10. Scheme 2. Reaction of \u03b1-Epoxyketones with a Xanthate Salt\nWe began by studying the reaction of potassium O-ethyl xanthate with 2,3-epoxycyclohexanone 12a17 and were pleased to find that the desired xanthate 8a could indeed be isolated in 56% yield as a crystalline solid when the reaction was carried out between \u201340 oC and \u201310 oC (Scheme 3a). Scheme 3. Preparation and Reactivity of \u03b2-Hydroxy-\u03b1-Xanthyl Cyclohexanone 8a\nIt is worth noting that allowing the reaction mixture to warm to rt resulted in side reactions and ultimate decomposition of hydroxy xanthate 8a. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of the successful preparation of a \u03b2-hydroxy xanthate from an epoxyketone\nand a xanthate salt.18 Furthermore, hydroxy xanthate 8a was found to be stable in a neutral non-polar medium, undergoing a slow elimination of water only at elevated temperatures (>80 oC). This augured well for our ability to overcome the second major hurdle and accomplish the desired intermolecular radical additions. Indeed, this xanthate underwent a clean addition to allyl acetate, by a chain reaction initiated by dilauroyl peroxide (DLP, 20 mol%), to give adduct 19a in 93% yield. It was further possible to reductively remove the xanthate group without unwanted dehydration using tris(trimethylsilyl) silane (TTMSS) and AIBN as the initiator.19 The double bond was subsequently reformed by treatment with MsCl / DBU / Et3N to furnish \u03b1-substituted enone 11a in 79% yield over 3 steps (Scheme 3b).\nEncouraged by these preliminary findings, we proceeded to expand the substrate scope by reacting various epoxides with the xanthate salt (Figure 1). As expected, the addition of xanthate salt generally followed the same regioselectivity pattern, except for the epoxide derived from methyl viny ketone, which gave rise to two regioisomeric hydroxy xanthates 8e and 8f, with the latter (undesired) predominating slightly. They were, however, easy to separate by flash chromatography. We were also pleased to find, that \u03b2-substitution on the enone (methyl group) was tolerated and the tertiary alcohol product 8c did not undergo premature elimination. In the case of xanthate 8d derived from (\u2013)-carvone, the addition of BF3.OEt2 in dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent was necessary to induce regioselective ring opening of the epoxide. While it was possible to obtain the desired hydroxy xanthate 8b from \u03b1-epoxy-cycloheptanone in modest yield, the corresponding hydroxy xanthate (not shown) derived from \u03b1-epoxy-cyclopentanone proved too unstable and spontaneously dehydrated. Furthermore, the reaction of the xanthate salt with epoxides derived from methyl cinnamate and 5- methylhex-3-en-2-one also gave unstable vicinal hydroxy xanthates that underwent a retro-aldol reaction (See Supporting Information). Finally, xanthate 8g could be prepared from the epoxide derived from diethyl fumarate.\nUsing xanthate 8a as a model substrate, we conducted a screening of olefins as well as some optimization of the reaction conditions. We found that in some instances, e. g., with diethyl 2-allylmalonate (example 11g), the yield of the xanthate transfer was diminished, almost certainly because of a premature thermal elimination of water from xanthate 8a. We hence decided to switch to the milder conditions of photochemical initiation, using methodology previously developed independently by the groups of Miranda and Chiba,20a,b and earlier in a polymer context by Moad.20c We were glad to find, that in the presence of 1% of Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6 photosensitizer (PS), irradiation with a 440 nm Kessil lamp for 12 h of xanthate 8a and allyl acetate produced the corresponding adduct 20a in high yield (95%), without unwanted side products.

Interestingly, a small amount (6%) of enone 11a was\ndetected, indicating that elimination of water occurred spontaneously under these conditions. Indeed, when the reaction time was extended from 1 h to 3 h with altered ratios of reagents (See Supporting Information), the\nFigure 2. Scope of the xanthate route to \u03b1-substituted enones and enoates.\ndesired \u03b1-substituted enone 11a was the exclusive final product (83% yield). The three-step sequence can thus be performed in one pot and allows the transformation of \u03b2-hydroxy xanthates 8 directly into \u03b1-substituted enones 11.\nThe examples displayed in Figure 2 give an idea of the broad scope. In the case of 11a, a combination of DLP and isopropanol could also be used to reduce off the xanthate group.22The method further allows conjugation of an enone with fairly complex substrates such as an amino acid (11u), a fatty acid (11v), a glycosi de (11aa), a caffeine derivative (11ab) and a steroid (11ac). However, some alkenes possessing a tertiary alcohol group in the allylic position did not react in desired fashion, with only starting materials recovered\n(see Supporting Information). In all cases, the reaction sequence can be stopped at any stage, if the xanthate adduct 19 or the \u03b2-hydroxyketone 21 is the desired product instead of the \u03b1-substituted enone 11.\nThe procedure was extended to other b-hydroxy xanthate derivatives (Figure 2, II). The cycloheptanone derived xanthate 8b proved to be a competent substrate for the thermally initiated radical fusion with allyl acetate (11ae, 48% over 2 steps) as well as for the photochemically induced addition to allyl phosphonate, giving rise to \u03b1substituted enone 11af in 42% yield (modified one pot procedure). In the case of the initial adducts from 8b, the in-situ spontaneous water elimination process was slower and less efficient as it required 4- 5 h heating. The carvone derived xanthate 8d added to vinyl pivalate to give \u03b2-hydroxyketone 21e in 52% yield over 2 steps (compounds 21b-e are described in the SI).

Methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) derived xanthate 8e reacted with allyl acetate under thermal initiation with DLP, but the yield was somewhat diminished (11ag, 34% addition-reduction sequence / 56% elimination). Switching to the photochemical one pot process allowed the fusion of 8e and allyl phosphonate in 50% overall yield (11ah). This strategy is not limited to ketones, as demonstrated by the maleate derived xanthate 8g. In this case, spontaneous elimination did not take place under our conditions and the stepwise sequence of mesylation and elimination was necessary to produce substituted fumarates 11ai and 11aj, interestingly as single geometrical isomers.\nWe also found that the method allows the functionalisation of methyl \u03b2-substituted enones, which are beyond the scope of the MBH reaction. Radical addition from 8c followed by the OH elimination gave products 11ak in 45%/71% yield and 11al in 44%/90% yield (addition-reduction/eliminaton). Here the xanthate transfer was somewhat less efficient then in case of \u03b2-unsubstituted substrates, probably due to steric effects. Surprisingly, the OH-elimination did not occur spontaneously under our one-pot conditions and it required a separate step, namely heating with boric acid. Although the yields are moderate, the reaction allows the formation of \u03b1,\u03b2- disubstituted enones, which are quite difficult to prepare by any known method. Scheme 4. Scaled-up Experiment\nFinally, the process can be conducted on a synthetically significant scale (Scheme 4). Thus, the reaction between 8a and diethyl allylphosphonate was performed on 2 mmol scale and afforded enone 11f in 65% yield.\nIn summary, we have developed an efficient radical approach for the formal \u03b1-substitution of enones. Our route is particularly well adapted for introducing functionalized aliphatic side chains and complements transition metal catalyzed couplings which are best suited for C(sp2)-C(sp2) and C(sp2)-C(sp) assemblies. The simplicity and scalability of the procedure, the cheapness of the reagents (the iridium complex is not indispensable) and the modularity of the process are further significant advantages."
