    "abstractText": "This paper presents design methods for highly efficient optimisation of geometrically shaped constellations to maximise data throughput in optical communications. It describes methods to analytically calculate the information-theoretical loss and the gradient of this loss as a function of the input constellation shape. The gradients of the mutual information (MI) and generalised mutual information (GMI) are critical to the optimisation of geometrically-shaped constellations. The analytically derived gradients of the achievable information rate metrics with respect to the input constellation are presented. The proposed method allows for improved design of higher cardinality and higher-dimensional constellations for optimising both linear and nonlinear fibre transmission throughput. Near-capacity achieving constellations with up to 8192 points for both 2 and 4 dimensions are presented. In the best case, a GMI value within 0.06 b/2Dsymbol of the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN) capacity was achieved. Additionally, a design algorithm reducing the design computation time from days to minutes is introduced, allowing for the design of optimised constellations for both linear AWGN and nonlinear fibre channels over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio values.",

INTRODUCTION\nTHERE is renewed interest in the use of capacity-approaching constellation shaping to further increase the throughput and reach of optical fibre communication systems while providing finer granularity flexible rates.

There have been noteworthy results achieved employing constellation shaping in the optical fibre channel using PS [1], [2], GS [3], [4], [5] and hybrid combinations of both PS and GS [6]. To maximise the benefits from shaping, the cardinality can be increased to have a greater impact on system performance. When the optimum is not known, the numerical optimisation of the constellation shape to maximise the information rate in a given channel becomes rapidly infeasible as constellation size and dimensionality increase. Larger constellations allow for more degrees of freedom when shaping a constellation for the channel, but that comes at the expense of increased computational complexity. To address this, machine learning has been moderately successful in the design of GS constellations [7], [8], [9], to minimise information-theoretical loss, and maximise potential data throughput. In these papers, the machine learning framework is used to obtain an objective function for the increase of performance of the constellation being designed, for which a gradient descent strategy is then employed.\nMultiple approaches have been considered. Amongst them is a gradient descent for method the design of tailored probability mass functions for PS constellations for fibre nonlinearity tolerance [10], [11], [12], [13]. Similarly, GS constellations have been designed for fibre nonlinearity [14], [15], [16] or laser phase noise tolerance [17]. However, in general, the optimum geometric constellation shape for such a channel is still not known.\nIn the case of GS constellation design, the complexity dramatically increases with constellation order. Both the evaluation of the MI function and the calculation of the gradient function scale poorly with the number of constellation points, making the optimisation of multi-dimensional and/or high-order constellations prohibitively time-consuming. A contributing factor in this is the requirement to compute the gradient of the MI or generalised mutual information (GMI) using exploratory steps, i.e., one MI or GMI calculation for each constellation point; an already costly calculation whose complexity scales rapidly with the number of constellation points.

Although this method greatly simplifies the problem, the design of a constellation within a single orthant still requires a computationally expensive step for every constellation point within the orthant and, therefore, will ultimately severely constrain the maximum order of the constellations that can be designed.\nThis paper presents a method to analytically calculate the information-theoretical loss and the gradient of this loss as a function of the input constellation shape. The gradients of the MI and GMI are critical to the optimisation of geometrically-shaped constellations. In the process of numerical optimisation, the gradient provides a direction in which to increase or decrease the objective function. While the resulting constellations are not guaranteed to be optimal, significant improvements can be obtained.\nUsually, the gradients are calculated using a finite difference method, where for every constellation point the cost function is re-evaluated with a small but finite difference to estimate the partial derivative. However, this method scales poorly with an increasing number of constellation points, resulting in an infeasibly complex task for large cardinality constellations, e.g., constellations with more than 1024 points. A more efficient method is to use automatic differentiation [18], [19]. Automatic differentiation offers faster numerical gradient calculation than the finite difference methods, albeit in general not as fast as calculating the gradient analytically. In this paper, the loss gradient is calculated analytically, an approach that has only been used for bit-error rate (BER) [20] and has, to date, never been applied in optical communications and never used for GMI. Using the analytical expressions for these gradients speeds up the optimisation process by a factor corresponding to the constellation cardinality, i.e., only one calculation is needed for the whole constellation instead of a calculation for each constellation point separately, and is, therefore, an invaluable method for constellation design.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section II, the optimisation problem is introduced and, in Section II-D, the optimisation method used in this work is shown. In Section III, an efficient gradient calculation in introduced. Then, in Section IV, the gradient is extended to account for the nonlinearity of the fibre channel. After which, in Sections V and VI, we present results obtained using the algorithms shown in this work for the AWGN channel and the nonlinear fibre channel, respectively, with the conclusions in Section VIII."

We use lowercase letters (e.g. x) and underlined lowercase letters (e.g. x) for ordinary scalar and vector variables, respectively. Matrices are denoted by boldface letters, e.g. x or I . In particular, the matrix containing the M possible constellation symbols coordinates is denoted as x = [x1, . . . , xM ]\nT where the constellation symbol xi = [xi,1, xi,2, . . . , xi,2N ] represents the location of the i-th point in 2N real dimensions, where N represents the number of phase and amplitude pairs. To denote a set we use a calligraphic letter, J = {1, . . . ,M} is the set of all M indices and J\u0303n = J \\ {n} = {j \u2208 J ; j = n} is the set of all indices excluding n. To denote a subset of constellation points we use the boldface subscripted notation xS = [xi1 , . . . , xiQ ]\nT where S = {i1, . . . , iQ} is the set of indices selecting the constellation symbols. Let ||x||F = \u221a\u2211M i=1 \u22112N j=1 ||xi,j ||2 be the Frobenius norm of matrix x {xi,j} [21, p. 55].

When function f(x) : RM \u2192 R maps to a real scalar, then the gradient is defined as \u2207f(x) = JHf (x). Let (f \u25e6 g)(x) = f(g(x)) be a composition of two functions f(x) and g(x). Then, the Jacobian is defined as Jf\u25e6g(x) = Jf (g(x))Jg(x). If function g(x) maps a vector to a vector, the Jacobian is a matrix.

The transmitted symbols, denoted by the row vector xi of x, are uniformly distributed, i.e., fX(xi) = 1/M .\nThe other channel we consider is the nonlinear fibre channel. The channel is modelled as an AWGN channel whose noise power is dependent on the physical properties of the fibre transmission system, optical transmitted signal power and the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise power [22], [23]. Additionally, the modulation format used for transmission impacts the noise power, following [24], [25], and the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of an optical fibre channel at optimum launch power can be predicted as\nSNR = P\nPASE + \u03b7totP 3 (4)\n\u03b7totP 3 \u2248 (\u03b71 + \u03b72\u03a6(X))P 3 (5)\nSNRopt \u2248\n( 1\n2\u03b71 PASE\n(1+ \u03b72 \u03b71 \u03a6(X))\n) 1 3\nPASE + PASE 2\n, (6)\nwith the nonlinear coefficients \u03b71 and \u03b72, the launch power P , ASE noise power PASE and the excess kurtosis \u03a6(X) E[|X|4] E[|X|2]2 \u2212 2 of the complex constellation. A closed form equation for \u03b71 can be found in [26, Eq. (5,10,11)] and \u03b72 can be found in [27, Eq. (16)].\nTo simplify the expression for the performance of a optical transmission system given a transmitted constellation, the dependence on ASE noise power cancels out when describing the expression as a ratio of the optimum SNR of the input distribution and a reference distribution. Effectively lumping the channel description into two terms. Although any reference distribution can be chosen, the Gaussian distribution has zero excess kurtosis, i.e.,\u03a6(XGaussian) = 0, and simplifies the expression even further. The ratio between the optimum SNR for the input distribution X and the reference distribution Xref is then given as\nSNRopt SNRopt,ref\n= (1 + c\u03a6(X))\u2212 1 3\n(1 + c\u03a6(Xref)) \u2212 13\n(7)\nSNRopt = (1 + c\u03a6(X)) \u2212 13 SNRopt,Gaussian , (8)\nwith SNRopt,Gaussian = ( 12\u03b71\nPASE) 1 3\n3 2PASE\nand eta-ratio c = \u03b72\u03b71 . Equa-\ntion (8) is used to predict the change in SNR when constellation X is used compared to a reference constellation. This means, the channel performance as a function of the constellation is fully described with only SNRopt,ref, \u03a6(Xref) and c. This expression will be used in Section IV-B to modify the signal power, effectively changing the SNR as a function of the constellation. Note that, if the modulation format changes, the launch power also changes to the optimum launch power for the new constellation and the other channel parameters remain the same; (8) can be used to calculate the change in effective SNR. Therefore, the behaviour of the constellations designed for this channel is given by this compact expression, describing the channel with only\nthe eta-ratio c and the SNR at optimum launch power when a reference distribution is transmitted."

(9)\nFor transmitting and receiving symbols, the MI gives the maximum amount of information, measured in bits per symbol, that we can decode reliably.\nIn the case of a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) scheme, the GMI is a more appropriate measure as it predicts the performance of forward error correction (FEC) schemes [30]. To calculate the GMI, the sum of the mutual information between the input bits Ck and received symbols Y is used. Let m = log2(M) be the number of bits transmitted per symbol, a vector of m bits ci = [ci,1, . . . , ci,m]\nT is mapped to a corresponding symbol xi.

The decoder output is here assumed to contain independent errors after the use of an ideal interleaver. The BER is obtained with error counting after the soft-decision FEC decoder. In the remainder of this paper, this rate is used as a performance metric, together with MI and GMI.\nWe use MI and GMI to refer to the quantities defined in (9) and (10), respectively.

In this work,we focused on the trust-region algorithms [36], [37], [38] where the Jacobian of the Jacobian, known as the Hessian, is estimated using a symmetric rank-one method [39] as described in [40], p. 146]. The optimisation step is described by\nxk+1 = xk + sk , (12)\nwhere xk is the constellation at step k and the update sk is determined by the trust-region sub-problem defined as\nmin sk\nfk + g T k sk +\n1 2 sTkBksk\ns.t. ||sk|| \u2264 \u0394k , (13) where fk is the function value, gk is the gradient and Bk the inverse of the Hessian at xk. The trust region \u0394k limits the size of the step sk which shrinks as we get close to optimum by the algorithm. We initialise this parameter of the algorithm as 1. For this method, we need an accurate gradient as it is used for both the step and the Hessian estimation. The next step is to solve the step sub-problem (13), for which we use Steihaug\u2019s conjugate gradient method [41]. The sub-problem is a simpler problem and easier to optimise than the entire optimisation problem and the sub-problem is solved at every step. Finding a solution for the sub-problem is often less computationally expensive than a single gradient calculation of the AIR with respect to the input constellation. A fast trust-region optimisation algorithm is possible via the improvements proposed in Section III, where we describe the efficient gradient calculation proposed in this work."

            "text": "One of the difficulties of calculating the gradients of MI and GMI is that, for a fixed AWGN variance, the input constellation needs to be constrained to constant average power. The most straightforward approach to constellation optimisation is to use the finite-difference method, renormalising the constellation after every finite-difference exploration step for the gradient calculation. However, the renormalisation has the consequence that, without extra manipulation, the entire objective function needs to be recalculated, for every constellation point, for every dimension. This is because, if the location of a single constellation point is changed, all the points need to be rescaled to maintain the same average power.\nIn this work, we propose an efficient method of obtaining the gradient by splitting the problem into two functions in a composition. The first function normalises the constellation \u2014 that is, it takes the constellation points as an input and outputs a vector of normalised constellation points. The output of the first function is then passed to a function that is either an unconstrained MI or GMI function.

When calculating the AIR for the nonlinear fibre channel, the performance of the constellation is evaluated at optimum launch power. Assuming a known SNR for a reference constellation at know launch power, the constellation can be scaled to reflect the SNR change due to the fibre nonlinearity compared to the reference constellation. For convenience, a Gaussian distribution is used as the reference constellation, as shown in (8). The AIR can then be calculated using either (14) or (22) with the scaled constellation as the input.

Restrictions apply.\nnot have a linear optimisation trajectory, but the optimisation does result in a regular-looking constellation. For the example constellation, the result resembles an amplitude and phase-shift keyed (APSK) constellation where the inner amplitude ring has two constellation points for every value of phase shift.\nNext, we describe at the results for 2D and 4D geometrically shaped constellations for the AWGN channel. To obtain these results, we followed the trust-region method of Section II-D with the GMI gradient in (26) and the normalisation for the AWGN channel (27). The optimisation is carried out by starting with different initial constellations. Two fixed constellations; namely, a regular QAM constellation and one designed following [43], as well as randomly generated starting points. In the optimisation, symmetry around every axis was imposed, akin to the binary reflected Gray code (BRGC), so that the most significant bit describes which half of the plane the constellation point is in and the other half of the points are a mirrored copy. As both the regular QAM and the constellations from M\u00e9ric [43] already meet these requirements, these constellations can be directly used as a starting point for these optimisations. We have found the solutions with these constraints performed equally well as solutions that allowed asymmetries in the region where the MI/GMI are close to the maximum entropy of the constellations. By using (31), we can obtain more accurate gradients with fewer iterations. This allows the optimisation of high cardinality constellations, which in this paper were selected to be up to 8192 points.\nA. 2D Constellations Shaping for the AWGN Channel\nThe performance of the geometrically shaped 2-dimensional (GS-2D) constellations tailored to the AWGN channel is shown in Fig. 2 and is illustrated in terms of gap to AWGN capacity at the SNR the constellation is optimised for. The optimisation was performed for m = 3, 4, . . ., 13, and for integer values of SNR in the range shown. It can be seen that the performance of highercardinality constellations in terms of gap to capacity improves\ncompared to the results obtained for lower-order modulation formats.\nThe capacity of the AWGN channel is log2(1 + SNR) bit/2D [28]. One would expect the MI and GMI to grow in line with the capacity until the throughput is limited by the cardinality of the constellation. Therefore, before saturation is reached the gap between GMI and the AWGN capacity falls within a relatively small range compared to the achieved GMI. Showing the performance of the optimised constellations as the gap to the AWGN capacity improves the presentation of the results, plotted over a wide range of SNRs.\nIn Fig. 3, the performance of the 2-dimensional optimised constellation is shown for the highest cardinality constellation\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Eindhoven University of Technology. Downloaded on November 09,2022 at 13:20:44 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nM = 8192 investigated in this work. This performance is compared to the one of benchmark constellations such as square QAM, Sun-Tilborg [44] and M\u00e9ric constellations [43], the latter two being capacity-approaching in terms of MI. The cardinality of the benchmark constellations was varied based on the selected SNR (up to M = 8192) and the performance of the resulting envelopes is shown in Fig. 3. The MI for uniform \u221e-QAM is shown as a reference and it can be seen that it saturates to the 1.53 dB (0.51 b) gap [45]. The optimised M = 8192 gives the best performance of all cardinalities considered. For the optimisation method presented in this paper, the higher cardinality constellation will always achieve the performance of a lower cardinality constellation by taking the lower cardinality constellation and doubling each constellation point (two constellation points having the same coordinates), effectively ignoring the transmitted bit which selects between two constellation points with identical coordinates. It can be seen that the optimised constellations from this work outperform all other constellations in terms of GMI for all SNR values between 0 and 30 dB. The GMI of our optimal constellation also outperforms the MI of uniform\u221e-QAM for SNR >7 dB.\nB. 4D Constellations Shaping for the AWGN Channel\nThe significant improvements in computation efficiency now allow us to extend the optimisation of constellations for the AWGN channel to 4D, something which has been challenging to achieve to date. In Fig. 4, the results of optimising constellations for the 4D AWGN channel are shown. The results follow a similar trend to the results presented for 2D, however, we can see that a cardinality of 8192 is not enough to decrease the gap to capacity for higher SNR values.\nNext, we compare the performance of the designed constellations with the recently published 4D constellation with symmetry constraints, presented in [16], which the authors named orthant symmetric (OS). The authors showed how it was possible\nto reduce the 128-ary constellation to just 5 variables. The 128\u00d74 variables describing all points in all dimensions were reduced to 32 by enforcing symmetry and that subspace was then intuitively spanned using 5 variables. In contrast, the method introduced in this paper greatly improves the efficiency of the constellation design and allows the optimisation of all variables within the orthant. In the case of 128 constellation points this is 32 points with 4 dimensions each, totalling 128 variables.\nFor this comparison we used the same simulation parameters from [16]; split-step Fourier method (SSFM) simulation [46] of 80-km fibre spans with 100 logarithmically distributed steps, 0.21 dB/km attenuation, chromatic dispersion of 16.9 ps/(nm \u00b7 km) with a nonlinear coefficient \u03b3 of 1.32 /(W \u00b7 km), amplified with a 4.5 dB noise figure optical amplifier. The transmitted signal consisted of 11 channels of 45 Gbd, spaced at 50 GHz. All transmitted channels had different randomly generated data and only the centre channel was demodulated. A root-raised cosine filter with 1% roll-off was used for matched filtering. The fibre propagation was emulated by using the SSFM with a fixed step size of 100 m. The post-FEC results were obtained using the R = 4/5 DVB-S2 low-density parity check (LDPC) decoded with 200 iterations. For each point, the optical launch power was swept in steps of 0.5 dB to find the maximum SNR as a function of distance.\nThe performance of the resulting geometrically shaped 4- dimensional (GS-4D) constellation is shown in Fig. 5. We can see that the additional freedom from optimising all points in the orthant individually allowed our constellation to outperform the constellation obtained using the approach in [16], albeit by a small margin (0.033 b/4Dsym) or 120 km; a similar observation to that made by the authors in [16]. The results are shown in terms of both BER and GMI. For the BER a post-FEC curve is shown where the R = 4/5 LDPC from [47] is applied.\nHowever, because the optimisation in this work does not rely on higher-order symmetry to reduce the number of optimisation variables and it is significantly more computationally efficient to optimise, we can now optimise constellations with a large number of constellation points. In Fig. 6, the results using the same simulation system for a greater number of constellation points are shown. The orthant symmetry is kept as the lower SNRs does not result in worse performance. The results are shown in terms of both BER and GMI; for the BER a postFEC curve is shown for a R = 4/5 LDPC code from [47]. The performance of the LDPC-coded scheme is shown in terms of R\u2217 from (11). We can see that for constellations with a number of points ranging from 32 to 8196 in 4 dimensions, we have successfully designed constellations targeting the R = 4/5 rate. The R\u2217 saturates at mR for shorter distances until it reaches the GMI. Additionally, the 4096-ary constellation from this optimisation is used in Section VI, where it is compared against other constellations with the same number of bits per dimension in Fig. 8."

The results shown were calculated using the same SSFM simulation setup as described in Section V-B. The constellations were designed to maximise the trade-off between shaping gain and nonlinear distortion. This was achieved by numerical optimisation, again using the trust-region algorithm, using (34) as the objective function. The eta ratio cwas estimated to be around 0.4, established by fitting the performance difference between quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) transmission and transmission where the sequence was drawn from a normal distribution as the reference distribution. These results present a range of constellations for a fixed eta ratio since the performance increase is not guaranteed if this changes. For a given system, where the length, number of amplifiers and spectral neighbours are fixed, these constellations show an improvement in performance. The lower cardinality constellations perform better for longer distances and saturate for shorter distances. The GMI saturates to m, the R\u2217 saturates to mR. At the target reach, the R\u2217 gets close to the GMI, this is the SNR for which the constellations were optimised.\nThe comparison of the different strategies investigated in this paper is shown in Fig. 7 evaluated using the SSFM as described previously. This figure shows the performance of 4 different formats, namely the regular square QAM, 2D and 4D constellations optimised for the AWGN channel and a 2D constellation optimised with the same number of bits per 4 dimensions, in terms of the trade-off between the linear and nonlinear shaping gain. All curves saturate for shorter transmitted distances, the GMI atm = 12 bit/4D and the R\u2217 at mR = 9.6 bit/4D. The first result shown is regular QAM. Following this, the 2D constellation shaped for AWGN is presented, which exhibits better performance. The 2D constellation shaped for the linear/nonlinear trade-off has a slightly better performance. The 4D constellation for AWGN has the best performance in terms of AIR. it should be noted that although it does not show the best performance in terms of SNR, it results in a higher AIR or throughput, in terms of GMI, through the resultant shaping gain. The nonlinear performance metrics presented in this paper are only valid for 2D constellations and, therefore, applying these metrics to the 4D constellation yielded no further performance improvements and the reason why is the subject of current research [42]. It can be seen, however, that all\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Eindhoven University of Technology. Downloaded on November 09,2022 at 13:20:44 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

The R\u2217 shows that the GS-4D-4096 has a reach increase of 2 spans, whereas the GS-2D and the GS-NL-2D show a reach increase of more than 1 span, where after 1440 km transmission, the GS-NL-2D outperforms the GS-2D by 0.4 b/4D.\nThe performance in terms of SNR for each constellation, is shown in Fig. 9. With the SNR results, we can explain some of the performance differences in Fig. 7. The results also show the SNR for QPSK and Gaussian modulation for comparison, as these represent the reasonable best and worst nonlinear channel\nresponses, respectively. For the reference case of Gaussian modulation, the transmitted sequence was generated with samples taken from a normal distribution, treated as symbols.\nThe effect of each constellation format on the nonlinear performance can be observed. As expected, the square QAM performed the best and the GS-2D constellation shaped for the AWGN channel performs the worst with 0.1 dB between them. However, the GS-2D constellation still outperformed the square QAM by at least one span or 0.1 b higher GMI.\nIt can be seen that the GS-4D constellation has the best performance overall. The constellation exhibits very good nonlinear performance despite not being optimised for nonlinearity, increasing the SNR at optimum launch power. Together with excellent shaping gain from the additional degrees of freedom, this 4D AWGN-optimised constellation was the best performer in our selection.\nFor the case of the GS-NL-2D constellation, shaped using (34) as optimisation function, the nonlinear SNR penalty was reduced to a value close to that of the square 64-QAM whilst retaining shaping gain. The loss in shaping gain is more than offset by the improvement of the nonlinear channel response.\nThe drawback of the 4D constellation is that it requires a 4D demapper, meaning that instead of 2\u00d764 2D distances, 4096 4D distances must be evaluated; a factor of 64 increase in the number of points and a factor of two again for the doubling in the number of the dimensions per constellation point. The choice of constellation thus becomes a trade-off between performance and complexity.\nIn Fig. 10, the geometrically shaped constellations are compared at the transmission distance of 1440 km. Here the launched power is swept and it can be seen that the optimum launch power is close to 0.5 dBm per channel used previously. The GS-NL-2D constellation outperforms the GS-2D even when the GMI is lower, suggesting that resulting LLRs result in better LDPC performance, although more research is necessary to reach a conclusion on that.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Eindhoven University of Technology. Downloaded on November 09,2022 at 13:20:44 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nThe choice between the GS-2D and GS-NL-2D would then depend on the system\u2019s operational consideration. When a system is expected to be fully loaded, the lesser impact on neighbouring channels of the GS-NL-2D may be attractive. When the system is expected to operate more sparsely, with lower nonlinear interaction between channels, the improved performance through maximising shaping gain with GS-2D can prove to be more beneficial. Ideally, this change should be applied in an adaptive manner, in response to the change in system conditions such as demand, transmission distances and the number of occupied wavelength channels."

            "text": "Whilst we optimise the geometry of the constellation, all constellation points influence each other and the performance of the constellation as a whole is measured by a single scalar metric, i.e., the MI or GMI. That means the objective function can be seen as a function that takes in an M \u00d7 2N matrix and outputs a scalar value. For some optimisation techniques, it is convenient to re-shape the input as a vector, this way the gradient and Hessian are defined.\nThe slowest operation in the calculation is the evaluation of (17) and the summation for GHQ. Fortunately, calculating the gradient in addition to the function does not require additional evaluations of (17), just an additional summation for the GHQ. This makes the evaluation of the function and gradient approximately two times slower than just evaluating the function. To investigate the scaling of the computational complexity, we can simply count how many times (17) is evaluated. For the MI, it is calculated for every i and every j multiplied by the number of points used for the GHQ. Therefore, if we have M constellation points and L GHQ points per dimension, the computational complexity scales withO(M2 \u00d7 L2N ). For GMI, the complexity scales with O(M2 \u00d7 L2N + log2(M)\u00d7M \u00d7 M2 \u00d7 L2N ). When increasing the number of dimensions, the number of constellation points must grow exponentially with the number of dimensions if the number of bits per dimension is to remain\nconstant. If we define m\u0302 = log2(M)N as the number of bits per 2 dimensions, then the GMI scales with O((2m\u03022N + m\u0302N \u00d7 2m\u03024N )\u00d7 L2N ).\nTypically, the gradient of the function can be calculated using the finite difference method, which allows to obtain numerically the gradient for optimisation. For a single input and a single output, [48, Ch. 25] provides an expression for the calculation of finite differences. The derivative of a function g at a point x is approximated via the finite-difference method (g(x+ h)\u2212 g(x))/h for some small value of h. When the function takes multiple inputs, the procedure is repeated for every input variable. It is important to note that this method requires an extra function evaluation for every component of the input space. This will quickly become unfeasible; for example, optimising a 4D 4096-QAM constellation requires 4\u00d74096 = 16384 evaluations of the objective function.\nOur method, combining the normalisation with the objective function of the optimisation, allows us to use unconstrained optimisation methods. This is superior to using the MI or GMI with respect to an input constellation directly as an objective function and prevents the constellation amplitude from growing using a power constraint in the optimisation. This allows us to use unconstrained quasi-Newton optimisation algorithms, as shown in Fig. 11. In this example, 1024 QAM was optimised for the AWGN channel starting from an APSK constellation described in [43]. Another benefit of combining the gradient and channel constraint function this way is that it allows the channel function to include other channel effects, for example residual phase noise or device nonlinearities, beyond optical transmission systems."

Downloaded on November 09,2022 at 13:20:44 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply.\nWe proposed the use of an analytically derived gradient, instead of the conventionally-used finite-difference method, significantly reducing the complexity of numerical optimisation. Additionally, we combined the gradient of the mutual information with the Jacobian of the channel constraints, translating the problem into an unconstrained optimisation problem. We have successfully applied this technique to both linear and nonlinear optical communication systems.\nWe applied the proposed algorithms to show shaping gain for high cardinality 2- and 4- dimensional constellations, to generate geometrically shaped constellations, with up to 8192 constellation points. An 8192-ary constellation achieving a GMI with a gap of just 0.06 b/2D to the AWGN channel capacity was designed, with the gains in mutual information verified using a simulation of a nonlinear optical fibre communication system, exhibiting shaping gains in both the linear and nonlinear regimes.\nAlthough the focus of this paper is on optical communications, the same approach can be applied more generally to design and optimise a wide range of other communication systems operating in the linear and nonlinear regimes."

            "heading": "APPENDIX B OPTIMISATION ALGORITHM",
            "text": "The optimisation algorithm consists of two parts, first the initial constellation and second the trust-region optimisation. We found that generating a few constellations as a starting point, optimising them with the trust-region algorithm until the selected stopping condition is reached, and keeping only the best performing constellation gave good results.\nFor the initial constellation, there are a few options. First, there is the use of the known \u2018good\u2019 constellations and binary labellings. Herein we have used square QAM and constellations proposed in [43]. Alternatively, a lattice or a randomly generated constellation using a Gaussian prior as starting points were also used in this work. When using randomly assigned bit labels the optimisation algorithm converged to local minima, we only found good performance when bit labels were added. To obtain the bit labels, we have used the algorithm 1, for which we need the following definitions: If L is a list, then ARGSORT(L) is the lexicographically least permutation of the indices [0, . . .,LEN(L)\u2212 1] such that L[ARGSORT(L)] is sorted. The procedure GRAYMAP(m) returns the indices for a 1D Gray-coded constellation, e.g., GRAYMAP(2) = [0, 1, 3, 2] and GRAYMAP(3) = [0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4].\nWhen the bit labelling is obtained for the Cartesian coordinates of the constellation, the bit labels resemble the Gray-coded QAM. If fact, labelling a regular square constellation results in Gray-coded regular square QAM. Similarly, when the bit labelling is obtained for the N -dimensional spherical coordinates, the constellations resemble AS-PSK or the constellations proposed in [43]. We found that for lower SNR relative to the cardinality of the constellation, the latter performs better and for higher SNR the Cartesian basis for generating the bit labels works best.\nThe process of the trust-region optimisation is shown in Fig. 12. After generating a constellation and assigning bit labels to it, a trust-region algorithm is applied [40]. The algorithms start with calculating the function value and its gradient. The inverse Hessian B is assumed to be an identity matrix and the trust region to be of size 1. Steihaug\u2019s conjugate gradient method [41] is used to find trust-region step sk and the function and gradient at x+ sk are evaluated. The ratio between the actual reduction and the predicted reduction [40, Eq. (4.4)] is used to update the constellation and the trust region size. If it is greater than 0, the new x will be x+ sk, otherwise sk is discarded. Note that the actual reduction can be negative and move the constellation away from its current local minimum. The size of the trust region is reduced or increased based on whether the ratio is below 0.2 or above 0.8 respectively. When the trust-region size has shrunk smaller than a set target (we used 3\u00d7 10\u22124) the optimisation is considered complete."
