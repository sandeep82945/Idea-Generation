    "abstractText": "In this work, exfoliated \u03b1-zirconium phosphate (\u03b1-ZrP) and phosphated cellulose (PCF) were employed to synthesize poly(vinyl alcohol) composite aerogels (PVA/PCF/\u03b1-ZrP) with excellent flame retardancy through the multi-directional freezing method. The peak heat release rate (PHRR), total smoke release (TSR), and CO production (COP) of the (PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3) composite aerogel were considerably decreased by 42.3%, 41.4%, and 34.7%, as compared to the pure PVA aerogel, respectively. Simultaneously, the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value was improved from 18.1% to 28.4%. The mechanistic study of flame retardancy showed evidence that PCF and \u03b1-ZrP promoted the crosslinking and carbonization of PVA chains to form a barrier, which not only served as insulation between the material and the air, but also significantly reduced the emissions of combustible toxic gases (CO2, CO). In addition, the multi-directional freezing method further improved the catalytic carbonization process. This mutually advantageous strategy offers a new strategy for the preparation of composite aerogels with enhanced fire resistance.",

            "text": "The synthesis of resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer aerogels in the late 1980s by Pekala resulted in an unparalleled revolution in the field of materials [1,2]. Polymeric aerogels of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [3], polyimide (PI) [4], cellulose [5], pectin [6], etc., gained a lot of attention, due to their controllable structural diversity and desired mechanical properties. Compared to other polymer aerogels, the polar groups (-OH-) in PVA enable its easy dissolution in water. Moreover, PVA aerogels are the most widely investigated three-dimensional materials, due to their abundant source, non-toxicity, low cost, easy synthesis, and excellent biocompatibility [3,7,8]. However, due to lack of flame retardancy, applications of PVA have been seriously restricted in fields of aerospace, synthetic catalysis, chemical energy industry, biomedicine, intelligent manufacturing, etc. Many efforts have been made to develop flame retardant aerogels, mainly PVA/MMT aerogels [9,10], PVA/clay aerogels [11], PVA/alginate aerogels [12], PVA/h-BN@PDA@TiO2 aerogels [13], etc. Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials have become hotspots of research, since they can be exfoliated into a single-layer or few-layered structures by atoms, molecules, small organic groups, and even polymers, bringing about significant changes in their properties and notable improvement of their dispersion in water [14\u201317]. Among them, layer structured \u03b1-zirconium phosphate (\u03b1-ZrP) has gained more interest, due to its chemical stability against strong acids/bases and redox agents. Moreover, it improves the chemical,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15919. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232415919 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15919 2 of 23\nmechanical, and thermal properties of the polymeric matrix. The proton of P-OH group in \u03b1-ZrP can be exchanged; according to the \u201cacid-base proton theory\u201d, \u03b1-ZrP is a Br\u00f8nsted acid that can be used as a solid acid catalyst. At high temperature combustion, it can catalyze polymer crosslinking into carbon, forming a \u201cbarrier\u201d, blocking the transmission of flammable gas, oxygen, and heat; it is a new type of efficient nano flame retardant. However, it is difficult to meet the flame retardant requirements of polymer when used alone. Therefore, it is often used to enhance the flame retardant property of polymer by synergistic flame retardant with other flame retardants [18]. Water molecules present in the cavity of the crystal structure form a hydrogen bond with P-OH present in the layer. By means of inhaling, embedding, inserting, pillaring, or grafting of organic groups of specific sizes, the interlayer spacing can be altered, which is an effect of van der Waals forces. This makes it an excellent matrix for the preparation of intercalated compounds and polymer/inorganic nanocomposites. The work of Lu [19] showed that the dispersion state, the chemical structure, and the slice state of \u03b1-ZrP significantly influence the flammability performance and thermal stability of the polymer materials. Therefore, commercial polyoxyalkylene amine (M1000) was used to assist the ultrasonic stripping of exfoliated layered \u03b1-ZrP into monolayers of \u03b1-ZrP nano-plates and obtain stable dispersed \u03b1-ZrP nano-plates in the present study. Since M1000 is solid at room temperature and liquid when heated, it can act as a cold barrier in the system. However, M1000 contains large numbers of C and O elements that reduce the thermal stability of \u03b1-ZrP. Therefore, based on our previous work [20], adding both phosphated cellulose (PCF) and exfoliated \u03b1-ZrP synergistically increases the flame retardancy of PVA. The directional freezing method, also known as an ice template method, is a commonly used method for preparing aerogels. It is generally employed in biological tissue engineering, thermal insulation, refractory materials, and lightweight high-strength materials. Ice crystals are removed by freeze-drying to obtain porous materials with orientated structures using orientated ice crystals as templates during the freeze-drying process [21]. At the same time, adjusting the rigid part of the matrix or the flexible interface to obtain new micro and nano materials [22] combined with directional freezing can result in multi-functional aerogel materials. The aerogels prepared by the directional freezing method possess an anisotropic porous structure and exhibit better insulation behavior by preventing local heat concentration and increasing the overall heat transfer barrier [23]. Directional freezing has only one temperature gradient, while multidirectional freezing has two or three temperature gradients simultaneously [24]. Zhao et al. [25] fabricated an elastic network of chitosan aerogels by a novel bidirectional freeze-casting method, which provided combined advantages of super-elasticity and flame retardancy along with highly oriented wavy-layered stacking microstructures. It is generally employed in biological tissue engineering, thermal insulation, refractory materials, and lightweight high-strength materials [26\u201328]. In this study, a lightweight, multi-anisotropic aerogel based on PVA and two kinds of nanofillers (PCF and exfoliated \u03b1-ZrP) were prepared through a multi-directional freezing technique. \u03b1-ZrP with layered structures and nanofibrous PCF have a synergistic effect on PVA aerogels, by acting as structural support and improving the thermal insulation of the aerogel. Comparison of the aerogels prepared by unidirectional freezing and bidirectional freezing showed that the composite aerogel prepared through the multi-directional freezing technique possessed a denser lamellar porous structure, which improves heat diffusion in-plane and enhances cold insulation. Hence, they are potentially useful as flexible thermal insulators for both residential and commercial construction."

SEM investigated the effect of nanofillers on the morphological changes of the composite aerogels at the cross-sections and along the length. The fracture morphologies of pure PVA aerogel in Figure 3a,b show a 3D network structure with hollow interiors and extremely uniform holes. Meanwhile, a highly ordered pore structure parallel to the growth plane of the ice crystal was also observed. Even after loading with PCF and \u03b1-ZrP, the PVA/PCF/\u03b1-ZrP composite aerogels retained the layered porous structure without\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15919 5 of 23\nuniform voids and obvious collapse (Figure 3c\u2013l). This result could be due to two reasons: on one hand, the introduced PCF and \u03b1-ZrP showed improved dispersion in the polymer matrix, which prevented the collapse of its structure. On the other hand, the strong adhesivity of PVA increased the skeletal strength [33]. Figure 3c,d show the cross-sectional and longitudinal SEM images of PVA/\u03b1-ZrP20, respectively. Obviously, with the addition of \u03b1-ZrP into PVA, the pores at the cross section of the composite aerogel were broken, but the shape of the aerogel along its length became uniform and dense. Contrastingly, the composite aerogel containing only 20% PCF showed a layered structure regardless of the direction, but this structure was neither regular nor close-compacted (Figure 3k) and even showed faults (Figure 3l). The SEM image of PVA/PCF5/\u03b1-ZrP15 is shown in Figure 3e,f. With PCF to \u03b1-ZrP ratio of 1:3, the gaps between the aerogel layers appeared filled, and the entire layer displayed a uniform and regular morphology. However, the edge of the layered structure at the cross section was jagged and the edges of the longitudinal section were curled. Subsequently, with the increase in the ratio of PCF to \u03b1-ZrP, a strong and thick layered structure began to appear in the aerogel, as shown in Figure 3g,h. It was evident that with the increase in the nanofiller proportion, the wall thickness and strength gradually became more obvious and serious. However, for PVA/PCF15/\u03b1-ZrP5 (Figure 3i,j), the composite aerogel showed broken cell walls. This shows that a further increase in the ratio of PCF to \u03b1-ZrP had a bad effect on the microstructure of the aerogel. In summary, PCF to \u03b1-ZrP ratio of 1:1 provided excellent structure for the composite aerogels. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 23\nFigure 3.

Mechanical Properties of the Unidirectional PVA Aerogels\nThe effects of PCF and \u03b1-ZrP nanofillers on the mechanical and compression performance can be seen from the stress-strain curves and Young\u2019s moduli in Figures 5 and S3 (Supporting Information).

Figure S3 shows the compression performance along the direction parallel to the growth of ice crystal of pure PVA and PVA/\u03b1-ZrP20 composite aerogel. PVA aerogel has many structural defects and so it yields when its compressive strain reaches 68 wt%. The compressive strain of PVA/\u03b1-ZrP20 composite aerogel improved slightly to 70%, due to the formation of an effective long strip microstructure (Figure S3). When the ratio of PCF to \u03b1-ZrP was changed from 1:3 to 1:1 and then to 3:1, the compressive stress was obviously improved to 5.56, 5.47, and 4.96 MPa, respectively. This indicated that the change in the proportion of nanofillers had little effect on the mechanical properties of the aerogel in the longitudinal direction. Meanwhile, with the incorporation of 20.0 wt% of pure PCF into PVA aerogels, its tensile strength was 4.74 MPa.

Different from the results of compressive stress, except for PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10, the Young\u2019s moduli of other composite aerogels with nanofillers were reduced to varying extents, which could be due to the presence of thin and curled or misaligned holed-walls in the vertical direction.

The uniformity in the expansion of composite aerogel indicated that the pressure at all points was balanced. This could also be observed in the SEM image (Figure 3h). Next, the stress-strain curves perpendicular to the direction of ice crystal growth were studied. Similar to the results of longitudinal stress-strain curve, the PVA aerogel showed a small stress of 0.29 MPa ascribed to its ice crystal direction. PVA aerogel has a small Young\u2019s modulus of 0.14 MPa ascribed to its larger aperture. When the addition amount of PCF was increased from 0 wt% to 20 wt%, the addition amount of \u03b1-ZrP reduced from 20 wt% to 0 wt%, and the stress dramatically changed from 0.09 MPa to 0.82 MPa.

Thermal Stabilities of Unidirectional PVA Aerogels\nThe thermal stabilities of PVA aerogel and its nano-composite aerogels in nitrogen and air were evaluated by TGA, as shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a,b, the PVA aerogel and its nano-composite aerogels showed similar two-stage thermal degradation patterns in both environments. As expected, when 20 wt% of PCF and \u03b1-ZrP together were introduced, the residual carbon contents of PVA nanocomposite aerogels at 800 \u25e6C improved from 3.98% (pure PVA, N2) and 2.84% (pure PVA, air) to 24.2%, 14.48% (N2) and 9.33%, 8.65% (air).\nInt.

It was evident that the initial degradation temperatures (T5%, Supporting Information Table S3) and the first maximum degradation temperatures (Tmax1, Supporting Information Table S3) of the PVA nano-composite aerogels under both conditions were lower tha thos of pure PVA aerogel, which could be ascribed to the degradation f PCF and M1000 in exfoliated \u03b1-ZrP.

It was observed that the freezing directions of aerogels greatly affect the lamellar structure along the XY plane, especially the bilateral freezing (Figure 8d) and multilateral freezing (Figure 8g). The reason could be that the XY surface of the mold was exposed to low-temperature ethanol, whereas the XZ and YZ planes were exposed to air. Hence, the propagation of temperature was slower than that of XY plane, which hindered the unidirectional growth of ice crystal and formed a denser and broken layer. PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x aerogels showed a neat parallel arrangement of lamellar structure at both X-Z and Y-Z cross-sections in the SEM images and the wall thickness was determined to be 3 to 10 \u00b5m by multi-directional freezing technique. As compared to PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-1 (Figure 8b,c) and PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-2 (Figure 8e,f), the bilateral lamellar structure of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 (Figure 8h,i) was more uniform and dense. The wall surface of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 (Figure 8g\u2013i) with holes was the roughest with nanofibers bulging between the lamellae. This confirmed the presence of PCF nanofibers and the average dispersion of \u03b1-ZrP in PVA matrix.

As shown in Figure 9a\u2013c, the compression performance of the aerogels was excellent only in the vertical direction (XY), but poor in other directions (XZ and YZ). There was 80% compression in the direction perpendicular to the lamellae (Figure 9a), PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 (8.25 MPa) displaying stronger compressive stress compared with PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-2 (6.76 MPa) and PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-1 (5.66 MPa). Similarly, in Figure 9b,c, PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 still showed excellent compression resistance in the other two directions.

It is worth noting that the density of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 aerogel was distinctly reduced, which could be due to the formation of tiny pores in the cell wall (Figure 8g\u2013i).

This could be ascribed to the incorporation of PCF and \u03b1ZrP into the network and also the porous interpenetration caused by different freezing methods, which provided more points to withstand the pressure PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x aerogels. These results implied that the compressive properties of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x\nFigure 9. Compressive properties of the multi-directional PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x aerogels.

The reason for the sharp reduction in THR value of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3 was the addition of PCF and zirconium phosphate.

The fire hazards for PVA composites were also predicted by means of fire performance index (FPI) and fire growth index (FGI), which are defined by the ratios of TTI to PHRR and PHRR to the time to PHRR (TPHRR), respectively.

Simultaneously, the results of UL-94 vertical burning tests showed that pure PVA had no rating (NR), due to the presence of large numbers of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen elements. The combustion grade of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x aerogel was V0, due to the presence of large amount of P element and a small amount of N of M1000, thus proving its good flame retardancy. Moreover, PVA aerogel (Figure S7) continued to burn after heating for 10 s with the flame of an alcohol lamp. In sharp contrast to this, the PVA/PCF10/\u03b1ZrP10-x composites (Figure S7) showed no obvious traces of burning and self-extinguished after the flame was removed.\nInt. J. Mol.

Vapor Phase Analysis\nCoupled thermogravimetric analysis-infrared spectrometry (TG-IR) was employed to determine the thermal decomposition behaviors and distinguish the volatile components of PVA and PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x composite aerogels during pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere [41,42]. Figure S8 shows the three-dimensional diagrams and FT-IR spectra versus temperature obtained by TG-IR. Pure PVA was primarily decomposed into water vapor (3750 cm\u22121), alkane (2940 cm\u22121), CO2 (2360 cm\u22121), and CO (2190 cm\u22121) in IR spectra. However, PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x behaved differently. Compared to the pure PVA aerogel, a higher number of pyrolytic products of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x ascertained the formation of carbonyl compounds (1710 cm\u22121), P-O (1210 cm\u22121), P=O (568 cm\u22121), due to the decomposition of PCF and the presence of the P element. Moreover, the peak at 1510 cm\u22121 was attributed to aromatic compounds, which suggested extensive carbonization and conversion of polysaccharides in PCF to aromatic graphitized structures (char) during pyrolysis [43,44]. Curves for the intensities of common gaseous products are plotted in Figure 12, wherein the four types could be divided into two categories: non-flammable volatiles (CO2, water vapor) and flammable volatiles (CO, alkyl compounds). According to the Lambert\u2013Beer law, the concentration of gas linearly depends on the absorption intensity [45]. The maximum absorption intensity for water vapor of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x was significantly improved compared with pure PVA. This showed that the addition of P improved the thermal decomposition of composite materials and a small amount of M1000 could volatilize the amine-containing compounds. More particularly, the maximum absorbance intensities of gaseous products (CO, CO2) and flammable C-H compounds escaping from PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-x were significantly reduced in comparison to pristine PVA.

The residual carbon in PVA contained a large number of fine needle-like structures (Figure 13a), which could be attributed to an orderly microstructure achieved by unidirectional freezing.

Two broad diffraction peaks were observed. The one at approximately 1360 cm\u22121 (D band) corresponded to the first-order Raman scattering of sp3 hybridized C atoms.

The other peak at approximately 1580 cm\u22121 was the G band and it corresponded to the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in the graphitic layer. This was suggestive of e2g-type vibrations in the lattice network of the graphitic layer and indicated an ordered carbon structure. Since the D band and G band in the spectrum overlapped, the Gaussian peak fitting was employed to deconvolute it into two individual peaks. The degree of graphitization of carbonaceous materials was expressed by the ratio of the intensity of D peak area (ID) and the intensity of G peak area (IG) [46,47]. Commonly, a lower ID/IG value indicated that the carbon layer contained more graphitic-type carbon, which led to the perfect quality of the carbon layer and an excellent barrier performance. Amazingly for PVA, its ID/IG value was up to 7.26 (Figure 14a). After the incorporation of 10 wt% PCF and 10 wt% \u03b1-ZrP into PVA, the ID/IG value dropped sharply to 5.83 (Figure 14b).

As shown in Figure 15, the mechanism of flame-retardancy could be explained considering two aspects: vapor phase flame retardancy and condensed phase flame retardancy [48]. Phosphate groups at the C6 hydroxyl group on PCF surfaces underwent dephosphorylation to generate aromatic graphitized structures (char) and phosphate units. These phosphate units on PCF underwent dehydration and condensation to form polyphosphates of PCF (Reaction 1). Moreover, the pyrolysis also caused cracking of PCF into P\u2022, which captured H\u2022 and OH\u2022 free radicals. This diluted the oxygen concentration in air, reduced the number of combustibles, and thus hampered the conduction of combustion [49]. The existing phosphate groups also catalyzed the dehydration of PVA chains and promoted the development of thermally stable char structures [20]. Meanwhile, M1000 used for the exfoliation of \u03b1-ZrP was pyrolyzed into non-combustible gases, like ammonia and nitrogen, which reduced the number of combustible gases and further suffocated the flame. Moreover, \u03b1-ZrP, which is a layered acidic activator and furnishes Br\u00f8nsted (H+) and Lewis (Zr4+) acidic sites on its surface, and plays a synergistic role by initiating the formation of residues and consolidates the stability of the carbonaceous layer through catalytic reactions [50]. Therefore, the PVA chains could be catalytically carbonized by the Br\u00f8nsted (H+) acid during the burning process. Meanwhile, the degradation products were captured by the Lewis (Zr4+) acid to form a dense and substantial number of residues, due to the presence of Zr4+ which facilitated dehydrogenation, crosslinking, cyclization, condensation, and aromatization reactions (Reaction 2) [51]. It was easy to catalyze the aerogel prepared by multi-directional freezing to obtain a carbon layer, due to its uniform and dense microstructure, which reduced the escaping of gas. Finally, the continuous char layers could efficiently reduce the heat exchange between PVA and air, the free radicals could effectively dilute the air, and their mutual co-operation could achieve the flame retardancy of PVA.\nFig re 14. a an spectra of the residues: (a) PVA, (b) PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-1, (c) PVA/PCF10/\u03b1ZrP10-2, and (d) PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3.\n. . . r i f l t r\nse on the above results, a plausible mechanis of flame retardancy of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1ZrP10-3 was proposed to explain the synergistic effects between \u03b1-ZrP and PCF in the PVA aerogels.

Mechanism of flame-retardancy of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10-3.\nMoreover, \u03b1-ZrP, which is a layered acidic activator and furnishes Br\u00f8nsted (H+) and Lewis (Zr4+) acidic sites on its surface, and plays a synergistic role by initiating the formation of residues and consolidates the stability of the carbonaceous layer through catalytic reactions [50]. Therefore, the PVA chains could be catalytically carbonized by the Br\u00f8nsted (H+) acid during the burning process. Meanwhile, the degradation products were captured by the Lewis (Zr4+) acid to form a dense and substantial number of residues, due to the presence of Zr4+ which facilitated dehydrogenation, crosslinking, cyclization, condensation, and aromatization reactions (Reaction 2) [51]. It was easy to catalyze the aerogel prepared by multi-directional freezing to obtain a carbon layer, due to its uniform and dense microstructure, which reduced the escaping of gas. Finally, the continuous char layers could efficiently reduce the heat exchange between PVA and air, the free radicals could effectively dilute the air, and their mutual co-operation could achieve the flame retardancy of PVA."

The reaction mechanism for the synthesis of PCF is shown in Supporting Information Figure S10. Briefly, urea (12.48 g; 0.208 mol) was added to a 250 mL three-neck flask and heated to 140 \u25e6C; it was held at this temperature for 30 min under a N2 atmosphere until a fully melted state was observed. Then, \u03b1-cellulose (2 g; 0.0123 mol) and phosphite (10.28 g; 0.1253 mol) were alternately added to the molten urea in sequence to reduce foaming. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 150 \u25e6C for 5 h for full response to the final formation of pale-yellow solids. The product was dissolved in 100 mL\nInt. J. Mol.

Preparation and Exfoliation \u03b1-ZrP\n\u03b1-ZrP was prepared by using a reflux method in a previously reported procedure [53] and the specific process is as follows. ZrOCl2\u00b78H2O (20 g) was refluxed with 200 mL 3.0 M H3PO4 in a single-necked flask at room temperature for 60 min and then held at 100 \u25e6C for 24 h. After the completion of the reaction, the products were washed with deionized water till pH was 7 and dried at 65 \u25e6C for 24 h. The dried \u03b1-ZrP product was ground using a mortar and pestle into fine powder. \u03b1-ZrP (0.5 g) was weighed and dispersed in 25 mL acetone by sonication for 1 h. M1000 solution (2.77 mL, 0.6 g/mL) was slowly added drop-wise to the stirring \u03b1-ZrP dispersion. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h, then sonicated for 60 min, and rotated the acetone out using a rotary evaporator. This was followed by ultrasonic dispersion in deionized water and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min in polytetrafluoroethylene tubes. The precipitate was removed and the relatively clear suspension contained only exfoliated \u03b1-ZrP and excess of M1000. The clear suspension was taken in a dialysis bag and dialyzed for 48 h to remove excess polyoxyalkylene amine. The mass fraction of exfoliated \u03b1-ZrP was 0.04 g/mL. The reaction mechanism for \u03b1-ZrP synthesis is shown in Supporting Information Figure S11.\n3.2.3. Fabrication of the Unidirectional PVA Aerogel\nDifferent mass ratios of PCF/\u03b1-ZrP(1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) were added in the sample bottle to obtain stable suspensions. The total flame-retardant component of the PVA aerogel was maintained at 20 wt% (Table S4, Supporting Information). The steps for the preparation of PVA/PCF10/\u03b1-ZrP10 are as follows: firstly, PVA (0.8 g) and PCF/\u03b1-ZrP (1:1) dispersion (0.2 g) were added to 20 mL deionized water and stirred magnetically at 100 \u25e6C for 3 h to obtain a uniform solution. The mixture was poured into a mold with a copper plate as the bottom surface, which was kept in contact with an ethanol bath (\u221250 \u25e6C) to prepare unidirectional PVA aerogel. Similar steps were also followed for the syntheses of PVA/\u03b1-ZrP20, PVA/PCF5/\u03b1-ZrP15, PVA/PCF15/\u03b1-ZrP5, PVA/PCF20 aerogels. Finally, the unidirectional PVA aerogels were freeze-dried at a sublimating temperature of \u221247 \u25e6C and pressure of 1 Pa for 5 days. The process for the preparation of unidirectional PVA aerogel is shown in Supporting Information Figure S12.\n3.2.4. Fabrication of the Multi-Directional PVA Aerogel\nThe aqueous dispersion of the PVA composite was transferred to a mold with different freezing directions, as shown in Supporting Information Figure S13. Thus, the aqueous PVA solution generated different temperature gradients along each direction. The anisotropic aerogel for two- or three-dimensional orientation was obtained by freeze-drying under the same conditions as above. The final aerogels were labeled as PVA/PCF/\u03b1-ZrP-x (PVA/PCF/\u03b1ZrP-1, PVA/PCF/\u03b1-ZrP-2, PVA/PCF/\u03b1-ZrP-3) according to the number of dimensions."

            "text": "PVA composite aerogels with excellent flame retardancy and thermal insulation properties were successfully prepared through a multi-directional freezing method by using a combination of PCF and \u03b1-ZrP as nanofillers. This multi-directional freezing method not only effectively optimized the microstructure of a composite aerogel, but also promoted cross-linking, thus significantly improving its thermal stability. Particularly, the infrared thermal-imaging picture showed thermal insulation, cold insulation performance, and the outstanding flame retardancy of the aerogel. It confirmed an effective synergy between PCF and \u03b1-ZrP and the formation of pathways that hindered energy exchange. With the incorporation of 10 wt% PCF and 10 wt% \u03b1-ZrP, the peak heat release rate (PHRR), total smoke release (TSR), and CO production (COP) of PVA composite fibers were considerably decreased by 42.3%, 41.4%, and 34.7%, respectively. The LOI value and UL-94 grade test results showed that the composite aerogel met the standards of flame retardancy. We expect that the multi-directional freezing method, combined with the synergistic property in the making of composite materials, would provide new avenues for the manufacturing of composite aerogels with remarkable flame retardancy for applications in building materials.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms232415919/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.L. and Y.W.; methodology, H.L.; preparation, Z.H. and Y.Q.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.Z. and D.X.
