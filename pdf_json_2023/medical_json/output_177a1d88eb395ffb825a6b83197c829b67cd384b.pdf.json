    "abstractText": "Immunological memory is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system. Although natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells important for the immediate host defence, they can differentiate into memory NK cells. The molecular mechanisms controlling this differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated. Here we identify the scaffold protein Themis2 as a critical regulator of memory NK cell differentiation and function. Themis2-deficient NK cells expressing Ly49H, an activating NK receptor for the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) antigen m157, show enhanced differentiation into memory NK cells and augment host protection against MCMV infection. Themis2 inhibits the effector function of NK cells after stimulation of Ly49H andmultiple activating NK receptors, though not specific to memory NK cells. Mechanistically, Themis2 suppresses Ly49H signalling by attenuating ZAP70/Syk phosphorylation, and it also translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes Zfp740-mediated repression to regulate the persistence of memory NK cells. Zfp740 deficiency increases the number of memory NK cells and enhances the effector function of memory NK cells, which further supports the relevance of the Themis2Zfp740 pathway. In conclusion, our study shows that Themis2 quantitatively and qualitatively regulates NK cell memory formation.",

Love 8, Koichiro Kako1,9, Akiyoshi Fukamizu 1, Masafumi Muratani 10 & Akira Shibuya 1,2,3\nImmunological memory is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system. Although natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells important for the immediate host defence, they can differentiate into memory NK cells. The molecular mechanisms controlling this differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated. Here we identify the scaffold protein Themis2 as a critical regulator of memory NK cell differentiation and function. Themis2-deficient NK cells expressing Ly49H, an activating NK receptor for the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) antigen m157, show enhanced differentiation into memory NK cells and augment host protection against MCMV infection. Themis2 inhibits the effector function of NK cells after stimulation of Ly49H andmultiple activating NK receptors, though not specific to memory NK cells. Mechanistically, Themis2 suppresses Ly49H signalling by attenuating ZAP70/Syk phosphorylation, and it also translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes Zfp740-mediated repression to regulate the persistence of memory NK cells. Zfp740 deficiency increases the number of memory NK cells and enhances the effector function of memory NK cells, which further supports the relevance of the Themis2Zfp740 pathway. In conclusion, our study shows that Themis2 quantitatively and qualitatively regulates NK cell memory formation.\nImmunological memory is a hallmark of the immune system1,2. The acquisition of immunological memory provides long-lasting host protection against infectious diseases and malignancies by eliciting improved adaptive immune responses1,3. However, accumulating evidence indicates that innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells can also evoke memory or memory-like responses following infections or other stimulations, and these responses have been attributed to the differentiation of long-livedmemory (or trained) cells with enhanced cellular functions2,4\u20136. Immunological memory is governed by the quality and quantity of memory cells, with its qualitative traits being determined by their effector function on a per-cell basis, and its quantitative traits being determined by their persistence through the balance of apoptosis and survival7\u20139. Although these traits of memory cells can be accounted for by both the activation signaling\nReceived: 1 May 2023\nAccepted: 16 October 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Life Science Center for Survival Dynamics, Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA), University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 2Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 3R&D Center for Innovative Drug Discovery, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 4Doctoral Program in Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 5College of Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 6Bioinformatics Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 7College of Biological Sciences, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 8Section on Hematopoiesis and Lymphocyte Biology, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. 9Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 10Department of Genome Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. e-mail: nabekura.tsukasa.fe@u.tsukuba.ac.jp; ashibuya@md.tsukuba.ac.jp\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7200 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nas cytoplasmic events and the transcriptional and epigenetic changes as nuclear events10\u201312, the molecular machinery that regulates the differentiation into memory cells is not yet fully understood.\nNK cells play an important role in anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity13. They recognize unhealthy cells by utilizing a repertoire of activating NK receptors and exert their cytotoxic activity and production of chemokines and cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 for the eradication of these cells13,14. NK cells have traditionally been classified as innate immune cells; however, emerging evidence has shown that NK cells can differentiate into memory cells with enhanced effector functions5,6,9. An activating NK receptor, Ly49H, expressed on mouse NK cells specifically recognizes the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) proteinm157 on infected cells and transmits an activation signal via an adaptormolecule, DAP12, and the proximal phosphorylation of ZAP70 and Syk15\u201317. In addition to the essential role of Ly49H+ NK cells in the control of MCMV infection18, activated Ly49H+ NK cells expand as effectorNKcells, undergo apoptosis after thepeakofNKcell response, or differentiate into long-lived memory NK cells during MCMV infection5,19. Memory NK cells show several enhanced functional properties: (1) Long-term persistence, (2) the capability of undergo secondary expansion, (3) augmented cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production after stimulation of activating NK receptors in vitro, (4) provision of improved host defence against MCMV infection, and (5) enhanced anti-tumor activity in vivo5,6,19. Similarly, humanNK cells expressing the activating NK receptor NKG2C show robust proliferation, persistence, recall response, and augmented cytotoxicity in response to cytomegalovirus infection, demonstrating the existence ofmemoryNKcells in humans9,20,21.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the role of NK receptors, cytokines, and transcription factors in the differentiation of memory NK cells in mice22\u201329. However, these studies have primarily focused on the quantity of memory NK cells rather than their qualitative traits. Recent studies have revealed unique transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes in memory NK cells30,31, suggesting that the qualitative and quantitative traits of memory NK cells are intricately regulated by transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, and signaling through NK receptors and cytokine receptors. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have demonstrated negative regulation of memory NK cell differentiation23,29. However, the molecular mechanisms that qualitatively and quantitatively regulate the differentiation of memory NK cells are yet to be fully understood.\nIn this work, we identify Themis2 as a critical negative regulator of the differentiation of memory NK cells and investigate the role of Themis2 in NK cell memory formation and function. We show that Themis2 in the cytoplasm suppresses Ly49H signaling by attenuating ZAP70/Syk phosphorylation. Moreover, Themis2 translocates into the nucleus and promotes Zfp740-mediated repression to regulate the persistence of memory NK cells. Our study shows that Themis2 quantitatively and qualitatively regulates NK cell memory formation."

            "text": "Themis2 negatively regulates NK cell memory formation To identify critical regulators for memory NK cell differentiation, we used NKp46-CreERT2 Tg mice with Rosa26-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/YFP alleles (hereinafter, NK-CreERT2mice)19. NKp46+ cells in NKCreERT2 mice express YFP upon CreERT2-mediated excision of the loxP-floxed STOP sequence in the Rosa26 loci after tamoxifen administration. Thus, NK-CreERT2 mice allowed us to track MCMV-primed NK cells, irrespective of NK cell subsets expressing or not expressing Ly49H, as YFP+ NK cells after tamoxifen administration on days 0, 1, and 2, following MCMV infection on day 0 (Fig. 1a). Considering that the vast majority of NKp46+NK1.1+TCR\u03b2- lymphocytes in the spleen are conventional NK cells32,33, NKp46+ type 1 and type 3 innate lymphoid cells in the spleen would be negligible in this study on na\u00efve and MCMV-primed NK cells in the spleen. On day 10 post-infection (pi), we\npurified YFP+ cells from the spleen, which included MCMV-primed effector Ly49H+KLRG1high or Ly49H-KLRG1high NK cells. On day 28 pi, we further purified MCMV-primed long-lived memory NK cells with the stringent phenotypic definition of Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1- to low and cytokine-activated Ly49H-KLRG1high NK cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). We then subjected these cell subsets to RNA-seq and obtained 51,826 unique transcripts (feature IDs), 44 of which had expressions that were upregulated in effector Ly49H+ NK cells and maintained inmemory NK cells, as compared with their expressions in na\u00efve Ly49H+ or Ly49H- NK cells, effector Ly49H- NK cells, or cytokineactivated NK cells (Fig. 1b). Because memory NK cells display transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles distinct from those of na\u00efve and effector NK cells31, we further narrowed down the candidates to three genes\u2014 Themis2, Trp73, and Trib1\u2014 by their nuclear localization signal (NLS) or subcellular location by using the UniProt knowledgebase (https://www.uniprot.org) (Fig. 1b). Among three genes, we chose Themis2 as the focus of the present study because we confirmed expression in na\u00efve NK cells at the protein level (Supplementary Fig. 2a).\nA Themis family member Themis2 is known as a signaling scaffold protein that regulates activation signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 and B cell receptor in macrophages and B cells, respectively34\u201336.Themis2 mRNA expression was upregulated in effector Ly49H+ NK cells after MCMV infection, and this upregulation was maintained in the subsequentmemoryNKcells,whereas its expression in Ly49H- NK cells remained unchanged after MCMV infection (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which is consistent with the expression kinetics identified in an RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Consistent with the kinetics of Themis2 mRNA, Themis2 protein expression was increased in effector Ly49H+ NK cells after MCMV infection and maintained in memory NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d). A functional protein association network analysis using the STRING database v10.5 (https://string-db.org) demonstrated enrichment of mouse Themis2 andhumanTHEMIS2 in theKEGGPathway \u201cNatural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity\u201d pathways (mmu04650 and hsa04650, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 2e), indicating that Themis2 may be involved in NK cell function. NK cells in na\u00efve wild-type (WT) and Themis2deficient (Themis2\u2013/\u2013) mice34 did not show significant differences in the percentage and development of NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g).\nActivation signaling through Ly49H is required forMCMV-primed expansion and differentiation of Ly49H+ NK cells into memory NK cells5,19. We investigated the role of Themis2 in activation signaling through Ly49H. Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed greater degranulation and phosphorylation of ZAP70 and Syk, both of which are downstream molecules of the Ly49H-DAP12 adaptor complex16,17, after stimulation with the anti-Ly49H mAb, as compared with that in WT NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Together, these results indicate that Themis2 inhibits NK cell activation via Ly49H. Furthermore, Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed increased degranulation after stimulation of NKG2D, NKp46, and NK1.1 (NKR-P1C) (Supplementary Fig. 3c).\nTo further investigate mechanistic details of Themis2-mediated inhibition of Ly49H signaling, we established a transfectant of a human NK cell line NKL, which expresses the endogenous DAP12 and ZAP70, but not SYK, expressing transfected Ly49H and FLAG-tagged THEMIS2. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that THEMIS2 was coimmunoprecipitatedwith DAP12 andZAP70 after stimulationwith anti-Ly49HmAb when we used DTSSP for chemical crosslinking cytosolic proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). However, the coimmunoprecipitation was not detected when we did not use DTSSP (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e), suggesting that the Ly49H-mediated signal induces a protein complex formation consistingof THEMIS2,DAP12, andZAP70with a lowaffinity.\nTo examine the role of Themis2 in NK cells in vivo, WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 mice were infected with MCMV. Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells displayed amore activated phenotype than didWT Ly49H+ NK cells on day 1.5 pi, as demonstrated by increased an activation marker CD69\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7200 2\na b Na\u00efve NK\nLy49H+ Ly49H-\nNK-CreERT2 0 1 2 10 days\nTamoxifen\n0 1 2 10 28 days\nMCMV\nEffector NK Ly49H+\nLy49H-\nLong-lived NK Memory Ly49H+\nCytokine-activated Ly49H-\n//\nNK-CreERT2\nTamoxifen\nCriteria for selecting critical regulators of memory NK cells Number of IDs Genes Total number of feature IDs identified by RNA-seq 51826\nCriterion 1.

Furthermore, Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells produced a larger amount of IFN-\u03b3 than didWT Ly49H+ NK cells onday 1.5 pi (Supplementary Fig. 3g), consistent with enhanced effector functions and ZAP70/Syk phosphorylation of Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).\nTo determine whether Themis2 impacts the differentiation of memory NK cells, CD45.1+ WT Ly49H+ NK cells and CD45.2+ Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells were co-transferred at a ratio of 1:1 into syngeneic DAP12-deficient (Tyrobp\u2013/\u2013) mice lacking functional expression of Ly49H (Fig. 1c). The recipient mice were then infected with MCMV. After infection, only donor Ly49H+ NK cells were activated in anMCMV antigen (m157)-specific manner. Expressions of the activation and differentiationmarkers KLRG1 and Ly6Cwere upregulated to the same degree on the donor WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells on day 7 pi (Supplementary Fig. 4a), which is consistent with previous reportsshowing thatMCMV-primed Ly49H+ NK cells showupregulation of and maintain KLRG1 and Ly6C expressions throughout their differentiation into memory NK cells19,22. However, MCMV-primed Themis2\u2013/\u2013Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells showed more robust proliferation as effectorNK cells onday7pi, comparedwithWTLy49H+KLRG1high NK cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the number and proportion of Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells were greater than those of WT Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells in the contraction and memory phases until day 28 pi (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4b). These long-lived WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells on day 28 pi displayed an equivalent intact memory NK cell immunophenotype (Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1- to lowCD11b+CD27-)19,22 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). However, the number and proportion of memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells (stringently defined as Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1- to lowCD11b+CD27- NK cells) were larger than those of memory WT NK cells in the spleen on day 28 pi (Fig. 1f). These results indicate that Themis2 impairs control ofMCMV infection and inhibits memory NK cell differentiation.\nTo clarify the effects of Themis2 on cell division, survival, and apoptosis of Ly49H+ NK cells duringMCMV infection, we examined the expression of Ki-67 (a cell cycle marker), Bcl-2 (a survival factor), and Bim and active Caspase 3/7 (apoptotic factors) in WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells during MCMV infection. After the peak of NK cell response, the proportion of active Caspase 3/7+ Ly49H+ NK cells was smaller in Themis2-/- mice than in WT mice on days 7, 17, and 28 postinfection (Fig. 1g). By contrast, Themis2 deficiency had little impact on the frequencyof Ki-67+ NK cells and expression of BimandBcl-2 during MCMV infection (Supplementary Fig. 4d\u2013f). These results indicate that Themis2 negatively regulates Caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis in the contraction and memory phases.\nTo confirm these findings, we used Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK-CreERT2 mice and tracked the fate of MCMV-primed YFP+Ly49H+KLRG1+ NK cells after tamoxifen administration following MCMV infection (Fig. 1h). We observed a higher percentage of MCMVprimed YFP+ NK cells in the Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK-CreERT2 mice than in the Themis2+/+ NK-CreERT2 mice on day 7 pi (Supplementary Fig. 5a). AlthoughMCMV-primed Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 YFP+Ly49H+ NK cells showed equivalent expression of KLRG1 and Ly6C on day 7 pi (Supplementary Fig. 5a), the number and proportion of Themis2\u2013/\u2013 YFP+Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells were larger than those of Themis2+/+ YFP+Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells in the expansion, contraction, and memory phases during MCMV infection (Fig. 1i and Supplementary Fig. 5b). MCMV-primed long-lived Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 YFP+Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells on day 28 pi displayed a memory immunophenotype (defined as YFP+Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1- to low NK cells) (Supplementary Fig. 5c). However, as shown in Fig. 1f, the number and proportion ofmemory Themis2\u2013/\u2013NK cells were larger than those of memory Themis2+/+ NK cells in the spleen on day 28 pi (Fig. 1j). Together, these findings demonstrate that Themis2 quantitatively inhibits NK cell memory formation during MCMV infection.\nThemis2 negatively regulates the memory NK cell function To examine whether Themis2 regulates the effector function of memory NK cells, na\u00efve WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells and memory WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells derived from the spleen of recipient Tyrobp\u2013/\u2013 mice on 28 pi as shown in Fig. 1c were co-cultured with m157-expressing RMA cells. Memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed greater degranulation and IFN-\u03b3 production after co-culture with m157-expressing RMA cells compared with memory WT NK cells and na\u00efve Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells (Fig. 2a). To examine secondary expansion of these memory NK cells, Tyrobp\u2013/\u2013 mice received memory WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells at a ratio of one to one and were infected with MCMV. Memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed a more robust secondary expansion than did memory WT NK cells (Fig. 2b).\nTo analyze the function of memory Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells in the eradication of MCMV, we isolated na\u00efve or memory Ly49H+ NK cells from uninfected and MCMV-infected Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK-CreERT2 mice on day 28 pi, transferred these NK cells separately into na\u00efve Tyrobp\u2013/\u2013 mice, and then challenged these mice with MCMV. The memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells conferred greater improved protection fromMCMV infection to the recipient mice than didmemoryThemis2+/+NKcells and na\u00efve Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013NK cells (Fig. 2c). Together, these results indicate that Themis2 negatively regulates the quality, as well as quantity, of memory NK cells.\nThemis2 is translocated into the nucleus of NK cells Themis2 was predicted to have a bipartite NLS. Since Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed enhanced memory formation after MCMV infection, it was likely that the activation signal via Ly49H induces translocation of Themis2 in the nucleus. To address the issue, we expressed GFP-fused THEMIS2 in a human NK cell line NKL expressing Ly49H. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that THEMIS2 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm; however, stimulation with an antiLy49H mAb induced translocation of THEMIS2 into the nucleus, with concentrations in the nucleus peaking at 24 to 48 h after stimulation (Fig. 3a, b). To examine the subcellular localization of Themis2 in primary mouse NK cells, na\u00efve Ly49H+ NK cells, effector Ly49H+ NK cells, and memory NK cells were purified from the spleen of na\u00efve and MCMV-infected and tamoxifen-administered Themis2+/+ NK-CreERT2 mice. Whereas Themis2 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm of na\u00efve Ly49H+ NK cells, an equivalent amount of Themis2 was observed in the nucleus of effector Ly49H+ NK cells and memory NK cells (Fig. 3c, d). Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation signal via Ly49H induces thenuclear translocationof Themis2 in NK cells and suggest that Themis2 is involved in transcriptional or epigenetic events for the differentiation into effector and memory NK cells after MCMV infection.\nThemis2 regulates transcriptional and epigenetic changes To analyze the role of Themis2 in the nucleus, we performed RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of trimethylation at the 4th lysine residue of the histone H3 (H3K4me3) and acetylation at the 27th lysine residue of histone H3 (H3K27ac), epigenetic markers of active promoters and regulatory regions correlated with active transcription, respectively, by using na\u00efve and memory NK cells from naive and MCMV-infected Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NKCreERT2 mice (Fig. 4a). A gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) betweenmemory Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells (hereinafter, memory DEGs, Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013c) yielded enriched signatures associated with the apoptosis, transcription, and cell cycle (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6d). A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that memory Themis2+/+ NK cells showed enrichment of gene sets found in activated and effector T cells, whereas memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed those found in memory T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6e), suggesting that the loss of Themis2 promotes differentiation into memory NK cells by changing the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7200 4\ntranscriptional profile. Moreover, memory DEG promoters showed significant enrichment of binding motifs for transcription factors (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 6f). These findings raised the possibility that Themis2 inhibits the differentiation of memory NK cells by participating in transcriptional regulation after nuclear translocation.\nThemis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells did not show any obvious differences in their epigenome-wide H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes, irrespective of whether they were na\u00efve and memory NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a). However, pairwise intersection heatmaps of the H3K4me3 andH3K27ac regions in na\u00efve andmemoryNK cells revealed thatmemory Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013NK cells haddistinct epigenetic profiles, particularly in the H3K4me3 region, as indicated by the observed negative correlation (Fig. 4d). To examine the function of the differentially accessible regions (DAR) between memory Themis2+/+ and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells, the H3K4me3 DARs uniquely present in either memory WT or Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells were extracted (Supplementary\nFig. 7b), and their single nearest genes (hereafter, memory H3K4me3 DAR genes) were identified (Supplementary Fig. 7c). GO analysis of the memory H3K4me3 DAR genes revealed signatures associated with the cell cycle, apoptosis, and transcription (Fig. 4e). Memory H3K4me3 DAR gene promoters showed significant enrichment of bindingmotifs\nfor members of the KLF, C2H2 zinc finger, and the ETS families (Fig. 4f andSupplementary Fig. 7d). These results overlappedwith thoseof the GO analysis and motif analysis of memory DEGs (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 6f).\nTo examine the non-promoterH3K27ac-marked regions, H3K27ac DARs uniquely present in either memory Themis2+/+ or Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells were extracted; H3K27ac DARs overlapping with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-bound distal and proximal enhancer-like signatures (ELS) available in ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/) were further extracted to highlight non-promoter H3K27ac regions; and then their single nearest genes (hereinafter, memory H3K27ac DAR distal or proximal ELS genes) were identified (Supplementary Fig. 7e). Unlike memory H3K4me3 DAR genes, memory H3K27ac DAR distal ELS genes showed enriched signatures associated with the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes and leukocytes (Supplementary\nFig. 7f). In contrast,memoryH3K27acDARproximal ELS genes showed enriched signatures associated with the cell cycle (Supplementary Fig. 7g).\nWe assessed the correlation ofH3K4me3 andH3K27ac landscapes in na\u00efve and memory Themis2+/+ or Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells by using the unified atlas of these H3K4me3 and H3K27ac regions.

The copy number of MCMV IE1 gene in the spleen and liver was quantified on day 3 pi. Data are pooled from 2 experiments (n = 4 mice (Naive), 8 mice (Memory), and 1 mouse (No NK)). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA. Data are presented as mean values \u00b1SD (a\u2013c).

We also examined the correlation of gene expression of memory DEGs and signals of memory H3K4me3 DARs. The scatter plots suggested the possibility that Themis2 might be involved in gene expression and promoter accessibility of transcription-associated genes (Supplementary Fig. 7i).\nTogether, these findings support the hypothesis that Themis2 negatively regulates NK cell memory formation through the transcriptional regulation of apoptosis-associated genes in the nucleus, in addition to the negative regulation of activation signaling via Ly49H in the cytoplasm.\nThemis2 promotes Zfp740-mediated transcriptional repression To identify Themis2-binding nuclear proteins, the nuclear proteins of MCMV-primed effector Ly49H+ NK cells from the spleen of MCMVinfected and tamoxifen-administered Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK-CreERT2 mice were incubated with recombinant FLAG-tagged Themis2 protein (Themis2-FLAG); the Themis2-bound proteins were then immunoprecipitatedwith an anti-FLAGmAb (Supplementary Fig. 8a\u2013c and Fig. 5a), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-offlight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A MASCOT search identified nine transcription factors and one epigenetic enzyme expressed in NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 8d), implying that Themis2 preferentially interacts with transcription factors in the nucleus of NK cells.\nTo identify the key transcription factor for memory NK cell differentiation, we analyzed the lists of transcription factors predicted by motif analyses ofmemoryDEGpromoters andmemoryH3K4me3DAR\ngene promoters (Fig. 4c, f, and Supplementary Fig. 6f, 7d) and compared those lists with a list of Themis2-bound transcription factors detected by MADLI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 5b). Consequently, Zfp740, a zinc finger protein with unknown function, was found to be common among the three lists of transcription factors (Fig. 5b).Mouse Zfp740 (UniProt Q6NZQ6) is a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor with three zinc finger domains and a low complexity disordered region. Mouse Zfp740 and human ZNF740 (UniProt Q8NDX6) have high homology (Blastp E-value, 3 \u00d7 10\u2212114), and their C-terminus amino acid sequences containing zinc finger domains are identical. Although no studies have reported the role ofmouse Zfp740, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that human ZNF740 has an RNA polymerase IIspecific transcription factor with DNA-binding activity and that it interacts with Polycomb-group proteins BMI1 (aka PCGF4) and RNF2 (aka RING1B) (Supplementary Fig. 8e), both of which are core components of Polycomb repressive complex 137. These results suggest that Zfp740 might be involved in transcriptional repression by interactingwith transcriptional repressor complexes. Zfp740was located in the nucleus in 293 T cells expressing MYC-tagged Zfp740 protein (Zfp740-MYC), as determined by immunoblotting analysis with antiMYCmAb (Supplementary Fig. 8f).Moreover, nuclear Themis2protein was physically associated with the Zfp740 protein in 293 T cells coexpressing Zfp740-MYC and Themis2-FLAG with an additional NLS (referred to as NLS-Themis2-FLAG) for efficient nuclear localization (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8f).\nTo determine the mode of action of Zfp740 as a transcription factor, we designed luciferase reporter constructs driven by a promoter harboring either the Zfp740-binding motif predicted by the\na b\nc d\nIsotype Ig Anti-Ly49H\nTHEMIS2 DAPI\nThemis2-/- Themis2+/+\nNa\u00efve Ly49H+ NK Na\u00efve Ly49H+ NK Effector Ly49H+ NK Memory NK\nThemis2 DAPI\nIsotype Ig Anti-Ly49H\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n6 4824 Stimulation (h)\nTH EM\nIS 2-\nG FP\nin th\ne nu\ncl eu s pe r L y4 9H -N KL c el l ( % )\np = 0.0058 p = 0.000821 p = 0.00149\np = 0.617 p = 0.999 p = 0.033\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nNa\u00efve MemoryEffector\nTh em\nis 2\nin th\ne nu\ncl eu s pe r N K ce ll (% )\np < 0.0001 p < 0.0001 p = 0.597\nFig. 3 | Themis2 is translocated into the nucleus of NK cells. a Subcellular localization of THEMIS2 in a human natural killer (NK) cell line NKL-Ly49H cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused THEMIS2 after stimulation with anti-Ly49H mAb for 24 h.

Zfp740 reduced the luciferase activity in a Zfp740-binding motif-dependent manner (Fig. 5d). Next, we addressed the effect of nuclear Themis2 on the transcriptional activity of Zfp740 by co-expression with or without NLS-Themis2. Although NLS-Themis2 alone had little impact on luciferase activity, co-expression of NLS-Themis2 and Zfp740 significantly reduced it, as compared with Zfp740 alone (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that Zfp740 is a transcriptional repressor and Themis2 promotes Zfp740mediated transcriptional repression.\nZfp740 inhibits differentiation of memory NK cells Zfp740 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the organs of mice and similarly expressed in most immune cell subsets, including na\u00efve,\neffector, and long-lived Ly49H+ and Ly49H- NK cell subsets (Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013c). We generated Zfp740-deficient (Zfp740\u2013/\u2013) mice, and these mice showed normal NK cell development (Supplementary\nFig. 9d\u2013g). To determine the role of Zfp740 in NK cell memory formation, Tyrobp\u2013/\u2013 mice received CD45.1+ WT Ly49H+ NK cells and CD45.2+ Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells at a 1:1 ratio and were then infected with MCMV. The activation and differentiation markers KLRG1 and Ly6C were equivalently upregulated on the MCMV-primed donor WT and Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells on day 7 pi (Supplementary Fig. 9h). Unlike MCMV-primed effector Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells (Fig. 1d), the proliferation of MCMV-primed effector Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells was comparable to that of effector WT Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells on day7 pi (Fig. 6a).

These long-livedWTand Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+KLRG1high NK cells on day 28 pi displayed an equivalent memory immunophenotype (Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1- to lowCD11b+CD27-) (Supplementary\nFig. 9j). However, a higher percentage and number of MCMV-primed memory Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 NK cells (stringently defined as Ly49H+KLRG1highLy6C+DNAM-1-tolowCD11b+CD27- NK cells) werepresent in the spleen on day 28 pi, as compared with the MCMV-primed memory WT NK cell population (Fig. 6c). These results demonstrate that Zfp740 inhibits NK cell memory formation during MCMV infection, even though Zfp740 is dispensable for the expansion of effector NK cells.\nMemory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells highly expressed anti-apoptosisassociated genes with GO terms related to the negative regulation of apoptosis, such as Niban2, Bcl10, Map4k4, and Sirt138\u201341, whose promoters had putative Zfp740-binding sequences, as compared with memory WT NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 9k). Consistent with these results, memory Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 NK cells highly expressed the anti-\napoptosis-associated genes with promoters bearing putative Zfp740binding sequences, compared with memory WT NK cells (Fig. 6d). These findings support the possibility that Themis2 and Zfp740 inhibit the differentiation and persistence of memory NK cells through transcriptional repression of anti-apoptosis-associated genes during MCMV infection.\nTo investigate whether Zfp740 impacts the effector function of NK cells, na\u00efve andmemoryWT and Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells were cocultured with m157-expressing RMA cells. Although na\u00efve WT and Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells degranulated and produced IFN-\u03b3 against m157-expressing RMA cells to the same degree, memory Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed more efficient degranulation and IFN-\u03b3 production against m157-expressing RMA cells compared with memory WT NK cells and na\u00efve WT and Zfp740\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells (Fig. 6e). These findings demonstrate that Zfp740 suppresses the effector function of memory, but not of na\u00efve, NK cells. Thus, Zfp740 also negatively regulates the quantity and quality of NK cell memory formation."

Moreover, Themis2 was translocated into the nucleus in Ly49H+ NK cells following MCMV infection. In the nucleus, Themis2 promoted Zfp740-mediated transcriptional repression of anti-apoptosis-associated genes to regulate the persistence of memory NK cells. Thus, Themis2 qualitatively and quantitatively limits the formation of NK cell memory (Supplementary Fig. 10).\nThere is limited literature describing the function of Themis2 in immune cells. In contrast to an inhibitory effect of Themis2 on Ly49H signaling, previous reports have demonstrated thatThemis2promotes activation of ERK and p38, augmenting Toll-like and B cell receptor signals in macrophages and B cells, respectively34,35. These findings imply that Themis2 exerts an activating or inhibitory function in a stimulus- or cell-type-dependent manner. Themis1 is a well-studied Themis family protein with similar domain architectures to those of Themis236. Although Themis1 is required for the activation of thymocytes throughmodulation of T cell receptor signaling42,43, more recent studies have revealed that Themis1 forms a complex with SHP-1 and increases phosphatase activity through stabilization of phosphorylated SHP-144,45.

The phosphorylation of ZAP70/SYK, which are signaling molecules downstream of DAP12, triggers the activation of multiple signaling adaptors and enzymes, including PLC\u03b31/248. PLC\u03b31/2 catalyzes the production of the secondmessengers diacylglycerol and inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate, which triggers PKC activation and an increased Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, and the subsequent Ca2+-calcineurin signaling, resulting in nuclear translocation of NFAT48. Thus, Themis2 might promote SHP-1mediated dephosphorylation of the protein substrates of the tyrosine kinases linked to activating NK receptors, including Ly49H, which contributes to the downregulation of the Ca2+ influx. Notably, SHP-1 limits the proliferation of Ly49H+ NK cells and host protection against MCMV infection49. Thus, Themis2 likely forms a complex with SHP-1 and presumably with DAP12 and or ZAP70 (Supplementary Fig. 3d and 3e), and attenuates Ly49H signaling, resulting in restricted effector function of na\u00efve and memory NK cells. Furthermore, na\u00efve Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells showed augmented effector functions after stimulation of NKG2D, NKp46, and NK1.1 (NKR-P1C), as well as Ly49H, suggesting that the cytoplasmic Themis2 may have an inhibitory role in activation signaling through a diverse group of activating NK receptors, irrespective of na\u00efve or memory NK cells. Interestingly, Zfp740 also inhibited the effector function of memory NK cells. Thus, the enhanced effector function of memory Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK cells may be attributable to the loss of Themis2-mediated inhibition of activation signaling in the cytoplasm and the loss of Themis2-Zfp740 complexmediated repression in the nucleus.\nIntriguingly, Themis2 regulated Caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis ofMCMV-primed effector andmemoryNK cells in the contraction and memory phases,whereasThemis2had little impact on the apoptosis in na\u00efve NK cells. In addition, Themis2 inhibited effector functions and proliferation of na\u00efve and memory Ly49H+ NK cells. These results suggest that Themis2 regulates the effector function and or survival of na\u00efve and differentiated NK cells. On the other hand, although Zfp740 regulated the survival and the effector function of memory NK cells, the effector function of na\u00efve NK cells was not affected by Zfp740. It is presumed that the Zfp740 function is specific, particularly to regulating the expression of anti-apoptosis-associated genes in memory NK cells.\nThe comprehensive understanding of Themis2-bound nuclear proteins in na\u00efve, effector, and memory NK cells would be important, because differential Themis2-bound proteins may regulate NK cell memory. However, there is a technical limitation: The quantity of nuclear protein obtained from an NK cell. Mouse NK cells per spleen yield smaller than 100\u03bcg nuclear proteins. Further, the frequency of memory NK cells is approximately 10% in splenic NK cells in Themis2\u2013/\u2013 NK-CreERT2 mice (Fig. 1j). To overcome the issue, we used effector Ly49H+ NK cells to identify Themis2-binding transcription factors, because they are increased in number on days 7-10 pi. However, it seems technically impossible to obtain an adequate amount of nuclear proteins from memory NK cells. Although we were interested in Themis2-bound nuclear proteins in na\u00efve, effector, and memory NK cells comprehensively, effector NK cells were realistic for the pulldown and the subsequent mass spectrometry. Future studies using other methods might clarify the roles of differential Themis2-bound nuclear proteins in controlling NK cell memory.\nTranscriptional repression is achieved by the combinatorial mechanismsof action of a variety of repressor complexes consisting of transcriptional repressors, co-factors, and epigenetic regulators, and often through enzymatic histone modifications for epigenetic\nsilencing50. Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) constitute a conserved gene silencing system that plays pivotal roles in embryogenesis, development, and differentiation processes37. Zfp740 is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors that activate or repress the expression of genes involved in development and differentiation51. HumanZNF740 is physically associatedwith BMI1 and RNF2 (Supplementary Fig. 8e)52, both of which are core components of PRC137. Given the conserved function of mouse Zfp740 and human ZNF740 with their identical zinc finger domain amino acid sequences, onepossible scenario is that the Themis2-Zfp740 complexparticipates in PRC1-mediated transcriptional repression; the complex binds to Zfp740-binding sequences of the regulatory elements and might recruit PRC1 for stable silencing of Zfp740 target genes in memory NK cells. A recent study has reported that an ETS family transcriptional factor, Fli1, restricts the formation of memory precursor Ly6C- Ly49H+ NK cells with increased protein expression of Bcl-2 at the early stage of MCMV infection29. In the present study, the populations of WT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly6C+ Ly49H+ NK cells showed comparable each other on day 7 pi (Supplementary Fig. 4a, 5a), andWT and Themis2\u2013/\u2013 Ly49H+ NK cells equivalently expressed Bcl-2 during MCMV infection (Supplementary Fig. 4e), suggesting that Themis2 may not be involved in the regulation of the size of the memory precursor NK cell pool. We also identified Fli1 in our motif analyses of memory DEG promoters and memory H3K4me3 DAR gene promoters (Fig. 5b). It is possible that multiple transcriptional factors, including Zfp740 and Fli1, redundantly and independently control the quantity and quality of memory NK cells with different modes of action at the same or distinct regulatory elements. The cooperative interactions of Zfp740, Fli1, and Polycomb group proteins in forming NK cell memory have not yet been examined. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic role of Zfp740 and Themis2 in Zfp740-mediated repression, i.e., identification of Zfp740 target genes and their biological processes regulatedby Zfp740 repressor complexwith orwithout Themis2. Such investigations might reveal the core molecular identity of NK cell memory, although a current technical limitation is the lack of a chromatin immunoprecipitation-validated antibody against Zfp740.\nHere, we demonstrated that Themis2 deficiency reinforces expansion, persistence, effector functions, and memory differentiation of MCMV-primed Ly49H+ NK cells and that it confers improved host protection againstMCMV infection. All these features ofThemis2deficient NK cells appear beneficial for anti-viral and anti-tumor immunity.We also found thatThemis2deficiencydidnotdisadvantage NK cells; hence, the physiological relevance of Themis2 is still unknown. The functional properties of memory NK cells are attractive for developing NK cell-based immunotherapies for incurable infectious diseases and malignancies. Thus, further studies of the detailed molecular mechanisms of Themis2-mediated inhibition of NK cell function are needed to gain important insights into the identity of NK cell memory; such studiesmight provide opportunities for developing therapeutic interventions to selectively unleash NK cells to combat viral infections and cancers."
