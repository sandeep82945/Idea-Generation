    "abstractText": "Problems related to wavelength assignment (WA) in optical communications networks involve allocating transmission wavelengths for known transmission paths between nodes that minimize a certain objective function, for example, the total number of wavelengths. Playing a central role in modern telecommunications, this problem belongs to NP-complete class for a general case, so that obtaining optimal solutions for industry relevant cases is exponentially hard. In this work, we propose and develop a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the wavelength assignment problem. We propose an advanced embedding procedure for this problem into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form having an improvement in the number of iterations with priceto-pay being a slight increase in the number of variables (\u201cspins\u201d). Then we compare a quantuminspired technique for solving the corresponding QUBO form against classical heuristic and industrial combinatorial solvers. The obtained numerical results indicate on an advantage of the quantuminspired approach in a substantial number of test cases against the industrial combinatorial solver that works in the standard setting. Our results pave the way to the use of quantum-inspired algorithms for practical problems in telecommunications and open a perspective for the further analysis of the employ of quantum computing devices.",

Playing a central role in modern telecommunications, this problem belongs to NP-complete class for a general case, so that obtaining optimal solutions for industry relevant cases is exponentially hard. In this work, we propose and develop a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving the wavelength assignment problem. We propose an advanced embedding procedure for this problem into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form having an improvement in the number of iterations with priceto-pay being a slight increase in the number of variables (\u201cspins\u201d). Then we compare a quantuminspired technique for solving the corresponding QUBO form against classical heuristic and industrial combinatorial solvers. The obtained numerical results indicate on an advantage of the quantuminspired approach in a substantial number of test cases against the industrial combinatorial solver that works in the standard setting. Our results pave the way to the use of quantum-inspired algorithms for practical problems in telecommunications and open a perspective for the further analysis of the employ of quantum computing devices.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOptimization is a tool with applications across various technologies [1]. However, solving complex real-world optimization problems is computationally intensive even in the case of using advanced, specialzed hardware. Quantum computers are widely believed to be useful for solving computationally difficult optimization problems beyond the capability of existing computing devices is to use quantum optimization [2\u20136]. A general approach consists in encoding a cost function in a quantum Hamiltonian [7], so that its low-energy state is obtained starting from a generic initial state. Among existing methods to achieve such dynamics, quantum annealing offers physical implementations of a non-trivial size [8]. Quantum annealing is by now explored for analysis of various areas, such as chemistry calculations [9, 10], lattice protein folding [11, 12], genome assembly [13, 14], solving polynomial systems of equations for engineering applications [15] and linear equations for regression [15], portfolio optimization [16\u201319], forecasting crashes [20], finding optimal trading trajectories [21], optimal arbitrage opportunities [22], optimal feature selection in credit scoring [23], foreign exchange reserves management [24], traffic optimization [25\u201327], scheduling [28\u201333], railway conflict management [32, 33], and many others [5]. Advances also include the recent experimental demonstration of a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions for the hardest maximum independent set graphs [34].\nAlthough quantum optimization algorithms suggest an intriguing possibility to solve computationally difficult problems beyond the capability of classical computers, exiting conceptual and technical limitations make it challenging to use it for solving problems of industry relevant sizes. Attempts to simulate quantum computations classically resulted in a new class of algorithms and techniques know as quantum-inspired [35, 36].\nAs soon as these algorithms are compatible with currently existing (classical) hardware, analyzing their limiting capabilities and advantages over classical approaches are required towards their use in practice. Specifically, a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems via simulating the coherent Ising machine (SimCIM) has been proposed [35]. SimCIM algorithm is able to solve optimization problems that are formulated in the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) / Ising form, which can be done for various practically relevant cases [7]. The SimCIM approach has demonstrated capabilities to outperform bona fide coherent Ising machine and existing classical methods for certain GSet graphs. However, one of the arising questions is related to the need in to tune hyperaparameters [35]. For a wide range of benchmark of quantum-inspired heuristic solvers for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, namely D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service, Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine, Fujitsu Digital Annealer, and simulated annealing on a personal computer, see also Ref. [37].\nDesign of optical communication network is a specific industrial avenue, in which combinatorial optimisation in ubiquitous. Examples of tasks include finding optimal transmission and reservation paths, frequency allocation, network throughput maximization and many others [38, 39]. A notable example is the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which consists in allocating transmission wavelengths and finding transmission paths between nodes that minimize the total number of wavelengths. Conventional techniques, such as linear programming and mixed integer programming, are useful for most of the cases; however, the combinatorial nature and hardness of the problems make it extremely challenging to apply these techniques for large-scale problems. It is then reasonable to assume that telecommunication industry may benefit from the use of quantum-inspired algorithm in the near-term horizon and quantum comar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n00 31\n7v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 9\nJa n\n20 23\n2 Optical fiber\nPath 1\nPath 2\nPath 3\nPath 4\nPath 5\n1 2 3 4 5\nPath 1\nPath 2\nPath 3\nPath 4\nPath 5\n2-3 3-41-2 4-5\n3-51-3\n2-4\n1-2\n1-3 2-3\n2-4 3-4 3-5\n4-5\nFIG. 1. Illustration of the approach. A linear network with generated requests and paths consisting of 5 nodes, 4 edges, and 5 traffic paths is considered: Solid lines represent original edges, and the arrows lines represent traffic paths. One can reduce the WA problem to a graph coloring problem with a simple graph transformation (bottom of the figure): Each traffic path is now considered a vertex; if two traffic paths share (at least) one fiber they are connected by an edge.\nputing in the future [40, 41]. In this study, we consider the variant of the RWA problem. To explain more precisely, we focus on the wavelength assignment task for known routes which we further refer to as the wavelength assignment (WA) problem. This problem is generally NP-hard, so its solution is computationally challenging for large sizes. We propose an original way to transform the WA problem to the QUBO form, which makes it compatible with quantum-inspired optimization algorithm and, in principle, quantum annealing hardware. For solving this problem, we develop a technique based on the SimCIM quantum-inspired optimization solver [35] with the use of the Lagrange multipliers for minimizing the number of hyperparameters. Our numerical results indicate on an advantage of the quantum-inspired solver in a number of test cases against the industrial combinatorial solver working on the standard settings."

A single optical link can be shared between several paths given that each path is assigned different wavelengths. Each path is indicated by the path ID, which uniquely identifies a pair of transmitting/receiving nodes, sequence of interconnecting nodes, and the wavelength ID.\nThe WA problem implies allocation of the wavelength IDs for paths that are pre-computed and known a priori in such a way to meet the target objective, for example, the number of the used wavelengths is minimized 1. Formally, WA is considered to be correct if and only if it satisfies the following requirements: (i) each path should use a single wavelength and (ii) several paths sharing the same edge should have different wavelengths.\nThe problem of finding correct wavelength allocation under given constraints is equivalent to the coloring problem [7] in transformed graph G = (V,E), where nodes V and edges E representing paths and their intersections in fibers, correspondingly (two nodes from V are connected if and only if the corresponding paths have an intersection within the optical network). Let NV and NE denote numbers of vertices and edges of G, respectively. Later we interchangeably use terms wavelengths and colors since the underlying problems are formally identical. The example of the correspondence of network paths to graph coloring mapping is shown in Fig. 2.\nIn order to define a particular coloring of graph G with at most W colors, we introduce a two collections of aux-\n1 We note that other objectives for optimization are also possible, such as total throughput or network resiliency.\n3 iliary variables.

(5)\nOne can see that constraint (4) assures that each vertex is assigned to exactly one wavelength, while constraint (5) indicates that two adjacent vertices are not assigned the same wavelength.\nThis problem is generally NP-hard, so its solution is computationally challenging for large sizes. As it is shown below, the QUBO reduction makes the problem compatible with quantum-inspired algorithms that can shift tractability boundaries to higher problem sizes. While such reduction usually involves additional overheads in the problem size due to auxiliary variables, the overheads can be compensated by the computational advantage of quantum-inspired solvers leading to better overall results."

            "text": "In order to make the WA problem compatible with the SimCIM quantum-inspired optimization algorithm [35], we first consider a transformation, allowing one to convert the IP problem (3)\u2013(5) into a QUBO form as follows:\nsTQs\u2192 min (6)\nfor a certain binary vector s and the symmetric real matrix Q. This problem is equivalent to finding a configuration of binary-state particles (\u201cspins\u201d) that minimizes the energy\nH(s) = sTQs, (7)\nwhere the Ising Hamiltonian H consists of only singleorder terms (energies of individual spins in external magnetic field) and pair-wise interactions between spins. Although spin variables usually are considered to take values \u00b11, the transition to a binary form is quite straightforward [13].\nA known way [7] to transform a graph coloring problem to the QUBO form, is to set s := x (here we treat x as a NVW -dimensional vector), and use the Hamiltonian of the form\nH(x) = H1(x) +H2(x), (8)\nwhere\nH1(x) = NV\u2211 v=1\n( 1\u2212\nW\u2211 i=1 xvi\n)2 , (9)\nH2(x) = \u2211\n(u,v)\u2208E W\u2211 i=1 xuixvi. (10)\nOne can see that H1(x) > 0 in the case where single node is assigned with two distinct colors, whileH2(x) > 0 when two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color. If minimization routine provides some x such that H(x) = 0, then x defines a correct coloring with at most W colors. Therefore, an ability to solve the QUBO problem corresponding to Hamiltonian (8) garantees one to solve a decision problem of whether it is possible to color a graph with at most W colors. Since it is always possible to color a graph with W = NV colors, a minimal number of colors can be obtained, for example, by using a standard binary search with at most dlog2(NV )e iterations. We note that this approach is quite sensitive to possible imperfections of QUBO problem solutions, especially at first iterations of the binary search. An alternative way is to decrease W by unit at each step, that however, results in a possible increase of iteration numbers up to O(Wstart), where Wstart is the initial upper bound for colors number.\nB. Improving QUBO transformation for quantum-inspired annealing\nWe propose an improved approach for solving graph coloring problem by developing an alternative transformation into a QUBO form. In our approach we pursue two major goals. The first is decreasing the number of QUBO problems to be solved. The second is making the whole algorithm robust against the possibility of finding not optimal, but some suboptimal solution for a particular QUBO problem. We note that these points are of particular importance in the framework of using (quantuminspired) annealing for solving QUBO problems.\nThe main idea of our approach is to consider an extended NV (W+1)-dimensional binary vector s := (w,x)\n4 and take the target Hamiltonian in the following form:\nH(w,x) = c0H0(w) + c1 [H1(x) +H2(x)] + c2H3(w,x), (11)\nwhere\nH0(w) = W\u2211 i=1 wi, (12)\nH3(w,x) = \u2211\n(u,v)\u2208E W\u2211 i=1 (1\u2212 wi) (xui + xvi) , (13)\nand ci are positive coefficients satisfying a particular constraint (see more details in Methods V A). Minimization of this Hamitonian provides us the solution vector (w,x) such that the optimal number of wavelength is encoded in w by non-zero values. We note that the term H0(w) grows with the total number of used wavelengths; H1(x) and H2(x) have the same form as in Eq. (8); and H3(w,x) is responsible for the relationship wi \u2265 xvi, which becomes positive when the relation is violated. Both terms H2(x) and H3(w,x) correspond to inequalities (5) in the IP form (see Methods V).\nThe complete algorithm of solving graph coloring problem (WA problem) is shown in Algorithm 1. The algorithm employs a subroutine make qubo(G,W ) that generates the corresponding QUBO matrix Q with respect to Hamiltonian (11), given input graph G and the target number of the wavelengths W . The QUBO problem is then solved with subroutine solve qubo(Q), which finds the optimal spins vector s = (w,x) using the quantuminspired SimCIM approach for the QUBO matrix Q as defined in Ref. [35]. In order check the validness of obtained solution, we use check coloring(G,x) that validates the fulfilment of Eq. (4) and Eq. (5).\nAlgorithm 1 Solving graph coloring problem with improved transformation\nRequire: W is the initial upper bound on the number of wavelengths Require: make qubo(G,W ) \u2192 Q Require: solve qubo(Q) \u2192 (w,x) Require: check coloring(G,x) \u2192 true/false\nreturns true if coloring is correct\n1: xopt := 0 . initializing solution variable 2: W \u2032 := W . current number of colors 3: while W \u2032 \u2265 1 do 4: Q := make qubo(G,W \u2032) 5: (w,x) := solve qubo(Q) 6: if check coloring(G,x) = true then\n7: W \u2032 := \u2211W \u2032\ni=1 wi \u2212 1 8: xopt := x 9: else\n10: break 11: return xopt\nOne can see that, if solve qubo(Q) provides an optimal solution, then the whole problem is solved in the first\niteration. However, even in the case when the obtained solution is sub-optimal, the updated problem with the reduced upper bound W becomes easier to solve, and the algorithm converges with a few numbers of iterations."

We note that in the case of the quantum-inspired optimization with SimCIM, we solve the problem in the QUBO form (11), whereas in case of Gurobi and GLPK we use the IP formulation of graph coloring [see Eqs. (3)\u2013(5)]. Additionally, we include the results obtained via largest degree first (LDF) heuristics used as the baseline, since it allows one to instantly produce feasible coloring without numerical optimization. We also ran the experiments for original QUBO transormation proposed in Ref. [7] and compared them to our proposed QUBO in the Table IV in Appendix.\nOur numerical experiments have been performed on a synthetic dataset of 900 randomly generated graphs with varying nodes number and edge probability (for details, see Methods V C). The main characteristics that we are interested in are time-to-solution (TTS) and the number of colors in the obtained solution. The total runtime has been limited by 300 seconds, and the the best solutions have been compared. Results are averaged over 90 runs for each graph size (for details, see Table V).

Moreover, the runtime of SimCIM is better for large-scale (90 and 100 nodes) graphs as it is indicated in Table II. Such trend can be explained. As the number of nodes increases, the number of inequalities in the ILP formulation of the problem grows rapidly. The number of inequalities is equal to the product of the number of edges by the number of colors available for coloring the vertices of the graph. So the complexity of the problem for the ILP solver increases rapidly with the number of nodes. GLPK shows a stable result up to 30 nodes and becomes unstable further after a timeout interrupt without any solution with more than 10 percent instances. We note that the comparison between our quantum-inspired approach and Gurobi is conducted in the common setting, so its additional tuning for obtaining better results is also possible. At the same time, we find it interesting that quantum-inspired technique shows comparable or superior results in harder, industry relevant combinatorial optimization problem."

In this domain, much attention is paid to quantum computing, which is believed to be useful for such class of problems. At the current technological level, practical quantum advantage, for example, in optimization is still needed to be achieved. An interesting part of this research is understanding of the physical origin of the potential advantages of quantum computing technologies. Attempts to simulate quantum computation classically resulted in a new class of algorithms and methods know as quantum-inspired, which are ready to be tested for industry-relevant problems.\nIn this work, we have considered the industry important problem in the field of telecommunications. We have demonstrated a way to make it compatible with quantum and quantum-inspired techniques. Interestingly, our numerical results have indicated on an advantage of the quantum-inspired solver in a number of test cases against the industrial combinatorial solver working on the standard settings.\nOne may expect that the additional tuning of the industry grade commercial optimization solver may result in a substantial improving of its performance. At the same time, studying the origins of the advantages of the quantum-inspired approach, which are largely beyond the scope of the present proof-of-concept demonstration, would allow its further progress as well.\nWe would like to note that our comparison is limited by the upper bound of 100 nodes, since it allows us to run all solvers in equivalent hardware setup using CPU mode\n6 on single core. Further analysis of larger graphs requires running SimCIM solver on GPU card, which gives significant acceleration factor not directly available in conventional MIP algorithms, which are heavily dependent on graph processing routines. As for the multi-core CPU execution environment, some MIP solvers can benefit from such setup by running various optimization strategies and hyperparameters simultaneously. Such speed up quickly reaches saturation point at the level of 8 16 cores (with around 2x improvement in accordance with Gurobi experiments, see slide 26 [46]) and demonstrates no substantial improvement at higher concurrency levels. On the other side, quantum-inspired approach exploits parallelism on the level of starting optimization points, which demonstrates slower, but stable performance increase at the higher levels of concurrency (100\u223c 1000 parallel units of execution). Thus, we conduct our benchmarks exclusively using CPU mode on single-core to avoid bias towards either solution approach. In order to maintain fairness of comparison for larger graphs our benchmark routine should be further revised to account for heterogeneous (CPU/CPU multi-core vs GPU/multi-GPU) computing environments."

            "text": "The main step in solving an optimization problem using quantum and quantum-inspired annealing is to map the problem of interest to the energy Hamiltonian (socalled Ising Hamiltonian), so the quantum device could find the ground state that corresponds to the optimum value of the objective function. Here we formulate a mapping of the graph coloring problem into QUBO form given by Eq. (6). There is a well-known transformation of the graph G = (V,E) coloring decision model [7] that shows possibility of coloring with some constant number of colors W , but we represent novel QUBO transformation that could minimize number of colors and implement original problem statement Eq. (3-5). The objective function \u2211W i=1 wi could be exactly mapped to the QUBO form: H0(w) = W\u2211 i=1 wi, (16) where, recall, w = (w1, . . . , wW ) is a binary vector indicating colors used in coloring. The constraint \u2211W i=1 xvi = 1 for every v \u2208 V after mapping takes the form H1(x) = NV\u2211 v=1 ( 1\u2212 W\u2211 i=1 xvi )2 , (17)\nwhere NV is the number of nodes in G.\n8 The situation with the second constraint xui+xvi \u2264 wi for every i \u2208 {1, . . . ,W} and (u, v) \u2208 E appears to be more complicated. One can see that it involves three variables, and thus can not be directly embedded into a two-body Hamiltonian. However, we can use the following trick. One can easily check that for arbitrary a, b, c \u2208 {0, 1}, the following equivalence holds:\na+ b \u2264 c\u21d4\n{ ab = 0,\n(1\u2212 c)(a+ b) = 0. (18)\nThis fact allows us to embed the conditions xui+xvi \u2264 wi into two Hamiltonians:\nH2(x) = \u2211\n(u,v)\u2208E W\u2211 i=1 xuixvi, (19)\nH3(w,x) = \u2211\n(u,v)\u2208E W\u2211 i=1 (1\u2212 wi) (xui + xvi) . (20)\nThe resulting Hamiltonian consist of all components sum:\nH(w,x) = c0H0(w) + c1 [H1(x) +H2(x)] + c2H3(w,x), (21)\nwhere c0, c1, and c2 are positive constants stand for a positive penalty value. We note that the sum H1(x)+H2(x) is exactly matched with the classical decision problem [7] and responsible for the correct coloring of the graph. Therefore, H1(x), H2(x) are grouped with the same penalty coefficient c1. Coefficients c0, c1, and c2 should be set manually, using the following criteria: the penalty value c1 should be high enough to keep the final solution from violating constraints. At the same time, too big penalty value can overwhelm the target function, making it difficult to distinguish solutions of different qualities. We establish inequalities for constraint coefficients that show the equivalence of IP and QUBO models of a problem.\nProposition (QUBO penalty coefficients selection). Consider an IP problem given by Eq. (3)-(5) for some maximal colors number W and some graph G = (V,E) with NE edges. If the IP problem has a solution, then the corresponding QUBO problem, given by Hamiltonian (21) with penalty coefficients satisfying\nc1 > 2NEWc2 +Wc0, (22)\nc2 > Wc0, (23)\nhas a solution, equivalent to the solution of the IP problem.\nProof. First, let us rewrite Hamiltonian (21) in the form\nH(w,x) = c0A(w) + c1B(x) + c2C(w,x), (24)\nwhere\nA(w) := H0(w), B(x) := H1(x) +H2(x),\nC(w,x) := H3(w,x). (25)\nNote that A, B, and C can take non negative integer values only. Let (wI,xI) and (wQ,xQ) be solutions of the IP and QUBO problems correspondingly. Our goal is to prove that (i)\nB(xQ) = C(wQ,xQ) = 0, (26)\ni.e., (xQ,wQ) defines a correct coloring, and (ii)\nA(wQ) = W\u2211 i=1 (wI)i, (27)\ni.e., the solution of the QUBO problem coincides with the one of the IP problem.\nFirst, let us see that Eq. (22) assures B(xQ) = 0. The proof of this part is by a contradiction. Suppose that B(xQ) \u2265 1. Consider the difference of energy functions\n\u2206H := H(wQ,xQ)\u2212H(wI,xI) = c0 [A(wQ)\u2212A(wI)] + c1 [B(xQ)\u2212 B(xI)]\n+ c2 [C(wQ,xQ)\u2212 C(wI,xI)] . (28)\nThe correctness of the IP solution implies B(xI) = 0, and so B(xQ) \u2212 B(xI) \u2265 1. The differences in terms with A and C can be lower bounded by the corresponding extreme values:\nA(wQ)\u2212A(wI) \u2265 \u2212W, (29) C(wQ,xQ)\u2212 C(wI,xI) \u2265 \u22122NEW. (30)\nIn this way, Eq. (28) transforms into\n\u2206H \u2265 \u2212c0W + c1 \u2212 2c2NEW > 0, (31)\ngiven constraint (22). However, this result contradicts with the fact that (wQ,xQ) provides the minimal energy. Therefore, B(xQ) = 0, and\nH(wQ,xQ) = c0A(wQ) + c2C(wQ,xQ). (32)\nWe then prove that C(wQ,xQ) is zero as well. Indeed, if C(wQ,xQ) \u2265 1 , then\n\u2206H = c0 [A(wQ)\u2212A(wI)] + c2 [C(wQ,xQ)\u2212 C(wI,xI)]\n\u2265 \u2212c0W + c2 > 0, (33)\nprovided C(wI,xI) = 0 and the second constraint (23). Thus, H(wQ,xQ) = c0A(wQ).\nFinally, A(wQ) = A(wI), since otherwise, either there exist a solution for the QUBO problem that is better than (wQ,xQ), or (xI,wI) is not the true solution the IP problem.\nTherefore, the optimal solution to the QUBO problem appears to be equivalent to the optimal solution to the corresponding IP problem.\n9"

Recall that we take the binary vector of the QUBO problem in the form s = (w,x), i.e. enumerate K = (NV + 1)W binary variables sk and link them to our model variables as follows:\nsk =\n{ wk, k = 1, . . . ,W ,\nxui, k = uW + i, (34)\nwhere u = 1, . . . , NV , i = 1, . . . ,W . The goal is to find vector s that minimizes quadratic form sTQs and we show that it is equivalent to minimizing energy of Hamiltonian (11). Let us denote A the adjacency matrix of network graph G = (V,E) so that auv = 1 if (u, v) \u2208 E and auv = 0 otherwise. We note that sum of v-th column of A equals the degree of the vertex v and the sum of all vertex degrees is 2NE .

(38)\nIn expanding the expression forH1(x) we exploit the fact that since xvi is binary then x 2 vi = xvi. Also we note that if H1(x) = 0 then the last term in H3(w,x) equals 2NE .\nConsidering the equalities (35-38) for Hamiltonian terms H0(x),H1(x),H2(x) and H3(w,x), we construct QUBO operator as block matrix as follows:\nQ = ( Q11 Q12 Q21 Q22 ) , (39)\nwhere\nQ11 = c0EW , (40) Q12 = \u2212 c2 2 D \u2297 EW , Q21 = QT12, (41) Q22 = c1ENV \u2297 (IW \u2212 2EW ) + c1A\u2297 EW . (42)\nHere EW denotes the identity matrix of size W , IW denotes a matrix with all elements equal to 1 of those of size W , and D = (d1, . . . , dNV ) is a row vector of graph vertex degrees. We also employ the fact that terms of the form\nNV\u2211 u,v=1 W\u2211 i,j=1 cuvhijxuixvj , (43)\nfor some coefficients cuv = cvu and hij = hji can be represented by a quadratic form defined by Kronecker product C\u2297H, where C andH are matrices of cuv and hij correspondingly. One can that matrix Q is constructed so that Q11 submatrix corresponds to the term H0(x) of Hamiltonian (11), Q12 submatrix is for H3(w,x) and Q22 is for H1(x) +H2(x).\nIt is worth to emphasize that it is the structure of encoding problem parameters into the spin vector, given by (34), that allow us to represent submatrices Q12, Q21, and Q22 in the form of Kronecker products. This feature of QUBO submatrices significantly speeds up their assembly using standard mathematical packages, e.g., numpy and scipy."

SimCIM can be used for sampling low-energy spin configurations in the classical Ising model which Hamiltonian can be written as:\nH = \u2211 i hisi + \u2211 <i,j> Jijsisj , (46)\nwhere J represents the spin-spin interaction, h represents the external field, and the si are the individual spins on each of the lattice sites. The Ising Hamiltonian can be directly transformed to a QUBO problem [13] and then quantum annealing can be applied to any optimization problem, which can be expressed into the QUBO form.\nThe SimCIM algorithm treats each spin value as a continuous variable si \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. Each iteration of the algorithm starts with calculating the mean field of the following form:\n\u03a6i = \u2211 j 6=i Jijsj + hi, (47)\nwhich act on each spin by all other spins. Then the gradients for the spin values are calculated as follows:\n\u2206si = ptsi + \u03b6\u03a6i +N(0, \u03c3), (48)\nwhere pt is a dynamic parameter dependent on SimCIM annealing process, overall feedforward factor \u03b6 and N(0, \u03c3) is a random variable sampled from the Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation \u03c3.\nThen the spin values are updated according to si \u2190 \u03c6(si + \u2206si), where \u03c6(x) is the activation function\n\u03c6(x) = { x for |x| \u2264 1; x/|x|, otherwise.\n(49)\nAfter multiple updates, the spins will tend to either \u22121 or +1 and the final discrete spin configuration is obtained by taking the sign of each si.\nIn our implementation we add several improvements to SimCIM algorithm defined in the original paper [35].
