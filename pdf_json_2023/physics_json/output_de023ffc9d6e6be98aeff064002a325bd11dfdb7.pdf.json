In this work, a novel anti-\nbacterial composite nanomaterial based on spiky mesoporous silica\nspheres loaded with poly(ionic liquid)s and aggregation-induced\nemission luminogens (AIEgens) was designed for efficient multidrug-\nresistant (MDR) bacteria treatment and imaging. The nanocomposite\nexhibited excellent and long-term antibacterial activity towards both\nGram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Meanwhile, fluorescent\nAIEgens facilitate real-time bacterial imaging. Our study provides\na multifunctional platform and a promising alternative to antibiotics\nfor combating pathogenic MDR bacteria.\nBacterial infections remain one of the most challenging threats to public health today.1 Although antibiotics have done a great job in preventing the spread of bacteria for several decades, the misuse of antibiotics has made them gradually ineffective.2,3 Furthermore, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria with strong virulence and high lethality has necessitated the development of novel strategies for effective reduction of MDR spread and infections.4,5 A variety of antimicrobial agents have been explored and widely studied, such as antimicrobial peptides,6,7 metallic nanoparticles,8,9 biomacromolecules,10,11 and so on. However, their widespread applications are limited due to adverse effects, such as leakage of metal ions, cytotoxicity, and hemolysis.12\nAmong the emerging antibacterial materials, ionic liquids have attracted increasing attention in recent years.13\u201317 Ionic\nater Bay Area, Key Laboratory for Water\nRiver Delta, Ministry of Education,\nChina.

This, in turn, disturbs the structure of bacterial cell membranes, which accelerates membrane damage and bacteria death.18 Ionic liquids have also shown excellent biocompatibility, which is vital for clinical applications.17,19 They, therefore, are potential candidates to suppress the spread of multidrug resistance among bacteria in clinical settings. With an increasing number of applications of ionic liquids in pharmaceuticals, adverse effects associated with drug resistance cannot be overlooked.20\u201322\nMesoporous silica nanoparticles (NPs) are noteworthy carriers for delivering antimicrobial agents in the antibacterial eld because of their biocompatibility, high loading efficiency, and environment-friendly properties.23\u201325 Moreover, it has been reported that the surface roughness of biomaterials is a crucial feature in inuencing the material\u2013bacteria interactions.26,27 Silica spheres with a rough surface like nanopollens derived from natural mimic principles have demonstrated enhanced adhesive properties towards bacteria.28 Therefore, mesoporous silica nanopollens are promising nanocarriers for delivering and enriching antimicrobials for bacterial treatment to minimize adverse effects.29,30\nMore recently, multifunctional systems integrating monitoring and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria have been used in clinical diagnosis and treatment.31\u201334 Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) agents have also been used in developing new luminescent materials for microbial imaging.35\u201337 AIE agents emit strong uorescence when aggregated by restriction of their rotational molecular structure, thus avoiding the unwanted aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) phenomenon. Therefore, they are ideal luminophores that spontaneously \u201cturn-on\u201d with bacterial concentration when adhered to bacterial surfaces.35,38,39 Such AIE luminogens can be integrated into multifunctional platforms for bacterial imaging.\nA simple and integrated nanocomposite was developed for simultaneous imaging and combating bacteria. Biocompatible AIE agent AFN-I, 3-butyl-1-vinylimidazolium bromide (ILs), and poly(3-butyl-1-vinylimidazolium bromide) (PILs) were used and\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 1631\u20131635 | 1631\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The nanoscale surface roughness of silica spheres would improve their loading and adhesive capabilities, which are benecial for long-term bacterial treatment. AFN-I with an electron-donor and acceptor structural unit has good dispersibility and a weak uorescence background in solution. It presented very weak uorescence on the nanocomposite by retaining its molecular movement. However, the AIE effect could be spontaneously turned on when the nanocomposite was attached and concentrated on the bacterial surface, achieving wash-free imaging of bacteria.\nTo prove our concept, rough mesoporous silica hollow spheres (R-MSHSs) and smooth silica hollow spheres (S-SHSs) were fabricated with a surfactant-free method at room temperature.28 Then, PILs and AFN-I were coloaded onto R-MSHSs and S-SHSs to obtain nanocomposites with a rough (R-P-AFN) and smooth (S-P-AFN) surface separately. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed noticeable morphological differences between R-MSHSs and S-SHSs. R-MSHSs had a spiky surface with an average diameter of 190.5 \u00b1 11.42 nm and a hydrodynamic diameter of 275 \u00b1 2.48 nm (Fig. 1A and Table S2\u2020). The mean particle diameter of S-SHSs was 221 \u00b1 12.21 nm with a hydrodynamic diameter of 229 \u00b1 1.64 nm (Fig. 1B and Table S2\u2020). Aer adsorbing PILs and AFN-I on the nanosphere surface, different degrees of diameter increase were observed. The diameter of R-P-AFN was increased by 51.4 nm to 241.4 \u00b1 21.04 nm, with a hydrodynamic diameter of 285.7 \u00b1 1.42 nm. Similarly, there was also a slight increase in S-P-AFN diameter (231.6 \u00b1 14.4 nm) as well as the hydrodynamic diameter (255.7 \u00b1 2.57 nm) (Fig. S5 and Table S2\u2020). The surface morphologies of R-P-AFN and S-P-AFN were also determined from SEM images (Fig. 1C and D). Additionally, the porosities of R-MSHSs and SSHSs were characterized using nitrogen sorption analysis. The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area and the total pore volume of R-MSHSs are 118.7 m2 g\u22121 and 0.32 cm3 g\u22121, respectively. The corresponding pore size distribution curve\n1632 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 1631\u20131635\nshows that R-MSHSs possess a pore diameter of 9.1 nm (Fig. S6\u2020). Compared with R-MSHSs, S-SHSs have a low surface area of 66.9 m2 g\u22121 with no obvious identied pores.\nAntibacterial experiments using ILs and PILs were performed against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), MDR Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and Methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA). The bactericidal properties of both agents were found to be more effective against the Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and MRSA) than the corresponding Gramnegative bacteria (E. coli and EPEC) (Fig. 2). Moreover, PILs exhibited enhanced antibacterial efficacy by two to three orders of magnitude than ILs against bacteria and the corresponding MIC values were determined (Table S3\u2020). Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer cellmembrane and have a thick peptidoglycan layer that favors the interactions with ionic liquids and become disrupted, leading to the internal cytoplast leakage and cell death.29 Compared with common strains, MDR bacteria showed higher sensitivity to ionic liquids, which may be caused by modication of electrokinetic potential, change of membrane permeability, surface functional proteins, and their steric interactions between ionic liquids and bacterial strains.5,41\u201344\nPILs and AFN-I were further co-adsorbed on the nanospheres. As shown in Fig. 3A, the surface potential of the nanospheres exhibited distinct changes. As expected, due to the loading of positively charged PILs and AFN-I, the zeta potential of R-P-AFN and S\u2013P-AFN was signicantly changed from \u221224.4 mV and \u221233.3 mV to +58.8 mV and +50.8 mV, respectively. The positive surface charge of the nanocomposites is favorable for bacterial adhesion through electrostatic interactions. The loading capacities of the two nanospheres were also compared for the antibacterial agents. As shown in Fig. 3B, RMSHSs exhibited a higher loading capacity for both ILs (2.90 mg g\u22121) and PILs (88.60 mg g\u22121). By contrast, due to the limited external surface, the loading capacity of S-SHSs for ILs and PILs was 1.02 mg g\u22121 and 60.28 mg g\u22121, respectively. These results align well with their morphology difference aer loading, suggesting that the nanospheres with a rough surface have greater loading capability.\nThe antibacterial effects of nanocomposites loaded with ILs and PILs toward bacteria were investigated. Specically, RMSHSs and S-SHSs were loaded with IL and PILs, respectively, resulting in four different types of nanocomposites, including R-MSHSs loaded with ILs (R-ILs) and PILs (R-PILs), and S-SHSs loaded with ILs (S-ILs) and PILs (S-PILs). Bacteria (1 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121) were incubated with the obtained nanocomposites for\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposites was evaluated by the colony formation unit (CFU) inhibition assay.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, aer loading with ILs or PILs, the nanocomposites showed distinctly different antibacterial effects. For the same type of antimicrobial agent, nanocomposites with rough surfaces exhibited higher antibacterial activity than those with smooth surfaces. R-PILs almost completely inhibited (>98%) all the strains. These results are attributed to the improved drug loading capacity and enhanced bacterial adhesion performance of rough silica nanospheres, suggesting the advantage of R-MSHSs as a carrier of antimicrobial agents. In addition, the toxicity of core nanospheres on bacteria growth was assessed by a dose-dependent assay. Both bare silica nanospheres exhibited less than 20% bacterial inhibition at concentrations up to 0.5 mg mL\u22121, which indicates that the core nanospheres have relatively low toxicity to bacteria (Fig. S7\u2020).\nAFN-I, a probe molecule with AIE properties, was adsorbed onto the nanospheres to evaluate wash-free bacterial imaging. The uorescence intensity changes of AFN-I with different bacterial concentrations were determined (Fig. S8\u2020). No uorescence of AFN-I was observed in water due to its excellent solubility. However, with the increased concentration of bacteria, signicant emission enhancement at 560 nm was observed. The positively charged AFN-I interacted with the bacterial surface, leading to the aggregation and enhanced\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nemission of AFN-I. We further stained E. coli with R-P-AFN. The pure R-P-AFN solution had a weak emission under 365 nm irradiation. Aer incubation with bacteria, R-P-AFN efficiently adhered to the bacteria, restricting the intramolecular motion of AFN-I and contributing to distinct uorescence enhancement by about seven fold at 560 nm (Fig. S9 and S10\u2020). As a result, strong orange uorescence under 365 nm irradiation was observed.\nTo demonstrate the interaction between R-P-AFN and bacteria, E. coli was simultaneously stained with SYTO and AFNI/R-P-AFN and then imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). SYTO stains the bacteria in green color, while the false red emission from the bacteria presents the uorescence of AFN-I (Fig. 5A\u2013F). As shown in Fig. 5E, the bacteria were observed to form aggregates with an irregular morphology aer the treatment of R-P-AFN. More insights into the nanocomposite\u2013bacteria interactions were obtained from SEM characterization. The rod-like E. coli surfaces aer treatment with R-P-AFN had a roughened and aked appearance compared to the intact smooth cells (Fig. 5G and H). The nanocomposites were observed to adhere to the cell surface and the distortion of cellular morphology was clearly visible due to the PIL effects. Overall, the above results demonstrated the antibacterial potential of R-P-AFN towards bacteria and its simultaneous wash-free imaging capability.\nIn conclusion, we have successfully developed a multifunctional nanocomposite R-P-AFN for bacterial treatment and wash-free bacterial imaging. This novel nanocomposite is facilely prepared. In the presence of AFN-I, R-P-AFN is equipped with AIE properties. The mesoporous silica hollow nanospheres with a rough surface can serve as the carriers for PILs and enable bacterial long-term anchoring due to their spiky\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 1631\u20131635 | 1633\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Benetting from the enhanced membrane interactions with PILs, R-P-AFN has an excellent antibacterial ability to combat Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. More importantly, R-P-AFN can kill MDR bacteria that pose signicant challenges in healthcare. Our study provides a novel strategy for real-time imaging and the prevention of MDR bacterial infection."
