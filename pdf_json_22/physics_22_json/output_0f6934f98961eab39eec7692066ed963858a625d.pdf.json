As an application we generate Kremer-Grest melts of 1000 chains with 200 entanglements and 25000-2000 beads per chain, which cover the experimentally relevant bending rigidities up to and beyond the limit of the isotropicnematic transition.

Finally we can switch to the full Kremer-Grest model without perturbing the structure. The resulting chain statistics is in excellent agreement with literature results on all length scales accessible in brute-force simulations of shorter chains.\nPolymeric systems exhibit a wide range of characteristic time and length scales. In the case of natural rubber or cisPI1, important static scales comprise (i) the Kuhn length, lK \u2248 1nm, characterizing the crossover to the large-scale random-walk behavior, (ii) the tube diameter, dT \u2248 5nm with NeK = 24 Kuhn segments between entanglements, for the onset of entanglement effects, (iii) the coil diameter, \u3008R2\u3009 = lKL \u2248 100nm, and (iv) the contour length, L \u2248 10\u00b5m for chains with a typical length of NK = 104 Kuhn segments with Z = NK/NeK = 390 entanglements per chain. The spread is even larger between the characteristic time scales (here estimated at T = 298K). There are already almost three orders of magnitude between the Kuhn time, \u03c4K \u223c 1\u00d7 10\u22127s, and the entanglement time, \u03c4e \u223c 7\u00d7 10\u22125s when monomers diffuse over distances comparable to lK and dT respectively. The Rouse time of \u03c4R = N2K\u03c4K \u223c 108\u03c4K \u223c 10s governs fast processes such as the tension equilibration inside the tube2, while the estimated maximal relaxation time is \u03c4max = 3\u03c4eZ3 \u223c 3h.\nDifferent aspects of polymeric behavior can be studied with models representing different levels of coarse-graining.3\u20135 For microscopic models, it remains a challenge to prepare wellequilibrated initial states in the long chain limit, since standard simulation methods following the physical dynamics are not able to bridge the gap between the time step and the longest relaxation in the system. Alternative approaches fall into two classes. Variants of the double-bridging algorithm6\u201310 introduce connectivity-altering moves allowing pivot-like11 moves in dense systems for the equilibration of the large-scale chain structure. Schemes building on the Flory ideality hypothesis12 superpose pre-equilibrated chain configurations with the proper large-scale random walk statistics in the simulation box and gradually remove the local overlap between monomers9,13\u201316. This approach can be generalized to a systematic multi-scale approach, which equilibrates density fluctuations and chain conformations from the largest scales down to the monomer16\u201318 or even atomic scale19.\nHere we follow the latter route in building on our previous work16, where we have already used a simple multi-chain lattice model to equilibrate the chain and melt structure beyond the tube scale. The novelty of the present work lies firstly in our use of the constrained mode tube model formalism20\u201323 for the fine-graining step from the lattice to the bead scale, which allows us to minimize lattice artifacts and to extend the method to polymers with higher intrinsic stiffness. Secondly, we have parameterized the intrinsic bending stiffness for an entire family of force-capped bead-spring models such that they can be employed for an iso-configurational introduction of excluded volume interactions. As a result, we are now able to prepare long-chain KG melts for bending rigidities, which cover the entire range from intrinsically flexible chains corresponding to commodity polymers1 up to and beyond the limit10,24 of the isotropic-nematic transition.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section I we provide a more detailed introduction into the problem, review the state of the art and sketch the content of the present work. Section II provides detailed background information on the employed models, methods and the notation. Section III deals with fine-graining from the tube to the Kuhn scale, Section IV with the iso-configurational push-off procedure. In the Results Section V we (i) analyze the conformational properties of the generated KG melts, (ii) compare them to target values and (iii) test if they are stable during subsequent simulations with the full force-field. We finish with a brief conclusion in Section VII.\nI. INTRODUCTION AND STATE OF THE ART"

Such properties are universal2,57 in the sense that a large number of chemically different systems exhibit identical behavior, if measurements are reported in suitable units such as those related to the Kuhn scale.1 Universal properties can be studied with generic polymer models like the Kremer-Grest (KG) bead-spring polymer model58.

            "text": "Consider the application of bead-spring models to investigate the dynamics of polymer melts, e.g. Refs.61\u201363, of the effect of cross-linking on the structure-property relations of rubber-like materials, e.g. Refs.64\u201368, the viscoelastic response to strain, e.g. Refs.69\u201373, or the glass transition e.g. Refs.74,75. Clearly their success depends on the ready availability of properly equilibrated melt configurations characterized by 1) local chain conformations in agreement with those measured in shorter chain melts amenable to brute-force equilibration 2) large-scale chain conformations matching the expected and/or extrapolated random walk statistics, 3) the expected and/or extrapolated density of topological entanglements, and 4) the near absence of density fluctuations typical for nearly incompressible bulk polymers. These requirements couple the melt structure at micro-, meso- and macroscopic scales, making it highly non-trivial to generate well equilibrated melts.\nAs already pointed out in the Introduction, brute force equilibration using a physically realistic dynamics is only computationally feasible for melts of short chains, since polymer dynamics is slow in general and entanglements cause the conformational relaxation time to increase even more drastically. Double bridging Monte Carlo moves6\u20138 offer an attractive alternative. They introduce large-scale conformational changes into MC or hybrid MC/MD simulations76 by swapping the tails of a pair of chains at a common contact point. For atomistic and (stiffer) bead-spring models, double-bridging moves require a certain amount of softening of the local interactions to have a finite success rate 6,10,77. Some care needs to be taken to ensure that such a modification do not alter the chain\nstatistics. Unfortunately, the computational efficiency of the approach decreases with chain length, since the density of suitable contact points drops as the move alters in general the lengths of the involved chains.\nFor (by present standards) modest system sizes, it is actually quite feasible to generate viable melt conformations from the random superposition of pre-equilibrated chain configurations in the simulation box13. As the random overlap of Lennard-Jones type beads leads to numerical instabilities, this requires a push-off process where the liquid-like bead packing is gradually introduced in simulations with non-diverging pair interactions. With the bead motion during the push-off limited to the monomer scale, the large scale chain statistics remains unaffected. Unfortunately, for longer chains the push-off leads to swelling of the chain conformations at intermediate scales. Auhl et al.9 addressed this problem by 1) reducing the initial density fluctuations by pre-packing the chains, 2) using force-capped pair interactions to ensure realistic local bead packing during the push-off, and 3) retaining the full interaction between bonded neighbors to produce the correct local bond statistics. This approach was used to equilibrate melts comprising 80 chains of lengths up to 7000 beads. Moreira et al.15 improved this method by using a freely-rotating chain model to reproduce the desired chain statistics combined with a push-off process using a feedback control loop and were able to generate melts with 1000 chains of 2000 beads."

            "text": "The wide range of relevant time and length scales in polymeric systems makes them natural targets for multi-scale modelling.3\u20135 In particle-based models, the resolution ranges from the atom scale to DPD-like descriptions, where entire chains are represented by one or two soft spheres or ellipsoids78,79. While systematic coarse-graining is an important aspect of the multi-scale view of polymeric systems, the framework also lends itself to fine-graining, i.e. the insertion of additional molecular details into a more coarse-grain model3\u20135,14.\nIn the present context, pre-packing and push-off schemes can be generalized to a systematic multi-scale approach, which equilibrates density fluctuations and chain conformations from the largest scales down. Zhang et al.17\u201319 represented the chains in a polymer melt via a hierarchy of soft blob models with matching invariant degrees of polymerization. Each blob model can then be fine-grained to an equivalent lower resolution model until a scale comparable to KG models is reached. The melts generated with this approach were comparable to those of Moreira et al.15\nD. Improvements introduced in the present work\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of 5 randomly chosen chains (in melts composed of 1000 chains, each with 200 entanglements) in the course of the present multi-scale equilibration\n3 procedure. Columns illustrate the different stages of the algorithm, while the target stiffness of the KG chains increases from the top to the bottom row.\nIn our previous equilibration protocol16, we used a computationally efficient lattice model80 to equilibrate the large scale structure of the polymer melt. The lattice constant was chosen to match the Kuhn length of the PPA81-inferred primitive paths, and multiple entanglement segments could occupy the same node in the lattice. We retain this lattice simulation, see leftmost column in Fig. 1. In a second step, we performed a lengthy push-off simulation starting from the lattice melt state using force-capped interactions (fourth column in Fig. 1). The purpose of this second step was to introduce thermal fluctuations below the lattice scale while ensuring a homogeneous spatial density of beads.\nThe present work introduces two major improvements, which smoothen the transitions between the lattice and bead scales: Firstly, we use theoretical insight from a class of \u201ctube\u201d or random localization models20\u201323 to switch from the lattice model to a chain representation on the Kuhn or bead scale. Constrained mode models represent chain conformations as the sum of a quenched mean conformation and annealed thermal fluctuation. In the original context, the mean conformation can be tentatively identified with the primitive paths, while the amplitude of the fluctuations defines the \"tube\" or \"sausage\" diameter. When applied in a static sense, the formalism can be used to coarse-grain chains to an arbitrary length scale. In the present context, we use it (i) to reduce lattice artifacts in the primitive chain conformations (column 2 in Fig. 1)) and (ii) to introduce the bead degrees of freedom together with random walk conformational statistics all the way down to the Kuhn scale of the chains (column 3 in Fig. 1)). The resulting initial bead-spring \u201cmelt\u201d conformations match the expected chain statistics already at the Kuhn scale and not, as in our original algorithm16, only at the tube scale. The operation does not affect the large-scale spatial density distribution, which remains homogeneous above the tube scale.\nSecondly, we have carefully parameterized the intrinsic bending stiffness for a family of force-capped KG models such that we can tune models with different levels of forcecapping to generate chains with the same target Kuhn length. This iso-configurational push-off effectively avoids introducing distortions of the chain statistics during push-off, when we build up the local chain structure and the liquid-like bead packing. The result is equilibrated starting states for Molecular Dynamics simulations with the full KG potential (column 4 in Fig. 1)).\nFor comparison, the rightmost column in Fig. 1 shows the outcome of the primitive path analysis81, which we performed on the final configuration. The figure will be discussed in more detail at the end of the paper."

The PPA algorithm proceeds as follows: 1) the ends of all chains are pinned in space, 2) local intra molecular pair interactions are disabled, and 3) the energy is minimized. Minimization pulls the chains taught to minimize the bond energy thus producing a unique primitive-path\nmesh. Since we retain inter molecular pair interactions different chains are unable to pass through each other, thus preserving entanglements. In the original PPA algorithm all intra molecular interactions were disabled, however, this removes self-entanglements between segments far removed along a chain. It also removed entanglements of a chain with images of itself due to periodic boundary conditions. Hence we only disable intra molecular interactions up chemical distances of 20 bonds along the chain. This allows the chain to shrink to its PPA contour length, while preserving distant self-entanglements. Other PPA algorithms have also been proposed see e.g.98,99. These algorithms have been shown to measure a topological entanglement length which differs from the rheological entanglement length by about a factor of two.95\nTo obtain the entanglement length in Kuhn units NeK from the PPA analysis, we note the contour length of the chains before PPA is L = lKNK = lKZNeK , while after PPA the contour length has shrunk to Lpp = leZ where le denotes the average spatial distance between entanglements.

The WLC expression reduce to the random walk limit l2e = l 2 KNeK for NeK 1 corresponding to loosely entangled flexible chains, while in the limit NeK 1 it converges to the Semenov expression for tightly entangled chains.96 Hence the relation between the number of Kuhn segments between entanglements and the PPA observable Lpp is given by\n( Lpp L )2 = 2NeK + exp(\u22122NeK)\u22121 2N2eK .

(42), the filtered ensemble of off-lattice primitive chain conformations is obvi-\n11\nously in perfect agreement with the target statistics with only minor deviations being visible for p > 100 where fluctuations dominate the spectrum (top panel in Fig. 3). However, visual inspection of the primitive chain conformations (top left panel in Fig. 4) shows that the original lattice is still clearly visible.\nChoosing a larger scale (i.e. using weaker localization springs `K ( lK(\u03ba),\u03bbapp(\u03ba) ) with \u03bb > 1) removes lattice artifacts more thoroughly (Fig. 4), while preserving perfect agreement of the mode spectrum with the redefined target statistics (bottom panel in Fig. 3). However this obviously comes at the expense of reintroducing density fluctuations on scales, on which they had already been suppressed in the lattice model. Here we have opted to proceed with a smoothing factor of \u03bb = 2 to minimize the effect of lattice artifacts.\nWe also note in passing that our choices of app as the lattice parameter and a decoration NK = ZNeK are inconsistent for stiff chains. This can be shown by calculating the mean-square distance \u3008R2\u3009 = a2ppZ = l2KNK/ [ 1\u2212 12NeK ( 1\u2212 e\u22122NeK )] . In the limit of loosely entangled chains NeK 1 the denominator is one and hence the Kuhn conformations match the target chain statistics. However in the limit of tightly entangled chains NeK 1, the denominator is \u223c NeK and hence the decorated conformations are effectively stretched. We could fix this by choosing l2KNeK as lattice spacing, however, we retained the choice since rescaling by Eq. (43) effectively compresses the stiff chain conformations to match the target statistics.\nAs a final validation, Fig. 5 compares the mean-square internal distances for the rescaled primitive chain conformations to the theoretical expectation, Eq. 38. The agreement is observed to be excellent. In future work, it might be worthwhile to explore if we have erred on the side of caution in the sense that the removal of the lattice artifacts could be trusted to the subsequent push-off phase of the algorithm, and furthermore to explore the optimal design of the lattice model and -parameter for removal of density fluctuations at shorter scales than the tube scale.\nD. Introducing fluctuations at the Kuhn scale\nTo obtain chain conformations with proper fluctuations all the way down to the Kuhn scale we add fluctuations \u03b4up\u03b1 to the primitive chain Rouse modes,\nuoffp\u03b1 =U off p\u03b1 +\u03b4up\u03b1 , (45)\nwhere the fluctuation amplitudes \u03b4up\u03b1 are chosen from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance given by Eq. (29). Note that the chosen strength of the localization springs, `, has to be consistent between rescaling, Eq. (43), and the addition of noise, Eq. (45).\nThe center-of-mass mode (p = 0) is treated separately: uoff0\u03b1 =U on o\u03b1 +\u03be\u03b1 , where \u03be\u03b1 is an uniform random number from [\u2212app/2,app/2] to corresponding to a random shift of the lattice cell.\nFig. 3 shows the reduced spectra of the fluctuations around the primitive chain, kpkBT \u3008\u03b4u 2 p\u03b1\u3009, for the above example. They\nare negligible at small mode numbers / large scales (p < 35 for \u03ba = 0), where the chain fluctuations are dominated by the primitive chain component. At large mode numbers / small scales the additional fluctuations provide the required complement to reach Gaussian statistics on all scales down to the Kuhn scale.\nFinally the chain Rouse modes from Eq. (45) are converted back to real space conformation\nroffi\u03b1 = Qipu off p\u03b1 .\nThe resulting Kuhn scale conformations match the primitive chain conformations from the lattice model at scales above the tube scale, while having random walk statistics all the way down to Kuhn scales. They are thus much closer to the target statistics than the bead-decorated lattice chains from which we used to initiate the push-off in our previous equilibration protocol (Fig. 10 in Ref.16)."

The chain statistics at large scales remains unaffected and locally the chains can equilibrate to the target statistics. However, a small amount of chain swelling develops at intermediate scales9.\nWe chose to reequilibrate the chain and melt structure at U0 = 5\u03b5 , because (i) local density fluctuations are sufficiently suppressed, (ii) the intrinsic bead friction is low in the absence of caging within a well-established first neighbor shell, and (iii) the chains can still freely pass through each other ex-\nhibiting Rouse dynamics16. The equilibration simulations were run at friction \u0393 = 0.5mb\u03c4\u22121. To monitor the progress of the evolution of target properties during push-off we prefer a parametric representation of time in terms of monomer mean-square displacements, g1(t) = \u3008(ri(t)\u2212 ri(0))2\u3009, relative to the wavelength of the remaining density inhomogeneities on the tube scale, a2pp. As shown in Fig. 9 the perturbations at intermediate scales equilibrate, when monomers diffuse over the entanglement scale. In particular, this local reequilibration is sufficient to reestablish the target statistics on all length scales.\nAs the entanglement length is another sensitive measure of the equilibration of polymer melts105, we show in Fig. 10 the evolution of NeK during push-off. To perform PPA in these systems we first have to quench the topological structure by introducing the full KG force field via a quick push-off. Compared to the corresponding Fig. 11 for our previous equilibration protocol16, the inferred entanglement lengths now remain nearly constant throughout the push-off. We take this as further evidence for the utility of our improved fine-graining from the tube to the Kuhn scale. On closer inspection, the entanglement length nevertheless grows by approximately 30% for standard KG melts with \u03ba = 0, while we observe essentially no evolution during push-off for the stiff chain melts with \u03ba \u2265 2. This observation is in good qualitative agreement with the larger disturbances of the chain statistics at intermediate scales reported for flexible chains in Fig. 9 and the observations in Ref.105. For all melts, we observe again that the equilibrium entanglement length appears to be established, when monomers have diffused over the entanglement scale.\nWe conclude that push-off simulations reaching g1(t) = a2pp are sufficient to establish equilibrium chain statistics and entanglement length, when the systems were previously equilibrated down to the entanglement scale using the lattice model. In terms of MD steps, this corresponds to relatively modest simulations of 2.4,1.1,0.16,0.24,0.72\u00d7 106 MD steps, respectively, for \u03ba =\u22122,0,2,4,6. The non-monotonous behavior is surprising, since app depends only weakly on the chain stiffness. We attribute this to the effective friction that depends on the bead interactions and local melt structure. These data suggests that the friction is minimal around \u03ba \u223c 2 for the force capped model, while previously it was observed that dynamics for the full KG model accelerates with increasing chain stiffness.60,63 At large stiffnesses a transition from isotropic to nematic order is expected, and this might explain why the friction increases for the stiffest melts."

III), and 3) the execution of a series of Molecular Dynamics simulations for bead-spring chains with force-capped WCA interactions and carefully parameterized intrinsic bending rigidities to slowly introduce the liquid-like bead packing characteristic of Kremer-Grest melts (Sec. IV).\nIn Fig. 1 we document the evolution of the conformation of randomly chosen chains during this procedure. Each row of the figure corresponds to a different value of the bending parameter \u03ba . The chosen values cover the entire range from experimentally relevant bending rigidities1 up to and beyond the limit of the isotropic-nematic transition59. We generated melts of approximately Mtarget = 1000 chains with effective chain lengths of Ztarget = 200 entanglements. Since the number of beads per entanglement segment varying from 149 for the most flexible melts (\u03ba = \u22122) down to 10 for the stiffest melts (\u03ba = 6), this correspond to Nb = 25000-2000 beads per chain and to total system sizes of 24.4M down to 1.4M beads. The precise characteristics of the generated melts are listed in Table I, the choices for the number of chains in the systems and the exact number of beads per chain follow from the considerations in Sec. II G.\nThe left-most column of Fig. 1 shows the lattice melts conformations where each chain is shifted by a random cell vec-\ntor. We observe interpenetrating random walk chains as expected for a melt. The density of beads is kept constant, which effectively results in lattices with a smaller number of nodes for increasing chain stiffness. The second column shows the mean conformations produced after mode rescaling of the lattice conformations. Artifacts due to the lattice structure are completely removed. The third column shows bead-spring chains after adding thermal fluctuations all the way down to the Kuhn scale. The fluctuations strongly contribute to the conformations for the flexible melts (top), while for the stiff melts the Kuhn scale chain conformations are similar to the mean conformations. The fourth column shows the KG melt conformations after the push-off, which only affects the local packing.\nIn the following, we compare measures of the chain statistics in the generated melts to target values from the literature, check their invariance during longer simulations with the full KG force field."

Short of inspecting the complete internal distance distribution functions, we have analyzed the Binder Cumulant107 as a measure of their deviation from Gaussian statistics. The sampled Binder Cumulant for internal distances (BCID) is defined as\nBCID(n) = 1\u2212 \u3008R 4 \u03b1(n)\u3009\n3\u3008R2\u03b1(n)\u30092\nwhere the averages are over all three Cartesian components R\u03b1 of the internal distances between beads for fixed chemical distance.

We note that while virtually all theories are based on Gaussian chain models2, real polymers are made up of monomers with a finite size and with a local liquid-like packing. In this sense, the KG model is a more realistic representation of real chemical polymers than most theoretical models.1,108 Finally a point to note for our present purposes is that Figure 13 shows no difference between results at the beginning and the end of the equilibrium runs with the full KG potential.\n17"

In the present case, this is the isoconfigurational pushoff which we terminate once beads have moved over a spatial distance g1(t) = a2pp of the order of the resolution of the lattice model.\nThis observation has several implications: Most importantly and in marked contrast to the physical dynamics or double-bridging6\u20138, the necessary computer time for multiscale equilibration of long chain melts becomes independent of chain length.

While this procedure preserves the conformational statistics and the chain packing at large scales, the resulting bond lengths are extremely compressed when compared to the target system. As a consequence, the initial relaxation of these states by energy minimisation was prone to perturb the chain structure on intermediate scales.\nHere we have shown how to generate lattice-derived Gaussian chain conformations, which are discretized at the Kuhn scale. This has the advantage that the resulting bead-spring conformations exhibit the proper average chain contour length in addition to preserving the large scale structure. We have achieved this by switching to mode space and adapting the constrained mode formalism for rubber-elastic systems22,23 to the present problem. In particular, we identify the quenched (mean) configurations with the primitive chain lattice conformations. This allows us to (i) filter out lattice artifacts and (ii) add contour length and bending fluctuations down to the Kuhn scale. Our results show that the resulting conformations can be used without further precautions as starting states for our push-off procedure for KG melts. We believe that the procedure would be equally useful for the transition to other mildly coarse-grain or even atomistic models.\nD. Isoconfigurational force-capped KG models\nAs a methodological improvement geared exclusively towards applications of the (stiffness modulated [Faller]) KG model1, we have improved and extended the range of our parameterization16 of \u201cisoconfigurational\u201d force-capped KG models with suitably renormalized bending stiffnesses, Eqs. (47), (49) and (50). In particular, we now cover the entire range of Kuhn numbers nK = \u03c1K l3K \u2208 [2,100] for isotropic polymer melts ranging from experimentally relevant bending rigidities up to and beyond the limit of the isotropic- nematic transition.\nEmploying the present family of force-capped KG models in brute-force equilibration runs is always computationally more efficient than the use of the full KG model (Fig. 6 in Ref.16), since the computational effort for the final switch to the full KG potential is negligible. For chains below the entanglement length the speed-up of the order of two due to the smaller effective bead friction may be of little relevance, but for longer chains the possibility of chain crossing assures that the maximal relaxation time increases only like N2 as in the\nRouse model as opposed to N3+x for entangled KG chains. Moreover, LAMMPS allows to accelerate the equilibration via double-bridging moves so that the present families of potentials can be used along the lines of the recent work of Dietz and Hoy10. LAMMPS scripts for performing the present push-off simulations will be made available on our website (http://polymer.zqex.dk/), but a systematic analysis of the effectiveness of the double-bridging algorithm as a function of chain length and at different levels of force-capping is beyond the scope of the present work."

This raises the question, down to which scales one should use these descriptions in multiscale equilibration schemes. A full investigation is beyond the scope of the present work, but some insight can be gained by analyzing the issue on a scaling level.\nGiven that our models and methods are fully compatible with those from Refs.17,18, we stick to a lattice notation. Be a the lattice constant and \u3008R2\u3009 = a2Na the mean-square endto-end distance of a Na-step lattice chain representing a target polymer. From the number density of lattice chain segments, \u03c1a = \u03c1chNa, follows the dimensionless number of chain segments per lattice site, na = \u03c1aa3 = \u03c1ch\u3008R2\u30093/2/N 1/2 a = (Np/Na) 1/2. In terms of available physical length scales, one can plausibly associate the lattice constant a with (a multiple of) the Kuhn length94,106, the packing length17,18, and the entanglement length16. We have not done so here, but we note that one can easily extend the idea of multiscale equilibration to chains of arbitrary length by defining a hierarchy of more and more coarse-grain models indexed n = 0,1,2, ... for any such choice of a with lattice constants a(n) = 2na, segment numbers N(n)a = 2\u22122nNa and reduced densities n (n) a = 2nna.\nFirst consider a lattice (or blob) scale equal to a multiple of the Kuhn scale, a = \u03b1K lK . In this case, the average number of segments occupying a lattice site is proportional to the\n19\nKuhn number, na = \u03b1KnK , i.e. a priori we have to study a different (hierarchy of) lattice models for each target material. In contrast, choosing the lattice (or blob) scale equal to a fixed multiple of the packing length, a = \u03b1p p, the average number of segments occupying a lattice site na = \u03b1pnp = \u03b1p, i.e. all target materials can be studied using a universal (hierarchy of) coarse-grain models.17,18 For intrinsically flexible commodity polymers with nK \u2208 [2,10]1,93 our choice of equating the lattice scale with the entanglement length corresponds to \u03b1p = \u03b1 and \u03b1K = \u03b1/nK with \u03b1 = 18 from the packing argument, Eqs.(12) and (13) and effectively coincides with the choice of Refs.17,18.\nChoosing smaller values of \u03b1K or \u03b1p is promising, as one might hope to terminate the subsequent, computationally expensive push-off runs once beads have moved over the correspondingly reduced lattice scale, g1(t) = a2. For more dilute target systems, Refs.94,106 worked with a lattice scale a = lK equal to the Kuhn scale, which offers the added benefit that the lattice chains have the same (average) contour length as the target chains and can be conveniently decorated with the beads of the off-lattice model. In the present work we have nevertheless retained our original choice16,80 to define the lattice model on the entanglement scale. The original reason for this choice was that excluded volume interactions are no longer fully screened,113\u2013117 when the number na of overlapping chain segments per lattice site approaches unity. The coarse-grain models loose much of their elegance and simplicity, if additional work is required to preserve the target relation \u3008R2\u3009= a2Na or if one has to perform a parameterization of the relation between the asymptotic Kuhn length and the model parameters along the lines of Ref.1. This seems inevitable on the packing scale, where a = p and na = np = 1, and might still be an issue on the Kuhn scale, where for commodity polymers na = nK falls into the range of nK \u2208 [2,10]1.\nThe second reason to continue to work on the entanglement scale was that we think it interesting10,96 to study isotropic polymer melts over the full range of intrinsic stiffnesses up to and beyond the onset of the isotropic- nematic transition around nK \u2248 100. For the present purposes it would probably be possible to employ a universal large scale model with a fixed resolution of a = \u03b1 p along the lines of Refs.17,18. However, one would need to test, if the push-off protocol can deal with the unphysical chain contour lengths and the random walk statistics of the lattice chains below the target Kuhn scale. Alternatively, one could remove these artifacts using the methods from Sec. III at the price of reintroducing density fluctuations on scales up to the Kuhn scale. Our choice to identify the lattice scale with the Kuhn length of the primitive paths, a = app, allowed as to avoid these complications, because it assures96 that the lattice constant reduces to the Kuhn length lK of the chains in an uncritical limit, where nK 1."

            "text": "We have presented an effective, computationally efficient multi-scale equilibration process for long chain polymer melts resolved at the Kuhn scale using the Kremer-Grest model1,58.\nOur method proceeds from large to small scales and uses three distinct polymer models to represent the chains. We start out by equilibrating our melts above the tube scale using a computationally very efficient Monte-Carlo lattice model. Each step of the primitive lattice chains corresponds to an entanglement segment and multiple segments are allowed to occupy the same lattice site. We use simulated annealing Monte Carlo to progressively penalize density fluctuations without introducing deviations from the target random walk chain statistics. To fine-grain the primitive chain lattice conformations to the Kuhn scale we switch to (Rouse) mode space. In the context of tube models for rubber elastic systems long wavelength modes beyond the entanglement scale are quenched while short wavelength modes are free to fluctuate. Here we identify the quenched (mean) configurations with the primitive chain lattice conformations and use a constrained mode formalism22,23 to (i) filter out lattice artifacts and (ii) add contour length and bending fluctuations down to the Kuhn scale. Finally, we switch to a bead-spring representation and implement a push-off process using a sequence of force-capped KG models to arrive at viable starting conformations for simulations with the full Kremer-Grest polymer model58. To avoid the introduction of artifacts in this stage, we have carefully parameterized the bending stiffness to be employed for each level of force-capping so as to always reproduce the Kuhn length of the target KG model.\nWe have used this method to generate sample melt configurations for chain stiffnesses \u03ba = \u22122 up to 6 ranging from values corresponding to the most flexible experimental systems1 to the onset of the nematic-isotropic transition. With the transition located around \u03ba \u2248 5.510 the conformations we generated for the largest \u03ba values should probably be regarded as metastable isotropic melt states and not true equilibrium melt states. All melts are composed of M \u2248 1000 chains of an effective chain length of Z \u2248 200 entanglements per chain. The number of beads per chain varies between N = 25000 and N = 2000 for the highest stiffness. The resulting melt structures show excellent agreement with literature values for shorter chains with respect to the chain mean-square internal distances and PPA-derived entanglement lengths. These statistical properties remain virtually constant over the entanglement time, when the systems are subsequently propagated with the full KG force field. We take these observations as evidence that the generated melt conformations can be plausibly regarded as equilibrium states.\nIn future work, it would be interesting to explore, if we one can preserve the simple form of the lattice model for resolutions approaching the Kuhn scale and to further reduce the CPU time for the isoconfigurational push-off. Furthermore, it is straightforward to generalize both the lattice and constrained mode models to (mixtures of) chains of arbitrary connectivities. We expect the present approach to be applicable with minor modifications in all cases where the systems reach thermal equilibrium and where topological constraints do not affect static properties. This may be particularly fruitful in the case of entangled star and branched polymers, where the physical relaxation times become exponentially longer than for linear chains.2,112 As a counterexample, we note that the\n20\nmultiscale generation of melts of non-concatenated ring polymer melts or solutions requires special methods94,106.\nTo end on a note of caution, no number of successful validations of a multiscale equilibration procedure precludes the discovery of deviations in the analysis of additional, more refined observables (for a recent example see Refs.94,106 on generating ring melts). In the case of long-chain homopolymer melts suitable candidates for further comparisons might be the analysis of intra-chain knots109 and of long-range correlations in the bond orientational correlation function113\u2013117. Given that brute-force MD equilibration for the present chain lengths requires of the order of 106 more CPU time, we may have to accept this uncertainty for the foreseeable future and resign ourselves to revising the equilibration procedure whenever shortcomings are identified."

In contrast, in our parameterisation of the KG model for commodity polymer melts1 we have set the energy scale of all interactions to the thermal energy for the experimental target system, \u03b5 = kBTexp, and thus rendered the model athermal. This has the advantage that the predicted chain structures become independent of temperature in agreement with experimental observations. For more details, we refer the reader to Ref.1. 86N.
