1. **Investigate the effect of different anions on the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs.** The current study only looked at the effect of the cation on CO2 absorption. Future research could investigate how different anions, such as formate, acetate, and propionate, affect the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs. This information could be used to design APILs with even higher CO2 absorption capacities.


2. **Study the recyclability of APILs over multiple cycles.** The current study only looked at the recyclability of APILs over a single cycle. Future research could investigate how the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs changes over multiple cycles. This information is important for understanding the long-term viability of APILs for CO2 capture applications.


3. **Explore the use of APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas.** The current study only looked at the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs in pure CO2. Future research could investigate the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs in flue gas, which is a more realistic scenario for CO2 capture applications. This information is important for understanding the potential of APILs for use in industrial settings.


4. **Investigate the use of APILs for CO2 capture from natural gas.** Natural gas is a major source of energy, but it also contains CO2. Future research could investigate the use of APILs to capture CO2 from natural gas. This could help to reduce the environmental impact of natural gas production and use.


5. **Develop new APILs with even higher CO2 absorption capacities.** The current study identified several APILs with promising CO2 absorption capacities. Future research could build on this work to develop new APILs with even higher CO2 absorption capacities. This could lead to the development of new CO2 capture technologies that are more efficient and cost-effective.
