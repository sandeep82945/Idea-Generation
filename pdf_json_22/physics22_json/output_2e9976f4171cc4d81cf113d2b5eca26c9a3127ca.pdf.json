            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "The aim of this paper is to study the construction of the wave functions of the Hydrogen atom in the momentum representation, a topic which has been considered in [1]- [7], among others. To understand why this is a non-trivial exercise in basic quantum mechanics, we need to recall some physical and mathematical ideas that will be important in the following sections. However, as we are mainly focused on physical applications, we only sketch the mathematical details.\nIn the canonical quantization procedure pioneered by Dirac, one starts with a\nclassical Hamiltonian system which, for simplicity, we will assume to be n\u2212dimensional and having a phase space equal to R2n (that is, we avoid constraints). More generally, we could think of a 2n\u2212dimensional cotangent manifold T \u2217M , where M is a configuration space. In any case, the phase space is endowed with a canonical symplectic form w which allows the definition of things such as Hamiltonian vector fields Xf associated to classical observables f \u2208 C\u221e(T \u2217M) (that vector field is uniquely defined by the condition w(Xf , \u00b7) = \u2212df , where d is the exterior differential), and\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n13 98\n9v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\nthe Poisson bracket of two classical observables f, g \u2208 C\u221e(T \u2217M) (defined as {f, g} = w(Xf , Xg)). Those systems admit a privileged system of so-called Darboux coordinates (q,p) = (q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , qn, p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pn), in which the symplectic form becomes w = dqi \u2227 dpi, equivalently, the Poisson brackets between the coordinates (considered as functions on the phase space) are the canonical ones: {qj, pk} = \u03b4jk. Quantization is achieved by replacing the classical observables f \u2208 C\u221e(T \u2217M) by self-adjoint operators f\u0302 defined on some dense subspace of the Hilbert space of squareintegrable functions L2(M, d\u00b5), with respect to some measure d\u00b5 (to be constructed in the process), and the Poisson bracket by i~ times the commutator between operators, [f\u0302 , g\u0302] = f\u0302 \u25e6 g\u0302\u2212 g\u0302\u25e6 f\u0302 . Thus, the Poisson bracket of the Darboux coordinates now becomes the well-known Heisenberg canonical commutation relation\n[q\u0302j, p\u0302k] = i~\u03b4jkI , (1)\nwhere I stands for the identity operator. Notice that this relation has to be valid only in the common domain where it makes sense, and this could be the empty set [8].\nNow, one can pose the question of what operators could be those q\u0302j, p\u0302k. Any\ntextbook on quantum mechanics presents an heuristic argument leading to the consideration of the multiplication operator\nq\u0302j\u03c8(q) = qj\u03c8(q) , (2)\nand the differentiation operator\np\u0302k\u03c8(q) = \u2212i~ \u2202\u03c8(q)\n\u2202qk . (3)\nThat correspondence works well when the classical configurations space is M = Rn, so the Darboux coordinates are the Cartesian ones on T \u2217M = R2n, and the corresponding Hilbert space is L2(Rn, dnx), the space of square-integrable functions with respect to the Euclidean measure. In that case, both q\u0302j and p\u0302k are well-defined operators on the domain consisting, for instance, of Schwartz-class functions S(Rn), and admit unique self-adjoint extensions (with which they are identified, respectively). The uniqueness of the representation (2) and (3) is then guaranteed by the Stone-Von Neumann theorem: any other pair of operators satisfying (1), are unitarily equivalent to (2), (3).\nHowever, it is important to understand that things are drastically different if the\nconfiguration space is not all of Rn, or even if this is the case but we choose coordinates different from the canonical Darboux (Cartesian) ones [9]. This remark will be crucial later on.\nA fundamental result in the theory of Hilbert spaces is the spectral theorem for\nself-adjoint operators, which basically states that given one of these, we can find a unitary equivalence in the Hilbert space such that the transformed operator acts as a multiplication operator, that is, the transformed operator is \u201cdiagonal\u201d. Each choice of an operator and the associated equivalence that diagonalizes it, is called a\nrepresentation of the system. In the light of this result, we can say that the canonical Dirac correspondence (2), (3) determines the position representation, as the operators q\u0302j are multiplication operators. Of course, we could ask what is the momentum representation, that is: What is the unitary equivalence F : L2(R, dx) \u2192 L2(R, dx) such that given the operator p\u0302 = \u2212i~d/dx, the transformed operator F \u25e6 p\u0302 \u25e6 F\u22121 acts via the multiplication by identity? (We are considering the one-dimensional case for ease of notation). The answer is, of course, that F is the well-known Fourier transform, defined as\nF(\u03c8)(p) = \u222b R e\u2212i p\u00b7x ~ \u03c8(x) dx . (4)\nIt suffices to note that the desired result is equivalent to\nF(p\u0302\u03c8)(p) = p \u00b7 (F\u03c8)(p) . (5)\nThis is proved by observing that unitary operators preserve the density of the domain and the closures, and integrating by parts (since the functions \u03c8(x) in the domain of p\u0302, vanish at infinity).\nExpression (5) suggests the following heuristic motivation for the introduction of\nthe Fourier transform: If we think of it as an integral transform whose kernel are the \u201ceigenfunctions\u201d of the momentum operator\u2021 (3), the plane waves e\u2212i p\u00b7x~ , then it is clear that the derivative inside the integral transform, after integration by parts so that it acts on the exponential, will give us the multiplying p. Then, given that the integration is done with respect to the x variable, p can be factored outside the integral. We will generalize this idea in later sections.\nFinally, after these admittedly long preliminaries, we can formulate the problem we\nare interested in, which is to compute the radial wave functions (using polar spherical coordinates) of the Hydrogen atom in the momentum representation. In Section 2 we will recall the correct form of the radial momentum in these coordinates, and we will compute the unitary transformation which diagonalizes it, by means of an integral transform whose kernel is given by its formal eigenfunctions. In Section 3 we briefly review the existing literature on this subject; in particular we review the LombardiOgilvie approach, whose output is a set of wave functions that are not manifestly SO(4)\u2212invariant. In 4 we give explicit expressions for the resulting radial functions of the Hydrogen atom in momentum space following our proposal, which have the advantage of being SO(4)\u2212invariant; we also prove the equivalence with the functions of Lombardi-Ogilvie. Finally, in Section 5 we present some conclusions and perspectives for future developments."

The reason is that this operator is not even symmetric, and, as a consequence, its expectation values calculated on Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s radial wave functions for a central potential are not real [10]. In fact, one gets an expression like\n\u3008p\u2032r\u3009 = i~ \u222b d\u2126 [\u222b \u221e 0 r2\u03c8(r) \u2202\u03c8\u2217(r) \u2202r dr ] + 2i~ \u222b d\u2126 \u222b \u221e 0 r2|\u03c8(r)|2 ,\nand the usual uncertainty relations do not hold in this case. This situation leads to unwanted consequences such as a violation of the second law of thermodynamics [11], so it has to be avoided.\nDe Witt [12] has devised a scheme to find the correct momentum operator conjugate\nto an arbitrary coordinate function (that is, maintaining the Heisenberg commutation relations (1)): Given any n\u2212dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g) (which in our case will be the Euclidean flat 3\u2212space M = R3), and a coordinate system xj on it, with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n (in our case the polar spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03d5)), the momentum operator corresponding to xj is given by\np\u0302j = \u2212i~ \u2202 \u2202xj \u2212 1 2 i~ n\u2211 k=1 \u0393kkj , (6)\nwhere \u0393kjl are the Christoffel symbols of the metric g expressed in the x j coordinate system. In the case of the flat three-dimensional Euclidean metric in polar spherical coordinates, it is immediate to find that the Christoffel symbols of interest are \u0393\u03b8\u03b8r = 1/r and \u0393\u03d5\u03d5r = 1/r, so we get the following expression for the radial momentum operator:\np\u0302r = \u2212i~ ( \u2202\n\u2202r +\n1 r\n) = \u2212i~1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r \u25e6 r , (7)\nsee also [9]. From a mathematical point of view, the operator p\u0302 defined in (6) is not free from problems. Its natural domain of definition are the smooth functions of compact support in the punctured space R3\u2212{0}, that is, Cc(R3\u2212{0}), and on this domain it is a symmetric operator. However, it is not an observable, since its deficiency indices are (0,\u221e) and, consequently, it does not have self-adjoined extensions (see [13]). Although, in particular, p\u0302r is not an observable, its square p\u0302 2 r is (since, being non-negative, it admits a Fredrich\u2019s extension).\nNow we turn our attention to the Hydrogen atom. This is a particular case of\na quantum system of two particles interacting through a central potential. The wave function \u03c8(q) describing the relative motion, satisfy the Suchd\u0308ingier equation\n(H\u03c8)(q) = [ \u2212 ~ 2\n2\u00b5 \u2206 + V (|q|)\n] \u03c8(q) = E\u03c8(q) ,\nwhere V (|q|) is a radial function (that is, invariant under rotations), and \u00b5 is the reduced mass. Introducing polar spherical coordinates, and doing a little algebra, this equation\nbecomes [ p\u03022r 2\u00b5 + L2 2\u00b5r2 + V (r) ] \u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = E\u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) , (8)\nwhere L is the relative orbital angular momentum, and V (r) = \u2212e2/r. By separation of variables, the solution to (8) is a superposition of functions of the form\n\u03c8N`m(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = RN`(r)Y m ` (\u03b8, \u03d5) .\nIn what follows, we will be interested in the resulting equation for RN`(r) (the\nradial invention), called the radial equation:[ p\u03022r 2\u00b5 + `(`+ 1)~2 2\u00b5r2 + V (r) ] RN`(r) = ENRN`(r) , (9)\nand our goal is: First, to find a unitary transformation H : L2(]0,\u221e[ , r2dr) \u2192 L2(R, r2dr)\u00a7 such that, given the operator p\u0302r, the transformed operator H \u25e6 p\u0302r \u25e6 H\u22121 acts via the multiplication by identity, that is, to find the momentum representation. Actually, we will not make use of the inverse transform, so we will prove (5) directly. Second, we want to express the radial wave function in this representation. We devote the remaining of this section to the first task, and the remaining sections to the second. In order to find the transformation H, we follow the heuristic idea exposed after (5), and start by finding the (formal) eigenfunctions of p\u0302r, that is, for each pr \u2208 ]0,\u221e[ , we want the solutions to p\u0302r\u03c8pr(r) = \u00b1pr\u03c8pr(r). As this equation is separable, we readily get\n\u03c8\u00b1pr(r) = e\u00b1i\npr \u00b7r ~\nr , (10)\nwhich represent outgoing and incoming spherical waves. Remark: In what follows, we will make free use of natural units for which ~ = 1, for the sake of readability.\nNotice that, outgoing and incoming spherical waves can be expressed in terms of\nspherical Hankel functions of the first h (1) 0 (x) and second h (2) 0 (x) kind, respectively given by\nh (1) 0 (x) = \u2212i\neix\nx , h\n(2) 0 (x) = i\ne\u2212ix\nx .\nFor instance, we have:\n\u03c8\u2212pr(r) = e\u2212iprr\nr = \u2212iprh(2)0 (prr) .\nNow, we can state the main result of this section. For the sake of clarity, we drop\nthe subindex r in the radial momentum, writing simply p instead of pr.\nTheorem 1. Define the transformation H : L2(]0,\u221e[ , r2dr)\u2192 L2(R, r2dr) by\n(H\u03c6)(p) = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r)\u03c8\u2212p (r)r 2dr . (11)\nThen, it holds H(p\u0302\u03c6)(p) = p \u00b7 (H\u03c6)(p) . (12) \u00a7 Although r lives in ]0,\u221e[ , the radial momentum pr takes real values, including negative ones.\nProof. First of all, notice that H acts as (H\u03c6)(p) = \u2212ip \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r)h (2) 0 (pr)r 2dr = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r)e\u2212iprrdr .\nWritten in this form, it is clear that it can be considered as a Fourier transform on a weighted Lebesgue space L1(]0,\u221e[ , rdr), as the weight u(r) = r is a locally integrable, positive function on ]0,\u221e[ \u2016. It is also apparent that the Schwartz class S(]0,\u221e[ ) is included in the domain of H (notice that the vector space of Schwartz functions is closed under multiplication by polynomials), so we can work in this subspace (or even in the smaller subspace of functions with compact support) and apply a standard density argument to extend the definition to the broader space L2(]0,\u221e[ , r2dr). The proof that H is unitary is also standard. Finally, we integrate by parts to show that (5) holds for any \u03c6 of compact support on ]0,\u221e[ :\nH(p\u0302\u03c6)(p) = \u222b \u221e 0 \u2212 i r \u2202 \u2202r (r\u03c6(r))\u03c8\u2212p (r)r 2 dr\n= \u222b \u221e 0 \u2212i \u2202 \u2202r (r\u03c6(r))\u03c8\u2212p (r)r dr\n= \u222b \u221e 0 r\u03c6(r) ( i \u2202 \u2202r ) (r\u03c8\u2212p (r)) dr\n= \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r) ( \u2212 i r \u2202 \u2202r ) (r\u03c8\u2212p (r)) r 2dr\n= \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r)(p\u0302\u03c8\u2212p )(r)r 2 dr\n= p \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c6(r)\u03c8\u2212p (r)r 2 dr = p(H\u03c6)(p) ."

We discuss this in more detail after eq. (19) below. Irrespective of the techniques applied, the result is known, and here we quote reference [3], where the radial wave functions in the momentum representation have been worked out for the general case of any dimension. Atoms in higher dimensions have unusual properties that can serve as signature of extra dimensions in quantum mechanics, as they are predicted by grand unification and string theories. For the three dimensional case at hand, the radial wave functions GN`(p) turn out to be\nGN`(p) = (2~\u03b2) 5 2 \u0393(`+ 1) \u221a (N \u2212 `\u2212 1)!N ! \u03c0(N + `)!\n(4~\u03b2p)`\n(~2\u03b22 + p2)`+2 C`+1N\u2212`\u22121\n( ~2\u03b22 \u2212 p2\n~2\u03b22 + p2\n) .

The symbols C\u03b1n (x) stand for Gegenbauer polynomials. After a change of variable in their argument, given by\ncos\u03c7p = ~2\u03b22 \u2212 p2\n~2\u03b22 + p2 , sin\u03c7p = 2~\u03b2p ~2\u03b22 + p2 , \u03c7p \u2208 [0, \u03c0] , (15)\nthe wave functions in the momentum representation obtained in this way, known as Podolsky-Pauling functions, read\nGN`(\u03c7p) = (2~\u03b2) 1 2 2`+2 \u221a (N \u2212 `\u2212 1)!N ! \u03c0(N + `)! \u0393(`+ 1) cos2 \u03c7p 2 S(N\u22121)`(\u03c7p),\nS(N\u22121)`(\u03c7p) = sin` \u03c7pC`+1N\u2212`\u22121(cos\u03c7p).

Indeed, it is clearly possible to factor the ultra-spherical harmonics Y(N\u22121)`m(\u03c7p, \u03b8p, \u03d5p) in the expression for the full wave functions GN`m(p ), thus explicitly showing the full O(4) symmetry of the Hydrogen atom in the momentum representation.\nIt is important to point out that the Podolsky-Pauling functions depend on\np2 = p2x+p 2 y+p 2 z, the squared (Euclidean) norm of the linear momentum, and not on the genuine radial momentum , pr, which is the projection of p on the direction of r, and can naively be thought in terms of its classical expression, pr = p cos \u03b8. In that sense, the Podolsky-Pauling functions seem conjugate to the radial Hydrogen atom wave functions when expressed in terms of r2 = x2 + y2 + z2, rather than to the radial coordinate itself (see the discussion in subsection 4.4, regarding the corresponding uncertainty relations)."

The normalization constant, here denoted by N LN`, can be consulted in eq. (33) in [7]. These calculations present several problems from a mathematical point of view, the most important one coming from the replacement (17), which needs a careful study of the domain in which is valid. From a physical perspective, the wave functions of Lombardi and Ogilvie, even being deduced from the correct radial momentum operator, have the drawback of not being explicitly SO(4)\u2212invariant, a fact which perhaps is the explanation of why they are not more widespread.\nIn the following section, we calculate the \u03c8N`(pr) functions from the integral\ntransform in Theorem 1, finding two new equivalent, although different looking, representations. We will prove that these two representations are necessarily equivalent to the \u03b1n`(pr) functions above.\nAs to the angular part of the wave functions, they have been constructed in [6], [7]\nas eigenfunctions of the operator p\u0302\u03b8 given by\nrp\u0302\u03b8 = \u2212i~ 1\u221a sin \u03b8 \u2202 \u2202\u03b8\n\u221a sin \u03b8 = \u2212i~\n( \u2202\n\u2202\u03b8 +\n1 2 cot \u03b8\n) , \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], (20)\nwhich is transformed by means of the unitary operator t = exp(i\u03c0u) making the change of variable u = cos \u03b8, in which case p\u0302\u03b8 becomes p\u0302t = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202u = \u03c0t\u2202/\u2202t. Obviously, the angular wave functions so obtained are essentially distinct from the associated Legendre function, Pm` (cos \u03b8), appearing in (16). In a way similar, the azimuthal wave functions are handled by setting v = exp(i\u03d5), leading to the operator p\u0302v = v\u2202/\u2202v. In fact, the complex functions by Lombardi and Ogilvie are quite different from the real ones by Podolsky and Pauling. In the following subsection, we briefly consider the possibility that the angular part of the momentum space wave functions may not be those given in the preceding works by Podolsky-Pauling or Lombardi-Ogilvie, so other parametrizations may be eligible as well."

In this sense, which functions are best suited to describe the actual Hydrogen atom is a question that should be decided on the basis of such experiments."

(28)\nIn order to evaluate I1 ( pr 2~\u03b2 ) and I2 ( pr 2~\u03b2 ) , we express the Hydrogen atom wave\nfunctions, based on Laguerre\u2019s generalized polynomials, in terms of finite sums of Slatertype functions.

Therefore, we obtain\nI1 ( pr\n2~\u03b2\n) = (2x)(`+ 5 2 +t) \u0393 (`+ 3 + t)P \u2212 1 2\n`+ 3 2 +t\n(x) ,\nand\nI2 ( pr\n2~\u03b2\n) = \u2212 2\n\u03c0 (2x)(`+ 5 2 +t)\u0393 (`+ 3 + t)Q\n\u2212 1 2 `+ 3 2 +t (x) ,\nrespectively, where\nx = 1\n2\n[( 1\n2\n)2 + ( pr\n2~\u03b2\n)2]\u2212 12 . (32)\nHere, P\u2212\u00b5\u03bd (x) and Q \u2212\u00b5 \u03bd (x) denote the associated Legendre functions of the first and the second kind, characterized by their order \u03bd, and degree \u00b5, with Re(\u03bd + \u00b5) > 0 (they are also known as Ferrers functions of the first and second kind [19]). Thus, we arrive at the following result.\nLemma 1. The radial momentum wave functions \u03c8N`(pr) can be expressed as the following finite series expansion:\n\u03c8N`(pr) = pr ~ NN` N\u2212`\u22121\u2211 t=0\n(\u22121)t (\nN + `\nN \u2212 `\u2212 1\u2212 t\n) 1\nt!(2\u03b2)3 (2x)(`+\n5 2 +t)\n\u00d7 \u221a \u03b2~\u03c0 pr \u0393(`+ 3 + t) ( P \u2212 1 2 `+ 3 2 +t (x) + i 2 \u03c0 Q \u2212 1 2 `+ 3 2 +t (x) ) ,\nwith x defined in (32). Proof. The statement follows by back substituting I1 ( pr 2~\u03b2 ) and I2 ( pr 2~\u03b2 ) in (30) and (31), respectively, and taking into account (28).\nNow, using the relations of P\u2212\u00b5\u03bd (x), Q \u2212\u00b5 \u03bd (x) with C \u03b4 \u03b3(x), D \u03b4 \u03b3(x), the Gegenbauer\nfunctions of the first and second kind respectively (see eq. (61) in [20], and eq. (1.13) in [21], here transcribed in the notation of [20]),\nP\u2212\u00b5\u03bd (x) = 2\u00b5\u221a \u03c0\n\u0393 ( \u00b5+ 1\n2\n) \u0393 (\u03bd \u2212 \u00b5+ 1)\n\u0393 (\u03bd + \u00b5+ 1) (1\u2212 x2)\n\u00b5 2C \u00b5+ 1 2\n\u03bd\u2212\u00b5 (x) ,\nQ\u2212\u00b5\u03bd (x) = 2 \u00b5\n\u221a \u03c0\n2\n\u0393 ( \u00b5+ 1\n2\n) \u0393 (\u03bd \u2212 \u00b5+ 1)\n\u0393 (\u03bd + \u00b5+ 1) (1\u2212 x2)\u00b5/2D\u00b5+1/2\u03bd\u2212\u00b5 (x) ,\n(in their respective intervals x \u2208 [\u22121, 1], and x \u2208 (\u22121, 1)), we can rewrite the expression for \u03c8N`(pr). To this end, we take \u00b5 = 1/2, \u03bd = `+ t+ 3/2 in the formulae above, to find\n\u03c8N`(pr) = N\u2212`\u22121\u2211 t=0 a (N) `t \u221a 1\u2212 x2 x(`+2+t) ( C1`+1+t(x) + iD 1 `+1+t(x) ) (33)\nwhere\na (N) `t = NN`2\n`+t+2 (\u22121)t (\nN + `\nN \u2212 `\u2212 1\u2212 t\n) 1\nt!(2\u03b2)2 \u0393(`+ t+ 2) .\nFinally, by making a further change of variables,\nx := cos \u03b3, (1\u2212 x2) := sin2 \u03b3, (34)\nwe arrive at the following result.\nTheorem 2. With the preceding notations, the radial momentum wave functions \u03c8N`(pr) can be expressed as the following finite series expansion:\n\u03c8N`(pr) = N\u2212`\u22121\u2211 t=0 a (N) `t sin \u03b3 cos `+2+t \u03b3 ( C1`+1+t(cos \u03b3) + iD 1 `+1+t(cos \u03b3) ) .\nNotice that this compact closed form of the radial momentum functions shows that,\nas in the case of the functions of Podolsky and Pauling, the functions presented here are expressible in terms of a so(2, 1) \u223c su(1, 1) basis. As shown in [21], the combination, C\u03bb\u03bd (x) + iD \u03bb \u03bd (x), defines a further Gegenbauer function of the second kind, D\u03bb\u03bd (x+ i0), now of complex argument, by putting\nC\u03bb\u03bd (x) + iD \u03bb \u03bd (x) = 2D\u03bb\u03bd (x+ i0), (35)\nwhere the notation i0, means the limit with respect to \u2192 0 in the corresponding function with the variable x+ i . With that, the expression for \u03c8N`(pr) can be written even more concisely.\nCorollary 1. With the preceding notations, the radial momentum wave functions \u03c8N`(pr) can be expressed as\n\u03c8N`(pr) = N\u2212`\u22121\u2211 t=0 2a (N) `t \u221a 1\u2212 x2 x(`+2+t)D1`+t+1(x+ i0), (36)\nNotice that the use of Slater-type functions in (30) above, can cause numerical\ninstabilities of the solutions (due to the alternating sign of the (\u22121)t factor) when the summation extends to very high (N\u2212`+1) values, a critical remark already expressed in [5]. However, contrary to the case of the Fourier transforms of the radial wave functions considered in [1], [5], [4], in the present case we can not avoid this problem by invoking the generating functions of the Laguerre and Gegenbauer polynomials. The reason for this is that, following this path, the hypergeometric function which would appear instead of 2F1 in eq. (20) in [5], can not be transformed to the binomial series (as 1F0, in eq. (21) in [5] does)."

Also, for illustrative purposes, we select some quantum numbers, for which the expressions look particularly simple. To be specific, below we compare the respective momentum distributions for ` = N \u2212 1. Modulo normalization constants, the Podolsky-Pauling distributions for maximal ` values corresponding to (14), read:\n|GN,N\u22121(p)|2 \u223c (4~\u03b2p)2(N\u22121)\n(~2\u03b22 + p2)2(N+1) (46)\nFor comparison, those of Lombardi-Ogilvie, in our parametrization (40) are given by,\n|\u03c8N,N\u22121(pr)|2 \u223c 1\n(~2\u03b22 + p2r) N+1\n(47)\nGraphically:\nAccording to (46), the Podolsky-Pauling momentum distribution for the ground\nstate falls off as (1 + p2/~2\u03b22)\u22124, a fact experimentally confirmed by [26].

The inequality in (48) encodes the complementary character of r2 and p2, and provides the explanation to the fact that the wave functions of Podolsky and Pauling are the ones appropriate for the description of the p2 expectation values distribution in the Hydrogen atom states. However, if what we want is the distribution of the expectation values of the radial momentum, \u3008pr\u3009, then the Lombardi-Ogilvie wave functions should be more appropriate. Indeed, our conclusion is that the two sets of functions under discussion are complementary to each other. While the ones by Podolsky and Pauling test the distribution of linear momenta with arbitrary orientation, those of Lombardi and Ogilvie would test the distribution of strictly radially aligned momenta, and this could be experimentally confirmed by appropriate radial polarization diffraction experiments, along the lines of [30].\n\u2217 Alternatively, such Heisenberg-like uncertainty relations can also been confirmed and generalized on the basis of information-theoretic methods [28], [29]."

This operator, although not self-adjoint, has the feature of satisfying Heisenberg\u2019s commutation rules with the radial coordinate.\nThe resulting radial wave functions are equivalent to those of Lombardi and Ogilvie\n[6, 7], and can be expressed either in terms of finite complex expansions of Gegenbauer functions of the first and second kind (Theorem 2 and Corollary 1), or in terms of (elementary) trigonometric functions (Theorem 3 in Section 4). The first representation reflects the so(2, 1) \u223c su(1, 1) Lie algebra symmetry properties of the momentum wave functions, while the second one shows explicitly properties such as square integrability and SO(4) symmetry, a feature that was absent from the Lombardi-Ogilvie functions.\nThe total wave functions of the Hydrogen atom in momentum space, if needed,\ncan be obtained as products of the radial functions presented here with the angular functions either of Lombardi and Ogilvie [7], or with those of Liu, Tang and Xun in [14], giving qualitatively different outcomes. Which is the correct one is a question that must be decided by means of comparison with experimental data.\nThe wave functions expressed in momentum representation, could be of use in\nstudying the radial diffraction of hydrogen beams through lattices such as graphene [25], roaming of Hydrogen atoms in the decomposition of organic compounds [31], momentum probabilities for particles in a Coulomb well [32], tunneling [33], [34], and other phenomena, in which Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty relation between the radial coordinate and the radial momentum is required, among them possibly questions of information entropies [35].\nIn addition, our approach may also be of interest to the construction of Wigner\u2019s\nphase-space functions and their applications, for example, along the lines of [36]."
