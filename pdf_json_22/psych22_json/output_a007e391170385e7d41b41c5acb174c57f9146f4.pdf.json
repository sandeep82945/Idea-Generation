    "abstractText": "Since December 2019, the COVID-19 has continued to rage, and epidemic prevention policies have limited contact between individuals, which may has a great influence on the income of individuals, exacerbate anxiety and depression, and cause serious mental health problems. The current study aims to examine the association between income and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the data of 9,296 observations from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies. Employing ordinary least squares regression and two-stage least squares regression, we find the significant positive effect of income on Chinese mental health during this pandemic. In addition, the number of cigarettes smoked per day has significant negative effects on mental health. Education level\u02cemarriage and exercise frequency have significant positive correlation with mental health. Furthermore, the impact of income on individuals of different groups is heterogeneous during this pandemic. The impact of income for well-educated individuals is less strong than their lesseducated counterparts. People who exercise regularly respond less strongly to changes in income than those who do not exercise. Finally, individuals\u2019 salary satisfaction and interpersonal relationship are shown to be the potential mechanism for the effect of income on Chinese mental health.",

Therefore, low-income people are more likely to suffer from mental disorders (Golberstein, 2015; Kiely et\u00a0al., 2015; Thomson et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThe importance of mental health is confirmed by the World Health Organization (Grad, 2002), which defines health as \u201cthe state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not just the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d Mental health is closely related to individuals\u2019 living quality and work efficiency. Many studies have shown that mental illness has great harm to individuals and society, such as domestic violence, physical illness and poor interpersonal relationships (Yanguas et\u00a0 al., 2011; Bradbury-Jones and Isham, 2020; Usher et\u00a0al., 2020; Pelissier et\u00a0al., 2021; Larsson et\u00a0al., 2022). Severe mental illness can even lead to suicide (Czeisler et\u00a0al., 2022). In the world, approximately 703,000 people die by suicide every year (World Health Organization, 2021a).\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 (Zhu et\u00a0 al., 2022) and spread rapidly. The World Health Organization (WHO) declare it is a global pandemic in the second week of March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2021b). COVID-19 is widely disseminated, lacks specific drugs, and is life-threatening if not treated in time. In addition, the information overload of the epidemic has caused a huge impact on the public\u2019s psychology, causing them to feel panic, anxiety and depression. In order to stop the continued spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, the government has implemented strict epidemic prevention measures and limited contact between individuals (Fang et\u00a0al., 2021a), which has a great influence on individuals\u2019 income and may exacerbate anxiety and depression.\nRelated research shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on people\u2019s mental health (Killgore et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhai and Du, 2022). Most scholars\u2019 analyses take the COVID-19 pandemic as a whole. For example, Xiong et\u00a0al. (2022) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress in many different countries, which may have a negative impact on individual\u2019s mental health. This result was also confirmed by S\u00e1nchez et\u00a0al. (Huremovi\u0107, 2019; Cao et\u00a0al., 2020; Galli et\u00a0al., 2022; S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2022). McAlearney et\u00a0al. (2022) studied the mental health status of first responders (including police, firefighters, and emergency medical services) and their influencing factors during the pandemic, and many similar studies have been conducted in the literature (Cohen Veterans Network, 2020; Stogner et\u00a0al., 2020; Hendrickson et\u00a0al., 2022). The economic developments of all countries in the world are severely hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic (Islam, 2021; Mishra and Mishra, 2021; Nwosa, 2021; Fang et al., 2022a; Huang et al., 2022; Nawo and Njangang, 2022). Also, a large number of residents\u2019 incomes have declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fang et al., 2021b, 2022b; Umi\u0144ski and Borowicz, 2021). The reduction of income may influent the individuals\u2019 mental health. Ao et\u00a0al. (2020) and Liang et\u00a0al. (2021) examined the impact of income on mental health during the pandemic and showed that very wealthy people had the lowest levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the\nproportion of participants showing significant depressive symptoms was significantly higher among those who are disadvantaged in economy.\nRecent trends have also led to a proliferation of research on the link between human activity and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Quarta et\u00a0al. (2022) analyzed the association of physical activity and outdoor leisure time with the mental health of college students. Foong et\u00a0 al. (2022) conducted a study on the relationship between Internet use and mental health in the elderly. Laurinaityt\u0117 et\u00a0al. (2022) studied the association between health risk behaviors and mental health among Lithuanian university students. In addition, studies have shown that persistent loneliness and social isolation have adverse effects on the mental health of college students (Charbonnier et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThough the existing literature has investigated the determinants of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic from different perspectives, little attention has been paid to the impact from the specific economic perspective, such as individual income, especially for Chinese. This article attempts to fill a gap in the relevant literature on the impact of income on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We\u00a0used data from the 2020 China Family Panel Study (CFPS; China Family Panel Studies, 2021), whose stratified and multi-stage sampling design enables the sample to represent almost 95% of the Chinese population, covering different ages, education levels, and national region, useful in determining the general impact of income on individual mental health. We\u00a0focus on China for three reasons. First, China\u2019s social security system is imperfect, with a series of problems such as narrow coverage, low level of security, and inadequate laws. Given this, income has a bigger impact on the Chinese. Second, many Chinese are facing serious challenges of mental health problems. The latest epidemiological survey shows that the weighted lifetime prevalence of various mental illnesses among the Chinese population over the age of 18 is 16.6% (Huang et\u00a0al., 2019), and the overall mental health literacy is at a moderately low level. Third, in Chinese social life, the importance of mental health is often overlooked. In fact, mental health issues affect the quality of development in China.\nThis paper not only investigates the impact of income on mental health, but also considers the heterogeneous effects and mechanisms of income on mental health. Therefore, our study proposes 5 hypotheses.\nIndividual\u2019s life is affected by income from different aspects (Ettner, 1996). For example, lower income can bring huge economic pressure to person\u2019s life, which may makes individuals face more psychological crises, showing psychological symptoms such as anxiety, loneliness, and sensitivity to human relationships. On the other hand, higher income increases people\u2019s financial ability to afford a better budget for the higher living standards and professional services for maintaining healthy lifestyles, improving factors such as depression, impaired relationships, and food security (Ao et\u00a0al., 2020; Thomson et\u00a0al., 2020; Xiao et\u00a0al.,\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\n2020; Liang et\u00a0al., 2021; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2022). Based on the above analysis, we\u00a0propose Hypothesis 1.\nHypothesis 1. Income has a significant positive effect on individual's mental health.Covid-19 had a greater impact on the mental health of less-educated participants (S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2022). First, well-educated people have more social and economic resources than less-educated people. They tend to have higher incomes and live without economic pressure, which is beneficial to mental health. Second, most of well-educated people have an optimistic outlook on life. It is important to cope with the difficulties in the life, including the negative effects of low incomes (Xiao et\u00a0al., 2020). In sum, the impact of income on mental health may not be\u00a0 the same for people with different educational levels. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 arises.\nHypothesis 2. The impact of income for well-educated individuals is less strong than it is for their less-educated counterparts. Caponnetto et\u00a0al. (2021) argue that appropriate exercise helps avoid physical and mental problems in children and adults by promoting neuronal plasticity. In addition, the existing studies indicates that physical exercise can reduce anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms (Marques et\u00a0al., 2020; Loureiro et\u00a0al., 2021).Those who exercised regularly were less negatively affected by low income. The effect of income on mental health may not be\u00a0the same for people with different frequency of exercise. Based on the above analysis, we\u00a0propose Hypothesis 3.\nHypothesis 3. People that exercises regularly show a less strong responses to changes of income than those who do not.There is an influence mechanism in the relationship between income and mental health. Income is an objective variable, while the mental health is come from the individual\u2019s subjective feelings. Considering the same income, people may have completely different subjective feelings. So we\u00a0 take salary satisfaction as a mediation variable. Existing research shows that salary satisfaction has a positive impact on personal mental health, because people with high salary satisfaction have more active emotions and life attitudes than those with low salary satisfaction (Sorhagen and Wurster, 2017). In addition, research by Wu and Zhou (2017) also shows that higher income than one\u2019s own expectations will lead to higher happiness. Therefore, we\u00a0propose Hypothesis 4.\nHypothesis 4. Personal income affects mental health through its effect on salary satisfaction. Pelissier et al. (Pelissier et\u00a0al., 2021; Larsson et\u00a0al., 2022) point out that person who is lack of social activity is apt to the psychological stress caused by social isolation and social exclusion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, socially inactive people are at higher risk for psychological stress. Furthermore, good interpersonal relationship is the result of participation in various social activities. The high self-evaluated score of interpersonal relationships is beneficial to erase psychological distress due to the social activity. And income has a direct impact on interpersonal relationship. Research by Lee et\u00a0al. (2021) shows that low-income boys are at higher risk for smartphone addiction, and that smartphone use reduces the frequency and quality of their interactions with friends. Han (2013) finding\nthat the interpersonal interactions of students at all levels are significantly affected by their family\u2019s economic status. Therefore, we\u00a0propose Hypothesis 5.\nHypothesis 5. Personal income has an impact on mental health through its effect on interpersonal relationship."

The CFPS is designed to studies on economic activities, education outcomes, family dynamics and relationships, migration, and health. Its stratified multi-stage sampling design enables the sample to represent almost 95% of the Chinese population, which is conducive to further heterogeneity analysis. CFPS takes individuals and families as the main research subjects at the same time. The on-site interviews use three technical tools: CAPI (computeraided face-to-face interview), CATI (computer-aided telephone interview) and CAWI (computer-aided online interview). Faceto-face interviews are the mainstay, supplemented by internet and telephone interviews. The project will be\u00a0 carried out in 25 provinces/cities/autonomous regions in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Hainan Province) in 2020. Unfortunately, for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the respondents, we\u00a0cannot learn how CFPS participants were recruited and invited to the study. To examine the impact of income on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study used the 2020 baseline survey for analysis. Out of 28,590 observations, only 9,296 could be\u00a0used for the current study due to concerns over missing data or uncertain answers. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (TSLS) were used for econometric analysis to investigate the impact of income on mental health."

According to the study of Yang and Li (2019), the two-stage least squares method was used to obtain unbiased parameter estimates, and then a consistent estimate of the effect of endogenous variables on the explained variables was obtained.

In order to evaluate individual\u2019s mental health more objectively and comprehensively, following existing studies (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2022), the mental health index is derived from the 6-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) in the CFPS. (CES-D questions: 1. In the past week, how many times have you\u00a0felt down? 2. In the past week, how many times did you\u00a0feel that you\u00a0were struggling to do anything? 3. In the past week, how many times have you\u00a0had poor sleep? 4. In the past week, how many times have you\u00a0felt lonely? 5. In the past week, how many times have you\u00a0felt sad? 6. In the past week, how many times have you\u00a0 felt that life could not go on? Individuals were asked to indicate the frequency of their feelings on a four-scale metric\u2014 \u201cAlmost never (less than a day),\u201d \u201cSometimes (1\u20132 days),\u201d \u201cOften (3\u20134 days),\u201d \u201cMost of the time (5\u20137 days).\u201d These responses are assigned a value of 4 to 1, respectively).\nThe Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a self-rating tool developed by the National Institutes of Mental Health (Radloff) in 1977 to evaluate the current level of depression in community populations (Radloff, 1977). This scale has been translated and used in many countries and has good reliability and validity (Van de Velde et\u00a0al., 2011). We\u00a0used SPSS26 to calculate the reliability of the questionnaire, and the Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for the CES-D scale was 0.763, which showed that the CES-D scale has good reliability.\nReferring to the method of Cheng et\u00a0al. (Kling et\u00a0al., 2007; Chen and Wu, 2021), the personal mental health index is an equally\nweighted sum of the standardization of score variable (z-score) of the above 6 components. The specific equation is as follows:\nMentalHealthi j\nij j\nj\nx u = \u2212\n= \u2211 1\n6\n\u03c3 (8)\nIn the equation, MentalHealthi represents the mental health index of the individual, xij represents the individual data of each variable, u j and \u03c3 j represent the overall mean and standard deviation of the variable, respectively. The mental health index calculated from this is \u221221.165 to 4.537. The higher the mental health index, the better the individual\u2019s mental health, and vice versa."

These results help us understand the heterogeneity of the effects of personal income on mental health. Finally, existing research fail to provide mechanisms on how income affects mental health. This paper reveals that income can affect mental health through the impact on salary satisfaction and interpersonal relationship.\nOne feature of current research is tending to focus on specific populations and regions. For example, Brasso et\u00a0 al. (2022) conducted a meta-analysis of the existing literature and found that the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a significant impact on the mental health of young people. Rapisarda et\u00a0 al. (2022) analyzed mental health symptoms of mental health workers in Lombardy and Quebec during COVID-19. However, the above studies are based on descriptive studies and lack empirical support. Our study employs ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares (TSLS) to investigate the causal effects of income on individual mental health and to provide empirical evidence. Baseline results were consistent with previous studies (S\u00e1nchezRodr\u00edguez et\u00a0 al., 2022). Furthermore, most studies used non-probability samples. Unlike Pais-Ribeiro et\u00a0al. (Pais-Ribeiro et\u00a0al., 2022), our study is derived from large-scale micro survey data. Also we\u00a0provide a mechanistic analysis. Different from the previous studies that the effect of income appears to be\u00a0mediated largely by debt (Jenkins et\u00a0 al., 2008), our study identifies the\nmechanism variables are salary satisfaction and interpersonal relationship.\nAnother feature of current research is apt to prove that there is a positive correlation between income and mental health. For instant, most scholars (Ao et\u00a0al., 2020; Thomson et\u00a0al., 2020; Liang et\u00a0al., 2021) believe that income has a positive impact on mental health during COVID-19. However, due to the obvious endogeneity between income and mental health, it is difficult to obtain consistent estimates by OLS. Obviously, there is a bidirectional causal relationship between income and mental health. Chisholm et\u00a0al. (2016) found that higher income improves mental health, which can further improve livelihoods or economic security by increasing productivity, promoting labor market participation, and increasing the income. This study attempts to solve this problem by selecting the housing provident fund as an instrumental variable. The empirical results report the causal effect of personal income on mental health and test the hypotheses. Furthermore, little discuss is on the heterogeneity of income\u2019s effect on individual mental health. Our research shows that income affects individuals\u2019 mental health differently, depending on the individual\u2019s level of education and frequency of exercise. That is, less education showed a stronger response to changes in income, regardless of whether they were based on annual personal income or hourly wages. People who did not exercise were more responsive to changes in income than those who exercised regularly.\nTABLE\u00a07 Heterogeneous effects of different exercise frequencies on income.\n(1) (2) (2) (3)\nNo exercise Regular exercise No exercise Regular exercise\nIncome 0.383*** (5.30) 0.153* (1.97)\nWage 0.337*** (5.13) 0.205** (2.85)\n_cons \u22125.982*** (\u22127.84) \u22122.549** (\u22123.15) \u22122.767*** (\u22128.60) \u22121.380*** (\u22123.58)\nN 5,534 3,762 5,534 3,762"

First, the sample data is cross-sectional. We\u00a0can only estimate the short-term effects of income on individual\u2019s mental health, not taking into account the long-term effects. Also the conclusions that can be\u00a0drawn from our survey results only involve absolute income, we\u00a0 cannot analyze whether income loss occurred during the epidemic and the impact of income loss on individual mental health. Second, although we\u00a0try our best to include factors that may affect individual\u2019s mental health, the model cannot include all external factors that affect individual\u2019s mental health. Third, aside from data limitations, we\u00a0measure mental health in a very general way. An interesting avenue of future research can be\u00a0predicted regarding the long-term and dynamic effects of income on individual mental health. In addition, studies can investigate the causal relationship between income and specific psychological problems, such as postpartum depression.\nSeveral policy implications can be\u00a0derived from this analysis. First, our research shows that income has a significant positive effect on an individual\u2019s mental health. Therefore, governments and society as a whole may need to provide assistance to low-income people. This help should be\u00a0 directed not only to financial subsidies, but also to effective mental health care. Particular attention should be\u00a0paid to those who are less educated and do not exercise regularly. Finally, the government should also develop mental health services for vulnerable groups and encourage social workers to conduct home visits. Additionally, programs involving outdoor activities can be\u00a0 provided to encourage low-income groups to get out of their homes and start interacting with others, while maintaining appropriate social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19, improve their relationships, and reduce their depression."

            "text": "Given the importance of mental health in daily life, there has been an increasing amount of research on this topic during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses 9,296 items of data from the 2020 CFPS survey to investigate the causal relationship\nbetween income and mental health. One of the most important findings to emerge from the paper is that income has a positive effect on mental health during the pandemic.\nThe effect of heterogeneity was further analyzed by segmenting the sample according to education level and exercise. On the one hand, the findings show that changes in income have a slightly stronger effect on people with less education than those with well education. On the other hand, those who exercised regularly showed a less strong responses to changes in income than those who do no. Our study also investigates the mechanisms by which income affects mental health, showing that income affects mental health through its effects on salary satisfaction and interpersonal relationship."
