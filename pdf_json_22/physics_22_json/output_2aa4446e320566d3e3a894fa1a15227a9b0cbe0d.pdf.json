    "abstractText": "An ultra-high-sensitivity, miniaturized Fabry-Perot interferometric (FPI) fiber-optic microphone (FOM) has been developed, utilizing a silicon cantilever as an acoustic transducer. The volumes of the cavity and the FOM are determined to be 60 microliters and 102 cubic millimeters, respectively. The FOM has acoustic pressure sensitivities of 1506 nm/Pa at 2500 Hz and 26,773 nm/Pa at 3233 Hz. The minimum detectable pressure (MDP) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the designed FOM are 0.93 \u03bcPa/Hz1/2 and 70.14 dB, respectively, at an acoustic pressure of 0.003 Pa. The designed FOM has the characteristics of ultra-high sensitivity, low MDP, and small size, which makes it suitable for the detection of weak acoustic signals, especially in the field of miniaturized all-optical photoacoustic spectroscopy.",

            "text": "Weak acoustic signal detection is essential in petroleum exploration [1], gas leakage monitoring [2], and photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) [3]. Especially in miniaturized alloptical PAS [4\u20136] field, the microphones, featuring high sensitivity, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), ultimately improve the detection limit of trace gases. Fiber-optic microphones (FOMs) featuring high sensitivity, high SNR, high resolution, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, have become one of the most efficient solutions for weak acoustic signal detection [7\u201310]. The common FOM structures include a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) [11], a Michelson interferometer (MI) [12\u201314], and a Fabry-Perot (F-P) interferometer [15\u201317]. Among the above FOMs, the F-P interferometric (FPI)-based FOMs have attracted extensive attention from researchers due to their lower cost, smaller volume, higher sensitivity, and greater stability. The diaphragm is forced to vibrate via external sinusoidal acoustic pressure. Thus, the performance of the diaphragm, depending on its material and construction [18], is crucial for the practical application of the FOMs. Recently, various diaphragm materials have been employed on FPI-based FOMs to improve their performance in practical applications, e.g., silver, silicon, Parylene-C, polymer, and graphene [19\u201326]. In 2015, Li et al. [27] fabricated a FOM using multilayer graphene films (diameter = 125 \u00b5m) and achieved a sound pressure sensitivity of 2380 nm/kPa. In 2018, Ni et al. [25] reported a FOM based on an ultra-thin graphene diaphragm (thickness = 10 nm). A minimum detectable pressure (MDP) of 33.97 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 at 10 kHz was achieved. Although the performance of graphene-based FOMs was better, there were some disadvantages, such as a complex manufacturing process and high costs. Xu et al. [7] demonstrated a FOM utilizing a large area of silver film. The sensitivity and MDP reached 160 nm/Pa and\nSensors 2022, 22, 6948. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22186948 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 6948 2 of 13\n14.5 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 at 4 kHz, respectively. In 2017, we proposed a highly sensitive FOM based on a thin silver diaphragm [9]; the pressure sensitivity, temperature sensitivity, and MDP were 5.97 \u00b5m/Pa, 0.139 nm/\u25e6C, and 40 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 at 1.6 kHz. Despite the fact that the manufacturing process of silver-film-based FOM was simple, a large-area diaphragm was required to improve the sensitivity, which limited its application range. Recently, several novel diaphragm structures have attracted many researchers, who applied them to FPI-based FOMs. In 2020, Yao et al. [28] developed an ultra-small fibertip FOM utilizing optical three-dimensional printing technology. The sensitivity and MDP reached 118.3 mV/Pa and 0.328 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 under experimental tests. Although the fiber-tip FOM was small in size and had excellent sensitivity and MDP, it had some drawbacks, such as complex manufacturing processes and a poor SNR that limited its practical application in industry. Chen et al. [29] proposed a highly sensitive and stable FPI-based FOM by combining a white-light interference (WLI) demodulation algorithm and a cantilever based on a stainless steel material. This FOM, with sensitivity and MDP corresponding to 211.2 nm/Pa and 5 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 at a working frequency of 1 kHz, had been applied to an all-optical PAS for trace gas detection. However, due to the precision of the laser-marking machine and the characteristics of stainless steel, the sensitivity of the cantilever-based FOM was very low when its operating frequency exceeded 2000 Hz. Therefore, it was not suitable for use in high-frequency scenarios. In 2021, we presented an FOM based on a small-size cantilever with a sensitivity of 950 nm/Pa at 14.8 kHz, an MDP of 25.68 \u00b5Pa/Hz1/2 at 13 kHz, and an SNR of 71.81 at 0.1 Pa [30]. Although the FOM was small in size, it had poor sensitivity and SNR. Moreover, in order to adapt the working frequency of the silicon cantilever, an ultra-high-speed demodulator was required, which increased the demodulation system cost. In this paper, we report an ultra-high-sensitivity, miniaturized FPI FOM for weak acoustic signal detection. The FOM includes a silicon cantilever, a copper material shell, and a single-mode fiber. The working frequency of the silicon cantilever is less than a few kHz, avoiding the use of an ultra-high-speed spectrometer. A miniaturized FOM as the acoustic wave detection unit and a high-speed spectrometer as the demodulator have been successfully implemented for weak acoustic signal detection."

The frequency response curve shows a relatively flat trend from 1000 Hz to 2700 Hz. The designed FOM not only has high sensitivity but also has a high Q value, so the sensitivity in the relatively flat frequency response region (2500 Hz) also reaches 1506 nm/Pa, which is better than the sensitivity of the most currently reported FOM at the resonance frequency.\nFigure 6.

The designed FOM sensitivity reaches 26,773 nm/Pa at the first-order resonant frequency. Meanwhile, the Q value reaches about 65 (3233/50).

Therefore, we have performed a test of this characteristic on the designed FOM.
