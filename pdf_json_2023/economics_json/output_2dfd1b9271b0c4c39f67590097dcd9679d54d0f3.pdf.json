    "abstractText": "Abstract The evaluation of the sustainable development of resource-based cities is still one of the hotspots in today\u2019s social research. Taking Jining, Shandong Province, as the research object, this work combines a relevant emergy evaluation index system with system dynamics, establishes a resource-based city emergy flow system dynamics model, and studies sustainable development path in the next planning year. In the work, the key factors affecting the sustainable development of Jining are obtained through the coupling of regression and SD sensitivity analysis, and some scenarios are set up by combining them with the local 14th Five-year plan. Besides, the appropriate scenario (M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H) for Jining\u2019s future sustainable development is chosen in accordance with regional circumstances. That is, during the 14th Five-year Plan period, the appropriate development ranges for the growth rate of social fixed assets investment, the growth rate of raw coal emergy, the growth rate of grain emergy and the reduction rate of solid waste emergy are 17.5\u201318.3%, \u2212 4.0 to \u2212 3.2%, 1.8\u20132.6% and 4\u20134.8%. The methodology system constructed in this article can serve as a reference for similar studies, and the research findings can aid the government in formulating pertinent plans for resource-based cities.",

            "text": "Ecological and environmental protection has emerged as a major worldwide concern, particularly in the ecological improvement and development of resource-based cities (Mcphearson et\u00a0 al., 2015). A resource-based city is established or developed on the basis of resource exploitation. It is a special type of city dominated by mining or primary processing industries. (Qu et\u00a0al., 2017). In the process of the city\u2019s development, the single development model frequently leads to its ecosystem more fragile than typical cities, with noticeable characteristics of complexity, vulnerability, ecological sensitivity, and heterogeneity (Cui et\u00a0 al., 2015). Predatory exploitation has brought many resource depletion and urban development problems, such as unreasonable economic structure, high resource dependence, large energy consumption, and serious deterioration of ecological environment, because of over-reliance on local resources (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2015; Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2003). Many countries have formulated remedies in response to these problems. The typical ones are mainly to realize industrial upgrading through industrial structure adjustment or vigorously develop circular economy to transform economic development mode (Huang et\u00a0al., 2011; Ren, 2011). The common cities of the former mainly include Potosi, a gold mining city in Bolivia (Pretes, 2002), Lorraine of France (Huang et\u00a0al., 2011) and Fuxin in Liaoning Province of China (Tan et\u00a0al., 2016). The latter mainly include Ruhr in Germany (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2012), Taiyuan in Shanxi Province (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2012), and Zibo in Shandong Province of China (Ren, 2011). Although the above measurements have played a vital role in the sustainable development of resource-based cities in various countries, some problems still persist in the specific analysis of its implementation process, especially for China\u2019s resource-based cities, where the development mode of \u201cpollution first and treatment later\u201d is prominent, the path to sustainable development is unclear, and there is a lack of highlevel design planning (Chiu et\u00a0al., 2004). Therefore, the sustainable development evaluation and promotion path of resource-based cities must be further studied as the world is pursuing the development of a green and low-carbon recycling model.\nAccording to the literature analysis, most scholars\u2019 research on the sustainable development level of resource-based cities mainly focuses on two aspects: evaluation and prediction. The main research methods for evaluation are emergy analysis and index system evaluation. Cheng and Cheng (2017) contrasted the ecological economic systems of Hakka and non-Hakka villages in the Lui\u2013Tui area in southern Taiwan through emergy analysis, and provided useful suggestions for local sustainable development. Wan et\u00a0al. (2020) constructed the evaluation index system of rural environmental value added based on the emergy analysis theory, and put forward corresponding strategies for the sustainable development of the socioeconomic natural compound ecological environment in Queshan village, Shanxi Province of China. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2014a) established the low-carbon economy evaluation index system for resource-based cities and proposed specific promotion strategies for the development of low-carbon economy in resource-based cities to provide a reference for the sustainable development of these cities. Yang et\u00a0 al. (2021) constructed ecological vulnerability indexes coupled with natural and human factors to form a corresponding index system, and evaluated the ecological vulnerability of Huaibei based on it. Compared with the traditional index system evaluation (Yang et\u00a0 al., 2021; Zhang et\u00a0 al.,\n1 3\n2014a), the biggest advantage of emergy analysis is that it can realize the unification and comparison of material, energy, currency and information flow. Therefore, as an important method to evaluate the value of natural resources and social economy by taking into account ecology and economics, emergy has gradually evolved into an important means of evaluating regional sustainability and circular economy development (Wang et\u00a0al., 2021a, 2021b). In order to reflect these characteristics of resource-based cities, it is necessary to objectively evaluate and compare various ecological flows of it, so it is feasible to use emergy theory to evaluate their sustainable development.\nThe main research methods for prediction are mathematical modeling, SD, and scenario analysis. Jiang et\u00a0al. (2019) proposed a new urban ecological carrying capacity prediction model composed of a radial basis function (RBF) neural network to predict the future ecological pressure index of Yulin, Shaanxi Province, China. Zang et\u00a0al. (2015) applied the multiple regression \u201cland use\u201d dynamic model (Z-H model) to predict the land use change trend in Daqing, Heilongjiang Province, China and determined the feasible land use operation mode of the urban ecosystem. Xing et\u00a0 al. (2021) established a SD model from the perspective of ecology, conducted a situation simulation, and proposed corresponding suggestions to improve the sustainability of resource-based cities. Zhang et\u00a0al. (2014b) proposed the sustainable indexes of resource-based cities, including environmental, social, and economic dimensions, adopting three weighting scenarios to provide policymakers with a comprehensive perspective of future urban supervision. Among these, the mathematical modeling method considers few influencing factors, and there may be errors when dealing with problems (Jiang, 2019), which cannot reflect the complex ecosystem of resourcebased cities. The scenario analysis method is highly subjective and requires high accuracy, logic and causality of scenario data (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014b). System dynamics is a system analysis method, which reflects not only the feedback between the stock, flow and auxiliary variables of each part of the system, but also the dynamics, feedback, delay and complexity of the system (Selvakkumaran et\u00a0al., 2020). It has become an important method to predict dynamic complex systems (Liu et\u00a0al., 2022). In view of the fact that the resource-based city is a dynamic complex system, which needs to consider the complex logical relationship between variables and subsystems as well as the feedback between various parts, the above characteristics are more consistent with the functional properties of system dynamics, so it is feasible to choose it as the main research method in this study.\nBased on the above literature analysis, if only the emergy analysis (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2017; Wan et\u00a0 al., 2020) is used, considering the vulnerability and ecological sensitivity of resource-based cities (Cui et\u00a0al., 2015), any small change to one factor could have a significant impact on the entire system, and it is difficult to represent statically the city\u2019s dynamic interaction. Therefore, it is necessary to dynamically analyze the relationship between the internal structure of the system and different subsystems (Fang et\u00a0al., 2016), and system dynamics can just reflect the dynamics of resource-based cities, making up for the lack of dynamic of emergy analysis. Therefore, it is feasible to choose the coupling of emergy and system dynamics to explore the sustainable development of resource-based cities. In addition, some scholars have made some research achievements (Fang et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2022) in exploring urban sustainability by the coupling of emergy and system dynamics, but few of them use it as research on resource-based cities. We applied this method to resource-based cities, which is also a major contribution of this paper.\nIn the first part of the article, we summarize the literature related to resource-based cities and determine the research methods; In the second part, we establish the methodology systems about emergy, system dynamics, regression analysis and Monte Carlo; In the third part, we introduce the specific contents and results of the above methodology systems,\n1 3\ndiscuss the results, and select the optimal scenario; In the fourth part, we put forward conclusions and relevant policy recommendations based on the results."

Fourth, combined with MC simulation, the four key variables are designed according to the arrangement and combination of low, medium and high schemes. Later, the SD model is used to predict and compare the emergy indicators under different scenarios, and the most suitable development model is selected. Finally, the TOPSIS method is used to quantitatively validate the chosen conclusion. The most suitable path for the sustainable development of resource-based cities is obtained according to the verification conclusion. The research framework of this study is shown in Fig.\u00a01."

According to exploration and prediction, the city\u2019s coal reserves are 26 billion tons, accounting for 50% of Shandong Province. This city is one of the eight key coal bases in China (Jining, 2020). Jining has a developed coal power industry. In 2017, the raw coal output was 79.0749 million tons, accounting for 57.69% of the total output of Shandong Province. Meanwhile, the total coal consumption was 69.6631 million tons, accounting for 18.25% of the total coal consumption of Shandong Province. Jining\u2019s power plant density ranks second in China, with a total installed capacity of 10.25 million kW, accounting for 17% of Shandong Province, and more than 70% of the power is transmitted to the outside (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2007). The city\u2019s economic development model is characterized by a single industrial structure and obvious\n1 3\ncharacteristics of heavy coal power, resulting in certain continuous problems, such as high resource development intensity, insufficient reserve resources, environmental damage, and serious pollution, which has brought many negative effects on the local economic development and social stability. According to the findings, Jining urgently needs to improve its level of ecological sustainability through ecological transformation. A large number of cities in China rely on their natural resources. We chose Jining, a prototypical resourcebased city, as our case study, because it is highly representative and could provide a useful reference for the ecological transformation of other prototypical resource-based cities. The geographical location of Jining is shown in Fig.\u00a02."

Assume that function Y = f (X); X = (x1, x2 \u2026 xn), where X is a random variable subject to a specific probability distribution, and f (X) is an unknown or very complex function. Each random variable X is obtained by direct or indirect sampling, and then it is substituted into the equation to obtain the function value: Y. In this way, a series of data Y1, Y2 \u2026 Yn can be obtained. When the number of independent simulations is quite large, the probability characteristics of Y can be determined, and its accuracy can replace the analytical solution as the final result (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2004). In scenario setting, we take four regulatory factors as independent variables and two sustainable evaluation indexes as dependent variables to change the results from numerical form to interval form. In scenario selection, four regulatory factors also serve as independent variables and GDP serves as dependent variable. After the dependent variable changed into interval form, select this scenario according to whether the area composed of the target value and the upper limit exceeds half of the area of the upper and lower limit (More than 50% meet the standard). The introduction of Monte Carlo simulation can reduce the errors between the simulation results and the actual values caused by the instability of regulatory factors, and increase the accuracy of the article."

EISD represents the social and economic benefits under unit environmental pressure while taking into account market factors, and the above three independent variables have a significant impact on EISD from market factors (output emergy), economic benefits (social fixed asset investment) and environmental pressure (grain emergy), respectively.\nAccording to the analysis in Table\u00a05, the R2 of the model is 0.978, which means that the above five independent variables can explain the reason for the 97.8% change of UEI. The model passes the F-test (f = 451.367, p = 5.7730E-15 < 0.05), which also shows that at least one of the above five independent variables will have an impact on UEI.

UEI is a function including the ratio of nonrenewable emergy to total emergy, the ratio of waste emergy to total emergy and emergy yield ratio. It can integrate the discharge of system waste and consumption of nonrenewable resources. Therefore, the raw coal emergy (nonrenewable resources) and solid waste emergy (system waste) in Table\u00a05 are the most influential factors to UEI.\nEISD emphasizes economic benefits more than UEI. Its fundamental purpose is to maximize economic benefits under less environmental pressure. Its advantage is that it takes market factors into account, but its characterization of environmental pressure is not specific enough (waste emissions are not taken into account). UEI can overcome this defect and emphasize the balanced development of metabolic efficiency of economy, resources and environment."

Scenario H\u2013H\u2013L\u2013M strictly limits the development speed of renewable resources and increases the investment in nonrenewable resources, resulting in a decline growth rate of EISD and UEI, which is the worst development scenario. Scenarios H\u2013H\u2013M\u2013M and H\u2013M\u2013L\u2013H are slightly better\n1 3\nthan the former.

However, the sustainable indexes are not prominent enough due to too small adjustments, so it is not the best choice.

However, due to the high investment in key variables, it is difficult to achieve, so this group of scenarios is not the best solution. Scenario H\u2013L\u2013H\u2013L takes economic development as the core, reduces the input of nonrenewable resources to the minimum, and vigorously develops renewable resources, so that the proportion of renewable resources gradually increases, achieving the balanced development of economic efficiency and resource efficiency, and the ability of sustainable development gradually enhances. UEI and EISD reach 0.552\u20130.556 and 3.808\u20133.882 in 2025, which is the best scenario under economic preferences. Zhu et\u00a0al.

Scenarios M\u2013H\u2013H\u2013L and M\u2013H\u2013H\u2013M pay too much attention to the input of energy, and invest both nonrenewable and renewable resources to the biggest extent, resulting in the uncoordinated development of environmental efficiency and resource efficiency. UEI and EISD are only 0.508\u20130.530 and 3.423\u20133.668 in 2025, so they are not the appropriate choices. Scenario M\u2013M\u2013M\u2013L appropriately reduces energy input compared with the former, so that the environment, economy and resource development are relatively balanced. UEI and EISD rise to 0.529\u20130.532 and 3.600\u20133.666 in 2025, but the relatively mediocre design of various key variables leads to the inability to achieve the best sustainable indicators, so it is not the best choice. Scenarios M\u2013M\u2013H\u2013M and H\u2013M\u2013H\u2013H vigorously develop renewable resources, appropriately develop nonrenewable resources, and integrate environmental protection and economic development. The comprehensive and balanced design of key variables has achieved the best sustainable indicators. UEI and EISD are 0.540\u20130.543 and 3.669\u20133.779 in 2025, but scenario H\u2013M\u2013H\u2013H is difficult to achieve because of the high investment in key variables. Therefore, scenario M-M-H-M is the best scenario under energy preference. Mehmood et\u00a0al. (2022) believe that the best energy for sustainable development is renewable resources such as hydropower, solar energy and wind energy. Meanwhile, Feng et\u00a0al. (2019) believe that the economic development model of resource-based cities in China driven by energy, especially coal, is difficult to change for a long time, so nonrenewable resources are still important driving force for their economic development. They agree with scenario M\u2013M\u2013H\u2013M."

Scenario M\u2013H\u2013L\u2013H restricts the development speed of renewable resources on the basis of vigorously protecting the environment, and vigorously develops non- renewable resources. The uncoordinated development mode of environment and energy has made it the worst solution, UEI and EISD are only 0.508\u20130.510 and 3.412\u20133.472 in 2025. The proportion of nonrenewable resources input in scenarios M\u2013M\u2013L\u2013H and M\u2013H\u2013M\u2013H is higher than that of renewable resources. This traditional development model leads to poor sustainable indicators. UEI and EISD are only 0.518\u20130.522 and 3.504\u20133.567 in 2025, so they are not the best choices. Scenarios H\u2013M\u2013M\u2013H and M\u2013H\u2013H\u2013H integrate both energy and economic development on the premise of vigorously developing environmental protection, so that resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and economic efficiency have reached a relative balance. UEI and EISD reach 0.528\u20130.532 and 3.601\u20133.678 in 2025. However, the high input of various key variables makes it difficult to achieve, so they are not the optimal scenarios. Scenario M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H takes environmental protection as the core of development\n1 3\nand strictly restricts the development of nonrenewable resources. In order to achieve the most coordinated development of resources, environment, and economy, it simultaneously vigorously develops renewable resources and appropriately develops the economy. UEI and EISD reach 0.552\u20130.556 and 3.798\u20133.870 in 2025, which is the optimal scenario under environmental preferences. Liu et\u00a0 al. (2022) believe that it is necessary to appropriately slow down economic development, reduce the proportion of nonrenewable resources, vigorously develop renewable energy, and further improve the green low-carbon cycle system to achieve more sustainable development, which is consistent with the research conclusion of scenario M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H."

            "text": "By comparing and analyzing the appropriate scenarios under the above three preferences, the appropriate scenario M\u2013M\u2013H\u2013M under the energy preference is basically consistent with the research conclusion of Yu et\u00a0 al. (2015), that is, the core driving force of economic growth of resource-based cities lies in the development and processing of local mineral resources. However, this model pays too much attention to the input of nonrenewable resources. The research shows that (Li, 2020) the COVID-19 has led to unsustainable industry and production is not high enough in Shandong Province. Considering that Jining is a resource-based city relying mainly on industry, this will further restrict the output of nonrenewable resources, so it is difficult to implement this scheme. The suitable scenario H\u2013L\u2013H\u2013L under economic preferences does not integrate environmental protection while developing the economy. Sun et\u00a0al. (2021) believes that ignoring the protection of the ecological environment in the development process of resource-based cities will have an adverse impact on the subsequent economic development, thus affecting the sustainable development of the city. Therefore, the uncoordinated development of the economy and environment leads to the unsatisfactory result of this scheme. The core idea of M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H under environmental preferences is to reduce the investment of nonrenewable resources while doing a good job in environmental protection, and pay attention to the coordinated development of resources, economy and environment. According to the research results of Sun et\u00a0al. (2021), based on the assumption of not exceeding the ecological carrying capacity, we should reasonably formulate resource development planning, appropriately slow down economic development, and take environmental improvement as an important way for the development of resource-based cities. Only in this way can we achieve sustainable development. Therefore, the suitable scenario M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H is the best development model to improve the sustainable development ability of resource-based cities in the next planning year."

            "heading": "4 Conclusions",
            "text": "The innovative work and contributions of this article are mainly reflected in two aspects. First, in order to fully reflect the problems of resource-based cities such as \u201cirrational economic structure, high resource dependence and serious environmental pollution,\u201d the ecological efficiency index that can integrate economic efficiency, resource efficiency and environmental efficiency is selected as the emergy index reflecting the sustainable development of resource-based cities. Second, in order to reduce the uncertainty of the research results and overcome the disadvantage of using only sensitivity analysis to screen the key parameters in the past, we introduce the regression analysis model and couple it with sensitivity analysis to screen key variables, so that the selected key variables are more consistent with the development characteristics of resource-based cities, which increases the accuracy of the results of the scenario analysis.\nComparing the appropriate scenarios under three different preferences, the appropriate scenario M\u2013L\u2013H\u2013H under environmental preference takes environmental protection as the core of development, strictly restricts the development of non- renewable resources, vigorously develops renewable resources, and moderately develops the economy. Among them, the large input of renewable resources has not only made up for the lack of energy caused by the reduction of nonrenewable resources, but also maintained a moderate economic growth; In addition, due to the more scientific and green energy conversion (renewable resources replacing nonrenewable resources), the environmental protection has been further enhanced and the environmental development is more sustainable. This scenario truly achieves the coordinated development of resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and economic efficiency, making UEI and EISD increase to 0.552\u20130.556 and 3.798\u20133.870, respectively, in 2025, indicating this scenario is the best scheme to improve the sustainable development level of Jining. Based on this, it is suggested that the appropriate development ranges of the growth rate of social fixed assets investment, the growth rate of raw coal emergy, the growth rate of grain emergy and the reduction rate of solid waste emergy in Jining during the 14th Five-year Plan period are 17.5\u201318.3%, \u2212 4.0 to \u2212 3.2%, 1.8\u20132.6% and 4\u20134.8%. According to the design of parameters in the appropriate scenario, it is suggested that the focus of work should be directed to improve the environmental quality and optimize the adjustment of energy structure during the 14th Five-year Plan of Jining. First, a complete environmental protection governance system should be established, especially increasing investment in green infrastructure. Second, we should further increase the proportion of renewable resources, slow down the development of nonrenewable resources, transform traditional industries into new energy industries, and form a closed loop of nonrenewable resources from raw material reuse to recycling.\n1 3\nIn the scenario setting, the \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d modes of the regulatory factors are screened only by experts\u2019 consultation due to the lack of explicit requirements of the government during the development period of 14th Five-year Plan, which may lead to uncertainty of conclusions due to subjectivity. In addition, we hope the research method of \u201cemergy + system\u201d dynamics based on resource-based cities can attract the attention of relevant scholars, so that they can further expand and deepen in this field.\nAppendix\u00a01\nWith reference to the research results of Wang et\u00a0al., (2021a, 2021b), the emergy indexes are selected according to the flow of material, energy, currency and labor in Jining. Generally, emergy indexes are classified into the following five categories: local nonrenewable emergy, renewable emergy, input emergy, output emergy and waste emergy. The local nonrenewable emergy is the wealth base of systematic environmental nonrenewable resources, which is mainly composed of the emergy of topsoil loss, fossil fuels, metal resources, cement and other resources; Renewable emergy is the wealth base of systematic environmental renewable resources, which is mainly composed of renewable natural resource emergy (solar, rain, wind, earth cycle, etc.) and renewable product emergy (crops, livestock, aquatic products, etc.), wherein, in order to avoid the duplication of the earth\u2019s cycle energy, solar energy, rain water and wind energy in emergy calculation, we select the largest one of them as the representative of renewable natural resource emergy based on the research results of (Brown & Ulgiati, 2016). Input emergy is the resources and services imported from outside, mainly composed of imported goods and services and tourism income; Output emergy is the output resources and services, mainly composed of the emergy of exported goods and services. Waste emergy is the waste discharged to the environment from system, which is mainly composed of solid waste, waste water and waste gas. The total emergy is the sum of local nonrenewable emergy, renewable emergy and input emergy, representing the total emergy of the system.\nAbbreviations\nGemr Global emergy to money ratio Ece Earth

to the different types of emergy indexes established in the previous article, the system dynamics model is divided into economic, environmental, social and energy subsystems, and five different types of emergy evaluation indexes are also part of the corresponding subsystems. The specific division basis is as follows, and the division content is shown in Table 19.\nEconomic subsystem\nThe sources of GDP are divided into the primary industry output, the secondary industry output and the tertiary industry output. The calculation of the three industries output refers to Cobb Douglas production function. After determining the labor force and industry investment as independent variables, the multiple linear regression analysis is conducted on them in combination with the dependent variables to determine the functional relationship between the dependent variables and independent variables. The labor force is determined by the population and employment rate.\nSocial subsystem\nTake population as state variable, birth population and death population as rate variable, and birth rate and death rate as auxiliary variables. Different kinds of emergy resources are used as auxiliary variables (survival index and environmental pressure index) to influence the population.\nEnvironment subsystem\nDetermine the classification of waste emergy by querying the statistical yearbook, and divide it into solid waste emergy, waste water emergy and waste gas emergy. The emergy of waste water and waste gas are both divided into production and living parts. The production part is linked with GDP, and the living part is linked with the population, which enhances the integrity of the system.\nEnergy subsystem\nDetermine different energy classifications by querying the statistical yearbook, and divide it into renewable resources, nonrenewable resources, input resources and output resources. In order to highlight the characteristics of resource-based cities, the largest part of renewable and nonrenewable resources (grain and raw coal) will be extracted separately to pave the way for the subsequent scenario setting. The end point is the two sustainable indexes of UEI and EISD.\nSee Table\u00a019.\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 19\nVa\nria bl\ne se\nt o f e\nac h\nsu bs\nys te\nm\nVa ria\nbl e\nty pe\ns Ec\non om\nic su\nbs ys\nte m\nEn vi\nro nm\nen t s\nub sy\nste m\nSo ci\nal su\nbs ys\nte m\nEn er\ngy su\nbs ys\nte m\nSt at\ne va\nria bl\nes So\nci al\nfi xe\nd as\nse ts\nin ve\nstm en\nt So\nlid w\nas te\ne m\ner gy\nPo pu\nla tio\nn G\nra in\ne m\ner gy\nO ut\npu t r\nes ou\nrc es\nR aw\nc oa\nl e m\ner gy\nIn pu\nt e m\ner gy\nR at\ne va\nria bl\nes G\nro w\nth in\nso ci\nal fi\nxe d\nas se\nts in\nve st-\nm en\nt Re\ndu ct\nio n\nof so\nlid w\nas te\ne m\ner gy\nPo pu\nla tio\nn gr\now th\nG ro\nw th\nin in\npu t e\nm er gy Po pu la tio n re du ct io n G ro w th in o ut pu t r es ou\nrc es\nG ro\nw th\nin g\nra in\ne m\ner gy\nG ro\nw th\nin ra\nw c\noa l e\nm er gy A ux ili ar y va ria bl es Pr im ar y in du str y la bo r f or ce Pr od uc tio n w as te w at er e m er gy p er un it of G D P B irt h ra te G ro w th ra te o f i np ut e m\ner gy\nSe co\nnd ar\ny in\ndu str\ny la\nbo r f\nor ce\nPr od\nuc tio\nn w\nas te\ng as\ne m\ner gy\np er\nu ni t of G D P D\nea th\nra te\nG ro\nw th\nra te\no f o\nut pu\nt r es\nou rc\nes\nTe rti\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nla bo\nr f or\nce D\nom es\ntic w\nas te\nw at\ner e\nm er\ngy p\ner\nhe ad\nSu rv\niv al\nin de\nx G\nro w\nth ra\nte o\nf g ra\nin e\nm er\ngy\nPr op\nor tio\nn of\nin ve\nstm en\nt i n\npr im\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nD om\nes tic\nw as\nte g\nas e\nm er\ngy p\ner h\nea d\nEn vi\nro nm\nen ta\nl p re\nss ur\ne in\nde x\nG ro\nw th\nra te\no f r\naw c\noa l e\nm er\ngy\nPr op\nor tio\nn of\nin ve\nstm en\nt i n\nse co\nnd ar y in du str y Pr\nod uc\ntio n\nw as\nte w\nat er\ne m\ner gy\nEm pl\noy m\nen t r\nat es\nRe ne\nw ab\nle e\nm er\ngy e\nxc ep\nt g ra\nin\nPr op\nor tio\nn of\nin ve\nstm en\nt i n\nte rti\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nPr od\nuc tio\nn w\nas te\ng as\ne m\ner gy\nEm pl\noy ed\np op\nul at\nio n\nN on\nre ne\nw ab\nle e\nm er\ngy e\nxc ep\nt r aw\nc oa\nl\nIn ve\nstm en\nt i n\npr im\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nD om\nes tic\nw as\nte w\nat er\ne m\ner gy\nEm er\ngy p\ner h\nea d\nRe ne\nw ab\nle e\nm er gy In ve stm en t i n se co nd ar y in du str y D om es tic w as te g as e m er gy N on re ne w ab le e m\ner gy\nIn ve\nstm en\nt i n\nte rti\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nW as\nte w\nat er\ne m\ner gy\nO ut\npu t e\nm er gy Pr im ar y in du str y ou tp ut W as te g as e m er gy Ex ch an ge ra te\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 19\n( co\nnt in\nue d)\nVa ria\nbl e\nty pe\ns Ec\non om\nic su\nbs ys\nte m\nEn vi\nro nm\nen t s\nub sy\nste m\nSo ci\nal su\nbs ys\nte m\nEn er\ngy su\nbs ys\nte m\nSe co\nnd ar\ny in\ndu str\ny ou\ntp ut\nRe du\nct io\nn ra\nte o\nf s ol\nid w\nas te\ne m\ner gy\nTo ta\nl e m\ner gy\nTe rti\nar y\nin du\nstr y\nou tp\nut W\nas te\ne m\ner gy\nEm er\ngy in\nde x\nfo r s\nus ta\nin ab\nle d\nev el\nop -\nm en t Pr op or tio n of la bo r f or ce in p rim ar y in du str y W as te e m er gy to to ta l e m er gy ra tio Ec ol og\nic al\ne ffi\nci en\ncy in\nde x\nPr op\nor tio\nn of\nla bo\nr f or\nce in\nse co\nnd ar y in du str y Pr op or tio n of la bo r f or ce in te rti ar y in du str y G D P G ro w th ra te o f s oc ia l fi xe d as se t in ve stm en t Em er gy to m on ey ra tio\n1 3\nAppendix\u00a03\nThe following are all the equations required in the social subsystem: Population = Population\u2019 + Population growth -Population reduction. Population growth = Population \u00d7 Birth rate \u00d7 Survival index. Population reduction = Population \u00d7 Death rate \u00d7 Environmental pressure index. Employment rates = DELAY1I(0.503829 + 3.4e-05 \u00d7 GDP,1,0.545085). Employed population = Population \u00d7 Employment rates.
