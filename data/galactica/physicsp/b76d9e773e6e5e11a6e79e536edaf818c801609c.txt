Curcumin possesses a wide spectrum of liver cancer inhibition effects, yet it has chemical instability and poor metabolic properties as a drug candidate. To alleviate these problems, a series of new mono-carbonyl curcumin derivatives G1–G7 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Compound G2 was found to be the most potent derivative (IC50 = 15.39 μM) compared to curcumin (IC50 = 40.56 μM) by anti-proliferation assay. Subsequently, molecular docking, wound healing, transwell, JC-1 staining, and Western blotting experiments were performed, and it was found that compound G2 could suppress cell migration and induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and affecting the expression of apoptosisrelated proteins. Moreover, the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining results confirmed that compound G2 was more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tumor growth. Hence, G2 is a promising leading compound with the potential to be developed as a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma. 1. conclusions We assessed the biological activity of novel curcumin derivatives, designated as G1–G7, in an effort to find a leading molecule with strong anti-HCC activity. Remarkably, G2 exhibited more significant activity (IC50 = 15.39 µM) than curcumin (IC50 = 40.56 µM) via MTT assay in HepG2 cells. A series of pharmacological assays containing cell proliferation by clone formation assay, cell migration by wound healing and transwell assay, cell apoptosis by JC-1 staining, and the underlying mechanism were further explored by Western blot and molecular docking. The results showed that G2 exerted greater potential than curcumin against liver cancer in in vitro studies. Additionally, data from the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining suggested that the curcumin derivative G2 had a superior therapeutic impact on tumor development.
