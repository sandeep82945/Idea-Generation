 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine if increasing the dose and duration of the higher-order EF training leads to significant improvements in planning, problem-solving, and reasoning skills. The current study showed improved core EFs but not higher-order EFs, likely due to insufficient training time on higher-order EF tasks.

2. Investigate if adding parent/teacher training or coaching components to the intervention improves real-world executive functioning and transfers gains to daily life, as measured by rating scales like the BRIEF-2. The current study improved performance on lab-based EF tests but not daily EF.

3. Test the efficacy of this computerized EF training in younger children with CP to determine if earlier intervention leads to greater cognitive and functional gains. The current study was in 8-12 year olds.

4. Examine if this EF training results in improvements on academic outcomes for children with CP, such as reading, math, and writing skills. Academic skills rely heavily on underlying EF abilities. 

5. Conduct a follow-up study on the waitlist control group to assess maintenance of EF gains 9 months after they complete the training. The current study only followed the intervention group long-term.
