    "abstractText": "In this paper, a neural adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed for the integrated attitude and position control of spacecraft proximity operations in the presence of unknown parameters, disturbances, and actuator faults. The proposed controller is made up of a relative attitude control law and a relative position control law. Both the relative attitude control law and relative position control law are designed by adopting the neural networks (NNs) to approximate the upper bound of the lumped unknowns. Benefiting from the indirect neural approximation, the proposed controller does not need any model information for feedback. In addition, only two adaptive parameters are required for the indirect neural approximation, and the online calculation burden of the proposed controller is therefore significantly reduced. Lyapunov analysis shows that the overall closed-loop system is ultimately uniformly bounded. The proposed controller can ensure the relative attitude, angular velocity, position, and velocity stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. Lastly, the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed control scheme are confirmed by a simulated example.",

            "text": "Nowadays, with the rapid development of sensing and control technologies, space missions have become increasingly complicated. The spacecraft proximity operation plays an important role in various space missions, such as rendezvous and docking, active debris removal, and on-orbit servicing. The relative attitude and position control is a critical technique for spacecraft proximity operations. During the proximity operations, the chaser and target are inevitably affected by uncertain parameters and disturbances. Even worse, the parameters of the target may be fully unknown for noncooperative proximity operations. In addition, the chaser also frequently suffers from actuator faults due to the harsh space environment. The presence of unknown parameters, disturbances, and actuator faults bring great difficulty to the relative attitude and position control of spacecraft proximity operations. Traditionally, the spacecraft relative attitude and position control systems are often designed independently. However, the inherent couplings between the relative attitude and position are neglected in this way and these controllers cannot be directly applied to the spacecraft proximity operations, especially when high control accuracy is\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051726 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726 2 of 16\nrequired. The integrated attitude and position control based on the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) dynamic model of spacecraft proximity operations is an effective solution to this problem. Until recently, many relevant results have been reported for the integrated attitude and position control of spacecraft proximity operations. Singla et al. [1] designed a model reference adaptive output feedback control law for the spacecraft rendezvous and docking under measurement uncertainties. Kristiansen et al. [2] presented three nonlinear control solutions for the 6-DOF spacecraft coordination control based on the integrator backstepping and passivity-based control, respectively. In [3,4], an integrated nonlinear optimal control approach was developed for the spacecraft proximity operations. Zhang and Duan [5] proposed a robust adaptive backstepping control scheme for the integrated translational and rotational motion of spacecraft with actuator misalignment. In [6,7], several robust optimal sliding mode control methods were carried out for the coupled attitude and position maneuvers of spacecraft. Sun and Huo [8] designed a 6-DOF integrated adaptive backstepping controller for the spacecraft proximity operations under uncertainties. In [9,10], integrated robust adaptive control approaches were developed for the relative position tracking and attitude synchronization for spacecraft rendezvous. In [11,12], disturbance observer-based robust control approaches were proposed for the spacecraft proximity and docking with input saturation. Hu et al. [13] presented a robust fault-tolerant tracking control scheme for the spacecraft proximity operations by utilizing the adaptive sliding mode control technique. Wang and Ji [14] designed two backstepping control schemes for the relative motion control of spacecraft rendezvous based on the input-to-state stable property and finite-time control technique, respectively. In [15], an adaptive nonlinear state feedback control method was proposed for the fault-tolerant constrained pose control of cooperative spacecraft rendezvous and docking. Zhou et al. [16] developed an adaptive sliding mode method for the robust attitude and position tracking of spacecraft proximity operations by integrating with an unscented Kalman filter. In [17\u201319], several adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode control laws were designed for the fixed-time, 6-DOF tracking control of noncooperative spacecraft fly-around missions. In addition, there have been also some research studies concerned with 6-DOF integrated controls in spacecraft based on the dual quaternion representation [20\u201327]. It should be noted that most of the above controllers require prior knowledge of nominal model information for feedback. Nevertheless, the physical parameters of the chaser and the target may be fully unknown in some extreme cases. The intelligent approximation is an efficient tool to construct the model-free controllers, owing to the powerful learning capability of the neural network (NN) and fuzzy logic system. By adopting the NNs or fuzzy logic systems to approximate the lumped unknowns, the intelligent control does not need any model information for feedback. In [28,29], robust adaptive backstepping NN control strategies were presented for the spacecraft rendezvous and docking with input saturation. Sun et al. [30] developed an adaptive fuzzy backstepping controller for the pose tracking of spacecraft rendezvous and proximity maneuvers under uncertainties. However, all of the above intelligent controllers involve a large number of adaptive parameters, which restricts their applications in practical engineering, especially considering the onboard computer has limited online calculation capability. Motivated by the above discussions, this paper proposes a neural adaptive faulttolerant control scheme for the integrated attitude and position control of spacecraft proximity operations in the presence of unknown parameters, disturbances, and actuator faults. The proposed controller is made up of a relative attitude control law and a relative position control law. In comparison with most of the existing investigations, the main contributions of this research are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Both the relative attitude control law and relative position control law are designed by integrating with the neural approximation. Benefiting from this design, the proposed controller is model-free and strongly robust against the lumped unknowns in 6-DOF dynamics;\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726 3 of 16\n\u2022 Rather than the conventional intelligent approximation [28\u201330], in which the NNs and fuzzy logic systems are introduced to directly approximate the lumped unknowns, the indirect neural approximation is exploited in this paper by adopting the NNs to approximate the upper bound of the lumped unknowns. In this way, only two adaptive parameters are required for the indirect neural approximation, and the online calculation burden of the proposed controller is therefore significantly reduced; \u2022 Lyapunov analysis shows that the overall closed-loop system is ultimately uniformly bounded. The proposed controller can ensure that the relative attitude, angular velocity, position, and velocity stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the problem and gives some preliminaries. Section 3 introduces the control methodology and provides the Lyapunov analysis. Section 4 performs a simulated example. Lastly, Section 5 presents the main conclusions of this study."

From the 6-DOF dynamic model of spacecraft proximity operations (8) and (9), the relative translational motion of the target with respect to the chaser is heavily affected by the relative rotational motion due to the inherent coupling between the relative attitude and position.\n2.2.

(26)\nCombining with the definition of V1, it follows that the overall closed-loop system is ultimately uniformly bounded, and the error signals s1 and b\u0303\u03c4 can stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. Considering the definition of s1, this further implies that the relative attitude \u03c3e and angular velocity \u03c9e can stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. The proof of Theorem 1 is thus finished.\n3.3. Relative Position Control Design\nThen, consider the relative position subsystem described as (8) and (9). Introduce the following filtered error:\ns2 = ve + \u03b12re, (27)\nwhere \u03b12 > 0. Evaluating the time differentiation of s2 yields\nm . s2 = \u0393 f u f + \u03be f , (28)\nwhere \u03be\u03c4 = \u03b6\u03c4 + \u03b12(ve \u2212 S(\u03c9)re). Define the input variable Z f = [ \u03c3Te , \u03c9Te pTe , v T e ]T. By Lemma 1, the lumped uncertainty can be expressed as\n\u03be f = W \u2217T f \u03a6 f ( Z f ) + \u03b5 f ( Z f ) , (29)\nwhere W\u2217f \u2208 RN\u00d73 is the ideal RBFNN weight, \u03a6 f ( Z f ) \u2208 RN is the Gaussian basis\nfunction vector, \u03b5 f ( Z f ) \u2208 R3 is the approximation error satisfying \u2016\u03b5 f ( Z f ) \u2016 \u2264 \u03b5 f , \u03b5 f\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726 8 of 16\nis a positive constant, and N is the number of RBFNN nodes. Note that \u2016W\u2217f \u2016 \u2264 W f . Substituting it into (29) yields\n\u2016\u03be f \u2016 \u2264 \u2016W\u2217f \u2016\u2016\u03a6 f ( Z f ) \u2016+ \u2016\u03b5 f ( Z f ) \u2016\n\u2264 b f \u03a6 f , (30)\nwhere b f = max { W f , \u03b5 f } is an unknown constant, and \u03a6 f = \u2016\u03a6 f ( Z f ) \u2016+ 1 is a known function. Then, the relative position control law is designed as\nu f = \u2212k2s2 \u2212 \u03b72b\u0302 f \u03a62f s2, (31)\nwhere k2 > 0, \u03b72 > 0, and b\u0302 f is the estimation of b f . Moreover, the adaptive updating law is designed as\n. b\u0302 f = \u2212\u00b52b\u0302 f + \u03b72\u03a62f \u2016s f \u2016 2, (32)\nwhere \u00b52 > 0.\nTheorem 2. When the relative position control law (31) and the adaptive updating law (32) are employed to the relative position subsystem described as (8) and (9), the overall closed-loop system is ultimately uniformly bounded and the relative position re, and velocity ve can stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin.\nProof. Introduce the following Lyapunov function:\nV2 = 1 2 msT2 s2 + 1 2\u03b3 f min b\u03032f , (33)\nwhere \u03b3 f min = min { \u03b3 f 1, \u03b3 f 2, \u03b3 f 3 }\n, and b\u0303 f = b f \u2212 \u03b3 f minb\u0302 f denotes the estimation error of b f . Evaluating the time differentiation of V2 yields\n. V2 = msT2 . s2 \u2212 b\u0303 f . b\u0302 f = sT2 ( \u0393 f u f + \u03be f ) \u2212 b\u0303 f . b\u0302 f .\n(34)\nSubstituting the relative position control law (31) and the adaptive updating law (32), we have\n. V2 = sT2 ( \u0393 f ( \u2212k2s2 \u2212 \u03b72b\u0302 f \u03a62f s2 ) + \u03be f ) \u2212 b\u0303 f ( \u2212\u00b52b\u0302 f + \u03b72\u03a62f \u2016s f \u2016 2 )\n= \u2212\u03b3 f mink2\u2016s2\u20162 \u2212 \u03b72b f \u03a62f \u2016s2\u2016 2 + sT2 \u03be f + \u00b52b\u0303 f b\u0302 f .\n(35)\nConsider the following inequalities:\nsT2 \u03be f \u2264 b f \u03a6 f \u2016s2\u2016 2 \u2264 \u03b72b f \u03a62f \u2016s2\u2016\n2 + 1\n4\u03b72 , (36)\n\u00b52b\u0303 f b\u0302 f = \u00b52 \u03b3 f min b\u0303 f ( b f \u2212 b\u0303 f ) \u2264 \u00b52 2\u03b3 f min ( b2f \u2212 b\u0303 2 f ) . (37)\nSubstituting (36) and (37) into (35) yields\n. V2 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3 f mink2\u2016s2\u20162 \u2212\n\u00b52 2\u03b3 f min b\u03032f + 1 4\u03b72 + \u00b522\u03b3 f min b 2 f\n\u2264 \u2212\u03ba2V2 + \u03d12, (38)\nwhere \u03ba2 = min { 2\u03b3 f mink2 m , \u00b52 } and \u03d12 = 14\u03b72 + \u00b52 2\u03b3 f min b2f . Solving inequality (38), we further have\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726 9 of 16\nV2 \u2264 (\nV2(0)\u2212 \u03d12 \u03ba2\n) e\u2212\u03ba2t +\n\u03d12 \u03ba2 . (39)\nCombined with the definition of V2, it follows that the overall closed-loop system is ultimately uniformly bounded, and error signals s2 and b\u0303 f can stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. Considering the definition of s2, this further implies that the relative position re and velocity ve can stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. The proof of Theorem 2 is thus finished.\nRemark 2. In the conventional intelligent approximation [28\u201330], the NNs and fuzzy logic systems are introduced to directly approximate the lumped unknowns, and the number of the adaptive parameters is 2\u00d7 3N. Alternatively, the indirect neural approximation is exploited in this paper by adopting NNs to approximate the upper bound of the lumped unknowns. In this way, only two adaptive parameters, b\u0302\u03c4 and b\u0302 f , are required for the indirect neural approximation, and the online calculation burden of the proposed controller is therefore significantly reduced. Actually, the indirect neural approximation makes the proposed controller more suitable for practical engineering, especially considering the onboard computer has limited online calculation capability.\nRemark 3. According to Theorems 1 and 2, the proposed controller can ensure the relative attitude, angular velocity, position, and velocity stabilize into the small neighborhoods around the origin. From (26) and (39), it follows that the small neighborhoods around the origin are adjustable. If we set the parameters \u03b11, \u03b12, k1, and k2 as large as required, the small neighborhoods can be made sufficiently small.\nRemark 4. It is noteworthy that the RBFNN utilized for intelligent control in this paper can also be replaced by some other approximation tools, such as recurrent NNs, wavelet NNs, and fuzzy logic systems. Moreover, adaptive dynamic programming is an effective methodology for the optimal control of unknown nonlinear systems with the help of critic NNs [32\u201335]. Future investigation building on this research will focus on extending the present results by embedding them with an adaptive dynamic programming approach."

Relative position and velocity under the PD controller.\nFrom Figures 4, 5, 8 and 9, it is revealed that the steady-state relative errors under the PD controller are much larger than those under the proposed controller. Meanwhile, the PD controller has the obvious unexpected overshooting problem, which the proposed controller does not have. The proposed controller can achieve superior performance, even in the presence of unknown parameters, disturbances, and actuator faults. Nevertheless, the performance of the PD controller is relatively poor, due to the existence of lumped unknowns in 6-DOF dynamics. Benefiting from the indirect neural approximation, the proposed controller is robust against unknown parameters and disturbances and is also insensitive to actuator faults. Figures 6 and 10 reveal that the control torques and forces of the chaser can always satisfy the actuator saturation constraints during the spacecraft proximity operation. From Figure 7, it can be inferred that the two adaptive parameters are bounded and change with time smoothly.\nSensors 2022, 22, 1726 14 of 16\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 17\nFurthermore, some crucial indexes are introduced to quantitatively compare the per-\nformance between the proposed controller and the PD controller.

The total time for performance comparison is set as t = 120 s. The IAEs and ITAEs under the proposed controller are IAE\u03c3 = 3.64, IAE\u03c9 = 1.70, IAEr = 424.95, IAEv = 116.73, ITAE\u03c3 = 28.16, ITAE\u03c9 = 15.83, ITAEr = 4480.8, and ITAEv = 1265.6. By contrast, the IAEs and ITAEs under the PD controller are IAE\u03c3 = 3.75, IAE\u03c9 = 2.33, IAEr = 797.86, IAEv = 243.22, ITAE\u03c3 = 30.55, ITAE\u03c9 = 25.12, ITAEr = 13900, and ITAEv = 4695.2. It is not difficult to find that the IAEs and ITAEs under the PD controller are much larger than those under the proposed controller. This means that the proposed controller can achieve better steady-state and transient responses than the PD controller. In summary, the simulation results indicate that the proposed neural adaptive faulttolerant controller can realize superior performance and good uncertainty rejection capability, which guarantees the successful implementation of the spacecraft proximity operation."
