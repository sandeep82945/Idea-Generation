    "abstractText": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease. Around half of the population with ALS develop cognitive and/or behavioral impairment. Behavioral changes in persons with ALS are perceived as the strongest predictor of psychosocial distress among family caregivers. Interventions aiming to support family caregivers are emphasized as important in relation to reducing psychological distress among family caregivers. Successful healthcare interventions depend on the participants\u2019 acceptance of the intervention. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a new online palliative rehabilitation blended learning program (EMBRACE) for family caregivers of people with ALS and cognitive and/or behavioral impairments. Methods: A qualitative cross-sectional design using the theoretical framework of acceptability to evaluate acceptance of the intervention based on data collected through individual in-depth interviews and participant observations. Individual interviews were conducted in 10 participants post-intervention and participant observations were recorded during virtual group meetings among 12 participants. A deductive retrospective analysis was used to code both datasets in relation to the seven constructs of the theoretical framework of acceptability: affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy. The theory of sense of coherence by Antonovsky informed the development and design of the intervention and interviews. The study adheres to the COREQ (consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research) guidelines. Results: Within the seven constructs we found that affective attitude addressed the meaning and importance of peer support and focused on the participants\u2019 needs and challenges. Burden referred to technology challenges, time pressure, and frequent interruptions during meetings. Ethicality concerned transparency about personal experiences and the exposure of the affected relative. Intervention coherence referred to a shared destiny among participants when they shared stories. Opportunity costs primary concerned work-related costs. Perceived effectiveness referred to the usefulness and relevance of peer support and the meetings that brought up new ideas on how to approach \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Health Services Research (2022) 22:697 Background Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease that has prominent non-motor manifestations like cognitive and behavioral impairments [1]. The discussion of the ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)  continuum has been retold and are now described as two distinct entities [2]. Cognitive and behavioral impairments in ALS are associated with more rapid progression and poorer prognosis and risk of death that is 2 to 2.53 times higher than in unimpaired controls [3]. Cognitive, emotional, and psychological impairments in ALS may cause alterations in certain cognitive functions such as executive functions, verbal fluency, language, and verbal memory [4]. Moreover, impairments and abnormal and inappropriate behavior, like apathy, loss of manners, aggression, and being tactless, are not uncommon in persons with ALS with the cognitive/behavioral variant of FTD [5, 6]. Research shows that behavioral changes are the strongest predictor for psychosocial distress in family caregivers (hereafter caregivers) of people with ALS [7, 8]. Not only do the cognitive and behavioral impairments increase the burden and the anxiety on caregivers, but they also affect their well-being [9\u201311]. Caregivers of people with ALS and FTD provide care with a tremendous resilience, compassion, and devotion [12], which is why caregivers need individual timetargeted psychosocial support, containing education and management of challenging symptoms [13]. However, the burdened caregivers frequently refrain from seeking or accepting support due to the difficulty of balancing their personal time with their caregiving responsibilities [14, 15]. There is currently no cure for ALS or the cognitive/behavioral impairments, and two reviews on palliative care in motor neuron diseases (like ALS) therefore advocate for structured support of caregivers in the form of counseling, support groups, and a crisis management system (before and after death of their relative) [16, 17]. Caregivers of people with ALS are likely to experience greater psychological well-being and quality of life from combined psychoeducational support and mindfulness [18]. Similarly, active planning within a multidisciplinary care setting provides an avenue for caregivers of people with ALS and FTD to proactively cope with cognitive/ behavioral impairments that will induce improved care and reduce the risk of caregiver burnout [1]. A rehabilitation program for people with ALS and their caregivers has been shown to have a positive effect on the participants\u2019 incentive to understand the disease and benefit from peer support [19]. However, due to the heavy burden and demands caregiving of people with ALS and FTD places on the caregivers [13], it is important to take the caregivers\u2019 time into consideration by using videoconferencing [20]. Research suggests that blended care in the form of combined face-to-face and online healthcare can help bridge the gap between the need for support, information, and lack of time among caregivers of people with ALS [21]. However, some challenges remain because successful implementation of healthcare interventions depends on the recipients\u2019 acceptance of the intervention [22\u201324]. For recipients to adhere to the intervention and benefit from the improved clinical outcomes [22, 25], it is necessary to develop intervention programs that are accepted by caregivers of people with ALS and cognitive and/or behavioral impairments (PALS/Cis). Hence, we developed the EMBRACE intervention, a 4-month online program aimed at supporting the ability of caregivers of PALS/Cis to handle everyday challenges related to the care of PALS/Cis (Fig. 1). The aim of the present crosssectional study was to evaluate the acceptance of a new online palliative rehabilitation program (EMBRACE), a blended learning program developed for caregivers of PALS/Cis.",

Individual interviews were conducted in 10 participants post-intervention and participant observations were recorded during virtual group meetings among 12 participants. A deductive retrospective analysis was used to code both datasets in relation to the seven constructs of the theoretical framework of acceptability: affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy. The theory of sense of coherence by Antonovsky informed the development and design of the intervention and interviews. The study adheres to the COREQ (consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research) guidelines.\nResults: Within the seven constructs we found that affective attitude addressed the meaning and importance of peer support and focused on the participants\u2019 needs and challenges. Burden referred to technology challenges, time pressure, and frequent interruptions during meetings. Ethicality concerned transparency about personal experiences and the exposure of the affected relative. Intervention coherence referred to a shared destiny among participants when they shared stories. Opportunity costs primary concerned work-related costs. Perceived effectiveness referred to the usefulness and relevance of peer support and the meetings that brought up new ideas on how to approach\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease that has prominent non-motor manifestations like cognitive and behavioral impairments [1]. The discussion of the ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)\u00a0 continuum has been retold and are now described as two distinct entities [2]. Cognitive and behavioral impairments in ALS are associated with more rapid progression and poorer prognosis and risk of death that is 2 to 2.53 times higher than in unimpaired controls [3]. Cognitive, emotional, and psychological impairments in ALS may cause alterations in certain cognitive functions such as executive functions, verbal fluency, language, and verbal memory [4]. Moreover, impairments and abnormal and inappropriate behavior, like apathy, loss of manners, aggression, and being tactless, are not uncommon in persons with ALS with the cognitive/behavioral variant of FTD [5, 6].\nResearch shows that behavioral changes are the strongest predictor for psychosocial distress in family caregivers (hereafter caregivers) of people with ALS [7, 8]. Not only do the cognitive and behavioral impairments increase the burden and the anxiety on caregivers, but they also affect their well-being [9\u201311].\nCaregivers of people with ALS and FTD provide care with a tremendous resilience, compassion, and devotion [12], which is why caregivers need individual timetargeted psychosocial support, containing education and management of challenging symptoms [13]. However, the burdened caregivers frequently refrain from seeking or accepting support due to the difficulty of balancing their personal time with their caregiving responsibilities [14, 15]. There is currently no cure for ALS or the cognitive/behavioral impairments, and two reviews on palliative care in motor neuron diseases (like ALS) therefore advocate for structured support of caregivers in the form of counseling, support groups, and a crisis management system (before and after death of their relative) [16, 17]. Caregivers of people with ALS are likely to experience greater psychological well-being and quality of life from combined psychoeducational support and mindfulness\n[18]. Similarly, active planning within a multidisciplinary care setting provides an avenue for caregivers of people with ALS and FTD to proactively cope with cognitive/ behavioral impairments that will induce improved care and reduce the risk of caregiver burnout [1]. A rehabilitation program for people with ALS and their caregivers has been shown to have a positive effect on the participants\u2019 incentive to understand the disease and benefit from peer support [19]. However, due to the heavy burden and demands caregiving of people with ALS and FTD places on the caregivers [13], it is important to take the caregivers\u2019 time into consideration by using videoconferencing [20]. Research suggests that blended care in the form of combined face-to-face and online healthcare can help bridge the gap between the need for support, information, and lack of time among caregivers of people with ALS [21]. However, some challenges remain because successful implementation of healthcare interventions depends on the recipients\u2019 acceptance of the intervention [22\u201324]. For recipients to adhere to the intervention and benefit from the improved clinical outcomes [22, 25], it is necessary to develop intervention programs that are accepted by caregivers of people with ALS and cognitive and/or behavioral impairments (PALS/Cis). Hence, we developed the EMBRACE intervention, a 4-month online program aimed at supporting the ability of caregivers of PALS/Cis to handle everyday challenges related to the care of PALS/Cis (Fig.\u00a01). The aim of the present crosssectional study was to evaluate the acceptance of a new online palliative rehabilitation program (EMBRACE), a blended learning program developed for caregivers of PALS/Cis."

According to the updated\ncurrent and future challenges. Self-efficacy involved the motivation to learn more about ALS and ways to cope that were accommodated by the convenient online format.\nConclusions: The findings showed that the participants favored peer support and the videos that reduced feelings of loneliness and frustration but also confronted them and provided knowledge on future challenges. Further research should explore the benefits of the program and the meaning of online peer support among caregivers of people with ALS and cognitive and/or behavioral impairments.\nTrial registration: Retrospectively registered on November 20th, 2020. ID no. NCT04 638608. Keywords: Family caregiver; ALS; cognitive impairments, Behavioral changes, Support, Palliative rehabilitation, Acceptability, Intervention, E-health, Feasibility\nguidelines from the Medical Research Council, acceptability is important to address during the initial stage of the intervention development [30]. The TFA framework consists of seven constructs: affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy that were used to evaluate acceptability in a concurrent and retrospective view [27]. The TFA informed the development of an observation guide, the analysis, and writing up the findings based on the seven constructs [27]. The theory of sense of coherence guided the development and design of the intervention and interviews [29]. The theory focuses on three core components, comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness, that should be present in order to cope and experience life as coherent, thereby reducing stress [29]."

The study was embedded at the National Rehabilitation Center for Neuromuscular Diseases (RCFM) in Denmark [31]. RCFM is a national, highly specialized private outpatient hospital financed by the government, with rehabilitation services free of charge for its patients [31, 32]. RCFM offers highly specialized advice and counseling to persons with neuromuscular diseases, their families, health professionals, professional caregivers, and rehabilitation specialists [31]. Public neurological hospital departments refer about 95\u201397% of people with ALS to RCFM [31]. The professionals at RCFM are organized in multidisciplinary teams consisting of occupational and physiotherapists, nurses, doctors, psychologists, and social workers [31]. To provide rehabilitation on the patients\u2019 terms and to get as much insight into the patients\u2019 everyday lives as possible, most of palliative rehabilitation by the professionals at RCFM is performed in the homes of the persons with ALS [31]."

A 4-month online palliative rehabilitation blended learning program for family caregivers of people with ALS and cognitive and/or behavioral impairments. The intervention was facilitated by an experienced healthcare professional from the Danish National Rehabilitation Center for Neuromuscular Diseases, who is a registered nurse and certified family therapist with 15 years of experience working with persons with ALS and their families\ncaregivers of deceased PALS/Cis [33]. We developed and recorded 23 videos based on topics associated with caregivers\u2019 challenges and needs. The participants received a diary before starting the invention and were encouraged to take notes and write down their thoughts during the intervention. The participants were asked to make ecomaps three times during intervention as a means to explore potential supportive relations that could be beneficial during the disease-trajectory and after the death of the PALS/Cis. They were also offered customized Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction videos. The diary, ecomaps, and the mindfulness videos were not used as data. In addition to the empirical evidence and experience base, the theoretical lens of sense of coherence strengthened and targeted the content in EMBRACE to meet the caregivers\u2019 need for comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness [29]. EMBRACE consisted of three groups, each of which included 4\u20135 participants, facilitated by the third author. EMBRACE was developed and carried out by the first and third authors, who had extensive knowledge of the field under research due to working as healthcare professionals at RCFM. This team received regular professional group supervision during the delivery of the intervention."

A cutoff score \u2265 22 on the ALS-FTD-Q indicated mild behavioral change of the person with ALS [34]. Caregivers were encouraged to invite a relative to accompany them throughout the intervention. The companion could not be an affected relative. Two caregivers chose to invite an adult relative to accompany them.\nA two-step sampling process was performed for the intervention. First, healthcare professionals from RCFM helped identify persons with ALS referred to RCFM up to September 8, 2020, who met the first and second inclusion criteria. Next, invitations containing information about the intervention program and the research project were sent to persons with ALS and caregivers, 208 in total. Thirty-one caregivers contacted the first or third author, wishing to participate. The interested caregivers participated in screenings by phone where they scored\ntheir affected relative using the ALS-FTD-Q [34]. A total of 15 participants were included in the intervention (Fig.\u00a02). Participant observations during the interventions in 16 virtual group meetings were obtained from 12 of the 13 participants who started the intervention (11 partners and 1 adult child of a parent with ALS) (Table\u00a01). All 15 included participants were invited to participate in interviews about their expectations for EMBRACE prior to the intervention. Eleven of the 12 participants (including non-completers) were invited to participate in postinterviews (Fig.\u00a03). The person who was not invited had just lost a relative who had died of ALS. For this study, we draw on the post-interviews and participant observations. The inclusion for post-interviews was ongoing from September 14, 2020, to February 25, 2021. Ten caregivers out of 11 participated in post-interviews. One did not respond to the invitation."

Each of the 16 meetings lasted for around 2 h and were run with Microsoft Teams. Participant observations were carried out according to a predefined participant observation guide (Table\u00a02).\nThis evaluation focused on the execution process and retrospective experiences of acceptability to accentuate the participants\u2019 perceptions and experience of EMBRACE. Therefore, the pre-intervention interviews will be reported elsewhere. The post-interviews are reviewed in the present study. Interviews were carried out by the first author with the seven participants completing the intervention and three non-completers. Interviews with non-completers were carried out to learn about their reasons for withdrawing and potential barriers regarding acceptability. Nine interviews were generated online using Microsoft Teams, and one interview was conducted in-person at the caregiver\u2019s workplace. Interviews were carried out by the first author and were digitally recorded. Interviews lasted between 58 min and 1 h 41 min."

Although the participants had secluded themselves from their surroundings during meetings \u2013 in bedrooms, private offices, the workplace, a car, or children\u2019s or parents\u2019 houses \u2013 they were sometimes interrupted by phones\nringing, children entering the room, requests to assist the PALS/Cis, finding a charger for the computer, and having to change location in the home.\n\u201cAnd then again, with a poor internet connection, and then one thing happens after another. Well, and then there\u2019s just the thing about having my husband in the house, right?

Because of time pressure, the participants had difficulties giving priority to themselves and talked about finding it hard to settle down to participate in the meetings and watch the videos between the meetings.\n\u201cWell, at that point I thought that maybe an hour would be enough, because I actually felt exhausted. You had to be ready for it, and you had to compose yourself and find the time, and it had to fit into your daily schedule.\u201d (ID 2F).\nThe meetings were described as intense, which fatigued some participants, but on the other hand, they did not want to reduce the length of the meetings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to deal with such emotional themes for 45 min, and get everyone to say something. On the other hand, it\u2019s also extremely difficult to set two hours aside when you are at home with a sick spouse and a care team. Your presence is frequently required, so you must go back and forth during the meeting. You\u2019re interrupted.

However, this was difficult for one participant to relate to.\n\u201d It\u2019s been hard. Because members of my group were quite negative, and it drained my energy. I think they had a hard time finding something positive to say. And I couldn\u2019t relate to how they somehow wanted it to come to an end. It was a completely different world for me (giggles). Yes.

During meetings the participants shared details about private dilemmas and challenging situations even though it meant exposing themselves and their partners.

Because you have seen other group members who are at a more advanced stage of the disease and how they have handled it. However, we are all different\nand deal with such situations in different ways.

So, meeting others means a lot to me.\u201d (ID 2B).\nIn spite of difficult and sorrowful conversations and an initial lack of energy, participants said that they felt the meetings were invigorating; removed some of their burden, frustrations, and loneliness; and provided them with new ideas on how to approach current or future challenges.

Although I spoke very bluntly in that context, it was hard. It was hard for me to assess what was the right thing to say.

            "text": "This study sheds light on the acceptance of the EMBRACE intervention from the perspectives of caregivers of PALS/Cis. We found factors related to all constructs of the TFA, but some were more prominent than others. The discussion is structured according to the TFA constructs.\nRegarding affective attitude, the participants generally reported very positive experiences about participating in EMBRACE and for the opportunity to engage with peers. Our study showed that the participants made use of their peer\u2019s different perspectives regarding caring for a PALS/ Cis to prepare for future challenges. Similar findings were observed in a recent study on a psychoeducational intervention for persons with ALS and their caregivers [36]. They found that peer-support was one of the two main reasons for utility of the intervention [36]. In other studies, peer-support has been shown to lead to camaraderie, comparisons, and hope [37]. Comparisons with people who are dealing with things that are experienced as worse or more difficult than what ALS patients dealing with has further been demonstrated to be helpful for ALS-patients to feel better about themselves and their situation [37]. Trying to balance between handling everyday challenges and not knowing what will come next seemed to use up a lot of the participants\u2019 resources. This is in line with prior studies showing that caregivers face the conflict of trying to be prepared for the future while being overwhelmed by the issues of caring throughout the progression of the illness and coping with uncertainty [38, 39]. However, the participants in the present study embraced the stories from the more experienced participants despite this opening a potential black box regarding the later stages of the disease. Locock and Brown [37] found that some caregivers and ALS-patients chose isolation as a deliberate defense strategy to protect themselves from facing a potential future situation while others valued social interaction with peers. For our participants sharing thoughts\non hopes and sorrows with peers during group meetings broke down some of the barriers and fears concerning the future. A report on caregivers\u2019 preparation for the death of their relative found that caregivers were plagued with a guilty conscience when thinking about the future [38]. They found that caregivers might be cognitive and behaviorally prepared for the future but not emotionally, due to the situation of living with both hope and fear [38]. The participants in our study looked forward to the meetings and appreciated the focus on their needs and challenges, despite sometimes finding it difficult not to talk about the PALS/Cis. This might be because caregivers tend to regard their own needs as secondary compared to the needs of the PALS/Cis [15].\nBurden concerned the technology issues, caregiving responsibilities, and lack of time that affected the participants\u2019 attention toward the elements of the intervention. We found that the blended virtual format created an accessible opportunity for the caregivers to participate despite lack of time, intense meetings, and problems with the technology. Our findings on the benefits of using an online blended learning format showed that it enhanced accessibility and could perhaps bridge the gap between the needs of the caregivers and their lack of time due to caregiving responsibilities and practical tasks. In line with our findings, another study showed that accessibility of the support given was crucial for the increase in self-efficacy among caregivers of ALS-patients [21]. Our findings demonstrate that the participants prioritized attending the meetings because they felt related in a special way to the other group members, who understood their situation and meet their needs for support. Mazanderani et\u00a0al. (2012) also found that similarities in diagnosis was an important reason for valuing other\u2019s experiences as knowledge [40]. The use of social media has also been shown to increase the connection among caregivers of people with ALS, as well as their attendance and socialization [41]. The sense of distance that can occur between people when communicating through social media can furthermore for some people enable particular forms of computer-mediated distal empathy and still enable interactions and sharing of experiences with peers [40]. However, timely provision of problem-solving coping strategies is important to take into account when mitigating caregiver burden in PALS/Cis [1].\nEthicality was identified as dealing with feelings of guilt regarding the sharing of private challenges and exposing the PALS/Cis, but at the same time not wishing to be judged by peers. The participants placed themselves in vulnerable positions by being transparent about their everyday challenges. However, talking with peers about challenges and future concerns seemed to reduce feelings of guilt, which is consistent with a previous study\non caregivers of people with ALS [15]. The authors found that caregivers experienced cohesion when sharing personal experiences and tips with peers who understood their situation and what they were going through, which nobody else in their social network could [15]. Contrary to that study, participants in our study shared intimate challenges with peers, and did not feel that topics like these were too private to discuss [15].\nIntervention coherence concerned to what degree the participants found the topics relevant, useful, and empowering in relation to understanding and dealing with their personal challenges. To offer the participants knowledge on the disease, existential factors, resilience, and potential future challenges empowered them to change or moderate their interactions with the affected relative, which was also found in a previous report [18]. Effective caregiving requires that the caregivers receive emotional and practical support which allow them to better manage the different needs of their sick relatives, thereby reducing the overall burden and increasing empowerment [18]. Our study showed that the participants engaged with peers and supported each other in a way that family and friends were not able to do. Despite exposing a vulnerable side of oneself and risking potential tough comments from peers, the participants found the courage to speak up in order to receive advice and support. Reports confirm the benefits of peer support as encouraging mutuality and overcoming feelings of social isolation [42, 43]. We found that the participants were willing to open up and share concerns, which contradicts what De Witt et\u00a0 al. (2019) found in caregivers of people with ALS, where the majority of participants indicated that they would be passive partakers in group sessions and would only read the information and not share personal stories [15]. Studies show that being in the same situation as ALS-patients or caregivers was experienced as beneficial in relation to comparison of progression and challenges, but also confronting in terms of facing reality [19, 37]. A study illustrated that involvement in groups of carers or ALS-patients could change over time as they struggled with their changing needs and fears [37].\nOpportunity costs were related to how the participants had to give up work or study groups to participate and were not something that they paid a lot of attention to. This might be influenced by the setting in which the research was conducted, because in Denmark, health and social care is free of charge, and the participants therefore did not experience financial costs in relation to participation. In contrast, studies on caregivers of people with ALS have found that caregivers perceive the uncertainty about their financial futures as stressful, because care responsibilities often compete\nwith work and/or other family commitments [39, 44]. The majority of published studies stem from developed countries, and many studies do not take socioeconomic variables into account, like individuals wealth or national healthcare systems, which makes it difficult to extrapolate results to all countries [45].\nPerceived effectiveness concerned the participants\u2019 feeling that group meetings and peer support were invigorating, encouraged mutuality, and removed some of their burden, frustrations, and loneliness, providing them with ideas on how to approach and deal with challenges. The intervention thereby seemed to fulfill its purpose. However, a report by Weisser et\u00a0al. (2015)\u00a0shows that caregivers of people with ALS express a need to be encouraged to seek support, timely information, and education, based on personalized care, in order to foster resilience [46]. Nevertheless, we found that targeting information on cognitive and behavioral impairments not only offered an intimate and reflexive environment but was also useful to emphasize the shared destinies and to learn from peers. Caga et\u00a0 al. (2021) also found it particularly important to offer information on ALS and cognitive impairments and problem-solving strategies as part of supporting caregivers of PALS/Cis [1]. Our results showed that some participants found it beneficial to keep a diary during the intervention. Offering caregivers of critical ill persons a diary is important as a means to gain understanding and to cope, and it may also reduce post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression among caregivers [47].\nSelf-efficacy involved how the participants found it convenient and easy for them to participate. The blended learning format and the non-demanding participation seemed to be imperative to accommodate the heavily burdened participants who found it difficult to leave their relative at home alone. These findings are consistent with a previous report highlighting online services, like telehealth, as a way to support caregivers of people with ALS [48]. Telehealth in ALS is often well-received by caregivers, but finances and legislation may hinder telehealth implementation in ALS care [49]. Our results showed that the participants were motivated to learn more about the disease and how to deal with it, but that they found it difficult to assimilate knowledge due to stress, fatigue, and poor memory. However, a recent report showed that knowing too much about the disease trajectory could have a negative effect on caregivers\u2019 experience of burden [44]. Nevertheless, our study adds to the importance and meaning of gaining insight and knowledge from peers to understand and manage the diseases as a caregiver [19]. Our study also adds to the success of complimenting group-based peer support with psycho-educational interventions [50].\nOverall, the participants\u2019 acceptance of EMBRACE was related to the opportunity to meet and share experiences with peers, which is in line with the TFA\u2019s assumption that acceptability may impact the behavioral engagement in the intervention [27]."

            "text": "This study has several strengths. The TFA framework and the theory of Antonovsky proved useful for guiding the interviews, the intervention, and the analysis of data as the TFA offered pre-defined constructs to address a complex phenomenon as acceptability. This helped us design the intervention to increase the sense of coherence and reduce the stress of caregivers of PALS/Cis. The data triangulation of interview and observation data provided us with a rich and nuanced perspective of the participants\u2019 level of acceptance and thereby strengthened insights gained [35]. The participants were interviewed within two weeks after the intervention, which meant their experiences were still on top of their minds. It might have strengthened our findings if the participants were interviewed about their acceptance of the intervention during one of the group meetings, as it would have provided the participants with the opportunity to discuss, share, and elaborate on their perceptions of acceptance of EMBRACE. A potential limitation could be that we did not include the pre-interviews in the present study, which could have given insight into the participants\u2019 expectations regarding the EMBRACE intervention before enrollment. However, we aimed to evaluate the participants\u2019 acceptability of EMBRACE, not their perception of the intervention. Additionally, questions in the interview guide for the post-interviews were not fully analyzed in this study due to the deductive TFA analysis, which was used as an alternative to thematic analysis and could therefore have comprised the empirical data [51]. In the same way that the guide lacked specific TFA questions which might have revealed further perspectives on ethicality and opportunity costs, some constructs were only represented briefly and therefore perhaps not fully portrayed in the current study. However, by using the TFA in the analysis, we were able to access both enhancing as well as restraining issues regarding evaluation of the acceptance of EMBRACE [27].\nAs to representative credibility, the relatively small sampling of 12 participants reflects firsthand perspectives of 10 participants interviewed on acceptance of EMBRACE but with an overrepresentation of women\u2019s perspectives (Table\u00a0 1). However, the ratio of men to women with ALS is reported to be between 1 and 2 [52]. Most participants in the present study were between 51 and 67 years of age, and thereby represented the general family caregiver [52]. They represented the full trajectory\nof ALS, with experiences ranging from months to 14 years. Despite this sampling, there is always more to study, and according to Thorne, there are no such notion as data saturation [35].\nAccording to analytical logic and interpretive authority [35], the first author generated all the data while also being an \u201cinsider\u201d with experience of working within the research field. The fact that the first author played a central role before and after the intervention might have entailed the risk of the participants not speaking freely and honestly. The first author did, however, not facilitate the group meetings and therefore were not in direct contact with the participants during the intervention. Furthermore, none of the participants knew her beforehand and during the interviews, they did not hesitate to express pros and cons of their perception of EMBRACE. Finally, the \u201cinsider\u201d position made preunderstandings unavoidable which could have increased the risk of missing aspects or misinterpretations in relation to what an \u201coutsider\u201d would find [35]. However, to avoid these risks, the research team was a combination of researchers conducting the intervention and researchers who did not contribute to carrying out the intervention. Moreover, to reduce the risk of \u201cblind spots\u201d, we included an external health anthropologist in the research group, who performed the initial observations. In collaboration the whole team coded the participant observations along with scrutinizing data according to the TFA constructs. Interviews were coded by the first and fifth author and then discussed in the whole research team."

            "text": "This study evaluates the acceptance of the online palliative rehabilitation blended learning program, EMBRACE, from the perspectives of caregivers of PALS/Cis. Results indicate that the intervention supported caregivers of PALS/Cis in dealing with everyday challenges in relation to a PALS/Cis and reduced their experience of guilty conscience, fear, loneliness, uncertainties, and gave insights into ways of dealing with everyday challenges now and in the future that they could not have gained elsewhere. A special atmosphere in the group meetings fostered greater social connectedness and feelings of belonging to a group among the participants, thereby reducing feelings of loneliness. The results demonstrate facilitators as well as barriers to consider when offering targeted online group-based interventions for caregivers of PALS/Cis. Attention toward the participants\u2019 experience of affective attitude, burden, ethicality, opportunity costs, and self-efficacy should be especially considered when targeting caregiver support in order to develop an acceptable and useful supportive intervention. The use of the TFA helped identify issues within the seven constructs\nof acceptability that were useful for informing modifications in the design of EMBRACE. Future research should investigate the perceived impact from participating in EMBRACE and the effect of online peer-support for caregivers of PALS/Cis. Moreover, future studies should evaluate the EMBRACE intervention through a process evaluation, exploring contextual factors, implementation processes, and mechanisms of impact. Finally, it would be important to design an intervention for healthcare professionals to ALS-families as they experience decreased job satisfaction and are at risk of burn-out.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12913- 022- 07986-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01.\nAcknowledgements We thank all the family caregivers who offered their time and were so willing to share their experiences on everyday challenges and their evaluation of the EMBRACE intervention.
