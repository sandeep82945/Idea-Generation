    "abstractText": "A smart city is a city equipped with many sensors communicating with each other for different purposes. Cybersecurity and signal security are important in such cities, especially for airports and harbours. Any signal interference or attack on the navigation of autonomous vehicles and aircraft may lead to catastrophes and risks in people\u2019s lives. Therefore, it is of tremendous importance to develop wireless security networks for the localisation of any radio frequency interferer in smart cities. Time of arrival, angle of arrival, time-difference of arrivals, received signal strength and received signal strength difference (RSSD) are known observables used for the localisation of a signal interferer. Localisation means to estimate the coordinates of an interferer from some established monitoring stations and sensors receiving such measurements from an interferer. The main goal of this study is to optimise the geometric configuration of the monitoring stations using a desired dilution of precision and/or variance-covariance matrix (VCM) for the transmitter\u2019s location based on the RSSD. The required mathematical models are developed and applied to the Arlanda international airport of Sweden. Our numerical tests show that the same configuration is achieved based on dilution of precision and VCM criteria when the resolution of design is lower than 20 m in the presence of the same constraints. The choice of the pathloss exponent in the mathematical models of the RSSDs is not important for such low resolutions. Finally, optimisation based on the VCM is recommended because of its larger redundancy and flexibility in selecting different desired variances and covariances for the coordinates of the transmitter.",

            "text": "These days the world is experiencing global warming, and one of the ways of tackling this issue is to create smart cities and autonomous vehicles. A smart city is a city equipped with different types of active and passive sensors communicating with each other. Cyber and signal security are tremendously important to keep a smart city safe and prevent any cyber and signal attacks. This is even more important for autonomous vehicles and their navigation. Therefore, a smart city should be equipped well with security networks for the localisation of any signal interference device. In this article, the design of such a security network based on the received signal strength difference (RSSD) is presented. Two known types of signal interference are jamming and spoofing. The former means to transmit a signal into the same or near band as the satellite navigation band to disable navigation and spoofing stands for transmitting a fake signal [1]. Studies have shown that a simple and cheap spoofer can overtake for e.g., a ship navigation without being detected; see [2,3]. Since the power level of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signal is low, therefore, a weak interference signal can jam a receiver [1], see some real examples in [4\u201311]. Localisation of an interferer means estimating its coordinates in a pre-defined coordinate system. Some points with known coordinates, which are so-called anchor nodes or\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23031150 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 2 of 16\nmonitoring stations (MSs) have some sensors to receive information from the interferer. If the sensors can detect an interfering signal and measure its time of arrival (TOA), angle of arrival (AOA) or time difference of arrivals (TDOA) the interfering device can be localised. Numerous studies have been conducted for localisation based on these observables, e.g., see [12\u201314]. Another type of information, which can be received from the interferer is known as pathloss information such as received signal strength (RSS), RSSD, or received signal voltage. Thompson et al. [14] tested an outdoor localisation of a Wifi with unknown transmission power based on the RSS and concluded that in their 140 m2 test area the source can be localised with a root mean squares error of about 37 m. Thompson et al. [15] used automatic gain control [16] for the detection and estimation of jammer to noise of an interference and concluded that their method results in the capability of detecting jammer-to-noise ratios down to \u22128 dB. Wang and Inkol [17] developed an efficient algorithm for solving the nonlinear problem of localisation using the RSSD. Thompson et al. [18] developed the localisation procedure based on the RSS in the presence of ground reflection. Thompson [19] investigated the interference device detection and localisation by analysing the dilution of precision (DOP), from the RSS, TDOA and concluded that the TDOA is superior to the RSS. Bekcibasi and Tenruh [20] presented a method for increasing the accuracy of localisation based on the RSS and named it dynamic distance reference anchor method. Egenbr\u00e5ten [21] studied radio frequency emitter localisation based on the power difference of arrivals. Robertson et al. [22] performed a similar study on a Network of GNU Radio Sensors. Hu and Leus [23] presented a robust localisation method based on the RSSD and the semidefinite programming. Nystr\u00f6m [24] also studied the localisation of the GNSS interference using the RSSD. Zhou et al. [25] studied the error propagation for both mobile and target tracking and sensor node location calibration. Localisation using the RSS was also studied by Niu et al. [26] with focus on practical issues and solutions. Pu and You [27] proposed a location fingerprinting algorithm based on the general and weighted knearest neighbour algorithms to estimate the position of the target node using the RSS with an estimated position error of about 1.8 m. Li et al. [28] used the orientation compensation method and the RSSD for localisation and mentioned that their approach was effective in enhancing localisation that had multiple devices with three-dimensional orientation diversity. Wu et al. [29] presented a positioning approach based on linear regression of the AOA and the RSSD and showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve better accuracy than existing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) positioning approaches. Xu and Dogancay [30] suggested a method for estimating the optimal geometric configuration of sensors for the three-dimensional localisation of targets using RSS measurements. The proposed evaluation function has been solved using successive optimisation algorithms to obtain optimal positions of the sensors. Xu [31] investigated the optimal sensor placement strategy for single static target localisation using the hybrid RSS, AOA and TOA measurements on the two-dimensional plane. Lee et al. [32] proposed a hybrid localisation algorithm to boost the accuracy of range-based localisation; they replaced the ranging part of the rule-based localisation method with a deep regression model that uses data-driven learning with the dual-band RSS. Bo et al. [33] studied the configuration of sensors for the cooperative localisation of autonomous underwater vehicles using the RSS. Alanezi et al. [34] proposed a method to accurately determine the position and distance of the wireless sensors linked in a local network. The method utilises the RSS at the target node to identify its location in the localised grid system. The location of the MSs or in other words, their geometric configuration has a significant role in the quality of localisation. Xu [31] studied this issue for the hybrid RSS, AOA, and TOA, but Eshagh [35] applied quadratic optimisation with constraint for obtaining an optimal configuration for the MSs based on the AOA and the TDOA, and concluded the optimal design based on the TDOA is highly dependent on the geometric form of the area, and his efforts for design optimal configuration for the Landvetter airport of Sweden was not successful. However, in another study Eshagh [36] showed that optimisation can\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 3 of 16\nbe performed without problem if the area is close to a square and applied to the Arlanda International airport in Sweden. This study aims to develop a method, provide all mathematical tools, and show how to apply them for the optimal design of a wireless localisation security network based on the RSSDs from a signal interference device. To do so, a configuration of a four-MS localisation network is considered and optimised using the predefined variance-covariance matrix (VCM) or the dilution of precision (DOP) for the coordinates of all nodes of a grid covering a study area. In addition, this paper shows that simply by selecting a suitable place for the MSs, the quality of localisation can significantly be improved without any extra cost. In Section 2, the principle of the RSSD is presented, and after that, in Section 3 the problem of localisation using the RSSD is provided. Section 4 deals with mathematical developments of the optimisation criteria VCM and DOP for a localisation network based on the RSSD. Section 5 discusses the optimisation model and the required limiting constraints. In Section 6, the presented design method is applied to the Arlanda international airport in Sweden."

            "text": "RSS depends on how long the signal has been on its way to the receiver, in other words, the distance from the transmitter. This RSS (Pr) has the following mathematical formula [17]:\nPr = A(ht, hr, f )\nd\u03b3 Pt (1)\nwhere Pt is the signal strength at the transmitter, A(ht, hr, f ) is a parameter, which depends on the transmitter and receiver antenna\u2019s heights ht and hr and frequency of the radio signal f. \u03b3 is called pathloss exponent and d is the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In a two-dimensional network, the following well-known relation between the Cartesian coordinates of the transmitter and receiver exists:\nd = [ (x\u2212 xi)2 + (y\u2212 yi)2 ] 1 2 (2)\nwhere (x, y) are the coordinates of the transmitter and (xi, yi) those of the ith MS with the receiver. By taking logarithm from both sides of Equation (1), the known equation of the RSS is derived e.g., [17]:\n\u2126 = 10 log10(Pr) = 10 log10(A(ht, hr, f )Pt)\u2212 10\u03b3 log10(d) = C\u2212 10\u03b3 log10(d) (3)\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Equation (3) can be a constant, because Pt, f, and ht are constant and if hr is specified in such a way that all antennas have the same height. There are two points regarding the localisation process using Equation (3). First, C is unknown, and second, \u03b3 is also unknown and dependent on the environment. In practice, our goal is to estimate the coordinates of an interfering transmitter, which sends no information about its signal power and antenna\u2019s height. In a two-dimensional localisation problem, at least, two equations are required for estimating the x- and y-coordinate of the transmitter if the parameters C and \u03b3 are known; otherwise, four equations, or MSs, are needed to simultaneously estimate the coordinates with C and \u03b3. An alternative way is to perform the localisation process in two steps. The first, known as calibration, is to estimate C and \u03b3 with from a priori RSS measurements over the study area. In the second step, the estimated C and \u03b3 are used and considered as constants for the RSS mathematical model (3) and the localisation process is conducted. By writing a differential from of Equation (3), the mathematical model of the RSSD is obtained, which is the difference between the RSSs at the MSs i and j (see e.g., [20] or [17]):\n\u2126ij = 10\u03b3 log10 ( di dj ) = 5\u03b3 log10 ( (x\u2212 xi)2 + (y\u2212 yi)2( x\u2212 xj )2 + ( y\u2212 yj )2 )\n(4)\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 4 of 16\nAs Equation (4) shows, the RSSD is a function of coordinates of the MSs i and j and the transmitter in addition to \u03b3. Here, \u03b3 can be also estimated with the coordinates of the transmitter if at least three RSSDs are measured from three MSs. Some closed-form solutions for localisation using the RSSD with three and four MSs are available in [37]. Generally, \u03b3 ranges between 1 and 6 [20]; \u03b3 = 2 is used for a free space, and \u03b3 = 4 for a flat environment. It varies between 4 and 6 for indoor environments and in some cases, such as tunnels, it is less than 2."

            "text": "For designing or analysing a localisation network a grid of points covering the study area is designed, where each node of the grid is a representative of the probable location of the interfering transmitter. A local coordinate system is simply defined for this grid, e.g., the node in the lowest left corner of the grid can be considered as the origin, and based on the area, the orientation of the grid can be specified. By such definitions, the coordinates of the nodes are derived according to the grid resolution. The transmitter is located amongst these nodes in the localisation process; see [35,36] Generally, for computing the VCMs of these nodes, the coordinates of the MSs are needed. The initial coordinates for these stations are specified in the defined local coordinate system. Therefore, many A matrices, created between the MSs and nodes, are computed solely from their coordinates, and therefore the VCMs from A matrices; see Equation (10). The total number of VCMs is equal to the number of grid nodes. Each VCM is a tool connecting the configuration, created between the transmitter and the MSs, to the quality of the estimated coordinates for the transmitter. This means that by varying the coordinates of the MSs the quality of the transmitter coordinates changes. In a two-dimensional network, each VCM has four elements, two variances as diagonal and two equal covariances as off-diagonal. The desired VCMs or the square root of their traces (DOPs) for the nodes, can be regarded as two criteria for the optimisation of the network. In fact, the coordinates of the MSs vary until the estimated VCMs or DOPs are fitted to the desired ones. In the following subsections, the mathematical models of these criteria and their relationship with the coordinates of the MSs are presented.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 6 of 16"

            "text": "The expanded VCM and DOP by the Taylor series, Equations (12) and (22), are our mathematical models for optimal estimation of updates to the coordinates of the MSs. On the left-hand side of these equations, the desired VCMs and DOPs are, and their right-hand sides are computed from the coordinates of a node and the initial coordinates of the MSs. The estimated initial VCMs and DOPs do not have a good fit for the desired ones, therefore, by changing the coordinates of the MSs using quadratic optimisation, we try to fit them. It is important to note that the number of unknowns, or the coordinate updates, depends on the number of the MSs. Since four MSs are used in this study, then, the number of unknowns becomes eight as the network is two-dimensional. Each VCM has four elements meaning that four equations are created for one node. Such a system is under-determined, and more equations are needed to solve the system. By adding the VCM of another node, the number of equations increases by four. Consequently, considering each extra node leads to four additional equations in the system. As mentioned before, a grid of nodes, covering the area, is designed in the earliest stage where the resolution and size of the area specify the number of nodes. In short, there are many nodes over the area and the number of equations is four times larger than the number of nodes. Therefore, there is enough redundancy for optimisation.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 8 of 16\nThe situation is rather similar for optimisation based on DOP with only one difference. For each node, only one DOP is defined, and the number of equations is equal to the number of nodes. The system of equations is not as redundant as that one based on the VCM, but both have enough redundancies.\nLet us present the overdetermined system in the following Gauss-Markov form:\nBk\u2206x = \u2206Lk \u2212 \u03b5k where k = VCM or DOP (24)\nwhere \u2206x stands for the MSs\u2019 coordinate updates\n\u2206x = [ \u2206xM \u2206yM \u2206xN \u2206yN \u2206xO \u2206yO \u2206xP \u2206yP ]T (25) \u03b5k is the vector of residuals, and \u2206Lk the vector of differences between the elements\nof the criterion and initial VCMs or their DOPs, Bk stands for the coefficient\u2019s matrix containing the partial derivatives of the VCM, or DOP with respect to the MSs\u2019 coordinates.

The goal is to optimally design a four-MS interference localisation network on the runways. The VCM and DOP criteria are defined and applied to optimise the geometric configuration of MSs. After that the resolution and precision are presented and discussed. We consider rectangular search areas around each MS; see Figure 1. As the figure shows a two-dimensional coordinates system is defined with an origin outside the airport in the south-west part of the area with the geodetic coordinates of \u03d5 = 59\u25e637\u203210\u2032\u2032 and \u03bb = 17\u25e653\u203250\u2032\u2032. The y-axis is parallel to the western runway having an azimuth of 10\u25e6, and the x-axis is perpendicular to the y-axis with an azimuth of 100\u25e6. The updates to the x-coordinates of M, N and O are estimated in such a way that these points move \u00b1250 m from their initial values according to the width of the runways. yM, yN and yO are limited, respectively, between \u22122000 to 500 m, +1000 and \u22122000 m, +1000 and \u22122000 m. xP is limited between \u22121000 and 1000 m, and yP between \u2212500 and 500 m.

As seen in Table 1, xM, xN and xO do not change by the resolutions, criteria and \u03b3 because M, N and O are in the northward runways of the airport, almost parallel to the y-axis of the defined coordinate system. The directional constraints (31) keep the movements of the MSs along these runways, therefore, it is normal to see no change in their x-coordinates but large changes in the y-coordinates. From Table 1, based on both the VCM and DOP criteria, the optimised coordinates do not show any sensitivity to the choice of \u03b3 for the resolutions 40 and 80 m. For the resolution 20 m with the DOP criterion the optimal coordinates are not significantly different for the selected pathloss exponents. For the VCM criterion, the optimal results are the same for \u03b3 = 4 and 6.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 11 of 16\nGenerally, we can conclude that lower resolutions than 40 m and \u03b3 have no significant influence on the optimal coordinates. For the resolution 20 m and higher in the free space \u03b3 = 2, the results are different. Table 2 illustrates the statistics of the DOP values before and after optimisation for \u03b3 = 2, 4 and 6 and the resolutions of 10, 20 and 40 m. The chosen value for \u03b3 has a significant influence on the DOP of the network. Convergence is important in any optimisation process and in the optimisation of a security network for localisation, having a convergent solution is not straightforward. In addition, expecting convergence for any selected values for the VCM or DOP criterion is neither logical nor realistic. For example, selecting the minimum DOP of the initial design is not realistic and the optimisation process diverges. The statistics of the initial DOPs are indicators of the right choice of criterion values. In our study, selecting the mean value of the initial DOP and optimising the network based on that in all three values of \u03b3 leads to convergence. According to Table 2, when \u03b3 = 2, the mean DOP is 4.8, this means that the network is optimised by changing the positions of the MSs in such a way that the DOPs are fitted to 4.8. The mean DOPs are 2.4 and 1.6, respectively, for \u03b3 = 4 and 6. A diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to the square of the mean DOP is considered the VCM criterion for all nodes. The VCM criterion, as shown in Section 4.1, is the expected VCM for all points, and the DOP criterion is the square root of a trace of this VCM. As Table 2 shows, the statistics are almost the same for both chosen criteria, the reason is that in both cases the DOP of the network is presented. However, when the DOP criterion is used, there is no control over the covariances between the estimated coordinates. In addition, for each point, four equations are created in the system when the VCM criterion is applied but only one equation when the DOP criterion is utilised. Therefore, the VCM criterion adds a larger number of equations, considers covariances, and has the possibility of selecting a special structure for the VCM. For example, two different values for the variances of the x- and y-coordinates can be selected, as well as any correlation between coordinates, if required.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 12 of 16\nTable 2.

In other words, the process needs a large number of iterations to converge. In this study, when the norm of the coordinate updates becomes less than 1 m, the iteration is stopped. Considering smaller values is also possible but with the costs of many iterations and lower convergence rate. By assuming that the Arlanda international airport is flat, we select \u03b3 = 4. Figure 2 is the map of the initial DOPs of the network with the locations of the MSs M, N, O and P. The maximum DOP reaches 15, and the large values are along an ellipse form going through the MSs. Most of these large values are outside the airport and in the surrounding forests, except those between stations N and O. Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 17\nFigure 3.

A significant reduction is observed in the DOP values and as Table 2 shows, the maximum reaches 4. The stations M moved slightly northward and N southward and both along the specified azimuth of 10\u25e6. Point O is located at the northern part of the runway and P with slight displacement along the runway.

Again, large values are seen along an ellipse passing through the MSs. The DOP values are significantly reduced so that their maximum does not exceed 4. Station M is in the northern part of the runway, and N is moved to the most southern part of it. P and Q are found closer to the middle of their runways. A comparison of Figure 2, which is the map of the DOP of the initial design, and Figures 3 and 4, shows that the optimisation process is successful, because a maximum DOP of 15 in the initial design reduces to 4 in both optimal designs. Figures 2\u20134 show ellipse forms for the large DOPs passing through the four MSs, but with different sizes and orientations because the optimal positions of the MSs are not the same. Figure 2 shows large DOPs, reaching 15, from the station P towards Q and M, and smaller values, about 6, between M and N; see Figure 2, but after optimisation using the VCM criterion, these values decrease to 4 and even smaller around Q; see Figure 3. However, Figure 4 shows values around 4 amongst all MSs and the map is more symmetric compared to the map presented in Figure 3. Interestingly, Figure 4 shows small values of DOP over the buildings in the area unlike Figures 2 and 3, but this is accidental. If the goal of optimisation is to have small DOPs over buildings, the optimisation criterion can be designed specifically for this purpose.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 14 of 16Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 17\nFigure 4.

Concluding Remarks In this paper, the received signal strength differences (RSSDs) were used as observables and a localisation network was optimally designed based on the variance-covariance matrix (VCM) and dilution of precision (DOP) criteria. All mathematical derivations and formulae required for optimal design based on the RSSDs, these criteria, and the required constraints were developed and successfully applied for designing an optimal wireless localisation network for the Arlanda international airport of Sweden. The pathloss exponent (\u03b3) of the RSSDs showed no significant effect on the final optimal coordinates of the monitoring stations (MSs) for lower resolutions than 20 \u00d7 20 m. In addition, no significant difference was observed in these optimal coordinates based on the VCM and DOP criteria and applying the same directional and search area constraints. For the case of using \u03b3 = 2, considering localisation in a free space, and higher resolution different optimal coordinates were observed. The statistics of the DOPs after optimisation for different resolutions and criteria were almost the same for each, but not their maps. These maps were different over the Arlanda international airport for \u03b3 = 4, even if the optimal coordinates are the\nFigure 4.

This could be because of the higher redundancy of the system and considering zero covariances when the VCM criterion was applied. This criterion was more suitable because of higher redundancy in the optimisation, and flexibility of considering more information. The correlations amongst the RSSDs and different values for variances for x- and y-coordinates could be counted but such a possibility did not exist for the DOP criterion.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Stat me t: Not applicable.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1150 15 of 16"
