    "abstractText": "This paper suggests an index-matrix approach to a knapsack-based portfolio selection model (E-IFKP) with parameters, characterized by elliptic intuitionistic fuzzy values. Elliptic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets are a tool to model the greater uncertainty of the environment, which is introduced in 2021. In the developed E-IFKP model, the price and the return value of the assets are determined by experts taking into account their rank. Three scenarios are proposed to the decision maker for the final choice pessimistic, optimistic, and average. The proposed E-IFKP extends the dynamic programming approach for the Knapsack problem, which aims to select items to be placed in the knapsack to achieve the highest possible total value not exceeding its capacity. To determine the best option for an EIFKP for certain data from the US stock exchange a software for conducting the proposed approach is developed and is used in the case study.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nT HE GOAL of the portfolio selection problem is to select the assets that will receive the most value from the limited resources that are available [37]. Markowitz [27], who introduced the mean-variance model and treated asset returns as random variables in the multivariate normal distribution, laid the groundwork for portfolio selection. That model defines efficient portfolios as those that maximize expected return for a given level of risk or those that minimize risk for a given level of expected return. The Markowitz portfolio selection theory and the related methods require a large amount of time sequence data. That data is required to create the statistical indices that serve as the foundation for these methods. Despite its many benefits, Markowitz\u2019s model has drawn criticism since it fails to take into account many other factors besides risk and return [50]. Over the past few decades, numerous Markowitz\u2019s model extensions have been created [58].\nAccording to [57], historical data is either unavailable or insufficiently detailed to predict how the market will evolve in the real world. As a result, another option might be to review\nWork on Sect. I and Sect. II is supported by the Asen Zlatarov University through project Ref. No. NIX-482/2023 \u201cModeling Management Decisions with New Analysis\". Work on Sect. III and Sect. IV is supported by the Asen Zlatarov University through project Ref. No. NIX-486/2023 \u201cApplication of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic in Decision Making\u201d.\nfinancial reports and the opinions of experts and/or investor preferences. Making decisions in the real financial market is frequently complicated and unclear, which is another issue. In order to take into account the actual state of the financial markets in portfolio selection models, numerous ways based on uncertain conditions have been created. These include a robust-based approach in [18], a scenario-based approach in [35], and fuzzy methods in [42], [43]. The developed theory of fuzzy logic [56] is a useful tool for working with incomplete or ambiguous information. The essential idea is to transform linguistic variables into fuzzy sets (FSs) using the appropriate membership functions [58]. It is suggested that fuzzy portfolio selection take into account the expertise of professionals, the subjective opinions of investors, or quantitative and qualitative analysis in portfolio selection challenges. Fuzzy portfolio models are another type of potential method for resolving non-probabilistic portfolio selection because the investment behaviors to new economic events cannot be precisely evaluated by the prior return rates for the selected securities due to the exclusion of many factors in the portfolio selection process. In [17], [26], [55], the objective is to maximize the fuzzy return rates while limiting the maximum investment risk by employing possibility theory, which was modeled and researched for the portfolio choice problem. Theories of possibility or believability that lead to the best selections in a fuzzy portfolio selection can be used to summarize the key studies in fuzzy portfolio models. The development of multiobjective risk measurements and fuzzy portfolio selection evaluations are presented in [30]. The entropy method is used in [55] to formulate a weighted possibility fuzzy multiobjective and higher order moment portfolio model with the efficiency and effectiveness portfolio selections. Two fuzzyAHP approaches for portfolio selection in the Istanbul Stock Exchange are performed and compared in [43]. The capital gain tax to fuzzy portfolio selection is taken into consideration in [16] and formulated as a bi-objective mean-variance problem that is solved by a time-varying numerical integralbased particle swarm optimization algorithm. By constructing the evolutionary algorithm and fuzzy simulation approach to\n\u00a92023, PTI 329 Thematic track: Computational Optimization\ndemonstrate the efficient algorithm, a skewness fuzzy variable is employed in in [24] to formulate a mean-variance-skewness fuzzy portfolio selection. In order to differentiate between three different types of risk behaviors for investors, a fuzzy portfolio selection for dealing with qualitative information that is represented as hesitant fuzzy elements is suggested in [58]. A fascinating subject in the study of fuzzy portfolio selections, according to [31], is the risk behavior analysis for investors. In [49], the proposed threshold of excess investment for each security in the portfolio selection is the assured return rate. A fuzzy analytic network technique is employed for portfolio selection [37], and a great deal of other criteria other than risk and return are studied. According to [34], there are several financial applications for fuzzy logic, including portfolio optimization. Multi-objective linear programming is created in study [54] for portfolio selection in a fuzzy environment. The model, based on the investor\u2019s risk behavior in a dimension that is different from the gap between the guaranteed return rate and the return rate for each security, is suggested in [11]. According to [21], where the mean-variance model was used for portfolio selection and the risk the behavior of an investor in a different dimension distance for shortage investment and the excess investment was still not taken into account, the adjustable security proportion for excess investment and shortage investment based on the selected guaranteed return rates for profitable returns is suggested. The dimension of excess investment has been taken into consideration as the fuzzy portfolio based on guaranteed return rates has been developed for investors with various risk preferences [10]. According to Gorzaczany [19], since decision-makers aren\u2019t always able to accurately explain an element\u2019s degree of membership, formal representations of fuzzy sets are usually insufficient. There is often a degree of hesitancy between membership and non-membership in real-world issues since decision-makers frequently express their thoughts even when they are unsure of them [53]. Fuzzy set extensions are needed to address this problem. In [1], Atanassov has proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) as an extension of FSs. The difference between FS and IFS is that the elements of the latter sets have a degree of hesitancy, which complements the corresponding sum of the element membership and nonmembership degrees to 1. In [52] are described as other \u201cextensions\u201d of the IFSs and these extensions of IFS have been compared with themselves. The authors of [52] have demonstrated that IFS can completely describe a Hesitant Fuzzy Set [44]. In [52], the authors also prove that the Picture fuzzy sets [12], the Cubic set [25], the Neutrosophic fuzzy sets [40] and the Support-intuitionistic fuzzy sets [33] are representable by interval-valued IFSs (IVIFSs) [8]. In recent years, two more generalizations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets have appeared in the form of circular [4], and elliptic IFSs [5], which also generalize interval-valued IFSs. The ultimate goal of an intuitionistic fuzzy interactive multi-objective optimization approach is to find the optimum solution that maximizes satisfaction and minimizes unhappiness, according to [36]. Interactive optimization techniques\u2019 primary objective is to actively involve the decision-maker in problem-solving. A socially responsible portfolio selection problem is solved in [20] utilizing an interactive triangular intuitionistic fuzzy approach. A portfolio selection model built on the knapsack problem with interval uncertainty is provided in the study [51]. It is suggested that the created model, which is based on the knapsack problem (KP), can be used to appropriately allocate the number of shares to various assets and may be able to determine the best asset allocation under unique circumstances involving relatively high stock values. In this regard, our efforts are to develop an extension of the portfolio selection problem so that it can be applied to IF data and then to circular and elliptic IFSs. In our previous works [45], [46], we for the first time have suggested IF and circular IF KP (C-IFKP) for finding the optimal solution respectively of the IF and circular IF portfolio selection problem. The main parameters in the problems are IF pairs or circular IF triples, determined by experts under three different scenarios - pessimistic, optimistic, and average. E-IFSs are described as sets with an ellipse indicating the degrees of membership and non-membership for each element of the universe [5]. No developed models for optimal portfolio selection with elliptic IF data were found in the Scopus database. The index-matrix method to an elliptic knapsack-based portfolio selection model (E-IFKP), which extends the Circular IFKP and IFKP approach from the studies [46], is introduced here. Experts agree on the importance, cost, and return of each asset, and the suggested approach takes these ratings into account. Pessimistic, optimistic, and average scenarios are put out to the decision-maker for consideration before making a final decision. Software for carrying out the suggested E-IFKP is under development and utilized in the real case at a specific time to find the best alternative for an E-IFKP for specific data at a specific moment from the US stock exchange. The advantage of this model is that it can be applied to both plain and elliptic IF data. Another advantage is that it can easily be extended so that it can be applied to multidimensional IF data. Theoretical Contributions of the study are: the introduced definition of elliptic IF quads; extended comparison operations and relations on IF pairs to those on elliptic IF quads. The Knapsack problem\u2019s (KP) goal is to maximize the total utility value of all things selected by the decisionmaker within the constraints of a knapsack [28]. The phrase \u201cKnapsack problem\u201d first appeared in early publications by George Dantzig in the 1950s [13]. Gilmore and Gomory examined the dynamic programming method to the KP in 1966 [15]. An approximation approach for the solution of a multiple choice fuzzy KP (FKP) is provided in [22]. Ant colony optimization with environmental changes is developed in [32]. The paper presents one kind of FKP [38]. A dynamic programming strategy has been provided in [9], [38], [39] for solving FKP. In the work [14], an approach for ant colonies to optimize the Multiple-Constraint Knapsack Problem utilizing intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) pheromone updating is described. The idea of the E-IFKP and its usage for the portfolio selection problem according to three scenarios give this work its novelty.\nThe remaining portions of this study are structured as follows: Short remarks to the elliptic intuitionistic fuzzy quads (EIFQs) and the index matrices (IMs) are provided in Section II. A form of 0-1 E-IFKP for portfolio selection is suggested in Section III, and with the aid of software, it is applied to a real E-IFKP for the selection of portfolio shares of the IT companies which make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Section IV, which summarizes the findings and offers recommendations for additional study, brings the work to a close."

In 2021, the IFS is extended with the E-IFS, which has a different interface. An ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes exists around each element of E-IFS that represents its membership degree and nonmembership degree [5].\nLet\u2019s consider the definition of an intuitionistic fuzzy pair (IFP) [7]: an IFP has the form of \u27e8a(p),b(p)\u27e9 or \u27e8\u00b5(p),\u03bd(p)\u27e9: The components of an IFP are a(p)(\u00b5(p)),b(p)(\u03bd(p)) \u2208 [0,1] and a(p)+b(p) = \u00b5(p)+\u03bd(p)\u2264 1, respectively. These elements represent the degrees of membership and nonmembership of a proposition p. Using the definition of the E-IFS [5], let us define E-IFQ as an object of the following form: \u27e8a(p),b(p);u,v\u27e9= \u27e8\u00b5(p),\u03bd(p);u,v\u27e9, where a(p) + b(p) = \u00b5(p) + \u03bd(p) \u2264 1, which is utilized to evaluate the statement p, is regarded as the \u201ctruth degree\u201d and \u201cfalsity degree\u201d of the assertion p, respectively. The semimajor and semi-minor axes of the ellipse with the center \u27e8a(p)(\u00b5(p)),b(p)(\u03bd(p))\u27e9 are u,v \u2208 [0, \u221a 2], respectively.\nTwo E-IFQs xu1,v1 = \u27e8a,b;u1,v1\u27e9 and yu2,v2 = \u27e8c,d;u2,v2\u27e9, shall be used.

We propose the following relation\nfor comparing E-IFs using a formula for the distance between C-IFSs [6], the relation for comparing two C-IFPs [46], and the distance from the element to the ideal positive alternative [41].\nxu1,v1 \u2265Relliptic yu2,v2 iff R elliptic xu1 ,v1 \u2264 Rellipticyu2 ,v2 (1) where\nRellipticxu1 ,v1 =\n1 6 (2\u2212a\u2212b) (\n| \u221a 2\u2212u1|+ | \u221a 2\u2212 v1|+ |1\u2212a| )\nis the distance between x and the ideal positive alternative \u27e81,0; \u221a 2, \u221a\n2\u27e9 to x.

Over IMs, several operations, relations, and operators are defined (see [3], [48]). Assume that the set of indices I is fixed. Two-dimensional elliptic intuitionistic fuzzy index matrix (2-D E-IFIM) A = [K,L,{\u27e8\u00b5ki,l j ,\u03bdki,l j ;uki,l j ,vki,l j\u27e9}] with index sets K and L (K,L \u2282 I ), we denote the object analogous to circular IFIM (C-IFIM) [46]:\nl1 . . . ln k1 \u27e8\u00b5k1,l1 ,\u03bdk1,l1 ;uk1,l1 ,vk1,l1\u27e9 . . . \u27e8\u00b5k1,ln ,\u03bdk1,ln ;uk1,ln ,vk1,ln\u27e9 ... ... . . .\n... km \u27e8\u00b5km,l1 ,\u03bdkm,l1 ;ukm,l1 ,vkm,l1\u27e9 . . . \u27e8\u00b5km,ln ,\u03bdkm,ln ;ukm,ln ,vkm,ln\u27e9\nThe definition of a 3-D E-IFIM extends the 2-D E-IFIM concept and is identical to those of the 3-D IM, presented in the [3]. Let us introduce some operations over the E-IFIMs. Transposition [3]: The transposed IM of A is A\u2032.\nLet us introduce the following operations over EIFIMs A = [K,L,{\u27e8\u00b5ki,l j ,\u03bdki,l j ;r f ki,l j ,rski,l j\u27e9}] and B = [P,Q,{\u27e8\u03c1pr ,qs ,\u03c3pr ,qs\u27e9;\u03b4 fki,l j ,\u03b4 ski,l j}] with a similar form to that of [3], [46]. Addition-(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217): A\u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217) B = [K \u222aP,L\u222aQ,{\u27e8\u03c6tu,vw ,\u03c8tu,vw\u27e9;\u03b7 ftu,vw ,\u03b7stu,vw}], where \u27e8\u25e61,\u25e62\u27e9 \u2208 {\u27e8max,min\u27e9,\u27e8min,max\u27e9,\u27e8 average, average\u27e9} and \u2217 \u2208 {max,min}. \u27e8\u03c6tu,vw ,\u03c8tu,vw ;\u03b7 ftu,vw ,\u03b7stu,vw\u27e9 = \u27e8\u25e61(\u00b5ki,l j ,\u03c1pr ,qs), \u25e62(\u03bdki,l j ,\u03c3pr ,qs);\u2217(r ftu,vw ,\u03b4 ftu,vw\u27e9),\u2217(rstu,vw ,\u03b4 stu,vw\u27e9). Termwise subtraction-(max,min): A\u2212(max,min,\u2217) B = A\u2295(max,min,\u2217)\u00acB. Termwise multiplication: A\u2297(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217) B = [K \u2229P,L\u2229Q,{\u27e8\u03c6tu,vw ,\u03c8tu,vw ;\u03b7 ftu,vw ,\u03b7stu,vw\u27e9}], where \u27e8\u03c6tu,vw ,\u03c8tu,vw ;\u03b7 ftu,vw ,\u03b7stu,vw\u27e9 = \u27e8\u25e61(\u00b5ki,l j ,\u03c1pr ,qs), \u25e62(\u03bdki,l j ,\u03c3pr ,qs);\u2217(r ftu,vw ,\u03b4 ftu,vw ,\u2217(rstu,vw ,\u03b4 stu,vw\u27e9).\nThe following operations have no equivalents with these verso classical matrices. They are developed to be able to automate certain actions on IMs in order to implement various models and algorithms. Reduction [3]: An IM A\u2019s operations-reduction (k,\u22a5) is defined as follows:\nA(k,\u22a5) = [K \u2212 {k},L,{ctu,vw}],where ctu,vw = aki,l j(tu = ki \u2208 K \u2212{k},vw = l j \u2208 L). Projection [3]: Let M \u2286 K and N \u2286 L. Then, prM,NA = [M,N,{bki,l j}], where for each ki \u2208 M and each l j \u2208 N, bki,l j = aki,l j . Substitution [3]:\n[ p k ;\u22a5 ] A = [ (K \u2212{k})\u222a{p},L,{ak,l} ]\nInternal subtraction of IMs\u2019 components [48]: IO\u2212(max,min)( \u2329 ki, l j,A \u232a\n,\u27e8pr,qs,B\u27e9) = [K,L,{\u27e8\u03b3tu,vw ,\u03b4tu,vw\u27e9}]. Index type operations [48]: AGIndex (max\nelliptic R ),( \u0338\u22a5) (A) = \u27e8ki, l j\u27e9, where \u27e8ki, l j\u27e9 (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m,1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) is the index of the maximum E-IFQ of A in the sense of the relation (1) that has no empty value. Index\n(max elliptic R ),ki (A) = {\u27e8ki, lv1\u27e9, . . . ,\u27e8ki, lvx\u27e9, . . . ,\u27e8ki, lvV \u27e9}, where \u27e8ki, lvx\u27e9 (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m,1 \u2264 x \u2264 V ) are the indices of the largest element in A\u2019s ki-th row. Aggregation operations Let us extend the operations #q,(q \u2264 i \u2264 3) from [47] such that they can be applied over E-IFQs x = \u27e8a,b;r f1,rs1\u27e9 and y = \u27e8c,d;r f2,rs2\u27e9: x#1,\u2217y = \u27e8min(a,c),max(b,d);\u2217(r f1,r f2),\u2217(rs1,rs2)\u27e9; x#2,\u2217y = \u27e8average(a,c),average(b,d);\u2217(r f1,r f2),\u2217(rs1,rs2)\u27e9; x#3,\u2217y = \u27e8max(a,c),min(b,d);\u2217(r f1,r f2),\u2217(rs1,rs2)\u27e9.\nLet the fixed index be k0 /\u2208 K. The expanded definition of the aggregation operation \u03b1K,#q,\u2217(A,k0) by the dimension K over 3-D E-IFIM A utilizing that of ([46], [47]) is as follows:\nhg \u2208 H l1 . . .\nk0 m\n#q,\u2217 i=1\n\u27e8\u00b5ki,l1,hg ,\u03bdki,l1,hg ;r fki,l1,hg ,r fki,l1,hg\u27e9 . . . ,\n. . . ln\n. . . m\n#q,\u2217 i=1 \u27e8\u00b5ki,ln,hg ,\u03bdki,ln,hg ;r fki,l1,hg ,r fki,l1,hg\u27e9\nAggregate global internal operation [48]: AGIO\u2295(#q ,\u2217) (A) . If q = 1,q = 2 or q = 3, we get a pessimistic, averaged, or optimistic scenario. Operation \u201cPurge\" of IM A The following is how we define the new operation \u201cPurge\u201d by the dimension K as follows: PurgeK(A) decreases each row kx of A, if akx,l j \u2264 aky,l j , but akx,le \u2265 aky,le for 1 \u2264 x \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 e \u2264 n."

The problem is: An investor has a budget of Bu = \u27e8\u03c1,\u03c3 ;r fBu,rsBu\u27e9 to spend on assets. A set of m assets from {k1, . . . ,ki, . . . ,km} must be evaluated by experts {d1, . . . ,ds, . . . ,dD} (for s = 1, ...,D) with a given IFP rating res = \u27e8\u03b4s,\u03b5s\u27e9 (1 \u2264 s \u2264 D) using the criteria c1 and c2. Let us use the symbols aki,c1 (for i = 1, ...,m) and aki,c2 (for i = 1, ...,m) to represent the return and the price, respectively, of the ki-th asset. The objective of the problem is to choose the investor\u2019s portfolio\u2019s assets as optimally as possible while staying within his financial\nconstraints. The parameters of this optimization problem are highly unknown because of market dynamics. Through the use of the E-IF logic toolkit, helped by IMs, it is required to look for the best answer for the investment portfolio with three decision-making scenarios (optimistic, averaged, and pessimistic).\nA. An Elliptic IF Portfolio Selection Problem with a Dynamic Programming Approach Using a Type E-IFKP\nThe following are the stages in the IM interpretation for the Elliptic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Portfolio Selection Problem, based on the Circular IFKP technique [46]: Step 1. 3-D evaluation IFIM EV [K,C,E,{evki,c j ,ds}] is created in compliance with the aforementioned problem, where K ={k1,k2, . . . ,km}, C={c1,c2} ,E ={d1, . . . ,ds, . . . ,dD} and the element {evki,c j ,ds}= \u27e8\u00b5ki,c j ,ds ,\u03bdki,c j ,ds\u27e9 (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m,1 \u2264 j \u2264 n,1 \u2264 s \u2264 D) is the estimate of the ds-th expert for the ki-th asset by the c j-th criterion ( j = 1,2). Due to changes in some uncontrolled elements, the expert is unsure about the evaluation according to a particular criterion, and his evaluations take the shape of IFPs. Let the s-th expert\u2019s score (rating) res,s \u2208 E be specified by an IFP \u27e8\u03b4s,\u03b5s\u27e9, where \u03b4s and \u03b5s are considered as the expert\u2019s level of competence and incompetence, respectively.\nNext, we calculate\nEV \u2217[K,C,E,{ev\u2217ki,cg,ds}] = re1 prK,C,d1EV \u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62) . . . . . .\u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62) reD prK,C,dD EV.\nEV := EV \u2217(evki,l j ,ds = ev \u2217 ki,l j ,ds , \u2200ki \u2208 K,\u2200l j \u2208 L,\u2200ds \u2208 E).\nThe degrees of membership and non-membership of the E-IFQs are determined using the three aggregating operations \u03b1K,#1,\u2217,\u03b1K,#3,\u2217 and \u03b1K,#2,\u2217, which provide the evaluations of the ki-th asset against the c j-th criterion in a present moment h f /\u2208 E : PImin[K,C,hm,{piminki,cg,h f }] = \u03b1E,#1(EV \u2217,hm)\n=\nhm c1 c2\nk1 D #1\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5k1,c1,ds ,\u03bdk1,c1,ds\u27e9 D #1\ns=1 \u27e8\u00b5k1,c2,ds ,\u03bdk1,c2,ds\u27e9 ... ... ...\nkm D #1\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5km,c1,ds ,\u03bdkm,c1,ds\u27e9 D #1\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5km,c2,ds ,\u03bdkm,c2,ds\u27e9\n.\nPImax[K,C,hm,{pimaxki,cg,h f }] = \u03b1E,#3(EV \u2217,hm)=\nhm c1 c2\nk1 D #3\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5k1,c1,ds ,\u03bdk1,c1,ds\u27e9 D #3\ns=1 \u27e8\u00b5k1,c2,ds ,\u03bdk1,c2,ds\u27e9 ... ... ...\nkm D #3\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5km,c1,ds ,\u03bdkm,c1,ds\u27e9 D #3\ns=1\n\u27e8\u00b5km,c2,ds ,\u03bdkm,c2,ds\u27e9\n.\nThen construct PI\u2217 = PImin \u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217) PImax and PI[K,C,h f ,{piki,cg,h f }] = \u03b1E,#2(PI\n\u2217,h f ), whose elements are the coordinates of the centers of the E-IFQs evaluating the shares.

If the price of a given asset ki exceeds the budget Bu, then the corresponding row of IM A is reduced by it.\nfor i = 1 to m {If aki,c2 > Bu then A(ki,\u22a5) } Let us denote by |K| = m the number of the elements of the set K, then |C| = 2. As well, we define E-IFIM X [K,C] containing the elements xki,cg (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, \u2264 g \u2264 2) and: {xki,cg} \u2208 { \u27e81,0;0,0\u27e9, if the request ki is selected \u27e80,1;0,0\u27e9 otherwise\nLet us assume that at the start of the algorithm, all compo-\nnents of IM X are identical to \u27e80,1;0,0\u27e9. Create IM S0[u0,L] = c1 c2\nu0 s0u0,c1 s 0 uo,c2\n= c1 c2\nu0 \u27e80,1;0,0\u27e9 \u27e80,1;0,0\u27e9 Step 2. for i = 1 to m do { Create IMs\nRi[ki,C] = prki,CA;SH i\u22121 1 =\n[\nui ui\u22121 ;\u22a5 ] Si\u22121\nfor h = 1 to i+1 do {\nSH i\u221211 = SH i\u22121 1 \u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217)\n[\nuh ki ;\u22a5 ] Ri }\nSi[U i,L] = Si\u22121 \u2295((\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217)) SH i\u22121 1 ;\nfor h = 1 to i+1 do {\nChecks the conditions for the capacity of the knapsack If sih,w > Bu then S i (h,\u22a5) } The \u201cPurge\u201d procedure is currently underway by Si = PurgeU iS i } Go to Step 3. Step 3. This step finds the index of the highest stock return by\nIndex(max Relliptic ),c1(A) = \u27e8ug,c1\u27e9 for i = m to 1 do {Find the \u03b1-nearest elements of siug,c1 (or s i ug,c2 ) (\u03b1 = 0.5) of Si and choose the closest element from them - siug\u2217,c1 (or siug\u2217,c2 ). If {siug\u2217,c1 (or s i ug\u2217,c2)} \u2208 S i and {siug\u2217,c1 (or s i ug\u2217,c2)} /\u2208 S\ni\u22121 then {xki,p = \u27e81,0;0,0\u27e9 and xki,w = \u27e81,0;0,0\u27e9;\nsiug,c1 = s i ug\u2217,c1 \u2212\u2217 aki,c1 ;s i ug,c2 = s i ug\u2217,c2 \u2212\u2217 aki,c2}\nGo to Step 4. Step 4. The optimal return and price of the investment portfolio are:\nAGIO\u2295(#q ,\u2217) ( prK,c1 A\u2297(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217) prK,c1X ) ; AGIO\u2295(#q ,\u2217) ( prK,c2 A\u2297(\u25e61,\u25e62,\u2217) prK,c2 X ) .\nIf q = 1,q = 2 or q = 3 then we determine the optimal benefit\u2019s pessimistic, averaging, or optimistic value. The optimistic scenario has been accepted if \u27e8\u25e61,\u25e62\u27e9 = \u27e8max,min\u27e9 is used in all operations of the algorithm. On the other hand, if \u27e8circ1,circ2\u27e9 = \u27e8min,max\u27e9 is employed, the pessimistic scenario is used. The operation \u201c\u2217= max\u201d is used when there is more ambiguity, else \u201c\u2217 = min\u201d. Therefore several optimal solutions could be generated according to the investor\u2019s opinion. Thus, an investor may have greater confidence in the obtained solution.\nThe complexity of the normal dynamic programming algorithm [28], [59] and the E-IFKP approach are both comparable - O(m.C).\nTo study how the algorithm affects a range of input data, we are now developing software that uses the E-IFKP approach. After reading a file with a matrix of the return predictions and stock price, it completes the aforementioned procedures. It was developed in C++. This objective was accomplished by building an IM structure using the STL\u2019s std::tuple types. This structure is then used to create the fundamental IM protocols [29]. The app requires the share E-IFQs and the knapsack budget Bu as input. When the program is finished, a suggested solution is displayed on the computer screen along with a thorough output of each algorithm iteration.\nIn the scientific literature, no portfolio optimization model on elliptic IF fuzzy data was found, a suitable tool for representing vague or incomplete data in conditions of large fluctuations in market parameters. In this model, there are three scenarios according to the attitudes of the decision maker. Evaluations of the returns and the price of financial assets for the purpose of optimal selection of the portfolio are carried out by experts and their rating is taken into account in the evaluation process. Therefore, the developed E-IF optimal portfolio selection task is socially oriented and reflects the preferences of both the experts and the decision maker. The Markowitz [27] portfolio cannot be applied under conditions of fuzziness and large parameter fluctuations and his model cannot reflect the investor\u2019s attitude towards the market environment \u2013 whether it is pessimistic, optimistic or average.\nB. An E-IFKP Real Case Study for Portfolio Selection\nHere, a real case study for the best asset selection for the investor\u2019s portfolio within his budget B = \u27e80.99,0.0; \u221a 2, \u221a\n2\u27e9 clarifies the proposed E-IFKP in this part. A group of the experts {d1,d2,d3} with the specified IFP rating res = \u27e8\u03b4s,\u03b5s\u27e9 (1\u2264 s\u2264D) is required to evaluate a set of assets {k1,k2,k3,k4} from the IT firms Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc., and Intel Corporation, which make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the last 5 years, by the criteria c1 and c2: the return aki,c1 (for i = 1, ...,m) of the ki-th asset and its price as aki,c2 (for i = 1, ...,m). The objective of the problem is to choose the investor\u2019s portfolio\u2019s assets as efficiently as possible while staying within his financial constraints using three different decision-making scenarios.\nThe solution to the problem:\nStep 1. The initial form of the 3-D evaluation IFIM EV [K,C,E,{evki,cg,ds}] is the following:\nEV =\n\n    \n     d1 c1 c2 k1 \u27e80.54,0.29\u27e9 \u27e80.35,0.48\u27e9 k2 \u27e80.552,0.31\u27e9 \u27e80.38,0.514\u27e9 k3 \u27e80.546,0.265\u27e9 \u27e80.399,0.461\u27e9 k4 \u27e80.486,0.316\u27e9 \u27e80.144,0.694\u27e9 ,\nd2 c1 c2 k1 \u27e80.504,0.365\u27e9 \u27e80.2,0.752\u27e9 k2 \u27e80.504,0.32\u27e9 \u27e80.238,0.74\u27e9 k3 \u27e80.675,0.154\u27e9 \u27e80.0099,0.865\u27e9 k4 \u27e80.672,0.157\u27e9 \u27e80.024,0.96\u27e9 ,\nk1 \u27e80.65,0.13\u27e9 \u27e80.035,0.944\u27e9 k2 \u27e80.081,0.91\u27e9 \u27e80.0019,0.982\u27e9 k3 \u27e80.072,0.91\u27e9 \u27e80.0024,0.99\u27e9 k4 \u27e80.126,0.823\u27e9 \u27e80.007,0.98\u27e9\n\n  \n  \n,\n{evki,c j ,ds} (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4,1 \u2264 g \u2264 2,1 \u2264 s \u2264 3) is the expert\u2019s assessment in accordance with the cg-th criterion for the ki-th stock. Assign the experts the corresponding rating coefficients shown below:\n{r1,r2,r3}= {\u27e80.9,0.1\u27e9,\u27e80.8,0.08\u27e9,\u27e80.7,0.07\u27e9}. We create\nEV \u2217[K,C,E,{ev\u2217ki,cg,ds}] = re1 prK,C,d1 EV \u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62) . . .\u2295(\u25e61,\u25e62) reD prK,C,dDEV ;\nEV := EV \u2217. Then, we determine E-IFIM A[K,C], which consists of the assessments of the shares made at a moment h f by 2 criteria: c1 c2\nk1 \u27e80.55,0.29;0.56,0.98\u27e9 \u27e80.38,0.49;0.47,0.68\u27e9 k2 \u27e80.5,0.34;0.51,0.97\u27e9 \u27e80.19,0.72;0.33,0.77\u27e9 k3 \u27e80.66,0.14;0.8,0.22\u27e9 \u27e80.02,0.91;0.011,1.76\u27e9 k4 \u27e80.099,0.87;0.09,1.3\u27e9 \u27e80.004,0.99;0.003,1.21\u27e9 ,\nwhere K = {k1,k2,k3,k4} , C = {c1,c2} and {aki,c1 ,aki,c2} are, respectively, the ki-th stock\u2019s price and E-IF return. X [K,C] is formed with the elements \u27e80,1;0,0\u27e9. Step 2. The following IMs are calculated consecutively by the algorithm: S01[u1,C],S 1[U1,C],S11[U\u22171,C],S2[U2,C]. The\noperation \u201cPurge\u201d has reduced the u2 and u3 row of S2[U2,C]. Then IMs are created: S21[U\u22172,C],S3[U3,C]. The operation \u201cPurge\u201d has reduced the u4 row of S3[U3,C]. Then IMs are created: S31[U\u22173,C],S4[U4,C]. The following is the final IM S4[U\u22174,C] after the \u201cPurge\u201d operation:\nc1 c2 u1 \u27e80.546,0.285;0.56,0.99\u27e9 \u27e80.375,0.487;0.47,0.69\u27e9 u2 \u27e80.495,0.341;0.51,0.97\u27e9 \u27e80.191,0.723;0.33,0.69\u27e9 u3 \u27e80.546,0.285;0.56,0.22\u27e9 \u27e80.022,0.913;0.01,0.69\u27e9 u4 \u27e80.099,0.867;0.09,0.99\u27e9 \u27e80.004,0.986;0.003,0.69\u27e9\nStep 3. In this step, using the results from Step 2. we determine that the fourth, second, and first IT businesses\u2019 stocks are included in the investor\u2019s ideal portfolio in this problem. Step 4. The outcomes for the optimistic, pessimistic, and average scenarios for the greatest benefit are shown in the following table (cf. table I):\nIn conditions of high inflation and great uncertainty, the decision-maker will choose the pessimistic scenario, in case of small fluctuations in the market parameters, the decisionmaker will prefer the averaged scenario, and in the case of stability of the market parameters, the optimistic scenario will be preferred.\nA comparative analysis between the proposed E-IFKP method for portfolio optimization could not be performed because we could not find methods for similar type of problems under conditions of high uncertainty modeled by E-IF logic.\nAfter the results are obtained in E-IFKP portfolio method, the question arises whether small deviations in the values of the input parameters used change the results of the model. Checking the robustness of the results in the developed model and analyzing the sensitivity to the changes in the input variables of the obtained results is a critical step for E-IFKP portfolio problem.\nThe weights of the experts are of great importance on the results of the E-IFKP portfolio problem. A sensitivity analysis consisting of 8 different scenarios has been conducted to analyze the effect of the change in weight of each expert on the ranking results. In the analysis, a total of 8 different changes have been applied in the weights of the three experts included in the study, and the final results are different in the cases indicated. Based on the software final results in these cases, we can conclude that the optimal portfolio selections in the described cases differ. The results of the software show that there is sensitivity in the output results when including 1, 2 and 4 assets; or 1 and 4 assets; 2 and 4 assets. In some of these cases, the optimization problem is invalid from the point of view of IF logic.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the input data by \u00b110%,\u00b125%,\u00b150% and \u00b1 75% respectively. In all these cases, the input data was invalid from the IF point of view."

The software being developed for the performance of the E-IFKP approach is applied to a real case for the selection of portfolio shares of the IT companies which make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Three scenarios are proposed to the decision maker for the final choice - pessimistic, optimistic, and average. Future research will include expanding this E-IFKP technique to three-dimensional intuitionistic fuzzy data [3] as well as developing software for its implementation."
