    "abstractText": "Lots of damaged fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) components are replaced by new components instead of repairing. Furthermore, only very labor-intensive repair methods are available on the market to fully restore the integrity of the structure. This requires a high level of experience or, alternatively, very cost-intensive technology, such as the use of computer tomography and robotics. The high costs and CO2 emissions caused by the manufacture of FRP components then bear no relation to their service life. The research project IGF-21985 BR \u201cFRP-Repair\u201d aims to solve the named challenges. Using semiconductor oxide catalysts, the matrix can be locally depolymerized by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and thus removed from the damaged area of the FRP component. Subsequently, the damaged fibers in this area can be detached. By using customized textile repair patches and local thermoset reinfiltration, the repair area is restored. With this process, the fiber structure can be repaired locally with new fibers on the textile level. The repair is similar to the original production of a fiber composite in an infusion process. No additional adhesive material is used. As a result, repaired FRP structures with restored mechanics and a near-original surface can be realized. This article provides an insight into the actual steps of the development of the FRP component repair process using dry textile patches. The empirical investigation of overlapped rovings and UD material showed the expected results. Residual fracture forces of up to 86% could be achieved. The most interesting approach on the roving level was splicing the overlapping fibers. The free ends of the fibers of the patch and part are mechanically bonded. This bond at the textile level is further strengthened by infusion with matrix.",

FRP components usually have high production costs and restricted recyclability and, above all, poor repair opportunities [1,2,5]. Previous methods for repairing FRPs are mainly based on shape cutting (e.g., milling) the damaged composite area, the comprising fibers and the matrix. The repair site of the FRP component prepared in this way is then mostly filled up with preimpregnated layers, so-called prepregs [6\u20139]. There are several approaches to repair FRP structures, e.g., the scarf method or doubler method [6,10\u201316]. These initial repair processes are always associated with high manual effort and manufacturing expenses and often significantly reduce the composite strength of the repaired component or cause extra weight. There is no established procedure to repair FRP components on the textile level by bonding fibers on the textile level. In most cases, complete parts or components have to be replaced [17,18]. End\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4680. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16134680 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4680 2 of 17\nof life (EOL) before the design-based service life leads to a reduction in the environmental and economic profitability of FRP use and to a decrease in lightweight potential. It also significantly reduces the economic and ecological efficiency of FRP production, which is already very energy-intensive. Recent research efforts [19,20] focused on the development of repair processes specially adapted to FRP. Therefore, the damaged fiber scaffold of the composite parts has to be fixed with new fibers in a different way to state-of-the-art procedures because, normally, the repair procedure is not basically carried out at the composite in total and is not focused on the textile scaffold. To be able to fix the fibers properly by reconnecting to new fibers, the matrix is removed by an oxide semiconductor-supported matrix degradation. By an ultraviolet (UV)-radiation-initialized degradation mechanism, or so-called depolymerization [20], the fibers are detached from the surrounding polymer material to be repaired. The process starts at the first reinforcement layer of the FRP component. By UV radiation, the matrix is removed. The fibers of the first layer are removed in a specific length to get access to the layers below. After that, the procedure is repeated with all subsequent layers in the direction of thickness until the depth of the damage is reached. Repairable structural damage can be, e.g., structural fracture, delamination or holes. Defects are determined by visual inspection and, if necessary, by nondestructive testing methods. Some defects do not cover the whole cross-section of the structure. Then, the depth of the repair is adapted. The prepared repair area is filled with fitting textile patches in the prepared gradation. With the help of textile processes, called splicing, the patch fibers are connected on the textile level to their counterparts on the boundary of the damage area. The repair area is reinfiltrated with thermoset matrix to restore the composite. The surface can be smoothed afterwards to get back to the former surface and surface quality. This article gives a brief overview on the repair effect and the benefits of using dry textile patches for damaged composite parts. In this state of the research, a precondition was used to have an idealized material setup, which makes the results comparable. Therefore patch and parent material were combined in a dry textile state and infused together. Particular attention was paid to the interaction between the textile patch and the composite part in the overlap area and the achievable load transfer or regained structural strength after repair."

            "text": "2.1. Experimental Materials 2.1.1. Raw Materials\nWithin the study, two different types of carbon fibers were used: T700S-roving material (TORAYCA) and a unidirectional noncrimp fabric (UD-NCF) (Faserverbundwerkstoffe Composite Technology, Waldenbuch, Germany) with PX35 (ZOLTEK). Both fiber types are high-tenacity fibers (HT) with the specific mechanical values summarized in Table 1.\nThe standard resin for producing the specimens was RIMR 135 mixed with the curing agent RIMH 137 (Hexion) with a 100:30 \u00b1 2 resin-to-hardener mixing ratio (by weight). In a comparing test series, a second epoxy matrix system (-Sika) was used: Sika Biresin\u00ae CR83 with the hardener CH83-10 in a mixing ratio of 100:30 by weight as well. In this way, the influence of higher mechanical properties of the second resin system (-Sika) on the strength of the repair were analyzed. The mechanical properties of the pure resin systems are listed\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4680 3 of 17\nin Table 2. Prior to each infiltration process, the resin-hardener mixture was subsequently degassed in a degassing pressure cooker Walther Pilot MDG 12 HZM.\n2.1.2. Sample Preparation\nWithin the project, FRP samples, in this work specifically carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) samples, were used to examine a repair process for FRP on the textile level. The main objective of this study was to analyze and compare the effectiveness of FRP repair based on dry textile patches. The starting precondition for this investigation is an idealized material setup, meaning that the component \u201cto be repaired\u201d is not subjected the previously described procedure, i.e., identifying the size of the damage, removing the matrix out of the damaged area by the UV radiation process, preparing the fiber ends of the parent material, overlapping the fiber ends, reinfiltrating new resin and curing the area. This is necessary because, in former investigations [19], it has been found that many interfering influences come into the process at early stages. Instead of this influential process chain, a cocuring process was used, where both parent material and the repair patch were fitted together in their dry fabric state and manufactured as one component. For the investigation of the performance of the repair method, this workaround is chosen. In further steps within the project, the full repair process is investigated. The empiric investigation was planned and performed in a rising material complexity. The CFRP specimens were divided into two categories: \u201cComposite A\u2014tow\u201d (CA) and \u201cComposite B\u2014single layered\u201d (CB). While in the CA series, T700S (TORAYCA) carbon fibers were used, for the CB series, a unidirectional noncrimp fabric (UD-NCF) (Faserverbundwerkstoffe Composite Technology) with PX35 (ZOLTEK) carbon fibers was used (cf. Table 1). The fibers were infiltrated with the resin-hardener system (RIMR 135/RIMH 137; SikaCR83/CH83-10) by the vacuum-assisted resin infusion VARI (Figure 1). The VARI manufacturing process is conducted in a closed system (vacuum bag): the depression is generated by a vacuum pump to evacuate the textile preform. The ambient pressure leads the resin to flow into and through the dry carbon fiber fabric (preform) and also to an even compression of the textile preform during the infusion and the subsequent cure. Through prior experimental testing, it was concluded that infiltrating the fibers with resin perpendicular rather than parallel to the fiber orientation resulted in a better resin flow and thus better composite quality. Therefore, the resin inlet and vacuum outlet were positioned as seen in Figure 1. For the VARI process, a steel plate was used as tool surface. It was cleaned with acetone and then coated with an epoxy mold release agent (Loctite 770-NC). The textile material (preform) was placed on top of the plate and then covered with a perforated PEP foil, which separates the preform from the flow media above. A PES flow channel strip was glued to a PET flow medium next to the preform at the outer edges and then covered with it. Both the flow channel and medium ensure that the resin is properly distributed throughout the entirety of the laminate. The tip of the resin inlet and vacuum outlet were connected and secured to the flow channel. Next, a PA/PE/PA vacuum bag was placed on top of the whole setup and sealed with sealant tape (Tacky Tape SM5142). The air inside was then evacuated and, using a digital pressure gauge, it was verified that it was sealed\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4680 4 of 17\nairtight. Finally, the preform was infiltrated, cured for 15 h at 50 \u25e6C on top of a heating plate and then postcured for 15 h at 80 \u25e6C in an oven. The different composite configurations investigated in this study had a sample size of at least 5 per series. The WOCO 50 abrasive cutting machine (UNIPREC), with an electroplated diamond cutoff wheel (grit size D427; Pferd), was used to machine the tensile lap-shear test specimens.

For that purpose, samples from the different composite configurations (composite A\u2013B) were machined, acclimated, weighted in a mass scale, burned for 1 h at 450 \u00b0C and weighted again. Through the residual mass and the known density of the carbon fibers (Table 1) and epoxy resin (Table 1), the fiber volume fraction was calculated thereupon.

For the first series, Composite A\u2014tow, there is a direct correlation between the length of the overlap and the breaking force of the specimens: the longer the overlap length, the higher the resulting breaking force Fmax of the specimen (cf. Figure 10). The specimens of the CF-roving (R) infused with reference resin show a breaking force of 1.8 kN. The overlapped specimens show lower breaking forces: OL1 on average 0.9 kN, OL2 on average 1.1 kN, OL3 on average 1.2 kN, OL3 with the second matrix system from Sika 1.1 kN, OL4 1.4 kN and SPC on average 1.5 kN (Figure 10). Relative to the reference specimens (R), this corresponds to the normalized residual strength Fres 49.6%, 61.5%, 67.9%, 63.2%, 74.6% and 85.8% of the achievable normalized residual strength (Fres). The comparison of two different matrix systems leads to the result that the specimen infused with the standard matrix system for this study RimR135/RIMH137 (Hexion) showed around 7% higher breaking forces than the comparative matrix system from Sika.

At the same time, the overlap length was just 20 mm, corresponding with the specimen from OL3. In comparison, an 18% higher residual strength was reached. This is mainly attributed to the mechanical joint in the textile state created by the air splicer (Figure 4), which also confirms the findings in the literature [24], where it has been shown to produce joints on dry yarns with a high residual strength percentage. In future work, the textile splicing connection will be examined in more detail. The images of the broken specimens (Figure 11, R, OL1\u2013OL3) also reveal that when the overlap length increases, so does the contribution of the fibers to resist against the applied tensile force. The reference samples (R, cf. Figure 11) are completely \u2018exploded\u2019, all filaments flew away at the moment of the fracture.

Nevertheless, upon analyzing the standard deviations, which are overlapping, it is found that there may not be a statistical significance between leaving or removing these threads. After further analyzing the overlap area, many fibers are not aligned properly with the fibers of the parent material because of the removal of the fixing thread. If the fibers are not aligned properly with the xaxis of the subsequent composite, the load transmission is not optimal. This deficit can be attributed to the stacking of the workpiece prior to the infiltration of the resin. This factor may explain why the standard deviation of N OL3 is relatively high. But, in general, it is possible to say that there is not that great an influence from fixing thread material in the overlap area in terms of overlapping and contacting fibers ends. The specimens with modified edge geometry (M1, M2) show a slightly lower residual strength percentage than the specimens without edge geometry modification: 57.7% (M1) and 69.3% (M2). This may be because the surface area of the overlap of the specimens without modification is bigger than the surface area of the specimens with modification (cf. Figure 15). Moreover, despite M2 having a slightly lower surface area, it is about 12% stronger than M1. It can be assumed that due to the two wider stress spike locations (marked in red; Figure 15), the specimens of M1 have a lower breaking force. Another observation is that M1 has similar residual breaking force values to the specimens without edge geometry modification at an overlap length of 10 mm (N OL2). The weakest link of M1 is also located at 10 mm, and possibly, the debonding starts here. Conversely, M2 may have a more gradual and uniform stress distribution throughout the width of the specimen due to its geometry.

            "text": "The general results of the Composite A series (tow) could be verified and confirmed with the Composite B series (single layered). With increasing overlap length (5\u201340 mm) and the associated decreasing scarf angle, the residual breaking force increases. The overlap of 40 mm is investigated only to extend the field of knowledge, as this length is not practical for performing repairs on real structures, as the repair area would become too large. As already mentioned in 4.1, a repair with just overlapping fiber ends (N OL1\u2013N OL3) does not lead to a worthwhile repair result. And the high overlap length of 40 mm (N OL4) leads to a very huge repair area, which makes the repair process less efficient, because a lot of material must be removed and exchanged by patch material and resin. There is a small difference between the sample with the string removed (N OL3) and the sample with the string remaining on the fibers (N OL3 T). Due to the overlap of the standard deviation, there is no significant difference between removing and leaving the binding thread on the UD sheet. As for Composite A series, changing the matrix system results in a small decrease in residual breaking strength (N OL3\u2014Sika vs. N OL3). The M1 and M2 series with a modified overlap area geometry showed lower residual breaking forces compared with N OL3-T. The differences in overlap area only result in lower fracture forces, probably due to local stress concentrations. The approach using the modified geometry of the textile patch geometry is not expedient."

            "text": "This paper presents the latest results in the development of a new repair process for FRP, with the specific example of CFRP, at the textile level. For comparability of the results, an ideal starting condition of a co-infusion of patch and parent material was used. The empirical investigation with different overlap lengths and different coupling mechanisms showed the expected results. The overlap of two textile layers in the raw textile state (tow or single-layer material) leads to residual fracture forces of up to 86%, whereas in a realistic and industrial practical overlap length range (up to 20 mm), only 75% of the new value fracture force is achieved. The simple overlap results in a force-fit joint due to load transfer via shear in the epoxy matrix. The approaches of replacing the resin system with a \u201cstronger\u201d one or changing the geometry of the overlap area do not show better results. The most interesting approach was splicing the overlapping fibers. The end of the patch fiber is mechanically bonded to the free fiber end of the starting material. This bond at the textile level is further strengthened by infusion with the matrix. The connection is thus converted from a force-fit joint only (simple overlap) to a form- and force-fit joint connection. These test specimens result in breaking forces of 86% of the virgin material. These promising results from tow material will be transferred to sheet material in the next step. Further investigations of the connection between patch and base material on the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4680 16 of 17\ntextile and composite level will be carried out in the near future. With the help of this new approach in the repair of FRPs, components can be used more economically and ecologically up to their lifetime limit.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.R. and J.D.O.A.; methodology, D.R. and J.D.O.A.; formal analysis, D.R. and J.D.O.A.; investigation, D.R. and J.D.O.A.; resources, C.C.; data curation, C.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.R. and J.D.O.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, E.H. and C.C.; visualization, J.D.O.A. and D.R.; supervision, C.C.; project administration, E.H. and C.C.; funding acquisition, E.H. and C.C.
