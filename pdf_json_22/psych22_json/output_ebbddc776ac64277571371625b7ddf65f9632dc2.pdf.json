    "abstractText": "Background: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder that has a unique status of a quintessentially neuropsychiatric condition at the interface of neurology (movement disorder) and psychiatry (behavioral/emotional condition). However, the behavioral and emotional profile has seemed to be neglected in the literature thus far. This study aimed to investigate the behavioral and emotional profile of TS. Methods: A total of 124 patients aged 6\u201316 years with TS were included in this study, including ageand sex-matched health control, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) groups. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to screen the behavioral and emotional profile of the TS and other compared groups. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used to assess TS tic severity. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate the difference between the TS and other compared groups. Results: The results showed that the eight factors of the CBCL had no association with motor tics, vocal tics, or tic severity (p > 0.05). However, positive correlations were identified between functional impairments (subscales of YGTSS) and thought problems (TP) and rule-breaking behavior (RBB). Based on the eight-factor profile of the CBCL, TS showed a similar profile to MDD but different from ADHD and OCD, which showed similar profiles. Conclusions: Based on the assessment of the CBCL of TS, it was found that \u201cpure\u201d TS might show fewer behavioral and emotional problems than OCD, ADHD, and MDD. Similar behavioral and emotional profiles were identified between TS and MDD, but not OCD and ADHD. More attention needs to be paid to the thought problems and rule break problems in the CBCL in the screening stage, which might have a potential influence on the functional impairments of TS.",

This study aimed to investigate the behavioral and emotional profile\nof TS.\nMethods: A total of 124 patients aged 6\u201316 years with TS were included in this study,\nincluding age- and sex-matched health control, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depressive disorder (MDD)\ngroups. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to screen the behavioral and\nemotional profile of the TS and other compared groups. The Yale Global Tic Severity\nScale (YGTSS) was used to assess TS tic severity. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was\nused to investigate the difference between the TS and other compared groups.\nResults: The results showed that the eight factors of the CBCL had no association\nwith motor tics, vocal tics, or tic severity (p > 0.05). However, positive correlations were\nidentified between functional impairments (subscales of YGTSS) and thought problems\n(TP) and rule-breaking behavior (RBB). Based on the eight-factor profile of the CBCL,\nTS showed a similar profile to MDD but different from ADHD and OCD, which showed\nsimilar profiles.\nConclusions: Based on the assessment of the CBCL of TS, it was found that \u201cpure\u201d\nTS might show fewer behavioral and emotional problems than OCD, ADHD, and MDD.\nSimilar behavioral and emotional profiles were identified between TS and MDD, but not\nOCD and ADHD. More attention needs to be paid to the thought problems and rule break\nproblems in the CBCL in the screening stage, which might have a potential influence on\nthe functional impairments of TS.\nKeywords: Tourette syndrome, CBCL, behavioral and emotional profile, ADHD, OCD, MDD"

            "text": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics that persist for at least 1 year (1). TS holds a unique status of a quintessentially neuropsychiatric condition at the interface of neurology (movement disorder) and psychiatry (behavioral/emotional condition) (2). It should be noted that TS presents with symptoms that seemingly mock the divisions between neurology (motor/vocal tic symptoms) and psychiatry/psychology (that is, motor, behavioral, and emotional symptoms) (3, 4). However, when investigating TS, we should focus not only on the movement dimensions (tic symptoms) of the condition but also on the behavioral and emotional symptoms of TS.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the behavioral and emotional\nsymptoms of TS include attention problems, aggressive behavior, anxiety/depressive symptoms, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and so on (5). Most of these symptoms are associated with the comorbidities of TS. For example, high rates of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) have been well-documented (6, 7). Moreover, major depressive disorder (MDD) has also been reported in TS (8, 9). It should be noted that comorbidities make the behavioral and emotional symptoms of TS more \u201ccomplex.\u201d Some studies have highlighted that \u201cpure\u201d TS (only tic symptoms) might be different from TS-Plus (that is, TS+OCD, TS+ADHD) (10, 11). TS+OCD has been regarded as one of the subtypes of TS, and TS+ADHD is another subtype (12). Some studies reported that the behavioral and emotional symptoms of TS were associated with OCD-related symptoms, while some reported OCD-related symptoms in TS (12\u201315). However, the behavioral and emotional profile of \u201cpure\u201d TS might need more evidence.\nFurthermore, the comorbidities of TS, such as ADHD, OCD, and MDD, suggest that there is an overlap between TS and these mental disorders (16). Most studies focus on the differences between \u201cpure\u201d TS and TS plus other comorbid mental disorders, but few focus on the difference between \u201cpure\u201d TS and other \u201cpure\u201d mental disorders, especially at the behavioral and emotional levels.\nThe Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is one of the most important and stable tools for identifying the behavioral and emotional profiles of mental disorders (17, 18). It can be used to screen for TS, OCD, ADHD, MDD, and more (14, 19\u2013 24). Thus, the CBCL might be a good tool to present the differences in behavioral and emotional profiles among different mental disorders.\nTherefore, this study aimed to investigate the behavioral and emotional profile of \u201cpure\u201d TS. Furthermore, we compared the differences in behavioral and emotional profiles between TS and other mental disorders (including OCD, ADHD, and MDD); the CBCL was used to present these differences. We hypothesize that TS may show different behavioral and emotional profiles when compared with OCD, ADHD, and MDD."

To identify patients with \u201cpure\u201d TS, the following criteria had to be met: (1) aged between 6 and 16 years, (2)met the Tourette syndrome diagnostic criteria according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), (3) no central nervous system diseases or intellectual disability, and (4) no comorbidities of other mental disorders. Age- and sex-matched groups with MDD, OCD, and ADHD as well as healthy controls (HCs) were also recruited. To identify the patients with \u201cpure\u201d MDD, OCD, and ADHD, the criterion was that all patients in these groups should not have comorbidities with other mental disorders. For example, if the included patients belong to the MDD group, they should not have OCD, ADHD, TS, or other mental disorders. The HC group did not have any mental disorders.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital of Capital Medical University, and written informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of the participants or their parents."

First, we compared age using a t-test and the percentage of boys using a chi-square test. Second, the mean, standard deviation (SD), kurtosis, and skewness of the CBCL and its subscales were calculated for the TS group. Third, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the YGTSS and CBCL. Fourth, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to compare the CBCL and its subscales in different groups (TS, OCD, ADHD, MDD, and HC). MANOVA is a procedure for comparing multivariate sample means. As a multivariate procedure, it is used when there are two or more dependent variables and is often followed by significance tests involving individual dependent variables separately (35). Bonferroni correction was used when performing multiple comparisons among the different groups. To present the behavioral and emotional profiles, T-scores were used to calculate the eight factors based on CBCL. The T-score is one form of a standardized test statistic. Formulate T = (Z \u00d7 10) + 50, and formulate Z= (X\u2013x)/SD. X is the value of one of the rough scores of the whole sample, and x is the mean of the whole sample. A radar chart based on T-scores was used to present the CBCL profiles of the different groups.

Furthermore, the age- and sex-matched groups included ADHD (n = 127), OCD (n =128), MDD (n = 127), and HC (n = 130) groups. For more details, see Figure 1.\nThe mean age of the patients in these groups was 10.37 \u00b1 1.91 years (TS), 10.48 \u00b1 2.74 years (ADHD), 10.59 \u00b1 2.45 years (OCD), 10.48\u00b1 3.06 years (MDD), and 10.46\u00b1 2.38 years (HC). No significant age differences were identified in these groups (F = 0.128, p = 0.97). For the percentage of males, the TS group was 70.97%, ADHD group was 70.08%, OCD group was 70.31%, MDD group was 69.29%, and HC group was 68.46%; there was no significant difference among these groups (chi-square= 0.13, p = 1.00). The mean years of education of the patients in these groups were 4.36 \u00b1 1.87 years (TS), 4.45 \u00b1 2.25 years (ADHD), 4.58 \u00b1 2.21 years (OCD), 4.48 \u00b1 2.88 years (MDD), and 4.46 \u00b1 2.19 years (HC). For the years of education, no significant age differences were identified in these groups (p > 0.05). The duration of illness (years) of the patients in these groups was 2.37 \u00b1 1.89 years (TS), 2.48 \u00b1 1.04 years (ADHD), 2.59 \u00b1 1.45 years (OCD), 2.48 \u00b1 1.06 years (MDD), and 2.46 \u00b1 1.38 years (HC). For the duration of illness, no significant age differences were identified in these groups (p > 0.05).\nWe also calculated the YGTSS scores in the TS group, and the total YGTSS score was 21.63 \u00b1 8.94 (motor tic: 12.77 \u00b1 4.06; vocal tic: 6.24 \u00b1 3.53; functional impairment 2.63 \u00b1 4.88). The CY-BOCS score of the OCD group was 15.36 \u00b1 4.45. Three subscales of SNAP-IV scores in the ADHD group were 1.75 \u00b1 0.43 (inattention score), 1.83 \u00b1 0.52 (hyperactivity/impulsivity score) and 0.83 \u00b1 0.35 (oppositional score).

            "text": "This study aimed to compare the behavioral and emotional profile of \u201cpure\u201d TS with other mental disorders. The results showed that there was no correlation between tic symptoms and behavioral and emotional problems in \u201cpure\u201d TS. However, TP and RBB might have a potential influence on TS function. The \u201cpure TS\u201d group showed higher behavioral and emotional problems than the HC group and the same level of severity of behavioral and emotional problems as the MDD group. The \u201cpure\u201d OCD and ADHD groups showed higher-level severities of behavioral and emotional problems than the TS group. Moreover, the difference between the TS and OCD groups was mainly in the dimensions of A/D, W/D, TP, AP, and AB. The difference between the TS and ADHD groups was\nmainly in the dimensions of A/D, W/D, TP, AP, RBB, and AB. The difference between the TS and MDD groups was mainly in the AB dimension. TS, OCD, ADHD, and MDD showed the same levels of SC and SP. These results indicate that the \u201cpure\u201d TS might have a similar behavioral and emotional profile to \u201cpure MDD\u201d but a different profile compared to \u201cpure\u201d OCD and ADHD.\nIn the present study, it was found that the TS group might show a similar behavioral and emotional profile to the MDD group at the behavioral level. Rizzo et al. (36) reported that depression is significantly associated with TS factors, such as tic severity, but not obsessive compulsiveness. Furthermore, we found that there was no association between tic symptoms and behavioral/emotional problems. This implies that the \u201cpure\u201d tic symptoms and behavioral/emotional problems are two distinct cluster symptoms. We also identified higher CBCL scores in the TS group than in the HC group. This suggests that even the \u201cpure\u201d TS might have some behavioral and emotional problems different from tic symptoms. Indeed, Rizzo et al. (12) also reported that emotional lability represents an intrinsic core feature of Tourette syndrome that is unrelated to comorbidity.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 784753\nTABLE 4 | Post hoc Tests (multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction).\nTotal and Subscales (CBCL) TS vs. Groups MD SE P 95% CI Lower Bound 95% CI Upper Bound\nTotal HC 19.03** 2.41 P < 0.01 12.23 25.83\nOCD \u22129.50** 2.42 P < 0.01 \u221216.32 \u22122.68\nADHD \u221212.11** 2.43 P < 0.01 \u221218.95 \u22125.27\nMDD \u22124.70 2.42 0.53 \u221211.52 2.13\nA/D HC 2.35** 0.39 P < 0.01 1.24 3.45\nOCD \u22121.20* 0.40 0.03 \u22122.31 \u22120.08\nADHD \u22121.09 0.40 0.06 \u22122.21 0.02\nMDD \u22120.26 0.40 1 \u22121.37 0.86\nW/D HC 1.40** 0.32 P < 0.01 0.49 2.3\nOCD \u22121.36** 0.32 P < 0.01 \u22122.27 \u22120.45\nADHD \u22120.94* 0.32 0.04 \u22121.85 \u22120.03\nMDD \u22120.50 0.32 1 \u22121.41 0.41"

This might be the most likely reason for the similar behavioral and emotional profile for \u201cpure\u201d TS and MDD. Further evidence is needed to investigate the association between tic symptoms and depressive symptoms in the future.\nFurthermore, in the present study, we also found a difference in AB between \u201cpure\u201d TS and MDD. Compared with MDD, OCD, and ADHD, \u201cpure\u201d TS showed less aggressive problems. Aggressive behavior can be found in young patients with MDD (37), ADHD (38, 39), and OCD (40). Recently, a study reported that there was no association between aggressive behavior and\ntic symptoms, but comorbid ADHD and OCD increased the risk of aggressive behavior in patients with tic disorders (41). This suggests that aggressive behavior might be associated with comorbidities of TS but not with tic symptoms. This might be regarded as one of the most important behavioral indicators to distinguish the \u201cpure\u201d TS from OCD, ADHD, and MDD.\nIn the present study, we found confirmed differences between TS and ADHD at the behavioral level. \u201cPure\u201d ADHD might present more ADHD-related behavioral problems (such as AP, AB, and RBB), which is different from tic symptoms. Furthermore, ADHD-related behavioral problems might also\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 784753\nFIGURE 3 | The CBCL profile of the TS and other compared groups.\nlead to emotional problems, which might be the reason why ADHD showed higher scores for A/D and W/D than TS. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when TS was compared with OCD. The OCD group showed higher levels of behavioral problems in AP, AB, RBB, and TP, as well as emotional problems in A/D and W/D. However, for the RBB, the TS and OCD groups showed similar scores. It should be noted that ADHD and OCD were the two most common comorbidities for TS, and both tend to persist (15). Both the genetic and phenotypic overlap of ADHD/OCD and TS have been reported (42). Moreover, it has been suggested that OCD and ADHD in TS predict worse outcomes of TS (43). The results of this study indicate that the comorbidities of ADHD and OCD in TS might increase behavioral and emotional problems andmake the profile of TS more complex. Taken together, \u201cpure\u201d TS showed fewer behavioral and emotional problems, but with the comorbidities of ADHD or OCD, more behavioral and emotional problems might be identified. The dimension of OCD-related symptoms indicated that compulsivity is a clearly distinguished dimension for TS. How tics with both compulsivity and impulsivity, such as self-injurious behaviors and coprolalia, relate to the profile of CBCL in terms of the relationship between tics and OCD might be an important research direction for TS. Other behavioral and emotional problems, such as ADHD-related symptoms, might be another dimension of TS.\nNotably, we identified the relationship between TP and the function of TS, which indicates that this dimension of behavioral and emotional problems might influence the functional impairment of TS. Although TP is clinically useful for identifying psychotic symptoms in children, it also includes items for the assessment of obsessive thoughts and compulsions, selfharm, picking at parts of the body, and more (44). These items have shown a robust association with the functional impairment of TS (45\u201347).\nRBB has been shown to be associated with antisocial behavior problems, which are key factors in the development of youth violence and aggression (48, 49). This suggests that more attention should be given to RBB problems at the screening stage of TS. It should be noted that AB and RBB always showed a closed relationship. Therefore, there might be somewhat contradictory evidence that RRB had a significant correlation with functional impairments, while AB had a fairly low correlation. RBB had a much higher kurtosis than AB, and the correlation might be caused by the presence of a small number of TS participants with high RBB.\nCompared to RBB, TP had less significant kurtosis. Therefore, TPmay bemore closely related to TS than RBB, and compulsivity indicated by TP may be a feature of TS, even if OCD is not comorbid.\nOverall, in the present study, we found that \u201cpure\u201d TS might show fewer behavioral and emotional problems than OCD and ADHD. Similar behavioral and emotional profiles were identified between TS and MDD, but not OCD and ADHD. These results indicate that comorbidities (such as OCD and ADHD) might make the behavioral and emotional profiles more complex. Aggressive problems might be an important factor in distinguishing \u201cpure\u201d TS from OCD, ADHD, and MDD. Furthermore, we need to pay more attention to TP and RBB problems in the screening stage of TS, which might have a potential influence on the functional impairments of TS.\nThis study has two limitations. First, a limited number of participants were included in this study. A larger sample size and follow-up studies of behavioral and emotional profiles for TS are needed to confirm these results. Second, anxiety disorders are also a common comorbidity of TS but were not included in this study. Third, information about the medication used is absent.

Therefore, when we investigate the behavioral and emotional profiles in TS in future studies, we need to consider the influence of medicine, especially secondgeneration antipsychotics."
