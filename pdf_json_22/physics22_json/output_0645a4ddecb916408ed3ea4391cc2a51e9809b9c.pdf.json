The logistic map xt+1 = 1 \u2212 ax2t \u2208 [\u22121, 1] (a \u2208 [0, 2]) is neither large, since it has only one degree of freedom, nor closed, since it is dissipative. It exhibits, nevertheless, a peculiar time evolution of its natural entropy, which is the additive Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon one, SBG = \u2212 \u2211W i=1 pi ln pi, for all values of a for which the Lyapunov exponent is positive, and the nonadditive one Sq = 1\u2212 \u2211W i=1 p q i\nq\u22121 with q = 0.2445 . . . at the edge of chaos, where the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, W being the number of windows of the phase space partition. We numerically show that, for increasing time, the phasespace-averaged entropy overshoots above its stationary-state value in all cases. However, when W \u2192 \u221e, the overshooting gradually disappears for the most chaotic case (a = 2), whereas, in remarkable contrast, it appears to monotonically diverge at the Feigenbaum point (a = 1.4011 . . .). Consequently, the stationary-state entropy value is achieved from above, instead of from below, as it could have been a priori expected. These results raise the question whether the usual requirements \u2013 large, closed, and for generic initial conditions \u2013 for the second principle validity might be necessary but not sufficient."

            "text": "Molecular physics may be seen as a more detailed description of solidly established laws of chemistry. Analogously, atomic physics may be seen as a more detailed description of solidly established laws of molecular physics. Nuclear physics, physics of elementary particles, evolve along the same lines. Epistemologically, it is tacitly required that, at each deeper and deeper description, the knowledge previously established on solid grounds is satisfactorily recovered at some adequate scale. Another paradigmatic example of the same path is general relativity which, in the G \u2192 0 limit, recovers special relativity, which in turn recovers, in the c \u2192 \u221e limit, Newtonian mechanics. Analogously, quantum mechanics recovers, in the ~\u2192 0 limit, Newtonian mechanics. On the experimental world, optic microscopy was improved by electronic microscopy, in turn improved by scanning probe microscopy, and so on. The celebrated sentence \u201cIf I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants\u201d that Isaac Newton included in his letter to Robert Hooke dramatically illustrates that same path. This is essentially how, along the years and centuries, the progress of sciences proceeds along the footprints of what was previously established on reliable bases.\nIn the realm of statistical mechanics, where the concept of coarse graining, hence of changements of scales, plays a foundational role, a similar path is being followed since its formulation in the XIXth century, and also along the last three-four decades. The pioneering works of Boltzmann and Gibbs [1\u20133] established, upon undeniably solid bases, a magnificent theory which is structurally associated with the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropic functional\nSBG = \u2212k W\u2211 i=1 pi ln pi ( W\u2211 i=1 pi = 1) , (1)\nand consistent expressions for continuous or quantum variables, k being a conventional positive constant adopted once forever (in physics, k is chosen to be the Boltzmann constant kB ; in information theory and computational sciences, it is frequently adopted k = 1).\nIn the simple case of equal probabilities, this entropic functional is given by SBG = k lnW . Eq. (1) is generically additive [4]. Indeed, if A and B are two probabilistically independent systems (i.e., pA+Bij = p A i p B j ), we straightforwardly verify that SBG(A+B) = SBG(A) +SBG(B). This celebrated entropic functional is consistent with thermodynamics\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n03 26\n1v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 1\n4 A\npr 2\n02 3\n2 for all systems whose N elements are either independent or weakly interacting in the sense that only basically local (in space/time) interactions are involved. For example, if we have equal probabilities and the system is such that the number of accessible microscopic configurations is given by W (N) \u221d \u00b5N (\u00b5 > 1; N \u2192\u221e), then SBG(N) is extensive as required by thermodynamics. Indeed SBG(N) = k lnW (N) \u223c k(ln\u00b5)N . But if the correlations are nonlocal in space/time, SBG may become thermodynamically inadequate. Such is the case of equal probabilities with say W (N) \u221d N\u03bd (\u03bd > 0; N \u2192 \u221e): it immediately follows SBG(N) \u221d lnN , which violates thermodynamical extensivity. To satisfactorily approach cases such as this one, it was proposed in 1988 [5\u20138] to build a more general statistical mechanics based on the nonadditive entropic functional\nSq \u2261 k 1\u2212\n\u2211W i=1 p q i\nq \u2212 1 = k W\u2211 i=1 pi lnq 1 pi = \u2212k W\u2211 i=1 pqi lnq pi = \u2212k W\u2211 i=1 pi ln2\u2212q pi (q \u2208 R;S1 = SBG) , (2)\nwith lnq z \u2261 z 1\u2212q\u22121 1\u2212q (ln1 z = ln z) and its inverse e z q \u2261 [1 + (1 \u2212 q)z] 1/(1\u2212q) + ; (e z 1 = e z; [z]+ = z if z > 0 and vanishes otherwise); for q < 0, it is necessary to exclude from the sum the terms with vanishing pi. We easily verify that equal probabilities yield Sq = k lnqW , and that generically we have\nSq(A+B) k = Sq(A) k + Sq(B) k + (1\u2212 q)Sq(A) k Sq(B) k , (3)\nhence\nSq(A+B) = Sq(A) + Sq(B) + 1\u2212 q k Sq(A)Sq(B) . (4)\nConsequently, in the (1\u2212q)/k \u2192 0 limit, we recover the SBG additivity. For the anomalous class of systems mentioned above, namely W (N) \u221d N\u03bd , we obtain, \u2200\u03bd, the extensive entropy S1\u22121/\u03bd(N) = k ln1\u22121/\u03bdW (N) \u221d N , as required by the Legendre structure of thermodynamics (see [8\u201310] and references therein).\nAt this point let us remind that a general entropic functional SG({pi}) is defined as trace-form if it can be written as SG = k \u2211W i=1 f(pi) \u2261 k \u2211W i=1 pi g(pi). A G-generalized logarithm can be defined as g(pi) \u2261 lnG(1/pi). Consequently SG = k\u3008\u03c3i\u3009, where \u03c3i \u2261 lnG(1/pi) is the surprise [11] or unexpectedness [12]; \u03c3(p) is assumed to monotonically increase, when pi decreases from 1 to 0, from 0 to its maximum value (which may be infinity). Only trace-form entropies can be written as the mean value of a surprise.\nMoreover, an entropic functional S({pi}; {\u03b7}) is said composable if it satisfies, for two probabilistically independent systems A and B, the property S(A+B)k = F ( S(A) k , S(B) k ; {\u03b7}), where {\u03b7} is a set of fixed indices characterizing the functional (e.g., for Sq, it is {\u03b7} \u2261 q ); we use the notation {0} to indicate absence of any such index. F (x, y; {\u03b7}) is a smooth function of (x, y) which depends on a (typically small) set of universal indices {\u03b7} defined in such a way that F (x, y; {0}) = x + y (additivity), which corresponds to the BG entropy. Additionally, F (x, y; {\u03b7}) is assumed to satisfy F (x, 0; {\u03b7}) = x (null-composability), F (x, y; {\u03b7}) = F (y, x; {\u03b7}) (symmetry), F (x, F (y, z; {\u03b7}); {\u03b7}) = F (F (x, y; {\u03b7}), z; {\u03b7}) (associativity) (see details and thermodynamical motivation in [8, 10]).\nWe specially focus here on Sq because the Enciso-Tempesta theorem [13] proves that this entropic functional is the unique one which is simultaneously trace-form, composable, and contains SBG as a particular case.\nIn the present paper, we numerically exhibit the above mentioned epistemological path on the time evolution of Sq(t) associated with the paradigmatic one-dimensional dissipative logistic map. Through appropriate scaling of successively finer partitions of the phase-space into W equal windows, we verify that, for both strong and weak chaos, properties such as the entropy production per unit time and related phenomenology are satisfied.\nThe logistic map is defined as follows:\nxt+1 = 1\u2212 ax2t (xt \u2208 [\u22121, 1]; a \u2208 [0, 2]; t = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7) . (5)\nDepending on the value of the external parameter a, the corresponding Lyapunov exponent \u03bb can be positive, negative or zero. When \u03bb > 0 we say that the system is strongly chaotic: the simplest, and strongest, such case emerges for a = 2, which implies \u03bb = ln 2 > 0. When \u03bb = 0 and the corresponding value of a, noted ac, is located at the accumulation point of successive bifurcations, we say that the system is weakly chaotic. The most studied such points occur at the edge of chaos, more precisely, at the so-called Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser point, with ac = 1.40115518909205 . . .. In all cases, if we start from initial conditions such that the entropy nearly vanishes at t = 0, we observe that, for all values of q, Sq tends to increase (not necessarily in a monotonic manner) as time increases. But it tends to increase linearly (thus providing a finite entropy production per unit time) only for an unique value of\n3 the index q. For a = 2, the entropy which linearly increases with time, thus yielding a finite entropy production per unit time (satisfying the Pesin identity for the entropy production per unit time KBG \u2261 limt\u2192\u221e SBG(t)/t = \u03bb), is SBG. In contrast, at the edge of chaos, the entropy which linearly increases with time is Sq with q = qc \u2261 0.24448770134128 . . .. In fact, depending on the initial conditions, there are infinitely many such linearities (see [14\u201317] and references therein). This is why we present here the corresponding mean values over a natural set of initial conditions, similarly to what has been calculated in [19]."

We denote {pi} (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,W ) the occupancy probabilities of all W windows. At t = 0, we have pj = 1 for the selected window, and pi 6=j = 0 for all the other (W \u2212 1) windows. Consequently Sq(t) satisfies Sq(0) = 0 ,\u2200q. For a = 2, the only value of q for which we have a linear growth while approaching saturation is q = 1 (this procedure was initially proposed in [18]). We then repeat the operation for each one of the W windows, and finally average the data for Sq: see Figs. 1 and 2.\n4 We apply the same numerical procedure described above for a = ac: see Figs. 3, 4 and 5.\nBefore concluding, let us emphasize that the robustness of the peaks in the time evolution of the entropy Sq at a = ac has been numerically verified under four different circumstances, namely with regard to (i) the number of initial conditions within each one of the W windows (Fig. 6); (ii) the precision used in the value of ac (bottom-right plot in Fig. 3); (iii) variations of the occupancy of phase space in the neighborhood of the multifractal attractor at a = ac (Fig. 7); (iv) variations of the map (Fig. 8)."

            "text": "At this point, a few comments are certainly timely concerning the most distinguished non-trace-form entropic functional, namely the Renyi one [21]\nSRq \u2261 k ln \u2211W i=1 p q i\n1\u2212 q = k ln[1 + (1\u2212 q)Sq/k] 1\u2212 q (q \u2208 R; SR1 = S1 = SBG) , (6)\nhence\nSRq /k = ln e Sq/k q (7)\nand\nSq/k = lnq e SRq /k (8)\nThis additive (hence composable) entropic functional is, \u2200q, a monotonic function of Sq, hence, under the same constraints, it is optimized by the same distribution which optimizes Sq. However, in contrast with Sq which is\n5 concave for all q > 0, SRq is concave only for 0 < q \u2264 1. In addition to that, Sq is Lesche-stable for all q > 0, whereas SRq has this important experimental robustness only for its particular instance q = 1 [22\u201324]. Moreover, if we consider the present nontrivial case a = ac, we have that, in the W \u2192\u221e limit, SRqc(t) = k ln[1+(1\u2212qc)Sqc (t)/k]\n1\u2212qc \u221d ln t for t 1. Consequently, there is no constant finite Renyi-entropy production per unit time and, consistently, no Pesin-like identities can exist. Analogously, if we consider the stationary-state of a N -body system belonging to the previously mentioned anomalous class W (N) \u221d N\u03c1, we have that SRq (N) \u221d lnN for any q < 1. In other words, SRq (N) appears to be nonextensive and the Legendre structure of thermodynamics is therefore violated.\nIt is worthy to mention that composability is not necessary for a finite entropy production per unit time to exist (thus possibly qualifying for a Pesin-like identity to be satisfied). Such is the case, for instance, of the Kaniadakis entropy [25] which is nonadditive, non-composable, trace-form, and yields nevertheless a finite entropy production per unit time.\nThe relevant influence of the precision used in the calculations has been exhibited as well: see Fig. 9. More specifically, the use of simple, double or quadruple precision sensibly enhances the overshooting of the time evolution of the entropy Sqc(t) at the Feigenbaum point. To reinforce these results, it would of course be necessary to use values of ac and of qc with consistently higher precision when W increases. Still, the present indications are already clear enough.\nLet us conclude by focusing on a relevant result of the present study. Our numerical simulations strongly indicate\nthat, for both strong and weak chaos, the time behavior of Sq (q = 1 for a = 2 and q = qc for a = ac, respectively) at the W \u2192 \u221e limit, consists in a diverging linear increase with finite slope. However, an important distinction arises on how Sq(t) approaches its stationary-state value Sq(\u221e): it approaches from below for a = 2, which corresponds to\n8 the naive expectation, whereas it does so from above for a = ac, which might be considered as unexpected. This \u2013 a priori surprising \u2013 behavior is due to the fact that, for relatively early times during the present evolution at fixed W , the entropy system tends to approach its maximal value lnqW . However, for later times, the system approaches its asymptotic stationary state, which is not uniform (it is instead U -shaped for a = 2 and multifractal for a = ac).\nThe 2nd principle of thermodynamics is normally qualified for systems which are closed, very large, and for a generic initial situation. An intriguing question might arise: these conditions surely are necessary, but are they sufficient? Is there no need for also requiring a strongly chaotic internal dynamics (e.g., short-range interactions), which normally implies mixing and ergodicity for all or part of the system? At the light of the present results, this fundamental question appears to be an open one, surely deserving further study.\nWe acknowledge fruitful conversations with E.M.F. Curado and partial financial support by CNPq and Faperj (Brazilian agencies). We also acknowledge useful remarks from two anonymous referees which led to various numerical verifications of the robustness of the entropic peaks at the Feigenbaum point, thus enriching the manuscript.\n\u2217 Electronic address: tsallis@cbpf.br \u2020 Electronic address: ernesto@ufba.br\n[1] L.
