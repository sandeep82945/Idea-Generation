    "abstractText": "The research study aimed at providing an accurate low-dose benzene exposure assessment method, by validating diffusive monitoring techniques for benzene personal exposure measurements at workplaces where benzene concentrations are expected in the low ppb range, such as in the present-day chemical, petrochemical, foundry, and pharmaceutical industry. The project was aimed at addressing the need for a robust and fully validated method to perform personal exposure measurements considering that the occupational exposure limit value for benzene is going to be significantly lowered in the next few years. Diffusive sampling offers a reliable alternative to pumped sampling methods, intrinsic safety in potentially explosive atmospheres, lightness, and ease of use. In this study, the radiello\u00ae diffusive sampler, with the packed activated charcoal RAD130 adsorbing substrate [suitable for solvent desorption and analysis by highresolution gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (HRGC-FID)], was used. The experiments have been conducted following the ISO 23320 standard in the range from 0.005 to 0.1 ppm (16 to 320 \u03bcg/m), yielding a full validation of the sampling and analytical method. The sampler performances have fulfilled all requisites of the ISO 23320 standard, in particular: bias due to the selection of a non-ideal sorbent is lower than 10% (no significant back diffusion of benzene due to concentration change in the atmosphere); bias due to storage of samples for up to 2 months is lower than 10%; nominal uptake rate for benzene on RAD130 is 74.65 mL/min; and expanded uncertainty of the sampling and analytical method is 20.6%. The sampling and analytical method is therefore fit-forpurpose for the personal exposure measurements aimed at testing compliance with occupational exposure limit values for benzene. The method is also fit for short-duration exposure monitoring related to specific tasks, and other volatile organic compounds, usually found in the same workplaces, such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and some oxygenated compounds, have also been studied. In particular, n-hexane and isopropyl benzene, whose classification is currently under revision, can be efficiently monitored by this technique. OPEN ACCESS",

            "text": "Benzene has long been recognized as a hazardous chemical agent, a Category 1A carcinogen (H350) and a Category 1B mutagen (H340) in accordance with Article 2 (b) of Directive 98/24/EC (1) and Article 2 (a) and (b) of Directive 2004/37/EC (2), respectively. The 2004 directive set the 8-h time-weighted average (8 h-TWA) occupational exposure limit value (OELV) for benzene to 1 ppm (which corresponds to 3.25 mg/m3 at 293 K and 1,013 hPa). A \u201cskin notation\u201d is applied indicating that there is a substantial contribution to the total body burden possible via dermal exposure. In 2018, the European Chemicals Agency Risk Assessment Committee (ECHA RAC) adopted an opinion to set the benzene occupation exposure limit to 0.05 ppm by considering a weight of evidence-based estimated human LOAEC (lowest-observed-adverse-effect concentration) of 1 ppm for chromosomal damage in peripheral lymphocytes of workers, acknowledging an animal LOAEC of 1 ppm for chromosomal damage in peripheral lymphocytes and bone marrow, and using assessment factors (AF) following ECHA Guidance to account for uncertainties (3). Subsequently, the Working Party of Chemicals conducted an impact assessment and the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work (ACSH) revised the acceptable safe levels of workplace benzene exposure (4). In 2022, Directive (UE) 2022/431 (5) specified a new limit value for occupational exposure to benzene to improve the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and/or mutagens at work. The 8 h-TWA OEL was lowered from 1 ppm to 0.2 ppm (0.66 mg/m3) with the following transitional measures: the limit value is 1 ppm until 5 April 2024; it will decrease to 0.5 ppm (1.65 mg/m3) from 5 April 2024 until 5 April 2026; and it will be\u00a0 further decreased to 0.2 ppm thereafter. In some EU Member States, lower OEL values, additional short-term exposure limits (STEL), or biological limit values (BLV) are also applied.\nNotably, in parallel to this process, the industrial world also acknowledged the necessity to independently reassess the benzene OELV. North et\u00a0al. conducted an exhaustive literature review and evaluated the molecular modes of action (MoA) in benzene-driven pathologies (6). These data led to a MoA-based threshold proposal of 0.25 ppm (8 h-TWA) which the authors consider to be\u00a0associated with no significant residual cancer risk and also avoiding other adverse effects (7).\nRegardless, benzene is an essential chemical intermediate in many industrial syntheses including the manufacture of plastics, dyes, detergents, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Benzene, as a monoconstituent (CAS No 71\u201343-2), has over 100 active registrations as of 2022 under EU-REACH. Benzene is also a constituent/impurity in many substances. Presently, there are over 100 registered substances that have a benzene content in a range of 0.1\u20131.0% w/w, and approximately 100 substances that have a benzene content of higher than 1.0% w/w; mainly, these substances are gasoline, naphtha, distillates from coal tar, or other types of hydrocarbon mixtures.\nWorkers are primarily subject to benzene exposure at the workplace in the petroleum, metal foundry, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Between 1950 and 1960, occupational exposure to benzene was high with estimated typical benzene concentrations between 10 and 100 ppm (32\u2013320 mg/m3) or even higher than 100 ppm (320 mg/m3), as reported in the first epidemiological study conducted in the United\u00a0States by NIOSH (the Ohio Pliofilm rubber workers cohort) (8). More recent reports and literature reviews show that benzene concentration at the workplace is constantly decreasing. Recent publications confirm that occupational exposures to benzene in the EU are usually below 1 ppm (3.25 mg/m3) (9, 10). Studies performed in the oil refining industry in Italy and Sweden (11, 12) showed that workplace exposure is lower than 0.2 mg/m3 (0.06 ppm) for refinery employees during normal plant operation. Another Swedish study (13) delved deeper into specific worker scenarios and demonstrated that personal exposure to benzene in the oil refinery sector ranged from 0.15 to 1.2 mg/m3 (0.05 \u00f7 0.4 ppm) during plant maintenance operations.\nMany other studies could be\u00a0cited that lead to the conclusion that personal exposure to benzene by inhalation at the workplace is generally decreasing, mainly due to lower benzene content in the process stream, use of best available technologies, and changes in industrial practice aimed at limiting exposure, for example, the introduction of mandatory vapor recovery devices and procedures in bulk gasoline distribution operations.\nWhile industrial practice has reduced benzene exposure, the decreased OEL implies personal monitoring in a lower exposure concentration range to assure a safe working environment. Moreover, there is a need for high-quality data to perform reliable studies on benzene low-dose exposure and its possible health effects to support any dose-related considerations. In particular, the shape of low-concentration dose\u2013response functions and their implications for human health risk assessment should be\u00a0 investigated in order to investigate the hypothesis of non-linear dose\u2013response relationships at low exposure concentrations. In fact, whereas previous studies were based on extrapolated data (14), the aim of this study was to develop a validated standard method that allows monitoring of benzene covering the range from 0.0003 to at least 0.1 ppm (i.e., from 0.001 to at least 0.3 mg/m3) over an 8-h exposure duration, tested according to the proper and more recent European standards and to generate highquality data in a low-dose exposure range. The study has been developed by the Environmental Research Center of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SpA SB and was aimed at producing a fully validated sampling and analytical method fit for obtaining reliable personal exposure data for the oil and gas, foundry, chemical, and pharmaceutical industry employees.\nDiffusive sampling has been used as it can offer a dependable alternative to pumped sampling methods, with greater reliability and feasibility. Diffusive samplers, moreover, offer intrinsic safety in potentially explosive atmospheres, lightness, and ease of use for workers and industrial hygiene operators. Furthermore, they are\nFrontiers in Public Health 03 frontiersin.org\nsuitable for measurement times longer than 8 h (up to 12-h shift times) because they do not need any power source to be\u00a0operated. Benzene air concentration is currently measured in diverse environmental settings by diffusive techniques, for example, by the radial symmetry diffusive sampler radiello\u00ae, developed and produced by the Environmental Research Center of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri, Padova, Italy. In particular, two alternative configurations of the sampler can be\u00a0used for workplace monitoring of benzene (along with a number of other gasoline constituents, such as aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons, and some oxygenated compounds):\n(a) RAD130, packed with activated charcoal, suitable for solvent desorption with carbon disulfide and analysis by highresolution gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection or mass spectrometric detection; (b) RAD145, packed with graphitised charcoal, suitable for thermal desorption by a two-stage thermal desorption apparatus and analysis by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection or mass spectrometric detection.\nThe proposed radial symmetry diffusive sampling devices have been already used for environmental, indoor, and workplace monitoring, showing high sensitivity in comparison with axial diffusive samplers, which are usually characterized by lower uptake rate values (15\u201319). The current applicable international standard for the validation of a diffusive sampling method is EN ISO 23320:2022 (20). The activated charcoal sampler RAD130 had been validated for workplace monitoring before the EN ISO 23320:2022 standard was issued, but validation was performed in a concentration range higher than the presently addressed one. RAD145, on the other hand, had been validated in the proper measurement range for indoor air quality measurements upon exposure time durations of 4.5 to 7 days, but not as extensively as needed for complying with the EN ISO 23320:2022 standard when exposure times of 8 h are concerned. The two sampling and analysis methods were originally developed in compliance with Health and Safety Executive (HSE-UK) Methods for the Determination of Hazardous Substances MDHS88 (21) and MDHS80 (22), respectively.\nThe full validation of the RAD130 sampler, for benzene monitoring covering the range from 0.0003 to at least 0.1 ppm1 (0.001 to at least 0.3 mg/m3) over an 8-h exposure, is described here. The proposed method is tested to demonstrate whether it is fit for the generation of high-quality data concerning personal monitoring in a low-dose occupational exposure range in the chemical, petrochemical, foundry, and pharmaceutical industries, whereas previous studies were based on extrapolated data. The relevant novelty consists in the method being fit for the purpose of benzene exposure measurements in workplaces where its concentration is expected to be\u00a0in the low ppb range. The method relies upon radial geometry diffusive samplers,"

The samplers are very lightweight and negligibly encumbering operators even when busy with demanding tasks in the production plants. Additionally, uncertainty measurement calculations and results, and a summary of experimental results concerning other gasoline constituents, such as n-hexane, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers, and isopropyl benzene, are provided.

In order to achieve monitoring methods reliable for low-dose exposure studies, the entire experimental procedure has been developed by assuming a reference value (RV) for benzene of 0.05 ppm (0.16 mg/m3 or 160 \u03bcg/m3), coinciding with the concentration value proposed by RAC in 2018. The employed analytical method (solvent desorption and high-resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detection [HRGC-FID] for RAD130) has been accredited within our facility (Environmental Research Center of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri IRCCS Spa SB) according to ISO IEC 17025 Standard (24)."

Exposure is completed when the diffusive membrane is unscrewed from the supporting plate and the adsorbing substrate is placed in the glass tube, capped with the PE stopper, and identified by the provided barcode label.\nExperimental tests are performed in an exposure chamber that allows the simultaneous exposure of up to 24 diffusive samplers at a time. The chamber, shown in Figure\u00a01, is an air-tight container inside which the airflow follows a ring-shaped path, equipped with suitable devices for control of the air\u2019s concentration level, temperature, relative humidity, and velocity. Air velocity is controlled by two fans installed inside the chamber that allow air velocities ranging from 0.5 m\u00b7s\u22121 to 2 m\u00b7s\u22121. The inner walls of the chamber are lined with polytetrafluoroethylene, and the upper lid is made of glass. The gas mixture continuously delivered to the exposure chamber is produced by dilution of a certified gas mixture (purchased by Nippon Gasses Belgium NV) containing benzene and 24 other volatile organic\nFrontiers in Public Health 04 frontiersin.org\ncompounds (VOCs) at the concentrations shown in Table\u00a0 1. The samplers, therefore, are simultaneously exposed to benzene and to other VOCs usually encountered at the oil and gas workplace. The mixture is diluted by a two-stage dilution system composed of critical orifices and mass flow controllers (customized design and production by LNI Swissgas, Versoix, Switzerland), which is fit for dynamic generation of gas mixtures of different concentration levels from a single cylinder, providing dilution ratios of 1:100 to 1:10,000. The dilution system is calibrated by the manufacturer, which is an ISO 17025-accredited laboratory for the measurement of gaseous flow rates. Dilution gasses are research-grade nitrogen and synthetic air purchased from SOL SpA, Italy.\nWater vapor is directly introduced in the chamber, following a separate line with respect to the VOC-gas mixture. Liquid water, contained in a pressurized reservoir, is pushed through an evaporator and then into the chamber. The relative humidity in the chamber can be\u00a0 regulated from 5 to 95%. It is continuously monitored by a capacitive probe Rotronic, Hygroclip SC04 (combined humidity and temperature sensors).\nTemperature is controlled by two finned heat exchangers. The temperature of the liquid flowing through the heat exchangers is regulated by a Heto HMT 200 thermostat with a CBN 8\u201330 recirculating bath that allows generating air temperature in the chamber from \u22125\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. A Pt100 probe, Hygroclip SC04, continuously monitors temperature. Humidity and temperature probes are calibrated against a Delta Ohm HD21AB17 instrument (for relative humidity: capacitive probe, 0.1% resolution, \u00b12% accuracy; for temperature: NTC thermocouple, resolution 0.1\u00b0C, accuracy \u00b10.2\u00b0C). Humidity and temperature probes are connected to a Keithley multimeter, and data are recorded continuously (one reading\nevery 10 s) and then processed in order to obtain average temperature and relative humidity over each exposure duration."

This is accomplished by adding to the sample 2.0 mL of carbon disulfide (low benzene content, Honeywell cat. 342,270) directly into the tube, followed by 100 \u03bcL of internal standard solution (2-fluorotoluene, purity \u226599.9% Aldrich cat. F15323, diluted to 0.1 mg/mL with carbon disulfide). The analysis is accomplished by HRGC with split mode injection and FID, with an HP-PONA column (Agilent J&W 19091S001) or equivalent, 50 m long, with 200 \u03bcm internal diameter and 0.5 \u03bcm film thickness. Calibration standards are prepared by weighing and diluting known amounts of high-purity benzene (\u2265 99.9%, SigmaAldrich cat. 12,540) with carbon disulfide in the concentration range from 0.05 to 25 \u03bcg/mL (the calibration curve is prepared also for other VOCs, in the range from 0.16 to 80 \u03bcg/mL). Analytical recovery tests have been performed at three loading levels for benzene and all the other VOCs; a summary of the results is displayed in Table\u00a02. Analytical recovery is well above the minimum value of 75% for all components at all levels, with a coefficient of variation lower than 10% (as required in paragraph 6.3.2.1 of ISO 23320 standard). Anyway, the calibration procedure is always performed, in our laboratory, by phase-equilibrium method: 2.0 mL of each calibration solution is added to a blank RAD130, followed by 100 \u03bcL of internal standard solution, and then, the same procedure is applied as to the actual samples. Therefore, analytical recovery values are already taken into account.\nFIGURE\u00a01 Experimental exposure chamber set-up.\nFrontiers in Public Health 05 frontiersin.org\nThe concentration of the generated gas mixture delivered to the exposure chamber is verified by sampling onto activated charcoal tubes at 100 mL/min and subsequent determination of the benzene content of each tube by the MDHS96 method described in Health and Safety Executive (UK) (25).\nSampling was performed on six tubes during each 8-h experiment (three replicate tubes for the initial 4 h, three for the final 4 h). Sampling pumps used throughout this experimental study are Gilian LFS-113 low-flow air sampling pumps, manufactured by Sensidyne, Clearwater, Florida, United\u00a0States, with operating flow range from 5 to 200 mL/min (constant flow mode). Charcoal tubes for all experiments were produced in-house by packing borosilicate glass tubes with two sections (front section, 350 mg; back, 150 mg) of activated charcoal for chromatography, particle size 0.3\u20130.5 mm (35\u201350 mesh), preconditioned by the manufacturer (the same used for RAD130 samplers). Analysis of activated charcoal tubes has been performed by transferring the charcoal substrate of each section to a glass tube, adding 2 mL of carbon disulfide and 100 \u03bcL of internal standard solution, vortexing for 30 s and leaving in contact for 30 min, then transferring the solution to autosampler vials (screw cap with PTFE lined septa, 2 mL), and submitting to HRGC-FID.

            "text": "Reference concentration, overall sampler uptake, leak test\nThe validation procedure for a diffusive sampler according to ISO 23320 standard is subject to some prerequisites concerning the reference concentration delivered to the exposure chamber. Target compound concentration has to be\u00a0 measured by an independent method to verify that the actual concentration (Cmeas) is within \u00b110% with respect to the expected one (Cref, which is calculated by the flow rate ratios in the dilution system, see ISO 23320\u00a0in paragraph 7.4.2.1 and 7.4.2.3). Benzene concentration values, measured by the independent method described before and compared to expected values, are displayed in Table\u00a03, showing satisfactory agreement for all experiments performed at 20\u00b0C and relative humidity of 50%. When measuring at 20% relative humidity and low concentration (0.1 RV, 17.4 \u03bcg/m3), we\u00a0 observed a 21% difference between expected and measured concentration, and also when measuring at 80% relative humidity and high concentration (2 RV, 312 \u03bcg/m3), we\u00a0observed a 12% difference between expected and measured concentration. Since no information is given, however, about method recovery at high or low humidity in the MDHS96 method described in Health and Safety Executive (UK) (25), or concerning measurement uncertainty component associated with relative humidity, we\u00a0considered that good agreement between the target and measured concentration shown by experiments performed at 20\u00b0C and relative humidity of 50% demonstrates sufficiently accurate delivery of the target concentration to the exposure chamber in all cases. Reference concentration is therefore assumed to coincide with the expected value, derived from mass flow values controlled by the LNI Sonimix gas dilution apparatus, in all subsequent calculations.\nThe ISO 23320 standard requires also that the overall sampling uptake by all diffusive samplers, added to the sampling rate of the independent method (either by online measurement instrumentation or, as in the present case, by pumped sampling), shall not represent more than 75% of the overall gas flow delivered to the exposure chamber, in order to ensure concentration stability at the reference value and no \u201cstarvation\u201d effect due to the presence of diffusive samplers. In the experimental set-up described here, the flow rate in the exposure chamber ranges from 15 to 26 L/min depending on the desired concentration. Assuming the lowest flow rate value (15 L/min) and the case of 24 RAD130 and three pumped samplers simultaneously present in an experiment, the combined uptake rate of diffusive samplers (for benzene 74.6 mL/min on RAD130) and sampling flow of pumped samplers (100 mL/min) sums to approximately 2.1 L/min. The combined flow rate of all samplers therefore is equal to 14% of the overall flow rate of the gaseous mixture delivered to the exposure chamber, so the prerequisite is fulfilled (14% < 75%).\nSamplers used for workplace exposure monitoring, implying separate sampling and analytical steps (defined as \u201ctype A\u201d samplers by the ISO 23320 standard), should demonstrate an analytical blank value, which is compatible with the monitoring purpose, i.e., less than"

Results are shown in Table\u00a04 (benzene sampled mass md,\nreference exposure concentration Cref, exposure time te, uptake rate Ue, average uptake rate, and its coefficient of variation CV).\nStorage after sampling and bias due to the selection of a non-ideal sorbent\nThe stability of samples upon storage has been studied as described in paragraph 8.3.1.3.1 of ISO 23320 standard, by exposing six sets of six replicate samples in the conditions shown in Table\u00a05. As it is known that samples exposed to high humidity levels (both in ambient or workplace air) may show worse stability upon storage, the ISO 23320 standard requires to perform exposure at high humidity (80 \u00b1 5%). Storage was performed in a refrigerator, free from solvents or other chemicals, at 4 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Two concentration levels were tested, corresponding to 0.1 RV and 2 RV, exposure time was 6 h. For each concentration level, 18 replicate RAD130 samplers were exposed, and then, 6 replicate samplers were analyzed within 24 h from exposure, 6 more replicate samplers were analyzed after 1 month, and the last 6 samples were analyzed after 2 months from exposure. The results are listed in Table\u00a06 for the experiment at 0.1 OELV and at 2 RV (average benzene sampled mass md recovered within each group of replicate samplers by analysis within 24 h, after 30 days and after 65 days, percentage difference upon storage). As stated in paragraph 6.3.1.4 of ISO 23320 standard, the mean value of the recovered mass after storage should not differ by more than 10% from the value before storage, this requisite is fulfilled for storage at 4 \u00b1 2\u00b0C for up to 2 months (65 days).\nDiffusive samplers exposed to rapidly changing concentrations of the target chemicals can be\u00a0 affected by backdiffusion phenomena if a non-ideal sorbent is used. A test is therefore foreseen in the ISO 23320 standard in order to estimate the maximum bias that can be\u00a0encountered in a real non-constant atmosphere, and the requisite (stated in paragraph 6.3.1.2 of the standard) is that bias measured in the experimental set-up described in the following should not be\u00a0higher than 10%. Two sets of six replicate samplers were exposed for 45 min to a benzene concentration corresponding to 2 RV (actual value 290.5 \u03bcg/m3), then one set was removed from the atmosphere and the other was exposed for a further 430 min to pure air. During the whole experiment, average temperature and relative humidity were 20.7\u00b0C and 77.1%, respectively. The two sample sets were then analyzed, and the results are shown in Table\u00a07 (sampled mass for each replicate sampler, average sampled mass for the two groups, percentage difference). The difference between the means is 2.1%, and the requirement is then fulfilled. Moreover, Student\u2019s t-test has been applied to the two populations (calculations not shown). The null hypothesis is zero difference between the two means, the significance value is 0.05, and the chosen t-test is the two-tail case with unequal variance within the two populations. The result is as follows: t-stat is equal to \u22122.1885 and comprised between \u2013 t critical and + t critical (\u22122.3060 < \u22122.1885 < 2.3060); therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be\u00a0 rejected on the basis of the experimental data. We\u00a0 can therefore conclude that the average benzene adsorbed mass is not significantly different between the two groups of samplers (exposed, or not, to zero air).\nExposure at 2 RV for 45 min yields an average benzene sampled mass of 0.936 \u03bcg, corresponding to a measured concentration of 278.6 \u03bcg/m3 (by calculations based upon the nominal uptake rate value of 74.65 mL/min). The ratio between measured and reference concentration (290.5 \u03bcg/m3) yields a method recovery of 0.959, and a method bias of 2.2% (see following paragraphs for a discussion of these parameters).

The combined standard uncertainty uc, expressed as a percentage, is calculated according to Equations (3\u20135):\nu u us s sr nr= +\n2 2\n(3)\nu u ua a ar nr= +\n2 2\n(4)\nu u uc s a= + 2 2\n(5)\nwhere us = sampling uncertainty usr = random sampling uncertainty usnr = non-random sampling uncertainty ua = analytical uncertainty uar = random analytical uncertainty uanr = non-random analytical uncertainty The expanded uncertainty of the measuring procedure U, expressed as a percentage, is calculated using a coverage factor k = 2 (see ISO 23320, paragraphs 8.4.2.6 and 8.4.3) according to Equation (6):\n2 cU u= \u22c5 (6)\nThe following contributions due to sampling and analytical steps have been considered for uncertainty estimation: concerning the sampling, uncertainty associated with mass uptake, sampling efficiency, and sample storage; concerning analysis, uncertainty associated with method recovery, method variability, calibration, and response drift.\nUncertainty associated with mass uptake (uptake rate and sampling time)\nFor diffusive sampling, mass uptake has the following sources of uncertainty: uptake rate and sampling time.\nThe random and non-random uncertainty components associated with the uptake rate have been estimated from the results of the replicate samples collected from the test atmosphere experiment carried out to determine the nominal uptake rate (data displayed in Table\u00a04).\nThe random and non-random uncertainty components associated with the uptake rate are given by Equation B1 (for the definition of each term, see Annex B of ISO 23320 standard, paragraph B.2.2):\nu\nK n uur v r rc= ( ) + ( ), 2 2\n(B1)\nIn our experiment, the number of replicate samples n is 6 and the coefficient of variation Kv,r is 0.48%. The uncertainty associated with the reference concentration of the test atmosphere urc has been calculated by considering the uncertainty associated with benzene concentration in the cylinder gas mixture and the uncertainty associated with mass flow measurements within the dilution system used to feed the exposure chamber, the result is urc = 3.6% from 0.1 to 2 RV (i.e., from 16 to 320 \u03bcg/m3). Applying Equation (B1), we\u00a0 obtain that uncertainty associated with the uptake rate uur is equal to 3.6%.\nSampling time is recorded to the nearest minute, so the maximum bias is 0.5 min at both the start and end of the experiment. The shortest experiments we\u00a0performed imply a sampling duration of 60 min; by summing the maximum biases and dividing by 60 min and by \u221a6 (assuming a triangular probability distribution), we\u00a0 obtain that uncertainty associated with sampling time is 0.7%.\nUncertainty associated with sampling efficiency (back diffusion and exposure time)\nFollowing the approach outlined in paragraph B.3.1\u00a0in Annex B of the ISO 23320 standard, and assuming a rectangular probability distribution, the uncertainty associated with back diffusion ubd is given by \u0394bd /\u221a3 where \u0394bd is the difference, in percent, between the mean results of replicate samples listed in Table\u00a07, equal to 2.1%.

Assuming a rectangular probability distribution, the uncertainty associated with exposure time ute is given by ute = \u0394te/\u221a3 where \u0394te is the highest difference between the mean results of replicate samples collected from test atmospheres at different exposure times, in percent. In the present case, the highest difference has been observed between the mean concentrations measured at 1 RV upon sampling for 4 h and 1 h, equal to 2.4%. The non-random uncertainty component associated with exposure duration is therefore equal to 1.4%.\nFrontiers in Public Health 11 frontiersin.org\nUncertainty associated with sample storage\nThe non-random uncertainty component associated with sample storage has been estimated, as described in paragraph B.4\u00a0in Annex B of the ISO 23320 standard, by the analysis of replicate samples listed in Table\u00a0 6 (exposure time 6 h; atmosphere concentration 0.1 RV and 2 RV; relative humidity 80%; analysis within 24 h, after 30 days and after 65 days). Assuming a rectangular probability distribution, the uncertainty associated with sample storage ust is given by equation ust = \u0394st/\u221a3 where \u0394st is the difference between the mean results of replicate samples analyzed immediately after sampling and replicate samples analyzed after the maximum storage time, in percent. In the present case, the difference (for storage of 65 days at a temperature of 4\u00b0C, in a clean refrigerator, free from solvents or other volatile organic compounds) is equal to 7.7% at 0.1 RV and 2.5% at 2 RV. The worst-case non-random uncertainty component associated with sample storage, corresponding to the experiment at 0.1 RV, is therefore equal to (7.7/\u221a3) %, which is 4.4%.\nUncertainty associated with method recovery\nThe experimental data collected when carrying out the tests whose results are displayed in Table\u00a0 9, tests # from 1 to 13, give representative information about the factors causing variation and bias (relative to a reference concentration value) that occur in routine applications of the specified method of measurement, such as exposure time, concentration, relative humidity, and temperature. The uncertainty associated with exposure time has been already estimated; in the present section, we\u00a0will show how uncertainty contributions due to concentration (method bias), relative humidity, and temperature are estimated.\nMethod bias is calculated from the results of the replicate samplers collected upon exposure for 4 h at 50% relative humidity, 20\u00b0C temperature, and benzene concentration of 0.1 RV, 0.5 RV, and 2 RV (see Table\u00a08, tests # 4, 5, and 7).\nFor each concentration value, the non-random uncertainty associated with the method bias umb is calculated according to Equation B2 (for the definition of each term see the Annex B of ISO 23320 standard, paragraph B.5.3):\nu B k K n umb m v rm rc=       + ( ) + ( ) 2 2 2,\n(B2)\nIn our experiment, the number of replicate samples n is 6 and the coverage factor k used in the calculation of the expanded uncertainty is 2. Method bias Bm and coefficient of variation Kv,rm are calculated at each level from the experimental data shown in Table\u00a09, tests # 4, 5, and 7. The uncertainty associated with the reference concentration of the test atmosphere urc has already been considered within uncertainty associated with uptake rate (see Equation B1), method bias at each concentration level is therefore calculated according to Equation B3 and displayed in Table\u00a010.\nu K nmb m v rm=       + ( )B 2 2 2 ,\n(B3)\nIn order to calculate the expanded uncertainty of the measurement procedure, we\u00a0consider the worst-case estimate, corresponding to 1.9% at 0.1 RV, to be\u00a0valid in the entire applicability range.\nThe non-random uncertainty component associated with the effect of humidity has been estimated from the difference between the mean results of replicate samples collected from the test atmospheres at 80 and 20% relative humidity, and at 0.1 RV and 2 RV (data displayed in Table\u00a09, tests # 8, 9, 10, and 11). At 0.1 RV, the difference between the means at 20 and 80% relative humidity is 3.4%; at 2 RV, the difference between the means at 20 and 80% relative humidity is 9.0%. Assuming a rectangular probability distribution, the uncertainty associated with the effect of humidity uh is given by \u0394h/\u221a3 where \u0394h is the higher of the previously defined differences, that is 9.0%. The worst-case non-random uncertainty component associated with humidity is therefore equal to 5.2%.\nThe non-random uncertainty component associated with the effect of temperature has been estimated from the difference between the mean results of replicate samples collected from the test atmospheres at temperatures of 10\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C (actually, at 11.4 and 38.0\u00b0C), and at concentrations of 2 RV (data displayed in Table\u00a09, tests # 12 and 13). Assuming a rectangular probability distribution, the uncertainty associated with the effect of temperature uT is given by \u0394T/\u221a3 where \u0394T is the difference between the mean results of replicate samples collected from the described test atmospheres, equal to 4.1%. The uncertainty component associated with the effect of temperature is equal to 2.4%.\nUncertainty associated with method variability\nMethod precision is calculated from the results of the replicate samples collected upon exposure for 4 h in test atmospheres at 0.1 RV, 0.5 RV, 1 RV, and 2 RV, with relative humidity of 50% and temperature of 20\u00b0C (data displayed in Table\u00a09, test # 4, 5, 6 and 7).

The results are shown in Table\u00a011, and ump is equal to 2.01% over the measurement range from 0.1 to 2 RV (i.e., from 16 to 320 \u03bcg/m3).\nUncertainty associated with the analytical procedure\nUncertainty contribution associated with calibration solutions has been calculated within the validation procedure of the analytical method by applying a metrological approach to the procedure for preparing the calibration solutions (by weighing and dilution, using a calibrated balance with extended uncertainty of 0.14 mg in the measurement range around 20 g, and calibrated glassware with volume tolerances of \u00b10.4% for flasks and \u00b1 0.8% for pipets). We\u00a0obtain that the uncertainty contribution associated with the preparation of calibration solutions is equal to 1.7%.\nThe random uncertainty component associated with the calibration function is calculated from parameters obtained by applying the leastsquares linear (or second-order polynomial) regression, as outlined in Ellison and Williams (26). It varies as a function of the sampled mass value; therefore, combined analytical uncertainty also varies with sampled mass value in the applicability range; data are shown in Table\u00a012 (including the uncertainty component due to instrumental response drift, described hereby in the following).\nInstrument response drift is considered by introducing a 5% maximum instrument response drift allowance (dmax) before recalibration. Quality control standards are injected every 20 samples (after the complete calibration curve, injected once a month if QC requisites are met). The non-random uncertainty component due to instrumental drift udr, therefore, is estimated by assuming a rectangular probability distribution and corresponds to udr = dmax /\u221a3, which is equal to 2.9%.\nAs benzene sampled mass upon exposure of RAD130 sampler at 0.1 RV (i.e., 16 \u03bcg/m3) for 8 h corresponds to 0.57 \u03bcg, and obviously exposure for 8 h at higher concentrations will increase sampled mass, we\u00a0consider that maximum analytical uncertainty to be\u00a0taken into account for 8-h measurements in the studied range between 0.1 and 2 RV is 3.9%, as can be\u00a0seen in Table\u00a012. This value will be\u00a0introduced in the following calculations.\nAnalytical precision can be\u00a0estimated using repeatability data, obtained by injecting replicate samples at different concentration levels within the method applicability range. However, as method variability is estimated according to equation (B4), the contribution of the analytical precision is already included as explained in paragraph B.6.7.1 of the ISO 23320 standard.\nCalculation of combined standard uncertainty and expanded uncertainty\nTo calculate the random and non-random components of sampling and analytical uncertainty, the relevant individual uncertainty components are combined according to Equations (3\u20135), and then, the expanded uncertainty of the measuring procedure is calculated by using a coverage factor of 2 as outlined in Equation (6). The components to be\u00a0included in the calculations have been previously described and are summarized in Table\u00a013. We\u00a0can therefore calculate random and non-random contributions to sampling uncertainty, and by combining random and non-random contributions, we\u00a0obtain that uncertainty associated with sampling is as follows:\nusr = + + =3 6 0 7 2 0 4 2 2 2 2 . . . . %\nusnr = + + + + + + =3 6 1 2 1 4 4 4 1 9 5 2 2 4 8 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 . . . . . . . . %\nus = + =4 2 8 5 9 5 2 2 . . . %\nBy combining sampling and analytical uncertainty contributions, we\u00a0obtain\nuc = + =9 5 3 9 10 3 2 2 . . . %\nBy applying a coverage factor of 2, we\u00a0obtain expanded uncertainty:\nUe = 20 6. %\nOther gasoline VOC components: determination of nominal uptake rate, study of method performances, uncertainty calculations\nThe above-described method can be\u00a0applied to determine the air concentration of several VOC gasoline components.

            "text": "A sampling and analytical method has been validated that allows workplace monitoring of benzene covering the low concentration range\n(from 0.005 to 0.1 ppm, 16 to 320 \u03bcg/m3) over an 8-h exposure duration, tested according to the proper and most recent European standard, EN ISO 23320:2022\u2013\u201cWorkplace air\u2013Gasses and vapors\u2013Requirements for evaluation of measuring procedures using diffusive samplers.\u201d The proposed method is fit for the generation of high-quality data concerning personal monitoring in a low-dose occupational exposure range in the chemical, petrochemical, foundry, and pharmaceutical industries, whereas previous studies were based on extrapolated data.\nThe relative extended uncertainty of the sampling and analytical method is equal to 20.6% over the entire studied range; therefore, the method is fit for benzene exposure measurements in workplaces where its concentration is expected to be\u00a0in the low ppb range, according to the performance criteria established by the EN 482:2021\u2013\u201cWorkplace exposure\u2013General requirements for the performance of procedures for the measurement of chemical agents\u201d standard.\nThe method relies upon a diffusive sampling technique, which ensures simplicity of use for industrial hygiene and HSE operators and intrinsic safety in potentially explosive atmospheres. The samplers are very lightweight and negligibly encumber the operators even when busy with demanding tasks in the production plants. Several monitoring tasks can be\u00a0accomplished at a time, both by personal or fixed area sampling, and they can be\u00a0performed during the usual 8-h"

The method is fit for purpose also for exposure monitoring over short time durations, aimed at evaluating personal exposure associated with specific tasks, or at investigating dose-rate responsiveness in order to understand which dose metrics (cumulative or peak exposures) are relevant in hazard assessments.\nThe collected samples have been demonstrated to be\u00a0stable upon storage for up to 65 days, this result is particularly important if we\u00a0consider that an industrial hygiene survey in a production plant may require several weeks (1 to 3, reasonably) to cover all shifts and all similar exposure groups (SEGs). All samples can be\u00a0stored together until the survey is complete, and then shipped to the laboratory and analyzed within 2 months from the beginning of the monitoring campaign.\nThe methodology validated in this study will be\u00a0 integral to the monitoring of benzene in industrial and professional gasoline exposure environments to assure compliance with current and future acceptably safe levels. This validated technique can also be\u00a0used to measure other VOC gasoline components, as regulatory science continues to advance safe exposure considerations to some of these, including isopropyl benzene (also known as 2-phenylpropane or cumene) (27, 28) and n-hexane (29), measured in this study, and potentially similar other chemicals including 2-phenylpropene (28) (also known as alpha-methyl styrene, CAS number 98\u201383-9), not measured within this study but eligible for sampling and analysis by the same technique."
