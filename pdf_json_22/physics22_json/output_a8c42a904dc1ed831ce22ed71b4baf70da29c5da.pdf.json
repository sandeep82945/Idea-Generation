INTRODUCTION\nIn conventional quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian of a system is Hermitian, which implies that the dynamical observables assume real values. Thus isolated systems are dealt within Hermitian quantum mechanics, while real systems always interact with the environment, and then dissipate. Hence an exchange of energy between the system under consideration and the \u2018bath\u2019 occurs. These are called open systems, and in a real scenario, the coupling to the environment makes their description significantly more complex. Strictly speaking, the time evolution of the wave function via a Hermitian Hamiltonian needs to be replaced by a Liouvillian superoperator via the time evolution of the density matrices.1 There are more technically challenging techniques to deal with open systems, such as, Keldysh formalism2, Lindblad master equation3 etc. Simpler reconciliations in the form of using non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians yield an intuitive understanding of the emergent phenomena in real physical systems, such as, photonic lattices with gain and/or loss, other optical systems,4\u201319 electronic,20,21 and mechanical22,23 systems etc.\nSince the introductory findings by Hatano and Nelson24,25 and Bender,26 claiming that NH systems with certain symmetry, such as a combination of both the parity (P) and the time reversal symmetry (T ), namely the PT symmetry, can have real energy spectra, they have emerged as topics that are worth exploring. In the context of present day\u2019s research, PT symmetric Hamiltonians have emerged as appropriate description of the dissipative systems with balanced gain and loss,27 and thus have been attracting a lot of attention. In certain cases, the Hermitian Hamiltonians reside at the borderline of PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases. In our work, we shall consider two different NH Hamiltonians, one PT symmetric, while PT symmetry is absent for the other.\nMeanwhile, a good volume of research has also concentrated on topological band theory extended to NH systems, where the topological classification gets significantly richer than their Hermitian counterpart28. Besides, in a Hermitian system, the topological phases are characterized by gapless edge modes in the open boundary condition (OBC). However, no such edge modes exist under the periodic boundary condition (PBC), as the PBC corresponds to an infinite system. Yet some topological invariants may be used to garner information of the topological phase transition in finite systems (OBC). This correspondence is known as the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC), which is no longer valid in NH systems (or have to be modified), thereby constituting an important deviation from its Hermitian counterpart, and the phenomena is termed as the breakdown of BBC.29\u201348 Moreover, systems with OBC and PBC are way too far distinct from one another in NH systems, which is not the case for the Hermitian analogues. Another fascinating manifestation is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which is related to localization property at the edges of the system. In several recent works,38,39,41 it has been shown that a macroscopic number of eigenstates get localized at either edge of the system, as soon as nonHermiticity is introduced. This may be considered as a direct consequence of the breakdown of BBC.\nIn addition to these, the existence of exceptional points (EP),29,49\u201353 where the Hamiltonian becomes ill-defined owing to formation of Jordan blocks, and hence the linearly independent vectors fall short of the degeneracy of the eigenvalues. Simply speaking, EPs are the singularities in the system where all the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of a system coalesce, making the Hamiltonian non-diagonalizable. They play a major role in segregating the topologically trivial, and the non-trivial phases of a NH system. Plenty of theoretical works have suggested that the NH systems can have non-trivial properties. Implementation of NH physics in systems with\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n13 83\n8v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 1\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 distinct topological characteristics, such as, models like Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models30,32,36,54\u201368, AubryAndre\u0301-Harper models69\u201374, Rice-Mele models75\u201379 etc. have been widely studied to ascertain the interplay of topology and non-Hermiticity.\nIn this paper, we have taken the simplest system that encodes topological considerations, such as a dimerized tight binding model in one dimension, or the familiar SSH model, which is thought to be a realistic model for polyacetylene in order to demonstrate the distinction between the PT symmetric or the non-PT symmetric systems. A main feature of the SSH model is the existence of two topologically different phases that are distinguished by the presence or the absence of two-fold degenerate zeromode edge states (one at each edge) under the OBC. The topological invariant that provides information on these zero-mode edge states is the winding number80\u201383, which, in Hermitian systems, can take only integral values. In the conventional Hermitian SSH model, the value of winding number is zero and unity for the topologically trivial and the non-trivial regimes respectively.\nIn our model, non-Hermiticity is introduced in two different ways; first through a non-reciprocity in the hopping integrals (both within and across the unit cells), and second, introducing a complex staggered on-site potential in the SSH model. The two resultant Hamiltonians differ with regard to their PT symmetry, with the former denoting a case with absent PT symmetry, while the latter preserves PT symmetry. We ascertain different topological properties of the two models. Specifically, we compare and contrast between the corresponding topological phases, NHSE, the structure of the EPs, and the winding numbers. Further, we investigate the interplay of the dimerization strength (ratio of the intra-cell and the inter-cell hopping amplitudes) with these observables.\nOur paper is organized as follows. We introduce the Hamiltonians corresponding to the PT symmetric, and the non-PT symmetric cases in section II. Hence we discuss the band structure, NHSE, and the role of the corresponding EPs in section III. Further, we compute the winding numbers in each of these cases to ascertain their topological characteristics. In fact, another distinct definition of the winding number for the PT symmetric case is shown to have a continuous variation as a function of the strength of the on-site potential, implying that it can assume any value in the range [0 : 1]. Further, the nonPT symmetric case demonstrates NHSE, which is absent in the PT symmetric case. Finally, we conclude with a brief summary of our results in section IV."

            "text": "In order to make the preceding discussion more structured, in the following section, we segregate the discussion of our results for the cases corresponding to the one with absent PT symmetry and the one with PT symmetry. Specifically, we show the calculation of EPs, winding numbers, energy spectra, and demonstrate NHSE via the sensitivity (or its lack thereof) to the boundary conditions in both these situations. While doing so, we have considered two cases that correspond to the topological and the trivial phases for the Hermitian SSH model, namely, t1 < t2 and t1 > t2 respectively. While we agree that the trivial and the topological phases of the Hermitian model might loose their significance in the NH analogue, we still use these regimes as the benchmarks to ascertain the role of the dimerization strength on the properties of our NH models. Specifically, all the while we consider t1 = 1, and fix t2 at 2 and 0.5 corresponding to the topological and the trivial regimes, respectively.\nA. non-PT symmetric case\nIn the non-PT symmetric case, the components of the d-vector can be expressed via a complex angle \u03c6, which is defined by,\ntan\u03c6 = dy dx\n= dRy + id I y\ndRx + id I x\n. (14)\n\u03c6 can be termed as an angle between the components (dx, dy), and can be expressed as,\n\u03c6 = \u03c6R + i\u03c6I (15)\nwhere \u03c6R and \u03c6I denote the real and the imaginary parts of \u03c6. These components can further be expressed in terms of the components of the d-vector (see Eq.(14)),37\ne2i\u03c6R = d+ d\u2212 /\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d+d\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , and e\u22122\u03c6I = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d+d\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (16) Further, it can be shown that,\ntan 2\u03c6R = Im ( d+ d\u2212 )/ Re ( d+ d\u2212 ) (17)\nwhere d\u00b1 are defined by,\nd+ = d R x \u2212 dIy + i(dRy + dIx) (18)\nd\u2212 = d R x + d I y \u2212 i(dRy \u2212 dIx) (19)\ndRx = Re(dx), d I x = Im(dx), d R y = Re(dy) and d I y = Im(dy).\n4 Let us focus on finding the EPs of this system. The eigenvalues given by Eq.(9) will coalesce when E\u00b1 = 0, that is, when the following condition is satisfied,\n(dRx + id R x ) 2 + (dRy + id I y) 2 = 0. (20)\nFrom the above equation (Eq.(20)), it is evident that the real part of the energy will be zero when\ndRx = \u00b1dIy and dRy = \u2213dIx. (21)\nFurther, the imaginary part of Eq.(20) becomes zero when the hopping amplitudes satisfy,\nt1 t2 = \u2212\u03b41 \u03b42 . (22)\nNow, in an NH system, the left eigenvector (eigenvector of H\u2020), and the right eigenvector (eigenvector of H) differ from each other, as the eigenvectors no longer form an orthonormal set due to the non-Hermiticity. Instead they satisfy the bi-orthonormal condition given by,\u2329\n\u03a8LEn |\u03a8REm \u232a = \u03b4nm\nwhere \u03a8LEn and \u03a8 RE m are the left and right eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues E\u2217n and Em respectively.\nThe right eigenvector of the Hamiltonian, h1(k), is given by,\n\u2223\u2223\u03a8RE1\u00b1 \u232a = \u221a R1R1 +R2 ei\u03be ( \u00b1 \u221a R1 R2 e\u2212i(\u03b11+\u03b12)/2 1 ) (23)\nwith d\u2212 = R1e i\u03b11 and d+ = R2e i\u03b12 , ei\u03be being a phase factor. Further, R1 = |(t1\u2212\u03b41)+(t2+\u03b42)eik|, R2 = |(t1+ \u03b41) + (t2\u2212 \u03b42)e\u2212ik|, \u03b11 = tan\u22121 [ (t2+\u03b42) sin k\n(t1\u2212\u03b41)+(t2+\u03b42) cos k\n] and\n\u03b12 = tan \u22121 [\n(t2\u2212\u03b42) sin k (t1+\u03b41)+(t2\u2212\u03b42) cos k\n] . Now the coalescence\nof the eigenvectors at the EPs demands that R1 has to vanish. This is equivalent to the condition,\u2223\u2223\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b42\u2223\u2223 = t1 + t2 and \u2223\u2223\u03b41 + \u03b42\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223t1 \u2212 t2\u2223\u2223 (24) at k = \u00b1\u03c0 and k = 0 respectively.\nHence the location of the EPs is given by Eq.(21) along with the criteria laid down in Eq.(24). Now, the real part of the angle \u03c6 (see Eq.(17)) can be written in terms of the location of the EPs, that is,\ntan 2\u03c6R = tan\u03c61 + tan\u03c62\n1\u2212 tan\u03c61 tan\u03c62 = tan(\u03c61 + \u03c62) (25)\nwhere the angles \u03c61 and \u03c62 are given by,\ntan\u03c61 = dRy + d I x\ndRx \u2212 dIy , tan\u03c62 = dRy \u2212 dIx dRx + d I y . (26)\n5 As \u03c6I is a real, continuous and a periodic function of the wave vector k, one has,\u222e\nC\n\u2202k\u03c6I dk = 0 (27)\nThe definition of the winding number, \u03bd, that is the topological invariant that counts the winding of the EPs, can be represented by,84\n\u03bdn = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222e C \u2202k\u03c6n dk (28)\nwhere n = \u00b1 is the band index, \u03c6n(k) is the argument of the d-vector, that is \u03c6n(k) = tan\n\u22121(dy/dx) and the contour C denotes the Brillouin zone (BZ), that is, k goes from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0. It is evident that \u03bd will only be function of \u03c6R (see Eq.(27)). From Eqs.(15) and (17), \u03bd splits into two parts, namely,\n\u03bd = 1\n2 (\u03bd1 + \u03bd2) (29)\nwhere,\n\u03bd1 = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222e C \u2202k\u03c61 dk and \u03bd2 = 1 2\u03c0 \u222e C \u2202k\u03c62 dk. (30)\nHere, \u03c61 is the angle that the line connecting (d R x , d R y ) and (dIy,\u2212dIx) make with a line parallel to x-axis (see Fig.2), and \u03c62 is the corresponding angle for the EP located at (\u2212dIy, dIx). So, as shown in Fig.2, as k is taken over the BZ, both the EPs will travel along a circle (anticlockwise), each with radius \u03b42 (both denoted by blue circles in Fig.2), and their centers are located at (\u2212\u03b41, 0) corresponding to the EP at (dIy,\u2212dIx), and at (\u03b41, 0) for the EP at (\u2212dIy, dIx). The point (dRx , dRy ) will traverse along a circle (shown by red color in Fig.2) of radius t2 whose center is located at (t1, 0). This is similar to the locus of the d-vector in the dx-dy plane for the Hermitian version of the model, with the only difference that here we have to deal with the real parts of dx and dy.\nWe can now construct the phase diagrams in Fig.3 for the winding number \u03bd in the plane defined by the nonreciprocity parameters, \u03b41 and \u03b42 for both t1 > t2 and t1 < t2. There are three distinct regions in these phase diagrams, where \u03bd assumes values 0, 12 and 1 corresponding to zero winding, winding one of the set of EPs, and both the EPs respectively, as k is taken from over the BZ. Thus, there are clear evidences of phase transitions from one topological phase to another, characterized by the winding number discontinuously changing from 1 to 0.5, or from a topological to a trivial phase where the winding number jumps from 0 to 0.5. These abrupt changes are depicted as a function of \u03b42 in the lower panel of Fig.3 along the straight lines (in red) shown in its upper panel.\nTo understand the topological phase transitions more succinctly, we plot the band structure in Fig.4, that is,\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Re(E) vs Im(E) for (a) \u03bd = 1 with PBC, (b) \u03bd = 1 with OBC, (c) \u03bd = 0.5 with PBC, (d) \u03bd = 0.5 with OBC, keeping t1 = 1 and t2 = 2. There is a zero energy mode (|E| = 0) in the right panels.\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Re(E) vs Im(E) for (a) \u03bd = 0 with PBC, (b) \u03bd = 0 with OBC, (c) \u03bd = 0.5 with PBC, (d) \u03bd = 0.5 with OBC, keeping t1 = 1 and t2 = 0.5. The |E| = 0 mode is missing.\nthe real part of the energy, corresponding to the expres-\n6\nsion E(k) given by, E\u00b1 = \u00b1 [ t21 + t 2 2 \u2212 \u03b421 \u2212 \u03b422+2(t1t2 + \u03b41\u03b42) cos k\n\u22122i(t1\u03b42 + t2\u03b41) sin k ] 1 2 (31)\nfor two representative values of \u03b42 that denote two different values of the winding number, \u03bd corresponding to both t1 > t2 and t1 < t2 in the upper and the lower panels of respectively. For t1 < t2, \u03b41 = 0.1 corresponds to \u03bd = 1, where we have observed the spectral gap being non-zero everywhere in BZ. Thus it makes sense to conclude that the real part energy shows a topological gap with \u03bd = 1 for t1 < t2, and a trivial gap with \u03bd = 0 for t1 > t2, while \u03bd = 0.5 corresponds to gap closing scenario for both the cases. However, there is an important difference between the two. The zero mode for OBC which exists for t1 < t2, is absent for t1 > t2. Further, the discontinuous transitions of one value of \u03bd to another occur when Eq.(24) is satisfied. For example, in Fig.3, \u03bd drops discontinuously from 1 to 0.5 at \u03b42 = 0.5 for t1 = 1, t2 = 2, and from 0 to 0.5 at \u03b42 = 0.25 for t1 = 1, t2 = 0.5.\nNext we distinguish between the behavior of the imaginary part of the energy as a function of its real part for both the PBC and the OBC corresponding to t1 < t2 (Fig.5) and t1 > t2 (Fig.6). The eigenvalues always come in pairs with \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 signs, that is there must be some \u2212E for every E due to Hamiltonian\u2019s chiral nature (obeys Eq.(10)). In the upper panel of Fig.5, we con-\ntrast between the PBC and OBC for \u03bd = 1. Apart from demonstrating a completely different behavior, where the energy has both real and imaginary parts for the PBC, while Im(E)= 0 for OBC, we get a couple of zero energy modes (|E| = 0). At \u03bd = 0.5, although Im(E) 6= 0 in both the PBC and the OBC, the zero energy modes continue to exist for the OBC. The above scenario suffers drastically, that is |E| remains non-zero all the while for t1 > t2 (Fig.6), albeit there are differences noted in the behavior of system in the PBC and the OBC. Thus the situation corresponding to \u03bd = 0.5, although with a gapless band structure (Re(E)= 0) at the edges of the BZ\n7\nt1 = 1, t2 = 2.\nfor both t1 < t2 and t1 > t2 (see right panel of Fig.4), are distinct.\nLet us have a closer look at Figs.5(d) and 6(d). They seem to form closed loops from a distance, while a careful inspection reveals that these are not really closed loops. For the sake of clarity, Figs.5(b) and 5(d) are zoomed in Fig.8(a). It can be seen in Fig.8(a) that though two loops form at both sides of the imaginary axis for \u03bd = 0.5, some points scatter on the real axis, suggesting that Im(E) = 0, (with a couple of eigenvalues with |E| being zero because of t1 < t2), making it more of a scattered plot, rather than a closed loop. Also it must be noted that for \u03bd = 1, there are no loops formed. The points lie only on the real axis, making all the eigenvalues real.\nSimilarly Fig.8(b) is a clearer picture of Figs.6(b) and 6(d). Here also some points scatter on the real axis apart from making loops at each side of the imaginary axis for \u03bd = 0.5. It must be noted that for \u03bd = 0, no loops are formed here as well. Unlike the previous case (Fig.8(a) with \u03bd = 0.5), here there are no eigenvalues with abs(E) = 0 for t1 > t2. These so called \u201dclosed loops\u201d are distinct from the closed loops we obtained in case for PBC (Figs.5(c) and 6(c)).\nIn fact, a common perception is that closed loops only occur in PBC. However, OBC spectrum does form closed loops as well. In the work of Liu et al .85 on the nonHermitian Aubry Andre\u0301 model, it can be seen that system with OBC forms closed loops as shown in Figs.9(a)(c) of the paper.\nLet us now describe the NHSE in the non-PT symmetric system. The NHSE is depicted in Fig.7. Majority of the eigenstates are localized at either of the edges depending upon the signs of \u03b41 and \u03b42. We have showed the NHSE for t1 = 1 and two values of t2, namely, 0.5 and 2 with \u03bd = 0.5 in Fig.7. It can be seen almost all the eigenstates for both the cases are localized at the edges of the system with the zero energy modes present for the case t1 < t2 (left panel of Fig.7) and absent for t1 > t2 (right panel of Fig.7). If we make any of \u03b41 or \u03b42 negative, the eigenstates will localize at the other end, namely, the left edge of the system. Same phenomena (NHSE) have been observed for \u03bd = 1 with t1 < t2 and \u03bd = 0 with t1 > t2 also.\nWe have also studied two different types of the spectral gaps, such as the point gap and the line gap from the energy spectra of the Hamiltonian with PBC. The\nenergy gaps play a vital role in determining the topological properties of the system28. There are further two kinds of line gaps, namely, line gaps with respect to the real axis (Lr), and gap with respect to the imaginary axis (Li). In Fig.3(a), which defines t1 < t2, the \u2018sky blue\u2019 regions correspond to point gap , while the \u2018light magenta\u2019 region hosts line gap. This means that we have P type energy gap when \u03bd = 0.5 (shown in Fig.5(c)) and Lr type gap when \u03bd = 1 (shown in Fig.5(a)). Similarly for t1 > t2, shown in Fig.3(b), we have P type energy gap for \u03bd = 0.5 (shown in Fig.6(c)), which is shown by \u2018sky blue\u2019 region and Lr type gap when \u03bd = 0 (shown\nin Fig.6(a)) shown by \u2018white\u2019 region in Fig.3(b). These results are consistent with the band structure (Re (E) vs k) graphs (shown in Fig.4), which show gapped spectrum for \u03bd = 1 (for t1 < t2) and \u03bd = 0 (for t1 > t2), whereas the spectrum is gapless for \u03bd = 0.5 for both t1 < t2 and t1 > t2. These transitions occur when there is a jump in the value of the winding number that are denoted by the continuous bold lines in Figs.3(a) and 3(b). This feature suggests of a connection between the topology of the system and the complex energy spectrum."

            "text": "We shall explore an alternate route for rendering nonHermiticity to our dimerized Hamiltonian, which may be achieved via an imaginary potential, u, that is given by h2(k) in Eq.(5). The energy eigenvalues of h2(k) are given by (see Eq.(9)),\nE\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u221a |t1 + t2e\u2212ik|2 \u2212 u2. (32)\nThe right eigenvectors of h2(k) are given by, \u2223\u2223\u03a8RE2+ \u232a = (e\u2212i\u03c6k cos \u03b8ksin \u03b8k ) and \u2223\u2223\u03a8RE2\u2212 \u232a = (\u2212e\u2212i\u03c6k sin \u03b8kcos \u03b8k ) (33)\nwhere, \u03c6k = i ln \u2223\u2223\u2223 t1+t2e\u2212ik|t1+t2e\u2212ik| \u2223\u2223\u2223 and \u03b8k = tan\u22121 (\u221aE+\u2212iuE++iu). The topological invariant for the PT symmetric model is considered as the usual winding number, defined in Eq.(28). For this case, expressions for dx and dy are given by Eq.(8). Fig.10(a) shows that there are no zero energy modes (|E| = 0) as long as u 6= 0. These modes (a couple of them) are restored as soon as u becomes 0 and t1 becomes smaller than t2 (shown by thin red part at the bottom of Fig.10(a)), which is a known result for the Hermitian SSH model. Even though there are no abs(E) = 0 modes for t1 < t2, we still get \u03bd = 0 for t1 > t2, and \u03bd = 1 for t1 < t2 irrespective of the values of u (shown in Fig.10(b)) because of the absence (t1 > t2) and presence (t1 < t2) of edge modes.\nWe have also computed the complex Berry phase for this model. The complex Berry phase is an important\nnumber (\u03bd) using Eq.(28) in the u-t2 space keeping t1 fixed at 1.\nquantity in the PT symmetric case, and is given by,36\nQcn = i \u222b BZ \u2329 \u03bbnk \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2202\u2202k \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c8nk \u232a dk (34)\nwhere \u3008\u03bbnk | and |\u03c8nk \u3009 are the left and the right eigenvectors respectively corresponding to nth band respectively. To make our presentation complete, we have included a complete derivation of the complex Berry phase in Appendix A. The complex Berry phase exhibits the same behavior as that shown by the winding number (\u03bd), where the former is either 2\u03c0 and 0 for t1 < t2 and t1 > t2 respectively, while \u03bd takes a value 1 as long as t1 < t2, and becomes 0 when t1 > t2, irrespective of u. In this way, the complex Berry phase behaves similar to that of \u03bd, although the value has to be multiplied by 2\u03c0.\nNow let us focus on finding the EPs of this system. The energy eigenvalues coalesce when E\u00b1 become zero, which leads to,\n|t1 + t2e\u2212ik|2 = u2 (35)\nThe coalescence of the eigenvectors demands also Eq.(35) to be satisfied, and thus is in contrast with the non-PT symmetric case, where the conditions corresponding to the coalescence of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are distinct. In terms of components of the d-vector, Eq.(35) can be written as,\n(dRx ) 2 + (dRy ) 2 = u2 (36)\nwhich is the equation of a circle with radius u in a space spanned by dRx \u2212 dRy . Expressions for dRx and dRy can be obtained from Eq.(8). So the EPs are arranged on the circumference of a circle of radius u, and there are infinite number of EPs which reside on the circumference. A schematic diagram is shown, via blue circle, while the red circle (of radius t2) denotes the locus of the d-vector in the dRx (k)\u2212 dRy (k) plane, in Fig.9.\nNow, we can define a new winding number (\u03bd\u2032) for this system in the following way. \u03bd\u2032 is the ratio of the portion\n[t]\nFIG. 11: (Color online) The band structure (Re(E)) for t2 = 2 (first column) and t2 = 0.5 (second column) with t1 = 1 corresponding to different values of the winding number \u03bd.\nof the Exceptional Circle in blue color (will be referred as EC hereafter) wound by the dRx (k)\u2212 dRy (k) curve, shown in red color, and the circumference of the EC. We shall show the calculations of \u03bd\u2032 afterwards. For example, as shown in Fig.9(b), \u03bd\u2032 is denoted by the ratio of the arc ABC to the whole EC. Thus \u03bd\u2032 may assume any value between 0 and 1 depending on the portion of the overlap of EC with the red circle. This is true for any value of the potential u (refer to Fig.9).\nIt may be noted that we have kept t1 fixed and considered two values of t2, namely 2 and 0.5, which fix the radius of the red circle at these values. Let us first discuss t1 < t2. In order to compute the overlap of the EC with the red circle, there are two possibilities. Either the EC is completely within the red circle (Fig.9(a)), which corresponds to \u03bd\u2032 = 1, or to enumerate the partial overlap we compute the angle \u03b8 in Fig.9(b) (shown below). This corresponds to \u03bd\u2032 < 1 (in this case \u03bd\u2032 is close to 1). In Fig.9(c), the red circle is completely inside EC which corresponds to zero overlap, and hence \u03bd\u2032 = 0. We show the variation of \u03bd\u2032 as a function of u in Fig.9(d). Till u = 1 (= |t1 \u2212 t2|), \u03bd\u2032 remains at a value 1. For 1 < u < 3, we get 0 < \u03bd\u2032 < 1, while for u > 3 (= t1 + t2), \u03bd \u2032 remains\ncases: (a) and (b) correspond to u = 0.5, (c) and (d) correspond to u = 2, (e) and (f) correspond to u = 3.5, keeping t1 = 1 and t2 = 2.\nat a value 0. The above scenario can be contrasted with the case t1 > t2, except for the red circle and the EC are apart with zero overlap for the first case of t1 < t2 (Fig.9(a)), that is, when u < t2\u2212 t1. \u03bd\u2032 takes the value 1 there and behaves similarly of that of the previous case (t1 < t2) afterwards.\nNow let us return back to the calculations that yield the plots shown in Fig.9(d). At the points of overlap of these two circles (EC and the red circle), if we substitute,\ndRx = t1 + t2 cos k, d R y = t2 sin k\nin Eq.(36), we shall obtain,\nu2 \u2212 2dRx t1 + t21 = t22, and dRx = u2 + t21 \u2212 t22\n2t1 (37)\nThus substituting dRx in Eq.(36), one gets,\ndRy = \u00b1 1\n2t1\n\u221a ((u+ t1)2 \u2212 t22) (t22 \u2212 (u\u2212 t1)2) (38)\ndRy must be real, and for that to happen, we should have,\n|t1 \u2212 t2| \u2264 u \u2264 t1 + t2 (39)\n10\ncases: (a) and (b) correspond to u = 0.25, (c) and (d) correspond to u = 1, (e) and (f) correspond to u = 1.75, keeping t1 = 1 and t2 = 0.5.\nIt can be shown that the angle subtended by the arc ABC at the center of EC, shown by (0, 0) in Fig.9(b), is given by,\n\u03b8 = 2u tan\u22121  \u221a( (u+ t1)2 \u2212 t22 )( t22 \u2212 (u\u2212 t1)2 ) u2 + t21 \u2212 t22  (40)\nThe value of \u03b8 is such that, \u03b8 \u2208 [ \u2212 \u03c0, \u03c0 ] . Thus the winding number, which is denoted by the overlap of EC with the red circle is given by,\n\u03bd\u2032 = arclength(ABC)\n2\u03c0u (41)\nThis finally yields the expression for the winding number as,\n\u03bd\u2032 = 1\n\u03c0 tan\u22121  \u221a( (u+ t1)2 \u2212 t22 )( t22 \u2212 (u\u2212 t1)2 ) u2 + t21 \u2212 t22  (42)\nIt is clear from Eq.(42), that this winding number, \u03bd\u2032, can take all possible values between 0 and 1.\nThe band structure (Re(E) vs k) is plotted in Fig.11. The band gap closes at the point, u = |t1 \u2212 t2|, which happens when the EC touches the dRx \u2212 dRy curve internally, and remains so until a value u = t1 + t2, where Re(E(k)) becomes zero. Similar phenomena happen for both t1 < t2 and t1 > t2. In order to distinguish the band structures for the two dimerized cases, t1 < t2 (left panel) and t1 > t2 (right panel), we have plotted Re(E) vs k in Fig.11 corresponding to \u03bd\u2032 = 0 and \u03bd\u2032 6= 0 respectively. The top row shows results for small u where \u03bd\u2032 = 1 for both t1 < t2 and t1 > t2. The spectrum is gapped in each case, however the nature of the gaps are different, since they correspond to different values of \u03bd\u2032. The central panel of Fig.11 denotes the band structure for intermediate values of u where we have 0 < \u03bd\u2032 < 1 in each case. The situation corresponds to the closure of the spectral gap occurring at k-values away from the edge of the BZ, along with the presence of zero modes (Re(E)= 0) in both the cases. The presence of the spectral gap in certain parts of the BZ probably bears the testimony of a finite winding number. Finally, for large u, where \u03bd\u2032 = 0 in both t1 < t2 and t1 > t2 cases, there are two fold degenerate flat bands at Re(E)= 0.\nWe also plot Im(E) vs Re(E) for both the PBC and the OBC corresponding to t1 < t2 and t1 > t2 (Figs.12 and 13). The energy eigenvalues always occur in complex conjugate pairs, that is there must be a E\u2217 for every E, as the Hamiltonian is PT symmetric (obeys Eq.(12)). Some of these eigenvalues are purely real, and the rest are purely imaginary. This happens for both the PBC and the OBC. However, there is one difference. For t1 < t2 with OBC, two edge modes exist with E = \u00b1iu for all values of the potential u, a scenario that is absent in PBC. Same phenomena have been observed for t1 > t2, except that there are no edge modes corresponding to either of the energy eigenvalues E = \u00b1iu.36 The two edge modes continue to exist as long as t1 < t2 with the winding number, \u03bd being 1 (Fig.14), regardless of the value of the staggered imaginary potential strength, u.84.\nLastly, we discuss the broken and unbroken regions in this model. The energy eigenvalues remain purely real till a value of u given by, u = |t1 \u2212 t2|. Beyond that, the number of purely imaginary eigenvalues increases with u, until u = t1 + t2. Finally, all the energies become purely imaginary for larger values of u. So, u = |t1 \u2212 t2| can be thought as the transition point between the PT broken and the unbroken regions, prior to which the PT symmetry is unbroken, while after u = |t1\u2212t2| it is broken (Fig.15). The new winding number, \u03bd\u2032 can be thought of as a measurement of the ratio of the number of energy eigenvalues with real parts being non-zero to the total number of eigenvalues. Say, the real parts of n out of N of the energy eigenvalues are non-zero, then \u03bd\u2032 is given by n/N .\n11\neigenvalues is given by u = t1 + t2."

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "Here, in this paper, we have investigated the NH SSH model, and examined two separate cases, namely the PT symmetric case (modeled by a complex on-site potential), and a non-PT symmetric case (modeled by breaking the reciprocity in the hopping amplitudes). The phase diagram of the non-PT symmetric system encodes a more familiar view of the winding number, which takes integer and half integer values for specific set of the parameters, thereby supporting a phase transition from one value of the winding number to another. Different types of spectral gaps are discussed via the real and the imagi-\nnary parts of the energies. The band structure, given by, Re(E) vs k, supports these transitions via a gap closing scenario. A geometrical perspective of understanding the EPs in a more generalized sense has also been provided. The EPs for the non-PT symmetric case are functions of the momentum (k) and is thus unusual compared to the Hermitian SSH model. For PT symmetric case, a phase diagram of winding number is obtained and complex Berry phase is being calculated. In contrast to the non-PT symmetric case, where the winding number assumes three distinct values, namely 0, 12 and 1, here it can only takes two values, namely 0 and 1. Another feature emerges as we have infinite number of EPs, arranged on the circumference of a circle, which renders a continuous variation of a newly defined winding number as a function of the strength of the imaginary potential. The Re(E) vs Im(E) plots show that the eigenvalues are either purely real or purely imaginary (which was not the case for non-PT symmetric system), which supports the information obtained from the winding number (\u03bd\u2032) and also are in accordance with the band structure Re(E) vs k plots. We also find that the broken and unbroken regions in this case characterized by eigenvalues being real and complex respectively. Finally, NHSE is examined for both the cases, which demonstrates significant differences between the non-PT symmetric and the PT symmetric cases. The variations of the real part of the energy with the corresponding imaginary part are quite distinct in these cases, with only non-PT symmetric case demonstrating breakdown of BBC, and the occurrence of NHSE.\n12\nIn this case, the occurrence of skin effect depends on the signs of \u03b41 and \u03b42, while the presence or the absence of the zero energy modes depends on whether t1 < t2 or t1 > t2. The PT symmetric case does not show NHSE, instead only two zero energy edge modes are observed for the topological case (t1 < t2), and none corresponding to the trivial case (t1 > t2) as both the intra-cell and intercell hoppings in this model is reciprocal. The scenario is similar to the Hermitian SSH model, and hence the conventional BBC is preserved. It is prudent to mention that a parallel formalism that uses non-Bloch band theory via complex momenta defined in generalized BZ39 admits usage of the \u2018normal\u2019 Bloch wavefunction with real momenta for this scenario."
