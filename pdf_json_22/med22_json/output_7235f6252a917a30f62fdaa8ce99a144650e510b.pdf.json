CLEC-2 and its endogenous ligand podoplanin are crucial for normal development, with mice deficient in either showing defective blood\u2013lymphatic vessel separation. This interaction also has a role in tumor metastasis. CLEC-2 is important in thrombosis, particularly in immunothrombosis and smaller vascular beds, with CLEC-2 deficiency reducing vessel occlusion in several in vivo thrombosis models with little effect on hemostasis. Occlusion is unaltered in CLEC-2 Y7A signaling null mice, in which the receptor is normally expressed, suggesting that it is the presence of CLEC-2 itself, rather than CLEC2-induced platelet activation, that has a role in thrombus stability. Furthermore, immunodepletion of CLEC-2 from the platelet surface using the monoclonal antibody INU1 has similar effects on thrombus formation, with depletion lasting up to 6 days and accompanied by transient thrombocytopenia.",

However, the in vivo role of human CLEC-2 cannot be readily investigated experimentally in humans, meaning there are limited methods to assess the relevance of human CLEC-2 in arterial thrombosis or tools to test potential therapeutics preclinically. In addition, although antibodies against human CLEC-2, such as AYP1,16 exist, it is unknown if human, like mice, CLEC-2 can be immunodepleted. Here, we have generated a humanized CLEC-2 mouse model that can be used to test potential antihuman CLEC-2 therapeutics in vivo.\nHumanized CLEC-2 (hCLEC-2KI) mice were generated using CRISPR to replace the mouse gene with the human variant (supplemental Figure 1). These mice are viable, fertile, and born in the Mendelian ratio (supplemental Table 1). There were no obvious signs of blood lymphatic defects, and both platelet and megakaryocyte counts were comparable to wild-type (WT) mice (supplemental Table 2; supplemental Figure 2). This is in contrast to other mouse lines in which CLEC-2 or podoplanin have been genetically modified3,4,14 and suggests that human CLEC-2 can compensate for loss of the mouse protein and the interaction with murine podoplanin is sufficient for blood\u2013lymphatic vessel separation. Human but not mouse CLEC-2 could be detected on platelets from hCLEC-2KI mice with heterozygotes expressing half each of human and mouse CLEC-2 (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 3). The surface abundance of CLEC-2 on hCLEC-2KI platelets was approximately double that on human platelets (Figure 1A). The surface abundance of all other glycoprotein receptors was comparable to WT platelets (supplemental\n3000 AYP1 INU1 Rhodocytin\n5 min\n2000\n1000 CL EC\n-2 su\nrfa ce\nex pr\nes sio\nn (M\nFI )\n0\n16000 3000\n1500\n800\n400\n0\n12000 8000 4000\n800 400JO N/\nAPE\n(M FI\n)\n\u03b1P-\nse lec\ntin -F ITC (M FI )\n0 Rest. 10 1\nCRP \u03bcg/ml\nRC \u03bcg/ml AYP1 \u03bcg/ml\n0.1 1.2 10\n\u03b1-mCLEC-2 \u03b1-hCLEC-2\nRest. 10 1\nCRP \u03bcg/ml\nRC \u03bcg/ml AYP1 \u03bcg/ml\n0.1 1.2 10\n**** ****\nWT Het\nhCLEC-2KI Human\nA B\nC D\nFigure 1. hCLEC-2KI mice have normal CLEC-2 expression and platelet activation. (A) Surface expression of mouse and human CLEC-2 by flow cytometry using INU1 and AYP1 antibodies, respectively. Heterozygous mice expressed half human and half mouse CLEC-2, whereas hCLEC-2KI mice expressed only hCLEC-2 on their platelet surface. (B) Light transmission aggregometry with washed platelets shows that AYP1 (10 \u03bcg/mL) and INU1 (10 \u03bcg/mL) cause aggregation of hCLEC-2KI and WT platelets, respectively, and reduced aggregation in hCLEC-2KI heterozygous platelets. RC-induced (0.24 \u03bcg/mL) aggregation has a longer lag time not only in hCLEC-2KI platelets but also in human platelets. (C) Platelet integrin activation measured by JON/A-PE antibody binding in flow cytometry shows no difference in (hem)ITAM-mediated platelet activation in hCLEC-2KI platelets and hCLEC-2\u2013specific activation by AYP1.

However, there was a slight increase in lag time before aggregation with RC, similar to that seen in human platelets (Figure 1B). Thrombus formation on collagen under flow at 1200 s\u22121 was unaltered in hCLEC-2KI mice (supplemental Figure 5). Platelet spreading was comparable to WT on both fibrinogen and collagen-related peptide. However, it was slightly reduced on mouse podoplanin for hCLEC-2KI platelets because, although they formed both filopodia and lamellipodia, there were few fully spread platelets (supplemental Figure 6). Overall, this suggests that there are no major differences in platelet function in hCLEC-2KI compared with WT mice.\nThe novel antibody HEL1 was generated by hybridoma technology following immunization of Wistar rats with hCLEC-2 immunoprecipitated from human platelet lysates. HEL1 is specific to hCLEC-2 and can be used in flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunoprecipitation (supplemental Figure 7A-C). It binds to a different epitope on CLEC-2 than AYP1 because no competition between the 2 antibodies was observed (supplemental Figure 7D), although both antibodies cause hCLEC-2KI platelet aggregation (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 7E). Furthermore, HEL1 Fab fragments neither block RC-induced platelet aggregation, unlike AYP1 Fab fragments,16 nor block AYP1 IgG-induced aggregation of hCLEC2KI platelets (supplemental Figure 7F). This not only shows that AYP1 and HEL1 act at different sites on CLEC-2 but also shows\n998 RESEARCH LETTER\nthat CLEC-2 dimerization at either site is sufficient to trigger platelet activation because both antibodies, but not their Fab fragments, stimulate aggregation. To investigate whether human, like mice, CLEC-2 can be immunodepleted in vivo, AYP1 or HEL1 were injected intraperitoneally, and CLEC-2 surface expression was determined by flow cytometry. Both antibodies depleted CLEC-2 for at least 11 days, with levels returning to normal by 18 days for AYP1 and 24 days for HEL1 (Figure 2B; supplemental\nFigure 8). In both cases, there was a transient thrombocytopenia lasting up to 4 days (Figure 2A). This is consistent with immunodepletion of mCLEC-2 using INU1; however, the length of the CLEC-2 depletion is prolonged (Figure 2C).8,17\nThe effect of hCLEC-2 depletion was investigated in in vivo thrombosis and hemostasis models. Depletion had no effect on tail bleeding time (Figure 2D), which adds further support for CLEC-2 having a minor role in hemostasis.13 In the mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta thrombosis model, there was no difference in the time to vessel occlusion in CLEC-2\u2013depleted hCLEC-2KI mice compared with untreated controls, and neither group differed significantly from WT mice (Figure 2E). Notably, in the ferric chloride\u2013induced injury of the mesenteric arterioles, hCLEC-2KI mice displayed an increased time to occlusion with 9 of 16 vessels failing to occlude. This was not the case for the hCLEC-2KI\u2013 depleted mice, in which only 3 of 14 vessels failed to occlude (supplemental Figure 9). Thus, hCLEC-2KI mice apparently\n28 MARCH 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 6\n250\nPlatelet count\n200\n150\n100\nPl at\nele t c\nou nt\n(% ) b\nas eli ne Time post -CLEC-2 mAb (days) 50 0 0 1 5 10 15 20 25\nWT\nWT INU1\nhCLEC-2KI\nhCLEC-2KI AYP1\nhCLEC-2KI HEL1\nA\nhCLEC-2 mCLEC-2\nTime post -CLEC-2 mAb (days) 0 1 5 10 15 20 25\nTime post -CLEC-2 mAb (days) 0 1 5 10 15 20 25\n3000\n2000\nAY P1\n-F ITC\n(M FI\n)\n1000\n0\n3000\n2000\nIN U1\n-F ITC\n(M FI\n)\n1000\n0\nB C\n> 1200 1200\n800\n400 Ta il b\nlee din\ng tim\ne (s\n)\n0 WT hCLEC-2KI hCLEC-2KI\ndepleted\nWT hCLEC-2KI hCLEC-2KI\ndepleted\n> 1800 1800\n1200\n600\nTim e\nto o\ncc lus\nion (s\n)\n0\nD E\nFigure 2. hCLEC-2 can be immunodepleted using HEL1 or AYP1, with little effect on hemostasis. (A) Platelet count following intraperitoneal injection of INU1, AYP1, or HEL1 antibody (3 \u03bcg/g bodyweight). Transient thrombocytopenia lasting up to 4 days after injection can be seen for all antibody-treated groups compared with the untreated controls. Platelet count was determined by flow cytometry and is shown as the percentage of the baseline count. (B) hCLEC-2 surface expression determined by flow cytometry following depletion by either AYP1 or HEL1. For both antibodies, CLEC-2 could not be detected on the platelet surface for at least 11 days. (C) mCLEC-2 surface expression determined by flow cytometry following depletion by INU1 shows that CLEC-2 was absent for at least 7 days after injection. Measurements with anti-rat and anti-mouse IgG excluded the possibility that the abolished anti-CLEC-2-FITC binding was due to the presence of remaining anti-CLEC-2 antibodies on the platelets (supplemental Figure 8).

(E) Depletion of CLEC-2 had no effect on occlusive thrombus formation following mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta, and hCLEC-2KI mice were comparable to WT. P > .05, Fisher exact test. Horizontal lines represent the median time to vessel occlusion, with each circle representing 1 mouse. For all\nexperiments, a minimum of 5 mice were tested per group.

We speculate that this discrepancy to previous reports on CLEC-2\u2013deficient mice that displayed reduced thrombus formation8,13,15,18 could be attributed to the postulated intravascular CLEC-2 ligand. This could explain the reduction in vessel occlusion in untreated hCLEC-2KI mice\n28 MARCH 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 6\nbecause the human receptor cannot interact with the mouse ligand to the same extent as the mouse receptor. In line with this hypothesis, it has recently been confirmed that mouse CLEC-2 contributes to arterial thrombosis and thrombus formation on collagen in vitro, whereas competitive inhibition of human CLEC-2 had no effect on in vitro thrombus formation.18 It is also possible that human CLEC-2 itself has, at least to some extent, an antithrombotic effect, which could explain the difference in vessel occlusion between hCLEC-2KI and hCLEC-2KI\u2013depleted mice. Notably, hCLEC-2 can compensate for mCLEC-2 during development and in hemostasis, suggesting a conserved interaction between CLEC-2 and podoplanin in hCLEC-2KI mice.\nRESEARCH LETTER 999\nD ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/7/6/997/2071576/blooda_adv-2\nHere, we have demonstrated that hCLEC-2 can be immunodepleted and provide proof of principle that the hCLEC-2KI mouse can be used to study anti-hCLEC-2 agents in vivo.\nAcknowledgments: The authors thank Stefanie Hartmann, Juliana Goldmann, and Ewa Stepien-B\u00f6tsch for their excellent technical assistance.\nThis project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement number 766118.
