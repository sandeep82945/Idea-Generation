INTRODUCTION\nIn this work we explore the one-loop quantum corrections to the energies of solitons in a self-dual impurity \u03d54 model in one-space and one-time dimension (D \u00bc 1\u00fe 1). Low-dimensional soliton models are interesting because they are role models for more complex systems in higher dimensions that have applications ranging from, among others, cosmology [1] via condensed matter physics [2,3] to hadron [4] and nuclear physics [5]. An important feature of the model that we consider here is that its solitons saturate a Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) [6,7] energy bound. Hence the classical energy only depends on the boundary values of soliton profiles but not on the position of the impurity so that there is no static force between the impurity and the soliton [8,9]. As a further consequence these solitons are degenerate with respect to the variation of a continuous parameter that measures the distance between the position of the kink-type structure and the center of the impurity. Thus the most favorable solution is determined by the quantum corrections to the classical energy even though these corrections are small for a consistent choice of model parameters. Computing these corrections as a function of this variational parameter is the central objective of this work. For a sufficiently strong impurity we will find a local minimum of the quantum energy. However, for weak impurities, this energy favors infinitely far separated\nkink-antikink pairs, signaling an unstable soliton. This is similar to multifield Shifman Voloshin soliton [10] that has classically degenerate solitons that are unstable quantum mechanically [11]. Similarly, quantum corrections reveal instabilities in higher polynomial soliton models [12,13]. For moderate and large values of the separation parameter the static solutions resemble superpositions of a kinkantikink pair in the renowned \u03d54 model [14\u201316]. In contrast to kink-antikink superpositions in the \u03d54 model the impurity causes such configurations to be stable classically so that the model provides a way around the fundamental problem of dealing with imaginary frequencies [17,18] of the quantum fluctuations about a kink-antikink in the \u03d54 model. The computation of quantum corrections to soliton energies in one space dimension is by now a standard and straightforward endeavor when utilizing the so-called spectral methods [19]. The essential ingredients are the scattering data extracted from the quantum fluctuations about the potential that is induced by the soliton. This computation is particularly simple when this potential is invariant under spatial reflection [20]. All that is needed is the Jost function along the positive imaginary momentum axis. Since the quantum energy manifests itself through the shift (or polarization) of the zero point energies of the quantum fluctuations it is frequently called the vacuum polarization energy (VPE). Following this introduction, we will describe the selfdual impurity model and its BPS solutions in Sec. II. Section III contains the analysis of the potential for the quantum fluctuations at moderate and large kink-antikink separation. In Sec. IV we will describe the spectral method that determines the VPE.

            "text": "We consider the self-dual impurity model in D \u00bc 1\u00fe 1 whose full Lagrangian is given by [21,22]\nL \u00bc Z dx 1\n2\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202t\n2\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u2202\u03d5 \u2202x \u00fe\nffiffiffi 2 p W \u00fe ffiffiffi 2 p \u03c3W 2\n\u00fe Z dx ffiffiffi 2 p W \u2202\u03d5\n\u2202x ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhereW \u00bc W\u00f0\u03d5\u00de is the superpotential and \u03c3 \u00bc \u03c3\u00f0x\u00de is the prescribed impurity. In the limit \u03c3 \u2192 0 the standard scalar model with a scalar potential of U \u00bc W2 is obtained. Typically these potentials generate spontaneous symmetry breaking with at least two degenerate vacua. The soliton(s) then assume either of them at positive and negative spatial infinity. We have written this Lagrangian in terms of dimensionless variables and parameters, thereby omitting an overall factor. This factor does not affect the field equations but, through canonical quantization, it is the order parameter that counts the loops entering the quantum corrections and thus discriminates between classical and quantum contributions. In our case we will solely compare configurations which are classically degenerate at one loop order. (Actually all configurations have zero classical energy.) Hence our results will not be sensitive to this order parameter and we may safely omit it.1\nThe topological lower bound of the classical energy is saturated when the following Bogomolny equation holds\n\u2202\u03d5 \u2202x \u00fe\nffiffiffi 2 p W \u00fe ffiffiffi 2 p \u03c3W \u00bc 0: \u00f02\u00de\nIn this study we take the superpotential to be\nW \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 2 p \u00f01 \u2212 \u03d52\u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhich is of the \u03d54 model type in the no impurity limit. In particular, we consider the nonlocalized impurity [21,22]\n\u03c3j\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc j 2 tanh\u00f0x\u00de \u2212 1; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere j \u2265 0 is the parameter that measures the strength of the impurity. The BPS solutions in this self-dual impurity model are\n\u03d5\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u2212 cosh jx \u2212 a\ncoshjx\u00fe a : \u00f05\u00de\nWe may take either a \u2208 \u00f0\u22121;\u221e\u00de or\na \u00bc \u22121\u00fe ejx0 with x0 \u2208 R; \u00f06\u00de\nas the variation parameter that parameterizes the shape of the BPS soliton profiles. For x0 \u226b 1 the BPS solutions represent infinitely widely separated kink-antikink pairs of the \u03d54 model as shown in Fig. 1. Also, as x0 tends to 0, the kink and antikink approach each other. For small impurities with 0 < x0 \u2272 1, a BPS solution is similar to a kink-antikink pair in the \u03d54 model with small separation. However, for large impurities, the BPS solutions develop wells at the center. The variation parameter x0 was interpreted as the distance between the BPS soliton and the impurity [22] because of these particular features.\n1In general, this parameter should be chosen to make the leading quantum correction small; otherwise higher order effects will presumably be sizable.\n036003-2\nIn general BPS solutions saturate the topological energy bound and the static energy thus only depends on the boundary values of the soliton. In our case this has the important consequence that this energy is independent of the strength j of the impurity. Hence there is no (static) force between the BPS soliton and the impurity. Obviously the superpotential vanishes at \u03d5 \u00bc 1 which are the two possible vacua. At spatial infinity the soliton approaches \u03d5 \u00bc \u22121, which we thus call the primary vacuum. The equality between the profiles at positive and negative spatial infinity actually leads to a vanishing classical energy. Unless x0 is very small, the soliton also occupies the secondary vacuum at \u03d5 \u00bc \u00fe1 in a sizable region of space. This region grows with x0. The possibility of occupying such a secondary vacuum has been recently related to quantum destabilization of solitons [11]. In the next step, we investigate the behavior of the scattering potential. We do this by considering a small perturbation of the BPS solitons \u03d5\u00f0x;t\u00de\u00bc\u03d5\u00f0x\u00de\u00fe\u03b7\u00f0x\u00dee\u2212i\u03c9t. Substituting this into Eq.

            "heading": "V. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE VPE",
            "text": "In this section, we report the results from our numerical simulations of the one-loop VPE discussed above. We solve Eq. (21) using the fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm with an adaptive step size control for various values of j and x0. That is, we compute the quantum correction to the energy as a function of the variational parameter, x0 with respect to which the classical energy is degenerate. As indicated earlier, the BPS solution behaves like a superposition of the kink-antikink configuration in the \u03d54 model approximated by\n\u03d5R\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc tanh j 2 \u00f0x\u00fe R\u00de \u2212 tanh j 2 \u00f0x \u2212 R\u00de \u2212 1; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere R indicates the position of the kink. This configuration gives rise to the scattering potential\nuR\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 3j2\n2 \u00bd\u03d52R\u00f0x\u00de \u2212 1 : \u00f024\u00de\nIn Fig. 2 we also compare this to the BPS scattering potential. We see that j \u00bc 1 best approximates the kinkantikink configuration of the \u03d54 model for x0 \u226b 1. This confirms the approximation, Eq. (15) according towhich the central structure vanishes for this value of jwhen x0 is large. The only difference is that the position of the potential minimum is somewhat larger thanR; of course this is just the additional ln 2 identified in Sec. III. For j\u2273 5 the noncentral structures of u\u00f0x\u00de almost exactlymatchuR\u00f0x\u00de, with the same small deviation of the minimum position from R. We display the results for \u0394E as a function of x0 from our numerical simulations for other impurity values in Tables I\u2013V, each referring to different values of j. We observe that \u0394E decreases when increasing x0 from a small finite value to infinity. For small j it does so monotonously but develops a tiny local minimum at a moderate x0 when j increases. This is due to the attractive central structure of u\u00f0x\u00de. The position of the local minimum moves to smaller values of x0 as j increases. This is also obvious from the graphs in Fig. 4. Hence we conclude that for a significantly strong impurity the quantum corrections resolve the classical degeneracy while for weak impurities x0 \u2192 \u221e is favored, which causes the soliton to be unstable. From Fig. 4 and Table IV we immediately recognize an energy minimum for j \u00bc 2. For j \u00bc 1.5 the existence of such a\nvery shallow minimum is not obvious from the figure. However, the data \u0394E\u00f07.0\u00de \u2212 \u0394E\u00f015.0\u00de \u00bc \u22120.0004 indeed indicate the existence of a minimum already for j \u00bc 1.5. Even though this small difference is of the order of the numerical accuracy we conjecture that minima emerge for all j > 1 since for this value and large enough x0 the central structure of u\u00f0x\u00de turns from repulsive to attractive at j \u00bc 1; as discussed in Sec. III. Eventually the VPE saturates when x0 is large enough because the various structures in u\u00f0x\u00de separate without changing their shapes as x0 grows further. For weak impurities the asymptotic value is (approximately) reached only for very large x0 but the saturation position decreases as j increases. Again, this can be understood from the discussion in Sec. III: the larger j, the better the approximation coshj\u00f0x \u2212 x0\u00de \u2248 ej\u00f0x\u2212x0\u2212ln 2\u00de. With increasing impurity strength the local minimum in \u0394E moves to smaller x0 values and the x0 behavior of the soliton profile shown in Fig. 1 suggests that the soliton eventually loses its kink-antikink shape. The case j \u00bc 1 is particularly interesting because we have conjectured that the central structure becomes\nirrelevant as x0 increases and that the potential in the vicinity of x0 is of P\u00f6schl-Teller type with l \u00bc 2. That is exactly the background potential induced by the kink in a \u03d54 model. And indeed we see from Table III that \u0394E approaches \u22120.66623 asymptotically which is twice the Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu [27] value \u00f0 1\n4 ffiffi 3 p \u2212 3 2\u03c0\u00de \u2248\n\u22120.333127 for the VPE of the \u03d54 kink soliton for unit mass parameter. Though supported by the analytical considerations in Sec. III in the limit of large x0, this agreement occurs already for moderate x0. For example, for x0 \u00bc 5 the difference in the VPEs is just about 1%."

As in the case of \u0394E, \u0394EKK\u0304 is purely repulsive for small and moderate j. However, for j\u2273 2 a local minimum emerges. The x0 position of this minimum approaches the center as j increases. We therefore conclude that the attraction for larger j is not only a property of the central structure of the fluctuation potential but also signals an attractive quantum contribution to the kink-antikink interaction. The energies shown in Fig. 5 suggest that the interaction becomes arbitrarily strongly repulsive as x0 approaches zero. Thus would eventually prevent the kinkantikink system from collapsing (as it may in the pure \u03d54 model). Unfortunately, extracting this interaction via Eq. (26) becomes an invalid procedure in that interesting limit."

            "heading": "VII. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We have computed the leading (one-loop) quantum correction to soliton energies in an BPS-impurity model in one time and one space dimensions. Our motivation for this study was twofold. First, with the model parameters set to the BPS case, the classical energy is degenerate with respect to a continuous real parameter. Usually one trusts the computation of the leading quantum correction only when it is (significantly) smaller than the classical counterparts; otherwise it is very likely that even higher order corrections are equally important and should not be omitted. (See, e.g., Ref. [29] for estimates beyond one loop.) However, when comparing classically degenerate configurations, the classical energy is irrelevant and the quantum corrections are decisive for selecting the favorable configuration. Second, the above mentioned continuous parameter can be associated with the separation of a kinkantikink pair in the renowned \u03d54 kink model, at least for moderate and large values. This allows us to investigate the quantum corrections to the kink-antikink interaction, which, due the emergence of unstable fluctuation modes, is unfortunately not directly possible in the \u03d54 kink model. In this model the soliton solution generates a potential for the quantum fluctuations with three structures. We have identified these structure from analytic considerations and also by exploring the bound state structure. Two of these structures can be associated with the kink and the antikink at the respective positions while the impurity induces a central structure in between. For small strengths of the impurity the central structure is repulsive but gets more and more attractive as this strength is increased. As consequences, for weak impurities the quantum fluctuations destabilize the soliton in the sense that it is energetically favorable to pull the kink and the antikink components\n036003-8\ninfinitely far apart. This means that the soliton occupies a secondary vacuum in an ever increasing region of space. Hence this instability is conceptually similar to the one previously observed in the Shifman-Voloshin model. As the strength increases the potential extracted from the quantum fluctuations develops a minimum that determines the favorable value of the parameter with respect to which the classical energy is degenerate. The more the impurity strength is increased the more the soliton loses its kinkantikink shape. When we remove the central structure from the potential, we can get some insight into the quantum corrections to the kink-antikink interaction in the \u03d54 model. Unfortunately, the corresponding results depend on the impurity strength so that we cannot make a general statement. However, we find that these corrections are mostly repulsive, only for large strengths a moderate attraction occurs. We note that the choice for the impurity is somewhat arbitrary. The choice considered in Ref. [30] generates an antikink. Similar to the present case, the classical energy is not dependent on the distance between the centers of the\nantikink and the impurity. Using the technique4 of Ref. [31], those authors hence computed the quantum correction to the energy as a function of that distance but did not observe a local minimum. It would be interesting to verify that result using the spectral method approach. Eventually the comparison of the VPEs for various impurities can further disentangle the effects stemming from the soliton on one side and the impurity on the other."
