    "abstractText": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the intermediates or final products of biological metabolism and participates in many important biological processes of life activities. The detection of H2O2 is of great significance in clinical disease monitoring, environmental protection, and bioanalysis. In this study, Ti3C2-based nanohybrids are prepared by the biological modification and self-assembled peptide nanosheets (PNSs)-based biomimetic synthesis of copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs), which show potential application in the fabrication of low-cost and high-performance electrochemical H2O2 biosensors. The synthesized CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical performance towards H2O2, in which CuS NPs can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 and realize the transformation from a chemical signal to an electrical signal to achieve the purpose of H2O2 detection. The prepared CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2-based electrochemical biosensor platform exhibits a wide detection range (5 \u03bcM\u201315 mM) and a low detection limit (0.226 \u03bcM). In addition, it reveals good selectivity and stability and can realize the monitoring of H2O2 in a complex environment. The successful biomimetic synthesis of CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 hybrid nanomaterials provides a green and friendly strategy for the design and synthesis of functional nanomaterials and also provides a new inspiration for the construction of highly effective electrochemical biosensors for practical detection of H2O2 in various environments.",

            "text": "As a very important biomolecule that is related to biological reaction processes, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is of great importance in food science, industrial production, clinical medicine, and biological life activities. In particular, H2O2 is a very important substance involved in the metabolism of living organisms, but excessive accumulation of H2O2 can cause irreparable damage to cells and living organisms [1,2]. Therefore, the level of H2O2 has become an important parameter to determine whether the cells are normal or not, and the detection of H2O2 has become a key factor in the early diagnosis of some diseases. Among various methods for the detection of H2O2, electrochemical detection has the characteristics of being a simple operation and having a low detection limit, high sensitivity, and good selectivity; therefore, it has great potential for the detection of H2O2 with high sensing performance [3\u20136]. In order to fabricate high-performance electrochemical H2O2 biosensors, it is necessary to find active materials with good electrochemical properties. The easy surface modification, large specific surface area, and unique layered structure of two-dimensional (2D) materials have tremendous advantages for the design and fabrication of electrochemical sensors and biosensors [7\u201311]. As one of the emerging 2D materials, MXene is mainly composed of layered transition metal carbides or nitrides. MXene has shown powerful capabilities in catalysis, biosensing, capacitors, and electrochemistry by\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 14. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13010014 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 14 2 of 15\nvirtue of its large specific surface area, potential surface modifiability, good biocompatibility, excellent electrical conductivity, and high electron transfer effects [12\u201314]. Compared with graphene, which opens the door for 2D materials, Ti3C2 MXene materials with faster electron mobility are endowed with enhanced electrical conductivity, and studies have been conducted using Ti3C2 nanohybrids for various electrochemical sensors. For example, Ti3C2 has been modified with platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) for electrochemical detection of H2O2. The Ti3C2/Pt NPs-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) exhibited a stronger redox capability and also revealed a lower detection limit and better stability for the detection of H2O2 [15]. Therefore, it is important to take advantage of the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2 in combination with other materials to increase the abundance of Ti3C2 surface groups, in order to further improve the biocompatibility and electrochemical properties of Ti3C2 nanosheets [16]. Peptide is a kind of widely used biomolecule with a tailored self-assembly function, which consists of amino acids that are arranged in a certain sequence. The amino and carboxyl groups at the head and tail (or on the side chains) of peptides are able to complex and coordinate with metals or metal oxides, thus enhancing the biocompatibility of metals. It has been demonstrated that metal ions play a very important role in the self-assembly process of some peptides [17,18]. For instance, Vello et al. studied the reciprocal recognition of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) by Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions and found that A\u03b2 fibrils encapsulated with Cu(II) were able to generate reactive oxygen species, which can lead to cell death in the presence of H2O2 and reducing agents [19]. Additionally, the charge carried by the peptide changes with the pH of the solution system. The pH of the peptide in electroneutrality is called its isoelectric point, and this property enables it to adsorb metal ions through electrostatic interactions under the modulation of the external environment. For instance, in the work of Liu et al., a peptide with the isoelectric point of 9.94 was used to adsorb Ag+ in a neutral environment, and then Na2S was used for the in-situ reduction of Ag+ on the peptides to form Ag2S NPs for photothermal therapy of tumors [20]. Peptidebased nanomaterials with good morphology and functionality can be easily obtained by designing the peptide sequence and controlling the self-assembly conditions, which can be further used as a bridge between materials to construct hybrid nanomaterials with unique structures and desirable properties [21\u201324]. In the conjugation process of peptides with 2D materials, the cross-linking agents are usually required to achieve the binding. Glutaraldehyde (GA) is a widely used biological cross-linking agent whose aldehyde groups can react with -OH or -NH4 groups to achieve the cross-linking. In the work of Ou et al., the binding of GO with cellulose was achieved by GA-based linking, where both GO and cellulose surfaces are rich in the presence of -OH groups, and where GA binds to the -OH groups on the cellulose surface at one end and to the -OH group on the GO surface at the other end [25]. Besides reacting with the -OH group, GA is also capable of cross-linking with the -NH4 group. The surface of Ti3C2 that is synthesized by the etching method is rich in the -OH group, which can react with the aldehyde group of GA, while the aldehyde group at the other end of GA can react with the -OH group or the -NH4 group of peptide molecules to realize the combination. Therefore, GA-modified Ti3C2 will widen the distance between Ti3C2 nanosheets and narrow the force between nanosheets, making Ti3C2 have better dispersion and stability. In this work, GA is used as a cross-linking agent to connect Ti3C2 with self-assembled peptide nanosheets (PNSs) to enrich the Ti3C2 surface groups. The peptide with the sequence KLVFFAK is selected to modify the Ti3C2 surface for this aim. The peptide sequence KLVFFAK is derived from a partial fragment of \u03b2-amyloid and is able to form nanosheets of moderate thickness and size through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions [26\u201328]. By modulating the selfassembly of KLVFFAK peptides, smaller size PNSs are prepared and modified onto the Ti3C2 surface by GA-based cross-linking, which leads to an increase in the type and number of groups on the Ti3C2 surface. At the same time, the isoelectric point of the KLVFFAK peptide is 10.6, and the PNSs formed by the peptide self-assembly under neutral and acidic environments have a negative charge, which enhances the electronegativity of Ti3C2 after\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 14 3 of 15\nthe modification and facilitates the subsequent binding with metal ions. CuS nanoparticles (NPs) were selected to improve the catalytic performance of PNSs/Ti3C2 hybrid materials. As a common metal, copper ion has good electrical conductivity and catalytic performance. It has been widely used in electrochemical sensors, carbon enrichment products, and hydrogen evolution reactions [29,30]. Additionally, sulfides are important semiconductor materials due to their metal-like properties for chemical sensing, and it should be noted that there is an additional advantage of cost-effectiveness of copper sulfide due to its Earth abundant property [31,32]. As shown in Scheme 1, the synthesized Ti3C2 nanosheets are cross-linked with selfassembled PNSs by GA linking to form the PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids with abundant negative charges on the surface. Then, the adsorption of Cu2+ is achieved by electrostatic interaction between PNSs and Cu2+, and the in situ biomimetic synthesis of CuS NPs on the prepared PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids is carried out by adding Na2S as the reaction agent, which is a green and friendly biomimetic synthesis method for the CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids. Further, the created CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids are modified onto the surface of GCE to construct the electrochemical H2O2 sensor platform. The fabricated biosensor platform exhibits good stability and high sensitivity, with a detection range of 5 \u00b5M\u201315 mM and a minimum detection limit of 0.226 \u00b5M. As an economic, highly catalytic, and electroactive material for detecting H2O2, the CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2-based electrochemical sensor platform has the advantages of excellent sensitivity, extremely high interference immunity, and long-term stability, showing potential applications for high-performance determination of H2O2 in biological and natural environments.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\nmodulating the self-assembly of KLVFFAK peptides, smaller size PNSs are prepared and\nmodified onto the Ti3C2 surface by GA-based cross-linking, which leads to an increase in\nthe type and number of groups on the Ti3C2 surface.

In brief, 1 mg LiF was dissolved in 20 mL HCl (12 M) for 10 min with magnetic stirring. Next, 1 mg Ti3AlC2 was added and magnetically stirred at 35 \u25e6C in a water bath for 24 h.

Monolayer Ti3C2 nanosheets were obtained by sonicating the obtained solution for 30 min, and the middle part of the supernatant was collected for morphological characterizations. Clay-like multilayer Ti3C2 on the bottom of the centrifuge tubes was added into DMSO to intercalate under magnetic stirring overnight. To remove DMSO, a dialysis operation was applied. The sodium ascorbate solution was used as the exchange solvent to exchange DMSO for 24 h. Finally, freeze-drying was used to obtain the monolayer Ti3C2 pounds for further use."

Results\n3.1. Characterizations of Ti3C2 and PNSs\nThe AFM technique was first used to characterize the prepared Ti3C2 monolayered\nnanosheets and self-assembled PNSs. It can be seen from Figure 1a that the Ti3C2\nnanosheets were successfully prepared by HF etching for 24 h in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. In\nthe obtained AFM image, the height of the Ti3C2 nanosheets is measured to be about 1.5\nnm, which reveals good height distribution and agrees well with the height data previ-\nously reported for the Ti3C2 monolayer. In the corresponding TEM image (Figure 1b), the\nTi3C2 nanosheets can also be se n clearly, a d the size of the Ti3C2 nanosheets is between\n200 nm and 1 \u00b5m, wh ch is similar to the size that is shown n th presented AFM image.\nTherefore, we suggest that both AFM and TEM images prove that the Ti3C2 monolayered\nnanosheets with good distribution and uniform size were synthesized successfully.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 14 6 of 15\nIn previous studies, it has been reported that the peptide with the sequence KLVFFAK could self-assemble into 2D peptide nanoribbons (PNRs) with a width of 200 nm and a length of more than 1 \u00b5m [35,36]. If the PNRs are used to modify Ti3C2 nanosheets, the size of the PNRs is bigger than that of the Ti3C2 nanosheets, which may cause the aggregation of Ti3C2 monolayers on the PNRs. Due to the aggregation of layers, the rate of electron movement of Ti3C2 multilayers is slower than that of Ti3C2 monolayers, which would significantly reduce the performance of electrochemical properties of peptide-based materials. Based on those studies, we tailored the self-assembly conditions of peptide molecules and synthesized PNSs with modernity size, which then can be modified onto the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets for the formation of stable nanohybrids. As shown in Figure 1c, the formed self-assembled PNSs present a small size with a height of about 3 nm. The corresponding TEM image that is shown in Figure 1d indicates that the size of the formed PNSs is about 100\u2013300 nm, which is much smaller than that of the Ti3C2 nanosheets, and could be suitable for the synthesis of Ti3C2 monolayer-based hybrid nanomaterials through GA linking. In previous study, it has been found that the peptide with the KLVFFAK sequence can form nanostructures through the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction. Dai et al. found that the addition of inorganic salts would induce KLVFFAK to form large and thin nanobelts, and the size of nanobelts would increase with an increase in the salt concentration [37]. In the simulation study of Liang et al., the VFFA, KFFA, and FFFA sequences could self-assemble to form nanosheet structures, but VFFA, as the core of the KLVFFAK sequence, was less capable of forming large sheets than the other two sequences, and the VFFA sequence tended to form small nanosheet structures [38]. In the self-assembly system of this study, TFA can better dissolve the peptide powder, improve the dispersion of peptides in solution, and reduce the aggregation of polypeptide monomers, which makes it possible to form small-size nanostructures. At the same time, ethanol provides a more polar environment for the self-assembly of peptides, which tends to break the ring to form large-size nanosheets, thus facilitating the formation of small-size nanosheets."

Discussion\nIn this study, monolayered Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets with good morphology and\ngood structure were synthesized by HF etching and DMSO intercalation. At the same\ntime, in view of the fact that the edge of Ti3C2 is easy to oxidize, DMSO is replaced by\nsodium ascorbate by dialysis to protect Ti3C2, which slows down the rate of oxidation and\nprolongs the shelf life, addressing the problem that Ti3C2 is easily oxidized and decom-\nposed into titanium dioxide in air. At the same time, in order to increase the richness and\nbiocompatibility of Ti3C2 surface functional groups, PNSs were used to modify and func-\ntionalize the Ti3C2 surface. Through the design of the peptide sequence and the regulation\nof its self-assembly conditions, the PNSs with good morphology, moderate size, and neg-\native charge in neutral condition were obtained. In order to realize the strong combination\nbetween Ti3C2 and PNS, GA was used as the bridge between them. The aldehyde group\nat one end of GA binds with the -OH group on the surface of Ti3C2, and the other end\nbinds with the -NH4 group of PNSs to realize the recombination between them. Finally,\nto further improve the electrochemical performance of the materials, Na2S was used for in\nsitu chemical reaction with Cu2+ to one-step synthesize CuS NPs without using additional\nreagent and waste production, meanwhile greatly improving the chemical properties of\nthe CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrid materials.\nFigure 6.

Finally, to further improve the electrochemical performance of the materials, Na2S was used for in situ chemical reaction with Cu2+ to one-step synthesize CuS NPs without using additional reagent and waste production, meanwhile greatly improving the chemical properties of the CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrid materials. Ti3C2 with large specific surface area can be loaded with PNSs on a large scale, which provides abundant binding sites for the nucleation and growth of CuS NPs. The one-step synthesis of CuS NPs on the surface of PNSs/Ti3C2 by direct reaction of sodium sulfide to prepare CuS-PNSs/Ti3C2 hybrid materials is a green, convenient, and environment-friendly biomimetic synthesis method. By using biomolecules as bridges and in-situ chemical reaction to synthesize sulphide NPs, the combination of metal sulfides and 2D materials is realized, which provides a new strategy and idea for the development of functional biosensors with good stability and selectivity. It has a broad prospect in biological detection, clinical application and environmental monitoring. Based on the above AFM, TEM, SEM, and XPS analysis, it is confirmed that the CuS\u2212PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids have been synthesized successfully. At the same time, the biosensor platform has good electrochemical performance, anti\u2212interference, and stability. Compared with another H2O2 detection platforms in Table 1, the CuS\u2212PNSs/Ti3C2\u2212based electrochemical biosensor platform in this study has a lower detection limit and a wider detection range of H2O2 concentration [39\u201341]. Therefore, in view of the wide detection range, low detection limit, and high sensitivity of the CuS\u2212PNS/Ti3C2\u2212based electrochemical sensors, it is suggested that it can be applied in the detection of H2O2 in a real environment, clinical detection, environmental protection, and biomedicine.\nIn the CuS\u2212PNSs/Ti3C2 nanohybrids, the Ti3C2 nanosheets loaded with peptides provide binding sites for the formation of CuS NPs. At the same time, the existence of peptides promotes the dispersion of CuS NPs and prevents the performance degradation caused by the aggregation of NPs. In addition, for the synthesis of CuS NPs, a green and environment\u2212friendly biomimetic synthesis method was adopted, and CuS NPs were formed in situ at the Cu2+ binding sites directly by using the self\u2212assembled PNSs as templates. Compared with the traditional methods for CuS synthesis, such as the microwave\u2212assisted solvothermal, chemical coprecipitation, and sol\u2212gel synthesis, biomimetic synthesis in this current study is greener and more environmentally friendly, and there is no extra solvent and no additional waste liquid [42\u201346]. Furthermore, biomimetic CuS NPs can increase their biocompatibility to a certain extent and have more advantages for biological applications."
