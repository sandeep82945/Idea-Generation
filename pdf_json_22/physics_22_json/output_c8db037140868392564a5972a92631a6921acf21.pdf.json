    "abstractText": "Iron-Cobalt ferromagnetic alloys are promoted for electrical energy conversion in aeronautic applications, but their high magnetostrictive coefficients may result in undesired behaviors. Internal stresses can be tuned to limit magnetostriction but must be adequately assessed in a non-destructive way during production. For this, directional magnetic incremental permeability is proposed in this work. For academic purposes, internal stresses have been replaced by homogenous external stress, which is easier to control using traction/compression testbench and results in similar effects. Tests have been limited to tensile stress stimuli, the worst-case scenario for magnetic stress observation on positive magnetostriction coefficient materials. Hysteresis cycles have been reconstructed from the incremental permeability measurement for stability and reproducibility of the measured quantities. The directionality of the sensor provides an additional degree of freedom in the magnetic response observation. The study reveals that an angle of \u03c0/2 between the DC (Hsurf DC) and the AC (Hsurf AC) magnetic excitations with a flux density Ba at Hsurf DC = 10 kA\u00b7m\u22121 constitute the ideal experimental situation and the highest correlated parameter to a homogeneous imposed tensile stress. Magnetic incremental permeability is linked to the magnetic domain wall bulging magnetization mechanism; this study thus provides insights for understanding such a mechanism.",

As the level of required electrical power increases, so do the mass of electrical appliances since the weight/power ratio remains challenging to reduce [1]. In the case of onboard transformers [2], an industrial solution for the increase in power density consists of developing new magnetic materials such as iron-cobalt alloys. High power density gains (up to 10% and more) are, for instance, expected with Fe-27%Co compound. This material exhibits the highest saturation magnetization of all known soft ferromagnetic materials (>2.4 T) [3]. Unfortunately, FeCo alloys\u2019 astonishing saturation magnetization is associated with substantial magnetostrictive effects. These effects result in large deformation and significant undesired acoustic noise [4,5]. There are many ways to reduce magnetostriction, including the development of appropriate textures [4,6]. In [7], B. Nabi et al. claimed that\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22166296 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 2 of 16\nmagnetostriction in Fe-27%Co alloy is a consequence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy partly linked to the sheet crystallographic texture and, by developing a Goss texture, much better magnetic properties will be observed including a lower magnetostriction. Tuning internal stresses is another promising solution [8]. Mechanical Internal Stress (MIS) is crucial in iron alloys\u2019 magnetic and mechanical performance. MIS originates from various mechanisms, including plastic deformations, temperature gradients, or microstructural changes. Manufacturing processes including machining, welding, shot peening, heat treatment, and grinding are sources of MIS. All MIS estimation methods are indirect. They start with the measurement of a coupled physical quantity and finish with a calculation stage [9]. The hole-drilling method [10] (see Figure 1 for illustration), the contour method [11], the crack compliance method [12], and the stripping method [9] are the most conventional mechanical methods. Together with the chemical processes [9], they constitute the so-called destructive techniques.\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0 17\u00a0

been described [13\u201315]. These methods include diffraction (X-ray, Neutron), ultrasounds, or acoustic emission [16]. In the case of conductive and/or ferromagnetic parts, electromagnetic NDT is often indicated. Eddy currents testing [17], magneto-acoustic emission [18,19], electromagnetic acoustic transducer [6], and Magnetic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) [20\u201322] are the most popular ones [23]. These methods offer fast respo se, low cost, small size, and easy maintenance, but their current in ustrial developme ts are limited, and their efficiency is ques ionable. Very few of them have cross d the threshold betwe n aca emia and industry. Based on MBN m asurements, the Stresstech controller (Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland) is, however, one of them [9]. A significant problem for this device comes from a quasi-impossibility to distinguish the effect of MIS from other dependent properties (dislocations, grain size, texture, plastic strain, precipitates, phase changes, impurities, etc.). The micromagnetic, multi-parametric, microstructure and stress analysis (3MA) developed by IZFP Fraunhofer institute (Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany) is an interesting alternative. 3MA accumulates and combines data from different magnetization signatures and identifies the ultimate magnetic combination of indicators to a given targeted property (hardness, internal stress, yield strength, etc.) [24]. 3MA is pragmatic and efficient but needs time-consuming experimental campaigns and provides non-transposable results. All magnetic MIS controllers have been designed on the same principles that use a unidirectional magnetization induced by a powerful electromagnet combined with local surface sensors to observe the magnetic answers [25]. A current research trend of alternative and/or self-made magnetic sensors for magnetic NDT measurements is perceptible in the literature [26,27]. While attractive in terms of sensor reproducibility and stability, these\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 3 of 16\ninnovations fail to accurately showcase the claim for directional selectivity of the magnetic sensor as they are applied in angular-dependent measurements. In Figure 14 of [21], however, simulation predictions on FeCo alloys show that stress effects on the magnetic response can be more visible when the magnetic excitation and the stress direction are not colinear and that a directional sensor would probably bring significant improvement in the stress observation. Among the magnetic methods, just a few can enforce directional measurements. Point probes [28,29] and MBN are one of them [30] but not tested in this study. Instead, we opted for Magnetic Incremental Permeability (MIP, \u00b5MIP), as the first results over stress dependency were auspicious ([31], Figure 13 in [32]). MIP is based on the domain walls bulging magnetization mechanism (reversible magnetization variations), as observed under low amplitude magnetic excitation variations. This mechanism appears to be very sensitive to MIS [31]. So far, MIP has almost always been observed with pancake (Figure 2, left-hand side) or wound coils preventing access to directional information. Still, this limitation can be overcome using double coils Transmitter/Receptor adjacent TR-probes as depicted on the right-hand side of Figure 2.\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 17\u00a0

present study by using a miniature U-shape ferrite magnetic core. MIS is impossible to be precisely controlled; thus, it has been replaced by external stress. The effect on the magnetization process is considered independent of the stress origin. Tests were limited to tensile stress, constituting the worstcase scenario for stress observation. Iron-Cobalt alloys have positive magnetostriction coefficients, and tensile stress softens the magnetic behavior. As an already soft material, limited tensile stress effects can be observed in the Ba(Hsurf) classic hysteresis cycles (where Ba is the flux density, and Hsurf is the tangential magnetic excitation field). Hysteresis cycles were reconstructed for all MIP measurements providing a stable and reproducible signature. Then, indicators read on these cycles were defined and plotted vs. the homogeneous tensile stress. Pearso factors were calculated and a alyzed to establish their correlati n level with the xternal t n il stress. Conclusions w re drawn regarding the non-dest uctive testing objective and the physical properties of the domain wall bulging. This manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental conditions, including sensors and tested specimens. Section 3 gives the experimental results. Section 4 provides analysis, discussions, and conclusions. Among them, the optimal conditions arise for a mechanical tensile stress estimation based on directional MIP.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 4 of 16"

From Z to the FeCo \u00b5MIP The interpretation of measurements displayed in Section 3.2.2 is facilitated by returning the physical quantities. For this, the relation between IZI and \u00b5MIP for the FeCo sheet MIP needs to be established. The solution opted out in this study is based on a magnetic reluctance scheme. Even inexact as relying on simplifying assumptions, it allows quickly estimating the permeability with satisfactory accuracy. Additional post-processing checking the validity of the resulting MIP was also performed: we ran comparisons between incremental \u00b5MIP and differential\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 9 of 16\n\u00b5Diff permeabilities (from Figure 9 results) in the saturated zone where they are supposed to be similar. These comparisons are available in Table 1. Figure 10 describes the method: reluctancesR1 andR2 are associated with the ferrite core and the FeCo sheet, respectively. The magnetic contact between the ferrite core and the sheet is supposed ideal; thus, with a total absence of airgap. Then, by assumingR2>>R1, this simplified approach leads to a linear relationship between the imaginary part of Z\u201d and the relative permeability \u00b5r:\n\u00b5r = Z\u2032\u2032 \u00b7l2\n\u00b50\u00b7N2\u00b7A2\u00b7\u03c9 (3)\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 17\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a09.\u00a0IZI(Hsurf)\u00a0for\u00a0different\u00a0tensile\u00a0stress\u00a0levels\u00a0and\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0MIP\u00a0sensor\u00a0aligned\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0length\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0tested\u00a0specimen\u00a0as\u00a0illustrated\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0left\u2010hand\u00a0side\u00a0incrustation.\u00a0 3.2.3.\u00a0From\u00a0Z to\u00a0the\u00a0FeCo\u00a0\u03bcMIP\u00a0 The\u00a0interpretation\u00a0of\u00a0measurements\u00a0displayed\u00a0in\u00a0Section\u00a03.2.2\u00a0is\u00a0facilitated\u00a0by\u00a0return\u2010 ing\u00a0the\u00a0physical\u00a0quantities.\u00a0For\u00a0this,\u00a0the\u00a0relation\u00a0between\u00a0IZI\u00a0and\u00a0\u03bcMIP\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0FeCo\u00a0sheet\u00a0 MIP\u00a0needs\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0established.\u00a0 \u00a0 The\u00a0solution\u00a0opted\u00a0out\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0study\u00a0is\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0magnetic\u00a0reluctance\u00a0scheme.\u00a0Even\u00a0 inexact\u00a0as\u00a0relying\u00a0on\u00a0simplifying\u00a0assumptions,\u00a0it\u00a0allows\u00a0quickly\u00a0estimating\u00a0the\u00a0permea\u2010 bility\u00a0with\u00a0satisfactory\u00a0accuracy.\u00a0Additional\u00a0post\u2010processing\u00a0checking\u00a0the\u00a0validity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 resulting\u00a0MIP\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0performed:\u00a0we\u00a0ran\u00a0comparisons\u00a0between\u00a0incremental\u00a0\u03bcMIP\u00a0and\u00a0dif\u2010 ferential\u00a0\u03bcDiff\u00a0permeabilities\u00a0(from\u00a0Figure\u00a09\u00a0results)\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0saturated\u00a0zone\u00a0where\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0 supposed\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0similar.\u00a0These\u00a0comparisons\u00a0are\u00a0available\u00a0in\u00a0Table\u00a01.\u00a0Figure\u00a010\u00a0describes\u00a0 the\u00a0method:\u00a0reluctances\u00a0 1\u00a0and\u00a0 2\u00a0are\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ferrite\u00a0core\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0FeCo\u00a0sheet,\u00a0 respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0magnetic\u00a0 contact\u00a0between\u00a0 the\u00a0 ferrite\u00a0 core\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0 sheet\u00a0 is\u00a0 supposed\u00a0 ideal;\u00a0thus,\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0total\u00a0absence\u00a0of\u00a0airgap.\u00a0Then,\u00a0by\u00a0assuming\u00a0 2>> 1,\u00a0this\u00a0simplified\u00a0ap\u2010 proach\u00a0leads\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0linear\u00a0relationship\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0imaginary\u00a0part\u00a0of\u00a0Z\u2033\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0relative\u00a0 permeability\u00a0\u03bcr:\u00a0\n\u2219 \u2219 \u2219 \u2219 \u00a0 (3)\nFigure\u00a010.\u00a0Simplified\u00a0reluctance\u00a0scheme\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0linear\u00a0relation\u00a0between\u00a0Z\u2033\u00a0and\u00a0\u03bcr.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a011\u00a0gives\u00a0the\u00a0resulting\u00a0\u03bcr(Hsurf)\u00a0for\u00a0all\u00a0Figure\u00a09\u00a0tests.\u00a0It\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0noted\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0 curve\u00a0shape\u00a0is\u00a0conserved\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0impedance\u00a0modulus\u00a0|Z|,\u00a0denoting\u00a0negligible\u00a0 electrical\u00a0losses\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0device.\u00a0\nFigure 11 gives the resulting \u00b5r(Hsurf) for all Figure 9 tests.

In NDT, defining indicators read directly on this signature and plot them vs. the targeted properties (i.e., the property to be assessed, MIS, microstructural information, etc.) is classical. For MIP tests, those indicators include the maximum amplitude, the amplitude at the remanence point, the curve width at 50% of max(\u00b5MIP), to name but a few [38]. In this study and for comparison purposes, the indicator definition has been postponed to a final step consisting of reconstructing a MIP hysteresis cycle. Same indicators can be used for the classic and the MIP hysteresis cycles and comparing the stress influence on both these magnetic signatures is facilitated.

Quite interestingly, Ba MIP(Hsurf) loops show opposite behaviors (i.e., the resulting hysteresis loop is laying down, see Figure 13). Iron-Cobalt alloys are characterized by positive magnetostriction, resulting in a magnetic behavior softened by tensile stress. As an already soft material, tensile stress effects on Ba(Hsurf) are limited. Oppositely, a much stronger influence can be detected on the Ba MIP(Hsurf) cycles. This observation opens exciting perspectives and confirms MIP as an excellent alternative for estimating tensile stress stimuli.

Coercivity vs. stress for Ba(Hsurf) and Ba MIP(Hsurf) hysteresis cycles.\nFrom its atomic origin to hu an-scale observation, magnetizati in ferromagnetic steels depends on distinct mechanism . Each mechanism is characterized by its geomet cal scale, time constant, and sensitivity o the physical envir nment (magnetic, mechanical, thermal, etc.). These m chanisms overlap; thus, isolating and listing them is complex. Still, three categories can be established: 1. Structure and kineti s of the magnetic domains (10\u22124\u201310\u22126 m):\n\u2022 Domain walls bulging (rever i le, i the low excitation range); \u2022 Irreversible domain wall motions (middle excitation range); \u2022 Nucleation and annihilation (high range);\n2. Orientation and amplitude of ato ic magnetic moments (10\u221211\u201310\u22129 m):\n\u2022 Magnetization rot tion (high and very high magnetic excitation). 3. Human scale mechanisms:\n\u2022 Macroscopic eddy currents Such a combination makes impossible to isolate the effect of stress on a given mech-\nanism by a unique observation of standard Ba(Hsurf) hysteresis cycles. Oppositely, MIP experimental observation provides privileged access to domain walls bulging. In the recommendation of the literature [39\u201341], MIP is suggested to be run under an alternating magnetic field of amplitude half the coercivity, limiting the domain wall motions to reversible ones. Domain walls bulging is sensitive to the low amplitude of magnetic excitation. Scaling approaches and analogies encourage us to check its sensitivity in a low range of stress. The directionality of domain wall bulging is an open question. Even if according to the manufacturer, FeCo laminations exhibit a not very pronounced crystallographic texture, every material is somehow anisotropic in its magnetic answer, and so it should be for MIP.\nFigure 13 confirms this statement by showing substantial variations over the tested angles. Five indicators directly read on the q-dependent Ba MIP(Hsurf) cycles have been tested to identify the most adapted to a tensile stress estimation:\n1. Coercivity Hc MIP; 2. Remanence Br MIP; 3. Ba MIP(Hsurf) Hysteresis area; 4. Ba MIP at Hsurf = 2 kA\u00b7m\u22121; 5. Ba MIP at Hsurf = 10 kA\u00b7m\u22121.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 13 of 16\nA refined analysis based on Pearson correlation factors \u03c1 reveals Ba MIP at Hsurf = 10 kA\u00b7m\u22121 as the best indicator. Figure 15a depicts its variations vs. \u03c3 and for the ten sensor positions that have been tested.

(b) Related Pearson correlation fact s.\nEven if read on the Ba MIP(Hsurf) cycles, Hc MIP depends on every magnetization mechanism. Oppositely, Ba MIP at Hsurf = 10 kA\u00b7m\u22121 provides a cumulative reflection all along the magnetization cycle of the domain wall bulging mechanism. Concerning the sensor orientation, there is no energetical reason for the domain wall to bulge differently in one direction or the other in a supposedly isotropic material. \u03c3 and Hsurf being parallel, on the first hand, if \u03b8 = 0 rad, the static and dynamic contributions are superimposed, creating an even stronger softening behavior, and accentuating the effect on the material and the behavior differences between the stress levels. Oppositely when\nSensors 2022, 22, 6296 14 of 16\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2 rad, the static and the dynamic contribution operate in quadratic directions, and the sensor measurement is less affected by the softening effect, so that the measure becomes quasi-linearly dependent on \u03c3."

            "text": "The directionality influence of MIP sensors has barely been studied before. In this work, we focus on observing the effect of a tensile stress \u03c3 on the magnetic response for several angles. We found that ideal conditions are reached when Hsurf DC and Hsurf AC exhibit quadratic directions. Ba(Hsurf) standard cycles are straightened by external tensile stress and show little changes. Ba MIP(Hsurf) loops show opposite behaviors and significant variations (Figure 13), confirming MIP as an excellent way to estimate tensile stress stimuli. Among Ba MIP(Hsurf) indicators, Hc MIP depends on all the magnetization mechanisms. Its \u03c3 dependency is evident but not the most linear one. Other Ba MIP(Hsurf) indicators are more specific to the domain wall bulging mechanism and can be used to interpret the influence of \u03c3 on this mechanism. The best result in terms of linear correlation was obtained with Ba MIP at Hsurf = 10 kA.m\u22121 and for q = \u03c0/2 rad (Pearson coefficient \u03c1 \u2248 0.995). Many possibilities can be listed in the follow-up associated with this study; this includes, in the short term, the influence of homogeneous compressive stress. Also, the proposed results should be confirmed on MIS of pre-characterized specimens (by X-ray diffraction, for instance). Eventually, a new type of materials (martensitic stainless steel, low carbon steel, etc.) could be tested. In an even longer-term vision, it would be interesting to check the capability of the directional MIP on other usual magnetic NDT targeted properties, including microstructural properties, aging, etc.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.D., M.L. and L.M.; methodology, B.D., M.L. and L.M.; software, B.T. and B.D.; validation, B.D., M.L. and L.M.; investigation, B.T., B.D., M.L. and L.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.T., B.D., M.L. and L.M.; supervision, B.D., M.L., L.M. and P.T.
