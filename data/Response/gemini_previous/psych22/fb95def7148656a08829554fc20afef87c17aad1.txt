1. **Investigate the neural correlates of social functioning in children and adolescents with ABI using advanced neuroimaging techniques.** This could help identify specific brain regions and networks that are associated with social deficits, and may lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve social functioning.


2. **Examine the impact of age at injury and developmental stage on social outcomes following ABI.** This could help identify critical periods of development during which social functioning is particularly vulnerable to injury, and may inform the timing of interventions to optimize outcomes.


3. **Explore the role of family and environmental factors in social recovery following ABI.** This could help identify modifiable factors that can be targeted to improve social outcomes, such as providing support to families and addressing socioeconomic disparities.


4. **Investigate the prevalence and characteristics of restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) in children and adolescents with ABI.** This could help determine the extent to which RRBs are a common feature of ABI, and whether they are associated with specific injury characteristics or outcomes.


5. **Conduct longitudinal studies to examine the long-term social outcomes of children and adolescents with ABI.** This could help identify factors that contribute to resilience and vulnerability over time, and may inform the development of long-term support services for individuals with ABI and their families.
