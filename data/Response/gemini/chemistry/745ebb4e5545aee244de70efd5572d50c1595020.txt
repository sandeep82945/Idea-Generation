1. **Investigate the antibacterial activity of the modified lysozyme against a wider range of bacteria**, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. This would help to determine the potential of the modified lysozyme as a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent.
2. **Study the effects of the modified lysozyme on the growth and viability of mammalian cells**. This would help to determine the safety and potential toxicity of the modified lysozyme for use in biomedical applications.
3. **Explore the use of the modified lysozyme as a food preservative**. The high antibacterial activity and low toxicity of the modified lysozyme make it a potential candidate for use as a natural food preservative.
4. **Investigate the use of the modified lysozyme in the treatment of bacterial infections**. The modified lysozyme could be used as a topical or systemic treatment for bacterial infections, either alone or in combination with other antibiotics.
5. **Study the mechanisms of action of the modified lysozyme**. This would help to understand how the modified lysozyme kills bacteria and how it can be used to develop new and more effective antibacterial therapies.
