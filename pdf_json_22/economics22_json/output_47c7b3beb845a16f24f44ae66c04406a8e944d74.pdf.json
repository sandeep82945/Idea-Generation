    "abstractText": "Background: Sanctions have direct and indirect impacts on people\u2019s lives. Therefore, the health systems of countries targeted by sanctions must respond effectively. This study proposes a set of mitigating measures and response strategies to improve the health systems of countries under sanctions. Methods: This three-stage study was conducted in Iran within the 2020\u20132021 period, in which a rapid review of evidence was carried out to identify the measures implemented or proposed to make the health system resilient in confronting sanctions. A qualitative approach was then adopted to determine how the health system could be improved to response to sanctions from the perspectives of 10 key experts. Semi-structured interviews and document analysis were conducted for data collection. Finally, a two-round Delphi technique was employed to help eleven experts reach a consensus on a set of mitigating measures, which were then prioritized. Results: In this research, 62 proposed or implemented mitigating measures were extracted from 13 eligible studies to improve the health system performance in confronting sanctions. Moreover, 18 measures were identified in interviews for a better health system response to sanctions. They were then classified as five categories: sustained financing, good governance, integrated and updated health information systems, qualified workforce, and efficient and equitable service delivery. In the first Delphi round, 28 mitigating measures were discovered. Nine measures were identified as more effective and feasible in both short and long runs. They were introduced as below: conducting proactive inventory control, developing the nationally essential list of medicines, providing additional clarification that oil revenues can be freely used for medicines procurement, defining tailored health service packages for vulnerable populations, establishing and enhancing an efficient surveillance system, reducing prices of imported medicines, developing dual policies of equity and priority for vulnerable groups, institutionalizing fair and effective resource allocations, and providing clinical guidelines. Conclusions: According to the findings, the most critical areas for the resilience of a health system in confronting sanctions include strengthening particular components of governance, improving efficiency, and caring for vulnerable populations. The experts collectively emphasized investment in domestic capacities, public participation, and health diplomacy. Despite the proposed measures, it is unclear how effective these are and, especially whether they Haniye Sadat Sajadi and Reza Majdzadeh contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: hsajjadi@tums.ac.ir 1 Knowledge Utilization Research Center, University Research and Development Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 18 Sajadi and Majdzadeh Globalization and Health (2022) 18:107 can significantly affect the harsh impacts of sanctions on health.

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver (http:// creat iveco mmons. org/ publi cdoma in/ zero/1. 0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.\nMethods: This three-stage study was conducted in Iran within the 2020\u20132021 period, in which a rapid review of evidence was carried out to identify the measures implemented or proposed to make the health system resilient in confronting sanctions. A qualitative approach was then adopted to determine how the health system could be improved to response to sanctions from the perspectives of 10 key experts. Semi-structured interviews and document analysis were conducted for data collection. Finally, a two-round Delphi technique was employed to help eleven experts reach a consensus on a set of mitigating measures, which were then prioritized.\nResults: In this research, 62 proposed or implemented mitigating measures were extracted from 13 eligible studies to improve the health system performance in confronting sanctions. Moreover, 18 measures were identified in interviews for a better health system response to sanctions. They were then classified as five categories: sustained financing, good governance, integrated and updated health information systems, qualified workforce, and efficient and equitable service delivery. In the first Delphi round, 28 mitigating measures were discovered. Nine measures were identified as more effective and feasible in both short and long runs. They were introduced as below: conducting proactive inventory control, developing the nationally essential list of medicines, providing additional clarification that oil revenues can be freely used for medicines procurement, defining tailored health service packages for vulnerable populations, establishing and enhancing an efficient surveillance system, reducing prices of imported medicines, developing dual policies of equity and priority for vulnerable groups, institutionalizing fair and effective resource allocations, and providing clinical guidelines.\nConclusions: According to the findings, the most critical areas for the resilience of a health system in confronting sanctions include strengthening particular components of governance, improving efficiency, and caring for vulnerable populations. The experts collectively emphasized investment in domestic capacities, public participation, and health diplomacy.

            "text": "Iran has implemented remarkable initiatives to improve its health system and provide all citizens with accessible healthcare services. These services include expanding the primary healthcare network, integrating medical education programs, training and recruting family physicians, and developing health transformation plans. These efforts have led to significant changes in the public health and improvements in Iran\u2019s health system performance (Table\u00a01). Nevertheless, various threats affect this system. Global threats (e.g., emerging and re-emerging diseases and impacts of climate change), the Middle East issues (i.e., conflicts and wars), nationwide natural disasters, and international sanctions are the main factors that threat Iran\u2019s health system [1].\nIn this regard, political tensions and sanctions are the ongoing potential threats impacting Iran\u2019s health system, especially because they have been intensified for several decades. Various entities have imposed different sanctions against Iran since 1979 [2]. Apart from the negative outcomes of sanctions, Iran\u2019s health system has severely been affected [3]. Although the previous round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations (UN) Security Council against Iran did not concern essential medicines, equipment, and commodities, it caused a 65% reduction (16,000/1 to 26,500/1) in Iran\u2019s Rial to the US Dollar exchange rate during a year, 30% inflation (https://\nwww. cbi. ir), and subsequently more than a one-third decrease in the public purchase power to cover health expenditures [4]. As a result, the under-utilization of health services emerged in the early 2010s in Iran. Allegedly, the imports of finished products, pharmaceutical raw materials [5], and medical devices [6, 7] were disrupted due to bans on the connection between Iranian banks and SWIFT (i.e., Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and on their trades with the global banking system. These bans increased prices of medicines by half [8] and caused the shortage of nearly 73 medicines. Moreover, 48% of these medicines are classified as essential by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIt is also estimated that six million patients faced limited access to necessary treatments [9]. According to a report on cases of thalassemia and haemophilia, there were approximately 60% and 90% shortages of medicines for patients [10]. Another study on diabetes, asthma, cancer, and multiple sclerosis indicated that there were significant shortages in 13 out of 26 medicines due to sanctions [11]. Evidently, the poor and disadvantaged people were more vulnerable and affected severely in all cases of shortages. A recent review demonstrated that sanctions had deprived Iranians of the human right to health [12].\nEvidently, sanctions have adverse effects on the public health and cause significant financial hardships in the accessibility of healthcare services. These outcomes often face the individuals that belong to marginalized and vulnerable groups. Sanctions also degrade health systems, especially with regard to the availability of healthcare services. They can also negatively affect health research and education. Although the evidence is scarce for the quantification of potential effects left by sanctions on different dimensions of the public health, sanctions have negative outcomes in this regard [13, 14].\nDespite Iran\u2019s long history of sanctions, there is inadequate evidence regarding how the health system responds effectively and which mitigating measures are necessary for managing the effects of sanctions [15]. Given the endurance of sanctions against Iran and their direct and indirect effects on people\u2019s lives [3, 16], the health system must respond efficiently to this inconvenience. In fact, a health system should be able to adapt to such pressures or be resilient to the harsh effects of sanctions. The resiliency of a health system refers to the capacity to absorb\nchanges and retain essential functions [17]. The key questions pertain to how well the health system has continued to operate in the face of sanctions and how well vulnerable groups have been protected. Hence, this study proposes a set of mitigating measures and response strategies to improve Iran\u2019s health system performance in the face of sanctions. Furthermore, the proposed measures and strategies are relevant to various countries where economic sovereignty is threatened."

Rapid reviews are among the emerging methods of efficiently synthesizing research evidence in health policies and other settings where a broad overview of research evidence is required quickly [18]. For this purpose, the PRISMA reporting guidelines were adopted in this study. The search strategy was developed in consultation\nwith a librarian and, for the rapid review, was limited to two databases due to time and resource limitations. One author (HSS) searched two English databases (i.e., PubMed and Scopus) to find relevant studies. An additional search attempt in Google Scholar was made with exact keywords in order not to miss any relevant documents. The search strategy was restricted to the English language, and the peer-reviewed papers were published from the inception of these databases. The initial search attempt was made in 2020 and was then updated in 2021. Two broad concepts were selected to ensure that the search strategy addressed the research question: sanction (e.g., embargo, economic sanction, and financial shock) and health (e.g., medical and medicine). For the full search strategy, please refer to Additional file\u00a01: Appendix\u00a01.\nStudies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on primary or secondary research and provided sufficient data regarding the strategies implemented or proposed to improve the health system performance in response to sanctions. Other types of publications (e.g., notes, editorial, commentary, letter, conference proceedings, etc.), studies related to economic/financial crises or shocks due to reasons other than sanction, and studies for which full texts were unavailable were excluded.\nFig. 1 Overview of three stages of the study\nCitations were downloaded to EndNote\u00a9 X9 (Thomson Reuters, New York, USA). Two authors (i.e., HSS and RM) evaluated titles and abstracts and excluded the irrelevant ones. Disagreements were then resolved by consensus. The authors obtained and reviewed full texts of the remaining citations, excluding the ones that did not meet the inclusion criteria. They hand-searched the reference lists of the remaining papers for additional relevant studies.\nData extraction was performed by authors using a standardized form, which included the title, first author\u2019s name, publication date, setting, research design, the method used, details of participants, and main findings related to the implemented or proposed measures to make the health system resilient in response to sanctions.

It was conducted in Iran through a phenomenological approach, aiming to analyze the perspectives of key experts about mitigating measures and strategies to improve the health system in response to sanctions. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews and document analysis were conducted for data collection.\nPurposeful sampling with a maximum diversity method was adopted to select participants, who were the experts familiar with health systems, health policymakers, and managers, particularly during the Iran\u2013Iraq war, financial recessions, and other similar situations. The interviews were conducted through the guidelines developed based on the review results. The participants were asked to express their ideas on what was needed for the effective health system response to sanctions and share their experiences about the mitigating measures and strategies of Iranian authorities to respond to sanctions. These participants were informed prior to the meeting objectives via phone calls or emails. Their conversations were audio-recorded with their consent. Notes were also taken during the discussion. The audio files were then transcribed verbatim. Summaries of the interviews/meetings were emailed to participants for revision and completion if necessary. Moreover, relevant documents such as newspapers, rules, regulations, and formal reports were reviewed.\nThe manifest content analysis was used by one author (HSS) for data analysis, in which we described what the experts said, stayed very close to the text, used the words themselves, and described the visible and obvious in the\ntext [20]. Discussions resolved disagreements, and coding was conducted through inductive and deductive approaches. We also considered the quality criteria such as credibility, dependability, reflexivity, transferability, and confirmability. We then engaged with all participants to build the necessary levels of trust. We also adopted the data triangulation strategy. External audits were then employed to ensure dependability. Working on data collection and analyses, researchers considered the process of critical self-reflection about preferences and preconceptions to guarantee reflexivity. The transferability of the study was ensured by selecting the appropriate experts to participate in interviews. Confirmability was achieved by obtaining the opinions of some participants (i.e., member check)."

As a result, 24 potential experts were identified and double-checked by the research team. Finally, based on the accessibility and affordability of sufficient time for participation, 15 eligible experts were extracted. A brief illustration of the study was distributed to them, and they were invited to the Delphi process via emails. Apart from two, all experts accepted to participate in the study: one declined to participate, and the other could not be contacted. The willing ones were provided additional material about the study and the research method.\nThe Delphi process was performed in 2021 with intervals of three weeks between the first and second rounds. Based on the findings of previous stages, some mitigating measures was prepared. In the first Delphi round, a cover letter was emailed to all experts, who were asked to suggest additional measures that they found important and included in prioritization. The experts individually reflected their opinions and re-sent their comments within a due date (15\u00a0days). A reminder was then emailed a few days before the deadline to maximize the response rate. We reviewed their comments and finalized the mitigating measures.\nBased on the first round of Delphi, a questionnaire was developed. In fact, it was a pilot tested with five health specialists and academicians to examine coherence and face validity before administration. The final\nquestionnaire included 28 mitigating measures and two ranking criteria (i.e., effectiveness and feasibility in both the short and long runs). The experts individually completed the ranking for reflecting their opinions on a 5-point Likert scale (from \u201c1\u201d for \u201cleast priority\u201d to \u201c5\u201d for \u201chighest priority\u201d) and re-sent the questionnaire within a due date (15\u00a0 days). A reminder was emailed a few days before the deadline to maximize the response rate. The characteristics of the participants were also asked on the first page of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was emailed to all experts to invite them to rank each measure based on the prioritization criteria (i.e., feasibility and effectiveness).\nIn order to analyze the second Delphi round, the average score of each criterion for overall measures was determined (note: the average and median scores were nearly identical). These estimates were made for the short and long terms separately. Depending on whether the average score of each measure is higher or lower than the overall average in terms of two criteria (i.e., feasibility and effectiveness), the measures were then classified as four categories: I) effective and feasible, II) effective but not feasible, III) feasible but not effective, and IV) neither effective nor feasible. These categories were used for the final interpretation of measures."

According to many participants, Iran has always faced sanctions, except for a limited time.\n\u201cIran is a country that is actually under sanctions, and many of these sanctions are related to the foreign policy, and the first place that is affected by the sanctions is usually the health sector, and the first place that benefits from the lifting of the sanctions is the health sector, too.\u201d P1.Although efforts to delegitimize sanctions should not be overlooked,\nthe health system must prepare for sanctions to operate better and minimize the damage caused by sanctions.\n\u201cAt least a series of measures should be taken to delegitimize the system of sanctions in the health sector and show the effects of sanctions on the health sector as well as the violation of human rights and basic rights of Iranian citizens.\u201d P1.\nThey highlighted several measures required to make the health system more resilient to the effects of sanctions.

            "text": "Using sustained health financial resources Nearly all participants viewed the availability of resources as a key enabler in making a health system resilient. They said that the health system could overcome disruption when available resources were used strategically. Financial resources are necessary to mobilize other essential resources during sanctions and crises. The sustained protection of healthcare funding was identified as a key ingredient to its resilience. Given the economic status of Iran which mainly depends on oil, it was strongly recommended that diverse and stable financial resources, e.g., taxation or further efficiency, should be employed to minimize the risk of an underfunded response.\n\u201cYou know that national income depends on the sales of oil in Iran. Whenever there is a disturbance in the sales of oil, almost all sectors suffer. The health sector is no exception. We know this, and its effects are also obvious. Now we have to ensure that, as far as possible, the financial resources of the health sector have minimal dependence on oil revenues. We should think about finding more sustainable resources for the health system.\u201d P2. \u201cOur health system should be able to withstand sanctions and make some changes to be less vulnerable during sanctions. For example, do you remember that after the JCPOA, Iran\u2019s income improved a bit, and as a result, the financial resources of the health sector increased? The same health transformation plan was implemented at the same time. It would be better if the health system tried to use these funds to become efficient so that it would not be under pressure if the embargo happened again. For instance, more should be invested in the primary\u00a0health than hospitals.\u201d P7.\nInstitutionalizing fair and\u00a0effective resource allocations Participants stated that the sanctions strongly affected how government resources were allocated to health and how health resources were allocated to various programs. In the absence of priorities and resource allocations, the shares of health expenditures usually reduce, and many health plans fail to be implemented, both of which are considered constant threats. The participants pointed out some of the efforts made in Iran to use a scientific and fair approach for prioritization and allocation of resources in the health sector. However, they believed\nthat these efforts did not lead to the institutionalization of a clear and accurate method for prioritization. Thus, an approach to institutionalized and effective setting priorities and financial resource allocation should be developed to make a health system more resilient.\n\u201cThe embargo there has led to a decrease in our incomes, and economic austerity has been formed after that. These austerity attempts will affect the allocation of resources to our government departments. When the allocation of resources declines, the policies of the Ministry of Health will be revised. How? This revision should be based on the principles of prioritization. Still, because there is no systematic prioritization, priorities are formed based on preferences, which often causes a waste of resources. We need a system that determines how to spend this little money more effectively and efficiently.\u201d P10."

Many participants highlighted the vulnerability of medicines and medical equipment during the embargo period and the importance of selling medicines and medical products at stable prices during sanctions.\n\u201cWe now know the pricing of some medicines, which means it is clear how much this medicine should cost. The same is true for some medical equipment and devices, but this price list is not for all items and is sometimes not updated.

This could nurture the resilience of the system by building trust and empowering, motivating, and creating commitment among staff and other stakeholders.\n\u201cWe have a lot of experience with this. For example, some ministers and deputies turned their words into actions during the war. Regarding sanctions, it is not possible for the minister not to speak or not to be heard. Look at the COVID-19 pandemic. Whenever they made a decision, they asked the Minister of Health because health is important. Even for sanc-\ntions, the words of those who know the bad outcomes for people\u2019s health cannot be heard.

Social networks offer useful avenues for the increased mobilization and transfer of knowledge and dissemination of innovations, thereby boosting the overall resilience of systems. Collaboration among organizations in a networked environment can also expand potential resources, the ability to learn, and the capacity to respond.\n\u201cIf you remember the war, these jihadi groups and popular networks played an important role in helping soldiers and supporting the country in many places. Since they had a social base, they could coordinate resources well. The health system should also consider how it can create and improve these networks and communities in the community groups.

Sometimes, the data required to perceive the impacts of sanctions does not exist. Another issue is the lack of scientific methodology to analyze the effects of sanctions on health. These all result in the wake of proactively monitoring what is happening in the health system. Equity was highlighted as an aspect that is often lost during sanctions. One participant stated that new strategies made hastily in need of a quick fix would often miss equity aspects. Hence, it is highly important to establish a monitoring and evaluation system in which different aspects of equity are routinely observed.\n\u201cThe point was that we never came to see these indicators, how our access is to medicine, equipment, and procedures during the embargo, and the effect of the embargo on the public health was not there to see what their conditions would be. This makes us not have a complete judgment on this whole issue.\u201d P7. \u201cIndicators of malnutrition in children, thinness, short stature, and even overweightness and obesity in children and adults were among of the important indicators that could be affected by sanctions. I did not see very documented statistics. One of the claims made by the Ministry of Health was that we kept it constant, and these indicators had not changed.\u201d P8."

Moreover, many participants highlighted the need for adequate information and epidemiological surveillance systems that monitor and report the status of the system and provide real-time early warning of impending health threats.\n\u201cWhen they create a surveillance system and want to control an epidemic, first of all, you have to see if the prevalence is high or if the economic burden is high, that is. I mean we have criteria for saying which should be the surveillance system. Now in Iran, many information systems are excessive. To be more resilient, we need a surveillance system as needed.

These obstacles must be solved to make the health system resilient.

However, most sanctions and shocks were difficult to predict and prevent.\n\u201cThe most serious damage caused by sanctions is for drugs and medical supplies mainly used for treatment. The conditions of the patients have worsened with every sanction. It is very simple, for the health\nsystem not to be harmed by this issue, for it should focus on prevention. As you said, prevention had priority over treatment at the beginning of the revolution.\u201d P6.\nDefining tailored health services package for\u00a0vulnerable populations Some participants stated that during sanctions, not only is it important to provide routine health services for the entire population, but it is also essential to ensure additional health services for vulnerable groups including women, children, low socioeconomic population, and refugees. However, maintaining everyday services should be put high on the agenda by a resilient health system. They assumed that defining and developing tailored health service packages might help ensure safe and premium care with minimum financial hardships.\n\u201cExperience has always shown that those with incurable diseases and those whose voices are less heard are more harmed during crises. For instance, if patients know some people in high places, their voices will be heard; otherwise, nobody listens to them.

Additional file\u00a0 1: Appendix\u00a0 3 presents further details regarding the expert panel used in this study. In the first Delphi round, 28 mitigating measures were found once the suggestions and comments of experts were assessed. In the second Delphi round, all these measures were prioritized with regard to their effectiveness and feasibility. Table\u00a0 4 presents the measures and their relationships with the functions of the health system.Fig.\u00a03 A\u2013B reports the ranking results, and Table\u00a0 5 demonstrates the classification of resultant interventions based on the average scores of feasibility and effectiveness criteria in accordance with the time horizon of effects. For the sake of simplicity, any scores above the overall average score were considered effective or feasible, and the scores below average were considered ineffective or non-feasible.\nComparing these two timeframes resulted in valuable findings, among which it is noteworthy to pay attention to three groups of mitigating measures.\nGroup 1: Effective and feasible measures in both short-term and long-term periods. Most of these measures focus on good governance and strengthening and improving supervision. Group 2: Measures that are more effective in the short run than the long run. Group 3: Measures that are more effective and feasible in the long run than the short run (e.g., funding for health through sustained sources, investing in domestic production, and strengthening global health diplomacy).\nApart from these measures, we identified some other measures that should be considered in the international community and agencies under sanctions (e.g., strengthening global health diplomacy, assigning some international intermediate organizations and specific companies and financial institutions to facilitate the implementation of exemptions, excluding vital medicine and medical supplies from sanctioned items, allocating a protected specific banking channel for humanitarian medicines trade, establishing specific cut-off thresholds for unintended consequences on civilians, establishing\nan international order for the protection of people before the imposition of sanctions, and monitoring and evaluation the effects of sanctions)."

These measures can benefit countries under sanctions. However, also agencies such as the UN overlook human rights to reduce the health burden of sanctions.\nThe review findings indicated the insufficient evidence on measures improving the health system to cope with the effects of sanctions and to harness the outcomes. They are mostly derived from the synthesis of studies on available reports and statistics, and there was no robust evidence on their effectiveness and implementation considerations. Therefore, it is not easy to judge the effectiveness and feasibility of these measures. Further investigations are required to extend the existing knowledge about the effectiveness of these measures and to find context-based implementation considerations.\nResearch findings also revealed a range of measures proposed or implemented to make a health system resilient to sanctions. These measures focus on strengthening governance arrangements, better information and evidence, sustained financing, qualified health workforce,\nTable 4 (continued)\nCode Mitigating measures Health System Function towards resilience Source of data Delphi\n28 Optimizing the use of human resources (by improving competencies and making appropriate use of job descriptions, e.g., avoiding specialization in basic services)\nQualified workforces Interview and gray literature Accepted\n29 Preparedness and planning for sanction Good governance Interview and gray literature Rejected\n30 Strong leadership and management Good governance Review & Interview and gray literature Rejected\n31 Optimizing the domestic market Sustained financing Review Rejected\n32 Strengthening the insurance system Sustained financing Review Rejected\n33 Strengthening of inter-sectoral cooperation Good governance Review Rejected\n34 Paying more attention to mass media Good governance Review Rejected\n35 Management and development of health tourism Good governance Review Rejected\n36 Electronic health record Integrated and updated health information system\nReview Rejected\n37 Electronic prescription Integrated and updated health information system\nReview Rejected\n38 Proper implementation of the referral system Efficient and equitable service delivery\nReview Rejected\n39 Medication tracking Efficient and equitable service delivery\nReview Rejected\n40 Consumer\u2013patient collaboration Efficient and equitable service delivery\nReview Rejected\nand efficient and equitable service delivery. Most of these measures are similar to those recommended for health system rebuilding or preparedness. For instance, Palagyi et\u00a0al. explored and introduced the key elements of health systems in low- and middle- income countries during the outbreak as (i) surveillance, (ii) infrastructure and medical supplies, (iii) workforce, (iv) communication mechanisms, (v) governance, and (vi) trust [31]. Hanefeld et\u00a0al. also reported that three health systems functions would help the health system to adapt and respond to shocks: (i) health information systems (having the information and the knowledge to decide on what needs to be done), (ii) funding/financing mechanisms (investing or mobilizing resources to fund a response), and (iii) health workforce (who should plan and implement the system) [32]. A recent brief policy published by Thomas et\u00a0 al. [33] reported the same findings to introduce strategies for enhancing the resilience of health systems. Therefore, different shocks experienced by the health systems brought the idea that health systems needed to be not only stronger but also more resilient [32]. We need to reinforce the interconnectedness of the traditional health system building blocks to respond better.\nThe findings, both at the review and qualitative phases, indicated that most measures to make a resilient health system in sanctions were related to strengthening governance. It highlights the critical role of the system software (i.e., governance arrangements) in enabling health systems to cope with the critical situation. It is similar to the ones reported by previous studies. Douedari and Howard considered health system governance elements (i.e., strategic vision, participation, transparency, responsiveness, equity, effectiveness, accountability, and information) to play central roles in rebuilding the Syrian health system in conflicts [34]. Hanefeld et\u00a0 al. also introduced governance as a fundamental function affecting all other system dimensions and predominant values shaping the response and how it would be experienced at individual and community levels [32]. We believe that governance is not a standalone function. In fact, it is the\nmortar that binds all other functions together. Thus, it is not easy to make the health system more resilient. It is also not an apolitical technical exercise. In other words, it is a rather intensely complex task that needs complex interventions.\nAs mentioned earlier, there was scant evidence regarding the effectiveness of measures. Therefore, we obtained the opinions of experts on the effectiveness and feasibility of measures identified in studies and the qualitative phase. Considering the similarities of effectiveness and feasibility of measures in the short run and the long run, we found that more effective and applicable measures in the short run and the long run were those the ones that increased the efficiency of health resources and the correct use of resources, leading to making a resilient health system against sanctions. Several studies have concluded that the main issue in all health systems is inefficiency and the waste of health resources [35, 36]. Thus, it is essential to ensure efficiency improvement to make a resilient health system cope with catastrophic events. In addition, the other effective and feasible measures to cope with a tough situation included the measures related to defining well-defined policies and ensuring the continuity of services to vulnerable people such as children and the poor, and monitoring the impact of sanctions on their condition in targeted countries. Regarding the emphasis on equity and the prism of leaving no one behind in health [37, 38], taking these measures to improve equity is a critical step in making the health system more sustained and responsible.\nEvidently, although shortcut ways to deal with the sanction that rely on the capacity of international organizations or sideways to bypass the sanction might be suitable in the short run, they fail contribute sufficiently to the long-term resilience of a health system. While taking these measures are inevitable in the short term, it is essential to plan for more effective measures. Regarding the research findings, measures to increase national capacities are a part of effective measures in the long run. It has also been recommended to rely on national capacities since the PHC declaration [39]. One of the four PHC principles is the use of appropriative technology. It refers to any technology that makes the most economical use of a country\u2019s natural resources and its relative proportion of capital, labor, and skills and contributes to national and social goals. Thus, it is recommended to invest in boosting national capacities and reducing the health system\u2019s needs abroad.\nAdditionally, measures to empower the community and increase participation are more effective in the long run. Investment in social participation starts with building government capacities to create, manage, and sustain participation mechanisms. More public participation"

Countries might have valuable experiences but are less reported as peer-reviewed publications. According to the results of this study, the most critical area for the resilience of a health system in confronting sanctions is to strengthen particular components of governance. The experts collectively believed that improving efficiency and caring for vulnerable populations were more effective and feasible. They mentioned that while prompt measures were required to cope with catastrophic circumstances, effective measures were more vital in the long run. These measures include investing in national capacities rather than waiting for foreign aid, empowering people, and strengthening health diplomacy. Despite the novelty of the proposed measures, it is unclear how effective they are and, in principle, whether they can significantly affect the harsh effects of sanctions on health. Moreover, intensive and long-term sanctions leave significant irreversible outcomes, which cannot be removed easily or in the short run.\nAbbreviations SWIFT: Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications; UN: United Nations; WHO: World Health Organization.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12992- 022- 00901-w.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Appendix\u00a01.
