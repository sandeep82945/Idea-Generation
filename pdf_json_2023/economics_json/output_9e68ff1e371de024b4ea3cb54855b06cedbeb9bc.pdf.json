An evolutionary game analysis and simulation research on the formalization of the domestic service industry with subsidy policy\nMeina Ren1\u2020, Xiaozhu Chang1\u2020, Shasha Du2 and Linping Liu1*\n1School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 2Department of Social and Cultural Studies, Party School of C.P.C. Jiangsu Committee, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China\nSince China entered the aging society, the surging demand for elderly care and the industrial upgrading of \u201csilver economy\u201d has forced the domestic service industry to face endogenous challenges. Among them, the formalization of the domestic service industry can e ectively reduce the transaction costs and risks of actors, innovate the endogenous vitality of the industry, and promote the improvement of elderly care quality through a triangular employment relationship. By constructing a tripartite asymmetric evolutionary game model of clients, domestic enterprises and governmental departments, this study uses the stability theorem of di erential equations to explore the influencing factors and action paths of the system\u2019s evolutionary stable strategies (ESS), and uses the research data collected from China to assign values to models for simulation analysis. This study finds that the ratio of the initial ideal strategy, the di erence between profits and costs, subsidies to clients, and subsidies or punishments for breach of contract to domestic enterprises are the key factors a ecting the formalization of the domestic service industry. Subsidy policy programs can be divided into long-term and periodic programs, and there are di erences in the influence paths and e ects of the key factors in di erent situations. Increasing domestic enterprises\u2019 market share with employee management systems, formulating subsidy programs for clients, and setting up evaluation and supervision mechanisms are e cient ways through which to promote the formalization of the domestic service industry in China. Subsidy policy of governmental departments should focus on improving the professional skills and quality of elderly care domesticworkers, and also encourage domestic enterprises with employee management systems at the same time, to expand the scope of service beneficiaries by running nutrition restaurants in communities, cooperating with elderly care institutions, etc.\nKEYWORDS\nelderly care demands, formalization of domestic service industry, subsidy policy, evolutionary game model, numerical simulation\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "In the background of surging aging, establishing formalized domestic service markets is considered more cost-effective, with rising population dependency ratios and increasing female employment rates (1). As a result, it has emerged as the primary coping mechanism used by nations to address rising social and economic expenses of care, as well as rising demand for elderly care (2\u20134). Home-based, community-based, and institutional elderly care are three major parts of China\u2019s elderly care system. Among them, home-based elderly care accounts for\u223c90% (5). The absolute dominant position of it is a typical feature of Chinese elderly care.\nOn the one hand, the \u201cfilial piety\u201d in traditional Chinese Confucian culture is the spiritual core of Chinese elderly care. Confucian culture believes that \u201cthe body, hair and skin, all have\nbeen received from the parents\u201d (shen ti fa fu, shou zhi fu mu), and correspondingly, parents need to be taken care personally by their children with full attention. Only in this way, can they be said to have lived a wonderful life in their senior years according to Confucianism. The care of children has become a critical criterion for measuring their degree of filial piety. Therefore, the elders without kinship care are defined as being in a pitiable state. Even based on several sayings in a current Confucianism practice,\nthey will be losers in their own lives without support for future generations. Undoubtedly, with the continuous advancement of\nmodernization, the fast-paced work and life have made the children\nlose the realistic conditions for personal care. The emergence of paid domestic services has just become a compensatory strategy for personal care. And it has gradually become the mainstream of Chinese elderly care, which would balance the dilemma of the practice of \u201cfilial piety\u201d in modern social structure.\nOn the other hand, intergenerational property relations solidify Chinese elderly care. Owning real estate is a key factor inmeasuring the interpersonal status of modern Chinese. At the same time, renting means a lack of economic capabilities and social status, and even being called \u201chomelessness\u201d by surrounding people. Therefore, real estates are common gifts given by Chinese parents to their children, so that it would form a bond based on economic relationship of real estates full of legal and moral meaning between them. As we can see, it is difficult to change this absolute highproportion home-based elderly care model in a short period. Among them, paid domestic services are the main form of marketoriented home-based elderly care, and also an important way to support the current situation of Chinese elderly care. The trend of the standardized development of the domestic service industry is called the formalization of the domestic service industry. It can effectively reduce the transaction costs and risks of actors through a triangular employment relationship. Elderly care services are an important part of domestic services. Under a huge shortage of workers accompanied by a low level of service, the formalization of the domestic service industry would help improve the quality of elderly care. Furthermore, it would also promote the positive work experience for elderly care workers, and significantly rescue the urgent dilemma of Chinese elderly care.\nThe formalization of the domestic service industry could be seen as the premise for the improvement of elderly care\nservices marketization. At present, there are many problems in\nthe domestic service market in China, such as a high market share of domestic enterprises with employee management systems (6), lack of professional quality, lack of professionalism and low education levels of domestic workers (7\u20139), and lack of labor\nrights protection for domestic workers (10). Domestic workers\u2019 professional quality is low, in our case, their work experience\nis poor, and the inferior competition is severe; clients lack consumer rights protection, limiting their consumption options;\nand domestic enterprises\u2019 functions are single and lack supervision. The problems above lead to a disorder of internal development of the domestic service industry resulting in the blockage of\nmechanism practice, which directly affects the market\u2019s ability\nto meet the elderly care needs. It is imperative to seek an\neffective way to promote the formalization of the domestic service industry.\nPolicy plays an instructive role in the development of industries\nfrequently. In recent years, Chinese governmental departments\nhave implemented subsidy policy for domestic enterprises with employee management systems and domestic workers. It has\nbecome an important method to promote the formalization of the domestic service industry. As such, the Opinions of the\nGeneral Office of the State Council on Promoting the Quality and Expanding the Capacity of Domestic Service Industry (No. 30 [2019] of the General Office of the State Council) (referred\nto as \u201c36 Articles of Domestic Service\u201d) provide subsidy methods\nand objectives. This document defines domestic enterprises with employee management systems, as those \u201centerprises that directly sign service contracts with clients, sign labor contracts or service agreements with domestic workers in accordance with the law and pay social insurance premiums. Meanwhile, enterprises arrange domestic workers to provide services to clients, pay labor wages\nnot lower than local minimum wage to domestic workers directly or on behalf of clients, and conduct continuous trainings and\nmanagement for domestic workers.\u201d\nThe facts that domestic enterprises tend to have employee management systems, and clients tend to purchase domestic services through domestic enterprises, are reflections of the development of the domestic service industry toward a healthy situation. Domestic enterprises with employee management systems can adjust the effectiveness of different strategies for domestic workers and clients, through reward and punishment settings, to achieve the formalization of the industry (11).\nCan subsidy policy truly promote the formalization of the domestic service industry? How can subsidies be implemented more efficiently? Because the formalization of the domestic service industry is closely related to the strategies of governmental departments, domestic enterprises, and clients, the process of formalization can be regarded as a dynamic result of game strategies with constant adjustment by various actors. Therefore, evolutionary game theory provides an efficient analytical perspective from another research logic to evaluate the current relevant policies and, moreover, beyond the previous analysis logic based only on variable interpretation.\nThe main issues of this paper are as follows:\n(1) In the case of government subsidies and supervision, what are\nthe key factors affecting the healthy and orderly development\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nof the domestic service industry? How do these factors affect the evolutionary path of the system? (2) Subsidies as the long-term or periodic methods of\ngovernmental departments, will they affect the healthy operation of the domestic service industry? If so, what are the variables that governmental departments should prioritize in different situations? (3) Is the current subsidy policy efficient? Does it promote the\nlabor quality and occupational health of domestic workers? Does it really improve the quality of elderly care?"

            "text": "The triangular employment relationship established by the transaction actors in the domestic service market is the foothold of the formalization of domestic work, which is an important prerequisite for the realization of the formalization of the industry. This triangular employment relationship refers to the tripartite relationship established among service provider organizations, domestic workers and clients (12).\nThe triangular employment relationship facilitates more structured employment arrangements and establishes more formal working relationships while also promoting the formalization of the domestic service industry in four ways. First, domestic enterprises sign contracts with clients to control the workload of their domestic workers and avoid additional unpaid work (13, 14). Moreover, the constraints of domestic enterprises placed on clients can effectively improve the bargaining ability of domestic workers (15). However, the effectiveness of such contracts is a matter of concern because heterogeneity exists among domestic enterprises (16). Second, the labor wages of domestic workers are paid by domestic enterprises, which is beneficial for them to avoid the occurrence of unauthorized deductions from domestic workers\u2019 paychecks by clients (17, 18). Third, domestic workers employed by domestic enterprises are more likely to resist abuse and harassment by clients because they receive support from colleagues, ask for help from domestic enterprises, continue working by changing clients, etc., (19\u201321). Fourth, domestic enterprises provide trainings and other services to build domestic workers\u2019 confidence in the labor market. Usually, domestic workers also expect to earn higher wages after completing the trainings from domestic enterprises (22, 23). For example, Cai et al. (24) used data from China and found that trainings increased the monthly wages of domestic workers by 11.9%.\nPrevious studies have paid attention to the role of domestic enterprises in promoting the formalization of the domestic service industry, such as by signing contracts and providing vocational trainings. However, researchers are usuallymore inclined to explore the impact of domestic enterprises on domestic workers at the micro level, to ignore the impact of those services provided by domestic enterprises on clients, and to seldom discuss the impact of relevant policies on the choices of those functions undertaken by domestic enterprises. In fact, the formalization of\nthe domestic service industry involves multiple actors, including relevant governmental departments, domestic enterprises and clients, all of whom interact with each other."

            "text": "Government policies in the field of domestic services can be divided into three categories: first, employment and immigration policies directly targeting domestic workers, which are usually implemented through domestic enterprises and/or domestic workers; second, policies that indirectly affect domestic workers by reducing taxes for clients and/or issuing service vouchers; and third, no policy (25). For example, the policy orientation of Denmark, Sweden, and Finland is tax relief, while that of Belgium and Austria is to issue service vouchers. Moreover, France and Germany have both of the above-mentioned policy orientations, while the United States is a typical example of having no policy. The main purpose of such policies is to increase the number of legally protected domestic workers by changing the way domestic services are purchased, thereby creating employment opportunities for private enterprises and reducing informal employment (3, 25).\nThe evaluation of the effect of policy implementation considers mainly the impact on the labor market, organizational transformation and households. For example, Windebank (26) found that the positive impact of French policies on households and domestic workers was negligible, while Bailly et al. (27) argued that the policies implemented in France to achieve the goal of job creation emphasize the number of jobs at the expense of quality of care services, and the increase in the proportion of direct employment reduces the positive effect of the policy. Moreover, Jokela (28) conducted a quantitative comparative study on the relationship between paid domestic work and precarious employment in Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and the United States at the micro level, finding that although policies were different, compared with other industries, the domestic service industry wasmore unstable. In addition, in the United States, which has no relevant policies, and other countries with subsidy policy, there is weak supervision of the domestic service market.\nSince subsidy policy is often demand-driven, its goal is to make it easier for households to hire domestic workers, and the policy beneficiaries are often first those households that are able to pay for services. While reducing the burden of housework for dualearner households, such policy also exacerbates gender inequality in housework, shifting housework from wealthier women to less wealthy women (3, 21, 26). Based on the empirical research of Belgium, France, Switzerland and Brazil, Tomei (29) found that working conditions for domestic workers improved slightly after governments offered an incentive to increase the number of licensed domestic enterprises, but the quality of domestic services remained uneven. Jokela (25) argued that relevant policies reflected the underestimation of paid domestic work in the regulation of visa restrictions and residency requirements and that practices such as limiting hours of service and failing to distinguish between different types of domestic work exacerbated the disadvantage of domestic workers\u2019 employment insecurity. Additionally, studies by\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\nvan Walsum (30), Morel (31), and Jokela (28) drew conclusions similar to those of Jokela. Shutes and Walsh (32) argued that market-oriented policies may deepen the negative effects of identity differences such as race and citizenship differences. Furthermore, Tomei (29) argued that a more standardized employment relationship weakened the bargaining power of self-employed domestic workers with their employers, making domestic workers more competitive.\nGovernmental departments, domestic enterprises and clients are the main actors in promoting the formalization of the domestic service industry, but the relevant literature studies mainly the role of subsidy policy in a certain aspect of the domestic service industry through quantitative research or policy analysis. There is a lack of perspectives that can integrate different actors and of mathematical models to study the stability of triangular strategy combinations."

            "text": "Evolutionary game theory combines game theory and Darwinian biological evolution theory to compensate for the lack of time evolution inherent in previous game theory. The core of evolutionary game theory is an evolutionary stable strategy (33). The research on actors\u2019 action strategies and operation mechanisms under subsidy policy or supervision by applying evolutionary game models focused on the fields of technological innovation and drug production. By constructing evolutionary game models, it can be seen that the government\u2019s innovation input and product subsidies have different impact mechanisms in terms of their effect on cost-advantage and cost-disadvantage enterprises in terms of choosing different innovation models (34). Because subsidies can reduce costs incurred by enterprises, policy subsidies are usually beneficial for the development of industries (35, 36). However, subsidy policy is usually only a short-term regulatory measure, so subsidy withdrawal mechanisms still need to be formulated by the relevant departments (37, 38). In addition, the government\u2019s supervision of various transaction actors in the market has positive significance in terms of promoting buyers and sellers in fulfilling contracts (39\u201341).\nEvolutionary game models are suitable for studies of actors\u2019 action strategies and operation mechanisms under subsidy policy or supervision. The implementation of subsidy policy and government supervision has positive significance in emerging industries as well as those industries that are in urgent need of formalization. Subsidy structures, subsidy intensity, punishment mechanisms, and reward and punishment settings are important variables that affect the evolutionary stability of the system, and subsidy programs planned for the long term or periodically may also affect the realization paths of policy objectives.\nPrevious studies have considered evolutionary game theory because the theoretical perspective lacks attention to the domestic service industry; actually, the process of the formalization of the domestic service industry can also be regarded as a dynamic result of the constant adjustment of game strategies by various actors. Therefore, this study constructs a tripartite asymmetric\nevolutionary game model of governmental departments, domestic enterprises and clients; incorporates government subsidies and supervision as variables in the model; and uses the stability theorem of differential equations to explore the systematic evolutionary stability strategy, influencing factors and mechanisms of the formalization of the domestic service industry."

The survey obtained 1,007 valid questionnaires through respondent-driven sampling, and was verified by the RDS estimator and other testing methods to obtain an approximate random sample, that is, this data can be regarded as a representative sample. Second, 51 documents, including those on domestic service subsidies, were collected from the official websites of the relevant departments of provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) and municipal governments in Mainland China (covering 15 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities). The direct subsidy targets of policies are mainly domestic enterprises with employee management systems and their domestic workers. Usually, domestic workers\u2019 subsidies must be implemented by domestic enterprises with employee management systems."

Domestic enterprises with employee management systems generally only provide order-taking and dispatching services. In addition to providing incentives through subsidy policy, governmental departments also need to set up regulatory mechanisms to restrict the behavior of actors, such as punishments for cheating in subsidies. The main goals of governmental departments are to gain a positive reputation and to improve the well-being of society; the latter includes protections for the job market, consumer rights and workers. In addition, governmental departments can also choose loose management approaches, for example, only providing market behavior regulations.

(20)\nIn an asymmetric multigroup evolutionary game, the stability of its equilibrium point is a strict Nash equilibrium (43), which is a pure strategy equilibrium. Therefore, in Equation (19), there are only 8 equilibrium points (E1 to E8) in the dedomain R =\n{(x, y, z)|0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1}. Only E1 to E8 are studied in this paper. The local stability analysis of the Jacobian matrix of the replicator dynamic system can obtain the stability of the equilibrium point of the evolutionary system (44). According to Equation (19), the Jacobian matrix (J) of the system is as follows:\nJ =\n\n  J1 J2 J3 J4 J5 J6 J7 J8 J9\n\n  =\n\n  \n\u2202F(x) \u2202x \u2202F(x) \u2202y \u2202F(x) \u2202z \u2202F(y) \u2202x \u2202F(y) \u2202y \u2202F(y) \u2202z \u2202F(z) \u2202x \u2202F(z) \u2202y \u2202F(z) \u2202z\n\n  \n(21)\nThe eigenvalues of each equilibrium point can be obtained from the Jacobian matrix of the system. According to Lyapunov\u2019s indirect method (45), if the eigenvalues are positive or negative, then the equilibrium point is a saddle point; if the eigenvalues are all positive, then the equilibrium point is an unstable point; and if the eigenvalues are all negative, then the equilibrium point is an asymptotic stable point. This strategic combination is an evolutionary stable strategy. Accordingly, stability analysis can be carried out for each equilibrium point. Due to space limitations, the case in which \u03bb is a positive number is not shown in Table 3.\nE6 and E8 are the ideal combination of strategies for the regularization of the domestic service industry, and only these two situations are analyzed below. Inference VII: When governmental departments choose \u201cloose supervision,\u201d (1, 1, 0) is the combination of evolutionary stable strategy.

Even when subsidy intensity is low, clients still tend to choose to purchase services from domestic enterprises with employee management systems, and domestic enterprises are more inclined to implement \u201cemployee management systems\u201d.

At this time, domestic enterprises choose to implement \u201cemployee management systems\u201d due to the increase in profits, and clients tend to choose to purchase services from domestic enterprises due to the increase in profits. Therefore, this situation is also the ideal situation for the formalization of the domestic service industry.\nThe validity tests of the system evolution stability of E6 and E8 are shown in Figure 5, the results of which show that they can both converge to the stable situation. In the next section, we explore these two situations through systematic simulation analysis."

Combining Inferences V and VI, it can be seen that the increase in the total cost of \u201cstrict supervision\u201d by governmental departments reduces the probability of governmental departments adopting this strategy, thereby\nreducing the probability of employers purchasing services through domestic enterprises. Therefore, when governmental departments implement \u201cstrict supervision\u201d as a long-term strategy, subsidies for domestic enterprises should be properly controlled. When the implementation of \u201cstrict supervision\u201d is a periodic strategy for governmental departments, subsidies for domestic enterprises should be increased as appropriate to promote the formalization of\nthe domestic service industry.\nUnder the condition that other parameters remain unchanged,\nassigning \u03d5 as 1, 1.5, and 2, the 100 simulation results of replicator\ndynamic equations in Systems L and P in time t are shown in Figure 10.\nFigure 10 shows that the increase in subsidy intensity for clients in the two systems has a positive impact on the process of system evolution.

In addition, Figures 9, 10 show that there are different degrees of marginal diminishing effects on the increase in the amount of subsidies for domestic enterprises and clients."

The formalization of the domestic service industry is beneficial to improve the quality of elderly care, further promote the positive work experience of domestic workers engaged in home-based elderly care, provide marketoriented and standardized industrial support to the elderly care model with a high proportion of home-based elderly care, and establish a compensatory social network to support this elderly care model, which rescue the urgent dilemma of Chinese elderly care significantly."

            "text": "The main conclusions of this study are presented below. First, the initial ideal strategy ratios and differences between the profits and costs of each actor, subsidies to clients, and subsidies and punishments for the irregular behavior of domestic enterprises are the key factors that cause the system to converge to a gradual stable point, reflecting the formalization of the domestic service industry. The lower the initial proportion of the ideal strategy of clients and/or domestic enterprises is, the higher the probability that governmental departments choose to implement strict supervision.\nIn addition, the punishment of irregular behavior for domestic enterprises with employee management systems by governmental departments should be less than the setting of its subsidies, which is more conducive to the realization of the formalization of the domestic service industry.\nSecond, policy planning can be divided into long-term or periodic planning, and the effect of certain key factors on the evolution of the system is different in different situations. Thus, the priorities of policies under different programs should be different. When governmental departments regard the implementation of subsidies and supervision as a long-term strategic plan, they should appropriately control subsidies to domestic enterprises. The rising costs of governmental departments reduce the probability of their choice to implement strict supervision, thereby reducing the probability of clients purchasing services through domestic enterprises and delaying the realization of the formalization of the domestic service industry. When governmental departments formulate exit mechanisms with subsidies and supervision, it is more efficient to promote the formalization of the domestic service industry by focusing on increasing the proportion of domestic enterprises with employee management systems to a certain market share and gradually reducing the proportion of those implementing strict supervision.\nThird, the current subsidy policy only focuses on domestic enterprises, which is, to some extent, inefficient in promoting the formalization of the domestic service industry, because the initial proportional change in clients\u2019 ideal strategy has the greatest impact on the convergence to an asymptotic stable point."

            "text": "Based on research conclusions and social reality, this study puts\nforward the policy recommendations presented below.\nFirst, the subsidy structure should be continuously optimized. Initially, the subsidy targets at this moment are mainly domestic enterprises and domestic workers, and the emphasis on clients\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 15 frontiersin.org\nshould be increased. For example, governmental departments can issue consumer vouchers to households with home-based elderly care needs to reduce the purchase costs, and attract clients to purchase domestic services through domestic enterprises with employee management systems, which it could, formulate more targeted subsidy plans consequently. Compared with other kinds of domestic workers, elderly care workers generally have larger age structures and lower educational levels, and the advantages of domestic enterprises with employee management systems in providing social security and skills training may be difficult to realize. In this regard, it is possible to attract elderly care workers to choose to be employed through domestic enterprises with employee management systems by purchasing domestic accidental insurance for them. Specifically, governmental departments could expand the scope of services for the elderly by encouraging domestic enterprises with employee management systems to open community restaurants and cooperate with elderly care institutions.\nSecond, relevant governmental departments at all levels should adapt to local and time-sensitive conditions in the process of policy refinement and implementation. For example, domestic enterprises with employee management systems have a management model with high costs and profits. In regions with a low degree of the formalization of the domestic service market, domestic enterprises whose main business is elderly care services can be subsidized preferentially to encourage the development of a few typical enterprises, and there is no need to be vigorously promoted in the short term. As in small cities, with typical acquaintance society characteristics, households in need of elderly care services and elderly care workers are both more inclined to be introduced by familiar people to establish market relationship. In such cases, it is more difficult to popularize domestic enterprises with employee management systems. In some developed regions, policies can be more focused on exploring how to subsidize households in the need of elderly care services, accordingly with establishing policy supervision as well as evaluation mechanisms, with a principle cause that the larger the urban population, the faster the population mobility, and the stronger the population heterogeneity. In such a situation, it is easier to implement employee management systems which need higher professional standards.\nThird, governmental departments should pay a great deal of attention to measures that can improve the quality of elderly care services. On the one hand, it is possible to develop domestic training materials and courses that are suitable for the current situation of home-based elderly care in Chinese society by cooperating with excellent domestic enterprises and universities to improve the professional skills and quality of elderly care workers. On the other hand, the elderly care service demand side can be included to establish long-term evaluation mechanisms to improve subsidy policy.\nFourth, executive branches cooperate with market organizations to implement evaluation and supervision programs. For example, it is possible for authorities in the field of domestic services to cooperate with relevant units, such as big data resource administrations, to establish domestic platforms that require realname authentication. The content of the platforms should include\nthe integrity management records of domestic enterprises, details of subsidy implementation, personal certification of domestic workers and clients, service evaluations, etc."

Social phenomena are complex, and some important factors are abstract and difficult to represent numerically. The processing of these factors affects the process of system evolution to stable points. Although this study makes assumptions based on theory and reference to the previous literature in the process of constructing evolutionary game models, it cannot be guaranteed to be sufficiently perfect. Second, since it takes a certain period of time from the setting of subsidy policy to their implementation, the current subsidy policy has been implemented for a relatively short period of time, and there is still a lack of data on the financial expenditures of relevant governmental departments for verification purposes."
