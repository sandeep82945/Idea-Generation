1. **Investigate the relationship between the mechanism design of DeFi protocols and their degrees of decentralization.** The paper finds that MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in transactions than Aave and Liquity. However, it does not explore why this is the case. Future research could investigate the relationship between the mechanism design of DeFi protocols and their degrees of decentralization. For example, it could examine how the governance structure, token distribution, and incentive mechanisms of a DeFi protocol affect its decentralization.


2. **Analyze the impact of network decentralization on the performance of DeFi protocols.** The paper finds that a more decentralized network can significantly predict higher returns and lower volatility for the associated DeFi tokens. However, it does not explore the mechanisms through which network decentralization affects performance. Future research could investigate the impact of network decentralization on the performance of DeFi protocols. For example, it could examine how network decentralization affects liquidity, trading volume, and price volatility.


3. **Develop new metrics for measuring the decentralization of DeFi protocols.** The paper uses six network features to measure the decentralization of DeFi protocols. However, these features may not capture all aspects of decentralization. Future research could develop new metrics for measuring the decentralization of DeFi protocols. For example, it could develop metrics that measure the distribution of power among network participants, the resilience of the network to attacks, and the transparency of the network.


4. **Study the evolution of network decentralization over time.** The paper finds that the degree of decentralization of DeFi protocols can change over time. However, it does not explore the factors that drive these changes. Future research could study the evolution of network decentralization over time. For example, it could examine how changes in the governance structure, token distribution, and incentive mechanisms of a DeFi protocol affect its decentralization.


5. **Explore the implications of network decentralization for the regulation of DeFi protocols.** The paper finds that network decentralization can have a significant impact on the performance of DeFi protocols. This raises important questions about the regulation of DeFi protocols. Future research could explore the implications of network decentralization for the regulation of DeFi protocols. For example, it could examine how regulators can promote network decentralization and mitigate the risks associated with centralized DeFi protocols.
