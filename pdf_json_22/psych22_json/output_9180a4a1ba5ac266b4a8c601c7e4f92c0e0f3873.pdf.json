    "abstractText": "Previous literature concerning power stereotypes demonstrates that compared to low-power (LP) individuals, high-power (HP) individuals tend to be perceived as having positive competence but negative warmth. Based on previous research, the current research further classified HP into senior and junior HP and mainly compared the perceived warmth between senior and junior HP individuals in Chinese culture. By classifying power into HP and LP, the pilot study employed the trait-rating task to replicate the results of previous research. In Study 1, we classified HP into senior and junior HP and revealed that participants indicated more positive warmth evaluations for senior HP individuals than for junior HP individuals. We named this \u201cmore power, more warmth\u201d effect the MPMW effect. Further investigation demonstrated that the MPMW effect was more likely to emerge for participants with high Confucianism identification (Study 2a), for Chinese participants rather than Western participants (Study 2b), or when the knowledge of Confucianism was accessible in a given situation (Study 3). The present research firstly demonstrated that the contents of power stereotypes may partially display culture-specific characteristics in Chinese culture. The continuous classification approach to power provided a novel insight for future power research.",

Based on previous research, the current\nresearch further classified HP into senior and junior HP and mainly compared the\nperceived warmth between senior and junior HP individuals in Chinese culture. By\nclassifying power into HP and LP, the pilot study employed the trait-rating task to\nreplicate the results of previous research. In Study 1, we classified HP into senior and\njunior HP and revealed that participants indicated more positive warmth evaluations for\nsenior HP individuals than for junior HP individuals. We named this \u201cmore power, more\nwarmth\u201d effect the MPMW effect. Further investigation demonstrated that the MPMW\neffect was more likely to emerge for participants with high Confucianism identification\n(Study 2a), for Chinese participants rather than Western participants (Study 2b), or when\nthe knowledge of Confucianism was accessible in a given situation (Study 3). The present\nresearch firstly demonstrated that the contents of power stereotypes may partially\ndisplay culture-specific characteristics in Chinese culture. The continuous classification\napproach to power provided a novel insight for future power research.\nKeywords: power, stereotypes, Confucianism, stereotype content model, social cognition, impression formation\nINTRODUCTION\nIn China, there is a well-known proverb \u201cIt\u2019s easy to deal with Yama, but hard to do with devilkins\u201d. Under Chinese culture, the \u201cdevilkins\u201d generally refer to those junior HP individuals who are primarily responsible for directly managing ordinary people in a society or employees in a company, such as community directors, workshop managers, etc. The \u201cYama\u201d often refers to those senior HP individuals who are primarily responsible for managing junior HP individuals rather than ordinary people in a society or employees in a company, such as ministers, Board Chairman, etc. From the perspective of social psychology, the proverb reflects the consensus of Chinese people about power stereotypes. That is, if HP individuals are divided into senior HP individuals (e.g., Board Chairman) and junior HP individuals (e.g., Workshop Manager), compared to junior HP individuals, senior HP individuals will be considered to display more positive warmth traits in communication with others.\nIt should be pointed out, to our knowledge, that previous power literature commonly investigates the effect of power by simply classifying power into HP and LP (Anicich et al., 2020),\nso we are not sure whether the proverb mentioned in the beginning can receive the supports from empirical research. In other words, although previous power stereotype research in Chinese culture has consistently demonstrated that more power is generally associated with less perceived warmth when comparing HP with LP individuals (Zhang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), it is still unclear whether the elevation of power will be associated with more/less perceived warmth about senior and junior HP individuals. To fill this gap, we conducted four studies on Chinese culture to examine whether there was the \u201cmore power, more warmth (MPMW)\u201d effect\u2014more power was associated with more warmth perception about the stereotypes of HP individuals, and we also attempted to specify the condition for the emergence of the MPMW effect. It should be noted that the so-called \u201cmore power, more warmth\u201d effect in the research exclusively referred to the warmth perception comparison between senior and junior HP individuals, rather than the warmth perception comparison between HP (including senior and junior HP) and LP individuals."

            "text": "In order to make sense of our surrounding social world without being cognitively overwhelmed, we humans tend to process information about others based on their social categories (Fiske and Neuberg, 1990; Carlsson and Bj\u00f6rklund, 2010). We do this by employing stereotypes, which are considered to be some socially shared beliefs that the members of a social category commonly possess some typical traits or characteristics (Hilton and Hippel, 1996). To date, researchers have revealed various stereotypes, such as race, gender, and age stereotypes (Devine, 1989; Banaji and Hardin, 1996; Chasteen et al., 2002). An interesting phenomenon pertaining to stereotypes is that the stereotypes of a specific group often contain a mix of traits that widely differ in evaluative orientation (Fiske et al., 2002; Cuddy et al., 2008). For example, stereotypes about lawyers include some typically positive traits (e.g., smart, professional) and at the same time include some typically negative traits (e.g., pitiless, profitoriented). In order to describe this mixed content of stereotypes, Fiske et al. (2002) developed the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). According to the SCM, warmth, and competence are universal and fundamental dimensions in social judgments and warmth is the primary dimension (Fiske et al., 2007; Cuddy et al., 2008). The warmth dimension mainly answers the question regarding whether the other person is friendly or hostile in social interaction, and the competence dimension represents the person\u2019s capability to carry out the intention (Fiske et al., 2007). The four combinations of high vs. low warmth and competence elicit four unique patterns of behavioral and emotional responses (for a detailed review, see Cuddy et al., 2008). The SCM further postulates that people often hold ambivalent stereotypes toward out-groupmembers\u2014they tend to be evaluated as positive on one dimension and negative on the other dimension. For instance, old people are stereotyped as warm but incompetent and lawyers are\nperceived as highly competent but cold (Carlsson and Bj\u00f6rklund, 2010). Supporting the proposition of ambivalent stereotypes, past research in the power field suggests that HP individuals tend to be stereotyped as having positive competence but negative warmth. That is, they commonly receive positive evaluations on the competence dimension but negative evaluations on the warmth dimension. In contrast, LP individuals tend to be stereotyped as having negative competence but with positive warmth. That is, they commonly receive negative evaluations on the competence dimension but positive evaluations on the warmth dimension (Russell and Fiske, 2008; Fragale et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013, 2015).\nPower is a fundamental part of our social life and has profound effects on our psychological and behavioral processes (Fiske and D\u00e9pret, 1996; Magee and Galinsky, 2008). Generally, power is defined as an individual\u2019s relative capacity to modify others\u2019 states by providing/withholding resources or administering punishments (Keltner et al., 2003). In essence, power means asymmetric control or dependence\u2014LP individuals depend on HP individuals but HP individuals are independent of LP individuals (Lammers et al., 2012). Thus, HP individuals are less motivated to pay attention to LP individuals surrounding them, because they can achieve their goals without the assistance of LP individuals (Chen et al., 2009; Guinote et al., 2012). In contrast, LP individuals need to display socially desirable traits so that they can acquire necessary resources from HP individuals (Magee and Smith, 2013). As a result, in line with the propositions of the SCM, HP individuals are inclined to be perceived as positive competent but negative warmth, and LP individuals are inclined to be perceived as negative competent but positive warmth. For an instance, Zhang et al. (2015) utilized the implicit association test (IAT) to detect the contents of power stereotypes. With regard to the target dimension, they selected 16 power labels as target words: 8 HP labels and 8 LP labels. With regard to the warmth dimension, they selected 16 power-stereotyperelevant traits as attribute words: 8 HP stereotype-consistent traits (4 positive competence traits and 4 negative warmth traits) and 8 LP stereotype-consistent traits (4 negative competence traits and 4 positive warmth traits). Following the standard procedure of the classic IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998), participants needed to respond to the compatible combinations (HP\u2013positive competence/negative warmth, LP\u2013negative competence/positive warmth) in Parts 3 and 4, and respond to the incompatible combinations (HP\u2013negative competence/positive warmth, LP\u2013 positive competence/negative warmth) in Part 6 and 7. The results showed that participants generally needed longer reaction times to respond to the incompatible combinations than the compatible combinations, resulting in a significantly greater D value than 0. The results of the research suggested that participants tended to perceive HP individuals as positive competent but negative warmth and perceive LP individuals as negative competent but positive warmth."

Since then, Confucianism has been the dominant philosophy in China for nearly two thousand years and produces a far-reaching influence on the Chinese people (Fung, 1948/2018). Regarding how one person should exert his power, Confucianism on the hand asserts that power-holders should have a great social responsibility and devote their lives to serving the whole society (Chen and Chung, 1994; Hwang, 2012). For example, Confucianism declares that an excellent governor should love ordinary people as if they were his own children. In line with this declaration, empirical research also suggests that HP individuals under Confucian culture are expected to have great social responsibility and concern for the wellbeing of others (Low and Ang, 2012, 2013). In this sense, HP individuals are expected to display positive warmth in communication with others. However, on the other hand, Confucianism puts an emphasis on the stateliness, status, and even privilege of HP individuals in daily communications (Chen and Chung, 1994; Chen et al., 2013). For instance, Chen et al. (2013) found that under Confucian culture, when a leader put forward a project plan, those subordinates tended to express advocacy toward the plan rather than directly raised doubts or modifications, because the latter could be regarded as a challenge toward the authority of power. As a result, in daily communications with others, HP individuals may be perceived as negative warmth due to the emphasis on the hierarchical order. Taken together, we reasoned that Confucianism may lead to being the discrepancy in the impressions between the expected HP individuals in the public mind and the encountered HP individuals in real communications\u2014HP individuals tend to be associated with positive warmth in expectation but tend to be associated with negative warmth in real communications.\nAlthough the above proposition to date has received less empirical support, to some extent, it is consistent with the widely accepted individualism/collectivism classification hypothesis, which defines Chinese society as a vertical collectivist society (VC; Singelis et al., 1995; Triandis, 1995; Triandis and Gelfand, 1998; Triandis et al., 1998). Specifically, Torelli and Shavitt (2011) have pointed out that individuals in the VC society have relatively complex conceptualizations of power. On one hand, HP individuals in the VC society are considered to put an emphasis on personal success and status in the hierarchy, and subordinates\u2019 compliance to the will of authority, which may prompt them to display negative warmth in communication with others. Meanwhile, HP individuals in the VC society are expected to join others in the group to compete with out-groups, and even sacrifice personal benefits for the sake of in-group goals. In this sense, they seemingly are expected to be positive on the warmth dimension. To some extent, these seemingly contradictory characteristics displayed by HP individuals in the VC society are consistent with our proposition about the discrepancy between the expected HP individuals and the perceived HP individuals in real experiences. Moreover, beyond previous research adopting the traditional individualism/collectivism perspective, our Confucian perspective provided an alternatively deeper explanation for the seemingly contradictory characteristics of HP individuals in the VC society\u2014it may root in Confucianism.\nOne may question if the discrepancy exists between the expected HP individuals and the perceived HP individuals in real experiences, why previous research on Chinese culture consistently demonstrates that HP individuals are perceived to be positive competence but negative warmth (Zhang et al., 2013, 2015; Wang et al., 2017). It should be pointed out, that previous research in the power field commonly classifies power into HP and LP in a dualistic way, no research to date has divided HP into senior HP and junior HP (Anicich et al., 2020). However, for ordinary Chinese people, although junior HP individuals (e.g., local officials) and senior HP individuals (e.g., central officials) both belong to HP individuals, they actually may have different impressions about such two types of HP individuals. One important reason for our reasoning is that in daily life, most ordinary people interact with junior HP individuals rather than senior HP individuals. So, for most people, the accessibility of the knowledge of junior HP individuals should be higher than the accessibility of the knowledge of senior HP individuals. Accessibility generally refers to a state that is produced by prior processing of a stimulus and thus activates knowledge (F\u00f6rster and Liberman, 2007). In this case, when mentioning HP individuals by default, most people may form the impression about them based on their experiences of interacting with junior HP individuals, and then utilized the impressions of junior HP individuals to represent the whole HP individuals. So, our first hypothesis was:\nWhen power was divided into high power and low power, consistent with previous theoretical and empirical research, individuals in Chinese culture would perceive HP individuals as positive competence but negative warmth (Hypothesis 1).\nAccording to our thesis 1, when HP individuals have not been divided into senior and junior HP individuals, Chinese people may (unconsciously) rely on their experiences of interacting with junior HP individuals to form an impression about the whole HP individuals. As a result, HP individuals tend to be perceived as having negative warmth. However, upon explicitly making a distinction between senior and junior HP individuals, people still can form the impression about junior HP individuals based on their real experiences, whereas such experiences are less available to represent senior HP individuals. In this case, as a chronically accessible construct (for a detailed introduction to the accessibility theory, see Higgins, 2012), Confucian constructions about HP individuals thus can be easily retrieved and used in impression formation about junior HP individuals. Indeed, past stereotype literature has suggested that some task-relevant information with the ease of retrieval tends to be used in impression formation with a high priority (Gawronski and Bodenhausen, 2005; Weick and Guinote, 2008). Considering that Confucianism alleges that HP individuals should have great social responsibility and concern for others, our second hypothesis was:\nWhen explicitly classifying HP individuals into senior and junior"

Following this reasoning, we can further speculate that if individuals in a specific situation have less identification with Confucianism, they should be less likely to evaluate senior HP individuals as positive warmth. In other words, individuals\u2019 identification with Confucianism may moderate the MPMW effect\u2014in a specific situation, only when the majority of individuals keep identification with Confucianism, can our expected MPMW effect on HP individuals appear. As for the competence dimension, considering that the social responsibility emphasized by Confucianism mainly has an influence on the warmth perceptions of senior HP individuals, we expected that the competence perceptions toward senior HP individuals were insensitive to participants\u2019 Confucianism identification. So, our third hypothesis was:\nParticipants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was the premise of the MPMW effect: Only when most participants keep identification with Confucianism in a specific situation, would they give more positive warmth evaluations for senior HP individuals than for junior HP individuals (Hypothesis 3).\nIn addition to the above three issues, out of curiosity, we also wanted to know whether Chinese participants would give more positive warmth evaluations for senior HP individuals than for LP individuals. However, because of lacking relevant literature, we cannot make a clear assumption about the warmth comparison between senior HP individuals and LP individuals. Moreover, this is not our major concern in the current research. Given that, we would conduct an exploratory investigation about this issue."

To this end, we firstly conducted a pilot study in which we used the trait-rating task to preliminarily examine the contents of power stereotypes about HP and LP individuals. We anticipated that consistent with previous research (Russell and Fiske, 2008; Fragale et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013), HP individuals tended to be stereotyped as positive competence but negative warmth while LP individuals tended to be stereotyped as negative competence but positive warmth. Based on this, we then conducted Study 1 in which we again used the trait-rating task to examine the contents of power stereotypes about senior HP, junior HP, and LP individuals. In Study 1, we put ourmain focus on the comparison between senior and junior HP stereotypes, and we predicted that compared to junior HP individuals, senior HP individuals tend to be perceived as more positive on both competence and warmth dimensions. In the following Study 2a and 2b, by using the trait-rating task, we exclusively compared the stereotypes about\nsenior and junior HP individuals and also explored the role of Confucianism in the MPMW effect. In Study 2a, we developed the Confucianism identification scale to examine whether the MPMW effect only emerged for participants displaying high identification with Confucianism. In Study 2b, we conducted an online cross-cultural study (Chinese participants vs. Western participants) to examine whether the MPMW effect appeared among Chinese participants rather than Western participants. In Study 3, we presented the counter-Confucianism stimuli to temporarily reduce the accessibility of Confucianism and then compared the magnitude of the MPMW effect in the implicit association task (IAT) between the Counter-Confucianism and the control conditions (no presenting the counter-Confucianism stimuli). We predicted that, due to the temporary decline of the Confucianism accessibility under the Counter-Confucianism condition, the MPMW effect would be significantly attenuated under this condition."

In the trait-rating task, we selected \u201cleader\u201d and \u201cordinary people\u201d as two target groups, and for each target group, participants needed to indicate to what extent the given traits (including positive and negative traits on both competence and warmth dimensions) were suitable to describe that group. To confirm the fitness between the selected traits and the two presupposed dimensions (competence and warmth), in another independent sample (n = 46, 18 men, 18 women, Mage = 20.64, SD = 3.14), we asked participants to report whether and to what extent each pair of traits belong to the competence or the warmth dimension on an 11-point scale (ranging from \u22125 to 5, \u22125 = completely belong to the competence dimension, 5 = completely belong to the warmth dimension).

In Chinese culture, \u201cleader\u201d refers to those HP individuals in a general way, and \u201cordinary people\u201d refers to those LP individuals in a general way. Besides such two evaluated targets, the task included 10 pairs of traits, which were selected from previous research (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). Such 10 pairs of traits included 5 pairs of competence traits and 5 pairs of warmth traits, and each pair consisted of two traits with opposite meanings (e.g., smart vs. muddleheaded). These traits were listed in Table 1. For each target, participants needed tomark a number on an 11-point scale (ranging from \u22125 to 5) to indicate which of each pair was more suitable to describe the target, and to what extent it was suitable to describe the target. Specifically, if participants marked a negative number on the scale, it means that the negative trait was considered to be more suitable to describe the target group and vice versa. Under this logic, \u201c\u22125\u201d implied that the negative trait was very suitable for the target group, and \u201c5\u201d implied that the oppositely positive trait was very suitable for the target group. In this way, for each target, participants were asked to give their ratings across all 10 pairs of traits. The presentation order of the targets was counterbalanced across participants.\nAfter completing the trait-rating task, participants needed to provide necessary demographic information.

Then, a 3 (target power: senior HP, junior HP, LP) \u00d7 2 (stereotype dimension: competence vs. warmth) within-subjects ANOVA was conducted to examine how participants\u2019 rating scores varied with target power and stereotype dimension. This ANOVA analysis revealed a significant main effect of target power, F(2,62) = 25.23, p < 0.001, partial \u03b72 = 0.45. Post-hoc multiple comparisons showed that the rating score toward the senior HP target was significantly higher than the other two targets, ps < 0.001, and no significant difference was found between the junior HP target and the LP target, p > 0.05 (Msenior = 1.99, Mjunior = 0.04, and MLP = 0.41).

            "text": "In Study 1, we classified power into senior HP, junior HP, and LP, then we used the trait-rating task to investigate the contents of power stereotypes. The results showed that consistent with the results of the pilot study, the HP targets, in general, were perceived as positive competence but negative warmth in comparison with the LP target. More importantly, supporting our hypothesis 2, Study 1 found that, compared with the junior HP target, participants were inclined to indicate more positive warmth evaluations for the senior HP target\u2014the so-called MPMW effect. Indeed, not only that, but participants also gave more positive competence evaluations for the senior HP target than for the LP target. That is to say, participants indicated more positive evaluations on both competence and warmth dimensions for the senior HP target.\nFor the above result, we would give our interpretation, respectively, from the competence and warmth dimensions. It is a well-accepted view that competence is a basic approach to constituting power (Guinote and Vescio, 2010; Rucker et al., 2018). So, on the both intuitive and theoretical levels, it is easy to understand the phenomenon that more power was associated with higher competence. About the MPMW effect on the warmth dimension, so far there were two plausible explanations. One explanation was the Confucian explanation that we have documented. According to our\nreasoning, Confucianism has been the dominant philosophy in China for a long time, so most individuals in China remain high identification with the doctrines of Confucianism (Fung, 1948/2018). As a consequence, individuals under Confucian culture tend to believe that greater power represents greater social responsibility. Correspondingly, senior HP individuals are more likely to be considered to possess positive warmth traits than junior HP individuals. Under this vein, individuals\u2019 identification with Confucianism is the key factor for the appearance of the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes. Another seemingly plausible explanation was the \u201chalo effect\u201d. That means the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes is actually just because participants indiscriminately gave more positive evaluations toward senior HP individuals due to their greater power compared to junior HP individuals. In the following Study 2a and 2b, we would conduct empirical tests for such two explanations.\nSTUDIES 2A AND 2B\nIn Study 1, we classified power into senior HP, junior HP, and LP, and then applied the trait-rating task to investigate the contents of power stereotypes. Consistent with our hypothesis 2, we found the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes\u2014more power was associated with more positive competence and warmth. Regarding this effect, there seemed to be two possible explanations: the Confucianism explanation and the \u201chalo effect\u201d explanation. So, the major aim of Study 2a and 2b was to further clarify which of the two explanations was appropriate for the MPMW effect observed in Study 1.\nTo this end, in Study 2a, we would select some participants who highly identified with Confucianism and some other participants who less identified with Confucianism to compare the power stereotypes among these participants. The underlying logic was that if participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was the premise for the MPMW effect as we have mentioned, participants highly identifying with Confucianismwould indicate more positive evaluations on both competence and warmth dimensions for senior HP target than for junior HP target, but for those individuals less identifying with Confucianism, they would indicate more positive evaluations for the senior HP individuals only on the competence dimension. By contrast, if the \u201chalo effect\u201d could account for the perceived more positive warmth for the senior HP target, participants should indicate more positive evaluations for senior HP individuals on both competence and warmth dimensions regardless of their identification with Confucianism. In Study 2b, we would further compare the warmth perceptions of participants from Chinese and Western cultures. Consistent with Study 2a, we speculated that Chinese participants would indicate more positive evaluations on both competence and warmth dimensions for the senior HP target than for the junior HP target while participants from Western culture would indicate more positive evaluations for the senior HP target on the competence dimension but not on the warmth dimension.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 874861"

For their participation, they can get 10 RMB cash or a small gift worth 10 RMB. All participants were assigned the informed consent before the formal task.\nStudy 2b was an online study. According to the calculation of G\u2217Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2009), the presupposed 0.1 effect size and the 0.05 significance require at least 216 participants involved in this study. Considering possible invalid data, we finally recruited 240 participants to take part in the study. All participants were recruited via Credamo, a professional data collection platform (https://www.credamo.com). Half of the participants were recruited from China-mainland (Mage = 24.83, ranging from 19.33 to 54.75, 42 men, 78 women), and the other half were recruited from America, a typically Western country (Mage = 34.54, ranging from 18.92 to 55.98; 44 men, 76 women; 115 whites, 3 blacks, 2 Asians). Chinese participants completed the Chinese version of the task and Western participants completed the English version of the task. The two versions were developed by two psychological Ph.D. students who are proficient in both Chinese and English. Before the formal task, all participants needed to learn about the academic purpose of the research, and they could continue the task only after indicating their consent to the research. For their participation, they would receive 10 RMB (for Chinese participants) or 2 USD (for Western participants).\nThe key design of Study 2a was a 2 (target power: senior HP vs. junior HP) \u00d7 2 (stereotype dimension: competence vs. warmth) \u00d7 2 (Confucianism identification: high vs. low) mixed-measures ANOVA with Confucianism identification as the between-subjects variable.

To develop this Confucianism identification scale, we firstly invited 3 undergraduates to write 5 sentences for each person which can reflect the propositions of Confucianism about how people should exert their power. Then, we invited another 10 postgraduates to evaluate on a 5-points scale to what extent each sentence was in conformity with Confucianism (1= extreme disconformity, 5 = extreme conformity). Finally, the average score on each sentence was sorted in descending order and the top 3 sentences were selected to constitute the Confucianism identification scale. The scale was developed in Chinese and English two versions and the English version was listed here: (1) in my view, individuals with greater power should display more benevolence toward others; (2) if one person possesses social power, he/she should pay more attention to the livelihood of ordinary people; (3) those people with great social power generally have a high degree of social responsibility rather than only pursue their own enjoyment.

The following simple effect analyses showed that participants indicated a significantly higher score for the senior HP target than for the junior HP target on the sociability sub-dimension (M = 1.51, 0.32, respectively), t(127) = 4.66, p < 0.001, d = 0.52, but there were no significant differences between two targets on the morality sub-dimension (M = 0.87, 0.7, respectively), t(127) = 0.67, p= 0.51, d= 0.07."

For the MPMW effect on the warmth dimension, as we have mentioned in Study1, the Confucianism explanation and the \u201chalo effect\u201d explanation were both plausible explanations. However, in Study 2a, when we intentionally selected some participants displaying high/low identification with Confucianism, we found that participants with high Confucianism identification indicated more positive evaluations for the senior HP target on both competence and warmth dimensions, but for participants with low Confucianism identification, they gave the senior HP target more positive evaluations only on the competence dimension. Although the \u201chalo effect\u201d hypothesis could explain the result that participants with high Confucianism identification gave the senior HP target more positive evaluations on both competence and warmth dimensions, it could not explain why participants with low Confucianism identification gave the senior HP target more positive evaluations only on the competence dimension. Thus, the \u201chalo effect\u201d hypothesis can be basically eliminated from our research. Thus, Study 2a provided the initial support for our Confucianism explanation. In Study 2b, we conducted a cross-cultural study and found that the MPMW effect emerged for Chinese participants but not for Western participants. Moreover, this perceived warmth difference between senior and junior HP targets could not be explained by the perceived competitiveness between senior and junior HP targets. Additionally, our subsidiary analyses showed that when those warmth traits were distinguished as sociability and morality, participants gave more positive evaluations for the senior HP target than for the junior HP target on the sociability\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 874861\nsub-dimension, but not on the morality sub-dimension. This result suggested that participants\u2019 relatively negative warmth perception about the junior HP target may stem from their negative expectation about the social agreeableness of junior HP individuals, which to some extent provided additional support for our Confucianism explanation. Taken together, by measuring participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism on the individual level and conducting a cross-cultural study, the results of Study 2a and 2b consistently demonstrated that participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was the premise for the MPMW effect.\nSTUDY 3\nIn Study 2a, by deliberately selecting some participants with high/low Confucianism identification under Chinese culture, we found that the MPMW effect emerged for participants with high Confucianism identification but not for participants with low Confucianism identification. In Study 2b, by conducting a crosscultural study including Chinese and Western participants, we found that the MPMW effect emerged for Chinese participants but not for Western participants. The results of Study 2a and 2b consistently provided explicit evidence for our hypothesis 3 that participants\u2019 Confucianism identification was the premise for the MPMWeffect onHP stereotypes. In Study 3, we aimed to provide implicit evidence for the role of Confucianism identification in the MPMW effect. Specifically, in Study 3, we would apply the IAT to measure participants\u2019 power stereotypes on the implicit level. The IAT, originally developed by Greenwald et al. (1998), has been widely used to measure the implicit association strength of multiple stereotypes (Lai and Wilso, 2020). Compared to explicit measures, the IAT was considered to be less susceptible to social desirability effects, and thus more likely to detect individuals\u2019 internal \u201cunshaped\u201d beliefs (Nosek et al., 2011; Lai and Wilso, 2020). Thus, in the current research, the IAT was used to further confirm the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes and specify the condition for the emergence of the phenomenon.\nIn Study 3, we sought to use the priming technique to temporarily reduce participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism, and then examine the role of Confucianism in the emergence of the MPMW effect. Specifically, we randomly assigned participants to the control and the counterConfucianism conditions. Under the control conditions, participants firstly read two paragraphs irrelevant to Confucianism and then completed the IAT. Under the counterConfucianism condition, participants firstly read two paragraphs conveying the gist in opposition to Confucianism and then completed the IAT. More detailed descriptions about the IAT were provided in the Section Materials.\nIn the IAT, we defined senior and junior HP labels as target dimensions and defined positive and negative warmth traits as attribute dimensions. Because previous explicit results suggested that on the warmth dimension, participants gave senior HP individuals more positive evaluations than junior HP individuals, in the IAT, the combinations of \u201csenior HP\u2014 positive warmth\u201d and \u201cjunior HP\u2014negative warmth\u201d were defined as the compatible responses, and the combinations\nof \u201csenior HP\u2014negative warmth\u201d and \u201cjunior HP\u2014positive warmth\u201d were defined as the incompatible responses. Following previous research (Greenwald et al., 2003), the calculated D value was the indicator of implicit association strength of HP stereotypes and greater D values represented stronger strength of HP stereotypes. According to our reasoning, we speculated that when the counter-Confucianism information was presented, the D value would be significantly lower under the counterConfucianism condition than that under the control condition (no counter-Confucianism information)."

Concretely, in this so-called reading-comprehension task, approximately half of the participants were asked to read two passages that mainly told readers that although HP individuals under Confucian culture, including senior and junior HP individuals, alleged their social responsibility and benevolence for the whole society, they actually were likely to serve themselves by exerting their power. To increase the credibility of such counter-Confucianism materials, we provided some theoretical or practical evidence for our argument. To further reinforce the priming effect of the counter-Confucianism materials, all participants were required to extract and write the gist of each paragraph. Previous literature concerning gender stereotypes suggests that presenting the counter-stereotype materials to participants can effectively elevate the accessibility of stereotypeinconsistent information and reduce the strength of gender stereotypes (Dasgupta and Asgari, 2004). One of the two passages was translated into the English version and presented here as an example.\nIn China, when ordinary people suffer from unfair treatments from junior HP individuals, they prefer to ask for the assistance from senior HP individuals. As an example, in ancient China, those people who dare to tell their suffering to the then emperor in a faceto-face way, even risking their lives, have been legends in the public mind. We can find many such legends in a variety of literary works. Indeed, this interesting phenomenon may root in the Confucian culture. Specifically, since the Han Dynasty, Confucianism has been the dominant culture in China, which proposes that a \u201cqualified\u201d HP person should have a high degree of social responsibility and devote his life to serving for the whole society. Due to this chronic influence of Confucianism, most Chinese people are willing to believe that more power is associated with more social responsibility.

Psychological research indicates that power can increase psychological distance from others. That means, the more power one person holds, the less motivation to interact with others. Correspondingly, it actually is a difficult thing for HP individuals to pay much attention to others, especially to ordinary people. As a consequence, although Confucianism alleges that more power represents more social power and most people also believe that that\u2019s the case, unfortunately, once holding power, regardless of senior or junior HP individuals, they may do not have enoughmotivation to actively help ordinary people solve problems.\nIt should be noticed that the counter-Confucianism materials did not explicitly contain descriptions literally at odds with HP stereotypes (e.g., senior HP individuals commonly are hypocritical). Rather, the counter-Confucianism materials conveyed the implications contrary to the doctrines of Confucianism. That is, once holding power, regardless of senior or junior HP individuals, they will be less motivated to pay much attention to others; in contrast, they are more likely to afford their own needs by exerting their power. Thus, in the counter-Confucianism condition, we sought to reduce the implicit association strength of HP stereotypes by temporarily reducing participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism. In the control condition, the other half of the participants read two neutral materials which were both matched with the experimental materials in length and readability. One of the two passages introduced some UFO incidents in the past several decades, and the other introduced the formation and evolution of Antarctic glaciers. Participants in the experimental and control conditions were both instructed to complete the reading-comprehension task within 10 min.\nThe IAT Task In Study 3, the classic IAT was employed to assess the strength of HP stereotypes across two conditions. In the IAT task, the target dimension consisted of 8 HP labels (4 senior HP and 4 junior HP) and the attribute dimension consisted of 16 warmth traits (8 positive traits and 8 negative traits). All target and attribute words were selected from previous relevant research and listed in Table 5 (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017).\nThe IAT task was run by E-prime 3.0 on the computer. The classic IAT included 7 parts. At the beginning of each part, a task instruction was presented on the computer screen until participants pressed the space key, and then, participants needed to classify each stimulus by pressing the E or I key. In part 1, participants were instructed to classify 24 warmth traits into the \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d category. The 24 warmth traits consisted of all 16 warmth traits and the selected 8 traits from them in a pseudo-random way (4 positive warmth traits and 4 negative warmth traits). They needed to press the E key if a positive word was presented and they needed to press the I key if a negative word was presented. When they pressed the wrong key, the feedback \u201cwrong response (in Chinese)\u201d would be presented on the screen. Similarly, participants needed to classify 24 target labels into the \u201csenior HP\u201d or \u201cjunior HP\u201d category (8 HP labels were presented three times) in part 2. They needed to press the E key for senior HP labels and press the I key for junior HP\nlabels. Again, the feedback \u201cwrong response\u201d would be presented on the screen upon participants pressing an incorrect key. The main purpose of parts 1 and 2 was to make participants familiar with experimental stimuli and correct key-press.\nPart 3 and 4 were compatible combination-response parts. As we have mentioned above, we proposed that on the relative level, participants tended to associate senior HP labels with positive warmth traits and associate with junior HP labels with negative warmth traits. So, in part 3, participants needed to press the E key when senior HP labels or positive warmth traits were presented on the screen, and they needed to press the I key when junior HP labels or negative warmth words were presented on the screen. The task demand of part 4 was identical to that of part 3 except for the trial quantity\u2014part 3 consisted of 24 trials and Block 4 consisted of 48 trials.\nIn part 5, participants made the key-press contrary to part 1. That is, they needed to press the E key for negative warmth traits and press the I key for the positive warmth traits. To make participants fully familiar with this new key-press, part 5 consisted of 48 trials.\nParts 6 and 7 were incompatible combination-response parts in which participants needed to press the E key for senior HP labels or negative warmth traits and press the I key for junior HP labels or positive warmth traits. Similar to parts 3 and 4, part 6 consisted of 24 trials and part 7 consisted of 48 trials. In general, participants took about 15\u201317min to complete the whole IAT task."

The effectiveness of the counterConfucianism was estimated by summarizing each participant\u2019s score on three items of the Confucianism identification scale. The subsequent independent T-test revealed that participants in the counter-Confucianism condition reported a significantly lower score on the Confucianism identification scale than participants in the control condition, t(81) = 6.55, p < 0.001, d = 1.44 (M = 8.49, 11.95, respectively), thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our manipulation.

Two one-sample T-tests revealed that the D values in the counter-Confucianism and control conditions were both significantly > 0, ts > 12.36, ps < 0.001, suggesting that participants in both conditions showed the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes. Then, we conducted an independent T-test to compare the D values between the counter-Confucianism and control conditions.

Consistent with our speculation, the D value in the counter-Confucianism condition was significantly lower than that in the control condition, suggesting the weaker stereotype strength in the counter-Confucianism condition. From the perspective of the accessible theory (F\u00f6rster and Liberman, 2007; Higgins, 2012), when the counter-Confucianism stimuli were presented to participants, the temporarily accessible counter-Confucianism knowledge reduced participants\u2019 reliance on the chronically accessible Confucianism. As a reflection, the D value in the counter-Confucianism condition was significantly reduced than that in the control condition. Notably, despite significant differences in the D values between the counter-Confucianism and control conditions, the D values in both conditions were both significantly larger than zero. This finding suggested that the presentation of the counter-Confucianism information could reduce the MPMW effect, but it cannot eliminate the effect. Indeed, our finding was consistent with previous stereotype literature, which consistently demonstrated that although stereotypes display quite a flexibility and function, stereotypes are less likely to be completely eliminated (Fiske and Neuberg, 1990; Ellemers, 2018).\nIn Study 2, by measuring participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism on the individual level (2a) and selecting participants from Chinese and Western cultures (2b), we found that participants for whom Confucianism was chronically accessible knowledge, rather than participants for whom Confucianism was less accessible knowledge, tended to display the MPMW effect about HP stereotypes. In Study 3, we further found that when the accessibility of the counter-Confucianism information was temporarily elevated, participants showed a weaker MPMW effect in the IAT task. Thus, studies 2 and 3 provided compelling evidence for our hypothesis that Confucianism was a key premise for the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes\u2014only when Confucianism is accessible in a specific situation, do individuals tend to associate more power with more warmth with HP stereotypes."

By enacting the trait-rating task in a larger sample, Study 2a further confirmed the MPMW effect on HP stereotypes. More importantly, Study revealed that the MPMW effect was more likely to emerge for participants with high Confucianism identification (2a) or participants from Confucianism-dominant culture (2b), thus suggesting that participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism may be a premise for the emergence of the MPMW effect. In Study 3, by presenting the Counter-Confucianism stimuli to temporarily reduce the accessibility of Confucianism, we found that the D value in the IAT under the Counter-Confucianism condition was significantly lower than that under the control condition. This result indicated that because of the decline of the Confucianism accessibility, the strength of the MPMW effect had been significantly reduced, thus providing convincing evidence for our hypothesis that participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was the premise for the existence of the MPMW effect."

            "text": "Recently, Anicich et al. (2020) have pointed out that \u201can unstated premise in the social power literature is that an individual either has or lacks power\u201d, and a large body of literature also has exclusively focused on the static comparison between HP and LP individuals, thus to a great extent ignoring the dynamic nature of power (Anicich et al., 2020). Following the proposition by Anicich et al. (2020), the present research not only investigated the contents of power stereotypes about HP and LP individuals by adopting a simply dualistic classification approach (HP/LP) but also further divided HP into senior and junior HP by adopting a relatively continuous classification approach. The results showed that when adopting a dualistic classification approach for power, the current research kept consistent with previous research\u2014participants tended to evaluate LP individuals as negative competent but positive warmth and evaluate HP individuals as positive competent but negative warmth. In a simple word, elevated power was considered to be associated with more negative warmth. However, when HP was subdivided into senior HP and junior HP, we found that the evaluation of senior HP individuals\u2019 warmth did not linearly become more negative along with the elevation of power, and in contrast, senior HP individuals were considered to display more positive warmth than junior HP individuals. Regarding this so-called MPMW effect on HP individuals, our research revealed that participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was a key factor in its existence. When participants had less identification with Confucianism on the individual level or temporarily had relatively less identification with Confucianism due to experimental manipulation, the MPMW effect had been significantly reduced, even eliminated.\nAdditionally, we found that when comparing senior and junior HP individuals with LP individuals, participants,\nin general, gave more positive warmth evaluations for LP individuals than for HP individuals (including senior and junior HP individuals). In other words, the current research did not challenge previous literature which consistently demonstrates that LP individuals are considered to display more positive warmth than HP individuals (Cuddy et al., 2008; Russell and Fiske, 2008; Fragale et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). That implies, under Confucian culture, although explicitly differentiating senior and junior HP individuals could evoke participants\u2019 positive expectations toward senior HP individuals, this could not completely counteract their negative warmth evaluations toward HP individuals on the whole. To some extent, the result also suggests that Confucianism and individuals\u2019 real experiences may both contribute to the formation of power stereotypes under Chinese background, however, those real experiences may carry more weight in power stereotype formation. From a special perspective, the key role of Confucianism in the MPMW effect actually reminds us that we should be extremely cautious in assessing the representativeness and generality of the MPMW effect. At least according to our results, the MPMW effect may only exist among HP stereotypes under Confucian culture, and this conclusion still needs to be further assessed by conducting cross-cultural research."

            "heading": "Implications for Power Stereotype Research",
            "text": "At first glance, our finding that senior HP individuals were perceived as warmer than junior HP individuals was at odds with the theoretical propositions of the SCM (Fiske et al., 2002; Cuddy et al., 2008). According to the SCM, individuals tend to form ambivalent stereotypes about out-group members\u2014a positive evaluation on one dimension and a negative evaluation on the other. Moreover, the SCM posits that the elevation of competition and status often means more positive evaluation on the competence dimension but more negative evaluations on the warmth dimension. So, according to this proposition, senior HP individuals seemingly should be perceived as more negative on the warmth dimension compared to junior HP individuals. We proposed that this superficial contradiction could be accounted for by the term \u201creference group\u201d of the SCM (Cuddy et al., 2008, 2009). Specifically, the SCM defines the reference groups as in-groups to which perceivers belong or societal prototype groups which theoretically serve as normative standards for social comparison or social aspiration (Cuddy et al., 2009). According to this definition, senior HP individuals could be classified into the latter case, because Study 2a revealed that the great majority of participants reported that they actually had little chance to get access to senior HP individuals and they may form impressions about senior HP individuals mainly based on the construction of Confucianism. In this sense, theMPMWeffect on senior HP individuals actually reflects participants\u2019 expectation about HP individuals. In other words, senior HP individuals may be regarded as the reference group and the MPMW effect on them reflect the expectation of the whole Chinese society about how HP individuals should exert social power. Thus, our finding in essence is consistent with the propositions of the SCM.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 15 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 874861\nOn a broad level, the current research suggested that power stereotypes could serve to maintain the stability of social hierarchy, thus indicating the social function of power stereotypes (Ryan, 2002). As is well known, stereotypes function as a double-edged sword. On one hand, stereotypes can bias individuals\u2019 cognition and behavior, and even lead to particular kinds of discrimination and conflict in society (Bordalo et al., 2016). However, on the other hand, stereotypes also help us effectively navigate the social world. Specifically, on the individual level, the cognitive miser hypothesis postulates that in an environment that contains too much information, individuals apply specific stereotypes to simplify their information processing and enhance their processing efficiency (Brewer, 1988; Fiske and Neuberg, 1990). In addition to enhancing the efficiency of processing information, according to the \u201ckernel of truth\u201d hypothesis which contends that stereotypes may represent the over-amplified but the real existing differences between groups, stereotypes also provide a quick and intuitive assessment for us when confronting strangers or groups (Oakes et al., 1994). On the social level, some researchers have proposed that stereotypes to some extent reflect people\u2019s propensity to follow the social rules within a particular culture, and stereotypes can satisfy people\u2019s this need by serving to maintain the legitimacy and stability of social hierarchy (Tajfel, 1981; Leyens and Fiske, 1994). Supporting the view of the social function of stereotypes, our results suggest that possessing power stereotypes to some extent serves for maintaining the stability of social hierarchy. For example, when ordinary people realize that they have received unfair treatment from junior officials of the government (e.g., village head), they generally do not immediately take action against the government. Rather, they often choose to express their voices toward senior officials of the government (e.g., county head), which is called \u201capplying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help\u201d in Chinese society. According to our results, the logic underlying this phenomenon may be that most ordinary people believe that those leaders with greater power can handle matters in line with the doctrines of Confucianism and treat them fairly and kindly. In this sense, the social function of power stereotypes is similar to the function of the system justification theory (SJT), which posits that people generally perceive the prevailing social system as fair and legitimate, and are willing to maintain or bolster the stability of the whole society (Jost and Banaji, 1994; Kay and Jost, 2003)."

            "text": "Several limitations still existed in the current research. Firstly, in Study 2a, we found that participants indicated slightly more positive evaluations on the warmth dimension for the LP target than for the senior HP target. Considering that our main concern was the comparison of the perceived warmth between senior and junior HP targets, we thus did not further compare the perceived warmth between senior HP and LP targets. Given that, we actually could not draw a definite conclusion about the warmth comparison between senior HP and LP stereotypes under Confucian culture. This issue deserves further investigation. Also in Study 2a, our additional analyses showed that compared to junior HP targets, participants displayed more\npositive perceptions of senior HP targets on the sociability subdimension rather than on the morality sub-dimension. On the hand, this finding provided additional support for our Confucian explanation. However, on the other hand, it also reminds us that dividing traits into competence and warmth dimensions may be an oversimplified classification, and in future research, a more subtle classification of the trait level will help us have a deeper understanding about the MPMW effect. Thirdly, in Study 3, we found that the implicit evaluations toward senior HP targets on the warmth dimension became less positive when participants were presented with negative exemplars about senior HP individuals, but it is still certain whether the exposure to positive exemplars also could improve the evaluations toward junior HP individuals. In daily life, as we have described, most people actually have a high likelihood to interact with junior HP individuals rather than senior HP individuals. So, improving the evaluations of junior HP individuals may carry important practical implications for the stability of social order (Magee and Galinsky, 2008), and we should make a confirmation about this issue. Finally, due to lacking an available scale to assess individuals\u2019 identification with Confucianism, we developed the Confucianism scale containing three items. Although the scale displayed good internal consistency reliability in the current research, its suitability under Confucian culture should be completely assessed in a larger sample. Additionally, considering that the current research was the first time to reveal the MPMW effect on senior and junior HP individuals, we should be cautious about the generalizability of the effect, andmore work still needed to be done to solve this issue."

            "text": "By employing the trait-rating task and the IAT task, the current research found that under Chinese culture, although participants tended to associate more power with less warmth when comparing HP individuals with LP individuals, they associated more power with more warmth when comparing senior HP with junior HP individuals (the MPMW effect). By measuring/manipulating the accessibility of Confucianism, the current research further specified that participants\u2019 identification with Confucianism was the premise for the existence of the MPMW effect. The present research for the first time demonstrates that the contents of power stereotypesmay partially display culture-specific characteristics under Confucian culture. Additionally, the continuous perspective on power classification in our research provides a novel insight for future power research."
