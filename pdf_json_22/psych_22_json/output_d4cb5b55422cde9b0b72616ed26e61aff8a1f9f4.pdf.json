    "abstractText": "Objectives: Both substance use, on the one hand, and the first signs of psychosis, on the other, commonly begin in adolescence. Adolescents with substance use disorder (SUD) frequently show recreational use of cannabis and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). When attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) occur during the course of SUD, they are commonly attributed to the cannabis use, neglecting the role of other substances abused, such as MDMA in the risk of psychosis. Methods: We analyzed retrospective self-reports on APS (Prodromal Questionnaire, PQ-16) and amount of cannabis and MDMA use in n = 46 adolescent psychiatry outpatients with SUD. N = 17 (35%) individuals reported MDMA consume additional to cannabis. Furthermore, we examined the associations of APS with cannabis and MDMA use in stepwise hierarchical regressions while controlling for trauma history, birth complications and gender. Results: APS were not related to cannabis (B = 0.04, p = 0.842), but to MDMA use (B = 4.88, p = 0.001) and trauma history (B = 0.72, p = 0.001). Gender (B = \u22120.22, p = 0.767) and birth complications (B = \u22120.68, p = 0.178) were not associated with APS. Discussion: Our results indicate that MDMA use additional to cannabis use is associated with APS among adolescent SUD patients. Contrary to our expectations, we did not see an association of cannabis use and APS. We speculate that cannabis increases the risk for psychosis after a longer period of use and in combination with other risk factors, such as trauma history. Clinicians should screen for APS among SUD patients using MDMA and cannabis in order to adapt treatment plans of SUDs. Future research should validate these findings in longitudinal studies including polysubstance use and trauma history.",

Adolescents with\nsubstance use disorder (SUD) frequently show recreational use of cannabis and\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). When attenuated psychotic symptoms\n(APS) occur during the course of SUD, they are commonly attributed to the cannabis use,\nneglecting the role of other substances abused, such as MDMA in the risk of psychosis.\nMethods: We analyzed retrospective self-reports on APS (Prodromal Questionnaire,\nPQ-16) and amount of cannabis and MDMA use in n = 46 adolescent psychiatry\noutpatients with SUD. N = 17 (35%) individuals reported MDMA consume additional\nto cannabis. Furthermore, we examined the associations of APS with cannabis and\nMDMA use in stepwise hierarchical regressions while controlling for trauma history, birth\ncomplications and gender.\nResults: APS were not related to cannabis (B = 0.04, p = 0.842), but to MDMA use (B\n= 4.88, p = 0.001) and trauma history (B = 0.72, p = 0.001). Gender (B = \u22120.22,\np = 0.767) and birth complications (B = \u22120.68, p = 0.178) were not associated\nwith APS.\nDiscussion: Our results indicate that MDMA use additional to cannabis use is\nassociated with APS among adolescent SUD patients. Contrary to our expectations,\nwe did not see an association of cannabis use and APS. We speculate that cannabis\nincreases the risk for psychosis after a longer period of use and in combination with\nother risk factors, such as trauma history. Clinicians should screen for APS among SUD\npatients using MDMA and cannabis in order to adapt treatment plans of SUDs. Future\nresearch should validate these findings in longitudinal studies including polysubstance\nuse and trauma history.\nKeywords: addiction, marihuana, ecstasy, psychosis, substance abuse, THC\nINTRODUCTION\nAdolescence is typically characterized by physical and psychological changes leading to impulsive and hazardous behaviors, such as increased involvement in unintentional accidents, violence, high-risk sexual behavior as well as substance use (1). Among European adolescents and young adults, aged 15\u201324 years, cannabis use is reported by up to 23% (Italy) and\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use by up to 9% (Netherlands) at least once during the past year (2).\nFor a part of substance using adolescents this period is also marked by the emergence of mental health problems (3), such as an onset of psychotic disorders (PDs). PDs are a group of illnesses described by the presence of unusual belief systems which do not conform to societal norms (delusions), hallucinations (particularly auditory), and disorders of thought and cognition. Both substance use, on the one hand, and the first signs of PDs, on the other, commonly begin in late adolescence and early adult life (4).\nDuring the development of PDs non-specific and negative psychotic symptoms, which are defined as a lessening or absence of normative behaviors and functions related to motivation and interest (5), usually develop first and are followed by attenuated positive symptoms (6). 80\u201390% of patients suffering from schizophrenia report a period of attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) including changes in perception, beliefs cognition, affect, mood before developing full-blown psychosis (7). In the DSM5, APS are acknowledged as a distinct syndrome (attenuated psychotic syndrome) (8), which has been thought a risk state for later PDs and is associated with certain risk factors (9). Individuals that share a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder (PD) are being considered at high-risk for PDs and with transition rates ranging from 18%within 6 months to 36% within 3 years (10). Additionally another even more vulnerable group for developing PDs has been defined that is considered to be at \u201cultra-high-risk\u201d (7). According to (7), UHR applies young individuals (aged between 14 and 30 years old) being referred to meet one of the following criteria: (a) experiencing attenuated positive symptoms during the past year, (b) experiencing brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms lasting no longer than 1 week and abating spontaneously or (c) being at high-risk status for PDs and showing a significant decrease in functioning during the previous year (7, 11). However, more recent definitions of UHR include substance use among other environmental factors as well since individuals with UHR for psychosis often show increased rates of substance use (6).\nAlso APS and PDs in adolescence are frequently associated with heavy use of cannabis and stimulants (12, 13). While up to 100% of individuals with severe and 67% for moderate amphetamine use disorder reported psychotic symptoms (OR = 35.3, 95% CI 5.1\u2013246.5) (14), 80% of individuals with severe (OR= 26.8, 95% CI 10.3\u201369.6) and 79% with moderate cannabis use disorder (OR = 25.1, 95% CI 10.4\u201360.8) did this in the context of intoxication or withdrawal (14). Many studies indicate a dose-dependent relationship between cannabis use and risk for PDs (15, 16). A study on US- American adults showed that cannabis users (defined as at least one episode of cannabis use during a person\u2019s lifetime) were at greater risk for developing PDs (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.57) and schizotypal-personality disorders (OR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.69\u20132.42) compared to nonusers (17). These results indicate that PD risk could be positively associated with higher consume rates of cannabis. However, it is difficult to draw causal conclusions from most of these studies because cannabis is often used in combination with other illicit substances, such as MDMA.\nMDMA is a synthetic drug which belongs to the substance class of amphetamines and is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogenmescaline (18). Dual use ofMDMA and cannabis is especially prevalent in 15\u201316 year old adolescents, with 8\u201313% of whom report having used both substances within the past month (19). MDMA use has been previously shown to induce psychosis in single case studies (20\u201322). In rats MDMA has been shown to disrupt mechanisms of auditory sensory gating via its involvement in both dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways (23, 24). Sensory gating is a form of information processing where irrelevant stimuli are being ignored and is being hypothesized to be deficient in patients suffering from PDs (25). Whereas findings on the relationship between amphetamine and methamphetamine use indicate that these substances are associated with PDs (26\u201329), findings on MDMA are restricted to single case studies (22, 30). However, little research has been conducted on the relationship between MDMA and PDs so far and to our knowledge, there is no study that compared its relationship to simultaneous cannabis use.\nIn addition to substance use, other environmental factors play an important role in the development of PDs (31), such as trauma history and birth and pregnancy complications. Compared to the global population patients with PDs show higher prevalence of trauma history, such as sexual (48% females, 28% males) or physical (48% females, 50% males) child abuse (32\u201334). Further, birth and pregnancy complications resulting in low birth weight, gestational bleedings, emergency cesarean section and signs of asphyxia have been frequently associated with PDs (35, 36). Additionally, it is important to control for factors that have been reported to affect substance use or substance use disorders (SUDs) such as gender (37). SUDs have been shown to occur more frequently among male individuals with PDs (OR = 3.43, 95% CI 3.01\u20133.92) (37), indicating that it is an additional factor that influences the relationship between the risk of PD and hazardous substance use. Therefore it is important to study the relationship between these environmental risk factors and the origins of development of PDs, since transition rates from being at risk for psychosis range between 6% within two (38) and 45% within six years (39). However, it is less clear how these environmental factors, including substance use, interact with APS in adolescence. This is of great importance because PDs typically develop in adolescence and early adulthood, thus identifying risk factors could provide a base for targeted interventions.\nOur study aims to investigate the relationship between self reported past year cannabis, MDMA use and APS in adolescents with SUDs while considering environmental factors and comparing the influences of cannabis and MDMA use.\nWe aim to examine the associations of average past year amount of cannabis, additional average past year amount of MDMA use and APS in adolescents with SUDs. We include factors such as birth complications, gender, and traumatic experience in our analyses to control for confounding influences. Furthermore, we hypothesize that 1) higher average past year amount of cannabis use is correlated with increased risk of PD in addition to other environmental factors, and that 2) higher\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 696133\nTABLE 1 | Sample characteristics of cannabis and additional MDMA users.\nCharacteristics Total (n = 46) Cannabis users without Cannabis users with additional Group comparison\nMDMA use (n = 29) MDMA use (n = 17) Test statistic p-value Effect size\n(df)\nSocioeconomic data Female gender (%)a 21 (46) 9 (31) 12 (71) \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 6.76 0.009 \u03c6 = 0.38 Age (SD)b 16.19 (1.23) 16.39 (1.16) 15.84 (1.29) F (1,46) = 2.17 0.148 \u03b7 2 part = 0.05 Drop-out from schoola (%) 4 (12%) 1 (4%) 3 (28%) \u03c7\u00b2(1,34) = 3.77 0.052 \u03c6 = 0.33\nLiving with both parentsa (%)\n6 (19%) 5 (23%) 1 (10%) \u03c7\u00b2(1,32) = 0.73 0.393 \u03c6 = \u22120.15\nMedical comorbiditya (%)\n12 (35%) 7 (30%) 5 (55%) \u03c7\u00b2(1,34) = 0.74 0.391 \u03c6 = \u22120.15\nAPS (SD)b 4.08 (3.55) 2.99 (2.56) 5.93 (4.26) F (1,46) = 8.60 0.005 \u03b7 2 part = 0.16 Average daily amount of past year substance use (SD) Cannabis (in grams)b 1.48 (1.86) 1.17 (1.48) 2.00 (2.33) F (1,46) = 2.19 0.146 \u03b7 2 part = 0.05 MDMA additional to cannabis (in pills)b 0.23 (0.41) - 0.62 (0.46) \u2013 Trauma historyb 1.96 (2.00) 1.75 (2.05) 2.33 (1.91) F (1,46) = 0.89 0.350 \u03b7 2 part = 0.02 Birth complicationsc 0.65 (0.98) 0.62 (0.93) 0.71 (1.07) F (1,46) > 0.09 0.762 \u03b7 2 part = 0.02 Co-occurring psychiatric disorders (DSM-V, %) Alcohol use disorderb 12 (39)d 8 (44)e 4 (31)f \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 0.60 0.440 \u03c6 = \u22120.14 Affective disorderb 13 (42)d 6 (33)e 7 (54)f \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 1.30 0.253 \u03c6 = 0.21 Anxiety disordersb 11 (36)d 5 (28)e 6 (46)f \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 1.11 0.291 \u03c6 = 0.19\nPost traumatic stress disorderb 5 (16)d 2 (11)e 3 (23)f \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 0.80 0.371 \u03c6 = 0.16 Conduct disorderb 9 (29)d 4 (22)e 5 (39)f \u03c7\u00b2(1,46) = 0.97 0.326 \u03c6 = 0.18\nMDMA, 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. aCategorical variable, group differences were tested with Chi-Squared Tests, effect sizes are expressed as Phi (\u03c6). bContinuous variable, group differences are tested with MANOVA, effect sizes are expressed as partial eta squared (\u03b72 part ). cOrdinal variable (0 = not present, 1 = present either before/during/after birth, 2/3 = present at two/three of these time points), group differences are tested with ANOVA, effect sizes are expressed as partial eta squared (\u03b72 part ). dNot available for n = 15 (33%). eNot available for n = 11 (38%). fNot available n = 4 (24%).

At the same time, past year MDMA use was positively associated with APS.\nOur findings indicate a dose-response relationship between APS and MDMA use additional to cannabis use. Similar results were obtained by (49) who examined the additive effects of MDMA to cannabis use on APS. In their sample of young adult military conscripts in Turkey (age of individuals with cannabis and MDMA use M = 20.47, SD = 0.79 years) MDMA use showed weak to moderate positive correlations with APS. MDMA free periods were negatively correlated with APS, seemingly confirming an assumption from singlecase studies that MDMA is able to induce acute APS (20, 22, 30). The associations between MDMA use and increased risk for APS were not affected by presence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Our results revealed a tendency toward higher APS and in affective and anxiety disorders and PTSD. This is in line with previous studies indicating that adolescent with clinical high risk for psychosis show increased psychiatric comorbidity (50, 51).\nContrary to previous studies and meta-analyses showing a strong association between cannabis use and increased risk of PDs (15, 52), we failed to find an association between cannabis use and APS. However, most of these studies examined the relationship between cannabis use and APS or psychosis in adult samples, whereas our sample consisted of adolescents. A study in US-American non-help seeking adolescents [M = 16.90, SD = 1.85; (53)] found no association between cannabis use itself (after controlling for use of other substances) and APS or psychosis. In the follow up analysis of this study (53), cannabis among other substances was associated with APS, but this was reduced to a trend after correction for multiple testing. This indicates that cannabis may only contribute to developing APS among other risk factors and therefore might not or only weakly present as a risk factor for APS in epidemiological studies. Further, another possible explanation could be that the effects of cannabis use on APS cumulate during persistent use in adolescents and may emerge later in development which is supported by another study (54).\nAdditionally, there are studies that reveal mixed findings on the relationship between cannabis use and APS when considering polysubstance use. In another study (55) polydrug use (psychomotor stimulants, MDMA included) accounted for the link between cannabis use and APS in an adult sample. Unfortunately, the associations between additional MDMA use without use of other stimulants and APS were not analyzed, probably due to small sample size of individuals only using MDMA. However, these findings further strengthen the hypothesis that stimulant use (including MDMA) plays an important role in the development of APS and at least partly accounts for the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis in poly-drug users.\nAnother factor that might affect the relationship between cannabis use and APS is the experience of traumatic events, especially in childhood.

            "text": "childhood trauma and abuse (56). In this study among young adults, cannabis use in individuals with genetic predisposition for psychosis was only associated with APS when having a history of childhood abuse (56). These results indicate that trauma history could be a crucial factor in the interaction with genetic predisposition for a development of psychosis among cannabis using adolescents or young adults.\nAdditionally, there is evidence that trauma history and cannabis use are risk factors for PDs, not only in genetically predisposed individuals (31). Cumulative effects of trauma history and cannabis use were shown to heighten persistence rates of APS (57, 58) and therefore interfere with the development of psychosis. Collecting data from three large longitudinal studies (57), found that persistence rates of baseline APS were higher with greater exposure to cannabis use or childhood trauma. Together, the effects of trauma history and its neurophysiological changes (59), in combination with adolescent substance use, could contribute to a higher risk of developing psychosis (60).\nHowever, cannabis use and trauma history do not correlate with each other in our sample, whereas trauma history and MDMA use additional to cannabis were correlated. This association between trauma history and MDMA use is worth noting because MDMA has its origins as a therapeutic agent trauma focused psychotherapy. However, trauma history and\nadditional MDMA use each were independently associated with APS. Therefore, trauma history might account for the relationship between cannabis use and APS but does not account for the relationship between additional MDMA use and APS.\nMDMA and cannabis use have been associated with increased serotonin receptor sensitivity and this could increase the risk of psychosis. MDMA increases dopamine and serotonin activity in the striatum, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and midbrain (61, 62). Further, single doses of MDMA injection lead to altered serotonin receptor response up to 6 months in rats (63) and cause serotonin receptor hypersensitivity (64). Additionally, serotonin receptor sensitization has been observed after chronic 19 \u2013tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive compound of cannabis) exposure in rats (65). An upregulated serotonin system is hypothesized to lead to a chain reaction involving the glutamate and dopamine system in mesolimbic areas and finally result in APS via an altered salience system (66). Experiencing symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, might represent the individuals effort to make sense of it as aberrantly salient experiences or internal representations (67).\nAlthough we cannot draw any causal inferences from our results, we speculate that cannabis use and additional MDMA use affect the development of APS differently. The effects of heavy cannabis use during adolescence on APS might only emerge later\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 696133\nin adulthood andmight only do so in combination with other risk factors, e.g., trauma history or genetic predisposition.MDMAuse on the other hand, might be a risk factor for APS independent of cannabis use and trauma history. Our results indicate that its effects already seem to be present in adolescence. Therefore, adolescent MDMA use could be a risk factor for psychosis later in life, after APS manifest. However, future research should apply longitudinal designs including these risk factors to examine the long-term effects of recreational cannabis and MDMA use and trauma history.\nAccording to our results, the association between MDMA use additional to cannabis and APS, leads us to conclude that adolescents with such a pattern of substance use might be especially at risk for PDs. Screening and regular checks for APS among MDMA using adolescents could enable medical practitioners to identify the need for and provide medical support at an early stage. Medical treatment of symptoms of psychosis needs to be implemented in treatment plans of SUDs and could be crucial for its success because of their severe impairment of functioning associated with psychosis and risk for injuries (68)."

            "text": "As there are several limitations, our results must be interpreted with caution. First, the sample size for computing hierarchical regression with five factors would need a greater sample size to detect small effects. However, we focused on choosing a sample that is as homogenous as possible concerning types of used substances resulting in exclusion ofmany subjects that were using stimulants other thanMDMAon a regular basis. In consideration of the fact that research on the effects of MDMA use in addition to cannabis is sparse and studies on SUDs in adolescents often struggle with small sample sizes due to weak compliance, we believe that our results can still give a valuable contribution to research on substance use and PDs. However, replication in larger samples with higher statistical power is needed to confirm these findings.\nSecond, our analyses are cross-sectional. Therefore, we are not able to conclude whether or not cannabis or additional MDMA use is a causal factor for APS, since we have no information about preexisting APS. Furthermore, we cannot say whether APS in our study are permanent and actually lead to psychosis, due to the cross sectional design of our study. It is possible that in some individuals of our sample PS are due to acute (withdrawal) effects of cannabis/MDMA and might remit after abstinence. Therefore, longitudinal studies are needed to draw causal conclusions between cannabis/MDMA use and APS and further examine the duration of APS associated with MDMA use.\nThird, we were not able to include participants that used MDMA exclusively. Therefore, we could not investigate the effect of MDMA use on APS independently from additional cannabis consume. However, a previous study found that most MDMA users also use cannabis on a regular basis (69), which indicates that examining the associations between MDMA only\nand APSmight refer to a small population of users. Therefore, we think that our study design is in line with clinical observations indicating seldom MDMA abuse as an only used substance. Future studies should focus on long-term effects of cannabis and additional MDMA use on psychosis and differentiate between cannabis use without additional substance use, MDMA use without additional substance use and dual use of both substances. Further, it remains unclear if the association between additional MDMA use and APS in our study can be traced back to polysubstance use in general, which is up to future studies to examine.\nFourth, the instrument for assessing APS did not specify the period in which APS occurred. Therefore, we cannot conclude that various APS occurred in a short period, which would implicate a more severe form of APS and increased risk for psychosis, e.g., when symptoms occur during a period of 2 week (see acute transient psychotic disorder; WHO, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10).\nFinally, we were not able to record objective measures of substance use across our population. Rating of substance use might be underreported by individuals due to recall biases and social stigma. However, these are influences that should affect all individuals equally which keeps the effect constant over both groups and cannot lead to the observed differences across the groups. This is an important topic which is why we currently work on a project in which we compare self-reports of drug use and objective measures of metabolites in hair to validate self-reports. Another problem due to subjective measure of substance use is that we lack information of the potency of the used substance. The fact that we did not see an association between cannabis use and APS could be due to low potency cannabis that was used by our population. However, this seems very unlikely since the presence of high THC/low CBD cannabis is increasing and associations between high potency cannabis and mental health and substance use issues in adolescents have been previously reported (69)."
