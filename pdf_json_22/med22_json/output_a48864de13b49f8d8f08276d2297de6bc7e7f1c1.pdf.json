This study aimed to evaluate the e ect of bispectral index (BIS) guidance during TIVA in younger children during anesthesia.\nMethods: This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blind and controlled clinical trial. This study enrolled pediatric patients (aged 1\u20133 years) who were scheduled for surgery under TIVA with propofol and remifentanil. The children were randomly assigned to the BIS group (group B) and standard clinical practice group (group S). The BIS values in group B were maintained at 45\u201360. The anesthesiologist controlled the depth of anesthesia in group S according to the variation in the clinical signs of the children. The time of extubation, duration of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), as well as BIS values, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse oxygen saturation at eight time points 1min before induction (T1), 1min after induction (1min after the induction drugs were administrated) (T2), immediately after intubation (T3), immediately after skin incision (T4), 30min after the start of the operation (T5), 60min after the start of operation (T6), immediately after drug withdrawal (T7), and immediately after extubation (T8), propofol consumption, and postoperative adverse reactions were recorded.\nResults: There was no significant di erence in time to extubation 15(10,21) vs 14 (11,20) and duration of stay in PACU 27 (20,37) vs. 29 (22,39) between the group B and group S. At the time points 30min after the start of the operation, 60min after the start of operation and immediately after drug withdrawal, the BIS values in group S were significantly higher than those in group B (57 \u00b1 9, 57 \u00b1 9, 60 \u00b1 8 vs 52 \u00b1 7, 54 \u00b1 7, 57 \u00b1 6).\nConclusions: The use of BIS-guided total intravenous anesthesia in younger children does not shorten the time of extubation and the duration of stay in the PACU.\nTrial registration: Chictr.org.cn identifier: 24/11/2017, ChiCTR-IOR17013530.\nKEYWORDS\nbispectral index, younger children, total intravenous anesthesia, recovery, propfol\nFrontiers inNeurology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Compared to inhalation anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia may present clinical advantages. Recent studies have demonstrated that propofol anesthesia in children, as in adults, is associated with a major reduction in post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting incidence (1), with a decrease in emergence agitation episodes (2) and a better quality of recovery (3). In addition, TIVA is widely accepted by anesthesiologists because it reduces passive inhalation by anesthesiologists. Currently, the latest application method of TIVA involves using a targetcontrolled infusion pump to induce and maintain anesthesia. However, the target-controlled infusion pump is not available in all countries and hospitals; therefore, a manual infusion regimen based on varying infusion rates is widely used in children (4). The dose and speed of manual infusion are judged and adjusted by pediatric anesthesiologists according to the clinical parameters of the children. Because many factors interfere with clinical parameters, it is difficult to adjust the anesthesia depth objectively, quantitatively, and accurately (5). Therefore, continuous propofol infusion under the guidance of BIS or other monitoring indexes has gradually gained application in pediatric anesthesia. Although the algorithm of BIS is calculated based on adult research, after years of research, there have been many literature studies that BIS are safe and feasible in children\u2019s sedation and anesthesia, and have a good role in guiding the depth of anesthesia (6\u201314). Previous studies have shown that propofol combined with remifentanil infusion under auditoryevoked potential monitoring can reduce propofol consumption and time to the emergency (15). Still, studies show that BISguided propofol infusion has no advantage over conventional anesthesia in propofol consumption and emergency times (16). Regardless of the results of previous studies, there are still fewer studies on the effect of BIS-guided TIVA than that on conventional methods in younger children.\nThe objective of this prospective, randomized, controlled study was to evaluate the effects of BIS monitoring TIVA in younger children on time to extubation and on the quantity of anesthetics compared with the conventional anesthesia method."

The exclusion criteria were as follows: children with intraoperative use of inhaled anesthetics, those who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries for congenital heart disease, craniocerebral surgeries, where BIS electrodes could not be placed, and surgeries with an estimated operative time < 60min. Children with a history of nervous system disease, use of related psychoactive medications, and a history of allergy to the study drug were likewise excluded. Children were randomized into the BIS group (group B) and the standard clinical practice group (group S) using SAS 9.4 software, with 215 children in each group. The anesthesia depth of children in group B was accurately adjusted according to the BIS value. The anesthesia depth of children in group S was adjusted according to the judgment of the clinical parameters by the anesthesiologist."

BIS electrodes were attached to the forehead of the child, and a BIS monitoring instrument (Aspect Medical System, USA, Version 3.0) was connected and continuously monitored.\nAll children underwent induction with 2\u20133 mg/kg of propofol (1% propofol in a medium-chain/long-chain triglyceride emulsion; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland Gmbh, Germany), 0.2\u20130.3 \u00b5g/kg of sufentanil (Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hubei Province, China) or 2\u20133 \u00b5g/kg of fentanyl (Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hubei Province, China), 0.5\u20130.7 mg/kg of rocuronium (Hameln Pharmaceuticals Gmbh, Germany), followed by endotracheal intubation after a sufficient depth of anesthesia was achieved.\nFrontiers inNeurology 02 frontiersin.org\nAfter intubation, the anesthesia machine (Datex-Ohmeda Inc., Madison, USA) was connected to maintain mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 8\u201310 ml/kg, a frequency of 15\u201320 beats/min, and I: E= 1:2, End-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure 35\u201345 mmHg. An intravenous injection pump (Smiths Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., Zhejiang Province, China) was then connected for continuous intravenous infusion of propofol 4\u201312 mg/kg/h and remifentanil (Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hubei Province, China) 0.2\u20130.4 \u00b5g/kg/min to maintain anesthesia. For pediatric patients in group B, the anesthesiologist adjusted the infusion rate of propofol according to the BIS values and tried to keep the BIS values between 45 and 60. Pediatric patients in group S were also monitored for BIS, but the anesthesiologist was blinded to the BIS value, and the research nurse recorded the BIS value. The anesthesiologist controlled the anesthesia depth according to routine methods of HR, BP, and surgical simulation. After skin closure, all anesthetic infusions were discontinued, and the endotracheal tube could be removed when the child\u2019s protective reflexes such as choking and swallowing were restored. There was an eye-opening reflex by patting the cheek. The patients were sent to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and continued to be observed and evaluated by the nurses who were unaware of the study design and grouping in the recovery room. The patients could return to the ward only after the total score of the three items was above 4 points (A + B + C \u2265 4 points). The Steward Awakening Score Scale (17) is presented in Table 1."

In addition, the results showed that there was no significant difference in the administration of propofol between manuallycontrolled infusion and target-controlled infusion of propofol, indicating that manually-controlled infusion of propofol is a feasible method for children. When propofol infusion was guided by the BIS, no major difference was found between TIVA and TCI (20).\nBIS is a value from 0 to 100 calculated based on a certain complex algorithm of adult EEG frequency, not a simple EEG frequency display. BIS technology has undergone a series of upgrades. The four electrode Quattro BIS (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) sensor was released in January 2005 and is now recommended for the pediatric population (21). The results of retrospective studies conducted by Carlos et al. demonstrated that using BIS monitoring in adult general anesthesia operations could reduce extubation, time of awakening, duration of stay in the operating room, and PACU. It can also reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting, cognitive dysfunction within 3 months after the operation, postoperative delirium, intraoperative awareness, and adverse events related to anesthetic medications (5). The results of a study conducted by Bhardwaj et al. showed that BIS-guided propofol infusion\nFrontiers inNeurology 06 frontiersin.org\nin children was not superior to the conventional anesthesia method in anesthetic consumption and recovery time (7), and the study conducted by Bresil et al. on continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with BIS monitoring in children or adults showed similar results. It was concluded that continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with BISmonitoring could not reduce the amount of anesthetic used and the time of extubation in children or adults (22). The results of our study showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the time of extubation and duration of stay in the PACU between the BIS monitoring group and the standard clinical practice group, which was different from that of the adult study by Carlos et al. (5) but consistent with that of a previous study on children by Bhardwaj et al. (16). There was a statistically significant difference in the total amount of propofol administered in our study. The total amount was greater in the BIS group than in the standard clinical practice group. This result was inconsistent with the findings of previous studies on children by Bhardwaj et al. and Bresil et al. (16, 22). The reason may be that the above previous studies were conducted in older children, while our study was aimed at younger children during anesthesia. The anesthesiologist in the standard clinical practice group was relatively cautious to face the younger children when administering the drug. This result was also consistent with those reported in previous literature, showing that there could be a higher risk when manually controlled infusions were conducted using only clinical signs as reference indexes (19).\nThe results of studies conducted by Tschiedel et al. showed that when the BIS was less than 60, good sedation could be provided during anesthesia in children, intraoperative awareness could be reduced. The depth of anesthesia sedation could be adjusted at any time according to the BIS value to prevent drug overdose (23). In this study, the BIS values of younger children in the BIS group were consistently below 60 during anesthesia at T2\u2013T7, maintaining a good depth of anesthesia, while the BIS values of younger children in group S were all\u226560 at T4\u2013T7. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant. In terms of clinical signs, although there was no statistically significant difference in heart rate between the two groups, the mean arterial pressure in group S was at a high level from half an hour after the start of the operation to immediately after extubation, which was significantly different from that in the BIS group. The results of previous studies in children showed that there was no statistically significant difference in blood pressure, heart rate, and BIS value between the BIS monitoring group and the standard clinical practice group during anesthesia (16, 22). Although one study has shown that the BIS values of children aged 1\u201311 during anesthesia were higher than 60, that may be due to no muscle relaxant (22). Based on the analysis of the results of the BIS value and mean arterial pressure, it was considered that this was because the anesthesiologist in group S was relatively cautious while administering drugs in younger\nchildren during anesthesia. Therefore, there may be a risk of intraoperative awareness if there is shallow anesthesia in group S. These results further explain why the consumption of propofol in group B was larger than that in group S. Nevertheless, there was no difference in the time of extubation between groups B and S, indicating that TIVA with BIS monitoring was superior to the method used in the standard controlled group.\nIn this study, the mode of continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil was intraoperatively used. A study has shown that remifentanil can reduce the cardiac index (CI) and increase the plasma concentration of propofol. However, it had no obvious effect on the BIS value (24). Therefore, during the operation, in group B, the anesthesia depth was adjusted by changing the dose of propofol according to the BIS value, while in group S, the depth was adjusted according to the clinical signs."

Although the data displayed by the machine is lagging, all the data are also lagging, so the statistical results are still meaningful. Second, because of younger age, no investigation of intraoperative awareness was performed in the selected children. Therefore, in shallow anesthesia, it can be speculated that there is a possibility of intraoperative awareness. Finally, the single-blind approachmay affect the results. These are also the focus of our future research."
