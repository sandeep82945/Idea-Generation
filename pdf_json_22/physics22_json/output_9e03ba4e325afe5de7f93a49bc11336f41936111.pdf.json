Although a direct cascade is predicted in the transverse (\u22a5) and parallel (\u2016) directions to the rotation axis, we show numerically that in the latter case some triadic interactions can have a negative contribution to the energy flux, while in the former case all interactions contribute to a positive flux.

The strength of this theory, based on a multiple-scale technique, lies in its analytical and rigorous character, and the fact that it leads to a natural asymptotic closure of the hierarchy of moment equations when considering the long-term statistical behaviour. We are interested here in waves resulting from the rapid rotation, at a rate \u03a9 , of an incompressible fluid: these are inertial waves. They appear when the Coriolis force is introduced into the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, which breaks the spherical symmetry and introduces (statistical) anisotropy. The theory of inertial wave turbulence was derived by Galtier (2003). It is an asymptotic theory valid in the limit of small Rossby number Ro = U/(L\u03a9) 1, with\n\u2020 Email address for correspondence: vincent.david@lpp.polytechnique.fr\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

The theory, developed for three-wave interactions, predicts anisotropic turbulence with a direct cascade preferentially in the direction transverse to the axis of rotation \u03a9 . In the limit k\u22a5 k\u2016, where k\u22a5 and k\u2016 refer to the wavenumbers perpendicular and parallel to \u03a9 , respectively, an exact solution is derived, the Kolmogorov\u2013Zakharov (KZ) energy spectrum, which is Ek \u223c k\u22125/2\u22a5 |k\u2016|\u22121/2. This solution corresponds to a stationary state for which the energy flux is constant and positive. Note that there is another type of solution, the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans spectrum associated with the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system and for which the energy flux is zero.\nRotating hydrodynamic turbulence has been extensively studied both numerically (Bellet et al. 2006; Pouquet & Mininni 2010; Pouquet et al. 2013; Le Reun et al. 2017; Buzzicotti et al. 2018; Seshasayanan & Alexakis 2018; Sharma, Verma & Chakraborty 2019; van Kan & Alexakis 2020) and experimentally (Baroud et al. 2002; Morize, Moisy & Rabaud 2005; van Bokhoven et al. 2009; Lamriben, Cortet & Moisy 2011; Campagne et al. 2014; Yarom & Sharon 2014; Godeferd & Moisy 2015; Yarom, Salhov & Sharon 2017). In particular, recent studies (Le Reun, Favier & Le Bars 2020; Monsalve et al. 2020; Yokoyama & Takaoka 2021) have reported energy spectra consistent with the prediction of inertial wave turbulence theory. But until now, an important theoretical point has been left out: the verification of the locality of the KZ spectrum to ensure the finiteness of the energy flux. This is a criterion of locality of interactions that supports Kolmogorov\u2019s idea that the inertial range is independent of the largest (forcing) and smallest (dissipation) scales. To prove the locality of the KZ spectrum, it is necessary to return to the kinetic equation and study the convergence of the integrals (Zakharov et al. 1992); this is the first objective of this article. The second objective is to study the energy flux to find an estimate of the Kolmogorov constant.\nAfter a brief introduction to inertial wave turbulence in \u00a7 2, we prove that the KZ spectrum is indeed \u2018local\u2019, which gives strong theoretical support to recent numerical and experimental studies. In \u00a7 3, we show numerically that the energy fluxes in the perpendicular and parallel directions do not behave in the same way because in the latter case some triadic interactions can have a negative contribution to the energy flux, whereas in the former case all interactions contribute to a positive flux. We also numerically estimate the Kolmogorov constant before concluding in \u00a7 4."

The linear solutions of (2.1) are inertial waves with the angular frequency\n\u03c9k = 2\u03a9 k\u2016k . (2.2) The first main result of the theory of inertial wave turbulence is the derivation of the kinetic equation that describes the nonlinear evolution of the energy spectrum on a time scale much larger than the wave period \u03c4 \u223c 1/\u03c9k. For reasons of simplicity, we assume an equipartition of energy densities between the co- and counter-propagating inertial waves,\n955 R2-2\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n10 73\nP ub\nlis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nand therefore we do not consider the kinetic helicity, which is then zero. This turbulence being anisotropic with a transfer mainly in the transverse direction to \u03a9 , it is relevant to write the kinetic equation in the limit k\u22a5 k\u2016. Note that we often implicitly assume that the energy is initially isotropically distributed at the largest scales of the system, but the same dynamics is expected if initially the energy is located elsewhere, as long as the inertial wave turbulence condition on the time scales is satisfied (see discussion in Galtier (2003)). The exception is when the energy is confined to k\u2016 = 0, which cannot be described by wave turbulence. In the limit k\u22a5 k\u2016, the kinetic equation reads (for more details, see Galtier (2003))\n\u2202tEk = 2\n32\u03a9 \u2211 skspsq \u222b \u0394\u22a5 sin \u03b8 skspp\u2016 p2\u22a5q 2 \u22a5k\u2016 (sqq\u22a5 \u2212 spp\u22a5)2(skk\u22a5 + spp\u22a5 + sqq\u22a5)2Eq\n\u00d7 (p\u22a5Ek \u2212 k\u22a5Ep)\u03b4 (\nskk\u2016 k\u22a5 + spp\u2016 p\u22a5 + sqq\u2016 q\u22a5\n) \u03b4(k\u2016 + p\u2016 + q\u2016) dp\u22a5 dq\u22a5 dp\u2016 dq\u2016.\n(2.3)\nHere Ek = E(k\u22a5, k\u2016) is the axisymmetric energy spectrum, si is the wave polarity (si = \u00b11 with i = k, p, q), \u03b8 is the angle between k\u22a5 and p\u22a5 in the triangle k\u22a5 + p\u22a5 + q\u22a5 = 0, \u03b4 is the Dirac distribution, and the integration in the perpendicular direction is done over the domain \u0394\u22a5, which satisfies the previous triadic relation. The integral is preceded by a factor 2, with a small dimensionless parameter (0 < 1), which can be identified as the Rossby number (which also means that w \u03a9). This means that the nonlinear dynamics develops on a time scale \u223c \u03c4/ 2, which is much longer than the wave period. The stationary solution of the kinetic equation (2.3) is the KZ spectrum\nEk = CEk\u22125/2\u22a5 |k\u2016|\u22121/2, (2.4)\nwhere CE is necessarily positive (it will be defined later).\n2.2. Convergence domain We begin with a proposition.\nPROPOSITION 2.1. The domain of convergence of the kinetic equation (2.3) for power-law spectra Ek \u223c k\u2212x\u22a5 |k\u2016|\u2212y is given by the locality conditions\n3 < x + 2y < 4, (2.5) 2 < x + y < 4, (2.6)\nboth of which must be satisfied. This result shows a familiar property of wave turbulence: the KZ spectrum, for which x = 5/2 and y = 1/2, falls exactly in the middle of the convergence domain (see figure 1 for an illustration).\nProof . Starting from (2.3), we seek solutions of the form Ek = CEk\u2212x\u22a5 |k\u2016|\u2212y and introduce the dimensionless variables p\u0303\u22a5 = p\u22a5k\u22121\u22a5 , q\u0303\u22a5 = q\u22a5k\u22121\u22a5 , p\u0303\u2016 = p\u2016k\u22121\u2016 and q\u0303\u2016 = q\u2016k\u22121\u2016 .

We see that for I\u22a5 the integrand is always positive, while for I\u2016 the integrand can be either positive or negative depending on the perpendicular wavenumbers (for the largest perpendicular wavenumbers it is always positive), but, overall, the positive sign dominates in the sense that I\u2016 > 0. Therefore, the parallel cascade is also direct but it is composed of different contributions, with some triadic interactions contributing to an inverse cascade.\nThe energy flux being mostly perpendicular, we consider only the first line of (3.4), from which we deduce the expression of CE.

            "text": "In this article, we first derive the locality conditions for inertial wave turbulence and verify that the anisotropic KZ spectrum \u2013 which is an exact stationary solution of the problem \u2013 satisfies these conditions. The locality of the solution ensures: (i) the finiteness of the associated flux; and (ii) the existence of an inertial range independent of large and small scales where forcing and dissipation can occur. Next, neglecting the parallel energy flux, we provide an estimate of the Kolmogorov constant that could be verified by direct numerical simulation or experimentally. Our study completes that carried out by Galtier (2003) and provides theoretical support for recent numerical and experimental studies where energy spectra consistent with the prediction of inertial wave turbulence theory have been reported (Le Reun et al. 2020; Monsalve et al. 2020; Yokoyama & Takaoka 2021).\nAlthough the parallel energy flux is positive (like the perpendicular flux), we show numerically that it is in fact the sum of positive and negative contributions. In other words, in the parallel direction, we have triadic interactions that lead to both direct and inverse transfers, with an overall direct cascade. This observation gives some support to experimental results (Morize et al. 2005) showing that the dynamics along the axis of rotation is more difficult to identify than the transverse one, as they exhibit inverse cascade signatures. The presence of an inverse cascade in rotating turbulence is often interpreted as the interaction between the slow mode (i.e. the fluctuations at k\u2016 = 0) and inertial waves (Smith & Waleffe 1999). However, in our case the dynamics of the slow mode is not described by the kinetic equation and the observation made is based solely on the dynamics of inertial wave turbulence.\nThe theory of inertial wave turbulence was originally developed for energy and helicity for which two coupled kinetic equations were derived (Galtier 2003). Here, helicity is neglected for several reasons. First, it simplifies the mathematical analysis and the physical interpretation. Secondly, in the presence of helicity, we cannot derive the Kolmogorov constant because it involves two terms, even if we neglect the parallel flux. Thirdly, numerical simulations are often performed initially without helicity (Bellet et al. 2006). Some helicity may, of course, be produced, but it does not usually change the overall dynamics very much. Fourthly, the study with helicity shows that only the state of maximal helicity can give a KZ spectrum, but this situation is not natural, as the system quickly breaks this initial assumption, unless it is maintained artificially (Biferale, Musacchio & Toschi 2012).\nThe locality of the KZ spectrum gives some support to the limit of super-local interactions sometimes taken to simplify the study of wave turbulence. Under this limit, a nonlinear diffusion equation is found analytically with which the numerical study becomes much easier (Galtier & David 2020). Interestingly, it was shown with this model that the non-stationary solution exhibits a \u223c k\u22128/3\u22a5 spectrum, which is understood as a self-similar solution of the second kind, before forming \u2013 as expected \u2013 the KZ stationary spectrum after a bounce at small scales. Note that this diffusion equation is similar to that derived in plasma physics to study solar wind turbulence (David & Galtier 2019), which opens the door to laboratory analysis of space plasmas.\nDeclaration of interests.
