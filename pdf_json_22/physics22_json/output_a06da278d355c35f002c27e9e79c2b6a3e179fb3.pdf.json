Whereas theory predicts these insulators to be intervalley coherent excitonic phases, the measured gaps are routinely much smaller than theoretical estimates. We explore the effects of random strain variations on the intervalley coherent phase, which have a pair-breaking effect analogous to magnetic disorder in superconductors. We find that the spectral gap may be strongly suppressed by strain disorder, or vanish altogether, even as intervalley coherence is maintained. We discuss predicted features of the tunneling density of states, show that the activation gap measured in transport experiments corresponds to the diminished gap, and thus offer a solution for the apparent discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental gaps.\nIntroduction.\u2014In recent years, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) [1] has emerged as an exciting and versatile platform for strong-correlation physics. Its rich phase diagram prominently features correlated insulators, Chern insulators, superconductivity, and strange metallicity [2\u201312].\nCorrelated insulators consistently found at fillings \u03bd = \u00b12 electrons per moire\u0301 unit cell relative to charge neutrality (CN), and more rarely at CN, have been suggested to originate from Kramers intervalley-coherent order (K-IVC) [13\u201316]. The K-IVC phase is in some sense analogous to a superconductor, with the condensate made up of intervalley electronholes pairs. Interestingly, theoretical predictions of the KIVC gap energy, by both Hartree-Fock and numerically exact methods, overestimate the measured activation gap of \u223c O (1 meV) [2, 4\u20136, 9] by more than an order of magnitude.\nIt has been experimentally well-established that the moire\u0301 lattice formed in realistic MATBG devices is not pristine, presumably due to substantial relaxation effects of the underlying graphene lattice [17]. Disorder in the local twist angle between the graphene layers has been observed [7, 18], leading to domains with slightly different effective moire\u0301 unitcell sizes. Local measurements have also shown significant strain effects, consistent with a moire\u0301 lattice distortion of 0.1%\u2212 0.7% [19\u201321].\nAs the two graphene layers may be subjected to different strain fields, the strain tensor applied to the bilayer is comprised of a layer-symmetric part (homostrain) and a layerantisymmetric contribution (heterostrain). Uniform heterostrain was suggested to have an important role in weakening the even-filling correlated insulator states in MATBG [13, 22]. This is mainly due to a large increase of the flat-bands bandwidth [23, 24], leading to diminished effective interactions.\nWhereas heterostrain shifts the two Dirac points within each valley with respect to each other, homostrain subjects both layers to identical distortions and mainly acts as a pseudo-gauge field. This field acts oppositely in the two valleys (as illustrated in Fig. 1a), thus maintaining time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In this manuscript, we explore the effects of spatially random homostrain (Fig. 1b) on the properties of the K-IVC phase. We show that this perturbation induces \u201cpair-\nbreaking\u201d effects in striking resemblance to magnetic impurities in spin-singlet superconductors. Effects of other types of strain on the K-IVC phase are discussed in the supplementary materials (SM) [25], and various disorder perturbations are classified by their impact on this phase in Ref. [26].\nWe find that modest strain fluctuations reduces both the KIVC order parameter and the spectral gap, but enable the two to be dramatically different from one another. We propose that this effect may be responsible for the surprisingly small activation gap observed in transport experiments. Moreover, we show that intervalley coherence can persist even when the system becomes gapless to single-particle excitations, a phase that we dub \u201cgapless K-IVC\u201d. This phase could explain the haphazard appearance of a correlated insulator at CN.\nModel.\u2014We consider the following simplified spinless model of MATBG,\nH0 = \u2211 k \u03a8\u2020k [ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z + uky\u03c3y] \u03a8k, (1)\nwhere \u03a8\u2020k is an 8-spinor of fermionic annihilation operators at\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n03 65\n5v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n1 4\nFe b\n20 23\n2 momentum k relative to their respective origin in momentum space, and with sublattice, valley, and \u201dmini-valley\u201d degrees of freedom, described by Pauli matrices \u03c3i, \u03c4i, and \u03c1i, respectively. This model features four Dirac cones with linear dispersion k = \u00b1u |k|. H0 preserves the TRS T = \u03c4x\u03c1xK (K implements complex conjugation), with T 2 = 1.\nThe spinless model effectively describes the fillings \u03bd = \u00b12, where two electronic flavors of opposite valleys are entirely filled or empty, while the remaining pair is \u201cactive\u201d and forms intervalley coherence. Conversely, two copies of our spinless model may be used describe the K-IVC phase at CN [13\u201316].\nWe introduce local density-density repulsive interactions,\nHint = U\n2\u2126 \u2211 k,k\u2032,q \u03a8\u2020k+q\u03a8k\u03a8 \u2020 k\u2032\u2212q\u03a8k\u2032 , (2)\nwhich induce spontaneous symmetry-breaking in our model on a mean-field level. (\u2126 is the system area.) This simplified form of Hint suffices to illustrate the phenomenon we are interested in. Specifically, we examine the K-IVC phase, which has been argued to be the likely ground state of MATBG at even fillings. The K-IVC state is characterized by intervalley coherence, i.e., formation of an exciton condensate with intervalley electron-hole pairs, a finite gap to charge excitations, and TRS breaking. The corresponding mean-field Hamiltonian at a given k has the form\nhMF (k) = u (kx\u03c3x\u03c4z + ky\u03c3y) + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z. (3)\nhMF preserves a Kramers-like TRS, T \u2032 = \u03c4y\u03c1xK, which concatenates T with a valley rotation. It also preserves chiral and particle-hole symmetries, represented by S = \u03c3z and C = ST \u2032, respectively [27] .\nWe now introduce random homostrain variations, which enter the model as a random gauge field acting in opposite directions in opposite valleys, see Fig. 1b. Concretely, the strain Hamiltonian may be written as\nHstr = u \u222b dr\u03a8\u2020 (r) [Ax (r)\u03c3x +Ay (r)\u03c3y\u03c4z] \u03a8 (r) , (4)\nwhere A is the strain-induced perturbation, and \u03a8 (r) = 1\u221a \u2126 \u2211 k e\nik\u00b7r\u03a8k. In Eq. (4) we have implicitly assumed that the strain potential is smooth on the moire\u0301 length scale. Otherwise one should replace the renormalized velocity u by the much larger bare graphene Fermi velocity vF . Notice that uniform strain constitutes a shift of k in H0 [28] and redefines the momentum connecting the two valleys Q = K\u2212K\u2032. This only changes the momentum carried by the condensed electron-hole K-IVC pairs, so that we can assumeAi has zero spatial mean.\nThe perturbation in Eq. (4) does not break any of the symmetries of hMF. However, as we will show below (see also Ref. [26]), the fact that it commutes with the K-IVC operator \u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z , enables a drastic reduction of the gap which opens in the K-IVC spectrum due to the random strain disorder. For\nthis reason, we have also neglected inter-minivalley scattering, which have additional \u03c1x, \u03c1y factors, and thus anticommute with the order parameter.\nConsidering a simple point-like perturbation, A (r) = A0\u03b4 (r), one may employ a T -matrix formalism to find the bound-state spectrum inside the mean-field gap [25], in analogy to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states induced by magnetic impurities in a superconductor [29\u201331]. We find that as the perturbation strength increases, the in-gap-state energy is reduced and the two bound-state energies cross at zero when the impurity strength becomes an appreciable fraction of the bandwidthW .\nMoreover, we find that when approximating the density-ofstates (DOS) as a constant around the Fermi level (rather than linear as appropriate in our case), one recovers \u2013 apart from additional degeneracies \u2013 precisely the bound-state spectrum of a magnetic impurity inside a singlet superconductor. This outcome may be traced to the analogous algebraic structure of the two problems, i.e., the impurity operator commuting with the order parameter. This analogy enables the treatment of random strain fluctuations in MATBG by tools similar to those employed in superconductors with magnetic impurities.\nAbrikosov-Gor\u2019kov approach.\u2014We therefore treat the random strain fluctuations within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA), inspired by the Abrikosov-Gor\u2019kov theory of superconductivity in magnetically disordered alloys [32]. A similar method was also used to study exciton condensates in the presence of potential impurities [33, 34].\nThe main object of interest is the Green\u2019s function, G (k, \u03c9) = ( i\u03c9 \u2212 hMF \u2212 \u03a3\u0302SCBA )\u22121 . (5)\nWithin the SCBA, the self-energy matrix \u03a3\u0302SCBA can be written as\n\u03a3\u0302SCBA (k, \u03c9) = \u2329\u2211 p Uk\u2212pG (p, \u03c9)Up\u2212k \u232a dis. , (6)\nwhere the matrix U represents the random strain perturbation in momentum space, Hstr = \u2211 kq \u03a8 \u2020 k+qUq\u03a8k, and \u3008...\u3009dis. stands for disorder averaging. Upon standard manipulation of the Green\u2019s function, it can be written as\nG = \u2212 i\u03c9\u0303 + u (kx\u03c3x\u03c4z + ky\u03c3y) + \u2206\u0303\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z 2k + \u2206\u0303 2 + \u03c9\u03032 . (7)\nThe parameters \u03c9\u0303, \u2206\u0303 are related to \u03c9,\u2206ivc by the selfconsistency equations(\n\u03c9\u0303\n\u2206\u0303\n) = ( \u03c9\n\u2206ivc\n) + \u0393F ( \u03c9\u0303, \u2206\u0303 )( \u03c9\u0303 \u2212\u2206\u0303 ) , (8)\nwhere F ( \u03c9\u0303, \u2206\u0303 ) = W2 \u222b d N ( ) 2+\u2206\u03032+\u03c9\u03032\n, N ( ) is the DOS per unit cell of area \u2126u.c., and W is the bandwidth. The disorder energy scale \u0393 is\n\u0393 = 2\u2126\nW\u2126u.c.\n\u2329\u222b d\u03b8u2A\u2020\u03b8 \u00b7A\u03b8 \u232a dis. , (9)\n3 where Aq is the Fourier transform of A (r), and we have used the standard approximation that the scattering mostly depends on the angle between incoming and outgoing momenta \u03b8 [33, 34]. As for magnetic impurities in superconductors and potential scatterers in excitonic condensates, the form of Eq. (8) is due to the K-IVC order parameter commuting with the random perturbation. Thus, the equations we find are identical to the Abrikosov-Gor\u2019kov equations for superconductors with magnetic impurities, with one important difference. In MATBG, we cannot assume a constant DOS near the Fermi energy, but should account for the fact that the DOS vanishes linearly at the Dirac point. This leads to important qualitative differences in the results.\nBy relating the local strain to the effective gauge-field A, one may obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of \u0393. For rootmean-square strains of E \u223c 0.1% and disorder correlation lengths of few unit cells, we find \u0393/W values of 0.1\u22120.3 [25]. As will be shown, such values are sufficient to dramatically reduce the spectral gap or even close it completely.\nThe strength of K-IVC order in the presence of disorder is obtained by combining Eq. (8) with the gap equation\n\u2206ivc = \u22122 U\n\u03b2\u2126 \u2211 \u03c9k Tr {\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1zG} , (10)\nwhich we solve numerically. (Here, \u03b2 is inverse temperature.) Figure 2a shows results for the order parameter \u2206ivc as a function of temperature and disorder. We find that both the order parameter and the critical temperature deteriorate with increasing disorder.\nWhen assuming a DOS which is linear in energy, Nlin. = 4 | | /W 2 with cutoff energy | | < W/2, we can also make analytical progress. In particular, we may calculate the critical disorder scale \u0393c, at which \u2206ivc vanishes for T = 0. In the regime \u0393c W/2, we find [25]\n\u0393c = Uc\nlog 8\n( 1\u2212 Uc\nU\n) , (11)\nwhere Uc = W/4 is the critical interaction U below which the K-IVC order vanishes at \u0393, T = 0. The finite Uc as well as the form of the critical \u201cpair-breaking\u201d parameter \u0393c originate in the DOS vanishing linearly at zero. This suppresses the analog of the Cooper-instability for arbitrarily weak interactions, which requires a finite DOS at the Fermi level.\nHaving found the self-consistent Green\u2019s function, we can calculate the tunneling density of states (TDOS) N\u0303 ( ) = 1 \u03c0 Im 1 \u2126 \u2211 k TrG (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i ). In clean systems, the gap \u03c9g in the TDOS is equal to the order parameter \u2206ivc. In the presence of finite disorder \u0393, \u03c9g is in general smaller than \u2206ivc.\nIn Fig. 2b, we plot the ratio \u03c9g/\u2206ivc for the same parameter range as in Fig. 2a. As \u0393 increases, the ratio gradually deviates from unity, and eventually reaches zero, before \u2206ivc vanishes. We dub the regime with finite \u2206ivc and vanishing \u03c9g as the gapless K-IVC phase. Similar to gapless superconductivity, we interpret this regime as one where intervalley coherence exists throughout a large fraction of the system, yet\nFIG. 2. (a) The order parameter \u2206ivc as a function of temperature and disorder energy scale \u0393. For a given temperature, there is a critical \u0393 at which the order parameter vanishes. (b) The ratio between the gap in the TDOS, \u03c9g , and \u2206ivc. As \u0393 increases, \u03c9g deviates from \u2206ivc appreciably. There exists a gapless K-IVC region bounded by the vanishing of the single-particle gap (black dashed line) and of the order parameter (blue dashed line). We used U = 0.7W and a linear DOS Nlin.. (c) Linecuts for different values of \u0393 showing \u2206ivc (solid) and \u03c9g (dash-dotted).\nstrain-induced in-gap states form a low-energy compressible continuum of states. For linear DOS, we find that the disorder strength at which the gap closes is related to \u2206ivc [25] through\n\u0393g = W/ log ( 1 + W 2\n\u22062ivc\n)2 .\nIn Fig. 2c, we plot linecuts of Fig. 2a for several values of \u0393. We find that even for modest (and realistic) disorder strengths, the spectral gap is significantly suppressed compared to the naive gap as given by the order parameter. Thus, devices which host appreciable strain fluctuations may exhibit an effective gap as seen in a global transport measurement, which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the expected condensation order parameter.\nIn Fig. 3 we track the evolution of the TDOS with disorder strength. At very low \u0393 we find two narrow K-IVC bands separated by roughly 2\u2206ivc, as expected from previous theoretical investigations of the pristine K-IVC phase. As the disorder strength \u0393 increases, these bands spread out in energy, and their separation diminishes. As shown in the figure, this is very different from the behavior of \u2206ivc. While \u03c9g diminishes already for weak disorder, \u2206ivc remains mostly unaffected up to intermediate values of \u0393.\nThe TDOS depicted in Fig. 3 can be measured in planar tunneling junctions with a large tunneling area, similar to the experimental verification of gapless superconduc-\n4\ntivity [35]. The large tunneling area is required for effective averaging over disorder configurations in a particular device. Such measurements are expected to show two spread-out TDOS lobes, with centers separated by\u223c 2\u2206ivc and a spectral gap of 2\u03c9g < 2\u2206ivc. In contrast, local scanning-tunnelingmicroscopy (STM) measurements do not reveal disorderaveraged quantities, yet we expect the tunneling gap to vary as a function of position, in a manner correlated with the homostrain variations. Such phenomenology would be a clear indicator of the proposed disordered K-IVC phase.\nTo make contact with transport experiments, we now turn to calculating the DC conductivity within our model. We use the Kubo-Bastin formula [36], \u03c3xx \u221d \u222b d ( \u2212dfd ) S ( ), where f\nis the Fermi function, and\nS ( ) \u2248 1 \u2126 \u2211 k Tr {jxImG (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i ) jxImG (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i )}\n(12) is the conductivity kernel. The current operator is jx = u\u03c3x\u03c4z . Equation (12) neglects vertex corrections to jx, which may have quantitative significance, but are beyond the scope of this work.\nFig. 4 presents Arrhenius plots of the conductivity for different \u0393 values. From these plots, we can extract the activation energy Eact by fitting the longitudinal conductivity to \u03c3xx \u221d exp (\u2212Eact/T ). Remarkably, we observe that the lowT behavior is indeed temperature activated with Eact \u2248 \u03c9g , and not the potentially much larger \u2206ivc. (In the topmost plot of Fig. 4 \u2206ivc \u2248 5.4\u03c9g .) This behavior can be traced to the analytic structure of S ( ), which has a gap \u2248 2\u03c9g around = 0 [25], similar to the TDOS.\nConclusions.\u2014We have explored the consequences of random homostrain fluctuations on the K-IVC state, believed to describe the insulating phases of MATBG at even fillings. Using a simplified model for MATBG, we have studied this problem using the SCBA in conjunction with a mean-field treatment of the K-IVC order parameter. Homostrain disorder has a pair-breaking effect on the intervalley coherent condensate, since it locally acts on the two valleys in opposite ways.\nIn contrast to similar pair-breaking disorder problems, random homostrain does not break any symmetries of the K-IVC state. However, it does lead to in-gap states, gap closing, and order parameter deterioration due to its operator structure \u2013 it commutes with the order parameter. Moreover, the DOS dependence on energy had to be taken into account, since it vanishes at the Dirac point. This led to the unique form of the solutions of the Abrikosov-Gor\u2019kov equations which we derive, and of the critical pair-breaking parameter \u0393c.\nOne of our key results is the significant separation between the energy scales of the K-IVC order (\u2206ivc) and the spectral gap for single-particle excitations (\u03c9g), even for modest values of disorder. Borrowing insights from superconductors, the gap reduction stems from in-gap bound states, which become stronger and more abundant with increasing \u0393, yet impact the surrounding intervalley-coherent condensate only weakly.\nWe suggest that the order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the theorized K-IVC gap and the activation gap measured in transport experiments can be resolved within our model. We have demonstrated that the relevant activation energy as measured via the DC conductivity is the spectral gap, which may be considerably smaller than the order parameter due to disorder. (Both scales coincide in the pristine case). The rare appearance of insulators at CN can also be understood by considering two copies of our model with different spin labels. Variations of the magnitude of strain disorder between devices may tip the state at CN from a weaklyinsulating K-IVC state to the gapless K-IVC regime. The relative weakness of the insulating state at CN compared to fillings \u03bd = \u00b12 has been attributed to bandwidth renormal-\n5 izations [37\u201339], rendering the effective interactions stronger away from CN.\nThe interplay of strain fluctuations with other sources of K-IVC suppression, such as twist-angle disorder and uniform heterostrain, remains to be explored. Additionally, the fact that the considered disorder couples only to intervalleyordered states may also be important. This may have ramifications for the competition between the K-IVC state and other correlated insulating phases, such as the valley-Hall phase, for which the order parameter \u221d \u03c3z anticommutes with the strain fluctuations. Incorporating such complications, as well as including more intricate aspects of the (particle-hole asymmetric) band structure will shed much-needed light on the nature of the insulating phases in MATBG and their variation between different devices.\nWe gratefully acknowledge funding by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through CRC 183 (project C02; YO and FvO), a joint ANR-DFG project (TWISTGRAPH; CM and FvO), the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant Agreement LEGOTOP No. 788715; YO), the ISF Quantum Science and Technology program (2074/19; YO), and a BSF and NSF grant (2018643; YO).\n[1] R.

One may apply a spatially-dependent displacement field to the carbon atoms of each layer, u\u03b1displacement (`, r). Here, r is the position of the displaced carbon atom, ` = t,b corresponds to either the top or bottom layer, and \u03b1 = x, y is the axis along which the atom is displaced.\nWe then define the strain tensor\n`\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2202\u03b1u\n\u03b2 displacement (`, r) + \u2202\u03b2u \u03b1 displacement (`, r)\n2 . (S1)\nThe homostrain and heterostrain tensor are now simply the layer-symmetric and antisymmetric components of `\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nhomo\u03b1\u03b2 = t\u03b1\u03b2 + b \u03b1\u03b2\n2 , (S2)\nhetero\u03b1\u03b2 = t\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 b\u03b1\u03b2\n2 , (S3)\nand one therefore expects both components to exist for a generic random strain field configuration.\nUniform strain\nUniform heterostrain.\u2014The effects of uniform heterostrain on both the band structure of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and on the correlated insulator appearing at even fillings of electron/holes per moire\u0301 unit-cell have been considered in Refs. [13, 22\u201324]. The main notable effect of this perturbation is the distortion of the moire\u0301 superlattice, leading to a significant increase of the flat-bands\u2019 bandwidth. This then leads to weakening of the correlated insulator, due to an effective weaker interaction (as compared to the bandwidth of the electrons).\nUniform homostrain.\u2014Uniform strain which is applied identically to both graphene layers will shift the band structure in the two valleys in opposite directions in momentum space [28],\nK\u2192 K + A, K\u2032 \u2192 K\u2032 \u2212A, (S4)\nwhere K,K\u2032 are the two monolayer graphene valleys and A is the pseudo-gauge field. Assuming electron-electron interactions which are weakly dependent on momentum, consider a spontaneous intervalleycoherent order parameter, which has an oscillatory spatial dependence \u2206ivc (r) \u221d exp (iQ \u00b7 r) in the absence of strain, with Q = K \u2212 K\u2032 the intervalley separation. Then, applying uniform homostrain would have no effect on the instability towards the intervalley order, though the \u201cnew\u201d order parameter will now have a slightly different spatial periodicity, \u2206ivc (r) \u221d exp [i (Q + 2A) \u00b7 r]. We therefore do not include this type of perturbation in our considerations in this work.\nStrain disorder\nLet us now discuss the effects of the disordered strain potentials within our effective model. As a reminder, its mean-field form is\nhMF (k) = u (kx\u03c3x\u03c4z + ky\u03c3y) + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z, (S5)\nwhere sublattice, valley, and \u201dmini-valley\u201d degrees of freedom are described by Pauli matrices \u03c3i, \u03c4i, and \u03c1i, respectively.\n7 In this language, homostrain disorder is proportional to the operators \u03c3x, \u03c3y\u03c4z , or a linear combination of the two. Therefore, the homostrain operator commutes with the order parameter \u221d \u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z . This fact is crucial for allowing this disorder term to close the gap induced by the intervalley order parameter, as we discuss throughout this work.\nHeterostrain disorder however, is proportional to the operators \u03c3x\u03c4z\u03c1z , \u03c3y\u03c1z and their combinations. One easy way to understand why, is to recognize that the same mini-valley in opposite valleys originates in the Dirac points corresponding to opposite layers. Therefore, when it comes to response to a strain potential, the operator \u03c4z\u03c1z effectively acts as an \u201coriginatinglayer\u201d index. Heterostrain operators are then naturally given by multiplying the homostrain operators by \u03c4z\u03c1z , enforcing opposite pseudo-gauge fields in opposite layers.\nImportantly, the heterostrain operators anticommute with the intervalley-coherent order parameter, so that the gap cannot be closed by weak disorder of that kind. Their effect is thus analogous to that of non-magnetic charge impurities in conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Therefore, we do not consider this type of disorder in this work.\nMEAN-FIELD RESULTS IN THE PRISTINE CASE\nLet us briefly discuss the model\nH = H0 +Hint, (S6)\nH0 = \u2211 k \u03a8\u2020k [ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z + uky\u03c3y] \u03a8k, (S7)\nHint = U\n2\u2126 \u2211 k,k\u2032,q \u03a8\u2020k+q\u03a8k\u03a8 \u2020 k\u2032\u2212q\u03a8k\u2032 . (S8)\n\u03a8\u2020k is an 8-spinor of fermionic annihilation operators at momentum k relative to their respective origin in momentum space, and with sublattice, valley, and \u201dmini-valley\u201d degrees of freedom, described by Pauli matrices \u03c3i, \u03c4i, and \u03c1i, respectively.\nWe note that the basis used in this model is quite different from the commonly used \u201csublattice basis\u201d (see, e.g., Refs. [13, 15]), since we effectively separate the electronic species in each valley into two species near the two Dirac cones in each valley. In this case, the momentum k is measured relative to the appropriate Dirac point labeled by both the quantum numbers \u03c4z and \u03c1z . As we show momentarily, this also translates to a different form of the intervalley-coherent order parameter.\nOur model is meant to provide an effective description of the physics near \u03bd = \u00b12 filling in MATBG. It is widely believed that in these regimes, the flavor (spin and valley) symmetry is spontaneously broken due to strong electron-electron interactions [7, 8]. Consequently, two flavors are either completely full or completely empty, whereas the remaining two flavors have their chemical potential at the Dirac point. Eq. (S7) describes precisely the two remaining active flavors in this scenario.\nWe are interested in the order parameter\n\u2206ivc = \u2212 U\n2\u2126 \u2211 k \u2329 \u03a8\u2020 (k)\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z\u03a8 (k) \u232a (S9)\nfor Kramers intervalley-coherent (K-IVC) order. We note that \u2206ivc spontaneously breaks the valley-U (1) symmetry in our model, manifested in \u03c4x \u2192 \u03c4xei\u03b1valley\u03c4z .\nPerforming a mean-field decomposition on the Hamiltonian, we find\nHMF = \u2211 k \u03a8\u2020 (k) [ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z + uky\u03c3y + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z] \u03a8 (k) + 2 \u2126 U \u22062ivc. (S10)\nImportantly, the order parameter \u2206ivc is the only possible K-IVC order parameter (up to a rotation in the \u03c4x\u2013\u03c4y plane), i.e., it fulfills the three conditions: (i) it is valley off-diagonal, (ii) it opens a gap in the spectrum (anti-commutes with H0), and (iii) it breaks the time-reversal symmetry T = \u03c4x\u03c1xK, while preserving the Kramers one T \u2032 = \u03c4y\u03c1xK (K is the complex conjugation operator).\nDefining k = u |k|, Ek = \u221a 2k + \u2206 2 ivc, we find the mean-field thermodynamic potential \u03a6 at temperature T ,\n\u03a6 = 2 \u2126\nU \u22062ivc \u2212 8T \u2211 k log [ 2 cosh ( Ek 2T )] . (S11)\n8 The self-consistent gap equation follows from the condition \u2202\u03a6\u2202\u2206ivc = 0, which leads to\n1 U =\n\u222b d N ( ) tanh\n(\u221a 2+\u22062ivc\n2T ) \u221a 2 + \u22062ivc , (S12)\nwhere N ( ) is the density of states per unit cell and flavor (spin, valley, minivalley) of H0 at energy . We may extract some analytical results by assuming a strictly linear density of states,\nN ( ) = { 4| | W 2 | | < W/2, 0 otherwise,\n(S13)\nwith W the total bandwidth. Setting T = 0, we find\n\u220600 = \u2206ivc (T = 0) = U\n[ 1\u2212 ( Uc U )2] . (S14)\nHere, we have defined the critical interaction strength Uc = W/4, below which there is no gap opening. The existence of a critical coupling contrasts with the familiar behavior of the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) gap equation, which has the same form as Eq. (S12). The difference originates from the density of states N ( ). In the present case, the density of states vanishes at the Dirac point ( = 0), which eliminates the Cooper instability for infinitesimally weak interaction strengths.\nWe may also extract the critical temperature Tc0 by setting \u2206ivc = 0 in the gap equation. This leads to the transcendental equation\nUc U = Tc0 Uc log\n[ cosh ( Uc Tc0 )] , (S15)\nwhich does not have a Tc0 > 0 solution for U < Uc, as expected. Close to the transition, when Tc0 Uc, we may approximate Tc0 \u2248 1log 2 Uc U (U \u2212 Uc).\nPOINT-LIKE PERTURBATION\nIn this section, we analyze the effect of a localized strain \u201cimpurity\u201d on the mean-field K-IVC state. We assume that the strain does not suppress the formation of intervalley coherent order for the sake of this discussion. Thus, we investigate the Hamiltonian\nHimp = \u2211 k \u03a8\u2020k [ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z + uky\u03c3y + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z] \u03a8k\n+ 1\n\u2126 \u2211 k,k\u2032 \u03a8\u2020k [vFAx\u03c3x + vFAy\u03c3y\u03c4z] \u03a8k\u2032 , (S16)\nwhere Ax,y are constants, reflecting the delta-potential like spatial dependence of A (r), to be determined by the strain tensor, see Eq. (S40). Notice that the velocity in this impurity strain potential is the bare Fermi velocity of graphene vF , and not the renormalized one u. This is because the deformed potential is not smooth on the moire\u0301 scale, as we have assumed it is pointlike by definition. We note that much like in the case of the strain perturbation we consider in the main text, Himp preserves both T and T \u2032 time-reversal symmetries.\nThe Green\u2019s function for the Ax,y = 0 system can be written as\nG0 (k, \u03c9) = \u2212\u03c9 + ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z + uky\u03c3y + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z 2k + \u2206 2 ivc \u2212 \u03c92 , (S17)\nwith k = u |k|. We also calculate\ng0 (\u03c9) \u2261 1 \u2126 \u2211 k G0 (k, \u03c9) = \u2212 (\u03c9 + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z)C, (S18)\nC = \u222b d\nN ( ) 2 + \u22062ivc \u2212 \u03c92 , (S19)\nwhich we will use momentarily.\n9 T -matrix formalism\nOur goal is to find the in-gap bound state spectrum due to the strain perturbation. In order to do so, we shall employ the T -matrix formalism [40, 43]. Within this formalism, in the case of a point-like perturbation at the origin, the real-space Green\u2019s function may be written as\nG (r, r\u2032;\u03c9) = G0 (r, r\u2032;\u03c9) +G0 (r,0;\u03c9)T (\u03c9)G0 (0, r\u2032;\u03c9) , (S20)\nwith G0 (r, r\u2032;\u03c9) the unperturbed Green\u2019s function and the T -matrix\nT (\u03c9) = U0\n1\u2212 U0g0 (\u03c9) .

The eigenvalues of Q are\n\u03bbQ = 1\u00b1 vFAC (\u2206ivc \u00b1 \u03c9) , (S23)\nwith A = \u221a A2x +A2y . Each of these four eigenvalues is doubly degenerate. Notice the particle-hole symmetry. If \u03c9\u2217 makes one eigenvalue go to zero, then \u2212\u03c9\u2217 makes another eigenvalue go to zero as well. In order to make further progress, we must address C, which is not a constant, but rather a function of \u03c9 and \u2206ivc.\nLinear-in- density of states\nUsing the linear density of states we employed in Eq. (S13), we find\nC = 1\n(W/2) 2 log\n[ 1 + (W/2) 2\n\u22062ivc \u2212 \u03c92\n] .

This is given by A0,\nvFA0 W/2 = W/2\n\u2206ivc\n1\nlog [ 1 + ( W/2 \u2206ivc )2] . (S25) Additionally, it is interesting to find the behavior of the in-gap state at very small strain, vFA W .

This behavior can indeed be seen in Fig. S1 at small A.\nConstant density of states\nIn order to shed some light on the results of the last section, as well as to further facilitate the comparison to a magnetic impurity embedded in a singlet superconductor, let us repeat the calculation with a constant density of states, N ( ) = N0. In this case,\nC = \u03c0N0\u221a\n\u22062ivc \u2212 \u03c92 . (S27)\n10\nFIG. S1. Bound state spectrum of the strain impurity problem. The two branches of the spectrum appear in blue and red, showing the particle-hole symmetry. Each of the branches is doubly degenerate, reflecting the Kramers-like time-reversal symmetry T \u2032 of the Hamiltonian, even in the presence of the strain perturbation. For this plot we used \u2206ivc = W/5.\nThe bound state spectrum is thus given by\n\u03c9 = \u00b1\u2206ivc 1\u2212 s2\n1 + s2 , (S28)\nwith the dimensionless impurity strength s = \u03c0N0vFA. It is worth mentioning that the result of Eq. (S28) is identical to the bound state energies of in-gap states induced in a singlet superconductor in the presence of a magnetic impurities, see, e.g., Ref. [41]. Thus, although the perturbation breaks no symmetries of the mean-field Hamiltonian, due to its matrix form which commutes with the order parameter \u2013 an in-gap state (which may eventually reach all the way to zero energy) becomes possible.\nDETAILS OF THE ABRIKOSOV-GORKOV CALCULATIONS\nCalculations in this section closely resemble the techniques used to treat magnetic impurities in singlet superconductors [32, 42] and excitonic condensation in semiconductors [33] and graphene [34]. We combine self-consistent mean-field calculations for the order parameter \u2206ivc, together with a self-consistent Born approximation, which allows us to handle the random strain fluctuations.\nThe key player in this treatment of the problem is the Green\u2019s function, which satisfies (within the mean-field approximation)\nG (k, \u03c9) = (i\u03c9 \u2212 hMF \u2212 \u03a3SCBA)\u22121 , (S29)\nwith the mean-field Hamiltonian\nhMF = u (kx\u03c3x\u03c4z + ky\u03c3y) + \u2206ivc\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z. (S30)\nWithin the self-consistent Born approximation, the self-energy is given by\n\u03a3SCBA (k, \u03c9) = \u2329 \u2211 |p|<\u039bc Uk\u2212pG (p, \u03c9)Up\u2212k \u232a disorder\n(S31)\nwhere the matrix U represents the random strain perturbation in momentum space, Hstr = \u2211 kq \u03a8 \u2020 k+qUq\u03a8k, and \u3008...\u3009disorder stands for averaging over disorder configurations. Notice that Eq. (S31) contains within it the full Green\u2019s function, such that Eq. (S29) and Eq. (S31) must be solved together self-consistently.\nThe strain operator has the form\nUq = u (Ax,q\u03c3x +Ay,q\u03c3y\u03c4z) . (S32)\n11\nAssuming the disorder averaging eliminates any anisotropy introduced by a specific disorder configuration, we may assume\u2329 A\u2217x,qAy,q \u232a disorder = \u2329 A\u2217y,qAx,q \u232a disorder = 0, and \u2329 A\u2217x,qAx,q \u2212A\u2217y,qAy,q \u232a disorder\n= 0. Using the fact that the real-space strain perturbation is real, we have Ai,\u2212q = A\u2217i,q. Employing the ansatz,\nGSCBA (k, \u03c9) = ( i\u03c9\u0303 \u2212 ukx\u03c3x\u03c4z \u2212 uky\u03c3y \u2212 \u2206\u0303\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z )\u22121 , (S33)\nthe self-energy takes the form\n\u03a3SCBA (k, \u03c9)\u2212 = \u2329\u2211 p \u2223\u2223\u2223u ~Ap\u2212q\u2223\u2223\u22232 i\u03c9\u0303 + \u2206\u0303\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1z 2p + \u2206\u0303 2 + \u03c9\u03032 \u232a disorder . (S34)\nFor simplicity, we now make the standard assumption that the disorder potential ~Ap\u2212q depends mostly on the relative angle between the initial and final momenta, i.e., ~Ap\u2212q \u2248 ~A\u03b8, where the angle is defined by tan \u03b8 = py\u2212qypx\u2212qx . This assumption is due to the singularity of the Green\u2019s function at the Fermi level, such that the main contribution in the sum appearing in Eq. (S34) is by momenta with |p| \u2248 pF , with pF the Fermi momentum. With this approximation, we find the self-consistent equations for \u03c9\u0303 and \u2206\u0303,\n\u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9 + \u03c9\u0303\u0393 W\n2\n\u222b d\nN ( ) 2 + \u2206\u03032 + \u03c9\u03032 , (S35)\n\u2206\u0303 = \u2206\u2212 \u2206\u0303\u0393W 2\n\u222b d\nN ( ) 2 + \u2206\u03032 + \u03c9\u03032 , (S36)\nwhere N ( ) is the density of states per moire\u0301 unit-cell \u2126u.c., W is the bandwidth, and the scattering rate \u0393 is\n\u0393 = 2\u2126\nW\u2126u.c.\n\u2329\u222b d\u03b8u2 ~A\u2020\u03b8 \u00b7 ~A\u03b8 \u232a disorder . (S37)\nFinally, to complete the picture, we must include the self-consistent calculation of the order parameter itself, with the gap equation\n\u2206ivc = \u22122 U\n\u03b2\u2126 \u2211 \u03c9k Tr {\u03c3x\u03c4x\u03c1zGSCBA (k, \u03c9)}\n= 2U 1\n\u03b2 \u2211 \u03c9 \u222b d N ( ) 2 + \u2206\u03032 + \u03c9\u03032 \u2206\u0303. (S38)\nEquations (S35),(S36), and (S38) form a set of closed equations that can be solved together to recover \u2206ivc and GSCBA in the presence of strain fluctuations.\nLastly, we may also calculate the tunneling density of states, given by\nN\u0303 ( ) = 1 \u03c0 Im 1 \u2126 \u2211 k TrGSCBA (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i )\n= 1\n\u03c0 Im\n\u222b d N ( ) i\u03c9\u0303\n2 + \u2206\u03032 + \u03c9\u03032 |\u03c9\u2192i . (S39)\nWhen \u2206ivc is finite, one expects to find a gap in N\u0303 ( ) near zero energy. We denote the value of this gap as \u03c9g .\nEstimating the disorder scale \u0393\nThe disorder parameter \u0393 determines completely the properties of the disorder-averaged Green\u2019s function within our SCBA treatment. Given the homostrain tensor homo\u03b1\u03b2 introduced in Eq. (S2), the effective pseudo-gauge field can be expressed as [17]\nA = \u221a 3\u03b2\na\n( homoxx \u2212 homoyy\n2 ,\u2212 homoxy\n) , (S40)\n12\nwhere a = 0.246 nm is the monolayer graphene lattice constant, and \u03b2 \u2248 3.14 is a dimensionless parameter of graphene, which quantifies the sensitivity of nearest-neighbor hopping strength to a change in their relative distance.\nAs an example, let us consider a scenario where root-mean-square strain is RMS, approximate u \u2248 0.1vF [2], and use ~vF /a \u2248 2.68eV , such that\nu |ARMS| \u2248 14.5 meV \u00d7 RMS [%] . (S41)\nIn order to continue, we examine the specific example of Gaussian correlated disorder, i.e., assume the following correlations,\n\u3008Ai (r)Aj (r\u2032)\u3009disorder = \u03b4ijA 2 RMS exp\n( \u2212|r\u2212 r \u2032|2\n2\u03be2dis.\n) , (S42)\nwhere \u03bedis. is the disorder correlation length. Following a straightforward Fourier transform, we find\n\u3008Ai (q)Aj (\u2212q)\u3009disorder = \u03b4ijA 2 RMS\n1 \u2126 \u03be2dis. exp\n( \u2212|q| 2 \u03be2dis.\n2\n) . (S43)\nSince we began with the expression in Eq. (S34), our main focus is on momenta near the Fermi level. We thus replace q \u2248 kF = 0 in our estimates below. Estimating the MATBG bandwidth as W \u2248 20 meV, and using Eq. (S37) we find\n\u0393/W \u2248 4\u03be 2 dis.\nAu.c.\n( uARMS W )2 \u2248 2.1\u00d7 ( RMS [%]\u00d7 \u03bedis. [am])2 , (S44)\nwhere am \u2248 \u221a Au.c. is the moire\u0301 lattice constant.\nFor example, for RMS = 0.1% and \u03bedis. = 3am we find \u0393/W \u2248 0.19. We can thus conclude that for appreciable yet reasonable homostrain disorder, \u0393 may indeed be large enough to diminish both \u2206ivc and \u03c9g significantly, and possibly completely close the gap in the TDOS.\nCritical disorder strength\nIf the energy scale associated with the random strain fluctuations \u0393 is sufficiently large, the K-IVC order may be completely washed away, even at zero temperature. Using the linear density of states approximation, we can recover this critical \u0393c, by setting \u2206ivc, \u2206\u0303 \u2192 0 and T = 0. We note that it is important not to set \u2206ivc = \u2206\u0303 exactly, although both quantities are taken to zero. This is because in the gap equation we must divide both sides by \u2206ivc Under these assumptions,\n\u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9 + \u0393c W/2 log\n( 1 + (W/2) 2\n\u03c9\u03032\n) \u03c9\u0303, (S45)\n\u2206\u0303 = \u2206 1 + \u0393cW/2 log ( 1 + (W/2) 2 \u03c9\u03032 ) , (S46) from which we also calculate\nd\u03c9 = d\u03c9\u0303 [ 1\u2212 \u0393c\nW/2 log\n( 1 + (W/2) 2\n\u03c9\u03032\n) + 2\u0393c\nW/2\n\u03c9\u03032 + (W/2) 2\n] . (S47)\nPlugging this relation into the zero temperature gap equation and changing variables, we find\nUc U = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx 2\u03c0 1\u2212 g log ( 1 + 1x2 ) + 2g 1x2+1 1 + g log ( 1 + 1x2 ) log(1 + 1 x2 ) , (S48)\nwhere g = 2\u0393c/W . The self-consistent Eq. (S48) relates the interaction strength U to the critical disorder strength via a dimensionless integral. For relatively weak disorder, g 1, we may expand Eq. (S48) to linear order in g, to find the relation\n\u0393 = Uc\nlog 8\n( 1\u2212 Uc\nU\n) , (S49)\nwhich is valid close for U \u2248 Uc, such that g 1.\n13\nFIG. S2. (a) The order parameter \u2206ivc as a function of interaction strength and the disorder energy scale \u0393. At a given interaction strength U , a critical \u0393 exists at which the order parameter vanishes. (b) The ratio of the gap in the TDOS, \u03c9g , to \u2206ivc. As \u0393 increases, \u03c9g deviates from \u2206ivc appreciably. Moreover, there exists a gapless K-IVC region bounded by the vanishing of the gap (black dashed line) and of the order parameter (blue dashed line). Calculations were done at zero temperature, using the linear DOSNlin..\nGapless K-IVC\nUnlike in the translation-symmetry invariant case, the gap in the tunneling density of states, 2\u03c9g , does not necessarily equal the self-consistent order parameter \u2206ivc. More concretely, there exists a regime in which \u2206ivc is finite, yet \u03c9g = 0 and the tunneling density of states is gapless.\nLet us find the disorder strength \u0393g for which this gap closes. To do so, we calculate the tunneling density of states at zero energy N\u0303 ( = 0). Plugging \u03c9 \u2192 0 in the expressions for \u03c9\u0303 and \u2206\u0303, we find\n\u03c9\u03032 = (W/2)\n2\nexp W/2\u0393 \u2212 1 \u2212 (\u2206ivc/2)2 . (S50)\nThe tunneling density of states is then given by\nN\u0303 ( = 0) = 1 2\u03c0 1 \u0393W \u00d7 Re {\u03c9\u0303\u03c9\u21920} . (S51)\nThus, the gap closes, i.e., there is a finite value of N\u0303 at zero energy, for\n\u0393 \u2265 \u0393g = W/2 log ( 1 + W 2\n\u22062ivc ) . (S52) Notice Eq. (S52) is not a closed-form expression for \u0393g , since in the right hand side \u2206ivc depends on \u0393 itself.\nIn the main text, we have shown that the gapless K-IVC regime exists over a range of temperatures and disorder strengths. For completeness, we also show how the gapless K-IVC at zero temperature evolves as a function of the repulsive interaction strength U . This is plotted in Fig. S2.\nConductivity calculations\nThe primary method by which the K-IVC gap is extracted in experiments is by derivation of the activation energy from transport measurements. Namely, the longitudinal conductivity \u03c3xx is measured as a function of temperature at the appropriate filling corresponding to the insulating phase, and fitted to \u221d exp (\u2212Eact./T ), where the activation energy Eact. presumably coincides with the K-IVC order parameter \u2206ivc.\nIn order to put our results thus far in a similar context, we employ the Kubo-Bastin formula for the dc conductivity [36], \u03c3xx \u221d \u222b d ( \u2212df d ) S ( ) , (S53)\n14\nwhere f is the Fermi function, and the kernel of the integral is\nS ( ) = 1 \u2126 \u2211 k Tr {\u3008jxImGSCBA (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i ) jxImGSCBA (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i )\u3009disorder} , (S54)\nwhere the appropriate current operator in our case is jx = \u2202kxhMF = u\u03c3x\u03c4z . The full calculation of Eq. (S54), including the so-called vertex corrections to the current operator, are beyond the scope of this work. However, qualitatively most of the disorder effects stemming from the Abrikosov-Gor\u2019kov treatment we perform may be captured by approximating\nS ( ) \u2248 1 \u2126 \u2211 k Tr {jxImGSCBA (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i ) jxImGSCBA (k, \u03c9 \u2192 i )} , (S55)\nwhere we emphasize that the Green\u2019s function GSCBA is calculated self-consistently accounting for the strain disorder. Plugging in the Green\u2019s function [Eq. (S33)], we find by a straightforward calculation that the conductivity kernel S ( ) has the following form,\nS ( ) \u2248 1 \u2126 \u2211 k\nRe (\u03c9\u0303) 2 \u2212 Im ( \u2206\u0303 )2\n( 2k + |\u03c9\u0303| 2 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u0303\u2223\u2223\u22232)2 \u2212 4 [Im(\u03c9\u0303\u2206\u0303)]2 \u2212 4 [Im (\u03c9\u0303)]2 2k\u00d7\n\u00d7 1 + 4 [Im (\u03c9\u0303)] 2 2k(\n2k + |\u03c9\u0303| 2 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2206\u0303\u2223\u2223\u22232)2 \u2212 4 [Im(\u03c9\u0303\u2206\u0303)]2 \u2212 4 [Im (\u03c9\u0303)]2 2k  . (S56) Notice that \u03c9\u0303 and \u2206\u0303 are generally both complex numbers and functions of energy , through the analytic continuation \u03c9 \u2192 i , preceding the iterative solution of Eqs. (S35)\u2013(S36).\nImportantly we find that the functions Re\u03c9\u0303 and Im\u2206\u0303 both vanish for | | < \u03c9g , i.e., the conductivity kernel S ( ) has a gap of the size 2\u03c9g . This fact, in conjunction with the relation in Eq. (S53), explains our observation given in the main text, that the activation energy actually coincides with \u03c9g . To see why, let us approximate S ( ) \u2248 S0\u0398 (| | \u2212 \u03c9g) (\u0398 is the Heaviside function), such that\n\u03c3xx \u221d S0 \u222b \u221e \u03c9g d ( \u2212df d ) = \u222b \u221e \u03c9g d S0 4T cosh2 2T = S0 2 ( 1\u2212 tanh \u03c9g 2T ) = S0 1 + e \u03c9g T , (S57)\nwhich for sufficiently low temperatures T \u03c9g , leads to the \u221d exp (\u2212\u03c9g/T ) activated behavior."
