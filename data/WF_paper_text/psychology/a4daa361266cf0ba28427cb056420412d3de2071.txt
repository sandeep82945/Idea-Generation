The reaction of mer-(Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (1) with one equivalent of thymine acetic acid (THAcH) unexpectedly produces the macrocyclic dimer k1(O), k(N,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc)2 (4) and, concomitantly, the doubly coordinated species k1(O), k(O,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (5). The reaction promptly forms a complicated mixture of Ru-coordinated mononuclear species. With the aim of shedding some light in this context, two plausible reaction paths were proposed by attributing the isolated or spectroscopically intercepted intermediates on the basis of DFT-calculated energetic considerations. The cleavage of the sterically demanding equatorial phosphine in the mer-species releases enough energy to enable self-aggregation, producing the stable, symmetric 14-membered binuclear macrocycle of 4. The k1-acetate iminol (C=N-OH) unit of the mer-tautomer k(O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)) (2) likely exhibits a stronger nucleophilic aptitude than the prevalent N(H)-C(O) amido species, thus accomplishing extra stabilization through concomitant k2(N,O)thymine heteroleptic side-chelation. Furthermore, both the ESI-Ms and IR simulation spectra validated the related dimeric arrangement in solution, in agreement with the X-ray determination of the structure. The latter showed tautomerization to the iminol form. The 1H NMR spectra in chlorinated solvents of the kinetic mixture showed the simultaneous presence of 4 and the doubly coordinated 5, in rather similar amounts. THAcH added in excess preferentially reacts with 2 or trans-k(O,O)-(RuH(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (3) rather than attacking the starting Complex 1, promptly forming the species of 5. The proposed reaction paths were inferred by spectroscopically monitoring the intermediate species, for which the results were strongly dependent on the of conditions the reaction (stoichiometry, solvent polarity, time, and the concentration of the mixture). The selected mechanism proved to be more reliable, due to the final dimeric product stereochemistry. 1. introduction We recently reported the synthesis, crystal structure, and theoretical investigations of the reaction between the dihydride complex (Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (1) and two equivalents of thymine acetic acid (THAcH) that promptly produced k1(O), k2(O,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)2) (5) with a good yield (90%), simultaneously bearing monohapto- and dihapto-acetate with vicinal phosphine ligands [1]. Analogous cyclo-metalated (N,O)- [2–11] and (O,O)- [12–14] chelated species have been previously reported by other groups. (Figure 1).

Moreover, in the last 10 years, they have demonstrated remarkable bioactivity as anticancer agents [9,11], ascribable to the exhibited versatility and flexibility (mainly due to the facile cleavage of phosphine ligands and their relocation), but also to their thermodynamic robustness as carriers, due to the function of chelated carboxyl. Recently, we also described the pivotal role of Ru’s coordination in the derivatives of thymine acetate (THAc), even in the absence of electron conjugation, due to the N-methylene spacer between thymine ring and the tethered acetate [1]. The role of metal coordination and the H-binding interactions network both result in affecting the transfer of H by triggering the transformation from the prevalent (C(O)NH) keto-amino to the rare tautomeric (N=C(OH)) iminol fragment. The iminol/amido isomer ratio has been evaluated to be 33% through the presence of low-shifted 1H NMR signals in the interval of 12.0– 7.7 ppm, as observed in (k1-2a,b + k2-3) numerous mixtures of various preparative paths and attributed to the iminol forms stabilized by intra- or inter-H-binding network. Analogous results have been accomplished under the same conditions by doubling the concentration of the reaction mixture, albeit with a remarkably reduced yield (25%). 2. Results and Discussion

The newly formed monohapto-acetate intermediat s 2a (red) and 2b (blue) are supported by the two distinct 1:0.8 1H NMR multiplet signals centered at δ = −6.1 and −7.2 in the hydride region with 2JH-Ptrans = 111 Hz and 2JH-Pcis = 24 Hz. Under the general assumption that more stable species correspond to the major 1H NMR hydride signals, the very broad major triplet at −17.01 ppm (in green) was assigned to the entropically favorable complex 3. The latter revealed uncountable conformations due to the mobility of the k2(O,O)-side arm, with low energy rotation (10 kJ mol−1) around the C-C bond between the methylene spacer and the carboxy unit (Figure 4).

The heteronuclear k2(N,O) complexes have been named as described in the theoretical section (see Fig-

unit with the hydridic H-Ru fragment with the less congested thymine CO(4), which dis-
places the vicinal phosphine ligand in the mer-species. The resulting complexes commonly
show transPP-stereochemistry. The more stable configurations are likely formed when the
donor N-atom is trans located to the Ru-CO acceptor ligand (6a). The minor signals can
instead be attributed to the diastereoisomers k2(N3,O2)-(RuH(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (7). In the latter case, closure of the ring is not favorable for steric congestion, taking into
account that the thymine O(2) atom is partially engaged in the H-bond with the carboxyl-
nit. In this context, the strained seven-membered species 8 (Scheme 2), which is probably
derived from the chelation of k2(O,O)-, was never observed, in agreement with the high

Description of the X-Ray Crystal Structure of 4
The X-ray molecular structure of 4 is shown in Figure 8, and the related bond lengths and angles are reported in Table 1. The molecule sits around an inversion center located midway between the Ru atoms, and consists of two Ru(PPh3)2(CO) units bridged by two thymine acetate groups. The geometry of the coordination at the Ru centers is a distorted octahedron with the PPh3 ligands adopting an unusual cis-configuration, one CO, and two bridging thymine acetate groups. The thymine acetate units are arranged in an antiparallel mode, coordinated to each Ru atom through one oxygen of the carboxylate moiety of one ligand and chelated by the (N,O) atoms of the thymine belonging to the second bridging ligand, thus forming a 14-membered dimetallacycle.

For the thymine acetate, this bridging mode is unprecedented, since the most common bridging mode is that involving only carboxylate oxygens, as has been found, for example, in a series of copper complexes (Cu2(µ-OOCCH2-T)4(G)2) (T = thymine-1-acetate, G = dimethylformamide, etc.) [19].

This result suggested that the k2-chelated species of 3 favoring entropy exhibited faster incorporation of a further THAcH molecule into the Ru skeleton, promoted by the stronger hydridic character than the parent, 1. Thus, the formation of the unexpected dimetallacycle k1(O), k2(N,O)-4 and the monomeric species k1(O), k2(O,O)-5 can be attributed to the influence of distinctive features:

• The poor solubility of the large molecule of 4 in chlorinated polar solvents, such as CH2Cl2, or CDCl3; • The stronger nucleophilic ability to promote self-coupling, shown by the tautomeric iminol species, compared with the stable keto-amino form. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20

On the other hand, the enhanced hydridic character (δ = −16.5) of the chelate transP,P, k2(O,O)-(RuH(CO) (PPh3)2THAc) (3), due to the influence of the dihapto-acetate ligand, and the minimiz d inter-ligand encumbrance, in agreement wi the previous theoretical calculations for the energy of torsion (10 kJ mol−1) [1], are factors which promote both the extra stabilization of 4 and the competitive formation of 5. The resulting cisP,P rearrangement, which was xhibited by the crowded species of 5, was also observed also in the self-aggregat d multihapto complex, 4. 2.3.1. IR Spectra
In the THAc ring, the CO(2) and CO(4) groups may act as hydrogen acceptors, whereas the ami o N3 is a hydrogen onor. Due to the forms of isoe ergetic resonance, it is commonly assumed that the lactim–lactam tautomerism prevails over the enol–keto equilibrium. In a previous report, the absorption at 1918 cm−1 was attrib ted to a mixture of 2, while more extensive degradation was exclusively assigned to 2a in keto form (see Supplemental Figure S6). The IR s ectrum of 2a, indicated as a precursor of the metallacycle
Molecules 2023, 28, 3983 11 of 19
4, shows a pattern with 1683 (CO asym), 1654 (CO sym), and 1362 (C-O) cm−1 bands, typical of the structure of monohapto-acetate. The Ru-carbonyl moiety appeared at 1918 cm−1 with weak broad absorption of Ru-H at ν = 2044. The acidic nature of the lactam form increased in the tautomerized lactim form through the presence of the iminol-(HO-C=N) moiety. Likewise, the imino-nucleophilic aptitude, permitting self-aggregation towards the center of Ru’s center, was strongly enhanced. We believe that the tautomeric equilibrium from the lactam to the lactim forms was triggered by both the intramolecular interaction of H of the O-H-O type and by the extensive intermolecular H-binding network. The key to the rearrangement of the Ru-monohapto-thymine acetate 2a to the minor tautomeric iminol species relies on the promotion of H-transfer to the stable lactim form. On the other hand, the growing IR absorbance at ν = 1511 (w) in the k1-acetate precursor 2b may be associated with the Ru-CO at ν = 1930 and the weak carbonyl thymine band observed at 1737 cm−1, indicating the tautomerized transformation towards the “transient” lactim –((HO)C=N-C(O)NH) species (see Supplemental Figure S4). It is conceivable that the N-imine moiety of 2b may exhibit a nucleophilic aptitude to the center of Ru which is stronger than that of the stable keto-amino species, thus favoring a concerted cleavage of the opposite equatorial phosphine to alleviate steric congestion. This process is triggered by multiple intermolecular interactions, which shuttle the transfer of H to promote the transformation to the iminol forms [20–29]. The coordination of Ru enables the stabilization of the unstable tautomer through the intramolecular interaction o fH (O-H——(O)C-ORu) between the tethered carboxy unit and the C2(OH) iminol moiety of C (Figure 10), as suggested by the observed high-shifted signal at δ = 11.2. The intermolecularly bound keto forms of B, which appeared at δ = 8.2, is the typical NH—(O)C Watson–Crick type bond [1]. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 20

may induce mismatching of the pairs of DNA nucleobases. The process of tautomerization
is commonly recognized to induce remarkable consequences for the structure of DNA
[30–44]. Since the canonical keto-amino isomers define the structure of the H–bond for
Watson–Crick nucleobase pairing, the minor tautomeric species, when impaired during
replication, may lead to mutagenesis [45–48]. Plausibly, both the intra– or inter–H–bond-
ing networks of the Ru-coordinated k1(O)-THAc may be responsible for enol–thymine
tautomerization, which ultimately produces the kinetically driven self-assembled Ru mac-
rocycle. Further, the entire structure exhibits extra stabilization through the mutual coor-
dination of the heteroleptic thymine ring k2(N3,O2). We suppose that, as a biochemical
implication, the rare tautomeric forms are likely to act in the replication of mismatched
DNA nucleobases. Unfortunately, the great insolubility precludes any attempts at bio-
chemical tests. Further applications might be in trapping small molecules such as solvents
(CHCl3, cyclohexane, or EtOH), as observed by X–rays of the crystallographic cells in dif-
ferent preparations, or by sequestering CO2 or alkaline metals such as Na+ or K+, which
may be confined in the 14-membered large metallacycle. The central cavity, where the
distance between the carboxyl C atoms is 557 pm, exhibited similar dimensions to zeolite
holes, as revealed by the space-filling molecular model (Supplemental Figure S12). How-
ever, the sterically demanding phosphine ligands can regulate the entrances by closing
the cyclo–metalated ring, and this process may be dynamic, owing to the flexible motion
of the related P-phenyl rings. The IR pattern of acetate units, which reciprocally penetrate the opposite centers of
Ru, were influenced by the four-membered dihapto–heteroleptic k2(N,O)–chelate (6 and
7), since the electrons’ density was strongly affected by the N-donor atom, revealing dis-
tinctive bands at 1654 and 1624 cm−1 assigned to the asymmetrical and symmetrical
stretching modes of carboxy, respectively, with ν = 1340 cm−1 for the ν of C-O. The intense
sharp band at ν = 1975 cm−1 of dimer 4 (Figure 11) was indicative of the presence of Ru-
CO. Furthermore, the bending absorption at 1091 cm−1 likely generated an overtone at
2222 cm−1, the attribution of which was suggested by the IR simulation calculated by DFT
(see Supplemental Figure S13), which distinguished the keto form of absorption from the
tautomeric form of enol, confirming the occurrence of the latter. Figure 10. Typical intra- or intermolecular H–bonds in the monohapto k1(O)–2 precursor [1].

Unfortunately, the great insolubility precludes any attempts at biochemical tests. Further applications might be in trapping small molecules such as solvents (CHCl3, cyclohexane, or EtOH), as observed by X–rays of the crystallographic cells in different preparations, or by sequestering CO2 or alkaline metals such as Na+ or K+, which may be confined in the 14-membered large metallacycle.

2.3.2. NMR Characterization
As revealed by the Ru-H triplet at −16.9 ppm, the remaining solution, composed of the related isomer, 2b, underwent thermodynamically driven evolution of the chelate k2(O,O)3. Meanwhile the insoluble microcrystalline white powder of 4 was dissolved in a 1:1 EtOAc–CH2Cl2 solvent mixture and purified upon filtration on a celite pad. The resulting compound showed 1H NMR signals at δ 5.75, 3.20, and 1.91 (see Supplemental Figure S1) in CDCl3, attributed, respectively, to the methyne, N-methylene, and methyl groups. Due to the extreme insolubility, any attempts to dissolve the microcrystalline white powder in deuterated Me2SO (dielectric constant ε = 46.7) or MeOH (dielectric constant ε = 32.6) led exclusively to rapid decomposition within 36 h at room temperature. However, the 31P NMR spectrum of CDCl3 revealed two residual doublets at 44.1 and 47.6 ppm assigned to the cis-located phosphine ligands of 4, and a broad signal at 38.4 ppm attributable to the decomposition to the chelate precursor, trans-k2(O,O)-((CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)), which was around δ = 29 (see Supplemental Figure S2) was the predominant signal, due to the OPPh3-oxidized phosphine released from the mer-k1(O)-2a. 2.3.3. DFT Calculations
To shed some light on the unexpected results and the relative stereochemistry, further theoretical calculations were run by adopting a more accurate density-functional approach and by introducing the effects of the solvent and the temperature to mimic the actual transformation (see Scheme 4).

The solvents were distilled immediately before use under nitrogen from the appropriate drying agents. Chromatographic separation was carried out on columns of dried celite. The glassware was oven-dried before use. The infrared spectra were recorded at 298 K on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrophotometer (Waltham, MA, USA), the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) spectra were recorded on a Waters Micromass ZQ 4000 (Milford, MA, USA), with the samples dissolved in CH3OH. All the deuterated solvents were degassed before use. All NMR measurements were performed on a Mercury Plus 400 instrument (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon-on-Thames, UK). The chemical shifts for 1H and 13C were referenced to internal TMS. All NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K. The decomposition point (dec. point) was measured on a Büchi 535 apparatus (Flawil, Switzerland). All the experimental and calculated yields were referenced to the precursor 1. All the reagents were commercial products (Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI, USA) of the highest purity available and were used as received. The (RuCl3·xH2O) was purchased from Strem (Bischheim, France) and used as received. The compound (Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (1) was prepared by published methods [17]. 3.2. experimental procedure 3.2.1. Synthesis of the Complex k1(O), k2(O,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc) (5)
A refluxing toluene solution of (Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (100 mg, 0.109 mmol) were added under stirring to two equivalents of thymine acetic acid (40 mg, 0.218 mmol). After 4 h, the absorption of Ru-CO at 1940 cm−1 disappeared. After drying under a vacuum, the light brown solid was washed with Et2O (3 × 10 mL) to remove the released PPh3. The crystallization that occurred in the CDCl3 produced white crystals of 5 (0.095 mmol, 97 mg, 87%). The same reaction was carried out by adding an excess of THAcH or two equivalents consecutively until the infrared (IR) absorption bands of the starting material disappeared. The spectroscopic characterization, including the mass spectra of 5, has already been reported in previous studies [1]. Molecules 2023, 28, 3983 15 of 19
3.2.2. Synthesis of the Complexes k1(O), k2(N,O)-(Ru(CO)(PPh3)2THAc)2 (4) + k1(O), k2(O,O)-Ru(CO)(PPh3)2(THAc)2) (5)
The ligand thymine acetic acid (20 mg, 0.109 mmol) and (Ru(H)2(CO)(PPh3)3) (100 mg, 0.109 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of toluene and refluxed until the initial Ru-CO IR absorption of 1 at 1941 cm−1 disappeared. After 3 h of refluxing in toluene, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the solvent was evaporated under a vacuum. Then the solid was dissolved in dichloromethane and filtered on a celite pad. After evaporation of the solvent, the dark brown solid was re-dissolved in CDCl3 and cooled to −20 ◦C. After standing for 30 days at −20 ◦C, white crystals belonging to the macrocyclic dimer complex (4) (30 mg, 0.018 mmol, 33%) and to the doubly coordinated species of 5 (20 mg, 0.020 mmol, 18%) were collected and filtered.

The cells’ dimensions and the orientation matrix were initially determined from a leastsquares refinement on the reflections measured in three sets of 20 exposures, collected in three different ω regions, and eventually refined against all data. A full sphere of the reciprocal space was scanned in steps of 0.3◦ ω. The software SMART (version 5.051) was used for collecting the frames of data, indexing the reflections, and determining the lattice parameters. The collected frames were then processed for integration by the SAINT program, and an empirical absorption correction was applied by using SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods (SIR 2004) and subsequent Fourier syntheses, and refined by the full-matrix least-squares on F2 (SHELXTL) [49–52] using anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. The asymmetric unit contained one CHCl3 molecule and one H2O molecule. CCDC-2,252,045 contains the supplemental crystallographic data from this study. The data can be obtained free of charge at www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html, (accessed on 27 march 2023), or by contacting The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre CB2 1EZ, UK; fax: +44 1223 33603, e-mail: deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk). 3.4. computational details All DFT calculations were performed using the ORCA 5.0.3 suite of quantum chemistry programs [53]. The geometries were optimized in a vacuum using the M06L function [54] and the def2-TZVP basis [55]. Dispersion corrections were also accounted for by following the DFT-D3 procedure (with zero damping functions), as suggested by Grimme et al. [56]. The vibrational frequencies were calculated at the optimized geometries to check the stability of the stationary points. The free energies at the boiling temperature of toluene (383.8K) were evaluated by applying a scale factor of 0.9824 to the vibrational frequencies, which was adequate for the present combination of functional DFT and the basis set [57] and a hypothetical pressure of 294.7 atm for the toluene solvent [58], to correct the overestimation of the entropic contributions. The final single-point energy calculations at the previously optimized geometries were performed with the large def2-QZVPP basis [55] and the M06 function [59], with the inclusion of the effects of solvation (with a toluene solvent) through the SMD model [60] and the interactions of dispersion [56]. The final energy of each structure, which was used to evaluate the relative free energies of the various products and intermediates, was determined by summing the difference between the def2-TZVP electronic energy and the free energy to the single-point electronic energy of def2-QZVPP.

This unexpected result can be explained by postulating the intercepted intermediates as key reaction steps. The self-aggregation of the rapidly formed monohapto-acetate 2a, followed by the mutual addition of heteroleptic (N,O) produced 4. Conversely, the homoleptic chelation of 2b to form the chelated species 3 was kinetically competitive, promoting the further incorporation of the THAc ligand to produce 5. The energetic considerations calculated by DFT enabled us to interpret the mechanism through the penta-coordinated derivatives, postulated as rather low energetic transition states. The trans–cis rearrangement required the occurrence of a much higher energy barrier than the nucleophilic attack of the mer-monohapto acetate of 2 on the reciprocal Ru site, which released an apical ligand, to produce the resulting cis-P,P stereochemistry. The proposed mechanism supports the facile promotion of H to explain the tautomerization from keto-amino to iminol species, exhibiting a stronger Ru-nucleophilic reaction of the k1(O)-coordinated thymine ring by regulating the distribution of the kinetic products. The observed dynamic behavior of the particular aptitude for the transfer of H, by keeping the metallic scaffold, might suggest further tailored catalytic processes, such as isomerization, as in the case of the chelate homoleptic k2(O,O)- species [13] or novel insight into therapeutic antitumor agents for the versatile heteroleptic k2(N,O) compounds [3].
