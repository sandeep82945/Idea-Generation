    "abstractText": "Citrus fruit contains rich nutrients which is edible and of officinal value.Citrus flavanones are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases, and they are a foundational material of Chinese medicine. The chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI) plays a key role in flavanone synthesis. Therefore, we comprehensively analyzed CHI genes in Citrus species. Here, thirty CHI genes were identified for the first time in six Citrus species, which were divided into CHI and FAP groups. Evolutionary analysis showed that CHI gene members were highly conserved and were an ancient family. All CsCHI genes showed the highest expression level after the second physiological fruit-falling period in C. sinensis. CsCHI1 and CsCHI3 were highly expressed at 50 days after the flowering (DAF) stage in albedo. The expression of CsFAP2 and CsCHI3 genes at the 50 DAF stage was 16.5 and 24.3 times higher than that at the 220 DAF stage, respectively. The expression of CsCHI1, CsCHI3, and CsFAP2 genes in the peel was higher than that in the pulp, especially in common sweet orange. The CsCHI3 gene maintained a high expression level in the epicarp and juice sac at all periods. The members of CHIs interacted with chalcone synthase (CHS), flavonol synthase/flavanone 3-hydroxylase (FLS) and naringenin, and 2oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase (F3H) to form heterodimers, which might together play a regulatory role and participate in the flavonoid pathway. This study will provide the basis for the selection of flavonoids in plant tissues and periods and fundamental information for further functional studies.",

The chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI) plays a key role in flavanone synthesis. Therefore, we comprehensively analyzed CHI genes in Citrus species. Here, thirty CHI genes were identified for the first time in six Citrus species, which were divided into CHI and FAP groups. Evolutionary analysis showed that CHI gene members were highly conserved and were an ancient family. All CsCHI genes showed the highest expression level after the second physiological fruit-falling period in C. sinensis. CsCHI1 and CsCHI3 were highly expressed at 50 days after the flowering (DAF) stage in albedo. The expression of CsFAP2 and CsCHI3 genes at the 50 DAF stage was 16.5 and 24.3 times higher than that at the 220 DAF stage, respectively. The expression of CsCHI1, CsCHI3, and CsFAP2 genes in the peel was higher than that in the pulp, especially in common sweet orange. The CsCHI3 gene maintained a high expression level in the epicarp and juice sac at all periods. The members of CHIs interacted with chalcone synthase (CHS), flavonol synthase/flavanone 3-hydroxylase (FLS) and naringenin, and 2- oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase (F3H) to form heterodimers, which might together play a regulatory role and participate in the flavonoid pathway. This study will provide the basis for the selection of flavonoids in plant tissues and periods and fundamental information for further functional studies.\nKeywords: Citrus species, chalcone-flavanone isomerase, phylogenetic analysis, gene expression pattern, flavanones\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Citrus fruit belongs to the Rutaceae family and is one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops worldwide (Wu et al., 2018). Many researchers believe that citrus originated in Southeast Asia and began to be cultivated 4,000 years ago (Scora, 1975; Gmitter and Hu, 1990; Xu et al., 2013). Globally, the annual output of citrus fruit is more than 120million tons (FAO statistics, see URLs), which is not only a nutritional source for human health but also rich in medicinal ingredients (Tocmo et al., 2020;\nEdited by: Vinod K.

Genet. 13:848141. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.848141\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481411\nORIGINAL RESEARCH published: 12 April 2022\ndoi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.848141\nZhao et al., 2020). Vitamin C, as an important part of human nutrition, mainly comes from Citrus fruits (Xu et al., 2013). Moreover, phytochemical studies report that the Citrus plant has constituents including flavonoids, limonoids, and carotenoids (Zibaee et al., 2020; Addi et al., 2022). Citrus extracts were widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other diseases and have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and nerve-protective effects (Szczepaniak et al., 2020; Zibaee et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2021).\nFlavonoids are a kind of important secondary metabolites in plants, mainly in the form of glycosides (Winkel-Shirley, 2001; Kumar and Pandey, 2013). Phe and malonyl-coenzyme A form flavonoids through the fatty acid pathway and flavonoids constitute a diversified aromatic molecular family (Winkel-Shirley, 2001). The characteristic of fruit flavanones is that a disaccharidic moiety is connected to the 7 position of aglycone. Narirutin and naringin in grapefruit, hesperidin and narirutin in orange, and eriocitrin in lemon are the most representative flavanones (Peterson et al., 2006; Chanet et al., 2012; Kumar and Pandey, 2013). Citrus flavanones positively influence the cardio-metabolic system and prevent cardiovascular disease (Dauchet et al., 2005; Dauchet et al., 2006; He et al., 2006). For example, the positive effects of Citrus flavanones on the cardiovascular system are mainly manifested in the reduction of endothelial dysfunction, improvement of vascular function, and lipid level reduction (He et al., 2006; Testai and Calderone, 2017). The beneficial mechanism of Citrus flavanones on the cardiovascular system is mainly manifested in the vasodilator activity, anti-ischemic activity, glucose tolerance, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions (Testai and Calderone, 2017). In addition, flavanones also have other pharmacological properties, such as anti-aging and anti-tumor activities, antioxidation, and immunity regulation (Yin et al., 2019).\nMany studies have shown that naringenin plays an important role in the synthesis of flavanones (Yin et al., 2019). Meanwhile, CHI is a key enzyme in the synthesis of naringenin by the isomerization of 4, 2\u2032, 4\u2032, 6\u2032- tetrahydroxychalcone (Shirley et al., 1992). In 1986, the first CHI gene was successfully cloned in Pisum sativum L. (Mehdy and Lamb, 1987). So far, more than 3,000 nucleotide sequences have been registered on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank, involving 290 species in 71 families (Yin et al., 2019). Among all these species, medicinal plants account for a large proportion, such as Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Ginkgo biloba L., and Mirabilis himalaica (Zhang et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2012; Lan et al., 2016). Arabidopsis studies have shown the function of CHI as a unique enhancer in the flavone pathway (Jiang et al., 2015). The CHI gene promotes fruit yellowing in fresh-cut Chinese water-chestnut (He and Pan, 2017). In addition, the study also found that the expression of the CHI gene was positively correlated with flavonoid accumulation in plants (Wang et al., 2010; Guan et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2015).\nAt present, the regulation of flavonoids in the genus Citrus mainly focuses on the identification and function of key transcription factors and some enzymes. However, the\nsystematic analysis of the CHI gene family in genus Citrus has not been reported. Recently, a type IV CHI gene was identified in Citrus reticulata cv. Suavissima, which enhances the accumulation of flavanones and flavones (Zhao et al., 2021). This study further supports the importance of comprehensively identifying and analyzing the CHI gene family in Citrus, including gene structure, molecular characterizations, molecular evolution, and genes expression patterns. To conclude, this study improves the understanding of Citrus CHI genes and provides a reference for selecting tissue and period for flavonoid extraction. This study will be of great significance for further understanding the mechanism of flavonoid synthesis in Citrus species."

The phylogenetic trees of the NJ method were conducted using MEGA 7.0 with the following parameters: 1,000 bootstrap resampling, pairwise deletion option, and the Jones\u2013Taylor\u2013Thornton (JTT) model. The phylogenetic trees of the ML method were conducted using MEGA 7.0 with the following parameters: 1,000 bootstrap resampling, complete deletion option, and the Jones\u2013Taylor\u2013Thornton (JTT) model (Kumar et al., 2016).\nFor the purpose of identifying the synteny of CHI genes, the genome sequence of C. grandis and C. sinensis was downloaded on a local server. First, we merged the genomic data corresponding to the two species. The protein sequences were aligned using the BLAST software with the following parameters: e-value \u2264 1e\u22125 and number threads = 10 (Ye et al., 2006). We analyzed the genome-wide synteny using the MCScanX software with alignment significance (E-value < 1e\u22125) (Wang et al., 2012). The gene pairs of synteny were extracted from the collinearity and tandem files. We visualized synteny gene pairs at the whole chromosome level using the R package circlize.\nExpression Pattern Analysis of CHI Genes RNA-seq data for C. sinensis were obtained from the NCBI GEO DataSets under accession numbers PRJNA689213 and PRJNA517400 (Feng et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021). The transcriptome data of pulp and peel contained two types of sweet oranges (Valencia orange and common sweet orange), involving six varieties. The Valencia orange included \u201cRohde Red Valencia,\u201d \u201cDelta Valencia,\u201d and \u201cCutter Valencia\u201d oranges. The common sweet orange included \u201cXianfeng,\u201d \u201cJincheng,\u201d and \u201cTaoye\u201d oranges (Huang et al., 2021). Compared with the common sweet orange, Valencia orange belonged to lateripening sweet oranges which had poor mastication traits (Wu et al., 2020). The transcriptome data of fruit development included four tissues (albedo, epicarp, juice sac, and segment membrane), involving four periods (the second physiological fruit-falling period, the expansion period, the coloring period, and the full-ripening period), which were divided into six time points (Feng et al., 2021). We extracted the expression of CHI genes and analyzed the expression pattern using the R package pheatmap.\nTo further verify the specific expression of genes, we detected the relative expression of CsCHI genes in fruit tissue by real-time quantitative PCR. The isolation of total RNA and the construction of the cDNA library were carried out using the TaKaRa kit (Code No. 9767 and Code No. RR047A). Specific primers of CsCHI genes for qRT-PCR were designed using Primer3Plus tools (Supplementary Table S1).

            "text": "Proteins in Citrus Species By combining BLAST and HMM searches, a total of 30 chalcone domain proteins were identified across six Citrus species (Table 1). Then, each putative protein was assigned to their closest Arabidopsis orthologous proteins and named (Supplementary Figure S1; Table 1). In total, this Citrus chalcone domain included 13 CHI and 17 fatty acid-binding protein (FAP) genes (Table 1). We obtained five CHI genes in each species, but C. clementina contained two CHI3 (CcCHI3;1 and CcCHI3;2) genes without FAP1 genes. The sequence lengths varied between 169 and 640 amino acids (aa), the isoelectric point (pI) ranged from 4.81 to 9.23, and the molecular weight (MW) varied from 18.98 to 70.85 kDa (Table 1). Subcellular localization prediction results showed that all CHI subfamily members were predicted to be targeted to the cytoplasm, whereas, CrCHI1, CmCHI1, and CgCHI1 were predicted to be located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and CcCHI3; 2 was predicted to be located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Table 1).\nWe showed the relationships among the 30 CHI genes in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A). These proteins were clustered into five groups, which were similar to the groups of Arabidopsis CHI (Supplementary Figure S1). A cluster analysis again verified the differences between C. clementina CHI members and other species. The motif analysis showed that 12 conserved motifs were identified in 30 CHI/FAP proteins, and the length of the 12 motifs ranged from 21 to 50 aa (Figure 1B). Motifs 1, 3, and 5 together spread over the chalcone domain of CHI proteins (Figure 1B). Even though CHIs and FAPs had the chalcone domain, their amino acid sequences were not completely consistent. Although most of the FAP2 members shared the 11 conserved motifs, CrFAP2 lacked motifs 6, 10, and 12 (Figure 1B). We found that the members of each group had similar motif characteristics. For example, motifs 5, 3, 1, and 2 joined together and appeared in the CHI3 group, whereas motifs 9, 3, 1, 5, 4, and 2 joined together and appeared in the CHI1 group (Figure 1B). Citrus CHI genes had a rather loose gene structure, including introns ranging from 3 to 10 (Figure 1C). Except for\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481413\nCsCHI1 carrying three introns, most of the CHI1 genes had six introns in their genomic DNA. In the FAP2, all the genes possessed numerous introns, with 10 or 11 introns (Figure 1C). Combined with the phylogenetic tree, it was found that the CHI genes closely related to evolution had similar exon and intron structures in terms of intron number, location, and exon length (Figure 1).\nPhylogenetic Analysis of CHI Genes The evolutionary relationships of CHI genes were further explored by phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. Fifty two CHI genes were obtained in 10 species, including seven dicotyledons (C. clementina, C. grandis, C. reticulata, C. media, C. reticulata, C. sinensis, and A. thaliana), monocotyledons (O. sativa), lycophyte (S. moellendorffii), and moss (P. patens) (Figure 2). Here, we identified four, four, and seven CHI genes in P. patens, S. moellendorffii, and O. sativa, respectively. The phylogenetic tree showed five clades, including CHI1/2, CHI3, FAP1, FAP2, and FAP3, whereas, the phylogenetic tree of seven dicotyledons strongly supported these subclades (Supplementary Figure S1). Four S. moellendorffii CHI genes were distributed to clades CHI1/ 2, CHI3, FAP2, and FAP3, respectively (Figure 2). Four P. patens CHI genes were distributed to clades CHI3, FAP2, and FAP3, respectively (Figure 2). The CHI gene might retain more ancient genetic information in plant evolution. We found that the CHI genes of angiosperms had a closer relationship in the subclades. Among them, the CHI genes of Citrus species were more closely\nrelated to A. thaliana than O. sativa. In general, CHI genes were a good gene resource for studying plant evolution. Although each plum plant contains five CHI genes, the CcFAP1 gene was missing in C. clementina, but two CHI3 genes (CcCHI3;1 and CcCHI3;2) were added in the CHI3 clades, which might be related to the expansion/contraction event of the gene family in the process of C. clementina evolution."

The distribution of the syntenic genes across chromosomes showed that there was an obvious correlation between the chromosomes (Cg4g vs. Cs4g, Cg5g vs. Cs5g, and Cg7g vs. Cs7g). The checking gene collinearity within a genome showed that 80% of CHI genes (CsCHI3 and CgCHI3, CsFAP3 and CgFAP3, CsFAP2 and CgFAP2, and CsFAP1 and CgFAP1) were located in collinear blocks for C. grandis and C. sinensis (Supplementary Table S3).

These results further proved the close relationship between C. grandis and C. sinensis.\nTABLE 1 | Characteristics of the CHI genes identified in Citrus.\nName Gene ID Locus Protein length (aa) MW (kDa) pI Localization Species\nCcCHI1 Ciclev10032697m Ciclev10032697m 222 23.98 5.04 Cytoplasm Citrus clementina CcCHI3;1 Ciclev10032749m Ciclev10032749m 209 23.23 5.01 Cytoplasm Citrus clementina CcCHI3;2 Ciclev10032801m Ciclev10032801m 197 21.85 5.1 Cytoplasm/mitochondria Citrus clementina CcFAP2 Ciclev10008420m Ciclev10008420m 419 45.93 8.43 Cytoplasm Citrus clementina CcFAP3 Ciclev10021578m Ciclev10021578m 279 30.08 9.02 Mitochondria Citrus clementina CgCHI1 Cg7g005600 Cg7g005600 640 70.85 5.68 Cytoplasm/nucleus Citrus grandis CgCHI3 Cg7g003710 Cg7g003710 209 23.32 4.95 Cytoplasm Citrus grandis CgFAP1 Cg5g035430 Cg5g035430 283 31.23 8.95 Nucleus Citrus grandis CgFAP2 Cg4g018640 Cg4g018640 419 45.96 8.43 Cytoplasm Citrus grandis CgFAP3 Cg5g015710 Cg5g015710 188 20.52 6.58 Cytoplasm Citrus grandis CiCHI1 Ci123750 scaffold_98 498 55.13 5.01 Cytoplasm Citrus ichangensis CiCHI3 Ci070860 scaffold_40 209 23.23 5.01 Cytoplasm Citrus ichangensis CiFAP1 Ci208590 scaffold_290 283 31.15 8.96 Nucleus Citrus ichangensis CiFAP2 Ci086900 scaffold_54 419 45.90 8.58 Cytoplasm Citrus ichangensis CiFAP3 Ci157120 scaffold_155 279 30.07 9.14 Mitochondria Citrus ichangensis CmCHI1 Cm154640 scaffold_243 608 67.18 5.3 Cytoplasm/nucleus Citrus media CmCHI3 Cm078090 scaffold_79 209 23.11 5.09 Cytoplasm Citrus media CmFAP1 Cm230370 scaffold_554 282 31.09 8.8 Nucleus Citrus media CmFAP2 Cm086460 scaffold_94 419 45.95 8.43 Cytoplasm Citrus media CmFAP3 Cm084050 scaffold_90 279 30.17 9.14 Mitochondria Citrus media CrCHI1 MSYJ042510 scaffold86082_cov97 608 67.04 5.24 Cytoplasm/nucleus Citrus reticulata CrCHI3 MSYJ145200 scaffold86030_cov92 209 23.23 5.01 Cytoplasm Citrus reticulata CrFAP1 MSYJ218720 scaffold132_cov94 282 31.03 8.96 Nucleus Citrus reticulata CrFAP2 MSYJ122560 scaffold294_cov92 265 29.47 7.57 Mitochondria Citrus reticulata CrFAP3 MSYJ007070 scaffold835_cov91 279 30.14 9.14 Mitochondria Citrus reticulata CsCHI1 Cs7g28130 Cs7g28130 222 23.98 5.04 Cytoplasm Citrus sinensis CsCHI3 Cs7g29780 Cs7g29780 169 18.98 4.81 Cytoplasm Citrus sinensis CsFAP1 Cs5g31220 Cs5g31220 223 24.98 8.9 Mitochondria Citrus sinensis CsFAP2 Cs4g06290 Cs4g06290 419 45.93 8.43 Cytoplasm Citrus sinensis CsFAP3 Cs5g13060 Cs5g13060 279 30.12 9.23 Mitochondria Citrus sinensis\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481414"

The average expression of all CsCHI genes was the highest in the 50 DAF stage, then decreased rapidly, and increased slightly in the 155 DAF stage (Supplementary Table S4). As shown in Figure 4A, CsCHI1 and CsCHI3 were highly expressed at the 50 DAF stage in albedo. After that, with the continuous growth and development of fruits, the expression level dropped during the 80 to 220 DAF stage. Surprisingly, the expression level of the CsFAP2 gene was very high in the 50 DAF stage, which was 12.2 times higher than that in the 220 DAF stage. The CsFAP3 gene maintained a high expression level in the 80 to\n180 DAF stage. As shown in Figure 4B, the expression of CHI genes was higher in the epicarp than in albedo. The expression of CsCHI1 was upregulated from the 155 DAF stage, and the expression of the CsFAP2 gene was relatively low at the 80 DAF stage. As shown in Figure 4C, all genes had the highest expression at the 50 DAF stage in the juice sac, and then the expression began to decline, except the CsFAP1 gene. The expression of the CsFAP2 gene at the 50 DAF stage was 16.5 times higher than that at the 220 DAF stage. The expressions of CsFAP2 and CsCHI3 genes at the 50 DAF stage were 16.5 and 24.3 times higher than that at the 220 DAF stage, respectively. As shown in Figure 4D, five CsCHI genes had the highest expression at the 50 DAF stage in the segment membrane, and then the expression began to decline. We found that the expression of the CsFAP1 gene increased slightly at the 155 and 180 DAF stages. The analysis of gene expression patterns showed that CsCHI genes played a major regulatory role at the 50 DAF stage.\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481415\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481416"

            "text": "To investigate the expression pattern of CsCHI genes, 36 samples were used for the expression patterns analysis, including peel and pulp from six varieties based on the available transcriptome data (Huang et al., 2021). The six varieties were selected from two categories: common sweet orange and Valencia orange. The Valencia orange ripened later than the common sweet orange and had a poor mastication trait (Wu et al., 2020). We found that five CsCHI genes showed specific expression in the pulp and peel of different varieties (Figure 5, Supplementary Table S5). On the whole, these genes showed higher expression levels in the peel, and the lowest expression levels in the common sweet orange pulp. CsCHI1 and CsFAP2 genes with similar expression patterns were clustered into the same subset and specifically expressed in the peel (Figure 5). Compared with pulp, the average expression of CsCHI1 and CsFAP2 genes were upregulated by 2.6 and 4.5 times in the peel, respectively. We found that the CsFAP1 gene was highly expressed in the peel and pulp, and only the CsFAP1 gene was downregulated in the peel, but the difference was not significant (Figure 5). These results showed that the CsFAP1 gene had no tissue-specific expression pattern in the peel and pulp. Interestingly, the CsFAP3 gene was more likely to be upregulated in the three Valencia orange varieties.\nMeanwhile, the expression of CsCHI1, CsFAP2 and CsFAP3 genes was hardly detected in the common sweet orange pulp (Figure 5).\nTo further examine the expression level ofCsCHI genes in different fruit tissues, we compared the expression levels of these genes in the albedo, epicarp, juice sac, and segment membrane (Figure 6; Supplementary Figure S2). We observed that CsCHI genes were mainly expressed in the epicarp and juice sac. Interestingly, the expression pattern of the CsCHI gene in the epicarp and juice sac showed a negative correlation during fruit development. The CsCHI3 gene was highly expressed in the epicarp and juice sac, followed by the segment membrane. The expression of the CsCHI3 gene was hardly detected in the albedo at any developmental stage of the fruit.CsCHI1 remained highly expressed after the expansion period in the epicarp. Meanwhile, the expression of CsCHI1 was detected in the albedo at the early stage of fruit development. The expression level of CsFAP3 was relatively low in four tissues, and there was no obvious tissuespecific expression pattern. CsFAP1 and CsFAP2 genes were mainly expressed in the epicarp, especially in the late stage of fruit development.\nAnalysis of CHI Genes Involved in Flavonoid"

We found that five CHI genes had similar gene expression patterns, and there was direct interaction between their expressed proteins (Figure 7A, Supplementary Figure S3; Supplementary Table S6). These results indicated that the part members of CHI genes might play a regulatory role together and participated in the regulation of life activities. In addition, the CHIs and TTs, F3H, and FLSs also had strong interactions, and were the key proteins in this interaction network (Figure 7B). TT4, belonging to the chalcone and stilbene synthase family, encoded chalcone synthase (CHS). CHS could catalyze p-coumaroyl-CoA to form naringenin chalcone, which was a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Naringenin chalcone further formed naringenin under the catalysis of CHI. Naringin formed apigenin and dihydrokaempferol under the action of flavonol synthase/\nflavanone 3-hydroxylase (FLS) and naringenin, 2-oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase (F3H), respectively (Figure 7C; Supplementary Figure S4). FLS catalyzed the oxidation of both enantiomers of naringenin to give both cis- and trans-dihydrokaempferols. F3H catalyzed the 3-beta-hydroxylation of 2S-flavanones to 2R, 3Rdihydroflavonols which were intermediates in the biosynthesis of flavonols, anthocyanidins, catechins, and proanthocyanidins in plants. The results showed that CHIs played a key role in flavonoid metabolism and were an essential substrate for naringin synthesis."

            "text": "Flavonoids are composed of many metabolites with different structures, which play a key role in plant growth and development\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481418\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8481419\nand have important medicinal value (Moore et al., 2014; Testai and Calderone, 2017; Brunetti et al., 2018). Naringenin, an aglycone called naringenin according to its chemical structure, belongs to flavonoids (Szczepaniak et al., 2020). Naringenin produced by CHI is an important precursor of other flavonoids. The Arabidopsis genome contains six CHI proteins with the chalcone domain, which are AtCHI1 (AT3G55120), AtCHI2 (AT5G66220), AtCHI3 (AT5G05270), AtFAP1 (AT5G66230), AtFAP2 (AT2G26310), and AtFAP3 (AT1G53520) (UniProt, 2019). In our study, 30 CHI proteins were identified in six Citrus species, with five proteins in each species. The CHI2 protein homologous to Arabidopsis was\nmissing in all Citrus species. AtCHI2 catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization of bicyclic chalcone to tricyclic (s)flavanone, which has the same function as AtCHI1 (UniProt, 2019). AtCHI1 and AtCHI2 are considered to be two proteins, and the identity of the sequence is only 63.6%. However, the study of chalcone-flavanone isomerase protein genes in Arabidopsis shows that AtCHI2 is a pseudogene (Ngaki et al., 2012). The CHI genes of six Citrus plants showed that the pseudogene Citrus CHI2 could not be retained in the process of evolution.\nIn previous studies, CHI proteins are divided into four types (Type I, II, III, and IV) according to characteristics of the sequence structure (Zhao et al., 2021). Only the CHI proteins of types I and II have\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 84814110\nenzymatic cyclization activity (Ralston et al., 2005). The CHI of type III (FAP) is the prototype of other CHI-fold proteins, but it has a fatty acid-binding ability (Ngaki et al., 2012). The secondary structure of the CHI of type IV is similar to CHI of type I and II, while the key residues are substituted (Ngaki et al., 2012). The CHI protein of Arabidopsis contains three CHI and three FAP proteins (Ngaki et al., 2012). At the same time, the CHI proteins of six Citrus species are evenly divided into five subgroups according to the homologues of Arabidopsis. Each subgroup had a similar gene structure and conserved motif distribution. These results also further confirmed the functional differences of different types of CHI proteins.\nCHI is obviously a lack of related proteins in the primary metabolism of the flavanone pathway (Jez et al., 2000; Jez et al., 2002), whichmakes the origin of CHI difficult to understand. In 2012, Micheline et al. showed that CHI originated from FAP3 through phylogenetic analysis (Ngaki et al., 2012). Similar results were also confirmed in our CHI phylogenetic tree. The chalcone-binding site of bona fide CHI and key catalytic residues lacked in CHI-like homologues of bacteria and fungi (Gensheimer and Mushegian, 2004). At the same time, some studies showed that CHI genes are restricted to vascular plants (Ngaki et al., 2012). The difference in the number ofCHI genes between non-seed plants andCitrusmay be the loss or increase of genes caused by species divergence events. The phylogenetic differentiation of CHI is not significant between seed and non-seed plants (P. patens and S. moellendorffii). The results show that CHI genes belong to an ancient family and the CHI gene study of soybean has the same conclusion (Ralston et al., 2005).\nThe level of gene expression directly affects the content of transcripts and the regulation of genes. GmCHI genes show rootspecific expression in soybean and differential expression by nodulation signals (Ralston et al., 2005). In addition, LjCHI genes show differential expression under fungal elicitor treatment in Lasianthus japonicas (Shimada et al., 2003). The expression of the CitCHIL1 gene in flower tissue was higher than that in roots, stems, and leaves in Citrus reticulata cv. Suavissima (Zhao et al., 2021). This study showed that the expression of CsCHI1, CsCHI3, and CsFAP2 genes in peel was higher than that in pulp, especially in the common sweet orange. The CsCHI3 gene maintained a high expression level in the epicarp and juice sac at all periods. The developing tissue of Arabidopsis, including roots, seeds, embryos, cotyledons, tapetum,macrospores, preanthesis, and young seedlings, shows high expression of FAPs (Ngaki et al., 2012). The expression of the AtFAP2 gene can be detected in the whole life cycle. However, AtFAP1 and AtFAP3 genes are only expressed in developing and reproductive tissues. These genes have amaximal expression in seeds at 6 DAF (Ngaki et al., 2012). The expression of CitCHI1, CitCHIL1/ 2, andCitFAP1/3 is the highest at 30DAF, whileCitFAP2 reaches the peak at 120 DAF (Zhao et al., 2021). In this study, all CHI genes maintained a high expression level at 50 DAF, and then showed a down-expression trend during fruit development. The expression processing of CHI genes in plants is dynamic and characterized by spatio-temporal specificity.\nIn plants, CHI proteins play essential roles in flavonoid biosynthesis (Mehdy and Lamb, 1987; Winkel-Shirley, 2001; Gensheimer and Mushegian, 2004). The expression pattern of the CitCHIL1 gene was highly positively correlated with the accumulation of flavonoids, and was highly synchronized with\nthe expression of CitCHI, CitCHS1, and CitCHS2 genes (Zhao et al., 2021). The content of flavonoids in the peel is higher than that in pulp (Wang Y. et al., 2017), which is consistent with the expression of CHI genes in this study. These results also mean that flavonoid content can be evaluated by detecting the expression of CHI and CHS genes. The beneficial mechanism of Citrus flavanone on the cardiovascular system is mainly manifested in vasodilator activity, anti-ischemic activity, glucose tolerance, and anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory action (Testai and Calderone, 2017). In addition, flavanones also have other pharmacological properties, such as anti-aging and anti-tumor activities, anti-oxidation, and immunity regulation (Jung et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2008; Testai, 2015; Da Pozzo et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2019). Flavanone compounds are unevenly distributed in fruits, mainly in the albedo and in the membranes separating cloves (Testai and Calderone, 2017). The albedo and membranous parts of Citrus fruits are usually discarded in the present processing and eating process. The rational use of Citrus resources can not only produce more valuable products for human beings, but also reduce environmental pollution."
