    "abstractText": "Post-transcriptional RNA modification methods are in high demand for site-specific RNA labelling and analysis of RNA functions. In vitro-selected ribozymes are attractive tools for RNA research and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of chemoenzymatic approaches with repurposed methyltransferases. Here we report an alkyltransferase ribozyme that uses a synthetic, stabilized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue and catalyses the transfer of a propargyl group to a specific adenosine in the target RNA. Almost quantitative conversion was achieved within 1 h under a wide range of reaction conditions in vitro, including physiological magnesium ion concentrations. A genetically encoded version of the SAM analogue-utilizing ribozyme (SAMURI) was expressed in HEK293T cells, and intracellular propargylation of the target adenosine was confirmed by specific fluorescent labelling. SAMURI is a general tool for the site-specific installation of the smallest tag for azide-alkyne click chemistry, which can be further functionalized with fluorophores, affinity tags or other functional probes.",

In vitro-selected ribozymes are attractive tools for RNA research and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of chemoenzymatic approaches with repurposed methyltransferases. Here we report an alkyltransferase ribozyme that uses a synthetic, stabilized S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue and catalyses the transfer of a propargyl group to a specific adenosine in the target RNA. Almost quantitative conversion was achieved within 1 h under a wide range of reaction conditions in vitro, including physiological magnesium ion concentrations. A genetically encoded version of the SAM analogue-utilizing ribozyme (SAMURI) was expressed in HEK293T cells, and intracellular propargylation of the target adenosine was confirmed by specific fluorescent labelling. SAMURI is a general tool for the site-specific installation of the smallest tag for azide-alkyne click chemistry, which can be further functionalized with fluorophores, affinity tags or other functional probes.\nS it e- sp ec ific chemical modification methods that enable precise postsynthetic or post-transcriptional functionalization of RNA provide robust means to probe and manipulate RNA functions in vitro and in cells1,2. Chemoenzymatic strategies with repurposed methyltransferase (MTase) protein enzymes and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM or AdoMet) derivatives have emerged as powerful methods for targeted RNA modification3\u20136. Several types of chemically modified SAM analogue have been developed, including variants for the transfer of alkyne7,8 or azide tags9,10, photoreactive groups11, fluorophores12 or biotin13. The installation of bioorthogonal functional groups allows further derivatization via click reactions for several purposes, including affinity purification8, chemical degradation14 or fluorescent labelling15 of target RNAs. In some examples, modified SAM analogues have been applied for target modification in the intracellular context by using a cascade reaction of methionine adenosyl-transferase (MAT) and MTases16\u201318. Such metabolic approaches are designed to give global modifications of DNA, RNA or proteins16,19, but often lack target specificity, because many cellular MTases maintain a common SAM recognition domain. To address specific RNA targets beyond the mRNA cap20, either structurespecific tRNA MTases21, or C/D box snoRNPs with sequence-specific guide RNAs7, have been used in vitro. Ribozymes have gained increasing momentum as an alternative sequence-specific approach for post-synthetic RNA modification2,22. Usually, the catalytic core is flanked by binding arms that hybridize to a particular target sequence by Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing, placing the target nucleotide into the active site for reaction with a specific, non-covalently bound cofactor. Thus, these trans-active ribozymes combine both functions\u2014the guide and the catalyst\u2014in one RNA molecule that interacts with the RNA target. Several combinations of ribozymes and cofactors for RNA labelling have been identified by in vitro selection. For example, ribozymes catalyse the attachment of fluorescently labelled nucleotides23,24 or acyclic nucleotide analogues25 to a specific internal 2\u2032-OH group of the target RNA, or at the 3\u2032-end26. Other classes of ribozymes work in cis, that is, they catalyse\nReceived: 26 August 2022\nAccepted: 8 August 2023"

In addition, we prepared an analogous \u03b1-hydroxy-amide cofactor 9, which we considered an alternative in vitro-selection substrate. Each of these cofactors was obtained as a mixture of four diastereomers, which were not separated.\nThe chemical stability of ProSeDMA was compared to ProSeAM (Fig. 1f) under three different pH conditions (pH 6, 7 and 8). ProSeAM was rapidly degraded even at pH 6, and almost all of it was converted to Se-propargyl-5\u2032-selenoadenosine after 1 h. In contrast, ProSeDMA was much more stable, with less than 5% loss after 1 h, and still more than 60% of the intact material remaining after 5 h of incubation at pH 7.0.\nNext, we investigated the bioorthogonality of ProSeDMA, expecting that the terminal amide substitution and 2-aminoadenosine modification probably prevent recognition by native MTases. We chose the bacterial MTase M.EcoR1 and plasmid DNA for enzymatic modification, as previously described37. The modification efficiency was evaluated by enzymatic digestion with the restriction enzyme R. EcoR1 after MTase treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1). If the cofactor is accepted and the target site is modified by MTase, digestion by the restriction enzyme will be suppressed. Analogous reactions with SAM, ProSeAM, ProSeDMA (5) and MeSeDMA (6) were performed in parallel. The digestion pattern of the ProSeDMA-containing sample was almost the same as in the experiment without cofactor. This result suggests that ProSeDMA was not recognized as a cofactor by EcoR1 MTase. By contrast, ProSeAM, and surprisingly also MeSeDMA, showed similar activity to SAM. Thus, the combination of propargyl and amide modification provided sufficient structural change to escape from MTase recognition, and ProSeDMA is a potential candidate to serve as a bioorthogonal cofactor for intracellular propargyl modification of RNA with a suitable ribozyme."

Two independent selection experiments were performed using ProSeDMA (5) and its \u03b1-hydroxy analogue 9 as co-substrates. After RNA folding and incubation with the cofactor at pH 7.5 and 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, the transferred propargyl group was reacted with biotin azide under Cu-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction conditions. The biotinylated RNA molecules were then separated via streptavidin affinity purification on magnetic beads. The captured RNAs were amplified by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The generated dsDNA template was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, and the enriched RNA library was used in the next round of selection. After eight rounds, the enriched library was cloned and sequenced, and individual ribozyme candidates were screened for activity by a streptavidin gel shift assay (Extended Data Fig. 3) with both cofactors 5 and 9. Interestingly, the ribozyme candidates from the selection with cofactor 5 only recognized their cognate \u03b1-amino cofactor ProSeDMA, while candidate ribozymes from the selection with cofactor 9 showed promiscuous activity with both 5 and 9. The RNA sequence Rz3 showed the highest reactivity of all screened ribozyme candidates, and was chosen for further characterization and optimization. The Rz3 ribozyme retained its catalytic activity in an intermolecular set-up (in trans). Strategic mutations in the binding arms that fixed mismatched base pairs or bulged out nucleotides indicated the localization of the reacting adenosine (A5), which was further confirmed by primer extension assays and by re-targeting (\u2018transplanting\u2019) the ribozyme to a different adenosine (A9) in the RNA sequence (Extended Data Fig. 4). Full activity was maintained when the base pairs flanking the modification site were exchanged, but mismatches were not tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 4d). The predicted stem loop in the ribozyme core was stabilized by a UUCG tetraloop.\ntheir own modification, for example, via self-alkylation with electrophilic iodoacetyl groups27,28 or reactive epoxide probes29,30. The most recent addition to the repertoire of RNA-catalysed reactions concerns site-specific RNA methylation. The in vitro-selected methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 uses O6-methylguanine (m6G) as cofactor31,32, and a split riboswitch uses an engineered ligand O6-methyl pre-queuosine (m6preQ1)\n33 to methylate their RNA targets at the Watson\u2013 Crick base-pairing face to produce m1A (ref. 31) and m3C (ref. 33), respectively. Self-methylation at the Hoogsteen edge to install m7G was achieved by an in vitro-selected copper ion-dependent ribozyme that uses native SAM as cofactor34. In analogy to chemoenzymatic MTase engineering, these recently reported methyltransferase ribozymes have high potential to be repurposed for RNA labelling. However, only MTR1 has so far been addressed to a variety of RNA target sequences, including tRNAs, and m6preQ1- and SAM-dependent ribozymes suffer from a severely restricted sequence scope.\nIn this Article we report a ribozyme that catalyses the sequencespecific transfer of a propargyl group from bioorthogonal SAM analogues to the minor groove side of a specific adenine in various RNA target sequences. We explore the scope of the bioorthogonal SAM analogue-utilizing ribozyme and find that the catalytic activity is retained even at low Mg2+ concentrations. This feature enables the intracellular site-specific RNA modification upon expression of the ribozyme in living human cells."

Double-activated cofactor analogues contain an unsaturated bond at the \u03b2 carbon to stabi lize the transition state by hyperconjugation and to rescue the reduced reaction rates compared to the transfer of a methyl group37. To further increase the reactivity for the nucleophilic attack, the sulfur centre was replaced by selenium, and propargylated adenosyl selenomethionine (ProSeAM, also known as SeAdoYn) has become a heavily investigated cofactor for MTase protein enzymes38,39. A similar approach using artificial SAM analogues would be attractive for alkyltransferase ribozymes, but the rather poor chemical stability of ProSeAM and its analogues limits their utility as reagents for in vitro selection of catalytic RNA. Several pathways contribute to the spontaneous decomposition in aqueous environment40. Propargylated SAM undergoes rapid hydration of the triple bond at physiological pH, probably via an allene intermediate, and the major decomposition pathway for ProSeAM at physiological pH involves an intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the carboxylate group, resulting in breaking the weak selenium\u2013carbon bond19. This intramolecular lactonization of the 2-aminobutyrate moiety affords the by-products homoserine lactone and Se-propargyl-5\u2032-selenoadenosine (Fig. 1b). To avoid this side reaction, we designed a more stable and bioorthogonal propargylic SAM analogue, which we termed ProSeDMA (for propargylic Se-2,6-diaminopurinribosyl-selenomethionineamide) (Fig. 1c). The nucleophilic carboxylate was replaced by an amide group to prevent the intramolecular SN2 reaction. In addition, 2-aminoadenosine (also known as 2,6-diaminopurine riboside, rDAP) was used as the nucleoside, with the aim to increase the binding affinity between cofactor and ribozyme by introducing an extra hydrogen-bond donor. The chemical synthesis of ProSeDMA involved four steps, starting from the protected \u03b1-aminoamide alcohol 1, via transformation to the selenohomocystine amide 3 (Fig. 1d). After reduction of the diselenide, reaction with 5\u2032-chloro-rDAP afforded the selenoether 4. The propargyl group was installed by alkylation in the presence of a Lewis acid, and ProSeDMA (5) was purified by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC.

The substrate RNAs with 1-deazaadenosine (c1A) or 7-deazaadenosine (c7A) showed similar reactivity to unmodified adenosine. The RNA with 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine (dA) showed two products of lower intensity (31% and 24%). By contrast, the RNA containing 3-deazaadenosine (c3A) did not give any modified product. These results strongly suggest that the N3 nitrogen is essential for catalytic activity, whereas N1 and N7 are dispensable.\nAlkylation of adenosine at N3 in DNA is known to cause depurination41, and the second product observed with the dA-containing substrate is consistent with the formation of an abasic site. This mechanism is exploited by DNA targeting natural products and minor groove-binding cytotoxic agents42. In contrast, N3 alkylation of adenosine in RNA has barely been investigated, despite its biological importance43 and the mechanistic involvement of adenine-N3 in natural ribozymes44. Thus, to further characterize the product produced by SAMURI, the modified RNA was analysed by MS (Fig. 2f). The addition of a propargyl group to the target RNA (+38 Da) was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI\u2013TOF) mass analysis when the modified RNA was directly measured after the reaction. Surprisingly, after purification by denaturing PAGE, the mass spectrum of the modified RNA showed a loss of 10 Da. This RNA could still undergo CuAAC with biotin azide, confirming that the propargyl group was still intact (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the propargylated RNAs containing c1A and c7A showed the expected mass of +38 Da, but not the +28 Da product that was observed for the parent adenosine (Extended Data Fig. 5). Instead, the electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS trace of the alkylated c1A sample showed a depurinated fragment, which was not seen for the c7A sample. Combining the results of atomic mutagenesis and mass analysis, a plausible modification process for adenosine is presented in Fig. 2g. SAMURI-catalysed alkylation of the N3 nitrogen enhances the electrophilicity of C2 for the attack of water, which results in ring opening followed by deformylation to produce a stable propargylated aminoimidazole nucleoside as product. The absence of the N1 nitrogen in c1A prevents ring opening, but results in a weaker glycosidic bond, while the missing N7 nitrogen in c7A prevents depurination.\nTo further confirm these mechanistic hypotheses, the PAGEpurified propargylated RNA was digested with snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD) and alkaline phosphatase enzymes, and the mononucleoside mixture was analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS; Fig. 2h). Interestingly, no new peak was detected in the UV chromatogram at 260 nm in addition to the standard four nucleosides, but the intensity of the adenosine peak was decreased. This result suggested that, upon reaction, the absorption of adenosine at 260 nm was reduced or lost, which is consistent with the proposed imidazole riboside depicted in Fig. 2g. Indeed, the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) detected nucleoside 12 at 14 min (m/z 296.13), which was overlapped with the guanosine peak. The masses of the direct N3-alkylation product 10 (m/z 306.12) and the formyl intermediate 11 were not found after the digestion. For reference, we also recorded LC-MS spectra of stable isomers of 3-propargyladenosine 10, namely 1-propargyladenosine (p1A), 2\u2032-O-propargyladenosine (pO2A) and N6-propargyladenosine (p6A), which showed the expected EIC at m/z 306.12 at three different retention times. Based on the combined results\nof atomic mutagenesis and MS, we conclude that SAMURI catalyses the transfer of the propargyl group from ProSeDMA to the N3 nitrogen of the unpaired adenosine A9 in the target RNA.\nKinetics and substrate scope of SAMURI Next, we evaluated the specificity and reactivity of SAMURI under various reaction conditions. To rule out uncatalysed background reactions, we incubated substrate RNA with ProSeDMA at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M. In the absence of ribozyme, we did not observe any non-specific propargylation (Fig. 3a). Following the addition of SAMURI, the trans-propargylation was highly efficient, not only at the ProSeDMA concentration of 5 \u00b5M, which was used during in vitro selection, but also at the fivefold lower concentration of 1 \u00b5M (Fig. 3b), which still produced more than 60% product after 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. With 10 \u00b5M ProSeDMA and 10 mM Mg2+, quantitative propargylation was achieved with an observed rate constant kobs of 0.12 min\n\u22121. Importantly, SAMURI retained its catalytic activity at physiological Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 3c). The reaction rate was dependent on ProSeDMA concentration, with an apparent Km, app of 32 \u00b5M at 0.5 mM Mg\n2+, and 3.7-fold tighter binding at 10 mM Mg2+ (Km, app = 8.9 \u00b5M) (Fig. 3d,e).\nTo explore the interactions between the cofactor and ribozyme, we evaluated the reactivity of different SeDMA derivatives (Fig. 3f). We found that alkylation of the terminal amide was tolerated well. Dimethylamide 8 reacted almost as efficiently as the parent cofactor 5, suggesting that the terminal amide is not strictly recognized within the catalytic core. In contrast, replacement of the \u03b1-amino group by an \u03b1-hydroxyl group (cofactor 9) decreased the activity of the ribozyme, suggesting that the protonation state of the \u03b1-amino group is important for interaction. Together, these results suggested that the selenomethionine amino-acid side chain of ProSeAM may also be tolerated. Indeed, 60% propargylation was observed with 10 \u00b5M ProSeAM within 1 h (Fig. 3f).\nNext, we examined the scope of alkyl groups that can be transferred by SAMURI. Allyl derivative 7, containing an sp2 carbon in the \u03b2 position to selenium, showed similar reactivity to ProSeDMA (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6). On the other hand, the reaction with methyl derivative 6 was slowed down, indicating that the electrophilicity of the \u03b1 carbon is dominant over the steric demand of the transferred alkyl group. At the standard concentration of 10 \u00b5M MeSeDMA, ~20% methylated RNA product was formed after 24 h. The methylated and allylated RNAs were confirmed by MS of intact RNA, and by LC-MS after digestion of the products into mononucleosides. Interestingly, we found differences in the stability of the N3-alkylated adenosines. In both cases of methyl or allyl modification, intact N3-alkylated adenosine was observed in addition to the hydrated and deformylated products (Extended Data Fig. 7).\nAlthough the methylation rate with MeSeDMA was ~600-fold slower than propargylation with ProSeDMA, the above results suggested that native SAM could also be a productive cofactor for SAMURI. Indeed, methylated RNA product was observed upon incubation of the target RNA with SAMURI and SAM; however, compared to MeSeDMA, a much higher concentration of 3 mM SAM was required to reach comparable methylation levels. Similarly, the 2,6-diaminopurine analogue\nFig. 2 | Identification and analysis of ProSeDMA utilizing ribozyme (SAMURI). a, Schematic of SAMURI-catalysed trans-propargylation to target adenosine. b, Sequence and predicted secondary structure of SAMURI. c, Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE, top) and anion-exchange HPLC analysis (bottom) of the SAMURI-catalysed reaction of 17-mer substrate RNA (S, 5\u2032-ACAUACUGAG CCUUCAA-3\u2032) with and without ProSeDMA at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h; 1 \u00b5M substrate RNA, 1 \u00b5M SAMURI, 10 \u00b5M ProSeDMA and 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5.

From these results we conclude that SAM is not a competitive inhibitor of SAMURI, which is an important finding for intracellular applications.

            "text": "The findings that SAMURI was still active at low Mg2+ concentrations and was not inhibited by SAM encouraged the investigation of RNAcatalysed RNA propargylation in living cells. To explore this possibility, we designed plasmids for the expression of SAMURI in human cells. The cis-active SAMURI was placed in the F30 scaffold46 together with the fluorogenic aptamer Broccoli47 and the Tornado system for the production of circular RNA (cSAMURI, Fig. 4a), which has been shown to improve the stability of expressed functional RNAs in mammalian cells48. The SAMURI-encoding plasmid was transfected in HEK293T cells and, after 48-h incubation, the expression of target ribozyme was visualized by staining the Broccoli aptamer with DFHBI-1T (Fig. 4b).\nThe cSAMURI-expressing cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ProSeDMA in growth medium (from 100 \u00b5M to 3 mM). Cell viability was not decreased under these conditions, suggesting that ProSeDMA is not strongly cytotoxic in this concentration range (Fig. 4c). We also estimated the cofactor uptake via LC-MS analysis of cleared cell lysate from untransfected cells (Extended Data Fig. 8). Using a calibration curve for the extracted ion count of ProSeDMA in cell lysate (generated by known spiked concentrations), we found ~3 nmol ProSeDMA per 106 cells that were incubated in medium containing 1 mM ProSeDMA. These numbers are of the same order of magnitude as reported for bioorthogonal SAM analogues produced intracellularly from membrane-permeable amino acids and engineered SAM synthetases18. Therefore, ProSeDMA was sufficiently available for cSAMURI-expressing cells, from which total RNA was isolated and analysed. The intracellularly propargylated cis-active SAMURI was labelled with Cy5 azide, followed by visualization with in-gel fluorescence (Fig. 4d). The Cy5 channel image showed only one band, and its intensity increased with increasing concentrations of ProSeDMA in the medium. The same gel was stained by SYBR Gold to visualize total cellular RNA. The image shows the expected abundant cellular RNAs, such as transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, and an additional band migrating approximately at the size of the 200-nt marker, which appeared only when the cells were transfected with the plasmid. This band stained with DFHBI-1T and represents the cyclized cis-active SAMURI-Broccoli-Tornado construct (cSAMURI). As expected, the ProSeDMA dose-dependent Cy5 signal (red) colocalized with the DFHBI-1T signal (green), indicated by the merged yellow colour in the multi-channel image of Cy5 and DFHBI-1T in Fig. 4d.\nkobs values were obtained under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions for 60 min. For MeSeDMA, SAM and SDM, incubation was extended to 24 h, and a linear fit was applied because of the low reactivity. All cofactors were used at 10 \u00b5M, except for SAM and SDM, which were used at 3 mM. g, Inhibition assay: SAMURI trans-propargylation activity was not inhibited by SAM. Conditions are as in c, with increasing concentrations of SAM as indicated. a,b,c,f show representative images of three independent experiments, with similar results. In d,e,g, individual data points and the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three independent experiments are shown.\nNature Chemistry | Volume 15 | November 2023 | 1523\u20131531 1529\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-023-01320-z\nFor comparison of the labelling efficiency, total RNA was also extracted from transfected cells that produced cSAMURI but were grown in the absence of ProSeDMA. The isolated RNA was then treated with the cofactor in vitro, followed by click labelling with Cy5. Using the normalized Cy5/DFHBI-1T ratio, we estimate that ~17% of cSAMURI was propargylated in the cell (Fig. 4e). Comparison to an in vitro-transcribed RNA, which was enzymatically processed and circularized, showed that the cSAMURI extracted from HEK293T cells retained its activity in the presence of total RNA. Overall, these results are encouraging for the future development of SAMURI as a self-labelling tag for any RNA of interest and for engineering trans-active SAMURI variants to target endogenous RNAs, similar to approaches recently shown for F30-MTR1 targeting Escherichia coli transfer RNA31, and circular ADAR-recruiting guide RNAs (cadRNAs)49 to target mRNAs."

            "text": "In summary, we have reported SAMURI as an alkyltransferase ribozyme in combination with ProSeDMA as a bioorthogonal and stabilized SAM analogue. The replacement of the terminal carboxylic acid by an amide improved the chemical stability of ProSeDMA compared to previously reported propargylic SAM and SeAM derivatives. The catalytic activity of SAMURI was demonstrated in vitro and in living cells. The successful intracellular application was possible due to the low toxicity of ProSeDMA and the high activity of SAMURI under physiological Mg2+ concentrations. Using atomic mutagenesis and MS, we fully characterized the RNA-catalysed reaction of SAMURI and found that the modification occurred at N3 of an unpaired adenosine between the binding arms. Although N3-alkylated adenosines are usually prone to depurination, we found that the enhanced electrophilicity\nDFHBI-1T =\nCy5-N3 CuAAC\ncSAMURI\n1)\n2)\nCell lysis\nRNA extraction\nProSeDMA\nBroccoli\nTornadoSAMURI\nHEK293T\npAV-U6+27\nTornado SAMURIBroccoli\nTornado\nU6 promoter\na\nCy5\nBroccoli\nTrans-propargylation\nCell\nc d\ne\nDFHBI-1T stain\n100 \u00b5m\nM SYBR Goldnt\n800 600 400 300 200\n100\nProSeDMA: Plasmid: \u2013 + + + + + 0.10.1 0.5 1 30\nCy5\nMerge Cy5 + DFHBI-1T\n\u2013 + + + + + 0.10.1 0.5 1 30(mM) (mM)\nProSeDMA (mM) 0.1 0.5 1 3\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\nRN A\nm od\n. r el\n.

Thus, SAMURI introduces the propargyl group site-specifically as a small clickable tag for RNA labelling. Moreover, SAMURI is permissive to ProSeDMA analogues, and can even use native SAM to synthesize m3A in RNA, which is a challenging chemical modification that cannot be prepared by solid-phase synthesis. This work expands the known repertoire of RNA-catalysed RNA modification reactions and suggests that appropriately designed cofactors and fine-tuned in vitro selection strategies are likely to create additional RNA-modifying ribozymes in the future. Desirable new ribozyme and cofactor combinations could then also enable strain-promoted click chemistry for applications in which the need for copper ions with the here-described propargyl groups is of any concern. Given the increasing importance of RNA technologies, we envision SAMURI to become a useful tool for RNA labelling and for studying the biology of damaged nucleobases in RNA."

Solvent A was 10 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.3), solvent B was MeCN and the flow rate was 0.2 ml min\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C with UV detection at 260 nm and online MS in a microTOF-Q III system in positive-ion mode.\nKinetic assays of SAMURI-catalysed trans-alkylation reactions We mixed 10 pmol of Cy5-labelled RNA and 100 pmol of SAMURI in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 120 mM KCl and 5 mM NaCl). After an annealing step (3 min at 95 \u00b0C and 10 min at 25 \u00b0C), 10 mM MgCl2 and 100 pmol of cofactor were added and the water was filled up until the total volume was 10 \u00b5l. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 1 \u00b5l aliquots were taken at desired time points and quenched by adding 4 \u00b5l of stop solution (80% formamide, 89 mM Tris-HCl, 89 mM boric acid and 50 mM EDTA). Each time-point sample was analysed by denaturing PAGE (20% polyacrylamide), and the band intensities were quantified by fluorescence imaging using a 695/55-nm emission filter. The yield versus time data were fitted to Y = Ymax(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212kobst) using Origin (2019). All kinetic assays were carried out as three independent replicates. For determination of apparent Km values, kobs was determined with different concentrations of ProSeDMA and the kobs versus concentration data were fitted using the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation.\nConstruction of cis-active SAMURI containing plasmids The insert of cis-active SAMURI was prepared by overlap extension of amplicon from previously reported plasmid31 and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (details are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1). The insert DNA was cloned between the NotI and SacII sites of pAV-U6 + 27-Tornado\u2013Broccoli (Addgene plasmid no. 25709). The sequence of the insert and successful ligation into the plasmid were confirmed by Sanger sequencing."

After 24 h, the medium was replaced by 0.5 ml OptiMEM containing 0.1\u20133 mM ProSeDMA and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and the cells were incubated for 6 h. The cells were then extensively washed with PBS and mixed with 0.4% trypan blue solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 1:1 ratio. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, total and stained cells were counted and cell viability was calculated as (1 \u2212 (number of stained cells/number of total cells)) \u00d7 100 (%).\nAnalysis of cellular uptake of ProSeDMA by LC-MS HEK293T cells were seeded in a 12-well culture plate and grown for 24 h.

The incubated cells were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and suspended in 200 \u00b5l of 50% methanol + 0.1% formic acid. The suspended cells were completely disrupted by sonication. The resulting cell lysate was extracted with 200 \u00b5l of chloroform and the water phase was evaporated. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in 100 \u00b5l of H2O containing 0.1% formic acid. After filtration, 50 \u00b5l of the sample was injected into an LC/MS system using an RP-column (NUCLEOSIL 100-5 C18 column, 5 \u00b5m, 125 \u00d7 4 mm). The analysis was run with a linear gradient of B: conc. 3% (0\u201315 min), 3\u201323% (15\u201330 min); solvent A was H2O + 0.1% formic acid, solvent B was MeCN + 0.1% formic acid and the flow rate was 0.2 ml min\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C with UV detection at 260 nm. The micrOTOF-Q III with an ESI ion source was operated in positive-ion mode (MS range, 50\u20132,500), with a capillary voltage of 4.5 kV, end plate offset of 500 V, nitrogen nebulizer pressure of 1.4 bar, dry gas flow of 9 l min\u22121 and dry temperature of 200 \u00b0C. Data were analysed with Data Analysis software DA 4.2 (Bruker Daltonics). For the calibration curve, multiple concentrations of ProSeDMA (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 2.5 and 5 nmol) were spiked into cell lysate generated from cells that were not treated with ProSeDMA, and the peak areas of the ProSeDMA extracted ion chromatograms were plotted against the ProSeDMA amount injected. The slope was determined and used for calculation of the concentration of ProSeDMA in the lysate of cells that were fed with ProSeDMA in the medium.\nIntracellular activity assay of cis-active ribozyme After transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h and then the medium was replaced by 1 ml of OptiMEM containing 0.1\u20133 mM ProSeDMA, 5 \u00b5g ml\u22121 actD (RNA transcription inhibitor) and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). After 6 h of incubation, the cells were extensively washed and total RNAs were collected by Trizol LS reagent. The collected RNA was labelled by the CuAAC reaction (200 ng RNA, 500 \u00b5M CuBr, 1 mM TBTA and 1 mM Cy5 azide were incubated in H2O/DMSO/\ntBuOH = 5/3/1 solution at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Labelled RNAs were analysed by 5% denaturing PAGE, and the gel was imaged in the Cy5 channel before staining with DFHBI-1T and SYBR Gold. The band intensities were quantified and the intracellular activity was calculated from the Cy5/DFHBI-1T ratio, relative to the in vitro labelling efficiency of total RNA extracted from cells that were not treated with ProSeDMA. This control was prepared by labelling in the test tube (200 ng total RNA, 50 \u00b5M ProSeDMA and 10 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h)."
