Longitudinal Study on Coping Mechanisms and Quality of Life in ITP Patients Over Time: Given the indication that patients diagnosed with ITP longer ago cope better with their condition, a longitudinal study could focus on identifying effective coping mechanisms and how these evolve over time. This research could explore interventions that facilitate quicker adaptation to the disease and improve quality of life.

The Role of Sleep Disorders in ITP-Related Fatigue: The observed connection between fatigue and sleep-related disorders like OSAS and hypersomnia in ITP patients is a novel finding that warrants further exploration. A study could be designed to specifically investigate the causal relationship between sleep disorders and fatigue in ITP, potentially including interventions to improve sleep quality and assess the impact on fatigue levels.

Comprehensive Analysis of Depression and Anxiety in ITP Patients: Since the study highlighted a potentially high prevalence of depression and signs of anxiety among ITP patients, future research could aim to more comprehensively understand the psychological impact of ITP. This could include the effectiveness of various psychological interventions or therapies in managing these mental health challenges.

Impact of Nutritional and Lifestyle Interventions on ITP Symptoms and Comorbidities: Given the multifactorial nature of fatigue in ITP patients, research into the effects of nutritional and lifestyle changes could be beneficial. Studies could explore how diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle modifications influence fatigue, sleep quality, and mental health in individuals with ITP.

Investigation of Biomarkers and Their Correlation with ITP Symptoms and Severity: The paper suggests a significant correlation between fatigue and certain biomarkers like ferritin, but not with platelet count. Future research could expand on this by exploring other potential biomarkers and their association with the severity of ITP symptoms, treatment responses, and comorbidities. This could help in the development of more targeted and personalized treatment strategies.
