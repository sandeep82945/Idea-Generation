    "abstractText": "The pnictogen bond, a somewhat overlooked supramolecular chemical synthon known since the middle of the last century, is one of the promising types of non-covalent interactions yet to be fully understood by recognizing and exploiting its properties for the rational design of novel functional materials. Its bonding modes, energy profiles, vibrational structures and charge density topologies, among others, have yet to be comprehensively delineated, both theoretically and experimentally. In this overview, attention is largely centered on the nature of nitrogen-centered pnictogen bonds found in organic-inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites and closely related structures deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and the Inorganic Chemistry Structural Database (ICSD). Focusing on well-characterized structures, it is shown that it is not merely charge-assisted hydrogen bonds that stabilize the inorganic frameworks, as widely assumed and welldocumented, but simultaneously nitrogen-centered pnictogen bonding, and, depending on the atomic constituents of the organic cation, other non-covalent interactions such as halogen bonding and/or tetrel bonding, are also contributors to the stabilizing of a variety of materials in the solid state. We have shown that competition between pnictogen bonding and other interactions plays an important role in determining the tilting of the MX6 (X = a halogen) octahedra of metal halide perovskites in one, two and three-dimensions. The pnictogen interactions are identified to be directional even in zero-dimensional crystals, a structural feature in many engineered ordered materials; hence an interplay between them and other non-covalent interactions drives the structure and the functional properties of perovskite materials and enabling their application in, for example, photovoltaics and optoelectronics. We have demonstrated that nitrogen in ammonium and its derivatives in many chemical systems acts as a pnictogen bond donor and contributes to conferring stability, and hence functionality, to crystalline perovskite systems. The significance of these non-covalent interactions should not be overlooked, especially when the focus is centered on the rationale design and discovery of such highly-valued materials.",

Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 3 of 61\noptoelectronic materials (Scheme 2). The presence of cations such as these, often referred to as spacers, or additives, stabilizes the inorganic frameworks, and hence plays a structuredetermining role during the synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid materials and is responsible for their functionality. Lower-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid metal trihalide perovskite semiconductors are prominent examples. In these, bifunctional organoammonium cations X(CH2)2NH3+ (X = OH, Cl, Br, I, CN) control the in- and out-of-plane distortions of X(CH2)2NH3)2PbI4 perovskites [22]. The family of \u2329100\u232a-oriented layered perovskites with general formula (RNH3)2An\u20131BnX3n+1 are obtained by taking n layers along the \u2329100\u232a direction of the parent structure [22]. A search for the fragment \u201c\u2013CH2\u2013 CH2\u2013CH2\u2013NH3\u201d in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD [23,24]) led to 3656 hits; that for the fragment \u201c\u2013X\u2013C\u2013NH3\u201d or \u201cX\u2013CH2\u2013NH3\u201d (X = any atom) led to 16,834 and 9509 hits, respectively, illustrating the wide occurrence of structures featuring an RNH3+ entity. Although a few studies have discussed the importance of pnictogen bonding in the metal trihalide perovskite semiconductors (for example [25,26]), in addition to other non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and tetrel bonding [27\u201329], our exploration of the geometry of a variety of crystal structures suggests that the occurrence of nitrogen-centered pnictogen bonding in these systems is very common and that it plays an important role in their structural integrity. This overview is therefore focused on exploring representative crystal structures deposited in the CSD and the Inorganic Chemistry Structural Database (ICSD) [30,31] in which covalently bound positively-charged nitrogen contributes in part to their structural stability through inter- or intra-molecular non-covalent interactions. In many cases, we attribute the attraction between N and the negative site as a charge-assisted nitrogencentered pnictogen bond (or simply, nitrogen bond [10]). This could be either a \u03c3-hole centered or a \u03c0-hole centered nitrogen bonding interaction. A \u03c3-hole on an atom A is recognized along the extension of the R\u2013A covalent bond, and is deficient in electron density, where R is the remainder part of the molecular entity [32,33]. A \u03c0-hole can be recognized on an atom (for example, N in NO3\u2212), or on a molecular fragment (for example, the central portion of the C\u2261C bond in acetylene), or at the center of a delocalized system (such as an arene moiety) that has the ability to accept electron density from a lone-pair on a Lewis base (such as O in H2O and N in NH3). Examples of this have been discussed elsewhere [10,34\u201336]. Our survey included only single crystals in the CSD and ICSD that were free of errors and distortions, and that had an R-factor \u2264 0.1. A statistical analysis was performed using the geometric data obtained from this survey, which is presented before the conclusions section. The nitrogen bond, or a covalently bound nitrogen-centered pnictogen bond, in chemical systems occurs when there is evidence of a net attractive interaction between the electrophilic region associated with a covalently or coordinately bound nitrogen atom in a molecular entity and a nucleophile in another, or the same, molecular entity. It is the first member of the family of pnictogen bonds formed by the first atom of the pnictogen family, Group 15, of the periodic table, and is an inter- or intra-molecular non-covalent interaction [10]. The possible occurrence of pnictogen bonds in many crystal lattices, formed by covalently bound nitrogen [10,33], phosphorous [33,35], arsenic [33,34], antimony [36] and bismuth [37], has already been discussed recently.\nInt.

J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 5 of 61\nthe putative interaction [42,43]; (3) the positive nature of the electrostatic potential on the surface of N in molecular entities and its engagement with a negative site [10]; and (4) the existence of promolecular charge density-based isosurface volumes between the bonded atomic basins [44,45]. While our discussion is largely focused on the utilization of 1 and 2 in identifying pnictogen bonding in the illustrative crystal systems, the latter two properties were computed for some chosen systems to confirm the occurrence of such interactions between molecular entities that play any appreciable role in the overall stability of the crystal lattice, and hence in the functionality of these materials. Application of the four features above has been informative in rationalizing inter- and intra-molecular interactions of various kinds [10,34\u201336,38,42] in a variety of chemical systems, and hence further demonstration is unnecessary. We note that the appearance of N-centered pnictogen bonding in the illustrative crystals is usually accompanied by hydrogen bonds. In the majority of the crystals explored, we found that these are stronger than the nitrogen bonds; it is therefore reasonable to conclude that they are usually the cause, and that the emergence of nitrogen bonding is probably an effect. This overview is structured as follows. Following the Computational Details section, we provide examples of illustrative crystal systems featuring the wide occurrence of N-centered pnictogen bonds. This section comprises subsections that highlight 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D crystals, the dimension of the inorganic framework in the organic-organic frameworks. Prior to the Conclusion section, we include a section that shows the frequency of the various N-center pnictogen binding interactions that occur in crystals. Electron density donors of different types are considered in this section."

            "text": "Ammonium and its derivatives (see Scheme 2) are entirely positive. This means that both the H and N atoms in NH4+, as well as the \u2013CH2\u2013 and \u2013CH3 fragments in the derivatives of mono-, di-, tri- and multi-ammonium molecular entities are all positive. Depending on the nature of the (R\u2013CH2\u2013)n fragment in [R\u2013(CH2)n\u2013NH3]n+ (R = H, X, NH3 and CH3, etc.), the potential on the electrostatic surface of each constituent species differs from other species. Therefore, it is not necessary to compute the electrostatic potential on the surface of the organic cation contributing to the structural integrity of the organicinorganic crystal lattices that are shown in the following section. Even so, we have chosen a few organic cations to show that the electrostatic potential on their surfaces differs from one atomic domain to the another that constitute the molecular cation. Ab initio calculations at the MP2(FC) level theory [46,47] were performed on a selected number of organic cations in combination with Dunning\u2019s Aug-CC-pVTZ basis set system [48,49] to obtain their equilibrium geometries; FC refers to the frozen core approximation. Frequency calculations were also performed for each of them, and positive eigenvalues were found. Using fully optimized geometries, we used the resulting wavefunctions to calculate the electrostatic surface potential of the molecular entities. The Gaussian 16 suit of programs was used [50]. The 0.001 a.u. (electrons Bohr\u22123) isoelectron density envelope that arbitrarily defines the van der Waals surface of a molecular entity was used on which to calculate the potential. The details of the Molecular Electrostatic Surface Potential (MESP) have been exhaustively described [32,33,38,51\u201355] and will therefore not be repeated here. In essence, the MESP model features two extrema, VS,min and VS,max, called the local most minimum and the local most maximum of potential, respectively, that can be found on the electrostatic surface of a molecular entity. The sign and magnitude enable us to gain insight into the electrophilic and nucleophilic character and strength of specific regions on the surface of a molecular entity, respectively [54,55]. In particular, when VS,min or VS,max is positive (i.e., VS,min > 0 or VS,max > 0), they each represent regions that are electrophilic [10,34\u201336,42]. Similarly, when both are negative (i.e., VS,min < 0 or VS,max < 0), they represent regions that are nucleophilic. When a positive VS,max appears along the outer extension of an R\u2013A covalent or coordinate bond, it is called a \u03c3-hole (as on C\u2013X bond extensions in C6X6\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 6 of 61\n(X = F, Cl, Br, I)) [56\u201359]. A \u03c3-hole on atom A can be positive, negative or neutral, and is an electron density deficient region, along the extension of an R\u2013A covalent, or coordinate bond, that is more positive relative to the lateral portions of A [32,55]. However, when a VS,min > 0 is found on an R\u2013A covalent, or coordinate, bond extension, it may represent an electron deficient region that could be positive [34]; it would not be regarded as a \u03c0-hole since its location is not perpendicular to the bond axis. A VS,min > 0 occurs, for instance, along the extension of the bond in a P\u2261P molecule, as well as in an As2, Sb2 or Bi2 molecule [34\u201336]. When a positive region with VS,min < 0 or VS,max < 0 is close to a region described by VS,min > 0 or VS,max > 0, the formation of a non-covalent interaction is likely to occur. There have been instances found in which interacting regions with negative VS,max [60,61] (or positive VS,max [62]) along bond extensions can engage in forming non-covalent interactions. A \u03c0-hole is an electron density deficient region, which is generally associated with a region on the surface of a molecular entity that lies orthogonal to the bond axis (such as on the centroid region of a C6H6 or C6X6 molecule). In this overview, we are interested in the characterization of pnictogen bonds between interacting entities in some illustrative crystals. To this end, we selected monomeric entities in several crystals. We analyzed the promolecular charge density-based isosurface calculated by the Independent Gradient Model, IGM-\u03b4g promolecular framework [44,45] to strengthen our identification of chemical bonded interactions as revealed using intermolecular geometry and the conceptual framework of the MESP model as described above. IGM-\u03b4g has already been shown in several studies [10,35,36,42] to be useful in providing an insightful, local description of the source of the atomic or fragmentary domain that is involved in an interaction. Within the framework of IGM, the atomic electron densities of pro-molecules are summed, and the associated atomic gradients do not interfere. This is achieved by using absolute values for the sum of the atomic gradients and eliminating any electron gradient contragradience feature. The resulting total gradient |\u2207\u03c1IGM| is the upper limit of the true gradient, and the difference \u03b4g quantifies the collapse of the net electron density gradient due to the interaction. In other words, the \u03b4g descriptor identifies the existence of the opposite sign in the components of the total electron density gradient |\u2207\u03c1(r)| due to the interaction. IGM automatically separates intramolecular and interfragment interactions in a molecular entity, which can be plotted in two or three dimensions (isosurface volumes) to determine the presence of intramolecular or intramolecular interactions. From the shape of the isosurface volume, we can infer the localized or delocalized nature of the interactions. The colors of these volumes, blue and green, represent strong and weak attraction, respectively, and red represents a repulsive interaction. To clarify the nature of the interaction energy between the interacting units responsible for the crystal geometry, and which are the building blocks in the crystals, we have used two theoretical methods, MP2(FC) and \u03c9B97X-D [63], in conjunction with the def2-TZVPPD pseudopotential basis set [64], to optimize the geometries of the ion-pairs [NH3NH3][Cl]2, [CH3NH3][I], [NH4][Cl], [NH4][Br] and [NH4][I]. The uncorrected and basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrected (complexation) interaction energies, Eint and Eint(BSSE), of these ion-pairs were calculated using Equations (1) and (2), respectively. ET(ion-pair), ET(ion1), ET(ion2) and E(BSSE) are the electronic total energies of the ion-pair, ion1, ion2 and energy due to BSSE, respectively.\nEint = ET(ion-pair) \u2212 ET(ion1) \u2212 ET(ion2) (1)\nEint(BSSE) = Eint + E(BSSE) (2)\nThe quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) has been widely used to provide insight into the chemical interactions present in molecules, molecular complexes and crystals [65\u201367]. It relies on the zero-flux boundary condition for space partitioning of atomic basins in molecular entities. The bond path topology is the graphical representation of atomic domains bonded to each other. Properties such as the charge density (\u03c1b), the sign\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 7 of 61\nand magnitude of the Laplacian of the charge density (\u22072\u03c1b), the total energy density (Hb) the bond critical points have been shown to be valid indicators in the process of recognition of inter- and intra-molecular interactions. \u22072\u03c1b < 0 or \u22072\u03c1b > 0 gives an indication of whether an interaction between atomic basins has an open-shell (region with charge concentration) or a closed-shell (region with charge depletion) character [65], although \u22072\u03c1b > 0 has been identified for polar covalent bonds [68]. We have applied QTAIM to a few cases such as those mentioned above to clarify the assumed (misleading) perception that pnictogen bonding in the building blocks responsible for crystals is negligible and hence they do not make a significant contribution to the overall stability. Since the interaction energy of ion-pairs is electrostatically dominant, we used the empirical relationship, Eb = 1\u20442Vb, to calculate the energy of the pnictogen bond in the simplified ion-pairs used for illustrative purposes [69], where Vb is the potential energy density at the bond critical point (bcp); this relationship has been utilized in many studies to calculate the interaction energy of hydrogen bonds in chemical systems (for example [70,71]). Natural Bond Orbital (NBO)\u2019s Second Order Perturbation Theory Analysis of the Fock Matrix in NBO Basis [72\u201375], which is valid within the Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) approximation, provides insight into the type of charge transfer delocalization energy between the donor NBO (i) and the acceptor NBO (j). We have used a few systems to estimate the second order stabilization energy E(2) associated with delocalization i\u2192 j given by Equation (3).\nE(2) = qi [F2(i,j)/(\u03b5j \u2212 \u03b5i)] (3)\nIn Equation (3), qi is the donor orbital occupancy, \u03b5i and \u03b5j are diagonal elements (orbital energies) and F(i,j) is the off-diagonal NBO Fock matrix element. For this purpose, the Restricted Hartree\u2013Fock (RHF) method in conjunction with the split valence 6-311G* basis set was used. The complexation energy, QTAIM-based interaction energy and second order charge transfer energy were evaluated on the MP2(FC), \u03c9B97X-D and crystal geometries of the chosen ion-pairs to demonstrate the persistency of results and conclusions achieved. Analysis and drawing of geometries of various molecular entities and crystals were performed using the Mercury 4.0 [76] and VMD [77] suite of programs. AIMAll [78] and MultiWfn [79] codes were used for calculation and analysis of MESP and QTAIM graphs, and VMD [77] was used for drawing of IGM-\u03b4g based isosurfaces."

This is clearly evident in the MESP model (Figure 2); the VS,max associated with the\ntwo N atoms are equivalent due to symmetry (VS,max = 294.6 kcal mol\u22121 each).\nAlthough the MESP model provides a useful guide to identify the two types of intermolecular bonding interactions between the interacting molecular entities of the ion-pair [NH3NH3][Cl]2, the results of the IGM-\u03b4g analysis, presented in Figure 1e, strengthens the conclusion. As expected, there are two greenish isosurface volumes appearing between interacting units [NH3NH3]2+ and [Cl]\u2212 that signify the possibility of pnictogen bonding; the flat nature of the isosurface volume between N and Cl indicates the delocalized nature of this non-covalent interaction and possible formation of weak H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds. However, the QTAIM-based molecular graphs presented in Figure 1f,g, which were obtained using the geometry of the ion-pair as in the crystal and that optimized at the MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD level, respectively, provide evidence of the formation of the charge assisted N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds in [NH3NH3][Cl]2. This means that the bond path and bcp topologies do not reveal the supposedly weak hydrogen-bonded interactions between the ion-pair. This scenario is very similar to that found for the [CD3ND3][I] and [CH3NH3][I] ion-pairs discussed below. The pnictogen bond present between [NH3NH3]2+ and [Cl]\u2212 in the ion-pair in the crystal geometry is weaker than in the gas phase geometry where the intermolecular distance is markedly shorter. This explains why the bond path between N and C in Figure 1f\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 10 of 61\nis presented as a dotted line, and that in Figure 1g as a solid line, and the charge densities at the bcps of the corresponding bonds differ markedly from each other (\u03c1b 0.0144, 0.0347 and 0.0327 a.u. on the crystal, MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD, and\u03c9B97XD/def2-TZVPPD geometries of the ion-pair, respectively). Similarly, \u22072\u03c1b at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bcps of the corresponding geometries were 0.0388, 0.1422 and 0.1359 a.u., respectively. Both properties indicate the closed-shell nature of the interaction, evidenced by \u22072\u03c1b > 0 at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bcp, and small value of \u03c1b at the same bcp [65,67].\nWe have calculated the interaction energy between the ion pairs [NH3NH3]2+ and 2[Cl]\u2212\nusing the MP2(FC) optimized geometry of [NH3NH3][Cl]2. We considered ([NH3NH3][Cl])+ as one fragment and [Cl]\u2212 as another fragment to assess the interaction of a single charge assisted N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bond. The uncorrected and basis-set-corrected interaction energies, Eint and Eint(BSSE), respectively, were calculated to be \u2013145.64 and \u2013144.10 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. The effect of BSSE on energy is marginal; the large interaction energy is largely due to cation\u2013anion electrostatic interaction. This can be effectively rationalized based on the interaction energy of each N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bond in the ion-pair evaluated using the empirical relationship, Eb = 1\u20442Vb, which was \u201311.45, \u201310.10 and \u20132.60 kcal mol\u22121 when the geometry of the ion-pair optimized with MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD,\u03c9B97XD/def2-TZVPPD and that in the crystal was used, respectively. These energies correlate well with the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl intermolecular bond distance of 2.572, 2.595 and 3.065 \u00c5 in the corresponding ion-pair geometry, respectively. Second order NBO analysis at RHF/6-311G* enabled us to demonstrate that the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bond in NH3NH3Cl2 is indeed stronger than the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds. Because the latter ones were very weak, they were unidentifiable via the bond path and bcp topologies of QTAIM (Figure 1f,g). There are two equivalent N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds formed by each end N site in NH3NH32+ and the two interacting Cl ions situated along the extension of the N\u2013N bond axis. The \u03c9B97XD/def2-TZVPPD optimized gas phase geometry has resulted in hyperconjugations of two types, [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013N] and [LP(4)Cl \u2192 RY*(1)N], that describe each of the two N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds in [NH3NH3][Cl]2, where LP and BD* refer to the lone-pair and anti-bonding orbitals, respectively. These two hyperconjugative interactions are accompanied with E(2) of 10.95 and 6.16 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. Similarly, the hyperconjugations associated with two pairs of six N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds are described by [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H] and [LP(2)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H] charge transfer delocalizations, with E(2) of 1.24 and 1.28, respectively. The [LP(3)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H] delocalization is also feasible in the system between the interacting units, with E(2) of 0.43 kcal mol\u22121 for two and 1.71 kcal mol\u22121 for the remaining hydrogen bonds. When the crystal geometry of the ion-pair was used, the two types of non-covalent interactions remain identifiable. The only difference is that the magnitude of E(2) is greatly reduced. This is understandable since the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl intermolecular distance in the gas phase geometry is shorter than that in the crystal geometry. The E(2) associated with [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013N] and [LP(4)Cl\u2192 RY*(1)N], where RY refers to a Rydberg type orbital, which accompany each of the two pnictogen bonds, were 4.33 and 3.03 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. The charge transfer interactions associated with the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds were about 0.1 kcal mol\u22121. These results show that the pnictogen bonds in the [NH3NH3][Cl]2 ion-pair are stronger than the hydrogen bonds. Since this study was primarily centered on pnictogen bonds, we did not explore the conformational details of hydrogen bonds, such as those shown in Figure 1b, that also play an important role in the effective stabilization of the crystal lattice."

Monovalent MA is entirely electrophilic. A simple CSD search for this organic cation yielded 931 hits, showing its prominent role in the design of materials. Along with its derivatives, it appears prominently in the lead trihalide perovskites,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 11 of 61\nviz. CH3NH3MX3 (M = Pb, Sn, Ge; X = Cl, Br, I). These materials have a band gap in the range 1.2\u20133.5 eV [26,84] in the far infrared to visible region, making some of them suitable for application in solar cells. However, the actual role of the organic cation in CH3NH3MX3 perovskites is not yet fully understood [85], despite numerous experimental and computational studies on this topic that have been reported. It has been suggested that the stability of the crystal structure of CH3NH3MX3 single perovskites is driven by H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonds formed between the ammonium guest and the halide of the MX6 octahedra [25,26]. However, we have recently argued [25,26] that this is incorrect for orthorhombic CH3NH3MX3 (X = Br, I), since the overall geometric stability of these crystals arises from an environment consisting of an interplay between hydrogen, carbon and pnictogen bonded interactions. These are collectively responsible for the octahedral tilt in the low-temperature Pnma orthorhombic (o) phase of the CH3NH3PbI3 system. We show below that this feature also holds for other members of the same family. The structures of o-CH3ND3PbCl3, o-CH3ND3PbBr3, and o-CD6ND6PbCl3 are shown in Figure 3a\u2013c. They are stable at low temperature and adopt an orthorhombic crystal symmetry with tilting of the PbX6 octahedra with the organic cation trapped inside the inorganic cage. There are a variety of N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonds in each of these crystals; these are probably the primary interactions. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 66\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 12 of 61\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 66\nThe primary intermolecular interactions in these crystals are charge-assisted, and strong. There are also secondary interactions that appear as pnictogen bonds and tetrel bonds (N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively). These are somewhat longer, and therefore weaker, than the primary interactions. Based upon the bond distances, the stability of these interactions is in the order (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X > (C)H/D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X > N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X > C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X (X = Br, I). For instance, in o-CD3ND3PbI3 [88] the shortest (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I bonds (and (\u2220N\u2013D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I angles) formed by each ammonium head are 2.672 (174.6\u25e6), 2.784 (147.3\u25e6) and 2.784 \u00c5 (147.3\u25e6); the three (C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I bonds (and (\u2220C\u2013D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I angles) formed by the methyl head are 3.260 (177.1\u25e6), 3.175 (148.6\u25e6) and 3.175 \u00c5 (148.6\u25e6); and the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I close contacts (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and \u2220N\u2013C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I angles) have distances (bond angles) of 3.778 (153.0\u25e6) and 3.980 \u00c5 (146.4\u25e6), respectively. Whereas the stability preference mentioned above is valid for o-CH3ND3PbBr3 [87] and o-CD3ND3PbI3 [88], this is not the case in o-CH3ND3PbCl3 [86] because the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen- and tetrel-bonds in the crystal appear alternately; hence the two orientations of the MA cation in the crystal have different types of N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bond distances (cf. Figure 3a). Although the C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl tetrel bond in both the orientations are somewhat more directional (\u2220N\u2013C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 165.4\u25e6 or 162.9\u25e6) than the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 157.1\u25e6 or 152.9\u25e6), the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bond distances associated with one orientation are 3.460 and 3.571 \u00c5, and those with the other orientation are 3.635 \u00c5 and 3.421 \u00c5 (Figure 3a). From this and, given that directional interactions are stronger than weakly directional interactions, it is difficult to determine whether the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds are stronger than C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl tetrel bonds in o-CH3ND3PbCl3. Because the vdW radii of Cl (1.82 \u00c5), Br (1.86 \u00c5) and I (2.04 \u00c5) are different, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X bond distances follow the same order. They are shortest (and strongest) in the order: o-CH3ND3PbCl3 > o-CH3ND3PbBr3 > o-CD3ND3PbI3 (cf. Figure 3).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 13 of 61\nThe presence of hydrogen, carbon and pnictogen bonding interactions in crystalline oCH3NH3PbX3 has been confirmed by QTAIM and RDG analyses reported elsewhere [25,26]. The results are shown in Figure 4 for o-CH3NH3PbBr3 and o-CH3NH3PbI3. Although the principal bonding features are evident from an analysis of the intermolecular geometry alone, the bond path and bcp, as well as the isosurface topologies of QTAIM and RDG suggested that each H atom in the ammonium/methyl head in MA could be involved with one/two Br atoms to form one/two (N)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br/(C)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds in o-CH3NH3PbBr3 described by the bcps (tiny spheres in green) between the bonded atomic basins. Bond paths between N and C in MA and the Br sites are also apparent, indicating the presence of N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen- and tetrel-bonds in the crystal. Int. J.

The inward curvature of the bond paths between N or C in MA and the nearest I sites indicates that the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen- and tetrel-bonds in o-CH3NH3PbI3 are dispersive and weak. The nature of the bond path topologies associated with these interactions is very similar to that found for o-CH3NH3PbBr3 (see Figure 4a,b). The charge density values depicted in Figure 4 suggest that they are very small at the bcps and are typical of non-covalent interactions (\u03c1b < 0.05 au). It is also apparent that \u03c1b at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I bcps are smaller than those at the (N)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and (C)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I bcps, confirming that first two are weaker than the last two. These analyses highlight the co-existence of several types of non-covalent interactions in these halide perovskite structures, including I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I (Figure 4a) and Br\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br (Figure 4a) halogen-halogen interactions."

As discussed above for the [NH3NH3][Cl]2 crystal (Figure 1), it appears that the D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I deuterium and hydrogen bonds, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I tetrel bonds play a structure-determining role in [CD3ND3][I] and [CH3NH3][I]. The dotted lines in cyan between atomic basins in Figure 5b,c indicate the presence of the latter interactions in [CD3ND3][I], and are substantially longer than those found in [NH3NH3][Cl]2; this is expected since the sum of the vdW radii of C and I, as well as that of N and I, is greater than that of N and Cl (rvdW(N) = 1.66 \u00c5; rvdW(C) = 1.77 \u00c5; rvdW(Cl) = 1.82 \u00c5; rvdW(I) = 2.04 \u00c5). From Figure 5c, it is apparent that the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bond and the C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I tetrel bond in the perdeuteromethylammonium iodide crystal (CSD ref: KUBNOK, space group Pbma) are near-linear interactions, with \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 179.3\u25e6 and \u2220N\u2013C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 178.7\u25e6. The former are stronger than the latter (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.513 \u00c5 vs. r(C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.838 \u00c5), a bond distance which is smaller than the sum of the vdW radii N and I, 3.70 \u00c5; the value of r(C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) is marginally longer than the sum of the vdW radii of C and I, 3.81 \u00c5, which suggests they are dispersive in nature. By contrast, the (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and (C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I deuterium bonds are inequivalent because the \u2013ND3 group is more acidic than the \u2013CD3 group in d6-MA. For instance, the bond distance (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I in the crystal appears in three different flavors, with (r(N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I)) (\u2220N\u2013D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) 2.640 \u00c5 (154.5\u25e6), 2.715 \u00c5 (141.0\u25e6) and 3.257 \u00c5 (100.9\u25e6). Similarly, the bond distance of (C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I close contacts appears in two different flavors, with (r((C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I)) (\u2220C\u2013D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) 3.210 \u00c5 (125.4\u25e6) and 3.472 \u00c5 (107.9\u25e6). In the case of the tetragonal [CD3ND3][I] crystal (CSD ref: KUBNOK01, space group P4/nmm), \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 180.0\u25e6 and \u2220N\u2013C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 180.0\u25e6. These correspond to r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) of 3.543 \u00c5 and r(C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) of 4.046 \u00c5, respectively. For tetragonal [CH3NH3][I] (CSD ref: KUBNOK02, space group P4/nmm), \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 180.0\u25e6 and \u2220N\u2013C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 180.0\u25e6; they correspond to r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) of 3.588 \u00c5 and r(C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) of 3.999 \u00c5, respectively. The attractive interactions between CH3NH3+ and I\u2212 accord with the results of the MESP model, Figure 6. N is more electropositive than C in CH3NH3+ (VS,max = 158.3 kcal mol\u22121 for N and 119.7 kcal mol\u22121 for C), and N interacts more strongly than C with I\u2212. Both N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I are directional interactions. Their presence is evident in the IGM-\u03b4g plot (Figure 5d), in which the isosurfaces are thicker and wider between N and I than that between C and I.\nInt. J. Mol.

They are presen regardless of whether the geometry of th ion-pair was extracted from t e crystal, or from the fully r laxed structure using MP2(FC) and \u03c9B97X-D g ometries evaluated in conjunction with def2-TZVPPD. The charge density (\u03c1b) values at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I (or C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) bcps shown in Figure 5e (or Figure 5f) for [CH3NH3][I] are different since the i termolecular N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I (or C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) distance in the relaxed gas phase geometry of [CH3NH3][I] was appreciably shorter than that in the crystal. However, they are indeed less than the typical value of \u03c1b (\u03c1b < 0.05 au) often reported for non-covalent interactions [92,93]. The Laplacian of the charge density (\u22072\u03c1 ) values at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I (or C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) bcp are also unequal and are positive (\u22072\u03c1b > 0), and hence attest to the closed-shell nature of these interactions [65\u201367]. Although the IGM-\u03b4g plot indicated N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen and tetrel bonding interactions (as well as (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and (C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I deuterium bonds) between the interacting monomers in the ion-pair [CD3ND3][I], the (N)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and (C)D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I deuterium bonds (or (N)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and (C)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds) were not identified in [CD3ND3][I] (or [CH3NH3][I]) using the bond path and bcp topologies of QTAIM when the interacting ions are in a geometric arrangement shown in Figure 5e,f. We have calculated the interaction energy of the two aforementioned ion-pairs of [CH3NH3][I], Figure 5e,f using the crystal, as well as using their MP2(FC) and \u03c9B97X-\nD/def2-TZVPPD, geometries.

Similarly, [MP2(FC)]crystal geometry and [MP2(FC)]optimized geometry refer to the crystal and MP2(FC) geometries of the ion-pairs used for the calculation of binding energies with MP2(FC).\nThe strength of the carbon bond in the conformer shown in Figure 5f based on Eb = 1\u20442Vb gave values of \u22122.79 and \u22120.75 kcal mol\u22121 when evaluated on the \u03c9B97X-D and crystal geometries of the ion-pair, respectively. Similarly, the strength of the pnictogen bond in the conformer shown in Figure 5e was \u22124.64 and \u22121.79 kcal mol\u22121 when evaluated on the \u03c9B97X-D and crystal geometries of the ion-pair, respectively. Since there was no bond path between the H atoms of \u2013NH3 and \u2013CH3 fragments of the CH3NH3 cation and the interacting iodide anion, the strength of hydrogen bonds between them could not be evaluated. These results suggest that pnictogen bond is the strongest of all interactions investigated. Zeroth-order symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SPAT0 [95]) calculations were performed for the [CH3NH3][I] adduct, on the structure extracted from the crystal and on the \u03c9B97X-D and MP2(FC) optimized geometry, in conjunction with the def2-TZVPPD-RI basis set. This approach dissects the interaction energy into four major components arising from electrostatics (Eels), exchange-repulsion (Eexch), induction (Eind) and dispersion (Edisp). The results are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, the total interaction energies Eint(SAPT0) obtained using SAPT0 are in reasonable agreement with those computed using the counterpoise method of the SCF (Self-Consistent Field) approaches (\u03c9B97X-D and MP2(FC)). Inspection of the dissected components suggests that the energy due to electrostatics is significant as expected given that [CH3NH3][I] is an ion-pair and hence coulombic attraction plays a very crucial role in stabilizing the intermolecular interaction. Since the intermolecular distances in the adducts in the crystal geometry are longer than those in the \u03c9B97X-D and MP2(FC) optimized geometries, the interaction between the monomers becomes stronger in the latter case than in the former. Concomitant with this is the increase in each of the dissected components (see Table 2). The collective contribution due to induction and dispersion cannot be overlooked since they contribute appreciably to the net interaction energy E(SAPT0). Whereas Eexch is repulsive, and its magnitude is comparable with the induction energy (viz. 4.4 kcal mol\u22121 for H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) when the crystal geometries of the H3C-H3N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I ionpairs were used, the net interaction energy E(SAPT0) is then due to energies arising from electrostatics and dispersion. However, when the \u03c9B97X-D and MP2(FC) geometries of the H-containing ion-pairs were used, each of the four components responsible for Eint(SAPT0) are significantly affected. This is not very surprising since the intermolecular distances in H3C-H3N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I were significantly reduced in the gas phase structure. This has caused an increase in Eels, Eind and Edisp, with concomitant increase in Eexch. Even so, the Eint(SAPT0) value calculated on the \u03c9B97X-D and MP2(FC) geometries of the two ion-pairs are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding Eint(\u03c9B97X-D) and Eint([MP2(FC)]), respectively (see Table 2).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 18 of 61\na See Table 1 for Eint and Eint(BSSE) values.\nThe strengths of the pnictogen bond in H3C-H3N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and the tetrel bond in H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I are significant when compared to the N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds in the corresponding ion-pairs. This is also evidenced by our second order analysis of the charge transfer delocalization energy [72\u201375,96]. This was carried out at the RHF/6-311G* level using the MP2(FC) and \u03c9B97X-D optimized geometries. Our results are summarized in Table 3. The data show that for the formation of the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bond and N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds, the lone-pair(4) on the iodide anion, LP(4)I, interacts attractively via a charge transfer process with the \u03c3* type C\u2013N and N\u2013H anti-bonding orbitals BD* of the organic cation NH3CH3+, respectively. The magnitude of second order energy E(2) associated with the two types of charge transfer delocalizations is 4.51 and 1.14 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. In addition, we have also identified that the same lone-pair on I is involved in a charge transfer delocalization with a Rydberg type orbital RY*(1) on N with an E(2) of 2.86 kcal mol\u22121. There are, in fact, three weak N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds, in which LP(2), LP(3) and LP(4) are simultaneously involved in hyperconjugative charge transfer interactions with the three BD*(N\u2013H) orbitals.\nThe nature of the hyperconjugative charge transfer delocalization is very similar between the interacting units CH3NH3+ and I\u2212, leading to the formation of the ion-pair H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I. However, in this case, the three C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds are markedly weaker (compared to the N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds), with E(2) energies close to 0.12 kcal mol\u22121. By contrast, the charge transfer delocalization is very pronounced between LP(4)I and BD*(1)C\u2013\nInt. J. Mol.

Other than this, there are LP(4)I\u2192 RY*(C) and LP(1)I\u2192 BD*(C\u2013N) delocalizations with E(2) of 2.58 and 0.56 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. The results given above were obtained on the MP2(FC) geometries; they are also evident when the \u03c9B97X-D geometries of the ion-pair was used, and E(2) values are slightly smaller, in accordance with the longer intermolecular distance between CH3NH3+ and I\u2212. These results suggest that the triangular face in \u2013NH3 or \u2013CH3 is simultaneously engaged with the iodide anion, leading to the stability of the H3C-H3N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and H3N-H3C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I ionpairs, respectively. While we did not explore the conformational space, it is no doubt that the crystal also contains a significant number of C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds of another variety."

            "text": "The transformation of ammonium cyanate into urea was first studied over 170 years ago by W\u00f6hler and Liebig [97]. Knowledge of the crystal structure of ammonium cyanate is a prerequisite for a basic understanding of the nature of its solid-state reaction. The neutron powder diffraction data have enabled MacLean et al. [97] to demonstrate the formation of N\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds between an NH4+ ion to four cyanate N atoms at alternate corners of a distorted cube, overturning their initial own view of the presence of N\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds to cyanate O atoms at the other four corners. We investigated the intermolecular geometry of the NH4CNO crystal with MESP and IGM-\u03b4g calculations. The results we obtained support both proposals of the authors [97]. Three different views of the 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell crystal structure of tetragonal ammonium cyanate (space group P4/nmm) are shown in Figure 7a\u2013c. The local non-covalent interaction topologies between interacting atoms of the participating molecular entities are shown in Figure 7d\u2013f. The MESP model description is given in Figure 8a; it is clear that N in NH4+ features four \u03c3-holes (VS,max 158.3 kcal mol\u22121 each), each along the outer extension of an H\u2013N bond. There are also four \u03c3-holes on four H atoms along the four N\u2013H bond extensions that are somewhat stronger (VS,max 180.2 kcal mol\u22121). N in NH4+ is engaged attractively with four nearest-neighbor O sites of four CNO\u2212 anions, Figure 7d, thus forming four charge-assisted H\u2212N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O pnictogen bonds that are equivalent (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) = 3.048 \u00c5 and \u2220H\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 175.8\u25e6). From Figure 7e, it is clear that each O site in a CNO\u2212 anion acts as a Lewis base and is in attractive engagement with the N atoms of four nearest-neighbor NH4+ cations, forming four equivalent H\u2212N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O bonds. These pnictogen bonds are all quasilinear because of the competition with N\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds that are simultaneously formed, since each NH4+ cation donates H atoms to cyanate O. Two of these non-linear hydrogen bonds are equivalent (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) = 2.890 \u00c5 and \u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 88.9\u25e6) and the other is slightly shorter (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O) = 2.844 \u00c5 and \u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 91.5\u25e6); see Figure 8b). On the other hand, and from Figure 7f, one can conclude that the N of the CNO\u2212 anion acts as a site to accepts four strong quasi-linear hydrogen bonds, each with r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N) = 2.000 \u00c5 and \u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O = 172.3\u25e6. From these results it is clear that NH4+ is a versatile hydrogen- and pnictogen bond donor, that O in CNO\u2212 is a versatile pnictogen bond acceptor and that N in CNO\u2212 is a versatile hydrogen bond acceptor. In all these interactions the intermolecular distance associated with the close contacts H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O or H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N are less than the sum of the vdW radii of the relevant atomic basins.\nInt.

From the size of the IGM-\u03b4g volumes obtained using two different isovalues (0.015 and 0.005 a.u.), it is clear that the charge-assisted N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O pnictogen bond is moderately strong given its presence even at the higher isovalue of 0.015 a.u. The isosurface corresponding to the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O close contacts that appears at low isovalues indicates that the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds are weaker than the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O pnictogen bonds (see Figure 8c,d). On the other hand, the isosurfaces between N and H are bluish as a result of more electron density concentration in the bonding region (cf. Figure 8e). The presence of (C)\u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0(C) interactions in the crystal is also confirmed by the IGM-\u03b4g analysis, with a contact distance of 3.644 \u00c5. However, these interactions are probably the weakest of all the interactions identified in the crystal, as evidenced by the flat greenish isosurface between a pair of CNO\u2212 ions (see Figure 8e). To further clarify the presence of pnictogen bonding in NH4CNO, we have used the geometry of the ion-pair found in the crystal and performed QTAIM calculations on it at the MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD level. Similar to other ion-pairs discussed above and below, QTAIM did not indicate the formation of hydrogen bonding in the conformation shown in Figure 7g. However, it indeed revealed the presence of an N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O pnictogen bonding between the N and O atomic basins of the two interacting ion pairs. There is a bond path, and bond critical point between the bonded atomic basins, shown as dotted line in atom color between N and O. The \u03c1b and \u22072\u03c1b at the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O bcp is as small as 0.0074 and 0.0315 au. The empirical expression, Eb = 1\u20442Vb, gave values of \u22121.51 kcal mol\u22121 in the corresponding geometries, respectively, suggesting the possibility of a weak interaction between N and O in NH4CNO. Of course, this interaction energy is substantially smaller than the complexation energy found at the MP2(fc)/def2-TZVPPD level: the uncorrected and BSSE corrected energies of \u221288.16 and \u221287.80 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, arising primarily from the electrostatic interaction between two ionic moieties that cause the two ionic domains to come into close proximity. NBO\u2019s second order analysis with RHF/6-311G* gave an indication of the occurrence of a LP(3)O \u2192 BD(1)* N\u2013H hyperconjugative interaction, with an E(2) of 0.56 kcal mol\u22121; however, there was no such appreciable hyperconjugative interaction revealed that could represent hydrogen bonding between NH4+ and CNO\u2212 for the conformer shown in Figure 7g."

            "text": "Referring to their 2007 work [98], Nelyubina et al. have shown in a subsequent 2014 study [99] that N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl close contacts could be present in crystalline NH4Cl. Experimental electron density data derived from X-ray diffraction measurements enabled them to provide an accurate description of the interionic bonding in NH4Cl, and gave results that were consistent with quantum chemistry based-calculations [98]. The crystal structure of NH4Cl is shown in Figure 9a\u2013c, and features H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonding and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonding. The first of these interactions is the stronger, as revealed from the bond distances (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 2.309 \u00c5 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.318 \u00c5), and both are linear (\u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 180.0\u25e6 and \u2220H\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 180.0\u25e6). From the local geometries shown in Figure 9d,e, it is clear that N is a donor of four \u03c3-hole-centered pnictogen bonds, and simultaneously four hydrogen bond donors; this means that each NH4+ unit is surrounded by eight nearest-neighbor Cl\u2212 anions in the crystal lattice. The former are engaged attractively with four nearest-neighbor chloride ions in forming four \u03c3-hole centered charge-assisted H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds. Similarly, the four \u03c3-holes on N in NH4+ are linked with four nearest-neighbor Cl ions, thereby forming four \u03c3-hole-centered pnictogen bonds. This shows that the Cl\u2212 ion is the versatile acceptor of eight non-covalent bonds (four H-bonds and four N-bonds), Figure 9f.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 23 of 61 Int. J. Mol.

In particular, this anal-\nysis suggests two possible interactions, H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl, that stabilize the ion-pair con-\nfiguration shown in Figure 9g. There are three equivalent close contacts of the former type,\neach with an E(2) of [LP(4)Cl \u2192 BD*(1) H\u2013N] = 0.73 kcal mol\u22121; similarly, the [LP(2)Cl \u2192\nBD*(1) H\u2013N] delocalization associated with the three H-bonded interactions were 0.74,\nNelyubina et al. [99] have estimated the energy of the pnictogen bonds to vary between 1.2 and 1.5 kcal mol\u22121, so each of them accounts for 20 to 25% of the interaction energy per NH4+ moiety in NH4Cl. As mentioned above, our view is consistent with that of these authors: the hydrogen bonds in the crystal are the primary interactions. They are the cause of the occurrence of the pnictogen bonds with the ammonium cation. Clearly, there is a straightforward interplay between these two types of bonding interactions that not only\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 24 of 61\nprovides stability to the crystal structure, but also assists in the determination of phase transition behavior, ferroelastoelectric and other physical properties. QTAIM calculations for the NH4Cl ion-pair were performed for both the crystal geometry and the MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD and \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD optimized geometries. As for the CH3NH3I case, we also found that the intermolecular distance between N and Cl in NH4Cl in the MP2(FC) gas phase, 2.701 \u00c5, is significantly shorter than that of 3.318 \u00c5 in the same ion-pair in the crystal. Despite this difference, the topology of bond paths and bcp between the N and Cl atomic basins in the ion-pair is preserved: the \u03c1b (and \u22072\u03c1b) values for the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bcp are 0.0266 (+0.1129), 0.0253 (+0.1083) and 0.0086 (+0.0293) a.u. with MP2(FC),\u03c9B97X-D and crystal geometries, respectively, suggesting a closed-shell interaction. The empirical expression, Eb = 1\u20442Vb, gave values of\u22128.35,\u22127.53 and\u22121.66 kcal mol\u22121 as the strength of the ion-pair in the MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD, \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD and crystal geometries of the ion pair, respectively, indicating that the bond between the N and Cl atomic basins of NH4Cl in the crystal geometry is quite weak; this result is in good agreement with that of Nelyubina et al. [99] (see above). However, the uncorrected (BSSE corrected) complex formation energies for the ion-pair calculated using MP2(FC) (\u03c9B97XD/def2-TZVPPD) [crystal] geometries found to be\u2212119.11 (\u2212118.03) [\u2212118.07] and \u2212102.63 (\u2212117.92) [\u2212102.15] kcal mol\u22121, respectively, suggests BSSE has a negligible effect on the complexation energy, and the large complexation energy is of coulombic origin, as expected for ionic interactions. Our RHF/6-311G* level second order NBO analysis suggested that delocalization of charge transfer promotes attraction between the interacting units. In particular, this analysis suggests two possible interactions, H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl, that stabilize the ion-pair configuration shown in Figure 9g. There are three equivalent close contacts of the former type, each with an E(2) of [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) H\u2013N] = 0.73 kcal mol\u22121; similarly, the [LP(2)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) H\u2013N] delocalization associated with the three H-bonded interactions were 0.74, 0.75 and 0.99 kcal mol\u22121. The nitrogen bonding in the ion-pair is described by hyperconjugative interactions [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H], [LP(1)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H], and [LP(4)Cl\u2192 RY*(1)N] that are associated with E(2) of 4.88, 0.30 and 2.66 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. These insights collected using the MP2/def2-TZVPPD gas phase optimized geometry are consistent with that gained when the ion-pair geometry of the crystal was used. In this case, the strength of the hyperconjugative interaction is reduced because the interaction between the ions is longer ranged. Therefore, the strength of the hydrogen bond interactions was predicted to be of the van der Waals type, with an E(2) for the delocalization [LP(Cl)\u2192 BD*(1)(H\u2013N)] close to 0.1 kcal mol\u22121. By contrast, [LP(4)Cl\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H], and [LP(4)Cl\u2192 RY*(1)N] were associated with an E(2) of 0.70 and 1.07 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. These results unequivocally suggest that a single pnictogen bond is stronger than several hydrogen bonds formed between the ionic species Cl\u2212 and NH4+, causing the formation of the ion pair. The crystal structures of NH4Br and ND4Br (ICSD ref: 26577) [100] were reported some time ago. They occur as cubic and tetragonal crystals in various space groups, viz., P43m, Pm3m, Fm3m and P4/nmm, suggesting that these are phase change materials. The P43m crystal of ND4Br (ICSD ref: 26577 [100]) and the phase-I and -III (space groups P43m and P4/nmm, respectively) crystals of NH4Br (ICSD ref: 43300 [101] and 27724 [102], respectively) contain accurate information on the D/H atom positions. The low temperature cubic geometry of the crystal of ND4Br (ICSD ref: 26577) is shown in Figure 10a\u2013c, illustrating the occurrence of charge-assisted D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br deuterium bonding and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonding interactions between the interacting ionic species. The local nature of the interaction between the ions, Figure 10d\u2013f, is very similar to that observed for NH4Cl (Figure 9), although the D- and N-bond distances are slightly longer, as expected since the vdW radius of Br is larger than that of Cl (rvdW(Cl) = 1.82 \u00c5 and rvdW(Br) = 1.86 \u00c5). For the phase-I low-temperature cubic crystal of NH4Br (ICSD ref. 43300 [101]), the corresponding H- and N-bonds are slightly longer (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 2.518 \u00c5 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 3.516 \u00c5) [102]. While the local topological pattern of H- and N-bonding interactions around the N atomic basin in NH4+ of the P4/nmm structure (ICSD ref: 27724) is very similar to that of the P43m structure\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 25 of 61\n(r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 2.509 \u00c5 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 3.482 \u00c5) [102], the interacting angles deviate appreciably from linearity (\u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 167.6\u25e6 and \u2220H\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 175.3\u25e6). This suggests that both the hydrogen- and pnictogen-bonds in the tetragonal structure are distorted compared to those found in the cubic structure. Int. J. Mol.

These are substantially shorter than the corresponding distance of 3.516 \u00c5 found in the crystal geometry of the ion-pair (ICSD ref. 43300 [101]). The \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD, MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD and crystal geometries of the NH4+Br\u2212 ion-pair were then separately used to calculate the complexation energy.

Figure 10g,h show that whereas the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br distance of separation in the gas phase and crystal geometries of the ion-pair differs substantially from each other, QTAIM identifies the pnictogen bonded interaction regardless of the nature of the geometry involved. Similarly, as found for NH4Cl (see above), the RH/6-311G* level NBO\u2019s second order analysis performed on the \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD level fully-relaxed geometry of the ion-pair NH4Br suggested the possible occurrence of both N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonding and H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonding. It provided evidence of three equivalent hydrogen bonds formed between the three H atom on the triangular face of NH4+ and the Br anion (see arrangement in Figure 10g,h). The N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bond was the result of charge transfer delocalization between a lone-pair orbital on Br\u2212 and the \u03c3* anti-bonding orbital BD*(H\u2013N). As such, E(2) for delocalizations, LP(4)Br\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H], and [LP(4)I\u2192 RY*(1)N], associated with the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonding were 4.19 and 2.19 kcal mol\u22121, respectively. Similarly, each of three [LP(4)Br\u2192 BD*(1) H\u2013N] charge transfer delocalizations associated with each of the three equivalent H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds had E(2) = 0.87 kcal mol\u22121. The delocalizations, LP(4)Br\u2192 BD*(1) N\u2013H], and [LP(4)I\u2192 RY*(1)N], representing the pnictogen bond, were evident when the crystal geometry of the ion-pair was used, with E(2) of 0.90 and 0.91 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, yet in this case the charge transfer energy of the H-bonded interactions was marginal. A number of structures of the H- and D-derivatives of ammonium iodide NH4I (P43m, Pm3m, Fm3m and P4/nmm), have also been deposited in the ICSD. Ammonium iodide undergoes a I\u2013II\u2013IV\u2013V sequence of phase transitions at room temperature under pressure. The I\u2013II phase transition occurs at PI\u2013II = 0.5 kbar [104], while there is no reliable information on the II\u2013IV transition pressure; it was speculated that PII\u2013IV = 27 kbar on the basis of a subtle change observed in Raman spectra. Phase transition into the phase V was observed at P = 5 4 kbar, which was also observed in the Raman spectra [103]. The tetragonal crystal HP-IV (high pressure phase, 8600 MPa) contains accurate information on the D atom positions (ICSD ref. 89094) [103]. Balagurov et al. found that ND4I(V) has the same structure as the low-temperature phase ND4I(III)\u2014a tetragonal structure with antiparallel ordering of ammonium ions, space group P4/nmm [100]. As in the P4/nmm structure of ND4Br, we found that the angles of interaction in the crystal structure of polymorphic phase IV of NH4I, Figure 11a\u2013c, are slightly distorted from linearity in (\u2220N\u2013D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 178.2\u25e6 and \u2220D\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 178.7\u25e6). The local topological pattern of D- and N-bonding interactions around the ND4+ unit is shown in Figure 11d\u2013f, indicating the presence of four equivalent deuterium bonds (as well as four equivalent pnictogen bonds), with r(D\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 2.454 \u00c5 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.356 \u00c5.\nInt.

J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 28 of 61\nWe note the feasibility of I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I contacts (r(I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.964 \u00c5) between the iodide anions in crystalline ND4I (ICSD ref: 89094). The feature is reminiscent of the Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl contacts (r(Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.831 \u00c5) observed in crystalline NH4Cl crystal (ICSD ref: 428519) [99]. The high pressure (9600 MPa) crystal of NH4I (space group P4/nmm; ICSD ref: 257453 [105]) shows that it is an effect of both hydrogen bonding and pnictogen bonding. The latter appears along the H\u2013N bond extensions, and the former along N\u2013H bond extensions. The iodide anion in the crystal lies approximately midway between two N atoms of two NH4+ moieties. For instance, r(H3N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.352 \u00c5 and r(H4N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.374 \u00c5. The former is less directional than the latter (\u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 179.6\u25e6 and \u2220H\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 179.73\u25e6). The directional feature, together with the short intermolecular distance of separation between the atomic sites of opposite polarity, provides direct evidence of the formation of both hydrogen bonds and pnictogen bonds in the crystal. The I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I contact (r(I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.912 \u00c5) between the nearest iodide anions in crystalline NH4I is slightly shorter than those found in the ND4I. crystal (ICSD ref: 89094). In the case of the crystal structures of ND4Br [100] and ND4Br [101], the Br\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br contacts were 4.000 and 4.118 \u00c5, respectively. These are tertiary interactions, a forced consequence of the primary (H/D-bond) and secondary (N-bond) interactions in the ammonium halide crystals, and are weak and dispersion driven. This accords with the conclusions reached by Nelyubina et al. [99], who found the charge density at the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl bcps were 0.13\u20130.19, 0.05\u20130.06 and 0.02\u20130.04 e \u00c5\u22123, respectively, indicating that the stability of these bonding interactions in in the order H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl > N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl > Cl\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl. The IGM-\u03b4g plots shown in Figure 11g,h confirm the presence of all these interactions. The presence of the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds in NH4I is indicated by the thick circular volumes in greenish-blue, whereas the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds manifest as triangle-like isosurface volumes in deep-green; both appear at isovalues of 0.010 and 0.015 a.u. The flat isosurface volumes in green corresponding to the I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I contacts were obtained with low isovalues because they are weak (Figure 11h). That N and I atomic basins in NH4I are bonded can be inferred from the MESP model of NH4+ (cf. Figure 8a). The gas-phase relaxation of the geometry of the NH4+I\u2212 ion-pair gave N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I inter-ionic distances of 3.103 and 3.055 \u00c5 with \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD and MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD, respectively. Indeed, these are very close to what was found in the geometry of the same ion-pair in the crystal [105] (r(H4N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.374 \u00c5). However, the gas-phase geometry was linear, whereas that in the crystal is quasi-linear. This is not very surprising since the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds compete with pnictogen bonds in the crystal, and each ammonium cation is involved in forming eight non-bonded interactions with eight nearest-neighbor iodide ions (see Figure 11f for ND4+I\u2212). The uncorrected [and BSSE corrected] complexation energy of the ion pair is calculated to be as large as \u2212106.47 [\u2212106.45], \u2212109.17 [\u2212107.33] and \u2212101.72 [\u2212100.46] kcal mol\u22121 with \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD and MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD and crystal geometries, respectively, the latter calculated on the ND4+I\u2212 geometry at MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD. Our QTAIM calculation provides information about the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bond in NH4+I\u2212/ND4+I\u2212, and the \u03c1b (and \u22072\u03c1b) values were found to be 0.0191 (+0.0635), 0.0208 (+0.0699) and 0.0122 (+0.0372) a.u. at the corresponding geometries (and levels of theory), respectively, the latter obtained on the ND4+I\u2212 geometry with MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD. Figure 11i shows the QTAIM-based molecular graph that provides evidence of the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonded interaction in ND4+I\u2212, obtained using the crystal geometry of the ion-pair at MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD, and is reminiscent of the gasphase NH4+I\u2212 geometries as well (not shown). Eb = 12 Vb gave values of \u22124.71, \u22125.52 and \u22122.57 kcal mol\u22121 as the strength of the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bond in the \u03c9B97X-D/def2TZVPPD, MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD and crystal geometries of the ion pair, respectively, the latter calculated on the ND4+I\u2212 geometry with MP2(FC)/def2-TZVPPD. NBO\u2019s second order analysis performed using the \u03c9B97X-D/def2-TZVPPD geometry of the NH4+I\u2212 ion pair suggested the occurrence of both H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonding and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonding interactions between the interacting ions in NH4+I\u2212. The former is several times weaker than the latter. This conclusion is based on the charge transfer delocal-\nInt. J. Mol.

There were three delocalizations of the type, LP(4)I\u2192 BD*(1) H\u2013N], associated with three equivalent H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds, each with an E(2) of 1.1 kcal mol\u22121. Other lone-pairs on I are also involved in hyperconjugative interactions, explaining both the interaction types noted above, but E(2) for them were < 0.75 kcal mol\u22121. When the crystal geometry of the ion-pair was used, E(2) for two types of charge transfer delocalizations associated N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonding were 2.20 and 1.52 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, and that associated with each of the three hydrogen bonds was 0.13 kcal mol\u22121."

However, there is significant distortion in the organic cations, and there is uncertainty in their specific locations within the crystal structure.\nOur analysis suggests that inorganic framework, [I44Pb18]8\u2212, in [I44Pb18][CH3NH3] is stabilized by a number of intermolecular interactions: H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds, and I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I dihalogen bonds. The latter occur between the terminal I atoms of the [I44Pb18]8\u2212 frameworks along the crystallographic a and b directions.

            "text": "Billing and Lemmerer [108] reported a series of layered crystal structures of the inorganic\u2013organic perovskite-type hybrids, stable at room temperature, with general formula [(CnH2n+1NH3)2PbI4] (n = 12, 14, 16 and 18). Each of them displays two reversible phase transitions above room temperature, with phases labelled III, II and I. The transition from phase III to phase II was first-order and was related to a change in the conformation of the alkylammonium chains and a shift of the inorganic layers relative to each other. The crystal structure of one of these perovskites, with n = 16, is shown in Figure 14a. The organic cation chain works as an additive, or spacer or linker, connecting the PbI42\u2212 moieties through a number of N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds (r((N)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 2.818/2.766 \u00c5 and \u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 142.5\u25e6/165\u25e6; r((C)H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.510 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 139.5\u25e6). Because the terminal ammonium head is more acidic than the methyl head of the chain, it is engaged in a greater number of non-covalent interactions with a PbI4\u2212 face compared to the methyl group which attracts a single iodide site of a given PbI42\u2212 layer. Other than these interactions, the N site in the ammonium terminal of the organic cation is also involved in the formation of charge-assisted N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonding with an I site of the same PbI4\u2212 face. It is longer, yet more directional than the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds. They appear in two alternate flavors based on the nature of their spatial arrangement between the inorganic PbI42\u2212 layers.

Figure 14a), featuring a Type-IIa topology of bonding. Because the pnictogen bond distances are either less than or close to the sum of vdW radii of N and I atomic basins, 3.70 \u00c5, they could be categorized as secondary interactions, with the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds the primary interactions.

Similarly, the H sites of the other ammonium fragment involved in the other pnictogen bond (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.298 \u00c5) is also involved in forming hydrogen bonds with distances of 2.474, 2.327 and 2.322 \u00c5, corresponding to the angles of approach of the electrophile of 152.9\u25e6, 170.7\u25e6 and 175.7\u25e6, respectively. Clearly, these attractive interactions interplay with each other to determine octahedral tilting of the PbCl6 octahedra of the inorganic frameworks of the metal halide perovskite. The octahedral tilting is a factor influencing the band gap and effective masses of charge carriers, a necessary perquisite for the functioning of perovskite compounds in photovoltaics and optoelectronics [26,112], and is driven by the competition between the N and H sites of the ammonium head in forming pnictogen and hydrogen bonding interactions. Diammonium cations with the generic formula +H3N\u2013R\u2013NH3+, where R group may be a linear-chain alkyl group, or an even-membered derivative of ethane, or a fused aromatic ring such as naphthalene, are well known. As spacers, they have been used as template moieties to stabilize the inorganic framework of a large number of inorganic-organic hybrid nanocomposites (cf. Figures 14c and 15). Many two-dimensional layered perovskites with a RbAlF4 type structure and with linear alkyl chains between inorganic layers have been reported. They include, for example, [(H3N(CH2)4NH3)PbBr4], [(H3N(CH2)4NH3)PbI4], [(H3N(CH2)8NH3)PbI4], [(H3N(CH2)10NH3)PbBr4] and [(H3N(CH2)12NH3)PbI4]. Those where the R group contains a fused aromatic ring such as naphthalene, [(H3NC10H6NH3)PbI4], are also known. When the alkyl chain contains an odd number of \u2013CH2 fragments, a 0D inorganic motif consisting of face-sharing PbI6 octahedra and isolated iodide anions have observed, as in [(H3N(CH2)7NH3)4Pb3I12]2+\u00b72I\u2212. 1D motifs such as [(H3NC2H4NH3)4PbBr4] and [(H3NC6H4CH2C6H4NH3)PbI6], which have edge-sharing twin-anionic chains of corner-sharing ribbons, have also been reported. The structure of (NH3(CH2)12NH3)n PbI4\u00b7n(PbI4) (Figure 14c) has been reported by two different groups [110,113]. Both N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonding and C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonding are evident. The C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds are quasilinear (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 173.8\u25e6), with r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) of 3.741 \u00c5. The bonding features in this system are similar to members of this family of compounds with smaller diamine cations; representative structures are shown in Figure 15a\u2013c ((H3N(CH2)4NH3)PbI4, (H3N(CH2)8NH3)PbI4 and (H3N(CH2)10NH3)PbBr4, respectively). The pnictogen bond in the first two of these systems is far from linear. The r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) in (H3N(CH2)10NH3)PbBr4 is 3.597 \u00c5, which is less than the sum of the vdW radii of Br and N, 3.52 \u00c5. This is a notable feature of all the 2D iodide-based perovskites (cf. Figures 14 and 15). In cases where the templating agent is an are aromatic moiety, as in (H3NC10H6NH3)PbI4, shown in Figure 15d, the C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds are somewhat longer and linear. Both the ammonium fragments form equivalent pnictogen bonds, with \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 178.6\u25e6 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.930 \u00c5. The three shortest N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds identified for all cases are also illustrated in Figure 15d. They are formed by the H atoms of the ammonium fragment; two of them followed a Type-IIa pattern and the other a Type-IIb pattern. A similar system is [(NH3(CH2)3NH2(CH2)3NH3)2][Cd2Cl10], in which the organic cation carries a formal charge of +3 (Figure 16a). The 2D framework manifests through H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds; the former are formed by the terminal H atoms of the two ammonium groups and chloride ions. The latter are directional, with \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 176.7\u25e6 and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.281 \u00c5. The bond lengths are markedly shorter than the sum of vdW radii, 3.48 \u00c5, of Cl and N. The crystal consists of [CdCl6]2\u2212 repeating units, with octahedrally coordinated Cd(III) ions linked bridging ligand Cl. This results in a 2D polymeric structure that runs along the ac crystallographic plane; Cl\u2212 ions provide charge balance.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 34 of 61 Int. J. Mol.

In the case of the crystal of (CH3CH2NH2CH2CH2NH3)2n\u00b7n(CdCl4), Figure 16e, the H site of the acetylenic fragment of the cation forms a strong H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bond with the inorganic framework and is strong enough to compete with the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds formed by its other end. As noted above, perovskite-type layer compounds with general formula (R-NH3)2[MX4] or (NH3-(CH2)n-NH3)[MX4], (M = Cd, Mn, Cu, Pb . . . ; X = Cl, Br, I; and R = a saturated or an unsaturated chain) have received considerable attention for some time as their crystal structures exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional arrangement with alternating inorganic (MX6)-organic (alkyl or alkylene chains) layers and undergo numerous structural phase transitions under temperature and/or pressure effects [119\u2013131].\nAnother set of 2D metal halide perovskite systems in which H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds and directional pnictogen bonds formed between the organic and inorganic octahedra frameworks reinforce the layered structure, but in which they are not solely responsible for the crystalline structure, is shown in Figure 17. The pnictogen bonds appear as N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I contacts in Figure 17a,b, and as N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br contacts in Figure 17c,d. The N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br contacts, respectively, in Figure 17a,c,d are longer than the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I contacts in Figure 17b, which are exceptionally short, suggesting a significant degree of covalency [132\u2013135].Int.

As shown in Figures 17a and 18a, these are nothing other than charge assisted C\u2013I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I halogen bonds and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds. The first are stronger than the second, inferred from the intermolecular distances and directionality features. In a study of some related structures, viz. (Cl-(CH2)2-NH3)2PbI4 (Figure 18b) and (Br-(CH2)2-NH3)2PbI4 (Figure 18c)) [140], it was suggested that the structural features of these systems are the result of halogen and hydrogen bonding at the organic\u2212inorganic interface; the hydrogen bonds between equatorial iodine atoms of the perovskite layer and ammonium parts are absent. Although the characterization of intermolecular bonding interactions in these systems was based purely on geometric factors, our close inspection not only revealed various other interactions, as mentioned above, but the conclusions of the authors may be incorrect since the equatorial iodine atoms of the perovskite layer and ammonium fragments are not free from hydrogen bonding (cf. Figure 18a\u2013c). It was further argued that the red salts, such as (Cl\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4, display a reduced band gap (experimental: 2.2 eV; calculation: 1.9 eV) compared to (I\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4 in which tilting of the PbI6 octahedra and a larger bandgap (experimental: 2.45 eV; calculation: 2.3 eV) occurs [140]. This may not be correct since it is not a straightforward matter to determine whether the reduced band gap for the red-salt perovskites of the series has emerged from hydrogen bonding or halogen bonding interactions, or a combination of the two, at the organic\u2212inorganic interface. We did not find such directional N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds between the organic and inorganic counterparts in the undistorted lead iodide perovskite systems with X\u2032\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3+ (X\u2032 = Br, Cl) as spacer cations. It could be due to the organic spacer adopting a cis configuration as a result of its small size and reactivity of the lighter halogens. The geometry of these cations is accompanied by a charge-assisted intramolecular N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X\u2032 hydrogen bonding interaction (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X\u2032) 2.898 \u00c5 in Br\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3+ and 2.778 \u00c5 in Cl\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3+), thus providing additional stability to the structure (cf. Figure 18b,c, respectively). It should be appreciated that the (Br\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4 and (Cl\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4 crystals are not free from C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds, as well as charge-assisted X\u2032\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I (X\u2032 = Cl, Br) halogen bonds. The marked differences in intermolecular bonding features, as well as the inflexible nature of the conformational degree of freedom of the three bifunctional organic cations (adopts to a trans configuration in Figure 18a and to a cis configuration in Figure 18b,c), between the three crystal systems may explain why the degree of distortion of the perovskite layers, in terms of the degree of tilting of the octahedral related to the mean equatorial PbI2 plane, occurs in (I\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4, but not in (Cl\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4 and (Br\u2212(CH2)2\u2212NH3)2PbI4. From these structural features, it is clear that the bandgap reduction in the red-salts is a joint effect of the conformational freedom of the organic cation, the extent of various intermolecular interaction and the tilting of the octahedra. The N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds in the crystal [2(C9H12N),0.5(C2H6),0.5(Pb4I14)] (referred to by the authors as (PPA)2(MA0.5FA0.5)Pb2I7 (PPA = 3-phenyl-2-propenammonium; MA = methylammonium; FA = formamidinium [137]), Figures 17b and 19a, are short and directional, r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 2.814 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 175.3\u25e6, and are accompanied by non-linear N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 2.6\u20132.7 \u00c5; \u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I values in the range 89\u2013120.0\u25e6). In the case of (PPA)2(MA0.5FA0.5)2Pb3I10 (Figure 20b), the pnictogen bond is also short but less directional (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 167.7\u25e6 and (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 2.954 \u00c5). The change in the geometric property of the pnictogen bond is not unexpected since the conjugated counter-cation spacer adjusts its position to maximize its attractive interaction with the iodides of the PbI6 octahedra of the inorganic frameworks.

The shortest C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds formed by the two methyl groups of the organic cation chain are longer and not equivalent (see Figure 21b, right).

Clearly, the competition between N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonding, C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br carbon bonding, and N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br and \u2013(H)C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonding interactions in the crystal causes tilting of the corner-shared PbB6/AgBr6 octahedra in both the crystals. Because of the observed differences in the intermolecular bonding properties, the two perovskite systems in their powder and thin film forms display an onset of optical absorption at energies close to 2.7 eV ((BA)2CsAgBiBr7) and 2.77 eV ((BA)4AgBiBr8), highlighting the semiconducting nature of these systems in the solid state [141]. A very similar multiaxial layered halide double perovskite system, determined at 200, 298 and 400 K, was recently reported [139] (Figure 17d). It exhibits a fascinating ferroelectric feature with a Curie temperature of ~273 K and unique semiconducting nature. In the low temperature phase of the system the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bond is more directional (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 3.514 \u00c5; \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 169.9\u25e6) and is accompanied by N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br and \u2013(H)C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonding interactions. As above, the [(CH3)2CHCH2NH3]2PbCl4 lead halide 2D perovskite, Figure 19a, features an exceptionally large electrocaloric effect near room temperature [142]. It also exhibits a sharp first-order phase transition at 302 K, a superior spontaneous polarization > 4.8 \u00b5C cm\u22122 and relatively small coercive field (<15 kV cm\u22121). The low temperature monoclinic phase (285 K) of the crystal is a result of a marriage between the [(CH3)2CHCH2NH3]2 and PbCl4 ions, accompanied by hydrogen and pnictogen bonding interactions. The latter interactions, N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl, are shown in Figure 19a. They follow a quasi-linear Type-IIa bonding topology, and the N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds are in the range 2.35\u20132.90 \u00c5. McClure et al. [143] have reported the synthesis, structure, and bandgaps of four layered halide double perovskites, BA2Cu0.5In0.5Cl4, BA2Ag0.5In0.5Cl4, BA2Ag0.5Sb0.5Cl4 and BA2Ag0.5Sb0.5Br4 (BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3+). They have an RP structure with n = 1. They revisited the crystal structure of BA2Ag0.5Bi0.5Br4 (Figure 19b) reported by Corner et al. [141] and also reported the crystal structure of BA2PbCl4. All these systems exhibited bandgaps in the range 2.65 eV (BA2Ag0.5Bi0.5Br4) to 4.27 eV (for BA2Ag0.5In0.5Cl4), with the bromide compounds featuring smaller bandgaps than the chloride compounds; this is expected since halide perovskites with heavier halogens generally exhibit smaller bandgaps [84]. The bandgaps of the bromide-containing RP phases, BA2Ag0.5M\u20320.5Br4 (M\u2032 = Bi3+ and Sb3+), fall in the visible range, whereas those with chloride phases are wide bandgap materials (bandgap values between 3.2 and 4.3 eV); the former are shown to be suitable for visible light absorption. Similarly, the bandgaps of layered structures with composition BA2M0.5M\u20320.5X4 were observed to be between 0.5\u20130.8 eV larger than the analogous 3D Cs2MM\u2032X6 cubic double perovskites, a consequence of dimensional reduction (3D\u2192 2D), accompanied by distortions of the octahedral environment around the M/M\u2032 ions, and octahedral tilting. In the 2D systems, the octahedral tilting is driven by various non-covalent interactions between the inorganic and organic layers, including pnictogen bonding, as noted in several crystal systems discussed above. For example, BA2Ag0.5Bi0.5Br4, Figure 19b, has equivalent N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonds, with r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 3.522 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 169.4\u25e6. They are directional, and together with hydrogen bonds, are clearly responsible for the rotation and tilting of the SbBr6 and AgBr6 octahedra in the structure. Mei et al. [144] were probably the first to show that the protonated 5-amino valeric acid cation, HOOC(CH2)4NH3+, (5-AVA), can be used as an organic additive for the development of long-term stability of 2D perovskite solar cells. The cation has the advantage that it is not as toxic as organic diammonium cations, which are potentially deleterious to human health [109]. Subsequently, many such systems were reported, including, for instance, the quaternary representative 5-AVA2MAn\u20131PbnBr3n\u20131 series of 2D bromide perovskite compounds [145] where n = 1\u20133. The value of n determines whether the compound comprises one, two or three layers. Similar 2D perovskite compounds containing chloride and iodide have also appeared. In the case of the iodide derivatives, n can reach values up to 6 or 7 [146]. However, the authors of this study were unable to synthesize pure samples of 5-AVA2MAPb2Br7 and 5-AVA2MA2Pb3Br10 [145]. The crystal structures of these\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 43 of 61\n2D compounds demonstrate that they share some aspects of the structure of the cubic 3D perovskites with layers of corner-sharing PbBr6 octahedrons in (100) orientation. The structural stability of these crystals, such as other perovskite systems discussed above, arises from a significant number of hydrogen bonding interactions between the inorganic and organic components of the structure. The PbX6 octahedra are rotated in these systems, and of course, the extent of this depends on the nature of halides in the inorganic frameworks and the intermolecular interactions involved. There is a monotonic decrease of the band gap from 3.02 eV through 2.80 eV to 2.70 eV as n increases from 1 to 2 and 3 in 5-AVA2MAn\u20131PbnBr3n\u20131. The 5-AVA2PbBr4 perovskite system also displayed strong blue fluorescence (413 nm) with a remarkably small Stokes shift (47 nm). However, the stability of the systems with n = 2 and n = 3 was reduced compared to the simpler systems 5-AVA2PbBr4 and MAPbBr3\u2013a result that was not in line with what was reported for the corresponding systems featuring iodide in the inorganic layer. This may be a consequence of the intermolecular chemical bonding between the organic and inorganic moieties and merits a detailed study. The crystal structures of [HOOC(CH2)4NH3]2PbBr4 and [HOOC(CH2)4NH3]2PbCl4, showing the local nature of hydrogen- and pnictogen bonding interactions formed by the halides and the ammonium head of the cation, as well as between the halides and the two methyl groups the organic cation, are shown in Figure 22 [147]. The N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds formed by ammonium moiety are significantly stronger than the \u2013(H)C\u2013 H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds formed by the methyl moieties (Figure 22a). There is a network of pnictogen bonds in the crystal that appear in two varieties, with r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) of 3.602 and 3.498 \u00c5; the first is less directional than the second (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 156.4\u25e6 vs. 161.3\u25e6, Figure 22b). The large deviation from linearity is because there is competition between all three H atoms of the ammonium moiety for formation of hydrogen bonds of appreciable strengths (based on the H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br bond distances). The structure of [HOOC(CH2)4NH3]2PbCl4 features virtually similar intermolecular bonding at the interface region between the halides and the ammonium head (Figure 22c,d). The N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonding and N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonding interactions reported by Hillebrecht [148] are slightly different to those reported by Yang and coworkers [109]. Nevertheless, the overall nature of the local topology of non-covalent interactions is very such similar. It was argued [109] that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding in AVA2PbCl4 causes a larger cation penetration depth that enables larger structural deformation than that observed in the reference system PDAPbCl4 (PDA = pentamethylenediammonium). The deformation of the PbCl6 octahedra leads to ultrabroadband emission in AVA2PbCl4, which has an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (2.83%) compared to PDAPbCl4 (0.4%). This led to the suggestion that the role played by intermolecular interactions results in the modulation of the photophysical properties of 2D perovskites, and this will be beneficial for the design of green perovskites for optoelectronic applications.\nInt.

J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 46 of 61\nThe crystal structure of CH3NH2\u2013CH3NH3PbI3, Figure 23b, was also considered to involve H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds between the organic moieties CH3NH2 and CH3NH3+) [155]. The CH3NH2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CH3NH3+ dimers in the CH3NH2\u2013CH3NH3PbI3 intermediates were accompanied by 1D-PbI3\u2212 chains (\u03b4-phase). The weakly hydrogen-bonded CH3NH2 molecules could be easily released from the CH3NH2\u2013CH3NH3PbI3 intermediates, probably causing rapid, spontaneous phase transition from 1D-PbI3\u2212 (\u03b4-phase) to 3D-PbI3\u2212 (\u03b1-phase). From the crystal structure shown in Figure 23b we found that, in addition to H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds formed by the methylamine and methylammonium moieties, there are also weak C\u2013N\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 I pnictogen bonds in the crystal that are directional. The weak aspect of these bonds is evident from the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I intermolecular distances (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.655 \u00c5; \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 176.5\u25e6) that are less than the vdW radii sum of N and I atoms, 3.70 \u00c5, and are longer than N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonds found in the [C6H18N2]2Sb2Br10 crystal (Figure 23a). Senior and coworkers [157] have reported the crystal structures of six halobismuth(III) salts of a variety of substituted aminopyridinium cations. These crystals feature discrete mononuclear [BiCl6]3\u2212 and binuclear [Bi2X10]4\u2212 anions (X = Cl or Br), and polymeric cis-double-halo-bridged [BinX4n]n\u2212 anionic chains (X = Br or I).

The Bi(III) centers in this and other crystals adopted a slightly distorted octahedral geometry and there was a correlation between the Bi\u2014X bond lengths and the number of classic N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonds that the X ligand accepts, with a greater number of interactions corresponding with slightly longer Bi\u2014X distances. The supramolecular networks formed by classic N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonds include ladders, bilayers and three-dimensional frameworks. As shown in Figure 23c, the geometric stability of (C5H9N3)2[Bi2Cl10]\u00b72H2O not only emerges from the hydrogen bonds, but also C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonds that are somewhat stronger than the C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br and C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I found in the crystals shown Figure 23a,b, respectively. The structure of catena-[methylammonium bis(\u00b5-iodo)-iodo-lead monohydrate (CH6N+)(I3Pb\u2212)n,(H2O) [158] is shown in Figure 23d. The crystal is a needle-shaped solvation intermediate similar to CH3NH3PbI3\u00b7DMF that has been recognized as the main cause for the incomplete coverage of the resultant thin film. By avoiding these intermediates, the films crystallized at the gas\u2013solid interface offer several beneficial features for device performance including high surface coverage, small surface roughness, as well as controllable grain size. The stability of the intermediate is organized by N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I and N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds, and directional C\u2014N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I pnictogen bonds. Another illustrative 1D perovskite system in 1D, [(C8H12N)2(PbI4)]n, that crystallizes as an organic-inorganic hybrid is shown in Figure 24 [159]. The structure consists of chains of [PbI2]\u2212 units extending along the crystallographic b axis. In the asymmetric unit Pb is on a twofold axis and the two I atoms are in general positions. Each Pb atom is octahedrally coordinated to six I atoms, arranged as chains of edge-sharing octahedra. The N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen-bonding interactions between the three H atoms of the ammonium group of the organic cation and the metal coordinate I atoms (r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) 2.566, 2.835 and 3.147 \u00c5); these are stronger than the C\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I formed by a methyl group of the same cation and the coordinate I atoms (viz. r(H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) 3.312 and 3.393 \u00c5). There are also C\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 hydrogen bonds between the ammonium and methyl groups of one organic cation and the arene ring system of another cation, as well as the formation of arene C\u2013 H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I hydrogen bonds and weakly bound Type-I I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I close contacts. Apart from these, the N site of the ammonium group is involved in forming pnictogen bonds with the nearest I sites of the inorganic framework, Figure 24 (right). These pnictogen bonds are quasi-linear, with (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I) = 3.634 \u00c5; \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7I = 177.7\u25e6.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 47 of 61\nInt. J. Mol.

The nearest centroid-centroid distance (3.86(4) \u00c5) is indicative of \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions and the nearest hydrogen to centroid interactions (2.82(3) \u00c5) contribute to the stability of crystal structure through C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions. The study did not consider the possibility of C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl pnictogen bonding in the crystal, which we identified to be directional and strong compared to that found in the crystal of [CoCl22\u2212][C2H10N22+]2[Cl\u2212]2, Figure 25a. For instance, the pnictogen bond in the crystal in Figure 25a (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.275 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 173.5o) is weaker and less directional than that in Figure 25b (r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.177 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 177.2o). (C6H7NCl)3(BiCl6)\u00b7H2O, Figure 25c [165], is a non-centrosymmetric organic-inorganic metallate complex and synthesized at room temperature. The cohesion between the organic and inorganic entities was suggested to be driven by N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl, N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O, C\u2013 H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl and O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonding interactions between the 4-dichloroanilinium cations, the [BiCl6]3\u2212 anions and water molecules, thus forming a pseudo-3D network. Our investigation of the crystal, however, revealed that pnictogen bonds also contribute to the cohesion of the system; this was overlooked in the original study. The pnictogen bonds appear at different intermolecular distances, Figure 25c; one of them has r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.231 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 175.6\u25e6, and the other has r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.214 \u00c5 and \u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl = 179.3\u25e6. The orthorhombic organic-inorganic compound (C2H10N22+)2,(MnBr2\u2212)(Br\u2212)2, Figure 25d [166], is a 0D structure. The authors examined intermolecular interactions using single crystal X-ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses. It was found that this system exhibits an optical bandgap of 2.61 eV, a strong photoluminescence excitation line at 362 nm and a strong fluorescence at 537 nm and that the hybrid material features good thermal stability (decomposition temperature: 288\u2013660 \u25e6C). Their structural analysis suggested that the inorganic anions are stabilized by [NH3CH2CH2NH3]2+ dications via an extensive number of H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br hydrogen bonds. However, we also found the presence of N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br pnictogen bonds in the crystal. These are formed between N of ammonium moiety and Br of four-coordinate MnBr42\u2212; they are quasi-linear (\u2220C\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br = 174.8\u25e6) and r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br) = 3.386 \u00c5). Shown in Figure 26a,b are the crystal structures of bis(1,4-phenylenediammonium) hexachloro-lead(II) [2(C12H14N22+)2(PbCl64\u2212) reported by two different groups [167,168]. Whilst the nature of intermolecular interactions between the interacting organic and inorganic moieties are virtually similar, they differ in the intermolecular bond distances and bond angles. The PbCl64\u2212 octahedra are not linked to each other; this is therefore not a 1D crystal structure. The three H atoms of the ammonium head of the diammonium cation are involved in four N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl hydrogen bonds with bond distances of 2.278, 2.255, 2.356 and 2.883 \u00c5 (Figure 26a) and 2.282, 2.315, 2.547 and 2.885 \u00c5 (Figure 26b). The first three short bonds are Type-II interactions and the fourth is bent. The H atoms of the arene moiety placed close to the PbCl64\u2212 octahedra are also hydrogen bonded, with C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl in the range 2.8\u20133.0 \u00c5. Apart from these, the N site in the ammonium heads of the diammonium cation are pnictogen bonded, with r(N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl) = 3.550 \u00c5 in Figure 26a and 3.382 \u00c5 in Figure 26b. These interactions are more directional (\u2220N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl close 176.4\u25e6 or 176.6\u25e6) than the two types of short hydrogen bonds noted above (\u2220C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl varies between 141\u25e6 and 172\u25e6).\nInt.

As can be seen, the nature of nature of the normal distribution of the angle \u2220R\u2013N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X is very similar when X = Br and X = Cl. A significant population occurs between 155\u25e6 and 170\u25e6 both for X = Cl and X = Br. However, the normal distribution curve associated with X = Cl shows that N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Cl close contacts are largely in the range 3.2\u20133.6 \u00c5 with a peak around 3.4 \u00c5. This was not the case when X = Br, where the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Br close contacts are largely in the 3.4\u20133.8 \u00c5 with a peak around 3.5 \u00c5. These results suggest that N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X intermolecular distance can be longer than the sum of the vdW radii of N and X in many crystals."

            "text": "This overview focused on several crystal structures, formed between various organic and inorganic moieties, to reveal the frequent existence of nitrogen-centered charge-assisted pnictogen bonding interactions; these have been largely overlooked in the metal halide perovskite literature. Since our motivation was to draw attention to the occurrence of this type of interaction in crystals, we examined its chemical manifestations. Our review of crystals structures deposited in the CSD suggests that N in ammonium derivatives is a potential pnictogen bond donor, and is, in part at least, responsible for the stability and functionality of many organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite systems, and hence could be exploited in the design of novel materials for photovoltaics, photocatalysis and other optoelectronics. Our analysis suggests that the ammonium parts of mono-, bi- and multi-functional organic cations interact attractively with halogen atoms of the inorganic counterparts of the metal halide perovskites in two ways. Firstly, the N atom forms directional pnictogen bonding interactions with the bridging halogen sites of the MX6n\u2212 octahedra of the inorganic counterpart. Secondly, the H atoms form hydrogen bonding interactions either with the bridging halogens and/or terminal halogen atoms, depending on the architectures of the organic cations and inorganic anions. Based on the spatial orientation of the organic cation, an additive, a single H-atom in the ammonium fragment could sustain an attractive engagement with at least two halogen atoms of the inorganic octahedra, thus forming a bior tri-furcated interaction bonding topology. In cases where one of the terminal sites of the organic cation is \u2013H, \u2013X, or \u2013CH3, the formation of charge-assisted H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonding, or X\u2032\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X halogen bonding, or H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X/C\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen/tetrel bonding interactions between the organic cation and inorganic metal halide anion framework is a likely outcome. These, together with the attractive engagements driven by the ammonium part of the organic cation, act as forces that hold the layered inorganic framework together in low dimension and hence provide stability to the overall geometry of the organic-inorganic metal halide compounds. The tilting of the MX6 octahedra of the inorganic framework in halide-based perovskites is often found to be driven by the competition between N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X pnictogen bonding, H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7X hydrogen bonding and together with, when they occur, other non-covalent interactions. This attribute is shown through several illustrative crystal systems, including, for instance, orthorhombic MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) systems in 3D (Figure 4), and those shown in Figures 14\u201316, Figures 18\u201320 in 2D. What specific role does the nitrogen-centered pnictogen bonds play in determining the optoelectronic properties of the functional perovskite materials is not revealed in this study, and hence should be the topic of any future studies. We believe that the nitrogen-centered pnictogen bonding interactions revealed in this study\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8816 54 of 61\nwill be beneficial to those are interested in the development of novel organic-inorganic hybrid halide-based perovskite materials and beyond. While the complexation energy of several illustrative simplified ion-pairs examined in this study was very large owning to the dominance of coulombic interactions involved, the empirical relationship known between potential energy density at the bcp and interaction energy allowed us to suggest that pnictogen bonds explored in these models were locally of weak-to-medium strength, and hence their contribution to the crystal stability should be not overlooked. However, it should be kept in mind that the intermolecular interaction energies estimated from intermolecular bond critical point properties of electron densities could be inherently unreliable, since they typically underestimate, but sometimes overestimate, more reliable values. Conclusions drawn regarding the energetic importance of specific intermolecular interactions based on this empirical relationship can be misleading, especially in the context of crystal packing and crystal engineering [175]. These interactions appeared persistently regardless of whether the geometry of the ion-pair in the crystal, or optimized with MP2 and DFT, was used for QTAIM analysis; their feasibility in the ion-pair was also confirmed by NBO\u2019s second order analysis. Although it is not straightforward to quantify the energetic strength of each of the interaction types in each crystal system illustrated in this study, even with detailed computational studies, the simple model systems presented at the beginning of this overview may be considered for investigation using state of the art energy decomposition procedures, such as Interacting Quantum Atom Model, to quantify the strength of each of the interactions involved. In addition, charge density approaches (viz. ELF, RDG and QTAIM) may also be applicable to most of the crystal systems to explore the nature of various interlayer interactions that occur in the low dimensional crystal systems. These approaches allow one to visualize the nature of electron density localization, delocalization and depletion, among others. Future studies will address whether such computational and theoretical attempts would enable us to better understand the pnictogen-centered non-covalent bonding environments responsible not only for the stability of the crystals, but also their functionality in areas as diverse as optoelectronics.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, project design, and project administration, P.R.V.; formal analysis and investigation, P.R.V. and A.V.; supervision, P.R.V.; writing\u2014original draft, P.R.V. and A.V.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.R.V., H.M.M., A.V. and K.Y.
