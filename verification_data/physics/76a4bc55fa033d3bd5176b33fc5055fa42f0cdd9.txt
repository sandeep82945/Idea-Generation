Based on the provided text, the following sentences/portion of text mention future research directions:

1. "However, the mechanism of transformation and formation of IBPs is not yet fully understood."
2. "However, the changes in different phenolic fractions and their impact on antioxidant potential upon processing are poorly understood."
3. "Nevertheless, IBPs are often ignored as they require special treatment to release them from the food matrix, and hence, their actual phenolic content and activities are underestimated."
4. "Moreover, due to the high extraction temperature, thermosensitive compounds (e.g., anthocyanins) could be degraded."
5. "However, this is a complex process that requires well-defined conditions to ensure a good recovery."
6. "Moreover, this process must be conducted in the dark under a nitrogen/argon atmosphere for 1â€“4 h to prevent oxidation."
7. "The bioavailability of IBPs is mostly very low, which is mainly linked to the structure of the food matrix which severely delays the hydrolysis of IBPs, causing low bioaccessibility."

These sentences suggest areas within the study of insoluble-bound phenolics (IBPs) that require further investigation or present challenges that future research could address.
