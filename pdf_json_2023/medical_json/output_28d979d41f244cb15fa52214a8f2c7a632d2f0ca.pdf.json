The\nplatelets cannot aggregate ex vivo with physiologic agonists of activation, although\nmicrofluidic analysis with whole blood displays moderate ex vivo platelet adhesion and\naggregation consistent with mild bleeding. Immunocytometry shows reduced expression of\n\u03b1IIb\u03b23 on quiescent platelets that spontaneously bind/store fibrinogen, and activationdependent antibodies (ligand-induced binding site\u2013319.4 and PAC-1) report \u03b23 extension suggesting an intrinsic activation phenotype. Genetic analysis reveals a single F153S\u03b23 substitution within the \u03b2I-domain from a heterozygous T556C nucleotide substitution of ITGB3 exon 4 in conjunction with a previously reported IVS5(+1)G>A splice site mutation\nwith undetectable platelet messenger RNA accounting for hemizygous expression of S153\u03b23. F153 is completely conserved among \u03b23 of several species and all human \u03b2-integrin subunits suggesting that it may play a vital role in integrin structure/function. Mutagenesis of \u03b1IIbF153S\u03b23 also displays reduced levels of a constitutively activated \u03b1IIb-S153\u03b23 on HEK293T cells. The overall structural analysis suggests that a bulky aromatic, nonpolar amino acid\n(F,W)153\u03b23 is critical for maintaining the resting conformation of \u03b12- and \u03b11-helices of the \u03b2I-domain because small amino acid substitutions (S,A) facilitate an unhindered inward movement of the \u03b12- and \u03b11-helices of the \u03b2I-domain toward the constitutively active \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformation, while a bulky aromatic, polar amino acid (Y) hinders such movements and\nrestrains \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation. The data collectively demonstrate that disruption of F153\u03b23 can significantly alter normal integrin/platelet function, although reduced expression of \u03b1IIbS153\u03b23 may be compensated by a hyperactive conformation that promotes viable hemostasis.\nuary 2024\nFebruary 2023; prepublished online on 3; final version published online 3 July s.2022009495.\norresponding author, David A.

            "text": "Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is a heterodimer complex present in a quiescent state on the surface of resting platelets, which upon platelet activation assumes an extended conformation that mediates platelet aggregation by binding fibrinogen and other adhesive proteins.1,2 The receptor also facilitates spreading of platelets on the subendothelial matrix and plays a role in thrombus formation at the site of vascular injury.3,4 Integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is normally expressed at ~80 000 copies on the platelet surface.5,6 The genes ITGA2B and ITGB3 encoding \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 respectively are colocalized on chromosome 17q21.31-32.7-9 To date, several hundred unique molecular genetic mutations have been characterized in \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that causes a rare autosomal recessive inherited platelet bleeding disorder named Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) after the Swiss pediatrician, Eduard Glanzmann who first described the disorder in 1918.10,11 The prevalence of GT is estimated to be 1:1 million people.12 Genetic abnormalities of ITGA2B and ITGB3 cause quantitative and/or qualitative deficiencies of \u03b1IIb\u03b23, which disrupt platelet function leading to uncontrolled bleeding.13 Platelet function testing is routinely used in combination with immunocytometry that measures the level of \u03b1IIb (CD41) and \u03b23 (CD61) on the platelet surface to help provide a clinical diagnosis of GT and distinguish between subtypes I or II.14 Variant forms of GT have also been reported with moderate to normal levels of a functionally defective \u03b1IIb\u03b23.15,16 The identification of genetic variations capable of causing GT has accelerated recently through the use of next-generation whole-exome sequence analysis.17 Genetic defects discovered in ITGA2B or ITGB3 have been organized into an international database managed by the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) to assist ongoing efforts to better understand GT. The nature and position of each mutation has helped characterize the relationship between integrin structure and function that plays a vital role in platelet response to vascular injury.18\nThis study explores the significance of a constitutively active form of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 with a novel F153S amino acid (aa) substitution in the \u03b2I-domain of \u03b23 expressed at reduced levels on platelets from a patient with a mild form of GT. Functional analysis was performed both on human platelets and transfected cells coexpressing \u03b1IIb with different aa forms of 153\u03b23. Our goal is to understand the importance of maintaining the structure of the \u03b2Idomain of \u03b23 by establishing the role F153\u03b23 plays in integrin activation. Structural analysis of resting and active \u03b23 conformations highlighted a potential mechanism for the inward movement of the \u03b12-helix that was associated with a wellcharacterized inward movement of the \u03b11-helix. The results suggest that the 153aa of \u03b23 requires a bulky aromatic and nonpolar side chain under the \u03b12-helix to sterically restrain its unprovoked inward movement toward the active conformation. The bulky to small residue change of F153S\u03b23 facilitates an unregulated movement of \u03b12-helix to transform \u03b1IIb\u03b23 into a constitutively active conformation with (1) spontaneous binding of fibrinogen, (2) functional transport of fibrinogen to \u03b1-granules, and (3) residual platelet function in a microfluidic assay that may help explain the mild phenotype of the patient.\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13"

Quantitative analysis of the patient\u2019s platelet proteins lysed in SDS show reduced integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and fibrinogen levels consistent with variant form of GT. (A) Immunoblot analysis using Abs specific for detection of \u03b1IIb, \u03b23, or GPIb\u03b1 within platelet protein lysates. Increasing quantities of SDS\u2013platelet protein lysates ranging from 25 to 250 ng were loaded into separate lanes of 10% polyacrylamide gels (PAGEs) and electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were incubated with goat anti-human polyclonal antibodies to \u03b1IIb (136 kDa), \u03b23 (125 kDa), or a mAb to human GPIb\u03b1 (165 kDa). Immunoreactive bands were detected with an horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated 2oAb followed by chemiluminescence exposure on radiograph film or a digital imager. The result shown is a representative blot (n \u2265 3 at 7 different lysate concentrations) demonstrating \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 appear present at reduced density levels in the GT lysates compared with the WT control, whereas GPIb\u03b1 appears at similar levels in GT vs WT. (B) Quantitative band density measurements performed with Image J software using photographic film of the immunoblots in panel A exposed to\nchemiluminescence demonstrate that patient with GT \u03b1IIb (30% \u00b1 8%) and \u03b23 (39% \u00b1 11%) is present at reduced levels when comparing the band density with the WT control. As anticipated, the platelet GPIb\u03b1 levels of patient with GT (94% \u00b1 11%) are nearly identical to a WT control arbitrarily set at 100% in each image. The graphs show MFI in density units for measurements at different concentrations in panel A and converted to percentage \u00b1 SEM of WT arbitrarily set at 100% for each representative blot (n = 4). (C) Western\nimmunoblot analysis of platelet protein lysates to detect fibrinogen. Protein (10 \u03bcg) was loaded onto a 4% to 20% gradient PAGE and SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was incubated with mouse mAb (5C5) directed against the fibrinogen \u03b1-chain (60 kDa). Immunoreactive bands were detected by horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled m-IgG\u0138 binding protein, followed by chemiluminescence and detection on photographic film or digital analyzer. As expected,\nfibrinogen detected in WT platelets was arbitrarily set as the normal level in the (+) control (blue). The apparent absence of fibrinogen in patients with GT type I (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-deficient) platelets served as a (\u2212) control (yellow). Although in stark contrast, appreciable levels were observed in our sample from patient with GT (red). Shown is results of 1\nrepresentative blot (n = 4) measured at 3 different exposure times. (D) Fibrinogen band density measurements performed on immunoblot in panel C with Image J software on a\nscan of the photographic film or digital image used to quantitate the protein level in platelet lysates showed that fibrinogen of patients with GT is present at 34% \u00b1 3% of WT\nlevels of fibrinogen consistent with the levels of \u03b1IIb and \u03b23 detected in panel C, while type I GT (\u2212) control had 1.2% \u00b1 0.7% of normal levels.

Interestingly, whole blood microfluidics analysis performed ex vivo on a collagen-coated surface revealed that the GT platelets could adhere and aggregate using physiological flow conditions (650 s\u22121) to the collagen surface at moderate levels (17.8% \u00b1 0.2%) of the area threshold compared with a WT control (75.1% \u00b1 1.3%) covering a relatively equal area of interest. This may likely account for the patient\u2019s relatively mild bleeding history (Figure 1A). Next, immunocytometry revealed that GT platelets had significantly reduced surface expression of integrin \u03b1\u0406\u0406b (7% \u00b1 3%) and \u03b23 (12% \u00b1 3%) compared with a\n3184 KOUKOURITAKI et al\nnormal WT control arbitrarily set at 100%. As anticipated, GPIb\u03b1 was detected at nearly equal levels in GT vs WT platelets (103% \u00b1 4%) (Figure 1B). Because the patient only has a mild bleeding history with reduced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 levels, immunocytometry was used next to investigate the relative activation state of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on quiescent and activated platelets. As anticipated, GT and WT platelets both showed a significant increase (20\u00d7) of the \u03b1-granule protein (P-selectin) on the platelet surface upon treatment with an agonist (+Ag) of platelet activation (Figure 1C panel 1). In addition, measurement of the MFI for \u03b23 indicated that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 density levels also\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nGenomic DNA\nWT Control\nG/G\nA\nITGB3_intron 5: gDNA 32582 G>A IVS5(+1)G A + Splice\nEXON 5 INTRON 5\nINTRON 5\nGT Patient\nG/A\nINTRON 5\nC\nThigh domain\n\u03b1IIb \u03b23\n\u03b2-propeller Hybrid\n\u03b2l-domain\n\u03b2TD\ndomain\nCalf-1 domain\nCalf-2 domain EGF-4\nEGF-3\nEGF-2\nEGF-1 PSI\nF153SPlatelet cDNA\nHemizygous ITGB3 c.556T>C F153S (F179S)\nB\nGT Patient\nC/C\nT/T\nWT Control\nEXON 4\nGT Patient\nWT Control\nITGB3_exon 4: gDNA 30776 T>C F153S (F179S)\nEXON 4\nT/T\nT/C\nFigure 3.

GT platelets continued to display a moderate 15% (\u2212Ag) to 20% (+Ag) of normal \u03b23 levels. Thus, P-selectin and \u03b23 levels each increased upon agonist treatment, presumably owing to the change in platelet shape and granular secretion causing additional receptor mobilization to the surface (Figure 1C). However, in stark contrast to WT control, GT quiescent platelets (\u2212Ag) bound activation-dependent Abs (LIBS-319.4 and PAC-1) and fibrinogen at ~5\u00d7 higher levels than WT quiescent platelets suggesting that GT \u03b1IIb\u03b23 existed in an extended conformation consistent with an intrinsic activation phenotype (Figure 1D). Interestingly, treatment of platelets with an RGD peptide only inhibited PAC-1 binding to GT platelets to preactivation levels, different from complete inhibition of WT platelet\u2019s ability to bind PAC-1 (Figure 1D panel 3). Western immunoblot analysis was performed to quantitate the total \u03b1IIb\u03b23 within platelet protein lysates (Figure 2A). Measurement of the density of each band confirmed that GT platelets had reduced levels of \u03b1IIb (30% \u00b1 8%) and \u03b23 (39% \u00b1 11%) compared with that of the WT control (Figure 2B). As anticipated, GPIb\u03b1 was detected at nearly equal levels in GT vs WT platelets (94% \u00b1 11%) (Figure 2B). This outcome is again consistent with variant type GT classification.10 Immunoblot analysis was also performed on platelet lysates to measure fibrinogen levels (Figure 2C). Density measurements detected background fibrinogen levels (1.2% \u00b1 0.7%) in the type I GT (\u2212) control, whereas the GT variant had\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\n(34% \u00b1 3%) of normal WT fibrinogen levels arbitrarily set at 100% (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the reduced level of fibrinogen in GT variant platelets is proportional to the decreased levels of \u03b1\u0406\u0406b\u03b23 in GT vs WT platelets (comparing panels B and D, Figure 2B,D). Finally, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy with washed and fixed/permeabilized platelets localized fibrinogen in a dispersed granular pattern in the GT and WT samples. Note, consistent with the immunoblot analysis, fibrinogen appeared at reduced fluorescence intensity in GT platelets (supplemental Figure 2). This result indicates that fibrinogen may spontaneously bind to the surface of quiescent GT platelets, which can then undergo \u03b1IIb\u03b23 receptor\u2013 mediated endocytosis as observed for the WT control.\nITGB3 sequencing reveals hemizygous expression of a mutant form of a highly conserved residue\nAll 30 exons of the ITGA2B and 15 exons of ITGB3 with their intronic splicing signals were amplified by PCR and screened by Sanger sequence analysis of gDNA isolated from leukocytes. Two distinct mutations were identified within ITGB3 (Figure 3A). The first mutation was located on intron 5, 1 nucleotide after the end of exon 5 with a substitution of G>A (lower left panel of Figure 3A). This splice site mutation IVS5(+1)G>A has been previously reported in the MCW GT database (Human Gene Mutation Database ID: CS011047) and is associated with type I GT.32,33 The second anomaly is a previously unreported mutation detected on exon 4 of ITGB3 as a single nucleotide T556C substitution\nGLANZMANN MUTATION MODULATES INTEGRIN ACTIVATION 3185\nAlignment: Ortholog\n\u03b2 \u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2 \u03b2\u03b1Paralog\nFigure 4.

Sequence alignment of partial amino acid sequence of ITGB3 (\u03b2I-domain, \u03b22-strand) from various species (ortholog alignment) and from various human \u03b2-subunits (paralog alignment) indicates that phenylalanine (F)153 mature \u03b23subunit (amino acid number is 179 including propeptide sequence) is 100% conserved among species and in all human integrin \u03b2-subunits.\nD ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/7/13/3180/2062892/blooda_adv-2022-009495-m ain.pdf by guest on 13 January 2024\n(lower right panel of Figure 3A). Additional sequence analysis of 20 PCR ITGB3 introns 3 to 5 gDNA clones verified that each mutation was on a different allele confirming compound heterozygosity (not shown). Remarkably, sequence analysis of platelet cDNA revealed the unique presence of only 1 transcript for the exon 4 ITGB3 mutation: c.556 T>C encoding a single amino acid change from Phe153 to Ser (F153S) (Figure 3B) suggesting that the intron 5 splice variant was degraded rapidly to create a hemizygous state. Structural analysis shows location of the F153S mutation on the head of the \u03b2I-domain of \u03b23 subunit (Figure 3C). Sequence alignment shows conservation of \u03b23 (\u03b2\u0406-domain, \u03b22-strand) from various species (ortholog alignment) and among various human \u03b2-subunits (paralog alignment) demonstrating that F153 is 100% conserved. This indicates that preservation of this structure likely plays an essential role in integrin function (Figure 4).\nF153S\u03b23 substitution disrupts integrin expression and function\nIn silico modeling and mutagenesis studies were performed for \u03b1IIb-F153S\u03b23 to investigate if substitution from a bulky aromatic to small amino acid residue can affect \u03b1IIb\u03b23 structure/function. The structure superimposition shows that F153 is buried underneath the \u03b12-helix in both active (open) and resting (closed) \u03b2I-domain conformation (Figure 5A). A previously unrecognized inward movement of \u03b12-helix was visualized in the active conformation of\n3186 KOUKOURITAKI et al\n\u03b2I-domain (Figure 5A). A closer view of the \u03b23 structure shows that F153 resides on the \u03b22-strand, with the bulky side chain filled in between \u03b12-helix and \u03b22-strand (Figure 5B). The bulky aromatic structure of F153 appears capable of limiting the inward movement of \u03b12-helix and, thus, helps maintain the resting conformation (Figure 5B, top). The substitution from a bulky aromatic, nonpolar F to a small, polar S appears to allow additional space for \u03b12-helix to assume an active conformation (Figure 5B, bottom). Cell surface expression measured by anti-\u03b23 (mAb AP3) showed a dramatic reduction of \u03b1IIb-S153\u03b23 expression (~15% of WT levels) (Figure 5C). This result was further confirmed by the detection of \u03b1IIb-S153\u03b23 at reduced levels (~10% to 20% of WT) with a panel of mAbs (10E5 and HIP8 that recognize \u03b1IIb; VIPL2 against \u03b23; AP2 and 7E3 against \u03b1IIb\u03b23 complex) (Figure 5C). This finding is consistent with decreased levels of \u03b23 (~12% to 20% of WT) detected on GT platelets in Figure 1B-C and further supports that the F153S\u03b23 mutation adversely affects \u03b1IIb\u03b23 biosynthesis and surface expression. Additional analysis of integrin outside-in activation with Mn2+ shows as expected, WT \u03b1IIb-F153\u03b23 could only bind PAC-1 in the presence of Mn2+ (Figure 5D). In contrast, \u03b1IIbS153\u03b23 bound PAC-1 significantly greater than \u03b1IIb-F153\u03b23 in both resting (Mg2+) and active (Mn2+) conditions (Figure 5D). PAC-1 binding was inhibited by the presence of fibrinogen. These data are consistent with the GT platelet assays showing a constitutively active conformation of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 owing to the F153S\u03b23 mutation.\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nA Active (open) Resting (closed)\nPhenylalanine (F): WT Bulky/Nonpolar\nB\nSerine (S) Small/Polar\nC 120 100\n80 60 40 20\n0\nM FI\nin %\no f W\nT\nF153-WT F153S\n+ \u03b1IIb-WT\nAP3 (\u03b23)\nVIPL2 (\u03b23)\nAP2 (\u03b1IIb\u03b23) 7E3 (\u03b1IIb\u03b23) 10E5 (\u03b1IIb) HIP8 (\u03b1IIb)\nD 80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nPA C-\n1 bin\ndin g\n(n or\nm ali\nze d\nM FI\nin %\n)\nF153-WT F153S\n+ \u03b1IIb-WT\n**\n**\n** * \u2013 Fg, Ca/Mg \u2013 Fg, Ca/Mn + Fg, Ca/Mg + Fg, Ca/Mn\nV207\nF153\n\u03b22-strand\n\u03b12-helix\nHybrid domain\n\u03b21-\u03b11 loop\n\u03b2l dom ain\n\u03b26 -\u03b1\n7 loo\np\nF203\nFigure 5. The F153S\u03b23 mutation exerts functional effect on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 surface expression and ligand binding. (A) Superimposition of crystal structures of normal \u03b1IIbF153\u03b23 globular head region, highlighting the structural changes of \u03b23 I domain from resting (in green) to active state (in blue). The metal ions of MIDAS and ADMIDAS are shown as spheres. The red side chain localizes 153aa in the core of \u03b2I-domain in the central part of \u03b2-sheet number 2, which is underneath the \u03b12-helix. An inward movement of \u03b12-helix is noted along with the inward movement of \u03b21-\u03b11 loop and \u03b11/\u03b11\u2032-helix, and the downward movement of \u03b26-\u03b17 loop and \u03b17-helix. The structural comparison was made using PDB 2vdo and 3fcs with PyMol. (B) In silico mutagenesis of F153\u03b23. The hydrophobic interaction between F153 and the residues V207 and F203 of \u03b12-helix in the WT form is shown (top). The S153 mutation losses the bulky hydrophobic contact with the \u03b12-helix is shown (bottom). The F153S mutation may render \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively active by facilitating an unrestricted inward movement of \u03b12- and \u03b11-helices during the conformational transition of the \u03b23 integrin from a resting to an active state, because bulky/nonpolar to small/polar amino acid side chain provide space for structural change to facilitate increased movement. Enlarged images of the \u03b22-strand \u03b2I-domain also predict the effect on Van der Waal force (red cloud) resulting from the change in structure of the \u03b23 153aa side-chain going from bulky F to small S. Changes induced by F153S\u03b23 are depicted in the smaller and hydrophilic serine residue, which also may introduce disorganization by permitting entrance of water molecules that may competitively form H-bonds with oxygen\natoms or NH2-groups of constituent amino acid of the core and disrupt structure. In silico mutagenesis were made in PyMol using PDB 2vdo and 3fcs.

Integrin \u03b1IIb and F153\u03b23 or S153\u03b23 subunits plus GFP were cotransfected into HEK293FT cells. Harvested cells were incubated with indicated mAb and then GFP+ cells were analyzed for MFI of mAb binding on the cell surface via immunocytometry. The S153\u03b23 mutant is observed to be expressed at ~10% to 20% of F153\u03b23 (WT). Data are presented as percent of WT control, MFI arbitrarily set at 100% (n = 3).

Integrin-positive cells were analyzed for PAC-1 MFI binding.

The aromatic structure of W and Y were used to compare with F, whereas the small, nonpolar A was used to compare with small, polar S (Figure 6A). The activation status of each \u03b1IIb\u03b23 construct was assessed by coexpression with either a GFP control or GFP-TH to induce integrin inside-out activation. Cell surface expression measured by anti-\u03b23 mAb AP3 showed a dramatic reduction of \u03b1IIb-S153\u03b23 expression, whereas expression levels of \u03b1IIb-(A,Y,W)153\u03b23 mutants were not significantly different from the WT \u03b1IIb-F153\u03b23 (Figure 6B). Interestingly,\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nPAC-1 binding showed a remarkable correlation between residue size at position 153 and the activation status of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (Figure 6C). Specifically, \u03b1IIb-(S,A)153\u03b23 were both in a constitutively active conformation capable of binding PAC-1 in the absence/presence of inside-out activation with GFP-TH (Figure 6C). Of note, the W153\u03b23 mutant activation was indistinguishable fromWT F153\u03b23, whereas Y153\u03b23 mutant suppressed GFP-TH\u2013induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, suggesting that addition of a polar charge on a bulky aromatic amino acid may hinder the change of \u03b12-helix toward an active conformation (Figure 6C). These data demonstrate that a bulky aromatic, nonpolar residue on 153 of \u03b23 appears essential for maintaining normal integrin function because a small amino acid substitution (nonpolar or polar) at this position (as observed in the patient with GT) renders \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively active on the platelet surface.\nGLANZMANN MUTATION MODULATES INTEGRIN ACTIVATION 3187\nPhenylalanine (F): WT Bulky/Nonpolar\nTyrosine (Y) Bulky/Polar Tryptophan (W) Bulky/Nonpolar Alanine (A) Small/Nonpolar\nA\nSerine (S) Small/Polar\nB\n6.0 2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n4.0\nInt eg\nrin (M\nFI x\n10 5 )\nEG FP\n-T H\n(M FI\nx 10 6 ) 2.0\n0.0\n\u03b23 -W\nT\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 S\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 W\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 A\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 Y\n+ \u03b1IIb\u2013WT GFP GFP-TH GFP-TH expression\nTotal \u03b23 Surface Expression C\n150\n100\n50\n0\nPA C-\n1 bin\ndin g\n(n or\nm ali\nze d\nM FI\nin % ) \u03b23 -W T\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 S\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 W\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 A\n\u03b23 -F1\n53 Y\n+ \u03b1IIb\u2013WT\n**\n***\nn.s.\n***\n***\nGFP GFP-TH\nActivated \u03b23 Expression PAC-1 binding\nP = .06 *\nV207\n\u03b22-strand\nF203\nFigure 6. Expression analysis of several mutants suggests that 153aa of \u03b23 with a bulky aromatic and nonpolar structure can maintain normal integrin expression and function. (A) In silico mutagenesis of F153\u03b23 with small and bulky amino acid shows the space filling effect of the sidechain volumes. The F153S and F153A mutations may render \u03b1IIb\u03b23 constitutively active by facilitating an unrestricted inward movement of \u03b12-helix during the conformational transition of the \u03b23 integrin from a resting to an active state, whereas the F153W and F153Y may limit such movement. In silico mutagenesis were made in PyMol using PDB 2vdo and 3fcs. The resting and active\nconformations of \u03b12-helix are highlighted in green and blue, respectively. (B) Immunofluorescent cytometric analysis to quantitate MFI expression levels of transgenic mutant \u03b23integrin on the surface of HEK293FT. Integrin \u03b1IIb and mutated \u03b23 subunits plus GFP or GFP-TH (talin-head integrin activation construct) were cotransfected into HEK293FT cells. Harvested cells were then labeled with an anti-\u03b23 mAb (AP3). GFP immunofluorescence was used as a control for transfection efficiency and integrin double-positive cells were analyzed for their MFI of either AP3 or GFP by immunocytometry. Results show that there is a significant reduction in the cell surface integrin expression of GT mutation (\u03b23F153S) compared with the WT control (\u03b23-WT) whereas there is no statistical significance in total \u03b23 surface expression between the WT and the other \u03b23 variants (F153W, F153A, and F153Y). Data are presented as mean MFI + SEM (n \u2265 3) and unpaired 2-tailed Student t test was performed to compare the mutants with WT under the same condition or as indicated (P = .06).

Integrin \u03b1IIb and indicated \u03b23 subunits plus GFP or GFP-TH are cotransfected into HEK293FT cells. Integrin and GFP double-positive cells were analyzed for the PAC-1 binding via immunocytometry. PAC-1 binding was quantified and normalized to the total integrin expression showing that (1) bulky aromatic, nonpolar (F,W) are activated\nidentically; (2) bulky aromatic polar (Y) activation is negatively disrupted; and (3) small, polar and nonpolar side-chains (S,A) place \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in a constitutively activate confirmation without (red bar) or with (blue bar) talin head domain present. PAC-1 binding is normalized to the total integrin expression.

            "text": "This study characterizes a novel variant GT associated with a gainof-function F153S\u03b23 mutation within the \u03b2I-domain of \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The GT platelets contain a heterozygous ITGB3 variant of F153S and a loss-of-expression mutation, suggesting that the novel phenotype is solely attributed to the F153S mutation. Interestingly, a paradox was presented because the patient was clinically diagnosed with GT based upon blood tests, although he does not display the GT bleeding phenotype because his platelets have functionality in vivo (evidenced by >40 years of mild bleeding without severe hemorrhage amid a reportedly very physically active lifestyle prone to injury). This observation inspired a detailed examination to unravel\n3188 KOUKOURITAKI et al\nthe enigma presented because the patient\u2019s platelets failed to aggregate ex vivo in response to all physiologic agonists except ristocetin consistent with the clinical diagnosis of GT.13 Furthermore, there was significantly decreased expression of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the surface of the patient\u2019s platelets, although the GT platelets appear to maintain relatively normal function including fibrinogen storage and \u03b1-granule secretion. Interestingly, a microfluidic assay using whole blood demonstrated that the platelets retain a modest level of adhesion and aggregation on a collagen-coated chamber under physiological shear flow. This result is consistent with the observation of viable hemostatic function in vivo. Remarkably, these GT platelets bind fibrinogen and activation-dependent Abs in the\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nD ow nloaded from http://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article-pdf/7/13/3180/2062892/blooda_adv-2022-009495-m ain.pdf by guest on 13 January 2024\nabsence or presence of physiological agonists of platelet activation demonstrating that \u03b1IIb\u03b23 exists in a constitutively active conformation. Different from other previously described GT variants with gain-of-function \u03b23 mutations (including the I-EGF domain mutations and a recent \u03b2I N331S mutation),34 this patient with F153S\u03b23 GT exhibits no apparent macrothrombocytopenia with a mild bleeding phenotype, suggesting discovery of a unique GT variant.\nStructural and functional analysis indicate a plausible molecular mechanism for rendering F153S\u03b23 in a constitutively active conformation. Crystallographic and mutagenesis studies depict major structural changes occurring within the \u03b11- and \u03b17-helices and their connecting loops upon \u03b2I-domain activation.23,35 This report observed a subtle conformational change of \u03b12-helix in the active state of \u03b2I-domain, the significance of which in regulating integrin activation was not appreciated previously. Furthermore, mutagenesis studies suggest that the bulky aromatic, nonpolar sidechain of F153\u03b23 appears to be vital for keeping \u03b12-helix in a normal resting conformation. The hydrophobic interaction between F153 on \u03b22-strand and the conserved F203 and V207 on \u03b12-helix appears essential to limit movement of the \u03b12-helix toward an active state on quiescent platelets, because reducing the size of F153 with the S or A substitution permits increased movement of \u03b12-helix and shifts \u03b2I-domain to the active conformation. However, addition of a hydroxy group with a F153Y substitution hinders movement of the \u03b12-helix because \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation was completely blocked. Thus, the constitutively active F153S\u03b23 GT variant reveals new information concerning the regulation of \u03b23 activation through the interaction of a bulky aromatic residue on \u03b22-strand and \u03b12-helix. Further mutagenesis studies examining variants of F203\u03b23 and V207\u03b23 or equivalent F153 mutations in other \u03b2-integrins will likely advance our understanding of the mechanism of integrin activation.36\nCharacterization of molecular genetic defects discovered within patients with GT has revealed a wealth of information for >30 years concerning the effect of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 structure on integrin and platelet function.10,13,14 Many times it has been the rare variant forms of GT including \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutations of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 that have been particularly interesting because they present a variety of effects on integrin structure/function associated with disease.10 In this manner, this study reveals a novel GT variant of F153S\u03b23 with reduced surface expression but constitutively active phenotype. This finding helps provide new insight on a mutation expressed at subnormal levels but compensated by constitutive activation leading to altered albeit viable platelet function and achieves hemostasis sufficient to permit a mild bleeding phenotype associated with strenuous physical activity, a finding that may reveal a new target on \u03b1IIb\u03b23 for antithrombotic therapy. However, new questions arise that require further study concerning how the F153S\u03b23 mutation may alter the kinetics of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 conformational change in resting and activated platelets. This may be clarified with additional analysis of mutant \u03b1IIb\u03b23 response to other physiological ligands or ligand-mimetic inhibitors,22 such as seen with the RGD peptide. Interestingly, F153\u03b23 permits fibrinogen binding and receptormediated endocytosis, although detailed immunogenic studies using confocal and electronic microscopy employing specific markers for fibrinogen and endocytic vesicles may enhance our understanding of the process. Also, it may be of particular interest to hematologists whether the constitutively active phenotype of F153S\u03b23 can increase the risk of thrombosis and whether patients\n11 JULY 2023 \u2022 VOLUME 7, NUMBER 13\nwith GT with gain-of-function mutations require recombinant factor VIIa as a preventive measure against surgical bleeding. Finally, it is apparent that this patient\u2019s mild bleeding phenotype is consistent with intact clot retraction capability. However, measurement of the ability of F153\u03b23 platelets to maintain sustained aggregation, clot retraction, and thrombus formation could provide profound clinical benefit.37 Technologies generating genetically-altered platelets and megakaryocytes derived from hematopoietic stem cells should aid future efforts to answer these questions.19,38-40"
