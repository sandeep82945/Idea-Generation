 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct qualitative research with a larger sample of trans individuals in Portugal to gain a broader understanding of their experiences with physical activity and sports. The current study only examined one person's perspective. 

2. Examine the impact of gender-affirming medical treatments like hormone therapy and surgery on trans individuals' participation and experiences with sports and exercise. The current study briefly touched on surgery being a facilitator. More research could explore this relationship further.

3. Develop and evaluate interventions aimed at reducing discrimination and improving inclusion for trans individuals in sports and exercise settings. For example, test the impact of gender-neutral facilities or training coaches and staff on trans experiences.

4. Compare perspectives of trans individuals in urban versus rural areas of Portugal to understand how geographic location impacts barriers and facilitators to sports participation. The current study suggested location matters but did not directly compare regions.

5. Conduct longitudinal research that follows trans individuals over time as they progress through gender affirmation to understand how their relationship with sports and exercise evolves across the transition process. The current study only examined one point in time.
