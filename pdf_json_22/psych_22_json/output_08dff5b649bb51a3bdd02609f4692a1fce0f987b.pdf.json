            "text": "Adolescence is a significant time of growth during which mental health issues can emerge (Polanczyk et al., 2015). The physiological and psychological changes that occur during puberty can trigger major public health problems, such as suicidal behaviors (suicidal ideation or suicide attempts; Xiao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022), depression, and aggression (Achenbach, 1991; Achenbach and Edelbrock, 1991; Reitz et al., 2005; Graber, 2013; Archana and Kumar, 2022). Worldwide, suicide is a serious public health problem and a leading cause of death and disability, especially among adolescents (McLoughlin et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). Suicidal ideation, a key step in the suicide process, is a significant risk factor for youth suicide (Cluver et al., 2015; Franklin et al., 2017). Suicidal ideation is prevalent among Chinese adolescents, with rates ranging between 15.7% (N = 54,640) and 18.2% (N = 20, 475) (Guo et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022). Additionally, depression is significant global public health issue (Ferrari et al., 2013), with incidence rates ranging from 2 to 7% in children and adolescents (Alsaad et al., 2018). Depression, which has been associated with decreased academic performance, family problems, drug abuse, and decreased life expectancy (Murray et al., 2015), is frequently accompanied by a high suicide risk (Murray et al., 2015; Apter and Gvion, 2016). Aggression is defined as behavior intended to hurt oneself or others (Siever, 2008), and is another public health issue, with a frequency of 25% in China (Peng et al., 2022). Several studies have noted that adolescents with more aggressive behavioral tendencies and patterns are more likely to have poorer physical and mental health, scholastic performance, personality development, and social adaption than others (Gini and Pozzoli, 2013; Gini et al., 2013).\nDue to the prevalence of aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation in adolescents, research on maladaptive psychological outcomes in the teenage population has frequently concentrated on identifying their causes (Dumais et al., 2005; Augsberger et al., 2018; Lee and Ham, 2018). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that positive parenting can contribute to the prevention of these problems in Western cultural contexts (Boeldt et al., 2012; Smokowski et al., 2015). Despite the extensive reports from Western countries that positive parenting is associated with improved child and adolescent psychosocial and developmental outcomes, the majority of these studies have tested bivariate relationships rather than mediational models, and have not used longitudinal data. According to Social Emotional Learning (SEL) theory (Tolan et al., 2016), positive parenting can enhance children\u2019s social and emotional skills, and indirectly foster the development of socialemotional competencies, such as mindfulness, in adolescents. Thus, with a focus on prevention, we used longitudinal methods to investigate the mediating effect of adolescents\u2019 mindfulness\nin the associations between positive parenting, depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation.\nWhile the relationships between positive parenting and depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation have been welldocumented in Western countries (Chen and Raine, 2018; Kingsbury et al., 2020), relatively little research has been conducted on this topic in a Chinese environment. A Chinese adage states that \u201cBeating and reprimanding are the signs of love.\u201d This demonstrates that, in the context of traditional Chinese culture, controlling or autonomy-restrictive parental practices (e.g., harsh parenting behaviors) are more normative in China (Liu et al., 2021) than in Western contexts. Indeed, these practices are still adopted by approximately 50% of Chinese parents (Wang and Liu, 2014) and thus seem normal and appropriate in the eyes of Chinese adolescents (Chao, 1994; Cheung and Pomerantz, 2011). Shek (2007) found that although Chinese parents are accustomed to scolding their children, screaming at them, and even punishing them for failing to achieve their expectations, Chinese adolescents do not necessary perceive these parenting practices as harsh. It is still unknown whether the positive parenting in the context of Chinese culture will have the same effect as that in Western countries. Given these cultural understandings, it is worth investigating further the relationship between positive parenting and maladaptive psychological outcomes in a Chinese context.\nThe importance of positive parenting in preventing aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation\nMany studies have shown that parental practices are crucial contributors to the emergence and maintenance of adolescents\u2019 mental and behavioral problems, including depression (Schwartz et al., 2014), aggression (Hentges et al., 2018), and suicide (Borkowski et al., 2001; Maccoby, 2001; Fotti et al., 2006). According to the family system theory, families are not just groups of people living together, but rather multilevel systems in which the parents play essential roles as both leaders and implementers (Bowen, 1974). Therefore, everyone, especially adolescents, is affected by any change in any element of the system. Following this, then, positive parenting behaviors have been hypothesized to decrease youth depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation (You and Lim, 2015; Kingsbury et al., 2020).\nPositive parenting refers to warm, supportive parental behaviors that demonstrate acceptance, praise, and responsibility, including but not limited to nurturing, instructing, listening, expressing approbation, and providing emotional support (Russell, 1996; Chronis et al., 2007; Boeldt et al., 2012; Kingsbury et al., 2020). In addition, any positive component that stems from specific parenting behaviors and beliefs and enters into the parenting environment can be\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nconsidered a part of positive parenting (Roskam, 2015). There is considerable evidence that positive parenting is a key buffer against the emergence of depression, aggression (Pinquart, 2017a,b; Nieto-Casado et al., 2022), and suicidal ideation (Kingsbury et al., 2020). Smokowski et al. (2015) found that positive parenting was negatively associated with depression. In another study, Jakobsen et al. (2012) revealed that adolescents who reported parental support had less severe anxiety and depressive symptoms. A significant association between positive parenting and aggressive behavior has also been reported (Chen and Raine, 2018). In particular, aggressive behavior was more common in children who had been exposed to negative parenting styles than in children who had been exposed to positive parenting styles (Lei et al., 2018). More importantly, a substantive body of empirical research has asserted that a supportive family environment could defend against the stresses that lead to suicidal ideation and actions in young people (Zhang and Jin, 1996; Lai and McBride-Chang, 2001). Indeed, family support and connectedness has been shown to reduce the likelihood of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Sharaf et al., 2009; Purcell et al., 2012).\nAccording to several cross-sectional studies, the presence of parental warmth (Machell et al., 2016), sufficient autonomy support (Shpigel et al., 2012), and efficient communication (Mark et al., 2013) are protective factors against the formation of suicidal thoughts in adolescents. In a more recent longitudinal study, Kingsbury et al. (2020) found that positive parenting was protective against depression, anxiety, and physical and social aggression. Taken together, the evidence points to a strong negative correlation between positive parenting and maladaptive psychological outcomes such as depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation (Purcell et al., 2012; Smokowski et al., 2015; Pinquart, 2017a,b; Chen and Raine, 2018; Nair et al., 2020)."

            "text": "The SEL theory is a model of positive development (Tolan et al., 2016) that describes the process of helping people acquire the \u201ccapacity to understand, control, and express one\u2019s social and emotional aspects of one\u2019s life\u201d (Elias et al., 1997). The SEL model (Tolan et al., 2016) holds that positive parenting can cultivate social and emotional abilities that directly or indirectly contribute to competency development in adolescents by improving the environments that support the development of these abilities in adolescents. Indeed, some studies have shown that positive parenting plays a significant part in the healthy development of adolescents because it supports the acquisition of skills, promotes self-acceptance, boosts self-esteem, and facilitates the formation of secure attachments (Smalls, 2009; Elmore and Gaylord-Harden, 2013). Other studies have shown that children who have secure, stable relationships with their\ncaregivers are also more likely to acquire a greater capacity for mindfulness (Shaver et al., 2007; Pepping et al., 2015; LucasThompson et al., 2021; Nieto-Casado et al., 2022). Parent\u2013child interactions that are marked by warmth, support, and sensitivity are more inclined to foster a secure attachment pattern in the child (Bowlby, 1973). Moreover, those with more secure attachment patterns also tend to be more mindful (Shaver et al., 2007; Sharaf et al., 2009; Pepping et al., 2015; Melen et al., 2017). According to Ryan et al. (2007), this sense of security can help to create the foundation for the maturity of awareness as well as contextual attention. Conversely, difficulties developing mindfulness have been associated with the emergence of an insecure attachment style, which is facilitated by unresponsive or inconsistent relationships between parents and their children (Bowlby, 1973; Pepping et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2017).\nThe association between parenting style and children\u2019s behavioral adjustment level has been shown to be mediated by children\u2019s behavioral and attentional regulation abilities (Cheah et al., 2009). As such, there is value in exploring mindfulness as a potential competence of adolescents, since it appears that having a loving, autonomous, and communicative family environment during childhood facilitates the development of mindfulness (Ryan et al., 2007), and this development persists into adolescence (Galla et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that adolescents who experience more positive parenting possess stronger skills in mindfulness.\nMindfulness is described as a state of consciousness that is developed through paying attention to the present moment with a non-judgmental attitude (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). A substantial corpus of literature supports the notion that mindfulness promotes health by shielding individuals against the adverse impacts of stress (Creswell and Lindsay, 2014), as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Bentley et al., 2017; Per et al., 2022). There is growing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are sufficiently effective in enhancing positive emotions and reducing depression, suicidal ideation (Serpa et al., 2014), and aggression (Fix and Fix, 2013). For instance, Zhu et al. (2021) discovered that increasing mindfulness training was associated with low level of depression. Recently, a meta-analysis indicated that MBIs moderately reduced suicidal ideation (Schmelefske et al., 2020) and other psychological outcomes linked to suicide (e.g., depression; Witt et al., 2019). MBIs may also be effective in reducing aggression (Peters et al., 2015; Gillions et al., 2019). For instance, Heppner et al. (2008) found a negative correlation between mindfulness and self-reported aggressiveness, whereby increasing people\u2019s mindfulness in an experimental setting resulted in less aggressive behavior. Similar to positive parenting, mindfulness has been shown to prospectively and robustly predict anxiety, depression, aggression, and social impairment (Williams, 2008; Fix and Fix, 2013; Bajaj et al., 2016; Westphal et al., 2021). Considering previous findings, it is plausible that mindfulness could mediate the link between positive parenting and maladaptive\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\npsychological outcomes such as aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation.\nAlthough few studies have directly demonstrated the association between positive parenting and mindfulness, a recent study by Nieto-Casado et al. (2022) found that mindfulness partially mediated the association between parental competency and anxious-depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. The authors speculated that this mediation effect was due to the fact that mindfulness inhibits the activation of dysfunctional thought patterns and maladaptive coping methods, which are common in individuals with anxious-depressive symptomatology. Based on the SEL model, positive parenting (i.e., the environment) may help individuals to develop skills in mindfulness (i.e., individual competence), which in turn reduce the likelihood of experiencing depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation. If so, it is reasonable to speculate that positive parenting could improve or cultivate mindfulness in adolescents, and, in turn, mindfulness could influence maladaptive psychological outcomes. Individual mindfulness could be promoted through the family environment, and thus decrease maladaptive psychological outcomes. However, considering the Western\u2013 Eastern cultural differences in parenting practices, further research into the associations between positive parenting and aggression, depression, and suicidal ideation in China is required. In addition, most studies into parenting style and adolescent maladaptive psychological outcomes have been cross-sectional, which cannot accurately reveal quasicausal relationships between variables. The current study used a three-wave longitudinal method to explore the associations of positive parenting and mindfulness with\nmaladaptive psychological outcomes in a sample of middle school adolescents.\nWe used a mediation model (Figure 1) to examine the intermediary effect of mindfulness on positive parenting and adolescent maladaptive psychological outcomes. Previous studies have found that socio-demographic factors (e.g., sex, age, household income, and education) are associated with suicidal ideation (Groleger et al., 2003; Grunbaum et al., 2004; Swahn and Bossarte, 2007; Kim et al., 2016; Cabello et al., 2020), depression (Mohammadi et al., 2019), and aggression (Stipek and Miles, 2008). To reduce endogeneity bias, we adjusted for the demographic variables of age, sex, and subjective social status. Based on the existing literature, the following hypotheses were made:\nHypothesis 1: Positive parenting positively predicts mindfulness. Hypothesis 2: Positive parenting and mindfulness negatively predict adolescent suicidal ideation, depression, and aggression. Hypothesis 3: The associations between positive parenting and suicidal ideation, depression, and aggression in adolescents are mediated by mindfulness."

            "text": "While numerous studies have identified negative associations between positive parenting and depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation in adolescents, we know relatively little about the role of mindfulness as a mechanism underlying these relationships, particularly in a Chinese context. Furthermore, previous studies have generally been cross-sectional, which makes it difficult to make causal inference. The current study fills this gap in the literature by investigating whether mindfulness mediates the relationships between positive parenting and depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation. This is also the first study to take a longitudinal perspective in exploring this in a Chinese context. Several important and novel findings were revealed. First, positive parenting was positively associated with mindfulness longitudinally. Second, positive parenting and mindfulness were both negatively correlated with depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation. Moreover, mindfulness measured at T2 partially mediated the relationship between positive parenting at T1 and depression and suicidal ideation at T3, and fully mediated the relationship between positive parenting at T1 and aggression at T3.\nPositive parenting positively predicts mindfulness\nAs the highlight of our study, positive parenting was positively correlated with mindfulness, as predicted in Hypothesis 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to show that positive parenting is correlated with mindfulness using a longitudinal study design. This finding is consistent with another study, which revealed that parental competency was positively associated with adolescent mindfulness (Nieto-Casado et al., 2022). Another study has suggested that the origins of mindful attention and awareness lie in relationships between caregivers and their children (Ryan et al., 2007). According to the family system theory (Bowen, 1974), positive parenting is a family environment resource that can support adolescents\u2019 development of personal competences and help children to establish healthy attachment bonds with their caregivers. The family system theory highlights the significance of the family system for the development of mindfulness, and suggests that mindfulness may be influenced, at least in part, by family relationships and experiences (Bowen, 1974). For example, dispositional mindfulness was lowest among adolescents who reported frequent/intense\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 1 Descriptive statistics and correlations between variables.\nM SD 1 2 3 4 5\n1.

In line with this, the experience of positive, supportive warmth from caregivers has been reported to create a sense of security that helps adolescents develop an attentiveness to their own experiences\n(Parker et al., 2015), which assists the development of a set of cognitive-emotional patterns that promote open, receptive, non-judgmental awareness and attentiveness to whatever circumstances may present themselves (Caldwell and Shaver, 2015). Recently, Lan (2022) reported that parental warmth\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nis more likely to promote positive parent\u2013child connections characterized by affectionate and cooperative interactions. Additionally, children who grow up in warm and supportive families are more likely to internalize their parents\u2019 values, which in turn enhances their capacity to self-regulate (Carlo et al., 2011; Ngai et al., 2018). Moreover, positive parenting, which entails a balanced approach to offering warmth, respect, autonomy, communication, and support without disregarding acceptable degrees of control and regulation, has been found to increase children\u2019s level of adjustment competence (Schofield et al., 2014). In other words, positive parenting facilitates the development of positive relationships with adolescents, which in turn helps to cultivate mindfulness abilities.\nPositive parenting and mindfulness negatively predict adolescent suicidal ideation and depression\nThe correlation results showed that positive parenting and mindfulness were both longitudinally negatively associated with depression and suicidal ideation, while only mindfulness was negatively associated with aggression longitudinally, which supports Hypothesis 2, as well as the results of earlier studies (Bamaca-Colbert et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2021). Some studies have found that positive parenting is linked to a reduced risk of depression (Feng et al., 2009; Clayborne et al., 2021), suicidal ideation, and behavior (Lai and McBride-Chang, 2001), and aggressive behavior (Chen and Raine, 2018) in adolescents. A negative relationship between mindfulness and depression has also been reported in several studies (Christopher and Gilbert, 2010; Bajaj et al., 2016; Kircaburun et al., 2019; Al Harbi et al., 2021; Sharma and Kumra, 2022). Furthermore, a growing body of research has shown that MBIs can effectively reduce depression and aggression (Kriakous et al., 2021; Rezakhani and Vakili, 2021) in both clinical and non-clinical populations (Williams et al., 2000; Williams, 2008).\nNonetheless, our results do not fully support Hypothesis 2, in that we found no direct effect of positive parenting on adolescent aggression. However, this does not refute the notion that positive parenting affects the development of aggression. It is worth noting that previous studies on the relationship between positive parenting and aggression have produced mixed results, including non-significant results in cross-cultural studies. For example, in a juvenile sample of 11\u2013 12 year olds (51% boys, 80% African Americans), Chen and Raine (2018) found a negative relationship between positive parenting and aggression among those who matured early, but not among those who matured on time/late. However, another study presented different results, whereby positive parenting was unrelated to aggression in early maturing girls (mean age = 11.25 years; Mrug et al., 2008). Moreover, Yaman et al. (2010) found no main effect of positive parenting on the\nprediction of toddler aggression. As suggested by meta-analysis findings from Rothbaum and Weisz (1994), the relationship between parenting quality and child aggression may be weaker in toddlers and preschoolers than in older children. In addition, a separate meta-analysis found that the association between positive parenting and reduced aggression was strongest among college students, moderate among seniors, and minimal among middle and elementary school students in China (Lei et al., 2018). The reasons for these contradictory findings could lie in the use of different instruments for measuring outcomes, or in the demographic makeup of the study population (Lei et al., 2018).\nThere are various explanations for the present result of no direct effect of positive parenting on adolescent aggression. As opposed to depression and suicidal ideation, the aggression we measured, which includes physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility, was related to interpersonal interactions. First, the effect size of correlations between positive parenting and aggression was small (r =\u22120.16, p < 0.01). Given that mindfulness mediated the relationship between positive parenting and aggression, positive parenting had no direct influence on adolescent aggression. Second, there may be some factors (peer friendships, the environment, etc.) that account for the indirect relationship between positive parenting and aggression. For instance, Hartup and Stevens (1997) posited that the influence that parents exert over children\u2019s behavior decreases as peer relationships and friendships grow more salient and relationships with parents become less important on entering adolescence. Third, individual characteristics (such as emotional regulation or hostile attribution biases) could influence the indirect relationship between positive parenting and aggression (Kawabata et al., 2011). This result may also be explained by the idea that positive parenting promotes sociocognitive traits such as emotion management, self-confidence, and social competence, all of which can help to prevent the emergence and maintenance of aggression (Kawabata et al., 2011). For instance, previous studies have indicated that children who are exposed to positive parenting are provided with a socializing situation that promotes their ability to regulate emotions and social competence, both of which may be linked to a lower incidence of aggressive behavior (Parke et al., 1992; Zhou et al., 2002).\nAdolescent mindfulness mediates the relationship between positive parenting and suicidal ideation, depression, and aggression\nWe found that mindfulness mediated the effect of positive parenting on adolescent depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation, which supports Hypothesis 3. More specifically, the mediation effect was only partial due to the direct effects of\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\npositive parenting on depression and suicidal ideation in the structural model. However, mindfulness completely mediated the association between positive parenting and aggression. Mindfulness can be defined as an awareness of our thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and surrounding environment on a moment-to-moment basis. Being mindful is associated with openness, non-judgment, awareness, friendliness, acceptance, compassion, and kindness (Baer et al., 2019), and can reduce rumination and the frequency of both depressive symptoms (Moreira and Canavarro, 2018) and suicidal outcomes (Hargus et al., 2010; Nieto-Casado et al., 2022). Recent work has demonstrated that mindfulness partially mediates the correlations between parental competence and both anxious-depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in adolescents (Nieto-Casado et al., 2022). The SEL model can be used to explain the role of mindfulness as a mediator in the association between positive parenting and adolescent depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation identified in this study (Tolan et al., 2016). During parent\u2013child interactions, a supportive, encouraging, and warm parent is more likely to model sensitivity and attentiveness to the adolescent, which can create a safe and supportive environment that conveys to the adolescent that they are loved and accepted (World Health Organization [WHO], 2007; Juffer et al., 2012). Adolescents who feel that their parents accept them are more inclined to interact with the world in a more mindful way. Mindfulness can foster a more profound and long-lasting awareness of being engaged with whatever is occurring in the present moment, with a recognition that every moment, whether positive or negative, is temporary and will be promptly replaced by a new experience (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). To put it another way, mindfulness promotes greater acceptance and less reactivity to whatever is taking place on physical, cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels, and also increases flexibility and accuracy in one\u2019s perception about what is taking place in the present moment (Duncan et al., 2009). From this perspective, adolescents who have higher levels of mindfulness are better able to remain open and responsive to their current negative experiences rather than judging, ignoring, or minimizing them, which in turn makes them less prone to suffer depression or suicidal ideation (Kabat-Zinn, 2003; Wallace and Shapiro, 2006; Coffey et al., 2010).\nThe current study also found an indirect association between positive parenting and aggression, which was fully mediated by mindfulness in adolescents. A key aspect of mindfulness is being aware of one\u2019s own impulses and realizing that they are transient, which strengthens an individual\u2019s ability to resist action until the impulse has passed (Katz and Toner, 2013). This means that adolescents with high levels of mindfulness are more likely to have a deeper comprehension of their cognitive and behavioral processes, and are able to learn to respond more intentionally and consciously rather than reactively or automatically (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). In this case,\nflexibility and awareness can help them see other possibilities or options, rather than seeing aggression as the only viable response. Some studies have painted a negative picture of Chinese parenting, characterizing it as overbearing and even hostile (Chao, 1994). However, adolescents living in families with positive parenting may learn to regulate their negative emotions in adaptive ways by observing their parents\u2019 behavior. This can result in more psychosocial adjustment, which may decrease the likelihood of mental health problems.\nThese findings are largely congruent with SEL theory (Tolan et al., 2016), which argues that parents can have longlasting positive impacts on their children. Namely, adolescents cumulatively learn more self-awareness, self-management, and relationship skills from their parents\u2019 positive support, which they are able to put into practice as they gain more freedom to act. We speculated that when children feel that they are cared for, encouraged, supported, and accepted through their parents\u2019 behavioral style, they foster the capacity to accept themselves and their own emotional state. In other words, positive parenting may help to cultivate mindfulness in adolescents, and this mindfulness could mitigate depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation."

The present findings suggest that it is necessary to develop a positive parent\u2013child relationship to foster positive adolescent development. Hence, schools or governments could offer education or training that provides parents with information about positive parenting, as well as the skills they need to parent effectively, which would promote positive development and reduce negative outcomes for youths. The second important point is that our model\u2019s emphasis on the importance of mindfulness suggests that positive parenting practices can cultivate mindfulness, which would result in greater improvement in mental health. Moreover, whether the parenting practice is positive or not, mindfulness interventions could improve the consequences of parenting practice."

First, all of the data came from participants\u2019 subjective reports; future studies should incorporate other forms of evidence (such as reports from teachers and classmates) to bolster the reliability of our results. Future studies could also overcome this limitation by using multi-source data collection methods or experimental method\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\ndesigns to test our theoretical models and determine the causal relationships between variables. Second, participants were Chinese middle school students, so our results are not generalizable to Chinese adults. Third, while this research examined the mediation role of mindfulness in the link between positive parenting and maladaptive psychological outcomes, individual factors, such as adolescent resilience (Kaniu\u0161onyte\u0307 and Laursen, 2022), may also mediate the effects of positive parenting on adolescent mental health. Therefore, future studies should focus on additional protective factors that might also play a mediating role in the link between positive parenting and adolescent mental health. Fourth, despite our use of longitudinal data, the time interval between the measurement waves was only 2 months. This may not be sufficient to detect the wave-to-wave influence of the constructs on one another. Future studies should explore the influence of positive parenting and mindfulness in multiple waves at longer time intervals to clarify how mindfulness mediates the effects of positive parenting and maladaptive psychological outcomes. Fifth, a longitudinal design enabled us to test mediation effects in a more rigorous manner than for cross-sectional designs. However, each variable was measured only once, and so our results could lack stability (Cole and Maxwell, 2003). Future studies should collect all variables at all waves and use a three-wave crosslagged analysis to verify the model proposed in this study. Intervention studies investigating whether mindfulness changes aggression/depression/suicidal ideation in adolescents would also clarify the issue of directionality. In future research, we will use intervention or experimental methods to directly explore the relationship between independent variables (mindfulness) and dependent variables (depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation)."
