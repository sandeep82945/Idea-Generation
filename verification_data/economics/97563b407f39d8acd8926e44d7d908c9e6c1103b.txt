"Our findings also have implications for social equality. Specifically, we found significant differences in the associations between the STEM polygenic score and socioeconomic outcomes across gender and ethnic subgroups. These findings suggest that policies tailored to different subgroupsâ€™ cultural and ethnic backgrounds may be needed to fully realize the potential of STEM education and STEM jobs and promote social equality. For example, interventions that target gender stereotyping in education and the workplace may help to reduce the gender gap in the associations between STEM polygenic scores and socioeconomic outcomes. Similarly, interventions that promote entrepreneurship and innovation in ethnic subgroups where these factors are lacking may help to enhance the effect of STEM polygenic scores on income and promote social equality."

"We also hope our study can attract more GWAS or related studies on the nexus of genetic disposition, educational attainment, and labor market performance."
