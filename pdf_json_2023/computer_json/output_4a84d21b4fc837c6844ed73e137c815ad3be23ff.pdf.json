Nolan, Jr. A sociologist who focuses on the role of technology in modern society, Professor Nolan is the grandson of James Findley Nolan, M.D., a physician who was involved in the seminal events of the early nuclear age. Through the lens of his grandfather\u2019s life, James L. Nolan explores the dynamics of \u201cthe overarching, penetrating, and ubiquitous quality of technique in modern society.\u201d It is an ambitious agenda and one he accomplishes with nuanced sensitivity.\nJames Findley Nolan, M.D. (1915\u20131983) was a 28-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist when he was recruited for the Manhattan Project and appointed postsurgeon at Los Alamos. In addition to medical care for the Los Alamos community, Dr. Nolan and his colleagues were responsible for developing standards to protect against radiation exposure in the laboratory and during the Trinity Test in July 1945. Dr. Nolan accompanied the Hiroshima bomb from Los Alamos to Tinian Island, was among the\nReviewed by Rachelle Linner Medford, MA 02155 USA\n17March 2023\ncolloquia. The military, on the other hand, wanted a bomb for combat purposes. It emphasized secrecy, security, and a strict hierarchy of authority. Instead of the open sharing of ideas, it wanted an operational structure with clearly defined compartmentalization of tasks.\u201d And then there were the medical doctors, \u201cmarginally part of both communities but not fully members of either.\u201d\nGeneral Leslie Groves, who directed the Manhattan Project, was particularly contemptuous of the doctors and dismissive of the concerns they raised about radiation exposure. Dr. Nolan traveled to Oak Ridge, TN, USA, to give Groves the monitoring and evacuation plans for the Trinity Test. After keeping Nolan waiting for hours, Groves taunted, \u201cWhat are you, some kind of Hearst propagandist?\u201d The General\u2019s \u201csingle-minded preoccupation with security and secrecy\u201d meant that he did not want to approve anything that would alert people to the military operation being conducted at the test site, including the need to evacuate people from areas that received high radioactive fallout.\nThe first test of an atomic bomb, named the Trinity Test by Robert Oppenheimer, took place on 16 July 1945, at the Alamogordo Bombing Range, 210 miles south of Los Alamos. The biggest uncertainty about the test was how meteorologic conditions would affect the size of the area of radioactive fallout.\nThe military saw radiation exposure as a public relations problem, not a medical one. The physicians were continually frustrated by their inability to convince the military about the dangers of radiation but \u201cthere is considerable evidence to suggest that the doctors were ever mindful of potential legal consequences and careful to take precautions to protect themselves and the military from future litigation.\u201d Time after time \u201ca scientific mindset superseded a medical one,\u201d perhaps most egregiously in human experiments on 18 patients secretly injected with plutonium. A 1949 proposal to do \u201ctotal-body irradiation tests on prisoners with life sentences\u201d was rejected because \u201cIt is not very long since we got through trying Germans for doing exactly that.\u201d\nGroves consistently minimized the impact of initial and residual radiation at Hiroshima and Nagasaki because he \u201cfeared having to give an account for what could justifiably be seen as an inhumane and (illegal) form of combat,\u201d akin to biological or chemical warfare. This is one reason why Americans did not offer medical care to hibakusha, the\nsurvivors of the bomb. To do so \u201cwould be acknowledging moral responsibility for the plight of the hibakusha in both cities. \u2026this was not something Americans were willing to admit.\u201d Atomic Doctors painfully delineates the actions that flowed from that allegiance: the shameful treatment of downwinders exposed to radiation during the Trinity Test, the destruction of the lives of Marshall Islanders, the callous disregard for the health of enlisted personnel, and the secrecy necessitated by lies about the long term effects of radiation.\nIn the midst of this depressing narrative of moral compromise is the edifying story of the Polish-born British physicist Joseph Rotblat. Like other scientists who were refugees from Europe, Rotblat was motivated to work on the Manhattan Project because he feared that Germany was going to develop atomic weapons. But after Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, only Rotblat walked away. Why did no one else choose to leave? \u201cThis was a question he explored with his colleagues both before and after the war. \u2018The most frequent reason\u2019 offered to Rotblat by his Los Alamos colleagues was that of \u2018pure and simple scientific curiosity\u2014the strong urge to find out whether the theoretical calculations and predictions would come true.\u2019 Operating within the investigative mentality of the scientific paradigm, the physicists were thinking not so much about the wartime use of a weapon as they were about the final outcome of their intensive research, experimentation, and theoretical predictions.\u201d Or, as Robert Oppenheimer observed, \u201cthe decision to use the bomb \u2018was implicit in the project.\u2019\u201d\nWhen asked about his work at Los Alamos, Dr. Nolan always replied, \u201cI delivered the babies.\u201d He hewed to the official justification for the use of the bomb that it ended the war and saved American lives. But his grandson suggests that he was deeply troubled by his participation in these historic events. \u201cWhile in later years he occasionally gave interviews and lectures about his wartime experiences, he was notably reluctant to discuss his various roles. Even close family members recall hearing very little about his unique journey, and concerning some aspects of experience\u2014such as what he saw in Japan\u2014virtually nothing at all. One can only imagine the anguish and psychological toll he endured from keeping hidden and unspoken such life-changing experiences for so long.\u201d It is impossible to ignore the moral injury this good physician sustained after years of\n18\nIEEE Technology and Society Magazine\nsecrecy, compartmentalization of roles as scientist and healer, and acceptance of narratives that the ends justify the means.\nThe story of the nuclear age is a narrative about how society develops and adapts to new technologies. In an excellent chapter on the \u201cquandary of technique\u201d Nolan draws on the work of Albert Borgmann and Jacques Ellul to discuss \u201ctechnology as a cultural force.\u201d Dr. Nolan illustrates what Borgmann calls an \u201cinstrumentalist view of technology\u201d\u2014technology \u201cis neither good or bad\u2026. It depends on us and our values whether it is used well or ill.\u201d Dr. Nolan\u2019s postwar career as a physician and cancer researcher was devoted to using nuclear technology to benefit his patients with gynecologic cancers. He was an \u201coptimistic determinist,\u201d who viewed \u201cthe development and application of new technologies as inevitable and as a net good for society.\u201d Yet, his career also illustrates Ellul\u2019s cogent analysis of the \u201cinseparability of technology\u2019s beneficial and destructive features\u201d and how \u201ctechnology, once set in motion, becomes self-augmenting and difficult to resist.\u201d\nIn Atomic Doctors, Nolan uses the Manhattan Project as a model to think about the implications of newer technologies\u2014the internet, social media, surveillance technologies, biotechnology, genetically modified organisms, and human genetic manipulation. As Ellul nodes, \u201crecognizing the deterministic quality of technique is the first step toward realizing human freedom. Modern humans cannot act with freedom unless they first recognize and appreciate the extent to which they live in a technological milieu.\u201d\nIn 1983, more than one hundred alumni (including James F. Nolan) gathered at Los Alamos for a 40th-anniversary reunion. Some of the distinguished physicists expressed regret for what they had done.\nVictor \u201cWeisskopf lamented, \u2018Forty years ago we meant so well. At that time we did not foresee the consequences of our work.\u2019 Given all that had happened since 1943, Weisskopf acknowledged the \u2018special duty\u2019 of the scientists to come to terms with the fact that their invention had resulted in \u2018the unintended cause of the world\u2019s tragic predicament.\u2019\u201d\nInterestIngly, a sImIlar language of regret is offered by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet, who \u201cremorsefully reflected\u201d on the unintended consequences of his work. One cannot make exact parallels between nuclear weapons and the Internet, but Nolan\u2019s persuasive and eloquent argument about the necessity of paying attention to the underlying ethos of technology allows for a path forward. Until now, our moral intelligence has been too undeveloped to resist the technological mindset. We need to find a way to support the men and women of integrity who, like Joseph Rotblat, know that the ends never justify the means. Atomic Doctors is a sober study of what happens when we pretend otherwise. \nRachelle Linner is a retired librarian and a freelance writer.
