    "abstractText": "Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome respiratory sickness in weaned and growing pigs, as well as sow reproductive failure, and its infection is regarded as one of the most serious swine illnesses worldwide. Given the current lack of an effective treatment, in this study, we identified natural compounds capable of inhibiting non-structural protein 4 (Nsp4) of the virus, which is involved in their replication and pathogenesis. Results: We screened natural compounds (n = 97,999) obtained from the ZINC database against Nsp4 and selected the top 10 compounds for analysing protein\u2013ligand interactions and physicochemical properties. The five compounds demonstrating strong binding affinity were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) and binding free energy calculations. Based on analysis, we identified four possible lead compounds that represent potentially effective drug-like inhibitors. Conclusions: These methods identified that these natural compounds are capable of inhibiting Nsp4 and possibly effective as antiviral therapeutics against PRRSV.",

The five compounds demonstrating strong binding affinity were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) and binding free energy calculations. Based on analysis, we identified four possible lead compounds that represent potentially effective drug-like inhibitors.\nConclusions: These methods identified that these natural compounds are capable of inhibiting Nsp4 and possibly effective as antiviral therapeutics against PRRSV.\nKeywords: PRRSV, Swine, Nsp4, Molecular dynamics, Protein\u2013ligand interaction"

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is an economically important disease in swine and accountable for significant losses to the pork industry worldwide [1]. PRRSV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Arterivirus [1\u20134] that causes respiratory disease and is responsible for severe reproductive failure in pigs [4]. Generally, the disease is further complicated by secondary infection and results in a high mortality rate [1]. The available treatments, including vaccines, poorly control the disease, owing to the high genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of the virus [5]. Antivirals might be useful in controlling and managing PRRSV, and recent studies have reported the ability of herbal extracts to inhibit PRRSV infection [6\u20138]. Many compounds derived from natural sources such as plants have shown inhibitory activity against viruses and a wide variety of pathogens [9, 10]. Several natural compounds have demonstrated antiviral activity (for instance, immense potential for inhibiting viral replication) and drug-like activity [10]. The identification of potent inhibitors of PRRSV from natural sources is challenging, as it requires compound extraction and evaluation of antiviral activity, both of which require funds and specific experimental equipment. Given the difficulty in screening large numbers of natural compounds, chemo-informatics approaches are useful for identifying\n\u00a9 The Author(s). 2022 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b comprise ~ 80% of the PRRSV genome and respectively encode pp1a and pp1b polyproteins that are cleaved by viral proteases into non-structural proteins [13]. Papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and a 3C-like serine protease [3CLSP; nonstructural protein 4 (Nsp4)] are the viral proteases involved in polyprotein cleavage and required for Arterivirus replication. Additionally, the reported involvement of Nsp4 in interferon inhibition is linked with PRRSV pathogenesis, suggesting it as a promising molecular target for novel therapeutics [14\u201316]. The goal of this study was to identify natural compounds capable of serving as novel inhibitors of PRRSV replication via their targeting of Nsp4. Specifically, we aimed to identify natural compounds through structurebased virtual screening, analyse their physicochemical properties, perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and determine the binding affinities of the potential inhibitors using molecular mechanics Poisson\u2013Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods."

These files were then used for interaction studies with target protein through structurebased virtual screening and molecular docking using AutoDock vina [18\u201320].\nRetrieval and preparation of the target protein structure The crystal structure of PRRSV Nsp4 (PDB ID: 5Y4L) was retrieved from RCSB-PDB and visualised and analysed using UCSF Chimera-1.15 software [21, 22]. An AutoDock tool was used for the addition of partial atomic charges (Kollman charge), hydrogen atoms, generation of gridbox, and preparation of the Nsp4 structure. The grid box was generated with centre (X =\u2212 4.034, Y = 6.285, Z = 17.57) and size (X = 46, Y = 44, Z = 42) coordinates that were defined in a configuration file (exhaustiveness and energy ranges: 8 and 4, respectively).

Here, we used AutoDock vina to screen the retrieved natural compounds against PRRSV Nsp4 and generated protein\u2013ligand complexes of the top 10 screened compounds using PyMol (https://pymol.org/2/). Two-dimensional (2D) models of the complexes were visualised using Discovery Studio Visualizer (https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studiovisualizer-download) to determine the amino acid residues involved in the interactions [25]."

To eliminate steric hindrance, the steepest energy minimization was used for all systems in order to obtain the maximal force below 1000 kJ/mol/nm. Long-range electrostatic interactions were determined using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [30]. For computation of Lennard\u2013Jones and Coulomb interactions, we used a radius cut-off of 1.0 nm; the LINCS algorithm was used to constrain H-bond lengths [31]. All simulations applied a consistent time step of 2 fs. Short-range nonbonded interactions were predicted using a 10-\u00c5 cut-off distance, whereas long-range electrostatics were predicted using the PME method with 1.6-\u00c5 Fourier grid spacing. Shake algorithms were used to fix all bonds, including H-bonds [32]. After energy minimisation, the\nsystems were equilibrated, followed by position-restraint simulations under NVT and NPT conditions to maintain the volume, temperature, and pressure. Finally, all systems were subjected to a 100 ns MD simulation; coordinates were saved at 2 fs intervals. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), Hbonds, and Gibbs free energy landscapes were calculated, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to predict correlated motions generated during protein\u2013 ligand interactions;\u2018gmx rms\u2019, \u2018gmx rmsf\u2019, \u2018gmx gyrate\u2019, \u2018gmx sasa\u2019, \u2018gmx hbond\u2019, \u2018gmx sham\u2019, and \u2018gmx covar\u2019 (GROMACSv.2018.1; http://www.gromacs.org/), respectively, were used for these purposes.

The ligands are subsequently sorted according to their binding free energy for the target. This requires the three-dimensional structure of the target, with the compounds obtained from a database and categorised according to their affinity. In the present study, we downloaded a subset of natural compounds (n = 97,999) from the ZINC database for virtual screening against PRRSV Nsp4. We subsequently identified the top 10 compounds sorted according to their minimum binding free energy (range:\u2212 10.0 to \u2212 9.2 kcal/mol) for further analyses (Table 1).\nAnalysis and visualisation of the screened compounds The active site residues of Nsp4 include His39, Asp64, and Ser118, as well as His133 and Ser136 that are reportedly essential for protein activity. The compound showing the optimal binding free energy (\u2212 10.0 kcal/mol; ZINC38167083) demonstrated ligand interactions such as His39-mediated van der Waals interactions and Asp64mediated Pi-anion interaction.

It was\nidentified as the most frequent virus linked to PRDC [35\u201339]. Furthermore, PRRSV has been shown to impair the host immune system, which can lead to more serious secondary infections, and chronic disorders [35]. The involvement of Nsp4 in PRRSV replication and pathogenesis is decoded and recommended as one of the key molecular targets for drug development [14]. Therefore, identification of Nsp4 inhibitors is needed to prevent and manage the disease. Natural compounds have made immense contributions in the identification of lead molecule(s) with antiviral potential. It is believed that the disease can be controlled successfully by developing small molecules that can inhibit Nsp4 activity linked with pathogenesis [14]. In the present study, computational approaches are utilized for the identification of possible lead compounds via molecular docking of natural compounds database through structure-based virtual screening followed by downstream analysis. Structure based-virtual screening is a powerful computational approach that is used to investigate important lead molecule(s) from a big set of a compound database based on the lowest binding energy required for stabilizing the protein-ligand complex [40]. From the structure-based virtual screening, we have selected the top ten natural compounds that show interaction with key residues. Further, protein-ligand analysis of the top 5 compounds demonstrated that the ZINC38167083 interacted with Nsp4 and formed one conventional hydrogen bond at position Gly63. Besides, amino acid residues Ser18, His39, Leu41, Thr42, Gly43, Asn44, Thr134, and Thr145 were involved in van der Waals interactions, and Val61 and Ile143 formed alkyl bonds. Ala38 and Phe151 participated in interaction through amide-pi and pi-pi t-shaped bonding. Additionally, Asp64 contributed to interaction through the pianion bond. ZINC16919178 bonded with Nsp4 at position Asn11 by one conventional hydrogen bond. In addition, amino acid residues Phe3, Thr5, Ser9, Leu10, Phe26, Ile123, and Gly127 formed van der Waals interactions; Pro78, Tyr92, Leu94, Val99, and Pro101 formed alkyl and pi-alkyl bonds. ZINC08792350 interacted with Nsp4 Thr5, Ser9, Asn11, Val76, Pro78, Ile123, Phe166, and Asp192 through van der Waals interactions; Phe3 and Tyr92 formed pi-pi t-shaped bonding. In addition, the amino acid residues Leu10, Pro101, Leu196 contributed to interaction through pi-alkyl bonding; Arg90 and Val99 formed pi-anion and pi-sigma bonds with ZINC08792350, respectively. ZINC01510656 bonded with Nsp4 at Thr5, Asn11, Val76, Phe26, Leu94, and Gly127 through van der Waals interactions; amino acid residues Leu10, Pro78, and IIe123 formed pi-alkyl bonds, and Ser9, Tyr92, Val99 contributed in interaction by carbon-hydrogen bonding, pi-pi t-shaped, and pi-sigma interactions, respectively. ZINC08877407 formed conventional hydrogen bonds with Nsp4 at position His39, Ser118, ASP117, and Ser136; amino acid residues Gly63, Asp64, Ala114, Cys115, Gly116, Thr134, Lys138, and Thr145 contributed to protein-ligand interaction through van der Waals. Additionally, Gly135 formed a carbon-hydrogen bond, and His133, Ile143, and Phe151 interacted through pi-anion, pi-alkyl, and pi-sigma bonding, respectively. Medicinal chemists have traditionally been interested in noncovalent interactions that are indicative of attraction, directed intermolecular forces in\ntheir search for the \u201cglue\u201d that keeps ligand and their molecular target together. In recent years, with the rapid increase in the number of solved biomolecular structures and the performance enhancement of computational methods, it is now possible to provide a more thorough understanding of protein-ligand interaction [41]. Therefore, based on the results, it was concluded that the screened compounds can inhibit the virulence activity of Nsp4 [14]. Besides, the results of physicochemical properties prediction suggest that the screened compounds demonstrated good drug-like behavior and could be considered for further analysis [42, 43]. Therefore, 100 ns MD simulation analysis was conducted for Nsp4 and top 5 natural compounds i.e. ZINC38167083, ZINC16919178, ZINC08792350, ZINC01510656, and ZINC08877407, respectively with Nsp4 to evaluate the dynamic behavior of protein and protein-ligand complexes. It is recognized as a powerful approach for predicting the conformational stability of macromolecules before and after ligand binding, besides the simulated data can be utilized for calculation of real binding energy of small molecules concerning time along with a contribution of binding amino acid residues present in the macromolecular target [44]. Several structural parameters were calculated, including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, H-bonding, PCA, and gibbs free energy [45\u201348]. The RMSD value indicated that all of the complexes were stable and creating an equilibrated trajectory for further investigation. As a result, we determined RMSF, Rg, SASA, PCA, and Gibbs free energy to determine the nature of each system subjected for MD simulation. Drug selectivity, metabolization, and stability all require Hbonds. To better understand the H-bond and its contributions to the overall stability of each system, an Hbond analysis of natural compounds-Nsp4 complexes were calculated. The hydrogen bonding study indicates that all of the Nsp4-complexes are stable and made bonding with essential catalytic residues [49]. The overall analysis revealed that each complex was stabilizing after 70 ns indicating better interaction with Nsp4 in terms of stability that is required for its inhibition. Further, MM-PBSA binding free energy and residual binding energy were calculated to assess the binding affinities of natural compounds with Nsp4. For determining the binding free energy of protein\u2013ligand complexes by using MD simulation trajectory, it is a frequently used and well-accepted method [33, 50]. The strength of the binding contacts between the ligand and the target protein is measured by ligand binding affinity, which is directly linked to ligand potency. In the field of drug discovery, its evaluation is crucial. Furthermore, in favorable reactions, the free energy is negative. So, lowering the binding energy improves interactions, and low binding energy corresponds to the high binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes [51]. MM-PBSA analysis demonstrated that the compounds ZINC38167083, ZINC16919178, ZINC08792350, and ZINC01510656 can act as a potential lead for inhibition of Nsp4 [52, 53]. Whereas, ZINC08877407 was not recommended as a lead because their binding energy was found to be higher as compared to other compounds. In past years, the identification of lead compounds for drug development take much time and cost as well as required good infrastructure experimental facilities [11, 54]. Due to advances in structural biology, computer science, and bioinformatics, it becomes easy to find out putative molecule(s) by a screening of a big database that has a strong affinity with the target for experimental evaluation [24, 55]. It saves the cost and time of the scientific community. Most of the medicines available in the market are from a natural source or it is a derivative of naturally occurring molecules [11, 24]. Natural compounds have immense potential to inhibit virus and pathogenic proteins and act as antiviral drugs [56\u201358]. The results presented in this work are, therefore, informative for understanding the antiviral potential of suggested compounds as therapeutics for PRRSV. It might be also useful for the prevention of pigs and other animals from different viral diseases [59, 60]."
