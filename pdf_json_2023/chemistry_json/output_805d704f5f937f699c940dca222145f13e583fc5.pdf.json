    "abstractText": "The multitarget therapeutic strategy, as opposed to the more traditional \u2018one diseaseone target-one drug\u2019, may hold promise in treating multifactorial neurodegenerative syndromes, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and related dementias. Recently, combining a photopharmacology approach with the multitarget-directed ligand (MTDL) design strategy, we disclosed a novel donepezil-like compound, namely 2-(4-((diethylamino)methyl)benzylidene)-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydro1H-inden-1-one (1a), which in the E isomeric form (and about tenfold less in the UV-B photo-induced isomer Z) showed the best activity as dual inhibitor of the AD-related targets acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Herein, we investigated further photoisomerizable 2-benzylideneindan-1-one analogs 1b\u2013h with the unconjugated tertiary amino moiety bearing alkyls of different bulkiness and lipophilicity. For each compound, the thermal stable E geometric isomer, along with the E/Z mixture as produced by UV-B light irradiation in the photostationary state (PSS, 75% Z), was investigated for the inhibition of human ChEs and MAOs. The pure E-isomer of the N-benzyl(ethyl)amino analog 1h achieved low nanomolar AChE and high nanomolar MAO-B inhibition potencies (IC50s 39 and 355 nM, respectively), whereas photoisomerization to the Z isomer (75% Z in the PSS mixture) resulted in a decrease (about 30%) of AChE inhibitory potency, and not in the MAO-B one. Molecular docking studies were performed to rationalize the different E/Z selectivity of 1h toward the two target enzymes.",

            "text": "The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the aging world population, particularly Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), is influenced by the increase in average life expectancy and unregulated lifestyle, as highlighted in the recent World Alzheimer Reports [1]. In the absence of disease-modifying drugs, AD and PD are considered incurable, and this serious health threat is expected to increase in the near future [2]. By limiting oxidative stress and the associated inflammatory state, as well as by fine-tuning the concentration of neurotransmitters, it is possible to apply some palliative pharmacological therapies to slow down the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and control their symptoms. Among the various pharmacological targets identified, monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and cholinesterases (ChEs) are of particular interest.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155857 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 2 of 21\nMAOs are mitochondrial enzymes responsible for the oxidative catabolism of endogenous monoamines and xenobiotics. Their levels increase with age, resulting in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of the oxidation process, which ultimately leads to neuroinflammation and subsequent brain tissue damage. In humans, two enzyme isoforms, MAOs A and B, have been identified [3], both playing roles in the inactivation of endogenous monoaminergic neurotransmitters, albeit with different specificities. MAO-A is mainly responsible for the catabolism of norepinephrine, serotonin, and epinephrine, whereas MAO-B is more selective for tyramine and dopamine [4,5]. Selective MAO-B inhibitors (MAO-B Is) showed neuroprotective effects due to a reduction in ROS formation and improved cognitive abilities in patients with neurodegenerative disorders by enhancing the level of monoamine neurotransmitters in the CNS [6]. The MAO-B Is selegiline, safinamide, and rasagiline, whose structure is incorporated into that of ladostigil (Figure 1), are used for the treatment of PD [7].\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn\u00a0this\u00a0context,\u00a0we\u00a0have\u00a0combined\u00a0the\u00a0expertise\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0synthesis\u00a0and\u00a0characterization\u00a0 of\u00a0biomimetic\u00a0light\u2010controlled\u00a0molecular\u00a0switches\u00a0and\u00a0motors\u00a0[30\u201336]\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0 of\u00a0 ChE\u2010Is\u00a0 [37\u201339],\u00a0 which\u00a0 have\u00a0 recently\u00a0 led\u00a0 to\u00a0 a\u00a0 small\u00a0 series\u00a0 of\u00a0 photoisomerizable\u00a0 donepezil\u2010like\u00a0 compounds\u00a0with\u00a0 on\u2010off\u00a0 inhibitory\u00a0 activity\u00a0 towards\u00a0AChE\u00a0 and\u00a0MAO\u2010B\u00a0 [40].\u00a0 These\u00a0molecules\u00a0 consist\u00a0 of\u00a0 a\u00a0 diversely\u00a0 decorated\u00a0 indanone\u00a0moiety\u00a0 linked\u00a0 to\u00a0 an\u00a0 N\u2010benzyl\u2010N\u2010ethylethanamine\u00a0 group\u00a0 via\u00a0 an\u00a0 isomerizable\u00a0 carbon\u2010carbon\u00a0 double\u00a0 bond.\u00a0 Their\u00a0 irradiation\u00a0 leads\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 spatial\u00a0 repositioning\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0key\u00a0pharmacophore\u00a0 features\u00a0 responsible\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0interactions\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0binding\u00a0sites\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0target\u00a0enzymes.\u00a0 Among\u00a0 these\u00a0molecules,\u00a01a\u00a0 (Figure\u00a01),\u00a0bearing\u00a0 the\u00a05\u2010methoxyindan\u20101\u2010one\u00a0moiety,\u00a0 showed\u00a0 the\u00a0most\u00a0 interesting\u00a0combination\u00a0of\u00a0photophysical\u00a0and\u00a0biological\u00a0profiles.\u00a0The\u00a0 geometric\u00a0 isomer\u00a0E\u20101a\u00a0 achieved\u00a0noteworthy\u00a0 inhibitory\u00a0 activity\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0high\u00a0nanomolar\u00a0 range\u00a0against\u00a0both\u00a0enzym \u00a0(AChE\u00a0IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.113\u00a0\u03bcM,\u00a0MAO\u2010B\u00a0IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.260\u00a0\u03bcM),\u00a0showing\u00a0 selectivity\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0BChE\u00a0and\u00a0MAO\u2010A\u00a0isoforms\u00a0of\u00a0two\u00a0orders\u00a0of\u00a0magnitude.\u00a0Irradiation\u00a0 of\u00a0E\u20101a\u00a0with\u00a0UV\u2010B\u00a0light\u00a0produced\u00a0an\u00a0E/Z\u00a0mixture\u00a0composed\u00a0of\u00a075%\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Z\u2010isomer\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 photostationary\u00a0state\u00a0(PSS),\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0Z\u20101a\u00a0on\u00a0both\u00a0AChE\u00a0and\u00a0MAO\u2010B\u00a0 decreased\u00a0by\u00a0one\u00a0order\u00a0of\u00a0magnitude\u00a0 (AChE\u00a0 IC50\u00a0=\u00a01.15\u00a0\u03bcM,\u00a0MAO\u2010B\u00a0 IC50\u00a0=\u00a01.94\u00a0\u03bcM),\u00a0 demonstrating\u00a0off\u2010activity\u00a0behavior.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Photoisomerizable\u00a0dual\u00a0AChE/MAO\u2010B\u00a0 inhibitors\u00a0synthesized\u00a0 in\u00a0this\u00a0study\u00a0aim\u00a0at\u00a0opti\u2010\nmizing\u00a0the\u00a0tertiary\u00a0amino\u00a0head\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0hit\u00a0compound\u00a01a;\u00a0the\u00a0E/Z\u00a0isomers\u00a0of\u00a01a\u00a0are\u00a0surrounded\u00a0by\u00a0\nknown\u00a0AChE\u2010Is,\u00a0MAO\u2010B\u2010Is,\u00a0and\u00a0synthetic\u00a0light\u2010gated\u00a0molecular\u00a0switches\u00a0and\u00a0rotors.\u00a0\nBased\u00a0on\u00a0these\u00a0findings,\u00a0we\u00a0expand\u00a0herein\u00a0the\u00a0series\u00a0of\u00a05\u2010methoxyindanone\u00a0deriva\u2010 tives\u00a0by\u00a0synthesizing\u00a0new\u00a0compounds\u00a0 in\u00a0which\u00a0 the\u00a0 tertiary\u00a0amino\u00a0 residue\u00a0of\u00a01a\u00a0bears\u00a0 alkyls\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0bulkiness\u00a0and\u00a0lipophilicity\u00a0(Figure\u00a01).\u00a0A\u00a0major\u00a0aim\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0study\u00a0is\u00a0\nCholinesterase exists in two isoforms, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which catalyze the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), that activates cholinergic synapses and receptors [8]. The impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission is downstr am process in the cognitive deficit associated with AD. T date, holinesterase inhibitors (ChE Is) are among\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 3 of 21\nthe few approved drugs for the symptomatic treatment of AD (Figure 1) that are able to restore cortical cholinergic neurotransmission with consequent beneficial effects on cognition in both AD and PD-related dementia [9]. Among them, rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine are currently indicated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD [10,11]. Due to the multifactorial nature of AD, as well as the frequent comorbidity of various neurodegenerative diseases, the design and optimization of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) represents a noteworthy pharmaceutical development strategy [12\u201316]. In particular, compounds targeting AChE and MAO-B could be useful tools for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The first concrete result was achieved with ladostigil (Figure 1), a dual inhibitor of AChE (reversible) and MAO-B (irreversible), currently in clinical trials (NCT01354691) as an anti-AD drug [17]. Because of the extreme individual variability of the neurodegenerative processes during the different stages of the disease, the search for innovative pharmacological tools that can be used in precision medicine is a real challenge. Controlling the activity of a drug by appropriate external stimuli could represent an effective strategy in the development of \u201cindividualizable molecules\u201d. Among the external stimuli, there is growing interest in light, which can affect a tissue with high spatial and temporal precision in a noninvasive and easily controlled manner [18]. In the last decade, the concept of photopharmacology has been widely developed using bioactive molecules that can change their biological effect as a result of light irradiation [18]. In the initial phase, the development of photoactive molecules was based on photolabile functional groups that irreversibly detached from the photodrug and released the bioactive molecule into the irradiated area. Later, with the advent of light-controlled molecular switches (notably azobenzene) aimed at developing more adaptable molecules, photodrug design shifted to the conjugation of bioactive molecules with molecular photoswitches that could change their geometry in response to an appropriate light stimulus and thus, reversibly switch the pharmacological activity on or off [19\u201321]. Several case studies have been proposed for molecules with photomodulable activity against targets such as ion channels [22\u201324], enzymes [25,26], and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [19,21,27]. However, despite the crucial role of AChE and MAO-B in the neuronal network, which proceeds with extremely fast kinetics, there are few examples of photomodulable inhibitors for these enzymes [28,29]. In this context, we have combined the expertise in the synthesis and characterization of biomimetic light-controlled molecular switches and motors [30\u201336] and in the design of ChE-Is [37\u201339], which have recently led to a small series of photoisomerizable donepezillike compounds with on-off inhibitory activity towards AChE and MAO-B [40]. These molecules consist of a diversely decorated indanone moiety linked to an N-benzyl-Nethylethanamine group via an isomerizable carbon-carbon double bond. Their irradiation leads to the spatial repositioning of the key pharmacophore features responsible for the interactions in the binding sites of the target enzymes. Among these molecules, 1a (Figure 1), bearing the 5-methoxyindan-1-one moiety, showed the most interesting combination of photophysical and biological profiles. The geometric isomer E-1a achieved noteworthy inhibitory activity in the high nanomolar range against both enzymes (AChE IC50 = 0.113 \u00b5M, MAO-B IC50 = 0.260 \u00b5M), showing selectivity over the BChE and MAO-A isoforms of two orders of magnitude. Irradiation of E-1a with UV-B light produced an E/Z mixture composed of 75% of the Z-isomer in the photostationary state (PSS), and the inhibitory effect of Z-1a on both AChE and MAO-B decreased by one order of magnitude (AChE IC50 = 1.15 \u00b5M, MAO-B IC50 = 1.94 \u00b5M), demonstrating off-activity behavior. Based on these findings, we expand herein the series of 5-methoxyindanone derivatives by synthesizing new compounds in which the tertiary amino residue of 1a bears alkyls with different bulkiness and lipophilicity (Figure 1). A major aim of this study is the investigation of the effect of the amino/ammonium head on the diastereoisomerism-dependent activity\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 4 of 21\nby evaluating the difference in the inhibitory capacity of the mixtures at the PSS, which mainly consists of the photoinduced isomer Z (75%), on AChE and MAO-B."

            "text": "From a pharmacological point of view, the structure of parent compound 1a can be traced back to the well-known anti-Alzheimer drug donepezil. This molecule has a 5,6-methoxyindanone unit linked to an N-benzylpiperidine moiety via a chiral center. By manipulating this structure, Sheng and coworkers discovered non-chiral compounds with AChE-inhibitory activity comparable to donepezil [41]. Specifically, they replaced the chiral center with an exocyclic double bond and reversed the position of the benzyl ring with the basic center (e.g., compound 2, Figure 2). In our previous study, focusing on dual AChE/MAO-B inhibitors, the effect of methoxy groups on the interaction with the two enzymes was investigated. We found that removing the 6-OMe group of the indanone moiety resulted in a molecule with submicromolar inhibitory activity for both target enzymes [40]. Thanks to the presence of the hemiindigoid chromophore [42,43], this molecule is able to reversibly photoisomerize by the application of UV light and spatially shift the functional groups responsible for the interaction in the binding sites of the two enzymes. Among the key pharmacophore features, the tertiary amino residue plays a first-rate role by interacting at the catalytic anionic site (CAS) site of AChE, anchoring the inhibitor in the enzyme gorge. Photoisomerization of the exocyclic double bond leads to the displacement of the indanone carbonyl, and the 5-OMe group alters their interactions in the middle of the binding gorge and at the peripheral anionic site (PAS).\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe\u00a0 investigation\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0

Design of the new phot isomerizable dual AChE/MAO-B inhibitors. Compounds 2 and 1a have been reported in ref [41] and [40] respectively.\nIn this st dy, the ethyl residu s on the tertiary amine were replaced by various alkyl chains (linear or branched) of different lipophilicity and bulkiness. These substitutions could have favorable or unfavorable effects on the interaction of the tertiary amine in the CAS region of the AChE gorge and, conversely, on other interactions in the middle gorge and in PAS. On the other hand, the increase in lipophilicity around the basic head could improve the inhibition potency against the MAO-B enzyme. Compounds 1b\u2013h were prepared by aldol condensation of 5-methoxyindan-1-one (3) with the corresponding aldehyde derivative 4b\u2013h using KOH in methanol, as shown in Scheme 1A. In this reaction, only the E diastereoisomer was obtained for each compound, according to the assignment by 1H NMR analysis.

Methanolic solutions (1 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) of 1b\u2013h at the PSS showed a drastic decrease in the absorption bands attributed to the E diastereomers and the appearance of new blue-shifted absorption bands attributed to the presence of the Z diastereoisomers, consistent with a decrease in \u03c0-\u03c0 electron conjugation [44]."

            "text": "The pure E isomers 1b\u2013h, along with E-1a retested in this study, and the related E/Z mixtures at the PSS (75% Z isomer) were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE, and MAO-A and B. The inhibition data summarized in Table 1 show that all compounds, without any noteworthy structure-dependent difference, are selective toward AChE and MAO-B over BChE and MAO-A, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 8 of 21\na The diastereomeric E/Z mixtures\u2019 ratios (25:75) at the photostationary state after UV-B light irradiation of the E methanolic solutions were established for all compounds by 1H NMR spectrometry. b IC50 values determined by interpolation of the sigmoidal dose\u2013response curves as obtained by regression with GraphPad Prism software (ver.5.01) of at least seven data points, or percent inhibition in parentheses for samples achieving less than 50% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M concentration; n.a. = not active; data are means \u00b1 SD of three independent measurements. c Human cholinesterases and monoamine oxidase isoforms. d donepezil and tacrine were used as positive controls in AChE and BChE inhibition assays, respectively. e Clorgiline and safinamide were used as positive controls in MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition assays, respectively. f Data re-determined in this work, agreeing with those previously reported.\nChE inhibitory activities were determined by applying Ellman\u2019s assay with slight modifications, using the drugs donepezil and tacrine as positive controls of AChE and BChE selective inhibition, respectively [45,46]. All the pure geometric isomers E-1a\u2013h selectively inhibit AChE, with IC50 values falling in the submicromolar concentration range. Weaker inhibition of BChE was observed for all the compounds, with only E-1f\u2013h achieving finite IC50s \u2264 10 \u00b5M. E-1h (IC50 = 39 nM) turned out almost equipotent with donepezil (IC50 = 21 nM), taken as positive control together with the dual AChE/BChE inhibitor tacrine. All the E/Z mixtures (75% Z) were found to be less active toward AChE than the corresponding pure E isomers, suggesting that the Z isomers have a lower binding affinity compared to the E isomers, as previously observed for the pure Z-1a [40]. A pairwise comparison of the AChE inhibition data with the physicochemical features of the tertiary amino head would suggest that the hydrophobicity/bulkiness (not sharply distinguishable within this series) of the -NR2 may affect the AChE inhibitory potency of the examined compounds. However, the pure E isomers cover an IC50 range of just 1.4 log units, and with the exception of the most active (1h, R = \u2212N(Et)Bn) and the least active (1d, R = \u2212NnBu2) inhibitors, the activity data for the other six compounds span a range of only 0.5 log units. Nevertheless, within the limits of the biological and lipophilicity space explored, a nonlinear (likely parabolic) correlation trend (not shown) between \u2212logIC50 and the calculated log P for the \u2212NR2 fragment appears to hold for six of eight compounds. Two apparent outliers with respect to the parabolic relationship trend were the less-activethan-predicted 1f (likely, higher steric hindrance of iPr compared to nPr groups in 1c) and the more-active-than-predicted 1h (additional aromatic interactions of the Bn group compared to Et in 1a).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 9 of 21\nThe mechanism of AChE inhibition by the most potent inhibitor E-1h, was investigated. Lineweaver\u2013Burk curves were generated with a fixed amount of AChE and substrate concentrations ranging between 25 and 300 mM in the absence or presence of the inhibitor at different concentrations (ranging from 5 to 500 nM). The binding of E-1h to AChE changed both Vmax and Km values, a trend generally attributed to the mixed-type inhibition (Figure 6). The replot of the slopes versus the corresponding inhibitor concentrations provided a Ki value of 100 nM.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0

findi gs [40] a d literatu e data on structurally similar c m ounds [47,48], MAO-A/B i hibi ion was e aluated for pure E isomers and E/Z mixtures. All the comp s in th pure E form proved t b MAO-B-selective inhibitors with all submicromolar IC50 values. Only i two cases, namely E/Z 1c (R = \u2212NnPr2) nd 1f (R = \u2212NiPr2), finite IC50 values around 3 \u00b5M were achieved against MAO-A, with the Z isomers being slightly more potent than the E isomers. The IC50 values of MAO-B are in a narrow concentration range (just 0.6 log units) with no apparent lipophilicity-dependent effect. Even in the case of MAO-B inhibition, the Z isomers were fou d to be less potent than the E isomers, with the notable exception of 1h (R = \u2212N(Et)Bn) whose E/Z mixture in the PSS (75% Z) achieving the same IC50 as the pure E-1h. Combining the inhibition data on the two enzymes, it is interesting to note that the replacement of the -NEt2 group of compound 1a with a more hindered dissymmetrical substituent as in the case of compound 1e (R = \u2212N(Me)Bu) led to an improvement in the MAO-B IC50 of the diastereoisomer E (IC50 E-1a = 0.260 \u00b5M vs. E-1e = 0.178 \u00b5M) at the expense of the diastereoisomeric difference (IC50 PSS E/Z-1a = 1.59 \u00b5M vs. PSS E/Z-1e 0.651 \u00b5M). In contrast, the inhibitory capacity of E-1e towards AChE remained almost unchanged with respect to 1a while significantly increasing the deactivating effect of light (IC50 PSS E/Z-1a = 0.78 \u00b5M vs. PSS E/Z-1e 1.36 \u00b5M). Regarding the potent AChE/MAO-B dual inhibitor 1h, the E isomer is slightly more potent than the Z isomer as an AChE inhibitor, whereas no diastereoselectivity was observed for MAO-B inhibition."

            "text": "To explain the observed inhibition data of the isomers E-1h and Z-1h against human AChE and MAO-B at the molecular level, docking calculations were performed on crystal structures of hAChE complexed with donepezil (PDB code: 4EY7) and hMAO-B in complex with safinamide (PDB code: 2V5Z). Considering the top-scored docking pose, both E-1h and Z-1h diastereoisomers accommodate in the gorge of the active site, in the middle of the PAS and the CAS [49].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 10 of 21\nIn particular, the indanone group of E-1h, in its top-scored pose (Figure 7), occupies the PAS by establishing a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with W286 and the gorge through a backbone H-bond with F295 mediated by the carbonyl group; additionally, it interacts inside the CAS forming a cation-\u03c0 interaction, which involves W86 and the protonated tertiary amino group. Otherwise, the 1h in Z geometry locates the indanone core away from the PAS and contacts the CAS through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with W86; moreover, the Z-isomer engages the aromatic residues of the gorge, and, more specifically, Y341 and Y337 by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and cation-\u03c0 interactions, respectively. More importantly, the docking-based comparison of E and Z geometries shows that the former best complies with the X-ray donepezil bioactive conformation (Figure 8). The indanone cores of donepezil and E-1h are well superimposed, and both make interactions with F295 and W286. Furthermore, although lacking the piperidine nitrogen as donepezil, which forms cation-\u03c0 interaction with Y337, E-1h has a protonable benzylamino group which may engage double cation-\u03c0 interactions with W86, as the cation-\u03c0 interaction and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking found out in the AChE inhibitor drug. Noteworthy, the higher inhibitor potency of the E-1h diastereoisomer is in agreement with its higher docking score and ligand efficiency (LE)

Experiments were performed in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria) on the Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader (Tecan, Cernusco s.N., Italy), using already published protocols [46,58\u201360]. Inhibition data and constants (IC50s and Kis) were calculated with Prism (version 5.01 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The inhibition of human recombinant AChE or BChE from human serum was determined by applying Ellman\u2019s spectrophotometric method as described in previously reported protocols [46,59]. Donepezil and tacrine were taken as positive controls in the AChE and BChE inhibition assays, respectively. The reported data agree with those previously reported [40]. The AChE activity was determined in an assay solution containing AChE (0.09 U/mL), 5,50-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (i.e., the Ellman\u2019s reagent, 0.33 mM), the test compound (10 \u00b5M concentration, or seven scalar concentrations for compounds achieving >60% enzyme inhibition at 10 \u00b5M), in 0.1 M PBS pH 8.0. After 20 min incubation at 25 \u25e6C, the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (5 \u00b5M) was added, and its hydrolysis rates were monitored for 5.0 min at 412 nm. The BChE inhibitory activity was similarly determined by using BChE (0.09 U/mL) and butyrylthiocholine iodide (5 \u00b5M) as the substrate. IC50 value, determined by the nonlinear regression method \u2018log[inhibitor] vs. response\u2019, or the % inhibition at 10 \u00b5M, is expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent measurements, each one performed in duplicate. The IC50 values, Michaelis\u2013Menten curve fitting, and inhibition constant (Ki) were calculated by nonlinear regression using Prism software. In MAOs\u2019 inhibition assays, each test compound, at 10 \u00b5M concentration, was preincubated for 20 min at 37 \u25e6C with 50 \u00b5M kynuramine as the substrate in 0.1 M phosphatebuffered solution (PBS) pH 8.0 made 0.39 osmolar with KCl. After the addition of human recombinant MAO-A (250 U/mg) or MAO B (59 U/mg) and a further 30 min of incubation, NaOH was added, and the fluorescence read at 310/400 nm excitation/emission wavelength. For compounds achieving at least 60% inhibition of MAO at 10 \u00b5M concentration, seven scalar concentrations of each inhibitor were tested, and the concentration producing 50% inhibition of the MAO activity (IC50) was calculated by nonlinear regression. IC50 is expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of three independent measurements, each one performed in duplicate. Clorgiline and safinamide, retested in this work, were taken as positive controls in the MAO A/B assays. For the kinetic study on the inhibition mechanism of MAO B, three diverse scalar concentrations of the inhibitor and seven concentrations of kynuramine were used [40,61,62]."

The protein preparation wizard available in the Schr\u00f6dinger Suite (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2022-4) was employed to optimize X-ray crystal structures: missing side chains have been reconstructed, and protonation states at pH = 7.4 \u00b1 0.0 have been predicted. Finally, energy minimization on the crystal structures was applied using the OPLS_2005 force field (Banks et al., 2005). Starting from SMILES annotations (Weininger, 1988), 3D structures of E-1h and Z-1h isomers have been generated, and their protonation states at pH = 7.4 \u00b1 0.0 were computed by LigPrep tool of Schr\u00f6dinger Suite using the OPLS_2005 force field. The same steps have been reiterated for hAchE and hMAO-B cognate ligands (i.e., donepezil and safinamide, respectively). Glide v9.1 (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2022- 4: Glide, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2022) was adopted to perform docking simulations upon both targets applying OPLS_2005 force field. Docking calibration on cognate ligands was carried out in order to find out the most suitable docking protocol for each target: the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) on heavy atoms between the docking pose and the X-ray coordinates of the cognate ligand was computed. In this respect, a\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5857 18 of 21\ncubic grid box of 15 \u00c5 for AchE (RMSD = 0.372) and a cubic grid box of 12 \u00c5 for MAO-B (RMSD = 0.467), both placed in the center of mass of the X-ray cognate ligands, were used to perform docking simulations. Standard Precision (SP) docking precision and OPLS_2005 force field were applied. The top-ranked docking poses of E-1h and Z-1h isomers were chosen to examine their target interactions and to compare them with the cognate ligands.

            "text": "Investigating the AChE/MAO-B dual inhibitory activity of some newly synthesized donepezil-like 2-benzylideneindan-1-one derivatives, which differ for bulkiness/lipophilicity of the unconjugated tertiary amino head, we gathered new clues about the photoswitchable E/Z isomerization controlling inhibitors\u2019 binding to two AD-related target enzymes. Confirming our previous study [40], all the new compounds were obtained exclusively as E geometric isomers. Thanks to the photoswitching properties of the 2-benzylideneindan1-one chromophore, Z isomers were generated in photostationary mixtures (75% of Z in all the examined cases) by exposure to UV-B radiation. The pure E-isomers showed submicromolar IC50 values on human AChE, in most cases, with a good selectivity over the BChE isoform. Interestingly, among the donepezil-like molecules synthesized so far, 1h bearing the N-benzyl(ethyl)amino group at the para position of the benzylidene moiety proved to be a potent nanomolar AChE inhibitor, achieving an IC50 of 39 nM (i.e., threefold more potent of the parent E-1a). The irradiation and consequent enrichment in the Z isomer (75% Z in the PSS) led to a decrease in activity (IC50 of PSS-1h equals 53 nM), less sharp than that observed with the parent, 1a. This suggests that the replacement of one ethyl group in E-1a with a more lipophilic benzyl moiety in E-1h, due to additional hydrophobic and aromatic interactions with residues into the enzyme binding pockets (e.g., Phe295 as shown by docking calculation), may improve the inhibitory potency of the E-1h compared to E-1a, at the same time flattening the differences in IC50s between the isomer E and the PSS E/Z mixture. No other compound showed an increase in inhibitory activity as appreciable as 1h, whereas the N-Me(nBu) analog 1e showed the highest difference in AChE inhibition potency between the thermal steady state E-1e (IC50 = 0.102 \u00b5M) and the photoinduced one PSS-1e (IC50 = 1.36 \u00b5M). The modifications carried out on the tertiary amino head of the parent compound 1a seems well-tolerated by MAO-B; indeed, all compounds in the E geometry achieved submicromolar IC50 values and discrete selectivity over MAO-A. The effect of the E-to-Z photoinduced transition in MAO-B inhibition was more modest (no diastereoselectivity with 1h) than that observed in AChE. Molecular docking studies performed with the potent dual inhibitor 1h helped in highlighting the binding modes of the two diastereoisomers in AChE and MAO-B binding sites. Considering the in vivo application limits of ultraviolet radiation (i.e., poor tissue penetrability and potential cytotoxicity), the data discussed herein represent the basis for the optimization of a donepezil-like molecule capable of synergistically inhibiting two target enzymes, namely AChE and MAO-B, involved in neurodegenerative diseases, with the added value of the photomodulation of the pharmacological effect, in order to obtain a tool of interest for the personalized medicine of the future. However, the achievement of the final goal deserves further efforts aimed at improving the characteristics of this family of compounds, paying attention to increasing the wavelength absorption and maintaining (or increasing) the inhibitory potency.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28155857/s1, 1H NMR spectra of all the compounds and 13C NMR spectra of the newly synthesized compounds.
