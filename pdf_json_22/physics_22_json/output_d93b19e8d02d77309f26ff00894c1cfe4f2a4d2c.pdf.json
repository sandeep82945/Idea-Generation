Transition frequencies of 214905335185 and 6 217105181898 kHz were derived from 33 and 83 recordings, with corresponding root mean squared 7 deviation of 53 and 33 kHz for the R(0) and R(1) transition, respectively. This is the first sub-MHz 8 frequency determination of the R(0) transition frequency and represents a three order of magnitude 9 accuracy improvement compared to literature. The R(1) transition frequency is in very good agreement 10 with previous determinations in saturation regime reported with similar accuracy. To achieve such 11 accuracy, the transition frequency of a (101)-(000) 211-312 line of H216O interfering with the R(0) line 12 had to be precisely determined and is reported with a standard error of 100 Hz at 214904329820.80(10) 13 kHz (relative uncertainty of 5\u00d710-13).

The HD isotopologue which represents the simplest neutral heteronuclear diatomic molecule 20 has been at the origin of a fruitful scientific emulation on both theoretical (e.g. [1], [2], [3], [4]), and 21 experimental (e.g. [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]) fronts. 22 Although weak, the rovibrational transitions in HD are about two orders of magnitude stronger 23 than in H2. This is due to the existence of a small electric dipole moment in HD, giving rise to allowed 24 electric dipole transitions which are strictly forbidden in H2 (and D2), in which only electric quadrupole 25 transitions remain observable. The electric dipole transitions in HD are thus particularly suitable to 26 achieve very high accuracy frequency determination using absorption spectroscopy. Since the 27 pioneering work of Herzberg [5], the weak HD absorption spectrum has been extensively studied using 28 a variety of experimental techniques (see the review of experimental measurements up to 2016 included 29 in Table 1 of [14]). Overall, more than seventy transitions were detected from the rotational spectrum 30 [11] up to the fifth overtone band, (6\u20130) near 520 nm [8]. 31 While the pioneer experimental efforts were motivated by planetary applications, the HD 32 molecule has become a benchmark system which triggered great efforts to improve quantum physics 33 calculation accuracy. This includes in particular quantum electrodynamics corrections (QED) of the 34 energy levels up to the sixth order [20], [3] and hyperfine splitting determination [21], [4], [22]. 35 Interestingly, HD is for now the sole dihydrogen isotopologue for which a disagreement exists on the 36 dissociation energy between experimental and theoretical values [23], [13], [3]. HD is thus an attractive 37 molecular candidate to challenge further theoretical predictions and test the amplitude of the QED 38 corrections. 39 Experimental advances in terms of sensitivity, resolution and accuracy on the frequency 40 determination of HD rovibrational transitions, ionization potential and dissociations energies provide 41 stringent validation tests of the most advanced calculations [23], [13]. 42 Doppler broadening is a strong limitation factor to achieve sub-MHz precision on line center 43 determination, even at low temperature. Indeed, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Doppler 44 limited profile of the (2-0) R(0) or R(1) HD lines is about 700 MHz at 80 K. Saturation spectroscopy 45 provides a powerful tool to circumvent Doppler broadening. Recently, accurate measurements of HD 46 transitions were reported in the sub-Doppler regime using either action spectroscopy schemes [24], [18] 47 or the power enhancement of a Fabry Perot cavity to observe Doppler free Lamb dip signatures [15], 48 [25]. In particular, the Hefei [15] and Amsterdam [25] groups retrieved (2-0) R(1) transition frequencies 49 from Lamb dips exhibiting a dispersive-like spectral structure. The initial reported values differed by 50 900 kHz, a difference significantly larger than the combined error bar of the two measurements. This 51 discrepancy and the unusual Lamb dip profile were examined in two subsequent studies led by the same 52 groups [16], [26]. In Hefei, an experimental study was performed with an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio 53\nand the use of different spectroscopic techniques confirming the dispersive-like shape, fitted with a Fano 54 profile [26]. Physical mechanisms at the origin of this Fano-type profile was very recently discussed by 55 the same group [27]. For the Amsterdam group, the dip was fitted according to Bloch equations 56 formalism and introducing crossovers transitions [16]. Both groups found line positions in agreement 57 with each other within the error bars of 50 and 240 kHz for Amsterdam and Hefei, respectively. 58 Interestingly, the same (2-0) R(1) transition was measured with similar accuracy in Doppler 59 regime at room temperature in Caserta [19] providing an error bar of 76 kHz, on the same order as the 60 one of Doppler free measurements. The line position of the (2-0) R(1) is now determined within 50 kHz 61 but the origin of the observed dispersive Lamb-dip profile remains a subject of discussion. 62 In the present work, we report on high accuracy frequency measurements of the R(0) and R(1) 63 transitions of the (2-0) vibrational band of HD at liquid nitrogen temperature (about 80 K). The 64 advantages of cooling are several: (i) the Doppler broadening is reduced by about a factor of two, (ii) 65 the intensity of the R(0) transition is increased by a factor of about 3, compared to its 296 K value, the 66 intensity of the R(1) transition being mostly unchanged, (iii) spectral interferences with lines due to 67 impurities, water in particular, are minimized since vapor pressure of most contaminants are drastically 68 reduced. Note that while the (2-0) R(1) transition frequency was determined by three groups with an 69 accuracy better than 100 kHz, the best-to-date frequency determination of the (2-0) R(0) transition is 30 70 MHz [12]. The lack of accurate measurements of the R(0) line is related to the proximity of a 105 times 71 more intense water line which precludes room temperature experiments. Our experimental approach for 72 high accuracy HD measurements at low pressures in a water free environment is described in the next 73\nsection. It combines the advantages of (i) a very monochromatic and stable laser source (~100Hz, 74 drift=1Hz/s) developed for cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) cavity [28], [29], (ii) an absolute 75 frequency calibration provided by a frequency comb and (iii) a CRDS cell cooled down to liquid 76 nitrogen temperature. In Section 3, we present the transition frequency determination including a 77 discussion of the possible impact of the hfs structure on the retrieved line centers and the error budget. 78 The obtained transition frequencies are discussed in relation with literature results in Section 4, before 79 the Concluding remarks (Section 5). 80\nExperiment\nThe spectra were recorded at the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes with a set-up presented in Fig. 1. The 81 figure is structured in three blocks, from top to bottom, those concern (1) the frequency calibration, (2) 82 the light source and (3) the cavity ring-down spectrometer probing a gas cell working at liquid nitrogen 83 temperature. The VCOF light source is a DFB laser diode locked through optical feedback to a highly-84 stable V-shaped cavity [28], [29], [30]. This source has sub-kHz emission line width, typically 10 mW 85 output power, and exhibits a maximum frequency drift of 7 Hz/s [30], [31]. Its frequency is first roughly 86 determined using a wavemeter (Burleigh, 50 MHz resolution) and refined using a self-referenced 87 frequency comb from Menlo. The repetition rate (250 MHz) and carrier offset frequencies (20 MHz) of 88\nthe comb are phase locked to a 10 MHz GPS disciplined Rb oscillator (GPS-RbO) with a relative 89 frequency stability \u00d7 limited by the GPS accuracy. The design of the continuous-wave 90 cavity ring-down spectrometer (CW-CRDS) follows mainly the one presented in [28]. The spectrometer 91 has been slightly modified by the addition of a pair of optical amplifiers (Thorlabs BOA 1036P, Thorlabs 92 BOA 1410P). The very stable laser source is made tunable over 18 GHz range using a single side-band 93 generator, the Mach-Zender modulator (MZM) in Fig. 1, driven by a frequency synthesizer (SMF 100A, 94 Rohde&Schwarz), referenced to the GPS-RbO. 95\nstainless-steel cylinder is 1.4 m long, with a diameter of d = 63 mm, while the cryostat is made of the 109 two inner co-axial tubes (d = 1.6 and 2 cm), welded at each end by a hollow disc to form a reservoir. It 110 is suspended at its center by a jacketed 2 cm diameter tube used to fill the cryostat with liquid nitrogen. 111 The main difference with [32] is that the mirrors can be further aligned while the cell is put under vacuum 112 and cooled down. The enhanced conduction of HD compared to CH4 studied in previous works [32], 113 [34], [35] forced us to work at very low pressure (2 Pa) to prevent any excessive cooling of the external 114 part of the cell. 115 During recording, the optical frequency is dynamically adjusted by subtracting an adjustable 116 microwave frequency between 2 and 20 GHz using the MZM. To speed up the recording, the spectra 117 are acquired in an interlaced manner with frequency hopping bursts equal to the free spectral range of 118 the CRD cavity. The cavity modes are thus systematically resonant. To increase the resolution, an 119 intermediate optical frequency is chosen inducing a procedure of relock of the CRDS cavity modes, 120 thanks to the PZT mounted mirror. Another burst is then recorded. Thus 4 series of spectra are interlaced 121 to reach a resolution of 25 MHz with a cavity whose FSR is 100 MHz. A full spectrum, with 10 to 40 122 RD per spectral point, is recorded within typically 1 minute. 123\nResults 124\nThe R(1) line 125 The R(1) transition, already accurately measured in [15], [25], [26] and [19] was used to validate 126 our measurement procedure. Eighty-three fourfold interlaced spectra were recorded at liquid nitrogen 127 temperature with frequency step of 100 MHz (matching the CRDS cavity free spectral range) leading to 128 a final 25 MHz step resolution. During each scan, the cell temperature, HD partial pressure and baseline 129 were slowly evolving, due to thermo-mechanical stress. Before being analyzed by the line fitting routine, 130 the four interlaced spectra were independently corrected from a linear baseline before being recombined. 131 This allows for partial compensation of baseline fluctuations related to temperature instability. 132\nEach of the eighty-three fourfold interlaced spectra were fitted independently. The line shape was 141 chosen as a Voigt profile with the Gaussian width fixed to its 77 K Doppler value (770 MHz FWHM). 142 The Lorentzian component width was fixed to 11 MHz to minimize the residuals. This width value has 143 been determined by averaging the results of an initial fit for which this parameter was kept free. This 144 weak component helps to account for a small temperature gradient existing in the probed gas sample, as 145 detailed below for the R(0) line treatment. The center and area of the HD R(1) line as well as a quadratic 146 baseline were determined by the fit. A typical fourfold spectrum together with the corresponding fit 147 residuals are presented on Fig. 2. The root mean square (RMS) of the residuals (or noise equivalent 148 absorption coefficient) is on the order of 6\u00d710-12 cm-1 which leads to a quality factor of about 2500 (QF 149 is defined as the ratio of the absorption coefficient at the peak to the RMS of the residuals). 150 The averaged value of the 83 center determinations of the (2-0) R(1) line is found to be 151\n217105181934 kHz with a 1 statistical deviation of 53 kHz. The Allan deviation plot of the retrieved 152 frequencies, presented in Fig. 3, suggests that the accuracy of the averaged line center is below the RMS 153\nvalue but higher than the standard error /\u221a\ud835\udc41 =53/\u221a83\u2248 6 kHz). The Allan deviation trace is going 154 down, below 20 kHz, indicating that the average transition frequency value remains stable beyond this 155\nlimit. A 20 kHz value seems a conservative estimate of the actual uncertainty on the obtained line center 156 value. 157\nThe R(0) line 164 For the more intense (2-0) R(0) line, we recorded a series of 33 spectra. As said above, at 77 K, 165 the R(0) line intensity is increased by a factor of 3 compared to its room temperature value while the 166 R(1) line intensity is mostly unchanged. The cryogenic temperature of the cell allowed for a drastic 167 reduction of the water contamination which is major issue. The (101)-(000) 211-312 H216O line at 168 7168.4369 cm-1 has indeed a 1.196\u00d710-20 cm/molecule intensity at room temperature and overlaps the 169 profile of the R(0) HD line at 7168.4703 cm-1 (with a room temperature intensity of 2.445\u00d710-25 170 cm/molecule) [36]. 171 Still, as evidenced in the following analysis of the R(0) line profile, water traces persist, that we 172 attribute to outgasing from the mirrors which are not cooled (see Fig. 1 and [32], [33]) and remain at a 173 temperature close to the room temperature. As shown below, the contribution of the water line to the 174 observed absorption remains very weak but is detectable at the achieved sensitivity. In order to 175 accurately constrain its position in the fitting of the R(0) line profile, we determined the center of the 176 interfering water line in saturated regime at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. A series of 247 spectra 177 was recorded over 39 hours in order to refine the dip position. The reader is referred to [29] for the 178 description of the acquisition of the line profile and Lamb dip spectra with adaptive resolution. Briefly, 179 a first low resolution (100 MHz) survey scan was recorded, from which the line center was roughly 180\ndetermined using a Gaussian profile. This spectrum was immediately supplemented with a high 181 resolution (20 kHz) scan around the center as presented in the inset of Fig. 4. No effort was made to fit 182 the ring-down using an advanced model (see e.g. [37]) and a Lorenzian fit was performed to determine 183 the center of the Lamb dip. From the 247 determinations, an average center value of 184 214904329.8263(15) MHz or 7168.43683327(5) cm-1 was determined i.e. about 6.6 \u00d710-4 cm-1 below 185 the HITRAN value provided with a 10-3 cm-1 error bar [36]. 186 The Allan deviation included in Fig. 3 indicates that the water line position is determined with 187 1.5 kHz accuracy per scan and that the precision is enhanced by the averaging process following the 188\nnormal law in 1/\u221a\ud835\udc41, where N is the number of recordings. The resulting standard error is thus decreased 189\nby a factor of about 15 (\u2248\u221a243) compared to the RMS leading to a very small uncertainty value of 0.1 190 kHz. This confirms the stability of the frequency detection chain. Note that the room temperature water 191 line at 10-3 Pa pressure and the 80 K HD line at 2 Pa have similar peak absorption (about 15\u00d710-9 cm-1) 192 and linewidths (627 and 770 MHz FWHM, respectively), but the water dip is remarkably deep (5\u00d710-9 193 cm-1) and much narrow (600 kHz FWHM). As a result, a gain of an order of magnitude is achieved in 194 pointing the line center in saturation regime. 195\nFollowing the same treatment as described for the R(1) line, the thirty-three fourfold interlaced 203 spectra of the R(0) line were fitted with a Voigt profile with 77 K Doppler width and an effective 204 Lorentzian width of 4 MHz (this value is an averaged value obtained after a first fit session in which the 205 Lorentzian width was kept free). In Fig. 5, we present one of the 33 fitted spectra with the corresponding 206 residuals. The residuals (blue trace) show an asymmetry which is interpreted as due to the above water 207 line and may affect the determination of the R(0) line center. To minimize this effect, a weak water line 208 contribution was added in the fit procedure. The center of the water line was fixed at its Lamb dip value 209 (dashed vertical line in Fig. 5). The profile was taken as a Doppler profile corresponding to a temperature 210 of 300K and the amplitude was adjusted. As a result, a symmetric residual is obtained (red trace). The 211 fit RMS of a single spectrum is evaluated to 4\u00d710-12 cm-1 leading to a quality factor of about 8500. 212\nAveraging the 33 determinations of the center of the (2-0) R(0) line leads to a value of 225\n kHz with a 1 statistical deviation of 29 kHz. The Allan-variance plot of the line position 226 series included in Fig. 3, confirms the absence of an obvious frequency determination drift over time. 227 Although the number of recordings is limited, the statistics allows for a gain compared to the RMS 228 value. In order to be conservative, we adopted the same 20 kHz uncertainty value as for the R(0) line. 229 To validate our approach and better reveal the water line contribution in the baseline noise, we 230 averaged together the 33 individual spectra to produce a single spectrum with improved signal-to-noise 231 ratio. We fitted this spectrum by adjusting exclusively the line area, the line position and widths being 232 fixed to their above values. The residuals included in Fig.5 illustrate the gain on the S/N ratio (the trace 233 thickness is decreased to about 7\u00d710-13 cm-1) and the water line is then clearly visible. It is interesting to 234 note that the water line is very weak (10-11 cm-1 peak absorption e.g. one order of magnitude stronger 235 than the noise level) but it shifts the fitted value of the HD line center by about 3 kHz because it slightly 236 distorts the HD line profile. Let us emphasize that the averaged spectrum only served to confirm the 237 contribution of the water line and validate the position parameter obtained from the 33 single fit 238 determinations. 239 A clear symmetric structure remains in the residuals of our best fit (including the water line). We 240 interpret this structure as a consequence of a temperature gradient due to the mirrors which are kept at 241 room temperature and in contact with the gas. The effects of this gradient was revealed in spectra of 242 methane at 80 K recorded with a similar cryogenic cell [38]. The relative population of high rotational 243 energy levels of methane was found significantly larger than expected from the Boltzmann distribution 244 at 80 K]. To test this interpretation, the continuous gradient of temperatures was modeled by four zones 245 of decreasing sizes and increasing temperatures (77, 82, 218 and 275 K). It appears then that the profile 246 of the HD line can be reproduced at the noise level limit by a sum of four Doppler profiles, corresponding 247 to 77, 82, 218 and 275 K, with center fixed at the above-determined HD frequency, and a relative weight 248 to the total area of 84.6, 14.3%, 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. In this way, the symmetric structure 249 remaining in the residuals vanishes (see lowest panel of Fig. 5) and the quality factor reaches a value of 250 50000. Even if based on a rough approximation, this result confirms that the linewidth is largely 251 dominated by temperature rather than collisional effects that would affect the line center. The Lorentzian 252 component used in the global fit procedure of the individual spectra is only an approximate solution 253 which has the advantage of preserving the symmetry of the profile. 254\nTransition frequencies and comparison with literature 255\nTransition frequencies and error budget 256 The line center frequencies of the HD (2-0) R(0) and R(1) along with the one of the (101)-(000) 257 211-312 H2O transition are listed in Table 1. After correcting those frequencies by the recoil, the second 258 order Doppler effect and the pressure shift, we obtain absolute transition frequencies of 259\n217105181898(20) and 214905335185(20) kHz for the (2-0) R(1) and R(0) HD transitions respectively 260 and 214904329820.80(10) kHz for the H216O (101)-(000) 211-312 transition. 261 The R(1) pressure shift correction was calculated using the pressure-shift coefficient of -262 0.87\u00b10.05 kHz/Pa determined in [19] for the R(1) transition. It leads to a correction of 1.74(1) kHz for 263 our line center measured at 2 Pa. As concerns the R(0) transition, in absence of literature value, we 264 adopted the pressure shift coefficient of the R(1) transition with a very conservative relative uncertainty 265 of 50 % (pressure shifts coefficients measured for H2 transitions do not show important rotational 266 dependence [38], [39]). The frequency calibration chain is expected to bring no bias. 267\n271 Notes 272 a The first value is the RMS of the different determinations. The second value is the reduced value allowed by the 273 statistics (see text), 274 b The R(1) pressure shift of -0.87(5) kHz/Pa was taken from [19] for the R(1) transition and assumed to be identical 275 for the R(0) transition (see text). 276 277 From Table 1, it appears that for the three considered lines, the overall uncertainty on the 278 transition frequency is largely dominated by the line (or dip) center determination. Due to the low 279 pressure of our recordings (2 Pa for HD and ~10-3 Pa for H2O), the impact of the pressure shift is mostly 280 negligible. In Table 1, we give for the different transitions the RMS deviation of the different 281 determinations together with a (lower) error value resulting of the statistics of the recordings (N= 83, 33 282 and 243 recordings for R(1), R(0) and H216O, respectively). In the case of the water line, the Allan 283 deviation plot (Fig. 3) show that the statistics follows a normal law and the final uncertainty of about 284 100 Hz coincides with standard deviation. As discussed above, in the case of the R(1) and R(0) 285\ntransitions of HD, the 1/\u221a\ud835\udc41 trend is less obvious and, on the basis of Fig. 3, we give a 20 kHz 286 uncertainty value as a conservative estimate of the real error bar. 287 Another possible source of error, not mentioned in Table 1, is related to the underlying hyperfine 288 structure (hfs) of the R(1) and R(0) lines. The hfs structure of HD lines has been modeled in the literature 289 by ab initio calculations [4] and a combination of ab initio calculations, an effective Hamiltonian and 290 tensorial algebra [21]. The influence of the hfs on the pressure shift value and on the frequency 291 determination of the (2-0) R(1) was discussed in [19]. In the above profile analysis, the effect of the hfs 292 was neglected considering it to be barycentric. In order to evaluate quantitatively the error associated to 293\nthis approximation, we first calculated the hfs of the (2-0) R(0) and (2-0) R(1) transitions using the 294 parameters provided in [21] and changing the sign of some of them as mentioned in [18]. Other 295 spectroscopic parameters were obtained from a global fit including experimental data concerning the v= 296 0 [11], [40] and v= 2 [25], [12], [17] states. Eigenvalues and relative intensities were evaluated using 297 the PGOPHER software [41]. Simulations were performed by convolving the resulting stick spectra 298 (Fig. 6) with a Gaussian profile. A series of simulated spectra were obtained by varying the full width 299 at half maximum (FWHM) between 10 kHz and 30 MHz. The result of the overall profile was then fitted 300 with a single Gaussian whose center, FWHM and area were adjusted. The differences between the line 301 center of the Gaussian fit and the hfs-free transition frequency are plotted in Fig. 6 versus the FWHM 302 value used for the convolution. It appears that the apparent line center frequency is systematically 303 smaller than the hfs-free transition frequency but the impact is very small for Gaussian widths larger 304 than 1 MHz. The two considered HD lines have a Doppler broadening at 77 K of about 770 MHz making 305 the impact of the hfs on the line profile totally negligible, as could have been expected from the spectral 306 extension of the hfs (on the order of \u00b1200 kHz) compared to the Doppler width. Note that the negligible 307 impact of the hfs and possible associated cross-overs is an advantage for measurements in Doppler 308 regime at low optical power regime. 309 310\nComparison with literature 317 In Figure 7 and Table 2, our (2-0) R(1) transition frequency is compared with the most precise 318 measurements available to date. As mentioned above, the Hefei [26], and Amsterdam [16] values were 319\nobtained in saturation regime while the Caserta value [19] relies on recordings in Doppler regime, as in 320 the present work, but at room temperature. The four determinations are consistent. In particular, our 321 value is only 3 kHz below the identical values measured in Amsterdam and Caserta, a difference about 322 twenty times smaller than the error bars of the Amsterdam and Caserta studies (50 and 76 kHz, 323 respectively). 324\n325\nFIG.7 326 Comparison between the most recent experimental frequencies determination, in MHz, for the R(1) and R(0) 327 transitions of the (2-0) vibrational band of HD. Amsterdam2019 refers to [16], Hefei2020 to [26], Caserta2021 to 328 [19]. References related to measurements in Doppler regime or by saturation spectroscopy are indicated in blue 329 and green, respectively. The origin of the frequency scale is the frequency evaluated theoretically from the 330 H2spectre software detailed in [3] (see Table 2). 331 332\n336 The frequency of the (2-0) R(0) transition is consistent with the previous determination of [12] 337 reported with a 30 MHz uncertainty. The uncertainty value is presently reduced by three orders of 338 magnitude. 339 We have also included in Table 2 the transition frequency provided by theory (values were 340 computed using the H2spectre software detailed in Ref. [3]). These calculated values were used as 341\nfrequency origins in Fig. 7. For both for the R(0) and R(1) transitions, theoretical values are 342 underestimated by about 1.88 MHz, what represents 1.7 times their claimed error bar (1.1 MHz). A 343 similar deviation was already reported for the (2-0) P(1), R(2), R(3) lines measured with sub-MHz 344 accuracy in Doppler-free regime [25], [17]. The mean deviation is of 1.91 MHz with a standard deviation 345 of only 25 kHz for the five transitions, P(1) and R(0-3). 346\nConclusion 347\nThe (2-0) R(0) and R(1) transition frequencies have been determined in Doppler regime with an 348 accuracy of 20 kHz (relative accuracy of about 10-10). This level of accuracy was made possible by 349 combining a very stable and coherent laser source, an absolute calibration of the frequency scale and the 350 sensitivity of the CRDS technique, together with a liquid nitrogen cooled cell. The latter permitted to 351 decrease Doppler transition linewidth and spectra contamination by water lines. 352 Indeed, up to now, the spectral interference with a water line had hampered high accuracy 353 transition frequency measurements of the R(0) transition. The accuracy of the reported R(0) transition 354 frequency represents a gain by three orders of magnitude compared to literature. The analysis of the 355 R(0) line profile benefited of the accurate determination of the transition frequency of the (101)-(000) 356 211-312 interfering line of H216O, from separate recordings performed in saturation regime. A series of 357 247 Lamb dips were recorded, each scan providing a 1.5 kHz accuracy on the Lamb dip center 358 determination. The Allan deviation indicates that the obtained dip centers follow the normal law, the 359 final precision is enhanced to about 100 Hz. This level of accuracy (relative uncertainty of 5\u00d710-13) is at 360 the state-of-the-art for molecular transition frequencies [42], [43], [44]. 361 In the case of the R(1) transition of HD, our accuracy is at the level of the best previous 362 determinations both in saturation regime and in Doppler regime. Note that the only accurate 363 determination in Doppler regime was obtained from room temperature spectra recorded with pressures 364 between 100 and 1500 Pa [19]. The sensitivity of the CRDS set-up used in the present work allowed us 365 to record spectra at a significantly smaller pressure of 2 Pa which simplified the line profile analysis and 366 made the self-pressure shift of the line center almost negligible. 367 The obtained results extend the set of accurate transition frequencies in the first overtone band of 368 HD. The comparison to the most recent theoretical values [3] shows a systematic underestimation of 1.9 369 MHz of the calculated transition frequencies compared to the five accurate values at disposal, P(1) and 370 R(0-3). This observation provides a challenge for future refinement of the non-adiabatic perturbation 371 theory or any other theory applied to HD. 372 373 Conflicts of interest 374 There are no conflicts to declare. 375 376 Acknowledgments 377 S.
