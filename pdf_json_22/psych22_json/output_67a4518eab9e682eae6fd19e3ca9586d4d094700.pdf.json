However, little is known on the perspectives of young people and mental health experts on this rapidly advancing technology. This study aims to investigate the subjective needs, attitudes, and preferences of key stakeholders towards an AI\u2013informed mHealth app, including young people and experts on mHealth promotion and prevention in youth. Methods: We used a convergent parallel mixed\u2013method study design. Two semi\u2013structured online focus groups (n = 8) and expert interviews (n = 5) to explore users and stakeholders perspectives were conducted. Furthermore a representative online survey was completed by young people (n = 666) to investigate attitudes, current use and preferences towards apps for mental health promotion and prevention. Results: Survey results show that more than two-thirds of young people have experience with mHealth apps, and 60% make regular use of 1\u20132 apps. A minority (17%) reported to feel negative about the application of AI in general, and 19% were negative about the embedding of AI in mHealth apps. This is in line with qualitative findings, where young people displayed rather positive attitudes towards AI and its integration into mHealth apps. Participants reported pragmatic attitudes towards data sharing and safety practices, implying openness to share data if it adds value for users and if the data request is not too intimate, however demanded transparency of data usage and control over personalization. Experts perceived AI-informed mHealth apps as a complementary solution to on\u2013site delivered interventions in future health promotion among young people. Experts emphasized opportunities in regard with lowthreshold access through the use of smartphones, and the chance to reach young people in risk situations. Conclusions: The findings of this exploratory study highlight the importance of further participatory development of training components prior to implementation of a digital mHealth training in routine practice of mental health \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health (2022) 16:86 Background Mental illness is the leading cause of disease burden in young people aged 10\u201324  years [1]. Studies show that three\u2013quarters of mental disorders emerge in adolescence, by the age of 24 [2]. Hence, mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention in young people represent important societal responsibilities [3]. Whilst mental health providers offer various therapeutic and advisory services, it is well documented that young individuals have the poorest access to mental health services among all age groups [4]. Research therefore calls for an increase in public mental health interventions to help prevent mental health problems and build resilience in young people [5, 6]. Due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and young peoples\u2019 frequent use of technologies, mobile mental health (mHealth) apps have emerged as a promising way for mental health promotion and prevention in youth [7\u20139]. Especially in times of increased burden like the COVID\u201319 pandemic [10\u201312], studies show that there is an objective need for apps that address prevention and early intervention in youth [13]. Mobile apps come with the advantages of accessibility, ease of use and anonymity [14], but the development of apps appropriate to the needs and preferences of young people is still facing several challenges [15]. Existing apps available in major app stores rarely use evidence\u2013based frameworks [16\u201319], frequently do not involve young people in the development [20], and therefore often remain insufficiently tailored to the needs of young users [4, 20, 21]. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) could pave the way for better personalization and novel approaches of digitization in mental health care [22, 23]. Algorithms may support personalization by collecting multimodal mobile data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and, on this basis, determine predictive (risk) factors, temporal dynamics of mental health trajectories and translating them back into suggestions for behavioral options. EMA encompasses diverse ambulatory assessment techniques (eg, diaries, physiological information) to capture real-time data concerning internal and external cues (eg, situational variables) [24, 25]. EMIs on the other hand are defined by Heron & Smyth as \u201ctreatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (ie, in real time) and in natural settings (ie, real world)\u201d [25], thus including a variety of ambulatory treatment strategies [24, 25]. EMA and EMIs are therefore \u2018ecological\u2019 because they are provided in natural settings and are \u2018momentary\u2019 because they are delivered to users in real-time [25]. Especially the combination of EMIs and EMA with deep learning algorithms may enable mHealth apps to provide effective mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention to users. While EMIs deliver customized training components adjusted by EMA to the person\u2019s current state of health and experienced stress in real time [26, 27], deep learning based algorithms promise improved outcome predictions and more individually tailored selection of intervention components. Employed in mHealth apps for prevention and intervention, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown to forecast depressed mood based on self-reported histories [28]. RNNs are able to adapt to individual behavior through continuous parameter updating, and to optimize the allocation of individual training components via dynamic feedback and learning loops [29, 30]. Apps that use RNNs with EMIs and EMA may therefore allow for more adaptive, real\u2013time, and real\u2013world deployment of interventions in individuals\u2019 daily lives, thus offering a low\u2013threshold mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention tailored to person, moment, and context. Randomized controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of interventions in this novel approach for prevention remain necessary [31\u201333]. Rauschenberg et al. found in an uncontrolled pilot EMI study, that within 3 weeks of using a compassion focused program (including, inter alia, EMA\u2013informed interactive tasks), stress sensitivity, momentary negative affect, and psychotic experiences could be reduced in ten individuals aged 14\u201325 [34]. Although these findings need to be replicated in a well\u2013powered RCT, the study shows promising results. The study also indicated feasibility and safety, including high satisfaction rates, low burden of app usage and no adverse effects in participants [34]. In addition to clinical validation, more research is required in order to explore user perspectives in context of AI-informed (or RNN\u2013based) mHealth apps using EMIs and EMA. In a systematic review, investigating attitudes and perspectives of patients towards clinical artificial intelligence\u2013 defined as \u201cany software made to automate intelligent promotion and prevention. Our results may help to guide developments based on stakeholders\u2019 first recommendations for an AI-informed mHealth app.",

Two semi\u2013structured online focus groups (n = 8) and expert interviews (n = 5) to explore users and stakeholders perspectives were conducted. Furthermore a representative online survey was completed by young people (n = 666) to investigate attitudes, current use and preferences towards apps for mental health promotion and prevention.\nResults: Survey results show that more than two-thirds of young people have experience with mHealth apps, and 60% make regular use of 1\u20132 apps. A minority (17%) reported to feel negative about the application of AI in general, and 19% were negative about the embedding of AI in mHealth apps. This is in line with qualitative findings, where young people displayed rather positive attitudes towards AI and its integration into mHealth apps. Participants reported pragmatic attitudes towards data sharing and safety practices, implying openness to share data if it adds value for users and if the data request is not too intimate, however demanded transparency of data usage and control over personalization. Experts perceived AI-informed mHealth apps as a complementary solution to on\u2013site delivered interventions in future health promotion among young people. Experts emphasized opportunities in regard with lowthreshold access through the use of smartphones, and the chance to reach young people in risk situations.\nConclusions: The findings of this exploratory study highlight the importance of further participatory development of training components prior to implementation of a digital mHealth training in routine practice of mental health\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Mental illness is the leading cause of disease burden in young people aged 10\u201324\u00a0 years [1]. Studies show that three\u2013quarters of mental disorders emerge in adolescence, by the age of 24 [2]. Hence, mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention in young people represent important societal responsibilities [3]. Whilst mental health providers offer various therapeutic and advisory services, it is well documented that young individuals have the poorest access to mental health services among all age groups [4]. Research therefore calls for an increase in public mental health interventions to help prevent mental health problems and build resilience in young people [5, 6]. Due to the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and young peoples\u2019 frequent use of technologies, mobile mental health (mHealth) apps have emerged as a promising way for mental health promotion and prevention in youth [7\u20139]. Especially in times of increased burden like the COVID\u201319 pandemic [10\u201312], studies show that there is an objective need for apps that address prevention and early intervention in youth [13]. Mobile apps come with the advantages of accessibility, ease of use and anonymity [14], but the development of apps appropriate to the needs and preferences of young people is still facing several challenges [15]. Existing apps available in major app stores rarely use evidence\u2013based frameworks [16\u201319], frequently do not involve young people in the development [20], and therefore often remain insufficiently tailored to the needs of young users [4, 20, 21].\nAdvances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) could pave the way for better personalization and novel approaches of digitization in mental health care [22, 23]. Algorithms may support personalization by collecting multimodal mobile data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and, on this basis, determine predictive (risk) factors, temporal dynamics of mental health trajectories and translating them back into suggestions for behavioral options. EMA encompasses diverse ambulatory assessment techniques (eg, diaries, physiological information) to capture real-time data concerning internal and external cues (eg, situational variables) [24, 25]. EMIs on the other hand are defined by Heron & Smyth as \u201ctreatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (ie, in real time) and in natural\nsettings (ie, real world)\u201d [25], thus including a variety of ambulatory treatment strategies [24, 25].\nEMA and EMIs are therefore \u2018ecological\u2019 because they are provided in natural settings and are \u2018momentary\u2019 because they are delivered to users in real-time [25]. Especially the combination of EMIs and EMA with deep learning algorithms may enable mHealth apps to provide effective mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention to users. While EMIs deliver customized training components adjusted by EMA to the person\u2019s current state of health and experienced stress in real time [26, 27], deep learning based algorithms promise improved outcome predictions and more individually tailored selection of intervention components. Employed in mHealth apps for prevention and intervention, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown to forecast depressed mood based on self-reported histories [28]. RNNs are able to adapt to individual behavior through continuous parameter updating, and to optimize the allocation of individual training components via dynamic feedback and learning loops [29, 30]. Apps that use RNNs with EMIs and EMA may therefore allow for more adaptive, real\u2013time, and real\u2013world deployment of interventions in individuals\u2019 daily lives, thus offering a low\u2013threshold mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention tailored to person, moment, and context.\nRandomized controlled trials that investigate the efficacy of interventions in this novel approach for prevention remain necessary [31\u201333]. Rauschenberg et\u00a0al. found in an uncontrolled pilot EMI study, that within 3\u00a0weeks of using a compassion focused program (including, inter alia, EMA\u2013informed interactive tasks), stress sensitivity, momentary negative affect, and psychotic experiences could be reduced in ten individuals aged 14\u201325 [34]. Although these findings need to be replicated in a well\u2013powered RCT, the study shows promising results. The study also indicated feasibility and safety, including high satisfaction rates, low burden of app usage and no adverse effects in participants [34]. In addition to clinical validation, more research is required in order to explore user perspectives in context of AI-informed (or RNN\u2013based) mHealth apps using EMIs and EMA. In a systematic review, investigating attitudes and perspectives of patients towards clinical artificial intelligence\u2013 defined as \u201cany software made to automate intelligent\npromotion and prevention. Our results may help to guide developments based on stakeholders\u2019 first recommendations for an AI-informed mHealth app.\nKeywords: Youth mental health, Mental health promotion and prevention, Mobile health (mhealth), Public mental health, Ecological momentary assessment, Ecological momentary interventions, Artificial intelligence\nbehavior in a health\u2013care setting for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment\u201d [35]\u2013authors concluded that even though patients and the general public conveyed openness towards AI, many reservations as well as a preference for human supervision remained. The authors also highlighted knowledge deficits and participants\u2019 perception of risks and weaknesses of AI (eg, risks to privacy, risks due to self\u2013treatment, data fraud and profit seeking) [35]. Although selection criteria only encompassed tools for AI-informed diagnosis or treatment of patients, close proximity in attitudes towards AI-informed EMI/ EMA apps can be assumed, as they become as deeply entangled in young people\u2019s everyday lives. However, in context of mHealth apps, research on users\u2019 perceptions has primarily focused on apps that don\u2019t rely on machine learning algorithms or the use of multimodal data (eg, in form of EMA, sensor data) [25, 36, 37]. MHealth apps with a more sophisticated technical approach, such as the personalized delivery of intervention components based on AI-involvement, may therefore elicit different concerns and preferences in users.\nAlong with ensuring that mHealth apps are tailored to specific user needs through novel technical approaches, young people should also be involved in the development of mental health apps in order to ensure that their needs are met. Following the International Declaration on Youth Mental Health [38], the participation of young people in the entire development processes of mental health services (eg, mHealth apps) is deemed crucial to make sure that such services are aligned to their understanding of mental health and wellbeing. While participatory research improves the validity and relevance of findings [39], only a few studies fully consider the perspective of young people when developing apps [23, 40, 41]. In addition to the perspectives of young people, experiences and perspectives of other key stakeholders (eg, school psychologists, pedagogues) should also be taken into account, when novel technical approaches in their field of expertise are investigated [42, 43]. The aim of this exploratory study was therefore to inform future participatory app development through first insights in subjective perspectives of young individuals and key stakeholders regarding their concerns, needs, and preferences for an AI-informed mHealth app for mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention and to complete results with a representative sample of young people."

Both focus groups and expert interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Solely\nthe participants and respective facilitators/interviewers attended these meetings. The interviewers had no previous relationship with participants before the study commenced. Field notes were taken before and after data collection by CG and CR.\nFocus groups were held on March 25th and April 16th 2020 and lasted approximately 1.5\u00a0 h. Each focus group was led by scientific team members with experience in facilitating focus groups (facilitator: CG; co\u2013facilitator: CR). Semi\u2013structured topic guides were used (see Additional file\u00a0 1). After a short introduction round (1), participants were asked about their understanding of mental health and what they already do to promote theirs (2). We asked participants if they had already used mHealth apps for this purpose. Depending on their level of knowledge, CR explained the project\u2019s definition of mHealth apps:\n\u201cHealth apps are apps that can help you deal better with everyday stress and worries, support you to be more physically active or allow you to work on or monitor your habits/behaviors (eg, your sleep quality, exercise).\"\nSubsequently, the use of AI in everyday life and the young peoples\u2019 knowledge about it was explored (3) followed by a short presentation about the concept of mHealth apps and RNNs in the planned app. The cofacilitator also described some of the basic information about EMIs and EMA to participants of the focus groups. After providing feedback on the planned app and possible concerns (4), young people were asked to provide recommendations and suggest desirable functionalities of the app, and whether they were interested in further participation (5).\nExpert interviews were conducted online between March 18th and April 30th 2020 by CG & CR. All expert interviews lasted between 1 and 1.5\u00a0 h. We used semi\u2013 structured topic guides (see Additional file\u00a0 2). Themes addressed (1) mental health promotion in the experts\u2019 professional context, (2) relevance of apps in mental health, (3) opportunities, limits, and concerns regarding the planned mHealth app, and (4) opportunities for further participation for practitioners. In advance, experts were briefed during a steering committee meeting about the planned mHealth app. Here, all of its relevant functions were explained and the use of EMIs and EMA briefly discussed."

Therefore, non\u2013commercial providers should engage in app development as well as to:\n\u201c\u2026pick up on this trend, the power that is in there and use it productively and maybe leave out a few things that you would do if you were to use it as a business idea, which should then be highly profitable.\u201d[EXP3]\nHowever, two mHealth experts reported few to no mentions of apps in communication with colleagues or young people (2/2). Yet the current COVID\u201319 pandemic was seen as an opportunity for change [EXP4, EXP5]."

Participants reported the usage of sports and fitness apps (eg, \u201cAdidas Sport App\u201d, \u201cFreeletics\u201d; 3/8), meditation and mindfulness apps (\"Calm\", \"Waking Up,\" \u201cHeadspace\", etc.; 3/8), apps for sleep optimization (\"Sleep Cycle\" and others; 2/8), and nutrition apps\n(\u201cMy\u2013Fitness\u2013Call\u201d; 1/8). This is in line with the survey results where more than two\u2013thirds of young people reported to have experience with such apps (only 30% never used one).\nAmong survey participants who already had experiences with mHealth apps, 60% make regular use (at least once a week) of 1\u20132 apps, however 29% indicated to use none of their installed mHealth apps regularly. We also presented a selection of common app content or exercises to those who reported to regularly use mHealth apps (n = 473). Surprisingly, among these users, \u201cnever utilized\u201d was selected most often (on average in 27% of cases) compared to the other answer options. Nevertheless, apps that promote physical activity or apps that track physiological data (eg, one\u2019s heart rate) were rather common among existing app users. Less popular were apps with a diary options, apps that support stress management or relaxation/mediation apps. More details are shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nYoung people in focus groups reported that they had used an mHealth app at least once (7/8) or more frequently over a short period of time (6/8), but had stopped the use of most apps. For 2 participants, this happened due to reaching their \u201cgoal\u201d. Half of the focus group participants highlighted high costs or payment models as reasons, and for 2 participants their use ended with the free testing period of the app. In other cases, either the app was assessed to be unsuitable to reach the goal because it was too unreliable (2/8). For example, the alarm of a sleep cycle app did not go off, or the use was too demanding (3/8). For the latter, one participant stated concerning a nutrition app:\n\u201cI don\u2019t use it very often, I only used it once or twice just to see how I eat during the day ...\u201d [P3, FG2] \u201cBut you did stop at some point?\u201d [Facilitator, CG] P3, FG2: \u201cYes, exactly, because it is very exhausting to go through this every day \u2026to keep listing the products there.\u201d[P3, FG2]\nIn stressful periods (eg, final exams) 3 out of 8 focus group participants made use of mHealth apps. Two young people used mHealth apps for habit tracking (eg, to control eating habits or to self\u2013organize)."

Of course I don\u2019t know the technical background, but what I imagine is that if you give an input, the system learns\u201c[P1, FG2]\nAI usage was linked to application areas such as social media (2/8), shopping (2/8), and personalized advertising (2/8). Young people also mentioned online translators (eg, google translate) or the internet of things (eg, temperature control).\nMost participants had a positive attitude towards AI use in general (6/8). They reported a pragmatic approach towards AI and data usage, which implied sharing data and use mHealth apps as long as the app was useful to them. One participant elaborated:\n\u201cI think there are two sides to this. I find it...scary, if you do not yet know exactly what is happening with your data\u2026. On the other hand, I think it\u2019s great when I go to...Spotify \u2018your mix of the week\u2019\nand I kind of like all the songs.... [As] long as I somehow benefit from it and know that my data is safe\u2026, then I actually think that\u2019s good and I\u2019m positive about it.\u201d[P4, FG2].\nUneasiness about the opacity of machine learning processes was mentioned rather casually (6/8) and was often associated with popular media, especially science fiction movies (eg, \u201cTerminator\u201d [P2, FG1]). However, both focus groups came to the conclusion that regulations and control mechanisms for AI are necessary (8/8)."

Similarly, in the online survey, only a minority (17%) reported to feel negative about the application of AI in general, and 19% negative about the embedding of AI in mHealth apps.\nIn focus group 1, the combination of a great variety of interventions, and the possibility to tailor the app to one\u2019s personal needs to find \u201cyour own path\u201d was especially desirable for one participant [P2]. Similarly, other young persons (4/8) highlighted the advantage of personalization due to the AI elements:\n\u201cYes, I think that in the area of mental health or health in general it could work pretty well to use such artificial intelligence, because\u2026everyone is super individual and of course it works better if it is well adjusted to each person.\u201c [FG1_S].\nAt this point, 5 out of 8 young people stated that they have few concerns in sharing information with the app. Participants justified broad data usage, especially if the app is useful to solve user\u2013defined problems. Two young people argued that their smartphone already gathers many personal data, thus sharing more information was no major concern to them:\n\u201cWhen I think about it, my cell phone probably already knows so much about me anyway, because it is somewhere nearby all the time...that I would maybe give more information than others.\u201d [P2, FG1]\nAsking which information participants were willing to provide in order to improve tailoring and functionality of AI (given all guidelines being followed), youth in the survey mostly agreed to share information like steps taken per day, physiological data (eg, heart rate), or sleep behavior, for example day/night rhythm or duration of sleep (see Fig.\u00a02). At the same time, a majority of young persons disagreed to share real\u2013life conversations or the recording of surrounding or ambient noises, as well as to the analysis of text or text length of messages that have been sent.\nDuring focus groups, young people also expressed reservations about AI\u2019s use of \u201cpersonal\u201d data, such as diagnoses (\u201capp should not replace the doctor\u201d [P2, FG2]) or one\u2019s deeper feelings and thoughts. One male participant stated that he would share the level of stress he had but not the reason for the distress itself, like something he would put in a diary [P2, FG1]. Doubts were also expressed about the app\u00b4s functionality and ability to comprise more profound concepts (eg, melancholic feelings, thoughts about meaning in life, problems with friends or family). One male participant was skeptical about the app\u2019s ability to grasp deeply entangled emotional problems and to give adequate answers [P4, FG1].\nReluctance to share personal information was linked to trustworthiness of the app producers (4/8), where non\u2013 commercial providers were trusted more, compared to providers with financial interests. This is in line with survey results, where only 20% deemed it very important to know who developed the app, while 23% were indifferent and 15% deemed it unimportant. Two\u2013thirds of young people reported to have greatest trust towards independent research institutions (e.g., universities or hospitals) when compared to health insurance, state institutions, or companies such as \u201cGoogle\u201d. The latter and other companies with a potential commercial interest where trusted the least (see Fig.\u00a03).\nYoung people in our online survey reported barriers for the use of mHealth apps including lacking motivation and costs for the app itself, while a majority assessed feeling worse than before, difficulties in handling the app or losing personal contact with real\u2013life friends as \u2018no barrier to usage\u2019 (see Fig.\u00a04)."

Similarly positive was the experts\u2019 view on the potential for better\u2013informed recommendations (2/5), resulting in a high applicability of the app in counseling and school centers (3/5). However, 2 experts stressed that the app should be connected to mental\nhealth counseling facilities in order to inform users about nearby professional services [EXP1, EXP5]. Especially in cases of suicidality, the app should include further measures for risk reduction and enable access to further help for those in need (2/5). For some experts the app may serve as a supplement to face\u2013to\u2013face interventions or counseling services (2/5). By empowering young people to take care of their mental health themselves, the app has the potential to close existing treatment gaps in mental health promotion and prevention for youths with minor mental health problems.\nFrom experts\u2019 perspectives, interventions of the planned app should provide \u201cknowledge transfer\u201d, for example to empower young people to realize how actions, feelings and thoughts are intertwined (2/5). Further recommendations included the promotion of \u201cself\u2013 acceptance\u201d / \u201cself\u2013worth\u201d (2/5), \u201cphysical activity\u201d (2/5), \u201csocial skills\u201d (2/5), and \u201cemotion regulation\u201d, for example getting access to one\u2019s feelings (2/5). Young peoples\u2019 motivation to use the mHealth app might be increased by \u201cgiving stories / everyday examples\u201d (3/5), tailored tips and ideas for specific situations (3/5), the initiation of self\u2013reflection (2/5) or interventions to experience self\u2013 efficacy (2/5). One expert emphasized that several youth studies underlined that communication with peers was essential for young people in internet activities, thus the option to communicate with other young people should be included in the app to ensure a continuous use [EXP3].\nExperts\u2019 concerns about the app were mostly related to not being able to reach or motivate young people for the\napps\u2019 training (3/5). Furthermore, experts underlined that various barriers for the implementation of the app need to be taken into account, such as structural obstacles, for example prejudices of school officials against mHealth apps (2/5) or persisting lack of technical equipment in schools (2/5). They reported possible negative influences in enforcing digital media overuse [EXP5] and, given the continuous pressure to self\u2013optimize, empowering potentially problematic \u201cperfect\u201d self\u2013images [EXP3]. Based on the recommendation of one psychologist, the app should therefore not arouse false expectations in young people:\n\u201cI would see a risk if the app claimed: \u2018if you go through these ten steps...then you are a different person\u2019 (laughs). ...A good app would be characterized by the fact that the user does not internalize a problem centered perspective, but that he...gets the feeling: \u2018I am okay\u2019.\u201d [EXP5]\nRecommendations for\u00a0AI\u2013informed mHealth apps with\u00a0EMA/EMIs"

Or as one participant stated:\n\u201c...you have a lot of apps that can promote health, but you have to find the one app that suits you best ..., it\u2019s actually exactly the other way around [with the planned app; CG], so that you have an app,... that can indicate the various routes to you....That\u2019s pretty handy.\u201d [P2, FG1]\nPersonalized personalization\u2013App includes users in\u00a0 AI decision making process All young people demanded control over the degree of personalization through AI (8/8). One participant therefore proposed the concept of \u201cpersonalized personalization\u201d [P1, FG2], which means to be able to self\u2013determine the time and degree of further personalization, ideally at the beginning of the app use. Also, young persons demanded flexibility and the possibility to change those settings retrospectively (2/8), for example to be able to receive suggestions for exercises once again, even after dismissing them initially (allowing for development or a change of mind).\nApp gives recommendations when\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s smart enough\u201d Participants had concerns about imprecise or bad suggestions of the AI especially at the beginning of app use, due to a lack of data and therefore insufficient tailoring of the app. Thus, 2 participants proposed that AI should come into use only when sufficient personalization was reached to avoid imprecise suggestions (2/8):\n\u201c\u2026when I\u2019m still at the beginning, the app doesn\u2019t know much about me yet, but it still gives me suggestions .... And then I tend to distance myself from the app\u2026because it simply suggests things that I don\u2019t need at all. So, I think...that it would be really cool if this AI only came in at a certain point in time, when it is smart, or when it\u2019s smart enough to step in.\u201d[P3, FG2]\nApp suggests solutions for\u00a0 difficult situations Besides having a set of exercises at hand to volitionally practice certain aspects of mHealth, participants underlined the importance of tailored solutions (eg, a help button) in difficult moments of not feeling well (4/8).\n\u201c...but that you have such a button...where it says, no idea, \u2018help me\u2019...and then ...get the whole thing rolling.\u201d [P2, FG1]\nFor others, this could also mean to receive suggestions for activities in times of inactivity\u2013which could be measured by passive data (eg, steps taken per day)\u2013and for example to receive suggestions to meet up with friends (2/8).\nApp suggests distance to\u00a0 mobile phone Crucial feature of the app for young people was the encouragement to refrain from the use of mobile phones (2/8). One young person especially stressed distance from social media, as precursor of stress and competitive behavior [P3, FG1].\n\u201e I think if an app like this gets you to turn off your cell phone and do breathing exercises, or some\nsport...and takes you away from it a bit, then I think it\u2019s very helpful, even though it\u2019s \u2018just another app\u2019.\" [P1, FG1]\nMutual trainings or\u00a0 sharing trainings with\u00a0 others rarely desired 7 out of 8 participants stated at some point that they exercise for themselves and not \u201cfor others\". Therefore, 5 out of 8 young people preferred not to share training sessions or outcomes with acquaintances or other app users, for example to avoid competitive behavior (3/8). Especially the public posting of achievements via the app was deemed undesirable (5/8), whereas the one\u2013on\u2013one exchange with close friends or family was considered acceptable by some (2/8).\nReasonable time requirements for\u00a0app usage Given the rationale of proper time management, participants raised concerns about the effort of app usage and time required for the personalization of the app as well as the amount of exercised the app recommends:\n\u201eWhen you have to fill out super long stuff,...then it might annoy me at some point, if it is a lengthy process.\u201c [P3, FG2]\nImportant aspects of\u00a0mHealth apps for\u00a0survey participants With respect to important aspects of the app (see Fig.\u00a05), young people considered the \u201ccomprehensibility of app content\u201d (84%), \u201cquality and helpfulness of training\u201d (82%), and the \u201cpossibility for personal goal setting\u201d (79%) as important or very important. Compared to the other aspects, the chance for comparison with other users was deemed the least important aspect in an mHealth app."

This could mean to put special emphasis on \u201crisk groups\u201d (eg, socially disadvantaged young people, or young people displaying behavioral problems), which may have different needs concerning processes and structures of interventions (EXP4).\nTarget group\u2013specific language In terms of language editing, experts underlined to ensure that formal information (eg, use of data, data protection) was comprehensible. Thus not only to comply with the \u201cclear and plain language\u201d required by GDPR, but also \u201cto formulate the terms and conditions in simple language, that anyone can understand\u201d [EXP3]. Additionally, this should imply\nconveying \u201cacceptance\u201d or \u201caffirmation\u201d within texts (eg, that it takes time to perform an exercise, to practice at one\u2019s own pace) rather than taking a problem\u2013centered approach [EXP3, EXP5].\nForwarding young people to\u00a0counseling centers According to experts, the app should be able to connect young people with helpful contacts in their vicinity (eg, suicide hotlines, counseling services, trust teachers) and facilitate the structured search for professional help [EXP1, EXP 5]. Thus, the app may reach risk groups at an early stage, when they are not yet likely to attend counseling or search for clinical support yet.\nLow\u2013threshold access to\u00a0potentially endangered young people Two experts highlighted the risk of triggering self\u2013 harming behavior or suicidality through app usage [EXP1, EXP 5], but emphasized that the planned app could also mean an early, low\u2013threshold access to potentially endangered young people. One expert therefore recommended\nthe careful phrasing of questions and exercises, but also stressed that suicidality and suicide ideation were often hard to recognize in counseling as well [EXP5]:\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as in counseling\u2026It\u2019s never clear how things will proceed and if we are very careful there...we may reach someone at a point in time when they are at risk and use the app to get them to open up somehow, to turn them around.\u201d [EXP5]\nCareful framing of\u00a0 AI technology Two experts raised concerns on a widespread lack of knowledge and the risk of limited acceptance of AI\u2013informed technology. Due to false \u201cdystopian\u201d imaginations of AI\u2013technology, there might be persisting reservations especially in Germany [EXP4], why an exceedingly strong focus on AI in the app could lead to reactance [EXP2]. As a counter\u2013measure, it was stressed to lay emphasis on its benefits, for example tailored offers made possible through AI, and to guarantee as much transparency as possible [EXP2]."

            "text": "The aim of this study was to explore attitudes, preferences and needs of young people towards AI\u2013informed mHealth apps, together with those of crucial stakeholders in the field of mental health, to guide the further development of an app using EMA and EMIs (see Table\u00a0 3). Qualitative findings concerning the individual perspectives of young people and stakeholders were complemented through survey results about young people\u2019s current use of mHealth apps. We found that participating young people and experts were mostly open\u2013minded towards the use of AI, as well as its implementation in an mHealth app. Results of qualitative and quantitative data are largely consistent, revealing that app content, functionality and the opportunity for personalization are the most important components for use in mHealth apps.\nYoung people\u2019s views on\u00a0AI\u2011informed mHealth apps In general, the results of our survey show that most young people already use mHealth apps in a broader sense (eg, to increase physical activity), and the majority can imagine using them to promote their mental health (eg, to deal with stress, reflection of one\u2019s own behavior). For our survey participants, the most important aspects seem to be quality and effectiveness of the mHealth app, followed by comprehensible content and ease of use. Personal goal setting seems to be an additional important feature of an mHealth app, which is in line with the desired app functionality, described in focus groups. In contrast, the possibility to compare one\u2019s progress with others was deemed the least important aspect for continuous app use among participants, in both focus groups and online survey. Besides control over information sharing, also time\u2013consuming app usage seemed to be a decisive factor that would prevent our survey participants from using mHealth apps. We see similar attitudes in focus groups, where young people raised concerns about lengthy processes of data entry for personalization or general effort of app usage. This is in line with earlier studies, where a high sampling frequency (ie, seven triggered signals a day on six consecutive days) was perceived as burdensome by young people [34] or connected to lower compliance and retention rates in participants [55]. Vachon et\u00a0 al. recommended in a meta\u2013analysis of EMA studies investigating major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder, to decrease the number of evaluations per day and use bigger time intervals between successive evaluations, in order to increase compliance in participants [55]. Other usage barriers mentioned by young people in focus groups, who had used mHealth apps before, were costs for the app itself, which lead to an end of usage after the free\u2013trial period. The same was mentioned by survey participants. Notably, focus group participants described a problem\u2013centered approach to the use of mHealth apps (if they used them at all), implying usage only during stressful periods (eg, exams) or when to achieve a certain predefined goal (eg, improved sleep quality). After reaching the goal, the app often had fulfilled its purpose and became irrelevant. To reach a continuous use in young people, it seems advisable not only to center the app around one \u201cproblem\u201d or \u201cgoal\u201d, but to keep the app flexible and adjustable to changing life situations, thus becoming a constant companion with trainings for ever\u2013changing settings.\nAlthough young people in our study show insecurities and a lack of (deeper) knowledge regarding the technical background of AI, they seem to be familiar with the central mechanisms or keywords (eg, terms like \u201cmachine learning\u201d or \u201calgorithms\u201d). This is in line with findings of Young et\u00a0 al., where participants were familiar with AI in general, but not with AI in a clinical setting, and mostly linked AI to cognition (eg, in games), machines or applications (eg, robots, Google, Spotify), and to popular media (eg, movies) [35]. Young people in our study had a rather positive\u2013pragmatic attitude towards the use of an AI\u2013informed mHealth app. Participants\u2019 willingness to make use of the AI\u2013 informed training was high, as long as it was useful and the potential to reach personal goals was given. Similarly, young people showed pragmatic attitudes towards data sharing: Qualitative as well as quantitative results demonstrate that the greatest commitment arises when data is provided for research (eg, universities as app providers) or optimization purposes (eg, for better tailoring and functionality of AI), rather than"

At the same time, reasonable explanations for the required data collection and the credibility of the provider seem to be the most decisive factors when it comes to data disclosure. However, besides plausibility of data requests, positive attitudes towards data sharing turned out to decline with increasing intimacy of the data requests. In our survey as well as our focus groups, young people were not willing to give permission for analyzing text messages or tracking real life conversations, fearing data loss, the inaptitude of AI to process data of this complexity, or a general discomfort in sharing personal thoughts with anyone. Yet for some young persons this was also negotiable, as long as there were good reasons for such data queries resulting in benefits for users. Especially with regard to data security, transparency and justification for information requests seemed crucial.\nExperts\u2019 views on\u00a0AI\u2013informed mHealth apps for\u00a0young people Similar to young people, experts have shown largely positive attitudes towards the use of AI methods and highlighted the chances of AI involvement rather than its risks. Experts emphasized that an AI\u2013informed mHealth app has the chance to reach young people in moments when help is needed most, with measures adopted to young peoples\u2019 specific needs. Yet experts also underlined that future mHealth apps should integrate options of forwarding young people to face\u2013to\u2013 face support (eg, by referring to counselling services nearby), to ensure support in emergency situations. This is in line with earlier findings, in which attitudes of physicians and psychotherapists were investigated and mHealth interventions were viewed as a supplement to conventional face\u2013to\u2013face interventions rather than being effective on their own [56, 57]. This skepticism is also reflected in the experts\u2019 recommendation of careful formulations and contact options with respect to levels of suicide ideation [58] in cases of suicidal thoughts or self\u2013harming behaviors, that might be triggered through questions or phrases used in the app. This demand was similarly raised by young people, given that they would like to see a \u201chelp\u2013me\u201d button in the app. Apart from such a button, young people did not mention suicidality or self\u2013harm, which might be due to focus group recruitment of young people from the general population without known experiences of mental health conditions, including suicidal behavior or thoughts."

Firstly two experts disliked the term \u201cmental health\u201d due to negative connotations and semantic proximity to \u2018mental illness\u2019. They preferred the term \u201cmental fitness\u201d and \u201cmental health training\u201d in order to broaden the appeal of the planned app and to reach more young people. However, none of the young people criticized or rejected the term \u201cmental health\u201d in focus groups. This may reflect a change in attitudes concerning mental health in younger generations, resulting in a greater openness towards engaging in or speaking about one\u2019s mental health or wellbeing. Further research with young people has to determine which term fits best, in order to achieve broad acceptance amongst the target group. Secondly, in contrast to young people, one expert highlighted the importance of interaction with peers via the app. From this perspective, young people mainly use the internet for communication purposes (eg, for social media, general messenger apps). However, young people in focus groups and our survey stressed that they did not want to communicate with peers in the context of an mHealth app (with few exceptions), mainly because they feared comparison, peer pressure or competition. Preferences of young people therefore point into the direction of a solitary app use. This is in line with results of Peng et\u00a0al. who also pointed out that users rarely wanted to share personal information due to privacy or security concerns, or because sharing might fuse social competition [59]. Only full control with whom information was shared made sharing with small groups of individuals acceptable [59]."

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this mixed\u2013method study is the first to provide an opportunity for young people and relevant stakeholders to be involved in the first step of the development process of an AI\u2013informed mHealth app delivering EMIs. With respect to sample size, the number of participants in qualitative data collection was relatively small and due to the snowball system procedure in recruitment, the focus groups posed real\u2013life groups. This may be the reason for a lack in controversial debates and a communication style characterized by turn\u2013taking in answering questions. This may also be influenced by the online format that was due to first quarantine measures, where occasional problems with connectivity and overlapping audio occurred. Most participants also held or pursued a higher educational degree, which may account for better knowledge and less skepticism\nabout technology. Future studies should include more diverse participants as well as conduct a greater number of focus groups. However, due to narrowly defined objectives and a homogeneous study population, exploratory qualitative results allowed for in\u2013depth discussion, while the quantitative, representative data helped to form generalizability. Though a description of AI components in the planned app was given in qualitative and quantitative research, the perspectives of young people with lived experience and usage of the planned app may differ from those included in our study, which only had hypothetical scenarios to refer to. Increased experience with AI\u2013informed mHealth tools may change young peoples\u2019 attitudes and young people may become more comfortable with their usage and sharing of information. Experts also mostly addressed AI in the specific version discussed in the steering committee meeting (involving EMA & EMIs). Due to recruitment of experts from the steering committee and affiliation with the project, as well as the main expertise of experts in mental health promotion and prevention of young people (eg, school counseling), experts mostly followed the approach presented at the steering meeting. Expert opinions with a higher expertise in mHealth apps or AI may therefore differ. Furthermore, all experts agreed to the argumentation of the project concerning the better tailoring to the needs of young people and therefore having a lower\u2013threshold access to youth at risk of mental health problems. Though this argument is valid due to former research of the authors [32, 34], and despite that some studies found that online help\u2013seeking was not influenced by socioeconomic status (eg, with lower formal education) [60, 61], future research should particularly include young people with a low socioeconomic status, because their experience and perception of AI\u2013informed mHealth apps may differ."

            "text": "There is a plethora of mHealth apps available in app stores that rarely use evidence\u2013based frameworks or lack tailoring to the specific needs and interests of youth. AI\u2013informed mHealth apps that utilize EMIs and EMA may pave the way for low\u2013threshold interventions that allow for tailored mental health promotion and prevention with respect to person, moment, and context. Though further studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness, our findings point towards general acceptance and interest in AI\u2013informed mHealth apps by young persons and experts working in routine practice of mental health promotion and prevention (eg, school psychologists, social workers, educators). Results highlight a pragmatic use of mHealth apps by young people, who show openness to AI but prefer personalization of all app processes, including the chance\nto determine the degree of personalization itself. Also positive attitudes towards data sharing with an AI based mHealth app tended to decrease with the level of intimacy of the data requested (eg, \u201csteps taken\u201d were more acceptable to share than \u201ctracking of real-life conversations\u201d). Our findings show, that the possibility of personalization (eg, to determine one\u2019s goals and the app\u2019s purpose) bears high relevance for data sharing and long\u2013term app usage in young people. To further promote a continuous use of mHealth interventions, developers should aim for user\u2013centered approaches on mobile applications with EMIs & EMA, evaluating users\u2019 perspectives towards AI\u2013informed components and necessary design features that support adherence. In particular, our findings underline the necessity of collaborative research with young people and their early involvement in decision\u2013making processes during app development. First insights from this mixed-methods approach, which poses a pre-stage of participation, will therefore be used to inform the next stages of the project, especially to implement early on participation of young people in all stages of the research process (e.g. data collection, analysis, interpretation). Considering young people\u2019s currently poor access to mental health services and tenuous use of mHealth apps, this may guide the development of helpful applications that young people may use more regularly.\nAbbreviations AI4U: Artificial Intelligence for personalized digital mental health promotion and prevention in youth; BW: Baden\u2013Wuerttemberg; EMA: Ecological momentary assessment; EMI: Ecological momentary intervention; GDPR: General data protection regulation; RNN: Recurrent neural networks; mHealth: Mobile mental health; mHealth apps: Mobile mental health apps.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13034- 022- 00522-6.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Interview topic guide\u2013focus groups.\nAdditional file\u00a02: Interview topic guide\u2013expert interviews.\nAdditional file\u00a03: Online survey.\nAdditional file\u00a04: Overview of participants in the qualitative study.\nAdditional file\u00a05: COREQ-Checklist.\nAdditional file\u00a06: Coding Trees.\nAcknowledgements We want wish to thank the \u201cDiversity Coach Program\u201d of the Youth Foundation, BW, for attempts to supporting our recruitments of focus groups.
