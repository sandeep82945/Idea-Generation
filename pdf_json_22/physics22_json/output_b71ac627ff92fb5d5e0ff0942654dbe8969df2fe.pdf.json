However, the heterostructure is metallic with a nonzero longitudinal conductance, which contradicts the common belief that quantized Hall conductance is usually observed in insulators. In this work, we systematically study the surface transport of the semi-magnetic topological insulator with both gapped and gapless Dirac surfaces in the presence of dephasing process. In particular, we reveal that the HQHC is directly related to the half-quantized chiral current along the edge of a strongly dephasing metal. The Hall conductance keeps a half-quantized value for large dephasing strengths, while the longitudinal conductance varies with Fermi energies and dephasing strengths. Furthermore, we evaluate both the conductance and resistance as a function of the temperature, which is consistent with the experimental results. Our results not only provide the microscopic transport mechanism of the HQHC, but also are instructive for the probe of the HQHC in future experiments.\nPACS numbers: Keywords:\nIntroduction.\u2014 The investigation of the Dirac fermions is an important paradigm in modern condensed matter physics [1\u20139]. Fundamentally, a single two-dimensional (2D) massive Dirac cone exhibits a hallmark halfquantized Hall conductance (HQHC) [1\u20133], which plays an essential role in formulating various topological effects [10\u201312]. Typical examples of this include quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect proposed by Haldane, topological magnetoelectric effect in axion insulators and topological valley currents in 2D materials [5, 10\u201312]. So far, many theoretical and experimental efforts have been exerted to observe the HQHC, but the direct observation of the HQHC remains elusive [13\u201320]. First, that\u2019s because the Dirac fermions of opposite chirality always appear in pairs in realistic systems according to fermion doubling theory [21]. More importantly, unlike the integer QAH effect that supports dissipationless chiral edge modes, a single 2D massive Dirac cone does not possess topologically protected edge states and thus the mechanism of the HQHC goes beyond conventional paradigm of quantized transport.\nVery recently, a breakthrough is made to the experimental observation of the HQHC in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) heterostructure [22]. The semimagnetic TI heterostructure consists of a single massive Dirac cone on the top surface and a massless Dirac cone on the bottom surface [see Fig. 1(a)] and thus it manifests as a metal in the transport measurement. It is found that the Hall and longitudinal resistance that directly measured in the experiment are non-quantized. Surpris-\ningly, by converting the resistance into the conductance, the Hall conductance is half-quantized in such a metallic phase, where the longitudinal conductance is nonzero. This is in stark contrast to the common belief that quantized Hall conductance is generally observed in an insulating phase such as the QAH effect [5]. Until now, the microscopic mechanism for the HQHC in such a metallic heterostructure is unclear.\nIn this Letter, we uncover that the HQHC originates from a half-quantized chiral current propagating along the edge of a strongly dephasing metal, which we called classical metal. To be specific, we study the surface transport of the semi-magnetic TI in the presence of dephasing process by Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula. It is found that the the Hall conductance \u03c3xy arrives at a half-quantized plateau when dephasing strength exceeds a critical value, whereas the longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx is nonzero. Further, we show that the difference of transmission coefficients td along the edge of the sample is half-quantized and independent of dephasing strength, giving rise to a robust half-quantized chiral edge current. Then, by establishing an analytic relation between \u03c3xy and td, we reveal that the half-quantized td can lead to the HQHC in the classical metal limit, where the system size is much larger than the phase coherent length. To compare with the experimental results [22], we calculate the Hall and longitudinal conductance at low temperature. It is show that \u03c3xy remains half-quantized regardless of temperature while \u03c3xx monotonically increases with the temperature, which is consistent with the experimental results. ar X iv :2 20 1. 12 60\n0v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 9\nJa n\n20 22\n2 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 40 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 0 \u03c3 x y(e 2 /h )\nE F\n\u0393 v = 0 . 5 \u0393 v = 4 . 0 \u0393 v = 1 . 0 \u0393 v = 6 . 0 \u0393 v = 2 . 0 \u0393 v = 8 . 0\n2 4 6 8 1 000 . 0 2 . 0 4 . 0 6 . 0 8 . 0\n1 0 . 0\n\u03c3 x x(e\n2 /h )\n\u0393 v\nE F = 0 . 0 5 E F = 0 . 3 0 E F = 0 . 1 0 E F = 0 . 3 5 E F = 0 . 2 0\n0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 40 . 00 . 0 2 . 0 4 . 0 6 . 0 8 . 0 \u03c3 x x(e 2 /h )\nE F\n\u0393 v = 0 . 5 \u0393 v = 6 . 0 \u0393 v = 1 . 0 \u0393 v = 8 . 0 \u0393 v = 2 . 0 \u0393 v = 4 . 0\n2 4 6 8 1 00\n0 . 5\n1 . 5\n0 . 0\n1 . 0\n\u03c3 x y(e\n2 /h )\n\u0393 v\nE F = 0 . 0 5 E F = 0 . 3 0 E F = 0 . 1 0 E F = 0 . 3 5 E F = 0 . 2 0\n( a )\n( c )\n( e )\n( d )\n( b )\n( f )\nT I\nFIG. 1: (Color online). (a) Schematic plot of a semi-magnetic TI with a gapped Dirac cone on the top surface and a gapless Dirac cone on the bottom surface, where the red arrows indicate the magnetization on the top surface. (b) Schematic plot of a six-terminal Hall-bar device, where the red balls represent the sites attached virtual leads. The distance of two nearest balls is 4. (c) and (d) illustrate the Hall conductance \u03c3xy and the longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx against Fermi energy EF for different dephasing strengths \u0393v, respectively. (e) and (f) illustrate \u03c3xy and \u03c3xx against \u0393v for different EF , respectively. Here, Nx = 640, Ny = 153, Nz = 5, nx = 160, ny = 39, nz = 2, and the distance between lead 5 and 6 is L = 40. The model parameters are fixed as A = 1.0, B = 0.6, M0 = 1.0 and Mz = 0.4.\nModel Hamiltonian and dephasing.\u2014We consider a semi-magnetic TI heterostructure shown in Fig. 1(a). The four-band effective Hamiltonian is H = H0 + HM , where\nH0(k) = \u2211\ni=x,y,z\nAki\u03c3x\u2297si + (M0 \u2212Bk2)\u03c3z\u2297s0\ndescribes the isotropic 3D TI [6], with model parameters A, B, and M0. \u03c3i and si are Pauli matrices for the orbital and spin degrees of freedom, respectively. HM = M(z)\u03c30\u2297sz is the Zeeman splitting, where M(z) takes the valueMz on the top surface, and zero elsewhere. When 0 < M0 < 4B, the 3D TI material is topologically nontrivial, and then it has a single gapless Dirac cone on each surface. Due to the Zeeman splitting HM , an Dirac gap \u2206 = 2Mz is opened up on the top surface, giving rise to a gapped Dirac cone with the HQHC. Therefore, the semi-magnetic TI hosts a gapped Dirac cone and a gapless Dirac cone on the top and bottom surfaces, re-\nspectively [see Fig. 1(a)]. Note that numerical results, calculated by using a real-space Kubo formula [23, 24], demonstrate that the Hall conductance from the top surface of the semi-magnetic TI is half-quantized when the Fermi energy EF is tuned the Dirac gap [25]. This coincides with the above analysis.\nTo investigate the surface transport of a six-terminal Hall-bar device [see Fig. 1(b)], we discretize the Hamiltonian H into Nx \u00d7 Ny \u00d7 Nz cubic lattice sites. The dephasing process is simulated by using nx \u00d7 ny and nx \u00d7 nz Bu\u0308ttiker\u2019s virtual leads on the bottom and side surfaces, respectively [25\u201328]. According to LandauerBu\u0308ttiker formula, the current in the lead p can be expressed as:\nIp = e2\nh\n\u2211 q 6=p (TqpVp \u2212 TpqVq) (1)\nwhere Vp is the voltage in the lead p. Tpq(EF ) = Tr[\u0393pG r\u0393qG a] is the transmission coefficient from the lead q to the lead p, where the linewidth function \u0393p = i ( \u03a3rp \u2212\u03a3r\u2020p ) and the Green\u2019s function Gr = [Ga]\u2020 =\n[EF I\u2212Hcen\u2212 \u2211 p \u03a3 r p] \u22121. \u03a3rp is the retarded self-energy due to the coupling to the lead p and Hcen is the lattice Hamiltonian of the semi-magnetic TI. For real leads (p = 1, 2, ..., 6), \u03a3rp = \u2212i\u0393p2 Ip, where Ip is 4np \u00d7 4np unit matrix and np is the number of the sites coupling to the real lead p. For virtual leads, \u03a3rp = \u2212i\u0393v2 , where \u0393v is the dephasing strength [28]. When the longitudinal current Ix flows from lead 1 to 4, the Hall resistance Rxy = (V2 \u2212 V6)/Ix and longitudinal resistance Rxx = (V2 \u2212 V3)/Ix are obtained via Eq. (1). Because the current only flow along the gapless surfaces (two side and one bottom surfaces), one can get \u03c1xy = Rxy, and \u03c1xx = Rxx/(L/W ). Here, L is the length between lead 2 and 3, and W = (Ny + 2(Nz \u2212 1) \u2212 1) is the total width of the gapless surfaces. The longitudinal and Hall conductance are obtained from the tensor relation: \u03c3xx = \u03c1xx/(\u03c1 2 xx + \u03c1 2 xy), and \u03c3xy = \u03c1xy/(\u03c1 2 xx + \u03c1 2 xy).\nNow, we show the numerical results of the conductance below. In Fig. 1, the Hall conductance \u03c3xy and the longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx are both non-quantized for a small dephasing strength, e.g. \u0393v = 0.5. Remarkably, one finds that the Hall conductance \u03c3xy decreases rapidly and arrived at a half-quantized plateau with increasing \u0393v [see Fig. 1(e)], while the longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx remains nonzero [see Fig. 1 (f)]. We will explain it later. After this half-quantization, \u03c3xy is independent of Fermi energy EF [see Figs. 1(c) and (e)]. In addition, \u03c3xx increases almost linearly with EF in Fig.1(d) because the density of state of the gapless Dirac cone is proportional to |EF |, and \u03c3xx decreases quickly with increasing \u0393v in Fig.1 (f) due to the momentum relaxation introduced by the virtual leads [29].

(a) Lay the side and bottom surfaces of the sample in Fig. 1 on the xy plane. The red balls represent the sites attached to virtual leads and the blue arrows indicate chiral edge current. a and b are used to label the black box, and the size of black box is rc. (x, y) is the coordinate of the red ball in the lower right corner of the box a. (b) The space distribution of the different of transmission coefficients Td with \u0393v = 4.0 and EF = 0.3. The inset show the value of Td in upper edge (y = n\u0303y\u2212rc), middle area (y = (n\u0303y\u2212rc)/2), and the lower edge (y = 1). (c) and (d) show rc and td as a function of \u0393v for different EF . Other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 1.\nthe transmission coefficients between the virtual leads. For convenience, we lay the side and bottom surfaces on the xy-plane [see Fig. 2(a)]. The red balls represent sites attached to the virtual leads. The total number of virtual leads in the y direction is n\u0303y = ny + 2(nz \u2212 1). Numerical results show that the transmission coefficient Tpq from lead q to lead p decays sharply with their distance rpq [25]. Thus, we can define a critical distance rc: Tpq = 0.001T1 when rpq = rc, such that Tpq can be neglected when rpq > rc. Here, T1 is the transmission coefficient between two nearest leads. In Fig. 2(c), rc is proportional to the phase coherent length, and thus decreases with increasing the dephasing strength \u0393v.\nIn order to reveal the directionality of the transmission, we define the difference of transmission coefficients between black box a and black box b as Td(x, y) = Tba\u2212Tab, where (x, y) is the spatial coordinate of the red ball in the lower right corner of the box a [see Fig. 2(a)]. Here Tba = \u2211 p\u2208b,q\u2208a Tpq the transmission coefficient from the box a to the box b, and p \u2208 a means that lead p is in box a [see Fig. 2(a)]. Figure 2(b) shows that Td = \u00b11/2 in the upper edge and the lower edge, respectively, and zero elsewhere. Moreover, td \u2261 Td(nx/2, n\u0303y \u2212 rc), the difference of transmission coefficient near the edges of top surface, keeps half-quantized for different EF and \u0393v [see Fig. 2(d)]. The half-quantized td means that there is a half-quantized chiral channel or a half-quantized chi-\nral current [13] on the edge of the top surface [see the blue arrows in Fig. 2(a)], giving rise to the HQHC. The half-quantized chiral current is rather robust against the dephasing process, so we can obtain a perfect HQHC plateau for different dephasing strengths in Fig. 1(a).\n1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 000 . 4\n0 . 5\n0 . 6\n0 . 0\n1 . 0\nt d \u03c3 x y(e\n2 /h )\nn y 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 000 . 6\n0 . 7\n0 . 8\n0 . 9\n0 . 0\n1 . 0\nt n \u03c3 x x(e\n2 /h )\nn y\n0 . 5 1 . 50 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0\n0 . 5\n0 . 0\n1 . 0\n\u03c3 x y(e\n2 /h )\nt n\nn u m e r i c a l r e s u l t t h e o r e t i c a l r e s u l t\n0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0\n0 . 5 0 4 0 . 5 0 0\u03c3 xy\n(e2 /h)\n0 . 5 1 . 50 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 5\n1 . 5 2\n2 . 5\n0 . 0\n1 . 0 \u03c3 x x(e\n2 /h )\nt n\nn u m e r i c a l r e s u l t t h e o r e t i c a l r e s u l t\n0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0\n0 . 5\n0 . 0\n1 . 0\n\u03c3 x y(e\n2 /h )\nn y\nn u m e r i c a l r e s u l t t h e o r e t i c a l r e s u l t\n( a )\n( d )\n( b )\n( c )\n( f )( e )\nFIG. 3: (Color online).

Here every r2c red balls in Fig. 2(a) are rearranged into one blue box in Fig .3(a). Because rc much larger than the phase coherent length [28], the transmission between two adjacent blue boxes is incoherent, and the system can be regarded as the classical conductor-network model [30, 31]. The conductance of conductor-network model in Fig .3(a) is determined by the total transmission coefficients between leads in two adjacent blue boxes, since Tpq 1 when rpq > rc. Using Ipq = (TpqVq\u2212TqpVp) the current flowing from the lead q\n4 to the lead p, one can get (see more details in Ref. [25]):\n\u03c3xy = e2\nh\n[ 1 + rc\u03b1tn + t 2 n\nt2d + t 2 n\n1\nn\u0303y \u2212 1\n] td\n\u03c3xx = e2\nh\n[ 1 + rc\u03b1tn + t 2 n\nt2d + t 2 n\n1\nn\u0303y \u2212 1\n] tn (2)\nwhere tn = t12+t13+t14 and \u03b1 = t56+t57+t89+t810\u22122tn, with tij = \u2211 p\u2208j,q\u2208i Tpqxpq/rc. xpq = xp\u2212 xq and xp(xq) is the x-coordinate of the lead p(q). p \u2208 i means that lead p is in box i [see Fig. 3(a)]. Notably, in the large size limit when n\u0303y 1, we have \u03c3xy = td e 2 h and \u03c3xx = tn e2\nh . This strongly demonstrates that the HQHC is directly related to the existence of half-quantized chiral channel td on the edges of the top surface, while \u03c3xx is contributed from the normal channels tn.\nNext, we demonstrate the validity of Eq. (2). First, we consider a simple model with rc = 1, where only the transmission coefficient between two nearest leads is nonzero (see more details in Ref. [25]). In Figs. 3(b-d), we evaluate \u03c3xy and \u03c3xx as a function of tn and n\u0303y numerically by Eq. (1) and analytically by Eq. (2), respectively, when td = 0.5. The results are found to be fitting well which justifies Eq.(2). Furthermore, by starting from the realistic semi-magnetic TI Hamiltonian, we calculate \u03c3xy, \u03c3xx, tn and td using Eq. (1) and plot them as a function n\u0303y in Fig. 3(e-f). It is found that \u03c3xy (\u03c3xx) decreases and converges to td (tn) when n\u0303y increasing, which is coincident with the theoretical results of Eq. (2) and thus again confirm the validity of Eq. (2). This strongly demonstrates the consistency and reliability of the obtained results. In realistic systems, if n\u0303y or \u0393v is too small so that n\u0303y/rc . 1, the half-quantized chiral current on the upper and lower edges will spatially mix due to finite tn, which sabotages the quantization of \u03c3xy. Therefore, we conclude that the dephasing process plays a key role in the separation of the two half-quantized chiral current in a metallic region, thus giving rise to the HQHC. This mechanism of the HQHC is very different from that of the conventional quantized Hall conductance which is observed in an insulating phase [5].\nComparison with experimental transport results\u2013 Recently, the Hall conductance \u03c3xy is experimentally reported to be half-quantized in the semi-magnetic TI [22]. In contrast, the Hall resistance \u03c1xy and longitudinal resistance \u03c1xx that directly measured in the experiments, as well as the longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx, are all non-quantized. Further, they show the temperature dependence of \u03c1xx, \u03c1xy, \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy. As a comparison, we calculate \u03c1xx, \u03c1xy, \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy as a function of T by using Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula at non-zero temperature [32]: Ip = e2\nh \u2211 q 6=p ( T\u0303qpVp \u2212 T\u0303pqVq ) .

Hall resistance \u03c1xy (a), longitudinal resistance \u03c1xx (b), Hall conductance \u03c3xy (c) and longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx (d) as a function of temperature T . The curves correspond to different Fermi energy EF . The dephasing strength \u0393v = 4.0, and other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 1.\nIn Figs. 4(a-b), both \u03c1xx and \u03c1xy are non-quantized and vary with T and EF . Remarkably, when the resistance [in Figs. 4(a-b)] is converted into the conductance, \u03c3xy is half-quantized and \u03c3xx is a monotonically increasing function of T for different EF [see Figs. 4(c-d)], which is utterly consistent with the experimental results. Based on the Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula at non-zero temperature, one gets \u03c3xy(EF , T ) = \u222b \u03c3xy(E, T = 0)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE\nand \u03c3xx(EF , T ) = \u222b \u03c3xx(E, T = 0)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE for n\u0303y 1 [25]. This indicates that the dependence of conductance on the Fermi energy at zero temperature, determines the temperature dependence of conductance. In Fig. 4(d), \u03c3xx increases with T because \u03c3xx increases almost linearly with |EF | at zero temperature, while \u03c3xy is independent of T in Fig. 4(c) because \u03c3xy is independent of EF at zero temperature. Then, \u03c1xy decreases with T since \u03c1xy = \u03c3xy/(\u03c3 2 xx + \u03c3 2 xy) is a monotonically decreasing function of \u03c3xx. \u03c1xx = \u03c3xx/(\u03c3 2 xx+\u03c3 2 xy) increases with \u03c3xx for \u03c3xx < \u03c3xy and decreases with \u03c3xx for \u03c3xx > \u03c3xy. So \u03c1xx will increase first and then decrease with T since \u03c3xx < \u03c3xy at zero temperature for EF = 0.05 and 0.10, and monotonically decreases with T since \u03c3xx > \u03c3xy at zero temperature for EF = 0.15 and 0.20.\nConclusion and discussion\u2013 In summary, we reveal that the half-quantized chiral current along the edge of a strongly dephasing metal is the origin of the HQHC of the semi-magnetic TI. In reality, a 2D metal should be strongly influenced by the disorder, and the gapless Dirac cone could be driven into a critical metallic phase that can also host the HQHC [18, 19]. Nevertheless, the HQHC is measured in a hundreds-micron sample in the experiment, which far exceeds the dephasing length, and thus the system belongs to a classical metal.\n5 Acknowledgement.\u2014 We thank M.

As EF is located in the Dirac gap, the total Hall conductance is half-quantized and the non-zero Hall conductance is mainly from the top surface.\nS2. LATTICE MODEL HAMILTONIAN AND DEPHASING\nWe discretize the Hamiltonian H in the main text on cubic lattices:\nH = [\u2211\ni c \u2020 iM0ci + (\u2211 i,j=x,y,z c \u2020 iTjci+e\u0302j + H.c. )] + \u2211 i\u2208top surface c \u2020 iMzci +Hd (2)\nwhereM0 = ( M0 \u2212 6B/a2 ) \u03c3z\u2297s0, Mz = Mz\u03c30\u2297sz, and Tj = B/a2\u03c3z\u2297s0 \u2212 iA/(2a)\u03c3x\u2297sj . Here, a = 1 is the cubic lattice constant. ci (c \u2020 i ) is the annihilation (creation) operator at site i, and e\u0302j is a unit vector in the j direction for j = x, y, z. The first and the second terms in Eq. (2) describe the semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) in the central region. The last term Hd = \u2211\ni,k [ ka \u2020 i,kai,k + (ti,ka \u2020 i,kci + H.c.) ] represents the Hamiltonian of virtual leads\nand real leads, and their couplings to the central sites. Note that we use the wide-band approximation for the real leads in the main text with parameters \u03931 = \u03934 = 0.9, n1 = n4 = Nz \u00d7 Ny, \u0393i = \u0393v and ni = nz for i = 2, 3, 5, 6, where \u0393v is the dephasing strength. Only electrons in the gapless surface states participate in the electrical transport when EF is located in the Dirac gap at zero or low temperature. Therefore, we just need to consider the dephasing process on the side and bottom surfaces. We simulate the dephasing process by using nx \u00d7 ny uniformly distributed Bu\u0308ttiker\u2019s virtual leads on the bottom surface and nx\u00d7nz uniformly distributed Bu\u0308ttiker\u2019s virtual leads on each side surface. Ni and ni are the number of total sites and selected sites in the i direction for i = x, y, z, respectively.\nIn our calculations, real lead 1 and 4 act as current electrodes and other real leads act as voltage electrodes. Thus, the longitudinal current I1 = \u2212I4 \u2261 Ix when a external bias is applied between lead 1 and lead 4 with V1 = V/2 and V4 = \u2212V/2. Virtual leads act as dephasing, so the net current of each virtual lead is zero. Combining LandauerBu\u0308ttiker formula[3, 4] with those boundary conditions in the real and virtual leads, one can calculate the voltage of each real lead and the longitudinal current Ix. Then the Hall resistance Rxy = (V2\u2212V6)/Ix and longitudinal resistance Rxx = (V2 \u2212 V3)/Ix will be obtained.\nS3. DERIVATION OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF CONDUCTANCE AT ZERO TEMPERATURE\nIn this section, we explains in detail how to derive the expressions of the Hall and longitudinal conductance. We lay the two side surfaces and the bottom surface of sample on the xy-plane, and divide red balls by blue boxes. Red balls represent sites attached virtual leads, so each blue box contains r2c red balls [see Fig. S2(a)]. Before derivation, let us discuss about three important assumptions and their validity.\nFirstly, we discuss about the critical length rc. Fig. S2(b) plot the transmission coefficient Tpq from virtual lead q to virtual lead p versus their distance rpq. T1 is the transmission coefficient between two nearest leads. The results show that Tpq decreases sharply with increasing rpq. We define a critical distance rc satisfying that Tpq = 0.001T1 when rpq = rc. Thus Tpq can be neglected when rpq > rc, which is the first assumption.\nSecondly, we define longitudinal and transverse electric field as: Ex \u2261 Vq \u2212 Vq+e\u0302x > 0, Ey \u2261 Vq+e\u0302y \u2212 Vq > 0.Here, Vq and Vq+e\u0302x are the voltages of the lead p and its nearest lead on the x direction, respectively. The numerical results demonstrate that the electric field is almost constant in the middle area of the gapless surface although it change when closing to the real lead 1 and lead 4. Therefore, the electric field of the green area and orange area can be thought to be constant, which is the second assumption.\nThe last assumption is that the difference of transmission coefficient between two nearest boxes is non-zero in the upper edge and lower edge, which is verified by numerical results of Fig.2(b) in the main text.\nBecause Tpq is so small that that it can be neglected when rpq > rc, only the current Ipq of two leads within one blue box or separately in two adjacent blue boxes is non-zero according to Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula [3, 4]. Ipq = e 2/h(TpqVq\u2212TqpVp) is the net current flowing from lead q to lead p. Then, one can get the total current flowing\nS3\n0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 0\n1 . 0\nT pq /T 1\nr p q\n\u0393 v = 1 . 0 \u0393 v = 4 . 0\n0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 00 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 E y\ny\nx = 8 0 x = 1 0 0 x = 1 2 0\n\u00d7 1 0 - 3\n0 5 0 1 0 0 1 5 0 2 0 00 . 0 3 . 0 6 . 0 9 . 0\n1 2 . 0\nE x\nx\ny = 1 y = 2 0 y = 4 1\n\u00d7 1 0 - 3\n( a ) ( b )\n( d )( c )\nFIG. S2. (color online) (a) Divide red balls in Fig.2.(a) in the main text by using blue boxes, and each blue box contain r2c red balls. The numbers are used to label boxes. (b) Tpq/T1 vs rpq for different \u0393v with EF = 0.3. Tpq is the transmission coefficient from virtual lead q to virtual lead p, and rpq is the distance of those two leads. T1 is the transmission coefficient between two nearest leads. (c) and (d) Ex vs x for different y and Ey vs y for different x. (Ex, Ey) is the electric field and (x, y) is the coordinate of red balls. \u0393v = 4.0 and EF = 0.3 in (c) and (d). Here, Nx = 800, Ny = 153, Nz = 5, nx = 200, ny = 39, nz = 2, and n\u0303y = 41. Other parameters are A = 1.0, B = 0.6, M0 = 1.0 and Mz = 0.4.\nin the horizontal (x) direction:\nIx = \u2211\np\u2208g,q\u2208o Ipq =\n\u2211\np\u2208g,q\u2208o (TpqVq \u2212 TqpVp)\n= \u2211\np\u2208g,q\u2208o Tpq(Vq \u2212 Vp) +\n\u2211\np\u2208g,q\u2208o (Tpq \u2212 Tqp)Vp\n= \u2211\np\u2208g,q\u2208o Tpq(xpqEx + yqpEy) +\n\u2211\np\u22086,q\u22085 (Tpq \u2212 Tqp)Vp +\n\u2211\np\u22089,q\u22088 (Tpq \u2212 Tqp)Vp\n= (tnn\u0303y + rc\u03b1)Ex + tdVu \u2212 tdVd = tnExn\u0303y + rc\u03b1Ex + tdEy(n\u0303y \u2212 1) (3)\nWhere the Vu(Vd) is the voltage of the upper (lower) edge, and Vu\u2212Vd = Ey(n\u0303y\u22121). p(q) \u2208 g(o) means that lead p(q) is in the green (orange) area [see Fig. S2(a)]. Here, we have assumed Tpq to be translational invariant on the gapless surface apart from its edges. The first term of Ix is the normal current, and the third term is the current from Hall effect. The second term is the extra current from the difference between the conductance in the gapless surface and the conductance at its edge. Here, tn = t12 + t13 + t14 and \u03b1 = t56 + t57 + t89 + t810 \u2212 2tn. tij = \u2211 p\u2208j,q\u2208i Tpqxpq/rc. xpq = xp \u2212 xq and xp(q) is the x-coordinate of the lead p(q). p \u2208 i means that lead p is in box i [see Fig. S2(a)]. And tn is isotropic and constant on the gapless surface (not include the edges of the surface). Similarly, one can get the current flowing in the vertical (y) direction Iy = tnEynx + rc\u03b1Ey \u2212 tdEx(nx \u2212 1). In our real model, nx 1 and Iy = 0, thus tnEy = tdEx. Then \u03c1xx = Ex(n\u0303y \u2212 1)/Ix and \u03c1xy = Ey(n\u0303y \u2212 1)/Ix. By converting the resistance to the conductance, one can get:\n\u03c3xy(EF ) = e2\nh\n[ 1 + rc\u03b1tn + t 2 n\nt2d + t 2 n\n1\nn\u0303y \u2212 1\n] td (4)\n\u03c3xx(EF ) = e2\nh\n[ 1 + rc\u03b1tn + t 2 n\nt2d + t 2 n\n1\nn\u0303y \u2212 1\n] tn (5)\nS4\nS4. TRANSMISSION COEFFICIENTS OF THE SIMPLE MODEL\nFIG. S3. (color online) Schematic plot of the treansmission coefficients of the simple model. The blue square and rectangle represent the real lead while the red circle represents the virtual lead. The double blue arrow indicate Tpq = Tqp = tn for two nearest leads. The single red arrow indicate an extra transmission td coefficient from one lead to another lead that the red single arrow points to.\nIn this section, we will illustrate the transmission coefficients of leads in the the simple model with rc = 1. For this simple model, only the transmission coefficient between two nearest leads is non-zero. As shown in Fig. S3, Tp,q = Tq,p = tn for two nearest leads (include real leads and virtual leads). Considering the difference of transmission coefficients is non-zero in the edge, we have Tp+e\u0302x,p = tn and Tp,p+e\u0302x = tn+td in the upper edge, and Tp+e\u0302x,p = tn+td and Tp,p+e\u0302x = tn in the lower edge. Here, p + e\u0302x represents the lead on the right-hand of lead p. Obviously, \u03b1 = td. The width of the sample is W = n\u0303y \u2212 1, and the distance between real lead 2 and lead 3 is L = W . Given the transmission coefficients of leads, \u03c3xy and \u03c3xx can be calculated numerically by Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula and then compared to Eqs.(4-5).\nS5. CONDUCTANCE AT NON-ZERO TEMPERATURE\nIn this section, we derive the Hall and longitudinal conductance at low temperature. In our numerical simulations, we use the Landauer-Bu\u0308ttiker formula at non-zero temperature[4]:\nIp = e2\nh\n\u2211\nq 6=p\n( T\u0303qp(T,EF )Vp \u2212 T\u0303pq(T,EF )Vq ) (6)\nHere, T\u0303pq(T,EF ) = \u222b Tpq(E)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE. f0 = [ e(E\u2212EF )/kBT + 1 ]\u22121 is the Fermi distribution function, EF is the Fermi energy, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In the section S3, we obtain the expression of conductance. Here, Similarly, one can get the total current flowing in the horizontal (x) direction Ix = t\u0303nExn\u0303y + \u03b1\u0303Ex+ t\u0303dEy(n\u0303y\u22121) and the relation t\u0303nEy = t\u0303dEx since the total current flowing in the vertical (y) direction Iy = t\u0303nEynx\u2212 t\u0303dEx(nx\u22121) = 0 with nx 1. Here, t\u0303n(T,EF ) = \u222b tn(E)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE, t\u0303d(T,EF ) = \u222b td(E)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE and \u03b1\u0303(T,EF ) = \u222b \u03b1(E)rc(E)(\u2212\u2202f0\u2202E )dE. Then, one gets:\n\u03c3xy(EF , T ) = e2\nh\n[ 1 + \u03b1\u0303t\u0303n + (t\u0303n) 2\n(t\u0303d)2 + (t\u0303n)2 1 n\u0303y \u2212 1\n] t\u0303d (7)\n\u03c3xx(EF , T ) = e2\nh\n[ 1 + \u03b1\u0303t\u0303n + (t\u0303n) 2\n(t\u0303d)2 + (t\u0303n)2 1 n\u0303y \u2212 1\n] t\u0303n (8)\nWhen ny 1, \u03c3xy(EF , T ) = t\u0303d and the expression in Eq.4 \u03c3xy(E, T = 0) = td(E). Then, one gets:\n\u03c3xy(EF , T ) = \u222b \u03c3xy(E, T = 0)(\u2212\n\u2202f0 \u2202E )dE (9)\nSimilarly,\n\u03c3xx(EF , T ) = \u222b \u03c3xx(E, T = 0)(\u2212\n\u2202f0 \u2202E )dE (10)\nS5\nHere, \u03c3xy(E, T = 0) and \u03c3xx(E, T = 0) are the Hall and longitudinal conductance at zero temperature, respectively[see Eq.4 and 5]. Eq.9 and 10 means that the total conductance comes from the carriers with energy near Fermi energy (that is, EF \u2212 (a few kBT ) < E < EF +(a few kBT )). Moreover, the dependence of conductance on the Fermi energy at zero temperature, determines the temperature dependence of conductance.\nIn the semi-magnetic TI, the Hall conductance at zero temperature \u03c3xy(E, T = 0) is independent of E [see Fig.1(c) in the main text]. Then \u03c3xy(EF , T ) = \u03c3xy(EF , T = 0) = 0.5 according to the Eq.9, which is why \u03c3xy(EF , T ) is halfquantized and independent of temperature in our numerical results and the experimental results. The longitudinal conductance \u03c3xx \u221d |EF | due to the gapless Dirac cone[see Fig.1(d) in the main text]. Given \u03c3xx(E, T = 0) = c|E|, and combine with the Eq.10, one gets:\n\u03c3xx(EF , T )\n\u03c3xx(EF , T = 0) = 1 +\n2kBT\n|EF | ln(1 + e\u2212|EF |/(kBT )) (11)\nObviously, \u03c3xx(EF , T ) is a monotonically increasing function of T , which coincides with our numerical results and the experimental results. Actually, only carriers with energy near Fermi energy (that is, EF \u2212 (a few kBT ) < E < EF + (a few kBT )) have contributions to the longitudinal conductance. When EF > 0, holes with energy below Dirac point contribute to the extra conductance (the second term in Eq.11), making the total conductance at low temperature larger than that at zero temperature. When the temperature is higher, or the Fermi energy is more close to the Dirac point, the number of holes participating in electric transport is more. Therefore, \u03c3xx(EF , T ) is a monotonically increasing function of T , and increases faster as the Fermi energy is more close to the Dirac point.\n[1] E. Prodan, Phys. Rev. B 80, 125327 (2009).
