            "text": "Strong coupling (SC) - light-matter interaction leading to the formation of new hybrid modes whose separation of energy levels is larger than the sum of their average linewidths - provides intriguing possibilities for controlling various material properties, such as e.g. carrier transport in organic semiconductors1,2, magnetotransport in two-dimensional electron gases3, or chemical reactivity changes in microcavities4\u20137. Conventional optical resonators, such as Fabry-Perot microcavities, are typically used to couple matter excitations with light. An approach to explore SC at nanoscale is to use polariton resonators, enabling SC between excitons and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at visible frequencies16,1, or between molecular vibrations and phonon polaritons (PhPs) at mid-infrared (mid-IR)10,11 to THz frequencies12,13. Interestingly, the interaction between excitons and molecular vibrations plays an important role in the optical properties of organic semiconductors14\u201316, particularly in the singlet fission. Achieving dual-band SC, i.e. SC between polaritons and both excitons and molecular vibrations simultaneously could provide new opportunities for controlling the state of matter at the nanoscale. However, excitonic and vibrational resonances emerge at significantly different energy domains separated by orders of magnitude, thus challenging the creation of strongly confined electromagnetic fields (hot spots) at visible and infrared frequencies - an essential ingredient for achieving SC at the nanoscale - at the same spatial position and with a similar size. Metallic antennas have already been used to enhance the light-matter interaction in both visible and mid-IR frequency bands17, in particular, to combine surface-enhanced Raman and infrared spectroscopy18,19. However, although metallic antennas work relatively well in the visible range, it is desirable to find alternatives for achieving SC in the mid-IR frequency range due to their low quality factor at these frequencies.\nVan der Waals (vdW) materials have recently emerged as a promising platform for exploring enhanced light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, as they support a large family of ultra-confined polaritons24,2 from visible to THz frequencies. In addition, these materials can be engineered with nanoscale precision, allowing precise control of light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales22. Furthermore, the combination of metal slabs or antennas with vdW materials can lead to hybrid heterostructures that support electromagnetic modes at different frequency ranges23 and potentially allow the creation of co-located visible and infrared hotspots to achieve dual-band SC.\nHere we demonstrate by numerical simulations that SC can be achieved simultaneously between SPPs and electronic transitions at visible frequencies and between PhPs and molecular vibration at mid-IR frequencies. For an experimental study, we employed nanoresonators based on a heterostructures composed of metal (Al) ribbons and monoisotopic hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) flakes, which support both SPPs at visible frequencies and PhPs at infrared frequencies. PhP resonances offer the advantage of being stronger and narrower as compared to SPP resonators2, thus facilitating the achievement of nanoscale vibrational SC10,11. We verify the two hotspots and their co-localization by scattering-type scanning nearfield optical microscopy (s-SNOM). By placing molecules on the nanoresonators within the corresponding hotspots and performing visible and mid-IR far-field spectroscopy, we provide direct experimental evidence for large mode splitting in both frequency ranges.\nSC can be directly observed by visualizing the propagation of PhPs in a cavity-free (unpatterned) slab in contact with organic molecules25,26. To explore the possibility of observing dual-band SC, we thus first perform a theoretical study considering a cavity-free heterostructure formed by a 50 nm-thick layer of CoPc\nbetween a 50 nm-thick Al layer and a 75 nm-thick h-BN slab (Fig 1a). CoPc molecules support both a vibrational resonance at mid-IR frequencies (1525 cm-1) and two excitonic resonances at visible frequencies (14400 cm-1 and 16200 cm-1) (Fig 1c,d). By placing the molecules between the two polaritonic materials (h-BN and Al) we expect to achieve highly confined mid-IR and visible electromagnetic fields inside the molecular layer (dashed lines in the left panel of Fig. 1a), thus guaranteeing a strong overlap of both fields and the molecules at the same spatial location. Since the plasma frequency of Al is p = 10.83 eV  8.7104 cm-1 27,28, the Al slab supports SPPs below \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc5d/\u221a2 = 5.4 eV  1.410 4 cm-1, i.e. in the whole visible range. The field of these SPPs is vertically confined on a length scale of 1/kSPP,z ~ 100 nm in the frequency range corresponding to the exciton resonances of CoPc. On the other hand, h-BN exhibits two mid-IR Reststrahlen bands - defined by the transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) optical phonons (785 to 845 cm1 and 1394 to 1650 cm-1) - where PhPs are supported29. Interestingly, since the out-of-plane and in-plane dielectric permittivities of h-BN differ in sign in both RBs, the h-BN slab supports a set of PhPs modes that are typically denoted M0, M1, etc. (so-called hyperbolic polaritons)30. The fundamental M0 mode exhibits the longest wavelength and propagation length and thus is typically the dominating mode in h-BN nanoresonators33,3. In the chosen structure, the momentum of the M0 mode at the molecular-vibrational resonance of CoPc is comparable to that of SPPs in the Al layer at the exciton resonance of CoPc. As a result, the vertical field confinement of the fundamental M0-PhP mode outside of the slab (1/kM0,z ~ 80 nm) is comparable to that of the SPPs, indicating that a molecular layer with a thickness of a few dozens of nm should be sufficient to achieve SC in both frequency bands.\nTo explore the concept of simultaneous dual-band SC, we calculated the dispersion of the polaritons in the cavity-free heterostructure, Fig 1a. To that end, we plot the imaginary part of the Fresnel reflection coefficient, Im[rp(q, )], at both visible and mid-IR frequencies (colour plots in Fig. 1e and 1f, respectively). The dashed red curves represent the dispersions of the quasi-normal polaritonic modes calculated from the poles of rp(q,  c) in the plane of the complex-valued frequency c=-i\u0393/2, with \u0393 being the mode linewidth (see Methods). Both colour plots and dispersion curves clearly reveal an anticrossing (mode splitting) in both visible and mid-IR frequency ranges. To characterize the anti-crossing, we determine the mode splitting, \u03a9, as the minimum vertical distance between the real part of the complex frequencies. The comparison of \u03a9 with half the sum of the linewidths of the upper, \u0393+, and lower, \u0393-, coupled states determines whether the coupling between polaritons and molecular excitations is weak, \u03a9 < (\u0393+ +\u0393- )/2, or strong, \u03a9 > (\u0393+ +\u0393- )/2 (ref33). In the mid-IR frequency range, our calculation yields \u03a9IR = 6.8 cm-1  8.4*10-4 eV and \u0393IR+,- = 4 cm-1  5*10-4 eV, such that the SC condition is well fulfilled. In the visible range, the three initial excitations (SPP and two excitons) couple, leading to the formation of three hybrid states (red dashed lines in Fig.1e). By extracting the mode splitting as the minimum vertical distance\nbetween the real frequencies of the adjacent hybrid states, we obtain \u03a9vis,1 = 1.6*103 cm-1  0.2 eV (between the low \u201c\u2013\u201d and middle \u201c0\u201d branches) and \u03a9vis,2 = 3.9*103 cm-1  0.48 eV (between the middle \u201c0\u201d and upper \u201c+\u201d branches). We found that the SC criterion is fulfilled for the split branches \u201c0\u201d and \u201c+\u201d, since\n\u03a9vis,2 > (\u0393vis,2,+ +\u0393vis,2,0 )/2, where \u0393vis,2,+,0 \u22cd 1.6*103 cm-1  0.2 eV is the linewidth of the middle and upper\nhybrid states, respectively. On the other hand, the SC criterion is not fulfilled for the split branches \u201c\u2013\u201d and \u201c0\u201d. Altogether, our calculations reveal that the combination of different polaritonic materials in a single heterostructure can be used to achieve dual-band SC.\nTo demonstrate experimentally the dual-band SC between polaritons and CoPc molecular excitations, we first have to consider the need to access the large intrinsic momenta of polaritons, which in the case of farfield illumination requires the presence of leaky modes in the heterostructure. The latter can arise in open Fabry-Perot (FP) nanoresonators, which can be fabricated by (i) nanostructuring the polaritonic slab, e.g. in the form of ribbons1,3, or (ii) nanostructuring the substrate below the h-BN slab35, i.e. by refractive index engineering. Importantly, the latter option allows the use of a pristine h-BN slab, thus preserving its crystal quality. Interestingly, by placing a 75 nm-thick h-BN flake on an Al grating (Fig 2a), we can engineer FP nanoresonators by simultaneously applying concepts (i) and (ii). Indeed, while SPPs propagating across the Al ribbons (along the x-axis) in the visible range reflect directly at the Al edges (concept i), PhPs in the hBN slab are reflected between the h-BN/air and h-BN/Al boundaries due to a refractive index step at midIR frequencies (concept ii). Fig. 2b,c show the normalised measured far-field extinction spectra of the nanoresonators in both frequency ranges. We can clearly recognize asymmetric peaks around = 1510 cm-1 and = 1.6*104 cm-1, which are identified (see Supplementary information SIII) as Fano-type FP resonances and, partially, as Bragg resonances arising from the overlap between the electromagnetic fields of adjacent cavities. As the inverse width of the Al ribbons (w-1) corresponds to an effective momentum of the resonating polaritons, we fabricated a set of structures with different w, in order to cover a wide range of momenta (Supplementary information SII).\nTo corroborate our far-field spectroscopy experiments and to better understand the distribution of the near-field amplitude at the frequencies of the extinction peaks in Fig.2b,c, we performed s-SNOM nanoimaging of the nanoresonator heterostructure (see schematics in Fig. 2g,h) at mid-IR and visible frequencies (see Methods). In these nanoimaging experiments, the nanoresonators were illuminated with s-polarised light, whose electric field is perpendicular to the metal ribbons. The top panels in Fig. 2e,f show the resulting s-SNOM images for a nanoresonator when recording tip-scattered p-polarized light, which yields the z-component of the real part of the electric field at mid-IR (mid-IR = 1510 cm-1, mid-IR= 6.62 m) and visible (vis = 15798 cm-1, vis= 0.632 m) frequencies (see Methods and Supplementary Information SIV). Interestingly, despite the large difference in the wavelength of the incident light, we observe two bright areas with opposite polarity above the Al ribbons for both frequencies, revealing the excitation of transverse Fabry-Perot modes. To support these observations, we performed numerical simulations considering a nanoresonator with the experimental parameters and illuminating conditions. As can be clearly seen in the lower panels of Fig. 2e,f, excellent agreement is obtained between the simulated and experimental near-field distributions. In the normalized distributions of the vertical component of\nthe electric fields (Fig. 2g,h), we identify strongly enhanced field amplitudes compared to the incident electric field, Einc, thus confirming the formation of the hot spots. Therefore, we can conclude that the peaks observed in the far-field extinction spectra correspond to transverse Fabry-Perot resonances of PhPs at mid-IR frequencies and SPPs at visible frequencies. More importantly, the s-SNOM images in combination with the simulations confirm that both mid-IR and visible hot spots are spatially co-localized on the metal ribbons, thus potentially allowing for dual-band light-matter coupling involving the same molecules.\nTo study experimentally the frequency splitting of the hybridized modes, we evaporated an 80 nm thick layer of CoPc molecules - for practical reasons - on Al/h-BN nanoresonators with different ribbon widths, w (inset of Fig.\n3), and measured the far-field extinction spectra in the visible and mid-IR frequency ranges (Fig 3b,e). We clearly observe peaks in the spectra whose positions depend on w, which can be attributed to the transverse polaritonic FP resonances that couple with the molecular excitations. More importantly, we observe an anti-crossing behaviour of the peaks (indicated by dashed black lines in Fig. 3b,e). These anti-crossings reveal coupling between SPPs and molecular excitons in the visible frequency range and coupling between PhPs and molecular vibrations in the midIR frequency range.\nTo corroborate the observed coupling between polaritons and molecular excitations, we simulated extinction spectra of nanoresonators with different ribbon widths (from 125 nm to 550 nm, colour plots in Fig. 3c,f) coated with a 80 nm thick CoPc layer. The colour plots in Fig. 3c,f show bright maxima, corresponding to polaritonic resonances, which shift to higher frequencies as w-1 increases. We find good agreement between the trends in the frequency position of the maxima in the colour plot and the eye guides marking the maxima in the experimental extinction spectra (dashed black lines, Fig. 3b, e). In particular, in both the visible and mid-IR frequency ranges, the maxima in the simulated extinction spectra show anti-crossing behaviour around the frequencies of the molecular excitations (horizontal green dashed lines, Fig. 3), supporting our experimental observations.\nTo theoretically quantify the mode splitting, we performed a quasi-normal polaritonic mode analysis in a threelayer CoPc/Al/h-BN continuous heterostructure (see Methods). The calculated dispersions of the quasi-normal modes, (q), are shown on top of the simulated extinction spectra in Fig. 3c, f (dashed red lines). To compare the mode dispersion and the simulated extinction spectra, we related the real-valued in-plane polariton momenta, q, with the width of the grating, w, for each frequency range, w-1 = 2q/(-vis,IR), where vis= -0.12, IR = -0.3 are fit constants for the visible and mid-IR ranges, respectively. According to a simple FP model, the extracted values of the parameter vis,IR can be interpreted as the phase acquired by the polaritonic modes under reflection from the Al ribbon edges (SPP modes) and refraction index step in h-BN slab (PhP modes). We find excellent agreement between the calculated dispersions of the polaritons and the positions of the peaks in the extinction spectra in both spectral ranges. This agreement demonstrates that the interaction between polaritons and matter excitations in the continuous heterostructure is approximately equivalent to that in the nanoresonator heterostructure, which justifies that the analysis of a continuous heterostructure can be used to characterize the coupling parameters in the nanoresonator heterostructure. From the quasi-normal mode analysis we extract a mode splitting at mid-IR frequencies of \u03a9IR = 5.9 cm-1  7.3*10-4 eV, and a mode splitting at visible frequencies of \u03a9vis,1 = 1.1*103 cm-1  0.14 eV (between the lower and middle polariton branches) and \u03a9vis,2 = 3*103 cm-1  0.37 eV (between the middle and upper polariton branches). Considering the linewidths of the coupled states in the mid-IR frequency range, \u0393IR+,- = 4 cm\u20131  5*10-4 eV, and the linewidths in the visible frequency range, \u0393vis1,-,0 = 1.5*103 cm-1  0.19 eV and \u0393vis2,0,+ = 1.7*103 cm-1  0.21 eV, we find that the strong coupling criterion, \u03a9 > (\u0393+ +\u0393- )/2, is fulfilled both at midIR frequencies and for the \u201c0\u201d and \u201c+\u201d branches at visible frequencies.\nTo determine the dispersion of the quasi-normal modes and extract the value of the mode splitting from the experimental data, we fitted our extinction spectra in Fig. 3b,e using a classical model of coupled harmonic oscillators: two coupled oscillators in the mid-IR frequency range and three coupled oscillators in the visible frequency range, respectively (see Supplementary information SV). The coupled harmonic oscillator models allows us to reproduce the experimental extinction spectra by fitting the parameters of the uncoupled oscillators and the coupling strengths for each nanoresonator structure. With the parameters extracted from the fits we can calculate the dispersion of the quasi-normal modes of the coupled system, according to the dispersion equations in Supplementary information SV. In both spectral ranges, we find that the dispersion of the quasi-normal modes exhibits anti-crossing, as clearly shown by the squares in Fig.3cf. In the IR range, the minimum vertical distance between the dispersion branches of the modes yields a mode splitting of \u03a9IR = 6.0 cm-1  7.3*10-4 eV (Supplementary Information SV). In the visible spectral range, we find two mode splittings of \u03a9vis,1 = 1.1*103\ncm-1  0.14 eV (between the lower and middle polariton branches) and \u03a9vis,2 = 2.1*103 cm-1  0.26 eV (between the middle and upper polariton branches). Thus, the extracted dispersions of the quasi-normal modes and the values of the mode splittings are in good agreement with the corresponding theoretical values for the continuous heterostructure in the mid-IR and visible spectral ranges (dashed red lines in Fig.3c,f) at the values of w-1 corresponding to the fabricated structures (white vertical dashed lines in Fig. 3c,f). We note that the linewidths of the quasi-normal modes extracted from the fits in both frequency ranges are about 2-6 times larger than those calculated theoretically and vary for different structures, so that only the SC onset is reached. We explain this discrepancy by fabrication uncertainties and width variation along the Al ribbons, fabrication-induced roughness, defects, and the presence of higher order PhP modes in h-BN slab.\nFinally, we analyze theoretically the coupling strength between polaritons and matter excitations. To do so, we\nextracted the mode splitting for continuous heterostructures with different molecular layer thickness dCoPc from the previously developed quasi-normal analysis (see Methods). We find that the mode splitting, and thus the coupling strength between polaritons and molecular excitations, increases with dCoPc in both visible and mid-IR frequency ranges (Fig. 4b, c). This result is explained by a larger portion of the electromagnetic field of the polaritonic modes inside the molecular layer for larger thicknesses (Fig. 4a)38,3. Furthermore, we find that the mode splitting reaches saturation for a thickness of 60 nm, which is due to the full confinement of the PhP field inside the molecular layer (the field does not reach the air region). Interestingly, in the visible frequency range, the SC\ncriterion is not fulfilled for the first exciton excitation even for a molecular layer thickness of 100 nm, while for the second excitonic excitation, the SC criterion is fulfilled for molecule layers thicker than 20 nm. In contrast, in the mid-IR range, the numerical calculations predict the observation of SC already for molecule layers as thin as 15 nm.\nOur work demonstrates that engineering a heterostructure composed of plasmonic and phononic materials allows simultaneous access to light-matter interactions in the visible and mid-IR frequencies. Such heterostructure can be exploited to achieve dual-band strong light matter coupling, namely between nanoscale confined polaritons (SPPs and PhPs) and electronic or vibrational excitations of molecules. Momentum-energy coupling between excitations and polaritons can be achieved by tuning the dispersion of the latter through the thickness of the layers in the heterostructure. Future dual-band SC experiments may offer novel opportunities for manipulating chemical reactions, advanced optical imaging and sensing, or optomechanical up-conversion."

We assumed a two dimensional (2D) geometry, namely an infinite number\nof infinitely long Al ribbons below the h-BN slab. We simulated transmission, reflection and\nscattering of a plane monochromatic wave normally incident onto the periodic array of\nnanoresonators. Figure S4a shows the schematics of one period of the simulated structure.\nThe right panels of Figure S4b,c show the calculated far-field extinction spectra, 1 \u2013 T, where the\nT is the power transmission coefficient in the visible and mid-IR frequency ranges, respectively.\nThe calculated extinction spectra in both frequency ranges reveal numerous peaks. In the visible\nfrequency range, we can clearly recognize a sharp peak in the extinction spectrum around  = 1.4*104 cm-1 followed by a broad peak around  = 1.65*104 cm-1 (Figure S4b, right panel). Both\npeaks form the so-called Wood-Rayleigh anomaly. Namely, the sharp peak (Rayleigh point) corresponds to the zero value of the z-component of the wavevector of the 1st order diffracted wave\nin the CaF2 substrate. It takes place directly at the boundary between frequency regions where the 1st order diffracted wave has evanescent and propagating character. In contrast, the second peak\n(Wood anomaly) represents the first-order SPP Bragg resonance, corresponding to the pole in the\ntransmission and reflection coefficients, and partially the Fabry-Perot (FP) resonance appearing as\na result of multiple reflection of SPP mode (along the x-axis) from the edges of Al ribbons. In the\nmid-IR frequency range, the extinction spectrum manifests multiple peaks (Figure S4c, right\npanel). We assume that the latter emerge due to FP resonances appearing as a result of multiple reflection of PhP waveguiding modes from their refractive index steps defined along the \ud835\udc65-axis by\nAl ribbons.\nTo analyze and interpret these peaks we generate the color plots (left panels of Figure S4b,c),\nrepresenting the z-component of the electric field above the h-BN slab as a function of the\nfrequency, , and coordinate, x. In the visible frequency range, we observe the periodic field\npattern along both the frequency and coordinate axes (Figure S4b, left panel). We see two bright\nlocalized areas (\u201chot spots\u201d) of different polarity along the coordinate axis, x, which can be\nexplained by the presence of the transverse FP mode in the considered frequency range. We note\nthat this FP mode can also be recognized in the simulated field distribution, Re(Ez)/|Ei|, in the x-z plane at vis = 15798 cm-1 (Figure 2h of the main text). We speculate that the periodicity of the field pattern along the frequency axis arises due to the complex interference between the\nelectromagnetic fields of the FP mode and the incident and reflected waves. In the mid-IR frequency range, we find two frequency regions around  = 1460 cm-1 and  = 1510 cm-1 with the\nbright localized areas of the different polarity along the coordinate axis. These bright areas arise\ndue to the presence of transverse FP resonances of PhP waveguiding modes at corresponding\nfrequencies. These FP resonances can be characterized as \u201cbright\u201d modes since they have a\nnonzero in-plane dipole moment which can couple with propagating waves in free-space. As a\nresult, these resonances appear as peaks in the far-field extinction spectrum (see the right panel of Figure S4\u0441). In the color plot shown in the left panel of Figure S4c, we see that at  = 1460 cm-1, a large portion of the mode volume is localized above the air region. In contrast, at  = 1510 cm-1\nthe electric field of the mode is mainly localized above the Al ribbon. These observations allow us to assign the resonance around  = 1460 cm-1 to the FP resonance of the PhP mode in h-BN slab\nabove the air region. In contrast, a multi-peak in the extinction spectrum around the  = 1510 cm-1 can be attributed to the FP resonances of the PhP modes above the Al ribbons. We explain\nthe multi-peak structure in the extinction spectrum of the resonance around  = 1510 cm-1 by the presence of higher-order PhP waveguiding modes in the h-BN layer. We finally identify the multi-peak resonance around  = 1510 cm-1 as FP resonances and, partially, as Bragg\nresonance arising from the overlap between the electromagnetic fields of adjacent air and Al\nregions.\nNote that, in contrast to the simulation, the experimental extinction spectrum in Figure 2b of the main text shows only the single resonant peak around  = 1510 cm-1. This discrepancy can be\nexplained by the fabrication uncertainties of the Al ribbon width throughout the array and by\nquality of the Al edges that play a crucial role in the far-field excitation of the higher-order PhP\nwaveguiding modes in the h-BN slab.\nFigure S4.
