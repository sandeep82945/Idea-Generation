    "abstractText": "Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling phenomenon, that can generate noticeable electric polarization in dielectric materials for nanoscale strain gradients. It is gaining an increasing attention because of its potential applications, and the fact that experimental results were initially an order of magnitude higher than initial theoretical predictions. This stimulated intense experimental and theoretical researches to investigate flexoelectric coefficients in dielectric materials such as two-dimensional materials. In this work, we concentrate on the calculation of the flexoelectric coefficients of 2DMoS2 thanks to a model using self-consistently determined charges and dipoles on the atoms. More specifically, we study the importance of two contributions which were neglected/omitted in previous papers using this model, namely the charge term in the total polarization and the conservation of electric charge through a Lagrange multiplier. Our calculations demonstrate that the results for flexoelectric coefficient computed with this improved definition of polarization agree better with experimental measurements, provided consistent definitions for signs are used. Additionally, we show how two physical contributions with opposite signs compete to give net values of flexoelectric coefficients that can be either positive or negative depending on their relative importance, and give net values for the case of MoS2. \u2217Electronic address: michel.devel@femto-st.fr",

It is\ngaining an increasing attention because of its potential applications, and the fact that\nexperimental results were initially an order of magnitude higher than initial theoretical\npredictions. This stimulated intense experimental and theoretical researches to investi-\ngate flexoelectric coefficients in dielectric materials such as two-dimensional materials.\nIn this work, we concentrate on the calculation of the flexoelectric coefficients of 2D-\nMoS2 thanks to a model using self-consistently determined charges and dipoles on the atoms.

INTRODUCTION\nFlexoelectricity[1], a fascinating electromechanical phenomenon, is widely employed to describe electric polarization caused by strain gradient. Unlike piezoelectricity, which arises only in noncentrosymmetric materials, flexoelectricity can a priori exist in all materials. Therefore, flexoelectricity can provide new opportunities to use some centrosymmetric materials to build electromechanical systems, such as energy harvesters[2, 3], actuators[4, 5], flexible electronics[6], flexoelectric sensors[7, 8].\nFlexoelectricity was first predicted by Mashkevich and Tolpygo[9] during Tolpygo\u2019s studies on the optical and elastic properties of crystals. The polarization due to the flexoelectric effect was later phenomenologically described by Kogan[10], using the contraction of a fourth order flexoelectricity tensor with the third order strain gradient tensor. Ever since the terminology \u2019flexoelectricity\u2019 was firstly borrowed from the liquid crystals community by Indenbom[11, 12] et al in 1981, a great deal of theoretical work has been done to advance the development of the theory of flexoelectricity in solids. Earlier theoretical descriptions principally concentrated on lattice dynamics using Kogan\u2019s phenomenological theory[10, 13, 14] and continuum mechanics[15] or microscopic theories based on lattice dynamics[13, 16\u2013 18] and quantum mechanics[19\u201322]. Calculations used methods such as core-shell model[17, 23], rigid-ion model[13, 14], molecular dynamics simulations[24\u201326], finite element method[27, 28] and phase-field method[29]. Recently, the advancement and popularity of machine learning techniques[30\u201332] provide original means for the computation of flexoelectricity coefficients. A novel technique called topology optimization methods have been proposed allowing for more accurate and efficient design of complex flexoelectric structures[33]. Another strategy, the isogeometric analysis (IGA), which fulfills the C1-continuity requirement has been adopted to identify the full flexoelectric properties based on electrical impedance curves.[34]\nFlexoelectricity in solids was believed to be a very small effect. However, at the beginning of the 2000s, Ma and Cross reported unexpectedly high experimental flexoelectric responses in a variety of perovskite ceramics [35\u201340] greatly arousing the interest in research of flexoelectricity in perovskite ceramics.[41\u201343] Furthermore, the relative importance of the flexoelectric effect with respect to the piezoelectric effect should increase as the scale of strain inhomogeneities decreases. Therefore, the recent development of ultrathin (2D) nanomaterials, due to the desired need for miniaturized devices, provide opportunities for researchers to study flexoelectricity in 2D materials which could offer interesting electromechanical coupling in nanodevices. Such an interest has stimulated intense research to investigate flexoelectric coefficients in carbon nanomaterials[20, 21, 44\u201346] (nanotubes, fullerenes, nanocores and patterned graphene), phosphorene[47], hexagonal boron nitride[48] and transition-metal dichalcogenides[49, 50] by means of first-principle calculations. Remarkably, Kumar et al very recently calculated the flexoelectric coefficient for fifty-four representative atomic monolayers selected from distinct groups in the periodic table of elements using ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT)[51].\nRecently, Zhuang and co-workers used molecular dynamics simulations coupled with a charge dipole (QP) model to compute flexoelectric coefficients for transitionmetal dichalcogenides[52] and related materials[53]. This kind of method uses calculations much faster than DFT calculations, and provides an easier way to predict the properties of bigger and less symmetric heterostructures. Since we have some experience in using the QP model[54\u201356] we studied those papers in details and noticed that a term involving effective charges was neglected/omitted in the definition of polarization that only used the effective dipoles, as in the case of covalent materials such as e.g. graphene. Furthermore, the enforcement of charge conservation was also not implemented, meaning that charges could flow in or out of the materials without any constraint, which can conflict with the fact that an\ninsulating substrate (Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), Au, Al2O3)[57, 58] was used to obtain the out-of-plane effective flexoelectricity coefficient of monolayer MoS2, by using an equation for converse flexoelectricity to link the out-of-plane effective piezoelectric coefficient measured by piezoresponse force microscopy and the flexoelectric coefficient to be determined[57, 58]. We also note that in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111 or \u00b52222 for such 2D materials have not yet been experimentally obtained, since it has been difficult to isolate the relative contributions of piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity to the resulting polarization.\nIn this work, we computed the in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111, \u00b52222, transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 and out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 for monolayer MoS2 using the charge-dipole model[59] with radial Gaussian regularization[54, 56, 60\u201363] enforcing charge conservation with a Lagrange multiplier and adding an ionic charge term in the definition of polarization. The significance of the missing charge term is estimated in the computation of \u00b53333, by comparison with the simulation paper of Javvaji et al.[53] and the experimental papers of Brennan et al.[57, 58]. Our calculations illustrate that the results for this flexoelectric coefficient computed with the improved definition of polarization agree in magnitude with experimental measurements, with the possible reason causing the discrepancy in sign discussed. Moreover, two critical factors capable of affecting the sign of flexoelectric coefficient are fully elucidated while \u00b53311 is computed. Additionally, \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 are calculated by using an in-plane displacement field that effectively eliminates the piezoelectric contribution to the polarization.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we describe the Gaussian regularized charge-dipole model, our bending simulation set-ups and the computational methodology for the computation of the strain gradient. The computation of in-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b51111, \u00b52222, transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 and out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 are presented and discussed in\nSec.III. Section IV concludes our findings."

            "text": "A. Principle of the method used to compute flexoelectricity coefficients\nAs written in the introduction, the direct flexoelectric effect describes the fact that a strain gradient in a material will cause an (additional) electric polarization of the material, because of the inhomogeneous distribution of positive and negative charge centers caused by the inhomogeneous deformation. Polarization being a vector described by a vector (first order tensor) and strain gradient a third order tensor, the supposedly linear relation between these two quantities is represented by a fourth order flexoelectricity tensor. Various conventions for the signification of the indices, leading to different matrix compressed representations, are used in the literature. We chose the one that puts the index corresponding to the polarization in first place, since we do not make use of the equivalence of the two strain indices:\n\u2206Pi = \u00b5ijklGjkl (1)\nwhere i, j, k, l are indices labeling the coordinates x, y, z or 1, 2, 3. The Einstein implied summation convention for repeated indices is used.\nOur goal is to compute values for these \u00b5ijkl coefficients. For that purpose we will use an inverse effect: when submitted to an external electric field, a dielectric material tends to deform so as to align its global dielectric polarization vector with the external field. Hence, we use various symmetric field configurations designed to deform inhomogeneously a MoS2 monolayer, while not changing the global polarization contributions due to the dielectric susceptibility of the material or its piezoelectric properties. Then, we compute both the global polarization and the global strain gradient of the deformed structure and fit the (hopefully linear) relation between these two quantities to find the \u00b5 coefficients.\nWe shall therefore describe now, how we compute the global polarization and\nstrain gradient in the monolayer.\nB. Description of the charge dipole model used to compute the polariza-\ntion of a monolayer MoS2 subjected to an external electric field\nWe start with the regularized charge-dipole (QP) model[54, 56, 60\u201363], in which each atom of a MoS2 nanoribbon is described by the combination of an effective charge and a dipole with radial Gaussian distributions, plus an effective electronegativity. The total electrostatic energy Eelec associated with those effective charges {q\u03b1} and dipoles {p\u03b1} located at the atomic positions {r\u03b1} (with \u03b1 = 1, ..., N), in the presence of an external electric field Eext is given by:\nEelec = N\u2211 \u03b1=1 q\u03b1(\u03c7\u03b1 + Vext,\u03b1)\u2212 N\u2211 \u03b1=1 p\u03b1 \u00b7Eext + 1 2 N\u2211 \u03b1=1 N\u2211 \u03b2=1 q\u03b1T \u03b1,\u03b2 q\u2212qq\u03b2\n\u2212 N\u2211 \u03b1=1 N\u2211 \u03b2=1 p\u03b1 \u00b7 T \u03b1,\u03b2p\u2212qq\u03b2 \u2212 1 2 N\u2211 \u03b1=1 N\u2211 \u03b2=1 p\u03b1 \u00b7 T \u03b1,\u03b2p\u2212p \u00b7 p\u03b2 (2)\nwhere N stands for the number of atoms in the structure considered and \u03c7\u03b1 is the electronegativity of the atom \u03b1, once inserted in the molecule. Vext,\u03b1 is the electrostatic potential at r\u03b1 corresponding to the external electric field, which can be expressed as \u2212Eext \u00b7 r\u03b1 in the case of a uniform external field. Tq\u2212q, Tp\u2212q and Tp\u2212p are interaction tensors between effective point charges or dipoles in vacuum (see equation 3), which have been convoluted with one radial Gaussian distribution per atom, of the form \u03c03/2R3\u03b1exp(\u2212|r\u2212 r\u03b1|2/R2\u03b1). This allows to take into account approximately the extension of the electronic clouds, and prevents the occurrence of divergence problems, i.e. polarization catastrophes, that can occur in simulations when two atoms are so close to each other that the approximation of an interaction between point charges or dipoles is not a good approximation\nany more.[60\u201362, 64, 65] T\u03b1\u03b2q\u2212q = 1 4\u03c0 0r\u03b1\u03b2 erf ( r\u03b1\u03b2\u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 ) T \u03b1\u03b2p\u2212q = \u2212\u2207r\u03b1T \u03b1\u03b2 q\u2212q = \u2212 14\u03c0 0 r\u03b1\u03b2 r3\u03b1\u03b2 [ erf ( r\u03b1\u03b2\u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 ) \u2212 2\u221a \u03c0 r\u03b1,\u03b2\u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 exp ( \u2212 r 2 \u03b1\u03b2 R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 )] T \u03b1\u03b2p\u2212p = \u2212\u2207r\u03b2 \u2297\u2207r\u03b1T \u03b1\u03b2 q\u2212q = 1 4\u03c0 0 { 3r\u03b1\u03b2\u2297r\u03b1\u03b2\u2212r2\u03b1\u03b2I r5\u03b1\u03b2 [ erf ( r\u03b1\u03b2\u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 ) \u2212 2\u221a \u03c0 r\u03b1,\u03b2\u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 exp ( \u2212 r 2 \u03b1,\u03b2 R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2 )] \u2212 4\u221a\n\u03c0 r\u03b1\u03b2\u2297r\u03b1\u03b2 r2\u03b1\u03b2\n1 ( \u221a R2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2) 3 exp\n( \u2212 r 2 \u03b1\u03b2\nR2\u03b1+R 2 \u03b2\n)} .\n\u2200\u03b1 6= \u03b2 (3)\nwhere r\u03b1\u03b2 = r\u03b2\u2212r\u03b1 is the vector pointing from \u03b1th atom to \u03b2th atom. R\u03b1 and R\u03b2 are the characteristic widths of Gaussian charge distributions for atom type \u03b1 and \u03b2 respectively. In the limit r\u03b1 = r\u03b2, the expressions of the various T\u03b1,\u03b2 interaction tensors in equation 3 converge to finite values (Eq. 4) related to the self-energy for each atom (atomic \u2019capacitance\u2019 or chemical hardness and polarizability). q\u03b1T \u03b1,\u03b1 q\u2212qq\u03b1 = q2\u03b1 4\u03c0 0 \u221a 2/\u03c0 R\u03b1 p\u03b1 \u00b7 T \u03b1,\u03b1p\u2212qq\u03b1 = 0\np\u03b1 \u00b7 T \u03b1,\u03b1p\u2212p \u00b7 p\u03b1 = \u2212 p2\u03b1 4\u03c0 0\n\u221a 2/\u03c0\n3R3\u03b1 .\n(4)\nOur version of the QP model for MoS2 possesses 8 parameters: 2 (\u03c7 and R) per kind of atoms by 4 kinds: Mo and S \u2019bulk\u2019 + Mo and S \u2019edge\u2019. Details on this parameterization, by comparison with DFT data, are given in our previous work.[56]\nThe charges and dipoles at electrostatic equilibrium are then determined by minimizing the electrostatic energy (Eq. 2) using a Lagrange multiplier \u03bb to enforce charge conservation in the nanoribbon:\nf = Eelec + \u03bb( N\u2211 \u03b1=1 q\u03b1 \u2212Qtot) (5)\nThis Lagrange multiplier can be physically interpreted as the chemical potential of the molecule.[61] This enforcement of charge conservation within the framework\nof QP model is quite essential since it ensures that charges stay in the material in order to mimic the conditions of experimental measurements.[58] Requiring the derivative of function f(q,p, \u03bb) with respect to q\u03b1, px,\u03b1, py,\u03b1, pz,\u03b1 and \u03bb to be zero will give a system of 4N + 1 linear equations for determining the 4N + 1 scalar unknowns (q\u03b1, px,\u03b1, py,\u03b1, pz,\u03b1 and \u03bb). These linear equations may be written in a matrix form:\n Tq\u2212q T t p\u2212q 1 Tp\u2212q Tp\u2212p 0\n1 0 0\n  q p\n\u03bb\n =  \u2212(\u03c7+ Vext)\n\u2212Eext Qtot  (6) where Tq\u2212q is a block matrix with N rows and N columns. Tp\u2212p is a block matrix with 3N rows and 3N columns. Tp\u2212q is a block matrix with 3N rows and N columns. T tp\u2212q is the transpose of Tp\u2212q. Similarly, blocks q and \u2212(\u03c7 + Vext) have N rows and 1 column, while blocks p and \u2212Eext have 3N rows and 1 column. We note that the solution can be written in two parts as: q p\n\u03bb\n =  Tq\u2212q T t p\u2212q 1 Tp\u2212q Tp\u2212p 0\n1 0 0\n \u22121  \u2212\u03c7 0\nQtot\n+  Tq\u2212q T t p\u2212q 1 Tp\u2212q Tp\u2212p 0\n1 0 0\n \u22121  \u2212Vext \u2212Eext\n0  (7) where the first term on the right side corresponds to intrinsic charges q0\u03b1 and dipoles p0\u03b1, i.e. charges and dipoles in the absence of any external electric field, that can however vary due to a mechanical deformation. The electronegativities \u03c7\u03b1 uniquely determine these intrinsic charges and dipoles (given the atomic positions), independently from any external electric field Eext or potential Vext. For our calculations, the total charge of the nanoribbon (Qtot) is set to be zero because of the fact that flexoelectricity is supposed to be an intrinsic property, therefore requiring no extra charge to appear. The second term on the right side corresponds to effective additional charges (qind\u03b1 ) and dipoles (pind\u03b1 generated by the external\nelectric field and potential). This can be summarized under the form: px = N\u2211 \u03b1=1 (p0x,\u03b1 + p ind x,\u03b1) py = N\u2211 \u03b1=1 (p0y,\u03b1 + p ind y,\u03b1) pz = N\u2211 \u03b1=1 (p0z,\u03b1 + p ind z,\u03b1)\nq = N\u2211 \u03b1=1 (q0\u03b1 + q ind \u03b1 )\n(8)\nIn terms of the calculated dipoles p and charges q, the global polarization P for MoS2 nanoribbon is defined as[59]:\nP =\nN\u2211 \u03b1=1 (q\u03b1r\u03b1 + p\u03b1)\nV (9)\nin which V is the volume of MoS2 nanoribbon. A thickness of 6.5 \u00c5 is used in computing V .[66] More information on the charge dipole model for MoS2 can be found in our previous work[56]. Note that since MoS2 is not ferroelectric, the total contribution to polarization of the q0\u03b1 and p0\u03b1 is zero (verified numerically), so that Eq. 9 could be rewritten by taking into account the induced charges and dipoles only.\nIn order to compare with some DFT results or remove edge effects, periodic boundary conditions can be applied in the QP model by adding the contributions of periodic images in the interaction tensors, i.e. adding contributions obtained by replacing r\u03b1\u03b2 in Eq.3 with r\u03b1\u03b2 +L \u2217 p (p \u2208 [\u2212k, k]) , with L denoting the periodic length in a given direction and k being a very large integer. We verified that setting k = 100 in our calculation is already sufficiently large to reach convergence in the computation of in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111, \u00b52222 and out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333, thus eliminating edge effects.\nC. Calculation of flexoelectricity coefficients\nWe illustrate the method we use to compute the flexoelectric coefficients on the\nspecial case of the determination of \u00b53311.\n1. potential energy functional used for the \u2019structure\u2019 part\nThe key of the molecular simulations is actually the interatomic potential, which is applied to describe the interaction among atoms. For single-layer MoS2, the Stillinger-Weber many-body potential (ESW ) as parameterized by Wen et al[67] was very recently proven to be robust through a quantitative systematic comparison of structural and mechanical properties, as well as phonon dispersion for single-layer MoS2 using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular statics calculations.[68] We therefore used this parameterizaton of the SW potential (ESW ) in our simulations, and found it very stable. Its analytical form and the values of the parameters are recalled in Supplementary material. The various MoS2 nanoribbons we use in our simulations are thus initially relaxed by minimizing ESW . This gives the undeformed configuration mentioned in the previous subsection.\nTo compute the deformed configurations, we removed the interactions between intrinsic charges and dipoles in Eelec, since they are already included in ESW . We also neglected the total contribution of the interactions between intrinsic and induced charges and dipoles to keep only the total contributions of the interactions between charges and dipoles induced by the external field and potential (which we name E \u2032elec).\n2. Initial conditions for the calculation of \u00b53311\nIn order to compute \u00b53311, a \u2198\u2197-like external electric field Eext, with both directions of Eext in the x-z plane, is applied to the MoS2 nanoribbon, keeping the middle row of atoms fixed (as if it were attached to a virtual fixed object). This field generates a bending deformation of the nanoribbon because of the inverse flexoelectric effect, as seen in Fig 1. The conjugate gradient algorithm is then used to minimize the energy function Etot = ESW + E \u2032elec which now includes the interactions with the external field and potential and the contributions of the effective induced charges and dipoles. The energy optimization simulation then makes the MoS2 flake bend towards the direction of the applied electric field by adjusting the positions of the atoms until the computed average force is less than 0.00004 eV/\u00c5. Note that all these simulations are done with a FORTRAN code that has been continuously developed in the group for years.\nThe mechanism of electrostatic bending of MoS2 flake is depicted in Figure 1 of Supplementary material. We can see that negative and positive charges are shifted to opposite directions due to the non-zero transversal electric field (positive\ncharges move to upper left and negative ones move to top right of the MoS2 flake). The interaction between the electric field generated by the induced charges and the external electric field produces two torques with opposite direction, termed \u03c41 and \u03c42, which may be expressed as qr \u00d7 Eext, making the two sides of the MoS2 flake respectively bend towards the direction of the external electric field with the fixed atoms as the rotation axis, while giving a zero total polarization along the vertical axis.\n3. Calculation of \u00b53311\nContributions to the polarization of a given dielectric material submitted to an external electric field may come from piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity and electric susceptibility. In the simulations defined in the previous subsection, piezoelectricity may not be taken into account due to the symmetric bending deformation[52]. This makes the total induced polarization due to the first order deformation gradient become zero. Additionally, one can find the total external electric field along the out-of-plane is also zero. Hence, the out-of-plane polarization equal to the product of the susceptibility and the electric field should be removed as well. The remaining flexoelectric part of the out-of-plane polarization P3 can be written as:\nP3 = 3\u2211 j=1 3\u2211 k=1 3\u2211 l=1 \u00b53jklGjkl (10)\nwith \u00b53jkl standing for flexoelectric tensor components. With the setup defined in the previous section, this can be approximated by:\nP3 = \u00b53311G311 (11)\nHence \u00b53311 can be determined as the slope of the supposedly linear relation between P3 and G311. Details on the computing method for determining strain gradient can be found in Supplementary material."

The parameters for ESW and QP model used in this work were initially validated through calculation of the inplane piezoelectric constant e222 for an MoS2 monolayer. We found a value of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding experimental result (more details\nare given in Supplementary material).\nA. Out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333\nAs can be seen on Fig.2a, for this calculation, the layer of molybdenum atoms is shifted a small distance h to the positive direction of z axis to generate a strain gradient only along the out-of-plane (z) direction. In this case, the unique strain gradient that does exist is G333 and the expression for computing \u00b53333 can be written as \u00b53333 = \u2202P3\u2202G333 . The geometric thickness of monolayer MoS2 is t. With both h and t, the strain gradient G333 can be computed as \u22128ht2 , which may be derived by: G333 = d 2uz(0) dz2 \u2248 uz(\u2212 t 2 )+uz( t 2 )\u22122uz(0) (t/2)2 = 0+0\u22122h (t/2)2 = \u22128h t2 , with uz( t2), uz(\u2212 t2) and uz(0) representing the displacement of atoms for top sulfur layer, bottom sulfur layer and molybdenum layer, respectively. In this calculation, we enforce periodic boundary conditions to eliminate edge effects that can be quite important in such a setup. As can be seen on Fig.2b, we use a MoS2 flake with a width of 6.164 nm and a length of 6.388 nm as supercell, which gives periods along x and y direction of 6.322 nm and 6.570 nm, respectively. Bond length between Mo and S is set as 2.39763 \u00c5 in the presence of periodic boundary conditions. On Fig.2c, we plot the polarization P3 as a function of G333, in order to obtain the flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 of 2D MoS2. Three different ways to compute the polarization are used (using q\u03b1r\u03b1 only, using p\u03b1 only or using both terms in Eq.9, with charges and dipoles computed using the QP scheme in the three cases). The units of polarization P3 and strain gradient G333 are converted from e/\u00c52 and \u00c5\u22121 to 1010 nC/m2 and 1010 m\u22121 respectively, so as to readily obtain \u00b53333 in nC/m from the slope of the fitted straight line. We compare \u00b53333 computed under the various definitions of polarization with that obtained from the experimental measurements conducted by Brennan et al in 2017 and 2020[57, 58], respectively, as shown in Table I.\nIt can be seen that the result for \u00b53333 computed when the charge term is included in the definition of polarization will be comparatively closer to the experimental result in absolute value whereas \u00b53333 computed with the dipole term only considered is of the same order of magnitude but much smaller than the experimental value. This manifests that the charge term, omitted/neglected in Ref.[52], cannot be neglected for the calculation of polarization for MoS2. We do not take into account the discrepancy in sign between our computed results and the results of the Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) measurements of Brennan et al., since we believe that it is due to a problem of different definition for the algebraic (or not) radius of curvature. This is reflected in another experimental measurements of out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 for few-layers MoS2 with PFM, very recently conducted by Hirakata et al[69]. In their work, the sign of the out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient is measured to be negative, though they quote a positive number. Indeed, using their Eq. 9, one can get \u00b53333 = \u00b539 = \u2212c33 3/\u2202E3\u2202x3 . S-\nince c33, 3 and \u2202E3\u2202x3 (see their Figure 11) are all positive, their \u00b53333 is in fact negative.[69]\nOther problems could arise because the MoS2 samples used in the PFM experiments might not be as perfect as that used in our calculation. Indeed, intrinsic atomic defects have been observed in the CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 using nearfield photoluminescence imaging[70]. These defects could give rise to very localized strain gradients and therefore to noticeable additional polarization due to flexoelectricity, since monolayer MoS2 is sensitive to any tiny deformation along vertical direction (z) due to its atomically thin thickness. Furthermore, the possibly existing interfacial contamination between substrate and MoS2 sample and the other uncertainties relevant to the measurements could be another cause of discrepancy between our theoretical results and the experimental ones. It would be useful if these (difficult) experiments could be repeated many times, so as to reduce the large uncertainties on the experimental results, but we feel that our present results for \u00b53333 of a MoS2 monolayer, agree well enough with experiment, to encourage us to compute other flexoelectric coefficients for MoS2 monolayer, for which we do not have experimental data to compare with.\nB. Transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311\nThe bending simulation described in the \u2019Methods\u2019 section is employed to compute the transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 of MoS2. Since the visible displacements are mostly along z direction, the strain gradient enabling polarization to be nonzero is principally G311. Hence, \u00b53311 may be approximately expressed as \u00b53311 = \u2202P3\u2202G311 . Fig.3a presents the variations of the out-of-plane polarization P3 for a MoS2 flake bent along (x) zigzag direction with respect to the strain gradient G311. One can notice that the intercept of the linear-fitting straight line is almost zero, meaning that the nonzero polarization is mainly caused by G311.\nContrarily to what we did for the computation of \u00b53333, periodic boundary conditions cannot be exerted in the bending simulation because bending of material submitted to the external electric field will break the periodicity of the lattice itself. We therefore studied the effect of the size of the MoS2 flake, on the computed flexoelectric coefficient. Fig.3b is plotted to present the variation of transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 with the increasing number of atoms. It can be seen that the value of \u00b53311 scales non-linearly down with the number of atoms. The larger the number of atoms, the more obvious the trend of curve convergence. To obtain a converged value, data is fitted with an exponential function. With the number of atoms increasing, the transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 converges to\u22120.1075 nC/m, comparable to that for phosphorene[47] and boron nitride sheet[48]. A comparison is made between \u00b53311 computed with QP model and that obtained by DFT-based first principle calculation by Shashikant et al[51], as listed in Table II. It can be seen that our computed result for \u00b53311 agrees much better in absolute value with that obtained from DFT calculations than the one computed by Zhuang et al.[52], signifying that the computation of transverse flexoelectric coefficient of MoS2 can be well captured by the QP model, if the proper definition for the polarization is used. Note that the radial polarization pr defined in reference [51] and [71] to compute \u00b53311 can be considered equivalent to the pz used in our work, since it is always locally perpendicular to the 2D material. We will now turn again to the question of the sign of the flexoelectric coefficients.\nUnderstanding the reason causing the discrepancy in the sign of flexoelectric coefficients is essential because the direction of the electric polarization induced by flexoelectricity is of significance for sensors and energy harvesters. We will study successively the sign of the polarization and the strain gradient.\nConcerning polarization, we separate two distinct contributions: one due to the deformation of the lattice and the other one due to charge transfer between the inner and outer layers during bending. For that purpose we first compute\nthe relaxed positions of a MoS2 flake deformed under the action of an electric field, using the QP model (Fig.4a). Then we compute the polarization for that bent MoS2 flake, for an hypothetical case where the charges of the sulfur atoms would be the same in the upper and lower layers. In that hypothetical case, the computation gives a polarization in the negative direction of z axis, whereas in the undeformed MoS2 flake, the total dipole moment along the out-of-plane direction\nis always zero due to the fact that the molybdenum atomic layer is equidistantly sandwiched between two layers of sulfur atoms. Fig.4b illustrates this phenomenon with the case of the two rows of atoms nearest to the symmetry plane of the deformed flake: the molybdenum cations are repelled away from the inner part of the bend (which is its denser part). The consequence is that, while the charge center of the sulfur anions stays half way between the two layers, the charge center of the molybdenum is lower which results in a polarization pointing downwards (hence a negative contribution to \u00b53311 since G311 is positive in that case).\nHowever, the above effect is not enough to fully account for the polarization since we artificially used identical charges for the sulfur atoms. in reality, since the overlapping of the electronic clouds of two nearby ions change during bending, partial charges can be transferred from one sulfur layer to the other. In order to understand that second contribution to the polarization, two representative areas of the same deformed MoS2 flake, named A and B, are considered in Fig.5a. The average charge for the sulfur atoms in the upper and lower layers, calculated by averaging net charges obtained by the QP model along y direction perpendicular to the figure, are \u22120.776 e and \u22120.803 e, respectively. Therefore the atoms of the lower sulfur layer appear to be more negative than those of the upper layer. This creates a net dipole moment pointing from the outside to the inside of the curvature (in the positive direction of z axis in our case). At the B site, the curvature is much smaller than at the A site and consequently the difference in charges between sulfur atoms in the upper and lower layer is smaller. In Fig.5b, we plotted the average charge difference \u2206q = qlower\u2212qupper between sulfur atoms in the lower and upper layer, as a function of their index along the x coordinate (see numbers on the molecular picture inside the graph). It can be seen that the absolute value of \u2206q decreases with the increasing index of sulfur, which agrees with what we expected before implementing the computation, since it corresponds to the flexoelectric effect: if the strain gradient is smaller, then the polarization is smaller (in absolute\nvalue). Hence, we have two contributions in opposite directions: a downward electric dipole moment due to bending of the lattice and an upward electric dipole moment due to charge transfer. In the case of MoS2, our computations show that polarization caused by bending deformation of lattice (which tends to give a negative flexoelectric coefficient) surpasses that resulting from charge transfer (which tends to give a positive flexoelectric coefficient). It is worth mentioning here that a negative \u00b53311 for MoS2 monolayer has very recently been obtained using first-principles linear-response theory[71]. Very interestingly, it can be found in their calculations that two contributions coming from the dipolar and the latticemediated response, respectively, to the total polarization response also play a competing role, the signs of the former and the latter tending to be opposite, as in our study.\nWe now turn to the sign of the strain gradient. In a review paper, Wang et al[72] pointed the discrepancies between definitions and symbols of physical\nquantities to be one of the reasons for the inconsistency of the reported signs of flexoelectric coefficients. It is often the case for the strain gradient G311. Indeed, on Fig.6 we illustrate that the strain gradient, defined as G311 = u\u2032\u2032z(x) which can be either positive or negative, is often approximated as the inverse of the radius of curvature. Since, for some authors, the radius of curvature is always positive, G311 is always positive for them, regardless of the bending direction of the material. Slightly differently, Kundalwal et al[48] considered a boron nitride sheet shaped as an upward convex curved arch and defined G311 as the absolute value of the inverse of radius of curvature. We note, however, that we used a downward pointing bend (top part of Fig.6 and Fig.4) which gives a positive strain gradient for all these definitions.\nThe previous considerations tentatively explain why flexoelectric coefficients can be either positive or negative, due to a competition between lattice and charge transfer effect, and not always positive as some authors define it by using absolute values inside their definition.\nC. In-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b51111 and \u00b52222\nInspired by the work of Hong et al[73], the in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 are computed in the present work. Strain gradient G111 is created by displacing every atoms along x axis, according to a parabolic displacement function ux(x). Fig.7a is a schematic diagram showing the transverse displacement of atoms for a MoS2 flake with a bigger (so that it be visible thanks to the two vertical lines) strain gradient imposed along x axis. Fig.7b shows the variation of displacement of atoms along x direction in the case \u2206d = ux(x) = 0.01\u2212 10\u22125x2, strain xx and strain gradient xx,x (G111) as functions of the position along x axis for MoS2. We can see that the total strain is zero due to the symmetric distribution of displacement with respect to x = 0. Hence, the polarization due\nto piezoelectricity can be fully removed from the total polarization, leaving only flexoelectricity. Furthermore, \u00b51111 can be expressed as \u00b51111 = \u2202P1\u2202G111 and for a similar simulations with parabolic displacement along y, \u00b52222 = \u2202P2\u2202G222 . The magnitude of strain gradient for our calculations of \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 ranges from 0 to 0.00004 \u00c5\u22121, which is small enough to neglect any non-linear effect.\nThe dependence of in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 on the width of nanoribbon with infinite lengths is shown in Figure 4 in Supplementary material. Clearly, the in-plane flexoelectric coefficients increase as the width of nanoribbons increases (polynomial fits are guides to the eye). The non-convergence behavior of those flexoelectric coefficients with the increase of the width of the nanoribbons has\nbeen elaborately discussed[74]. Hao et al. reveals through DFT calculations that the flexoelectric coefficients of the 2D Janus TMDs nanoribbons depend strongly upon their widths. The (slightly) different results for the two orientations are probably due to edge effects different for armchair and zigzag edges. To completely eliminate edge effect we use periodic boundary conditions in both directions for the displacements. In their article,[73] Hong et al. computed the in-plane flexoelectric coefficients of SrTiO3 using a strain gradient with a cosine form, to be compatible with the periodic boundary conditions. In our work, strain gradient is a constant function (see Fig.7b), which is an even simpler case. Fig.8 shows the variations of polarization P1 and P2 with strain gradient G111 and G222 for those doublyperiodic setups. The computed flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 are 0.6872 nC/m and 0.7119 nC/m, respectively. Hence, the in-plane flexoelectric properties of doubly-infinite MoS2 are nearly isotropic, i.e. independent of the zigzag or armchair direction."

            "text": "Employing three different simulation setups, we calculated in-plane flexoelectric coefficients \u00b51111, \u00b52222, transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 and out of plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 for monolayer MoS2 using the charge dipole model and charge conservation. The out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53333 and transverse flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 computed by the charge-dipole model are compared with those obtained by experimental measurements and DFT-based first principle calculations, by which good agreement in absolute value can be seen when the charge term is included in the computation of the polarization. We discuss in details possible origins of discrepancy in sign between our calculated flexoelectric coefficient \u00b53311 and other reported results, by showing two opposite effects for the sign of the polarization. Furthermore, we emphasize that comparison of flexoelectric coefficients between different computational works requires a careful check for the sign of strain gradient and the way of defining the polarization. Concerning the computed in-plane flexoelectric coefficient \u00b51111 and \u00b52222 are found to be quasi identical, which is consistent with the analysis of symmetry for the flexoelectric coefficient tensor of a 2D continuum.\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that the computed in-plane flexoelectric coefficient is about twenty times greater than out-of-plane flexoelectric coefficient for MoS2, which can be ascribed to the fact that the net charges induced by in-plane strain gradient between every primitive cells lead to the generation of larger electric dipole moments, whereas the movement of the charge in the out-of-plane direction is restricted due to the finite thickness. Hence, a relatively small polarization is then induced in the out-of-plane direction. For 2D materials, bending seems to be the easiest way to externally generate a big strain gradient at nanoscale, on a large area. Therefore, even if in-plane flexoelectric coefficients may play a role in some systems, the differences between in-plane, out-of-plane and transverse coefficients in MoS2 flakes is not big enough to compensate for the bigger and more\nhomogenous strain gradient that can be realized by bending. It is thus important to find 2D materials that optimize the transverse flexoelectric coefficients \u00b53311 for applications in energy harvesting."
