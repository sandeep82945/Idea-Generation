With the guild of molecular networking analysis, we isolated and identified six uncommon structural characteristics of compounds, including four newly discovered pyridinopyrones. Based on genomic analysis, we proposed a possible hybrid NRPS-PKS biosynthesis pathway for pyridinopyrones. Notably, this pathway starts with the use of nicotinic acid as the starting unit, which is a unique feature. Compounds 1\u20133 exhibited moderate anti-neuroinflammatory activity against LPS-induced BV2 cell inflammation. Our study demonstrates the diversity of polyene pyrone compounds regarding their chemical structure and bioactivity while providing new insights into their biosynthesis pathway. These findings may lead to the development of new treatments for inflammation-related diseases.\nKEYWORDS\npolyene pyrone, streptomyces, biosynthesis, polyketide, anti-neuroinflammatory\n1. Introduction\nPyridinopyrones were a class of natural products containing a pyrone ring and a pyridine ring linked by polyene chains. They were initially isolated frommarine-derived streptomyces by the Fenical group (Fukuda et al., 2011). The structure of pyridinopyrones bears a substantial similarity to the aromatic polyene pyrones, which exhibit remarkable biological properties, including cytotoxicity (Clark et al., 2006; Hua et al., 2013b), anti-inflammatory effects (Hua et al., 2013a), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibition (Lin et al., 2016) among others. The biosynthesis studies of aromatic polyene showed that it is produced by a modular type 1 PKS pathway (Peng et al., 2019). The broad range of bioactivities and the interesting biosynthesis studies associated with these compounds has sparked considerable interest in exploring new aromatic polyene pyrones.\nMolecular networking has emerged as an efficient tool in natural product discovery to identify typically clustered compounds (Yang et al., 2013; Quinn et al., 2017). It involves using mass spectrometry to identify molecules in complex biological systems, especially in microbes (Watrous et al., 2012). In this process, compounds with similar structural features\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 01 frontiersin.org\nare grouped into a network based on the mass-to-charge ratio of their ionized forms (Schmid et al., 2021). Consequently, compound clusters are identified within the network, and these groups can then be further investigated to determine their chemical structures and biological activities. The approach has been used to discover bioactive compounds, such as antibiotics, from microbial sources (Nothias et al., 2018). Moreover, this technique has shown great promise in improving the efficiency of natural product discovery. Its application is expected to lead to the discovery of numerous bioactive compounds.\nThrough our ongoing effort to explore new compounds from Streptomyces (Tang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019, 2020; She et al., 2021), our research group has investigated the secondary metabolisms of the strain Streptomyces sulphureus DSM 40104 and uncovered four new pyridinopyrones with the guild of molecular networking analysis. Furthermore, we have investigated the antineuroinflammatory potential of the new pyridinopyrones."

            "text": "Based on the six fractions (A, B, E5, F4, G5, and G6), we have constructed a molecular network with hundreds of grouped compounds (Supplementary Figure S1). Among these, one of the groups with a molecular weight of approximately 322 attracted our attention. Further analysis of the molecular weight of these compounds, we have identified a rare kind of compound named pyridinopyrones (Figure 1). Until now, only four of these compounds have been reported (Fukuda et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2012). The chemical structure of this compound is characterized by a combination of a pyrone ring and a pyridine ring, with a polyene chain connecting the two rings. Compared with HRMS data from the previously published references, the molecular network exhibits more pyridinopyrones analogously connected to the same cluster. With the guide of molecular networking, we investigated the fractions that may possess new pyridinopyrones and identified six compounds.\nPyridinopyrone E (1) was isolated by semi-preparation HPLC as an amorphous yellow solid. The molecular formula was determined to be C18H17NO3 ([M+H] + m/z 296.1273) based on high-resolution ESIMS, indicating 11 degrees of unsaturation. The UV absorption of 380 nm indicated that the high degree of unsaturation might be due to the extended conjugated group. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 showed one methyl (\u03b4H 2.01, s), one methoxy (\u03b4H 3.84, s), and 11 olefinic/aromatic methine signals. The 13C NMR spectrum displayed 18 resolved signals, which were\nclassified as one methyl (\u03b4C 12.4), one methoxy (\u03b4C 56.5), 11 sp 2 methine, and five quaternary carbons, including two oxygenated carbons and one ester carbonyl (Table 1).\nThe 1H\u20131H COSY NMR data assigned two partial structures,\nH-7/H-8/H-9/H-10/H-11 and H-4 \u2032 /H-5 \u2032 /H-6 \u2032 . Considering the chemical shifts and vicinal coupling information, the moiety of H7/H-8/H-9/H-10/H-11 was established as a triene unit. Analysis of HMBC spectrum data gave further connected information about these two moieties. The correlation of H-6 \u2032 (\u03b4H 8.44) to C-2 \u2032\n(\u03b4C 148.3), H-5 \u2032 (\u03b4H 7.39) to C-3 \u2032 (\u03b4C 132.6), and H-2 \u2032 (\u03b4H 8.69) to C-4 \u2032\n(\u03b4C 132.7) indicated the existence of a pyridine ring. The cross-\npeaks from H-4 \u2032\n(\u03b4H 7.95) to C-11 (\u03b4C 130.9), H-11 (\u03b4H 6.79) to\nC-2 \u2032 , and H-10 (\u03b4H 7.27) to C-3 \u2032 revealed the connection of triene moiety to the pyridine ring at position 3 \u2032 . The HMBC correlations from H-2 (\u03b4H 5.65) to C-1 (\u03b4C 162.6), C-3 (\u03b4C 171.0), and C-4 (\u03b4C 99.0), from H-4 (\u03b4H 6.33) to C-3, and C-5 (\u03b4C 159.9) suggested the connective of C-1 to C-5 (Figure 2). The downfield chemical shift of C-5 indicated the connection of oxygen atoms. Thus, the existence of a pyrone unit in 1 was confirmed. The HMBC correlation from the 3-OCH3 protons to C-3 supported the connective of a methoxy group to pyrone at C-3. Further HMBC correlations from H-7 (\u03b4H 7.07) to C-5, H-4 (\u03b4H 6.33) to C-6, and 6-CH3 (\u03b4H 2.01) to C-5, C-6, and C-7 indicated the triene unit was linked at the C-5 position of the pyrone ring and the methyl group was connected at C-6. The triene unit was assigned all E geometrical configurations from the coupling constants (J10, 11 = 15.8) and by comparison with similar compounds. Overall, the chemical structure of compound 1 was determined, as shown in Figure 3.\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Chemical structure of compounds (1\u20136).\nFIGURE 4 Gene organization of the pyridinopyrones (pyi) BGC (1\u20136).\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 06 frontiersin.org\nPyridinopyrone F (2) was obtained as an amorphous yellow solid. Based on HRESIMS data, the molecular weight of 2 was 322.1440, and molecular formula was characterized as C20H19NO3, which was exactly the same as the pyridinopyrone A. By comparison of all 1D NMR data of compound 2 with that from pyridinopyrone A, the difference between these two compounds was the methyl group location. The 2D NMR spectra data of 2 showed the existence of pyridine and an \u03b1-pyrone ring. The crosspeak of H-6/H-7/H-8/H-9/H-10/H-11/H-12/H-13 observed in the 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum indicated the existence of a tetraene group (Figure 2).

The attachment of methyl groups at C-2 was confirmed by the HMBC correlations of 2-CH3 (\u03b4H 1.81) protons to C-1 (\u03b4C 163.4), C-2 (\u03b4C 100.8), and C-3 (\u03b4C 165.9). The 3-OCH3 (\u03b4H 3.90) protons to C-3 (\u03b4C 56.8) indicated the linkage of the methoxy group at the C-3 position. The tetraene unit was assigned all E geometrical configurations base on the coupling constants (J6,7 = 15.2, J12,13 = 15.8) and the comparison with similar compounds.\nPyridinopyrone G (3) was obtained as an amorphous yellow solid with the HRESIMS [M+H]+ m/z 336.1595 (calculated for C21H21NO3, 336.1600). The molecular weight of 3 was exactly the same as pyridinopyrone C. By comparison of the 1D and 2D NMR data, we found that the difference between 3 and pyridinopyrone C was the position of one methyl group. The HMBC correlations of 6-CH3 (\u03b4H 2.07) protons to C-5 (\u03b4C 158.7) and C-7 (\u03b4C 130.8) confirmed the attachment of methyl at the C-6 position (Figure 2). Thus, the structure of 3 was determined, as shown in Figure 3.\nPyridinopyrone H (4) was isolated as an amorphous yellow solid. The molecular formula was determined as C20H19NO3 based on the HRESIMS of [M+H]+ m/z 322.1440. The 1D and 2D NMR spectra data showed that the structure of 3 was the same as compound 2 except for the methyl group\u2019s position. The olefinic methine signal at \u03b4 5.62 and the HMBC correlations of H-2 (\u03b4H 5.62) to C-1 (\u03b4C 162.6) and C-3 (\u03b4C 170.9) indicated the absence of the methyl group at C-2 (Figure 2). The HMBC correlation of 6-CH3 (\u03b4H 2.00) to the C-5 (\u03b4C 160.0) and C6 (\u03b4C 126.5) confirmed the position of the methyl group at C-6. Overall, the structure of 4 was determined, as shown in Figure 3.\nCompounds 5 and 6 were determined to be pyridinopyrones C and D (Fukuda et al., 2011; Hou et al., 2012), respectively, based on the analysis of NMR spectra and comparison of literature.\nThe structure of pyridinopyrones showed substantial similarity to polyene pyrones which are rare in bacteria rather than fungi (Clark et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2016). In the case of these polyenylpyrroles, the end of the group is pyrrole or furan rather than pyridine. The biosynthesis pathway of the pyridinopyrones was studied by the Fenical group through initial labeling studies. The result showed\nthat the pyridinopyrones were derived from acetate-extended nicotinic acid and produced by an iterative PKS (Fukuda et al., 2011; Woerly et al., 2014). We have examined the draft genome data of strain DSM 40104 and gotten 27 gene clusters (Supplementary Table S1). Among these gene clusters, a hybrid modular type 1 polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPs) gene cluster attracted our attention. There are 36 open reading frames (ORFs) in this gene cluster, including five PKS genes, a non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) gene, four regulators, two transporters, and 24 dispersed genes (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S2).\nThe biosynthesis pathway of pyridinopyrones was proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis and the literature comparison. The hybrid gene cluster pyi was proposed to be responsible for the production of pyridinopyrones. The adenylation (A-) domain was unique, and there were no specific amino acid residues can be recognized by this A-domain base on the blasted analysis (Supplementary Figure S5). We proposed that the nicotinic acid might be activated by the A-domain as a starter unit and loaded onto the peptidyl carrier (PCP-) domain. The activated nicotinic acid was propagated by five PKS modules with acyltransferase (AT) domain selecting and loading the malonyl extender unit. The polyketide chain is passed from one module to another until it is released by the thioesterase (TE) domain (Figure 5A). The isolated pyridinopyrones possess different chain lengths indicating the different number of modules adopted during the process. Compound 1 was released from modular five, and compounds 2\u20136 were released from modular six by forming the pyrone ring (Figure 5B). The following oxidation and methylation lead to the final production of 1\u20136.\nThe proposed biosynthesis pathway showed low similarity with the known gene clusters. The A-domain is responsible for recruiting the amino acid monomers, which could be used to predict the putative substrates (Niquille et al., 2018). The nicotinic acid as a start unit in the NRPS module is interesting. The loss of single-domain function in modular 4 and 5 alter the final chemical structure of the products (Peng et al., 2019). The function of ketoreductase (KR) in module 4 and the dehydrogenase (DH) in module 5 were inactive (Supplementary Figures S3, S4), influencing the degree of \u03b2-keto processing.\nFrontiers inMicrobiology 08 frontiersin.org\nThe pyridinopyrones bear a substantial similarity to the polyenylpyrroles and the polyenylfurans, which have been reported to possess anti-HIV activity (Zhong et al., 2022), cytotoxic activity (Clark et al., 2006), and cytoprotective activity (Yamagishi et al., 1993). Given these literature reports, we have tested the antibacterial activity, taking vancomycin as a positive control. However, all test compounds showed no antibacterial activity in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.\nIn addition, we have conducted the anti-neuroinflammatory activity of compounds 1\u20133. The result showed that compounds 1\u20133 exhibited significant anti-neuroinflammatory activity against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced BV-2 cell inflammation at a concentration of 50\u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S6). We further detected the inhibition of the NO production of all three new pyridinopyrones at different concentrations. The IC50 value of compounds 1\u20133 was 8.384\u00b5M, 7.739\u00b5M, and 10.28\u00b5M, respectively (Figure 6). The dexamethasone (DXMS) was considered a positive control with an IC50 value of 6.854\u00b5M (Supplementary Figure S7).\nIn conclusion, our study examined the chemical composition of compounds produced by S. sulphureus DSM 40104. With the assistance of molecular networking analysis, we were able to isolate and identify six unique structural characteristics of compounds. Among these were four newly discovered pyridinopyrones.We also conducted a genomic analysis to propose the possible biosynthesis pathway for pyridinopyrones. This hybrid NRPS-PKS pathway was found to have an unusual A-domain that can recognize nicotinic acid. Furthermore, we discovered that compounds 1\u2013 3 exhibited significant anti-neuroinflammatory activity against the LPS-induced BV-2 cell inflammation. Overall, our findings demonstrate the diversity of polyene pyrone compounds regarding the chemical structure and bioactivity while providing new insights into their biosynthesis pathway."
