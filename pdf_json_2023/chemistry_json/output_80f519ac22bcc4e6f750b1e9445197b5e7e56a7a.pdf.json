    "abstractText": "Purine analogues are important therapeutic tools due to their affinity to enzymes or receptors that are involved in critical biological processes. In this study, new 1,4,6-trisubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic potential was been studied. The new derivatives were prepared through suitable arylhydrazines, and upon successive conversion first to aminopyrazoles, they were converted then to 1,6-disubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4ones; this served as the starting point for the synthesis of the target compounds. The cytotoxic activity of the derivatives was evaluated against several human and murine cancer cell lines. Substantial structure activity relationships (SARs) could be extracted, mainly concerning the 4-alkylaminoethyl ethers, which showed potent in vitro antiproliferative activity in the low \u03bcM level (0.75\u20134.15 \u03bcM) without affecting the proliferation of normal cells. The most potent analogues underwent in vivo evaluation and were found to inhibit tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model. The novel compounds exhibited no systemic toxicity; they affected only the implanted tumors and did not interfere with the immune system of the animals. Our results revealed a very potent novel compound which could be an ideal lead for the discovery of promising anti-tumor agents, and could also be further explored for combination treatments with immunotherapeutic drugs.",

Among them, pyrazolopyrimidine and the closely related pyrazolopyridine pharmacophores are present in druggable small molecule entities, marketed drugs, such as Allopurinol, Zaleplon, Sildenafil, Ibrutinib, and compounds such as Etazolate, that undergo clinical evaluation (Figure 1). Several pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-based derivatives that bear diverse substitutions were reported to exhibit potent antiviral [1,2] and antibacterial [3,4] properties; to inhibit important enzymes, such as phosphodiesterase-4 [5], or neutrophil elastase [6]; and to serve as ligands for A1-adenosine [7] or prostaglandin E2 receptor 1 [8]. The anti-cancer potential of this class of compounds is of particular interest as they show antiproliferative activity,\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 787. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030787 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 787 2 of 18\napoptosis induction, and angiogenesis inhibition [9\u201311], albeit through diverse molecular targets and mechanisms of action, such as targeting tubulin polymerization [12] and protein kinase signal transduction in cancer cells [10,13\u201315].

In this respect, we have previously reported on numerous\npyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridines with potent antiproliferative activity, bearing suitable substitu-\nents at critical positions of the central scaffold [18,19]. We observed that the most interest-\ning compounds possessed a 3-aryl group and were also substituted at positions 5 and/or\n7 of the original pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine nucleus. As a continuation of this effort we have\ndesigned, synthesized, and evaluated the cytotoxic activity of a new series of compounds\nwhich bear the pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine ring system as their central core.

We have also evaluated the effi-\ncacy of our newly synthesized analogues in vitro, and the three most promising among\nthe new compounds were subsequently evaluated in an orthotopic syngeneic mouse\nmodel of breast cancer, prompted by our in vitro results.\nFigure 1.

Each hydrazine was converted to the corresponding pyrazole-4-carbonitriles (2a,b) [26,27], and then, upon hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation, converted to the pyrazoles 3a,b following a previously reported methodology [20,28]. The above mentioned pyrazoles were then treated with the Meldrum\u2019s acid dimethythiomethylene-derivative 4 [29] to provide the intermediate dioxanediones 5a,b. The remaining methylthio group of compounds 5a,b were then displaced upon reaction with aniline, and the derived dioxanediones 6a,b were subjected to thermal cyclization and converted to the pyrazolopyridinols 7a,b. The pyridinones 7a,b were treated with K2CO3 and suitable bromides to provide the corresponding ethers through their enolates 8a\u2013f. The unambiguous confirmation for the O-alkylation was evidenced from 2D NMR data.

This screening provided very interesting information concerning the structural requirements for activity. The majority of the compounds did not exhibit significant activity; they possessed IC50 values greater than 10 \u00b5M, with the remarkable exception of two couples of analogously substituted derivatives, specifically, 9b,c and 9e,f. The latter were endowed with low \u00b5M activity in the IC50 range of 0.75\u20134.55 \u00b5M (Table 1). All four compounds are 4-alkylaminoethoxy derivatives, providing an indication that the presence of a 4-arylaminoether, a 4-arylalkyl or 4-alkyl ether do not encourage activity. This is also true in the case of pyrazolopyridinones 7a,b, the corresponding thiones 10a,b, and the 4-unsubstituted analogues 11a,b. These active analogues were subsequently tested against two additional cancer cell lines and one non-cancerous murine cell line. The first murine cancer cell line, EO771, is a breast cancer cell line, syngeneic to C57/Bl6; the second cell line, KPC, is a pancreas cancer cell line, syngeneic to C57/Bl6.

Three compounds were found non-toxic (9b, 9c and 9e, presenting IC50 >200 \u00b5M), and the fourth showed severe cytotoxicity with an IC50 = 11.2 \u00b5M. Figure 2 depicts the comparison of the IC50 curves of the selected 9b (Figure 2A), 9c (Figure 2B), 9e (Figure 2C), and 9f (Figure 2D) in mouse embryonic cells and EO771 mouse breast cancer cell. The difference in the cell viability between those cell lines indicate possible anti-breast cancer efficacy of these compounds and minimal off target effects. It is noteworthy that those compounds were not as effective in reducing the cell proliferation of the KPC mouse pancreatic cell line, suggesting possible breast cancer specificity. Based on our in vitro data, we decided to investigate the efficacy of 9b, 9c, and 9e in vivo in our tumor bearing EO771 mouse model. Only 9f was excluded from the subsequent in vivo experiments because of its low IC50 values on the MEFs, so that potential increased toxicity or lethality to the experimental animals could be avoided."

            "text": "In this work, a number of substituted pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines were prepared and tested for their antiproliferative activity. We decided not to alter the nature of the substituent in positions 1 and 6 of the scaffold; thus, we inserted 1-phenyl or 1-(3-fluorophenyl) group together with 6-phenylamino group in all target compounds. In total, we used a variety of 4-substituents and have studied their impact on the biological activity. Interestingly, the in vitro evaluation revealed that only 4-alkylaminoethoxy derivatives possessed strong cytotoxicity against the four cancer cell lines tested in the low \u00b5M range, while the normal cell line (normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts) remains practically unaffected. This finding prompted us to study the in vivo efficacy of the three most active analogues in a mouse breast cancer model. All compounds, and more profoundly, the 4-(4-methylpiperazin1-yl)ethoxy derivative 9b, presented a strong inhibition of tumor growth and induced apoptosis. It should be noted that these compounds do not show systemic toxicity and did not interfere with the immune system of the animals. More comprehensive structure\u2013 activity relationships, e.g., the necessity of the 1-phenyl (or fluorophenyl) substituent, as well as of the 6-phenylamino group, is currently under active investigation in our laboratories, with the aim of assisting in structure optimization and elucidating the molecular mode of action of this class of compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030787/s1, Certain synthetic procedures for intermediate compounds and spectroscopic data for all target compounds are provided.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: N.P., P.M., N.L. and D.S.; Synthesis, purification and characterization of compounds: M.G. and N.L.; in vitro cytotoxicity experiments against PC-3 and HCT116 cells: K.G. and R.T.; histology experiments: E.D. and S.B.; in vitro (EO771, KPC, MEF cells), in vivo experiments: L.-E.G. and D.S.; formal analysis: M.G., K.G., N.L., S.B., L.-E.G. and E.D.; data curation: S.B., R.T., N.P., P.M., N.L. and D.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.T., N.P., P.M., N.L. and D.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.P., P.M. and D.S.; supervision, R.T., N.L. and D.S.; project administration, P.M.
