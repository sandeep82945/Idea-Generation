MSU crystals volume at each MTP joint was measured using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) images. The degree of bone erosion was evaluated with the modified Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) erosion scoring system based on CT images. Differences in clinical features between patients with (UD group) and without (non-UD group) UDwere assessed, and the correlation between erosion scores and urate crystal volume was analyzed.\nResults: The UD and non-UD groups comprised 30 and 26 patients, respectively. Among the 560 MTP joints assessed, 80 showed MSU crystal deposition, and 108 showed bone erosion. Bone erosion occurred in both groups but was significantly less severe in the non-UD group (p <0.001). Both groups had equivalent levels of serum uric acid (p=0.200). Symptom duration was significantly longer in the UD group (p=0.009). The UD group also had a higher rate of kidney stones (p=0.023). The volume of MSU crystals was strongly and positively associated with the degree of bone erosion (r=0.714, p <0.001).\nConclusion: This study found that patients with UD show significant increased bone erosion than those without UD. The volume of MSU crystals is associated with the improved SvdH erosion score based on CT images, regardless of serum uric acid level, demonstrating the potential of combining DECT and serum uric acid measurements in helping optimize the management of patients with gout.\nKEYWORDS\ngout, dual-energy computed tomography, urate deposition, bone erosion, serum uric acid\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Gout is a disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which can lead to erosive destructive arthropathies and even disability (1\u20133). Tophus is considered the strongest risk factor for joint damage (4), and the gold standard for gout diagnosis is the microscopic identification of MSU crystals in tophi or joint synovial fluid aspirations (5). The deposition of MSU crystals results from high serum urate concentration and exceeds the physiological saturation point. Serum uric acid level is an indicator for the diagnosis of gout and evaluation of the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) (5, 6). However, a one-time measurement of serum uric acid levels cannot accurately reflect disease severity or changes in bone structure with ULT. Furthermore, the current methods for the identification and evaluation of gout are invasive. Serum uric acid is a dynamic metabolite that can be affected by ULT (7). Therefore, a noninvasive, stable, and reproducible method is needed to detect and evaluate MSU crystals and bone erosion.\nIn clinical practice, radiology is employed to non-invasively detect bone erosion and MSU crystals in patients with gout (8, 9). The currently used Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) scoring method for bone erosion is based on plain radiography and was proposed in 1971 (10). However, plain radiography has limitations, as it does not show erosions or tophi until the disease has progressed to a relatively late stage, and variations in joint positioning can affect the assessment (11, 12). Computed tomography (CT) provides threedimensional information for more accurate assessments of erosions in the foot without the shortcoming of plain radiography, but it cannot characterize crystal depositions (13). Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is a developed CT method that allows for the detection of bone erosion, as well as the specific detection and volume measurement of urate crystals (14). Therefore, the classification criteria recommended by the 2015 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) endorsed DECT as a novel and effective diagnostic tool for gout (5).\nBone erosion is a strong predictor of musculoskeletal disability in gout (15); therefore, early detection and assessment are critical in reducing the risk of joint functional disability. Over the past decade, radiology has been used to investigate the relationship between MSU crystals and bone erosion (16\u201319). Jin et al. (18) employed a novel semi-quantitative DECT scoring system to assess urate deposition (UD) and demonstrate that total urate was associated with bone erosion. Mark et al. (16) utilized a plain radiographerosion score and urate volume from DECT to demonstrate that tophus urate was directly associated with erosion. However, their methods were rather not highly sensitive and precise. To the best of our knowledge, no study has assessed erosion using the SvdH scores based on CT images. Therefore, investigating the relationship between the volume of MSU crystals and degree of bone erosion (bone destruction) based on CT imaging could be of great value in the prevention and early detection of gout progression and joint disability.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 02\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the influence of tophus in the development of bone destruction and to investigate the relationship between the volume of MSU crystals and bone erosion using the improved SvdH score based on CT images."

These findings provide context for recent studies investigating the mechanisms of bone damage in gout.

Additionally, cells within and around the tophus produce cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and other mediators that foster an inflammatory environment conductive to bone and joint damage (3). Innate and adaptive immune cells, including macrophages, mast cells, T and B cells, and plasma cells, have been identified within tophi (24). These studies strongly suggest that the process of gouty bone erosion is complex, with multicellular and multifactorial involvement. Moreover, the SvdH erosion scoring system, which is based on plain radiography images, is mostly used. This study found excellent inter-observer agreement for the modified SvdH erosion scoring system based on CT images, which suggests that the modified scoring system performed well on CT images.\nWith or without UD, bone destruction was detected in the MTP joints in this study. The UD group exhibited severer bone erosion, while small bone erosion (scored 1 or 2) was also observed in the non-UD group. This may be due to the limited detectability of DECT imaging, which may have missed tiny MSU crystals with a diameter less than 2 mm. Another possible reason for the small bone erosion is the effect of ULT. MSU crystals may have been deposited in the MTP joints before the treatment, but gradually dissolved with the course of the treatment (25, 26).\nInterestingly, in contrast to a previous study by Nicola et al. (27), the serum uric acid levels were equivalent in both groups in this study. The reason for this difference may be that 100% of the patients received ULT in this study, whereas only 82% of the patients in the gout group received ULT in the aforementioned study. Therefore, there was no correlation between MSU crystals deposition, bone destruction, and serum uric levels. The\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 07\nrelationship found in this study between serum uric acid and MSU crystal deposition is consistent with previous research (18, 28, 29). To dissolve MSU crystals and reduce clinical symptoms, guidelines worldwide consistently recommend the use of ULT to maintain serum uric acid levels \u2264530 mmol/L (6, 30). However, it is difficult to assess changes in MSU deposition and bone destruction by simply measuring serum uric acid levels during clinical management because serum uric acid is a dynamic metabolite that is susceptible to the effects of drugs and diet. DECT imaging provides good reproducibility and validity (31), and is a reliable and intuitive approach for monitoring MSU deposits and observing the remode l ing or expans ion of bone eros ion for gout management (32).\nThe statistically significant difference in symptom duration and history of kidney stones between the UD and non-UD groups may account for the lengthy process of tophus formation and MSU deposition in the kidneys. Tophus, a pathognomonic and hallmark feature of advanced gout that comprises MSU crystals and chronic granulomatous tissue (21, 33), typically occurs in people with gout for over 10 years (34). The most common cause of hyperuricemia is reduced renal excretion (2), which leads to MSU crystal deposits in the kidneys (35).\nAlthough the SvdH erosion scoring system is typically used on radiography images, there was an excellent inter-observer agreement for the modified SvdH erosion scoring system based on CT images. This ensured that the modified scoring system performs well with CT images. The modified SvdH-CT erosion score was proposed in this study to detect the correlation between MSU crystal volume and erosion. This updated scoring method yielded performance consistent with that of the Rheumatoid\nfrontiersin.org\nArthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score system or Dalbethsimplified score (29, 36) and better performance than plain radiography erosion scores (16, 36).\nThis study has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study that focused only on patients with foot joint deconstruction in the MTP joints. Therefore, the results may not reflect the overall clinical situation of all gout patients, especially for those with less severe MTP joint destruction and severe joint destruction on other sites. Second, the sample size was relatively small. Third, this study was conducted in a single institution. Fourth, this scoring system performed only in MTP joints. Lastly, the study had a crosssectional design, which means that the association between bone erosion and changes in MSU crystal volume could not be verified. Future studies comprising more joints (such as tarsometatarsal joints, ankle joints and knee joints) and a multi-center longitudinal study with a larger sample size will be conducted to validate the present findings.\nTo summarize, the correlation between urate volume measured from DECT images and bone erosion were evaluated. There was no correlation between MSU crystals, bone destruction, and serum uric acid. DECT can effectively monitor MSU deposits and observe changes in bone erosion, and this can be considered as a supplement to serum uric acid measurement in clinical practice to improve the prognostic evaluation of patients with gout and guide follow-up as well as individualized treatment plans."
