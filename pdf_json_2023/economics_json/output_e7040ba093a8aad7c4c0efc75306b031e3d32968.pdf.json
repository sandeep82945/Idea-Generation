In order to develop policies that successfully decrease this burden, the factors a ecting costs need to be fully understood. Evidence suggests that early-stage BC has a lower cost than a late stage BC. We aim to provide conservative estimates of BC\u2019s stage-wise medical costs from German healthcare and the payer\u2019s perspective. To this end, we conducted a literature review of articles evaluating stage-wise costs of BC in Germany through PubMed, Web of Science, and Econ Lit databases supplemented by Google Scholar. We developed a decision tree model to estimate BC-related medical costs in Germany using available treatment and cost information. The review generated seven studies; none estimated the stage-wise costs of BC. The studies were classified into two groups: case scenarios (five studies) and two studies based on administrative data. The first sickness funds data study (Gruber et al., 2012) used information from the year 1999 to approach BC attributable cost; their results suggest a range between e3,929 and e11,787 depending on age. The second study (Kreis, Pl\u00f6thner et al., 2020) used 2011\u20132014 data and suggested an initial phase incremental cost of e21,499, an intermediate phase cost of e2,620, and a terminal phase cost of e34,513 per incident case. Our decision tree model-based BC stage-wise cost estimates were e21,523 for stage I, e25,679 for stage II, e30,156 for stage III, and e42,086 for stage IV. Alternatively, the modeled cost estimates are e20,284 for the initial phase of care, e851 for the intermediate phase of care, and e34,963 for the terminal phase of care. Our estimates for phases of care are consistent with recent German estimates provided by Kreis et al. Furthermore, the data collected by sickness funds are collected primarily for reimbursement purposes, where the German ICD-10 classification system defines a cancer diagnosis. As a result, claims data lack the clinical information necessary to understand stage-wise BC costs. Our model-based estimates fill the gap and inform future economic evaluations of BC interventions.\nKEYWORDS\nbreast cancer, stage-wise costs, directmedical costs, modeling, review, stage-specific costs\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Breast cancer (BC) has a tremendous cost to healthcare systems, payers, patients, and society (1). According to the German Bureau of Federal Statistics, direct medical costs related to BC were around e2.17 billion in 2015, surpassing that of lung cancer (2), with around 67,000 new cases diagnosed and more than 18,000 deaths reported every year (3). Nearly one in eight women in Germany develop BC during their lives, and three in every ten women with BC are younger than 55 years of age (3). Mortality is considerably lower in women diagnosed in earlier stages than in advanced stages (4). Around 90% of the women diagnosed at an earlier stage survive for at least 5 years compared to 15% at a late stage (5). Therefore, early detection through BC screening has the potential to save lives. Prominently, BC screening in Germany has significantly reduced late-stage incidence (6). Nevertheless, based on our analysis of the German cancer registry data, there is a lot more room for improvement since a considerable proportion (18%) of new BC patients are still diagnosed in the advanced stages (III and IV) (7).\nIn Germany, BC is the most prevalent type of cancer for women (8). Consequently, the related economic burden surpasses most other cancer types (9). Inpatient care, medication, and productivity losses represent the highest proportion of the economic burden of BC (10). Total Productivity losses associated with BC were estimated at around e1,531 million, while pharmaceutical spending was e777 million in 2009 (10). Although BC costs represent a significant burden for the German healthcare system, information on the development of the healthcare costs after a cancer diagnosis is limited. The lack of information regarding BC\u2019s stage-wise direct medical costs for the German population is particularly concerning. A recent literature review (4) of the stage-wise costs of BC did not identify any analyses that considered German data. In another review of the costs of BC (11), one article evaluated German data but only estimated age-specific BC-attributable health expenditures but did not consider stage-wise costs (12).\nStage-wise treatment costs are essential to understanding the costs and benefits of new health technologies and health programs related to BC. Besides, a central assumption in any screening program is the stage shift mechanism whereby the cancer is diagnosed earlier, supposedly in less advanced stages that are may curable. Studies outside Germany suggest that early-stage cancers tend to have low healthcare costs compared to metastatic (13). The systematic review of Sun et al. (4) showed that directmedical costs are around $54,600 for stage I compared to $127,500 for stage IV. Therefore, economic evaluations of screening programs require the use of stage-specific costs rather than average costs representing all stages. Given that healthcare costs vary considerably among countries (14\u201317), it is necessary\nto establish a basis for the stage-wise costs of BC in the German context.\nOnly a few countries have reported the costs of BC by cancer stage (4); thus, information is limited, presumably due to cost evaluations being resource-intensive, data-scarce, and not accessible primarily related to the stage of the disease. There are two methods of estimating costs: the micro-costing approach and the top-down approach (18). The latter method typically uses macro-level healthcare expenditures. Based on these expenditures and a series of assumptions, estimating the proportion of these macro-level expenditures can be linked to a disease (e.g., using the population diagnosed with breast cancer). Depending on the assumptions, the results of a topdown aproach can vary widely.\nCompared to the top-down method, the micro-costing approach is more reliable. Here costs are computed per patient in the selected sample. The collected information is summarized, and conclusions can be derived regarding average and total costs for the population. To better understand the economic burden of BC and take into account that patients can have multiple comorbidities, it is critical to determine the costs attributable to the diagnosis of BC. Ideally, costs are collected from detection to end-of-life and the estimated costs compared to those of a control group without breast cancer. Instead of a control group, and depending on data availability, the selection of only a subset of costs that are related to the particular diagnosis can be considered.\nDespite being the more consistent method, micro-costing is also more resource-intensive since it requires a rich and detailed database codified (not just using the ICD 10 classification but also with clinical information) so that it is possible to determine BC attributable costs. The costs can be collected based on resource use, unit price, charges (bills), or reimbursement data. The first and the second data sources depend on the selection, follow-up, and recruitment of patients, which can be costly and usually not representative of the entire population that suffers from the disease (e.g., a sample of patients from selected hospitals or a clinical trial). If patients are selected from only one particular geographic area, results might not generalize to the entire population since care costs vary across treatment centers (specialized treatment centers vs. usual care centers) (19). The alternative is to use administrative data from Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). Depending on the population coverage, it can be representative, and, in addition, attributable costs can be estimated. However, in most countries, administrative data is not easy to access, and the use of the information is highly limited by strict confidentiality regulations, as it is in Germany. Furthermore, a critical limitation of most administrative databases is that they do not include or can not be linked to clinical information. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate stage-wise costs based on these data.\nAs real-world data (e.g., administrative data, clinical information for stages) is scarce, a potential alternative\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nis the precise quantification of stage-wise BC costs via a modeling study. Modeling approaches make it possible to model treatment trajectories of each stage and assign costs (20). However, addressing the uncertainty around input parameters, transparency, and validation is needed to strengthen the accuracy of the model results (21). Karnon and Brown (22) suggested that a decision tree or cohort Markov model is sufficient for simple case scenarios (22). However, one should consider the model\u2019s design and feasibility regarding the available information, easy implementation, and computational time (23). While Markov models take into account the passage of time or risk over time, decision trees are well suited for transition at a point in time, very logical, linear, unidirectional, moving from left to right (without forward or backward movement) (24, 25). Hence, the decision tree has an advantage in capturing stage-wise treatment costs since every node represents a treatment option, such as treatment or no treatment.\nGiven the lack of data and the need to understand Germany\u2019s stage-wise costs, we aim to provide conservative estimates of the stage-wise medical costs of BC in Germany. First, we conducted a literature review of articles evaluating stage-wise costs of BC in Germany to ascertain what (if any) research has been published on this topic. Secondly, we proposed a methodology to estimate the stage-wise medical costs of BC in Germany, where we created a decision tree based on available treatment and cost information."

Additionally, the model incorporates the probability and unit cost for diagnosis, chemotherapy-associated adverse events, and psychological care. The unit cost for each care component was extracted from the existing literature.\nWe considered the payer\u2019s perspective and calculated direct medical costs, except for the costs of physician\u2019s visits. Additionally, direct non-medical costs were also estimated (e.g., transportation). The prices were adjusted for inflation for the year 2021 (27).

In addition to the stage, hormone therapy and chemotherapy depend on the hormone receptor status of the patient (Hormone Receptor (HR) +ve, Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor2 (HER2)+ve or HR+ve and HER2+ve, and triple-negative).

However, we only used the results from the most recent years, 2009\u20132010, which we assume reflect current practice (30). Moreover, Schrodi et al. (30) did not specify the stage Information; the authors classified surgical interventions according to primary tumor size categories (Tis, T1, T2, T3, and T4). Therefore, we used 2015 ZfKD data to compute the BC stage corresponding to the tumor size for women\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 05 frontiersin.org\naged 20+. We derived proportions of stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV falling within each tumor size category and assigned surgical procedures accordingly. German cancer registry data shows that 90% of the T3/T4 size tumors appear in stage III and stage IV BC. BCS for T4 tumors is 11.6%; we assumed the same proportion of BCS for stage III and IV tumors appear in T1 and T2 tumor size categories and adjusted proportions of stage I and stage II accordingly (additional information on the estimations is provided in Table 1 and Supplementary material S2, Supplementary Table A5)."

According to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 244 articles were excluded after reviewing the title and abstract and 35 articles after reading the full-text document (See PRISMA diagram; inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Supplementary material S1.1, Supplementary Figure A1).\nSeven articles were costing studies evaluating BC costs in the German context. Out of the seven, five studies (43\u2013 47) used case scenarios based on German S3 BC treatment guidelines and other sources from the literature, and costs were calculated mainly using predefined national tariffs such as the DRG (diagnosis-related groups) for inpatient care, the\nEBM (German Uniform Evaluation Standard) for outpatient care and the Rote Liste for drug prices (43\u201347). These studies reported a BC cost per patient; however, the estimates cannot be linked to the disease stages. Additional information on these five studies based on case scenarios is presented in Supplementary material S1.2.1, Supplementary Tables A.2, A.3.\nAdditionally, out of the seven studies, two (12, 36) used realtime data from SHI (sickness funds) to estimate BC treatment costs from the perspective of the German healthcare system and the payers. These studies used a bottom-up approach for costing. Gruber et al. (12) estimated the BC costs for 1990 and adjusted them for 2010 inflation. They used data from four sickness funds aggregated into two datasets and found that the average annual cost per woman ranges from e6,000 to e10,000. The cost was higher for younger women (about e9,000) than for older (about e3000). Kreis et al. (36) used 2011\u20132014 data from AOK statutory health insurance. They calculated an initial phase incremental cost of e21,498, an intermediate phase cost of e2,620, and a terminal phase cost of e34,513 per incident case. Even though these two studies are based on large sample sizes, limitations hinder the usage of the information. Gruber et al. (12) results are based on over two decades old cost data. Since 1999, significant changes have occurred: technological advancement in BC diagnosis and treatment, population dynamics, the introduction of the BC screening program in 2005, and the DRG flat rate payments in 2004. Therefore, Gruber et al. (12) estimates may no longer reflect today\u2019s costs. Kreis et al. (36) present more recent approximations on the costs of BC, with the advantage of providing estimations by phase of care. However, a significant limitation in both studies is the lack of information about stage-wise costs.\nOverall, the rapid review suggests a lack of information about the stage-wise costs of BC in Germany since we could not find a single relevant study that provides an estimation. Additionally, the review indicates that sickness funds collect their data with a strong emphasis on the German ICD-10 classification, which cannot be translated to stage-wise cost without additional pertinent clinical information such as tumor size at detection and lymph node involvement.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 09 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Estimated stage-wise medical cost of BC per patient in Germany for the year 2015 (in Euros, 2021 prices).

The estimated cost per incident case was e25,932 per patient, and the average expected cost of invasive BC per patient during the initial and terminal care was e20,284 and e34,963, respectively. The results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 3. As expected, the costs increased with the stage of\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org\nthe disease, where patients in Stage IV had the highest costs. The high costs estimated for metastatic BC patients are due to the impact of end-of-life treatment costs. The treatment costs for late-stage BC (Stage III and Stage IV) are 53% higher than early BC (stage I and II), Stage II is 19.3%, stage III is 40.1%, and stage IV is 95% higher than the costs in stage I.\nA significant increase in the cost between stages was observed during the initial phase of care (curative phase, first 11 months). On average, the model estimated the average expected costs are 17.8, 36.5, and 95.9% higher for stages II, III, and IV compared to stage I. The same pattern was observed in the terminal phase of care between stages I through IV. The cost drivers are mainly surgery and chemotherapy, contributing 61% of the total cost of care, while palliative care contributed 15% of the total cost of care.\nThe model estimated the total medical cost of BC in Germany is e1.824 billion for incident cases in 2015. The model estimated value is lower than that provided by the Federal Statistics Office, which reported BC cost of illness of around e2.15 billion in 2015 (e2.34 billion, adjusted to 2021) for the female population (See Supplementary material S3, Supplementary Table A7)."

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to estimate the stage-wise medical costs of BC considering the German context, including a review of current literature. The review indicated an inherent limitation in collecting sickness funds data, which hinders the estimation of stagewise costs. The data is collected for reimbursement purposes; therefore, diagnosis is mentioned based on the German ICD10 classification. Thus, claims data lack the clinical information for tumor size and lymph-node involvement necessary to understand BC costs by disease stage (4). Furthermore, the patient-level primary data collection to estimate stage-wise cost is resource-intensive and not feasible across the country. To fill this gap, we build a decision tree model that combines information from the RKI, clinical guidelines, published literature, and unit costs from the KBV. We estimated that the mean BC medical costs were e21,845 in stage I, e25,753 in stage II, e29,825 in stage III, and e42,796 in stage IV. We also report estimations regarding the average cost per patient (e26,107) and per phase (initial e20,384 and terminal e35,125). Although the model estimates for the costs of BC are close to those previously published for the German context (36, 43, 47), this does not necessarily guarantee that the stagewise medical costs estimated reflect the actual costs. Because of the heterogeneity in the model inputs, actual costs cannot be assessed accurately. Micro-costing studies remain a more reliable method to estimate costs. Since SHI data are collected for non-scientific purposes, especially billing, they are frequently used for costing studies. Therefore, in order to get stage-wise cost, it is highly recommended that SHI data should be linked with German cancer registry data. However, the data linkage approval process is challenging in Germany due to stringent data protection laws and the engagement of several authorities, making the approval process challenging. An alternative would be collecting clinical data (stage at diagnosis) by the SHI agencies so that cost information can be linked to the BC stages resulting in stage-wise BC costs.\nNevertheless, compared with European studies (15, 17, 48), the model estimated stage-wise cost aligns with the Belgium study (48) conducted in 2015 assessing direct medical costs. The study estimated the mean cost of DCIS, stages I, II, and III to be e9,063, e17,624, e25,209, and e30,985 (2021 prices). However, the data in this study (48) was limited to one hospital and 107 patients (only two patients in stage IV). On the contrary, we observed a higher mean stage-wise cost\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nin our estimations compared to Italian (15) and Portuguese studies (17, 49). That could be mainly because these studies did not explicitly include end-of-life care and have a shorter follow-up period that potentially underestimates the cost of end-of-life care. However, their results are consistent with our results regarding the percentage increase in advanced-stage cancers compared to stage I costs (see Table 3). Given the heterogeneity in cost structures and the epidemiological factors between and to some extent within countries, BC treatment cost estimates are significantly variable, and their transferability remains questionable.\nThe BC treatment costs are higher in advanced stages, suggesting that screening detection and prevention strategies are central to reducing costs. This study adds substantial evidence to the current literature using reproducible and robust methods, allowing model adjustments for new treatments, mortality rates, disease recurrence, and changes in treatment guidelines (20). Given the recent advancements in personalized oncology, newer diagnostic tools, and targeted medicine, the average and stage-wise cost of care could substantially increase. Therefore, modeling studies may be instrumental in projecting the national medical cost of breast cancer. However, model adjustments and the inclusion of new treatments, recurrent and progressive BC are contingent upon the availability of data.\nResults in our study are susceptible to assumptions regarding the follow-up period. Even if advanced cancer offers poor survival rates, thus assuming a short time horizon having little impact on the mean cost of BC in advanced stages, for early-stage cancers, longer follow-ups are needed to accurately estimate the number of women dying due to BC. That is paramount for estimating end-of-life care costs. Moreover, factoring age and BC survival in the cost model are essential. It is estimated that the overall cost among younger cancer patients is 20% to 50% higher compared to all patients for the initial and terminal phases of care (50). The higher costs may be attributed to the aggressive BC care in young women because they are more likely to be diagnosed with BC stages\nII and III (stage 2 BC: 44.3 vs. 29.9%, respectively; stage 3 BC: 14.0 vs. 7.7%, respectively), triple-negative BC (21.2 vs. 13.8%, respectively), and HER2-positive (HER2+: 26.0 vs. 18.6%, respectively) compared to middle-aged women (50, 51). Therefore, future studies should consider age while estimating stage-wise costs.\nWe recognize that the modeling study is subject to limitations. First, the model only accounts for incident cases. Therefore, the cost of surveillance, mainly governed by prevalent BC (314, 546; 5-years prevalence in 2015) (8) cases, is underestimated. For example, the model estimates of the intermediate phase (e851) are inconsistent with Kreis et al. (36) estimates of e2,528. Also, the model estimate of e1.81 billion in medical costs of BC incident cases for 2015 is not in line with the overall economic burden (e2.15 billion in costs for female BC cases in Germany in 2015) (2). Second, the German cancer registry does not provide information on BC progression, recurrence, or associated treatment pathways. This resulted in the model being unable to account for recurrence and progression costs. Consequently, the costs associated with intermediate phase and stages were underestimated. Third, the modeling study relied on multiple data sources to estimate stage-wise costs, and the approach is prone to uncertainties and variability. Fourth, a modeling study could not reflect the heterogeneity and complexity of the management of BC in different health settings (e.g., specialized BC treatment centers vs. usual healthcare settings). Nonetheless, in the absence of documented clinical information needed to estimate stage-wise costs, these modeling methods could offer feasible estimates of the cost of care."

This affects cost estimations for not only BC but also all types of cancer. Therefore, we cannot estimate the reduction in the cost of care due to early detection by stage shift and the cost-effectiveness of screening programs.\nUntil the German data adequately address the lack of information regarding stages and associated costs. The conservative estimates from the model presented here can be used for future economic evaluations. Considering the increasing cost burden of cancers, and the need of efficient cancer screening programs, our study underscores the importance of understanding the importance stage-wise costs of BC mainly from the economic evaluation perspective.
