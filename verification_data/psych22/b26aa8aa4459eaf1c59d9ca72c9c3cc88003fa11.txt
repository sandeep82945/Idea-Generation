"The current research contributes to a growing body of literature that focuses on families with children with ASD and addresses the support needs of parents in Ontario. The findings from this study provide some understanding of the factors influencing parents’ perception of support; accordingly, many parents focused on the support provided through the OAP and were uncertain about what the proposed program will provide for their families in the future. The presentation of ASD is heterogenous and child-specific (Anagnostou et al., 2014; Gentles et al., 2019), which is an important facet when considering the future of the OAP. The current program is an income and age-based program, meaning that there are restrictions on how much funding families receive and where they can spend the money. This framework has resulted in a one-size-fits-all model of support that does not work for many families. The OAP should consider the individual needs of children and their families and implement a needs-based program."

"Moving forward, it is important to consider how diverse and nondominant groups (e.g., visible minorities, working-class, Immigrants) can be represented in the research process (Antony-Newman, 2019)."

"The current study plays a role in highlighting the support needs of families across Ontario and reinforces that there are still gaps in relation to addressing these needs. This study illustrated the numerous families that access social support while demonstrating the distinct areas that parents are primarily concerned about, such as lengthy waitlists, age-based limitations on funding, and being solely responsible for navigating a confusing service system. While the current findings focus on the experiences of Ontarian parents, their support needs cannot be addressed without the government’s adherence to community engagement and the development of parent-professional relationships."
