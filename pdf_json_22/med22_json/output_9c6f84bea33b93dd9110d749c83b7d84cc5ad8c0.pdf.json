Previous studies have demonstrated that Gyps displayed potent ameliorative effects on liver fibrosis and renal fibrosis. In this study, we found that Gyps significantly reduced the mortality of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice (40%mortality rate of mice in the model group versus 0% in the treatment group). Masson staining showed that Gyps could reduce the content of collagen in the lung tissue of pulmonary fibrosis mice Masson staining and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of the collagen gene \u03b1-SMA and fibrosis gene Col1 markedly decreased after Gyps treatment. The active mitosis of fibroblasts is one of the key processes in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. RNAseq showed that Gyps significantly inhibited mitosis and induced the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. The mTOR/c-Myc axis plays an important role in the pathological process of pulmonary fibrosis. RNA-seq also demonstrated that Gyps inhibited the mTOR and c-Myc signaling in pulmonary fibrosis mice, which was further validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. AKT functions as an upstreammolecule that regulates mTOR. Our western blot data showed that Gyps could suppress the activation of AKT. In conclusion, Gyps exerted anti-pulmonary fibrosis activity by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/c-Myc pathway.\nKeywords: gypenosides, pulmonary fibrosis, AKT, mTOR, c-Myc\nINTRODUCTION\nPulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, progressive, and lethal interstitial lung disease, with a poor prognosis and median survival of 3\u20135 years after diagnosis (Masefield et al., 2019). PF is characterized by inflammation, fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation, and the activation of alveolar epithelial cells with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the lung parenchyma (Wolters et al., 2014). Current pharmacological therapies include glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive drugs, and anti-fibrotic agents; however, none of them can improve the survival of patients with PF (Richeldi et al., 2017). To date, there are only two drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PF: nintedanib and pirfenidone (Yamazaki et al., 2021). These two small molecule drugs target receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)\nEdited by: Jian Gao,\nShanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center, China\nReviewed by: Bin Wu,\nChongqing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China\nJian-ye Zhang, Guangzhou Medical University, China\n*Correspondence: Baojun Liu\nlbj825@163.com Jinfeng Wu wujinfeng21@163.com\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Respiratory Pharmacology,\na section of the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology\nReceived: 31 October 2021 Accepted: 20 December 2021 Published: 14 January 2022\nCitation: Liu S, Yang Q, Dong B, Qi C, Yang T,\nLi M, He S, Liu B and Wu J (2022) Gypenosides Attenuate Pulmonary Fibrosis by Inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/ c-Myc Pathway.\nFront.

Although they can slow down the progression of PF, the high cost and strong toxic effects on the liver and kidneys limit their clinical application (Yang et al., 2019). In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown unique efficacies in the treatment of PF (Chen DQ. et al., 2018). Owing to the characteristics of multi-components, multi-targets, and multilevel interactions, TCM can improve the survival and life quality of the patients with PF disease to a certain extent (Wang et al., 2020).\nThe pathogenesis of PF is not well elucidated (Spagnolo et al., 2021). Increasing evidences showed that the progressive pulmonary scarring and lung function declining induced by the lung epithelial injury and aberrant fibroblast proliferation were involved in the pathogenesis of PF (Martinez et al., 2017). Currently, it is believed that PF originates from the repeated injury and aberrant repair of the alveolar epithelial cells (Sgalla et al., 2018). Repeatedly injured alveolar epithelial cells secrete PF-related growth factors, such as the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1), which activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway through binding to the corresponding receptors on the lung fibroblast membrane, to promote lung fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis and induce the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Phan et al., 2021). As a downstream target of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, excessive activation of mTOR in the alveolar epithelium exacerbates bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF in mice (Cong et al., 2020). Moreover, c-Myc, a star transcription factor in the downstream of mTOR, can stimulate fibroblast proliferation in the presence of growth factors (Lawrence and Nho, 2018).\nGypenosides (Gyps), the saponin extracts of Gynostemma pentaphyllum, have been extensively studied in fibrosis diseases, such as liver fibrosis and renal fibrosis, for their antiinflammatory, anti-fibrotic, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic effects (Nguyen et al., 2021). In this study, we evaluated that Gyps attenuated BLM-induced PF in mice through mediating the AKT/mTOR/c-Myc pathway."

We found eight major components in Gyps, among which ginsenoside Rb1, rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, and gypenoside XLIX have been reported to have anti-fibrotic effects (Hou et al., 2014; Verma et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017; Avila-Carrasco et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Bai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Liu H. et al., 2021). Based on our in vivo data, 40% of PF mice died, while none of the Gyps treated PF mice died. This indicated that Gyps could significantly improve the survival rate of PF mice and had a good promise for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. However, administration of Gyps could not attenuate the effects of BLM on body weight loss in PF mice. It might be because most of the low-weight PF mice died.\nPF is characterized by increased fibroblast proliferation and ECM protein deposition by myofibroblasts under the control of pro-fibrogenic stimuli such as TGF-\u03b21 (Davies et al., 2012). Based on the analysis of RNA-seq, the Gyps-treated group showed the most significant improvement in mitosis and promoted G2/M cell cycle arrest. In the future, the in vitro experiment should be carried out to verify if Gyps could directly inhibit mitosis in pulmonary fibroblasts. It has been reported that some non\u2013SMAD-mediated pathways including PI3K/AKT, RhoA,\nFIGURE 4 | RNA-seq analysis and Hallmark analysis.

PI3K is an intracellular phosphatidylinositol kinase, which has serine/ threonine kinase and phosphatidylinositol kinase activities (Yang et al., 2020). AKT is a serine/threonine kinase and is directly activated in response to PI3K which functions as an important regulator of cell growth, survival, and glucose metabolism (Barrett et al., 2012). Yuan et al. reported that miR-410 induces EMT through activating the PI3K/mTOR pathway in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (Yuan et al., 2020). Recent studies have shown that the phosphorylation of AKT was increased in human pulmonary fibroblasts induced by BLM and was also increased in radiation-induced PF (Ma et al., 2020a; Ma et al., 2020b). The atypical serine/threonine kinase mTOR is the key downstream target molecule of AKT and functions as an important regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and immunity (Hua et al., 2019). c-Myc, a star transcription factor in the downstream of mTOR, can stimulate fibroblast proliferation in the presence of growth factors (Lawrence and Nho, 2018). Decreased c-Myc expression mediated fibronectin and collagen deposition into the extracellular matrix and attenuated cell proliferation in the fibrosis process (Valiente-Alandi et al., 2018). Shin et al. revealed that the AKT inhibitor LY294002 blocked the expressions of p-AKT and c-Myc in HepG2 cells and found that the compound K induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via inhibition of AKT/mTOR/c-Myc signaling\n(Shin et al., 2021). Liu et al. reported Gyps-induced apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma cells through regulating the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR signaling pathway. (Liu H. et al., 2021). In the present study, we demonstrated that Gyps markedly inhibited the AKT/ mTOR/c-Myc pathway in pulmonary fibrosis (Figure 6).\nMany growth factors are upstream regulators of PI3K/AKT signaling, such as CTGF, TGF-\u03b21, and IGF-1, which are reported to be involved in the pathological process of PF. Gyps were reported to protect orbital fibroblasts in Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy via downregulating TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced fibrotic mediators (Li H. et al., 2020). In another study, researchers reported that Gyps ameliorated CCl4-induced liver fibrosis via inhibiting TGF-\u03b21 signaling and consequently inhibiting the differentiation of hepatic progenitor cells into myofibroblasts (Chen et al., 2017). In a unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced tubulointerstitial damage and fibrosis model, the expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and CTGF were significantly reduced by Gyps treatment, and the Smad7 expression was elevated by Gyps treatment (Li Q. et al., 2020). In the future, we will determine if Gyps could affect the upstream regulators of PI3K/AKT signaling in PF.\nEMT, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways are involved in the pathological process of PF (Wolters et al., 2014). EMT is a process in which epithelial cells gradually acquire a mesenchymal (fibroblast-like) cell phenotype (Bartis et al., 2014). A previous study reported that in a repetitive\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 8063127\nbleomycin injury PF model, about 50% of S100A4+ fibroblasts were epithelial-derived using genetic fate tracking (Johnson et al., 2011). It was reported that polyhexamethylene guanidinephosphate infiltrated into the lungs in the form of aerosol particles would induce an airway barrier injury by generating ROS, releasing fibrotic inflammatory cytokines, and triggering a wound-healing response, thus leading to pulmonary fibrosis (Kim et al., 2016). Our RNA-seq data suggested that Gyps had anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-EMT effects (ranked 11, 13, and 14, respectively) in PF mice. Further studies are needed to confirm the above effects of Gyps in PF.\nIn conclusion, we revealed that Gyps attenuated PF development in mice, and the potential mechanism was due to inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/c-Myc axis. Gyps might be a promising candidate drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."
