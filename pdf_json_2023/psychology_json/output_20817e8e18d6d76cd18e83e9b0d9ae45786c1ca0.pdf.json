Despite significant progress regarding the substrate recruitment, unfolding, digestion, and release by IDE, the structure and function of the insulin hexamer during the degradation cycle of IDE remain to be fully characterized. In the present study, we have characterized the behavior of human insulin hexamer in the absence of zinc. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we also observed that these hexamers represented a structure similar to that of T6 insulin. More interestingly, we also observed complexes in which some of their monomeric insulin components are partially distorted at their hexametric symmetry. This ensures that insulin determines the kinetics of its degradation by IDE without the requirement for zinc. These findings provide new information regarding the molecular events in insulin assembly and disassembly that permit its selective digestion by IDE.\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

            "text": "Human insulin is a peptide hormone consisting of 51 amino acids that is produced by the \u03b2-cells of the pancreatic islets. The effects of insulin require the activation of insulin signaling following the binding of ligand to the insulin receptor, which can be characterized by a dose-response curve for the effect of insulin on circulating glucose concentration1. Insulin self-assembles into dimers, three of which combine with two zinc ions to form a 3-fold symmetrical hexamer2,3. X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that the allosteric binding of hexameric insulin can be observed and the hexamer can be present in states that differ according to whether the residual numbers 1 to 6 of the B-chains of monomers exist in a tense (T) or relaxed (R) conformation. A conformational change is induced by the binding of phenol and chloride ligands to switch between R6 (a closed state) 4, T3R3 (a semi-open state) 5, and T6 (an open state) (Fig. 1a)3. Under physiological conditions, insulin is stored as zinc-induced hexamers, which form microcrystals within secretory granules, and ultimately zinc-free monomers are released from \u03b2-cell into the blood6. In the absence of zinc, at 0.2, 1, and 1.5 mM, the self-association statuses of human insulin are 50%, 75%, and 100% hexamer, respectively7,8. A previous study also showed that the proportion of the insulin molecules\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Thus, knowledge of the structure of insulin hexamers is limited to that obtained from crystallographic analyses of zinc-bound insulin, and it remains a great challenge to obtain structural information regarding the complexes formed between insulin molecules in the absence of zinc because of the dynamic and/or transient nature of their interactions.\nInsulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian\ntissues, including in the blood, skeletal muscle, liver, and brain10,11, and is a zinc metalloprotease that hydrolyzes a broad range of bioactive peptides, such as insulin and amyloid , which have diverse sequences and structures, and thereby regulate the amounts of these peptides present in vivo12,13. Therefore, IDE-targeting therapeutics, such as inhibitors, are potential means of improving the regulation of blood glucose and treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)14,15. Extensive studies performed by Tang\u2019s group have provided a molecular basis for the substrate recognition, unfolding, and degradation by IDE16,17. The first published crystal structure of IDE revealed its planar structure, and its overall structure can be divided into two components, N- and C-clusters, which are connected by a short linker. IDE-N and IDE-C join together to form an encapsulated catalytic chamber to bind substrate16-22. The capture of substrate molecules\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Within the catalytic chamber, the interior surface of IDE is composed of specific substrate recognition sites: a catalytic cleft that coordinates a zinc ion, and an exosite that anchors the N-terminus of the substrate. The size of the catalytic chamber (~13,000 A3) prevents IDE from encapsulating peptides of more than ~80 amino acids in size. In addition to its proteolytic function, IDE suppresses the expression level of 140- residue long -synuclein in -cells in a nonproteolytic manner23, resulting in functioning as a chaperone. Despite significant progress in knowledge regarding substrate recruitment, unfolding, digestion, and release by IDE, the structure and function of the insulin hexamer during the catalytic cycle of IDE remain to be fully characterized. In the study presented here, we have demonstrated the characteristic behavior of the human insulin hexamer in the absence of zinc. Importantly, this is associated with resistance against degradation by IDE. Thus, the present study provides insight into the mechanism whereby the oligomerization of human insulin protects against its degradation by IDE in the absence of zinc.\nResults and Discussion\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The Rh, hydrodynamic radius, values for human insulin were increased dose-dependently between 5 M and 80 M (data not shown). When the crystal structures of human insulin were taken into the consideration, we found the Rh to be 1.50 nm as a monomer, 1.93 nm as a dimer, and 2.56 nm as a hexamer. To separate the oligomeric states, we next measured the sedimentation coefficient using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) at various concentrations. At concentrations <10 M, almost all the single histograms had sedimentation coefficients of \u22641 S (Fig. 1b), which correspond to the monomer, based on the findings of the hydrodynamic radius analysis. Of interest, a population at a sedimentation coefficient of ~4 S was also identified with the 50 M concentration of insulin. When the distributions of the oligomeric states were plotted for each concentration between 5 M and 50 M, we found that the higher oligomeric state was more abundant because of a decrease in the number of monomers, despite the absence of zinc (Fig. 1b).\nSubsequently, we investigated the oligomeric properties of human insulin at 50\nM using ESI-MS, and found that there were several oligomeric components, including\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Furthermore, we examined single particle cryo-electron microscopy of oligomeric insulin complexes. Image processing allowed us to visualize converged 2D class average images, showing stable structure with a diameter of about 50 \u00c5, which corresponds to a hexametric complex similar to T6 oligomer (Fig. 1d). In addition, through visual inspection of cryo-EM images, we observed hexametric complex which is partially deformed. This suggests that interactions within hexamers in the absence of zinc are weaker than in the presence of zinc, rendering the structures more dynamic.\nWith respect to the regulation of circulating insulin concentration, IDE has been\nreported to bind insulin with high affinity (10 nM) and to rapidly cleave it (Kcat = 0.5\u20132 s\u22121) into peptide fragments18,24, leading to its inactivation (Fig. 2a). Therefore, deeper understanding of the mechanisms of the effects of both insulin and IDE are central themes in research in physiology and into the pathophysiology of T2DM. Although the rate of bradykinin degradation by IDE is at least 20-fold higher than that of insulin, the mechanism involved remains largely enigmatic25,26. To investigate the mechanism whereby insulin is degraded by IDE, we assessed the degradation of human insulin using purified recombinant human IDE. We incubated various concentrations of human insulin with 150 nM IDE and identified the peptide fragments generated using reverse-phase\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licensemade available under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

At a concentration of 5 M, insulin was completely digested by IDE within 20 min, but intact insulin remained when concentrations of 10 to 50 M were used (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the degradation rate constants decreased as the concentrations of human insulin were increased (Fig. 2c). Thus, whereas bradykinin degradation can be explained using the Michaelis-Menten equation19, it seems that insulin degradation by IDE is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The substrate size and degradative activity of IDE may be accounted for by the swinging door motion between IDE-N and IDE-C19, as follows. Briefly, when the door-swinging motion creates an 11 to 18 \u00c5 opening (Fig. 2a), this is sufficient for small peptides, such as bradykinin, to enter the catalytic chamber, while those of larger sizes, such as insulin monomer, are excluded. Besides providing information regarding the binding of monomeric insulin, we have also demonstrated that the equilibrium between the monomeric and hexameric forms of human insulin that lacks zinc determines the degradative activity of IDE, presumably because the insulin hexamer cannot access the active site of the enzyme.\nWe next evaluated the effects of insulin degradation by IDE on insulin signaling\nin cultured cells (Fig. 3). Upon the stimulation of AML12 cells by human insulin, the phosphorylation of AKT was significantly increased. However, IDE inhibited this phosphorylation, presumably because of the degradation of human insulin by IDE.

These findings highlight the resistance of the insulin hexamer to degradation by IDE. Our model of the method of insulin degradation by IDE provides a framework for the design of an insulin hexamer that resists degradation by IDE, which should accelerate the development of new treatment modalities for T2DM."
