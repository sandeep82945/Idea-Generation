    "abstractText": "Open spina bifida (SB) remains one of the most common congenital anomalies and associates with significant comorbidities in the fetus, which may, in part, be driven by placental maldevelopment. We hypothesised that placental pathologies and maldevelopment would be more prevalent in fetuses with SB compared to fetuses without congenital anomalies. Placental histopathology (H&E-stained slides) and transcriptome (Clariom DTM microarray) were evaluated for fetuses with isolated open SB undergoing either pregnancy terminations or term deliveries (cases; n=12) and control fetuses without congenital anomalies having term or preterm births (n=22). Associations between study group and placental histopathology were adjusted for fetal sex and gestational age [GA] at delivery. Relationships between placental histopathology and select placental gene expression signatures were also evaluated. Case placentae had lower placental weight than controls (median [IQR]: 263g [175, 370] vs. 455 [378, 560], p=0.001). Placental villi structural phenotype was different in cases, who had a higher proportion of immature intermediate villi than controls (32.5% [6.3, 56.3] vs. 10% [5, 13.8], p=0.01), but similar proportions of mature intermediate (10% [5, 10] vs. 10% [8.75, 11.25]) and terminal villi (22.5% [11.3, 43.8] vs. 30 [20, 36.3]), and similar odds of having many syncytial knots (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=6 [0.2, 369]) as full-term born controls. Cellular phenotypic differences in case placentae included higher odds of having many Hofbauer cells (aOR=16.2 [1.4, 580], p=0.02) and a thick syncytial membrane (aOR=146 [3, 3.46e5], p=0.007). Expression in gene pathways related to immune/inflammatory processes, spinal cord injury, and Hedgehog and Wnt signaling were associated with placental maturity in cases. This study is the first to characterize placental histopathology in a contemporary cohort of fetuses with SB. Improved knowledge on placental histopathological and genetic phenotypes in spina bifida increases our understanding of mechanisms that may drive comorbidities to ultimately reduce offspring morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "1\nKeywords: Spina bifida, neural tube defects, placenta, placental pathology\nIntroduction Spina bifida (SB), which accounts for approximately two-thirds of all neural tube defects (NTDs), affects around one per 1000 livebirths worldwide (1). SB associates with low birthweight (2, 3) and younger gestational age (GA) at birth (4), which increases the risk of mortality for affected children (5, 6) and may be linked to placental dysfunction (4). While both environmental and genetic factors are known to contribute to SB risk (7-9), only half of all SB cases are estimated to be responsive to current preventative strategies (10). Thus, there remains a need to expand knowledge on the causal mechanisms of SB and its comorbidities, to advance strategies for prevention and improve early developmental trajectories. A suboptimal early pregnancy environment permissive of SB, which arises during the fourth week post-fertilisation, will also shape the development and function of early placental structures and may have lasting influence on placental function (11). Thus, placental maldevelopment in pregnancies with fetal SB may be a consequence of the same risk factors that led to SB, and this placental maldevelopment\ncould contribute to the increased risk of poor fetal growth and development (12) and early birth (13) observed in fetuses with SB (2-4). However, placental development and function in pregnancies with fetal NTDs have not been well-studied. Understanding whether and how placental phenotype is altered in fetuses with NTDs could provide insight into mechanisms underlying NTD-associated comorbidities, and may even hold clues about the early pregnancy environment that resulted in improper neural tube closure. We previously found that fetal NTDs associated with increased risk of placental pathologies in the Collaborative Perinatal Project cohort, which predated the introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification and the promotion of periconceptional folic acid supplementation in the United States (14, 15). Whether NTDs associate with increased risk of placental pathologies has not been investigated in a contemporary cohort. Here we evaluated placental histopathology in placentae from fetuses with open SB and fetuses with no congenital anomalies, in a contemporary cohort from Toronto, Canada, where folate deficiency is\nNOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nWhite et al. | medR\u03c7iv | Sep 20, 2023 |\nrare (16). We hypothesised that cases would have increased risk of placental maldevelopment and pathologies compared to control fetuses. We also explored relationships between placental histopathology and placental transcriptome signatures, to determine whether expression of select gene networks associated with histopathological phenotype, and between placental histopathology and maternal and infant characteristics. Methods\nEthics The Carleton University Research Ethics Board (108884 and 106932) and the Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board (17-0028-E and 17- 0186-E) approved this study. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.\nPopulation and study design This case-control study has been previously described in detail (17). In brief, we prospectively recruited patients carrying a fetus with open SB (cases) early in the third trimester of pregnancy through the Fetal Medicine Unit at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto. Patients carrying a fetus without congenital anomalies (SB controls) were recruited through our low-risk pregnancy unit around 25 weeks\u2019 gestation. We also identified a second control group that was matched to cases for GA at delivery and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). These controls delivered preterm (PT controls) and had no other known pregnancy complications.\nMaternal clinical, demographic, and dietary characteristics Maternal clinical data and medical history, and a 24-hour dietary recall (Automated Self-Administered 24-hour RecallTM, specific to the Canadian population [ASA24-Canada-2016] (18)) were collected at recruitment for cases and SB controls. Methods used to analyse the maternal dietary recall data for this cohort have been previously described (17), and included calculations of estimated average requirements (EARs) (19), Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 (20) scores, and dietary inflammatory index (DII) scores (21).\nInfant birth outcomes Data on pregnancy outcomes and infant birth weight (adjusted for infant GA and sex using Canadian growth standards (22)) were collected at delivery.\nPlacental collection and processing Immediately after delivery, placental samples were collected and processed by the Research Centre for Women's and Infants' Health (RCWIH) BioBank. Using standard procedures, placental biopsies were collected from each of the four placental quadrants, at least 1.5 cm away from the centre and edge of the placental disk, formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded, and then sectioned (5 \u03bcm) and stained with haematoxylin (Gill No. 1, Sigma-Aldrich) and eosin (Eosin Y-Solution, Sigma-Aldrich; H&E), following standard protocols (23). Placental biopsies were also snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for whole transcriptome profiling (17).\nPlacental phenotype\nAnthropometry Placental weight was recorded from fresh, untrimmed placentae prior to sampling. Raw measures of placental weight and GA-corrected placental weight z-scores were analysed (24). Ratios for infant birthweight-toplacental weight were used as an estimate of placental efficiency (25).\nHistopathology Placental histopathology was semi-quantitatively evaluated on H&Estained slides by a clinical pathologist (DG), who was blinded to the study group, guided by the Amsterdam criteria (26). The primary outcomes were:\n1. Characteristics of placental villous maldevelopment: a. delayed villous maturation (absent, present [\u226510\nmonotonous immature intermediate villi with centrally placed capillaries and few vasculosyncytial membranes]); b. distal villous hypoplasia (absent, low grade [scarce and thin terminal and mature intermediate villi surrounding thin stem villi,], high grade [scarce and thin villi surrounding stem villi, syncytial knots present, in multiple focus areas]); c. accelerated villous maturation (absent, present [hypermature villi for gestational period, increase in syncytial knots (subjective and \u201cnormalized\u201d for gestational age per the pathologist\u2019s experience, patchy fibrin adherent to the syncytial layer, some areas with lower villous density])\n2. Villitis of unknown etiology (absent, low grade [presence of inflammation in \u226410 adjacent villi in any one focus], high grade [presence of inflammation in multiple foci across sections, with inflammation in >10 adjacent villi in at least one section]) 3. Branching maturity: a. the estimated proportion of villi that were stem villi (%),\nimmature intermediate villi (%), mature intermediate villi (%) or terminal villi (%);\n4. Stromal maturity: a. the estimated proportion of intervillous space that was\ncomposed of stellate reticulum (the immature myxoid stroma that developmentally preceded collagenisation) (%) b. the level of collagen in stem villi (none, some, a lot); c. the amount of smooth muscle surrounding stem vessels\n(none, some, a lot); d. Hofbauer cells (stellate reticulum is richer in Hofbauer\ncells than collagenized stroma; few, many); 5. Capillary maturity:\na. vasculosyncytial membranes (none, few, many); b. villi capillarization (none, few, many);\n6. Syncytiotrophoblast layer maturity: a. syncytial knots (none, few, many) b. syncytial thickness (thin, thick); 7. Cytotrophoblast layer maturity: a. cytotrophoblast density (none, thin, thick); 8. A global assessment of placental maturity relative to GA at delivery (appropriate, immature, or mature for GA).\nSummary scores were calculated for three types of placental maturity (overall branching maturity, villous stromal maturity, and syncytiotrophoblast maturity; Supplementary Methods):\nAll rights reserved.

Methods for placental transcriptome sequencing have been previously described and the results reported (17), and here, these data were analysed in relation to placental histopathology. We assessed relationships between placental histopathology and: 1. overall (global) placental gene expression patterns, 2. dysregulated gene expression in cases, and 3. dysregulated expression in 14 previously identified geneset clusters of interest, that were up- or down- regulated in cases (Supplementary Methods) (17).\nStatistical analysis Data were analysed using JMP (version 16.0, SAS Institute Inc, NC). Associations between study group and placental anthropometry were tested using unadjusted (one-way Analysis of Variance [ANOVA], for parametric data); Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, for non-parametric data) and adjusted (standard least squares regression and Tukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc test) models. Differences in placental histopathology between study groups were assessed using unadjusted and adjusted nominal logistic regression models. All adjusted models included infant sex (male, female; categorical) and GA at delivery (20-41 weeks; continuous). Data are median (IQR) with p values from adjusted standard least squares regression, or n (%) with adjusted odds ratio (aOR [95% confidence interval (CI)]) with p values from Likelihood Ratio Chi Square test. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. To determine whether key maternal and infant characteristics may relate to placental histopathological phenotype, we also explored associations between: 1. GA at delivery with placental anthropometry and histopathology (generalized linear models with normal or binomial distribution; data are parameter estimate [\u03b2; 95% CI] with p value from Likelihood Ratio Chi Square test]) and 2. maternal and infant data with placental histopathology (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation test [rho; \u03c1] with raw and FDR-adjusted q values).\nAssessment of placental transcriptome features that discriminate placentae based on maturity Principal components analysis (PCA) and linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate relationships between placental transcriptome signatures and overall placental maturity (maturity scores and overall rating of maturity relative to GA), following methods applied similarly in previous studies (27-29). To determine how samples clustered based on placental transcriptome features of interest, multiple PCAs were performed as part of a data-reduction strategy, which included: 1. expression levels of the top 20% of expressed and annotated transcripts, 2. expression levels of the differentially expressed genes\n(DEGs) in cases compared to both PT and SB controls, and 3. expression levels of the genes associated with each of the 14 geneset clusters of interest, previously identified to be up- or downregulated in cases (Supplementary Methods). Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) was used to construct gene interaction networks (30). Results\nClinical cohort characteristics Baseline characteristics have been described elsewhere (17). In brief, maternal demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between cases, PT controls and SB controls. In utero fetal spina bifida closure was performed for six cases. GA at delivery was similar between cases and PT controls, and shorter in both groups compared to SB controls (17).\nCase placentae are smaller and have higher risk of pathology and maldevelopment Placental weight data were analysed for cases compared to PT controls (placental weights were missing for 2/12 [16.7%] cases). Compared to PT controls, cases had lower placental weight (263 g [175, 370] vs. 455 g [378, 560], p=0.001) and placental weight z-scores (-0.4 [-1.6, 0.2] vs. 1.3 [0.7, 2.2], p=0.0003), but higher birthweight-to-placental weight ratios (5.5 [3.9, 7.4] vs 4.4 [4, 4.7], p=0.002; Figure 1A, Supplementary Table S1). Placental histopathology was assessed for all study participants. Case placentae had a higher proportion of immature intermediate villi (IIV; 32.5% [6.25, 56.3]), and a lower proportion of stem villi (5% [5, 8.8]), than PT controls (IIV: 10% [5, 13.8], p=0.01; Stem villi: 15% [11.3, 20], p=0.003; Figures 1B and S1, Supplementary Table S1). In comparison to PT controls, cases also had higher odds of having many (vs. few) HBCs (aOR=16.2 [1.44, 580], p=0.02), thick cytotrophoblast (vs. thin/no cytotrophoblast; aOR=14.9 [1.1, 609], p=0.04) and syncytiotrophoblast (vs. thin syncytiotrophoblast; aOR=146 [3, 3.5e5], p=0.007) layers, and lower odds of having a lot of smooth muscle around stem vessels (vs. some/none; aOR=0.08 [0.003, 0.9], p=0.04; Figures 1C and S1, Supplementary Table S1). Case placental histopathology did not differ from full term SB controls (Figure 1A-C, Supplementary Table S1). In comparing measures of overall placental maturity, cases had lower syncytiotrophoblast maturity scores (3 [3, 5]) than PT (5 [4, 5]) and SB controls (5.5 [5, 6], unadjusted p=0.01), suggesting relative syncytiotrophoblast immaturity, however, the difference was not evident in adjusted analyses (Figure 1D, Supplementary Table S1).\nGlobal placental transcriptome signatures associate with placental histopathological maturity In analysis of relationships between the top 10 global gene expression principal components (PCs) and measures of placental maturity (Supplementary Tables S2-7), we found that inclusive of all study groups, branching maturity scores were associated with global gene expression PC9 (\u03b2=0.001 [0.0001, 0.001], p=0.02; Table 1). PC9 was characterized by genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage/repair and nucleic acid binding (Table 2). Syncytiotrophoblast maturity scores were associated with global gene expression PC6 (\u03b2=0.01 [0.002, 0.02], p=0.02) and PC8 (\u03b2=0.01 [0.004, 0.02], p=0.008; Table 1). PC6 was characterized by genes involved in KIT receptor signaling, which regulates placental trophoblast invasion and differentiation (31, 32), and Interleukin-5 signaling, which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of various\nEq. 1.

Placental immaturity across the cohort was associated with global gene expression PC2 (\u03b2=0.96 [0.91, 1], p=0.04), PC7 (\u03b2=0.001 [0, -], p<0.0001) and PC9 (\u03b2=0.8 [0.5, 1], p=0.007; Table 1). PC2 was characterized by genes involved in translation and RNA and protein metabolism, PC7 was enriched for genes associated with UniProt keywords \u201cUbl conjugation\u201d and \u201cphosphoprotein\u201d, suggesting a role in post-translational protein modifications, and wile PC9 was characterized as described above by genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage/repair and nucleic acid binding (Table 2). Conversely, overall placental hypermaturity was associated with global gene expression PC4 (\u03b2=0.96 [0.9, 1], p=0.03), which was characterized by genes involved in gene expression, and was enriched for genes associated with UniProt keyword \u201czinc-finger\u201d (Table 2).\nDifferentially expressed genes and gene pathways in cases associate with measures of placental histopathological maturity In analyses of relationships between the top DEG and geneset PCs (PC1 from each PCA model) and measures of placental maturity, we found that both branching maturity scores (\u03b2=-0.02 [-0.04, -0.006], p=0.01) and villous stromal maturity scores (\u03b2=-0.03 [-0.1, - 0.01], p=0.007) in cases were associated with Hedgehog signaling PC1 (Table 3, Figure\n2A-C). Villous stromal maturity scores in cases were also associated with immune and inflammatory processes PC1 (\u03b2=-0.01 [-0.02, -0.002], p=0.03; Table 3, Figure 2D-E), spinal cord injury PC1 (\u03b2=-0.02 [-0.03, -0.0004], p=0.046; Table 3, Figure 2F-G), and Wnt signaling PC1 (\u03b2=-0.03 [-0.05, -0.0005], p=0.047; Table 3, Figure 2H-I). Hedgehog and Wnt signaling, spinal cord injury and immune and inflammatory processes were each upregulated in case placentae (17). Full lists of the genes characterizing each of the 14 enriched geneset clusters in cases are provided in Supplementary Tables S8-S21.\nGestational age influences placental characteristics overall and within groups In the full cohort, GA at delivery was positively associated with placental weight, birthweight-to-placental weight ratio, proportion of placental villi that were terminal villi, levels of vasculosyncytial membranes and syncytial knots, amount of collagen in stem villi and smooth muscle around stem vessels, and overall villous stromal and syncytiotrophoblast maturity scores (Table 4, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). GA at delivery was negatively associated with the amount of stellate reticulum contained in the placental villi, proportion of placental villi that were immature intermediate villi, number of HBCs, cytotrophoblast density, and syncytiotrophoblast thickness (Table 4). Most of these associations were also observed within cases when stratified by study group, with a few exceptions: there was no association between GA at delivery and villous stromal\nAll rights reserved.

Case placentae demonstrated attributes associated with a younger GA (higher cytotrophoblast density and syncytial thickness, higher levels of HBCs, larger proportion of placental villi composed of stellate reticulum, and larger proportion immature intermediate villi; Figure 3). Concurrently, case placentae also had attributes associated with an older GA and villous hypermaturity (similar proportion of mature intermediate villi, vasculosyncytial membranes, and syncytial knots as full-term born SB controls; Figure 3).\nCase placental histopathology differs by fetal sex Male cases had a lower proportion of intervillous fibrinoid (5% [5, 5]) than male SB controls (12.5% [10, 15]), but a higher proportion than male PT controls (0% [0, 3.8], p=0.0005; Supplementary Table S22). The proportion of placental villi that were stem villi was also lower in male cases than male PT controls (5 [5, 12.5] vs. 15 [10, 18.8], p=0.04; Supplementary Table S22). Female cases had lower placental weight (221 g [147, 283] vs. 495 g [305, 633], p=0.01) and placental weight z-scores (-0.6 [-1.2, 0.03] vs.\n1.5 [0.8, 2.9], p=0.007) than female PT controls (Supplementary Table S23). Birthweight-to-placental weight ratio was also associated with study group among female fetuses, however, post-hoc analyses revealed no group differences (Supplementary Table S23). The proportion of placental villi that were stem villi was also lower in female cases than female PT controls (5 [5, 8.8] vs. 17.5 [15, 20], p=0.0002; Supplementary Table S23).\nMaternal clinical and dietary characteristics associate with placental histopathology There were no associations between placental maturity scores and summary measures of maternal dietary intake in the full cohort, or in cases or SB controls after stratification by study group (Supplementary Figure S4). Although there were some associations between individual dietary components and placental histopathology in the full cohort and among cases and SB controls separately, after FDR correction, only an association between maternal reported folate intake and the proportion of villi that were mature intermediate villi in SB controls remained (FDR p value=0.02; Figure 4).\nAll rights reserved.

Discussion We have shown for the first time in a contemporary cohort that isolated fetal open SB associates with low placental weight and an increased risk of placental pathology, in comparison to a control group matched to cases for GA and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. We also found that dysregulated placental expression of gene pathways implicated in NTDs associates with placental histopathology in cases, suggesting that placental maldevelopment in these pregnancies may be shaped by a uterine environment that is also permissive of NTDs. These findings improve our understanding of placental maldevelopment in pregnancies with fetal NTDs, and the mechanisms that may underly NTD-associated comorbidities, such as poor fetal growth and development and early birth. Despite that all but two cases were born preterm, case placentae had similar levels of mature intermediate and terminal villi, vasculosyncytial membranes, and syncytial knots, as the full term-born SB controls. Premature villous differentiation towards terminal villi can diminish the placenta\u2019s capacity to grow (34, 35), which may have led to the low placental weight observed in cases. Villous hypermaturity and increased syncytial knots in preterm placentae are associated with uteroplacental malperfusion (36, 37), and may result from oxidative damage (38, 39). Notably, expression levels of catalase (CAT), a key antioxidant enzyme that responds to oxidative stress (40), were increased in case placentae, and CAT was predicted to regulate 20% of the differentially expressed genes in cases (17). Case placentae also had higher HBC levels than controls, which are known to express CAT in early gestation and have a role in oxidative stress generation and regulation (41, 42). Decreased maternal antioxidant capacity has also been reported in pregnancies with fetal NTDs (43). Taken together, it is possible that upregulated placental CAT expression is an adaptive response to increased oxidative stress levels in cases, for which villous hypermaturity and increased syncytial knots may be histologic markers.\nAll rights reserved.

Our summary measure of villous stromal maturity considered HBC levels and the amount of collagen and stellate reticulum. Immune dysregulation and increased inflammatory load in pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of fetal SB (49, 50), and upregulation of these inflammation-related pathways may have induced HBC proliferation, as has been observed in other proinflammatory pregnancy states (51). Placental villous stromal maturity in cases was also associated with gene expression in the spinal cord injury response pathway (17), characterized by pro-inflammatory secondary lesion cascades that are activated following improper neural tube closure (52). Together, these findings suggest that upregulation in inflammation-related gene processes in case placentae may associate with placental stromal cell composition, which are critical regulators of placental villous development (53). Clarifying the factors that lead to upregulation of placental inflammatory signaling in cases and resulting histologic phenotypes is necessary to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity and mortality known to associate with placental inflammation (54). Gene expression patterns in two central regulators of development, the Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways (55, 56), were also associated with placental villous stromal and branching maturity scores in cases. Signaling in Hedgehog and Wnt pathways coordinates proper neural tube patterning and closure (55, 56), and disruptions in these pathways have been associated with NTDs (55, 56). In the placenta, the Hedgehog pathway modulates trophoblast syncytialization (57), while the Wnt pathway regulates trophoblast invasion and differentiation (58). Our finding that both signaling pathways were upregulated in case placentae suggests that known NTD-associated genetic signatures may be detectable in placentae from affected pregnancies (17). And here, we have shown for the first time that altered activity in these pathways may be associated with placental histologic phenotype in cases. As dysregulation in gene pathways previously linked to NTDs may associate with histologic features in the placenta, it is also possible that further study of placental histopathology in cases could provide opportunities to identify novel mechanisms associated with NTD phenotype or pathophysiology. When stratified by fetal sex, we found that female, but not male, cases had lower placental weight than PT controls. This may suggest that there are female-specific adaptations to the uterine environment in SB-affected pregnancies, consistent with sex differences in placental adaptations to other suboptimal pregnancy exposures (59, 60). However, these differences may have been detected only in females, and not males, because the sample size for female cases was larger (as expected, given NTDs are more prevalent in females (61)), limiting our ability to draw conclusions. We also did not find any associations between maternal dietary intakes and placental histopathology in cases after correcting for FDR. Nevertheless, given the known influence of maternal nutrition on fetal NTD risk (7) and placental\n(mal)development and function (62), further investigation into relationships between maternal nutritional status, in larger cohorts or using circulating nutrient metabolomic assessments, and placental phenotype in NTD-affected pregnancies is warranted. This study is the first to characterize placental histopathology, with integration of transcriptomic signatures to evaluate relationships between placental gene expression and histopathology, in a contemporary cohort of fetuses with isolated SB. We report that placentae from fetuses with isolated SB may present with histologic markers of oxidative stress and increased inflammation, and that these pathologies may be driven by dysregulation in antioxidant- and immune/inflammation-related gene networks (17). We also validate findings of elevated HBC levels and placental villous hypermaturity in cases from our previous work using the CPP data, suggesting some consistency in case placental phenotype across populations and time periods (4). An improved understanding of histopathological and genetic phenotypes in case placentae increases our understanding of the mechanistic factors that may contribute to fetal comorbidities in case pregnancies, and is ultimately needed to reduce offspring morbidity and mortality.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank Vagisha Pruthi for overseeing the study recruitment, data entry and sample collection, and the staff at the Research Centre for Women's and Infants' Health (RCWIH) BioBank for collecting and processing the placental samples, This research is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR PJT-175161) and departmental research grants from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, and the Department of Health Sciences at Carleton University, Ottawa.
