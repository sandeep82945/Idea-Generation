 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop new methods to achieve even larger magnitudes of chemical pressure. The paper notes that the largest chemical pressure achieved so far is -24 GPa using the "interphase strain" method. Exploring new techniques to induce greater chemical pressures could enable accessing more extreme material properties.

2. Further investigate local strain gradients and propagation from substitutional sites. The paper mentions that chemical substitution induces local strain gradients that propagate through the material. More detailed studies mapping out these strain fields could reveal new insights into how chemical pressure impacts properties.

3. Explore chemical pressure effects in a broader range of materials. The paper focuses on examples in magnetic, electric, and thermal materials. Applying chemical pressure strategies to other material classes like topological insulators, 2D materials, etc could uncover exciting new phenomena. 

4. Combine chemical pressure with physical pressure or other external stimuli. Layering chemical and physical pressure may allow accessing greater overall strain or novel effects from their interaction. Combining chemical pressure with electric/magnetic fields is another interesting direction.

5. Employ chemical pressure to target specific functional properties. Most examples focus on discovering new phases or behaviors. Taking a more application-oriented approach to deliberately tune targeted properties like conductivity, magnetization, bandgap etc. could enable new devices.
