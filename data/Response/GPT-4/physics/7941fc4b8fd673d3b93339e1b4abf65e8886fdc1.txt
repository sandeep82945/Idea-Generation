Development of Cost-effective Cultivation Systems for Astaxanthin: Investigate alternative, low-cost substrates and cultivation methods to reduce the production cost of natural astaxanthin. This could include the optimization of photobioreactor designs, exploration of less expensive nutrient sources, or the use of wastewater as a growth medium for Haematococcus lacustris and other astaxanthin-producing microorganisms.

Enhancement of Astaxanthin Bioavailability: Conduct research into the development of new formulations and delivery methods to improve the bioavailability of astaxanthin. This might involve nanoencapsulation techniques, development of astaxanthin-fortified functional foods, or the synthesis of novel astaxanthin derivatives with improved absorption and metabolic stability.

Astaxanthin Production Using Genetically Engineered Microorganisms: Explore the potential of genetic engineering and synthetic biology to increase astaxanthin yield in microorganisms. This could include the modification of existing astaxanthin-producing strains or the engineering of non-native hosts to biosynthesize astaxanthin efficiently.

Comparative Studies on the Antioxidant Properties of Astaxanthin Isomers: Investigate the differential antioxidant activities of various astaxanthin isomers and their esterified forms. This research could provide insights into which specific forms of astaxanthin are most effective against particular oxidative stress-related diseases, leading to the development of targeted astaxanthin-based therapeutic agents.

Clinical Trials of Astaxanthin in Disease Prevention and Treatment: Initiate comprehensive clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of astaxanthin in the prevention and treatment of specific diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. These studies could help in establishing standardized dosages, understanding potential side effects, and elucidating the mechanisms by which astaxanthin exerts its beneficial effects on human health.
