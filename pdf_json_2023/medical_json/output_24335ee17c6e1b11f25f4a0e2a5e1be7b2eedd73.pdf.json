    "abstractText": "Integrin \u03b24 (ITGB4) is a member of the integrin family, which plays a crucial role in mediating cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Recent studies have demonstrated that ITGB4 is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis during the development of cancer. However, the role of ITGB4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. A Multiplex immunohistochemistry (OPALTM, mIHC) assay was employed to stain ITGB4, ALDH1, PD-L1, cytokeratin (CK), CD8 and PD-1 in a human OSCC tissue microarray, containing 26 normal oral epithelium samples, 21 oral epithelium dysplasia samples and 76 OSCC samples. The expression pattern and clinicopathological characteristics of ITGB4 were analyzed and compared with those of PD-1, PD-L1, ALDH1 and CD8. The correlation between subgroups of tumor cells, including ITGB4+PD-L1+ and ITGB4+ALDH1+, and subgroups of T cells, including CD8+ and CD8+PD-1+, was evaluated using two-tailed Pearson\u2019s statistics. A Kaplan\u2013Meier curve was built, and a log-rank test was performed to analyze the survival rate of different subgroups. The mIHC staining results show that ITGB4 was mostly expressed in the tumor cells, with a significant increase in the OSCC specimens compared with normal oral epithelium and oral epithelium dysplasia. The paired analysis, conducted between the OSCC tumor tissue and normal paracancer mucosa, confirmed the results. The study further revealed that ITGB4+PD-L1+ cancer cells, but not ITGB4+ALDH1+ cancer cells, were significantly associated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells (positivity p = 0.005, positive number p = 0.03). Additionally, ITGB4+PD-L1+ tumor cells were positively correlated with CD8+PD-1+ T cells (positivity p = 0.02, positive number p = 0.03). Most intriguingly, the subgroup of ITGB4/PD-L1high with CD8/PD-1high displayed the best prognosis compared with the other considered subgroups. The results show that the expression of ITGB4 was increased in OSCC compared with normal oral mucosa. Furthermore, a specific subgroup with high levels of expression of ITGB4/PD-L1 and CD8/PD-1 was found to have a relatively better prognosis compared with the other subgroups. Ultimately, this study sheds light on the potential role of ITGB4 in OSCC and provides a basis for further investigation.",

Additionally, ITGB4+PD-L1+ tumor cells were positively correlated with CD8+PD-1+ T cells (positivity p = 0.02, positive number p = 0.03). Most intriguingly, the subgroup of ITGB4/PD-L1high with CD8/PD-1high displayed the best prognosis compared with the other considered subgroups. The results show that the expression of ITGB4 was increased in OSCC compared with normal oral mucosa. Furthermore, a specific subgroup with high levels of expression of ITGB4/PD-L1 and CD8/PD-1 was found to have a relatively better prognosis compared with the other subgroups. Ultimately, this study sheds light on the potential role of ITGB4 in OSCC and provides a basis for further investigation.\nKeywords: ITGB4; oral squamous cell carcinoma; PD-1/PD-L1 axis; CD8; prognosis"

            "text": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which displays increasing numbers of diagnosed cases and deaths annually, is a variety of heterogeneous malignancy that arises from the epithelia of oral cavities [1]. Depending on the disease stage, advanced OSCC is generally treated with surgical resection, followed by radiation or chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation, CRT) [2]. Regardless of the benefits of the primary treatment options developed over the past several decades, they are frequently ineffective and cause no significant improvement in the prognosis of OSCC patients [3].\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1014. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13061014 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1014 2 of 13\nIntegrins are a group of heterodimeric transmembrane receptor manipulating the interaction of cells with extracellular matrix components [4]. Integrin \u03b24 (ITGB4), which heterodimerizes exclusively with the \u03b16 chain, functions as a receptor for the basement membrane protein laminin. It influences cellular structure, cell cycle progression, differentiation and survival [5]. Aside from its pivotal functions in embryonic development and tissue organization, in vitro and in vivo experiments have indicated that ITGB4 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in a broad range of solid tumors, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, by triggering downstream signaling. It performs this primarily through oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, including ErbB2, PI3K, FAK/AKT and c-Met [6\u20139]. Furthermore, ITGB4 has been identified as a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker that operates by promoting metastasis, self-renewal, tumor propagation and chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer [10\u201313]. ITGB4 expression patterns display a strong heterogeneity and may vary between different carcinomas [14\u201318]. Hence, the prognostic value of ITGB4 is distinct. Historically, on the basis of analyses in human cancer tissue samples, ITGB4 is regarded as an unfavorable prognosis marker in breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer [19\u201321]. Instead, it has since been found that a high level of ITGB4 indicates a prolonged survival rate in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [22,23]. Moreover, it has been reported that the loss or dissociation of ITGB4, which leads to the breakup of the cell basement membrane, could be related to an increased risk of metastasis in prostate cancer [23,24]. Although the array of published studies has revealed the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of ITGB4 in large varieties of cancer, accurate expression patterns and prognoses of ITGB4 in OSCC are still incompletely understood. For the last decades, a deep understanding of the role of the immune system in cancer progression has provided knowledge of the mechanisms behind cancer immunosurveillance evasion. The discovery and development of specific immune checkpoints have demonstrated therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. Researchers have found evidence that hampered immunogenicity is associated with elevated immune dysfunction in OSCC, suggesting a negative impact on the prognosis [2]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, have been approved by the FDA for the management of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [25\u201327]. Aside from the important role it plays in cancer immunotherapy, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is also regarded as a potential prognostic indicator. Although studies on the prognosis of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have emerged one after another, their conclusions remain controversial. For example, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a higher level of PD-1 positive infiltrated immune cells indicates a longer survival rate [28]. However, in salivary gland carcinomas, the opposite conclusion of the prognosis judgment based on the expression of PD-1 was observed [29]. As with PD-1, the outcome predictive role of PD-L1 expression is still controversial. In OSCC, PD-L1 expression in more than 10% of tumor cells is closely related to disease recurrence and lower disease-specific survival. Instead, another study reported that high PD-L1 expression in OSCC is not significantly related to overall survival rate [30]. Considering the discrepancy between these published conclusions and the complexity of the tumor immune microenvironment, we suggest that the use of novel approaches such as multi-biomarker analysis may furnish us with a better understanding of the prognostic value of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. In this study, we explored the expression pattern and clinicopathological characteristics of ITGB4 by mIHC. The relationship among ITGB4, PD-1, PD-L1, ALDH1 and CD8 was evaluated. In addition, we considered that combined high expression levels of ITGB4, PD-L1, PD-1 and CD8 in OSCC patients may act as a novel immunophenotyping system that predicts the favorability of a prognosis.\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1014 3 of 13"

            "text": "Prior to conducting our work, evidence had begun to accumulate evidence that indicated that ITGB4 exhibits an aberrant expression and frequently correlates with malignant progression in a board range of carcinomas [6,10]. Additionally, ITGB4 has been linked to the clinicopathological characteristics of cancer, such as tumor stage and pathological grade [31,32]. In accordance with these published studies, we found ITGB4 expression to be significantly elevated in postoperative OSCC tissues when compared with normal oral mucosa or dysplasia. These findings indicate the potential oncogenic role of ITGB4 in OSCC. However, when evaluating the association of ITGB4 with clinicopathological characteristics in OSCC, we found that the ITGB4 expression level is not significantly related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis or pathological grade. These discrepancies potentially resulted from the limited number of considered cases in the present study. Despite the fact that the conclusion regarding the prognostic value of ITGB4 is controversial in different studies on different cancers, we found a high level of ITGB4 to be associated with a relatively prolonged survival in OSCC patients, even though the results were not statistically significant. A comprehensive study on esophagus squamous cell carcinoma distinguished the expression pattern of ITGB4 into pathological and physiological states. Briefly, a physiological state means that the expression of ITGB4 was confined to the basal layer of neoplastic cells adjacent to the tumor stroma. Conversely, a pathological expression means that ITGB4 was found throughout the tumor tissues [22]. Furthermore, several studies have reported that the expression of ITGB4 throughout the tumor tissue correlates with a poor prognosis [33,34]. Instead, abrogation or the loss of ITGB4 basal layer expression in cancers is related to the level of malignancy in SCC [33,35,36]. Based on the above studies, we hypothesized that the favorable trend in the prognosis of OSCC patients in this current study may be related to the high ITGB4 level in the tumor basal layer. It was evident that further comprehensive studies into the distinct expression state of ITGB4 and its effect on prognosis in OSCC are required. In order to investigate the potential oncogenic functions of ITGB4 in OSCC, we analyzed the correlation among the expression of ITGB4, ALDH1, PD-L1, CD8 and PD-1, finding the ITGB4 level to be significantly correlated with ALDH1, PD-L1 and PD-1. In multiple malignance types, cancer stem cells (CSCs), a group of highly tumorigenic, self-renewing tumor cell sub-population that is resistant to traditional radiation and chemotherapy, could be enriched by virtue of their increased expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, as accessed by the Aldefluor assay [37,38]. In prostate cancer, the silencing of ITGB4 reduces the ability of tumor progenitor cells to self-renew in vitro, suggesting that ITGB4 signaling may play a critical role in maintaining CSCs within the tumor [39]. Additionally, a similar effect was observed in triple-negative breast cancer [10]. The present study demonstrates that ITGB4 expression in OSCC was statistically associated with ALDH1, a biomarker of CSCs, indicating the potential relevance of ITGB4 and CSCs. Further investigation into the functional and regulatory role of ITGB4 in CSCs is needed. OSCC tissues, for instance, are in an immunosuppressive state [40]. Immune checkpoints (ICs) are immunosuppressive molecules with the capacity to maintain self-tolerance by modulating T cell function and protecting surrounding tissues by suppressing immune responses. In addition to traditional treatments, targeting immune checkpoints has become another therapeutic option for OSCC [25,26]. According to our observations, we found ITGB4 expression to be statistically correlated with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in OSCC tissue, indicating the potential immunogenicity of ITGB4 in OSCC. Comprehensive functional and mechanical studies of ITGB4 in the immuno-oncology of OSCC are needed in the future. Over the past decades, the impact of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) on the prognosis of cancer patients has received increasing attention [41]. It has long been known that the presence of intra-tumoral T cells is correlated with better outcomes in a number of human malignancies. For example, it has been appreciated for over 20 years that the presence of brisk T cell infiltrates is associated with improved overall survival in melanoma [42]. Moreover, the magnitude of tumor infiltrated T cells was shown to form an\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1014 10 of 13\nindependent favorable prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer [43]. PD-1 is an inhibitor of both adaptive and innate immune responses and is expressed in exhausted T cells. Of note, PD-1 was reported as being highly expressed in tumor-specific T cells [44]. In the present study, we found ITGB4 expression levels to be significantly associated with CD8+PD-1+ T cells. Hence, we speculate that the recruitment and infiltration of CD8+ cells may be due to the interaction of immune cells with ITGB4+ tumor cells at the tumor\u2013 stroma margin. However, these CD8+ cells were consequently exhausted by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Following T cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), were secreted to exert an anti-tumoral effect. IFN-\u03b3 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by T cells and NK cells that enhances the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression to promote neoantigen presentation in tumor cells by harnessing the IFN-\u03b3/JAK/STAT1 pathway, thus expressing PD-L1 in cancer cells, inactivating T cells and attenuating immunosurveillance in the TME [45]. Although PD-L1 expression in cancer has been defined as a prognostic factor not only in patients receiving conventional treatments, but also in patients receiving immunotherapy targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 [42], previous studies have reported conflicting conclusions about the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in OSCC, even in some meta-analyses, including large quantities of data [43\u201345]. Considering the discordance, we attempted to perform multi-biomarker analyses to obtain more comprehensive results. In OSCC tissues, the co-expression of ITGB4 and PD-L1 was remarkedly related to not only CD8+ T cells, but also CD8+PD-1+ exhausted T cells. We speculate that the augmented infiltrated exhausted T cells in high ITGB4-expressing tumor cells induced a sequencing elevated level of PD-L1. Moreover, with a synergic analysis of ITGB4 and PD-L1 expression levels, we found that high levels of ITGB4 and PD-L1 in the tumor tissues of OSCC patients indicate a remarkably favorable prognosis. Furthermore, considering the positive prognostic role of activated T cells in cancers, we explored a subgroup of patients with a high co-expression of ITGB4, PD-L1, CD8 and PD-1. The results show that this subgroup of OSCC patients had a significantly favorable prognosis when compared with any other subgroup. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms involved in this phenomenon require further study. The results comprehensively describe alterations in both the expression and prognostic value of ITGB4 in postoperative OSCC tissues, which strongly encourages further investigation. Despite ITGB4 being correlated to CSCs, it seemed to act as a positive outcome predicator when synergically analyzed with the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as well as CD8. Subsequent studies with a larger scale of cases incorporated with in vitro and in vivo mechanical studies can extend our understanding of ITGB4 in the progression of OSCC."
