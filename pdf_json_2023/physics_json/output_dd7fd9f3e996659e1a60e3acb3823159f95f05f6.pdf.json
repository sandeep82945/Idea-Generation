    "abstractText": "Nanoemulsion is a new multi-component drug delivery system; the selection of different oil phases can give it special physiological activity, and play the role of \u201cmedicine and pharmaceutical excipients all-in-one\u201d. In this paper, we used glycyrrhizic acid as the natural surfactant, and Blumea balsamifera oil (BB) and tea tree oil (TTO) as the mixed oil phase, to obtain a new green functional composite nanoemulsion. Using the average particle size and polydispersion index (PDI) as the evaluation criteria, the effects of the oil ratio, oil content, glycyrrhizic acid concentration, and ultrasonic time on the nanoemulsion were systematically investigated. The stability and physicochemical properties and biological activities of BB-TTO NEs prepared via the optimum formulation were characterized. The optimal prescription was BB: TTO = 1:1, 5% oil phase, 0.7% glycyrrhizic acid, and 5 min ultrasonication time. The mean particle size, PDI, and zeta potential were 160.01 nm, 0.125, and \u221250.94 mV, respectively. The nanoemulsion showed non-significant changes in stability after centrifugation, dilution, and 120 days storage. These nanoemulsions were found to exhibit potential antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BBTTO NEs against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is 2975 \u03bcg/mL, 2975 \u03bcg/mL, and 5950 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. A lower level of inflammatory cell infiltration and proportion of fibrosis were found in the synovial tissue of AIA rats treated with BB-TTO NEs. These findings demonstrate that the BB-TTO NEs produced in this study have significant potential for usage in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory areas.",

As a sophisticated and efficient encapsulation, stabilization, and controlled release delivery system for active substances (drugs), NE exhibits a remarkable capacity to enhance the stability, solubility, dispersion, and bioavailability of its constituents, through precise manipulation of the oil and water phases\u2019 composition [4\u20136], the surfactant varieties, and the emulsification conditions. As such, NEs have been widely used in medicine [7,8], food [9], cosmetics [1], and other fields.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5889. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155889 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5889 2 of 17\nEssential oils (EOs) are complex blends of aromatic metabolites extracted from different plant parts, including leaves, bark, flowers, and roots, and can be divided into a volatile and non-volatile portion. Volatile compounds represent 90\u201395% of Eos, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and their oxygenated derivatives, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters. The non-volatile portion (5\u201310% of the whole EO) comprises hydrocarbons, fatty acids, sterols, carotenoids, waxes, cumarines, and flavonoids [10]. Blumea balsamifera oil (BB) was extracted and isolated from the leaves of Blumea balsamifera (L.) DC. [11], which has broad spectrum antibacterial [12], anti-inflammatory [13], antioxidant [14], and other biological activities. Tea tree oil (TTO) is a colorless-to-light-yellow oily liquid with an aromatic smell, extracted from the fresh leaves of the tea tree; it is rich in a variety of biological active substances, such as terpenes [15]. Because of its broad spectrum of antibacterial [16], anti-inflammatory, and other biological activities [17], it has been widely used in medicine, food, and other industries. However, plant EOs have some disadvantages, such as a poor water solubility and easy decomposition [18], which limit their further application. A nanoemulsion is an isotropic, transparent/translucent, heterogeneous system of two immiscible liquids, consisting of a fine dispersion of drugs in nanodroplets. It is stabilized by an interfacial layer of emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers. They are thermodynamically and kinetically stable systems, with an extremely small droplet size (20 to 400 nm), uniform size distribution, and different physicochemical and biological properties to those of other emulsions (>500 nm) [19]. NE preparation processes are divided into lowenergy and high-energy methods. As an appropriate method for a small test benchmark, the preparation of NE via ultrasonic irradiations is an effective method of decreasing the mean particle size [20]. Some researchers prepared their EO NEs via the ultrasonic emulsification method. For example, Hatice Yazgan et al. found that lemon NE, prepared using ultrasonic emulsification, exhibits a stronger antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and E. faecalis, compared to both 100% and 10% lemon EO [21]. Ginger EO NE, prepared using zein and sodium caseinate as co-surfactants, exhibited a superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, compared to the bulk EO [22]. To enhance the properties of BB and TTO, they also can be encapsulated into NE. In generally, the oil phases commonly used in the preparation of NE in other studies include sopropyl myristate, castor oil, soybean oil, isopropyl palmitate, etc. Compared to these ordinary oils, plant EO can not only be used as an oil phase, but also shows multiple pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities; this means that the NE prepared from plant EO will have the characteristics of \u201cmedicine and pharmaceutical excipients all-in-one\u201d. The surfactant is the decisive factor in ensuring the stability of an NE, including synthetic surfactants and natural surfactants [23]. Studies have shown that polysorbate-80 and other synthetic surfactants have a slow toxicity, and a series of biosafety risks and side effects [24\u201326]. Natural surfactants mainly include polysaccharides, proteins, phospholipids, and saponins; they have the advantages of biodegradability, low toxicity, and environmental friendliness [27,28]. In addition, some of them have certain pharmacological activity; for example, ginseng saponins not only act as a natural surfactant to form and stabilize O/W emulsions, but also have anti-diabetes, anti-cancer, anti-fatigue, anti-ageing, and neuroprotective functions [29]. According to the idea of \u201cmedicine and pharmaceutical excipients all-in-one\u201d in traditional Chinese medicine, it may be an effective way to find green and safe natural surfactants in traditional Chinese medicine, which can improve the solubility of drugs, and reduce the toxicity of excipients, at the same time. Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the important active components in Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch; it consists of one molecule of glucose, and one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid [30]. It has multiple pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-viral, immunoregulatory, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic functions [31], but also play the role of a natural stabilizer, and can form micelles in an aqueous solution, and play a solubilizing role for insoluble components [32]. In this study, glycyrrhizic acid was employed as a botanical surfactant, while BB and TTO constituted the mixed oil phase, to evaluate the feasibility of formulating a novel\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5889 3 of 17\nbioactive NE. The physicochemical properties of the obtained NEs were characterized, and their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity was also evaluated (Figure 1).

Single Factor Experiments to Optimize the Prescription of BB-TTO NEs\nWe investigated the vital parameters, mean particle size, and Polydispersity Index (PDI) concerning the optimization of BB-TTO NE formulations. The oil type and content play an important role in determining their ability to form and stabilize emulsions [33]. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the BB to TTO ratio and oil content on BB-TTO NEs. As expected, the ratio of BB to TTO exhibited a significant impact on the average particle size and stability of the NE. At a 1:1 ratio, the NE displayed an average particle size of 183.78 nm, while other proportions of BB and TTO resulted in a particle size exceeding 200 nm. Notably, the PDI was most stable at 0.20 \u00b1 0.02 for the 1:1 ratio (Figures 2A and S1). Regarding the oil phase composition, NEs containing a 1%, 3%, and 7% oil content demonstrated instability, characterized by phase separation and floating oil beads. Conversely, NEs containing a 5% and 10% oil phase content exhibited a homogenous milky white appearance, indicative of their stability and successful emulsification. Additionally, the NE at 5% oil phase content had a smaller particle size, and a relatively stable PDI. Based on appearance, average particle size, and PDI considerations, the optimal prescription for oil phase content was determined to be 5% (Figures 2B and S2). A surfactant is necessary for facilitating the formation of, and improving the kinetic stability of, NEs. Research has demonstrated the critical role of an appropriate surfactant concentration in maintaining the stability of NEs [34].

However, NEs with a lower glycyrrhizic acid conce tration (e.g., 0.05%, 0.10%, and 0.20%) showed the phenomenon of oil droplet suspension. This could be because the oil/water interface could not be stabilized with so few available surfactants [35].

It is plausible that the high surfactant concentrations surpassed a particular threshold, at which a highly viscous liquid formed around the droplet phase, thus impeding the spontaneous breakup of the oil\u2013water interface [36]. At 0.7% glycyrrhizic acid content, the mean particle size was 130.00 nm, and the PDI was 0.24, which led us to select this content as the optimal surfactant dosage (Figures 2C and S3). Finally, we assessed the influence of ultrasonic time on the average particle size of the NE. NEs prepared with ultrasonic times of 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 min displayed a uniformly milky appearance (Figures 2D and S4). When the ultrasonic time was less than 5 min, the particle size or PDI was large. However, stability in terms of the average particle size and PDI was achieved when the ultrasonic time exceeded 5 min. Consequently, the optimal ultrasonic time for NE preparation was determined to be 5 min.\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\npared with 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.7% glycyrrhizic acid exhibited a favorable appearance.

After the dilution of the BB-TTO NEs, an obvious Faraday\u2013Tyndall effect can be seen, confirming the presence of nanoparticles (Figure 3B).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5889 5 of 17\nThen, the BB-TTO NEs are subjected to a TEM examination, to analyze the structure and morphology.

Mean Particle Size, PDI, and Zeta Potential The mean particle size and PDI are the key parameters that affect the quality, homo-\ngeneity, and dispersibility of an NE, and can be determined via dynamic light scattering (DLS) [38]. The penetration of the drugs encapsulated in nanoemulsions is enhanced when the droplet size is less than 500 nm [39]. The average size for the BB-TTO NEs recorded is 160.32 \u00b1 1.92 nm (Figure 3D), achieving the desired particle size, which is far less than 500 nm. PDI is the ratio of standard deviation to mean droplet size, which can reflect homogeneity in particle size in a solution; a PDI lower than 0.2 is desirable, as it implies that the NE droplets are almost similar in size, and free of adhesion and aggregation [38,40]. The PDI of BB-TTO NEs is 0.16 \u00b1 0.02, which is an ideal value. The zeta potential can be used to evaluate the stability of particles in a suspension; if the absolute of the zeta potential value is greater than 30, the suspension can be considered stable [41]. The zeta potential average value of BB-TTO Nes is \u221250.94 \u00b1 9.21 mV (Tables S1\u2013S4), which can evade aggregation, and increase the stability of the emulsion. These results indicated that the emulsion prepared using this method has a good uniformity and repeatability.\n2.2.3. Type Identification\n2.2.2.

These results indicated that the mulsion prepared using this method ha a good uniformity and repeatabili y.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5889 6 of 17\n2.2.3. Type Identification\nTo predict the type of NE formed under given conditions, the interaction of various components making up the NE must be estimated. If the chief surfactant is water soluble, it favors O/W emulsification and, conversely, if the surfactant is oil soluble, it favors W/O emulsification [42]. The type of NE was determined using the oil-soluble dye Sudan Red, and the water-soluble dye methylene blue [43]. The results showed that the diffusion rate of methylene blue in the BB-TTO NEs was faster than that of Sudan red, which indicated that the NE is O/W type (Figure 3C).\n2.2.4. pH, Viscosity, and Turbidity\nThe incorporation of glycyrrhizic acid (as the surfactant) led to a reduced pH in the BB-TTO NEs, with a value of 3.29, thus satisfying the criterion for a weak acidity in skin preparations [44,45]. The viscosity is an important parameter of a drug carrier used through topical or transdermal application, which can influence stability and spreadability; a lower viscosity is conducive to the penetration of the preparation into the skin [46]. The average viscosity of BB-TTO NEs was calculated to be 55.07 \u00b1 0.79 mPa\u00b7s, using the NDJ-9S rotational viscosimeter, meeting the requirements for local skin administration. The turbidity measurement is a simple and low-cost method of defining the stability of an emulsion [47]. The absorbance of the NE at 650 nm was measured using the enzyme marker [48], and the turbidity of BB-TTO NEs was 6.62 cm\u22121 after dilution."

NEs exhibit kinetic stability [49]. To assess the stability of BB-TTO NEs, a centrifugation method was employed to accelerate the emulsion breakage. Centrifugation was performed at the varying rotational speeds of 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 8000, and 10,000 rpm for 15 min.

Consequently, we investigated the therapeutic potential of BB-TTO NEs in an AIA rat model, to evaluate their anti-inflammatory activity. After the complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant induced arthritis SD rat model was conducted, we treated rats once a day with 11,900 \u00b5g/mL BB-TTO Nes, according to the timeline shown in Figure 7A; the paw swelling was monitored every day. First, we recorded the body change in the rats, to evaluate the life quality. There was no significant change in the weight of the rats in the different groups (Figure 7B). As shown in Figure 7E, the AIA rats without treatment maintained a high paw thickness, because of the joint inflammation [61]; in the BB-TTO NEs group, the swelling symptoms were gradually decreasing, especially on the sixth day (p < 0.05). The rats were sacrificed on day 6 after their treatment with BB-TTO Nes, and subjected to a histopathological examination. The results of the H and E staining in Figure 7C show an intense inflammatory cell infiltration, consisting of macrophages, neutrophils, etc., synovial thickening, pannus formation (the infiltration of adaptive immune cells into the synovial sublining form a hallmark \u201cpannus\u201d formation at cartilage\u2013bone interfaces) [62], and cartilage erosion were observed in the ankle joints of the model group rats. The joint structure among the blank group was normal; no pannus formation or inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Compared with the model group, the synovial cell proliferation, pannus formation, and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly improved in the NE group. Some investigators have also demonstrated the anti-inflammatory activity of EO NE using models of arthritis. Li et al. [63] prepared a sanse powder EO NE (SP-NE) and also found less inflammatory cell infiltration in the synovial tissue of osteoarthritis rats treated with SP-NEs. Similar results were reported by Mohammadifar et al. [64]. They indicated that NEs containing peppermint and rosemary EO reduced osteoarthritis pain, via increasing the antioxidant capacity, and improving the histopathological features of the rats\u2019 knee joints. Masson staining also showed that the average percentage of fibrosis after BB-TTO NE treatment was significantly lower than that among the model group; it was only 0.06%, while the amount in the model group was about three times that of the BB-TTO NE group (Figure 7D,F).

The anti-inflammatory activity of BB works through inhibiting TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathways and NLRP3 inflammasome activation [67]. NEs possess various advantages that increase their ability to enhance skin permeation, such as nanosized droplets and a lowered interfacial tension [68]. Therefore, the BB-TTO NEs in this study may penetrate the skin of AIA rats, and have a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, and the release of inflammatory factors.

The appearance properties before and after centrifugation were observed, and the absorbance changes were measured at 490 nm, using a thermo scientificTM Multiskan sky, and the centrifugal stability coefficient K was calculated using the following formula [70]:\nK(%) = A1/A0 \u00d7 100% (2)\nA0: the absorbance value of BB-TTO NEs at 490 nm wavelength before centrifugation, A1: the absorbance value of BB-TTO NEs at 490 nm wavelength after centrifugation. For dilution stability, BB-TTO NEs were diluted using distilled water at a ratio of 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, and 1:1000, respectively, and the appearance of NEs was observed before and after dilution."

After another 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed using PBS at least 3 times. A 10% MTT reagent was added into each well, following the standard method. Finally, a microplate spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of formazan at 570 nm.

To execute this, the BB-TTO NEs were assessed via a broth micro-dilution assay, using a sequential dilution in sterile 96-well microplates. Initially, 100 \u00b5L sterilized LB Broth was added to each of the rows. Wells 1\u201311 were augmented with 100 \u00b5L of BB-TTO Nes, and diluted serially, to form a sequence of concentrations from 5950 \u00b5g/mL to 371.9 \u00b5g/mL. The final well served as the growth control. The microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Each assay was replicated in triplicate, and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm. The MIC value was taken at the lowest concentration of antibacterial agents that inhibits the growth of bacteria (minimum OD600 value). The positive and negative controls used were gentamycin sulfate at 50 \u00b5g/mL, and saline, respectively."

All animal studies were performed in accordance with the protocols approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Committee of Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No. GZY20220112). Briefly, twelve SD rats were selected, and each rat was injected intradermally into the right posterior plantar with 0.1 mL complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, to induce inflammation, and 100 \u00b5L CFA was injected again on the third day, to create early-stage arthritis SD rats. After 7 days, the rats were randomly divided into three groups: the normal group, model group, and treatment group. The treatment and model groups were coated with BB-TTO NEs and saline, respectively, and their weight and paw thickness were recorded every day. After 6 days of treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the synovial tissue was collected for hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H and E, a classic standard tissue section staining method widely used in the inspection of tissue components for pathological analysis that is applicable in all organs and disease models) and Masson staining.

The nanoemulsion was O/W, regularly spherical, and the size was about 160 nm. BB-TTO NEs had inhibitory effects on E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. More interestingly, compared with the control group, after 6 days of BB-TTO NE application, the joint-swelling degree of arthritis model rats was reduced, the number of inflammatory cells in the synovial tissue was significantly reduced, the symptoms of connective tissue hyperplasia were significantly relieved, and the average percentage of fibers was significantly reduced. This experiment confirmed the feasibility of using glycyrrhizic acid as a natural surfactant to prepare new green nanopreparations, and provided a new choice and direction for the development of new green nanopreparations. At the same time, it also provided a basis and reference for the application of EOs in cosmetics and other fields. However, the nanoemulsion\u2019s potential anti-inflammatory and antibacterial mechanisms remain to be further studied.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be found online https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28155889/s1: Figure S1: Effect of oil phase ratios on BB-TTO NEs; Figure S2: Effect of oil phase content on BB-TTO NEs; Figure S3: Effect of glycyrrhizic acid concentration on BB-TTO NEs; Figure S4: Effect of ultrasound time on BB-TTO NEs; Table S1: Zeta potential of NEs prepared with different oil phase ratios; Table S2: Zeta potential of NEs prepared with different oil phase contents; Table S3: Zeta potential of NEs prepared with different glycyrrhizic acid concentrations; Table S4: Zeta potential of NEs prepared with different ultrasound times; Table S5: Storage stability of BB-TTO NEs; Table S6: Centrifugal stability of BB-TTO NEs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Z.
