Integrative top–down proteomics is an analytical approach that fully addresses the breadth and complexity needed for effective and routine assessment of proteomes. Nonetheless, any such assessments also require a rigorous review of methodology to ensure the deepest possible quantitative proteome analyses. Here, we establish an optimized general protocol for proteome extracts to improve the reduction of proteoforms and, thus, resolution in 2DE. Dithiothreitol (DTT), tributylphosphine (TBP), and 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide (HED), combined and alone, were tested in one-dimensional SDSPAGE (1DE), prior to implementation into a full 2DE protocol. Prior to sample rehydration, reduction with 100 mM DTT + 5 mM TBP yielded increased spot counts, total signal, and spot circularity (i.e., decreased streaking) compared to other conditions and reduction protocols reported in the literature. The data indicate that many widely implemented reduction protocols are significantly ‘under-powered’ in terms of proteoform reduction and thus, limit the quality and depth of routine top–down proteomic analyses. 1. conclusions Reducing extracts of native proteomes with 100 mM DTT + 5 mM TBP prior to the first dimension of separation yielded improved resolution and detection by 2DE relative to other reagents previously used in comparable studies. We acknowledge there is not a ‘perfect’ one-size-fits-all method; however, the goal here was to establish an optimized general protocol to enhance 2DE resolution and, thus, routine integrative top–down proteomic analyses.
