    "abstractText": "While photosynthesis transforms sunlight energy into sugar, aerobic and anaerobic respiration (fermentation) catabolizes sugars to fuel cellular activities. These processes take place within one cell across several compartments, however it remains largely unexplored how they interact with one another. Here we report that the weak acids produced during fermentation downregulate both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. This effect is mechanistically explained with an \u201cion trapping\u201d model, in which the lipid bilayer selectively traps protons that effectively acidify subcellular compartments with smaller buffer capacities \u2013 such as the thylakoid lumen. Physiologically, we propose that under certain conditions, e.g., dim light at dawn, tuning down the photosynthetic light reaction could mitigate the pressure on its electron transport chains, while suppression of respiration could accelerate the net oxygen evolution, thus speeding up the recovery fromhypoxia. Since we show that this effect is conserved across photosynthetic phyla, these results indicate that fermentation metabolites exert widespread feedback control over photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. This likely allows algae to better copewith changing environmental conditions.",

Nawrocki 3,5, Pierre Cardol 4, Mengyuan Zheng 1,2, Jingjing Jiang1, Yuan Fang1,2, Wenqiang Yang1,2, Roberta Croce 3 & Lijin Tian 1,2\nWhile photosynthesis transforms sunlight energy into sugar, aerobic and anaerobic respiration (fermentation) catabolizes sugars to fuel cellular activities. These processes take place within one cell across several compartments, however it remains largely unexplored how they interact with one another. Here we report that the weak acids produced during fermentation downregulate both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. This effect is mechanistically explained with an \u201cion trapping\u201d model, in which the lipid bilayer selectively traps protons that effectively acidify subcellular compartments with smaller buffer capacities \u2013 such as the thylakoid lumen. Physiologically, we propose that under certain conditions, e.g., dim light at dawn, tuning down the photosynthetic light reaction could mitigate the pressure on its electron transport chains, while suppression of respiration could accelerate the net oxygen evolution, thus speeding up the recovery fromhypoxia. Since we show that this effect is conserved across photosynthetic phyla, these results indicate that fermentation metabolites exert widespread feedback control over photosynthesis and aerobic respiration. This likely allows algae to better copewith changing environmental conditions.\nPhotoautotrophic species relyonbothphotosynthesis and respiration. While the former process harvests sunlight and stores its energy in the form of sugars, aerobic and anaerobic respiration (fermentation) oxidizes sugars releasing energy to meet metabolic requirements1,2. For Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas throughout), a model soil-dwelling alga, fermentation has been demonstrated to be important for survival in the weak light environment in the morning and evening3\u20135, and it has been proven to be the preferred metabolic process at night, even when oxygen is not limiting6. In Chlamydomonas, photosynthesis and aerobic respiration occur in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively7, while fermentation pathways could independently occur in the cytoplasm, mitochondria or chloroplasts8. The activity of the enzymes participating in the photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism is finely regulated and often separated not only in space but also in time7,9. Nonetheless, these metabolic processes are inevitably intertwined since their products can passivelyand actively cross the cellular membranes10. Additionally, a tight energetic coupling was found between chloroplasts and mitochondria in Chlamydomonas via a redistribution of reducing power11,12.

Under certain stress conditions, the concentration of those acids builds up in the medium to mM-range within an hour of hypoxia8. Currently, how these metabolites affect photosynthesis is poorly understood. This can be relevant because it has been shown that the addition of weak acids into a suspension of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cell induces immediate, reversible non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence and a slower reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool16. These effects indicate that acetic acid permeates through 4 membranes to acidify the thylakoid lumen and induce protonation of LHCSR3 and LHCSR1, the proteins responsible for low pH-sensing in the alga17\u201321. Thus, weak acids and potentially their salts could also impact photosynthesis. Interestingly, upon long-termdark adaptation, thylakoid lumen acidification was often observed in unicellular algae (hereafter referred to as dark-induced acidification)22,23 and it was proposed to depend on either chlororespiration or ATP hydrolysis in darkness22,24\u201326. However, considering that long-term dark adaptation of highly concentrated micro algae often leads to anoxia, and thus fermentation, which converts sugar into acids8, we speculate that this dark-induced lumen acidification is due to fermentation.\nTo verify this hypothesis and to explore the interplay between metabolism and photosynthesis, we examined photosynthetic activity bymonitoring the chlorophyll fluorescence of Chlamydomonasduring fermentation. We show that the weak acids produced by fermentation acidify the thylakoid lumen. We demonstrate that the metabolic control of the chloroplast by fermentation is passive and does not depend on ATP synthase or chlororespiration, and we propose a mechanism for the metabolic control induced by fermentation. Finally, we show that the weak acids not only strongly decrease photosynthetic light harvesting by promoting NPQ, but also decrease aerobic oxygen consumption. These side effects of fermentation represent a previously unknown case of feedback control by metabolites regulating aerobic respiration and the onset of photosynthesis."

            "text": "Fermentation acidifies the lumen in Chlamydomonas due to weak acid production Fermentative metabolism in Chlamydomonas generates various weak acids8. To investigate how these acids possibly affect photosynthesis, wemonitored chlorophyll fluorescence during fermentation, focusing on the quenching induced by lumen acidification. To separate fluorescence quenching from state transitions (induced in darkness in anoxic conditions27,28), the stt7-9 mutant, deficient in the Stt7 kinase required for this antenna redistribution process29, was used. Figure 1a shows significant fluorescence quenching during anaerobic respiration. The quenching relaxed completely after the addition of KOH (after fermentation, the cell culture becomes acidic, and KOH is used to adjust the pH of the medium back to 7.5). Similar results were obtained forWTCC-124 cells, even though themaximum fluorescence before and after quenching was not the same because of the presence of state transitions (Supplementary Fig. 1). The dependency of the quenching on LHCSR3was shown using the doublemutant npq4 stt7-9 (see Fig. 1b, in which Fm\u2019 of npq4 stt7-9 was stable through the fermentation process). As the LHCSR-dependent chlorophyll fluorescence can be used as a reliable lumenal pH indicator30, we concluded that fermentation acidifies the lumen in Chlamydomonas.\nTo verify if quenching is causedby the accumulationofweakacids produced during fermentation, we ran the same experiments on Chlamydomonas eustigmaNIES-2499, a species that lacks the enzymes involved in organic acid fermentation pathways while retaining the alcohol fermentation pathways31. Note that these cells perform normal acid-inducedNPQ (Fig. 1c). During fermentation, the fluorescence ofC.\neustigma cells decreased to some extent, but the change was not sensitive to KOH, indicating that it is not due to NPQ, but likely to state I\u2192 state II transition (Fig. 1d).\nTo further prove that the quenching of fluorescence during fermentation was indeed due to weak acids, we measured the extracellular weak acid content of Chlamydomonas at different time points during anoxia (every 30min) and correlated them with NPQ values. The results show a positive correlation between formic and acetic acid concentrations and NPQ (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2), in agreement with previous quantifications with externally-added acid17. In contrast, in the acidophilic algae NIES-2499, the cells hardly produced any acids (Supplementary Fig. 2), in agreement with previous measurements31, thus the fluorescence is not quenched under hypoxia (Fig. 1d). Altogether, these results indicate that lumen acidification in the dark is due to organic acid fermentation and not to alcoholic fermentation.\nExogenously added weak acids and their salts acidify the lumen in Chlamydomonas Intriguingly, as reported earlier17,many differentweak acids other than acetic acid induce lumen acidification when added to the cell solution (a list of weak acids inducing this effect is shown in Supplementary\nTable 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).We also exclude an effect of acetate incorporation in the cellular metabolism as the trigger of fluorescence quenching, as in the icl mutant, deficient in isocitrate lyase32, the quenching phenotype remained (Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, not only acetic acid (Fig. 2a), but also 50mM sodium acetate (NaAc) was able to induce quenching (Fig. 2b). The fluorescence quenching was fully relaxed upon addition of 100 \u03bcM nigericin, a known proton antiporter33, indicating that NaAc induced lumen acidification, even though the pH of the solution remained unaffected. On the contrary, strong acids and their salts, like HCl and NaCl, did not induce quenching (Fig. 2c, d).\nAbove we showed that lumen acidification occurs in response to anoxicmetabolism, and highlighted that the same effect was obtained by the exogenous addition of weak acids and their salts. As the use of weak acid considerably speeds up the experiments (seconds vs. hours16,17), we used this approach to test the presence of this phenomenon in a range of organisms across the photosynthetic phyla, including another green alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa FACHB-9), a red alga (Porphyridium purpureum FACHB-840), a diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum FACHB-863), a moss (Physcomitrella patens) and several angiosperms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Triticum sp., and Sorghum sp.). The results in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5a, c and d demonstrate that fluorescence quenching could be induced by adding acetic acid in all organisms. In the species for which NPQ mutants were available, we were able to confirm that the quenching was related to lumen acidification and dependent on pH-sensing proteins i.e., LHCSR in Chlamydomonas (Supplementary Fig. 6) and PsbS in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5b).\nIs lumenacidification an active bioenergetic process or a passive chemical effect? To understand the mechanism of weak acid-induced quenching, we sought to distinguish whether an active bioenergetic/metabolic pathway or a passive chemical effect is responsible for the observed effect. It was previously suggested that chlororespiration, a chloroplastic respiratory electron transfer chain involving the enzymes, PTOX234 and NDA235, could be responsible for lumen acidification in the presence of a reduced carbon source16. To test this hypothesis, we used the two chlororespiratory mutants ptox2 and nda2 and their parental strainWTCC-4533. We found that in all of them the addition of 50mM NaAc could successfully induce fluorescence quenching (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Fig. 4a\u2013c). Since the use of NaAc allowed keeping the pH of the cell medium neutral, and the quenching\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4207 2\nrelaxed following the addition of nigericin, we conclude that chlororespiration is not a prerequisite for the salt-induced lumen acidification.\nAnother mechanism that could account for lumen acidification in the dark is the hydrolysis of ATP. When glycolysis and respiration are active, ATP produced in the process could be imported into the chloroplast and converted by the ATP synthase into a proton gradient24,36. To verify whether the lumen acidification was ATP synthase-dependent, we used the FUD50mutant, whichbears a deletion in the atpB gene37. To exclude Fm changes due to state transition, state I was induced by weak light pre-illumination in the presence of DCMU38. The acid-induced quenching was also present in FUD50 (Fig. 4d), showing that lumen acidification is not caused by ATP hydrolysis. Quenching induced by NaAc was fully relaxed by adding nigericin,\nindicating that a buildup of \u0394pH took place across the thylakoid membrane also in this mutant."

To answer this question, we spatially mapped the pH distribution in various intracellular compartments using the pH-sensitive dye BCECF. Cell wall-freemutant CC-400 was used to ensure easier penetration of the dye into the cell. Confocal fluorescence images showed that the dye was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm but did not enter the chloroplast (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8).

The relationship between fermentation products formic acid (e) and acetic acid (f) accumulated in the medium of Chlamydomonas cultures and NPQ in stt7-9. Cells were kept in anaerobiosis in the dark for up to 4.5 h. Samples were taken at the indicated time points (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 4.5 h), centrifuged, and filtered, and the medium was analyzed by HPLC. Data are taken from triplicate samples derived from three independent experiments. Error bars represent SD.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4207 3\n(Fig. 5b). In either case, the cells were not significantly shrinking in size, excluding osmotic stress as a cause of lumen acidification (see the confocal images Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). Finally, we showed that the cytoplasmic pH upon anaerobic respiration was <5.5 (see Supplementary Table 2).\nAccording to the partition theory, ionized molecules usually cannot penetrate, cell membranes because they are hydrophilic and poorly lipid-soluble39. That explains why strong acid and strong acid salts fail to lead to fluorescence quenching (given they are virtually fully dissociated in solution), but weak acids and their salts could induce fluorescence decrease. Based on these results, we propose that the chloroplast lumen acts as an \u201cion trap\u201d (Fig. 5c). For acids, an equilibriumbetween their protonated and ion form is described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH =pKa + log10 A\n\u00bd = HA\u00bd . A key feature of a membrane is that it allows small uncharged molecules to diffuse through. Therefore, the non-dissociated formofweak acids can penetrate the cell membrane all the way to the thylakoid lumen.\nTo understand why there is a difference in pH between the thylakoid lumen and other compartments, their buffering capacity needs to be considered. It has been reported that the buffer capacity of the lumen (0.8\u20131.0mM) is much lower than that of cytoplasm (~20mM) and stroma (27 \u00b1 4mM)40\u201342. Additionally, the total volume of the lumen is very small compared to the stroma43.When the concentration of HAc/NaAc increases in the cytoplasm, the concentration of its protonated form, HAc, also increases. These charge-free molecules diffuse across the membranes and then release protons in the lumen, consequently acidifying it as its buffer capacity is weak. An estimate of the pH values of two compartments separated by a membrane and with different buffer capacities is reported in Supplementary Table 3.\nEffect of weak acids on photosynthesis To understand the physiological relevance of the observed acidification, we evaluated the effect of weak acids on photosynthetic electron\ntransfer. To exclude effects from NPQ and state transitions, which would further negatively feedback the electron transfer rate (ETR) upon acid addition, we used the npq4 stt7-9doublemutant. The results showed that the relative electron transport rate of both PSII (ETR(II)) and PSI (ETR(I)) dropped significantly in acidic conditions (Fig. 6a, b). We also examined the effect of weak acids produced by anaerobic fermentation showing that ETR(I) in npq4 stt7-9 dropped in anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). These results indicate that electron transfer is indeed hampered by the low lumenal pH44,45. The effect can be due to the non-photochemical reduction of the PQ pool, and/or a decrease in the activity of cytochrome b6f, which is known to be down-regulated by the low lumenal pH46.\nTo disentangle these effects, we measured the electrochromic shift signal (ECS)47. The bphaseof the ECS is related to the cytochrome b6f-mediated electron transfer, and it is expected to slow down upon lumen acidification48. The latter slows down quinol oxidation at the Qo site due to the initial deprotonation event being an uphill reactionwith a higher energetic threshold at low luminal pH. The b-phase in the ECS signal (ms-timescale) was slower in anaerobiosis (Supplementary\nFig. 11c). We also confirmed the absence of the b-phase in the ECS signal (ms-timescale) of the npq4 stt7-9 under aerobic conditions when 4.5mM HAc or 50mM NaAc was added (Supplementary Fig. 12).\nIn summary, the data show that weak acids, which are produced by fermentation, can suppress both light harvesting\u2014by triggering NPQ\u2014and ETR. To understand if this effect has a physiological role, we measured the oxygen levels during photosynthetic re-activation of the anaerobic-acclimated cells. The results showed that in low light oxygen evolution was quickly restored in 20minwhen the light was turned on after 3 h of anoxia (Fig. 6c). In contrast, when KOH (pH of the medium 7.5) was added to neutralize acidification, oxygen was released slowly with a time delay of 1 h compared to the sample without KOH (Fig. 6c). To exclude a toxic effect of KOH, cells were also measured in aerobic conditions. No difference in oxygen evolution was observed for cells\na b\nc d\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n). u.a( ec necser o ul F Time(s) NaClAL OFF\nAL ON\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n). u.a( ec necser o ul F\nTime(s)\nNigericinNaAcAL OFF\nAL ON\nleads to fluorescence quenching (350 s\u2013650 s) which was abolished upon addition of 100\u03bcM nigericin (650 s\u2013810 s). c Adding HCl (pH of medium 5.5), and KOH to titrate the pH back to 7.5 did not affect fluorescence. d The fluorescence did not change when the 50mM NaCl was added.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4207 4\nwith and without KOH (Supplementary Fig. 13). We also measured the quantum yield of PSII Y(II) in cells in anaerobic conditions and found that the value was higher in the presence of KOH (Supplementary\nFig. 14), indicating that acidification decreased the photosynthetic activity. Why then the addition of KOH slows down oxygen evolution during the onset of photosynthesis following anoxia? A possible\nexplanation is that aerobic respiration is also inhibited by the weak acids produced during fermentation. Upon addition of KOH, aerobic respiration rapidly recovered. Photosynthesis also recovered, but in the first phase, at dawn, which is characterized by low light intensity, oxygen production is minimal. In these conditions the oxygen consumption rate exceeds the production rate, leading to a significant\nba\nc d\ne\nf\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n).u.a( ecnecs erou lF\nTime(s)\nAL ON AL OFF\nHAc KOH\nChlorella pyrenoidosa\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n).u.a( ecnecserou lF\nTime(s)\nAL ON\nHAc\nKOH LL AL\nON\nPhaeodactylum tricornutum\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n).u.a( ecnecserou lF\nTime(s)\nAL ON LL AL ON\nHAc KOH\nPorphyridium purpureum\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n).u.a( ecnecserou lF\nTime(s)\nAL ON\nAL OFF\nHAc\nKOH\nPhyscomitrella patens\nH2O\n0\n4\nH2O\nH2O\nHAc\nHAc\nSorghum bicolor\nHAc\nHAc\nH2O\nTriticum aestivum\nNPQ\nH2O\nH2O\nHAc\nArabidopsis-WT\nH2O\nH2O\nArabidopsis-npq4\nNPQ\nHAc\nHAc\nHAc\n0\n4\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4207 5\ndelay in oxygen accumulation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in high light, when oxygen production became the dominating process, the effect of KOH disappears (Fig. 6c). To further verify that aerobic respiration was reduced under acidification, we incubated the cells at different pH under aerobic conditions in the dark. The rate of oxygen consumption of the cells decreased under acidification conditions (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 15), demonstrating that aerobic respiration was severely suppressed under acidic conditions."

            "text": "It has often been reported that lumen acidification occurs in green algae, diatoms, lichens and other species kept in darkness for hours24,49\u201351. This phenomenon was ascribed to either chlororespiration or ATP hydrolysis52,53. Indeed, if chlororespiration is electrogenic (i.e., the combined activity ofNADPHdehydrogenase and plastoquinol terminaloxidase results in net proton translocation to the lumen), then acidification takes place. Nevertheless, in the case of Chlamydomonas, the chlororespiratory enzymes PTOX and NDA2 are probably not electrogenic as they are both monotopic and chloroplast stromaexposed54. Likewise, ATP synthase running in reverse mode could lower the lumen pH thanks to ATP hydrolysis55 and it has been demonstrated that ATP (of mitochondrial origin) hydrolysis by chloroplastic ATP synthase occurs in dark oxic conditions in several species (Diatoms13, Phaemonas56, Euglens14), however, in anoxic conditions, this is unlikely to happen because mitochondrial respiration is abolished. As anticipated, using ptox2, nda2 and FUD50 mutants, we unambiguously demonstrated that the lumen acidification in the presence of weak acids does not originate from chlororespiration nor from ATP hydrolysis. Instead, we propose that lumen acidification is directly due to the weak acids produced during fermentation that translocate to the thylakoid lumen, which acts as an \u201cion trap\u201d: lipid membrane, impermeable to charged molecules, effectively traps\nFig. 3 | Chlorophyllfluorescence tracesof algaeand images ofhigherplants. aA typical chlorophyll fluorescence trace of Phaeodactylum tricornutum (FACHB-863).

Hence, we report a new type of light-independent lumen acidification of cells in anoxia, in addition to the observed lumen acidification of cells in oxic condition led by ATP hydrolysis.\nAdditional evidence supports the \u201cion-trap\u201d model. Recently, Gabba et al.57 successfully determined the permeability coefficients of weak acids in lipid vesicles and living cells and they demonstrated that weak acids cross the membrane mainly via passive diffusion rather than protein-mediated transport. More importantly, in vitro experiments with the pyranine pH assay using liposomes with a low internal buffer capacity showed that the inside of the liposomes acidifies upon the addition of weak acid salts57, in agreement with our results in vivo.\nUnderstanding how fermentation, aerobic respiration and photosynthesis pathways are entangled requires a holistic view of the cell. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 7, we showed that the weak acids produced during fermentation could penetrate the thylakoid lumen thus suppressing the light reaction of photosynthesis. In parallel, we propose that they also penetrate the mitochondria slowing down aerobic respiration. The mitochondrial matrix has a low H+-buffering capacity (5mM) comparedwith the cytosol (20mM)58 and in anaerobic conditions, it might be acidified by the weak acids produced by fermentation. This effect would collapse, even invert, the pH gradient across the membrane, which probably inhibits the electron transport chain and thus reduces the oxygen uptake. Yet, how weak acids suppress mitochondrial metabolism remains to be clarified.\nIn the natural environment, photosynthetic organisms experience an alternation of dark and low light conditions. Upon dusk, in photosyntheticmicroalgae, e.g.,Chlamydomonas, oxygen is rapidlydepleted\nby respiration and fermentation metabolism becomes active. Fermentation generates energy tomaintain cell viability and supports cell redox balance by re-oxidizing NAD(P)H. Here we propose that along with these two functions, fermentation plays an additional role. The production of weak acids partially inhibits both photosynthesis and respiration, and the effective limitation of the later process can help the cell to quickly shift from anoxia to aerobic conditions when light intensity is low and respiration consumes more O2 than photosynthesis produces. This process can be further enhanced in non-axenic conditions of microbial mats, with organisms exhibiting fermentative metabolism influencing the physiology of their neighboring cells.Why, then, would the light reactions of photosynthesis be suppressed? We suggest that the biological advantage of lowering the lumenal pH might still be photoprotective: weak acids produced by anaerobic fermentation lead to NPQ and a slower photosynthetic electron transport in the dark, which reduces electron input into the electron transport chain in conditions where electron sinks are limiting before the CBB cycle fully activate or alternative electron outlets, such as water to water cycle59, chlororespiration60, flavodiiron-or hydrogenase-dependent pathways61 not yet/anymore active."

The Y(I) was determined by Y(I) = Pm\u2019/Pm. Pm and Pm\u2019 are the maximal absorbance changes induced by applying the saturating light under dark and actinic light, respectively70.\nFor P. tricornutum, Porphyridium purpureum, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, C. pyrenoidosa and P. patens, cells were washed with their freshmedium, respectively. 4.5mMHAcwas added to decrease the pH to 5.5 and the KOH was used to adjust the pH back to 7.5. When NaAc was used to induce fluorescence quenching, final concentration of NaAc of 50mM was reached. In total, 100\u03bcM nigericin was used to collapse the pH gradient formed across thylakoid membrane.\nThe eosinophilic algae NIES-2499 was grown in photoautotrophic mediumat pH3.5.When4.5mMHAcwas added and thepHofmedium remained basically unchanged.\nChlorophyllfluorescence images ofArabidopsis thaliana, Triticum aestivum and Sorghum bicolorwere obtained with Imaging-PAM under aerobic conditions.

Before measurements, all plants were dark-incubated for 30min. For Arabidopsis thaliana, two leaves were injected with acetic acid (0.1M), whiles the other two leaves were injected with the same amount of water and other leaves were untreated as controls. For Triticum aestivum and Sorghum bicolor, two\ndifferent positions of one leaf were injected with acetic acid (0.1M), and the other two locations were injected with the water as control."
