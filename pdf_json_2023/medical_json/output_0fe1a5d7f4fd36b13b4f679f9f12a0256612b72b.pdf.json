    "abstractText": "Background Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumor, and chemotherapy can effectively improve the prognosis. MicroRNA-331 (MiR-331) is associated with poor cancer outcomes. However, the role of miR-331 in osteosarcoma remains to be explored. Methods Drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells were cultured, and their exosomes were purified. The secretion and uptake of exosomes by drug-resistant osteosarcoma and osteosarcoma cells were confirmed using a fluorescence tracking assay and Transwell experiments. The effects of drug-resistant exosomes on cell proliferation were determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. siRNA-Drosha and neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 were used to determine the transfer of miRNAs. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect the role of autophagy in the regulation of drug-resistant cell-derived exosomal miR-331-3p. Results Exosomal miR-331-3p levels in drug-resistant cells were higher than in exosomes from osteosarcoma cells. The exosomes secreted by the drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells could be absorbed by osteosarcoma cells, leading to acquired drug resistance in previously non-resistance cells. Inhibition of miRNAs resulted in reduced transmission of drug resistance transmission by exosomes. Exosomes from drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells transfected with siRNA-Drosha or treated by GW4869 could not enhance the proliferation of MG63 and HOS cells. Finally, miR331-3p in the exosomes secreted by drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells could induce autophagy of osteosarcoma cells, allowing them to acquire drug resistance. The inhibition of miR-331-3p decreased drug resistance of osteosarcoma cells. Conclusion Exosomes secreted from chemoresistant osteosarcoma cells promote drug resistance through miR331-3p and autophagy. Inhibition of miR-331-3p could be used to alleviate drug resistance in osteosarcoma.",

            "text": "Methods Drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells were cultured, and their exosomes were purified. The secretion and uptake of exosomes by drug-resistant osteosarcoma and osteosarcoma cells were confirmed using a fluorescence tracking assay and Transwell experiments. The effects of drug-resistant exosomes on cell proliferation were determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. siRNA-Drosha and neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 were used to determine the transfer of miRNAs. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect the role of autophagy in the regulation of drug-resistant cell-derived exosomal miR-331-3p.\nResults Exosomal miR-331-3p levels in drug-resistant cells were higher than in exosomes from osteosarcoma cells. The exosomes secreted by the drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells could be absorbed by osteosarcoma cells, leading to acquired drug resistance in previously non-resistance cells. Inhibition of miRNAs resulted in reduced transmission of drug resistance transmission by exosomes. Exosomes from drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells transfected with siRNA-Drosha or treated by GW4869 could not enhance the proliferation of MG63 and HOS cells. Finally, miR331-3p in the exosomes secreted by drug-resistant osteosarcoma cells could induce autophagy of osteosarcoma cells, allowing them to acquire drug resistance. The inhibition of miR-331-3p decreased drug resistance of osteosarcoma cells.\nConclusion Exosomes secreted from chemoresistant osteosarcoma cells promote drug resistance through miR331-3p and autophagy. Inhibition of miR-331-3p could be used to alleviate drug resistance in osteosarcoma.\nKeywords Osteosarcoma, Exosome, microRNA-331, Autophagy, Chemosensitivity, Chemoresistance\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

            "text": "Osteosarcoma is a rare tumor of mesenchymal origin characterized by the production of osteoid (immature bone) by malignant cells [1\u20133], mainly in individuals > 60\u00a0years old and between 10 and 19\u00a0years [2\u20134]. Osteosarcoma metastasizes fast and has a high mortality rate [1\u20134]. The relapse rate in patients with osteosarcoma is 30% with localized disease and 80% with metastatic disease, and the long-term survival in patients with recurrent disease is < 20% [3]. Chemotherapy (mostly based on methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CDDP)) can improve the survival of osteosarcoma patients combined with surgery [5, 6], but chemoresistance can affect the outcome of osteosarcoma [7]. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in osteosarcoma is very important.\nExosomes (exo) play important roles in the transport of material (e.g., proteins, metabolites, and RNA) between cells [8]. Active tumor cells secrete more exo into the tumor microenvironment than normal cells or dormant tumor cells would [9]. Tumor cell-secreted exo can transform normal cells into tumor cells [9]. Besides, exo contain bioactive molecules (including microRNAs (miRNAs) [10]) and cytokines that regulate the signaling pathway of the recipient cells, further regulating the invasion, proliferation, and chemosensitivity of the tumor cells [11]. miRNAs can target the 3\u2019 untranslated region of their target mRNAs directly, suppressing mRNA translation into protein [12], playing significant roles in multiple cellular pathways, and can regulate tumor cell invasion, proliferation, and chemosensitivity [13\u201315]. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exo can regulate osteosarcoma proliferation through the Hedgehog signaling pathway [16]. In addition, drugresistant osteosarcoma cells can transfer multiple drugresistant phenotypes to non-drug-resistant cells via exo, thereby inducing drug resistance in previously non-drugresistant osteosarcoma cells [17]. It has been reported that miR-331-3p might lead to poor cancer outcomes in breast cancer [18], but there are no studies on the association between miR-331-3p and osteosarcoma.\nAutophagy is markedly associated with drug resistance in osteosarcoma [19]. In autophagy, damaged organelles, mitochondria, and macromolecules are degraded, which plays important roles in cell growth, development, differentiation, and death [20]. Various chemotherapy drugs can induce autophagy, and autophagy is correlated with drug resistance [19, 21, 22]. Several chemotherapy drugs induce apoptosis in cancer cells, but the cancer cells can upregulate autophagy to escape apoptosis [19].\nTherefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between exo miR-331-3p and osteosarcoma and to explore whether miR-331-3p could regulate drug\nresistance via autophagy in osteosarcoma. The results could provide a better understanding of the role of miRNAs in osteosarcoma and the implications in clinical practice."

            "text": "PHK26-labeled exo from MG63/CDDP and HOS/ CDDP cells could be absorbed by MG63 and HOS cells (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013d).\nSince exo usually carry miRNAs and there were no expression differences of miR-199a between OSCs and OSCs/CDDP, miR-199a was used to identify the transmission of miRNA between OSC/CDDP and OSC. According to the Transwell experiment, PHK26-labeled exo and exo/CDDP could be internalized by HOS cells (Fig.\u00a02c\u2013d). The qRT-PCR analyses showed that the exo could be transferred into MG63 and HOS cells to overexpress miR-199a (Fig.\u00a0 2e\u2013h). Hence, miRNA could be transported from OSC/CDDP into OSC.\nmiRNAs carried by\u00a0exo from\u00a0CDDP\u2011resistant cells could confer CDDP resistance to\u00a0previously non\u2011resistant cells The inhibition curve of CDDP on drug-resistant and sensitive cells of MG63 and HOS was shown in Fig.\u00a03a. The IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of MG63 and MG63/CDDP were 1.48\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 8.71\u00a0\u03bcg/ mL, respectively. The IC50 of HOS and HOS/CDDP were 1.16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 5.10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. In the presence of CDDP at 10, 30, and 60\u00a0 ng/mL, the proliferation of MG63 and HOS cells was enhanced after treatment with exo isolated from their CDDP-resistant cell counterparts, according to the MTT assay (Fig.\u00a03b). In order to further clarify whether the emergence of OSC resistance is due to exosome-carrying miRNAs, we treated OSC/CDDP with siRNA-Drosha. Exo from MG63/CDDP and HOS/ CDDP transfected by siRNA-Drosha could not enhance the proliferation of MG63 and HOS cells treated with CDDP (Fig.\u00a0 3c). These results suggest that the miRNAs carried by exo from CDDP-resistant cells could confer CDDP resistance to previously non-resistant cells.\nOSCs were co-incubated with OSCs/CDPP to see if the additional administration of GW4869 (an exo formation inhibitor) inhibits the transfer of exo and miRNA. The expression of miR-199a in OSCs co-incubated with CDDP-resistant cells was (G1) higher than in the OSCs group (G3). OSCs co-incubated with OSCs/CDPP, which treated by GW4869 (G2) was lower than that in G1 (Fig.\u00a0 3d). Hence, GW4869 inhibits exo formation and miR-199a transfer. These results suggest that exo from OSC/CDDP could transfer miRNAs. GW4869 inhibited exo formation and thus was unable to transport miRNA. miR-199 was reduced after inhibition of exo release using GW4689, indicating that it is the exo that transports the miRNA from the resistant cells to the recipient cells. miR-199a was chosen because it was not differentially expressed in the two cells. Therefore, after blocking exo, miRNA from drug-resistant cells could not enter the recipient cells.\nmiR\u2011331\u20113p carried by\u00a0exosomes could promote autophagy to\u00a0induce drug resistance in\u00a0osteosarcoma According to the LC3 flow cytometry, exo from CDDPresistant OSCs could induce autophagy of OSCs (MG63 and HOS). The LC3 levels were higher in CDDP-resistant OSCs than in OSCs (MG63 and HOS); in the P2 region, the percentage of LC3 expression was 0.8% and 1.0% for MG63 and MG63 + exo, and 85.7% and 98.4% for MG63 + exo/CDDP and MG63/CDDP; the percentage of LC3 expression was 0.2% and 0.4% for HOS and HOS + exo, and the percentage of HOS + exo/CDDP and HOS/CDDP LC3 expression accounted for 82.5% and 98.6% (Fig.\u00a04a).\nSince the level of miR-331-3p in the exo from MG63/ CDDP cells is higher than in MG63 cells, and miRNAs from drug-resistant cells cause drug resistance in non-drug-resistant cells, we speculate that miR-331-3p may be one of them. To further clarify the role of miR331-3p, we transfected OSC/CDDP with an inhibitor of miR-331-3p.\nIn the presence of CDDP, the cell proliferation of the MG63/CDDP group was the highest, and the cell proliferation of MG63 could be improved after treatment by exo from MG63/CDDPs. The cell proliferation of MG63s treated by exo from MG63/CDDP cells transfected by a miR-331-3p inhibitor was reduced compared with that of MG63 cells treated by exo from MG63/CDDP without transfection of the miR-331-3p inhibitor. HOS and MG63 cells showed similar results (Fig.\u00a0 4b). According to the results of qRT-PCR and western blotting, the expression of LC3 increased in MG63 cells after treatment by exo from MG63/CDDP but decreased in MG63 cells treated by exo from MG63/CDDP cells transfected with the miR-331-3p\ninhibitor. In addition, the expression of p62 was reduced in MG63 after treatment by exo from MG63/ CDDP cells but was increased in MG63 cells treated by exo from MG63/CDDP cells transfected with the miR331-3p inhibitor. miR-331-3p inhibitor could reduce autophagy compared with MG63/CDDP and MG63 treated with exo/CDDP group. HOS cells and MG63 cells showed similar results (Fig.\u00a04c\u2013e). Therefore, miR331-3p carried by exo from drug-resistant cells could promote autophagy to induce drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells."

            "text": "This study aimed to explore the mechanism of exosomal miR-331-3p in chemoresistance in osteosarcoma. The results suggest that exo secreted from chemoresistant osteosarcoma cells promote drug resistance through miR-331-3p and autophagy. Hence, inhibition of miR331-3p could alleviate drug resistance in osteosarcoma.\nIn this study, the transmission role of miRNA-exo was investigated in drug resistance in osteosarcoma. It has been reported that osteosarcoma chemoresistant cells can transmit multiple drug-resistant gene phenotypes into non-drug-resistant cells via exo, causing non-drugresistant OSCs to develop drug resistance [17]. Besides, exo could carry DNAs, RNAs, lipids, and proteins for cellular communication in tumor development, and it has been widely investigated in bone sarcomas [25, 26]. Exosomes participate in numerous physiological and pathological processes via intercellular substance exchange and signaling [27]. The results of the present study are consistent with the previous study. Indeed, the non-resistant OSCs could internalize the exo isolated from CDDP-resistant OSCs, but non-resistant OSCs exposed to exo from CDDP-resistant OSCs developed CDDP resistance. Furthermore, chemoresistance could be prevented by inhibiting the production of exo or suppressing miRNAs. Non-code RNA has been widely explored. It has been reported that CircDOCK1 promotes the tumorigenesis and cisplatin resistance of osteogenic sarcoma via the miR-339-3p/IGF1R axis [28]. Furthermore, previous studies focused on the cellderived exo that regulate the proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance of OSCs. BMSCs-derived exo miR-208a promotes the proliferation and metastasis of OSCs [29]. Another study found that the exo secreted by metastatic OSCs could deliver miR-675 to regulate the bioactivity of osteosarcoma by targeting Calnexin-1 [17]. Wang et\u00a0al. [30] reported that the exo secreted by tumor-related fibroblasts could transmit miR-1228 into OSCs to promote the proliferation and invasion of OSCs by targeting SCAI (which encodes a suppressor of cancer cell invasion). Thus, miRNA-containing exo are an effective transmission route for various factors affecting the biological behavior of OSCs, including drug resistance.\nIn the present study, the involvement of miR-331-3p was identified as being involved in the transmission of drug resistance in OSCs. It has been reported that miR331-3p could inhibit the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells by targeting NRP2 (Neuropilin 2) [30]. Another study showed that circ-0001649 sponges and inhibits the function of miR-331-3p, suppressing nonsmall cell lung cancer [31]. A high serum miR-331-3p expression was considered a high-risk factor for esophageal cancer recurrence [32]. A study on miR-331 and\nchemotherapy in leukemia reported that an increased expression of miR-331 might lead to poor treatment efficacy and low survival rates [33]. Therefore, these previous studies support that miR-331-3p can cause tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Still, the previous studies also highlight that the expression profile and regulatory roles of miR-331-3p are different across different tumor types. Bi et\u00a0al. [34] reported that miR-331-3p could suppress osteosarcoma progression by targeting MGAT1, involving the Bcl-2/Bax and Ent/\u03b2-Catenin pathways. Zu et\u00a0 al. [35] reported that miR-331-3p overexpression inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion by targeting the SOCS1/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Still, no relevant reports have been published regarding chemoresistance in osteosarcoma and miR-331-3p. In the present study, the expression of miR-331-3p in chemoresistant OSCs was higher than in non-resistant OSCs, suggesting that miR-331-3p participates in the chemoresistance or aggressiveness of osteosarcoma. Most importantly, the present study showed that miR-331-3p can be transmitted among cells via exo, and that the exocarried miR-331-3p can induce chemoresistance in previously non-resistant cells. Still, the exact mechanisms of this chemoresistance due to miR-331-3p remains elusive in osteosarcoma, and, as highlighted above, the mechanisms might differ among cancer types. Nevertheless, so far, miR-331-3p is upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells, where it induces resistance to gemcitabine by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling through ST7L [36]. miR-331-3p has been shown to participate in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [37\u201339], and cells that underwent that transition can be more resistant to chemotherapy [40]. Since the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is also involved in chemoresistance in osteosarcoma, the involvement of miR-331-3p and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the chemoresistance of OSCs should be investigated in future studies. Therefore, the miR-331-3p-related chemoresistance observed here, and the miR-331-3p-inhibited osteosarcoma aggressiveness in previous studies [34, 35] could be context-dependent. Still, studies are needed since the same pathways appear to be involved in both processes.\nIn this study, exo from chemoresistant OSCs could induce autophagy of OSCs. Programmed cell death including ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, governed by a diverse array of genes, serves as a pivotal mechanism in the progression and maturation of organisms. Additionally, it is essential for the preservation of tissue and organ equilibrium and contributes to numerous pathological phenomena [41]. Autophagy is an important pathway involved in the drug resistance of cancer cells [18]. In the present study, miR-331-3p could cause autophagy of OSCs, while the inhibition of\nmiR-331-3p suppressed the autophagy of OSCs. Inhibition of miR-331-3p and miR-9-5p ameliorated Alzheimer\u2019s disease by enhancing autophagy [42]. Thus, it could be hypothesized that exo miR-331-3p induced autophagy and increased the cell vitality and chemoresistance of OSCs. Still, autophagy is a complex process that several factors can influence in\u00a0 vivo, and additional studies are still necessary to examine the effects and regulation of autophagy in OSCs. Still, it is increasingly being recognized that autophagy is involved in the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma [43], and thus modulating autophagy could help improve the prognosis of the patients through a better response to treatments. Of course, this study has limitations. It focused on a single miR-331-3p, while it is known that exo carry multiple miRNAs that can act synergistically or additively on the target cells. The exact molecular mechanisms involved in miR-331-3p-related chemoresistance were not investigated. Only cells were investigated, and future studies should include xenografts in nude mice."
