Extension to Dynamic Spatial Models: Investigate the extension of the proposed functional SAR model to dynamic settings where temporal evolution of spatial units is considered. This could involve incorporating time lags of the dependent and independent variables to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics, addressing challenges related to temporal autocorrelation in addition to spatial autocorrelation.

Application to Other Types of Functional Data: While this study focuses on age distributions in Japanese cities, future research could apply the functional SAR model to other types of functional data. Examples include environmental data (e.g., temperature, pollution levels over time), economic indicators (e.g., price indices, employment rates across regions over time), and health data (e.g., disease incidence rates across geographical regions). Exploring these areas could demonstrate the versatility of the model and uncover new insights into spatial dependencies in diverse fields.

Development of Robust Estimation Techniques: Given the complexities of estimating parameters in the functional SAR model, especially with regard to endogeneity and the uniqueness of solutions, there is a need for developing more robust estimation techniques. Future research could explore alternative estimation strategies that are less sensitive to model specifications and instrumental variable selection, enhancing the model's applicability in empirical research.

Incorporation of Nonlinear Spatial Interactions: The current model assumes linear relationships between spatial units. Investigating nonlinear spatial interactions could uncover more complex patterns of interdependence, especially in contexts where the impact of one unit on another is not proportionally constant. This could involve developing nonlinear functional forms of the SAR model and devising appropriate estimation methods to capture these nonlinearities.

Spatial Network Structures Beyond Adjacency: The paper utilizes spatial weight matrices based on geographical adjacency or social connections. Future research could explore more complex network structures, such as hierarchical or multiplex networks, where spatial units interact in more complicated ways than mere adjacency. This would involve adapting the functional SAR model to accommodate these complex structures and examining how they influence spatial interdependencies.
