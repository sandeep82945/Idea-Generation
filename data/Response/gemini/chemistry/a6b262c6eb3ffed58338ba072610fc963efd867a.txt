1. **Investigate the biosynthetic pathways of novel polyketides from Aspergillus strains.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as gene knockout and complementation studies, metabolomics, and isotopic labeling experiments.
2. **Explore the potential of Aspergillus polyketides as new therapeutic agents.** This could involve studying their efficacy and safety in animal models of disease, as well as conducting clinical trials.
3. **Develop new strategies for activating silent polyketide BGCs in Aspergillus strains.** This could involve using genetic engineering techniques, epigenetic modifiers, or co-culture with other microorganisms.
4. **Study the structural features of PKSs from Aspergillus strains.** This could help to elucidate the molecular basis of starter unit selectivity and chain-length control in polyketide biosynthesis.
5. **Use biosynthetic engineering approaches to improve the efficient discovery of novel polyketides from Aspergillus strains.** This could involve engineering PKSs to produce novel polyketides or modifying the expression of genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis.
