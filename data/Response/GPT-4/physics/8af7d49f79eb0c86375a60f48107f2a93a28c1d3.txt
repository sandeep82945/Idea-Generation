Enhancing Hydrogel Stability and CO2 Capture Efficiency: Investigate the chemical modification or crosslinking strategies of the amine-infused hydrogel to enhance its thermal stability and CO2 capture efficiency. This could involve exploring different crosslinking agents, polymer backbones, or incorporation of nanoparticles to improve the mechanical properties and durability of the hydrogel under various operational conditions.

Optimization of Fly Ash Content and Type: Conduct a systematic study to explore the effect of different types and amounts of fly ash (FA) on the adsorption capacity and kinetics. This could include comparing class F FA with other classes (e.g., class C) or treated FA to determine the optimal FA type and concentration that maximizes CO2 adsorption capacity while maintaining desirable physical properties of the hydrogel.

Exploration of Novel Amine Functionalization Techniques: Experiment with different amine functionalization techniques and amine types to enhance the CO2 capture capacity of the hydrogel. This could include using branched or cyclic amines, exploring bi-functional or multi-functional amines, and developing novel techniques for embedding amines into the hydrogel matrix to increase the efficiency of CO2 capture.

Development of Regeneration and Recycling Processes: Investigate efficient and cost-effective methods for regenerating the amine-infused hydrogel after CO2 capture, focusing on minimizing energy consumption and solvent loss. This research could explore thermal, pressure swing, or chemical regeneration processes and evaluate the impact of regeneration cycles on the hydrogel's structural integrity and adsorption capacity.

Life Cycle Assessment and Economic Analysis: Perform a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis of the amine-infused hydrogel CO2 capture process. This would involve evaluating the environmental impact, operational costs, and scalability of the technology. The goal would be to assess the feasibility and sustainability of deploying this technology on an industrial scale, considering the entire lifecycle from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal or recycling.
