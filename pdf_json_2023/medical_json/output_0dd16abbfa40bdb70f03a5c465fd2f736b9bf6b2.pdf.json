    "abstractText": "Both condensed and hydrolysable tannins (CTs and HTs, respectively) have the ability to reduce enteric CH4 production in ruminants. However, the precise mechanism of action is not fully understood. Among the proposed hypotheses are the reduction of ruminal digestibility, direct control action on protozoa, reduction of archaea, and a hydrogen sink mechanism. In this in vitro study, which simulated rumen fermentation, two additives, one containing CTs (70% based on DM) from quebracho and one with HTs (75% based on DM) from chestnut, at four levels of inclusion (2, 4, 6, 8% on an as-fed basis) were added to the fermentation substrate and tested against a negative control. Both types of tannins significantly reduced total gas (GP) and CH4 (ml/g DM) production during the 48 h of incubation. The lower GP and CH4 production levels were linked to the reduction in dry matter digestibility caused by CTs and HTs. Conversely, no significant differences were observed for the protozoan and archaeal populations, suggesting a low direct effect of tannins on these rumen microorganisms in vitro. However, both types of tannins had negative correlations for the families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082 and positive correlations for the genera Prevotella and Succinivibrio. Regarding the fermentation parameters, no differences were observed for pH and total volatile fatty acid production, while both CTs and HTs linearly reduced the NH3 content. CTs from quebracho were more effective in reducing CH4 production than HTs from chestnut. However, for both types of tannins, the reduction in CH4 production was always associated with a lower digestibility without any changes in archaea or protozoa. Due to the high variability of tannins, further studies investigating the chemical structure of the compounds and their mechanisms of action are needed to understand the different results reported in the literature.",

However, the precise mechanism of action is not fully understood. Among the proposed hypotheses are the reduction of ruminal digestibility, direct control action on protozoa, reduction of archaea, and a hydrogen sink mechanism. In this in vitro study, which simulated rumen fermentation, two additives, one containing CTs (70% based on DM) from quebracho and one with HTs (75% based on DM) from chestnut, at four levels of inclusion (2, 4, 6, 8% on an as-fed basis) were added to the fermentation substrate and tested against a negative control. Both types of tannins significantly reduced total gas (GP) and CH4 (ml/g DM) production during the 48 h of incubation. The lower GP and CH4 production levels were linked to the reduction in dry matter digestibility caused by CTs and HTs. Conversely, no significant differences were observed for the protozoan and archaeal populations, suggesting a low direct effect of tannins on these rumen microorganisms in vitro. However, both types of tannins had negative correlations for the families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082 and positive correlations for the genera Prevotella and Succinivibrio. Regarding the fermentation parameters, no differences were observed for pH and total volatile fatty acid production, while both CTs and HTs linearly reduced the NH3 content. CTs from quebracho were more effective in reducing CH4 production than HTs from chestnut. However, for both types of tannins, the reduction in CH4 production was always associated with a lower digestibility without any changes in archaea or protozoa. Due to the high variability of tannins, further studies investigating the chemical structure of the compounds and their mechanisms of action are needed to understand the different results reported in the literature.\nKEYWORDS\ncondensed tannins, hydrolysable tannins, methane, microbiota, digestibility, ruminants"

            "text": "The livestock sector contributes to approximately 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and one of the most important GHGs is methane (CH4) (1). Ruminants contribute significantly to CH4 emissions due to enteric fermentation, accounting for 17% of global CH4 emissions (2). Moreover, ruminants release nitrogen into the environment in the form of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O), another powerful GHG. Both CH4 and nitrogen emissions are not only related to environmental problems but are also associated with energy and organic matter losses that hamper the efficiency and productivity of farms (3).\nAmong the different strategies to reduce the environmental impact of ruminants, tannins have been evaluated for their potential in reducing enteric methanogenesis (4). Tannins are polyphenolic substances with great chemical variability, and in terrestrial plants, they are classified into two groups: condensed tannins (CTs) and hydrolysable tannins (HTs). Condensed tannins are polymers of flavonoids with high molecular weights, while HTs are polyesters of gallic acid and various individual sugars and are characterized by lower molecular weights than CT (5). Condensed tannins are mostly found in the vacuole and in the epidermal or subepidermal layers of leaves and fruit, while HTs accumulate in the cell wall. However, tannins are also frequently found in other plant tissues, such as bark, wood, roots, seeds and fruits. Furthermore, tannin concentrations vary according to the plant species and genotype, tissue developmental stage, and environmental conditions (6).\nAs reported by Mueller-Harvey et\u00a0al. (7), despite the widespread occurrence of tannins (both CTs and HTs) in the plant kingdom, there are still large gaps in our knowledge regarding their role in plants and their impact on animals. In the diets of ruminants, it is possible to include tannins due to the use of naturally tannin-rich forages, such as some legumes, including sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), or due to the addition of purified tannin extract. Some of the most popular purified tannin extracts come from mimosa (Mimosa tenuiflora) and quebracho (Schinopsis balansae) for CTs, while a common HTs source is chestnut (Castanea sp.) (8).\nDepending mostly on their concentrations in the diet but also on animal species and other factors (such as the chemical structure of the tannins, dietary composition and interaction with other compounds, adaptation of the ruminant to the presence of tannins, etc.), tannins could have both adverse and positive effects on ruminants (9).\nOne of the positive effects of tannins is the reduction of CH4 emitted from ruminal fermentation (3, 10, 11). This effect has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo trials, but there are some aspects that need to be\u00a0explored, such as the effect of different dietary concentrations and the effect of different sources and types of tannins. In this regard, Jayanegara et\u00a0al. (8) found a greater and more constant effect of HTs in comparison with CTs in reducing CH4 emissions with less adverse effects on digestibility. As highlighted by several authors (4, 5, 12, 13), it is necessary to investigate whether the reduction in CH4 emissions is linked to a reduction in the digestibility of organic matter, particularly fiber. Moreover, tannins can exert a control action on both archaea and protozoa, which are related to methane production in the rumen (14\u201318).\nDue to their high affinity for proteins and the formation of tanninprotein complexes, tannins can also cause a reduction in protein\ndegradability in the rumen (19). The consumption of CTs and HTs by ruminants can reduce the production of ruminal ammonia, lowering urinary nitrogen excretion and increasing faecal nitrogen excretion (7, 20, 21). This shift can improve the soil nitrogen status and reduce N2O emissions and nitrogen leachate into groundwater.\nThe negative effects include reduced palatability of the diet associated with the reduction of dry matter intake but also the reduction of feed digestibility. Additionally, when tannins are fed in high concentrations, they can be\u00a0toxic to the animal (22).\nA common generalization is that with tannin concentrations lower than 5% of the feed dry matter, there are mainly positive effects on ruminants, while with higher concentrations, negative effects prevail. However, it is important to consider the type of tannin, the plant from which it derives, as well as the type of diet and the species of ruminant (e.g., goats are more adapted to tannins compared to cows) (23). Furthermore, high concentrations of tannins in the diet would be\u00a0 difficult to apply commercially due to the high cost of tannin extracts.\nThe study aims to determine the effects of the dietary inclusion level of purified CTs and HTs on total gas and CH4 production, ruminal fermentation parameters and rumen microbial population by an in vitro method. The use of several regular dose levels for both types of tannins in this paper aims to allow a regression study that could help predict the effects of tannins at any low practical dietary dosage."

The fermentation substrate was composed (g/kg) of second-cut meadow hay (447), pelleted alfalfa hay (147), pea protein seeds (147), commercial concentrate mix (17% CP on DM, 220), and a vitamin\u2013mineral mix (9) and contained 159, 391, 17.4 and 76.9 g/kg DM of CP, aNDFom, EE, and ash, respectively.\nAll treatments were tested versus a negative control (substrate without CT or HT addition). All treatments were tested in triplicate in two incubation runs.\n2.2. In vitro gas production technique\nAnimal procedures were conducted under the approval of the University of Milan Ethics Committee for animal use and care and with the authorization of the Italian Ministry of Health, authorization no. 904/2016-PR.\nRuminal fluid was collected from two fistulated dry Italian Friesian dairy cows fed a diet composed of 66% hay and 34%\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 03 frontiersin.org\nconcentrate. Depending on the treatments, 300 mg of fermentation substrate and the relative quantity of tannin inclusion (0\u20132\u20134\u20136\u20138%) were weighed into 120 ml serum bottles.\nThe fermentation medium was prepared according to Menke and Steingass (24) following the procedures previously described by Pirondini et\u00a0 al. (25). After the addition of 40 ml of the fermentation medium, the headspace of the incubation was flushed with N2, and then the incubation vials were hermetically closed with rubber tops and placed in a shaking water bath (80 RPM) at 39.5\u00b0C for 48 h.\nGas production (GP) was determined by measuring the headspace pressure in the incubation vials (26). The pressure was recorded after 24 and 48 h of incubation using a digital manometer (model 840,082, Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ, United\u00a0States). After the headspace pressure was measured, at each reading time, 5 ml of gas was collected from each vial using a gastight syringe and stored in airtight vials for subsequent methane analysis. At the 24-h incubation interval, after gas collection, the pressure inside each vial was brought back to the atmospheric value using needles to avoid high headspace pressures that could compromise normal microbial activity (26)."

Two of the three replicates per treatment were intended for the determination of VFA production, NH3 concentration and dry matter digestibility (DMD), while the remaining replicate was intended for the count of protozoa and the study of the microbiota.\nTwo of the three replicates per treatment were individually transferred into 50 ml Falcon tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. After this first centrifugation, 5 and 30 ml of supernatant were sampled for subsequent VFA and NH3 analyses, respectively. The incubation vials were carefully washed with distilled water to remove all substrate residuals, and the contents were transferred into the respective Falcon tubes for a second centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. After the second centrifugation, the supernatants were discharged, and the Falcon tubes with the precipitated residue were\nplaced in an oven at 60\u00b0C until constant weight for the determination of the undigested DM.\nFor VFA determination, 1 ml of 25% meta-phosphoric acid was added to 5 ml of supernatant as described by Colombini et\u00a0al. (27). After 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged again at 3,500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. VFA analysis was performed by injecting 2 \u03bcl of the supernatant into a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (Varian Chromatography Systems, Walnut Creek, CA, United\u00a0States) using a Nukol fused silica capillary column (30 m length; 0.25 mm diameter; 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness; Supelco) as reported by Pirondini et\u00a0al. (28).\nThe NH3 concentration was determined with the Kjeldahl method, with only the distillation and titration, using a Raypa NP-1500-MP Kjeldahl distiller (Raypa, Terrassa, Spain).\nAt the end of the incubation, the third replicate was used for the protozoal count and the microbiota analysis. Each vial was shaken to obtain a homogeneous solution, and then, for the protozoal count, 5 ml of fermentation medium was sampled, added to 5 ml of formalin and stored at room temperature, while for the microbiota analysis, 10 ml of fermentation medium was sampled and stored at \u221280\u00b0C pending extraction.\nThe protozoal count was performed as described by Dehority (29). The DNA from the rumen fluid was extracted using the NucleoSpin Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) following the procedures and using the reagents suggested by the kit manufacturer. Amplification of the V4 region of the 16S gene was conducted as\u00a0 described by Parada et\u00a0 al. (30). DNA was diluted at 10 ng/\u03bcl. For\u00a0 amplification, the following primers were used: 515F-Y: 5\u2032-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA and 926R: 5\u2032-CCGYCAATT YMTTTRAGTTT. The amplifications were performed using 5 \u03bcl of the extracted DNA in a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Thermo-Fisher, MA, United\u00a0 States) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplifications were performed for 27 cycles using 55\u00b0C as the annealing temperature. The libraries were purified with Beads Amplure XP\u00a00.8X and amplified with Indexes Nextera XT Illumina; they were normalized, mixed, and loaded on the MiSeq platform using the 2 \u00d7 300 bp (paired-end) approach to generate a minimum of 50,000 sequences (\u00b120%). The raw sequences R1 and R2 (raw reads) were verified and filtered by quality, trimmed by the primers, and fused by QIIME2 v8 software.

This was confirmed by the slope values of the two equations of prediction (\u22122.52 and \u2212 1.37 for CTs and HTs, respectively, for both types of tannins p < 0.001, Table\u00a02).\nThe CH4 production (ml/g DM) at 0\u201324 and 0\u201348 h of incubation was reduced as the level of inclusion increased for both types of tannins (p < 0.001).

Both types of tannins reduced the GP expressed as ml/g DM (0\u201348 h). The percentage reduction induced by both types of tannins at the different levels of inclusion was between 1.91 and 8.61% for CTs and between 1.44 and 5.74% for HTs. The reduction percentages of GP obtained in this study are similar to those observed by Jayanegara et\u00a0 al. (8) with tannins extracted from chestnut and quebracho at concentrations of 3.95, 5.92, and 7.89%, except for CTs at 8% for which level of inclusion we\u00a0obtained an 8.61% reduction of GP while Jayanegara et\u00a0al. (8) obtained a 13.4% reduction. Condensed tannins at 6% inclusion tended to reduce the GP by approximately 8.61% compared to the control, while HTs did not differentiate significantly from the control after Tukey\u2019s adjustment. Both types of tannins significantly reduced CH4 production at 24 h. Interestingly, during the second day of incubation (24\u201348 h), CTs continued to reduce CH4 production differently than HTs, with the result that CTs were more effective in reducing CH4 production than HTs during the 48 h of incubation. This can be\u00a0due to the greater ruminal degradability of HTs compared to CTs (8), which leads to a reduction in the effect of HTs with the time of incubation. As reported by McSweeney et\u00a0 al. (19), HTs are more susceptible to microbial hydrolysis than condensed tannins, which agrees with the results of the present study.

The same higher effect of CTs compared to HTs on CH4 production in vitro was observed by Bhatta et\u00a0 al. (17) but not by Hassanat and Benchaar (33), who achieved similar reductions in CH4 production when CTs from quebracho and HTs from chestnut were included at concentrations higher than 10% of the diet.\nThe reduction of rumen methanogenesis due to the presence of tannins can be\u00a0caused by the following four mechanisms of action: direct effect on rumen methanogens, direct control of the protozoan population, reduction of diet digestibility, especially fiber degradability, and the sink action of hydrogen (18, 23, 34, 35). In our study, the reduction in CH4 production is probably due to the reduction in DMD more than the other proposed mechanisms; however, although at minor extent, the other proposed mechanisms of action cannot be\u00a0excluded.\nIndeed, in this experiment, archaeal and protozoan populations were not affected by the treatments; although, as report by Aboagye and Beauchemin (22), tannins can reduce their activity. Protozoa and methanogens have a symbiotic relationship in the rumen, and a high\nnumber of protozoa is often associated with higher CH4 production (36\u201338) since approximately 37% of total rumen methanogenesis is produced by protozoa-associated methanogens (39).\nIn the literature, it is possible to find different responses to the presence of tannins for both methanogens and protozoa, with variation due to the type and source of tannins; in addition, the substrates used could explain the different results reported despite the similar dose of tannins (17, 34, 40, 41). In this sense, concentrated rich substrates encourage the growth of protozoa (42, 43). Sarnataro and Spanghero (44) reported a depressive effect of chestnut tannins on protozoa when the substrate was ground corn meal but not when the substrate was a mixture of feeds, simulating a total mixed ration for ruminants. In our experiment, the significant effect of the type of tannin on total protozoa without an effect due to the level of inclusion is unclear.\nRegarding the type of tannin, generally, it is stated that HTs has a greater effect on CH4 reduction compared to CTs due to the supposed different mechanism of action: HTs act directly on methanogens, inhibiting their growth or their activity, while CTs reduce CH4 more through the indirect effect caused by the reduction in fiber degradability (22, 45). In an in vitro study, Jayanegara et\u00a0 al. (8)\nTABLE\u00a07 Protozoa count and relative abundance of Entodinium and Holotrica.\nCondensed tannin (CT) extract Hydrolysable tannin (HT) extract SE p value\n% Tannin extract\n0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 T1 L2 T\u00d7L3\nTotal protozoa (\u00d7103 cell/ml) 318 397 398 390 414 318 380 317 308 332 33.2 0.034 0.340 0.582\nEntodinium (% total protozoa) 98.1 97.3 98.9 98.8 98.8 98.1 98.7 98.2 97.7 99 0.505 0.918 0.453 0.213\nHolotricha (% total protozoa) 1.86 2.71 1.07 1.24 1.17 1.86 1.26 1.77 2.28 1.04 0.505 0.918 0.453 0.213\n1T: p value of the type of tannin effect, CT vs. HT. 2L: p value of the level of inclusion effect. 3T\u00d7L: p value of the interaction of the fixed effects.\nFIGURE\u00a01 Percentage of the major phyla present in the bacterial population.\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 09 frontiersin.org\ncompared two different HTs, chestnut and sumach tannins, with two CTs, mimosa and quebracho tannins, and contrary to our work, they observed a greater reduction in CH4 production with the addition of HTs. However, similar to our results, Jayanegara et\u00a0al. (8) did not observe any significant differences in methanogen populations between the types of tannins, suggesting that a discrepancy may exist between CH4 production, the number of methanogens, their activity, and the number of protozoa. This discrepancy could also be\u00a0explained by the reduction of the DMD, particularly of the fibrous fraction. In a recent paper, Foggi et\u00a0al. (46) tested in vitro CTs from quebracho and HTs from chestnut (inclusion level of 2%), finding a CH4 reduction of approximately 10% for both CTs and HTs, without a significant reduction in the number of protozoa but accompanied by a reduction in digestibility.\nRegarding the bacterial population, the increase in the genus Prevotella in the presence of tannins can be\u00a0explained by its ability to tolerate tannins (47, 48) and also to a lower presence of competitors. Moreover, species of Prevotella are hydrogen-consuming bacteria that can produce propionate via the succinate pathway from the fermentation of sugar or via the acrylate pathway through the fermentation of lactate (49, 50). The reduction in CH4 production induced by tannins can lead to an increase in hydrogen concentration, which could promote the development of Prevotella. Additionally, species of Prevotella are noncellulolytic bacteria known to use ammonia for amino acid synthesis (51). Similar to what we\u00a0 have observed, Sarnataro and Spanghero (44) observed an increase in P. ruminicola in\u00a0vitro associated with a decrease in rumen NH3 when chestnut HTs were added to the substrate. In line with these results, de Sant\u2019ana et\u00a0al. (52) reported an increase in the genus Prevotella when dairy goats were fed a diet including tannins. However, Carrasco et\u00a0 al. (14) observed a reduction effect of quebracho and chestnut tannins on Prevotella in an in vivo experiment with Holstein steers, although with a high degree of variance among animals.\nWe also observed an increase in the genus Succinivibrio, which belongs to the Succinivibrionaceae family and is responsible for the utilization of hydrogen to produce succinate, with tannin supplementation. Succinivibrionaceae and methanogens are mutually exclusive and could represent a potential target for a CH4 mitigation strategy (53). Contrary to what was reported in several works (8, 22, 45), the present study did FIGURE\u00a02 Relationship between the level of the treatments and proteobacteria.\nFIGURE\u00a03 Correlation between tannins and families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082 and genera Prevotella and Succinivibrio*. *: Correlation between the level of inclusion of condensed (CT) and hydrolysable (HT) tannin extracts and the percentage of the presence of families Bacteroidales_BS11 (A) and F082 (B) and genera Prevotella (C) and Succinivibrio (D).\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 10 frontiersin.org\nnot reveal a significant difference between tannin sources (CTs and HTs) when added at the same concentration in terms of negative effects on DMD and VFA production. Hassanat and Benchaar (33) reported a significant reduction (\u22126%) in VFA production with quebracho and chestnut tannins when added at concentrations higher than 5%. In our study, we\u00a0recorded a linear reduction in total VFA production for both types of tannins. Several in vitro studies (17, 33, 54, 55) have reported a reduction in branched VFAs (isobutyrate, isovalerate and valerate) caused by CTs and HTs. Branched chain volatile fatty acids are a byproduct of amino acid deamination in the rumen, and in our experiment, the reduction in these branched VFAs was caused mainly by HTs. This observation is supported by the reduction in NH3 concentration that we\u00a0registered for both CTs and HTs. According to the work of Hassanat and Benchaar (33), the NH3 concentration in the fermentation buffer at the end of the incubation was linearly reduced as the level of both quebracho and chestnut tannins increased, reaching a reduction of almost 17 and 18% with the inclusion level at 8% for CTs and HTs, respectively. Similar results were found by Foggi et\u00a0al. (46), who observed a reduction in NH3 concentration of 13 and 10% for CTs and HTs, respectively, when included at 2%.\nThe reduction of GP, DMD and VFA, without changes in the relative quantities of acetate and propionate, could indicate, for both types of tannin, an effect of reducing the degradability more generally of the organic matter rather than the fiber. This is also to be\u00a0seen in relation to changes in the microbiota, especially in the population of cellulolytic bacteria."

            "heading": "5. Conclusion",
            "text": "In this study, condensed tannins from quebracho were more effective in reducing CH4 production compared to HTs from chestnut. However, no significant changes in protozoan and archaeal populations were observed. Negative correlations with both CTs and HTs were observed with the families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082, while the correlations were positive for the genera Prevotella and Succinivibrio. Moreover, both types of tannins caused a reduction in GP, DMD and NH3 and linearly lowered VFA production as the level of tannins increased. This leads us to assume that the reduction in CH4 production is more related to the reduction in DMD caused by tannins than to their direct action on methanogens and protozoa. This could be\u00a0detrimental to feed efficiency. On the other hand, the lower NH3 concentration observed with tannins may suggest a lower ruminal protein degradation, which would lead to a reduction of urinary nitrogen excretion and an increase in the faecal one, with favorable environmental and agronomic repercussions.\nDue to the high variability of CTs and HTs, further studies investigating the chemical structure of the compounds and their mechanisms of action are needed to understand the different results observed in the literature.\nFinally, in vivo studies will show possible long-term effects such as ruminal microbial adaptation."
