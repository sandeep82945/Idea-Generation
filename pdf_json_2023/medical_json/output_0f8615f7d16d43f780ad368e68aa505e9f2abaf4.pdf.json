    "abstractText": "Purpose To compare the failure rates and the prevalence of technical complications between full-coverage tooth-supported monolithic zirconia (MZ) and porcelain-veneered zirconia (PVZ) fixed dental prosthesis, based on a systematic literature review. Methods An electronic search was performed in three databases, supplemented by hand searching. Several statistical methods were used. Results Seventy-four publications reported 6370 restorations (4264 PVZ; 2106 MZ; 8200 abutment teeth; 3549 patients), followed up until 152 months. A total of 216 prostheses failed, and survival was statistically significant different between groups. PVZ had higher occurrence of complications than MZ; the difference was especially greater for either minor or major chipping. The difference in prevalence of either minor or major chipping was statistically significant for PVZ prostheses between cementation with glass ionomer and adhesive resin cement (higher), adhesive resin and resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC, higher), and between RMGIC (higher) and glass ionomer cement. For MZ the difference was significant only for minor chipping between RMGIC (higher) and adhesive resin cement. Abutment teeth to PVZ prostheses more often lost vitality. Decementation was not observed with RMGIC. Air abrasion did not seem to clinically decrease the decementation risk. The 5-year difference in the occurrence of minor or major chipping between MZ and PVZ prostheses was statistically significant, but nor for catastrophic fracture. Conclusion Tooth-supported PVZ prostheses present higher failure and complication rates than MZ prosthesis. The difference in complications is striking when it comes to chipping. Clinical relevance Awareness of the outcome differences between different types of zirconia prostheses is important for clinical practice.",

The main advantages of Y-TZP include exceptional mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and resistance to corrosion [1, 2]. One of the greatest disadvantages of the Y-TZP, at least when it comes to dental restorations, is the less than desirable translucency of the material. Translucency is important, as a certain degree of translucency of the dental ceramic is needed to let the natural background color shine throughout the translucent * Bruno Ramos Chrcanovic bruno.chrcanovic@mau.se; brunochrcanovic@hotmail.com Shahed Shihabi shihabishahed@gmail.com 1 Faculty of\u00a0Odontology, Malm\u00f6 University, Malm\u00f6, Sweden 2 Department of\u00a0Prosthodontics, Faculty of\u00a0Odontology,\nMalm\u00f6 University, Carl Gustafs V\u00e4g 34, 214\u00a021\u00a0Malm\u00f6, Sweden\n1 3\nmaterial, so the dental restoration can present a more natural appearance [3].\nThere are today two main categories of dental prostheses made of Y-TZP: monolithic zirconia (MZ), in which the bulk of the restorations is made of zirconia and external stains are painted in order to better copy the natural colors of teeth, and porcelain-veneered zirconia (PVZ), in which a framework of zirconia is fabricated, upon which veneering porcelain is applied [4]. Prostheses made of MZ are stronger, but present a compromised aesthetic aspect, while PVZ prostheses, with a core of Y-TZP and an outer layer of ceramic (also called as bilayer structure), better resemble natural teeth, although are vulnerable to chipping and delamination [2]. This may predispose PVZ to a higher prevalence of clinical technical complications.\nQuestions have been raised concerning the effect of cement type on the clinical outcomes, although a recent review failed to find evidence of difference in the complication patterns between adhesive and conventional cementation for zirconia and lithium disilicate tooth-supported crowns [5].\nTherefore, the purpose of the present systematic review of the literature was to test the null hypothesis of no difference in the failure rates and the prevalence of technical complications between full-coverage tooth-supported MZ and PVZ fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). The review presented an additional focus on the effect of the type of cement used on the occurrence of complications."

These are dental prostheses with a bulk of zirconia fabricated by computer-aided design and computeraided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and painted with external stains [4].\nPorcelain-veneered zirconia restorations were defined as those with a zirconia framework enhanced with veneering porcelain [9].\nSuccess was defined as a prothesis that had remained unchanged (no complication or intervention) over the observation period. Survival was defined as the cases in which the prothesis remained in\u00a0situ, with the occurrence of any complication, while still in function. Prostheses removed or replaced were considered failed prostheses [10].\nBiological complications included caries, loss of tooth vitality, periapical infection, mobility, and abutment loss.

Adhesive resin was most commonly used for cementation of the prostheses, and natural teeth were most often observed in the opposing arch occluding to the zirconia prostheses.\nIn general, PVZ FDPs had a higher occurrence of complications than MZ FDPs. The difference was, in particular, greater when either minor or major chip-offs were considered. Decementation was more commonly seen in prosthesis cemented with adhesive resin than with glass ionomer, with no occurrences with resin-modified glass ionomer.\nTable\u00a02 shows the prevalence of minor and major chipping among tooth-supported PVZ and MZ prostheses, for the different types of cementations applied. If the factor time is not considered, the difference of the prevalence of\n1 3\nchipping was statistically significant for PVZ prostheses between cementation with glass ionomer and adhesive resin cement (for minor chipping), resin-modified glass ionomer and adhesive resin cement (for both minor and major chipping), and between resin-modified glass ionomer and glass ionomer cement (for both minor and major chipping). For MZ the difference was significant only for minor chipping between resin-modified glass ionomer and adhesive resin cement.\nTable\u00a03 shows the prevalence of decementation among tooth-supported PVZ or MZ prostheses, for the different types of cementations applied, between prostheses that had their inner surface air abraded or not. No cases of decementation were observed for prostheses cemented with resin-modified glass ionomer, regardless of whether air abraded or not. Air-abraded PVZ FDPs decemented more often when cemented with conventional glass ionomer cement.\nTable\u00a04 shows the prevalence of vitality loss among teeth supporting PVZ or MZ prostheses for the different types of\ncementations applied. In general, abutment teeth to PVZ prostheses more often lost vitality.\nTable\u00a05 shows the prevalence of minor or major chipping among tooth-supported PVZ or MZ prostheses, for when air abrasion prior to cementation was conducted or not. No difference was observed in the prevalence of chipping, either minor or major, when either PVZ or MZ were air abraded or not.\nA total of 216 prostheses were considered failure, and the mean time from prosthesis cementation to failure was not statistically significant different between the groups (p = 0.935; Mann\u2013Whitney test). There was no clear concentration of failures in any period of the follow-up, either for PVZ or MZ prostheses (Tables\u00a06 and 7, respectively). The 5-year CSR was lower for PVZ than for MZ prostheses. The survival was statistically significant different between groups (p = 0.007; log-rank test). As the number of cases entering the longest follow-up intervals was very low for both groups, the survival between the groups was compared after the follow-up was limited to 5 years,\n1 3\nwhich still resulted in a statistically significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001; log-rank test). When the data were limited to follow-up up to 5 years, the CSR was 88.7% and 93.3% for PVZ and for MZ prostheses, respectively.\nThe estimated 5-year occurrence of minor chipping, major chipping, and catastrophic fracture for MZ prostheses were 0.076% (95% CI 0.042, 0.111, SE 0.018), 0.080% (95% CI 0.042, 0.118, SE 0.019), and 0.301% (95% CI 0.244, 0.357, SE 0.029), respectively (Table\u00a0S1, see Supplementary material). The estimated 5-year occurrence of minor chipping, major chipping, and catastrophic fracture for PVZ prostheses were 10.445% (95% CI"

            "text": "The aim of the present review was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes between full-coverage tooth-supported MZ and PVZ FDPs. The results showed that MZ prostheses present higher survival rates than PVZ prostheses (p = 0.007). The reason for this difference can be due to the great difference in the occurrence of some complications that led to removal and/ or replacement of the prosthesis. A much higher occurrence of porcelain chipping/fracture, framework fracture, and vitality loss were observed among PVZ than among MZ restorations.\na Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test b Fishers\u2019 exact test c No events in either group\n1 3\nThe group of PVZ restorations had a significantly higher mean follow-up time than the group of MZ restorations, namely, a mean of 48.2 and 38.4 months, respectively. This could be one of the reasons contributing to a higher rate of technical complications among PVZ in relation to the MZ ones. It is expected that the longer the mean follow-up time, the higher the risk of presenting more complications. However, it does not explain all the possible reasons for a\nhigher occurrence of technical complications among PVZ prostheses.\nPVZ prostheses are more prone to chip-off fractures than MZ prostheses\u2014the latter do not have a veneering ceramic and are expected to have less chipping and fracture complications [87]. The greater prevalence of chipping among PVZ restorations can due to the mismatch in the thermal expansion between the porcelain and the zirconia framework,\na Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test b Fishers\u2019 exact test c No cases cemented by resin-modified glass ionomer and air abraded d No events in both groups\na Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test b Fishers\u2019 exact test\nInterval start time (years) Number entering interval\nNumber withdrawing during interval Number exposed to risk\nProsthesis failures ISR (%) CSR (%) SE\nInterval start time (years) Number entering interval\nNumber withdrawing during interval Number exposed to risk Prosthesis failures ISR (%) CSR (%) SE\n1 3\nwhich leads to the development of residual stresses, which in turn leads to initiation of cracking and veneer chipping. During the cooling process, thermal gradients can develop in crowns and FDPs and create another source of residual stress [88\u201391]. In comparison to restorations made of PVZ, monolithic designs have a higher load-bearing capacity [92]. It is also important to point out that resin-based cements may increase the strength of zirconia restorations to fracture, with\u00a0glass ionomer cements being usually associated with lower fracture strength [93\u201395], which is in accordance with the results of the present review\u2014the rates of minor or major chipping, for either PVZ or MZ, were higher for when the prostheses were cemented with glass ionomer in comparison to adhesive resin cements. Another important issue is the distinction of zirconia crowns with different yttria contents (3 and 5 mol%), as 3 mol% zirconia crowns fracture at almost twice the loads of the 5 mol% zirconia crowns [93]. In this context, the authors of an in\u00a0vitro study suggested that it would be wise to avoid pre-treatment of 5Y crowns with air abrasion, as this reduced the strength of these crowns, the same not happening with 3Y-crowns [93], although the authors of another in\u00a0vitro study, although also showing a difference in fracture load between 3 and 5Y crowns, suggested that crowns fabricated from 5Y-Z may be particle abraded if luted with resin cements [94]. Unfortunately, it was not possible to make an analysis of either failure or complications in relation to the different yttria contents of the restorations, as detailed information about the zirconia material used was not always provided. For example, there was information in some studies that either \u201cLava,\u201d or \u201cBruxZir,\u201d or \u201cPrettau Zirconia\u201d was used, but with no further detail reported. This is an issue since dental zirconia from these three brands are available as either 3Y-TZP or 5Y-TZP.\nThe higher prevalence of framework fracture among PVZ than in MZ prostheses (0.8% vs. 0.2%, respectively) may be related to the inherent difference in the restoration design between these two types of zirconia restorations, as PVZ restorations present a thinner core of zirconia material than MZ restorations, which in turn influences the thickness of the crown/prosthesis margins [96]. Therefore, it may be expected that PVZ prosthesis would have a higher risk of framework fracture.\nTeeth supporting PVZ prostheses presented a higher rate of vitality loss than teeth supporting MZ prostheses (1.5% vs. 0.3%, respectively), which could be related to the fact that veneer restorations are thicker, meaning that more underlying tooth structure needs to be removed [2], raising the risk of overheating the pulp, which is increased as the dentin thickness decreases. The mean tooth structure removal for full-crown restorations is greater for PVZ than for MZ restorations [97]. Dentin is an efficient insulator and will dissipate heat if an adequate amount of thickness remains. As such, trauma to the pulp tissue via heat is dependent on the\nproximity of the heat source to the pulp [98]. Greater extent of destruction of coronal and root structure was found to be a significant predictor of root canal therapy after single-crown placement [99]. It has been suggested that leaving 2\u00a0mm of dentinal thickness is sufficient to provide the pulp with protection from most restorative procedures [100]. Tooth vitality is suggested to contribute positively to the survival of single crowns and fixed dental prostheses [101].\nThe rate of decementation was higher when prostheses were cemented with zinc phosphate (5.0%)\u2014only cases of PVZ prostheses were cemented with this type of cement. The zinc phosphate cement should not be recommended due to unfavorable properties such as brittleness and water solubility [102]. When it comes to the most commonly used cements, decementation was more commonly seen among prostheses cemented with adhesive resin than with glass ionomer in the MZ group. This goes against the results of an in\u00a0vitro study, in which it was observed that adhesive resin cements present higher bond strength than glass ionomer cements in the bonding between zirconia and dentin [103]. However, a study observed no difference in the clinical performance for the cementation of zirconia copings between these two types of cement after 48 months [104]. As there is still no clear consensus about the difference in performance between the use of these two cements for zirconia restorations, one can only hypothesize that the possible cause for these findings could be related to the downsides of resin cements. Adhesive bonding has the disadvantage of being technique sensitive, as multiple steps of pretreatment are required and the prepared surface can easily get contaminated [93, 105]. Moreover, zirconia does not bond to resinbased cement as strongly as a silica-based ceramic [93, 106]. These factors could possibly have influenced the results.\nNo cases of decementation were observed among prostheses cemented with resin-modified glass ionomer, even when the inner surfaces of the prostheses were not air abraded previously to cementation. In general, the rate of decementation for zirconia restorations cemented with either conventional glass ionomer or adhesive resin cements was higher when the inner surface of the prostheses were air abraded before cementation. However, it seems that there is still some controversy whether air abrasion alters the shear bond strength of zirconia ceramic restorations [107]. Nevertheless, sandblast damage introduced into the ceramic undersurfaces causes further reductions in strength levels, with surface abrasion treatments possibly being an important degrading factor in long-term performance of all-ceramic crowns [108].\nThe problem with decementation when adhesive cements are used may be due to the already aforementioned reasons, although in\u00a0vitro studies showed that resin-modified glassionomer cement presented the same level of retentive quality or the same mean removal stress as resin luting agents\n1 3\n[109\u2013111]. Moreover, similar clinical outcomes for the cementation of zirconia restorations between these cements were observed in a clinical study [112].. However, there is no clear consensus on the subject, as other in\u00a0vitro studies showed that resin-modified glass ionomer cements present lower mean bond strengths between zirconia and dentin than resin-based luting cements [103, 113]. The results were not favorable for the conventional glass ionomer cement though. Compared to conventional glass ionomer, resin-modified glass ionomer cements have been showing better clinical performance [114].\nThe present review is not without limitations. First of all, most of the included studies were retrospective reports, which inherently results in flaws, manifested by the gaps in information and incomplete records. The number of technical complications observed is very probably underestimated, since not all studies reported data on all types of complications. Second, several professionals were involved in the treatment of these patients, which could have had some influence on the failure and complications rate. Third, much of the research in the field is limited by small cohort sizes and short follow-up periods, which could have led to an underestimation of the actual clinical outcomes."
