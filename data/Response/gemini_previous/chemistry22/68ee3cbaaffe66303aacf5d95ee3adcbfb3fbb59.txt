1. **Investigate the relationship between the pore structure and the photocatalytic activity of nanofibers.** This could be done by varying the pore size, shape, and distribution, and then measuring the photocatalytic activity of the nanofibers. This information could be used to design nanofibers with optimal photocatalytic activity for specific applications.


2. **Develop new methods for preparing porous nanofibers with improved mechanical properties.** This could be done by exploring new polymer blends, electrospinning techniques, or post-treatment methods. Improved mechanical properties would make porous nanofibers more suitable for use in applications where they are subjected to mechanical stress, such as filtration and catalysis.


3. **Explore the use of porous nanofibers for other environmental applications.** In addition to photocatalysis, porous nanofibers could be used for applications such as water filtration, air purification, and soil remediation. These applications could take advantage of the high surface area, porosity, and chemical reactivity of porous nanofibers.


4. **Investigate the use of porous nanofibers for biomedical applications.** Porous nanofibers could be used for applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing. These applications could take advantage of the biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability of porous nanofibers to promote cell growth and differentiation.


5. **Develop new methods for scaling up the production of porous nanofibers.** Currently, the production of porous nanofibers is limited by the slow speed of electrospinning. New methods for scaling up the production of porous nanofibers would make them more cost-effective and enable their use in a wider range of applications.
