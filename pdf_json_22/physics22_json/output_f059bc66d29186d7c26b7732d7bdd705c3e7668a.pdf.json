    "abstractText": "Accurate modeling of diffusive transport of nanoparticles across nanopores is a particularly challenging problem. The reason is that for such narrow pores the large surface-to-volume ratio amplifies the relevance of the nanoscopic details and of the effective interactions at the interface with pore walls. Close to the pore wall, there is no clear separation between the length scales associated with molecular interactions, layering of the solvent at the interface with the pore and the particle size. Therefore, the standard hydrodynamic arguments may not apply and alternative solutions to determining average transport coefficients need to be developed. We here address this problem by offering a multiscale ansatz that uses effective potentials determined from molecular dynamics simulations to parametrise a four state stochastic model for the positional configuration of the particle in the pore. This is in turn combined with diffusivities in the centre of the pore and at the pore wall to calculate the average diffusion constant. We apply this model to the diffusion of fullerenes in a toluene filled slit nanopore and calculate the mean diffusion coefficient as a function of the pore size. We show that the accuracy of our model is affected by the partial slip of the toluene on the pore wall. 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The reason is that for such narrow pores the large surface-to-volume ratio amplifies the relevance of the nanoscopic details and of the effective interactions at the interface with pore walls. Close to the pore wall, there is no clear separation between the length scales associated with molecular interactions, layering of the solvent at the interface with the pore and the particle size. Therefore, the standard hydrodynamic arguments may not apply and alternative solutions to determining average transport coefficients need to be developed. We here address this problem by offering a multiscale ansatz that uses effective potentials determined from molecular dynamics simulations to parametrise a four state stochastic model for the positional configuration of the particle in the pore. This is in turn combined with diffusivities in the centre of the pore and at the pore wall to calculate the average diffusion constant. We apply this model to the diffusion of fullerenes in a toluene filled slit nanopore and calculate the mean diffusion coefficient as a function of the pore size. We show that the accuracy of our model is affected by the partial slip of the toluene on the pore wall.\n2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

            "text": "The transport of suspended particles through relatively narrow pores is important in a wide range of situations, examples of which include oil recovery [1], sap transport in plants [2], lymphatic flow [3], nanosensing devices [4\u20136] and devices relying on electroosmotic flow [7\u20139]. From the point of view of daily applications, transport in pores is at the foundation of particle separation techniques, such as liquid chromatography [10\u201312]. It is therefore natural that a significant scientific effort has been invested to understand diffusive transport, also from the theoretical perspective [13\u201317].\nParticle diffusion through (slit) nanopores involves several characteristic time and length scales, spanning from the nanoscopic molecular interactions up to the mesoscopic pore size, and typically is described empirically by means of macroscopic models [18\u201320]. These models account for the particle-pore interactions by means of effective potentials extracted from adsorption[5] isotherms [18] or Hamaker constants [21], as well as effective diffusion coefficients [22,23]. This is successful when the particle size is clearly much larger than the scale of viscosity gradients in the fluid close to the pore wall, or the range of the interaction potentials between the pore and the particle. However, for nanoparticles suspended in organic solvents, there is no length scale separation. Accordingly, the details of the atomistic interactions between the nanoparticles, the solvent, and the solid pore material are of enormous importance and cannot be accounted for by means of traditionally taken effective parameters. On the nanoscale, one established approach to studying porous structures are molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The latter are particularly useful for the quantification of basic interactions and dynamic processes determining adsorption or diffusion coefficients [24\u201327]. So far,\nmany pore types including biological, slit and round pores with different solvents have been addressed [28,29,26,30\u201332]. However, when diffusive transport is strongly affected by adsorption and desorption from the pore wall, molecular simulations reach limits in the types of systems and solute concentrations that can be covered explicitly [26].\nThe limitations in sampling efficiency of unconstrained MD simulations can, for the interaction potential, be overcome by Monte Carlo simulations. However, the latter do not include real time dynamics like diffusion. Current approaches on incorporating static interactions and diffusive dynamics into a combined scheme for predicting larger-scale dynamics reduce the molecular results into effective diffusion coefficients and still do not account for particle\u2013particle interactions [33,34]. It is therefore necessary to develop multiscale approaches that incorporate the molecular details in the study of diffusion, in order to provide accurate information on transport on the mesoscale.\nIn this study, we propose a simple model to calculate the transport coefficients for nanoparticles in pores, by evaluating the interaction potentials between the particle and the pore, as well as particle\u2013particle interactions in bulk and at the interface, where we also evaluate the diffusivity of particles. We then separate the space into an interfacial and a bulk region and calculate the probabilities to find the particle as a freely diffusing entity or as part of the complex. Convoluting this information with the appropriate diffusivities yields the effective diffusion coefficient, as a function of the pore width. We expect that this approach is particularly useful in the regime of strong particle\u2013wall interactions and pore widths in which the opposing walls are sufficiently far such that there is bulk solvent in the central part of the pore. Consequently, our model accounts for solvation properties and the particle\u2013particle interactions and predicts the retention times directly from a limited and accessible simulation effort.\nWe apply this approach to transport of fullerenes dissolved at finite dilution in toluene in hydroxylated alumina pores (Fig. 1a). Specifically, we study C60 and C70 which were found to have quite diverse translocation velocities across the porous media, as shown\nFig. 1. Representation of the simulated alumina slit pore. a) Sample system of the sim The C60, coloured in orange, is close to the hydroxylated alumina surface. The width of potential in the umbrella sampling simulations. b, c) Orientation of an exemplary tolue\nby chromatographic studies [35\u201339]. We assess the likelihood of dimer formation under confinement and compare it with the data about agglomeration in bulk solutions [40\u201346]. Interestingly, our results show that, for the case under study, dimer formation occurs only in the proximity of the precipitation concentration and hence are in practice hindered as long as the suspension is stable. Accordingly, we show that the transport of fullerenes in toluene is controlled by their single-molecule diffusion coefficient."

            "text": "We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a fullerene suspended within a slit nanopore filled with toluene using the GROMACS simulation software [47\u201353]. For toluene, the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations (all atoms) (OPLS-AA) [54] force field is used and as input structure, a box of liquid toluene, equilibrated at 298.15K by Caleman et al. [55], is used to fill the pore. For the fullerenes, C60 and C70, the atoms of the aromatic carbon of the OPLS-AA force field are used together with a structure from NMR data [56,57], as has been proposed by Monticelli [58]. The pore wall consists of bulk alumina (Al2O3) with one hydroxylated surface and one non\u2013hydroxylated, aluminium terminated surface, whose force field is taken from previous works [59,60].\nAll simulations are run with a time step of 1fs and bonds involving hydrogen atoms were turned into constraints using the LINCS [61] algorithm. The short range non-bonded interactions are calculated, using a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential switched smoothly to zero between 0.9 and 1.2nm [62]. Long range electrostatic interactions are calculated with the PME technique [63,64].\nThe equilibration of our system first involved minimizing the energy of the system using steepest descent. A short run in the NPT ensemble is conducted for 5ns to obtain the correct density at a pressure of 1bar. Hereby, periodic boundary conditions are applied in all three dimensions and a semiisotropic coupling is used such that the coordinates are only altered in the direction\nulation containing one C60 fullerene, 2010 toluene molecules and an alumina bulk. the pore is indicated as well as the distance d that is constrained with a harmonic ne molecule on the hydroxylated surface, with a side view (b) and top view (c).\nnormal to the pore wall [65,66]. The initial velocities are generated according to a Maxwell distribution of the desired temperature of 293.15K. The leap-frog algorithm is used to integrate the equations of motion, whereas temperature and pressure are controlled with a Berendsen thermostat and barostat [67], respectively. The time constants are 1.0ps and 50.0ps for temperature and pressure, respectively, and the coupling occurs every ten steps. Using built-in tools of GROMACS, we compute the liquid density distribution across the pore to check for bulk toluene density in the center after the equilibration. In all simulations, the obtained density is within 1% of the experimental bulk toluene density of 867.1kg/ m3 [68], which is also the estimated statistical accuracy of our density assessment.\nA simulated annealing step is subsequently conducted at constant volume to facilitate proper equilibration of the surface layers of toluene near the wall. A stochastic integrator with a temperature coupling time of 0.1ps is used to heat the system up to 700K over 3ns, where it is kept for another 3ns. Afterwards it is cooled to the final 293.15K over 4ns, where it is kept for another 2ns. As the final density in the center of the pore resembles bulk toluene density, we immediately continue with a final equilibration step. At this point, one could consider a short NPT run, but we found that such a step does not affect the density profile throughout the pore. Therefore we proceed straight into performing a 1ns long NVT simulation using a leap-frog integrator and a time step of 1fs. The temperature is kept at 293.15K with a Nos\u00e9-Hoover (NH) thermostat [69,70] with coupling every ten steps and a coupling time of 3.5ps. The production run proceeds with the same settings for 10 to 40ns.\nIn all simulations with constant volume, the inner part of the solid crystal is frozen as the force field used cannot properly reproduce the vibrational spectrum of the crystal. The surface layer and the interfacial hydroxyl groups are allowed to rotate and vibrate.\nFor the calculation of the Potential of Mean Force (PMF), umbrella sampling simulations are conducted. A simulation with the particle pulled slowly through the pore from one wall to the other yields the starting configurations for the individual umbrella runs. In the umbrella runs, the center of mass (COM) of the particle is then constrained by a harmonic potential with the equilibrium position determined from the starting configuration. For each system, 36 to 53 windows are simulated. The equilibrium distances are separated by 0.05nm with force constants of 5000 to 8000kJ mol 1 nm 2 in the region close to the surface. In the bulk region, the windows are separated by 0.05 to 0.1nm with force constants of 1500 to 2000kJ mol 1 nm 2. From the simulations, the histograms of position distributions are obtained and converted to a PMF using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [71,72]. Further details on the umbrella simulations can be found in the SI Section 1 and SI-Table 1.\nThe simulations to calculate the PMF between two fullerenes are done in an analogue way. Hereby, the distance between the COM of the fullerenes is constrained with a harmonic potential. In the case of two fullerenes adhered to the wall, the distance constraint is restricted to the plane parallel to the wall, while both fullerenes are constrained to the first potential minimum close to the wall using another harmonic potential with force constant 4000kJ mol 1 nm 2.\nFor all PMF calculations, the statistical uncertainty is estimated by splitting the trajectory into three parts and running the WHAM analysis. We obtain three additional PMFs with the same positional resolution as the full-length PMF. For each bin of the PMF, the statistical uncertainty is estimated as the root mean square deviation of those three PMFs from the original one, that is calculated from the full-length trajectory. These uncertainties will then be used to retrieve uncertainties for all subsequently calculated results (see Section 4.2 for details)."

We restrict the model to the limit of low concentrations, where particle\u2013particle interactions can be treated purely as pair-wise interactions. Hence, we introduce the following four states as most occupied states for nanoparticles (cf. Fig. 2a):\nB: two fullerenes far away from each other and from the walls, i.e. suspended in the \u2018\u2018bulk\u201d as monomers 2B: two fullerenes bound to each other and suspended in the bulk.\nS: two fullerenes trapped at the minimum of the fullerene-wall interaction and far away from each other. 2S: two fullerenes bound to together and trapped at the minimum of the fullerene-wall interaction.\nWe then introduce transitions between each pair of states (cf. Fig. 2a). The diagonal transitions correspond to two particles in the bulk state (i.e. separated by a large distance) directly forming a dimer located at the surface or vice versa. This is assumed to be a composition of two processes, only occurring consecutively, not simultaneously. Thus the diagonal transitions are considered very improbable and are neglected.\nUsing the transition rates kij as defined in Fig. 2a, we can write the balance equations for the population probabilities of each state:\n_pB t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc kBSpB t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe kSBpS t\u00f0 \u00de 2kB2Bp2B t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 2k2BBp2B t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01a\u00de _p2B t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00fekB2Bp2B t\u00f0 \u00de k2BBp2B t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe k2S2Bp2S t\u00f0 \u00de k2B2Sp2B t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01b\u00de _pS t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc kSBpS t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe kBSpB t\u00f0 \u00de 2kS2Sp2S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 2k2SSp2S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01c\u00de _p2S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00fekS2Sp2S t\u00f0 \u00de k2SSp2S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe k2B2Sp2B t\u00f0 \u00de k2S2Bp2S t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01d\u00de At equilibrium the particle concentrations are proportional to the Boltzmann weight e bU where U is the potential of mean force (PMF). For such a concentration profile all local fluxes are vanishing. This so-called detailed balance condition requires the fluxes in the two directions along each side to cancel each other. Accordingly, for the first of the equations this implies\n0 \u00bc kBSpB \u00fe kSBpS|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}\u00bc0 2kB2Bp2B \u00fe 2k2BBp2B|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}\u00bc0 \u00f02\u00de and analogously for the other three equations.\nThus, eqs.

Firstly, when inserting eqs. (3a)\u2013(3c) into the balance Eq. (4), we obtain\n1 \u00bc kSB kBS pS \u00fe 2 kB2B k2BB kSB kBS 2 p2S \u00fe pS \u00fe 2 kS2S k2SS p2S ; \u00f05\u00de\nand thus\n2 kB2B k2BB kSB kBS 2 \u00fe kS2S k2SS\n\" # p2S \u00fe 1\u00fe\nkSB kBS pS 1 \u00bc 0 : \u00f06\u00de\nWhile there are two solutions to this equation, one of which is strictly positive and the other negative. As we require the probability pS to be positive, the solution is given as\npS \u00bc 1 4 kB2B k2BB kSB kBS 2 \u00fe kS2S k2SS\n\" # 1\n1 kSB kBS\n\u00fe ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1\u00fe kSB\nkBS\n2 \u00fe 8 kB2B\nk2BB kSB kBS 2 \u00fe kS2S k2SS \" #vuut 8< : 9= ; \u00f07\u00de\nAs the solution depends parametrically on the ratio of rates (e.g. kSB=kBS), which can be determined from ratios of probabilities according to eq. (3), the next step is to obtain expressions for these probabilities. When picking a particle at random in the system, it can be either in a surface state or in a bulk state with corresponding probabilities psurface and pbulk, respectively. Additionally, it can be either an isolated particle or part of a dimer, with the probabilities p1 and p2, respectively (cf. Fig. 2b). However, these can be different for the surface (p1jsurface;p2jsurface) and the bulk (p1jbulk; p2jbulk) states (see Fig. 2). We then obtain the probabilities for the four states by a combination of these as\npB \u00bc pbulk p1jbulk ; \u00f08a\u00de 2p2B \u00bc pbulk p2jbulk ; \u00f08b\u00de pS \u00bc psurface p1jsurface ; \u00f08c\u00de 2p2S \u00bc psurface p2jsurface : \u00f08d\u00de At equilibrium, the probabilities pbulk and psurface as well as p1 and p2 will be given by the Boltzmann weights / exp bU\u00f0 \u00de, where U is the associated PMF. Accordingly, the probability pbulk is then given by\npbulk / R L z p z\u00f0 \u00de _zR L\nz _z\n\u00bc 1 Z\nR L z exp bU z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de _z\nL z : \u00f09\u00de\nHereby, Z \u00bc R L0 exp bU z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de _z is the partition function, L the half width of the pore, z the parameter determining the boundary between the \u2018\u2018bulk\u201d and the \u2018\u2018surface\u201d state and U z\u00f0 \u00de the PMF of a single particle with the surface (Fig. 3a). Naturally, the zero in zdirection is set to where the particle cannot further penetrate the wall. Additionally, we obtain\npsurface / 1 Z\nR z 0 exp bU z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de _z\nz : \u00f010\u00de\nThe (common) prefactor can be determined from the fact that each particle will be in one of the two states, i.e. pbulk \u00fe psurface \u00bc 1. The ratio of the probabilities is given by\nKSB :\u00bc psurfacepbulk \u00bc R z 0 exp bU z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de _zR L z exp bU z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de _z L z z ; \u00f011\u00de\nand\npbulk \u00bc 1 1\u00fe KSB ; psurface \u00bc KSB 1\u00fe KSB : \u00f012\u00de\nNotably, here we recognize that KSB is the broadly known Henry\u2019s coefficeint in infinite dilution [73,74], which is a measure for the attraction strength of the particle to the wall. This is of particular interest for chromatographic separation since it is a crucial parameter to determine the retention time across a chromatographic column [10\u201312]\nWe continue with determining the probabilities p1 and p2 in an analogue fashion by introducing the dimer distance R (Rs) below which two fullerenes are regarded as a dimer in bulk (surface). Accordingly we have:\nK21jbulk :\u00bc p2jbulk p1jbulk \u00bc R r 0 exp bY r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00der2 _rR R r exp bY r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00der2 _r R 3 r 3 r 3 ; \u00f013\u00de K21jsurface :\u00bc p2jsurface p1jsurface \u00bc R r S 0 exp bW r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00der _rR RS r S exp bW r\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00der _r R 2 S r S2 r S 2 ; \u00f014\u00de\nand\np1jbulk \u00bc 1\n1\u00fe K21jbulk ;p2jbulk \u00bc K21jbulk 1\u00fe K21jbulk ; \u00f015\u00de\np1jsurface \u00bc 1\n1\u00fe K21jsurface ;p2jsurface \u00bc K21jsurface 1\u00fe K21jsurface : \u00f016\u00de\nHereby, Y r\u00f0 \u00de is the PMF between two particles in the bulk liquid and W r\u00f0 \u00de is the PMF between two particles when both are adhered to the surface. The parameters r and r S determine the boundary between the state of two adhered and two isolated particles for the bulk and at the surface, respectively. These are analogous to z and all three are taken to be the position of the edge of the interface layer. A natural choice is the maximum in the PMF. As it will be further discussed in the following section, for the case of fullerenes, the significant structuring occurs for two layers, and hence the maximum of the second potential barrier of the respective PMF is chosen to denote the interface region (see Fig. 3).\nIn both of the latter cases, R and RS are determined implicitly by the concentration. The volume integral runs over the volume corresponding to a single particle, i.e. for a number concentration c, the integration boundaries are given by\nR \u00bc c 1=3 ; \u00f017\u00de RS \u00bc c z \u00f0 \u00de 1=2 : \u00f018\u00de We can express the ratios of transition rates in eq.

We first calculate the residence probabilities for C60 and C70 from the respective PMFs U;Y;W . The latter are obtained from MD simulations with umbrella sampling for the two fullerenes C60 and C70 in bulk toluene and in a toluene filled slit nanopore with a hydroxylated sapphire alumina wall.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, U z\u00f0 \u00de possesses a minimum in the PMF at direct contact with the wall. It is separated by a high barrier from a secondary global minimum for both C60 and C70, where the fullerene particle is separated from the wall by a solvent layer that is 1 toluene molecule thick, mostly adoptiong planar alignment of the aromatic carbon ring to the wall (Fig. 1b,c). The two minima are followed by smaller oscillations around the bulk value at larger distances from the wall. This suggests that fullerenes will readily access the two surface states from the bulk, and hence they are both taken to be part of the interface layer. However, the depth\nof these minima is such that at room temperature the fullerenes will spend only limited time at the pore walls.\nThe PMFs of C60 and C70 differ by three main aspects. First, the larger size of C70 shifts the PMF away to slightly larger separations as compared to C60. Second, the anisotropy of C70 induces a small inhomogeneity in the first minimum, relating to the different possible orientational configurations (Fig. 4), with the two principle axes parallel to the walls. Third, the depth of the minima of C70 are smaller and the height of the barriers are larger as compared to C60.\nWe then proceed to calculate the PMF between two C60 in bulk liquid (Fig. 3b) b) to obtain an estimate for the enthalpy of solvation. We find a value of DE \u00bc 7:4 0:6kJ mol 1(note: included error estimate), which is in good agreement with the enthalpy of solvation of C60 in toluene determined by experiments to be about -8.7kJ mol 1 [40\u201345] (see SI Section 2 for details). We note that Banerjee [46] reported PMF data with lower attractive strength of only about 4kJ mol 1. While the procedure to calculate the PMF is similar to our case, the force field used differs, which probably causes the differences.\nIn the following we complement the PMF of two nanoparticles in toluene in the bulk (Y r\u00f0 \u00de) with the PMF between two nanoparticles at the interface (W r\u00f0 \u00de). Like in U z\u00f0 \u00de, we find two well defined minima in both Y r\u00f0 \u00de andW r\u00f0 \u00de, except that now the two particles in contact make up a dominant state, while the separation by one toluene molecule is higher in free energy (cf. Fig. 3). In the bulk we find that the height of the barriers between these two states of C70 is slightly smaller than these between two C60, a feature that is opposite at the interface. The depth of these minima, however, suggests that at room temperature, dimers will be only transient."

            "text": "With these PMFs, we can resort to the four state model for both C60 and C70, to calculate the Henry\u2019s coefficient and estimate the\nlikelihood for the agglomeration of fullerenes in bulk and at the interfaces. We present the results for C60 and C70 at concentrations of 0.014kg m 3 (Table 1), which is about 1% of the solubility limit of C70 [75]. As a result (upper part of Table 1), we obtain the fraction of fullerene particles in each of the four states: a single particle in the bulk, on the surface, or as dimers in the bulk or on the surface, as stated by eq. (8). From this data, at the precipitation limit, the fraction of dimers seems to be significant for both particle types. However, away from the limit the fraction of dimers drops significantly (see SI Section 3 and SI-Fig. 1 for details). Hereby, we estimate the confidence of all calculated values by disturbing all involved PMFs up to their estimated uncertainty (cf. Section 2), one at a time, and solving the four state model. The confidence interval is determined from the root mean square deviation of all perturbed results from the unperturbed result.\nFurther analysis of the data allows us to report the Henry\u2019s coefficients (lower part, column 1 of Table 1) KSB \u00bc psurface=pbulk for C60 and C70 in these pores. As expected, KSB are very similar for the two particles, differing by less than 10% and fully within the statistical uncertainty. Thus we do not expect large differences in their adsorption behaviour. Consistently, the associated retention times adopt the same value for C60 and C70 for the present data (lower part, last column in Table 1). Therefore, we do not expect chromatographic separation to happen in this type of setup, which is indeed the case. Actually, more complex surface functionalizations, mostly relying on polyaromatic hydrocarbons or long carbon chains are used for the separation of C60 from C70 [35\u201337,39].\nTo measure the strength of agglomeration in the bulk and at the pore wall, we calculate the quantities K21jbulk and K21jsurface, respectively, following eqs. (13) and (14). We notice that K21jbulk is larger than one for C60 and C70, thus the particles favor the adhered state. When comparing the values for C60 and C70 (lower part, column 3 in Table 1), we see, that the agglomeration of C70 in bulk toluene is stronger than this of C60, which is also consistent with the smaller solubility of C70 than of C60 [75].\nIn contrast, when looking at fullerenes adhered to a surface, a significant drop in the K21 coefficient is observed compared to bulk values (lower part, column 4 in Table 1). Actually, for C70 K21jsurface is smaller than one, suggesting that particles favor the monomeric state, as a consequence of the more shallow minimum in the PMF. Thus, we would expect an overall dissociation of the fullerenes in small pores, where the surface state dominates the bulk state. In any case the difference of the weight of the dimers compared to that of the monomers p1 V1 is negligible as it is less than 2% for both particles and up to the solubility limit, whereas it increases beyond (see SI Section 3 and SI-Fig. 1 for details)."

We focus on transport parallel to the pore walls, where the diffusion\ncoefficient can be extracted directly from the umbrella sampling simulations (see methods Section 2 and SI Section 1). To simplify the analysis, we focus on concentrations below the precipitation limit, such that the fullerenes are mainly in the single molecule state. Consequently, contributions of dimers to the overall transport can be omitted.\nIn order to asses the role of the potential and the surface functionalisation, we complement our hydroxylated alumina wall with a wall where the alumina surface is terminated by aluminium atoms carrying partial charge (with the system being overall neutral). The overall width of the pore is 6.8nm to ensure bulk properties of toluene in the middle of the pore and no cross-talk of the two solid\u2013liquid interfaces (Fig. 4a). Similar to the hydroxylated wall, the wall with exposed aluminium also demonstrates two minima separated by a high barrier. However, for both C60 and C70 the minimumwhere the fullerenes are in contact with the wall is unstable relative to the bulk. Besides the second shallow minimum, the potential is overall repulsive, for C70 more so than for C60."

While providing interesting information about the interplay between effective interactions and diffusivity, this data will also serve as a benchmark in the comparison with our modeling efforts.\nFirst, we analyze the diffusivity of C60 and C70 in the pore centre (denoted as Dcentre), where the effective potentials of both walls vanish (column 2 in Table 2). In the range of positions in the pore of 2.8nm until 4.2nm we find DC60centre \u00bc 5:0 10 10m2s 1 and DC70centre \u00bc 4:9 10 10m2s 1. This compares reasonably well to bulk diffusion coefficients DC60bulk \u00bc 5:7 10 10m2s 1;DC70bulk \u00bc 5:5 10 10m2s 1 obtained from independent simulations of a fullerene in simple bulk liquid.\nThe bulk diffusion coefficients are themselves in reasonable agreement [76] with the prediction from the Stokes\u2013Einstein-Sut herland formula DSES \u00bc kBT=6pgR. Here, the viscosity g was determined using the Green\u2013Kubo formula to be 8.5 10 4Pa s, while the hydrodynamic radii R of C60 and C70 are set to 0.52 nm and 0.54nm, respectively (see SI Section 4 for details). Consequently, DC60SES \u00bc 4:9 10 10m2s 1 and DC70SES \u00bc 4:7 10 10m2s 1.\nNotably, there is a small but significant difference of the order of 10% between Dbulk and Dcentre for both C60 and C70. This shows that, while from the structural point of view, the toluene solvent is indeed in the bulk state, the effects of the pore walls on the diffusive transport are significantly more long ranged.\nWe now focus on the diffusivity at the pore wall Dsrfc (column 3 in Table 2). Here, we set the zero distance from the surface (z \u00bc 0)\nto the two-part layout. Solution of the four state model for the probabilities of a 3 and 1.00 10 5nm 3 for C60 and C70, respectively, resulting in a concentration of\nby the position of the outer edge of the fullerene located in the first minimum of the PMF. This provides a good reference state for all systems considered. With this definition, we find that the diffusion coefficient of both fullerene types in close proximity to the wall drops due to the surface friction, as expected. Interestingly, however, the decrease is less than 30% at the hydroxylated surface, where the diffusivity adopts a value of Dsrfc \u00bc 4:2 10 10m2s 1 and Dsrfc \u00bc 3:8 10 10m2s 1 for C60 and C70, respectively (see Fig. 4b). On the other hand, on the surface with exposed charges, Dsrfc \u00bc 0:7 10 10m2s 1 for both particles, which is a drop by about one order of magnitude compared to Dcentre. This suggests that the toluene-wall slip length is substantially positive on the hydroxylated wall and close to zero at the wall exposing the partially charged aluminium atoms.\nBetween the surface and the centre of the pore, the diffusion profiles D z\u00f0 \u00de monotonously increase (within the statistical accuracy of the extracted data). On the hydroxylated wall, the C60 and the C70 profile are basically indistinguishable, while at the aluminium exposed wall, C70 is clearly somewhat slower than C60.\nThe above described key features of the profiles can be captured by a so called Fax\u00e9n-Feitosa model that describes the change of the parallel diffusion coefficient of a colloidal sphere near a flat surface [77,78]. Accordingly,\nD z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Dbulk fk z\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f022\u00de\nwhere\nfk z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1 9 16 R z z0 \u00fe 1 8 R z z0 3 45 256 R z z0 4 1 16 R z z0\n5\" # :\nHereby, z0 is the position at which the no-slip condition is imposed, which is the slip length if the wall is at z \u00bc 0. Naturally, in the case of a vanishing slip length, z0 \u00bc 0.\nUsing the previously reported hydrodynamic radii and the bulk diffusion constants, eq. (22) can be applied to data with z0 as a single fitting parameter. For the hydroxylated side, the model agrees well with the data (full lines in Fig. 4b) and we find a slip length z0 \u00bc 0:26 0:02nm and 0.31 \u00b1 0.04nm for C60 and C70, respectively (column 4 in Table 2), which is comparable to the thickness of a layer of toluene. A small but positive slip length is indeed expected from the relation of the slip length to the contact angle [65] and measurements of the contact angle of toluene on the similar surface of anodized aluminum oxide that yield contact angles on the order of 60 to 70 [79].\nIn contrast, on the non\u2013hydroxylated side, the agreement of the model is worse. The obtained slip length is slightly negative (z0 \u00bc 0:18 0:01nm), with the error estimate reflecting only the uncertainty of the fitting procedure. While this result might be an artifact due to the model not reproducing the data particularly well, negative slip lengths were already obtained before in\nsystems with highly wettable surfaces [65,66,80]. Nonetheless, in these studies, the obtained (negative) slip lengths were also smaller but of comparable size as the solvent molecules. To further investigate the presence of a negative slip length, a set of different simulations can be conducted, advantageously taking into account the relation between the slip length and the contact angle [65]. However, these studies are kept for future work.\nDespite the discrepencay on the non\u2013hydroxylated side, the Fax\u00e9n-Feitosa model well captures the slow relaxation of the diffusion constant within the pore from the hydroxylated surface value to the bulk value. Interestingly however, inspection of Fig. 4b shows that the range at which the diffusivity is affected by the presence of each wall is very weakly dependent of the slip length at the wall. Further inspection of the diffusivity of the solvent shows that, actually, the effect of slow relaxation can be associated with the viscosity gradient in the toluene (see SI Section 5 and SIFig. 2 for details). As such this is directly a consequence of the lack of length scale separation in the system.\nIn order to further tell apart the effects of molecular interaction on the alteration of the viscosity from those of the boundary conditions, one could combine the present approach with different multiscale approaches like Langevin dynamics. As in such simulations, the variation of the viscosity can be explicitly taken into account or be ignored, different effects altering the diffusion coefficient can be told apart [81]. Nonetheless, a technique capable of retrieving the PMF is required to apply the four state model and to calculate the diffusion coefficients averaged over the whole pore as discussed in the following section."

These overestimates come due to the neglect of the decreasing diffusion coefficient between the surface state and the center of the pore, which is more prominent for the system where there is basically no slip on the surface.\nAn alternative approximation for D z\u00f0 \u00deh i, commonly used in separation technology, involves setting Dsrfc to zero. Accordingly, the nanoparticle can either be mobile in the center of the pore or adhered at the wall that inhibits all motion. The apparent transport coefficient Dapp is then given as the diffusivity of the particle in the bulk liquid reduced by the fraction of time spent on the surface\nDapp \u00bc pbulk Vbulk Dbulkpsurface V surface \u00fe pbulk Vbulk \u00bc Dbulk\nKSB Vsurface Vbulk\n\u00fe 1 : \u00f025\u00de\nOn the right hand side, Dapp is simply expressed through the Henry\u2019s coefficient. Naturally, this approximation is expected to work very well in thick pores, and where there is no-slip at the wall, i.e. when there is a proper separation of length scales in the system. However, in (slit) nanopores, the validity of this approximation is not guaranteed.\nIn the pore of intermediate thickness and partial slip, typical for nanoparticles, Dapp clearly underestimates the reference values D z\u00f0 \u00deh i (see column 2 and 4 in Table 3), while it overestimates the reference in cases with no slip on the surface. Actually, Dapp is significantly outperformed by Deff , particularly on hydroxylated pore, due to substantial slip."

            "text": "In the present work, we have addressed the problem calculating the average diffusion coefficient for transport of a nanoparticle along a pore. In particular, we focused on the regime when there is no clear length scale separation between the particle size and the range of the potential, while the pore is considered sufficiently large such that bulk liquid is recovered in the central part of the pore, at least from the structural point of view.\nWe engage in two strategies - calculating the full diffusion profile using advanced sampling techniques in molecular dynamics simulations. We complement these simulations with a simplified model where the interaction and the diffusivity is coarse-grained into 4 states for which the characteristic parameters are extracted from MDs. This strategy significantly reduces the computational effort compared to the reference, brute-force approach, yet provides a fully controlled approximation of the effective diffusion constant. This is the case as sampling the diffusion coefficient to the desired degree of accuracy required at least ten times the simulation time needed for converging the PMF. The use of Eq. (24) allows sampling the diffusion coefficient only in the center of the pore and at the wall, while in the intermediate positions only sampling the PMF. For the system in study, using Eq. (24) needs only about one third of the simulation time compared to evaluating the full diffusion profile with Eq. (23).\nAs part of the four state model, we recover the Henry\u2019s coefficient and are able to provide an estimate for the particle retention\ntime. Furthermore, it also allows us to account for the finite concentrations of nanoparticles. Despite its approximate nature, the model is still able to predict fine differences in the behaviour of similar nanoparticles, as exemplified on interactions and diffusivities of C60 and C70 fullerenes.\nNotably, the performance of the model depends on the friction properties of the pore surface, and not that much on the strength of the particle\u2013wall potential. Specifically, if there is significant slip of the nanoparticle on the pore wall, the model performs particularly well. If the diffusivity at the interface drops significantly, the diffusivity tends to be overestimated. In all situations, however, the model outperforms some commonly used approximations.\nThis approach demonstrates that relying on a limited computational effort it is possible to recover the dynamic behaviour of nanoparticles in confinement.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
