Exploration of Other Plant Extracts for Edible Film Fabrication: Investigate the incorporation of extracts from other plants with known antioxidant and antimicrobial properties into chitosan and sodium alginate-based films. This research could expand the range of natural additives available for enhancing the functional properties of edible films, potentially discovering extracts with even more potent effects on film characteristics.

Long-Term Biodegradability and Composting Studies: Conduct comprehensive studies on the biodegradability and compostability of these edible films under various environmental conditions. This would involve assessing the breakdown process of the films in different types of soil, temperatures, and humidity levels to evaluate their environmental impact fully.

Assessment of Edible Films in Real Food Packaging Applications: Perform field studies to test the effectiveness of these films in actual food packaging applications, focusing on perishable goods that require extended shelf life. This could include testing the films' performance in terms of moisture retention, antioxidant properties, and antimicrobial activities over time, comparing them to conventional packaging materials.

Enhancement of Mechanical Properties Through Nanotechnology: Explore the use of nanocomposites or nanoparticles to further enhance the mechanical and barrier properties of the chitosan and sodium alginate-based films. Incorporating nanomaterials could lead to significant improvements in tensile strength, flexibility, and water vapor permeability, making the films more suitable for a wider range of packaging applications.

Development of Active Packaging Systems: Investigate the development of active packaging systems by incorporating smart indicators into the films, such as pH indicators or freshness sensors. These could provide visual feedback on the quality of the food products or the presence of specific gases, enhancing food safety and reducing food waste.
