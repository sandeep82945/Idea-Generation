Detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with earlystage epithelial ovarian cancer is in an experimental phase.2 Standardization and description of the technique are the main objectives of this video article. It has been performed in the context of a clinical trial called MELISA (Mapping Sentinel Lymph Node in Initial Stages of Ovarian Cancer- NCT05184140).\nWe present a step- by- step video demonstration (Video\u00a01) of the technique performed at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. We divided the surgical procedure into the 10 following steps: (1) selection of the patient; (2) materials; (3) radiotracer injection; (4) adnexectomy; (5) frozen section; (6) ovarian lymphatic mapping with a portable gamma camera; (7) indocyanine green injection; (8) detection of a SLN with a fluorescence camera and gamma probe; (9) excision of SLN and performance of staging surgery; (10) ultrastaging of SLN.\nUnlike other gynecologic cancers, the choice of a particular tracer and the injection time remain the most controversial aspects since final diagnosis is usually done intra- operatively after the frozen section. As the 99mTc- albumin nanocolloid radiotracer remains trapped in the lymph nodes for a long period it can be injected before the adnexectomy.

The small size of indocyanine green molecules causes rapid lymphatic migration and makes it difficult to accurately identify the first node, especially after a few minutes. In order to identify the first lymphatic node in real time, a lymphatic mapping is checked with the portable gamma camera (Figure\u00a01).\nIn conclusion, the description of this new surgical procedure in 10 steps allows its standardization and distribution among surgical teams.\nCollaborators Investigators collaboration: Pere Fust\u00e9, N\u00faria Carreras, Tiermes Marina, Andrea Ritsch, Jordi Ribera, Xavi Cases, Adela Saco, Jaume Ordi.\nContributors NA: Accepts full responsibility for the work and/or the conduct of the study, had access to the data, and controlled the decision to publish.
