    "abstractText": "Multielectron semiconductor quantumdots (QDs) provide a novel platform to study the Coulomb interaction-driven, spatially localized electron states of Wigner molecules (WMs). Although Wigner-molecularization has been confirmed by real-space imaging and coherent spectroscopy, the open system dynamics of the strongly correlated states with the environment are not yet well understood. Here, we demonstrate efficient control of spin transfer between an artificial three-electronWMand the nuclear environment in aGaAs doubleQD. A Landau\u2013Zener sweep-based polarization sequence and low-lying anticrossings of spin multiplet states enabled by Wigner-molecularization are utilized. Combined with coherent control of spin states, we achieve control of magnitude, polarity, and site dependence of the nuclear field.Wedemonstrate that the same level of control cannot be achieved in the non-interacting regime. Thus, we confirm the spin structure of aWM, paving the way for active control of correlated electron states for application in mesoscopic environment engineering.",

Although Wigner-molecularization has been confirmed by real-space imaging and coherent spectroscopy, the open system dynamics of the strongly correlated states with the environment are not yet well understood. Here, we demonstrate efficient control of spin transfer between an artificial three-electronWMand the nuclear environment in aGaAs doubleQD. A Landau\u2013Zener sweep-based polarization sequence and low-lying anticrossings of spin multiplet states enabled by Wigner-molecularization are utilized. Combined with coherent control of spin states, we achieve control of magnitude, polarity, and site dependence of the nuclear field.Wedemonstrate that the same level of control cannot be achieved in the non-interacting regime. Thus, we confirm the spin structure of aWM, paving the way for active control of correlated electron states for application in mesoscopic environment engineering.\nSemiconductor quantum dot (QD) systems facilitate investigations of the interaction between electron spins and nuclear environments, which is known as the central-spin problem1,2. Although the fluctuation of nuclear fields, which is quantified by the effective Overhauser field Bnuc3,4, often acts as a magnetic-noise source for spin qubits3, the hyperfine electron\u2013nuclear spin interaction allows achieving dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)5\u20138. DNP is used for enhancing the signal-tonoise ratio in nuclear magnetic resonance6 and prolonging coherence times in QD-based spin qubits9,10. Gate-defined semiconductor QDs have been used to achieve the fast probing of nuclear environments8,11,12, bidirectional DNP11, and active feedback control of nuclear fields10.\nWhile the DNP achieved by spin-flip mediated transport with an applied bias13,14 allows large DNP13, the QD - reservoir tunnel rate needs to be large enough to allow the finite spin-flip current. On the contrary, the DNP based on the pulsed-gate technique can be demonstrated while maintaining the small tunnel rates ~101 kHz. Because the qubit\ncontrol typically requires small QD-reservoir tunnel rates transition from the pulsed-gate DNP to qubit experiments is straightforward without additional parameter modulation via the gate voltages. However, spin qubit control combined with DNP has been limited to twoelectron singlet\u2013triplet (ST0) spin qubits\n9\u201312,15. Despite the versatility of gate-defined QD systems16\u201319, the large singlet\u2013triplet energy splitting EST (~102 h\u00b7GHz; h is Planck\u2019s constant) in particular in GaAs limits the access to higher spin states20 in multielectron QDs at moderate external magnetic fields B0 < 1 T or within a typical frequency bandwidth of experimental setups.\nCoulomb-correlation-drivenWignermolecules (WMs) in confined systems21\u201325 may provide new directions for expanding nuclear control to multielectron systems. Recent studies on QDs in various systems have shown clear evidence of WM formation22,23,25\u201329. It has been demonstrated that the EST can reach down to ~100 h\u00b7GHz upon theWM formation27,29 because of strong electron\u2013electron interactions confirmed by full-configuration interaction (FCI)-based theories23,25,28,30.\nReceived: 3 August 2022\nAccepted: 10 May 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Institute of Applied Physics, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea. 2Department of Physics, Pusan National University, Busan 46241, Korea. 3Braun Center for Submicron Research, Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel. e-mail: dohunkim@snu.ac.kr\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2948 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nHowever, most studies have focused on the spectroscopic confirmation ofWM formation, and studies on the open systemdynamics using correlated states have not been reported to date.\nHere, we demonstrate the formation of a WM in semiconductor QDs, which helps achieving efficient spin environment control.We use gate-defined QDs in GaAs and exploit the quenched energy spectrum of the WM (EST ~ 0.9 h\u00b7GHz) to enable mixing between different spin subspaces within B0 < 0.3 T. Furthermore, we demonstrate DNP by pulsed-gate control of the electron spin states.

This potential can be tuned by the gate voltage, allowing the controlled electron correlation and localization of the ground state wavefunction within the DQD22,24,26,27. The yellow dot in Fig. 1a. denotes a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rf-SET) charge sensor utilized for quantum state readout31\u201333. The device was operated in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of ~40mK, an electron temperature Te ~ 150mK (Supplementary Note 1), and a variable B0 applied to the direction shown in Fig. 1a.\nThe three-electron DQD results in two spin doublets and one spin quadruplet state. Without the magnetic field in the (2,1) [(1,2)] charge configuration, doublet-singlet state DS(2,1) [DS(1,2)] with total spin S = 1/2 form the ground state where the two electrons in the left [right] QD forma spin singlet state and fill the ground orbital in the left [right] QD. Here, n [m] denotes the number of electrons in the left [right] QD by (n, m). When the two electrons in the left [right] QD form a spin triplet state and fill the excited orbital in the left [right] QD, the threeelectron state result in either the doublet-triplet state DT(2,1) [DT(1,2)] with S = 1/2 or the quadruplet stateQ(2,1) [Q(1,2)] with S = 3/2. Because of the orbital splitting, the DT, andQ states usually have higher energy compared to DS states34\u201336. If a finite magnetic field is applied, doublet states with S = 1/2 are split into ms = +1/2 and \u22121/2 states whereas quadruplet stateswith S = 3/2are split intoms = +3/2, +1/2,\u22121/2, and\u22123/ 2 states. Here ms is the spin quantum number related to the z component of the electron spin angular momentum. The explicit spin structures are shown in the Methods. Hereafter, (n, m;ms) notation is used to describe both the charge configuration and spin angular momentum of a state.\nFirst, we show the spectroscopic evidence of the WM at B0 = 0T by probing EST in the right QD \u03b4R. Figure 1b shows a charge stability diagram around (2,1) and (1,2). The green-shaded region near the (2,1)\u2013(1,1) charge transition is exploited for energy-selective tunneling (EST) readout and state initialization27,37,38. We tune the electron tunneling-in (-out) time \u03c4in (\u03c4out) of the left dot to 14 (7) \u03bcs. Starting from the initialized ground doublet state DS in the (2,1) charge configuration, we apply non-adiabatic pulses (Fig. 1b) simultaneously to V1 and V2 with a rise time of ~500ps and a repetition period of 51 \u03bcs\u226b \u03c4in to induce coherent LZS oscillation39,40. The oscillation reveals the relative phase evolution between the excited and ground doublet states (DT and DS), the frequency of which is governed by \u03b4R.\nFigure 1c shows the resultant LZS oscillations as a function of evolution time tevol and detuning \u03b5. The EST in GaAs DQDs in the noninteracting regime is typically on the order of 102 h.GHz20 (Fig. 1d). In a charge qubit regime, a steep rise in the LZS oscillation frequency fLZS ~ EQ/h as a function of \u03b5 (Fig. 1c, black curve) and short coherence time T2* ~ 10ps due to strong susceptibility to charge noise is expected41. EQ is the energy splitting between the two lowest levels (Fig. 1d, red-dashed curve). However, we find a significantly smaller fLZS in the (1,2) charge configuration and T2* ~ 10 ns because of the reduced dispersionof fLZS versus \u03b5. This is reminiscent of aQDhybridqubit27,40,42, but the excited energy is suppressed owing to the electron\u2013electron interaction. WM formation in our previous GaAs device has been recently confirmedby FCI calculation27,28,30. Although such calculation is needed to rigorously determine parameters, we roughly estimate \u03b4R ~ 0.9 h.GHz, by fitting the fast Fourier transformed (FFT) spectrum to the calculation result (Fig. 1c, red-dashed curve) derived from a toy-model Hamiltonian37,39,40 (see Supplementary Note 2).\nThe full energy spectrum calculation of the three-electron states using the parameters obtained experimentally across the (2,1)\u2013(1,2) configuration is illustrated in Fig. 1d (right panel). The suppressed EST of the left dot \u03b4L ~ 19 h\u00b7GHz is obtained by measuring the width of the EST region in the charge stability diagram with the lever arm of the gate V1 ~ 0.03. The left QD also allows a weakWigner molecularization as the measured \u03b4L is an order of magnitude smaller than the case of non-interacting regime. Because of the small value of \u03b4L/(kBTe) ~ 6,\nwhere kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, thermal tunneling precludes highfidelity single-shot readout. We obtain data by the time-averaged signal using the correlated-double sampling (CDS) method, which effectively yields the signal proportional to the excited state probability37 (see Supplementary Note 3). We confirm the WM spin structure via the strongly suppressed energy spectrum in the right QD with varying B0. We focus on five lowlying energy levels among eight possible multiplet states. See Methods for notations used for labeling spin multiplets. As shown in Fig. 2a (left panel), DS(1,2;\u22121/2) [DS(1,2;1/2)] becomes degenerate with DT(1,2;1/2) or Q(1,2;1/2) [Q(1,2;3/2)] at a certain \u03b5 depending on the B0magnitude. The degeneracies are lifted by the transverse Overhauser field B?nuc\n8,11. To detect such anticrossings, we first initialize the state to either DS(2,1;\u22121/ 2) orDS(2,1;1/2) at the ESTposition. By pulsing the initializedDS(2,1;\u22121/2) [DS(2,1;1/2)] towards (1,2) and holding for ~100ns\u226b T2*, mixing with (or leakage to) states Q(1,2;1/2) or DT(1,2;1/2) [Q(1,2;3/2)] can occur if the pulse amplitude Ap coincides with the anti-crossing position (Fig. 2a, right panel). Upon pulsing back to the (2,1) charge configuration, the resultant excited states Q or the DT probability can be detected via EST27,37,38. Figure 2b shows the leakage spectrum versus AP and B0, mapping out the anti-crossing positions similar to \u201cspin-funnel\u201d measurements in two-electron ST0 qubits reproducing the energy splittings between the ground and excited levels8,16,43,44. The black (red) dashed curves show the calculated splittings (Fig. 1d) between theDS andDT (Q) states at B0 =0T, with the Lande g-factor g* ~ \u22120.4 45,46.\nAlthough the calculated curve qualitatively agrees with the experimental curve, the observed spectrum curvature as a function of AP and B0 is smaller because of the DNP induced by the pulse sequence used for leakage spectroscopy. To confirm this, before each line scan of Ap in Fig. 2c, d, a similar step pulse with a fixed amplitude AP\u2032~370mV (450mV) is applied for 10 s. Consequently, we observe distortions (red circles) in the spectrum occurring at AP\u2032. This is because, when AP\u2032 matches with the anti-crossing position, the pulse probabilistically flips the electron spin with a change in the angular momentum \u0394mS = +1 by the leakage process described above and accompanies flop \u0394mN = \u22121 of the nuclear spin8,11. Unlike the electrons in GaAs, nuclei have positive gfactors8,20; therefore, the \u0394mS = +1 electron spin flip, and thereby the \u0394mN = \u22121 nuclear spin flip polarizes Bnuc toward the B0 direction8,11,47. This additionally drags the leakage spectrum opposite to the B0 direction under a specific condition Ap =AP\u2019. These results indicate that leakages induced by hyperfine interaction between the WM and nuclear environment lead to an observable change in Bnuc. Despite the long measurement time per line scan (~7 s) owing to the communication latency between the measurement computer and the instruments, the polarization effect is still visible. Thus, \u03c4N > 10 s, as discussed below. Moreover, as the anti-crossingposition is a sensitive functionofBtot =B0 + Bnuc over 100~300 mT, it can be used to measure Bnuc.\nWe now show bidirectional DNP combined with coherent control of doublet states at B0 = 230mT. Figure 3a (top panel) shows the three primary paths through the anticrossings, which can flip the electron spins deterministically by adiabatic passage2,8,11. Paths P1 and P3 describe the S-polarization that flips the electron spin with \u0394mS = +1. This is enabled by initializing the state toDS(1,2;\u22121/2) [DS(1,2;1/2)] at the EST position and then by non-adiabatically pulsing beyond the first anticrossings near the (2,1) charge configuration (Fig. 3a, yellow boxes), followed by adiabatically driving the state through the anticrossing to Q(1,2;1/2) [Q(1,2;3/2)], which accompanies \u0394mN = \u22121 (Fig. 3a, blue arrows). Because the spin state is initialized to the doublet-singlet state before the adiabatic spin-flip passage, the sequence is named S-polarization. The Q(1,2;1/2) [Q(1,2;3/2)] state is diabatically driven back to the EST position, and one electron quickly tunnels out to the reservoir. Reloading an electron from the reservoir reinitializes one of the Ds states completing the polarization cycle. Both the DS(1,2;\u22121/2) and DS(1,2;1/2) initial states contribute to the S-polarization. Path P2 denotes the T-polarization (\u0394mS = \u22121,\u0394mN = +1),\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2948 3\nwhich is possible by driving DT(1,2;1/2) adiabatically to DS(1,2;\u22121/2) (Fig. 3a, red arrow). To prepare DT(1,2;1/2), we apply a \u03c0-pulse to DS(2,1;1/2) before the adiabatic passage (Fig. 3a, bottom panel). Becausewe prepare the doublet-triplet state before the adiabatic spinflip passage, the sequence is called T-polarization. TheT-polarization is possible only when the state is initialized to DS(2,1;1/2) at the EST position. Combining the S- and T-polarizations, wemeasure the change in Bnuc (\u03b4Bnuc), where the repeated polarization pulse sequence (Fig. 3a, bottom panel) with variable tevol and a repetition rate of ~ 20 kHz is applied for 10 s before each line scan. For Fig. 3b, a waiting time ~10min was added after each sweep to allow the polarized nuclei to diffuse and minimize the polarization effect in the next sweep.

Upon the coincidenceof the pulse detuning and the anti-crossing, the state probabilistically evolves to Q(1,2;3/2) [Q(1,2;1/2)] and flips the electron spin \u0394mS = +1 which accompanies \u0394mN = \u22121.

This confirms that the net polarization rates can be controlled by adjusting tevol. Accordingly, we calibrate tevol = 0 (0.62 ns) for S (T)-polarization. We also calibrate the duration of the adiabatic spin transfer wR. Figure 3c shows the maximum nuclear field change Bmax reachable as a function ofwR, where both S- and Tpolarizations are ineffective for short wR because of negligible adiabatic transfer probability PLZ2,48. |Bmax| reaches a maximum around wR ~ 0.8 \u03bcs, after which the maximum efficiency is retained for the S-polarization sequence. In the case of T-polarization, however, for long wR, |Bmax| decreases because of DT relaxation during the adiabatic passage.\nBy tuning \u03b4R via the dc gate voltages and performing similar S-polarization experiments, we find that Bmax decreases with increasing \u03b4R (Fig. 3d, see Supplementary Note 4). As is discussed subsequently, we find that the nuclear diffusion time scale exceeds 60 s regardless of \u03b4R, but the Overhauser field change per electron flip b0 is strongly suppressed with increasing \u03b4R. Ultimately, the observation implies that the pulsed-gate-based nuclear control becomes inefficient in the non-interacting regime. We suspect the degree of electronic wavefunction localization which depends on the Wigner parameter may be affecting the contact hyperfine interaction between the electron and the nuclear spins and altering the DNP efficiency as a result.\nReturning to the condition \u03b4R ~ 0.9h\u00b7GHz, we demonstrate ondemand DNP. Figure 3e, f shows the result of optimized S (T)-polarization with tevol = 0 ns, wR = 1000ns (tevol = 0.62 ns, wR = 600 ns). Although the local fluctuations of the nuclear spins lead to random drift of the anti-crossing positions without the polarization pulse, Bnuc builds toward (opposite to) the B0 direction faster than the nuclear spin diffusion timescale when the polarization pulse is applied before each line scan. \u03b4Bnuc rises to Bmax 80 mT (\u221240 mT) until a dynamic equilibrium is reached. Because only the ms = 1/2 states contribute to the T-polarization, |Bmax| for the T-polarization is about half of that for the S-polarization, implying that the state initialize to both ms states with nearly equal probability at the EST position.\nWe also demonstrate bidirectional DNP by adjusting tevol in Fig. 3g. Figure 3h illustrates the control of Bnuc by adjusting the adiabatic sweep amplitude AR of the S-polarization sequence. Under the S-polarization, Bnuc builds in the B0 direction and drives the anti-crossing to deeper \u03b5 (more to (1,2) charge configuration). Because the pulse cannot have a finite polarization effect if the anti-crossing position is driven beyond \u03b5 reachable with AR, AR serves as the limiting factor of Bmax. Thus, a selflimiting DNP protocol, where the DNP field is limited by experimental parameters used in the pulse shape rather than the interplay between pumping rate and nuclear diffusion, can be realized. This self-limiting property can be useful in future DNP experiments as the steady state DNP field can be simply controlled by adjusting the pulse amplitude.\nC D S am p.

Bottom panel: pulse sequence used for S- and T-polarizations. For tevol = 0 ns, the sequence corresponds to maximumS-polarization, which bringsDS(1,2;1/2) [DS(1,2;\u22121/2)] adiabatically across the anti-crossing to Q(1,2;3/2) [Q(1,2;1/2)] flipping the electron spin with \u0394mS = +1 and leading to \u0394mN = \u22121 (blue arrow, S-polarization). For tevol = 600ns, the sequencecorresponds tomaximumT-polarization.Herein, theDT(1,2;1/2) prepared with a (Landau\u2013Zener\u2013St\u00fcckelberg) LZS-oscillation-induced\u03c0-pulse is adiabatically transferred to DS(1,2;1/2), resulting in \u0394mS = \u22121 and \u0394mN = +1 (red arrow, T-polarization), which has the opposite polarization effect compared to S-polarization. b Change in the nuclear field \u03b4Bnuc as a function of tevol.

The Bnuc saturates to Bmax when the polarization and the nuclear spin diffusion rate reach an equilibrium. For smallwR, the |Bmax| decreases because of the small Landau\u2013Zener transition probability PLZ for both S- (blue circle) andT-polarizations (red circle). In the case of T-polarization, |Bmax| decreases again for longwR owing to the lattice relaxation of the excited population.dBmax as a function of \u03b4R.

The red dotted line is the numerical fit derived from the simple rate equation-basedmodel. The fit yields the nuclear spin diffusion time \u03c4N ~ 62 s, with a polarization magnitude per spin flip of ~2.58h\u00b7kHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121. g On-demand DNP via tevol. h Adiabatic ramp amplitude AR with tevol = 0 ns realizing self-limiting DNP.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2948 5\nUsing a simple rate equation, we simulate the polarization-probe sequence (red-dashed curve in Fig. 3e, seeMethods and Supplementary Note 5) and obtain \u03c4\u039d \u223c 62 s and b0 ~ 2.58h\u00b7kHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121 from the fit. In contrast, theDNP effect is negligible in our devicewith the two-electron ST0 qubit\n8 under the same repetition rate as in the WM regime (see Supplementary Note 6). We further find our DNP is still effective when the repetition rate is as low as 5 kHz (see Supplementary Note 7) showing that the Wigner molecule allows sizable DNP that cannot be achieved with conventional QDs. Through optimization of the magnitude and direction of B0, b0 ~ 3 h kHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121 can be achieved with an ST0 qubit in GaAs\n2,8. However, the obtained result shows that robust nuclear control can be achievedwithWMs even in the regimewhere the same level of control cannot be achieved with an ST0 qubit. In addition, residual polarization ~21.5 mT exists after turning off the polarization sequence (Fig. 3e), which diffuses within ~30min. The large Knight shift gradient originating from the non-uniformly broadened WM wavefunction may be a possible cause of the long \u03c4\u039d. However, the newly observed phenomena in this study, including the dependence of b0 on the tuning condition, require further investigations47,49.\nFurthermore, the WM\u2019s coherent LZS dynamics provide a novel approach to measure the spatial Overhauser field gradient \u0394BZ between QDs. When \u0394BZ is larger than the exchange splitting between DT(1,2;1/2) [DT(1,2;\u20131/2)] andQ(1,2;1/2) [Q(1,2; \u2212 1/2)], the eigenstates are expected to become DT1(1,2;1/2) = \u2223 #i\u2223T + i [DT1(1,2; \u2212 1/2) = \u2223 \"i\u2223T i] and DT0(1,2;1/2) = \u2223 \"i\u2223T0i [DT0(1,2; \u2212 1/2) = \u2223 #i\u2223T0i]35. Because both states can tunnel-couple toDS(1,2;1/2) [DS(1,2;\u22121/2)], the LZS oscillation reveals the DT1 \u2013 DS and DT0 \u2013 DS energy splittings. As can be inferred from the Hamiltonian (see Supplementary Note 8), although the DT0 \u2013 DS splitting is independent of the \u0394\u0392Z and BZ, the DT1 \u2013 DS splitting is modulated by \u0394\u0392Z depending on the sign of \u0394\u0392Z andms, providing the directmeasure of\u0394\u0392Z. Because the states can initialize to bothDS(1,2;1/ 2) and DS(1,2;\u22121/2) at the EST position, the LZS oscillation captures the dynamics of both ms = 1/2 and ms = \u22121/2 subspaces.\nFigure 4a (4b) illustrates the LZS oscillation measurement of the WMmultiplet states at B0 = 230mT in the time (frequency) domain with the S-polarization turnedon andoff at specific laboratory times. The FFT spectrum exhibits three different branches corresponding to the DT0 \u2013 DS (red arrow) and DT1 \u2013 DS (black and black-dashed arrows) where the beating patterns vary as the S-polarization induces changes in \u0394Bz. Two differentDT1 \u2013DS branches correspond to differentms subspaces, where the sign of \u0394Bz should be known to distinguish thems for each branch. TheDT0 \u2013DS splitting is the same for bothms subspaces and is displayed as a single branch (red arrow). Figure 4c, d shows the simulated time (frequency) domain signal of the same LZS oscillation, which agrees well with the experimental result (see Supplementary Note 9). As expected, theDT0 \u2013DS splitting is constant regardless of \u0394Bz, whereas theDT1 \u2013DS splitting is modulated along the polarization sequence.\nThe DT0 \u2013 DT1 splitting without the polarization sequence implies the built-in \u0394Bz ~ 200 h\u00b7MHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121 (35 mT), which is also confirmed by the ST0 oscillation (see Supplementary Note 6). \u0394Bz increases to 400 h\u00b7MHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121 (70 mT) with the S-polarization and decreases to 200hMHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121 after turning the polarization off. Thus, we conclude that the S-polarization yields the asymmetric pumping effect (\u0394Bnuc ~ 200hMHz\u00b7(g*\u03bcB)\u22121) about the QD sites, whereas the \u0394Bnuc direction can be experimentally checked, for example, via single-spin electric-dipole spin resonances46. Furthermore, the DT0 \u2013 DS splitting comprises the decoherence-free subspace for the qubit operations resilient to magnetic noises, where the coherent microwave control combined with the large polarization may enable leakage-free and state-selective transitions."

With the energy splitting of\nthe WM ~ 0.9 h\u00b7GHz, we confirm the controllable DNP of Bnuc (\u0394Bnuc) reaching (but not limited to) 80 mT (35 mT) via leakage spectroscopy and LZS oscillations. The \u03c4N exceeds 60 s, which, together with bidirectional polarizability, is beneficial for stabilizing the nuclear bath fluctuation and realizing long-lived nuclear polarization10,15.\nWe anticipate several directions for further developments and applications of WM-enabled DNP. Similar experiments with a larger \u03b4L/Te ratio can enable high-fidelity single-shot readout for a faster measurement of the dynamics of nuclear polarization. This would further enable feedback loop control10 and tracking12,50,51 of nuclear environments in multielectron QDs which can be utilized to narrow the nuclear field distribution for electron coherence enhancement. The real-time Hamiltonian estimation also improves frequency resolution for measuring instantaneous \u0394Bnuc, which may enable measurements of the degree of spatial localization within WMs. We expect more asymmetric QD geometry would allow a smaller energy gap and thereby the broader electronic wavefunction. Along with the tunability of the energy gap via the gate voltage, as shown here, this may facilitate the investigation of the spatial noise characteristics within a single QD which has been impractical with the typical QD geometries. Furthermore, DNP becomes inefficient with increasing EST of the WM, as discovered herein. This implies that the pulsed-gated electron\u2013nuclear flip-flop probability is a strong function of the Wigner parameter, the microscopic origin of which requires more rigorous investigations."
