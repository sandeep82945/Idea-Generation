            "text": "20 Since the introduction of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) in 2018, Malawi has achieved 21 national coverage of trained providers in the public sector and steady increases in uptake of DMPA-SC. 22 However, the rate of clients opting to self-inject DMPA-SC has remained lower than early acceptability 23 studies suggested. Providers play an instrumental role in building client confidence to self-inject through 24 counselling. This cross-sectional qualitative study explored the perspectives of providers and injectable 25 clients on the integration of self-injection into contraceptive counselling, to identify best practices and 26 gaps. The study was conducted at public sector sites in three districts (Nkhotakota, Mzimba South, 27 Zomba) in Malawi. In-depth interviews were conducted with provider-administered injectable clients, 28 self-injecting clients, and DMPA-SC trained providers. All providers interviewed reported successfully 29 integrating self-injection into their approach. During health education sessions, providers tended to 30 focus mainly on benefits of self-injection to spark interest in the method, and then follow that up with 31 more in-depth information in individual counselling. Due to time pressures, a minority of providers 32 reported replacing individual counselling with small-group counselling and limited their use of peer 33 testimonials, visualizations, and demonstrations. Most providers skipped client practice on inanimate 34 objects, feeling this was either not necessary or not appropriate given stock or resource constraints. 35 Current self-injecting clients showed the best recall for self-injection steps and tended to report having 36 received comprehensive, supportive counselling including aspects such as peer testimonials, 37 visualizations, and demonstrations to build confidence. Injectable clients who had declined self-injection 38 tended to demonstrate less detailed recall of key self-injection messages and report receiving 39 incomplete information, and lack of peer testimonials, visualization, or demonstrations. Comprehensive 40 counselling and training from supportive providers, including best practices identified in this study, are\n3 41 vital to improving client confidence to self-inject. Providers should be supported to overcome time- and 42 resource-pressures to invest in these best practices."

            "text": "44 Injectable contraceptives are the most popular method used in Malawi \u2013 making up almost half (49.8%) 45 of the contraceptive method mix. [1] A new subcutaneous formulation (DMPA-SC) of the popular 46 injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular (DMPA-IM) was introduced in Malawi in 47 2018. DMPA-SC is safe, highly effective at preventing pregnancy, and administered every three months. 48 DMPA-SC differs from DMPA-IM in that it comes in a pre-filled, \u2018all-in-one\u2019 Uniject syringe, it is injected 49 subcutaneously, and contains a lower dose of DMPA. The Uniject syringe means DMPA-SC can be 50 administered by any trained person, including community health workers, pharmacists and 51 contraceptive clients themselves, where it is registered for use by these groups. 52 Research on DMPA-SC in Malawi has shown high acceptability rates for DMPA-SC being administered \u2018at 53 home\u2019 as opposed to in a clinic by a provider (70% among injectable users); high rates of willingness to 54 continue to self-inject (SI) among trained clients (98%); and high rates of willingness to SI in the future 55 among provider-administered (PA) injectable clients (78%). [2] The SI option has also been found to be 56 associated with increased continuation of contraceptive use among injectable clients (73% SI clients 57 continuing at 12 months compared to 45% PA clients). [3] Qualitative studies in Malawi have 58 demonstrated preference for DMPA-SC over DMPA-IM among both providers and clients, due to the 59 ease of administration and the time- and travel-savings associated with SI versus PA. [4] Based on these 60 positive results, the Ministry of Health (MOH) approved the national roll-out of DMPA-SC (both PA and 61 SI) in 2018. By 2021, all public sector facilities nationally had at least one DMPA-SC trained provider.\n4 62 Since the national scale up, analysis of Health Management Information System (HMIS) data shows that 63 uptake of DMPA-SC has steadily increased. However, the rate of new injectable users choosing the SI 64 option has remained lower than rates indicated by early acceptability studies. [2, 5] For example, in Q4 65 2020 only 12% of DMPA new injectable users took up the SI option (versus 38% and 50% taking up 66 DMPA-SC PA and DMPA-IM respectively). SI accounted for just a quarter (25%) of DMPA-SC uptake in Q4 67 2020, and continued to average around 21% in subsequent quarters. [5] 68 During supervision visits to facilities across Malawi in 2020-2021, the MOH observed occasional provider 69 bias against SI, with some providers reporting it took too long to train women to SI. Qualitative evidence 70 from Malawi shows training women on SI may take longer than PA options, due to the addition of the SI 71 demonstration, client training and practice sessions on top of the standard method-specific counselling 72 on advantages and side effects. According to SI clients in one study in Malawi, SI counselling and training 73 took approximately 20 minutes, while providers reported 27 minutes on average (10-60 minutes range). 74 [4] Exactly how the SI option is introduced by providers can also influence client confidence to take up 75 this option \u2013 for example, a recent study found that standardizing messaging on SI (including specific 76 reassurances about the common SI concerns) was associated with higher SI uptake. [6] A recent study in 77 Uganda also found that training quality may affect adolescents\u2019 confidence to SI independently, [7] 78 while mixed-methods research conducted by the Delivering Innovation through Self-Care (DISC) 79 program in Nigeria and Uganda has identified that providers can \u2018gatekeep\u2019 the SI option (i.e. introduce 80 barriers to information and support to SI for some women) based on their own biases or lack of 81 confidence with the product. [8] This study was designed to investigate barriers and enablers of self82 injection uptake more broadly, with a specific objective to investigate best practices and potential gaps 83 in providers\u2019 approaches to integrating the SI option into their contraceptive counselling for new and 84 returning injectable users in Malawi.\n5"

            "text": "86 MOH Malawi and Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) collaborated in 2021 to conduct a cross87 sectional qualitative study investigating the barriers and enablers to DMPA-SC SI uptake in Malawi, 88 including a specific emphasis on understanding the contraceptive counselling interaction between 89 providers and clients, from both perspectives. Specific outcomes of interest included: provider 90 perspectives on enablers and barriers of integrating DMPA-SC intro their contraceptive counselling 91 approach; client perspectives on the information received about DMPA-SC from providers; client 92 perspectives on the quality of training and support provided during self-injection training; provider and 93 client perspectives on the length of time counselling on DMPA-SC takes. The results of a secondary 94 research question on perspectives of adolescents with unmet need for contraception on DMPA-SC SI are 95 published elsewhere. [9] 96 Study sites were six randomly-sampled public sector facilities in three districts (Nkhotakota, Mzimba 97 South, Zomba) \u2013 one district from each of Malawi\u2019s three regions. Districts and facilities were sampled 98 randomly to minimize selection bias, however only public facilities that provided 10 or more DMPA-SC 99 services per month were included in the sampling frame, to ensure enough injectable clients could be 100 sampled. At each site, providers and injectable clients were purposively sampled according to inclusion 101 criteria (for providers, this meant having been trained in DMPA-SC; for clients, this meant having used 102 either a self-injected or provider administered injectable contraceptive in the last nine months). 103 Data was collected using semi-structured in-depth interview guides. Several participatory activities were 104 integrated to elicit detail about the provider-client counselling interaction. Firstly, providers were asked 105 to role-play contraceptive counselling and SI training with the data collectors acting as \u2018clients\u2019. 106 Providers were reassured that this exercise was purely to understand variations in approaches between\n6 107 providers, and that their responses would be anonymized, to try and minimize possible Hawthorne 108 effect. Secondly, recognizing that some clients may not always critically appraise the quality of their care 109 when they are unaware of the standards expected, [10] injectable clients were shown one of two videos 110 to establish a standard against which they could assess the quality of the counselling and SI training 111 received: 112 1. Video 1 showed two actors demonstrating a best practice counselling and SI training session 113 between provider and client (S1 contains the script for the video). This video was created for the 114 study and approved by the MOH for use for study purposes. It was shown to PA injectable clients 115 who had chosen not to take up the SI option to help them critically compare to their own 116 experience of counselling. 117 2. Video 2 was developed by PATH International [11] and explains the critical SI information that a 118 self-injecting client needs to know. This animated video was shown to current/recent SI clients 119 to help them identify any gaps in their knowledge. 120 As Nkhotakota and Zomba are predominantly Chichewa-speaking districts, while Mzimba South is 121 predominantly Tumbuka-speaking, all study tools and videos were translated or dubbed into both 122 languages for study purposes. 123 The final sample size was based on theoretical saturation, which refers to the point at which no new 124 ideas emerge from a sample diverse in relevant characteristics and experiences. [12] Clear variation in 125 themes emerging from the two DMPA client populations (PA and SI) during early data collection led to 126 the decision to slightly expand sample sizes in those two groups to ensure saturation could be reached. 127 The final sample of 24 providers included 18 HSAs and 6 facility-based providers, most of whom received 128 their DMPA-SC training a year or more ago. The final sample of 40 clients included 15 clients who had\n7 129 self-injected in the last nine months and 25 clients who had received a provider-administered injectable 130 (DMPA-IM or DMPA-SC) in the last nine months. Most clients were aged between 20 and 39 years, were 131 married and had 1-2 children. Full details of the provider and client sample characteristics are outlined 132 in Table 1.\n8 133 Table 1.

No identifying information about participants was collected 135 other than broad descriptors relating to basic demographics or cadre. Quantitative descriptors were 136 collected on paper by the study team and manually entered into Excel for descriptive analysis (Table 1). 137 Qualitative data was collected by trained research assistants, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and 138 translated into English for analysis. Data was coded deductively by three qualitative researchers using 139 Dedoose software, then code reports (S2) exported from Dedoose for thematic analysis. For some 140 themes (for example, the counselling messages covered during provider role-plays), a \u2018framework 141 approach\u2019 was used, charting the coded data into a matrix to allow comparability across in-depth 142 interviews and against national in-service training content (provided by MOH). Where relevant, sub143 group analyses were conducted by splitting code reports up between provider-administered and self144 injection client groups or between HSAs and facility-based provider groups, to note any variation in 145 themes or opinions between the sub-groups. 146 All participants were asked to provide voluntary written informed consent to participate in this study 147 prior to interview. Ethical approval to conduct this research was granted by the National Health Science 148 Research Committee (NHSRC) \u2013 an independent international review board in Malawi with Federal-Wide 149 Assurance (IRB00003905, FWA00005976). 150 Results 151 Integrating self-injection into health education\n10\n152 All providers claimed to have integrated DMPA-SC and the SI option into their health education run153 through of all the contraceptive methods (which they conducted as either a group session during a 154 structured clinic or, for some HSAs, one-to-one with individual clients during home-based visits). Most 155 providers said they still mentioned DMPA-SC and the SI option at this stage, even if they did not 156 currently have DMPA-SC in stock (Malawi experienced national shortages of DMPA-SC in 2020-2021 due 157 to global disruption of supply).\n158 Some providers mentioned incorporating testimony from satisfied SI clients at this stage, to 159 demonstrate to other women that it was possible for women like them to SI. Many providers reported 160 emphasizing the benefits of SI at this stage; particularly that SI could reduce visits to facilities, which 161 they felt would be the most appealing feature to women. One provider explained that this was to pique 162 client interest in DMPA-SC, knowing that the details of the method would be covered later in individual 163 counselling:\n164 \u201c[In health education sessions]\u2026 we cannot focus on the bad side because she will not 165 choose the method, but we should explain to her the advantages of the method. Then 166 she understood [sic] and makes her choice. And then we train her on this method 167 [later].\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n168 Echoing this, most PA injectable clients mentioned having first heard some high-level messages on SI 169 during either a health education session and/or sometimes through other women. For these clients, 170 their level of recall was also typically limited to only the benefits of SI:\n171 \u201cYes, they [providers] told us that the injection is good, the self-injection. 172 [Interviewer: Alright, did they say anything about the side effects of this injection? \u2026 ]\n11\n173 No, they did not say anything on that, they just explained about the benefits\u2026\u201d \u2013 174 married PA client, 30-39 years, Zomba\n175 A small group of PA injectable clients reported little or no awareness of even the high-level messages 176 about SI. These were mainly long-term DMPA-IM users who reported that they tended to skip or not pay 177 attention during health education sessions at their re-injection visits, citing satisfaction with DMPA-IM 178 and lack of motivation to switch methods:\n179 \u201cI can\u2019t explain [about DMPA-SC] because I did not pay attention [during health 180 education] \u2026 [Interviewer: Why didn\u2019t you pay attention?] It\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to 181 be convinced with a new method\u2026 I did not pay attention [be]cause the one 182 [contraceptive method] I am using works well on me, so I don\u2019t want to hear other 183 methods.\u201d \u2013 married PA client, 30-39 years, Mzimba South\n184 Integrating self-injection into individual method-specific counselling 185 If clients expressed interest in DMPA-SC after health education, providers then reported offering them 186 in-depth individual counselling where they asked questions about contraceptive history, side effects and 187 checked for contraindications. Most providers stressed the importance of having the one-to-one space 188 with clients to tailor counselling to their needs. However, a handful of providers reported grouping 189 women who expressed interest in a particular method to avoid repeating themselves and to save time \u2013 190 this practice included but did not seem to be exclusive to counselling on DMPA-SC. During stockouts of 191 DMPA-SC, providers ranged in their approach at this stage: from encouraging women to temporarily use 192 other methods, to still proceeding with DMPA-SC counselling/training but limiting clients\u2019 opportunities 193 to practice and/or their number of take-home doses, depending on stock availability.\n12\n194 During counselling role-plays, most providers demonstrated comprehensive counselling on DMPA-SC 195 messages that aligned with national in-service training content, including proactively advising on safe 196 storage and disposal of the Unijects. Most providers were able to explain the benefits (pregnancy 197 prevention, reduced visits to facilities, discretion, etc.) and potential side effects (e.g. menstrual 198 changes, weight change, headaches, etc.) of DMPA-SC, relative to other methods.\n199 However, some key messages from the national in-service training content that providers often missed 200 during role-plays included advice on what women should do:\n201  if they missed their re-injection window\n202  if they experienced any irritation or dimpling at the injection site\n203  to return unused units if they decided not to use them\n204 In role-plays with the data collectors, providers shared their techniques for familiarizing the concept of 205 SI, for example making comparisons between DMPA-SC and other needle-based concepts women were 206 familiar with \u2013 usually DMPA-IM, but also sometimes things like vaccines, malaria test kits, or insulin 207 injections:\n208 \u201c\u2026we also tell them that the needle is small comparing with Depo Provera [DMPA209 IM]. When you show the\u2026 the two needles, they say this is long and this small and 210 easy just like malaria test kit. When we counsel her, they understand although they 211 might still be afraid.\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n212 During role plays, most providers showed good recall of the critical steps of SI from national in-service 213 training content. The critical steps most commonly mentioned by providers during the role plays 214 included:\n13\n215  the importance of shaking and activating the Uniject\n216  pinching the skin at the injection site\n217  injecting at a downward angle\n218  not rubbing the injection site after injecting\n219  disposing of the product safely in a closed container and returning it to a heath official\n220 A few of the self-injection steps that were less commonly recalled by providers included:\n221  Handwashing before self-injecting\n222  Checking expiration dates before self-injecting\n223  Removing the needle cap and not replacing it\n224  Pressing the reservoir for 5-7 seconds\n225  The specific sequencing of removing the needle and releasing the \u2018pinched\u2019 skin\n226  Calculating and noting down the date for the next injection\n227 From the client side, there were striking differences between the level of recall of critical SI steps 228 between PA and SI clients. Most PA clients recalled only high-level information (typically only shaking 229 and activating the Uniject and pinching the skin before injecting on the thigh or stomach). By contrast, 230 current/recent SI clients showed the most detailed spontaneous recall for most of the critical SI steps, 231 typically able to walk through most or all the steps from memory:\n232 \u201cThis is how we hold Sayana [showing the interviewer using hands] then we shake it, 233 after shaking it we press its neck and then the needle is pushed inside then we hold 234 the place where we want to inject ourselves and then we inject the needle. The\n14\n235 moment we realize that the needle is inside the skin then we press the medicine until 236 all is finished then we start pulling out the needle little by little.\u201d \u2013 divorced/widowed 237 SI client, 20-29 years, Nkhotakota\n238 Some PA injectable clients were positive about the quality of counselling they received, even after 239 comparing it to the best practice counselling/training session video (S1). However, several others felt 240 their own experience of counselling/training was less detailed than the session in the video:\n241 \u201c[Interviewer: Ah why have you not tried it [self-injection]?] because I was not trained 242 properly, I did not receive the proper training \u2026 but they also did not explain that this 243 is how you perform self-injection very well \u2026they also did not talk about the 244 consequences [side effects]\u201d \u2013 PA client, missing age and marital status, Zomba\n245 For example, some PA clients picked up on topics covered in the best practice video that had been 246 missing from their counselling, namely exactly how and where to self-inject, or noted that they had not 247 received a visual aid/calendar that might have helped them remember the steps:\n248 \u201cThe provider said we have three places where we can self-inject but, in the video, 249 they have said we have only two places where we can self-inject.\u201d \u2013 married PA 250 client, 30-39 years, Mzimba South\n251 \u201c\u2026we were not given the calendar\u2026 it was a verbal calendar explaining that after 90 252 days you should do it\u2026. But here [in the video] there is a calendar [with the job aid 253 showing the SI steps] from washing hands to self-injecting.\u201d \u2013 married PA client, 40- 254 49 years, Zomba,\n15\n255 By comparison, SI clients were more likely to say they had received complete information in their 256 counselling, and therefore knew most or all the key information covered in the PATH video: [11]\n257 \u201c\u2026 everything that we were trained [on] is in the video\u2026 After I watched the video 258 and the training that I received from the providers\u2026 I can see that [I] am able to do 259 everything in order and there is no problem and the providers trained us well\u201d \u2013 260 married SI client, 30-39 years, Zomba\n261 Only a few SI clients reflected that the topic of possible side effects of DMPA-SC had been covered in 262 more depth in the video than in their original counselling:\n263 \u201cThe training I received from my provider is different [from the video] because [in the 264 video] they have said that some get fat, some menstruate, some [have] stomach ache 265 and some headache. They did not explain this.\u201d \u2013 married SI client, 20-29 years, 266 Nkhotakota\n267 All SI clients reported feeling reassured enough in their counselling to proceed to being trained in SI. By 268 contrast, only a few PA clients reported that they had decided to proceed with training in SI after 269 receiving counselling \u2013 the majority reported that they still had too many concerns about pain or doubt 270 in their own ability to SI to even with training.\n271 Conducting self-injection training 272 After counselling on DMPA-SC, answering client questions, and establishing no contraindications, 273 providers reported offering women the opportunity to be trained on SI. Several providers commented 274 that, if they had spent enough time addressing concerns during counselling, most clients would choose 275 to be trained in SI, while only a few women would request PA instead:\n16\n276 \u201c\u2026if you do the counselling very well, they do not have any concerns as long as they 277 have understood every procedure on how they can self-inject and also know the next 278 date to self-inject in doing so they will not forget.\u201d \u2013 Facility-based provider, Mzimba 279 South\n280 To kick off SI training, most providers reported first conducting some sort of visual demonstration of the 281 Uniject and SI steps. This typically involved using a visual aid (e.g. posters, job aids or the visuals on the 282 back of SI calendars) and/or gestures and demonstrations with a real Uniject \u2013 where DMPA-SC stock 283 availability allowed. Many providers emphasized the importance of women being able to visualize the SI 284 steps to reassure them of the simplicity of it:\n285 \u201c\u2026most people easily understand when they are able to see the things that they are 286 being trained in, how it is operating\u2026\u201d \u2013 HSA, Zomba\n287 Providers were generally very positive about the DMPA-SC SI calendars used in Malawi (which include a 288 visual reminder of the SI steps on the back), which they felt served multiple purposes \u2013 acting as a visual 289 aid during training, serving as a reminder of the SI steps for women at home, and helping women keep 290 track of their re-injection dates:\n291 \u201cLike calendars they are so helpful\u2026 It contains details on the steps on how self292 injection should be done and also it has some pictures that help the clients to see the 293 process. We also use the pictures when counselling clients \u2026 It helps especially when 294 they are alone, they are able to refer to the instruction sheet.\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n295 After the visual demonstration, most providers then encouraged clients to practice with a Uniject. While 296 national guidelines suggest women should practice first on inanimate objects, such as a condom filled 297 with sugar, only a few providers talked about doing this in practice (and, if they did, they typically used\n17\n298 cheaper materials than sugar, such as condoms filled with sand, or oranges or tomatoes). Most 299 providers in this study instead reported encouraging women to \u2018practice\u2019 SI directly for the first time on 300 their thighs or stomachs, under supervision. This deviation from recommended protocol was said to be 301 due to concerns about \u2018wasting\u2019 scarce DMPA-SC stock; provider time constraints; concerns about the 302 cost of sugar; or because providers felt women were not \u2018convinced\u2019 by practicing on inanimate 303 materials:\n304 \u201c\u2026most of the times the women are reluctant that this [condom filled with sugar] is 305 not a real thing, and they want a demonstration on the actual body\u2026 so we don\u2019t rely 306 on it too much\u2026\u201d \u2013 Facility-based provider, Zomba\n307 Providers often noted that practice was the most challenging part of SI training, requiring repeated 308 feedback to ensure women did it correctly. Some providers seemed to treat this step as something of an 309 \u2018exam\u2019 for women, using the terms \u2018pass\u2019 and \u2018fail\u2019 to denote if they were happy or unhappy with the 310 woman\u2019s attempt:\n311 \u201c\u2026we compare \u2026 how they are injecting themselves and see where they are doing 312 wrong, and we help them to improve on that. And the ones who have passed 313 [successfully self-injected], we congratulate them and tell them to continue at home. 314 But for the ones who have failed, we tell them.\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n315 A few providers talked about revisiting demonstrations and training on SI over time (e.g. over the course 316 of several PA re-injection visits) to build the confidence of women who had previously \u2018failed\u2019 practice 317 sessions.\n318 From the client perspective, SI clients were slightly more likely than their PA counterparts to mention 319 having seen a visual demonstration of SI steps during SI training, while some said they had seen another\n18\n320 woman self-inject before being encouraged to \u2018practice\u2019 on themselves. By contrast to SI clients, very 321 few PA clients mentioned seeing a visual demonstration of any kind, nor seeing other women self-inject 322 first before being asked to \u2018practice\u2019 on themselves. Very few clients in either the SI or PA group 323 mentioned having practiced on inanimate objects \u2013 most said that their first \u2018practice\u2019 had been on their 324 own thighs under provider observation:\n325 \u201cWe were taught how to inject ourselves; we were asked if [we] would manage and I 326 agreed and attempted to inject myself while the HSA was watching, she confirmed 327 that I had done it well and could manage to do it on my own.\u201d \u2013 married SI client, 40- 328 49 years, Zomba\n329 \u201c[Interviewer: Did they give you a chance to practice] Yes, they did [Interviewer: Did 330 you self-inject? What did you use to practice?] They gave us a chance like me I 331 practiced on my body\u201d \u2013 married PA client, under 20, Mzimba South\n332 In general, SI clients reflected positively on their counselling/training and credited this with helping 333 them overcome initial fears:\n334 \u201cI had fears at first. But the fears went off because we were self-injecting under direct 335 observation by the provider, they were instructing us on how to do it [Interviewer: 336 What did you [do to] deal with the fears apart from providers being there for you?] 337 It\u2019s because of the counselling they gave us. When we started the procedure, 338 everything was going as they had taught us, so this relieved us our fears.\u201d \u2013 married 339 SI client, 20-29 years, Mzimba South\n340 Some SI clients described how providers helped them overcome their fears and build their confidence 341 over repeated visits, if they had initially been too afraid to try SI:\n19\n342 \u201cLike for me I asked them to inject me because I was not confident. But I was told it 343 [DMPA-SC] was meant for self-injection. During the second visit, they counselled us 344 again and this time I understood and managed to self-inject\u201d \u2013 married SI client, 30- 345 39 years, Mzimba South\n346 When asked why they had not taken up SI after training, the few PA clients who had received some SI 347 training tended to blame themselves rather than the quality of their counselling/training. For example, 348 they were more likely to talk about struggling to overcome initial fears; lacking confidence in their own 349 ability; or mirroring the providers\u2019 language about having \u2018failed\u2019 their practice:\n350 \u201cI wanted to find out if I will be able to self-inject. If I will do it, I will be using that 351 one. But I failed. [Interviewer: You failed?... How exactly did you fail?] I failed to open 352 [activate]. They say that for it to be opened [activated], it has to make a sound and I 353 failed to do that. I was like \u2018I will end up destroying this thing\u2019.\u201d \u2013 married PA client, 354 30-39 years, Nkhotakota\n355 A few PA clients also reported feeling pressure or judgment when being encouraged to take up SI:\n356 \u201c[Interviewer: What was the nurse saying?] \u2026[she] was saying, \u2018Why do you still 357 want us to inject you? Why are you not getting the self-injecting one?... Why are you 358 not injecting yourself?\u2019 \u2026 [Interviewer: So what did you say?] I said I have never taken 359 the self-injecting type before.\u201d \u2013 married PA client, 20-29 years, Nkhotakota\n360 Length and feasibility of comprehensive counselling and training 361 Most providers in this study reported that it takes between 15-20 minutes to counsel and train a woman 362 on DMPA-SC SI. A few others said it could take more than 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes with some 363 clients. Finding this additional time during busy days was not always easy for providers:\n20\n364 \u201cTo explain to the client [about DMPA-SC SI], you need to have uninterrupted time 365 and also sometimes nurses are busy \u2026 you need to sit down and start explain[ing] all 366 the procedures up until you are convinced that she can do it. So it\u2019s not that difficult 367 but you just need time to do it\u201d \u2013 Facility-based provider, Mzimba South\n368 A few providers mentioned other factors that could influence the length of counselling/training. For 369 example, many providers felt that training a client who had previously used an injectable would be 370 quicker, as she had existing knowledge to draw on, while women with less knowledge of contraception 371 may be more difficult to counsel and train, as they would have more questions to address:\n372 \u201cHaving previous experience [with injectables] does help, for instance, during 373 counselling if we have clients who started the method some time [ago]\u2026 you will hear 374 them commenting that they know the stuff \u2026 So \u2026 this makes the work simple 375 because you know the counselling process will be easy and does not take a lot of 376 time. Whilst if you have new clients it takes long to counsel them\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n377 Providers generally did not mention educational status of the client influencing counselling time, but 378 they did mention age. Most providers felt that adolescents (under 20) required more time to counsel, 379 not necessarily because of difference in understanding but just because they were more likely to be 380 starting from a low baseline of information about contraception:\n381 \u201cCompared to an older woman, because older women already know the things, and 382 maybe they have already heard the things from somebody else, but mostly the 383 adolescents don\u2019t know most of the information relating to family planning\u2026\u201d \u2013 HSA, 384 Zomba\n21\n385 However, a few providers said that it was actually quicker to counsel adolescents because they would 386 pick up new ideas quickly:\n387 \u201cThe understanding of adults is a bit complex\u2026 Hence it becomes difficult for them to 388 grasp the information easily as such you have to say it again and again. It\u2019s different 389 from adolescents when you train them, they capture the info easily\u2026\u201d \u2013 Facility-based 390 provider, Nkhotakota\n391 A few providers said adolescents\u2019 anxiety about being seen at the facility was a factor in them wanting 392 to avoid group health education sessions or ask for faster counselling:\n393 \u201cMost youth mostly don\u2019t have time. It happens that sometimes the time we\u2019re giving 394 the talk, they\u2019re rushing to do their own things and they sometimes try to avoid 395 people \u2026 they think \u201cIf so and so sees me they will report them to their homes.\u201d \u2013 396 Facility-based provider, Zomba\n397 Several providers described their role in counselling on SI becoming quicker and easier over time, as 398 their own experience increased and awareness and acceptance of DMPA-SC at community-level grew:\n399 \u201c\u2026initially I think for the first three months \u2026 we would spend almost 45 minutes\u2026 40 400 to 45 minutes\u2026 but after the first three months we spend 15 minutes\u201d \u2013 Facility401 based provider, Zomba\n402 Despite the time pressures, most providers took their responsibility for training women in SI very 403 seriously and felt that investing in longer counselling/training facilitated comprehensive understanding, 404 uptake of SI, and reduced likelihood of SI clients encountering problems later. Many providers also\n22\n405 clearly articulated that they believed investing that time would increase SI uptake and reduce their 406 workload later, in terms of reducing visits by repeat PA clients.\n407 \u201cIf the provider has counselled the clients so well in details, it becomes so easy for the 408 clients when it comes for them to try to self-inject. But in cases where the provider 409 does counsel the clients in a hurry without checking whether they are clear with the 410 process, [then] it becomes a problem for them when doing the trial injection 411 [practice].\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n412 \u201c[once trained in SI] \u2026 they will just come and collect, and they will not show up again 413 for an entire year. For them [not] to come back, it means [in] the gap they create we 414 can be serving other clients\u2026\u201d - HSA, Zomba\n415 However, a minority of providers admitted that time pressures drove them to take shortcuts in 416 counselling/training, most commonly turning to small-group counselling/training approaches over 417 individual approaches:\n418 \u201cDuring busy days, we do shortcuts (laughs)\u2026 We wait for at least the women to be 419 10 or 8 or 7, where you feel that this a good number. You just teach them in one kick 420 [one session] and then give them the methods. But for you to start one-on-one 421 [counselling/training] and [it] being a busy day, it does not work.\u201d \u2013 HSA, Nkhotakota\n422 On the clients\u2019 side, SI clients were also more likely than their PA counterparts to say their training had 423 taken a long time, even up to an hour, but typically they were satisfied with this length, as they felt it 424 aided their understanding:\n23\n425 \u201c[Interviewer: \u2026 Did you feel the provider spent enough time training you?] Yes. we 426 spent a lot of time at that place. [Interviewer: you understood what they trained 427 you?] I understood everything they trained me about.\u201d \u2013 married SI client, 20-29 428 years, Nkhotakota\n429 Meanwhile most PA clients who had not taken up SI felt that the counselling and training time they 430 received was too short to fully help them understand:\n431 \u201c[Interviewer: do you feel you received enough counselling from the provider?] no she 432 was rushing she seemed to have other things to do\u201d \u2013 married PA client, 20-29 years, 433 Mzimba South\n434 Discussion\n435 All providers in this study reported successfully integrating DMPA-SC and the SI option into at least the 436 first stages of their health education and contraceptive counselling approach. During health education 437 sessions, providers tended to focus only on the key benefits of self-injection, to spark client interest in 438 the method, and then follow that up with more in-depth information during individual counselling. In 439 taking this approach, providers seemed to understand that clients\u2019 initial fears at the idea of SI might put 440 them off trying the method and tried to focus on the advantages of the SI option to engage clients in 441 further conversations where they could provide more reassurance than they could in a group health 442 education context.\n443 During role-plays of counselling and SI training, providers generally displayed knowledge and counselling 444 practice on DMPA-SC that aligned with the information from national in-service training curriculum, with 445 a few exceptions where key messages/critical SI steps were missed. Future studies could investigate\n24\n446 whether the number of 'critical steps' for SI could be reduced without compromising quality of care, and 447 whether this could improve memory retention of the truly critical steps among providers and clients 448 alike. In the meantime, supervision visits for DMPA-SC trained providers should include emphasis on the 449 commonly missed steps/messages outlined in this study to refresh providers\u2019 memories. Use of 450 standardized messaging - such as the intervention by Burke at al. [6] - could be considered to ensure 451 key messages are covered during counselling.\n452 Over time, many providers in this study had developed and innovated their own counselling/training 453 techniques to reassure women sufficiently to take up the SI option. For example, providers relied on 1) 454 comparisons between DMPA-IM and DMPA-SC (and other needle-related concepts) to familiarize the 455 product, 2) showing women the Uniject to reassure them about needle size and simplicity, 3) 456 visualization of the SI steps (either using visual aids or a demonstration with gestures), 4) hearing from 457 other satisfied self-injectors, 5) giving women the opportunity to practice SI (sometimes on 458 demonstration materials but more commonly on themselves under observation) and 6) repeat trainings 459 for the minority of women who needed more time to build confidence.\n460 For their part, clients who successfully took up the SI option typically did so after in-depth counselling 461 and training to build their confidence. SI clients particularly flagged the following techniques as 462 particularly effective at increasing their confidence: the provider taking their time during 463 counselling/training; receiving a visual demonstration; seeing a demonstration; and hearing from other 464 SI clients. Repeated counselling/training was noted to be necessary for a minority of women wanting to 465 try SI, to give them time to get used to the idea and build up their confidence. While providers 466 themselves discussed counselling in-depth on potential side effects, some SI clients in the original 467 sample still wanted more information on these after seeing the \u2018best practice\u2019 video. This request from\n25\n468 SI clients to cover side-effects comprehensively echoes evidence from other contexts that women really 469 value receiving full and clear information, especially about potential side effects, during counselling. [13]\n470 PA clients who did not take up the SI option tended to report being put off the idea of SI from the start 471 due to fear/doubt in their own ability, and not feeling sufficiently reassured about the messages they 472 may have heard in health education to even learn more about the method. This aligns with evidence 473 from other contexts. [8] For those PA clients who were sufficiently interested to learn more about SI, 474 they were more likely than SI clients to report busy providers unable to take the time to counsel/train 475 them comprehensively, or rushed, incomplete counselling, including lack of visualizations or 476 demonstrations, and lack of testimonials from satisfied self-injectors, before being told to \u2018practice\u2019 on 477 themselves. Despite these clear gaps in their counselling experience, in most cases PA clients who did 478 not take up SI tended to blame themselves, particularly mirroring provider language about having 479 \u2018failed\u2019. This suggests that in skipping those key steps during counselling and training, providers failed to 480 sufficiently reassure PA clients and even reinforced their lack of confidence.\n481 Providers in this study said that it typically took them around 15-20 minutes (and up to 45 minutes) to 482 train women in SI. This is slightly shorter compared to estimates by providers in previous qualitative 483 studies in Malawi [4], and may reflect providers finding ways to streamline their counselling/training 484 approach over time as they learned the techniques that best reassured women. SI clients in this study 485 tended to report longer counselling (up to an hour in some cases) compared to PA clients, who tended 486 to describe their counselling time as \u2018rushed\u2019, suggesting that length and comprehensiveness of 487 counselling may influence confidence to take up SI. Most providers reported investing time to train 488 women in-depth on SI, despite time-pressure and competing priorities, because they felt it was 489 important to ensure clients fully understood the information and because they saw the benefit of 490 reduced workload once women were happily established with using SI. This is similar to previous\n26\n491 findings in Malawi. [4] However, some providers in this study reported time pressures leading them to 492 take counselling/training shortcuts; namely, training women in SI in groups, rushing through key 493 messages, and sometimes skipping visualizations or demonstrations. This group training practice was 494 also reported in a recent study with adolescent SI users in Uganda, where around half of the adolescents 495 interviewed would have preferred individual counselling versus around a third reported a preference for 496 group training due to the benefits of peer support and shared experience. [7] Research from the DISC 497 program also found mixed client perspectives on the group training practice in Uganda and Nigeria, with 498 some users emphasizing the need for discretion and confidentiality during training, while other women 499 feeling that peer \u2018training\u2019 and other group-based learning about SI may be appealing. [8] Future 500 research should investigate the trade-offs in terms of quality of care between SI training one-on-one or 501 in a group. In addition, peer testimonial approaches should be cognizant of the preference for 502 confidentiality among many SI users, as the researchers from the DISC program note. [8]\n503 Interestingly, most providers and (both PA and SI) clients in this study reported skipping the practice of 504 SI on inanimate objects. While some of this may be due to challenges with DMPA-SC stock and 505 maintaining expensive demonstration materials (i.e. condoms filled with sugar), other providers 506 reported skipping this step because they felt it was not useful to clients. The impact of skipping this step 507 should be explored in future research. However, something that was clear in this study was the negative 508 impact on client confidence of treating women\u2019s first attempt to SI as an \u2018exam\u2019. Instead of using 509 narratives implying women \u2018passing\u2019 or \u2018failing\u2019, providers should be encouraged to help unpack client 510 fears and support clients who still want to self-inject to build confidence over time, as some of their 511 colleagues are already doing. In some cases, multiple sessions may be needed, something that was also 512 found in the DISC program research. [8]\n27\n513 Overall, this study has highlighted the critical role that providers play in ensuring women are confident 514 in SI and has isolated key components of counselling and training that, if skipped, can negatively impact 515 women\u2019s confidence to take up the method.\n516 Key limitations of the study include:\n517  The sites chosen for the study and the people recruited at these sites may not be representative 518 of the providers/HSAs and clientele at all public sector sites in Malawi. The districts and facilities 519 were sampled randomly to minimize this bias. Results aligning with other similar qualitative 520 studies conducted in Malawi suggest the findings of this study were not unduly affected.\n521  The perspectives of 15\u201317-years-old contraceptive users were not included in this study, as the 522 high likelihood of their contraceptive use being covert, combined with the IRB requirement for 523 parental/guardian consent for this population, made their inclusion high-risk for accidental 524 disclosure of their contraceptive use to parents/guardians. It is probable that their perspectives 525 on counselling experience differ from the perspectives of adult clients \u2013 as was found in a recent 526 study in Uganda. [7]\n527  Providers were asked to role-play counselling and SI training sessions with interviewers during the 528 data collection. While these role-plays were likely affected by the knowledge of being observed 529 (Hawthorne effect), they still allowed the interviewers to understand the general approach and 530 content of provider counselling, as well as how it varied between providers.\n531 Conclusion\n532 Public providers in this study generally demonstrated knowledge and skills on DMPA-SC counselling in 533 line with national in-service training content and shared their examples of techniques for building client 534 confidence with the SI option. However, time- and resource-pressures can lead some providers to\n28\n535 deviate from recommended approaches \u2013 particularly in terms of grouping women for SI training, 536 and/or skipping visualizations, demonstrations, and the step of practicing on inanimate objects. Clients 537 taking up SI in this study tended to report receiving longer, more comprehensive, and more supportive 538 counselling and training than their PA counterparts who had not taken up SI.\n539 Based on these findings, public providers in Malawi should continue to receive post-training follow up 540 support focused on honing their counselling and training skills, addressing gaps in their knowledge, and 541 sharing best practices for building client confidence to SI, such as visualization, demonstration, and peer 542 testimonials. Use of standardized messaging during counselling could be considered to ensure key 543 messages are covered. Providers should be encouraged to avoid narratives of \u2018passing\u2019 or \u2018failing\u2019 when 544 training clients, instead focusing on helping to unpack client fears and support clients who still want to SI 545 to build confidence over time.\n546 Future research could explore the impact of removing practice on inanimate objects before proceeding 547 to SI; the impact on quality of care when implementing SI training one-on-one versus in small groups; 548 and explore opportunities to incorporate voluntary SI client testimonials into broader community 549 sensitization activities.\n550 Acknowledgements 551 The study authors would like to thank the Ministry of Health in Malawi for coordination clearance to 552 work at the study sites; the six data collectors who conducted interviews for this study; and all the 553 providers and clients who contributed their perspectives to this research. We would also like to 554 acknowledge Christina Allain, Irene Obiero, Emma Aldrich and Manish Burman from Clinton Health 555 Access Initiative for their advice and strategic support during the conduct of this study.\n556\n29\n557 References 558 1.
