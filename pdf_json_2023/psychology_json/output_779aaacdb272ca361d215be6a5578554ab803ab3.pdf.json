    "abstractText": "Dabigatran etexilate, an oral prodrug, is often used to treat complications linked to thrombosis. Dabigatran (DAB, active form) does not need to be monitored. However, there are several conditions, such as reduced renal function, traumatic bleeding, emergency surgery, the need for thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke, or the requirement to use other forms of anticoagulation, where knowing the concentration of DAB in the blood is indispensable. Unfortunately, there are no convenient DAB-specific point-of-care tests available. To solve this problem, two disposable sensors were constructed and optimised in this work to detect the anticoagulant drug DAB using novel co-facing disposable electrodes, which allows a calibration-free quantitation of the electroactive mediator concentration. A trypsin-based sensor was evaluated. This sensor performed well in a 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8) solution. However, trypsin was inhibited by alpha-1 antitrypsin when a plasma sample was introduced into the sensor. This problem was overcome by plasma filtration. This sensor showed a detection limit of 50.7 ng mL\u22121 DAB in plasma and a quantification range of 177\u2013500 ng mL\u22121. A thrombin-based sensor was also constructed. This sensor performed well in ten-fold diluted plasma, overcoming the filtration problem observed with the trypsin-based sensor. This sensor showed a detection limit of 9.6 ng mL\u22121 DAB in plasma and a quantification range of 11.5\u2013140 ng mL\u22121. Its extensive pH stability range, the possibility of working at physiological pH, low volume, low cost, and fast turnaround response (less than 20 s) make the calibration-free thrombin-based sensor a suitable point-of-care test to measure DAB concentration in the blood.",

            "text": "Thromboembolism-related complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis are frequent causes of death and disability worldwide [1,2]. Traditionally, warfarin and heparin have been used to prevent and treat these diseases. More recently, newer agents known as direct oral anticoagulants have been introduced. Dabigatran etexilate, an oral prodrug, is an example of this new group. In its active form, dabigatran (DAB, Scheme 1) directly and competitively inhibits free and clot-bound thrombin (a serine protease part of the coagulation cascade), offering critical clinical advantages over warfarin. These advantages include predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, minimal medication and food interactions, and fixed dosing without requiring routine laboratory monitoring of coagulation status [3\u20135]. Despite this, there are several conditions, such as reduced renal function, traumatic bleeding, emergency surgery, the need for thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke, or the requirement to use other forms of anticoagulation, where knowing the concentration of DAB in the blood is indispensable [6]. Currently, no DAB-specific point-of-care tests are available to measure the concentration of the drug in particular conditions of massive bleeding [7]. The traditional coagulation assays, such as the international normalised ratio, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and diluted thrombin time tests, are insensitive to most direct oral anticoagulants, including DAB [6,8]. The diluted thrombin time-based assays can\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28134953 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 2 of 12\nquantify dabigatran at relatively low levels. However, these results are unreliable in the case of massive overdose [6]. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique and an anti-dabigatran enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (quantification range 7.8\u2013125 ng mL\u22121) were developed [9\u201311].

The active benzamidine moiety forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of the thrombin aspartate residue Asp-189, inhibiting the enzyme activity [12]. Besides, DAB can also inhibit trypsin\u2019s enzymatic activities. The inhibitor constants for human thrombin and trypsin are 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 and 50.3 \u00b1 0.3 nM, respectively [12]. Therefore, this property can be used to develop a point-of-care sensor. For example, different colourimetric, fluorescent and electrochemical detection systems were developed to monitor the protease activity [13\u201318], being the electrochemical technique studied more extensively due to its low cost, simplicity, reduced size, and high sensitivity.

Results and iscussion 2.1. olta etric Study of Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP\nFigure 1-curve a shows the volta mogram of 1.0 mM Tos Gly P o rg-ACP in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8) obtained using the co-facing two-electrode system (Scheme 1), wher one electrode act as the working lectrod and the second ne as b th he count r and the pseudo-referenc electrode. The Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP substrate contains a protective tosyl (Tos) gr up coupled to the N-terminal and an ACP group connected to the C-te minal of the tripeptide. The ACP group is not elect oactive under thi conditi n, as the nitrogen lone pair of el ctr ns required t produce the oxidation product 2-chloro-pquin neimine (ACPox) is involved in the Arg-ACP amide bond. Consequently, no faradaic current was observed within the potential window studied.\nFigure 1. yclic lta r s f . os- ly- ro- rg- P in 20 ris buffer (p 8.8) (a) in the absence and (b\u2013f ) presence of 0.10 \u00b5M trypsin obtained with the use of the disposable co-facing gold electrodes. Voltammograms (b\u2013f ) were obtained within 4 min after loading the mixture onto the disposable electrode. Scan rate: 0.05 V s\u22121; T: 37 \u00b1 0.2 \u25e6C.\nThe oxidation of ACP (obtained as a product of the enzyme catalytic action on TosGly-Pro-Arg-ACP) to the corresponding ACPox was also studied. Figure 1-Curves b\u2013f provides examples of the reversible ACP voltammograms observed upon adding a mixture\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 4 of 12\nof 1.0 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP and 0.10 \u00b5M trypsin in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8) to the chamber formed by the two co-faced electrodes. The addition of trypsin triggers the appearance of reversible sigmoidal-shaped curves, which magnitude is a function of the enzymatic catalytic activity. This is represented in Figure 1 by consecutive voltammograms with increased limiting current obtained at different times during the first four minutes after mixing the enzyme and substrate. The half-wave Potential, E1/2, for the sigmoidal curve, is equal to 0.01 \u00b1 0.03 V vs. Au pseudo-reference electrode and independent of the ACP concentration and potential scan rate used. This E1/2 is equivalent to the Em (calculated from the average of the oxidation (Epox) and reduction (Epred) peak potentials (Em = 1/2(Epox + Epred)) [29,30], obtained for transient voltammogram and is highly reproduced in all disposable electrodes used (n = 50). The applied potential for the optimal chronoamperometric (CA) current response is obtained where the limiting current dominates the voltammetric behaviour. Based on Figure 1, any potential value \u22650.20 V vs. Au pseudo-reference electrode should fulfil this requirement. Therefore, considering the response sensitivity and operational stability, the 0.40 V vs. Au pseudo reference electrode was selected as the applied potential for ACP concentration change monitoring. The effect of impurities in the CA background current introduced by the redox specie present in excess, [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121, has been previously documented to introduce up to 15% error in the measurements [27]. Therefore, background subtraction is required before the analysis of the respective CAs. This procedure also eliminates the interference of any redox active molecule present in the plasma sample used, increasing the selectivity of this sensor. For the optimisation of different assay parameters, such as pH and substrate concentration, the current at 60 s was initially used."

            "text": "The optimum working pH for each enzyme was evaluated (Figure 2A,C,E). The response of 0.10 \u00b5M trypsin in the presence of 0.50 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121, as well as the activity of 1.0 \u00b5M thrombin in the presence of 0.50 mM TosGly-Pro-Arg-ACP, and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 were investigated using 10 mM MES-HCl (0.50 M NaCl) buffer solution for pH 6; 10 mM Tris (0.50 M NaCl) buffer for pH 7 to 9; and finally, 10 mM borate (0.50 M NaCl) buffer for pH 10. Figure 2A,E shows that trypsin has a maximum activity at ca. pH 8.8. However, thrombin shows a maximum activity between pH 6 and 9, with small but no statistically significant change observed in this range (Figure 2C,E). The breakpoint at about pH 9 corresponds to the pKa of arginine. The considerable activity differences observed between these two enzymes have important implications on the sensor development, as the pH will need to be regulated at 8.8 before every measurement that uses the trypsin enzyme. Nevertheless, it could operate at physiological pH (pH 7.4) when thrombin is used instead. Figure 2 shows the variation of the current extracted from CA at 60 s obtained with 0.10 \u00b5M trypsin (Figure 2B,F), and 1.0 \u00b5M thrombin (Figure 2D,F) at the optimal pH conditions established in Figure 2E and with the Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP concentration varied from 0.05 to 0.80 mM. The enzyme concentration was selected, so a balance between the cost-effective production of the disposable strips and the test sensitivity was achieved. By carefully choosing this ratio, it is possible to extend this sensor detection range for lower and higher DAB concentrations. A systematic increase in the amperometric current at 60 s is observed as the [S] increases to ca. 0.20 mM for both enzymes. The current plateau after this [S] results from the enzymes arriving at their limiting catalytic values. It is important to note that, throughout this work, different enzyme (thrombin and trypsin) to substrate ratios were employed to validate the results and comments.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 5 of 12\n2.3.

Then, a plot of \u2206k vs. ln[DAB] or \u2206k vs. [DAB] was generated to illustrate the correlation between the obtained information and the concentration used.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 6 of 12\nThis approach has a greater advantage because it does not require a calibration plot to get cred. As previously discussed, the effect of change in viscosity can be separated to obtain the value of D, k, and the concentration of the redox species [27]. In general, whenever \u2206k was used in the plot, it should be considered that no calibration curve is required. \u2206I vs. ln[DAB] or \u2206I vs. [DAB]: By extracting current at 60 s from the corresponding CA, a plot of \u2206I vs. ln[DAB] or \u2206I vs. [DAB] gives the dose-response curve. However, in this scenario, just selecting current values at a particular time in CA, does not allow the separation of the effect of viscosity change on D, k, and cred. Therefore, a calibration curve is necessary to quantify DAB whenever \u2206I is used for plotting. The viability of this sensor to detect and quantify DAB in human plasma was also evaluated. As previously discussed, analysis of the transients using Equation (1) yields relatively constant D values when the open circuit potential is applied for 5 s [27]. A DACP = 1.16 \u00b1 0.02 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121 value was calculated by fitting Equation (1) to the experimental CA in ten-fold diluted plasma at 37 \u25e6C. A reaction rate constant, i.e., k = 7.06 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u22121 s, was extracted from the fitting using the pseudo linear section of the experimental CA and the previously mentioned DAC value. The detection of thrombin catalytic activity in ten-fold diluted serum has been reported previously [31]. Consequently, the same dilution will be used in this work to quantify DAB using the thrombin-based sensor. The following steps were applied: (i) a mixture containing ten-fold diluted plasma, 0.30 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP, and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 was loaded into the sensor, and CA was recorded. This serves as background current, which is later subtracted to each CA in this series; (ii) a ten-fold diluted plasma was mixed with 0.22 \u00b5M thrombin. Then, this mixture was added to a solution in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.30 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121. This final mixture was immediately injected into the sensor, and the corresponding CA was recorded; (iii) tenfold diluted plasma spiked with different DAB concentrations was mixed with 0.22 \u00b5M thrombin. The resulting mixture was added to a 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) solution containing 0.30 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121. This final mixture was immediately injected into the sensor, and the CA was recorded (Figure 3A). These CAs, after background subtraction, show the effect of 0-140 ng mL\u22121 DAB concentration on the reaction rate constant, denoted by a decrease in the transient current with an increase in the DAB concentration. The rate constants were extracted from fitting Equation (1) to the respective pseudo-linear section of the experimental CAs (Figure 3B). Figure 3C shows a linear relationship between \u2206k vs. ln[DAB], with a linear regression equation \u2206k = \u22124.65 \u00d7 10\u221210 + 2.13 \u00d7 10\u221210 ln[DAB]. The R2 for this plot was = 0.9959. A lower detection limit (LDL) of 9.6 ng mL\u22121 was obtained when a 3\u00d7 standard deviation (SD) value was introduced to the linear regression equation and [DAB] calculated. Similarly, the lower quantification limit (LQL) of 11.5 ng mL\u22121 was extracted using a 10 \u00d7 SD value in the same equation. These data show an excellent linear relation in the 11.5\u2013140 ng mL\u22121 DAB concentration range. Figure 3D represents a plot of change in current extracted from CA at 60 s, \u2206I vs. ln[DAB]. The linear regression equation \u2206I = \u22124.96 \u00d7 10\u22127 + 4.69 \u00d7 10\u22127 ln[DAB] was extracted from the fitting, showing an R2 of 0.9839. The LDL and LQL for this plot were 4.8 ng mL\u22121 and 15.6 ng mL\u22121, respectively. This graph shows good linearity in the 15.6\u2013140 ng mL\u22121 DAB concentration range. Comparing Figure 3C,D, it is possible to see that both show excellent sensitivity for the point-of-care detection of DAB in diluted plasma samples. However, the \u2206k vs. ln[DAB] is preferred as it provides [DAB] in less than 20 s without a calibration plot. Besides, this sensor can quantify \u226430 and \u226450 ng mL\u22121 DAB with high confidence. The quantification of <30 ng mL\u22121 DAB is critical to perform surgeries in cases of bleeding in emergency scenarios. Similarly, \u226450 ng mL\u22121 DAB is an upper range of quantification in patients suffering from ischemic stroke to initiate thrombolysis treatments [32].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 7 of 12olecules 2023, 28, 4953 7 of 12\nFigure 3.

Trypsin was added to a plasma sample, and its activity against Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP was monitored (Figure 4A). The resulting CA shows a significant reduction in the current magnitude. This may result from alpha-1 antitrypsin, a 52 kDa protein of the serpin family commonly present in the plasma [33,34]. This inhibition of the trypsin activity was observed even when the plasma was diluted 50, 70, and 90% in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8) solution. To test this hypothesis, the plasma was filtered using centrifugal filters of 10 kDa size cut-off before adding trypsin. Figure 4A shows that eliminating alpha-1 antitrypsin from plasma allows the recovery of approximately 75% of the trypsin activity in the Tris buffer. The capacity of the assay to quantify DAB was then tested in filtered plasma (Figure 4B\u2013D). The following procedure was used: (i) a background current was established with the filtered 7:3 plasma containing 0.10 \u00b5M trypsin and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8); (ii) a filtered plasma was then mixed with 0.10 \u00b5M and a solution containing 0.07 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.8).

Figure 4C shows a plot of change in current at 60 s vs. DAB concentration in the range of 0\u2013500 ng mL\u22121. The \u2206I vs. [DAB] follows the linear regression equation \u2206I = 7.91 \u00d7 10\u22129 + 2.46 \u00d7 10\u22129 [DAB] with R2= 0.9988 up to 280 ng mL\u22121 under the current trypsin to substrate ratio. The LDL and LQL were 50.7 and 177 ng mL\u22121, respectively. Figure 4D illustrates the plot of change in the rate constant, \u2206k vs. [DAB], within the range of 0\u2013500 ng mL\u22121. The \u2206k values were obtained by fitting the pseudo linear section of various CA (Figure 4B) using Equation (1). The plot of \u2206k vs. [DAB] returned poor linearity and negative values at a low concentration of DAB. This poor performance, which is related to the large standard deviation obtained, severely limits the application of the trypsin-based sensor. A possible explanation for these results may be that during the DAB-spiked plasma filtration process, DAB interacted with the filtration medium or plasma proteins, significantly reducing its availability within the filtrate. Based on the differences between the trypsin and thrombin sensors, the thrombin sensor has the potential to be used in point-of-care anticoagulation therapy due to its relatively wide pH working range and minimum plasma manipulation required. Another essential feature of this sensor is the excellent response time needed to run a single measurement, which is less than 20 s, and a calibration-free setup if the change in the rate constant is used. In addition, it requires 7.0 \u00b5L of the sample, which is one of the main requirements of any point-of-care diagnostic system. Assays for reproducibility were conducted employing repetitive standards solutions in plasma diluted by a factor of ten (n = 3) using a 20 mM tris buffer (pH 7.4) solution composed of 0.22 \u00b5M thrombin, 0.3 mM Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP, and 20 mM [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 along with varying concentrations of DAB (Table 1). The resultant data exhibited low values of the standard error of the mean (SEM), demonstrating the excellent precision of the proposed DAB sensor. Moreover, the table illustrates that the actual quantities of DAB recovered closely mirrored the quantities of DAB initially added, thus attesting to the high accuracy of the constructed sensor. Besides, as the background subtraction step eliminates the interference of all redox active molecules present in plasma, the sensor offers high selectivity.\nSEM = standard error of mean."

The substrate Tos-Gly-Pro-Arg-ACP was purchased from DSM-Nutritional Products Ltd. Branch Pentapharm (Aesch, Switzerland) and reconstituted in Milli-Q water (18.2 M\u2126 cm\u22121) to a 5.0 mM concentration. This solution was prepared daily and stored at 4 \u25e6C when not in use. Nanosep devices of 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off were purchased from Pall Corporation (New York, NY, USA). Dabigatran was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, ON, Canada) and used without further purification. Although all concentrations in this work are reported in molar concentrations, the DAB concentration will be reported in mg mL\u22121. A 1.0 mg mL\u22121 DAB in 0.10 mM hydrochloric acid stock solution was prepared daily and stored at 4 \u25e6C when not in use. Lyophilised pooled plasma was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and reconstituted using\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 10 of 12\nMilli-Q as per instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia). This solution was kept at room temperature for about 30 min to stabilise and finally stored at 4 \u25e6C when not used. Thrombin solution was prepared to 100 \u00b5M concentration using 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0, 0.50 M NaCl. A 1.0 \u00b5M trypsin solution was prepared using 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, containing 0.50 M NaCl, 0.05 M CaCl2, 0.02 M MgCl2 and 0.01% Tween-20. Both these enzyme solutions were stored at \u221220 \u25e6C when not in use. From the above stock solutions, respective enzyme aliquots were prepared just before the experiments. Electrochemical measurements: All electrochemical measurements were carried out using a WaveNow potentiostat (Pine Research, Durham, NC, USA). Disposable co-facing gold electrodes (two electrodes system, Scheme 1) were supplied by Universal Biosensors Inc. (Rowville, Australia). The characteristics of this sensor were previously described [27] and consists of two 10 to 15 nm gold sputtered on Melinex sheets (Eastman Performance Films, Martinsville, VA, USA) separated by a 95 \u00b5m thick double-sided adhesive PET spacer (Adhesive research INC, Glen Rock, PA, USA), where one electrode acts as the working electrode and the other as both the counter and the pseudo-reference electrode. The disposable sensors were heated to 37 \u00b1 0.2 \u25e6C on an external digitally controlled heating bar and maintained under this condition until the end of the assay. A potential of 0.40 V was applied to the working electrode to collect all CAs. The assays in buffer solutions were performed using a fixed sample volume of 7.0 \u00b5L, which is large enough to fill the electrode chamber. To this end, 2.0 \u00b5L of 0.26 \u00b5M trypsin was mixed with 4.13 \u00b5L of Tris buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. These samples were spiked with different DAB concentrations to cover the 0\u2013600 ng mL\u22121 range. Then, 0.88 \u00b5L of 2.0 mM substrate containing 20 mM of [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121 was added to this mixture and immediately loaded into the test strips. The assay in plasma using trypsin was performed by spiking this solution with different DAB concentrations to cover the range of 0\u2013600 ng mL\u22121 and then centrifuged using Nanosep devices for about 30 min at 12,000\u00d7 g. Finally, 3.60 \u00b5L of filtered plasma was added to 2.0 \u00b5L of 0.32 \u00b5M trypsin and 1.40 \u00b5L of 2.50 mM substrate containing 20 mM of [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121. This mixture was immediately loaded into the test strip, and the respective CA was recorded. Similarly, the assay in plasma using thrombin also requires spiking the solution with different DAB concentrations to cover the range of 0\u2013500 ng mL\u22121. The plasma solution was then diluted ten-fold with 10 mM Tris buffer pH-7.4 (0.50 M NaCl). Then, 3.60 \u00b5L of diluted plasma was added to 2.0 \u00b5L of 3.50 \u00b5M thrombin and 1.40 \u00b5L of 3.0 mM substrate containing 20 mM of [Fe(EDTA)]\u22121.

            "text": "Two disposable sensors were constructed and optimised to detect the anticoagulant drug DAB using novel co-facing disposable electrodes that separate the effects due to viscosity and concentration, allowing the improved quantitation of the electroactive mediator concentration. In the case of the trypsin-based sensor, lower concentrations of DAB \u226430\u201350 ng mL\u22121 could not be quantified. Non-specific interactions of trypsin with plasma components and low DAB affinity with trypsin were the primary reasons for this lack of sensitivity. For example, when plotting \u2206I vs. [DAB], this sensor could detect 50.7 ng mL\u22121 DAB and quantify it in the 177\u2013280 ng mL\u22121 range. Consequently, the trypsin-based sensor does not fulfil the requirements for a point-of-care anticoagulation diagnostic tool due to the pH sensitivity (pH limited to 8.8) and prolonged plasma filtration required before the DAB concentration is measured. Meanwhile, the thrombin-based sensor performed well when diluted plasma samples were used to quantify DAB. This sensor can detect \u22659.6 ng mL\u22121 DAB and quantify 11.5\u2013140 ng mL\u22121 when \u2206k vs ln[DAB] was used. Similarly, an LDL and LQL of 4.8 and 15.6 ng mL\u22121 DAB, respectively, were achieved when the \u2206I vs. ln[DAB] plot was\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4953 11 of 12\nconsidered. These sensors covered the therapeutic range and clinically significant concentrations. This is particularly important in an emergency centre where concentrations \u2264 30\u201350 ng mL\u22121 DAB are deemed safe for emergency surgeries for people under DAB therapy. If the k values are used, a high-performance calibration-free sensor can be achieved. Its extensive pH stability range, the possibility of working at physiological pH, and its low cost and fast turnaround response make the thrombin-based sensor a suitable DAB-specific point-of-care test to measure the drug concentration in particular conditions of massive bleeding or emergency surgeries.\nAuthor Contributions: A.K.V.M.: Investigation, Writing\u2014original draft.
