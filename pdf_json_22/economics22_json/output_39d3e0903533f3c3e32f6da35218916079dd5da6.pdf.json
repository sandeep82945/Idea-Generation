    "abstractText": "5 Today's economically developed nations are also among the most advanced in terms of energy production and 6 consumption. In particular, the widespread implementation of renewable energy sources and the plethora of 7 technological advancements supporting long-term prosperity stand out. The research aims to examine how carbon 8 dioxide (CO2) emissions, technological advancements, and the use of renewable energy sources affect economic 9 expansion. Research and development (R&D) expenses are regarded as a proxy for technological progress. Using 10 annual data for the G7 countries from 1996 through 2020, the analysis quantified the interplay between the factors. We 11 examine the association between our variables using panel unit root tests, Pedroni cointegration tests, ARDL 12 coefficient estimations, and Granger (Dumitrescu Hurlin) causality tests. The Pedroni cointegration test indicated that 13 the variables are cointegrated. According to the ARDL method of computation, increasing levels of CO2 emissions are 14 beneficial to long-term economic growth. However, improvements in renewable energy and technology dampen 15 economic expansion. As a conclusion, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test shows that there is a unidirectional chain 16 of events from CO2 emissions to technological improvements, from economic growth to use of renewable energy, and 17 from consumption of renewable energy to technological advances. Expansion of the economy and increased emissions 18 of carbon dioxide have a reciprocal relationship. 19",

In particular, the widespread implementation of renewable energy sources and the plethora of 7 technological advancements supporting long-term prosperity stand out. The research aims to examine how carbon 8 dioxide (CO2) emissions, technological advancements, and the use of renewable energy sources affect economic 9 expansion. Research and development (R&D) expenses are regarded as a proxy for technological progress. Using 10 annual data for the G7 countries from 1996 through 2020, the analysis quantified the interplay between the factors. We 11 examine the association between our variables using panel unit root tests, Pedroni cointegration tests, ARDL 12 coefficient estimations, and Granger (Dumitrescu Hurlin) causality tests. The Pedroni cointegration test indicated that 13 the variables are cointegrated. According to the ARDL method of computation, increasing levels of CO2 emissions are 14 beneficial to long-term economic growth. However, improvements in renewable energy and technology dampen 15 economic expansion. As a conclusion, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test shows that there is a unidirectional chain 16 of events from CO2 emissions to technological improvements, from economic growth to use of renewable energy, and 17 from consumption of renewable energy to technological advances. Expansion of the economy and increased emissions 18 of carbon dioxide have a reciprocal relationship. 19\nKeywords: Economic growth, ARDL, renewable energy consumption, technological innovations, CO2 emissions, G7 20\nJel classification: O13, O32, O47, Q53 21"

            "text": "Academic researchers and policymakers have long focused on economic growth, especially long-term 23 sustainability. Economic growth is a subject related to research and development activities, energy consumption, and 24 environmental pollution closely. Energy use, which is one of the foundations of economic growth, is of great 25 importance in terms of the limited resources used. In addition, for the production factor, which is important factor for 26 economic development, countries must constantly engage in innovative activities to ensure production techniques, 27 product diversity, and product continuity. These creative activities are provided by technological innovations, patent 28 studies, and research and development activities. As a result of all these activities, the concept of environmental 29 pollution, which is one of the most critical issues of our century, appears before us. Here, the close relationship between 30 innovation activities, economic growth, energy use, and air pollution emerges. 31\nEnergy is crucial for economic growth and activities, but environmental hazards arising from fossil fuels (oil, 32 coal, gas) and the possibility of depletion of these resources have triggered the search for alternative energy sources 33 (Bildirici and G\u00f6kmeno\u011flu, 2017). Researchers' attention to energy consumption, environmental safeguarding, and 34 economic growth has increased remarkably to cope the common threat (Baz et al., 2019; Akadiri et al., 2019). At this 35 point, renewable energy sources\u2019 importance comes forward. Renewable energy is an environment-friendly energy 36 source known as harmless to public health. In addition, renewable energy resources are a continuous resource that can 37 increase energy security by reducing a country's dependence on fossil fuels. (Al-Mulali et al., 2015). Considering 38 specially developed countries\u2019 energy needs, economic growth and renewable energy consumption relationship gain 39 tremendous importance. Increments in energy demand and climate problems resulting from the fossil fuel consumption 40 intensively have forced most countries to move on renewable resources to improve air quality and reduce their 41\n* Corresponding author E-mail addresses: erkameminayvaz@erciyes.edu.tr (Erkam Emin Ayvaz). didemover@erciyes.edu.tr (Didem \u00d6ver)\necological footprint (Nasrullah et al., 2021). In addition to renewable energy sources, technological progress and 42 industrial innovation also play an essential role in ensuring long-term economic growth (Grossman and Helpman, 43 1994). Schumpeter (2010), one of the first thinkers of the relationship between industrial innovation and technological 44 progress and economic growth, mentioned that these two factors have an essential role in economic development 45 (Hasan and Tucci, 2010). 46\nThe study's goal is to analyze the connections between four variables that have been discussed individually in 47 the literature: carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), economic growth (GDP), R&D expenditures (RD), and renewable 48 energy consumption (REN). One of the different values that the study will add to the literature is to expand the research 49 line by assuming that innovation, which is thought to affect economic growth, makes a significant difference not only 50 in the number of patents but also in R&D expenditures. Additionally, it is investigated whether there is a correlation 51 between the economic might of nations with large R&D spending and the benefits of innovation on economic growth 52 through previously developed economies. 53\nThis research uses panel data analysis to examine the interplay between a wide range of factors, such as CO2 54 emissions, technological advancement, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, and the long-term growth of 55 economies. Using data on the G-7 nations from 1996 to 2020 and the Pedroni Cointegration test, we find that the 56 variables have been persistently related. According to the ARDL model, increasing R&D investment and renewable 57 energy use will have a negative impact on economic development, whereas increasing CO2 emissions would have a 58 favorable impact. According to the Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test, there is only a one-way connection between 59 renewable energy use and technical advancement, economic development and renewable energy, CO2 emissions and 60 technological advancement, and renewable energy use and CO2 emissions. The correlation between CO2 emissions 61 and economic expansion is demonstrated. 62\nHere's how the rest of the study is laid out. The theoretical underpinnings of the investigation were assessed in 63 the review of relevant literature. Datasets, econometric models, methods, and findings are all described in detail in the 64 methodology, data, and findings sections. The conclusion reveals the findings of the research. 65"

            "text": "The findings of a comprehensive investigation of the link between technological progress, economic expansion, 67 and greenhouse gas emissions might have far-reaching policy ramifications and provide potential answers to a number 68 of related issues. There is a wealth of research in the literature looking at how rising CO2 levels are linked to thriving 69 economies. Some academics argue that these two issues need to be addressed together for the purpose of the reliability 70 of the study (Acheampong, 2018). Even while there is some published research on the issue of innovation and economic 71 growth, the great bulk of this material focuses on the connection between carbon dioxide emissions and GDP growth. 72\nAcheampong (2018) analyzed the GDP growth, carbon emissions, and energy usage of 116 countries from 1990 73 to 2014 using the PVAR and System-GMM. When economies expand, carbon emissions decrease globally, but there 74 is no evidence that this is true for the Caribbean or Latin America. The research concluded that carbon emissions are 75 helpful for economic expansion. Heidari et al. (2015) used a state-of-the-art PSTR model to test the environmental 76 Kuznets curve (EKC) by analyzing the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic 77 development in five ASEAN countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, and Malaysia). The study 78 validated the environmental kuznets curve for five ASEAN nations and revealed an inverse nonlinear relationship 79 between CO2 emissions and economic development. Saidi and Hammam (2015) used data from 58 states to analyze 80 the connection between GDP growth, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy consumption. The panel data dynamics 81 were calculated in this study using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) from 1990 to 2012. A rise in carbon 82 dioxide emissions is shown to have a positive effect on energy efficiency, according to the reports of four international 83 committees. Bouznit and Pablo-Romero (2016) analyzed Algeria's CO2 emissions and economic development. By 84 employing an autoregressive distributed lag model, we were able to verify the validity of the environmental kuznets 85 curve (EKC) for Algeria between 1970 and 2010. Growth in the economy has been linked to lower carbon emissions, 86 and this trend is likely to continue. Lotfalipour et al. (2010) used the Toda-Yamamoto technique, a novel time series 87\nmethodology, to analyze the connection between GDP growth, fossil fuel use, and carbon dioxide emissions in Iran 88 from 1967 to 2007. The correlation between economic growth and carbon emissions appears to be unidirectional, 89 according to experimental evidence. A recent study found that emitting carbon dioxide had no positive effect on GDP 90 growth. Using data from 1980 to 2009, Al-mulali (2011) examined how MENA oil consumption affected GDP growth. 91 Using a panel model, the authors found that CO2 emissions, oil consumption, and economic growth had a long-term 92 relationship. A cointegration study was performed by Mikayilov et al. (2018) over the years 1992-2013 to look at how 93 GDP growth and CO2 emissions interacted in Azerbaijan. Long-term coefficients were predicted using a variety of 94 techniques, including the cointegration test, CCR, ARDLBT, FMOLS, DOLS, and the Johansen approach. The studies 95 showed that economic expansion had a statistically significant beneficial effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Ozt\u00fcrk 96 and Acaravci (2010) used the autoregressive distributed lag limits test to look for cointegration between GDP per 97 capita and carbon emissions per capita in Turkey between 1968 and 2005 and found none. Employment, GDP growth, 98 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and energy use were all investigated to determine their respective causes and effects. 99 However, linking per capita carbon emissions to GDP has not been verified. Changes in the driving forces of the 100 economy were shown to have an impact on CO2 emissions, which was investigated by Robalino-L\u00f3pez et al. in 2015. 101 The environmental Kuznets curve was used to verify the study's findings, and the results revealed that Venezuela did 102 not satisfy the necessary parameters for the environmental Kuznets curve throughout the test period of 1980\u20132025. 103 CO2 emissions and economic development in EU member states were analyzed by Bengochea-Morancho et al. (2001). 104 The correlation between GDP expansion and CO2 emissions from 1981 to 1995 in 10 selected European countries was 105 analyzed using a panel data technique. According to the data, there is a clear divide between the most and least 106 industrialized nations. Those nations with incomes above the EU average were found to have higher carbon emissions 107 than those with incomes below the average. According to the research of Bhattacharyya and Ghoshal (2010), who 108 focused on the 25 nations responsible for the biggest proportion of global carbon emissions, the rate at which individual 109 countries' economies expand is positively correlated with the rate at which their carbon emissions rise. Magazzino 110 (2015) utilizes a VAR model, a unit root test, and a Granger causality test to investigate the correlation between CO2 111 emissions, GDP growth, and electricity consumption in Israel from 1971 to 2006. The findings demonstrated a cause-112 and-effect partnership between GDP and CO2 output. Through the use of the cointegration test, Bozkurt and Akan 113 examine the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and economic growth in Turkey (2014). Annual 114 data on carbon dioxide emissions, GDP, and energy use were compiled from 1960 to 2010. The study found that carbon 115 dioxide emissions slow economic expansion. 116\nMaclaurin (1953) wrote about how technological innovation contributes to economic expansion. He defined 117 innovation as the process of securing patents, and he talked about how this process correlates with a thriving economy. 118 According to Timmons and Bygrave (1986), who analyzed the effects of investments in technological advances and 119 the initiatives that resulted from these investments on economic growth from 1967 to 1982, the two factors interact 120 positively. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of economic expansion was developed by 121 Segerstrom (1991). Some companies invest in research and development of high-quality items while others duplicate 122 them, and this cycle repeats in the model's steady-state equilibrium. He claims that the discovery of new items through 123 R&D procedures will boost national economies. Bilbao-Osorio and Rodr\u00edguez-Pose (2004) examined the effect of 124 research and development (R&D) activities and investments on the economy and society at large. In recent years, rising 125 rates of innovation have come to be viewed as one of the most important factors in fostering economic expansion. 126 Using cross-sectional data for 37 countries that joined the GEM in 2002, Wong et al. (2005) employs a Cobb-Douglas 127 production function to identify technological innovation and company creation as independent determinants of growth. 128 Even if technical entrepreneurship were to increase or new businesses were to pop up more frequently as a result of 129 the study, it would not necessarily lead to better economic performance or quicker economic growth rates, the authors 130 state. Galindo and M\u00e9ndez-Picazo (2013) examined the connection between economic growth and innovation using a 131 Schumpeterian entrepreneurial framework. The three equations have been used to test hypotheses in this setting for 132 industrialized nations. Estimating equations for the years 2001-2009 employs GLS and PLS techniques. The promotion 133 of new technology in the pursuit of better profits through entrepreneurs is seen as crucial to economic progress, and 134 innovation is seen as the vehicle to do just that. With their research, Galindo and M\u00e9ndez (2014) hope to draw 135 conclusions on the connection between economic development, technical innovation, and entrepreneurialism. The 136 report offers a comparative analysis of entrepreneurial endeavors across advanced economies. For the years 2002\u2013137 2007, the results reveal a positive association between entrepreneurial and innovative activity and economic growth, 138\nas well as a cyclical relationship between the three variables. Pece et al. (2015) investigated the potential impact of 139 innovations on GDP growth over time. Central and Eastern European (CEE) nations are analyzed using multiple 140 regression models. A favorable correlation between innovation and GDP growth was found when the variable was 141 analyzed using a variety of tools (patents, number of brands, R&D expenditures, etc.). According to Adenle et al. 142 (2017), novel company models and agricultural practices contribute to economic expansion. Thompson (2018) found 143 that the rate of growth of internal innovations was crucial to the growth rates of the economy and all other 144 macroeconomic variables. To contribute to the research on the link between institutions, innovation, and economic 145 performance in developing nations, Bekana (2020) used an empirical panel dataset to assess 37 sub-Saharan African 146 countries. According to the findings, a more stable democracy can boost economic growth and development by creating 147 a more conducive environment for innovation. 148\nNumerous studies have examined the relationship between the use of renewable energy and economic 149 expansion. The brief literature on renewable energy and economic growth is included in Table 1. 150"

            "text": "The data sets, econometric models, and study procedures are all broken down here. The primary goal of this 153 research is to analyze the effect of G7 countries' usage of renewable energy sources, technical advances, and CO2 154 emissions on GDP growth from 1996 to 2020. To do this, the panel data method was employed. 155\n156\nOne indication of technical progress included in the study is the amount spent on R&D. This is because these 158 costs are factored into the budgets of wealthy nations. It has been possible to utilize the GDP variable as a proxy for 159 economic growth, and then to use the CO2 emission variables to analyze the effects of that increase on the natural 160 world. All of the statistics are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database. Table 2 displays every 161 independent variable included in the analysis. 162\nSimilar to that of Aslan et al. (2021), the following function is created wherein economic growth (GDP) is the 163 response variable, and renewable energy consumption (REN), CO2 emissions (CO2), and R&D expenditures (RD) are 164 the dependent variables: 165 \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0f = \ud835\udc87 (\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d, \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udfd0, \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc03) 166 ( 1 ) 167\nThe following econometric model Eq. (2) is constructed in line with the variables to be used in the study 168 according to Eq. (1): 169 \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2d = \ud835\udec3\ud835\udfce + \ud835\udec3\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc2d + \ud835\udec3\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc2d + \ud835\udec3\ud835\udfd1\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc2d + \ud835\udecd\ud835\udc2d 170 ( 2 ) 171\nwhere t denotes times series (1996-2020), \u03b2k (k=1,2,3) are the coefficients on REN, CO2, and RD. Finally, \u00b5 t 172 represents the estimation residual. Table 2 displays the information that was analyzed throughout the investigation. In 173 this study, we utilize logarithmic analysis on every variable. Using the aforementioned econometric model, we will do 174 a panel series analysis (Eq. 2). Unit root tests will first be used to determine whether or not the variables are stationary. 175 Finally, we'll use ARDL coefficient estimates and Granger causality tests to understand the nature of the long-term 176 link between the variables we've identified. 177\nBefore proceeding to the analysis, variables\u2019 descriptive statistics will be presented in Table 3. The table figures 178 the descriptive statistical information of its data. 179\nWe started by checking if the variables were stationary. To do so, scientists use panel unit root testing. High 181 power makes panel unit root testing preferable to individual time series analysis. These tests are adapted versions of 182 conventional multi-series unit root analyses for panels (al-Mulali et al., 2014). Two examples of panel unit root tests 183 are Levin, Lin, and Chu (LLC) and Im, Pesaran, and Shin (IPS). Levin, Lin, and Chu (LCC) test suppose that there is 184 a joint unit root process so that \u03c1i is identical across cross-sections, whilst \u03c1i might alter between the cross-sections in 185 the Im, Pesaran, and Shin (IPS) unit root test because, it allows an individual unit root process (Im et al., 2003; Levin 186 et al., 2002). By taking logarithms, panel unit root tests were performed to detect the stagnations of all variables. H0 187 indicates that it contains unit root, whilst H1 represents that it does not contain unit root. As can be seen in Eq. 3 below, 188 the LLC and IPS tests both perform as expected when using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test: 189 \u2206\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 = \ud835\udf36\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udfcf + \u2211 \ud835\udf37\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8b\u2206\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udc8b\ud835\udc7f\u2032\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\ud835\udf39\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8b=\ud835\udfcf + \ud835\udf3a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 190 ( 3 ) 191\nIt is presumed that a standard \u03b1=\u03c1-1 yet allow the lag order for different terms to diverge between cross-sections. 192 The letter y presents the GDP on Eq. 3. The hypothesis used in the LLC test are as follows: 193\nH0: \u03c1i: \u03b1=1 (where the null hypothesis contains unit root) 194\nH1: \u03c1i: \u03b1<1 (where the alternative hypothesis contains no unit root). 195\nWe first verified the stability of all of our observables before doing unit root testing through the LLC and IPS 197 panel techniques. The results of the unit root testing are summarized in Table 4. None of the variables are statistically 198 significant at the level of analysis, as shown by the panel unit root tests. The panel unit root condition holds for all 199 variables, hence the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. As a result, it's likely that the variables aren't holding steady. 200 Once past the initial level, all variables have stabilized, allowing the null hypothesis to be rejected. 201\nThe results in Table 4 show that the variables are not steady since their levels have unit roots. Since they are 202 not constant, the analysis moved on to the first differences of all variables. After calculating the initial difference, it 203 was determined that all variables had attained stationarity. The initial difference of no variables contains a unit root. 204 The next step was to examine the interdependencies between the variables. The cointegration test was run after the 205 series was rendered stationary to look for evidence of a long-term correlation between the two variables. 206\nAccording to the unit root test results, the cointegration test is applied. The concept of cointegration may be 207 identified as the systematic long-term joint movement of more than one economic variable (Yoo, 2006). The Pedroni 208 cointegration test (Pedroni, 1999) was applied to many studies such as Streimikiene and Kasperowicz (2016), Ozturk 209 and Acaravc\u0131 (2010), and al-Mulali et al. (2014). Pedroni cointegration test is applied only when the stationary at first 210 difference occurs in variables. The Pedroni cointegration test is essential in examining if the variables are cointegrated 211 or not (al-Mulali, 2014). Also, it allows for heterogeneous intersections and trend coefficients between countries which 212 is represented in Equation (4) below: 213 \ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 = \ud835\udf36\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 + \ud835\udf39\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 + \ud835\udf37\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc75\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 + \ud835\udf37\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc76\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 + \ud835\udf37\ud835\udfd1\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 + \ud835\udf3a\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95 214 ( 4 ) 215\nwhere i=1,\u2026, N refers to members of the panel (7 countries), t=1,\u2026, N represents the period (1996-2020), GDP 216 represents economic growth, REN represents renewable energy consumption, CO2 represents CO2 emissions, RD 217 represents technological innovation, and \u03b2 refers to the slope of coefficients. The parameter \u03b4i symbolize the 218 deterministic trend effects, and \u03b1i refers to individual effects. At last, the estimated residual deflections from the 219 long-term relationship are represented with \u03b5i. To examine whether or not cointegration exists, Pedroni (1999, 2004) 220 presented two tests: panel tests and group testing. The panel v-statistic, the panel rho-statistic, the panel PP-statistic, 221 and the panel ADF-statistic are the four statistics used in panel tests based on the within dimension technique. But 222 three statistics employ the between dimension method to generate group tests. It is recommended to use group 223 statistics such as the rho-statistic, the PP-statistic, or the ADF-statistic. There is an asymptotic normality in these 224 seven statistics. Pedroni's (1999) research provides comprehensive information on the statistics used to test for panel 225 cointegration. 226\nThe Pedroni cointegration is employed, later recognizing that the study's variables show statioriness at the first 228 difference. It is important to examine if the variables (lnCO2, lnRD, lnREN) are cointegrated with lnGDP or not. Table 229 5 briefly reviews the result of the Pedroni cointegration test. According to the results, four statistics are significant, 230 therefore, rejecting the null hypothesis. This shows relationship between lnGDP, lnCO2, lnRD and lnREN, respectively 231 in the long term. 232\nFollowing the discovery of the cointegration between the series, ARDL (Autoregressive Distribution Delay) 233 models were constructed to explicitly state the short- and long-run relationships. The ARDL framework has many 234 benefits over alternative models (Adams et al., 2018). Data of types I(0) I(I) and short time series, or both, are suitable 235 for usage inside the ARDL framework, as revealed by Abbasi et al. (2021). Also, the ARDL method gives coherent 236 and vigorous results for the long-term and short-term relationships between variables. For dependent and independent 237 variables, different lags might be used. As calculated, the Pedroni cointegration test (Table 5) reveals a cointegration 238 between variables. Equation 5 represents the long-run ARDL model as follows: 239\n\u2206\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc95 = \ud835\udf36\ud835\udfce + \u2211 \ud835\udf36\ud835\udfcf\u2206\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc6e\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udc8a + \u2211 \ud835\udf36\ud835\udfd0\u2206\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc6c\ud835\udc75\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc8a=\ud835\udfcf + \u2211 \ud835\udf36\ud835\udfd1\u2206\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc6a\ud835\udc76\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udc92 \ud835\udc8a=\ud835\udfcf + \u2211 \ud835\udf36\ud835\udfd2\u2206\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc79\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc95\u2212\ud835\udc8a \ud835\udc92 \ud835\udc8a=\ud835\udfcf + \ud835\udf3a\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc92\n\ud835\udc8a=\ud835\udfcf 240 ( 5 ) 241\nwhere \u0394 is the first difference operator and \u03b5t is the pure white noise term. ARDL (2, 3, 3, 3) model was 242 estimated in the model where the maximum lag length was taken as 3. Table 6 shows the estimation results of the 243 ARDL (2,3,3,3) model and the long-term and short-term coefficients calculated based on these results. 244\nThe figures in Table 6 show that all of the variables are significantly different from chance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% 245 levels. The long-term estimating model found a statistically significant positive connection between CO2 emissions 246 and economic growth of 0.675221%. Investment in innovative technologies and the use of renewable energy sources 247 both dampen GDP growth by 2.542573 percent and 0.161304 percent, respectively. When considering the bigger 248 picture, this CO2 emission finding agrees with what has been found by Say and Yucel (2006), Ahmad and Du (2017), 249 Chen (2001), and Muhammad (2019). Our finding is consistent with those of Khan et al. (2020), Mohiuddin et al. 250 (2016), and Abbasi et al. (2021), who all found that rising carbon emissions had a negative impact on short-term 251 economic growth. There is a statistically significant negative link between technical innovation and economic growth, 252 suggesting that rising levels of technological innovation dampen economic growth by 2.542573% over the long run. 253 Kahouli (2018), who discusses a similar pattern in Mediterranean nations, lends credence to this conclusion. It was 254 also shown that technical innovation significantly predicted future GDP growth. Contrary to what Shahbaz et al. (2020) 255 assert, renewable energy slows down economic growth. Adopting renewable energy sources may potentially contribute 256 to economic growth in the not-too-distant future. Our results have been confirmed by studies conducted in Turkey and 257 15 nations in West Africa (Ocal and Aslan, 2013; Maji et al., 2019). 258\nCausality analysis, first developed by Granger (1969), helps to understand whether a variable can obtain helpful 260 information from other variables. The main reason for making Granger causality in panel data analysis is that it can 261 produce more effective results. Finally, using the Dumitrescu Hurlin causality approach, the causal association between 262 the variables was established after the estimate of the ARDL coefficients. The Granger causality test was performed 263 and summarized in Table 7. 264\nTable 7 provides the probabilities for six distinct chains of causation. To begin, research and development (R&D) and 265 the use of renewable energy sources are inextricably linked. This result is in agreement with the causal link between 266 R&D and renewable energy consumption expressed by Zafar et al. (2019) and Adedoyin et al. (2019). (2020). While 267 Adedoyin et al. (2020) show a bidirectional causation correlation between renewable energy consumption and R&D, 268 Zafar et al. (2019) only find a unidirectional relationship. In addition, there is a direct correlation between a growing 269 economy and the use of renewable energy. Consistent with the findings of Liu et al. (2021) and Jebli and Youssef 270 (2015), but not with the findings of Chang et al. (2015), Saidi and Mbarek (2016), Khobai and LeRoux (2017), Troster 271 et al. (2018), and Sebri and Ben-Salha (2014), who discovered a bi-directional causal relationship between economic 272 growth and renewable energy. Our findings challenge the claims of Tugcu et al. (2012), Chiou-Wei et al. (2008), and 273\nNarayan and Doytch (2017), who argued that economic growth and the use of renewable energy sources are unrelated. 274 Our findings that using renewable energy sources is linked to decreased carbon dioxide emissions are in line with those 275 of Jebli and Youssef (2015) and Liu et al. (2015). (2021). Alam et al. (2021) and Kahouli (2017) both agree that there 276 is a direct link between rising CO2 levels and reduced funding for R&D. (2018). In contrast to this conclusion, 277 however, Lin (2021) claims that no causal association exists between CO2 emissions and R&D investment. Finally, 278 we find that an expanding economy is directly linked to higher CO2 emissions. Evidence from other studies, including 279 those by Peng et al. (2018), Shahbaz et al. (2016), Saidi and Mbarek (2016), Appiah (2018), and Shahbaz et al. (2016), 280 corroborate this result (2016). 281"

            "text": "Since the beginning of industrialization, energy use has significantly grown. Countries have started looking for 284 alternate energy sources due to the progressive depletion of energy resource stocks caused by rising demand and 285 environmental harm. Countries have shifted to using renewable energy because energy resources must be used 286 effectively, efficiently, and sustainably to ensure sustainable development. This way, the balance between the economy 287 and the environment will be established. With this innovative approach, technological investments in countries have 288 increased. 289\nThe link between technological innovation, the use of renewable energy sources, and CO2 emissions for the G7 290 countries is investigated in this paper, as well as how these factors affect economic growth. The panel data analysis 291 approach was used to examine the long-term relationships between the variables between the 1996 and 2020 time 292 periods. As an indicator of technological innovation, the variable of R&D expenditures was preferred. This is because 293 developed countries allocate much of their budgets to R&D expenditures. In the following parts of the study, the 294 Pedroni cointegration test, ARDL coefficient estimation and Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality tests were performed, 295 and the relationship between variables was examined. 296\nThere is a link between G7 countries' CO2 emissions, consumption of renewable energy, and technological 297 innovations from 1996 to 2020, according to the study's authors. Based on Pedroni's cointegration results, we know 298 that the variables are fully cointegrated. The long-term coefficients were calculated using the ARDL estimation method 299 after the Pedroni cointegration test established the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. It turns 300 out that the coefficients we estimated using the ARDL method are statistically significant. According to the estimated 301 coefficients, a one percentage point rise in the variables (RD and REN) would have a negative impact on economic 302 growth. But it's obvious that a growing economy is linked to higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions. It was 303 determined by a Granger causality test that there was a unidirectional relationship between REN and RD, CO2 and RD, 304 GDP and REN, and CO2 and GDP. 305\nThe analysis suggests that the following describes the negative impact of the variables on economic growth. 306 Renewable energy may have a dampening effect on economic growth because it is more expensive than traditional 307\nenergy sources and necessitates more costly investments. Taking into account the utilization rate of renewable energy 308 resources in the energy share of industrialized nations, the substantial expenditures made in renewable energy to 309 minimize environmental pollution have a negative influence on economic growth. In addition, it is thought that 310 investments in innovative technologies and R&D expenditures may be more public benefit investments that do not 311 positively affect economic growth, or those technological innovations have superabundant costs to cause a long 312 payback period. These results do not show us that investments in renewable energy sources should be reduced. On the 313 contrary, economic growth can be significantly contributed via renewable energy investments and those investments 314 can reduce environmental pollution in the future for a sustainable environment. On the other hand, shifting the 315 technological innovations to other areas with much higher return areas will help turn the negative effect on economic 316 growth into a positive direction. 317\nAuthor Contribution 318\nE.E.
