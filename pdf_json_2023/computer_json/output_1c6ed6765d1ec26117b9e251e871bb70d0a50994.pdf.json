(a) Unfolded band structure to restore the original periodicity for G-type order with N = 3 and U = 2 . Unlike the nonmagnetic bands whose weights are identical over all momenta, the unfolded bands are weighted ranging from 0 to 1. The color and the size of circle indicate the weights. (b) Corresponding local density of states \u03c1LDOS(\u03c9) and (c)\u00a0k-projected density of states \u03c1k(\u03c9) at high symmetry points with a broadening factor \u03b7 = 0.1."
