    "abstractText": "Laser treatments have become popular in Dermatology. In parallel to technologic development enabling the availability of different laser wavelengths, non-invasive skin imaging techniques, such as reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), have been used to explore morphologic and qualitative skin characteristics. Specifically, RCM can be applied to cosmetically sensitive skin areas such as the face, without the need for skin biopsies. For these reasons, apart from its current use in skin cancer diagnosis, our systematic review reveals how RCM can be employed in the field of laser treatment monitoring, being particularly suitable for the evaluation of variations in epidermis and dermis, and pigmentary and vascular characteristics of the skin. This systematic review article aims to provide an overview on current applications of RCM laser treatment monitoring, while describing RCM features identified for different applications. Studies on human subjects treated with laser treatments, monitored with RCM, were included in the current systematic review. Five groups of treatments were identified and described: skin rejuvenation, scar tissue, pigmentary disorders, vascular disorders and other. Interestingly, RCM can assist treatments with lasers targeting all chromophores in the skin and exploiting laser induced optical breakdown. Treatment monitoring encompasses assessment at baseline and examination of changes after treatment, therefore revealing details in morphologic alterations underlying different skin conditions and mechanisms of actions of laser therapy, as well as objectify results after treatment.",

Introduction\nOver the past few decades, non-invasive treatments are increasingly requested in Dermatology [1\u20134]. Among these, laser therapy became popular due to technologic development leading both to the availability of different light wavelengths targeting different chromophores and to protocols reducing the downtime of treatment, according to patients\u2019 requests [3\u20136]. In this scenario, in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) has emerged as a non-invasive technique enabling horizontal visualization at different layers of the skin with good contrast and high resolution, providing cytologic and architectural details [7\u20139]. It has been proven as an excellent add-on tool for diagnostic purposes in Dermatology as well as for the analysis of healthy skin, since RCM provides an optical \u201chistological\u201d biopsy of the living tissue in a totally non-invasive manner, therefore avoiding scars, which is pivotal for aesthetic areas such as the face [10]. Specifically, RCM has been mainly employed in Cosmetic Dermatology to examine presence of regular/irregular keratinocytes at epidermis, collagen morphology and eventual elastosis at dermal level and pigmentary characteristics of the skin [8,10,11]. Importantly, these parameters have been recently standardized according to semi-quantitative and qualitative scales in order to improve recognition, reliability and reproducibility of evaluations [10]. Another advantage of noninvasive RCM is its ability to enable repeated examination of a given skin area, facilitating dynamic evaluation of skin changes, such as those that occur during treatment monitoring. RCM has been used to assess the effectiveness of various laser therapies in treating a variety of skin conditions, including acne, rosacea, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. By offering non-invasive, real-time evaluation of skin changes, RCM can assist clinicians in customizing laser treatments to meet the individual needs of patients, optimizing treatment outcomes [10,12]. To summarize, RCM has become an essential tool in the field of dermatology, revolutionizing the approach of clinicians towards non-invasive skin treatments. In addition to its diagnostic and treatment monitoring applications, RCM has also been used to assess the efficacy of laser therapy in various skin conditions, including skin rejuventation, scars, pigmentatry and vascular disorders. By providing non-invasive, real-time evaluation of skin changes, RCM can assist clinicians in tailoring laser treatments to meet the unique needs of individual patients, resulting in optimal treatment outcomes. Currently, an overview about RCM in laser treatment monitoring is lacking. Therefore, we systematically review literature on the topic in order to summarize fields of application and to identify pre- and post-treatment RCM features that can be assessed in laser treatment monitoring.\n2. Materials and Methods\nStudies conducted on human subjects involving laser treatments for skin conditions monitored with RCM were screened. Electronic databases were systematically searched and included MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science and Cochrane library databases. Search strategy adopted was similar across the databases and developed using the following keyword: \u201claser\u201d AND \u201creflectance confocal microscopy\u201d. Our search included studies from inception to October 2022. Two authors independently screened the abstracts for inclusion and exclusion criteria (SG and SA). In case of doubt or discordance, a third opinion was obtained (CL).\nStudies were excluded based on the following criteria:\n\u2022 language other than English \u2022 in vitro or animal studies \u2022 not involving laser treatments \u2022 concerning tumors and not used to understand underlying mechanisms of laser therapies \u2022 studies without specific RCM features described before and after treatment \u2022 studies involving less than 8 patients\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1039 3 of 20\nFrom each of the included studies, the following data were extracted: first author, year of publication, indication, number of patients and numbers of female patients, age, skin type/ethnicity, study type, laser type, RCM criteria at baseline and variations posttreatment, follow up timing, efficacy and safety.\n3. Results 3.1. Study Selection\nA total of 142 records were screened after duplicate and preliminary screening removal. Based on title/abstract screening, 101 studies were excluded. Forty-one full texts were thus assessed for eligibility and 20 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, Figure 1.\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1039 3 of 25 \u2022 studies without specific RCM features described before and after treatment \u2022 studies involving less than 8 patients From each of the included studies, the following data were extracted: first author, year of publication, indication, number of patients and numbers of female patients, age, skin type/ethnicity, study type, laser type, RCM criteria at baseline and variations posttreatment, follow up timing, efficacy and safety. 3.

Forty-one full texts were thus assessed for eligibility and 20 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, Figure 1. Based on skin disease, 5 types of applications were identified: skin rejuvenation (n = 5), scar tissue (n = 6), pigmentary disorders (n = 5), vascular disorders (n = 2) and other (n = 2) [13\u201332]. Based on laser source employed in included studies, different laser sources were distinguished, those targeting water in the skin such as fractional C02 laser (n = 5) and erbium (n = 3), both ablative and non-ablative, those absorbed by hemoglobin, such as Nd:YAG nm (n = 1) and pulsed dye laser (n = 2). Additionally, laser wavelengths targeting pigment were also employed, including Q-switched laser (n = 5) and picosecond laser (PSL) (n = 4). Interestingly, PSL induce intraepidermal and dermal vacuole formation through laser-induced optical breakdown (LIOB), therefore resulting in multiphoton ionization due to high temperature and pressure created by high-energy irradiation with extremely short pulse durations, leading to additional applications. A summary of RCM features is presented in Table 1; an overview of studies included is reported in Table 2.\nBased on skin disease, 5 types of applications were identified: skin rejuvenation (n = 5), scar tissue (n = 6), pigmentary disorders (n = 5), vascular disorders (n = 2) and other (n = 2) [13\u201332].

Skin Rejuvenation\nA total of 5 studies explored the role of RCM in laser monitoring for skin rejuvenation [13\u201317], Table 2. Most of the studies reported the use of lasers targeting water into the skin, including fractional CO2 laser and non-ablative fractional erbium laser while one study encompassed 1064 nm fractional PSL use, exploiting laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB).

About 1 to 4 months after treatment, a clinical reduction of hyperpigmentation associated to aging (photoaging) was found to correspond to the reduction of both epidermal and dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) RCM features of pigmentation, represented by mottled pigmentation or polycyclic papillary contours, respectively. Importantly, an increased number of dermal papillae and appearance of long straight fibers presenting a parallel alignment, or reticular collagen, was observed [13\u201317]. Interestingly, this last RCM feature corresponded to a clinical improvement of wrinkles/rhytids [16,17].\n3.3. Scar Tissue\nA total of six studies concerning treatment monitoring with RCM after laser treatments of scar tissue were included. Two studies involved acne scars, other two atrophic and hypertrophic surgical scars and the remnant two striae distensae. Similarly to skin rejuvenation, laser sources included CO2 fractional laser and non-ablative resurfacing lasers as well as PSL. RCM features included honeycombed or cobblestone pattern in epidermis, epidermal thickness, dermal papillae at DEJ and thin reticulated fibers or coarse collagen at dermal level [15,18\u201322], Table 2. In detail, immediately after fractional CO2 laser or PSL to treat acne or surgical scars, black micro-holes surrounded by well-defined or fringed borders within the surrounding tissue could be observed [15,18\u201322]. Following the first week after treatment, a progressive repair of skin layers was observed. Three to 6 months post-treatment, thin reticulated collagen fibers arranged to form a net, with variable brightness of the collagen fibers, were observed [15,18\u201320]. Interestingly, this arrangement has been related to collagen remodeling [14]. Interestingly, both surgical scars and striae distensae showed parallel collagen fibers, mainly orthogonal to major axis of scar tissue. These parallel collagen fibers were significantly reduced after CO2 laser and PSL for striae distensae [21,22]. Interestingly, a new confocal feature, the \u201cneat wall\u201d, was described at baseline in striae distensae [21], Figure 2. This parameter corresponds to a distortion of the normal DEJ, visible only in RCM mosaic images; it resembles a well-demarcated wall separating regular areas of DEJ, which are formed by round papillae and fibrillar or reticular collagen (definition tab RCM). This parameter was reduced in patients receiving more than 4 CO2 laser sessions, as compared to those receiving \u22644 sessions at 4-week post-treatment [21].\n3.4. Pigmentary Disorders\nDue to the ability of RCM to visualize pigmentation at different layers, RCM has been used as a treatment monitoring tool in different pigmentary disorders: solar lentigines, caf\u00e9 au lait macules (CALMs), infraorbital dark circles, melasma [23\u201327], Table 2. Intuitively, the main laser source employed was Q-switched and a comparison with this laser source and PSL was available for one study. In solar lentigines, edged dermal papillae and polycyclic papillary contours were observed at baseline. Immediately after Q-switched treatment, dark structureless areas could be observed throughout the epidermis and dermal papillae were hyporefractive. After 10 days, at the DEJ, non-edged dermal papillae were observed, in 9 out of 12 cases containing a few melanophages. Bright reflective rims surrounding the dermal papillae were no longer observed at the DEJ [23]. For CALMs, length and density of papillae were estimated. Interestingly, CALMs with irregular borders showed lower length and density of papillae as compared to those with smooth borders and better response to laser treatment [24]. Two studies were performed concerning the treatment of infraorbital dark circles in a total of 60 women of which half treated with Q-switched ruby and Q-switched Nd:YAG\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1039 16 of 20\nlaser. At baseline, greater melanin deposition in the upper dermis of the dark circle area was observed, as compared to the cheekbone skin (control), but no significant difference in epidermal pigmentation. After 8 sessions, about 70% of subjects showed over 50% improvement of pigmentation, while the control area did not show any variations [25,26]. Medicina 2023, 59, 1039 20 of 25\nFigure 2.

Pigmentary Disorders Due to the ability of RCM to visualize pigmentation at different layers, RCM has been used as a treatment monitoring tool in different pigmentary disorders: solar lentigines, caf\u00e9 au lait macules (CALMs), infraorbital dark circles, melasma [23\u201327], Table 2.

After 8 sessions, about 70% of subjects showed over 50% improvement of pigmentation, while the control area did not show any variations [25,26]. Differently from what observed for dark circles, melasma patients can show pigmentation located at different layers. Jo et al. compared the effects of PSL and Qswitched laser on melasma. After treatment, either an increase of activated melanocytes at basal layer of epidermis or an increased amount of melanophages were observed at upper dermis 24 h after treatment [27]. Interestingly, the presence of dendritic-shaped cells after treatment has been associated with a relapse of melasma 3 months after multiple sessions of Q-switched laser treatment [28]. Figure 3 shows the presence of superficial pigmentation represented by mottled pigmentation at epidermal level at baseline and the disappearance of the pigmentation after Q-switched laser treatment.\nA B\nFigure 2.

Vascular Disorders\nTreatment monitoring of port-wine stains (PWS) with RCM has been reported in two papers [29,30], Table 2. PWS are a type of vascular malformation that affect the skin and can cause significant p ychological distress. Treatment options include pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy, which targets the abnormal blood vessels to reduce their appearance. Based on different cl nical s onse an RCM analysis of blood flow, RCM features asso iated to resistance t tr atment for facial PWS were identified, being represented by high blood flow, large diam ter, de p locatio [30]. In erestingly, bas d on different depths of v ssels, different pulse durations of laser are related to different reduction of diameter vessels whil no influence has be observed for density [29]. Overall, RCM is a valuable too for m itoring the vascular response to laser therapy and for characterizing the microvascular changes associated with various vascular disorders. Further research is needed to fully underst nd the potential applications of RCM in the field of vascular medicine.\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1039 17 of 20edicina 2023, 59, 1039 21 of 25\nFigure 3.

Based on different clinical response and RCM analysis of blood flow, RCM features associated to resistance to treatment for facial PWS were identified, being represented by high blood flow, large diameter, deep location [30].

Overall, RCM is a valuable tool for monitoring the vascular response to laser therapy and for characterizing the microvascular changes associated with various vascular disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential applications of RCM in the field of vascular medicine.\n3.6. Other Applications Laser treatment monitoring with RCM has also been explored in other fields [31,32], Table 2. Wound healing has been studied after CO2 laser on healthy skin and results observed were in line with previous findings related to applications for skin resurfacing and scar tissue treatment [31]. Additionally, RCM has been employed to monitor sebaceous hyperplasia treated with dye laser. At baseline, lesions appeared like dilated sebaceous duct surrounded by dilated vessels [32].\n4. Discussion Nowadays, laser treatment monitoring can be performed with non-invasive skin imaging techniques, such as RCM [14\u201332]. RCM is an advanced technique enabling the visualization of the skin at a quasi-histological resolution [7,9]. It has been mainly applied to the field of skin cancers [33,34] but has expanding applications in Cosmetic Dermatology [1,35]. As a matter of fact, the possibility to visualize pigmentation at different layers, collagen and vessels in a non-invasive manner, makes RCM particularly suitable to monitor laser treatments. Accordingly, when laser treatments are applied on\nFigure 3. Reflectance confocal microscopy images of patient showing superficial melasma at baseline and 3 months after Q-switched laser treatment.

Discussion\nNow days, laser treatment monitoring ca be performed with non-invasive skin imaging techniques, such as RCM [14\u201332]. RCM is an advanced technique enabling the v ualization of the skin at a quasi-histol gical resolution [7,9]. It has been mainly applied to the field of skin cancers [33,34] but has expanding applications in Cosmetic Dermatology [1,35]. As a matter of fact, the possibility to visualize pigmentation at different layers, collagen and vessels in a non-invasive manner, makes RCM particularly suitable to monitor laser treatments. Accordingly, when laser treatments are applied on cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face or are employed to treat aesthetic conditions, it would be preferable to avoid scarring as a consequence of skin biopsies [36,37]. Our results highlight that RCM can be applied to monitor skin rejuvenation treatments, scar tissue, pigmentation and vessels at different layers after laser therapy. Specifically, RCM applied to skin rejuvenation and scar tissue treatment procedures revealed the advantage to monitor of skin healing process after laser therapy and to objectify variations of epidermis, DEJ and collagen or elastosis in the dermis. Additionally, RCM enables the visualization of micro-holes or microcolumns within the epidermal pattern, that have been associated to fractional laser treatment [14,15]. Similar findings were observed with histology [13]. Considering the high reflectivity of melanin, RCM is particularly useful to study pigmention distribution in different skin layers in different pigmentary disorders [38], overcoming the limitations related to other non-invasive tools, such as Wood\u2019s lamp and dermoscopy which cannot locate the pigment precisely [39]. Interestingly, both pigment depth and the presence of dendritic-shaped cells in the epidermis have been associated\nMedicina 2023, 59, 1039 18 of 20\nwith poor response to laser treatments, therefore highlighting the prognostic impact of RCM [27,28]. Our study reveals that specific terminology employed for healthy skin analysis can also be applied to define variations occurring after laser approach for skin rejuvenation, scar tissue and pigmentation [8,10,14,37]. Lastly, for vascular disorders, RCM has been employed to monitor the changes in blood vessels following laser treatments for port-wine stains. The ability to assess the depth, diameter, and density of blood vessels non-invasively may help optimize treatment parameters and improve overall treatment outcomes [29,30]. Currently, there are no studies comparing RCM with other techniques in laser treatment monitoring but some authors reported the alternative or complementary use of other techniques such as digital photography with automated features count and 3D imaging. Histologic studies, representing the reference for skin analysis, are mainly employed on ex vivo samples or in vivo in areas other than the face or on scars on the face in order to minimize visible scarring in aesthetic sites [40\u201342]. Therefore, many non-invasive techniques have been applied to the field of laser monitoring, apart from RCM, such as dermoscopy, digital photography with automatic features count (VISIA) and 3D assessment [3,43\u201347]. These techniques enable the visualization of pigment and vessels but, differently from RCM, they cannot be employed for the analysis of dermal features such as collagen characteristics and analyses per each skin layer. In conclusion, RCM is a non-invasive technique that has shown promise in monitoring a variety of laser treatments in dermatology providing insights into the observation of variations associated with clinical improvement. RCM features identified in our systematic review can be applied to future studies to objectively evaluate changes in the skin and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of action of lasers. By facilitating noninvasive, real-time evaluation of skin changes, RCM can assist clinicians in tailoring laser treatments to meet the unique needs of individual patients, ultimately leading to optimal treatment outcomes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, validation, writing\u2014review and editing: S.G. and C.L.; methodology, investigation, data curation S.G., S.A., A.M.R., M.M., S.C. and M.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation S.G. and S.A.; visualization, supervision S.P.N., S.R.M., F.R., N.Z. and G.P.
