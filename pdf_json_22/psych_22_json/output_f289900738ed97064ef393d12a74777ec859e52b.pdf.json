Accordingly, studying the antecedents and influencing mechanisms of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is quite necessary. In the perspective of leader\u2013member exchange theory and resource conservation theory, the leaders\u2019 bias tendency will lead to the workplace marginalization perception of some employees and promote the generation of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Thus, this research is intended to discuss the influence of leaders\u2019 bias tendency toward employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior, and to analyze the mediating e ects of employees\u2019 perception of workplace marginalization and the moderating role of emotional commitment to the organization. The sample of this study covered 500 Chinese full-time corporate employees. The conclusions of the research indicate that the following: (1) Leaders\u2019 bias tendency is vitally and absolutely correlatedwith employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior; (2) Workplace marginalization perception plays an intermediary role between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior; (3) Emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating role between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior; (4) Emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating role between workplace marginalization perception and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. These findings will help organizations and managers to recognize the harm of bias tendency, regulate their own behaviors, and e ectively reduce the generation of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors, thereby promoting knowledge sharing and innovative behaviors in organizations.\nKEYWORDS\nleaders\u2019 bias tendency, employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior, workplace marginalization perception, leader-member exchange theory, resource conservation theory\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is defined as the behavior of individuals who intentionally conceal learning in the organization confronts knowledge inquiries from others (Connelly et al., 2012). A study by Riege (2005) showed that knowledge sharing and knowledge communication among employees can effectively promote the improvement of management efficiency, thereby cutting the management cost of the organization and increasing the innovation efficiency of the organization. However, not all labors would like to share knowledge in the specific workplace. For example, a survey of Peng (2012) shows that 46% of employees in China had experienced employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. In addition, a study by AMR also showed that although corporations are ready to pay $73 billion per year on knowledge management and learning dissemination, there are even people who are unwilling to share knowledge (Martine, 2010). This shows that employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is universal. Thus, it is particularly material to comprehend the causes that generate employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Numerous studies have explored the reasons of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors, such as interpersonal suspicion (Connelly et al., 2012; Jiang and He, 2013), psychological ownership of knowledge (Peng, 2013), employees\u2019 open personality (Teh et al., 2011; Lin and Wang, 2012; Anand and Jain, 2014), perception of organizational competitive climate (Yang and Tang, 2018), and sense of procedural fairness (Zhou et al., 2020).\nHowever, the influence of organizational leadership style on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior has not been fully discussed (Tian et al., 2021). Whether in China or in other countries, leaders\u2019 bias tendency is a leadership style and a common phenomenon in the workplace (Liden and Maslyn, 1998; Zhou et al., 2020). Leaders\u2019 bias tendency is defined as the standard of specific \u201cindividual-oriented leadership behavior\u201d demonstrated by leaders confronted distinct subordinates (Wu et al., 2010). A study by Gao and Wang (2018) showed that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency are culturally adaptive and universal in China. However, the influence mechanism of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is still unclear. Therefore, it is particularly important for this study to investigate the mechanisms of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency toward employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nOn the basis of the leader\u2013member exchange theory and resource conservation theory, this study argues that workplace marginalization perception has a prominent mediating effect on the leaders\u2019 bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. As the \u201coutsiders\u201d of the informal collective of leaders, these employees cannot be treated fairly by the leaders in the distribution of opportunities and resources, and are more likely to be excluded by the \u201cinsiders.\u201d Therefore, employees are more likely to feel workplace marginalization perception in the\natmosphere of their leaders\u2019 bias tendency. On the other side, it is also complicated for the workers who are marginalized in the workplace to generate motivation to participate in knowledge sharing and organizational innovation in the institution. In the view of resource conservation theory, people\u2019s sharing behavior is based on the principle of reciprocity, and resources are invested to maintain the existing resources and generate new resources. Obviously, in the context of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency and the workplace marginalization perception, he benefits of the employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is clearly greater.\nIn addition, the influence of specific cultural and social contexts on research should be noted (Mao et al., 2017). In China, the traditional Confucian thought has deeply influenced the character, values, behaviors as well as the norms of Chinese people and has derived Confucian workplace values (Yan et al., 2007). Employees with high level of Confucian workplace values will try their best to obey the organization and authority, and become more loyal (Hwang, 2000), resulting in generating an emotional commitment to the organization. Therefore, we regard emotional commitment to the organization as a specific cultural factor to study the moderating effect of emotional commitment to the organization on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nEmployees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization tend to be more motivated to do things that contribute to the organization\u2019s development. Therefore, we believe that the employees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization will make less employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors than employees with low level of emotional commitment to the organization under the differential pattern of leaders\u2019 bias tendency. On the other hand, under the perception of workplace marginalization perception, employees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization also engage in less employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors than the employees with low level of emotional commitment to the organization. The reason is that the employees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization devote more energy to their work, while their low level of emotional commitment to the organization merely includes the contractual connection between the employee and the organization. Therefore, the employees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization will certainly contribute more when it comes to organizational interests.\nThe innovations of this manuscript are as follows: (1) In terms of research perspective, this research elucidates the influence of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency toward employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior from the perspective of leadership style and organizational culture. (2) In terms of research methods, this study uses a questionnaire survey with a 4- month interval to collect data, which effectively reduces the error effect of the homologous method.

            "text": "Leader\u2013member exchange theory and resource conservation theory\nLeader\u2013member exchange theory, clarified as \u201crelationshipbased social exchange between leaders and members\u201d (Graen, 1995) is useful for explaining the behavior and psychological states of leaders or employees in the workplace (Kim et al., 2009; Portoghese et al., 2015). This theory believes that with limited resources within organizations, leaders will develop a limited number of subordinates who meet their role expectations or appreciation, giving them more care and trust; thus, forming informal leader-centered groups (Dienesch and Liden, 1986; Loi et al., 2009). Cleyman et al. (2013) condensed the core ideas of leader\u2013member exchange theory. First, due to the constraints of time and resources, leaders cannot have the same relationship with every subordinate, but will selectively establish different relationships with their subordinates according to whether their performance meets the leadership expectations and their own employment preferences (Graen et al., 1986; Liden and Maslyn, 1998). In addition, according to the connection between supervisors and workers, subordinates are divided into \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders.\u201d The \u201cinsiders\u201d can receive more trust, support, resources, etc., and are more likely to be respected by the leader whereas the \u201coutsiders\u201d may be marginalized in the workplace or gain the perception of workplace marginalization (Deluga and Perry, 1994; Sparrowe and Liden, 1997).\nResource conservation theory was originally proposed as a stress theory by Hobfoll (1989) and applied in the study of psychology and organizational behavior (Hobfoll, 1989). This theory holds that people have a tendency to keep, protect, and obtain resources, and thus, both the latent threat of resource loss and the actual resource loss can generate individual tension and stress (Hobfoll et al., 2018). Hobfoll summarizes several principles of resource conservation theory. First, the impact of losses is greater. For individuals, the influence of resource loss is much more principal than resource acquisition, and its influence is faster and continues longer (Halbesleben and Bowler, 2007; Halbesleben, 2010; Halbesleben and Wheeler, 2011). Second, in the face of the desperate situation of resource exhaustion, individuals\u2019 self-protective defense mechanisms will be triggered and they will display aggressive or irrational behavior (Halbesleben et al., 2014). Finally, neither individual nor organization can own resources alone, but influence each other. Therefore, the organizational climate and cultural setting play an indispensable role in resource maintenance (Hobfoll, 2012).\nThe influence of the leader\u2019s bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior\nStudies have shown that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency is widespread in East Asian cultures (Xu et al., 2002). The leaders\u2019 bias tendency will occur in the workplace when \u201cemployees\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nseek personal friendship with their bosses, and their bosses also actively develop personal connections with themselves\u201d (Sun and Wang, 2013; Gao and Wang, 2018). The leaders\u2019 bias tendency is described as whether the leaders are inclined to make corresponding decisions for the purpose of maintaining personal interests or self-interest (Liu et al., 2015). The studies have shown that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency will have a negative influence on employees\u2019 opinions and manners, such as moral disengagement (Tang et al., 2018), which is not conducive to the realization of group performance (Wu et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2015), reduce trust in leaders (Kunze et al., 2016), lead to mutual competition, jealousy, relationship conflicts among subordinates (Zhang et al., 2015), and generate subordinates\u2019 negative attitude toward leadership and organization (Li et al., 2017).\nBecause of the leader\u2013member exchange theory, we believe that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency will promote the employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. The attitudes and behaviors of leaders at work are important factors affecting employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior (Tang et al., 2015). Employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors are associated with inappropriate leadership styles and leadership behaviors. The leaders\u2019 bias tendency excludes some employees from leading informal groups and weakens their support, resources, and opportunities (Chen et al., 2014; Yu and Zhang, 2016). If employees are affected by this leadership style and leadership behavior, they will have a negative impact and stop investing their own resources at work, such as weakening employees\u2019 willingness to share knowledge (Cai et al., 2013). Based on the above, this research proposes Hypothesis H1 as follows:\nH1: There is a positive correlation between the leaders\u2019 bias\ntendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nThe mediating role of workplace marginalization perception\nOn the basis of the leader\u2013member exchange theory and the resource conservation theory, we believe that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency will promote employees\u2019 workplace marginalization perception, which will lead to employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. The workplace marginalization perception derives from the isolation and exclusion of others in the organization or team (Williams, 1997; Liu et al., 2012), which is one of the consequences of leaders dividing subordinates into \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders.\u201d The leader\u2013member exchange theory well explains this phenomenon. The existing research shows that \u201cinsiders\u201d enjoy more opportunities, resources and respect, which will make the employees in the circle reluctant to contact employees outside the circle (Odle, 2014), employees outside the circle are more likely to feel aggrieved (Cleyman et al., 2013), team conflict (Boies and Howell, 2006), and colleagues\u2019 distrust\n(Kim et al., 2010). This means that \u201coutsiders\u201d are more likely to feel excluded and isolated, that is, to gain the perception of workplace marginalization.\nOn the other hand, based on the resource conservation theory, when individuals confront resource loss, they will automatically generate defense mechanisms and show some negative behaviors (DeVente et al., 2003; Melamed et al., 2006). Being perceived as an \u201coutsider\u201d by leaders means that they will enjoy less support, opportunities, and resources in the future, which is typical of individual resource loss (Hobfoll and Shirom, 2001). Therefore, in the face of knowledge consultation and knowledge sharing requests from leaders and even colleagues, employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors will occur, thereby preventing further loss of resources and triggering defense mechanisms. Based on the above, the research rises the following hypotheses:\nH2: There is a positive correlation between the leaders\u2019 bias\ntendency and the workplace marginalization perception. H3: There is a positive correlation between the workplace\nmarginalization perception and the employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. H4: Workplace marginalization perception plays a mediating\nrole between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors.\nThe moderating role of emotional commitment to the organization\nLeaders\u2019 bias tendency and workplace marginalization perception are not a good workplace experience for employees (Williams et al., 2005). However, peoples\u2019 perceptions and reactions to leaders\u2019 bias tendency and workplace marginalization perception may be affected by employees\u2019 emotional commitment to the organization (Tsachouridi and Nikandrou, 2019). This study argues that, for employees, the emotional commitment to the organization will play a moderating role in their leaders\u2019 bias tendency on the employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors. Similarly, emotional commitment to the organization will also play a moderating role in the workplace marginalization perception on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nEmployees\u2019 emotional commitment to the organization is mainly affected by factors such as organizational goals, organizational climate, and cultural values (Meyer and Allen, 1991). Emotional commitment to the organization represents an employee\u2019s emotional attachment to the organization and the state of work engagement (Blomme et al., 2012). In the differential atmosphere of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency, employees who are excluded from the informal group of the leader will have a great sense of gap and workplace marginalization\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nperception. This is distressing and unacceptable for employees with low level of emotional commitment to the organization (Hobfoll and Shirom, 2001) because they have insufficient emotional attachment and loyalty to the organization itself. Therefore, it is difficult for employees with low level of emotional commitment to the organization to consider the interests of the organization and the development of the organization, and a certain defense mechanism will be developed against the leaders\u2019 bias tendency, forming negative behaviors such as employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Moreover, individuals with a high level of emotional commitment to the organization have a strong sense of attachment and loyalty to the organization, and they are more able to overcome the perceived pain of leaders\u2019 bias tendency and workplace marginalization perception so as to do things that are beneficial to the organization (Eisenberger et al., 1990; Riketta and Landerer, 2005). Therefore, individuals with a high level of emotional commitment to the organization will weaken the influence of leaders\u2019 bias tendency and the workplace marginalization perception on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. On the basis of the above, this study proposes the following hypotheses:\nH5: Emotional commitment to the organization plays a\nnegative moderating role between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors. H6: Emotional commitment to the organization plays\na negative moderating role between workplace marginalization perception and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior."

Hypothesis H6 is supported.\nSimple e ciency analysis and simple e ciency diagram\nTo analyze the negative moderating effects of high level of emotional commitment to the organization (M + 1 SD) and low level of emotional commitment to the organization (M \u2013 1 SD), this study used the process plugin of SPSS v.22.0 to conduct a simple efficiency analysis, and drew a simple efficiency diagram of the moderating effect. The results are presented in Figures 2, 3.\nAs can be seen from Figure 2, the emotional commitment to the organization negatively moderates the influence of leaders\u2019 bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior [\u03b2 = 0.130, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (0.069, 0.191), excluding 0]. When employees have the characteristics of high level of emotional commitment to the organization, the influence of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency on the employee\u2019s knowledge hiding behavior is \u03b2 = \u22120.182 (p < 0.01), the 95% confidence interval is (\u22120.266, \u22120.097), excluding 0; when employees have the characteristics of low level of emotional commitment to the organization, the impact of leaders\u2019 bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is \u03b2 = 0.442 (p < 0.001), and the 95% confidence interval is (0.358, 0.524), excluding 0. This supports Hypothesis H5.\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating role between workplace marginalization perception and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nIt can be seen from Figure 3 that emotional commitment to the organization negatively moderates the influence of workplace marginalization perception on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior [\u03b2 = 0.446, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (0.386, 0.507), excluding 0].

On the ground of\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nmultiple regression analysis and process analysis, this survey demonstrates that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency has an optimistic effect on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Derived from the leader\u2013member exchange theory and the resource conservation theory, we proposed a theoretical model of the behavior of leaders\u2019 bias tendency toward employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. The findings support our hypothesis that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency is foremostly and helpfully related to employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior through workplace marginalization perception, and emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating role. The results of the hypothesis test are shown in Table 6."

            "text": "The study has the following contributions: First, the study explores the influence of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior has a compulsory hindering effect on knowledge sharing and organizational innovation within an organization. Existing research has explored the grounds of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior, such as interpersonal doubt, psychological ownership of knowledge, employees\u2019 open personality, perception of organizational competitive climate, and sense of procedural fairness. However, the influence of the leadership type and leadership conduct on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior is ignored. This study demonstrates that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency positively affects employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. These studies strongly respond to the harm of negative leadership and the importance and value of avoiding these negative leadership behaviors.\nAnother contribution of the study is grounded on leader\u2013 member exchange theory and resource conservation theory, proving that workplace marginalization perception plays a significant part role between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior, thus clarifying leaders\u2019\nbias tendency to influence the mechanism of employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nFinally, the third contribution of this study is to combine the cultural and social factors to introduce emotional commitment to the organization as a moderator variable to adapt to the national conditions of China, where the study is located. The results of the study show that emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating part between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior; emotional commitment to the organization plays a negative moderating role between workplace marginalization perception and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior, thereby expanding employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior. Therefore, this study explains the methods to alleviate employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior from a new perspective, and enriches the research on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior.\nLimitations and recommendations for future research\nOur study has the following constraints: (1) Limited by the resources available to the researchers, the effective sample size of this study is 500, which is relatively small. Fortunately, the entire samples in this study passed the dependability test, and the discriminant obvious between variables was good. In the future, we should consider adding more partners to help us increase the sample size and make the results of this study more reliable. (2) All information in this study come from employee selfevaluation, not employee\u2013leader mutual evaluation. The reason for abandoning mutual evaluation is that the measured variable includes the leaders\u2019 bias tendency. Despite our commitment to the confidentiality of the research, many employees still reject leaders from directly participating in this research. To make up for the impact of the homologous method as much as possible, this study adopts the method of subsection survey, and the interval between the two surveys is 4months. On the other hand,\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nthe samples in this study also passed Harmer single factor test, which suggests that there is no grievous common method bias in this study."

            "text": "In fact, this study shows that the leaders\u2019 bias tendency is an important reason for employees to produce knowledge hiding behavior. Leaders\u2019 bias tendency are expensive for organizations (Chen et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020), because employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior usually represents a decrease in employees\u2019 aspirations to share knowledge and an increase in the cost of knowledge dissemination within the organization (Wang et al., 2020). Therefore, the leaders of the organization should show solicitude for the impact of this phenomenon on the organization, give subordinates a sense of procedural fairness, and face the emergence of biased behavior and the emergence of differential order patterns. On the other hand, formulating more reasonable promotion and elimination channels can also effectively restrain the negative effect of the leaders\u2019 bias tendency (Du and Wang, 2022).\nOn the basis of leader\u2013member exchange theory and resource conservation theory, this study also shows that workplace marginalization perception plays a mediating part between leaders\u2019 bias tendency and employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behaviors. Therefore, managers should consciously open the circulation channels of \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d to reduce employees\u2019 workplace marginalization perception due to biased tendencies and differential patterns, so as to improve employees\u2019 opinions self-efficacy and encourage employees to share knowledge (Chen, 2020).\nFinally, this study also shows that when employees\u2019 emotional commitment to the organization is high, the direct and profile effects of leaders\u2019 bias tendency and workplace marginalization perception on employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior are lower. Therefore, employees with high level of emotional commitment to the organization are less possible to exhibit knowledge hiding behaviors. Correspondingly, when employees\u2019 emotional commitment to the organization level is low, knowledge hiding behavior occurs more frequently. The emotional commitment to the organization of employees originates from the degree of recognition and maintenance of the organization in the employee\u2019s heart (Meyer, 2012). In China, traditional Confucian workplace values require\nemployees to show loyalty and love to the organization (Wang and Zhang, 2012), which will enhance the level of employees\u2019 emotional commitment to the organization. Therefore, organizational leaders should consider introducing traditional Confucian workplace values into organizational culture to alleviate employees\u2019 knowledge hiding behavior."
