    "abstractText": "Empirical studies suggest a deep intertwining between opinion formation and decision-making processes, but these have been treated as separate problems in the study of dynamical models for social networks. In this paper, we bridge the gap in the literature by proposing a novel coevolutionary model, in which each individual selects an action from a binary set and has an opinion on which action they prefer. Actions and opinions coevolve on a two-layer network. For homogeneous parameters, undirected networks, and under reasonable assumptions on the asynchronous updating mechanics, we prove that the coevolutionary dynamics is an ordinal potential game, enabling analysis via potential game theory. Specifically, we establish global convergence to the Nash equilibria of the game, proving that actions converge in a finite number of time steps, while opinions converge asymptotically. Next, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of, and convergence to, polarized equilibria, whereby the population splits into two communities, each selecting and supporting one of the actions. Finally, we use simulations to examine the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance.",

INTRODUCTION\nTHROUGHOUT the past decades, researchers in differentfields have used mathematical models to study different complex dynamical processes in social networks, such as opinion formation and collective decision making [1]\u2013[5]. Development and analysis of such models have helped to understand and predict how individual interactions can lead to complex collective behavior emerging in the wider social network [4], [6]\u2013[9].\nThe field of opinion dynamics studies models of the formation and evolution of opinions in groups of individuals,\nH.

Cao by the European Research Council (ERC-CoG-771687).\nwith roots in the 1950s (see [1], [10], [11] for a review). The seminal French-DeGroot model [12] established that, under mild network connectivity assumptions, the opinions of all individuals reach a common value (a consensus) due to social influence as captured by a weighted averaging procedure [12], [13]. Several generalizations of this model have been proposed. We mention the work by Friedkin and Johnsen [14], which posits that an individual\u2019s existing prejudices can lead to persistent disagreement, which has been extended and validated experimentally [3], [15].\nOn another research front, the study of collective decisionmaking in networks of interacting agents has gained popularity. In particular, mathematical models based on evolutionary game theory have been used to describe and predict how an individual decides on which action to take (e.g., a product to buy, or a social convention to adopt), choosing from a finite set of possibilities, and how these decisions are revised after interacting with other individuals [2], [9], [16], [17]. The study of these models, in particular those based on the paradigm of network coordination games and its extensions [16], has allowed to shed light on the emergent behavior of complex social system, including the evolution of social norms and conventions, and nontrivial interactions between heterogeneous types of agents [8], [18], and has paved the way for the design of intervention policies to control the network [19], [20].\nResults from the social psychology literature, including empirical evidence, indicate a strong relationship between the opinions held and decisions taken by individuals. These studies suggest that, within a community, the exchange of opinions can affect individuals\u2019 actions, while the way people form opinions can be influenced by observing the actions of others. For instance, teachers may decide to revise content delivery methods after forming opinions about which method is more effective [21], [22]. In another example, [23] showed that policymakers shifted their attitudes about work-oriented reforms when they observed the impact of these actions in other regions. See [24]\u2013[26] for more examples along these lines. Despite such a strong relationship, we also point out that actions and opinions are not always aligned in the realworld. A classic example is the phenomenon of unpopular norms [27]\u2013[29], in which a community keeps exhibiting a collective behavior that is disapproved by the most of its members. This is often caused by pluralistic ignorance (see, for instance, the study on alcohol abuse by undergraduates in Princeton University in the 1990s [30]). In summary, the mechanisms governing the evolution of actions and opinions in communities appear to be nontrivially intertwined. ar X iv :2\n20 6.\n07 24\n2v 2\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n2 6\nJu n\n20 23\nDespite evidence of such a complex intertwining, few existing mathematical frameworks are able to capture the coevolution of actions and opinions. Building on the seminal work by Martins [31], continuous-opinion discrete-action (CODA) models have been developed and studied [32]\u2013[34], and utilized to study real-world problems such as innovation diffusion [35] and competition in duopolies [36]. CODA models are able to reproduce certain interesting real-world phenomena, including polarization and oscillations [32], [33]. However, they rely on the simplifying assumptions that i) an individual\u2019s action is a direct quantization of their opinion, and ii) only actions are observable in the population. In neglecting more complex social psychological mechanisms that characterize human decision-making, CODA models are unable to capture important phenomena such as unpopular norms or pluralistic ignorance [27]\u2013[30]. Recently, models were proposed to consider coevolution of private and expressed opinions [37], [38], but no decision-making process is present. On the other hand, [27] proposes a decision-making process influenced by the opinions of individuals, which are however assumed to be time-invariant. Some preliminary efforts to model the coevolution of individuals\u2019 actions and opinions can be found in our works of [39], [40]. However, the complexity of the framework proposed in [39] hinders its analytical tractability, with findings mostly limited to numerical simulations.\nIn this paper, we fill in this gap by proposing a novel coevolutionary model in which individuals make decisions and revise their opinions by interacting on a two-layer network, whereby they observe others\u2019 actions on an influence layer and share their opinions on a communication layer. The proposed framework is formalized within a game-theoretic paradigm, and unifies the fields of opinion dynamics and collective decision making, by encompassing and generalizing the FrenchDeGroot [12], [13] and the Friedkin-Johnsen [3], [14] opinion dynamics models, and network coordination games [9], [16]\u2013[18]. Specifically, individuals simultaneously update their opinion and action, aiming to maximize a payoff function that consists of four terms, accounting for i) the individuals\u2019 tendency to coordinate with others\u2019 actions observed on the influence layer; ii) the opinion formation and exchange on the communication layer, iii) the (possible) presence of individuals\u2019 existing prejudices, and iv) the individuals\u2019 tendency to act consistently with their opinion, respectively. The first term comes from network coordination games [16], while the second and third come from the Friedkin-Johnsen model [14]. The fourth term, instead, couples an individual\u2019s action with their opinion, ensuring that an individual\u2019s decision-making and opinion formation processes are inherently intertwined in a nontrivial fashion as motivated in the above.\nWe perform a rigorous analysis of the proposed coevolutionary model leveraging potential game theory. Under the assumptions that each layer of the network is undirected and the agent parameters are homogeneous, we prove that the game defining the model is a generalized ordinal potential game [41]. Exploiting the corresponding potential function, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the longterm behavior of the coevolutionary dynamics, proving global convergence to the Nash equilibria of the coevolutionary game.\nIn particular, we prove that individuals\u2019 actions converge in finite time, while opinions converge asymptotically. Our approach follows the works in [42], [43], which interpreted opinion dynamics as best-response strategies to a game, but novel analysis was required as our state space is the Cartesian product of discrete (action) and continuous (opinion) sets. Our general convergence result significantly advances the limited existing theoretical analysis of coevolutionary models, that only considered the special scenario in which the opinion formation process is not affected by the decision-making one [39], [40].\nThen, we use our model to explore two real-world phenomena: polarization and pluralistic ignorance. Building on our general convergence result, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of and convergence to polarized equilibria, in which the network is divided into two groups supporting and taking opposite actions. Interestingly, polarization \u2014often observed in real-world social networks [44], [45]\u2014 occurs in our model without antagonistic interactions or strongly biased assimilation [46]\u2013[49] (which are not always realistic assumptions [50]), and without simplified quantized decisionmaking of CODA models [31]\u2013[33]. Finally, we explore the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance, which arises when some individuals in a community hold an incorrect assumption about the thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors of others in the population [51]. Via simulations, we show that our model is capable of qualitatively reproducing the classical empirical findings in [30].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We conclude this section with preliminaries including graph theory and game theory. Section II presents classic models of decisionmaking and opinion dynamics in a game-theoretic framework. Then, the coevolutionary model is presented in Section III, for which convergence results are provided in Section IV. Section V is devoted to the analysis of polarization and pluralistic ignorance phenomena. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper."

In the following, we will provide the definition of a generalized ordinal potential game [41], which will be used in the rest of this paper.\nDefinition 1: A game \u03b3 = (V,A,f) is called a generalized ordinal potential game if there exist a potential function \u03a6 : A \u2192 R such that for any pair of states z and z\u2032 that differs in a single component zi \u0338= zi\u2032 (i.e., the state of a single player),\n1A more general formulation, which is beyond the scope of this paper, may consider scenarios in which the strategy set can vary between players.\nthen, for all i \u2208 V , the following holds:\nfi(zi, z)\u2212 fi(z\u2032i, z) > 0 =\u21d2 \u03a6(z)\u2212 \u03a6(z\u2032) > 0. (1) Notice that in some game-theoretic literature, when referring to changes in the potential due to updates in the state of a player i, the potential function is written as a function of two arguments, that is, zi and a vector containing all the other entries of the state z. For the sake of readability, we decided to adopt a simpler notation.\nFinally, suppose that at each time step t \u2208 Z+, individual i has the opportunity to revise their state. In this paper, we will consider individuals using a well-known concept in game theory known as best-response updating to revise their state. Formally, we can define the set of best responses as follows.\nDefinition 2: Given a game \u03b3 = (V,A,f), the bestresponse strategies for player i \u2208 V given the state of the system x are defined as\nBi ( fi(\u00b7, z) ) := argmax\u03b6\u2208Afi(\u03b6,z). (2)\nNote that, in general, the best response is not unique, and multiple strategies might be contained in the set Bi ( fi(\u00b7, z) ) ."

This major body of empirical evidence suggests that decoupling the decision making and opinion formation and studying them one independently of the other may be an oversimplification, which restricts the range of behaviors that such models can reproduce and predict.\nSurprisingly, few efforts have explored this coupling via mathematical models except our two related works [39], [40], which explored a scenario in which the opinion formation and decision-making processes are indeed intertwined, but the two update rules are distinct rather than obtained from a single payoff function, and analytical results are limited to the scenario in which the former is not affected by the latter. In the following, instead, we will propose a coevolutionary framework, in which individuals simultaneously make decisions and revise their opinions, and we illustrate how important real-world collective population phenomena could arise from the coevolutionary framework, namely polarization and pluralistic ignorance."

This example clearly illustrates a scenario in which the action taken by an individual may strongly differ from their preference, due to social influence and pressure to conform expected norms.\nWe consider a setting in which individuals interact on a two-layer network G = (V, EA,A, EW ,W ), which we assume to be connected, and in which the two nonnegative weight matrices are row-stochastic.

The first term comes from network coordination games in Eq. (3), as discussed in detail in Section II-A. The second and third terms correspond to the opinion dynamics model in Eq. (6), discussed in detail in Section II-B. The fourth term is proportional to the squared difference between an individual\u2019s action and their opinion, which accounts for an individual\u2019s desire to resolve inconsistencies between their actions and opinions. This term, and the weighting parameters \u03bbi \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b2i \u2208 [0, 1], underline our proposed method for coupling the evolution of the decision-making and opinion dynamics processes. One will see this clearly in the sequel, when we present the best-response dynamics with respect to the payoff function in Eq. (7). The four terms are weighted by two parameters, \u03bbi and \u03b2i, representing the contribution of the actions and opinions in determining individual i\u2019s payoff, respectively. Specifically, every term of the payoff in Eq. (7) that contains action states (the first and the fourth) is multiplied by \u03bbi, while those terms that do not contain them are multiplied by 1 \u2212 \u03bbi; this is similarly implemented with the parameter \u03b2i for opinion states. All the model parameters are summarized in Table I.\nRemark 1: When \u03b2i = 0, then the payoff function in Eq. (7) reduces to the payoff function of a coordination game, previously discussed in Eq. (3); for \u03bbi = 0, it reduces to the one of the Friedkin-Johnsen model, previously discussed in Eq. (6). Finally, when \u03bbi = \u03b2i = 1, individual i is totally self-centered and closed to influence from other individuals.\nIn the sequel, we explore the payoff function fi and how it is used to define the coevolutionary model dynamics. For notational convenience, we will sometimes omit explicitly writing the state of the system z = (x,y) when there is no risk of confusion, and thus we use fi(\u03b6) to denote fi(\u03b6, z).\nBefore presenting the update rule of the coevolutionary dynamics, we will present a result on the maximizers of the\npayoff function in Eq. (7), which allows us to characterize the best-response strategies of the coevolutionary game \u03b3. Given a state of the system z and an individual i \u2208 V , let us define the discriminant quantity \u03b4i(z) as:\n\u03b4i(z) = 2\u03bbi\u03b2i(1\u2212 \u03bbi) [ (1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + \u03b3iui ] +\n(1\u2212 \u03b2i)\u03bbi 2 \u2211 j\u2208V aij [ 2xj + \u03b1(1 + xj) ] . (8)\nThe following two results characterize the best-response strategies for the payoff function in Eq. (7). For the sake of readability, the proofs are reported in Appendix A.\nProposition 1: For the coevolutionary game \u03b3 = (V,A,f) on the two-layer network G, with the ith entry of f defined in Eq. (7), and the function \u03b4i(z) defined in Eq. (8), consider a player i \u2208 V . Suppose also \u03bbi \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b2i \u2208 (0, 1]. If \u03b4i(z) \u0338= 0, then the best-response strategy Bi ( fi(\u00b7, z(t)) ) = (\u03b6a, \u03b6o), with\n\u03b6a = sgn(\u03b4i) (9a) \u03b6o = (1\u2212\u03bbi) [ (1\u2212\u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj+\u03b3iui ] +\u03bbisgn(\u03b4i) (9b)\nIf \u03b4i(z) = 0, then Bi ( fi(\u00b7, z(t)) ) = {(+1, \u03b6o), (\u22121, \u03b6\u0304o)}, with\n\u03b6o = (1\u2212 \u03bbi) [ (1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + \u03b3iui ] + \u03bbi (10a)\n\u03b6\u0304o = (1\u2212 \u03bbi) [ (1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + \u03b3iui ] \u2212 \u03bbi. (10b)\nNote that Proposition 1 illustrates how the coupling between opinions and actions due to the fourth term in Eq. (7) yields a nontrivial best-response strategy when the action and opinion are jointly revised. Importantly, the update rules for xi(t) and yi(t) cannot be decoupled, as they are intertwined by the quantity \u03b4i(z), which depends both on opinions and actions. We also point out that, although the best-response expression in Proposition 1 looks complex, the expression comes from two separate processes well established in the literature (network coordination games and Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics) being coupled together by a term that, intuitively, suggests an individual has a desire to resolve discrepancies between their action and opinion.\nRemark 2: In general, the best-response strategy might not be unique. A trivial scenario is the limit case \u03b2i = 0, in which opinions do not influence the payoff and Eq. (7) reduces to Eq. (3), and every \u03b6o \u2208 [\u22121, 1] provides the same payoff. More interestingly, for \u03b2i \u0338= 0, the payoff function fi has two maximizers when \u03b4i = 0: one with positive action \u03b6a = +1 and one with negative action \u03b6a = \u22121. In the sequel, we make a simple assumption on how the individuals resolve the issue of multiple maximizers."

In the next section when we present the main convergence result of this paper, we provide an explicit assumption on how individuals are selected to activate at each time step. However, our model is general to allow convergence analysis of z(t) under different assumptions on agent activation sequences, and so no explicit assumption is imposed in this section, where we simply focus on presentation of the individual dynamics.\nIf individual i \u2208 V becomes active at time t, then they revises their state zi(t) according to a best-response update, that is,\nzi(t+ 1) \u2208 Bi ( fi(\u00b7, z(t)) ) (11)\nwhere Bi is the best-response strategies defined in Eq.

As we have observed in Remark 2, in general, the best response might not be unique, and in such scenarios, we should select a tie-break rule to unequivocally determine the system evolution. Proposition 1 gives explicit expressions for the best-response strategies for the payoff function fi, which allows us to write explicit expressions for Eq. (11), and resolve ties (which occur if \u03b4i = 0).\nIn particular, we make explicit the best-response update rule of the coevolutionary dynamics as follows. For active individual i with \u03b2i \u2208 (0, 1], the state is updated as xi(t+ 1) = S(\u03b4i(z(t)) (12) yi(t+ 1) = (1\u2212 \u03bbi) [ (1\u2212 \u03b3i)\n\u2211 j\u2208V wijyj(t) + \u03b3iui ] + \u03bbiS(\u03b4i)\n(13)\nwhere\nS(\u03b4i(z(t))) =  +1 if \u03b4i(z(t)) > 0 \u22121 if \u03b4i(z(t)) < 0 xi(t) if \u03b4i(z(t)) = 0.\n(14)\nThe above update rule resolves the tie in which both actions \u22121 and +1 give the same payoff. Specifically, we have adopted a conservative method for resolving ties, enforcing an agent to stick with the current action when both possible actions give equal reward, consistent with the social psychology literature on the presence of inertia in decision-making and status-quo bias [56]. Finally, if \u03b2i = 0, following a similar approach, we set that yi(t + 1) = yi(t), which translates to yi(t) = yi(0) for all t \u2265 0, while xi(t+ 1) is given in Eq. (12).\nTo summarize, the proposed coevolutionary model is formulated as a best-response dynamics for the coevolutionary game \u03b3 = (V,A,f) on a two-layer network G, with a twodimensional set of strategies A = {\u22121,+1} \u00d7 [\u22121,+1], and the payoff vector is defined with its ith entry in Eq.

To keep the exposition clear, the proofs for each theorem, lemma or corollary are presented in the Appendix.\nIn Section III, we presented our coevolutionary model in a game-theoretic framework, casting the update mechanism as a best-response dynamics to the payoff function Eq.

To begin, we introduce the following function and establish two associated technical results that prove the function is in fact a potential function for the coevolutionary game:\n\u03a6(z) = \u2211 i\u2208V \u2211 j\u2208V\\{i} \u03b7i aij 2 [ (1 + \u03b1)(1 + xj)(1 + xi)\n+ (1\u2212 xi)(1\u2212 xj) ]\n\u2212 1 2 \u2211 i\u2208V \u2211 j\u2208V wij 2 (yi \u2212 yj)2 \u2212 1 2 \u2211 k\u2208V \u03b3i (1\u2212 \u03b3i) (yk \u2212 uk)2\n\u2212 1 2 \u2211 k\u2208V \u03bbi (1\u2212 \u03bbi)(1\u2212 \u03b3i) (yk \u2212 xk)2 (15)\nwhere \u03b7i = \u03bbi(1\u2212 \u03b2i)/4\u03b2i(1\u2212 \u03bbi)(1\u2212 \u03b3i). The following lemma, whose proof is reported in Appendix B, connects the potential function to the payoff function in Eq. (7) under an assumption on the parameters.\nAssumption 1: Suppose that all the parameters are homogeneous, i.e., \u03bbi = \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b3i = \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1), and \u03b2i = \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1) for all i \u2208 V . Suppose further that the two layers are undirected, that is, W = W\u22a4, and A = A\u22a4, and that each individual has a self-loop on the influence layer, that is, aii > 0 for all i \u2208 V .\nLemma 1: Under Assumption 1, the coevolutionary game \u03b3 = (V,A,f) on the two-layer network G is a generalized ordinal potential game with potential function \u03a6, defined in Eq. (15).\nNext, we provide an explicit lower bound on the increase in the potential function if an agent that activates changes action according to the coevolutionary dynamics in Eqs. (12) and (13). Its proof is reported in Appendix B\nCorollary 1: Consider the coevolutionary model on the two-layer network G in which individuals update their actions and opinions according to Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), respectively. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. If agent i \u2208 V is active at time t, and xi(t) \u0338= xi(t+ 1), then\n\u03a6(z(t+ 1))\u2212 \u03a6(z(t)) > min k\u2208V \u03be\u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b2)akk > 0 (16)\nwhere \u03be = [\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3)]\u22121 > 0. In Section III-C, we detailed the general model dynamics, whereby a single agent i \u2208 V activates at each discrete time t \u2208 Z+ to update their state zi(t) = (xi(t), yi(t)). However, there can be a number of different mechanisms governing the sequence of agent activations. In our work, we secure a general convergence result by assuming a particular mechanism, as we now detail.\nAssumption 2: There exists a T \u2208 Z+ such that in every time window [t; t+ T ), \u2200t \u2208 Z+, each agent i \u2208 V activates at least once3.\nThis assumption ensures that every agent will activate at least once in T time steps. It covers a broad range of scenarios, since T can be much greater than n (allowing agents to update multiple times inside of T time steps), and imposes no restriction or requirement on the ordering of the agent activations. Other assumptions on the activation sequence can be considered, which may lead to different convergence results. For instance, one could assume that at every time step, every agent has a positive probability of becoming active, or that every agent activates infinitely often as t \u2192 \u221e [2].\nAlthough we proved in Lemma 1 that the coevolutionary game is a generalized ordinal potential game, we cannot exploit existing convergence results on potential games such as those detailed in [41]. This is because in our game, the strategy space for each player (individual) is a Cartesian product of a finite strategy set (actions) and a continuous strategy set (opinions), and as noted below Proposition 1, the action and opinion updating dynamics cannot be decoupled. Significant additional analysis is therefore required. We first present a convergence result for the opinion vector under the assumption that the action vector is fixed, which is key for the proof of our main convergence result, reported in the following. For the sake of readability, the proof is postponed to Appendix C.\nLemma 2: Consider a modified coevolutionary model on the two-layer network G, where individuals update their opinions according to Eq. (13) while the actions are held constant, xi(t + 1) = xi(t) = x \u2217 i for all t \u2265 0, and let action vector be denoted by x\u2217 \u2208 {\u22121,+1}n, Then, under Assumption 1, there is a unique opinion vector y\u2217 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]n that is the unique equilibrium of the opinion dynamics in Eq. (13). Further, if Assumption 2 also holds, then limt\u2192\u221e yi(t) = y\u2217i asymptotically.\nFinally, we are ready to present the main convergence result of our paper, whose proof is reported in Appendix D. This result establishes that for all initial conditions, the system converges to a steady state.\nTheorem 1: Consider a coevolutionary model on the twolayer network G in which individuals update their opinions and actions according to Eq. (13) and Eq. (12), respectively. Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then, for all initial conditions z(0) \u2208 {\u22121,+1}n \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]n, the state of the system z(t) converges to a steady state z\u2217. Specifically, the action vector x(t) converges to x\u2217 in finite time, while the opinion vector y(t) converges to y\u2217 asymptotically.\nThus, the key conclusion on the dynamics of the coevolutionary model is that under Assumption 1 on the parameters, and Assumption 2 on the activation mechanism for the agents, the actions and opinions of all individuals converge to an equilibrium z\u2217 = (x\u2217,y\u2217), for all initial conditions. Moreover, z\u2217 is a Nash equilibrium of the coevolutionary game. However, there are generally speaking a number of different Nash\n3Note this implies T \u2265 n.\nequilibria which the system can converge to, and it is difficult to provide insight into regions of attraction for the equilibria due to the highly nonlinear dynamics (although Lemma 2 indicates that for a given action equilibrium x\u2217, the opinion equilibrium y\u2217 is unique). In fact, Assumption 2 places little restriction on the agent activation sequence, and thus for the same z(0), it is possible to converge to two different Nash equilibria z\u0302\u2217 and z\u0304\u2217, for different agent activation sequences. In the next section, we provide a region of attraction for a specific type of equilibrium, under further conditions.\nBefore concluding this section, we would like to stress that the fundamental properties detailed in Lemma 1 and Corollary 1, which are key for the convergence analysis, are structural properties of the coevolutionary dynamics and are independent of the activation mechanism. This suggests that future work may consider convergence analysis under different assumptions on the activation mechanism."

            "text": "Here, we investigate how the model may lead to the emergence of stable polarized states, in which a portion of the population opts for and supports one action, and the rest of the population takes and supports the other one. Given the set of agents V , we denote by (Vp,Vn) a partitioning of the agents into two disjoint sets Vp and Vn satisfying Vp\n\u22c2Vn = \u2205, Vp\n\u22c3Vn = V and Vp \u0338= \u2205 and Vn \u0338= \u2205. With this notion of a partition in place, we introduce the following definitions of polarization in the network.\nDefinition 3: Given a state of the system z = (x,y) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]n, we say that\n\u2022 the action vector x is polarized if there exists a partition of the agents (Vp, Vn) such that xi = \u22121, for all i \u2208 Vn and xj = +1, for all j \u2208 Vp. \u2022 the opinion vector y is polarized if there exists a partition of the agents (Vp, Vn) such that yi < 0, for all i \u2208 Vn and yj > 0, for all j \u2208 Vp.\n\u2022 the state z is polarized if there exists a partition of the agents (Vp, Vn) such that xi = \u22121 and yi < 0, for all i \u2208 Vn, and xj = 1 and yj > 0, for all j \u2208 Vp. \u2022 the state z\u2217 is a polarized equilibrium if it is a polarized state, and it is an equilibrium of the coevolutionary model in Eqs. (13)\u2013(12).\nBriefly, a state is polarized if the population is split into two clusters, where individuals in the same cluster have the same action, but different actions between different clusters. While the opinions of individuals within the same cluster have the same sign, the opinions are not necessarily of the same magnitude (and yi does not have to be equal to +1 or \u22121).\nIn the following, we study the polarization problem under the simplifying assumptions that i) the communication layer and the influence layer coincide, ii) no action has a payoff advantage, and iii) agents are not attached to any existing prejudice. These assumptions are gathered in the following.\nAssumption 3: We assume that A = W , \u03b1 = 0, and \u03b3 = 0.\nUnder Assumption 3, the opinion and action updates rules are simplified as follows{\nyi(t+ 1) = (1\u2212 \u03bb) \u2211\nj\u2208V wijyj(t) + \u03bbS(\u03b4i(z(t))\nxi(t+ 1) = S(\u03b4i(z(t))) (17)\nwhere \u03b4i(z) = 2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + (1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03bb \u2211 j\u2208V wijxj . (18)\nThe following result provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a polarized equilibrium, with the proof in Appendix E.\nTheorem 2: Consider the coevolutionary model on the twolayer network G under Assumptions 1\u20133, in which individuals update their opinions and actions according to Eq. (17). Suppose there exists a partitioning of the agents (Vp,Vn) with\ndp := min i\u2208Vp \u2211 j\u2208Vp wij d\u0304p := max i\u2208Vp \u2211 j\u2208Vp wij\ndn := min i\u2208Vn \u2211 j\u2208Vn wij d\u0304n := max i\u2208Vn \u2211 j\u2208Vn wij (19)\nsuch that the following three conditions are verified:\n\u03bb > max\n( d\u0304p \u2212 dn\n1 + d\u0304p \u2212 dn , d\u0304n \u2212 dp 1 + d\u0304n \u2212 dp\n) (20)\n\u03bb(dp + d\u0304n \u2212 1) + dp \u2212 d\u0304n 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(dp + d\u0304n \u2212 1) + (1\u2212 \u03b2)(2dp \u2212 1) 2\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb) > 0 (21)\nand\n\u03bb(dn + d\u0304p \u2212 1) + dn \u2212 d\u0304p 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(dn + d\u0304p \u2212 1) + (1\u2212 \u03b2)(2dn \u2212 1) 2\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb) > 0. (22)\nThen the coevolutionary model in Eq. (17) has a polarized equilibrium z\u2217 with respect to the partitioning (Vp,Vn).\nTheorem 2 indicates that a polarized equilibrium z\u2217 exists with respect to a partitioning (Vp,Vn) if the three conditions of Eqs. (20)\u2013(22) are satisfied. While the latter two conditions are not easy to digest, all three conditions can be easily computed. However, the result provides no indication of the basin of\nattraction for z\u2217. Next, we provide a more conservative sufficient condition, which however allows to prove not only the existence of a polarized equilibrium but also a notion a region of attraction from a set of initial conditions. The proof is reported in Appendix F.\nTheorem 3: Consider a coevolutionary model on the twolayer network G under Assumptions 1\u20133, in which individuals update their opinions and actions according to Eq. (17). Assume that there exists a partitioning of the agents (Vp, Vn) such that \u2211 j\u2208Vp wij > max ( 1\u22122\u03bb 1\u2212\u03bb , 1 2 ( 1 + \u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)1\u2212\u03b2\u03bb )) , for i \u2208 Vp\u2211 j\u2208Vn wij > max ( 1\u22122\u03bb 1\u2212\u03bb , 1 2 ( 1 + \u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)1\u2212\u03b2\u03bb )) , for i \u2208 Vn. (23) Then, if the initial condition z(0) is a polarized state, z(t) will be polarized for any t \u2208 Z+, and limt\u2192\u221e z(t) = z\u2217, where z\u2217 is the polarized equilibrium with respect to the partition (Vp,Vn).\nTheorem 3 provides easier to check conditions, viz. Eq. (23), for the existence of a polarized equilibrium z\u2217. Moreover, under these conditions, a large region of attraction for z\u2217 is identified, being the set of initial conditions z(0) which is polarized with respect to the partition (Vp,Vn). From another perspective, the set of polarized states with respect to (Vp,Vn) is a positive invariant set of the system dynamics. Eq. (23) provides insight into the role of the model parameters on the emergence of polarized equilibria. In fact, we observe that the conditions become monotonically stricter as \u03bb decreases and \u03b2 increases. This seems to suggest that polarization emerges more easily in scenarios in which individuals give higher weight to observed actions rather than shared opinions.\nThis result demonstrates that polarization can emerge and become stable in a population where opinions and actions coevolve. Such a finding is notable, since in the opinion dynamics literature, polarization has been typically attributed to antagonistic interactions under restrictive signed network structure assumptions [46], [47] or strong biased assimilation [48], [49]. Here, we show that when an individual\u2019s opinion coevolves with their action, polarization can emerge purely through coordination and social influence, similar to observations from other models with opinions and quantized actions [31]\u2013[33]. In the following example, we show via simulation results that the behavior proved in Theorem 3 seems to be resistant to small perturbations of the network and that the region of attraction of polarized equilibria may be larger, whereby polarization can emerge even from nonpolarized initial states.\nExample 1: We consider 20 interacting individuals divided into two groups Vp = {1, . . . , 10} and Vn = {11, . . . , 20}. Groups are generated as directed Erdo\u030bs\u2013Re\u0301nyi random graphs [53], where each link is present with probability p = 0.2, independent of the other edges. Then, the two groups are connected by two links between two pairs of nodes (one from each group), selected uniformly at random. Last, weights are selected randomly from a uniform distribution and rescaled such that the overall influence matrix is row-\nstochastic. The network obtained is presented in Fig. 3. We set \u03b1 = \u03b3 = 0, \u03b2 = 0.5, and \u03bb = 0.6. With these parameters, the inequality conditions in Theorem 3 are satisfied. However, Assumption 1 is not satisfied, since selfloops are not present for all the nodes. Furthermore, we initialize the system with z(0), where most of the nodes in Vp have xi(0) = sgn(yi(0)) = +1 and most of the nodes in Vn have xi(0) = sgn(yi(0)) = \u22121. However, we randomly assign some exceptions to this rule, so that the initial state z(0) is not polarized, as shown in Fig. 3a. We simulate the system by selecting one agent uniformly at random at each time step to activate and update their states, checking that all agents activate at least once during the simulation.\nWhile the initial state z(0) is outside the region of attraction identified in Theorem 3, the numerical simulation reported in Fig. 3 shows that the coevolutionary model still converges to the polarized equilibrium with respect to (Vp,Vn). This suggests the region of attraction for polarized equilibria may be larger than that identified in our theoretical findings.\nWe conclude this section by presenting a special case in which all the agents have a uniform influence at the partitionlevel, that is, there exists a partition (Vp,Vn) such that\u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij = d, \u2200 i \u2208 Vp \u2211 j\u2208Vn wij = d, \u2200 i \u2208 Vn. (24)\nIn this scenario, a complete characterization of the polarized equilibrium can be performed, showing the emergence of a bipartite consensus state, in which all the agents in the same partition have the same opinion. The proof is in Appendix G.\nCorollary 2: Consider a coevolutionary model on the twolayer network G under Assumptions 1\u20133, in which individuals update their opinions and actions according to Eq. (17). Suppose that there exists a partition (Vp,Vn) such that Eq. (24) holds true for some d > 1/2. Then there exists a polarized equilibrium in the form\ny\u2217i = y + ,\u2200 i \u2208 Vp y\u2217j = y\u2212 ,\u2200 j \u2208 Vn, (25)\nwith\ny+ = \u03bb 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(2d\u2212 1) y \u2212 = \u2212 \u03bb\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(2d\u2212 1) .

            "heading": "B. Pluralistic Ignorance",
            "text": "Here, we explore how the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance [51] can be observed as an emergent behavior in our model. Pluralistic ignorance refers to a situation whereby a significant number of individuals in a population hold an incorrect assumption about the thoughts, feelings, or opinions of other members. The most common such situation is when a group of individuals underestimates the number of others who hold similar opinions. Such a phenomenon has been widely studied in the literature, with empirical examples concerning overestimation of support among white Americans for racial segregation in 1960s America [57], or underestimation of the rejection of alcohol consumption practices on university campuses in the 1990s [30].\nIn particular, we revisit the classical work of Prentice and Miller [30], which reported field studies on the opinions and behaviors of undergraduate students at Princeton University concerning the culture of rampant alcohol consumption. In [30], the authors studied how individuals internalized social norms when exposed to pluralistic ignorance over time. They surveyed via telephone a random sample of 25 female and 25 male sophomore students on Princeton campus, first in September at the beginning of the semester year, and then again in December. The subjects were asked several questions about Princeton\u2019s alcohol policies, their own opinion toward drinking alcohol, and their estimate of the average student\u2019s attitude. The students ranked their own comfort level and their estimate of the average student\u2019s comfort level with alcohol drinking, using a number between 0 and 10.\nIn the following example, we show that with reasonable choices of parameters, our model can qualitatively reproduce the empirical data reported in the study described above.\nExample 2: In order to apply our model to the work of Prentice and Miller [30], we let y = [y\u22a4f ,y \u22a4 m]\n\u22a4, where yf ,ym \u2208 [\u22121, 1]25 are the vectors of attitudes (opinions) of female and male subjects, respectively. In addition, we define x = [x\u22a4f ,x \u22a4 m]\n\u22a4, where xf ,xm \u2208 {\u22121, 1}25 represent the vectors of behavior (actions) of female and male students, respectively. The mean value of x, denoted by x\u0304, is a reasonable choice to represent the \u201csocial norm\u201d, as it measures the average behavior of the society.\nThe initial states are reproduced randomly using a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation values reported in [30, Study 3]. Then, the initial state values are\nrescaled to fit the state space of our model: xi = \u22121 and xi = +1 represent the rejection and embracing of heavy alcohol consumption by agent i, respectively. Consistent with our model definition, yi is individual i\u2019s preference towards the choices of rejecting or supporting alcohol consumption. In addition, we set u = y(0).\nPrentice and Miller discuss that \u201cmen are simply more inclined to react to feeling deviant from the norm with conformity\u201d [30]. In our model, this can be reasonably interpreted as \u03bbm > \u03bbf , since a larger \u03bb means that observed actions have a great impact on the payoff. In context, male individuals strongly favor adopting the action currently in the majority (the social norm), and in their opinion update they place more weight on their own action, which is influenced by the social norm. On the other hand, [30] also states that \u201cmen might be expected to feel greater pressures to learn to be comfortable with alcohol\u201d. In our setting, this can be approached by adjusting \u03b3m < \u03b3f . As u = y(0), \u03b3m < \u03b3f implies that male subjects tend to be less attached to their initial opinion.\nConsidering the observations above, we set \u03b1 = 0, \u03bbf = 0.2, \u03bbm = 0.6, \u03b2f = \u03b2m = 0.4, \u03b3f = 0.8, and \u03b3m = 0.3. In addition, we generate a two-layer graph with uniformly random weights to represent the student network; both layers are Erdo\u030bs\u2013Re\u0301nyi random graphs, with each link present with probability p. We assume the influence layer denser relative to the communication layer by setting p = 0.1 and p = 0.04, respectively. This reflects that opinions are mostly private and shared between few friends, while actions are public and observed within the whole campus environment.\nFigure 4 plots the temporal evolution of the mean values of yf , ym, xf , and xm. According to [30], at the start of their experiment in September, it was found that both male and female students displayed strong pluralistic ignorance, whereby the majority of students were privately against the social norm of heavy alcohol consumption, but estimated that their peers preferred heavy alcohol consumption, and all individuals consumed alcohol to a greater degree than they were comfortable with. In our simulation, we initialize individuals\u2019 opinions and behaviors with the same discrepancy.\nPrentice and Miller reported that by December when they interviewed the participants again, male participants had tended to resolve pluralistic ignorance over time by internalization of the social norm, moving their private attitudes to conform to strong drinking culture. In contrast, female\nparticipants reacted with alienation by mostly retaining their private beliefs, but continuing to participate in the social norm of heavy alcohol consumption [30].\nOur simulation is qualitatively similar to the outcomes described by Prentice and Miller. In the simulation, the male agents tend to internalize the social norm, x\u0304, by moving their opinions, viz. y\u0304m to be closer to the social norm. On the other hand, female agents remain attached to their initial opinion, and their opinion, viz. y\u0304f remains significantly less supportive of heavy alcohol consumption. Additional simulations, omitted due to space constraints, confirm that our findings are robust to small changes to the values of the model parameters, and even heterogeneity among parameters."

            "text": "In this paper, we proposed a novel coevolutionary model of actions and opinions that captures the complex interplay between opinion formation and decision-making processes in a social network, utilizing a game-theoretic framework. We provided a rigorous analysis of the model, establishing finitetime convergence of the actions and asymptotic convergence for the opinions, for any initial condition. Then, we utilized the coevolutionary model to explore various real-world phenomena. Besides the emergence of unpopular norms, which were studied on a simplified version of the model [39], [40], the proposed model can represent stable polarization and the emergence of pluralistic ignorance.\nThe vast range of real-world phenomena that our model can represent and its amenability to perform rigorous analytical studies pave the way for a wide horizon of future research. First, our convergence result is limited to homogeneous scenarios, and it should be generalized to heterogeneous populations, as a key step toward studying real-world complex social systems which may have high degrees of heterogeneity [53]. Second, our simulations suggest polarization can emerge due to the coordination and social influence mechanisms, even from nonpolarized initial states. Further analytical study of the polarization phenomenon is needed to provide theoretical support to our simulation findings. Importantly, novel mathematical tools should be developed in order to study stability properties of the polarized equilibria, possibly inspired by the methods proposed in [40]. Third, effort should be placed to provide a general characterization of the Nash equilibria of the system (besides polarized equilibria) and, if multiple stable equilibria are present, to understand how the network topology and the model parameters affect their basins of attraction. Fourth, several other complex social phenomena might be tackled using our flexible model framework, from diffusion of innovation [9], [17], [35] to the adoption of social conventions and behaviors [8], [55]. Finally, our model relies on the assumption that individuals make decisions by optimizing a payoff function. Besides being grounded in the social psychology literature and in existing models for decision-making and opinion dynamics, the complexity of the payoff function calls for a validation of the proposed model against empirical data, similar to [58]. This, together with the development of techniques to calibrate its parameters will be crucial to enable its practical use in real-world problems.\nAPPENDIX"

Computing the derivative of fi(+1, \u03b6o) with respect to \u03b6o, we obtain\nf \u2032i(+1, \u03b6o) =\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bbi)\u03b2i(1\u2212 \u03b3i)\u03b6o \u2211\nj\u2208V wij + (1\u2212 \u03bbi)\u03b2i(1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211\nj\u2208V wijyj\n\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bbi)\u03b2i\u03b3i(\u03b6o \u2212 ui)\u2212 \u03bbi\u03b2i(\u03b6o \u2212 1).\n(27)\nThe second derivative of fi(+1, \u03b6o) with respect to \u03b6o is f \u2032\u2032i (+1, \u03b6o) = \u2212\u03b2i < 0, which implies that fi(+1, s) is strictly concave, and hence has a unique maximum. By using Fermat\u2019s (interior extremum) theorem, we solve f \u2032i(+1, \u03b6o) = 0 and obtain the following maximizer:\n\u03b6+o = (1\u2212 \u03bbi)(1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + (1\u2212 \u03bbi)\u03b3iui + \u03bbi.

Since \u03bbi \u2208 [0, 1], \u03b3i \u2208 [0, 1], and W is stochastic, we have that \u03b6o in Eq.

Let \u03b6\u2212o be the maximizer of Eq. (7) subject to \u03b6a = \u22121. Similar to the above, we differentiate fi(\u22121, \u03b6o) with respect \u03b6o, and by solving f \u2032i(\u22121, \u03b6o) = 0 for \u03b6o, we obtain\n\u03b6\u2212o = (1\u2212 \u03bbi)(1\u2212 \u03b3i) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj + (1\u2212 \u03bbi)\u03b3iui \u2212 \u03bbi (29)\nwhich can be shown to belong to the domain \u03b6\u2212o \u2208 [\u22121,+1], similar to \u03b6+o .\nNow, we are left with comparing the two maxima.

(13) that any equilibrium y\u2217 must have entries y\u2217i such that\ny\u2217i = (1\u2212 \u03bb) [ (1\u2212 \u03b3) \u2211 j\u2208V wijy \u2217 j + \u03b3ui ] + \u03bbx\u2217i (39)\nor in vector form y\u2217 = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)[(1 \u2212 \u03b3)Wy\u2217 + \u03b3u] + \u03bbx\u2217, where u = [u1, . . . , un]\u22a4. Rearranging for y\u2217 yields [I \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 \u03b3)W ]y\u2217 = (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3u + \u03bbx\u2217. Since W is stochastic and irreducible, the Perron\u2013Frobenius Theorem [59] establishes that W has a simple eigenvalue equal to 1, with all other eigenvalues having modulus no greater than 1. It follows that the spectral radius of (1\u2212\u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3)W is strictly less than 1, and thus I\u2212 (1\u2212\u03bb)(1\u2212\u03b3)W is invertible. Thus, y\u2217 = [I \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3)W ]\u22121[(1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3u+ \u03bbx\u2217] is unique.\nNext, we prove convergence to y\u2217, given the fixed action vector x\u2217. Using a compact vector form, we verify that the potential function \u03a6(z) can be expressed in quadratic form as\n\u03a6(z) = \u22121 2\n( y\u22a4(I \u2212W +L+G)y \u2212 2y\u22a4Gu\u2212 2y\u22a4Lx\u2217\n+ (x\u2217)\u22a4Lx\u2217 + u\u22a4Gu ) + F(x\u2217) (40)\nwhere L = \u03bb(1\u2212\u03bb)(1\u2212\u03b3)I , G = \u03b3 (1\u2212\u03b3)I , and\nF(x\u2217) = \u2211 i\u2208V \u2211 j \u0338=i \u03b7 aij 2 [ (1+\u03b1)(1+x\u2217j )(1+x \u2217 i )+(1\u2212x \u2217 i )(1\u2212x \u2217 j ) ] .\nAccording to [59], (I \u2212W +L+G) is positive definite for any \u03bb \u0338= 0 and \u03b3 \u0338= 0 (c.f. Chapter 6, and the definition of M -matrices). Therefore, \u03a6(z) = \u03a6([x,y]) is continuous in y, and, for fixed x = x\u2217, bounded from above and from below, i.e., \u03a6 \u2264 \u03a6([x\u2217,y]) \u2264 \u03a6\u0304, where \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 represent the value of \u03a6([x,y]) at the global maximum and global minimum with respect to y, constrained to x = x\u2217, respectively.\nIn Lemma 1, we proved that the coevolutionary game is a generalized ordinal potential game with potential function \u03a6. For convenience, denote \u03a6(t) := \u03a6(z(t)) = \u03a6([x\u2217,y(t)]). By using z = z(t + 1) and z\u2032 = z(t) in Eq. (1), it follows that under the best-response update in Eq. (11), there holds \u03a6(t+1)\u2212\u03a6(t) > 0 if agent i is active at time t and yi(t+1) \u0338= yi(t). It follows from Assumption 2 that \u03a6(t+T )\u2212\u03a6(t) \u2265 0 for all t \u2265 0 with equality if and only if y(t+ T ) = y(t). In other words, \u03a6(t) must strictly increase over any time window\nof period T unless yi(t + T ) = yi(t) for all i \u2208 V . This is because every agent activates at least once inside the time window, and thus either at least one agent i changes its opinion yi(t + T ) \u0338= yi(t) or every agent has an unchanged opinion over that time window. In the latter case, clearly the opinions have reached an equilibrium, and the results above establish there is a unique equilibrium vector y\u2217.\nThis implies that the sequence \u03a6t \u225c {\u03a6(t)}\u221et=0 is monotonically increasing across every time period T , and as we established earlier, it is bounded from above by the unique global maximum \u03a6\u0304. It follows from the monotone convergence theorem for sequences, that \u03a6t converges asymptotically to \u03a6\u0304, and hence limt\u2192\u221e y(t) = y\u2217 asymptotically."

            "heading": "D. Proof of Theorem 1",
            "text": "The proof centers around the potential function defined in Eq. (15), and its properties established in Lemma 1 and Corollary 1. We establish convergence by focusing on proving that actions must converge to a steady state x\u2217 in a finite number of time steps. Letting \u03c4 denote the time step for which the action has converged, that is, x(t + 1) = x(t) = x\u2217 for all t \u2265 \u03c4 , convergence of the opinion vector y(t) follows immediately from Lemma 2.\nNote that \u03a6(z) is bounded from above and from below, and let us denote the maximum and minimum value of \u03a6(z) by \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6, respectively. With an abuse of notation, we write the potential function as an explicit function of the time, that is \u03a6(t) = \u03a6(z(t)). Assume without loss of generality that node i \u2208 V is active at time t. Then, z(t+1) may differ from z(t) only in the ith row. Now, if individual i chooses to change their action, i.e. xi(t+ 1) \u0338= xi(t), then we know from Eq. (16) in Corollary 1 that the difference in potential is bounded from below by a positive constant, i.e., \u03a6(t+ 1)\u2212 \u03a6(t) > c > 0.\nRecall from Assumption 2, that every individual will activate at least once in every time window [t; t + T ), t \u2208 Z+. Thus, there can be at most \u230a \u03a6\u0304\u2212\u03a6c \u230b time instants where the active agent i has xi(t + 1) \u0338= xi(t) for t < T\u0304 for some T\u0304 \u2208 {Z+\u222a\u221e}. If T\u0304 is finite, then convergence to a maximum of \u03a6 (though not necessarily the global maximum) must occur and consequently x(t) converges to some x\u2217 associated with the maximum in finite time, before T\u0304 .\nIf T\u0304 = \u221e on the other hand, this would imply that there exist an infinitely long sequence of agent activations in which xi(t + 1) = xi(t) for every active agent i, during which the opinions converge asymptotically to some steady state vector y\u2217 as detailed in Lemma 2, and then there exists an agent j such that limt\u2192\u221e xj(t + 1) \u0338= xj(t). That is, an agent chooses to change their action after a long time period in which no action has changed, while the opinions have reached to a neighborhood of the opinion equilibrium. We are now going to show such an infinitely long sequence cannot exist, by showing that if there is a sufficiently long but finite sequence with no action change, then it is not possible for any future action change for any agent after this sequence.\nTo establish the contradiction, suppose that there is a finite sequence of agent activations with no change in the actions, except agent i who activates at the end of this sequence and\nchanges action. Let t2 be the time step at end of this sequence, and let t1, with t1 < t2, be the supremum time step inside this sequence at which agent i was last active before t2. Without loss of generality, assume xi(t1) = xi(t1 + 1) = \u22121 which implies xi(t2 + 1) = +1 \u0338= xi(t2) = xi(t1 + 1) = \u22121. Now, Eq. (14) implies that \u03b4i(z(t1)) \u2264 0 while \u03b4i(z(t2)) > 0. We are going to show that \u03b4i(z(t2)) being positive creates a contradiction.\nFirst, we consider the case \u03b4i(z(t1)) = 0, which implies 2\u03bb\u03b2 [ (1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3) \u2211 j\u2208V wijyj(t1) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3ui ]\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03bb\n2\n\u2211 j\u2208V aij [ 2xj(t1) + \u03b1(1 + xj(t1)) ] = 0. (41)\nRearranging Eq. (13) and substituting it into the first term of Eq. (41) with xi(t1 + 1) = \u22121, we can write Eq. (41) as\n2\u03bb\u03b2 [ yi(t1 + 1) + \u03bb ] +\n(1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03bb 2 \u2211 j\u2208V aij [ 2xj(t1) + \u03b1(1 + xj(t1)) ] = 0. (42)\nNow, positivity of \u03b4i(z(t2)) implies 2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3) \u2211\nj\u2208V wijyj(t2) + 2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03b3ui\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03bb\n2\n\u2211 j\u2208V aij [ 2xj(t2) + \u03b1(1 + xj(t2)) ] > 0. (43)\nSimilarly, by recalling Eq. (13) and with xi(t2+1) = +1, we can write Eq. (43) as follows:\n2\u03bb\u03b2 [ yi(t2 + 1)\u2212 \u03bb ] +\n(1\u2212 \u03b2)\u03bb 2 \u2211 j\u2208V aij [ 2xj(t2) + \u03b1(1 + xj(t2)) ] > 0. (44)\nBy hypothesis, xj(t2) = xj(t1) for all j \u0338= i, which implies that x(t2) = x(t1). Thus, we can rearrange Eq. (42) and substitute it into the left hand side of Eq. (44) to obtain 2\u03bb\u03b2[yi(t2 + 1) \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 yi(t1 + 1) \u2212 \u03bb] > 0. By taking this sequence to be sufficiently long, then Lemma 2 guarantees asymptotic convergence of y(t) to y\u2217, and thus y(t2+1) and y(t1+1) are both in a small neighborhood of y\u2217. Further, we have yi(t1 + 1) = y\u2217i + \u03b5\u0302 t1 i and yi(t2 + 1) = y \u2217 i + \u03b5\u0302 t2 i with |\u03b5\u0302t2i | \u2264 |\u03b5\u0302t1i |. This allows us to write\n2\u03bb\u03b2 [ \u03b5\u0302t2i \u2212 \u03b5\u0302t1i \u2212 2\u03bb ] > 0. (45)\nNoting that \u03b5\u0302t2i \u2212 \u03b5\u0302t1i \u2264 2|\u03b5\u0302t1i |, it follows that for a sufficiently small \u03b5\u0302t1i (as occurs when there is a sufficiently long sequence of agent activations with no actions changing), the left of Eq. (45) cannot be positive, which results in a contradiction.\nNow, we consider the case \u03b4i(z(t1)) < 0. Again, by hypothesis, xj(t2) = xj(t1) for all j \u0338= i. Note that this implies that x(t2) = x(t1). Using this and adding and subtracting 2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)(1\u2212\u03b3)\u2211j\u2208V wijyj(t1) to the left hand side of Eq. (43), we obtain\n2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3) \u2211 j\u2208V wij(yj(t2)\u2212 yj(t1)) + \u03b4i(z(t1)) > 0\n(46)\nSimilar to the above, if the sequence in question is sufficiently long, then Lemma 2 guarantees asymptotic convergence of y(t) to y\u2217, and also that y(t1) and y(t2) are in a small neighborhood of y\u2217. Moreover, yi(t1) = y\u2217i +\u03b5 t1 i and yi(t2) = y\u2217i + \u03b5 t2 i with |\u03b5t2i | \u2264 |\u03b5t1i |. Hence, we can write Eq. (46) as\n2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 \u03b3) \u2211 j\u2208V wij(\u03b5 t2 j \u2212 \u03b5t1j ) + \u03b4i(z(t1)) > 0 (47)\nNote that \u03b4i(z(t1)) < 0 and \u2211 j\u2208V wij(\u03b5 t2 j \u2212 \u03b5t1j ) \u2264\n2|\u2211j\u2208V wij\u03b5t1j |. As a result, for a sufficiently small \u03b5t1j , which is guaranteed if the sequence is sufficiently long, the left hand side of Eq. (47) can never be positive. Therefore, \u03b4i(z(t2)) > 0 cannot hold, which implies that the action xi(t2 + 1) in fact does not change from xi(t2).\nTo conclude, we showed that there cannot exist an infinitely long sequence of agent activation such that the actions do not change, while the opinions are converging asymptotically to its unique equilibrium y\u2217. This implies that the actions change at most \u230a \u03a6\u0304\u2212\u03a6c \u230b times in a finite number of time steps; with the actions converging in finite time, asymptotic convergence of the opinions follows from Lemma 2."

            "text": "The proof is comprised of two parts. First, we prove that given a fixed action vector x\u2217 that is polarized with respect to a partitioning (Vp,Vn), as defined in Definition 3, and under the conditions in Eq. (20), the unique vector y\u2217 that satisfies the equilibrium conditions for Eq. (17) is polarized. Second, we show that conditions in Eq. (21) and Eq. (22) guarantee that the action vector x\u2217 in Part 1 is invariant under Eq. (17), which implies that z\u2217 is a polarized equilibrium of the coevolutionary model.\nPart 1: Let x\u2217 be an action vector that is polarized with respect to a partitioning (Vp,Vn). Define y+m = mini\u2208Vp y\u2217i and y\u2212m = mini\u2208Vn y \u2217 i , where y\n\u2217 is the unique equilibrium opinion vector if x\u2217 was fixed (see Lemma 2). From Eq. (17), the equilibrium evaluates to be\ny\u2217i = \u03bbS(\u03b4i(z))+ (1\u2212\u03bb) ( \u2211\nj\u2208Vp\nwijy \u2217 j + \u2211 k\u2208Vn wiky \u2217 k ) . (48)\nIt follows that y+m \u2265 y\u2212m and y+m \u2265 \u03bb+ (1\u2212 \u03bb) [ dpy + m + (1\u2212 dp)y\u2212m ] (49)\nand y\u2212m \u2265 \u2212\u03bb+ (1\u2212 \u03bb) [ d\u0304ny \u2212 m + (1\u2212 d\u0304n)y+m ] . (50)\nRearranging Eq. (50) and substituting in Eq. (49), and then solving for y+m yields\ny+m \u2265 \u03bb 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(1 + d\u0304n \u2212 dp)\n1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(d\u0304n + dp)\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)2(1\u2212 d\u0304n \u2212 dp) .\n(51) Expanding and simplifying the denominator on the right-handside of Eq. (51) yields \u03bb ( 1 + (1\u2212 \u03bb)(1\u2212 d\u0304n \u2212 dp) ) . As d\u0304n < 1 by definition, it follows that 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)(1 \u2212 d\u0304n \u2212 dp) > 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)dp. Further, dp < 1 by definition, which implies (1\u2212\u03bb)dp < 1. Thus, 1+(1\u2212\u03bb)(1\u2212d\u0304n\u2212dp) > 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb)dp >\n0. As the denominator on the right-hand-side of Eq. (51) is positive, the right-hand-side of Eq. (51) is positive if and only if 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb)(1 + d\u0304n \u2212 dp) > 0 or\n\u03bb > (d\u0304p \u2212 dn)/(1 + d\u0304p \u2212 dn). (52)\nThat is, y\u2217i > 0 for all i \u2208 Vp if Eq. (52) holds. Using analogous arguments, but for the quantities y+M = maxi\u2208Vp y \u2217 i and y\u2212M = maxi\u2208Vn y \u2217 i , it follows that y \u2217 i < 0,\u2200 i \u2208 Vn if\n\u03bb > (d\u0304n \u2212 dp)/(1 + d\u0304n \u2212 dp). (53)\nThis secures Eq. (20). Part 2: We now show that Eqs. (21)\u2013(22) are sufficient for the x\u2217 polarized with respect to the partitioning (Vp,Vn) to be an equilibrium.\nFor all i \u2208 Vp and t \u2265 0, xi(t) = +1 = xi(t+ 1) = +1 if and only if \u03b4i(z(t)) > 0, which from Eq. (18) is implied by\n2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)(dpy+m+(1\u2212dp)y\u2212m)+(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03bb(2dp\u22121) > 0, (54)\nwhere y\u2212m and y + m were defined in Part 1 of this proof. Noting Eq. (17) and Eq. (49), and simplifying the term \u03bb, we write Eq. (54) as\n2\u03b2(y+m \u2212 \u03bb) + (1\u2212 \u03b2)(2dp \u2212 1) > 0. (55)\nSubstituting y+m from Eq. (51) and simplifying yields Eq. (21). Following a similar argument, for any i \u2208 Vn and all t \u2265 0, xi(t) = \u22121 and xi(t+1) = \u22121 if and only if \u03b4i(x(t), y(t)) < 0, which from Eq. (18) is implied by\n2\u03bb\u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)(dny\u2212M+(1\u2212dp)y+M )\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03bb(2dn\u22121) < 0 (56)\nwhere y\u2212M and y + M were defined in Part 1 of this proof. Utilizing again Eq. (17), we can write Eq. (56) as 2\u03b2(y\u2212M + \u03bb)\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b2)(2dn\u22121) < 0. Finally, substituting the expression for y\u2212M , computed to derive Eq. (53), we obtain Eq. (22)."

            "text": "Assuming that x(t) and y(t) are polarized for a given t \u2208 Z+, we start by showing that if{\u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij > 1 2 ( 1 + \u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)1\u2212\u03b2\u03bb ) , i \u2208 Vp,\u2211\nj\u2208Vn wij > 1 2 ( 1 + \u03b2(1\u2212\u03bb)1\u2212\u03b2\u03bb ) , i \u2208 Vn\n(57)\nholds, then the action vector x(t+ 1) will be polarized; then we show that if also{\u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij > 1\u22122\u03bb 1\u2212\u03bb , i \u2208 Vp,\u2211\nj\u2208Vn wij > 1\u22122\u03bb 1\u2212\u03bb , i \u2208 Vn\n(58)\nholds, then the opinion vector y(t+1) will also be polarized. Hence, by induction, if z(0) is polarized, then z(t) will be polarized, for all t \u2208 Z+. Finally, Theorems 1 and 2 are leveraged to guarantee convergence to an equilibrium and that such equilibrium is polarized, respectively.\nLet us consider an arbitrary time step t, at which an agent i activates, and suppose that the system is in a polarized state z(t) = z with respect to a partition (Vp,Vn). We start by showing that if Eq. (57) holds, then xi(t + 1) = xi(t), and thus the action vector x remains polarized. We demonstrate\nthe computations for agent i \u2208 Vp, with the arguments for agent i \u2208 Vn being almost identical and thus omitted.\nSuppose that the agent active at time t is agent i \u2208 Vp, which implies that xi(t) = +1. Now, agent i will not change action if sgn(\u03b4i(z(t))) \u2265 0. Considering the partitioning (Vp,Vn), and dropping the time argument t for convenience, we can write Eq. (18) as:\n\u03b4i(z) = p \u2211 j\u2208Vp wijyj+p \u2211 k\u2208Vn wikyk+q ( \u2211 j\u2208Vp wij\u2212 1 2 ) (59)\nwhere p = 2\u03bb\u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03bb) and q = 2\u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03b2). Since yk \u2208 [\u22121, 0), \u2200k \u2208 Vn and yj \u2208 (0,+1], \u2200j \u2208 Vp, Eq. (59) is implied by\n\u03b4i(z) \u2265 \u2212p \u2211\nk\u2208Vn wik + q (\u2211 j\u2208Vp wij \u2212 1 2 ) . (60)\nWe know that \u2211 k\u2208Vn wik = 1 \u2212 \u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij because W is stochastic. Thus, Eq. (60) is further implied by\n\u03b4i(z) \u2265 (p+ q) \u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij \u2212\n( p+ 1 2 q )\n(61)\nIt follows that\u2211 j\u2208Vp wij \u2265 1 2 ( 1 + p p+ q ) = 1 2 ( 1 + \u03b2(1\u2212 \u03bb) 1\u2212 \u03b2\u03bb ) (62)\nimplies \u03b4i(z) \u2265 0, which yields xi(t + 1) = xi(t) = +1. Following a similar path for i \u2208 Vn, we conclude that the action vector at x(t+1) remains polarized with respect to the partitioning (Vp,Vn).\nNext, we prove that if Eqs. (57) and (58) holds, then sgn(yi(t + 1)) = sgn(yi(t)), and thus y(t + 1) is polarized with respect to the same partitioning (Vp,Vn) just as y(t). Again, we consider agent i \u2208 Vp being the active agent at time t, and omit the computations for i \u2208 Vn as they follow a similar path.\nConsider agent i \u2208 Vp as the active agent at time t. Since Eq. (57) holds, then \u03b4i(z(t)) \u2265 0, as detailed above. Then, with yk(t) \u2208 [\u22121, 0), \u2200k \u2208 Vn, and yj(t) \u2208 (0,+1], \u2200j \u2208 Vp, observe that Eq. (13) implies that\nyi(t+ 1) \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03bb) ( \u2212\u2211k\u2208Vn wik)+ \u03bb\n= (1\u2212 \u03bb) (\u2211 j\u2208Vp wij \u2212 1 ) + \u03bb\n(63)\nwhere the latter holds since \u2211 j\u2208Vn wij = 1 \u2212 \u2211\nj\u2208Vp wij . Thus, yi(t + 1) > 0 is implied by the right-hand side of Eq. (63) being strictly positive, and this holds if the first condition in Eq. (58) holds. Note that Eq. (58) always holds if \u03bb > 12 because wij are nonnegative. This, combined with Eq. (57), secures Eq. (23).\nAn induction argument can then used to guarantee that z(t) will be polarized, for any t \u2265 0, if z(0) is polarized with respect to the partition (Vp,Vn) and Eq. (23) holds. Finally, Theorem 1 \u2014which can be applied since Assumptions 1\u20132 hold\u2014 guarantees that convergence whereby limt\u2192\u221e z(t) \u2192 z\u2217. Since z(t) is polarized with respect to (Vp,Vn), and because Eq. (23) verifies conditions (20)\u2013(22) of Theorem 2 (which can be applied since Assumptions 1\u20133 hold), then z\u2217 must be polarized with respect to (Vp,Vn)."
