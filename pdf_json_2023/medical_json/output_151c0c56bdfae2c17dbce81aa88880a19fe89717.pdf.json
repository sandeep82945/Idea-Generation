    "abstractText": "The theory that the people of the early modern period slept in well-defined segments of \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleeps has been highly influential in both scholarly literature and mainstream media over the past twenty years. Based on a combination of scientific, anthropological and textual evidence, the segmented sleep theory has been used to illuminate discussions regarding important aspects of early modern nocturnal culture; mainstream media reports, meanwhile, have proposed segmented sleep as a potentially \u2018natural\u2019 and healthier alternative to consolidated blocks of sleep. In this article, I re-examine the scientific, anthropological and early modern literary sources behind the segmented sleep theory and ask if the evidence might support other models of early modern sleep that are not characterised by segmentation, while acknowledging that construction of such models is by nature limited and uncertain. I propose a more diverse range of interpretations of early modern texts related to sleep, with important implications for medical and social history and literary scholarship.",

The segmented sleep theory proposes that:\nUntil the modern era, up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness midway through the night interrupted the rest of mostWestern Europeans [\u2026] Families rose from their beds to urinate, smoke tobacco, and even visit close neighbors. Remaining abed, many persons also made love, prayed, and, most important, reflected on the dreams that typically preceded waking from their \u2018first sleep\u2019. Not only were these visions unusually vivid, but their images would have intruded far less on conscious thought had sleepers not stirred until dawn. [\u2026] In addition to suggesting that consolidated sleep, such as we today experience, is unnatural, segmented slumber afforded the unconscious an expanded avenue to the waking world that has remained closed for most of the Industrial Age.1\nThismodel of pre-modern \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleep has caught the attention and imagination of academic and popular authors alike.

Thus, some authors assumed a natural waking at this time and attempted to guide thought to spiritual ends.\u20194\nThe evocative images conjured in Ekirch\u2019s prose \u2013 of \u2018Families\u2019 who \u2018rose from their beds to urinate, smoke tobacco, and even visit close neighbors\u2019 \u2013 have also become commonplace in material aimed at a general audience, possibly going beyond Ekirch\u2019s original interpretation and intentions. The Folger Shakespeare Library\u2019s family worksheet on sleep, produced to accompany a 2009 exhibition, asks its readers:\nCan you imagine waking up at midnight, hanging out with your friends for an hour, and then going back to sleep again? For Elizabethans, night-time slumber was divided into \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleeps, separated by a timewhen people wouldwake up and take part in activities such as socializing, reading, or praying.5\nIn their popular market-oriented history bookWhat We Did in Bed: A Horizontal History (2019), Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani speculate that \u2018our modern desire to deny this \u201cnatural\u201d [segmented] sleep rhythm\u2019might have \u2018led to our current multibillion-dollar reliance on sleeping pills\u2019, and ask, \u2018Could we solve our sleep problems simply by understanding how we used to do things?\u20196 A BBC website item in 2012 asserted that \u2018the majority of doctors still fail to acknowledge that a consolidated eight-hour sleep may be unnatural\u2019 and concluded that \u2018the next time youwake up in themiddle of the night, think of your pre-industrial ancestors and relax. Lying awake could be good for you.\u20197 In 2022, an article inThe Sunday Times stated that \u2018Before the Industrial Revolution, segmented sleep was accepted as normal. Insomniac cavemenwould stay awake on watch for danger and from theMiddle Ages tomedieval times [sic] people would sleep in two shifts\u2019; it went on to claim that \u2018more people are turning to a segmented sleeping schedule, which typically involves two four-hour stages of sleep, with a break of a few hours in the middle\u2019.8 Robert Harris\u2019s 2019 novel about a future society that has reverted to a medieval way of life is entitled The Second Sleep, quotes Ekirch in its epigraph, and includes a scene in which the visiting protagonist wakes between first and second sleeps to find the locals socialising: \u2018In Exeter, the custom between the first and second sleeps is to stick to our rooms. Yet the villagers here are abroad.\u20199\nPerhaps the segmented sleep theory appeals because it presents a radical historical alternative to a pattern of consolidated sleep that is so accepted in the modern-day Western world as to seem a completely natural biological process. Certainly, segmented sleep appears to be firmly established as\n2Craig Koslofsky, Evening\u2019s Empire: AHistory of the Night in EarlyModern Europe (Cambridge: CambridgeUniversity Press, 2011), p. 6.\n3Claude Fretz, Dreams, Sleep, and Shakespeare\u2019s Genres (Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2020), 52. 4Tara Hamling and Catherine Richardson, A Day at Home in Early Modern England: Material Culture and Domestic Life, 1500\u20131700 (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2017), 260. 5A Family Guide to \u2018To Sleep, Perchance to Dream\u2019, Folger Shakespeare Library, 2009 <https://folgerpedia. folger.edu/mediawiki/ media/images_pedia_folgerpedia_mw/f/f1/To_Sleep_Perchance_to_Dream_FAMILY_GUIDE.pdf> [Accessed 10 April 2022]. 6Brian Fagan and Nadia Durrani, What We Did in Bed: A Horizontal History (New Haven andLondon: Yale University Press, 2019), 5. 7Stephanie Hegarty, The myth of the eight-hour sleep, online news report, BBC News, 22 February 2012 <https:// www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783> [Accessed 2 February 2022]. 8Katie Gatens, \u2018Wake up to the wonders of a broken night\u2019s sleep\u2019, The Sunday Times, 20 February 2022, <https:// www.thetimes.co.uk/article/wake-up-to-the-wonders-of-a-broken-nights-sleep-hg8c9hzp7> [Accessed 8 May 2022]. 9Robert Harris, The Second Sleep (London: Hutchinson, 2019), vii, 19.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\npart of the modern-day cultural understanding of the pre-industrial world. The theory that human sleep is naturally segmented has even, as the news reports quoted above indicate, been used by some as health advice. In this context, it is helpful to return to Ekirch\u2019s original research and to search for and flag up any ambiguities that might alter our readings of the texts he cites in support of his argument.\nEkirch\u2019s research has undoubtedly been of great value to social, cultural and literary historians, both in emphasising the importance of sleeping practices in interpreting historical cultures and in calling into question basic assumptions about such practices. The purpose of the present article is not to altogether deny the existence of segmented sleep in the past, and specifically the early modern period. It is, instead, to demonstrate that some of the scientific evidence, anthropological evidence and in particular the early modern texts cited in Ekirch\u2019s 2001 article that apparently refer to segmented sleep might be interpreted in a different manner. An apparent mountain of evidence for segmented sleep which has been carefully gathered and curated by Ekirch might also provide rich details regarding a diversity of sleeping patterns and practices in the early modern period. The latter part of this article re-evaluates some of the copious material from the 2001 article \u2018Sleep We Have Lost\u2019. I have focused in particular on material from England in the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, first as this makes up a large amount of the material used by Ekirch to support his argument, and second, as this provides a comparatively coherent set of texts to analyse, in terms of linguistic, historical and geographic boundaries, while also being a rich source of pre-industrial writing.10 Ekirch himself has noted that \u2018Allusions to \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond sleep\u201d are plentiful in early modern texts\u2019.11\n\u2018Sleep We Have Lost\u2019 was by no means Ekirch\u2019s final word on the subject of segmented sleep. In subsequent articles he has made modifications to his argument and provided additional evidence. However, this article focuses on the 2001 publication because it is arguably his most influential articulation of the theory, and the essence of his approach \u2013 citing scientific and anthropological texts, and quoting from a vast number of pre-industrial (and selected post-industrial) texts which apparently refer to segmented sleep \u2013 has remained unchanged.12 For example, Ekirch\u2019s 2015 Past and Present paper \u2018The Modernization of Western Sleep\u2019, like \u2018Sleep We Have Lost\u2019, uses the retrieval and analysis of numerous references to \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleeps frommainly printed texts to explore historical sleeping patterns.13\nI amnot the first to strike a note of caution, nor to suggest that the earlymodern nightmight have seen a wide diversity of sleeping practices and patterns. For example, Janine Rivi\u00e8re notes that \u2018although A. Roger Ekirch suggests premodern people typically experienced a pattern of segmented sleep, this is not discussed inmanuals of health or discussions of the proper regimens of sleep.\u201914 It is certainly striking that while Ekirch argues that his evidence consists of \u2018fragments\u2019 and \u2018shards\u2019 in \u2018sources ranging from depositions and diaries to imaginative literature\u2019, he must \u2018piece together\u2019 to construct a pattern of biphasic, segmented early modern sleep, Riviere\u2019s research has identified no single, unambiguous early modern medical discussion of segmented sleep.15 Furthermore, although Sasha Handley reads some\n10Three references (to Noel Taillepied\u2019s work, a letter by Erasmus and a lecture by James Crichton-Browne) were added following comments arising from the peer review process; I am grateful to reviewers for drawing my attention to these texts.\n11Ekirch, \u2018TheModernization ofWestern Sleep: Or, Does Insomnia Have a History?\u2019, Past and Present, 226 (2015), 149\u2013192 (154). He adds that \u2018they are also well represented in medieval literature and, though fewer in number, in [\u2026] classical works\u2019.\n12See A.

Hamling and Richardson (op. cit. (note 4)] cite At Day\u2019s Close, as do Fagan and Durrani [op. cit. (note 6)].\n13In the case of \u2018The Modernization of Western Sleep\u2019, Ekirch [op. cit. (note 11)] reviews material from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century; an example from this article is discussed below.\n14Janine Rivi\u00e8re, Dreams in Early Modern England (New York and Abingdon: Taylor and Francis, 2017), 146. 15Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 364.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ntextual evidence as congruent with segmented sleep, she also cites theGerman-language work of Gabriele Klugwhen expressing doubt as to \u2018whether the linguisticmeanings of \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d sleep do in fact correspond to a pattern of segmented slumber.\u201916 In private correspondence, Klug (now Schichta) has informed me that:\nI was able to find somematching references in the Middle High German texts I analyzed: There are several records of a \u2018first sleep\u2019 (though none of a \u2018second\u2019 sleep). However, I used to interpret these passages with regard to the \u2018common knowledge\u2019 (which, by the way, still seems to be an issue in our days) that sleep before midnight is deeper and \u2018better\u2019 than sleep after midnight. In medieval German literature I found no references to actual periods of wakefulness that would have separated first and second sleep (apart from examples related to religious practice, i.e. if a person rises to celebrate the Liturgy of the Hour).17\nResearch such as Schichta\u2019s does not invalidate the concept of routinely divided first and second sleeps in early modern England; it does, however, raise the question as to why such practices left little, or equivocal, evidence in German texts. Handley proposes that \u2018Much evidence does exist to support the wide-spread practice of biphasic sleep but such routines were not uniformly characteristic of early modern habits\u2019.18 The present article goes further still, arguing that this supposedly supportive evidence might itself be re-interpreted in a way that reveals ambiguities and contradictions, pointing to a greater complexity than a simple and widespread pattern of \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 periods of sleep. It is possible that sleep did occur in two phases in some cases in earlymodern England; but reading earlymodern texts with the assumption that segmented sleep was a routine and widespread practice might lead to misinterpretation or, rather, restricted interpretation of the evidence. For the avoidance of doubt, this is not to argue that Ekirch arrived at his views on segmented sleep before his analysis of the copious evidence he provides. But it is to say that carefully re-examining the texts Ekirch presents might reveal new interpretations that do not rely on the segmented sleep model. Segmented sleep may be just one framework, rather than the sole framework, for understanding texts concerning pre-industrial sleep.\nIndeed, Ekirch\u2019s summary of his own thesis\u2014cited at length above\u2014is not without ambiguity. The phrase \u2018up to an hour or more\u2019 is unclear: the wording could mean \u2018around an hour\u2019 but might also encompass anything from a few seconds of wakefulness to an extended period of activity. The implication seems to be that a gap of an hour or so between phases of sleep was normal practice for the majority of people (however, the activities he mentioned require very different amounts of time and wakefulness: from urinating, to making love, to visiting neighbours).19 More creative interpretations of Ekirch\u2019s work, such as the Robert Harris novel cited above, portray nocturnal waking and activity as a collective phenomenon (possibly taking their cue from the reference to \u2018Families\u2019); however, this is not a conclusion explicitly drawn by Ekirch himself.\nEkirch\u2019s assertion that dreams in the first phase of sleep were \u2018unusually vivid\u2019 and more likely to be remembered because sleep was broken is similarly questionable. It is unclear whether Ekirch means that dreams during the first sleep were richer experiences than dreams in the second sleep, whether there was something about the gap between first and second sleeps that meant memorisation of first-sleep dreams was more likely than that of second-sleep dreams, or both.\nEvidence from both contemporary sleep research and early modern texts qualifies somewhat the proposition that first-sleep dreams might have had \u2018unusually vivid\u2019 qualities.20 Modern-day sleep\n16Sasha Handley, Sleep in Early Modern England (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2016), 8\u20139. Handley cites Ekirch\u2019s \u2018Sleep We Have Lost\u2019, op. cit. (note 1), At Day\u2019s Close, op. cit. (note 12) and \u2018Modernization\u2019, op. cit. (note 11).\n17Gabriele Schichta, private correspondence, 23 November, 2020, quoted with permission. 18Handley, op. cit. (note 16), 213. 19This phrasing was modified by Ekirch in 2015, when he stated that the interval between sleeps was \u2018Typically [\u2026] bridged\nshortly past midnight by up to an hour or so of wakefulness\u2019. op. cit. (note 13), 152. 20Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 144.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nstudies indicate that human beings usually cycle in and out of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep throughout the night, with a preponderance of REM in the latter part of the night; REM is the sleep phase associated with vivid narrative dreams.21 Although there might be difficulties in the wholesale application of neuroscientific findings in modern-day humans to the brains and bodies of early modern individuals, this evidence suggests that there is a human tendency for more vivid dreams to be experienced towards the hours of morning, rather than in the initial period of sleep. Furthermore, this evidence is consistent with the common early modern belief that morning dreams held the most reliable truth value, occurring, as they did, at a point when, as Rivi\u00e8re puts it, \u2018the body had completed digestion, allowing the soul to commune more freely with spirits\u2019.22 The term \u2018morning\u2019 is, of course, inexact, although the sources cited by Rivi\u00e8re appear to refer to the period leading up to the dawn. Even the physician Richard Haydocke (1569 or 1670, c.1642), who rejected the idea of morning dreams as prophetic, acknowledged their characteristic clarity:\nye morninge dreames begotten of ye milde vapours of ye second concoction, are most sincere & pure: insoemuch yt some haue esteemed them ye truer; whereof there is noe great reason. Theymay bee the more intire and aptly composed, as of poeticall fictions some may be more artificially handled then others, and yet none of them true.23\nThe phrase \u2018intire and aptly composed\u2019 might be suggestive of dreams that have some form of memorable\u2014albeit bizarre\u2014narrative coherence. Incidentally, Haydocke\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018second concoction\u2019 suggests another ambiguity that problematises understanding of first and second sleeps, and is discussed in further detail below; it is unclear whether the existence of two ormore biological phases in the earlymodern conception of sleep necessarily implied that there would be a significant gap of regained consciousness between these phases, or whether the phrases \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019might bemore akin to the descriptors \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018late\u2019.\nEkirch\u2019s argument that dream \u2018images would have intruded far less on conscious thought had sleepers not stirred until dawn\u2019 is plausible; it is impossible to consciously reflect onmental experiences while one is still in a state of unconsciousness (putting aside cases of lucid dreaming). However, it is unclear that a midnight phase of wakefulness would have led to the greater ability of the individual to memorise the details of dreams. Ekirch proposes that a period of wakefulness in the middle of the night would have allowed for the consolidation of dreams in long-term memory: \u2018Had pre-industrial families not stirred until dawn, remaining instead asleep in their beds, many of these visions of self-revelation, solace, and spirituality would have perished by the bedside\u2014some lost in the throes of sleep, others dissipated by the distractions of a new day\u2019.24 With a little preparation, it is also possible that artificial light and writing materials close to handmight have aided thememorisation of dreams. However, the new day would also have brought with it themeans to rapidly record and reflect upon dreams, with even easier access to light and writing materials; indeed, the notebooks of astrological physician Simon Forman include references to morning dreams such as that dated 4 January, 1594: \u2018in the morninge lyinge in my bed I dremt howe I was in a place wher too men were readinge a bocke of the philosophers stone\u2019.25 Furthermore, the evidence that morning dreams were held to be potentially significant experiences, or at least notably rich and coherent, suggests that the \u2018distractions of the new day\u2019 did not necessarily mean that dreams before dawn faded rapidly into oblivion and insignificance. Of course, it is impossible to quantify the factors that argue for midnight dreams being more memorable (a waking period of reflection) versus morning dreams being more memorable (REM sleep patterns, cultural significance, availability of light and\n21Patrick McNamara, The Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019), 30\u201332. 22Rivi\u00e8re, op. cit.

The point, however, is that if we are to ask why dreams formed an important part of earlymodern culture, it is important to look beyond segmented sleep as an explanation. This is not to suggest that Ekirch himself proposes that segmented sleep is the sole reason for the manner in which early modern culture treated dreams; however, as the work cited at the beginning of this article suggests, it is an explanation to which early modern scholarship readily resorts.26\nFinally, Ekirch\u2019s suggestion that \u2018consolidated sleep, such as we today experience, is unnatural\u2019, while an eye-catching assertion, is ambiguous in both its precise meaning and implication. It is unclear where the line of \u2018natural\u2019 versus \u2018unnatural\u2019 is drawn in a species which has such a diverse range of technologies and social practices. It is similarly questionable \u2013 to address the arguments made in the popular histories and news reports cited above \u2013 whether a \u2018natural\u2019 sociobiological practice is necessarily better for one\u2019s health than an \u2018unnatural\u2019 one.27 For example, pasteurisation, antibiotics, anaesthetics and vaccination are \u2018unnatural\u2019 in that they are the inventions of a complex, technology-rich society; few would argue, however, that their absence made the people of the early modern period healthier. Rather than pit the \u2018natural\u2019 against the \u2018unnatural\u2019, it is possible to acknowledge that sleeping practices have varied and continue to vary across societies, and to study the ways in which these variations interact with religious, scientific and cultural frameworks. This article re-assesses the original evidence for segmented sleep proposed by Ekirch with the intention not of ruling out the possibility of segmented sleep, but of determining whether alternative readings of this evidence\u2014and hence, alternative accounts of early modern sleep\u2014are possible."

The single scientific study cited is a 1993 paper by ThomasWehr, via its report in theNew York Times. Ekirch writes that Wehr\u2019s study demonstrated that \u2018human subjects, deprived at night of artificial light over a span of several weeks, eventually exhibited a pattern of broken slumber\u2014 astonishingly, one practically identical to that of pre-industrial households.\u201928 However, this finding is questionable.\nThe scientific paper onwhich theNewYork Times report appears to be based is a relatively small study of 16 participants, aged between 20 and 36 years; 15 were male, and 1 female.29 The study shifted these participants from a \u2018long-day photoperiod regime (16 h light/activity, 8 h dark/rest) for 1 wk\u2019 to \u2018a shortday regime (10 h light/activity, 14 h dark/rest) for 4 wk\u2019 over a 2-week interval.

Furthermore, given the seasonal changes in the hours of daylight, no one in early modern England would have experienced 14 hours of darkness as a regular fixture all year round. While it was clearly notWehr\u2019s intention to produce conditions thatmimicked the earlymodern night\u2014 and nor does Ekirch propose this is the case\u2014one has to question what the significance of a finding of biphasic sleep under these conditions, even if confirmed, would be. It is unclear to what extent an inherent pattern of biphasic sleep, even emergent under light deprivation, would persist under the influence of specific cultural sleeping practices such as the material conditions of sleep (beds and bedding, solitary or communal), diet, medicines and prayer and meditation.\nWhatever the case, the evidence regarding a natural pattern of split sleep is unclear; although the paper states that sleep was \u2018typically separated into two fragments with an interval of wakefulness between them\u2019, the relevant figure does not demonstrate this conclusively, and indeed its legend states that \u2018In long nights, sleep generally separated into \u22652 [ie. two or more] fragments and often exhibited a symmetrical bimodal pattern of distribution\u2019. The \u2018bimodal pattern\u2019, in other words, is subjectively assessed and neither clearly defined nor quantified.32 Incidentally, a 2013 study by KennethWright and colleagues, in which eight participants (two females) were studied under 1 week of normal daily routines with exposure to electrical lighting followed by 2weeks of camping in summer (a 14 hour 40minute light: 9 hour 20 minute dark cycle with only exposure to firelight at night), found that \u2018natural\u2019 lighting conditions affected the timing of the circadian clock; but biphasic sleep was not reported.33 However, small studies of relatively short duration should not of themselves lead one to dismiss Wehr\u2019s data. To fully resolve this issue, larger-scale studies and possibly systematic review of the scientific evidence are needed.\nAs with the data cited from Wehr\u2019s work, the anthropological evidence that Ekirch presents is of questionable relevance to sleep in the early modern world. He writes that \u2018Anthropologists have found villages of the Tiv, Chagga, and G/wi, for example, in Africa to be surprisingly alive after midnight with newly roused adults and children.\u2019 He cites \u2018a study in 1969\u2019 of the Tiv in Nigeria that \u2018recorded, \u201cAt night, they wake when they will and talk with anyone else awake in the hut\u201d\u2019, and adds that \u2018The Tiv even employ the terms \u201cfirst sleep\u201d and \u201csecond sleep\u201d as traditional intervals of time.\u201934 Leaving aside the issue as to whether a twentieth-century Nigerian society has sufficient features in common with early modern European culture to allow one to throw light upon the other, the text cited by Ekirch is again open to more than one interpretation.\nWhile Paul Bohannan\u2019s 1953 study documents the use of the terms \u2018first sleep\u2019 and \u2018second sleep\u2019 by the Tiv, it is not clear that these terms are used to describe the sort of sleeping practice Ekirch proposes, that is, two neatly differentiated segments of sleep with a break in the middle:\nTiv are much less specific about time during the night. The time between dusk and about 10 o\u2019clock is called \u2018sitting together\u2019 (teman im\u00f4ngo). After that follows \u2018the middle of the night\u2019 (helat\u00f4 tugh), which overlaps with the \u2018time of the first sleep\u2019 (icin i mnya m\u00f4m); \u2018the time of the second sleep\u2019\n31Natalie Angier, \u2018Modern Life Suppresses Ancient Body Rhythm\u2019, New York Times, 14 March 1995 <https://www.nyti mes.com/1995/03/14/science/modern-life-suppresses-an-ancient-body-rhythm.html> [Accessed 23 June 2019].\n32It should also be noted \u2013 in the interests of complete reporting \u2013 that one participant \u2018progressively became severely depressed and suicidal during the first 5 days of exposure to long nights and was removed from the experiment.\u2019Wehr, op. cit.

The pre-dawn breeze (kiishi) gives its name to the period just before dawn.35\nThis paragraph is part of a study of concepts of time among the Tiv. It immediately follows a section concerning the precision with which the Tiv divide up the daylight hours through the position of the sun; the point is that the hours of darkness are less well defined, not that they are divided into clear and distinct periods. The article is not concerned with sleeping practices as such, and thus it is not clear that Bohannan is indicating that there are two periods of sleep with a gap of wakefulness, or whether the \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second sleep\u2019might simply be used in a way that is broadly synonymous with earlier and later phases of the night.\nMeanwhile, the quotation from the \u2018study in 1969\u2019 that states \u2018At night they wake when they will and talk with anyone else awake in the hut\u2019 indicates simply that some individuals do not sleep through the night, and that the sleeping arrangements of the Tiv are such that it is possible they might find another person awake. This might indicate occasionally broken sleep for a certain number of individuals rather thanwidespread observance of clear periods of segmented sleep. The anthropological evidence is, as with the scientific evidence presented, neither clearly generalisable nor unequivocal in its documentation of segmented sleep.\nRe-reading the texts: the meaning of \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleep\nThe bulk of the evidence Ekirch presents is not scientific or anthropological, but consists of excerpts from a variety of early modern texts. The picture constructed is based on, as noted above, a proliferation of what he calls \u2018shards\u2019 fitted together, rather than detailed analysis of any single text. While this method has the strength of gathering material from a wide range of sources, it has an important limitation: the various quotations that Ekirch presents in his study might support the idea of segmented sleep if read with that concept inmind, butmay also suggest other possibilities, such as idiosyncratically broken sleep, or specific circumstances in which light and interrupted sleep was to be expected.\nPoor-quality sleep was not uncommon in early modern England. Rivi\u00e8re notes the data gleaned by Michael MacDonald from the medical notebooks of Richard Napier that reveal 20 percent of all cases involved trouble sleeping; 2.7 percent of these cases included a complaint of \u2018fearful dreams\u2019, suggesting that at least some of these individuals were troubled by undesired waking (referred to today as middle and terminal insomnia) rather than, or in addition to, the inability to fall asleep (initial insomnia).36 Indeed, some material cited by historians in support of routinely segmented early modern sleep might also be read simply as evidence of undesirable broken sleep. For example, Hamling and Richardson cite a prayer from Thomas Bentley\u2019s The Monument of Matrons (1582) to illustrate their point that \u2018some authors assumed a natural waking\u2019 in themiddle of the night.37 The poem in question is entitled \u2018AtMidnight, If You Happen to Awake\u2019, and the author attributes nocturnal waking to divine action: \u2018Euen now in the night season, while thou holdest mine eies waking, I saie, will I thinke of thee my creator\u2019.38 The phrase \u2018if you happen to awake\u2019 suggests preparation for a possible eventuality, rather than for an inevitable part of the night\u2019s schedule. Moreover, \u2018Euen now\u2019 suggests that this nocturnal waking is troublesome and undesirable, rather than routine; Bentley is praising God despite holding Him responsible for his inability to return to sleep.\nAnother example that illustrates the importance of context is Ekirch\u2019s citation of Montague Summers\u2019s English translation of Noel Taillepied\u2019s A Treatise of Ghosts, which describes the period \u2018about\n35Paul Bohannan, \u2018Concepts of Time among the Tiv of Nigeria\u2019, Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 9 (1953), 251\u2013262 (253).\n36Rivi\u00e8re, op. cit.

The passage follows a description of how \u2018the clear unclouded vision of a child often perceives spiritual visitants whom older eyes cannot discern\u2019 and hence carries the implication that the beneficial first phase of sleepmakes the perception of ghostsmore likely.40 The referencemightmean that ghosts tend to show up around midnight, when people normally wake from the first period of segmented sleep; another interpretation is that the individual has incidentally woken up from a deep and restful first phase of sleep and is thus able to see the ghost; another interpretation might be that the awakening is related to the arrival of the ghost. Elsewhere in Taillepied\u2019s text, there is an allusion to being woken from sleep by a haunting; in a section on how spirits may haunt those responsible for their deaths, he quotes Virgil\u2019s version of Dido\u2019s promise to Aeneas that she will \u2018disturb thy Sleep\u2019 as an \u2018angry Ghost\u2019.41 It is clear that Taillepied is claiming the first phase of sleep is particularly restful and beneficial; it is less clear that this is unambiguous evidence for segmented sleep.\nTo take a further example, in this case one where detailed biographical information about the subject is available, Ekirch\u2019s collection of segmented sleep references online includes an excerpt from a letter from Erasmus to Johann Choler, dated August 1535: \u2018I accomplished this work, without being able to give it all the care it should have taken, but [during] hours of the afternoon, walking, while my families ate, sometimes in bed, while waiting for the second sleep.\u201942 Ekirch does not, however, note that at this point in Erasmus\u2019 life, he was experiencing health problems, notably chronic pain caused by gout, which interfered with his sleep.43 It is therefore uncertain that an excerpt fromErasmus\u2019work at this stage in his life can be taken as representative of a normal or expected sleeping pattern; the point he is making, that his work has occurred in snatched time rather than with sufficient care and focus, suggests that wakefulness and activity between first and second periods of sleep is not necessarily a social or personal norm.\nEvidence that waking from a first sleep into a period of alertness might have been associated with some distress is provided by Sasha Handley\u2019s citation from prayer books, including a 1749 edition of Bishop of Bangor Lewis Bayly\u2019sNewPractice of Piety, which, inHandley\u2019swords, \u2018included set prayers for distinct phases of the night: for undressing, lying down in bed, settling to prayer, waking between the first and second sleep, and for accidental waking, which might be due, for example, to the noise of a striking clock.\u201944 However, the relevant page of the New Practice does not use the language of a \u2018first\u2019 or \u2018second\u2019 sleep, but refers to a prayer \u2018To be used in theNightwhen you awake, or cannot sleep\u2019, which begins \u2018Stand in awe and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.\u201945 It is not clear from the text whether or not this waking is a routine part of a segmented pattern of sleep, or a common, if unwanted, nocturnal experience (as the phrase \u2018cannot sleep\u2019would suggest a term that covers both initial difficulties falling asleep and sleeping difficulties following nocturnal waking). While \u2018when you awake\u2019 and \u2018cannot sleep\u2019 are distinguished from one another, their grouping together within this text suggests that both might be undesirable or even distressing states. This impression is reinforced by the fact that this prayer and the prayer about the striking clock are gathered under the heading \u2018Ejaculations\u2019, which at\n39Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 366.

A 2010 survey recorded that 31.2% of the general European population reported waking up at least three nights per week, and that 7.7% had difficulty resuming sleep. Nocturnal awakenings, in other words, are highly prevalent in present-day Europeans.47 The specific drivers behind poor and broken sleep have changed over the past 500 years; however, it is not necessarily the case that there was a time of \u2018natural\u2019 segmented sleep, in which a clear gap between two sleeps was an anticipated part of one\u2019s nightly routine, that has now been lost.\nDetailed analysis of a sample of Ekirch\u2019s sources reveals alternative readings; while segmented sleep cannot be ruled out, neither is it the sole possible explanation for the terminology or circumstances described within the texts. Ekirch states that the first segment of sleep was referred to as a \u2018first sleep\u2019 (or, less frequently, \u2018first nap\u2019 or \u2018dead sleep\u2019).48 However, as noted above (and discussed in detail below), this termmight simply describe the first phase of a continuous night\u2019s sleep; even if a period of wakefulness is implied, it is not always clear that this was a regular part, \u2018up to an hour\u2019, of the normal early modern night. Indeed, some sources cited by Ekirch describe distinctly unusual circumstances. For example, Ekirch quotes William Davenant\u2019s The Unfortunate Lovers, in which Rampino (\u2018A young gallant souldier, much indebted and vexed by Creditors\u2019) states he is \u2018More watchfull than/A sicke Constable after his first sleepe/On a cold bench\u2019.49 The figure of speech here is unclear. Itmight be drawing a parallel between the officer sleeping on duty and the usual domestic pattern of segmented sleep. However, the implication could also be that, after dropping off during the first period of his watch (ie. the hours of the usual first phase of sleep), the constable has woken and is being watchful; either because he is feeling physically ill or, in compensation, lest he fall asleep again (\u2018sick\u2019 perhaps being used in the sense of \u2018guilty\u2019 as well as indicating physical infirmity).50 Davenant might even be referring to a constable new to his duties who has slept for the first time on \u2018a cold bench\u2019, that is to say, has had the first taste of the harsh physical circumstances of his job. While it is impossible to determine the correct meaning of what might have been either a new coinage by Davenant or a colloquial phrase, it does lend itself to more than one interpretation.\nBesides the night watch of Davenant\u2019s constable, other sources cited by Ekirch involve unusual sleeping situations and arrangements. As Ekirch notes, William Baldwin\u2019s Beware the Cat contains a reference to a \u2018first slepe\u2019; however, this is in the context of a Christmas gathering at Court, where the narrator and three other men share a chamber. Outside of the festive season and these sleeping arrangements\u2014described at some length, suggesting novelty\u2014an intellectual dispute in the middle of the night following a \u2018first slepe\u2019 may not have been normal behaviour:\nIt chaunced that at Christmas last I was at the Court with master Ferres then master of the Kyngs maiesties pastimes about the setting forth of certaine enterludes, which for the kynges recreation we had deuised and were in learning.

Streamer who withM. willot had already slept his first slepe, and I that was newly come to bead the effect wherof was whether birdes and beastes had reason [\u2026].51\nWhile the phrase \u2018first slepe\u2019 is used here in a way that suggests a commonly understood phenomenon, it does not follow that this refers to a discrete period of sleep separated from a subsequent period by \u2018up to an hour\u2019 of wakefulness; this point is discussed in further detail below.\nIn the same vein as Davenant and Baldwin, the references to a first sleep in George Fidge\u2019sThe English Gusman do not describe normal circumstances for the middle or lower sorts. The text is a biography of the English highwayman James Hind; his \u2018first sleep\u2019 is taken \u2018by the Counter\u2019 (or compter), ie. a prison, while intoxicated.52\nHind being now come to London, did meet with many of his friends, and acquaintance, and one night being drinking in theCity, and too long staying by the good liquor, made Indentures as hewent by the Counter (a Trap to catch such Rats) was forced to take a nap before he went any further, and after his first sleep, awaked and looked about him, saying, This is a large house and may entertain many guests, but I do not intend to keep my Christmas here [\u2026].53\nA later reference to a \u2018first sleep\u2019 in the same text appears to imply that waking in the night and being unable to return to sleep was unusual: \u2018Allen [Hind\u2019s fellow outlaw, fearing capture] made as though that disturbance would not let him sleep any more that night: saying,When my first sleep is broke, I can sleep no longer: so he sends one of his servants to theHost of the house to come and drink with him\u2019.54 The fact that Allen feels the need to state \u2018When my first sleep is broke, I can sleep no longer\u2019 suggests that the alertness that follows\u2014sending to the host to start a drinking session\u2014is an exceptional rather than a routine practice. The phrase \u2018When my first sleep is broke\u2019 is itself ambiguous; it might mean that it is routine to have a break of consciousness following a \u2018first sleep\u2019, but unusual to then stay awake for the rest of the night, or that waking after a first period of sleep is not routine and may result in subsequent insomnia.\nIn other cases, the reference to a \u2018first sleep\u2019 is not accompanied by a description of a period of wakefulness between sleeps. For example, in Richard Hurst\u2019s translation of Jean Ogier de Gombauld\u2019s Endimion, it is not certain if the subject wakes up for \u2018up to an hour\u2019 during the night: \u2018I tooke my first sleepe, whichwas short and quiet: but inmy second Iwasmuch troubledwithDreames\u2019.55 Indeed, even if we assume that there is \u2018up to an hour\u2019 interval of wakefulness, this entry is not consistent with Ekirch\u2019s view that the period in between a first and second sleep was of special significance in meditating on and committing dreams to memory: here, the dreams of interest do not occur until the later part of sleep, although of course it is possible that this was an exception to a norm. In another of Ekirch\u2019s references, in which \u2018dead sleep\u2019 is taken as a synonym for \u2018first sleep\u2019\u2014James Shirley\u2019s The Constant Maid (1640)\u2014 the text reads: \u2018All people are a bed, the verie Owles/Are in their dead sleep\u2019.56 This might simply be Shirley\u2019s way of conveying the lateness of an hour at which no-one is up and about, not even night owls, rather than an indication that he believes owls have segmented sleep.\nIn brief, the phrase \u2018first sleep\u2019 is not of itself indicative of a habitual pattern of well-defined, separate periods of sleep, but might have other meanings depending on the context.

The anonymous author of the English Civil War text The Civil Wars of Bantam (1683) describes sailors \u2018dividing our selves into twoWatches, my Lot being in the first. AfterMidnight, I went to Rest with somewhat better Hopes than those that had the first Sleep; as conceiving, if they had any real Design upon us, we should have heard of it before that time.\u201958 Alternatively, \u2018first sleep\u2019might simply mean the initial period of sleep during a night of broken rest, consisting of interspersed sleep and waking. In The speeches, discourses, and prayers, of Col. John Barkstead, Col. JohnOkey, andMr.Miles Corbet, politician and regicideMiles Corbet is quoted as stating, on the day of his execution, that \u2018my first sleep [\u2026] from the time I went to bed, continued till two a clock, and I have had two sleeps since\u2019.59\n\u2018First sleep\u2019might also indicate the sleep preceding very transient, even incomplete, wakefulness: for example, in Richard Blackbourn\u2019s novel Clitie (1688), the protagonist\u2019s father experiences a significant dream during a second period of sleep after a moment of awakening: \u2018after his first Sleep (which we\u2019ll suppose was sound enough) he awak\u2019d with a certain heaviness at his Heart, unlike to any he had felt before, but he continued not long ere soft slumbers clos\u2019d his Eyes again\u2019.60 Finally, \u2018first sleep\u2019 may simply refer to the belief that sleep is deepest in the early hours. Joseph Caryl\u2019s Exposition upon the Book of Job (1656) interprets the reference to \u2018that part of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth on men\u2019 (Job 4:13) asmeaning \u2018in the former part or beginning of the night for the first sleepe is the deepe sleepe; andwe use to say that a man, especially a weary hard-wrought man, is in a dead sleepe, when he is in his first sleepe.\u201961\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that \u2018first sleep\u2019 is a phrasewith suchdiversemeanings. TheOED\u2019s definition of \u2018first\u2019 is notably capacious, indicating that the word might, in the early modern period as now, have meant \u2018earliest in time or serial order, foremost in position, rank, or importance\u2019.62 Among these possiblemeanings \u2018first\u2019might simply indicate the initial phase of something; a lyric cited from 1500 uses the phrase \u2018fyrste of wynter\u2019 to describe the opening period of the season, rather than onewinter that is followed by another: \u2018The fyrste of wynter harde se shall ye \u2026 But the latter ende of wynter ys gude\u2019. Similarly, when Philip Sidney wrote of Homer and the Greeks: \u2018as by him their learnedmen tooke almost their first light of knowledge, so their actiuemen, receiued their firstmotions of courage\u2019, he was using theword \u2018first\u2019 to refer to the initiating (and valuable) stirrings of continuous processes, not implying that the \u2018first light\u2019 and \u2018first motions\u2019 were entities separated by a gap of time from subsequent lights of knowledge or motions of courage.63\nThe existence of the contrasting term \u2018second sleep\u2019 does not necessarily imply a gap between the two periods of sleep, or, if it does, it does not mean that first and second sleeps were clearly defined and separated periods in a pattern to which the majority of people rigidly adhered. Searching EEBO for the terms \u2018second sleep/sleepe/slepe\u2019 in full text with the same parameters used above retrieves fifteen hits.64\n57EEBO is an online resource which \u2018aims to provide digital images of one copy each of the surviving books and broadsides printed in the British Isles and British North America between 1473 and 1700 and of the English-language books printed in Europe during the same period.\u2019 EEBO full-text searches are limited by their restriction to printed texts, the survival of such texts, their transcription via the Text Creation Partnership (not all books on EEBO have been transcribed) and the accuracy of these transcriptions and indexing.

Nevertheless, assuming that errors and omissions occur more or less at random (in that they are no more likely to affect the frequency of detection of one term than another), they can give a very rough indication of how common particular terms may have been in early modern print.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOf these, only five contain explicit references to both a \u2018first\u2019 and a \u2018second\u2019 sleep. In two cases, a \u2018second sleep\u2019 does not seem to mean a defined period of sleep at all. In his sermon preached to the honourable Society of Lincolns-Inne (1664), Ralph Cudworth writes:\nAnd indeed if men should be restored after death to such gross, foul and cadaverous Bodies as these are here upon Earth, which is the very Region of Death and Mortality, without any change at all; what would this be else but, as Plotinus the Philosopher against the Gnosticks writes, [\u2026] to be raised up to a Second Sleep, or to be entombed again in living Sepulchres?65\nA \u2018Second Sleep\u2019 is presented here as an undesirable absurdity; inhabiting amortal body after death is like getting up only to fall asleep again. Similarly, in William Perkins\u2019s A godlie and learned exposition upon the whole epistle of Iude (1606), the term \u2018second sleep\u2019 is used not to describe a literal segment or phase of sleep, but to indicate one of three types of \u2018spirituall sleep\u2019:\nThis spirituall sleep is three-fold: first, the naturall sleepe of heart by which euery one is ouertaken; so as by nature noman can somuch asmoue himselfe to the least good, till God awake him, and say to him, Awake thou that sleepest, and stand vp from the dead. The second sleepe is a slumber, and indeed the remainders of this naturall sleepe in the children of God, being awakened out of their dead sleepe; for euen they are ouertaken often with a spirituall slumber, by reason of remainders of sin in them. [\u2026] The third sleepe is the increase of that naturall sleepe and deadnes of heart by the custome of sinne, when as the heart is made past feeling, and altogether senselesse through continuance in sinne [.]66\nWhen a \u2018second sleep\u2019 is something that follows on a \u2018first sleep\u2019, it is not always clear that this is a routine occurrence. For example, Mo\u00efse Amyraut\u2019s Discourse concerning the divine dreams mention\u2019d in Scripture (1676) tells the story of a man who dreams of his friend\u2019s murder:\nAfter Supper, he in the private house being gone to bed, and asleep, the other appear\u2019d to him in a dream, and prayed him to come to his assistance, for as much as the Master of the Inn design\u2019d to murther him: the affright of the dream having wakened him, he rose up, but being come to himself he took it for ameer dream and idle vision, and went to sleep again. In his second sleep, the image of his friend came again into his phansie [.]67\nArguably, the man in this tale wakes not because of a routine break in sleep, but because of a terrifying dream; he rises because of \u2018affright\u2019, but falls asleep again as soon as he is \u2018come to himself\u2019.\nEven the time at which a \u2018first sleep\u2019 supposedly ends is not entirely consistent across early modern texts. KenelmDigby\u2019s Choice and experimented receipts (1675) advises: \u2018Eat of these the quantity of three or four Dates in a morning after your first sleep, and sleep an hour or two upon it before you rise\u2019, suggesting that \u2018first sleep\u2019 ends in the early hours of daylight, not midnight.68\nWhile the possibility of segmented sleep cannot be ruled out by any of these texts, they demonstrate that the meaning of the phrases \u2018first sleep\u2019 and \u2018second sleep\u2019 are not fixed. In short, the extensive references containing the term \u2018first sleep\u2019 do not of themselves provide a weight of evidence for segmented sleep as a typically understood, widespread practice in early modern Europe. There are similar problems with the use of phrases such as \u2018second sleep\u2019 and \u2018morning sleep\u2019.\n65Ralph Cudworth, A sermon preached to the honourable Society of Lincolns-Inne (London: 1664), sigs.

G7v.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSimilar issues may also arise when considering some of the evidence that Ekirch presents in other work from later periods. For example, in his 2015 paper published in Past and Present, \u2018The Modernization of Western Sleep\u2019, Ekirch writes that\nIn the early modern era, first and second sleep had generally been of equal duration, approximately three to three and a half hours apiece. But a distinct imbalance began to emerge by the mid-1800s, marked by a gradual expansion of the first phase to five or six hours at the expense of the second. [\u2026] Toward the end of the century, if not earlier, second sleep often did not commence until dawn or later, depending upon the season. \u2018How long does our \u201cfirst sleep\u201d last?\u2019 asked a British paper in 1891. According to the renowned psychiatrist Sir James Crichton Browne, the ideal was eight hours for \u2018actively working brains\u2019.69\nHowever, a fuller quotation from the cited text gives a slightly different picture. It reads:\nHow long does our \u2018first sleep\u2019 last? Sir James Crichton Browne [\u2026] told his hearers that ordinary sleep grows deeper for the first hour and a half, and then steadily diminishes until the slumberer awakens. Dr. Browne pleads for eight hours for actively working brains [.]70\nIt is therefore unclear whether Crichton-Browne is referring to the first phase of sleep of 90 minutes or the consolidated block of sleep of 8 hours as the \u2018first sleep\u2019. The reading that Crichton-Browne is using \u2018first sleep\u2019 to refer to a relatively short but beneficial first phase of sleep, as opposed to referring to an eight-hour \u2018first sleep\u2019 is reinforced by a later essay, in which he writes:\nIt is but reasonable to suppose that the recuperative power of sleep is proportionate to its intensity, and it appears therefore that experiment confirms that popular belief that the \u2018first sweet sleep of night,\u2019 or the \u2018beauty sleep,\u2019 as it is popularly called, is the best, and that one hour\u2019s sleep before midnight is more restorative than two hours after it. It is probable that the curve of intensity of sleep varies somewhat with the individual and with surrounding circumstances, but it may be laid down as a general rule that it is in the first part of a night\u2019s sleep that the products of fatigue aremost rapidly removed from the brain and that repairs are most promptly executed, and in the case of children the ground cleared for growth. It follows that it is that part of the night\u2019s sleep that should be most jealously guarded and kept tranquil and free from sensory disturbances, and that it is peculiarly important that it should be secured unbroken to children. [My emphasis]71\nIn other words, \u2018first sleep\u2019 is being used here to describe a first phase of sleep of an hour or two before midnight that is thought to be particularly beneficial, with no evidence that this is necessarily followed by a period of wakefulness. It is doubtful that Crichton-Browne is referring in his 1891 lecture to an eighthour extended \u2018first sleep\u2019. Terms such as \u2018first sleep\u2019, \u2018dead sleep\u2019, \u2018second sleep\u2019 and \u2018morning sleep\u2019 should therefore invite cautious interpretation whenever they are found, whether in pre- or postindustrial texts.\nNocturnal activity in early modern England\nAs noted above, broken sleep was experienced commonly in the early modern period, as it is today. The question remains as to whether the textual evidence cited by Ekirch suggests a general pattern of a period of \u2018up to an hour\u2019 of wakefulness, as opposed to a more diverse picture of transitory waking, or waking because of specific professional or personal pressures (for example, to do housework or for religious\n69Ekirch, op. cit. (note 11), 15. 70\u2018This Morning\u2019s News\u2019, Daily News (London), 6 March 1891. 71James Crichton-Browne, Stray Leaves from a Physician\u2019s Portfolio (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1927), 127.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nreasons). For example, while Ekirch quotes a line fromGeorgeWither\u2019s Iuvenilia (1633) \u2013 \u2018Atmid-night when thou wak\u2019st from sleepe\u2019 \u2013 to demonstrate that wakefulness at night was normalised, putting this excerpt in context reveals a more complex picture. The poem concerns \u2018Presumption\u2019, and Wither is attempting to stir the subject\u2019s guilty conscience, emphasising the terror and isolation of the night:\nReader, if this do no impression leaue, So that thou canst not any feare conceiue Through this description; thinke vpont at night Soone in thy bed when earth\u2019s depriu\u2019d of light I say at mid-night when thou wak\u2019st from sleepe, And lonely darknesse doth in silence keep The Grim-fac\u2019t night.72\nAll that can be gleaned from this text is that the sleep of the reader might be broken, whether from external causes such as noise, internal feelings of guilt or for no particular reason. It is true that one interpretation of this text is consistent with Ekirch\u2019s idea of first and second sleeps; however, at the risk of repetition, other readings are possible, and incidences of unwanted broken sleep cannot always be clearly distinguished from routinely segmented sleep.\nSimilarly, Ekirch writes that \u2018in the view of John Locke, \u201cThat all men sleep by intervals\u201d was a common feature of life\u2019; however, other readings are possible when the quotation is placed in context.73 The relevant section of Locke\u2019s An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding (1690) concerns the impossibility of pronouncing absolute knowledge on man:\n[W]e cannot with Certainty affirm, That all Men sleep by intervals; That no Man can be nourished by Wood or Stones; That all Men will be poisoned by Hemlock: because these Ideas have no connexion nor repugnancywith this our nominal Essence ofMan, with this abstract Idea thatName stands for.74\nThe passage in question uses human sleep patterns in passing as an example, rather than specifically focusing on this topic. While one reading of it is congruent with Ekirch\u2019s argument\u2014sleeping \u2018by intervals\u2019 is, like the absence of wood- and stone-based diets, a self-evident, if ultimately unprovable truth \u2014Locke is vague regarding what sort of interval he means and how long such intervals last. He could mean that segmented sleep is universal; he could mean that sleep is often subject to transient interruptions; or his meaning could be that people alternate between wakefulness during the day and unconsciousness at night. Elsewhere, Locke refers to individuals \u2018who sleep out whole stormy Nights, without hearing the Thunder\u2019, which is not suggestive of segmented sleep as the norm.75 In brief, multiple meanings were attached to the terminology around sleep, resulting in confusion for the modern-day reader about what constituted \u2018normal\u2019 sleep (or even if such norms existed). Ambiguous evidence which might refer to segmented sleep, or simply something very like broken sleep as we would recognise it today, is not made clearer or stronger by its accretion.\nEkirch\u2019s description, as noted above, paints a picture of the early modern night as a time of activity and even sociability, an opportunity afforded by segmented sleep: \u2018Families rose from their beds to urinate, smoke tobacco, and even visit close neighbors. Remaining abed, many persons also made love, prayed, and, most important, reflected on the dreams that typically preceded waking from their \u201cfirst sleep\u201d.\u201976 But it is not clear that these activities were either common in practice or communal in nature.\n72George Wither, Iuvenilia (London: 1633), sig. M12r. 73Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 365; (note 11), 154. 74John Locke, An essay concerning humane understanding (London: 1690), sig. Qq1v. 75Ibid., sig. P4v. 76Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 344.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFor example, urination in the night is indeed mentioned in medical texts such as Andrew Boorde\u2019s Compendyous Regyment (1547); however, getting out of bed to urinate is not an activity unique to preindustrial societies, and the passage as a whole suggests that the individual will alternate between sleep and brief periods of waking, rather than experiencing two distinct segments of sleep:\nwhan you be in your bed lye a lytel whyle on your left syde, & slepe on your ryght syde. And whan you do wake of your fyrste slepe make water yf you fele your bladder charged, and then slepe on the lefte syde, and loke as ofte as you do wake so ofte tourne your selfe in the bed from the one syde to the other.77\nIn other words, the passage could suggest that people in the early modern period might have expected to wake periodically; the ending of the first period of sleep may have been one such occasion (and been accompanied by the need to urinate), and the phrase \u2018as ofte as you dowake\u2019 suggests that theremay have been other brief moments of consciousness during the night. Boorde\u2019s advice was to use such occasions to turn and sleep on the other side. One possibility is that Boorde is distinguishing between a \u2018up to an hour\u2019 of wakefulness following a \u2018fyrste slepe\u2019 that should be used to discharge the bladder, and later, briefer moments used simply to turn in bed. It is also possible that \u2018as ofte as you do wake\u2019 refers to the moment of waking after a first sleep across a series of nights, rather than multiple incidences of waking within the same night. It may, however, also be a passage that reflects the idiosyncrasies of individual sleep patterns, rather than providing evidence for a standardised time for nocturnal urination, as \u2018families\u2019 or otherwise.\nEkirch\u2019s other examples of nocturnal activity again suggest a diversity of patterns of sleep and activity based on individual circumstances, rather than a common period of \u2018up to an hour\u2019 of wakefulness.78 The legal depositions that Ekirch cites refer to individuals rising from bed for a specific purpose\u2014for example, studying, checking for marauding cows, stealing things, or leaving the house with other illicit or criminal plans\u2014and do not demonstrate that these episodes of activity were part of a normal night\u2019s sleep pattern. Furthermore, the statement that \u2018women left their beds to perform myriad chores\u2019 elides \u2018women\u2019 with \u2018servants\u2019: one example cited is the deposition of a servant rising to brew malt, and the other a protest poem bymanual labourerMary Collier.79 In other words, these are examples of nocturnal activity made necessary by an individual\u2019s social and professional position, rather than spontaneous activity during a natural break in sleep.\nThere is, of course, the question as to how people in the early modern period would have woken up without the aid of alarm clocks. Sasha Handley has suggested factors such as the orientation of beds facing east to catch the sun\u2019s rays, and external noises (for example, from animals) may helped to wake people in the morning. Although these could have ensured early rising in the summer months, it is less likely that they would have worked in the dark winter mornings. Another factor might simply have been a mixture of motivation and habituation; Handley suggests that this might have aided spiritually influenced early rising. This topic requires further research; however, for the purposes of the present article, it is sufficient to note that domestic staff of the early modern period were obliged to rise in the night and did so, and that this fact does not of itself present evidence for segmented sleep. The degree of obligation and compulsion experienced by servants means that it is hard to ascertain how spontaneous their early morning waking might have been.80\nWhile Ekirch writes\u2014qualifying his earlier statement \u2018Families rose from their beds\u2019\u2014that \u2018Most people, upon awakening, probably never left their beds unless to relieve their bladders, if then\u2019, he also\n77Andrew Boorde, Compendyous Regyment (London: 1547), sig. C1v. 78Theword \u2018common\u2019 is used here following Ekirch\u2019s own use of the term in \u2018SleepWeHave Lost\u2019 (note 1), 365: \u2018in the view of John Locke, \u201cThat all men sleep by intervals\u201d was a common feature of life\u2019. 79Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 370. 80For Handley\u2019s comments, see Emma Bryce, \u2018How Did People Wake Up Before Alarm Clocks?\u2019, Live Science, 3 November 2018. <https://www.livescience.com/64002-how-wake-up-before-alarm-clocks.html> [Accessed 5 September 2022].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/mdh.2023.14 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsuggests that the early modern night might have been at least somewhat sociable. \u2018Besides praying\u2019, he writes, the people of the early modern period \u2018conversed with a bedfellow or inquired about the wellbeing of a child or spouse.\u201981 Depositions and diaries support the existence of nocturnal conversations: however, these confirm that people did indeed wake up in the night, but not necessarily that this was part of a common pattern of \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleep separated by a period of \u2018up to an hour\u2019.\nEkirch also points to a print by Dutch artist Jan Saenredram, Night (c. 1595), which shows nocturnal activity, in this case a wife adjusting her husband\u2019s bedding.82 But as with the textual evidence, this picture also provides evidence for a counter-argument. First, the wife is the only person awake in the room, while her husband andmaid sleep: thus, interrupted sleep is not depicted as a social phenomenon, accompanied by nocturnal conversation or inquiry. All that we as twenty-first-century viewers can tell from the picture is that the wife has woken up, with no indication as to how long this period of wakefulness will last or what behavioural norms attend such an event. Second, the inscription at the foot of the picture indicates that the purpose of the picture is to depict night as a time of peace, not as a moment of activity between sleeps: \u2018Nocte vacant curis animi, placidamque quietem/ Percipiunt, gratoque indulgent omnia somno\u2019; \u2018At night minds are free from cares, they perceive placidity and quiet, and they indulge all things in welcome sleep.\u201983 This is a vignette of a period of solitary, perhaps brief, wakefulness, against a general backdrop of oblivion. Even if the inscription has an ironic flavour, given the depiction of a wife attending to her sleeping husband\u2019s comfort, this nevertheless reinforces the ideal of the night as a time of \u2018placidity and quiet\u2019. Furthermore, the height of the fire in the grate\u2014as opposed to burned-down wood or coals\u2014casts doubt on what time precisely is represented here. While it would be unlikely that a single image could make a conclusive case for segmented sleep, it is unclear in what way this specific picture supports the theory of \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleeps separated by \u2018up to an hour\u2019."

            "text": "The model of segmented pre-modern sleep proposed by Roger Ekirch two decades ago has been widely accepted by historians, literary scholars and the general public. However, the scientific and anthropological evidence presented in support of thismodel is selective and limited.While the evidence from early modern texts is impressive in its breadth, close analysis reveals a significant degree of ambiguity and nuance that argues against a routinely segmented sleeping pattern as the sole or even the main meaning attributable to references to the \u2018first sleep\u2019, \u2018dead sleep\u2019 or \u2018second sleep\u2019. The \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 sleeps might simply represent different phases of a continuous process of sleep; if there was a gap, it might have been so short as to be insignificant in terms of offering opportunities for nocturnal activity; nocturnal activity in any case might have related more to the specific circumstances of the individual (for example, domestic service) rather than being a generalised, society-wide phenomenon. Some texts might simply be describing disturbed sleep \u2013 a feature not unique to the early modern world \u2013 and, in some cases, the inability to return to sleep after waking, which would today be classified as middle or terminal insomnia. Evidence from printed sources, meanwhile, indicates that the terms \u2018first sleep\u2019 and \u2018second sleep\u2019 held more than onemeaning, and that each individual use of the term needs contextualisation bothwithin the early modern text itself and preferably with collateral information regarding the author and circumstances of the specific text\u2019s production.\nThe present reconsideration of the segmented sleep theory has limitations. The sheer volume of literary sources cited by Ekirch wouldmake re-analysis of every citation prohibitively long. However, the examples quoted here illustrate that reading these sources without the assumption of segmented sleep as\n81Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 371. 82Ekirch, op. cit. (note 1), 371\u2013372.

Moreover, to reiterate a point made above, ambiguous sources are not made any less ambiguous through collation. Constructing models of the early modern night is, by nature, a tentative, limited and ambiguous process; the readings which this article proposes are undoubtedly open to further revision.\nThere are two main implications of this research. First, there is a greater diversity of interpretation of sleep-related texts than might be assumed from the widely accepted segmented sleep model. Segmented sleep may have been practised by some individuals; however, it was not the sole or even necessarily the predominant model of sleep in the early modern period. Second, literary critics and cultural historians should look beyond the assumption that segmented sleep was routine when examining important aspects of nocturnal early modern culture, such as the experience of dreaming. Ekirch\u2019s work has proved hugely valuable to the fields of early modern cultural history, the history of medicine and modern-day sleep studies in both collating a huge amount of material and questioning basic assumptions about human sleeping patterns. The intention of the present article is to prompt new, detailed and complex readings of this and other work related to early modern sleeping and dreaming.\nAcknowledgements.
