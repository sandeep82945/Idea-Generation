Since two quantum states that are local unitary (LU) equivalent have the same amount of entanglement, it is meaningful to find a practical method to determine the LU equivalence of given quantum states. In this paper, we present a valid process to find the unitary tensor product decomposition for an arbitrary unitary matrix. Then, by using this process, the conditions for determining the local unitary equivalence of quantum states are obtained. A numerical verification is carried out, which shows the practicability of our protocol. We also present a property of LU invariants by using the universality of quantum gates which can be used to construct the complete set of LU invariants. 1. conclusions In this paper, we have studied the local unitary equivalence of quantum systems from the perspective of unitary matrix tensor decomposition. We have presented a detailed process to find the unitary matrices in the tensor decomposition of an arbitrary tensorfactorable unitary matrix. We have also derived a property of LU invariants that may be used to find a complete set of LU invariants. It should be noted that our schemes are convenient to discuss the local unitary equivalence when the number and the dimension of the subsystems are small
