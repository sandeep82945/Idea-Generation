    "abstractText": "Polymeric nanoparticles are one method to modify the drug release of small hydrophilic molecules. In this study, clindamycin HCl was used as a model drug loaded in carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles cross-linked with Ca2+ ions (CMCS-Ca2+). The ultrasonication with experimental design was used to produce CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles loading clindamycin HCl. The model showed that the size of nanoparticles decreased when amplitude and time increased. The nanoparticle size of 318.40 \u00b1 7.56 nm, decreased significantly from 543.63 \u00b1 55.07 nm (p < 0.05), was obtained from 75% of amplitude and 180 s of time, which was one of the optimal conditions. The clindamycin loading content in this condition was 34.68 \u00b1 2.54%. The drug content in nanoparticles showed an inverse relationship with the size of the nanoparticles. The sodium carboxymethylcellulose film loading clindamycin HCl nanoparticles exhibited extended release with 69.88 \u00b1 2.03% drug release at 60 min and a gradual increase to 94.99 \u00b1 4.70% at 24 h, and demonstrated good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and C. acne with 40.72 \u00b1 1.23 and 48.70 \u00b1 1.99 mm of the zone of inhibition at 24 h, respectively. Thus, CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles produced by the ultrasound-assisted technique could be a potential delivery system to modify the drug release of small hydrophilic antibiotics.",

            "text": "Presently, nanotechnology is one of the most interesting trends for several industries, such as pharmaceutical and cosmetic. Polymeric nanoparticles are normally defined as particles in a range of 10\u20131000 nm. The polymeric nanoparticle can be loaded with active compounds by an entrapment within or surface-adsorption onto the polymeric core [1\u20133]. Compared with conventional dosage forms, nanoparticles are used to improve drug solubility, increase drug stability, design drug-target delivery and modify controlled release [4]. The polymeric nanoparticle could be prepared by natural polymers, such as alginate, chitosan, collagen, and cellulose, and/or synthetic polymers, such as polylactic\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14091736 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736 2 of 20\nacid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA). However, natural polymers are outstanding due to the biocompatibility and biodegradability. Chitosan is a linear natural polymer obtained from deacetylation of chitin. It consists of d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine subunits [5]. It is a material of choice for nanoparticle preparation because it possesses suitable properties, for example, biodegradability, biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and ability for physical and chemical modification [6]. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) consists of active hydroxyl (\u2013OH), carboxyl (\u2013COOH), and amine (\u2013NH2) groups in the molecule (Figure 1a). Carboxyl groups refer to the amino and/or hydroxyl groups in chitosan molecules to enhance the solubility in water around neutral pH. CMCS has a wide range of applications in adsorption, drug delivery, biomedicine, cosmetics, food preservatives, biosensors, and emulsion stabilization [7]. At pH \u2265 7, the carboxylic groups (\u2013COOH) in CMCS molecules were deprotonated and changed to anion form (\u2013COO\u2212) that can interact with calcium ion (Ca2+) to form particles. The suitable pH to produce CMCS cross-linked with Ca2+ (CMCS-Ca2+) nanoparticles was 7\u20139. In addition, CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles were most stable at pH 7\u20138 and could be applied for controlled release substances [8]. Nanoscale particles could be prepared by ionic-crosslinking, such as CMCS-Ca2+ crosslinking and covalent-crosslinking. The drawback of the covalent bonding is potentially the toxic residue due to unreacted covalent-crosslinking agents. To avoid this problem, non-toxic cross-linkers, such as salts as well as Ca2+, may be used as ionic cross-linkers. Furthermore, the medium of CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles is water, which is totally non-toxic. Some studies applied CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles to entrap active substances for controlled release. For example, the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles loading doxorubicin HCl showed suitable size, narrow size distribution, potential drug entrapment, and controlled release [9]. In another study, the nanoparticles loading curcumin, prepared by CMCS-Ca2+ cross-linking, exhibited spherical nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 150 nm, high drug loading, controlled release, and non-toxicity property [10]. There are several tools which could aid in producing nanoparticles. Ultrasound is a simple, fast, green, and reproducible method to produce nanoparticles [11]. Ultrasound is longitude wavelength in a frequency of 20 kHz\u201310 MHz. In ultrasonication, the main phenomenon is acoustic cavitation, which creates, grows, and collapses bubbles in less than nanoseconds [12]. Generally, nanoparticles are required to be in a well-dispersed state. Usually, conventional technologies such as stirred media mills to disperse particles into liquids is insufficient, because the nanoparticles strongly agglomerate; thus high specific energy inputs are required to overcome the adhesive forces. Compared with conventional techniques, ultrasound is one way to break down the agglomeration of nanoparticles in aqueous dispersions [13]. The ultrasound was successfully used for preparing polymeric nanoparticles, such as poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), starch, chitosan and chitosan- pentasodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles [14\u201317]. The studies reported that the particle size and polydispersity index after chitosan nanoparticle preparation with ionic cross-linking could be decreased by increasing sonication time and radiation amplitude [15]. Clindamycin is a small antibacterial molecule and an effective antibacterial agent against several pathogens, such as Staphylococci, Streptococci, Pneumococci, most anaerobic bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis, and some protozoa. Clindamycin is a bacteriostatic antibacterial agent with inhibiting 50 s ribosomal activity. This drug\u2019s mechanism inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Clindamycin is used for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [18]. Thus, it is usually used for topical antibacterial application. Clindamycin is practically insoluble in water; however, clindamycin hydrochloride (HCl) is a freely soluble salt form of clindamycin (Figure 1b). Hence, in this study, clindamycin HCl was selected and used as a model drug of small hydrophilic antibacterial molecules, such that drugs naturally could not provide sustained release patterns [19]. Furthermore, a hydrophilic antibiotic usually exhibits fast release, and the drug concentration, which should be over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), thus decreases. A lower concentration of the drug\u2019s MIC can induce antibacterial resistance and users have to take medicines several times per day to keep the level of drug concentration, which might decrease patient compli-\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736 3 of 20\nance [20]. Extended release of the drug has a potential to resolve this problem. Thus, many drug carriers to provide extended antibiotic release have been developed for antibiotic delivery. In recent years, the topical delivery of antibiotics in the form of nanoparticle drug carriers has demonstrated the efficacy to cure bacterial infections. Nanoparticles are a promising drug delivery system that facilitates the extended release of antibiotics [21]. In addition, encapsulation of the drug in a nanoparticle could also enable the extended release of hydrophilic antibiotics [19,22].\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 22 hydrophilic antibiotic usually exhibits fast release, and the drug concentration, which should be over the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), thus decreases.

Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) is a semi synthetic ether cellulose derivative with carboxymethyl substitution (Figure 1c). It is commonly used in oral and topical\npharmaceutical formulations and in antibacterial applications with high drug loading ca-\npacity as hydrogel and film formulation. Moreover, SCMC is able to immobilize Pseudo-\nmonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus within its cohesive gel structure. Hydrophilic\nfilms can be used for the local delivery of active agents such as antimicrobials substances\nloaded in nanoparticles for infection prevention and treatment [23,24]. SCMC films con-\ntaining various nanoparticles were also used for an antibacterial application and they showed potential antibacterial activity [23,25]. In this present study, clindamycin HCl-\nloaded in CMCS cross-linked with Ca2+ nanoparticles were prepared using the ultrasound-\nassisted technique. The CMCS- Ca2+ nanoparticle containing clindamycin HCl was loaded\ninto SCMC film. This study aimed to investigate the optimal condition and effect of ultra-\nsonication to reduce particle size, drug release, and antibacterial property of the SCMC\nfilm containing the nanoparticles, and also evaluate the possibility of CMCS to be a carrier\nfor extended-release of small hydrophilic antibacterial molecules for an antibacterial ap-\nplication.\nFigure 1.

In this pH, carboxylic groups are in\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736 7 of 20\nanion forms that are suitable to interact with Ca2+ in the solution [8]. The pH of the solution during preparation is a crucial factor to determine particle size. At a pH of 7\u20138, the CMCSCa2+ is most stable where CMCS is in negative charge (-COO\u2212) as majority and in positive charge (NH3+) as minority. Thus, the CMCS could interact with Ca2+ to form nanoparticles and the positive charge in molecules prevents agglomeration. In addition, a concentration of CaCl2 seems to be essential since particle size tended to be larger when Ca2+ increased in the system [8]. These factors should be controlled because they affect the stability, degradation, and drug release. The CMCS-Ca2+ containing clindamycin HCl without an ultrasound-assisted treatment exhibited around 543.63 nm mean particle diameter. On the other hand, the CMCS-Ca2+ containing clindamycin HCl treated by ultrasonication showed a particle size around 320 to 490 nm. It indicated that ultrasonication can reduce particle size of CMCS-Ca2+ containing clindamycin HCl. The previous study also found that the ultrasound-assisted technique can decreased mean particle diameter [15]."

The significance of F-value of the model implies that there is only a 0.01% chance that standard deviation could occur due to noise. The result obtained from analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a statistically significant difference of coefficients of amplitude and time between groups (p < 0.0001), as shown in Table 1. Almost all model terms were significant (p < 0.0001) except amplitude \u00d7 time (AB). There was no significant interaction between amplitude and time. The adjusted R2 (0.9820) was a reasonable agreement with predicted R2 (0.9627) because the difference between both R2 was less than 0.2. The model displayed high adequate precision (32.2313), which is measured by ratio between signal and noise and should be less than 4, indicating the model can be used to navigate the design space. The graph plotted between predicted and actual responses displayed that the model provided the predicted particle size approximately and the actual particle size with high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9895) of the plot (Figure 2a). The plot between residuals and run number showed an irregular trend (Figure 2b). These results indicated that the model could be used to predict the size of nanoparticles obtained from the ultrasound-assisted treatment. The equation obtained from the model was shown in Equation (2).\nSize = +886.72784 \u2212 12.63258 \u00d7 amplitude \u2212 0.704668 \u00d7 time \u2212 0.001781 \u00d7 amplitude \u00d7 time + 0.085359 \u00d7 amplitude2 + 0.001701 \u00d7 time2 (2)\nThe size of nanoparticles obtained from various experiments was shown in Table 2. The actual values were not significantly different from the predicted value (p > 0.05) in t-test. It indicated that the model was accurate and could predict the mean diameter of nanoparticles. From the software, the standard deviation of predicted values was 7.70 nm. The contour plot and 3D response surface plot exhibited effects of amplitude and time on nanoparticle size. In a range of experiments, the contour plot and 3D response surface obviously showed that the size of nanoparticles tended to decrease when amplitude and time increased. This trend corresponded to Tang et al. [15] and Esmaeilzadeh-Gharedaghi et al. [17], summarizing that the use of ultrasound with increasing amplitude and duration could decrease mean diameter of chitosan particles. When ultrasonication is applied, the main mechanism to reduce particle size is the formation of acoustic cavitation, occurring all over the solution. This phenomenon generates very high shear force and breaks the particles into smaller ones possessing fewer chitosan chains in each particle [12]. The effect of amplitude may be also explained by the mechanism of ultrasound. The stronger ultrasound radiation led to smaller particle size due to breaking more particles apart and an increase of the cavitation effect due to longer exposure to ultrasonic radiation. Thus, longer ultrasonication time provides smaller particle sizes. The previous study found that the size of chitosan nanoparticles prepared by ionic cross-linking was reduced with increasing duration of ultrasonication [16]. There were other factors affecting the size of CMCS nanoparticles, for instance the pH of the solution and concentration of chitosan. The pH of CMCS solutions in this study was fixed at 8 because it\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736 8 of 20\nwas the most suitable pH with high amounts of carboxylic anion to interact with Ca2+ [8]. In another study, it was found that increasing the concentration of chitosan at fixed duration increased the obtained nanoparticle size. However, when time and amplitude are high enough, the concentration of chitosan has an insignificant effect on the mean diameter of the obtained nanoparticles [17]. These indicated that amplitude and time were the most important input parameters to reduce the size of nanoparticles. In addition, the plateau trend was observed in the blue area of the contour plot and 3D response surface (Figure 3). It showed the minimum size which could be obtained from the ultrasound-assisted technique. In this study, the ultrasound-assisted technique reached a limit to reduce particle size at around 320 nm (blue color in Figure 3). For example, the obtained particle size from 65% of amplitude at 200 s was not significantly different to 75% of amplitude and 180 s of duration (p > 0.05) (Table 3). This could be explained by the theory that in chitosan molecules some bonds are weak and broken simply, but other bonds are strong and resistant against applied energies in the experiments [29]. Another reason was the use of Ca2+ cross-linker forming polymer chain structures, that prevent breaking particles from becoming smaller ones. Another study also found that the use of tripolyphosphate as the cross-linker for chitosan nanoparticles resisted breaking particles of ultrasonication [17]. Overall, to obtain nanoparticles around the size of 320 nm, the ultrasonication should be performed at a high value of amplitude, such as 70%, and higher intermediate to high duration, such as 180 and 270 s. Thus, in this study, the selected condition obtained from experimental design was 75% of amplitude and 180 s of time providing a particle size of about 318 nm, which was insignificantly different from the predicted value (323.65 nm) (Table 3).\n(b)\nFigure 2.

The particle size of all experimental order and from the predictable model in the range of investigation showed that the mean diameter was about 310 to 500 nm. Polymeric nanoparticles were solid or colloidal particles in a range of 10\u20131000 nm [1\u20133]. Thus, the obtained particles in this study complied with the definition of a polymeric nanoparticle. Meanwhile, the particle size from the non-assisted ultrasound technique was 543.63 \u00b1 55.07 nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) values of experimental order were in a range of 0.2\u20130.5, while that of the particles obtained from the non-assisted ultrasound technique was 1.000. The PDI of all experiments was less than 0.7, indicating that the size distribution of nanoparticles was suitable. PDI is used to describe the degree of non-uniformity of size distribution of particles; where a value more than 0.7 indicates heterogeneity of particle size distribution [30]. The ultrasoundassisted technique not only decreased particle size, but also increased the uniformity of nanoparticles. Nanoparticle size has an impact on the chemical properties of nanoparticles. Smaller particles have higher surface energy than larger particles. Thus, smaller particles agglomerate faster than higher particles [31]. However, in our study, the positive charge of -NH3+ is able to prevent agglomeration with an electrostatic effect. Similarly, increased degradation rates of nanoparticles are dependent on the decrease of particle size because high surface area to volume ratio contributes to a larger portion of the material exposed to media [32,33]. Hence, drug release might be more rapid in smaller nanoparticles. However, degradation and stability of nanoparticles not only depends on particle size, but also molecular weight, chemical structure, glass-transition temperature, degradation products, and crystallinity [31]. Importantly, small nanoparticles are crucial for antibacterial activity because smaller nanoparticles exhibited more effective antibacterial activity than larger particles [34]."

The peak at 2900 cm\u22121 relates to the axial stretching of the C-H bond of -CH2 group. The weak peak at 1723 cm\u22121 corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of C=O in the -COOH groups. The two strong peaks at 1591 and 1417 cm\u22121 are specific for stretching of COO\u2212 for carboxylic (-COOH) and for carboxymethyl (-CH2COOH) groups, respectively. The peak at 1310 cm\u22121 relates to the symmetric angular deformation of the C-H bond. The peaks in the range of 1129 to 811 cm\u22121 relate to the C-O and C-O-C of the compositions in a polysaccharide chain [35\u201337]. Interestingly, in the spectrum of CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles containing clindamycin HCl (Figure 4b), the intensity of the peaks corresponding to carboxylic and carboxymethyl at 1591 and 1417 cm\u22121 decreased and both peaks shifted to 1574 and 1421 cm\u22121, respectively. This finding indicated an interaction between -COO\u2212 of CMCS and Ca2+ in the cross-linking solution [38]. The FTIR spectrum of clindamycin HCl (Figure 4c) showed characteristic peaks of C-H stretching at 2900 cm\u22121, C=O stretching at 1681 cm\u22121, C=C stretching at 1548 cm\u22121, and C-O stretching at 1249 and 1041 cm\u22121 [39,40]. In the spectrum of CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles containing clindamycin HCl, the characteristic peaks of clindamycin HCl still appeared and slightly shifted to 1215 and 1037 cm\u22121, which indicated that clindamycin HCl was incorporated into the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles without changing the general structure. This result was also observed in the FTIR spectrum of clindamycin HCl loaded in polylactic acid (PLA) nanoparticles and in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers, which are hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers, respectively [39,41]. However, the peak of -OH groups of clindamycin HCl at 3250 cm\u22121 was broader and shifted to 3268 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles containing clindamycin HCl. Moreover, this region is associated with -OH and -NH2 groups of CMCS. In fact, hydrogen bonding formation is marked by band shifting and/or broadening as well as band intensity variation of the relevant bands. A characteristic broad band from 3680 to 2985 cm\u22121 corresponds to different hydrogenbonded OH groups [42]. Thus, -OH groups in clindamycin HCl molecule possibly interact with hydrophilic groups, such as \u2013OH, to form a hydrophilic interaction or hydrogen bond. The spectrum of the physical mixture (Figure 4d) showed similar peaks to those found in CMCS and clindamycin HCl, such as the peak of carboxylic (-COOH) of CMCS at 1591 cm\u22121, and the peak of C-O stretching of clindamycin HCl at 1249 and 1041 cm\u22121; although the peaks of each starting material overlapped. The spectrum of CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles with clindamycin HCl was quite similar to the physical mixture, but some peaks altered location as well as intensity, and were broader due to the interactions between CMCS and Ca2+, and CMCS and the drug in the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles.

For example, when the particle size decreased from 478.40 (Exp. 1) to 321.40 nm (Exp. 2), the drug content significantly dropped from 46.88% to 33.30%. This profile was also observed in hyaluronic acid nanoparticle loading clindamycin phosphate. The entrapped clindamycin phosphate content increased with the rise of hyaluronic acid nanoparticles [43]. Previous studies concluded that high intensity ultrasonication damaged chitosan nanoparticles. The damage affected the function of the drug carrier. Both long duration and high intensity could partially depolymerize polymer chains to become smaller fragments [15,44]. Theoretically, the drug with hydrophilic groups could be physically entrapped in a hydrophilic polymer with hydrogen bonding and ionic interaction [9,19]. In this study, clindamycin HCl, containing -OH groups, could form hydrogen bonds with hydrophilic groups of CMCS (-OH and -COOH), but this interaction might not be sufficiently strong enough to resist the ultrasonication. The encapsulated drug in nanoparticles might leak out from the particle structures due to the degradation of nanoparticles and drug\u2013polymer hydrogen bonding. Hence, it was possible that in this study, smaller nanoparticles obtained from higher amplitude and longer duration might exhibit lower drug content. Some factors also influenced the drug content, such as the drug content increased when the molecular weight (MW) of CMCS increased. Less Ca2+ is required to form a structure. Therefore, there were more carboxylic groups left for interaction with a drug. Furthermore, compared with the lower MW CMCS, the higher MW with a longer chain could encapsulate drugs with physical interactions, such as adsorption and entrapment. Another factor was a degree of substitution (DS), the higher DS of CMCS had more functional groups to interact with a drug [9]. The drug content in this study was not too low when compared with the study of Shi et al. [9], which exhibited 10\u201340% doxorubicin content in CMCS-Ca2+. Although drug content in the selected experiment (Exp. 16) was 34.68 \u00b1 1.45%, which was lower than the drug content in larger nanoparticles, the smaller nanoparticles tended to exhibit higher antimicrobial effects than the larger nanoparticles [34].\nNote: Different superscript letters and symbols in the same columns of mean diameter and drug content, respectively indicate significant difference (p < 0.05) between each Exp. order."

An accumulation of clindamycin HCl was clearly visible on the film surface (Figure 6c,d). Therefore, the release of clindamycin HCl might involve a superficial sequestering of clindamycin HCl located on the film surface and subsequent release of the drug from the SCMC matrix during the swelling of the polymer. After reaching the peak of release at 60 min, the percentage of the drug released was steady throughout the following 48 h. The fast drug release could be explained by the hydrophilic property of the drug. Clindamycin HCl is very soluble in water; thus it dissolves and releases immediately when the SCMC film comes into contact with water and swells [28]. Furthermore, SCMC and other compositions in the formulation, are hydrophilic in nature, which could swell and dissolve in water. In previous studies, more hydrophilic hydrogels exhibited higher swelling index and drug release [46,47]. It was possible that hydrophilic films, such as the SCMC films, released a high drug content immediately. The burst release of a hydrophilic drug from a hydrophilic polymeric film could be obviously delayed by polyelectrolyte complex technique. For example, chitosan/alginate polyelectrolyte complex film loading clindamycin phosphate showed the ability to delay the burst release of the hydrophilic drug. This is possibly due to a complexation between negative charged alginate (-COO\u2212) and the positive charge of chitosan (-NH3+) and Ca2+ [48]. Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 22\n3.10. Antibacterial Activity\nThe antibacterial activity of clindamycin HCl solution, SCMC-CM-powder film, and\nSCMC-CM-nano film against S. aureus and C. acne is shown in Figure 8. All of the samples\ncontained the same amount of clindamycin HCl (1%). Overall, the zone of inhibition\nagainst S. aureus and C. acne increased with time. The blank SCMC film did not possess\nantibacterial activity against both of the tested bacteria because SCMC do not have any\nantibacterial activity [23]. Clindamycin HCl solution along with SCMC-CM-powder and\nSCMC-CM-nano films exhibited antibacterial activity because, generally, clindamycin\nHCl has the potential to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and C. acne [53]. In antibacterial\nactivity against S. aureus (Figure 8a), the zone of inhibition of all of the samples were not\nobserved at 3 h. The SCMC-CM-nano film showed the zone of inhibition as significantly\nlower (p < 0.05) than the clindamycin HCl solution and SCMC-CM-powder film at 6, 9,\nand 12 h. This might be the effect of the extended release of the SCMC-CM-nano film with\na gradual release of the drug that was observed in the drug release profile (Figure 6).\nHowever, at 24 h, the zones of inhibition of the SCMC-CM-nano film increased to be sig-\nnificantly equivalent (p > 0.05) to the clindamycin HCl and SCMC-CM-powder film (40.72\n\u00b1 1.23, 41.81 \u00b1 0.60 and 42.83 \u00b1 0.97 mm, respectively). The zone of inhibition against C.\nacne was not generated in all of the samples at 3 and 6 h. The zone of inhibition of the\nSCMC-CM-nano film against C. acne was not significantly different from the clindamycin\nHCl solution and SCMC-CM-powder film throughout the experiment (Figure 8b). At 24\nh, the clindamycin HCl solution, SCMC-CM-powder, and SCMC-CM-nano films exhib-\nited insignificant differences (p > 0.05) of the zone of inhibition to each other (49.49 \u00b1 1.65,\n49.97 \u00b1 1.41 and 48.70 \u00b1 1.99 mm of the zone of inhibition, respectively). This result demon-\nstrated antibacterial activity of the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticle containing clindamycin HCl\nin SCMC film. Thus, it could have potential use for an antibacterial application. In our\nstudy, however, SCMC-CM-nano films exhibit antibacterial activity similar to that of\nclindamycin solution. In contrast, the preparation of dual-cross-linked nanocomposite hy-\ndrogels based on quaternized chitosan and clindamycin-loaded hyperbranched nanopar-\nticles showed that the dual-cross-linked nanocomposite hydrogels loading clindamycin\nexhibited better antibacterial activity than commercial clindamycin gel. This contrasting\nfinding might be contributed to by positively-charged amino and quaternary ammonium\ngroups of quaternized chitosan that target the bacterial cell wall [54].\nMeanwhile, the SCMC-CM-nano film exhibited different patterns of drug release when compared with the SCMC-CM-powder film. The first pattern of clindamycin release from the SCMC-CM-nano film increased from 15.91 \u00b1 2.42% at 1 min to 69.88 \u00b1 2.03% at 60 min. The burst release in this step related to the unencapsulated clindamycin HCl outside the\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1736 16 of 20\nnanoparticles. It is possible that higher nanoparticles containing more clindamycin HCl content might release slightly less drug content in this step. The burst release was also found in the previous study in which CMCS hydrogel containing clindamycin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles showed initial burst release due to unentrapped clindamycin HCl that absorbed at the outer surfaces of particles and dispersed in the hydrogel matrix [49]. The initial drug release pattern of SCMC-CM-nano film was similar to the SCMC-CM-powder film. The second release step from 60 to 1440 min involved a gradual drug release from the nanoparticles in the SCMC-CM-nano film. It exhibited extended release and reached to 94.99 \u00b1 4.70% at 1440 min. Generally, the drug release mechanism of cross-linked network structure is swelling-controlled release. The cross-linked network structure swells when it comes into contact with water, and then releases entrapped molecules inside the structure [50]. In the last release step, the level of clindamycin HCl was constant until 2880 min (48 h). The typical drug release from polymeric nanoparticle is driven by polymer degradation and/or drug diffusion [51]. It is possible that smaller particles, possessing a higher degradation rate, might demonstrate a faster release profile than larger particles. The pH of the media affected the drug release. The previous study stated that chitosan-based hydrogel exhibited higher drug release in an acidic medium than a neutral medium because the swelling of chitosan in an acidic medium is better than a neutral medium [52]. In this study, however, the experiment was performed in physiological pH (7.4), which is a general condition for the drug release profile and our study indicated that the SCMC-CM-nano films exhibited an extended drug release in this condition."
