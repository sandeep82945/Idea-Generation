    "abstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumor that harbors therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Due to the limited effectiveness of conventional chemotherapies and radiation treatments against CSCs, there is a critical need for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Our previous research revealed the significant expression of embryonic stemness genes, NANOG and OCT4, in CSCs, suggesting their role in enhancing cancer-specific stemness and drug resistance. In our current study, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of these genes and observed an increased susceptibility of CSCs to the anticancer drug, temozolomide (TMZ). Suppression of NANOG expression induced cell cycle arrest in CSCs, specifically in the G0 phase, and it concomitantly decreased the expression of PDK1. Since PDK1 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote cell proliferation and survival, our findings suggest that NANOG contributes to chemotherapy resistance in CSCs through PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Therefore, the combination of TMZ treatment with RNAi targeting NANOG holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for GBM.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma (GBM), a grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common and highly malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumor that currently lacks adequate treatment [1]. The cerebral hemispheres, specifically the supratentorial region, are the prevalent location for GBM tumors [2]. For newly diagnosed patients, the standard treatment regimen starts with a maximal surgical resection of the tumor tissue followed by radiation and chemotherapy [3,4]. However, the median life expectancy of GBM is only 12\u201316 months with the currently available therapies [5]. The poor prognosis of GBM can be attributed to the heterogenetic nature of the disease, which means that it exhibits a wide range of genetic and molecular characteristics. A major factor contributing to the treatment resistance of GBM is the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs were first discovered in acute myeloid leukemia [6], and they were later identified in cancer within the brain, heart, breast, colon, and lung [7\u201310]. They possess selfrenewal and high-differentiation capabilities, which are characteristics of stem cells [11,12], and they play a pivotal role in cancer progression, facilitating uncontrolled cell proliferation, metastasis, and the initiation of new tumor formation [13,14]. CSCs can be distinguished from other cells by utilizing cell surface markers commonly found on stem cells, such as CD24, CD29, CD44, and CD133 [15,16]. The drug resistance of CD133-positive cells has been confirmed in various types of cancers, including GBM [17\u201320]. The resistance of CSCs against temozolomide (TMZ), the current standard therapy for GBM, has been reported [21,22]. Temozolomide is a small lipophilic molecule that can effectively cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) [23]. It functions as a DNA-alkylating agent, adding a methyl group to the purine bases of DNA. This methylation process leads\nGenes 2023, 14, 1276. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes14061276 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes\nGenes 2023, 14, 1276 2 of 16\nto the formation of cytotoxic mispairings with pyrimidine bases [24]. By inducing these abnormal DNA structures, TMZ disrupts DNA replication and ultimately triggers cell death [25]. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, the resistance of CSCs to TMZ is attributed to their stemness properties [21,22]. Previous studies have indicated that stemness genes contribute to an increase in the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), an enzyme involved in DNA repair that can counteract the effects of TMZ [26\u201328]. Elevated levels of MGMT are frequently observed in GBM patients, and epigenetic modifications of the MGMT promoter are commonly employed to predict the responsiveness of GBM patients to TMZ treatment [29,30]. MGMT levels are higher in CSCs [18], and there have been reports of a correlation between the presence of CSCs in tumor tissue and the expression of MGMT [31]. We have previously reported that embryonic stemness genes, specifically NANOG and OCT4, which are members of the DNA-binding homeobox transcription factor family, exhibit a higher expression in CSCs compared to normal neural stem cells and other cancer cells in GBM [32]. This finding has been supported by independent researchers [33]. Recently, we found that CSC-secreted exosomes contain the NANOG family retro-oncogene NANOGP8 with a distinct promoter [34]. These exosomes, enriched with stemness genes, possessed the ability to induce a transformation of GBM cancer cells into a cancer-specific stemness phenotype [26]. Considering these discoveries and the well-established association between the expression of stemness genes and drug resistance in various cancers [22,35\u201338], it is plausible that embryonic stemness genes play a critical role in sustaining the cancer-specific stemness of GBM and contribute to the observed drug resistance in CSCs [39\u201341]. Therefore, in our current research, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of stemness genes in CSCs, aiming to investigate whether the downregulation of stemness genes increases the vulnerability to TMZ. Furthermore, in addition to the developmental pathways such as JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Wnt, and NOTCH, which have been reported to be crucial for maintaining the stemness of CSCs [42,43], the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a significant role in regulating proliferation, metabolism, and cell survival following the activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). The dysregulation of this pathway is frequently observed in cancer and may potentially impact the response to therapy [44]. Studies have indicated that elevated PI3K/AKT signaling is associated with the expression of stemness genes in CSCs [45]. In light of these findings, we conducted additional investigations to explore the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the development of drug resistance in CSCs."

            "text": "Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive tumor that accounts for nearly half of all CNS tumor cases. Over the past decade, the number of cases of GBM has been increasing worldwide, and this trend is expected to continue due to the growing population of individuals aged 60 and above [51]. The location of the tumor in the brain poses unique challenges for treatment compared to other types of tumors. Early diagnosis of GBM is challenging because symptoms often manifest when the disease has progressed significantly, which is similar to many other neurological disorders. Currently, there are limited diagnostic tools available to detect GBM at early stages, making early intervention difficult. By the time of diagnosis, the tumor has typically infiltrated deep into the brain, making the complete removal of the tumor tissue without damaging the surrounding healthy brain tissue nearly impossible. Additionally, any drug treatment administered must be able to cross the BBB in order to target the tumor cells within the brain effectively. Temozolomide is the primary drug used for newly diagnosed GBM patients. Its cytotoxic effect is achieved through the methylation of the N7 position of guanine, the O3 position of adenine, and the O6 position of guanine [25]. When combined with radiation therapy, TMZ has been shown to increase patients\u2019 lifespan [21].

However, the efficacy of the current treatments is limited, and most patients only survive for a few years even with\nGenes 2023, 14, 1276 10 of 16\nall available treatment options explored. Patient survival rates are significantly reduced based on the level of care received [52]. The classification of GBM into proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes based on gene expression profiles has provided valuable insights into the molecular heterogeneity of the disease [53]. The proneural subtype is highly proliferative, while the mesenchymal subtype is slow-growing and more invasive [54]. This classification scheme has helped in understanding the diverse characteristics and behaviors of GBM tumors, and it has been associated with differences in patient prognosis and response to treatment. However, it is important to note that classifying GBM subtypes based on gene expression profiles has limitations. The classification is based on specific gene expression patterns and may not fully capture the complexity of the tumor biology or all relevant molecular alterations. Therefore, while the classification into subtypes based on gene expression profiles has provided a useful framework for understanding GBM heterogeneity, further research is needed to refine and expand our understanding of the disease. Incorporating additional molecular and genetic features, such as the expression of embryonic stem cell genes in CSCs, as well as other clinical and pathological factors, may help to improve the classification and provide a more comprehensive understanding of GBM. Cancers that express NANOG demonstrate greater aggressiveness compared to those lacking NANOG expression [40]. NANOG-positive cells also express CD133, a wellestablished CSC marker, and the expression level of CD133 is reported to correlate with the pathological grade of the glioma [55\u201357]. Therefore, the population of CSCs, which is represented by NANOG expression, maybe a good way to classify GBM. Although the population of CSCs is small, they adapt to environmental changes for survival by switching states and having a high plasticity. They are the primary contributor to therapeutic resistance and could be a good target for GBM therapy. To improve the prognosis of cancer patients, it is vital to develop therapies that can effectively eliminate CSCs, thereby preventing cancer recurrence and metastasis. As a result, there has been a growing focus on studying the biology of CSCs in order to identify effective therapeutic targets. Among the various strategies being explored, targeting CSCspecific surface markers is one approach. However, it is important to note that CSCs are known to undergo constant evolution, which can result in variations in the expression of these markers over time. Despite efforts in a clinical trial to target EGFRvIII, which has been identified as a potential marker for CSCs in glioblastoma, no significant beneficial results were observed for the participating patients. The trial did not demonstrate the intended efficacy of the treatment in improving patient outcomes [58]. This outcome highlights the challenges and complexities involved in developing effective therapies for targeting specific molecular markers such as EGFRvIII. Another strategy was to target cell-signaling pathways that are overactive in CSCs. To inhibit notch signaling, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 has been used in several clinical trials. Although it was well tolerated, the clinical effects were minimal [59]. By inhibiting the enzymatic activity of \u03b3-secretase, which is responsible for the cleavage of intracellular notch, researchers aimed to disrupt the signaling cascade that contributes to the maintenance and self-renewal of CSCs. The modest clinical outcomes indicate the complexities of targeting CSCs and disrupting their signaling pathways. A promising strategy may involve targeting specific genes associated with stemness, such as NANOG and OCT4. These genes encode transcription factors that play a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Previous studies have established NANOG and OCT4 as distinguishing factors for CSCs, and the expression of these genes has been found to have detrimental effects on cancer patients [32,60\u201362]. It is well established that the promoter regions of NANOG and OCT4 contain binding sites for each other, thus facilitating their mutual expression. Additionally, these two genes regulate a significant number of overlapping genes as well as independent binding sites [63]. Recently, we found that the secretion of exosomes containing NANOG altered the transcription profile of drug-resistant genes [26]. Hence, building upon this discovery, our study aimed to\nGenes 2023, 14, 1276 11 of 16\nspecifically investigate potential targets that could be influenced by NANOG. While we did observe that the suppression of either NANOG or OCT4 heightened the sensitivity of CSCs to TMZ, our focus in the current investigation was on exploring the specific targets that could be impacted by NANOG. Considering their distinct target genes and roles in cellular processes, conducting a separate investigation into OCT4 in future studies will enable us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its function in controlling specific pathways. By studying them independently, we can unravel their unique functions and shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying their regulatory effects. In lung cancer, CSCs have been shown to express high levels of OCT4, leading to increased invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, compared to other cancer cells [64]. Additionally, the expression of NANOGP8 has been found to promote cell migration and proliferation in gastric cancer cells [39]. A high expression of NANOG and OCT4 in renal cell carcinomas has been associated with poor patient survival, highlighting the importance of targeting these genes to improve patient outcomes [27]. It is worth noting that the expression of NANOG and OCT4 is indeed negligible in adult cells. This characteristic is advantageous when considering the potential modification of these gene expressions, as it is less likely to affect normal cells. By targeting NANOG and OCT4, we can minimize disturbances to the viability and function of normal adult cells, focusing on the therapeutic impact on cancer cells that overexpress these genes. By utilizing RNAi, we can effectively and selectively silence various genes. For instance, hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), an oncogene that has been found to promote stemness in GBM, when silenced with shRNA, inhibited the growth of CSCs [65]. This has also been observed with brain cytoplasmic 200 (BC200), where shRNA led to a retraction of the stemness phenotype along with the sensitization of CSCs to TMZ [66]. In our study, we selectively suppressed genes that were not expressed in normal adult cells to mitigate drug resistance in CSCs. This approach offers a safer alternative and is beneficial for the overall wellbeing of patients, as it specifically targets CSCs while potentially minimizing the impact on normal cells and reducing the side effects associated with anticancer drugs. The findings of our current study provide compelling evidence for the potential therapeutic benefit of targeting NANOG and OCT4 in CSCs. We employed shRNA to suppress the expression of these stem cell genes, and the results were remarkable. We investigated the individual effects of silencing NANOG and OCT4 on the response of CSCs to TMZ, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. By using shRNA to suppress NANOG or OCT4 expression in CSCs, we observed a significant improvement in the efficacy of TMZ treatment. This suggests that the presence of NANOG and OCT4 contributes to the resistance of CSCs to TMZ, and by targeting these genes, we can sensitize CSCs to the effects of chemotherapy. The combined treatment approach resulted in a significantly greater reduction in CSC viability and an enhanced suppression of CSC-related properties compared to either treatment alone. This synergistic effect indicates that the combination of TMZ and stem cell gene silencing acts through complementary mechanisms, leading to a more profound and comprehensive targeting of CSCs. Our recent discoveries have revealed the presence of NANOGP8 in the exosomes released by cancer cells [34]. These exosomes have been found to impact the transcriptional profile of several drug-resistant genes in GBM [26]. Notably, one of the genes that displayed an altered transcriptional activity was MGMT. Consequently, our study aimed to investigate how NANOG influences drug-resistant genes in GSCs. MGMT plays a crucial role in the neutralization of TMZ by removing alkyl groups from guanine residues. Consistent with prior research, our findings corroborated that MGMT gene expression is significantly higher in GBM CSCs compared to non-CSC GBM cells (CD133\u2212). However, intriguingly, when we suppressed NANOG expression, we did not observe any noticeable changes in MGMT expression levels. This suggests that NANOG may regulate drug resistance to TMZ treatment in GSCs through mechanisms other than the direct upregulation of MGMT. The PI3K/AKT pathway significantly regulates the cell cycle by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. The hyperactivation of the pathway has been shown to\nGenes 2023, 14, 1276 12 of 16\ncreate drug resistance in cancer [50], which is particularly prevalent in GBM, and therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway have been explored [67,68]. Our current study demonstrated that when NANOG expression was suppressed in CSCs, there was a notable decrease in PDK1 gene expression. Silencing PDK1 mRNA expression reduces the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and elevated PDK1 mRNA expression drives the PI3K/AKT pathway [69,70]. These observations underscore the critical role of PDK1 as a regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, specifically in modulating the phosphorylation of AKT. The observed reduction in PDK1 expression levels upon suppressing NANOG suggests that NANOG may play a role in modulating AKT phosphorylation and, consequently, regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our study specifically examined the relationship between NANOG and PDK1, shedding light on their interaction within the pathway. By influencing PDK1 expression, NANOG has the potential to exert control over AKT phosphorylation and activation, thereby impacting downstream signaling events in the pathway. However, further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which NANOG regulates PDK1 and understand its downstream effects on the PI3K/AKT pathway. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the PI3K/AKT pathway and its modulation by NANOG, it is crucial to investigate the involvement of other factors, both upstream and downstream, that interact with PDK1. This broader assessment would provide a more complete picture of the molecular interactions within the pathway and the potential influence of NANOG on these interactions. Continued research in this area will contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of NANOG and its associated signaling pathways in CSCs, ultimately guiding the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Upon suppressing NANOG expression, we observed a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in CSCs, indicating that NANOG plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation. It is well known that AKT activation facilitates cell cycle progression, particularly by promoting the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Conversely, inhibiting AKT activity can induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, thus preventing cells from entering the S phase and undergoing DNA replication [71]. Additionally, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway can lead to the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21 and p27, which are known to induce G1 cell cycle arrest [72]. These observations emphasize the significant role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in governing the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G0/G1 phase. Understanding the intricate interplay between NANOG, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and cell cycle regulation provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation in CSCs. Although further investigation on other signaling pathways to increase drug resistance in CSCs may be needed, these insights hold promise for deepening our understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets to eliminate CSC, which can lead to the cure of GBM."

Notably, these factors are not expressed in adult cells, allowing for the selective targeting of CSCs without side effects. The use of shRNA to suppress these embryonic stem cell genes combined with existing treatment strategies holds great potential for clinical applications to improve patient outcomes significantly. Further investigations using multiple primary cell samples are necessary to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms in detail and translate these research findings into practical clinical applications for the benefit of cancer patients. Continued research in this area will contribute to advancing personalized medicine and improving treatment outcomes for individuals affected by GBM and other cancers.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.S.; methodology, K.S., M.F. and J.S.; validation, K.S., M.F. and J.S.; formal analysis, J.S.; investigation, J.S.; resources, K.S. and M.F.; data curation, J.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.S.; visualization, J.S.; supervision, K.S.; project administration, K.S.; funding acquisition, K.S.
