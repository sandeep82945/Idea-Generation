Expansion to Other Biomarkers and Diseases: Following the promising results with aldehydes as biomarkers for respiratory diseases, future research could explore the adaptation of the linker-enhanced peptide-based biosensors for detecting other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with different diseases. This would involve identifying and synthesizing specific peptides with high affinity to biomarkers of conditions such as diabetes, kidney disorders, or neurodegenerative diseases, where VOCs in breath or bodily fluids can serve as indicators.

Development of Multi-Analyte Biosensor Platforms: Building on the success of single-analyte biosensors, a logical next step is the creation of multi-analyte platforms capable of simultaneously detecting multiple biomarkers. This would require the integration of various peptide linkers and receptor layers on a single biosensor chip, optimizing the sensor array for comprehensive disease screening and diagnosis in a single test. Research could focus on the fabrication technologies, signal processing algorithms, and the metrological challenges of such complex biosensor systems.

In Vivo and Clinical Trials: While the current study emphasizes in vitro and gas-phase analysis, future research could aim to validate the biosensors in clinical settings. This would involve conducting in vivo trials and comparing the performance of these biosensors against standard diagnostic methods in real patient samples. Research could explore non-invasive breath analysis for early disease detection, monitoring disease progression, or evaluating treatment efficacy in patients.

Enhancing Sensor Stability and Lifespan: Given the importance of sensor stability and lifespan for practical applications, future studies could focus on improving these aspects through the design of novel linkers and surface modifications. This could involve exploring new materials, linker chemistries, and surface treatments to enhance peptide attachment, sensor robustness, and resistance to environmental factors, thereby extending the operational life of biosensors in field applications.

Integration with Wearable and Portable Devices: With the increasing interest in personal health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics, future research could explore the integration of the developed biosensors into wearable or portable devices. This would require miniaturization of the sensor technology, development of low-power signal processing and wireless communication capabilities, and ensuring device accuracy and reliability in various environmental conditions. Research could also investigate user interfaces and data management systems for real-time health monitoring and alerting users to potential health issues.
