    "abstractText": "A graphene oxide (GO)/poly 3-methyl aniline (P3MA) photodetector has been developed for light detection in a broad optical region: UV, Vis, and IR. The 3-methyl aniline was initially synthesized via radical polymerization using an acid medium, i.e., K2S2O8 oxidant. Consequently, the GO/P3MA composite was obtained through the adsorption of GO into the surface of P3MA. The chemical structure and optical properties of the prepared materials have been illustrated via XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM analysis. The absorbance measurements demonstrate good optical properties in the UV, Vis, and near-IR regions, although a decrease in the bandgap from 2.4 to 1.6 eV after the composite formation was located. The current density (Jph) varies between 0.29 and 0.68 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 (at 2.0 V) under dark and light, respectively. The photodetector has been tested using on/off chopped light at a low potential, in which the produced Jph values decrease from 0.14 to 0.04 \u03bcA\u00b7cm\u22122, respectively. The GO/P3MA photodetector exhibits excellent R (and D) values of 4 and 2.7 mA\u00b7W\u22121 (0.90 \u00d7 109 and 0.60 \u00d7 109 Jones) in the UV (340 nm) and IR (730 nm) regions, respectively. The R and D values obtained here make the prepared photodetector a promising candidate for future light detection instruments.",

            "text": "The last decade has witnessed the rapid progress of optoelectronic devices owing to their crucial impact on several industries, such as light images in cameras, controlling the intensity of street lighting, spaceships, military laser equipment, and highly technology controlled windows, imaging, UV radiation monitoring, and wearable devices [1\u20137]. Among these devices, photodetectors must be suitable for various fields. Indeed, photodetectors display outstanding detection ability covering a broad spectral range. Such a device is highly dependent on the activated photons reaching its surface, which will produce free electrons able to polarize the surface and induce a current density (Jph) [4,5]. For the majority of recent semiconductors, this is directly proportional to light intensity, where the elevation of the photon flux liberates more electrons on the surface. This explains the\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 606. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14030606 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 606 2 of 12\nfree electrons\u2019 dependency on the Jph as well as their capability in imaging the resonance motion. The Jph plays a major role in determining both R and D [8]. Metal compounds have been widely used as photodetector-based materials [1,4,6\u20139]. However, their photodetection ability is highly affected by two main factors. Firstly, the amplification of the active sites in these materials that significantly improve their photoresponse. Additionally, the close control of these materials\u2019 surface area through a change in their geometry, i.e., nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanosheets, ensures a better photoresponse [10\u201312]. In this regard, earlier studies using inorganic oxide as photodetector-based material have been established. Wang et al. [13] studied the dependency of CuO nanowires on the surface area in the IR domain. A small Jph value (20 \u00b5A) at an elevated bias voltage of +5 V has been located. Bai et al. [14] revealed slight enhancement of the Jph values (\u2248107 \u00b5A) at +1 V after adding ZnO into CuO. Some studies analyzed a CdS-ZnO composite; however, a weak Jph was obtained [15]. On the other hand, Hong et al. [16] studied Si heterojunctions, where an increase in the Jph of up to 4.5 \u00b5A has been observed while applying a 0 V bias. In addition, TiO2 material has been considered for light detection. Nevertheless, its efficiency was limited and did not exceed 1% [17]. In this regard, many researchers have been interested in the use of oxides, sulfides, and nitrides with polymer materials [16,17]. Such a mixture of materials reveals better stability, sensitivity, and composite contacts for optoelectronic devices [18,19]. Furthermore, they are cost-effective for mass production, and have a simple synthesis method [20,21]. Several studies have investigated polymers\u2019 efficiency for optoelectronic applications. A promising photo-answer has been revealed, where an electron\u2013hole pair generated by light in polymer originate an electron able to oscillate on the photodetector surface resulting in Jph. For instance, poly-3-hexylthiophene material exhibited an excellent photoresponse while applied inside the retina [22]. Moreover, some composites related to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have the same activity for photodetector applications [14] and polyvinylpyrrolidone/CsPbBr3 composited have been inspected. Nevertheless, the obtained Jph does not exceed 0.01 mA [23]. This behavior appears in benzodithiophene/fluorine, which demonstrates enhanced optical properties [24]. Additionally, Jph was found equal to 0.001 mA at 0 V using triphenylamine [25]. Indeed, the Jph measured using polymers varies between 0.001 to 0.1 mA\u00b7cm\u22122 and exhibits a weak responsivity and no reproducibility. Thus, despite the different results obtained, some hindrances are faced when applying polymers as photodetector-based material, such as having a better Jph and the ability to extend photodetection to more than a single optical domain. In this work, GO/P3MA optoelectronic photodetector (with a high number of active surface sites) is fabricated. Then, to aid in the deposition of GO 2D sheets using the adsorption deposition method, glass/P3MA was utilized. The GO/P3MA composites were analyzed using a variety of analytical techniques to confirm the crystalline and chemical properties, Moreover the optical behavior is tested under optical measurements. Using a CHI608E PowerStation, the electrical measurements were taken. The GO/P3MA composite\u2019s response to light and darkness, light of wavelengths between 340 and 730 nm, and on/off chopped light were all investigated in this work. Based on the findings, we also proposed a tenable mechanism for light sensing. The developed photodetector displayed an exceptional capacity to detect light in a variety of domains, such as UV, Vis, or NIR, with high R and D values. Moreover, in on/off chopped light conditions, the optoelectronic device demonstrated a robust reaction to light, with good reproducibility."

On the other hand, the photodetector demonstrates an important Jph value at 730 nm, revealing its sensitivity through a broad light region from UV to near IR. In addition, such behavior shows the importance of photogenerated electrons in these optical regions [44,45].\nFigure 6.

Indeed, the GO/P3MA photodetector\u2019s external quantum efficiency (EQE) is an important parameter of light-sensing that could be calculated from the Jph values. These parameters are evaluated at light intensity of 100 mW\u00b7cm\u22122 and 1.0 V where the active area of the photodetector is about 1.0 cm2. The photoresponsivity (R) for the GO/P3MA is determined through the Equation (Equation (4)) [46]. This equation depends on the current density in light (Jph) and in dark (Jo), and light power (P) values.
