Aim: To evaluate the most commonly ingested corrosive substances, and the endoscopic findings, complications, and final outcomes of caustic intake. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study included 220 inpatient participants with corrosive poisonings during a 3-year period (2017\u20132019). Data from the national patient electronic system \u201cMy term\u201d and from the \u201cPoisoning information centre\u201d at the University Clinic for Toxicology, Skopje were used. Demographic characteristics, type of corrosive substance, endoscopic findings by Kikendall classification, emerging complications, fatal outcome, and hospitalization were analysed. Data obtained were analysed with the SPSS software package, version 22.0 for Windows. Results: During the period 2017\u20132019, out of 220 hospitalized cases with corrosive substance intake, 132 (60%) were with ingestion of acids, 19 (8.6%) with bases, 32 (14.6%) with bleaches, and 37 (16.8%) with other household products (p = 0.3469). The mean age of patients was 49.89 \u00b119.86 years. The most severe endoscopy findings (high-grade injury) were significantly more often associated with acid and base ingestion (p = 0.00001). Out of all strictures, 25 (64.1%) were on one location (either oesophagus or stomach), and 12 (30.8%) were on 2 locations. Conclusions: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is very important procedure for rapid assessment of severity of caustic injury, early appropriate therapy, as well as the potential development of strictures. The obtained data are very important for the development of a national program for the prevention of corrosive poisoning in our country.",

Upper endoscopy is the cornerstone of the evaluation of the extent of the gastrointestinal injury. Upper endoscopy intervention, including early evaluation, stent insertion, and stricture dilatation, is subject to discussion and debate [1]. The ingestion of caustic substances into the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults is an unusual but potentially life-threatening problem [2, 3]. In contrast to mostly accidental ingestions in children, the ingestion of corrosive solutions in adults is predominantly performed with suicidal intent or due to psychiatric disorders [3, 4]. The severity of tissue lesions caused by corrosive substances depends on the type, quantity, concentration, and contact time. Acids usually cause coagulation necrosis with denaturation of superficial proteins. In contrast, alkaline solutions may lead to liquefactive necrosis and\n184 Natasha Simonovska, Vesna Velikj Stefanovska, Aleksandra Babulovska, Zanina Pereska, Irena Jurukov, Afrodita Berat-Huseini, Kristin Kostadinovski, Kiril Naumovski\nGastroenterology Review 2023; 18 (2)\nsubsequent deep tissue injuries, depending on the exposure time. Prolonged contact with alkaline substances also increases the risk of stricture formation [3, 5].\nEndoscopy plays a\u00a0major role in diagnosing and assessing the severity of caustic injury as well as guiding an appropriate treatment. Recently, computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen has been increasingly used as a\u00a0complementary tool in the evaluation of caustic injury. Despite advances in emerging technologies and treatments, severe morbidities and even death following the ingestion of caustic agents are evident in clinical practices, suggesting the complexity of this condition [6]."

Corrosive poisoning is a\u00a0poisoning with strong acids or alkalis capable of causing rapid tissue destruction and shrinkage. Survivors often suffer severe narrowing (strictures) or obstruction of the gullet. Data from the National patient electronic system \u201cMy term\u201d and from the \u201cPoisoning information centre\u201d at the University Clinic for Toxicology, Skopje, were used. University Clinic for Toxicology is part of the biggest national tertiary care centre, the Clinical Campus \u201cMother Teresa\u201d in Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia. Demographic characteristics, type of corrosive substance, endoscopic findings by Kikendall classification, emerging complications, fatal outcome, and hospitalization were analysed. This study was in accordance the ethical protocol for use of electronic data from the national electronic medical system provided to the University Clinic for Toxicology.\nThe main outcome was based on the endoscopic findings and fatal outcomes. Grading of the gastrointestinal lesions was based on the Kikendall classification: grade I\u00a0(oedema and erythema of the mucosa), grade IIA (haemorrhage, erosions, blisters, superficial ulcers), grade IIB (circumferential lesions), grade III (deep grey or brownish-black ulcers), and grade IV (perforation). Grades 1 and 2a were defined as lowgrade injuries, whereas grades 2b and 3 were defined as high-grade injuries. In all patients, diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was done with previous written consent in the first 24\u201372 h after caustic ingestion, and control oesophagogastroduodenoscopy\n15\u201325 days after ingestion. Patients were divided into 4 groups: 1, acids; 2, alkalis; 3, bleaches; and 4, other household products.\nStatistical analysis The data obtained were analysed with the SPSS software package, version 22.0 for Windows, and are presented in tables and figures. The qualitative series were processed by determining the coefficient of relations, proportions, and rates, and are shown as absolute and relative numbers. Quantitative series were analysed with measures of central tendency as mean, median (Me), interquartile range (IQR), minimum values, and maximum values, as well as by dispersion measures (standard deviation). The Shapiro-Wilk W\u00a0test was used to determine the normality of frequency distribution of investigated variables. The Pearson c2 test and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test were used to determine the association between certain variables in the groups of subjects. T. The Difference test was used to compare the proportions. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between 2 or more groups of independent variables. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of association that existed between 2 variables.\u00a0A\u00a02-sided analysis with a\u00a0significance level of p < 0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance."

            "text": "Caustic ingestion in adults is a\u00a0rare but potentially life-threatening problem. Several diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations have been implicated over the last years [3, 7, 8]. Nevertheless, a\u00a0comparison of acidic and alkaline agent ingestion in adults with regard to clinical management, outcome, and survival has not been performed. Hollenbach et al. retrospectively analysed all adults with caustic ingestion in a\u00a0tertiary medical centre during the period between 2005 and 2016. They consecutively identified 31 patients (10 with acidic agents and 21 with alkaline agents). Ingestion of alkaline agents was more frequent and revealed higher grades of mucosal injury to the oesophagus and stomach along with a\u00a0heightened suicidal intent [3].\n187Ingestion of corrosive substances and the endoscopic role in assessing the severity of caustic injury\nGastroenterology Review 2023; 18 (2)\nOur results showed that the most frequent corrosive poisonings were caused by acids (N = 132), and the most common was ingestion of hydrochloric acid (N = 89, 67.4%) followed by ingestion of concentrated acetic acid (N = 13, 9.8%). The most frequently used alkali (N = 19) was sodium hydroxide (N = 11, 57.9%).\nThe authors of one study found no differences between acid and alkali ingestion in the development of oesophageal strictures. Neither age nor gender could be identified as independent risk factors for oesophageal strictures. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses failed to show an association of gender, type of ingested agent, or the grade of mucosal injury with mortality in this study, as was demonstrated in our cohort [3].\nThe study by Hollenbach et al. discussed the possibility that a\u00a0larger number of patients ingested a\u00a0greater volume in a\u00a0suicidal attempt than patients who accidentally took these liquids. So, it can be speculated that the suicidal intent was the reason for more severe mucosal damage in the alkali group, and not the agent [3].\nUnfortunately, in our study it was not possible to link accurately the amount of ingested corrosive sub-\nstance with the grade of corrosive injury, because in many cases it was impossible to provide accurate data on the consumed amount, and some of the patients did not provide data at all.\nIn a\u00a0study by Quingking et al., oral burn, abdominal pain, haematemesis, and dysphagia were significantly associated with a\u00a0high-grade GI injury [9].\nIn our study almost all patients complained of sore throat and abdominal pain; of the patients with acid and alkali poisoning (N = 151) 87 patients were with haematemesis and 58 patients were with dysphagia. Patients who ingested bleaches and other household products were with less severe clinical symptoms.\nThe primary reason for ingestion of corrosive substances in the patient population examined by Cheng et al. was suicidal intent (71%) [10].\nIn our study, 74.7% of patients had suicidal intent and the others were accidental poisonings. Out of all the patients (N = 220), 11.6% were mixed corrosive poisonings with medicines.\nThe results of one study confirmed Zargar\u2019s endoscopic classification of mucosal injuries post caustic ingestion in relation to clinical outcome. Grade 3b muco-\n188 Natasha Simonovska, Vesna Velikj Stefanovska, Aleksandra Babulovska, Zanina Pereska, Irena Jurukov, Afrodita Berat-Huseini, Kristin Kostadinovski, Kiril Naumovski\nGastroenterology Review 2023; 18 (2)\nsal injury assessed by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was a\u00a0predictor of prolonged duration of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admittance, and gastrointestinal (GI) and systematic complications [10].\nIn our study prolonged duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in patients with base and acid ingestion with endoscopic findings by Kikendall classification grade IIB and III.\nCheng et al. showed that over 80% of patients with grade 3 burns develop stricture formation, while one-third of those with grade 2 develop pyloric stenosis, acid regurgitation, and perforation. This study suggests that patients with mucosal damage exceeding grade 2a are at a\u00a0higher risk of developing serious complications, while patients with mild mucosal damage have a\u00a0significantly reduced mortality and morbidity [10]. In a\u00a0study by Quingking et al., the majority of patients who ingested hydrochloric acid had high-grade injuries [9]. In another study, significantly more high-grade (according to Zargar\u2019s score) lesions in the oesophagus (\u2265 grade III: 56% vs. 24%, p = 0.01) and in the stomach (\u2265 grade III: 43% vs. 13%, p = 0.05) were observed in the alkali group. The severity of the mucosal lesions in the duodenum, however, did not differ significantly between both groups (\u2265 grade III: 6% vs. 0%, p = 0.09). The authors identified only one perforation in index endoscopy in the alkali group. No iatrogenic perforations occurred during endoscopic examinations, although this complication is mentioned in the literature [3, 11, 12]. This finding might be explained by the careful examination with small diameter endoscopes [3].\nOur study showed that the most severe endoscopy findings (high-grade injury) were significantly more often associated with acid and base ingestion in all 3 endoscopy locations (p = 0.00001). Out of all the strictures, 25 (64.1%) were on one location (either oesophagus or stomach) and 12 (30.8%) were on 2 locations. Other complications were acute renal failure in patients with ingestion of concentrated acetic acid (N = 7), stomach perforation (N = 9), mediastinitis (N = 3), and hypovolaemic shock (N = 4).\nHollenbach et al. in their study presented that mortality and gastrointestinal complications were higher after ingestion of alkali, but without statistical significance [3].\nIn this study, of the total of 220 patients, 22 (10%) were with fatal outcome, and most of them (21 (95.45%)) ingested acids; one patient was with alkali poisoning.\nOur study has some limitations. Endoscopy was not performed in all patients, because this procedure was rejected by 10% of patients. We also had no insight into the exact cause of death, and we had limited data\nfrom autopsy reports. The exact amount of corrosive substance could not be related to the grade of caustic injury. This was the result of inaccurate data regarding corrosive substances, and some patients refused to say the exact amount."

Hospitalization was significantly longer in poisonings with bases and acids compared to bleaches and other household products. The most severe endoscopy findings (high-grade injury) were significantly more often associated with acid and base ingestion in all 3 endoscopy locations, and they can lead to fatal outcomes as well. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a\u00a0very important procedure for rapid assessment of the severity of caustic injury, to administer early appropriate therapy, and to identify predictors for overall survival as well as the potential development of strictures. The obtained data are important for the development of a\u00a0national program in the prevention of corrosive poisoning in our country."
