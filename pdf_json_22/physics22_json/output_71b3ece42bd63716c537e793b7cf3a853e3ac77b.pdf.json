    "abstractText": "The \u03ba-Minkoswki space-time provides a quantum noncommutativedeformation of the usual Minkowski space-time. However, a notion of causality is difficult to be defined in such a space with noncommutative time. In this paper, we define a notion of causality on a (1+1)-dimensional \u03ba-Minkoswki space-time using the more general framework of Lorentzian noncommutative geometry. We show that this notion allows specific causal relations, but limited by a general constraint which is a quantum generalization of the traditional speed of light limit.",

            "text": "It is needless to say that causality is an essential property of any physical theory or model. Some approaches to Quantum Gravity, under developments, are mainly based on causality, as building block. These approaches are causal-set [1] which mixes causality and discreteness, or the causal fermion systems [2] which seem to reduce to the Standard Model and/or General Relativity in some suitably chosen limits. Both of these approaches belong to the commutative world and use basically a somehow standard description of causality.\nHowever, it turns out that the notion of causality is not unique whenever a\nnoncommutative geometry framework is assumed. For a review on different approaches to noncommutative (quantum) causality, see for instance [3, 4] and references therein. For a recent phenomenological review on possible tests of physics at the Planck scale including causality aspects, see [5].\nAmong these approaches, Lorentzian noncommutative geometry [6] has been\nintroduced as an attempt to accommodate Lorentzian signature in the by-now standard noncommutative geometry framework usually developed in Euclidean signature [7, 8]. This natural evolution of noncommutative geometry is now arrived at a point where\napplications in fundamental physics are possible. One essential related feature is that Lorentzian noncommutative geometry can be linked to a well defined notion of causality [9], thus opening the possibility to equip a quantum (i.e. noncommutative) space-time with causal structures. This type of noncommutative causality, which exactly reduces to the usual one at the commutative (low energy) limit, is connected to the Dirac operator acting as a metric. Recall that in the usual Euclidean set-up, the Dirac operator is the building block of the Connes spectral distance [7, 8] extending the notion of geodesic distance in a noncommutative world. For explicit constructions on various noncommutative spaces, see [10, 11, 12].\nThis notion of noncommutative causality has already been used to almost non-\ncommutative manifolds [13, 14] for which the inherent causal structures give rise to a Zitterbewegung of a Dirac fermion [15]. A somewhat similar analysis has been carried out for the Moyal plane equipped with a Minkowskian metric, sometimes called the \u201dquantum Minkowski space-time\u201d [16], where it was shown that causal structures can actually exist in this quantum space, a point which has been subject to controversy in the area on (noncommutative) quantum field theories [17, 18], and by the way suggesting that, contrary to the common belief [19, 20], causal structure need not breakdown at the Planck scale. In particular, it was shown that the causal structure occurring within a particular class of pure states is similar to the causal structure on the usual Minkowski space, while the notion of locality is lost.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a first exploration of the above quantum\ncausality on \u03ba-Minkowski space-time [21, 22], which is one of the most studied noncommutative spaces and an interesting candidate in the developpement of some Quantum Gravity. \u03ba-Minkowski space-time can be defined as the dual of a subalgebra of the \u03ba-Poincare\u0301 algebra involving the so-called deformed translation, and may be viewed as the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of coordinates [x0, xi] = i \u03ba xi, [xi, xj] = 0, under a deformation parameter \u03ba > 0. Studying different notions of quantum causality which may be relevant at the Planck scale is far from being of a purely academic interest. For instance, it is worth pointing out that current experiments on in-vacuo dispersion relations of very highly energetic cosmological photons might be definitely unable to detect signals stemming from some \u03ba-deformation if causality at the Planck scale is of the type proposed in [23] whereas observation might eventually remain possible if the usual \u201dclassical\u201d causality at the Planck scale holds true.\nIn this paper, we show that a valid causal structure can be defined on an interesting\nset of pure states on \u03ba-Minkowski space-time, here limited to the (1+1)-dimensional case. While it is difficult to have an explicit characterisation of the entire causal structure, we are able to extract some specific causality constraints. In particular, we show that there exists some specific sufficient conditions of allowed causal relations corresponding to a phase-momentum transport between two quantum states. Then we highlight an interesting necessary constraint, hence a clear limit of causal evolution between quantum states, which can be interpreted as a quantification of the classical speed of light limit.\nThe paper is organized as follows:\n\u2022 The first part (Section 2) describes the necessary basic elements to introduce the\n\u03ba-Minkowski space-time and the construction of a Lorentzian spectral triple on it: in Section 2.1, we present the general definition of a Lorentzian spectral triple; in Section 2.2 the algebra of the spectral triple and the related Hilbert space; and in Section 2.3 the associated Dirac operator.\n\u2022 The second part (Section 3) presents a first exploration of the notion of causality\non \u03ba-Minkowski space-time with particular results: in Section 3.1, we present and apply the notion of causality to \u03ba-Minkowski yielding to a general unsolved condition; in Section 3.2 a particular solution of the general condition is presented as a sufficient causality condition corresponding to a phase-momentum transport; and in Section 3.3 we present another specific solution giving rise to a necessary quantum causality constraint."

            "text": "The main tool used within this paper is the so called Lorentzian spectral triple [6]. Such a spectral triple with Lorentzian signature is not very different from its Riemannian counterpart [7, 8], except that the Dirac operator is naturally self-adjoint in a Krein space [24]. Recall that a Krein space is a space with indefinite inner product, supplemented by additional conditions [25]. This space replaces the Hilbert space which is one of the main data defining a standard spectral triple. However, a Hilbert space can still be used in the definition of a Lorentzian spectral triple thanks to the introduction of a specific operator J , called the fundamental symmetry\u2021 which permits one to trade the Krein space for a Hilbert space (and vice versa). Different definitions of Lorentzian spectral triples appeared in the literature, e.g. [26, 27] which however are compatible. In the sequel, we will use an adapted case of these latter [28] whose advantage is that no signature other than the Lorentzian one is allowed so a notion of causality is always well defined.\nWe will use as general definition for a Lorentzian spectral triple the set of data:\n{ A, A\u0303, \u03c0, H, D, J } , (1)\nwhere A is a non-unital pre-C\u2217 algebra with a preferred unitalization (still a pre-C\u2217 algebra) A\u0303 with A as an ideal, while \u03c0 is a faithful \u2217-representation of A on B(H), the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(H) which also acts as a\n\u2021 In the case of \u201dMinkowskian Moyal plane\u201d mentioned above, J = i\u03b30, the time-like Dirac gamma matrice.\nfaithful \u2217-representation of A\u0303 on B(H). In (1), D is the unbounded Dirac operator with dense domain Dom(D) in H satisfying\n\u2200a \u2208 A\u0303, [D, \u03c0(a)] \u2208 B(H), (2)\n\u2200a \u2208 A, \u03c0(a)(1 + \u3008D\u30092)\u2212 1 2 \u2208 K(H), with \u3008D\u30092 := 1\n2 (D\u2020D +DD\u2020), (3)\nwhere K(H) denotes the algebra of compact operators on H and \u2020 is the involution of A. The operator J \u2208 B(H) related to the fundamental symmetry must satisfy\nJ 2 = 1, J \u2020 = J , [J , \u03c0(a)] = 0, \u2200a \u2208 A\u0303, (4)\ntogether with\nD\u2020J = \u2212JD (5)\nwhich must hold true on Dom(D) = Dom(D\u2020). Finally, the conditions (2)-(5) are supplemented by the additional condition that there exists a densely-defined self-adjoint operator T and a positive element N \u2208 A\u0303 such that Dom(D) \u2229 Dom(T ) is dense in H and\n(1 + T )\u2212 1 2 \u2208 A\u0303, (6)\nJ = \u2212N [D, T ]. (7)\nAt this point, some comments are in order.\ni) As already mentioned above, J corresponds to the fundamental symmetry\nconnecting Hilbert space and Krein space. If \u3008. , .\u3009 denotes the positive definite product equipping a Hilbert space H, then the corresponding indefinite inner product on the corresponding Krein space is given by (. , .)J = \u3008 . ,J .\u3009. ii) According to the above comment, (5) expresses the fact that the operator iD is\nself-adjoint w.r.t the indefinite inner product (. , .)J .\niii) We note that the resolvent condition of the standard (Riemannian) spectral triple\u00a7\ndoes not appear in the definition of a Lorentzian spectral triple, stemming from the fact that D is no longer an elliptic operator in this non-Riemannian context. This explains the appearance of \u3008D\u30092 := 1 2 (D\u2020D+DD\u2020) in (3) leading to an elliptic operator (1 + \u3008D\u30092) 1\n2 , self-adjoint for the Krein product (. , .)J , whose inverse (3)\nmust be compact [24].\n\u2022 T in (6), (7) can be viewed as a global time function for the Lorentzian spectral\ntriple [28].\n\u2022 The unital algebra A\u0303 serves for technical purpose only. It could not support a notion of causality since a unital algebra corresponds to a compact space on which no\ncausality can be defined. Notice that the Riemannian spectral triple for the Moyal plane [29] also uses a preferred unitalization of the non unital algebra modeling the Moyal plane.\n\u00a7 Recall that this latter states that for any a \u2208 A and any \u03bb not in the spectrum of D, one has \u03c0(a)(D \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 \u2208 K(H)."

            "text": "In this paper, we will consider the (1 + 1)-dimensional version of the \u03ba-Minkowski space-time. It can be defined [21] as the dual of a subalgebra of the \u03ba-Poincare\u0301 algebra involving the so-called deformed translations. See Appendix A for useful formulas. Its simplest presentation is provided by the universal enveloping algebra of the following solvable Lie algebra of coordinates\n[x0, x] = i\n\u03ba x, (8)\nwhere \u03ba > 0 is the deformation parameter. The corresponding, hence solvable, Lie group denoted by G is known to be the orientation-preserving affine group of the real line, see e.g. [30], [31], namely\nG = R\u22c9\u03c6 R. (9)\nIt is a simply connected Lie group which is non unimodular, with group product, inverse and unit respectively defined by the following map W : R\u00d7 R \u2192 G\nW (p0, p1)W (q0, q1) = W (p0 + q0, p1 + e \u2212p0/\u03baq1), (10) W\u22121(p0, p1) = W (\u2212p0,\u2212e p0/\u03bap1), (11)\nIG = W (0, 0), (12)\nwhile the automorphism \u03c6 in (9) is defined for any q \u2208 R by\n\u03c6 : R \u2192 Aut(R), \u03c6(p0)q = e \u2212p0/\u03baq. (13)\nA suitable characterization of the associative algebra modeling the quantum (i.e. noncommutative) \u03ba-Minkowski space-time can be obtained [32], [33], [34] by starting from the convolution algebra of G, denoted by (L1(G), d\u03c1), where d\u03c1 is some Haar measure on G to be fixed in a while, which is (isomorphic to) the completion w.r.t. the L1-norm ||F ||1 = \u222b G F (u)d\u03c1(u) of the algebra involving the C-valued continuous functions on G with compact support Cc(G). The resulting algebra (L 1(G), d\u03c1) is a Banach \u2217-algebra with has a natural involution defined by\nF \u2021(u) = F (u\u22121)\u2206(u\u22121), (14)\nfor any F \u2208 (L1(G), d\u03c1), where F denotes the complex conjugate of F and the group homomorphism \u2206 : G \u2192 R+ is the modular function linking together the left-invariant and right-invariant Haar measures of G, respectively denoted by d\u00b5 and d\u03bd, through the well known relation\nd\u03bd(u) = \u2206(u\u22121)d\u00b5(u), (15)\nleading to the useful formulas\nd\u03bd(u\u22121) = \u2206(u)d\u03bd(u), d\u00b5(u\u22121) = \u2206(u\u22121)d\u00b5(u). (16)\nIn the present situation, the modular function is given by\n\u2206(u) = \u2206(p0, p1) = e p0 \u03ba . (17)\nThe convolution product equipping the convolution algebra can be expressed in terms of either the left -invariant Haar measure d\u00b5 or alternatively its right-invariant counterpart d\u03bd as given below\n(F \u25e6G)(s) =\n\u222b\nG\nF (us)G(s\u22121)d\u00b5(s) =\n\u222b\nG\nF (us\u22121)G(s)d\u03bd(s). (18)\nNote that (L1(G), d\u00b5) and (L1(G), d\u03bd) are isometrically isomorphic through the following map \u03c9 : Cc(G) \u2192 Cc(G), (\u03c9(F ))(u) = F (u \u22121). The above properties are standard results form harmonic analysis of locally compact groups.\nIn what follows, we will use the formulation based on the left-invariant Haar\nmeasure. This later is given by\nd\u00b5(u) = d\u00b5(p0, p1) = e p0 \u03ba dp0dp1. (19)\nBy combining (19) with (10) and (11), the convolution product and the involution (14) can then be cast into the form\n(F \u25e6G)(p0, p1) = \u222b dq0dq1e q0 \u03ba F (q0, q1)G(p0 \u2212 q0, e q0 \u03ba (p1 \u2212 q1)), (20)\nF \u2021(p0, p1) = F (\u2212p0,\u2212p1e p0 \u03ba )e\u2212 p0 \u03ba . (21)\nA suitable associative algebra modeling the \u03ba-deformation which can be used to define the Lorentzian spectral triple for \u03ba-Minkowski space-time can be determined from the characterization of the group C*-algebra for G, denoted by C\u2217(G). One first observes that since G is a solvable group, it is amenable, thus one has C\u2217(G) = C\u2217red(G) where C\u2217red(G) is the reduced algebra obtained by completing (L 1(G), d\u00b5) with the left regular representation on (L2(G), d\u00b5). For our purpose, il will be sufficient to restrict ourselves to its generating dense subalgebra of smooth functions on G with compact support, denoted by C\u221ec (G). Now from standard results on C*-algebras of crossed products of groups [31], one infers that C\u2217(G) = C\u2217(R \u22c9 R) \u2243 R \u22c9 C\u2217(R) generated by the dense subalgebra of smooth functions of variables p0 and p1, having compact support for p0 and taking their values in the set of smooth functions of p1 with compact support. We denote this algebra by\nC\u221ec (G) := C \u221e c (R, C \u221e c (R)). (22)\nFrom now on, we choose this algebra, denoted by Ap as the starting algebra for the spectral triple, whenever the functions depend on the variables p0, p1, interpreted from now on as momenta. Namely, one has\nAp := C \u221e c (G). (23)\nIn order to make contact with the physics literature, we further interpret any of the above functions F (p0, p1) as the Fourier transform of some function f(x0, x1) where x0, x1 are\nspace-time variables. Namely, F (p0, p1) = Ff(p0, p1) = \u222b d2x e\u2212i(p0x0+p1x1)f(x0, x1). As a consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem, the algebra Ap is isomorphically mapped by inverse Fourier transform into the algebra Ax of functions which are analytic and of exponential type in the variable x0 with values in the space of analytic functions of exponential type in the variable x1. Namely\nAx := F \u22121Ap = E(R,E(R)), (24)\nwhere E(R) is the set of functions whose analytic continuation f : z \u2208 C \u2192 f(z) is an entire function on C verifying the \u201dexponential\u201d bound |f(z)| \u2264 K1eK2| Im{z}|, with K1 > 0, K2 > 0. The product equipping Ax, of course related to the product (20), is defined by\nF(f \u22c6 g) = Ff \u25e6 Fg. (25)\nA simple calculation yields\n(f \u22c6 g)(x0, x1) =\n\u222b dp0\n2\u03c0 dy0 e\n\u2212iy0p0f(x0 + y0, x1)g(x0, e \u2212p0/\u03bax1). (26)\nIn the same way, the involution (21) translates into\nf \u2020(x0, x1) =\n\u222b dp0\n2\u03c0 dy0 e\n\u2212iy0p0f(x0 + y0, e \u2212p0/\u03bax1). (27)\nThree remarks are in order here:\n\u2022 Notice that (26) and (27) are nothing but the star-product and involution used in\n[32], [33], [34] to describe the \u03ba-deformation of the Minkowski space-time. This latter was obtained from a mere Weyl quantization. Recall that the corresponding quantization map is a morphism of \u2217-algebra defined by Q(f) = \u03c0(Ff) where the non-degenerate unitary \u2217-representation \u03c0 : L1(G, d\u00b5) \u2192 B(H), with H some Hilbert space to be defined in a while, is given by \u03c0(f) = \u222b G d\u00b5(s)f(s)\u03c0U(s), where \u03c0U : G \u2192 B(H) denotes some irreducible unitary representation of G. Simply writing Q(f \u22c6 g) = Q(f)Q(g) = \u03c0(F(f))\u03c0(F(g)) = \u03c0(F(f) \u25e6 F(g)) yields (25) leading to (26). A similar argument yields (27). \u2022 The unitary irreducible representations of G = R \u22c9 R, \u03c0U : G \u2192 H = L2(R, ds), have been classified in [35] (see also [30]). The only non-trivial one are defined by\n(\u03c0U\u00b1(p0, p1)\u03c6)(s) = e \u00b1ip1e\u2212s\u03c6(s+ p0), (28)\nfor any \u03c6 \u2208 H while all the other unitary irreducible one are 1-dimensional. It follows that the non-trivial unitary representations of the corresponding group algebra of G are given by\n(\u03c0\u00b1(f)\u03c6)(s) = \u222b dp0dp1e p0\u2212sFf(p0 \u2212 s, p1)e \u00b1ip1e\u2212s\u03c6(u), (29)\nwhile the trivial 1-dimensional one is\n(\u03c00(f)\u03c6)(s) = \u222b dp0dp1e p0\u2212sFf(p0 \u2212 s, p1)\u03c6(u). (30)\nExpressed in the spatial variables, (29) takes the form\n(\u03c0\u00b1(f)\u03c6)(s) = 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dudv f(v,\u00b1e\u2212s) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) \u03c6(u), (31)\nwhile (30) takes the compatible degenerate form\n(\u03c00(f)\u03c6)(s) = 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dudv f(v, 0) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) \u03c6(u). (32)\nRecall also that\n\u03c0\u0302 = \u03c0+ \u2295 \u03c0\u2212 (33)\nis a faithful representation.\n\u2022 In the course of the analysis, we will need to work with functions depending on\nmixed variables (p0, x1) obtained by partial Fourier transform. The relevant algebra becomes\nApx = C \u221e c (R,E(R)), (34)\nstemming from the Paley-Wiener theorem. It is a straightforward calculation to obtain the product between functions in the above mixed variables, denoted by f\u0303(p0, x1). It is given by\n(f\u0303 \u22c6 g\u0303)(p0, x1) = \u222b dq0 f\u0303(q0, x1) g\u0303(p0 \u2212 q0, e \u2212q0/\u03bax1). (35)\nUnder this mixed formalism, the representations (31)-(32) take the form\n(\u03c0\u03bd(f\u0303)\u03c6)(s) =\n\u222b du f\u0303(u\u2212 s, \u03bde\u2212s)\u03c6(u), (36)\nwhere \u03bd is used to represent elements in {+, 0,\u2212}.\nAt this stage, we have characterized above a suitable algebra for the Lorentzian\nspectral triple, expressed by (23), (24), (34) according to the choice of variables for the functions. Set now\nH+,0,\u2212 := (L 2(R), ds)\u2297 C2. (37)\nSince we will deal with a 2-dimensional Dirac operator, a suitable choice for the Hilbert space involved in the triple is\nH = H+ \u2295H0 \u2295H\u2212. (38)\nBesides, keeping in mind (33), a suitable choice for the faithful representation entering the spectral triple is\n\u03a0 = (\u03c0+ \u2295 \u03c00 \u2295 \u03c0\u2212)\u2297 I2. (39)\nAs recalled in the subsection 2.1, the algebra involved in the spectral triple must\nbe supplemented by an unitized counterpart. We will denote is by A\u0303 with the same subscripts than those used for A according to the used set of variables. We will choose the multiplier algebra of A,M(A) characterized in [32]. Recall thatM(A)x is the algebra of smooth functions with polynomial bounds whose derivatives are also with polynomial bounds. It involves in particular the coordinate functions and the constants. Expressed in the different set of variables, the unit function is expressed as\n1(p0, p1) = (\u03b4(p0), \u03b4(p1)), 1(p0, x1) = \u03b4(p0), 1(x0, x1) = 1, (40)\nrespectively corresponding to the unit of A\u0303p, A\u0303px and A\u0303x. The mixed variable unitalization A\u0303px, which we will use later on, contains functions with compact support on the first variable p0. Note that \u03a0 (39) extends to a faithful representation of A\u0303 on B(H)."

            "text": "In the subsequent analysis, we will consider the Dirac operator obtained from natural one-parameter groups of automorphisms of C\u2217(G), which has already been considered in [36]. It is known [31] that C\u2217(G) has a natural group of automorphisms defined by the modular group of \u2217-automorphisms t \u2208 R 7\u2192 \u03c3t \u2208 Aut(C\u2217(G)),\n\u03c3t(f) = e iP0/\u03ba \u22b2 f = et\u22020/\u03ba \u22b2 f (41)\nfor any f \u2208 Ax, in the notations of [33]. It follows that \u03bad\u03c3tdt |t=0 \u22b2 f for any f \u2208 Ax defines (the action of) a derivation which is simply D0 = \u22020. Another group of automorphisms can be obtained by making use of Fourier transform in C\u2217(G) = R \u22c9 C\u2217(R). Indeed, by Fourier transform, one has C\u2217(R) \u2243 C0(R), the C\u2217-algebra of continuous functions vanishing at infinity. Hence C\u2217(G) = R \u22c9 C0(R), generated by Apx, with action of R on C0(R) given by \u03c9p0(f)(x1) = f(e \u2212p0/\u03bax1) for any f \u2208 C0(R). This therefore corresponds to the group of automorphisms t \u2208 R 7\u2192 \u03c9\u2212t \u2208 Aut(C0(R)), extending to t \u2208 R 7\u2192 \u03c9t \u2208 Aut(C\u2217(G)) with\n\u03c9t(f\u0303)(p0, x1) = f\u0303(p0, e tx1) (42)\nfor any f \u2208 Apx which gives also \u03c9t(f)(x0, x1) = f(x0, etx1) for any f \u2208 Ax. Thus, the second derivative is defined by d\u03c9t(f)\ndt |t=0 which corresponds to the derivation D1 = x1\u22021.\nAt this point, two comments are in order:\n\u2022 It turns out that the derivation D1 is inner. Indeed, a simple computation yields\n(x0 \u22c6 f)(x0, x1) = x0f(x0, x1) + i \u03ba x1\u22021f(x0, x1) and (f \u22c6 x0)(x0, x1) = x0f(x0, x1) where we used (26). Therefore, one obtains\nix1\u22021f = \u03ba[x0, f ] (43)\nfor any f \u2208 Ax. Hence the result. The derivations D0, D1 are obviously real derivations and obeying an untwisted Leibnitz rule. Note however that D1 vanishes\nat the commutative limit \u03ba \u2192 \u221e. These derivations have been used to build the Dirac operator underlying [36] as an attempt to obtain a regular spectral triple for a two-dimensional \u03ba-deformation of (Euclidean version of) the Minkowski space, thus working in the Euclidean set-up of the standard spectral triples. We will consider such a Dirac operator in the following and study causal structures arising in this \u03ba-deformation, thus initiating a first exploration of the causality in \u03ba-deformed Minkowski space.\n\u2022 Notice that other choices for the derivations are possible. In particular, one could\nstart from the twisted derivations used in [37], [38] (see also [34]) to construct a \u03ba-Poincare\u0301 invariant gauge theory on \u03ba-Minkowski space-time which can be viewed as a noncommutative analog of a Yang-Mills theory. These are given by\nX0 = \u03baE \u03b3(1\u2212 E), X = E\u03b3P (44)\nwith [X0, X ] = 0, where \u03b3 \u2208 R. The derivations (44) obviously reduce to the usual derivations at the commutative limit \u03ba\u2192 \u221e. However, they obeys a twisted Leibnitz rule given by\nX\u00b5(f \u22c6 g) = X\u00b5(f) \u22c6 (E \u03b3 \u22b2 g) + (E1+\u03b3 \u22b2 f) \u22c6 X\u00b5(g), (45)\nfor any f, g \u2208 Ax where the action of E and P on the algebra is given by (A.8). Observe that the derivations (44) are not real derivations since the following identity holds true\n(X\u00b5(f)) \u2020 = \u2212E\u22122\u03b3\u22121 \u22b2 (X\u00b5(f \u2020)) 6= X\u00b5(f \u2020), (46)\ncontrary to the above derivations D0, D1. The causal structures stemming from a Dirac operator built from the derivations (44) will be examined in a future publication.\nAs it is now clear that the derivation corresponding to the second spatial variable\nD1 = x1\u22021 vanishes as \u03ba\u2192 \u221e and that the non-trivial unitary representations \u03c0\u00b1 (31) can only be distinguished from the trivial one \u03c00 (32) by this second variable, we have that our spectral triple is inconsistent and collapses as \u03ba \u2192 \u221e. For the simplicity of future expressions, we will work from now with a fixed finite \u03ba = 1 as others finite values are pure rescaling.\nWe set now\n\u2202\u00b1 = \u22020 \u00b1 x1\u22021. (47)\nThe Dirac operator entering the Lorentzian spectral triple is defined as\nD = \u2212\u03b3k\u2202k \u2297 13 = \u2212i ( 0 \u2202\u2212 \u2202+ 0 ) \u2297 13 := D \u2297 13, (48)\nwhere the Dirac gamma matrices are\n\u03b30 =\n( 0 i\ni 0\n) , \u03b31 = ( 0 \u2212i\ni 0\n) . (49)\nThe domain of D is Dom(D) = S(R)\u2297 C2 which is obviously dense in each of the Hilbert spaces defined in (37). Hence Dom(D) = S(R)\u2297 C6. The derivations \u2202\u00b1 (47) act on the algebra. This can be translated as an action of the derivations on the Hilbert space (38) which can be determined from the following action on L2(R, ds) (\u22020\u03c6)(s) = s \u03c6(s), (\u22021\u03c6)(s) = \u2212i(\u2202s\u03c6)(s), (50)\nfor any \u03c6 \u2208 L2(R, ds).\nThe fundamental symmetry J \u2208 B(H) is given by\nJ = i\u03b30 \u2297 13. (51)\nIt is a simple matter of algebra to verify that J 2 = I, J \u2020 = J and [J ,\u03a0(a)] = 0 for any a in the algebra, thus consistent with (5).\nWe set\n\u3008\u03a6,\u03a8\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03bd=+,\u2212,0\n\u3008\u03d5(\u03bd), \u03c8(\u03bd)\u3009H\u03bd , (52)\nfor any \u03a6,\u03a8 \u2208 H with \u03a6 = \u2295\u03bd\u03d5(\u03bd) according to the decomposition of H (38) (and a similar decomposition for \u03a8), where \u3008., .\u3009H\u03bd , \u03bd = +,\u2212, 0 is the Hilbert product on L2(R)\u2297 C2 given by\n\u3008\u03d5(\u03bd), \u03c8(\u03bd)\u3009H\u03bd =\n\u222b ds \u03d5(\u03bd) \u2020 (s)\u03c8(\u03bd)(s). (53)\nThe Krein product related to J is defined by\n(\u03a6,\u03a8)J := \u3008\u03a6,J\u03a8\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03bd=+,\u2212,0\n\u3008\u03d5(\u03bd), i\u03b30\u03c8(\u03bd)\u3009H\u03bd . (54)\nIt can be easily verified that one has\n(\u03a6,D\u03a8)J = (D\u03a6,\u03a8)J (55)\nand thus\nD\u2020J = \u2212JD, (56)\nwhich agrees with (4).\nSet now\nT = \u2212i \u2295\u03bd (\u03c0\u03bd(x0)\u2297 I2) (57)\nwith domain Dom(T ) = Dom(D). The operator T is self-adjoint which simply stems from\n(\u03c0\u03bd(x0)\u03d5)(s) = \u2212i\u2202s\u03d5(s), (58)\nfor any \u03d5 \u2208 L2(R), obtained from (31). From (57), one obtains the following blockwise decomposition\n[D, T ] = \u2212i\u2295\u03bd [D, \u03c0\u03bd(x0)\u2297 I2], (59)\nso that one has to compute [D, \u03c0\u03bd(x0)\u2297 I2]. Indeed, by using (31) and (50), one infers\n(\u22020\u03c0\u03bd(a)\u03d5)(s) =\n\u222b dudv sf(v, e\u2212s\u03bd)e\u2212iv(u\u2212s)\u03d5(u), (60)\n(\u03c0\u03bd(a)\u22020\u03d5)(s) =\n\u222b dudv f(v, e\u2212s\u03bd)e\u2212iv(u\u2212s)u\u03d5(u), (61)\nfor any a \u2208 Ax, \u03d5 \u2208 L2(R) and \u03bd = +,\u2212, 0. From (60) and (61), one easily obtains\n[\u22020, \u03c0\u03bd(a)] = i\u03c0\u03bd(\u22020a) (62)\nfor any a \u2208 Ax and \u03bd = +,\u2212, 0. A similar computation yields\n[\u22021, \u03c0\u03bd(a)] = i\u03c0\u03bd(\u22021a), (63)\nfor any a \u2208 Ax and \u03bd = +,\u2212, 0. (62) and (63) imply\n[\u22020, \u03c0\u03bd(x0)] = i, [\u22021, \u03c0\u03bd(x0)] = 0 (64)\nwhich gives rise to\n[D, T ] = \u2212J , (65)\nwhich fulfills (7) provided N is the identity operator while the self-adjoint operator T (57) verifies the condition (6).\nFurthermore, since \u03c0\u03bd(a) is bounded for any a \u2208 Ax, it follows from (62) and (63) that the operators [\u2202k, \u03c0\u03bd(a)], k = 0, 1, are bounded operators on L\n2(R) for any a \u2208 Ax. Hence\n\u2200a \u2208 Ax, [D,\u03a0(a)] \u2208 B(H), (66)\nwhich extend to any a \u2208 A\u0303x, thus verifying the condition (2).\nLet us consider the compactness condition (3). First, one easily realises that\n\u03a0(a)(1 + D2)\u22121/2 for any a \u2208 A, with \u03a0 and D respectively given by (39) and (48), has a diagonal action on H (38). Hence, it is enough to consider the compactness of \u03c0\u03bd(a)(1 +D 2)\u22121/2 := \u03c0\u03bd(a)T \u22121/2 as an operator on H\u03bd . Now a simple calculation using (50) and (51) yields\n(T\u03d5)(s) = (1\u2212 s2 + \u22022s )\u03d5(s) (67)\nfor any \u03d5 \u2208 H\u03bd where the last two terms in (67) correspond to the operator of a one dimensional harmonic oscillator. It follows that the spectrum of T is discrete with\neigenvalues \u223c n, n \u2208 N, with finite multiplicity so that the eigenvalues for T\u22121 vanishes for n \u2192 \u221e. Notice by the way that T\u22121 alone is therefore compact on H\u03bd and thus T\u22121/2 is also compact. Then, since (67) holds true, the situation is similar to the one covered by [36, Prop. 5.12] which insures that\n\u03c0\u03bd(a)(1 +D 2)\u22121/2 \u2208 L1,\u221e(H\u03bd), (68)\nfor any a \u2208 A where L1,\u221e(H\u03bd) is the 1st weak Schatten class. Hence \u03c0\u03bd(a)(1 +D2)\u22121/2 is compact on H\u03bd , implying that \u03a0(a)(1 + D 2)\u22121/2 is a compact operator on H for any a \u2208 A. Finally, upon using the p, x variables to express the unity (40) together with the representations \u03c0\u03bd defined by (\u03c0\u03bd(a)\u03d5)(s) = \u222b du a(u \u2212 s, \u03bde\u2212s)\u03d5(u), a simple computation yields \u03a0(I)(1 + D2)\u22121/2 = (1 + D2)\u22121/2 which is compact in view of the compactness of T\u22121/2. Therefore, \u03a0(a)(1+D2)\u22121/2 is compact on H for any a \u2208 A\u0303 which satisfies condition (3)."

            "text": "In the usual (commutative) framework, the causality is an essential property of any physically relevant theory/model arising as a basic axiom in quantum field theory. The building ingredients are geometric: points, i.e. events, in a given space-time M\u2016, can eventually be linked together through curves of various types according to the nature of their tangent vectors, e.g. timelike, causal, etc. Then, two points/events are causally related if there exists one causal curve linking them. This geometric description can be translated into an algebraic framework, at least for globally hyperbolic manifolds M , the case of interest here. Indeed, trade points and causal curves respectively for pure states and causal functions. Recall that a state of an algebra, \u03d5 : A \u2192 C, is a positive linear functional with norm 1. Let S(A) denotes the space of states of A = C\u221e0 (M). Causal functions are real-valued functions on M which are non-decreasing along every future-directed causal curve, and it is sufficient to restrict to the set of smooth bounded causal functions belonging to A\u0303 = C\u221eb (M). The set of these functions has the structure of a convex cone C, C \u2282 A\u0303, called the causal cone. The technical role of the unitalization A\u0303 = C\u221eb (M) is clear here, since if we use the algebra A = C\u221e0 (M), the cone of causal functions is restricted to constant functions,\n\u2016 The associated manifold is assumed to be locally compact. Recall that a compact manifold cannot accommodate causality.\nwhich are not sufficient to separate points. For globally hyperbolic manifolds M , this causal cone determines completely [4] the usual causal structure of M given by\np q \u21d0\u21d2 f(p) \u2264 f(q), \u2200f \u2208 C (69)\nfor any p, q \u2208 M . A convenient algebraic characterization of the causal cone using the data involved in the Lorentzian spectral triple coding M , thus corresponding to a commutative algebra A = C\u221e0 (M) in (1), has been achieved in [9]. Indeed, if we define the causal cone C as the convex cone of all real-valued functions f \u2208 A\u0303 verifying\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 H, \u3008\u03c6,J [D, \u03c0(f)]\u03c6\u3009 \u2264 0, (70)\nthen [9, Theorem 7] guaranties that, for globally hyperbolic manifolds, the causal structure defined by\n\u2200\u03c9, \u03b7 \u2208 S(A\u0303), \u03c9 \u03b7 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200f \u2208 C, \u03c9(f) \u2264 \u03b7(f), (71)\nwhen restricted to the pure states in S(A) is exactly the usual causal structure of M .\nThis algebraic framework naturally extends to the noncommutative framework,\ni.e. for noncommutative algebra A in (1) to give rise to the following definition of causality which actually defines a reasonable notion of quantum causality:\n\u2022 The causal cone C of a noncommutative Lorentzian spectral triple {A, A\u0303, \u03c0,HD,J} is the convex cone of all hermitian elements f \u2208 A\u0303 satisfying the condition:\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 H, \u3008\u03c6,J [D, \u03c0(f)]\u03c6\u3009 \u2264 0. (72)\n\u2022 The causal relation between (pure) states is defined by the following relation:\n\u2200\u03c9, \u03b7 \u2208 S(A\u0303), \u03c9 \u03b7 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200f \u2208 C, \u03c9(f) \u2264 \u03b7(f), (73)\nwhich is a well defined partial order relation on all states and if the condition spanC(C) = A\u0303 is respected, ensuring that all states can be separated.\nNote that the causality should be viewed as a partial order relation between all the states of the unitized algebra, which may be eventually restricted to pure states of the algebra. This definition of quantum causality has been used in past works [13, 16, 14, 15] and is the notion of causality which will be examined in the subsequent analysis.\nComing back to the case of \u03ba-Minkowski space-time described above, one easily\ninfers that the relevant causal cone involves the functions f of the group algebra Ax (or Apx according to the chosen pair of variables) such that\n\u2295\n\u03bd=+,0,\u2212\n( \u03c0\u03bd(\u2202+f) 0\n0 \u03c0\u03bd(\u2202\u2212f)\n) \u2265 0, (74)\ni.e. (74) is a positive operator, where (48), (51) and(72) have been used.\nIn order to apply the notion of causality, we need to define the noncommutative\nequivalent of the notion of point, i.e. pure states in S(A). The complete set of pure states of \u03ba-Minkowski space-time is unknown, but an interesting set of pure states can be readily determined by considering the following family of vector states\n\u03d5\u03a6\u00b1 : A \u2192 C, \u03d5 \u03a6 \u00b1(f) = \u3008\u03a6, \u03c0\u00b1(f)\u03a6\u3009 (75)\nfor any \u03a6 \u2208 H\u00b1 with ||\u03a6|| = 1. Any state belonging to the family (75) is a pure state. To see that, one observes that irreducibility of (\u03c0U\u00b1,H\u00b1) (28) is equivalent to the irreducibility of (\u03c0\u00b1,H\u00b1) (29). Then, any non-zero \u03a6 \u2208 H\u00b1 is cyclic for H\u00b1. But any vector state of the form \u3008v, \u03c0(f)v\u3009 where f \u2208 A, A some algebra, and v \u2208 H , H some Hilbert space, is a cyclic vector for an irreducible representation (\u03c0,H) of the algebra is a pure state of A. The statement follows.\nUsing (31) and (75), one easily obtains the following explicit formulation of pure\nstates applied on Ax\n\u03d5\u03a6\u00b1(f) = 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dsdudv f(v,\u00b1e\u2212s) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s)\u03a6(s)\u03a6(u), (76)\nor alternatively on Apx\n\u03d5\u03a6\u00b1(f\u0303) =\n\u222b \u222b duds f\u0303(u\u2212 s,\u00b1e\u2212s)\u03a6(s)\u03a6(u), (77)\nfor any \u03a6 \u2208 H\u00b1.\nAt this stage, two comments are in order.\n\u2022 We only have here a subset of the total set of pure states, however since those states\ncorrespond to irreducible unitary representations, the specific interest of this subset is given by Gel\u2019fand\u2013Raikov theorem.\n\u2022 The above states (76), (77) must be extended so as to be well defined on A\u0303. This can be consistently achieved by further restricting the vectors \u03a6 \u2208 H\u00b1 to smooth\ncompactly supported functions in H\u00b1. This restriction will be assumed in the rest of the discussion.\n\u2022 We can see that the considered pure states are divided into two separated subsets\ndefined by + and \u2212 and the only difference separating those subsets is the sign of the second variable of function to which the state applies. Hence the causal structure is completely symmetric, and results concerning the minus representation \u03c0\u2212 can be easily recovered from the results concerning the plus representation \u03c0+ from a simple substitution e\u2212s \u2192 \u2212e\u2212s. Hence from now we will restrict most of the time our analyse to the \u03c0+ side only when the \u03c0\u2212 side can be trivially recovered.\nNow from the condition (73), one realizes that the causality relation between two states is\n\u03d5\u03a61\u00b1 \u03d5 \u03a62 \u00b1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200f \u2208 Cx, \u03d5 \u03a61 \u00b1 (f) \u2264 \u03d5 \u03a62 \u00b1 (f), (78)\nwhere in obvious notations Cx is the causal cone defined by (74) expressed in the x\u2019s variables. These conditions for the existence of a causal evolution from the state \u03a61 to the state \u03a62 can be easily rewritten as\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dsdudv f(v,\u00b1e\u2212s) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) [ \u03a62(s)\u03a62(u)\u2212 \u03a61(s)\u03a61(u) ] \u2265 0, \u2200f \u2208 Cx (79)\nor alternatively in the mixed variable formalism\n\u222b\u222b dsduf\u0303(u\u2212 s,\u00b1e\u2212s) [ \u03a62(s)\u03a62(u)\u2212 \u03a61(s)\u03a61(u) ] \u2265 0, \u2200f\u0303 \u2208 Cpx.

            "text": "In the previous section, we have shown that the causal constraint (79)-(80) can be turned into a sufficient condition which accepts some specific solutions, hence causal evolution is allowed inside the \u03ba-Minkowski space-time. In this section, we will take the opposite path, showing that there exists a necessary condition and that such a condition prevents some causal relations inside the \u03ba-Minkowski space-time. Thereby, while having a complete characterisation of allowed and forbidden causal relations on this quantum space-time is for the moment out of scope, we prove that the causal constraint implies at the same time valid possibilities and restrictions concerning causality.\nThe formalism in space-time variables (x0, x1) is easier to handle concerning the\nstudy of the necessary condition. In order to extract a counterexample \u03d5\u03a61+ \u03d5 \u03a62 + from the causal constraint (79), it is sufficient to find a specific causal function f \u2208 Cx not respecting the inequality \u222b\u222b\u222b\ndsdudv f(v, e\u2212s) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) [ \u03a62(s)\u03a62(u)\u2212 \u03a61(s)\u03a61(u) ] \u2265 0. (101)\nAn easy way to construct some causal functions is the use of a \u201dsplit\u201d formalism\nf(x0, x1) = h(x0) + g(x1). Indeed, the application of a state on such a split function gives\n\u03d5\u03a6\u00b1(h+ g) = 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dsdudv [h(v) + g(\u00b1e\u2212s)] e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) \u03a6(s)\u03a6(u) (102)\n= 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dsdudv h(v) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s) \u03a6(s)\u03a6(u) (103)\n+ 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dsdudv g(\u00b1e\u2212s) e\u2212iv(u\u2212s)\u03a6(s)\u03a6(u) (104)\n= 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h(v) \u222b ds e\u2212ivs\u03a6(s) \u222b du e\u2212ivu\u03a6(u) (105)\n+ \u222b ds g(\u00b1e\u2212s)\u03a6(s) [ 1 2\u03c0 \u222b dv eivs (\u222b du e\u2212ivu\u03a6(u) )] (106)\n= 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h(v)|F\u03a6(v)|2 + \u222b ds g(\u00b1e\u2212s)|\u03a6(s)|2. (107)\nUsing the same splitting process, the condition (74) becomes f(x0, x1) = h(x0)+g(x1) \u2208 Cx if and only if :\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h\u2032(v)|F\u03c8(v)|2 \u00b1 \u222b ds \u03bde\u2212sg\u2032(\u03bde\u2212s)|\u03c8(s)|2 \u2265 0, \u2200\u03c8 \u2208 L2(R) (108)\nwhere \u03bd = +1, 0,\u22121.\nDue to Plancherel\u2019s theorem, the inequality (108) is automatically satisfied by\nfunctions f(x0, x1) = h(x0) + g(x1) respecting h \u2032(v) = 1 and |e\u2212sg\u2032(\u03bde\u2212s)| \u2264 1, hence with h(x0) = x0 and g(x1) at most logarithmically increasing. In particular, the first coordinate function f(x0, x1) = x0 with g(x1) = 0, corresponding to a global time as in (57), is a causal function.\nIn order to reach an interesting necessary condition, we need to construct causal\nfunctions leading to the equality case of (108) either for the plus or the minus sign. Once more we will focus on the \u03c0+ side (the \u03c0\u2212 side is similar) and we will only be interested by the behaviour of the causal functions for the positive side of the second variable x0 \u2208 R+, hence with \u03bd = +1, with an implicit smooth extension on R. An easy way would be to take a function f(x0, x1) = h(x0) + g(x1) constructed such that h(x0) = x0 and e \u2212sg\u2032(e\u2212s) = \u22131, which is the case for g(x1) = \u00b1 ln(x1). However, such a function cannot be smoothly extended to R. Therefore we must consider two sequences of functions g\u00b1\u01eb (x1) = \u00b1 ln(x1 + \u01eb) defined on R\n+ and easily extendable on R such that the inequality (108) is still respected (the exact behaviour of this extension has no implication on (101)). Since we have \u2223\u2223e\u2212sg\u00b1\u01eb \u2032 (e\u2212s) \u2223\u2223 = e\u2212s e\u2212s+\u01eb \u2264 1, the functions f\u00b1\u01eb = h+ g \u00b1 \u01eb are causal, which means in the meantime that the set Cx is non-empty and contains non-trivial functions.\nWe can now check those specific causal functions on the phase-momentum transport\nspecific solution (100) but with an arbitrary \u03b1 \u2208 R\n\u03a6t(u) = \u03a60(u+ \u03b1t)e itu. (109)\nUsing the split functions formalism and similar Fourier transforms on (79), we get that, in order to have a valid causal evolution \u03d5\u03a60+ \u03d5 \u03a6t + , the following inequality should necessarily be respected for every causal function f = h+ g \u2208 Cx\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h(v) ( |F\u03a6t(v)| 2 \u2212 |F\u03a60(v)| 2)+ \u222b ds g(e\u2212s) ( |\u03a6t(s)| 2 \u2212 |\u03a60(s)| 2) \u2265 0. (110)\nWe can note that\nF\u03a6t(u) = \u03a60(u\u2212 t), |\u03a6t(u)| = |\u03a60(u+ \u03b1t)| (111)\nwhich leads to\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h(v) ( |F\u03a60(v \u2212 t)| 2 \u2212 |F\u03a60(v)| 2)+ \u222b ds g(e\u2212s) ( |\u03a60(s+ \u03b1t)|\n2 \u2212 |\u03a60(s)| 2) \u2265 0 (112)\nand using standard substitutions\n1 2\u03c0 \u222b dv (h(v + t)\u2212 h(v)) |F\u03a60(v)| 2 + \u222b ds ( g(e\u2212s+\u03b1t)\u2212 g(e\u2212s) ) |\u03a60(s)| 2 \u2265 0. (113)\nNow using the specific causal functions f\u00b1\u01eb (x0, x1) = h(x0) + g \u00b1 \u01eb (x1) = x0 \u00b1 ln(x1 + \u01eb), we obtain the necessary condition\n1 2\u03c0 \u222b dv t |F\u03a60(v)| 2 \u00b1 \u222b ds ( ln ( e\u2212s+\u03b1t + \u01eb ) \u2212 ln ( e\u2212s + \u01eb )) |\u03a60(s)| 2 \u2265 0 (114)\nwhich provides when \u01eb\u2192 0\n1 2\u03c0 \u222b dv t |F\u03a60(v)| 2 \u00b1 \u222b ds \u03b1t |\u03a60(s)| 2 \u2265 0 (115)\nleading to\nt\u00b1 \u03b1t \u2265 0 (116)\nusing Plancherel\u2019s theorem. Hence the causal evolution of the phase-momentum transport specific solution is clearly forbidden for |\u03b1| > 1.\nIf we apply the same process on two generic states \u03d5\u03a6+ \u03d5 \u03be + with a causal relation,\nwe have for every causal function in the split form f = h+ g \u2208 Cx\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv h(v) ( |F\u03be(v)|2 \u2212 |F\u03a6(v)|2 ) + \u222b ds g(e\u2212s) ( |\u03be(s)|2 \u2212 |\u03a6(s)|2 ) \u2265 0 (117)\nand if we consider the same specific sequences of functions f\u00b1\u01eb (x0, x1) = h(x0)+g \u00b1 \u01eb (x1) = x0 \u00b1 ln(x1 + \u01eb) and the induced limit \u01eb \u2192 0 on the inequality, we obtain the following general necessary condition\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv v|F\u03be(v)|2 \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b dv v|F\u03a6(v)|2 \u2265 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b ds s|\u03be(s)|2 \u2212 \u222b ds s|\u03a6(s)|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (118)\nWe can show that (118) possesses an interpretation in term of quantum operators\non the space L2(R). Indeed, if X represent the position operator, then \u222b\nds s|\u03be(s)|2 = \u3008\u03be|X|\u03be\u3009 . (119)\nUsing Fourier transform on derivative and Parseval\u2019s theorem, we also get\n1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv v|F\u03be(v)|2 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b dv F\u03be(v)vF\u03be(v) (120)\n= 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b dv F\u03be(v)F ( \u2212i d\nds \u03be\n) (v) (121)\n= \u222b ds \u03be(s) ( \u2212i d\nds\n) \u03be (122)\n= \u3008\u03be|P |\u03be\u3009 (123)\nwhere P is the momentum operator. Therefore, the necessary condition (118) can be interpreted as\n\u3008\u03be|P |\u03be\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a6|P |\u03a6\u3009 \u2265 | \u3008\u03be|X|\u03be\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a6|X|\u03a6\u3009| (124)\n\u21d0\u21d2 \u03b4 \u3008P \u3009 \u2265 |\u03b4 \u3008X\u3009| (125)\nwhere \u03b4 \u3008X\u3009 represent the variation of the expectation value.\nThis necessary condition is clearly a quantum analogous to the classical speed of\nlight limit. Indeed, on a two dimensional Minkowski spacetime, two events are causally related if and only if variations of the spatial coordinate \u03b4x and time coordinate \u03b4t respect the inequality \u03b4t \u2265 |\u03b4x|. A similar restriction occurs within the \u03ba-Minkowski space-time, with the correspondence X \u223c x, P \u223c t."
