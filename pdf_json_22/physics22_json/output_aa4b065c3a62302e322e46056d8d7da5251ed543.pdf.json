    "abstractText": "We explore the effective theory of an axion in a gauged baryon number symmetry extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the axion is realized from a Dine-FischlerSrednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model construction. Integrating out the anomalons realizes a pattern of effective Wilson coefficients reflecting the factorization between the anomalous Peccei-Quinn and gauged baryon number symmetries. We construct and analyze the chiral transformation invariance of the axion effective theory, accounting for possible flavorviolating axion couplings. We calculate and study the unique phenomenology of the axion and Z \u2032 boson, and we present the current collider limits on these particles in the {mZ\u2032 , gB}, {ma, Ga\u03b3\u03b3}, and {ma, f\u22121 a } planes.",

            "text": "The study of fundamental symmetries of Nature is central to the development of the Standard Model as well as its possible extensions. In particular, the basic structure of the Standard Model (SM) is built from the gauge symmetry groups SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y , while the three generations of SM fermions admit a residual U(1)B\u00d7U(1)L global symmetry after accounting for arbitrary Yukawa interactions and massive neutrinos. While the role of the SM gauge symmetries is well-understood as conserved current interactions among SM matter fields (albeit spontaneously broken in the case of the electroweak symmetry), the global symmetries have no corresponding low-energy mediators and are in fact expected to be violated individually because of their anomalous nature. In contrast, the Peccei-Quinn symmetry [1, 2] is also an anomalous global symmetry that is spontaneously broken at a high scale fa, leading to a very light axion degree of freedom [3\u20138] that is responsible for the resolution of the strong CP problem. Given that the non-observation of the electric dipole moment of the neutron strongly constrains the anomalous theta term \u03b8\u0304GG\u0303 of the\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nSM, with \u03b8\u0304 \u2261 \u03b8 + arg detMq, to be \u03b8\u0304 . 10\u221210 [9\u201311], experimental searches for axions are highly motivated. From this viewpoint, we want to consider the interplay between gauged anomalous global symmetries of the SM and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, with a particular focus on the distinction between the corresponding Z \u2032 and axion degrees of freedom of the two symmetries, respectively. For concreteness, we will gauge SM baryon number, which necessarily requires the addition of new electroweak-charged fermions called anomalons to cancel the SU(2)2L \u00d7 U(1)B and U(1)2Y \u00d7 U(1)B anomalies [12\u201320]. To connect to axion physics, we will also add two SU(2)L Higgs doublets and two U(1)B Higgs fields with Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model-like couplings [7, 8]. In this way, the usual SM gauge singlet in DFSZ axion models is now the remnant pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson from U(1)B symmetry breaking and is orthogonal to the Goldstone eaten by the Z \u2032 vector boson, enabling us to explore the nontrivial dynamics of these Goldstone fields. One key motivation for studying the gauged baryon number extension of the Standard Model is to divorce the global baryon number anomaly of the SM quarks from the WW\u0303 and BB\u0303 couplings of the axion in DFSZ constructions. A second key motivation is studying the interplay of axion and Z \u2032 interactions arising from the orthogonality of the PQ and U(1)B symmetries. Recent work has also emphasized how chiral U(1) extensions of the Standard Model can alleviate the axion quality problem [21], but implementing this in the U(1)B symmetry context will be addressed in future work. Furthermore, we are focused on the effective description of axions and axion-like particles in the presence of new U(1) gauge symmetries. While the SM effective field theory (EFT) of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) has been extensively discussed recently [22\u201337], the study of anomalous PQ breaking and the corresponding assumptions on the effective field theory are crucially important. As an example, models featuring nontrivial completions of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) gauge symmetry can shift the viable axion mass range into the electroweak scale and heavier [38\u201341], marking a new regime for axion effective field theory. Our top-down approach to axion+Z \u2032 effective field theory from a gauged baryon number and DFSZ axion model predicts specific patterns of couplings of the axion and Z \u2032 degrees of freedom to the SM fermions and gauge bosons. We will show that these patterns are a direct result of the ultraviolet (UV) requirement of anomaly cancellation, the one-loop trace condition to eliminate cut-off scale dependent kinetic mixing [20], and the requirement for the charges of the new matter fields to allow decays into SM fields in the early universe, avoiding new color- or EM-charged stable relics. We will also emphasize the new collider observables that result from our work, which include decays such as a\u2192 hZ and Z \u2032 \u2192 ah signatures. The outline of our paper is as follows. In section 2, we present the gauged baryon model augmented by the DFSZ-like axion scalar sector. We will emphasize the role of the anomalon sector in determining the absence of chiral anomalies and log-divergent kinetic mixing, as well as the origin of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry from the scalar potential. In section 3 we present a general calculation of EFT operators in an axion interaction basis focusing on the operators mediating axion-vector-vector couplings and axion-vector-Higgs\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\ncouplings. Our calculations are presented in section 4 as generic loop functions that allow for flavor-changing vertices of the intermediate fermions. We discuss the phenomenological aspects of our model in section 5 and highlight the new discovery and search channels involving the Z \u2032 and axion particles at colliders. We conclude in section 6."

            "text": "To analyze the structure of the anomalous Peccei-Quinn symmetry in U(1)\u2032-gauge symmetry extensions of the Standard Model, we study a DFSZ-scalar extension to a gauged baryon number model. Our gauged baryon number model is adapted from refs. [18, 20], where the new fermion content is chosen to cancel the SU(2)2 \u00d7 U(1)B and U(1)2Y \u00d7 U(1)B chiral anomalies arising from the SM quarks. Furthermore, the U(1)B charges of these anomalons also satisfy the trace condition that naturally suppresses kinetic mixing between the Z \u2032 and the SM Z and photon [20]. The field content is shown in table 1, where the anomalon fields are L\u2032L, L\u2032R, E\u2032L, E\u2032R, N \u2032L, and N \u2032R, which have the indicated SM and U(1)B gauge charges designed to cancel the U(1)B gauge anomalies and satisfy the trace orthogonality condition for kinetic mixing [20]. The Hu and Hd SU(2) Higgs doublets are adopted to implement the DFSZ model given their couplings to the SM quarks, but instead of one SM gauge singlet scalar to define the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the scalar potential, we include two SM gauge singlet scalar fields since one Goldstone mode is eaten by the Z \u2032 gauge boson. Hence, the \u03a6A and \u03a6B baryonic Higgs fields provide both the axion degree of freedom in a DFSZ-like manner as well as the longitudinal mode of the Z \u2032 boson, in addition to breaking the chiral symmetry of the U(1)B gauge symmetry and giving the primary source of mass to the anomalon fields. After assigning the Z4 discrete charges to the fields and writing down the complete set of allowed Yukawa terms, we enjoy the accidental PQ symmetry displayed in table 1.\nOur scalar Lagrangian is given by\nLscalar \u2283 |D\u00b5Hu|2 + |D\u00b5Hd|2 + |D\u00b5\u03a6A|2 + |D\u00b5\u03a6B|2 \u2212 V ( |Hu|2, |Hd|2, |\u03a6A|2, |\u03a6B|2 ) \u2212 \u03bbAB ( HaTu abHbd\u03a6A\u03a6B + h.c. ) , (2.1)\nwhere \u03bbAB uniquely determines the accidental PQ symmetry. We remark that other choices of the discrete symmetry can permit more terms in the scalar potential that explicitly break this prescribed PQ symmetry, but this will be discussed in a separate publication [42]. The accidental PQ charges from table 1 are also realized in the corresponding Yukawa Lagrangian, which has the form\nLYukawa \u2283\u2212 yiju Q\u0304iLHuu j R \u2212 y ij d Q\u0304 i LHdd j R \u2212 y ij e L\u0304 i LHde j R\n\u2212 yLL\u0304\u2032R\u03a6BL\u2032L \u2212 yEE\u0304\u2032L\u03a6BE\u2032R \u2212 yN N\u0304 \u2032L\u03a6BN \u2032R \u2212 y1L\u0304\u2032LHdE\u2032R \u2212 y2L\u0304\u2032RHdE\u2032L \u2212 y3L\u0304\u2032LHuN \u2032R \u2212 y4L\u0304\u2032RHuN \u2032L + h.c. .

Field content for a DFSZ-like model with gauged baryon number. In addition to the SM fermions we have two Higgs doublets Hu and Hd for EWSB, two Higgs fields \u03a6A and \u03a6B for breaking baryon number and heavy anomalon fields which cancel gauge anomalies. Besides the SM charges, we assign baryon number and a Z4 charge. The PQ charge results as global symmetry of the Lagrangian.\nHere, the first line reflects the type-II two Higgs doublet Yukawa interactions of the DFSZ model, while the remaining terms are the standard anomalon Yukawa terms arising in gauged baryon number models [17\u201320]. We assume all of the scalar fields will acquire vacuum expectation values (vevs) from the V (|Hu|2, |Hd|2, |\u03a6A|2, |\u03a6B|2) scalar potential, and we will focus on the Goldstone bosons from the corresponding complex scalar fields.\nIn order to analyze the axion and Z \u2032 phenomenology, we now make use of the scalar Lagrangian in eq. (2.1) to define the Goldstone basis of the angular fields and their interactions to the radial fields. The Yukawa Lagrangian in eq. (2.2) gives us the mass basis of the anomalons and their couplings to scalars. We will also present the scalar and fermion couplings to gauge bosons, where we include an effective one-loop induced kinetic mixing of the form\nLkin-mix \u2283 eff 2 B\u00b5\u03bdK \u00b5\u03bd , (2.3)\nleading to a shift in the neutral current gauge fields, and K\u00b5 denotes the additional gauge boson before diagonalization and canonical normalization.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8"

(2.4)\nHere, vi denote the vevs of the scalar fields, hi are the radial modes, and ai and \u03c0i are angular modes, while \u03c3i denote the Pauli matrices as generators of SU(2)L. We define au \u2261 \u03c03u, ad \u2261 \u2212\u03c03d as neutral angular modes of Hu and Hd. The vevs which spontaneously break SU(2)L \u00d7U(1)Y and U(1)B are v \u2261 \u221a v2u + v2d and v\u2032 \u2261 \u221a v2A + v2B , respectively, with tan \u03b2 \u2261 vu/vd and tan \u03b2\u2032 \u2261 vA/vB. Since the PQ symmetry is orthogonal to the gauge U(1) symmetries, we have the relations 0 =\n\u2211 {Hi} YiXiv 2 i , 0 = \u2211 {\u03a6i} BiXiv 2 i , X 2v2a = \u2211 {Hi,\u03a6i} X2i v 2 i . (2.5)\nTogether with the requirement of X \u2261 Xu + Xd = XA + XB to keep the \u03bbAB term PQ invariant, the PQ charges of the scalar fields evaluate to\nXu = X cos2 \u03b2 , Xd = X sin2 \u03b2 , XA = X cos2 \u03b2\u2032 , XB = X sin2 \u03b2\u2032 . (2.6)\nConsequently, the PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken by the effective scale va, where va \u2261 \u221a v2 sin2 \u03b2 cos2 \u03b2 + v\u20322 sin2 \u03b2\u2032 cos2 \u03b2\u2032, with tan \u03b3 \u2261 v sin \u03b2 cos\u03b2/(v\u2032 sin \u03b2\u2032 cos\u03b2\u2032). The PQ charge normalization X is then fixed by the axion decay constant fa \u2261 Xva. To identify the axion a, the heavy SU(2) pseudoscalar A0, and the two Goldstones G0, GB for the longitudinal Z and Z \u2032 bosons, we perform the following orthogonal transformation,  a\nA0 G0 GB\n =  c\u03b2s\u03b3 s\u03b2s\u03b3 \u2212c\u03b2\u2032c\u03b3 \u2212s\u03b2\u2032c\u03b3 c\u03b2c\u03b3 s\u03b2c\u03b3 c\u03b2\u2032s\u03b3 s\u03b2\u2032s\u03b3 \u2212s\u03b2 c\u03b2 0 0\n0 0 \u2212s\u03b2\u2032 c\u03b2\u2032   au ad aA aB  , (2.7) where the G0 and GB Goldstones are easily identified as aligning with the Higgs basis of each sector. We remark that for v v\u2032, \u03b3 \u2248 0, we reproduce the invisible axion of the DFSZ model which is dominantly composed of aA and aB SM gauge singlets. We can also reproduce the Weinberg-Wilczek model [3, 4] by considering the other limit, v v\u2032, \u03b3 \u2248 \u03c0/2.\nThe heavy pseudoscalar A0 gets a mass from the \u03bbAB term given by\nm2A0 = \u03bbAB 2 v2a s\u03b2c\u03b2s\u03b2\u2032c\u03b2\u2032 . (2.8)\nA mass for the axion is only induced by instanton effects, which are quantified by the topological susceptibility \u03c7 [43],\n\u03c7 = m2af2a , \u03c7QCD = mumd (mu +md)2 m2\u03c0f 2 \u03c0 . (2.9)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nFor an ALP, \u03c7 remains a free parameter, while a vanilla QCD axion has \u03c7 = \u03c7QCD, although recent studies have demonstrated that \u03c7 can be enhanced by non-QCD sources and still preserve the axion solution to the strong CP problem [38\u201341]. As long as \u03bbAB is sufficiently large, the basis rotation in eq. (2.7) coincides with the mass basis of a and A0. For the CP even Higgs bosons, we perform the orthogonal transformation to the Higgs basis in the alignment limit, giving h H0 h\u2032\nH \u20320  \u2261  s\u03b2 c\u03b2 0 0 c\u03b2 \u2212s\u03b2 0 0 0 0 s\u03b2\u2032 c\u03b2\u2032 0 0 c\u03b2\u2032 \u2212s\u03b2\u2032   hu hd hA hB  . (2.10) We will assume that the Higgs basis is aligned with the mass basis and neglect further scalar mixing, since our focus is the phenomenology of the light axion and Z \u2032 boson. Large deviations from the alignment limit are also strongly constrained by Higgs observables [44, 45]."

The \u220612 and \u220634 terms are also suppressed by the difference in the Yukawa couplings, which is generally negligible unless the couplings are hierarchical, and so we will assume \u220612 = \u220634 = 0 for the remainder of this work. The CP violation is encoded via the tangent of the CP violating phases and will cause mixing between the axion a with the SM Higgs h. Since we are aligned in the Higgs basis, we will set t12 = t34 = 0 and leave a study of small deviations inducing mixing between a and h to future work. After these simplifying assumptions, we can now rotate the symmetric mass matrices of the anomalons in eq. (2.15) using \u03b1E and \u03b1N mixing angles defined via(\nE1 E2\n) = (\ncos\u03b1E sin\u03b1E \u2212 sin\u03b1E cos\u03b1E\n)( e\u2032\nE\u2032\n) , ( N1 N2 ) = ( cos\u03b1N sin\u03b1N \u2212 sin\u03b1N cos\u03b1N )( \u03bd \u2032 N \u2032 ) .

(2.20)\nIn the case with CP violation, the linear Higgs interactions would mix with the linear axion interactions proportional to Xu and Xd. The last two terms are due to the fact that the interactions of the axion proportional to Xu and Xd are induced by the Higgs doublets and are needed for a complete set of operators at order 1/fa."

In the following we will see that we get new interactions proportional to eff. We recall from ref.

We are particularly interested in the general structure of flavor-conserving and flavor-violating axion interactions and how they manifest when the mediator fermions are integrated out. For this purpose, we consider a chiral transformation of the fermion fields which accounts for possible flavor-violating effects. The chiral transformation is also relevant for understanding the basis invariance of flavor-conserving and flavor-violating axion interactions. We represent the general axion interaction basis in a form where the axion appears in the Yukawa and gauge interactions of the fermions. We include a dimension 5 commutator interaction for the axion coupling to fermions and a gauge boson, which only appears when the PQ and the gauge currents are flavor-violating. This commutator plays a crucial role in maintaining the basis invariance of the effective coupling between the axion, Higgs boson, and a gauge boson. Apart from the commutator interaction, our basis is equivalent to the commonly used operator set from ref. [47]."

            "text": "Our primary goal in this subsection is constructing a complete basis set of operators for axion interactions appropriate for characterizing flavor conserving and flavor violating axion interactions. We begin by writing the fermions in eq. (2.16) as a vector \u03c8 with a diagonal mass matrix M\u03c8. Correspondingly, from eq. (2.18), we identify the terms proportional to\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nXB with the anti-commutator {M\u03c8,X\u03c8A}, where X \u03c8 A is the so-called axial PQ charge matrix, and we identify the terms proportional to Xd and Xu with the commutator [M\u03c8,X\u03c8V ] for the vector-like PQ charge matrix X\u03c8V . For the E anomalons, the axial and vector-like PQ charge matrices are XEA = XBCE and XEV = XdCE , while the N anomalons have equivalent expressions XNA = XBCN and XNV = XuCN , where\nCE = 1 2 ( cos(2\u03b1E) sin(2\u03b1E) sin(2\u03b1E) \u2212 cos(2\u03b1E) ) , CN = 1 2 ( cos(2\u03b1N ) sin(2\u03b1N ) sin(2\u03b1N ) \u2212 cos(2\u03b1N ) ) . (3.1)\nWe remark that the diagonal entries of X\u03c8V do not contribute to the commutator with M\u03c8 but are chosen such that X\u03c8V commutes with X \u03c8 A. Including the interactions with the scalar fields \u03c6K in the Higgs basis, we can write the Yukawa interaction Lagrangian at order 1/fa as L\u03c8,Yuk\u2283\u2212 \u2211 K ( vK+\u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304Y\u03c8K\u03c8\u2212i a fa vK+\u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304{Y\u03c8K ,X \u03c8 A}\u03b35\u03c8\u2212i a fa vK+\u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304[Y\u03c8K ,X \u03c8 V ]\u03c8 ) ,\n(3.2)\nwhere the Yukawa matrices Y\u03c8K are defined in the mass basis of the fermions via M\u03c8 \u2261\u2211 K Y \u03c8 KvK/ \u221a 2. This structure is equivalent to the first-order approximation of an exponential interaction,\nL\u03c8,Yuk ' \u2212 \u2211 K vK + \u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304 exp ( i(X\u03c8V \u2212X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) Y\u03c8K exp ( \u2212i(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) \u03c8 . (3.3)\nWe note that the ordering of X\u03c8V and X \u03c8 A in the exponent is free since both matrices commute. In order to identify all possible axion interactions which originate from the most general fermion Lagrangian, we now include the covariant derivatives of the fermions. The general Lagrangian describing all terms which involve \u03c8 is then given by\nL\u03c8 \u2283 i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u00b5\u2202\u00b5\u03c8\n\u2212 \u2211 K vK + \u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304 exp ( i(X\u03c8V \u2212X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) Y\u03c8K exp ( \u2212i(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) \u03c8\n+ \u2211 I gI \u03c8\u0304A I \u00b5\u03b3 \u00b5(Q\u03c8IV + Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35)\u03c8 . (3.4)\nHere, I denotes the gauge group and AI\u00b5 = AIa\u00b5 T aI the corresponding gauge bosons. The gauge interactions of the fermions are defined by a vector-like and an axial charge matrix, Q\u03c8IV and Q \u03c8 IA, which would include the CKM matrix in the case of SU(2)L gauge bosons. We have now specified all of the axion couplings at dimension 4 and dimension 5 defined by our model. At one-loop, these couplings will induce axion interactions with gauge bosons at the same order in 1/fa. Moreover, following Fujikawa\u2019s derivation [48] of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw U(1) chiral anomaly, axial phase rotations of the fermions will also cause shifts in the axion couplings to gauge bosons.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nSince eq. (3.2) encodes the entire flavor structure of the axion coupling to fermions, we can perform the chiral transformation\n\u03c8 \u2192 exp ( i(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a\nfa\n) \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304 \u2192 \u03c8\u0304 exp ( \u2212i(X\u03c8V \u2212X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a\nfa\n) (3.5)\nfor each type of fermion to generate a set of operators at order 1/fa which is closed under chiral fermion transformations. This transformation removes the axion couplings from the Yukawa interactions and shifts them into the gauge interactions and a derivative interaction,\nL\u03c8 \u2192 i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u00b5\u2202\u00b5\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5a\nfa \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u00b5(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35)\u03c8\n\u2212 \u03c8\u0304M\u03c8\u03c8 \u2212 \u2211 K \u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304Y\u03c8K\u03c8\n+ \u2211 I gI \u03c8\u0304A I \u00b5\u03b3 \u00b5 exp ( \u2212i(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) (Q\u03c8IV + Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35) exp ( i(X\u03c8V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35) a fa ) \u03c8 + a fa \u2211 I,J APQIJ gIgJ (4\u03c0)2F a I\u00b5\u03bdF\u0303 a,\u00b5\u03bd J . (3.6)\nThe anomalous coupling to gauge bosons in the last row is determined by Fujikawa\u2019s method [48]. It is proportional to the anomaly coefficient APQIJ given by\nAPQIJ = \u2211 i,j,k T (RIk)(XijRQ ik IRQ kj JR \u2212X ij LQ ik ILQ kj JL)\n= 2 \u2211 i,j,k T (RIk)(XijV (Q ik IVQ kj JA +Q ik IAQ kj JV ) +X ij A (Q ik IVQ kj JV +Q ik IAQ kj JA)) , (3.7)\nwhere T (RIf ) is the Dynkin index given by tr [ T aRT b R ] \u2261 T (R)\u03b4ab [33] with RIf denoting the representation of fermion f under gauge group I. In case of a U(1) gauge symmetry, it simply counts the multiplicity.\nWe now focus on the third line of eq. (3.6) with exponential factors in the gauge boson couplings to axions. At leading order in 1/fa, these interactions are\nL\u03c8,gauge\u2192 \u2211 I gI \u03c8\u0304A I \u00b5\u03b3 \u00b5(Q\u03c8IV +Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35)\u03c8+i a fa \u2211 I gI \u03c8\u0304A I \u00b5\u03b3 \u00b5[Q\u03c8IV +Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35,X \u03c8 V +X \u03c8 A\u03b35]\u03c8 .\n(3.8)\nWe see that the axial transformation from eq. (3.5) induces a current which contains the commutator of the gauge charge matrix and the PQ charge matrix, defined by\nJ\u00b5,a[I,PQ] \u2261 \u2211 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304T aI \u03b3 \u00b5[Q\u03c8IV + Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35,X \u03c8 V + X \u03c8 A\u03b35]\u03c8\n= \u2211 i,j,k \u03c8\u0304iT a I \u03b3 \u00b5(QikIV +QikIA\u03b35)(X kj V +X kj A \u03b35)\u03c8j + h.c. . (3.9)\nWe note the current is only non-vanishing if both charge matrices are not flavor-conserving.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nUsing our results from this section, we now have the general axion interaction basis at order 1/fa including possible flavor-violation effects,\nL\u03c8,axion\u2283\u2212 \u2202\u00b5a\n2fa \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u00b5(C\u03c81V +C \u03c8 1A\u03b35)\u03c8+\ni 2 a fa \u03c8\u0304[M\u03c8,C\u03c82V ]\u03c8+ i 2 a fa \u03c8\u0304{M\u03c8,C\u03c82A}\u03b35\u03c8\n+ i2 a\nfa \u2211 K \u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304[Y\u03c8K ,C \u03c8 KV ]\u03c8+ i 2 a fa \u2211 K \u03c6K\u221a 2 \u03c8\u0304{Y\u03c8K ,C \u03c8 KA}\u03b35\u03c8\n\u2212 i2 a\nfa \u2211 I gI \u03c8\u0304A I \u00b5\u03b3 \u00b5[Q\u03c8IV +Q \u03c8 IA\u03b35,C \u03c8 IV +C \u03c8 IA\u03b35]\u03c8+ a fa \u2211 I,J CIJ3 gIgJ (4\u03c0)2F a I\u00b5\u03bdF\u0303 a,\u00b5\u03bd J .\n(3.10)\nThis Lagrangian now describes a closed set of operators under chiral fermion transformations. We remark the first term of the third line is a new dimension-5 operator which couples the axion and a gauge boson to a fermion current that only appears for flavor-changing fermion interactions. We will see in subsection 4.2 that all of these terms are necessary as a basis invariant description of the effective axion coupling to a gauge boson and a scalar boson. In particular, the closure of the operator basis in eq. (3.10) can be seen by noting that a further general axial transformation from eq. (3.5) shifts the Lagrangian couplings in eq. (3.10) via\nC\u03c81V/A \u2192 C \u03c8 1V/A + 2X \u03c8 V/A , C \u03c8 2V/A \u2192 C \u03c8 2V/A \u2212 2X \u03c8 V/A ,\nC\u03c8KV/A \u2192 C \u03c8 KV/A \u2212 2X \u03c8 V/A , C \u03c8 IV/A \u2192 C \u03c8 IV/A \u2212 2X \u03c8 V/A ,\nCIJ3 \u2192 CIJ3 +APQIJ . (3.11)\nHaving established the framework for axion interactions closed under axial transformations, we now apply our result to the fermions, vectors and scalars from our model."

In addition, the diagram in figure 2(f) consists of a mixing of the axion into an internal off-shell gauge boson propagator which then couples to the Higgs: this kinetic mixing vanishes for AJ\u00b5 being on-shell. We remark that this effective interaction has also\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K\nCeffIK\n(a)\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K\n\u03c8i\n\u03c8j\n\u03c8k\n(b)\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K \u03c8i\n\u03c8j\n\u03c8k\n(c)\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K\n\u03c8i\n\u03c8k\n(d)\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K\n\u03c8j\n\u03c8k\n(e)\na\nAI\u00b5\n\u03c6K\n\u03c8i\n\u03c8j\nAJ\u00b5\n(f)\nFigure 2.

[50] as an bottom-up discriminator of the coupling origin of the pseudoscalar SM singlet to the Higgs and Z boson. In comparison to ref. [50], we must include one additional diagram in figure 2(e) because of the commutator from eq. (3.8). Now, we calculate the effective coefficient in the heavy fermion limit. For the diagram in figure 2(f), we define the coupling of a scalar to gauge bosons as\nL \u2283 12(\u03c6K + vK) 2 (\u2211\nI\ngIQ K I A I \u00b5 )(\u2211 J gJQ K J A J\u00b5 ) . (4.7)\nWe see that the coupling linear in \u03c6K is proportional to vK , and thus the gauge bosons must be massive. In particular, scalar fields orthogonal to a vev do not induce this diagram in the Higgs basis.\nThe effective coefficient then reads\nCeffIK = 1 (4\u03c0)2 1 fa 1\u221a 2 \u2211 i,j,k Nk\n( 2C0(0,0,0,mi,mj ,mk)\n\u03bb(m2a,m2K ,m2I)\n\u00d7(mi+mj)((Cji1A+C ji 2A)Q ik IAY kj K +(C ij 1A+C ij 2A)Y jk K Q ki IA) \u00d7 ( m2I(m2I\u2212m2a\u2212m2K)(mi\u2212mj)(mj+mk)\u2212\u03bb(m2a,m2K ,m2I)(mimk+m2j ) ) \u22122(mi+mj)((Cji1A+C ji 2A)Q ik IAY kj K +(C ij 1A+C ij 2A)Y jk K Q ki IA)B0(0,mk,mi) +(mj\u2212mk)((Cji1A+C ji IA)Q ik IAY kj K +(C ij 1A+C ij IA)Y jk K Q ki IA)B0(0,mj ,mk) \u2212 \u2211 J,L g2JQ K I Q K J vKvL m2J (mi+mj)((Cji1A+C ji 2A)Q ik JAY kj L +(C ij 1A+C ij 2A)Y jk L Q ki JA)B0(0,mi,mj) )\n+O ( m2a,I,K m2i,k,j ) . (4.8)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nFor this result, we needed to take the heavy fermion limit of the B0 function given by\nB0(m2b ,mf1 ,mf2) =B0(0,mf1 ,mf2)+O (\nm2b m2f1 ,m 2 f2\n)\n= 1 \u2212\u03b3E+ln(4\u03c0)+ln\n( \u00b52\nmf1mf2\n) +1\u2212 12 m2f1 +m 2 f2\nm2f1\u2212m 2 f2 ln ( m2f1 m2f2 ) +O ( m2b m2f1 ,m 2 f2 ) . (4.9)\nIn this case the divergence of B0 does not cancel trivially, but for our case of interest, we have a vanishing divergence. For example, extracting the divergent term for the color-singlet case, Nk = 1, we get\nCeffIK = 1 (4\u03c0)2 1 fa 1\u221a 2 1\n( T\u2212 ( YK ,M,QIA,C2A \u2212CIA ) + T+ ( YK ,M,QIA,C1A + C2A )\n\u2212 \u2211 J,L g2JQ K I Q K J vKvL m2J T+ ( YL,M,QJA,C1A + C2A )) +O( 0) , (4.10)\nwhere we used the notation\nT+(A,B,C,D) = Tr[{A,C}{B,D}] + Tr[{B,C}{A,D}] , (4.11) T\u2212(A,B,C,D) = Tr[{A,C}{B,D}]\u2212 Tr[{B,C}{A,D}] = Tr[[B,A][C,D]] . (4.12)\nIn the Higgs basis, we have the relation\ngJQ K I vL\nmJ = \u03b4IJ\u03b4KL , (4.13)\nsuch that the divergent term simplifies to\nCeffIK = 1 (4\u03c0)2 1 fa\n1 T\u2212 ( YK ,M,QIA,C2A \u2212CIA ) +O( 0) . (4.14)\nFor the anomalons, the commutator [M,YK ] vanishes and thus the divergence cancels. Again, the result in eq. (4.8) is invariant under chiral basis transformations, as seen using the transformation properties in eq. (3.11). This check requires the inclusion of the diagram in figure 2(e) in the flavor-violating case. We also observe that the Wilson coefficient only depends on axial gauge charges, leading to couplings for Z and Z \u2032 bosons but not the photon."

(4.26)\nFor the above approximations, we assumed that the Yukawa couplings |yL|, |yE | and |yN | are 4\u03c0/3 and the other Yukawa couplings are of order 1. In addition, we assumed that we can use the small angle approximation for the angles \u03b3, \u03b412 and \u03b434. We highlight that the axion diphoton coupling is significantly suppressed, as a result of the fact that the flavor-conserving interactions of the axion to the charged anomalons come with opposite signs, and so the induced remainder is proportional to the mass difference of the charged anomalons. The same would be true for the axion coupling to two Z \u2032 bosons, but the coupling shifts owing to the kinetic mixing are important. Hence, in contrast to standard axion EFTs where the diphoton and the digluon coupling dominate, we find the coefficients Ceff\u03b3Z , CeffZZ and CeffWW as the most important coefficients. We will investigate the corresponding implications in subsection 5.1, when we consider collider-scale masses for the axion.\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nAlthough we have prescribed a DFSZ-like structure for the QCD axion, we will expand the model to include the possibility of non-QCD instanton contributions to the axion mass. For this purpose, we will distinguish a QCD axion and an ALP via their topological susceptibility \u03c7 defined by eq. (2.9), which fixes the relationship between ma and fa. The Z \u2032 mass and the anomalon masses also implicitly depend on fa since in the invisible axion limit, fa is mainly composed of v\u2032 as shown in subsection 2.1 with fa = Xc\u22121\u03b3 v\u2032s\u03b2\u2032c\u03b2\u2032 . The corresponding relations are\nmZ\u2032 = 3gBv\u2032 = 3c\u03b3gBfa Xs\u03b2\u2032c\u03b2\u2032 , manom \u2261 \u03a3E,N \u00b1\u2206E,N 2 fa \u2248 4\u03c0 3\nfa\nXs\u03b2\u2032 \u221a 2 . (4.27)\nThus, to have a mZ\u2032 which is smaller than the mass scale of the anomalons but allows a sizeable gauge coupling gB we can assume the case of maximal mixing between the additional scalar fields (\u03b2\u2032 = \u03c0/4). As a last detail, we normalize our results analogously to the canonical form of the GG\u0303 operator in the literature by rescaling with the PQ charge normalization X. Namely, we write X \u2261 12Agg where Agg describes the color anomaly defined by\nL \u2283 g 2 s\n(4\u03c0)2XAgg a fa Ga\u00b5\u03bdG\u0303\na\u00b5\u03bd = g 2 s\n32\u03c02 a fa Ga\u00b5\u03bdG\u0303 a\u00b5\u03bd . (4.28)\nIn our model, where only the SM fermions couple to the gluons, we get Agg = 3 and thus X = 16 . Hence, our parameters simplify to mZ\u2032 \u2248 36gBfa and manom \u2248 8\u03c0fa. This leaves us with two independent parameters for a model with a QCD axion, gB and fa, as well as a third parameter \u03c7 for an ALP. We can also trade fa or \u03c7 in favor of having ma as a free parameter as well as fa or gB in favor of having a free mZ\u2032 . Now that we have determined the exact form of the Wilson coefficients from the complete set of operators, presented in the Lagrangian in eq. (3.13), we can discuss the varied phenomenological implications of this model."

Hence, to study the patterns of ALP branching ratios, we only need to specify the Z \u2032 mass and fa.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\nFigure 3. Branching ratios of the ALP, fixing mZ\u2032 = 1TeV and the ALP decay constant fa = 500GeV.\nIn figure 3, we set the Z \u2032 mass to 1TeV and fa = 500GeV and show the ALP branching ratios as a function of its mass. The decay into two leptons sums over all charged leptons, while the decay into quarks sums over the first five quark flavors. As evident from the figure, the most dominant decays are to quarks, if the ALP is below the top threshold, or to two top quarks, once the ALP mass increases above 2mt. This feature arises solely from the ALP coupling to the mass of the fermions. The coupling to two gluons mirrors the coupling to two photons, reflecting the DFSZ nature of the ALP interactions and the near absence of the diphoton coupling from anomalons. The exotic mode of a\u2192 hZ becomes enhanced near the top threshold and reaches 10%, making it an exciting prospect for discovery. For high ALP masses the decays into WW , ZZ and \u03b3Z start to take over. These decays correspond to the anomalon mediated decays which are not suppressed as shown in eq. (4.16). Another decay which is dominantly mediated by the anomalons is a \u2192 hZ \u2032. The corresponding Wilson coefficient in eq. (4.17) changes sign at m2a = m2h+ 4m2Z\u2032 + \u221a 16m2hm2Z\u2032 + 9m4Z\u2032 , such that the branching ratio has a minimum at this ALP mass. To analyze the Z \u2032 branching fractions as shown in figure 4, we fix the ALP mass ma = 1GeV and gB = 0.5. Of course, the dominant Z \u2032 decay mode is to two quarks, owing to the gauged baryon number, and qq\u0304 annihilation is the main production mode for the Z \u2032 at the LHC.

The resulting constraints in the {mZ\u2032 , gB} plane are shown in figure 5. We remark that the current WW and h\u03b3 final states probe unrealistically large baryon number gauge couplings, and instead are shown to indicate their relative strength compared to the other collider and indirect probes. We also show the most recent update from dijet resonance searches [20] for comparison as well as the limit on charged anomalons from the ALEPH and L3 collaborations at LEP [57, 58]. The most dominant decay channel is the dijet decay, Z \u2032 \u2192 q\u0304q, which has already been reviewed recently in ref. [20]. As evident from figure 4, the leading exotic decays are Z \u2032 \u2192 ah, Z \u2032 \u2192WW , and Z \u2032 \u2192 ZZ, while the Wess-Zumino interaction is probed via the Z \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3Z decay. From the collider perspective, the relatively suppression of the Z \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3Z decay in comparison to the others is overcome by the enhanced efficiency for signal photon and leptons and small backgrounds, making the \u03b3Z channel the dominant probe of the exotic Z \u2032 decays.

We first discuss the overall status of the diphoton coupling constraint and its interpretation in our model context. Afterwards we focus on the resulting constraints from narrow resonance searches at the LHC, emphasized separately in figure 7, provided by various production modes in our model. Since we focus on the parameter space where the ALP mass ma > 1MeV for which the canonical QCD axion is disfavored, we must keep the SM fermions and anomalons dynamical in loop functions. In particular, recent literature has emphasized the collider scale in context of high-quality axions, where the axion is buffered from UV effects and the topological susceptibility is enlarged [41, 78\u201383]. The expression for Ga\u03b3\u03b3 , defined previously in eq. (3.13), is\nGa\u03b3\u03b3 = \u2211\nf\u2208SM,E1,2\n2e2\n\u03c02fa NfQ\n2 fX f A m2f m2a ln\n2m2f \u2212m2a + \u221a m4a \u2212 4m2am2f\n2m2f 2 , (5.4) where axial PQ charges of the anomalons XE1,2A = \u00b1 cos(2\u03b1E)XB/2 were defined in eq. (3.1). The diphoton contribution coming from mass mixings with QCD mesons is suppressed by \u039b4QCD/\u03c7 and is therefore neglected. We emphasize that considering the full contribution from SM fermions as well as from anomalons provides a robust prediction for the diphoton coupling of the axion at larger scales. The corresponding lines are shown in the {ma, Ga\u03b3\u03b3}-plane in figure 6 for the topological susceptibilities \u221a\u03c7 \u2208 {(102 GeV)2, (103 GeV)2, (104 GeV)2}. The dashed lines correspond to the lines without threshold effects which clearly deviate for ALP masses above the bottom quark threshold and strongly deviate above the top threshold. The purple shaded region corresponds to searches for charged heavy leptons by the ALEPH and L3 collaborations, which exclude masses manom < 90GeV [57, 58]. This implies a lower bound on fa & 5GeV which we can derive from the mass of the lighter electron anomalon given by eq. (2.17) and the relationship between v\u2032 and fa from eq. (4.27), using Yukawa couplings of 4\u03c0/3 and anomalon mixing angles of \u03b2 = 0.05 and \u03b2\u2032 = \u03c0/4. For this fixed fa bound, we use eq. (5.4) to extract an upper bound on Ga\u03b3\u03b3 , shown as the purple line labeled manom < 90GeV. We remark that this line, for ma . 2mt, is roughly independent of ma since the fixed fa can be considered independent of varying ma by rescaling the topological susceptibility. The increased sensitivity in Ga\u03b3\u03b3 from the anomalon bound above ma & 2mt arises from the logarithmic dependence on ma for light fermion masses in eq.

Constraints in the {ma, Ga\u03b3\u03b3}-plane for ALP masses ma > 1MeV for the anomalon mixing angle \u03b1E = \u03c0/4. The predicted ALP-diphoton couplings are shown for \u221a \u03c7 \u2208 {(102 GeV)2, (103 GeV)2, (104 GeV)2} as solid lines with threshold corrections from fermion masses. For comparison, we illustrate the naive expectation if threshold effects were ignored as dashed lines. The purple shaded region corresponds to manom < 90GeV, excluded from searches by the ALEPH and L3 collaborations [57, 58]. The updated constraints on exotic ALP signatures at colliders are covered in detail in figure 7. The canonical experimental and cosmological bounds are obtained from refs. [22\u201324, 59\u201377].\nWe now focus on the collider searches for ALPs with ma > 100GeV, as shown in figure 7. Considering the full contribution for the diphoton coupling in this model enhances previously set constraints that were established for a general ALP. We simulate the ALP cross section from gluon fusion using MadGraph 5 [56] as before and apply the full expressions for the branching ratios into the resonance search channels \u03b3\u03b3, hZ, ZZ, and Z\u03b3 [51, 53\u201355]. Although the DFSZ-type ALP typically has a dominant decay into tt\u0304 above the top threshold, interpreting the collider constraints is highly non-trivial because of large interference effects between the continuum tt\u0304 production from gluons and the ALP signal that can wash away the expected resonance [84]. We leave the derivation of ALP constraints in the tt\u0304 final state for future work. For the ALP, the \u03b3\u03b3 resonance searches are the most constraining, since other channels are more suppressed and also have weaker collider sensitivity from larger backgrounds. We emphasize that considering the full contribution for the diphoton coupling leads to a significant shift at the top threshold that is a consequence of the ALP coupling to the top quark. As a result, we see that many of the exotic decays for the ALP can be competitive and exceed the sensitivity from the diphoton channel, and we expect that further gains in sensitivity will come when these searches are analyzed with available luminosity.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\n150 350 600 1000 2000 3000 ma[GeV] 10 3 10 2 10 1\n100 101 f 1 a [G eV 1 ]\na a Z a hZ a ZZ\nALEPH/L3 limit mafa = (102 GeV)2 mafa = (103 GeV)2\nFigure 7.

The purple line corresponds to the anomalon mass limit from ALEPH and L3 collaborations [57, 58] interpreted as a constraint on fa following eq. (2.17) and eq. (4.27)."

            "text": "In this work, we have studied a DFSZ-type axion model in an gauged baryon-number extension of the Standard Model. Our aim was to establish the patterns of axion and Z \u2032 effective couplings when a canonical anomalous global symmetry of the quarks, namely baryon number, is promoted to a gauge symmetry, in the particular case when the quarks also carry the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. We calculated the Wilson coefficients which arise at low energies in a general way accounting for possible flavor-violating interactions as well as for U(1) basis transformations of the interacting fermions. For this purpose we set up a general axion interaction basis which contains operators which do not appear in the flavor conserving limit, like the axion coupling to a gauge boson and the commutator current J\u00b5,a[I,PQ]. We found that this operator also appears in the standard DFSZ model for the interactions to the W bosons, reflecting the flavor-changing effects from the CKM matrix. Some new Wilson coefficients in our EFT include interactions between the axion, Z \u2032 and \u03b3 and the axion, Z \u2032 and Higgs boson, which provide novel decay modes for both the axion or the Z \u2032 boson, depending on the mass hierarchy. Our charged anomalons also characteristically canceled in their contributions to the axion-diphoton coupling, with the residual coupling only driven by the SM fermions. We then presented the phenomenology of the model, encompassing both the new decay channels of the axion and the Z \u2032 boson from the effective description. We showed the ALP\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 7 8\ncan have a relatively large branching fraction to hZ nearing 10%, while the dominant decay above the top threshold is to tt\u0304, which requires a special analysis given the non-trivial interference with the continuum top pair production which we leave for future work. Present limits from narrow resonance searches at the LHC are derived and presented in the {mZ\u2032 , gB} plane in figure 5 and in the {ma, Ga\u03b3\u03b3} plane in figure 6. Our results systematically capture all of the diverse signals arising from the EFT description and demonstrate complementarity between the different search channels at the ATLAS and CMS experiments, especially those beyond the \u03b3\u03b3 coupling typically studied for axions and ALPs."
