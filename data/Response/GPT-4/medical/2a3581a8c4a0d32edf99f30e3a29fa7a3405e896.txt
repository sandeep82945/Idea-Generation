Development and Validation of Enhanced RDTs: Investigate the development of new or improved RDTs that can semi-quantitatively estimate parasitaemia levels more accurately. This could involve the incorporation of additional biomarkers or more sensitive detection technologies that can distinguish between different parasitaemia thresholds, thereby providing a more detailed prognosis and guiding treatment decisions more effectively.

Longitudinal Studies on Post-Treatment Antigen Persistence: Conduct longitudinal studies to monitor the persistence of malaria antigens, such as HRP-2, in patients after successful antimalarial treatment. These studies could help to understand the duration and clinical significance of antigen persistence, potentially leading to the development of guidelines for interpreting RDT results in the context of recent malaria treatment and distinguishing between new infections and lingering antigenemia.

Haematological Parameters as Indicators of Malaria Severity: Further research into the relationship between specific haematological parameters (or their ratios) and the severity of malaria, with a focus on identifying any potential biomarkers that could serve as early indicators of severe malaria or complications. This could involve more detailed analyses of blood samples using advanced hematologic analyzers or exploring less commonly studied blood parameters that might correlate with disease severity.

Predictive Models Integrating Clinical and Laboratory Data: Develop and test multivariate predictive models that integrate clinical observations, patient history, haematological parameters, and RDT results to predict malaria severity, the risk of complications, and treatment outcomes. Machine learning algorithms could be utilized to analyze large datasets and identify patterns that might not be apparent through traditional statistical methods.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Malaria Management Protocols in Non-Endemic Settings: Perform comparative studies on the effectiveness of different malaria management protocols in non-endemic settings, particularly those that rely heavily on RDTs due to the lack of microscopy expertise. This research could identify best practices for the initial assessment, treatment, and follow-up of imported malaria cases, including the role of haematological parameters in guiding clinical decisions.
