1. **Investigate the relationship between self-care behaviors and clinical outcomes in patients with arterial hypertension.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study that follows patients with AH over time to assess how their self-care behaviors change and how these changes are associated with their clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure control, cardiovascular events, and mortality.


2. **Examine the effectiveness of interventions to improve self-care behaviors in patients with arterial hypertension.** This could be done by conducting randomized controlled trials that compare different interventions, such as educational programs, behavioral counseling, or mobile health apps, to usual care in terms of their ability to improve self-care behaviors and clinical outcomes in patients with AH.


3. **Develop and validate a shorter version of the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale.** This would make the scale more feasible to use in clinical practice and research settings, where time constraints may be a concern.


4. **Explore the use of the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale in different populations.** This could include studies that examine the scale's validity and reliability in different cultural and linguistic groups, as well as in patients with different types of hypertension, such as resistant hypertension or secondary hypertension.


5. **Investigate the relationship between self-care behaviors and health-related quality of life in patients with arterial hypertension.** This could be done by conducting studies that assess the impact of self-care behaviors on patients' physical, mental, and social well-being.
