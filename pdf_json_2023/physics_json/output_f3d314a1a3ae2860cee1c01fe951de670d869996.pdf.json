    "abstractText": "(1) Background: The detection of DNA double-strand breaks in vitro using the phosphorylated histone biomarker (\u03b3H2AX) is an increasingly popular method of measuring in vitro genotoxicity, as it is sensitive, specific and suitable for high-throughput analysis. The \u03b3H2AX response is either detected by flow cytometry or microscopy, the latter being more accessible. However, authors sparsely publish details, data, and workflows from overall fluorescence intensity quantification, which hinders the reproducibility. (2) Methods: We used valinomycin as a model genotoxin, two cell lines (HeLa and CHO-K1) and a commercial kit for \u03b3H2AX immunofluorescence detection. Bioimage analysis was performed using the open-source software ImageJ. Mean fluorescent values were measured using segmented nuclei from the DAPI channel and the results were expressed as the area-scaled relative fold change in \u03b3H2AX fluorescence over the control. Cytotoxicity is expressed as the relative area of the nuclei. We present the workflows, data, and scripts on GitHub. (3) Results: The outputs obtained by an introduced method are in accordance with expected results, i.e., valinomycin was genotoxic and cytotoxic to both cell lines used after 24 h of incubation. (4) Conclusions: The overall fluorescence intensity of \u03b3H2AX obtained from bioimage analysis appears to be a promising alternative to flow cytometry. Workflow, data, and script sharing are crucial for further improvement of the bioimage analysis methods.",

            "text": "The purpose of genotoxicity testing is to identify chemicals that can cause genetic alterations in cells [1]. In the last 50 years, a variety of in vitro and in vivo methods have been developed for the routine testing of chemicals, including genotoxicity testing. They comprise standardised procedures that are described in national and international guidelines (recently reviewed in [2,3]). There is substantial effort to fulfil the 3R concept (replacement, reduction, and refinement), i.e., to reduce in vivo experiments and to use human-relevant and reliable in vitro methods [4]. However, currently standardised in vitro methods for genotoxicity testing using mammalian cells (HPRT and TK assays, micronucleus assay) are tedious and not suitable for high-throughput testing. One of the promising markers of DNA damage response for genotoxicity assessment seems to be the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX [5]. H2AX represents the constitutively expressed and evolutionarily conserved variant of the H2A protein family that is a component of the histone octamer in nucleosomes. The\nToxins 2023, 15, 263. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15040263 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxins\nToxins 2023, 15, 263 2 of 13\nphosphorylation event at serine 139 in mammals, referred to as \u03b3H2AX, is connected to double stranded breaks (DSBs) and is one of the first reactions. This will trigger a chromatin condensation that appears to play a crucial role in the recruitment of damage signalling or repair factors to the site of the damage. The \u03b3H2AX could be the response not only to DSBs, but also to single-strand breaks, during replication stress, or to the fragmentation during cell apoptosis [6\u20138]. In vitro measurement of the \u03b3H2AX is an increasingly popular method of measuring genotoxicity in combination with other classical methods. The main advantages are the specificity and sensitivity of the system [3,5,9] and the list of immunoassays suitable for the \u03b3H2AX detection: Western blot, ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy, the last mentioned having the highest sensitivity [3,10]. Antibodies or commercial kits for \u03b3H2AX detection are available and suitable for flow cytometry as well as for microscopic analysis and other novel immuno-based methods [11]. Flow cytometry only allows us to measure overall fluorescence, whereas \u03b3H2AX detection by immunofluorescence microscopy is based either on the foci detection per cell (using a confocal microscope) or on the quantification of the overall intensity from images of lower magnification [10], the second mentioned approach being more suitable for highthroughput analysis in a 96-well plate format. With immunofluorescence, high-content screening (multiparametric analysis) is also possible [12]. Nuclei are routinely counterstained (by Hoechst 33342 or DAPI) and, in addition, cell viability (i.e., membrane integrity) can be simultaneously monitored using appropriate DNA-binding dyes (e.g., Image-iT DEAD Green\u2122 or 7-AAD) or combined with other biomarkers such as 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) [13]. Nevertheless, the multiparametric analysis increases the total time of analysis. Taking into account that the wide-field microscope is more commonly a part of biological laboratory equipment compared to the flow cytometer, bioimage analysis of the overall \u03b3H2AX signal appears to be an assay of choice for high-throughput genotoxicity screening of substances. In addition, fixed plates can be stored in a freezer for a short time and re-analysed or the original images can be databased and reanalysed, if necessary. Various authors used \u03b3H2AX detection by immunofluorescence microscopy; however, they either perform an automatic analysis on a specialised device with dedicated software or they use a commercial software (Table 1). Studies using open-source software for bioimage analysis are sparse and a detailed description of semiautomatic or automatic image analysis workflow is usually not provided.\nOpen-source bioimage analysis tools are highly preferred, as they enable reproducibility. Commercial platforms often focus on ease-of-use, but the details of the image processing algorithms are hidden. On the contrary, the details are completely transparent in opensource platforms [20]. Open source bioimage informatics tools (CellProfiler, Icy, ImageJ) for the analysis of DNA damage and associated biomarkers were reviewed in [21]. ImageJ is often a tool of choice, because of its long existence, wide adoption, and extensible plugin ar-\nToxins 2023, 15, 263 3 of 13\nchitecture, which means that anyone can access and modify the source code and everybody has access to a wealth of resources, such as tutorials and plugins. It also allows users to save the analysis steps as scripts, which can be rerun to obtain the same results on different data, ensuring that the results are reproducible [20]. In this study, we present a detection of DSBs in adherent mammalian cells in 96-well format using a commercially available kit (HSC Damage Kit, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA [22]) for better reproducibility, and the \u03b3H2AX response is evaluated using an inverted widefield fluorescence microscope. Valinomycin is used as a model genotoxic substance causing \u03b3H2AX positive response and is recommended by the kit manufacturer [22]. Image acquisition is automated (autofocus, motorised stage). The viability is evaluated from the area of Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei (non-viable cells are washed during the procedure and are not present) and the signal from \u03b3H2AX is measured as immunofluorescence intensity in the Cy3 channel. The last component of the kit, Image-iT DEAD Green, is not used in order to accelerate the image acquisition and to minimise the potential risk of leakage of the signal to other channels. The image automatic analysis is performed in the open-source software ImageJ."

These data were used to evaluate whether a compound induced a positive, negative, or equivocal response in the assay (scaling was adopted from Smart et al. [23], Table 2).

            "text": "Here, we propose a method for high-throughput genotoxicity testing based on \u03b3H2AX detection using immunofluorescence microscopy and automated bioimage analysis in open-source software.\nIn this pilot study, we made several simplifications:\n\u2022 We are aware of the fact that for the measurement of \u03b3H2AX response, cell lines derived from normal tissues are considered to be more reliable than those from cancer tissues [24]. Nevertheless, HeLa cell line was used as a model since it is recommended in the manual of the kit\u2019s manufacturer. The CHO-K1 cell line was used as the second cell type because it is a cell line used for the HPRT mutation assay accepted by OECD and EPA. \u2022 As a model compound, we only used valinomycin because it was used by the manufacturer of the kit. There was, therefore, no need to use metabolic activation, because valinomycin is genotoxic per se. \u2022 To accelerate image acquisition and to minimize the potential risk of channel-tochannel leakage, we presumed that dead cells were washed away during the preparation of the samples and, therefore, we did not use any additional dye to detect dead cells. \u2022 We used nuclei area, not number of nuclei, to evaluate cell mass. The general limitations are listed in Appendix A. The idea was to offer an alternative to \u03b3H2AX detection by flow cytometry [23]. Using this method, Smart et al. measured median FL1 fluorescence values (\u03b3H2AX) and evaluated the fold change in \u03b3H2AX signal and relative cell counts. Inspired by [25], we used similar parameters, i.e., mean fluorescence intensity values, MFV (\u03b3H2AX signal from Cy3 channel) in a region of interest (ROI), and area-scaled relative fold change in \u03b3H2AX fluorescence over the negative control. Our workflow was similar to that of [9]; however, contrary to that study, we provide a detailed description in an open-source software ImageJ. Instead of relative cell counts, we expressed cytotoxicity as relative area (RA) of the nuclei. As already mentioned, we did not directly quantify the number of nuclei in each well (mainly due to problems with nuclei on the edges); nevertheless, we propose that nuclei area is an easier and sufficient alternative to evaluate a cell mass in a well. We tried to compare our values with those from the commercial platform listed in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol [22] of the commercial kit we used. The same model compound (30\u00b5M valinomycin) and incubation time (24 h) were used; however, the cell lines were different. We digitalised the graph from the protocol (values in Table 5). \u03b3H2AX response is expressed as mean average intensity (\u03b3H2AX nuclear intensity); the analogous quantity MFV presented by us. The mean intensity over cell numbers, fold, and relative cell numbers were calculated similarly as MoA, fold, and RA (Equations (1)\u2013(3)). These results (cytotoxicity as well as the genotoxicity) are comparable with our results from CHO-K1 cell line (Table 4).\nWe observed differences between the two cell lines used. Valinomycin was more cytotoxic to the CHO-K1 cell line compared to the HeLa cell line. It is in agreement\nToxins 2023, 15, 263 7 of 13\nwith the studies confirming the rodent cell lines being consistently more susceptible to cytotoxicity [26]. The fold change after 4h incubation was higher in CHO-K1 cells probably because they rank among p53-compromised cell types [26]. Despite the recommendations of the kit manufacturer, the HepG2 cell line is often used, which not only offers the potential for metabolic activation of pro-mutagens (production of liver enzymes), but also meets the requirements for human non-tumour tissue lines [27]. The results obtained in this way can better correspond to real conditions [28,29]. Compared to flow cytometry, we observed higher fold changes after 24 h, especially in HeLa cells. The high score after 24 h can be false positive due to increased apoptosis, because DNA degradation as a consequence of apoptosis is known to induce \u03b3H2AX [15,30], especially after incubation with valinomycin [31]. Moreover, the high toxicity of valinomycin and its mechanism of action suggest that it is not a suitable positive control for such genotoxicity tmeasurements [32]. The number of cells evaluated was lower in our case of microscopic analysis (1000\u20133000 objects per well) compared to flow cytometry (104 nuclei [23]). This probably caused the higher deviations (or higher interquartile change in our case). Overall, our results suggest that the microscopy-based validation of genotoxicity on the cells is consistent with other methods [9,23]. The detection of overall fluorescence intensity using microscopic bioimage analysis seems to be more sensitive than by using a spectrophotometer, as in [33]. In this case, results may be inaccurate due to non-specific antibody binding, or, in the case of foci, the signal may be so weak that it can easily be confused with noise."

Workflow, data, and script sharing are crucial for further improvement of the bioimage analysis methods. Our future work will be based on the implementation of more cell models, recruitment of metabolic activation by S9 mix and more model compounds, and finally on the validation of this workflow within laboratories."

            "text": "A reproducible image analysis workflow is a collection of tools and resources that enable anyone to replicate the process of handling and analysing images, with the goal of obtaining the same results. This workflow package consists of three key components:\n\u2022 A description of the workflow; \u2022 The code of the workflow; \u2022 The original image data.\n5.5.1. Description of the Workflow\nIn this paper, we present a reproducible image analysis workflow [34,35] to allow replication of the image handling and analysis process. The workflow is based on the idea of Smart et al. [23]. The authors used flow cytometry and introduced useful genotoxicity evaluation criteria for the \u03b3H2AX (Table 2). \u201cMedian FL1 (H2AX) fluorescence values were extracted and expressed as relative fold change in H2AX fluorescence over control, alongside cytotoxicity RCC changes (% co trol); these data were u ed to determine whether a compound induced a positive, negative or equivocal response in the assay.\u201d [23]. i to ado t thes eval i it t ated immunofluorescence microscopy. e n the thresholding of DAPI stained nuclei in cha l 2 and brightnes value analysi in the Cy3 channel. The main parameters of interest for analysis re the area of e ch nuclei obje t and the mean bright ess of each bje t from the Cy3 channel, which are used for comparison across wells. The orkflo consists of three main steps: sorting of data, image analysis, and feature analysis. The sorting step uses an ImageJ macro script that expects images to be named following the convention \u201cChannelName_YYYYMMD_Well_PositionInWell_AcqRun.FileFormat\u201d and creates a set of subfolders for each well. The image analysis step is performed using another ImageJ macro, which detects nuclei through automatic Otsu thresholding and computes the area and brightness for each object. Finally, the feature analysis step is performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook, where specified wells are statistically compared, and fold changes are calculated.\nToxins 2023, 15, 263 10 of 13\n5.5.2. The Code of the Workflow and the Original Image Data\nThe complete workflow package, including all scripts and notebooks, is publicly available through published data and GitHub, allowing for the easy replication and verification of results.\nImageJ macro-overview This protocol documents an image data flow utilised and inspired by CLIJx-Assistant [36].\n1. We start our image data flow with image_1, a DAPI channel with nuclei. 2. Following this, we apply \u201cCopy\u201d on image_1 and obtain a new image out, image_2. 3. As the next step, we apply \u201cOtsu\u201d auto threshold on image_2 and obtain a new image\nmask out, image_3. The threshold values are saved and used on all DAPI images from the same well.\n4. Afterward, we apply \u201cAnalyze Particles\u201d on image_3, and single out a region of nuclei as a Region of Interest (ROI) set. All ROIs touching edges are skipped. 5. In the next step, we open image_4, which is the Cy3 channel. We apply \u201cCopy\u201d on image_4, and obtain a new image, image_5. 6. We apply background subtraction with s rolling ball of size 50 on image_5 to subtract the local background value from intensity measurements, and obtain image_6. 7. Afterward, image_6 is selected for measuring features under ROIs from the previous step. 8. The process Log and measured features from Cy3 channel for the whole well and\nsummary are saved in the \u201cResults\u201d subfolder in the CSV table. A flattened image_4 with ROIs outlined is saved as a JPEG for later inspection.\nThe macro logs version of ImageJ and BioImage plugin version on each run was tested in ImageJ version 1.53t99 [37]. The logs also contain information about image size, count of objects, and threshold values. While using the ImageJ Macro Markdown plugin, it is possible to extract a protocol documenting the analysis of the selected well. The code for the version used in this paper is available on Zenodo and on GitHub (links in a section \u201cData and software availability statement\u201d)."

The results indicate that none of the measured data follow a normal distribution; non-parametric measures were therefore employed. Mainly, the interquartile range (IQR) was utilised as a measure of dispersion instead of the standard deviation (STD) typically used. As for the relative area and folds (calculated as the brightness values of the treated sample over the control values), they were presented without IQR since only a single statistically descriptive value was used.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/toxins15040263/s1, Table S1: p-values after 4 h treatment, Table S2: p-values\nToxins 2023, 15, 263 11 of 13\nafter 24 h treatment.

            "text": "Limitations: Even though the authors did their best by using the best available methods for data acquisition, data quality control, and data processing, there are several limitations to the presented approach that must still be considered. The resolution of optical microscopy is limited by the wavelength of light used, which means that small details may be difficult to see. Additionally, the images produced can be still slightly distorted due to factors such as aberrations, diffraction, and scattering. The depth of field and field of view is also limited, which can make it challenging to see the entire specimen in focus. Image processing techniques during acquisition can also introduce artifacts, distorting the image and making it challenging to interpret. Most of the abovementioned factors are dependent on the type of microscope used and its setting, which is included in this paper."
