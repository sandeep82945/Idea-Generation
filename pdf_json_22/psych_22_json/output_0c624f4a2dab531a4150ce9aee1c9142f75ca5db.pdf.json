    "abstractText": "A principal goal of sleep research is to explain how the brain controls different features of sleep and how dysregulation of these mechanisms results in human sleep disorders. For decades, scientists investigating these themes have primarily focused their studies on a handful of mammalian species, including humans, mice, rats, and to a lesser extent, cats and primates. Growing evidence now suggests that there is considerable diversity in sleep expression across the animal kingdom that may not be adequately represented by traditional models. For example, a single sleep cycle lasts for about 90 minutes in humans but only several minutes in rodents and less than a minute in birds. Humans and flies predominantly sleep during the night, while most of the sleep time in mice and rats occurs during the day. Unlike rodents, humans do not display cortical theta oscillations during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Moreover, some species, like the platypus, display cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics in REM sleep that are typically attributed to NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep [1]. Because these differences likely signify diversity in the neuronal mechanisms underlying sleep features, it is important to consider whether commonly used animal models that differ considerably from humans in their activity rhythms and sleep architecture have sufficiently similar circuitry to model human sleep disorders. In this issue of SLEEP, Bukhtiyarova et al. provide a detailed characterization of the sleep\u2013wake cycle in the diurnal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) using simultaneous EEG and local field potential (LFP) recordings from several neocortical and hippocampal regions [2]. Marmosets were found to have relatively long sleep bouts, distinct NREM sleep stages, and typical NREM sleep oscillatory patterns, including cortical spindles, slow waves, and hippocampal ripples [2]. Moreover, NREM sleep slow wave activity in the common marmoset decreased with sleep time, while REM sleep duration increased throughout the course of the night, as in humans. The authors concluded that the common marmoset shares more sleep features with humans than do traditional animal models and may serve as a valuable model for human sleep research. Sleep research additionally aims to explain why we sleep. For this reason, scientists seek to reveal a shared core/primary function/s displayed by all animals that sleep. The premise is that the core function/s of sleep, rather than its secondary/derived functions, enabled the conservation of sleep throughout evolutionary history by conferring advantages significant enough to outweigh the numerous costs of sleeping, e.g., physical vulnerability and inability to reproduce, forage, and learn. In this context, restricting studies to a limited set of animal species may mislead efforts to identify the primary functions of sleep. For example, memory consolidation was regarded by many as the core function of sleep [3] until animals without centralized nervous systems were also discovered to sleep [4], casting doubt on this premise. Successful investigation into both the neuronal circuitry underlying sleep architecture and the evolutionary functions of sleep, therefore, necessitates increased diversity in experimental species. To advance the current understanding of the evolutionary history and functions of sleep, sleep research also aims to pinpoint features of sleep that have been shaped by natural selection. Current evidence suggests that sleep can be modulated by environmental and ecological conditions, yet mammalian models are predominantly investigated in single-housed and tethered conditions within simple, controlled environments that are not germane to their natural habitat.

Social interactions can also modulate sleep duration and intensity in rodents, flies, and bees [8\u201310]. Moreover, some animal species, including great frigatebirds and bottlenose dolphins, can forgo sleep for extended periods of time with no apparent side effects or subsequent sleep rebound [11, 12], while in others, including rats and flies, chronic sleep loss may result in death. This diversity calls for sleep studies that incorporate more ecologically complex conditions.\nDue to technological limitations, scientists have historically utilized conventional behavioral indices (e.g., quiescence, a recumbent posture, and eye closure) to identify sleep in complex environments. While these studies have provided important insights into the diversity of sleep across species, relying solely on behavioral measures to quantify sleep has drawbacks. For example, behavioral observations typically preclude detailed characterization of sleep architecture and quantification of sleep depth. Moreover, sleep duration can be overestimated due to erroneous classification of drowsiness, rest periods, or torpor as sleep (see [13]) or underestimated (through the inability to detect sleep in animals lacking traditional behavioral manifestations of sleep [14]). In 2008, Rattenborg et\u00a0al. pioneered the use of wireless neurophysiological devices to quantify sleep in wild animals, in their natural habitat [15], bringing about a new era in sleep research. Novel wireless techniques permitting EEG/ electromyographic (EMG) recordings in complex laboratory, semi-natural [16], or wild environments have since been used to describe sleep diversity and plasticity and examine the influence of ecological demands on the timing and duration of sleep. Nevertheless, these techniques have mainly been utilized in avian species (also see [15, 17, 18]).\nIn this issue of SLEEP, two new studies utilizing wireless EEG/ EMG and video recordings provide the first characterization of sleep in the dusky antechinus (Antechinus swainsonii, a small marsupial), which was monitored in a complex laboratory environment [19], and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), which was monitored in an outdoor enclosure [20]. Dusky antechinus males were housed in laboratory enclosures containing various components of their natural environment, including natural debris, dry eucalyptus leaves, thick tree branches, and bark. Live prey was also introduced to enable the animals to engage in their natural predatory behavior. The dusky antechinus exhibited both NREM and REM sleep yet did not show a circadian organization in its sleep cycle. Notably, the animals were found to display some sleep features similar to those displayed by typical mammalian models, as well as others similar to those displayed by avian species. For example, as in most mammals, sleep deprivation was found to result in a subsequent increase in NREM sleep, providing the first evidence of sleep homeostasis in marsupials. Nonetheless, the dusky antechinus exhibited short episodes of both NREM and REM sleep resembling those of birds, with a mean duration of 34 seconds for NREM sleep and 10 seconds for REM sleep. Importantly, the breeding strategy of the dusky antechinus is known to consist of a single short and intense breeding season, after which all males die [21]. These and other findings set the stage for further investigations on how reproductive demands act upon sleep and whether sleep plasticity is related to reproductive success [22].\nThe second study examined the dromedary camel, a large desert animal that lives under harsh environmental conditions\n(including, extreme temperatures and water scarcity). Allali et\u00a0 al. focused on four female camels that were provided with ad libitum food and water in an outdoor enclosure in Morocco [19]. They found that the camels had a fragmented sleep pattern, with sleep bouts lasting approximately 5 minutes and totaling to ~1.7 hours of sleep per night. The camels spent about a third of their total sleep duration in REM sleep, yet REM sleep propensity decreased over the course of the night, in contrast to humans, rodents, and other mammals, for which REM sleep duration typically increases. As in other mammals, the camels\u2019 NREM sleep EEG signal contained k-complexes and spindles. These findings establish a foundation for further investigations on the impact of ecological factors, including food and water scarcity, on sleep in animals displaying physiological and behavioral adaptations to extreme conditions.\nIn summary, increasing diversity in animal models and studying unrestrained animals in more naturalistic settings, as in the aforementioned studies, is likely to contribute greatly to our current understanding of the evolutionary history and function of sleep, as well as provide novel opportunities to model human sleep. Insights into these processes will not only be fundamental for basic science but could also enable a better understanding of the underlying causes of sleep disturbances in\u00a0humans."
