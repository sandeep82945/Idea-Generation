INTRODUCTION\nDiscovered in 1979 by Tohru Eguchi and Andrew Hanson [1,2], and independently by Eugenio Calabi [3] the same year, the Eguchi-Hanson metric represents an interesting example of gravitational instanton [4\u201311]: It is a Ricci flat metric, and it corresponds to a noncompact, selfdual, Euclidean solution to Einstein equations in vacuum andwith vanishing cosmological constant (\u039b \u00bc 0); although an analog of the solution with nonvanishing \u039b also exists [12]. When \u039b \u00bc 0, the space is asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). More precisely, it is asymptotically R4=Z2. It admits a nonsingular case whose topology is the cotangent bundle of the 2-sphere T \u00f0S2\u00de \u00bc T \u00f0CP1\u00de, beingR \u00d7 S2 at the so-called origin (r \u00bc a in the coordinates (1)\u2013(3) below with m \u00bc 2 and \u039b \u00bc 0) and asymptotically RP3 (at r \u00bc \u221e). The projective space RP3 \u00bc S3=Z2 is isomorphic to the 3-dimensional rotation group SO\u00f03\u00de\u2243 SU\u00f02\u00de=Z2, and the isometry group of the Eguchi-Hanson space is thus given byU\u00f01\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de=Z2 \u2243U\u00f02\u00de. As it is for\nthe K3 Calabi-Yau space, the reduced holonomy group of Eguchi-Hanson space is SU\u00f02\u00de, and this makes it possible to approximate the former space by combinations of copies of the latter. This is related to the fact that Eguchi-Hanson may be regarded as the resolution of the A1 singularity, according to the ADE classification. In fact, EguchiHanson has interesting applications in string theory in relation to the resolutions of orbifold singularities. It also has other interesting applications, such as serving as a seed for constructing higher-dimensional spaces with special holonomy [13\u201319]. Multicenter, asymptotically R4=Zk generalization of the Eguchi-Hanson instanton can also be constructed [6]. In this paper, we are interested in studying the higherdimensional extension of the Eguchi-Hanson space, given by the metric (1)\u2013(3) below. Considering the higherdimensional generalization of Einstein spaces, however, makes it natural to consider, in addition to the Einstein tensor, higher-curvature contributions yielding secondorder, covariantly conserved, rank-2 tensors in the field equations, cf. [20]. Such contributions do not exist in 4 dimensions [21] but are certainly possible in dimension 5 and higher [22]. Here, we will take them into account. Higher-dimensional, higher-curvature gravitational instantons have been studied before; see for instance [23\u201327] and references therein and thereof. Here, we will explicitly construct generalizations of Eguchi-Hanson space in arbitrary even dimension D and with quadratic curvature contributions. We will also consider examples with cubic curvature corrections. *crcorral@unap.cl \u2020daniel.flores@cinvestav.mx \u2021gaston.giribet@nyu.edu \u00a7juoliva@udec.cl Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

II, we will study the higher-dimensional analog of the Eguchi-Hanson space with cosmological constant. In Sec. III, we will introduce the higher-curvature terms we will consider. In Sec. IV, we will present a six-dimensional version of the Eguchi-Hanson space, including the higher-curvature modification. We will discuss different version of the solution, exhibiting diverse topologies in the base manifold. In Sec. V, wewill discuss the topological invariants and the regularized on-shell action associated to the six-dimensional solution. The D-dimensional solution will be presented in Sec. VI, where, in addition to the quadratic corrections; we will also consider cubic terms in the Riemann tensor in Sec. VII."

Inhomogeneous Einstein metrics were constructed as the nontrivial fibration over arbitrary K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds in Ref. [8] (see also [28]) in even higher dimensions D \u00bc 2m with m \u2208 Z. A particular case is the higherdimensional generalization of the Eguchi-Hanson metric [2], whose line element is given by\nds2 \u00bc r 2 4 f\u00f0r\u00de\u00f0d\u03c4 \u00fe B\u00de2 \u00fe dr 2 f\u00f0r\u00de \u00fe r2 4 d\u03a32; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere B \u00bc B\u03bcdx\u03bc denotes the K\u00e4hler potential 1-form such that \u03a9 \u00bc dB defines the symplectic real form associated to the (2m \u2212 2)-dimensional K\u00e4hler base manifold with line element d\u03a32. In four dimensions, when the base manifold is S2, the metric (1) can be written in terms of the leftinvariant Maurer-Cartan forms of SU\u00f02\u00de. In that case, the isometry group is U\u00f01\u00de \u00d7 SU\u00f02\u00de=Z2 and this solution is usually referred to as the gravitational analog of the Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin instanton in YangMills theory [29]. For concreteness, let us consider that the base space is the complex projective space CPk, with k \u00bc m \u2212 1. Then, the metric (1) is a solution of the 2m-dimensional Einstein field equations with cosmological constant,\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 1\n2 g\u03bc\u03bdR\u00fe \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc 0; \u00f02\u00de\nprovided that the metric function f\u00f0r\u00de is given by\nf\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc 2 m 1 \u2212 a r 2m \u2212\n1\n2\u00f0m2 \u2212 1\u00de\u039br 2; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere a is an integration constant. This metric is completely regular provided the parameters are chosen in such a way that there is no conical singularity at the bolt; the latter being defined as the (2m \u2212 2)-dimensional set of fixed\npoints located at the locus f\u00f0rb\u00de \u00bc 0. Since the metric is positive definite in Euclidean signature, the range of the radial coordinate is r \u2208 R\u2265jrbj. The regularity condition can be achieved by demanding periodicity on the \u03c4 coordinate, namely \u03c4 \u223c \u03c4 \u00fe \u03b2\u03c4, with \u03b2\u03c4 defined through\n\u03b2\u03c4 \u00bc 8\u03c0\nrbf0jr\u00bcrb ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate r. In four dimensions (m \u00bc 2) with a base manifold of S2 topology, themetric (1) is endowed with aMisner string [30] along the z-axis as noticed in Ref. [31]. However, its position can bemade unobservable by demanding extra conditions on the periodicity of \u03c4 [30]. For instance, the topology at r \u00bc constant hypersurfaces becomes S3=Zn if 0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 4\u03c0=n. Thus, the absence of conical singularities alongside the unobservability of the Misner string demands [12]\n8\u03c0 rbf0jr\u00bcrb \u00bc 4\u03c0 n \u2192 rb \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u2212 2\u00f0n \u2212 2\u00de\n\u039b\nr : \u00f05\u00de\nThe case with \u039b \u00bc 0 leads to the original Eguchi-Hanson metric where \u03b2\u03c4 \u00bc 2\u03c0 and r \u2265 a, representing a space with S3=Z2 topology. However, depending on whether the cosmological constant is positive or negative, different topologies can be obtained. As shown in Ref. [32], the value of rb in Eq. (5) is modified in non-Einstein spaces with negative constant scalar curvature. Indeed, this is also the case in presence of higher-curvature corrections as we study here. In four dimensions, this metric is globally (anti-)selfdual in absence of the cosmological constant (\u039b \u00bc 0). In that case, \u03b2\u03c4 \u00bc 2\u03c0 and the action and topological invariants were obtained in Refs. [1,2]. Specifically, its Eucliden onshell action vanishes, its Euler characteristic is \u03c7 \u00bc 2, and its Hirzebruch signature is \u03c4 \u00bc \u22121. This implies that there exists only one anti-self-dual 2-form with the AtiyahPatodi-Singer boundary conditions [33\u201335]. Moreover, since the index of the Dirac operator vanishes, there is no axial asymmetry whatsoever between left and righthanded Dirac spinors. Nevertheless, there is an excess of two negative-chiralty spin 3=2 spinors as it can be seen from the index of Rarita-Schinger operator [1,2]. The Euclidean Taub-NUT metrics [4,7] and the EguchiHanson metric have similar off-diagonal components; they signal nontrivial circle bundles. Moreover, the Taub-bolt and Eguchi-Hanson spaces have the same type of degenerate submanifolds (bolts), although their global structures are different. Additionally, the self-dual Taub-NUT metric is hyper-K\u00e4hler, while that of Eguchi-Hanson is K\u00e4hler. In the presence of a negative cosmological constant, these two spaces differ in their asymptotic behavior: while the Taub-NUT metric is asymptotically locally hyperbolic, the\n084055-2\nEguchi-Hanson metric is not [32]. These features represent the main differences between Taub-NUT and EguchiHanson spaces. In the following, we study how the higher-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson instanton is modified by the presence of higher-curvature corrections. In particular, we focus on terms of the Lovelock\u2019s series such that the field equations remain of second order."

Since we are interested in nontrivial fibrations of K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds, we shall focus on even-dimensional manifolds henceforth.1\nThe so-called Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory can be obtained by truncating the Lovelock series to second order in p. Nevertheless, we will also keep the highest-order term in the Lovelock series [22] which corresponds to the 2mdimensional Euler density [37]; namely, L\u00f0m\u00de \u00bc E2m (see Eq. (21) below). Being a topological invariant, the addition of the latter to the action does not modify the bulk\ndynamics, but it plays a crucial role in renormalizing the Euclidean on-shell action as well as in the computation of conserved charges in asymptotically locally AdS (AlAdS) spaces, providing a bulk counterterm once its corresponding coefficient is fixed [38\u201343]. Moreover, in four dimensions, when evaluated in configurations with (anti-)self-dual Weyl tensor, the topologically renormalized action yields an Euclidean on-shell action that is proportional to the Pontryagin index [27,44], similarly as it happens for instantons in Yang-Mills theory. For nonconformally flat boundaries, additional counterterms based on the conformal completion of Einstein-AdS gravity may also be needed in order to render the Euclidean on-shell action and conserved charges finite [45\u201347]. Adding the Pontryagin density into the four-dimensional action with fixed coupling is also an interesting possibility, since it sets any the (anti-)self-dual configurations as the ground state of the theory [48,49].

For conformally flat boundaries, the renormalized Euclidean on-shell action can be obtained by appropriately fixing the coupling constant \u03b6 of the six-dimensional Euler density [cf. Eq. (9)]. The latter plays the role of topological counterterms in evendimensional AlAdS solutions. Although the EguchiHanson solution in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is not AlAdS, there is still a nontrivial value of the Euler density coupling that yields a finite result; this corresponds to \u03b6\u039b2 \u00bc 1=9 in Eq.

On the other hand, when \u03c3 \u00bc 1, the boundary is not conformally flat; nevertheless, the radial coordinate is naturally bounded according to (19), and so there is no need to include neither topological counterterms nor conformal completion to render the action finite.

In the case of AlAdS spaces, the Euclidean path integral approach permits to explore the thermodynamics; for instance, it enables to study the wellknown phase transitions that black holes develop in that sector at certain critical temperature [57]. A similar behavior may be found for solutions whose Euclidean version corresponds to AlAdS gravitational instantons [58,59]. Thermodynamics and phase transitions of AlAdS solutions have also been studied in Lovelock theory, for instance in [60\u201368]. In the case of Eguchi-Hanson solutions, being intrinsically Euclidean and not AlAdS, the interpretation of the path integral results would be different. However, it would still be interesting to study whether any sort of phase transitions occurs in this sector. Instantons can contribute to the vacuum persistence amplitude in gauge theory [69], and a similar computation can be performed in the case of gravitational instantons, cf. [70]. In the latter work, the authors provided a general formula for the oneloop determinant in terms of the renormalization group invariant masses, the volume of space, and topological\n084055-5\ninvariants, by performing linear perturbations around the instantonic background. We believe these are interesting applications that can be studied using the analytic solutions found here. In the next section, we generalize the Eguchi-Hanson instanton of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to arbitrary even dimensions. Moreover, we show how the solution is modified in presence of cubic curvature terms in the Lovelock series."

            "text": "Let us extend our solution to higher dimension. The general even-dimensional case, say D \u00bc 2m with m \u2265 3,\ncan be solved analytically by considering different topologies of the base manifold. This was done in Sec. IV for six dimensions as a particular case, and here we consider the metric Ansatz (1) with base manifold of topology CPk, CHk, \u00f0T 2\u00dek, \u00f0S2\u00dek, and \u00f0H2\u00dek; the last three are the product of k \u00bc m \u2212 1 constant curvature 2-manifolds. Compact base manifolds with negative constant curvature can also be considered, for example, by taking spaces locally equivalent to \u00f0H2\u00dek constructed out of quotients of the hyperbolic space by discrete subgroups. The K\u00e4hler potential and line element for each of these (2m \u2212 2)-dimensional base manifolds is given below.

(14). In particular, for the topologies considered in this section, their values are\nCPk CHk \u00f0T2\u00dek \u00f0S2\u00dek \u00f0H2\u00dek \u03b3 1 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 \u03c3 0 0 0 1 1\n\u00f026\u00de\nK\u00e4hler spaces naturally allow for circle fiber bundles to be constructed on them. This is relevant for the construction of the higher-dimensional versions of the Eguchi-Hanson space discussed here. K\u00e4hler manifolds are described by a Riemannian metric with associated line element d\u03a32 and a compatible symplectic closed 2-form \u03a9. It is convenient to parameterize the symplectic form by a potential 1-form B defined by \u03a9 \u00bc dB. For our purposes, we require the K\u00e4hler base manifolds to be, in addition, Einstein spaces. In two dimensions all spaces trivially fulfill these conditions; in higher dimensions, however, this is actually a stringent constraint. One way of constructing higher-dimensional K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds in arbitrary even dimension 2k is as the direct product of k 2-dimensional spaces of equal curvature. For example, the product spaces \u00f0T2\u00dek, \u00f0S2\u00dek and \u00f0H2\u00dek meet these requirements whenever their geometries are of the form detailed in the following Table:\nSpace Bi d\u03a32i \u03b8i range \u03d5i range \u00f0T 2\u00dek \u03b8id\u03d5i d\u03b82i \u00fe d\u03d52i \u00bd0; \u03b2\u03b8i \u00bd0; \u03b2\u03d5i \u00f0S2\u00dek cos \u03b8id\u03d5i d\u03b82i \u00fe sin2\u03b8id\u03d52i \u00bd0; \u03c0 \u00bd0; 2\u03c0 \u00f0H2\u00dek cosh \u03b8id\u03d5i d\u03b82i \u00fe sinh2 \u03b8id\u03d52i \u00f0\u2212\u221e;\u221e\u00de \u00bd0; 2\u03c0\nThis Table shows a list of K\u00e4hler-Einstein spaces with symplectic potential B \u00bcPki\u00bc1 Bi and a compatible Riemannian metric d\u03a32 \u00bcPki\u00bc1 d\u03a32i . For k > 1, evendimensional hyperspheres are Einstein spaces but not K\u00e4hler manifolds. In contrast, complex projective spaces CPk are K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds for arbitrary k when they are equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. Complex hyperbolic spaces with the Bergman metric also fulfill the geometric desiderata for our construction. Part of our calculations is benefited from considering the iterative construction of complex projective spaces [71]. In this case, both the metric and the potential are written recursively; namely\nB\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc \u00f0k\u00fe 1\u00desin2\u03c8k d\u03d5k \u00fe\n1 k B\u00f0k\u22121\u00de ; \u00f027a\u00de\nd\u03a32\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc 2\u00f0k\u00fe 1\u00de d\u03c82k \u00fe sin2 \u03c8kcos2 \u03c8k d\u03d5k \u00fe\n1 k B\u00f0k\u22121\u00de\n2\n\u00fe 1 2k sin2 \u03c8kd\u03a32\u00f0k\u22121\u00de ; \u00f027b\u00de\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03c8k \u2264 \u03c0=2 and 0 \u2264 \u03d5k \u2264 2\u03c0. The base case (k \u00bc 1) is provided by the sphere. The iterative formulas above take advantage of the fact that CPk admits a foliation by S2k\u22121, modulo two points. The complex hyperbolic space CHk admits a similar slicing; namely,\nB \u00bc \u00f0k\u00fe 1\u00desinh2 \u03c8k d\u03d5k \u00fe\n1 k B\u00f0k\u22121\u00de ; \u00f028a\u00de\n084055-6\nd\u03a32 \u00bc 2\u00f0k\u00fe 1\u00de d\u03c82k \u00fe sinh2 \u03c8k cosh2 \u03c8k d\u03d5k \u00fe\n1 k B\u00f0k\u22121\u00de\n2\n\u00fe 1 2k sinh2 \u03c8kd\u03a32\u00f0k\u22121\u00de ; \u00f028b\u00de\nwhere \u2212\u221e < \u03c8k < \u221e but all else is as in Eq. (27). As in the lower-dimensional examples, the bolt of the 2m-dimensional solution we are constructing is defined as the (2m \u2212 2)-dimensional set of fixed points, located at the locus f \u00f0rb\u00de \u00bc 0. This condition, alongside the absence of conical singularities, leads to a space that is geodesically complete. The branch f\u2212\u00f0r\u00de is continuously connected to the Einstein solution in arbitrary even dimensions [cf. Eq. (3)] in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0. Additionally, defining \u0394\u2261 \u00f0m2 \u2212 1\u00de\u00bd8\u039b\u03b1m\u00f0m \u2212 2\u00de \u00fem2 \u2212 1 , we find that the asymptotic behavior of this metric is given by\nf\u00f0r\u00de \u2243\nh 1\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u0394 \u00f0m2\u22121\u00de2 q i r2\n8\u03b1m\u00f0m \u2212 2\u00de \u00fe 2\u03b3 m \u2213 16\u03b1\u03c3m\u00f0m\u00fe 1\u00de\u00f0m \u2212 2\u00de ffiffiffiffi\u0394p r2\n\u2213 1024\u03b1 3\u03c32m3\u00f0m\u00fe 1\u00de2 \u00f0m \u2212 2\u00de ffiffiffiffi\u0394p r6 \u00feO\u00f0r\u221210\u00de;\nas r \u2192 \u221e.

However, in spite of these parallels Eq. (31) is quite different from those found for Taub-NUT, see Ref. [26].\nFurthermore, Eq. (31) is a polynomial equation that can be solved explicitly; however, its generic solution is cumbersome and not particularly illuminating. In order to have a clearer picture of the cubic solution, let us consider a particular case that enables us to visualize the form of the metric: Consider \u03b13 \u00bc 8\u03b122=9, for which we find\nf\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc r 2\n32\u03b12 \u2212\nr2\n32\u03b12\n1\u00fe 16\u03b12\u039b 5 \u00fe 96\u03b12a 8 r10 1 3 : \u00f032\u00de\nThis is an exact 8-dimensional solution of the cubic theory that behaves as the solutionof 8-dimensional Einstein gravity in the small \u03b12 limit; namely f\u00f0r\u00de \u2243 \u2212 \u039br230 \u2212 a 8\nr8 \u00feO\u00f0\u03b12\u00de.

This is a concrete example of exact, analytic solution of the cubic Lovelock theory that asymptotically approaches a higher-dimensional generalization of Eguchi-Hanson space in presence of cosmological constant. Further examples can easily be obtained by following the method we described in this paper, i.e., by solving a polynomial of degree n, analogous to (31), when the\n084055-7\n2m-dimensional extension of the n-dimensional Euler characteristics of orderO\u00f0Rn\u00de, with n \u2264 m \u2212 1, are added to the gravity action."
