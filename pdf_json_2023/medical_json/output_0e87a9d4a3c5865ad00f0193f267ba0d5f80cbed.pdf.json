            "text": "In the elderly population, cognitive disorders are very common, which poses a serious challenge to the basic activities of daily life (1). Many factors are related to cognitive function, including education, nutrition, healthcare, lifestyle, mood and sleep (2\u2013 4). Sleep disorders are also common conditions in the elderly, characterized by extreme sleep durations, sleep fragmentation, and circadian rhythm disorganization, which may have harmful effects on cognitive function (3, 5\u20138). Most sleep disorders can be modified and cured (9, 10). Identifying these sleep disorders may provide a chance to prevent cognitive deterioration (2). Previous studies indicate that insufficient sleep might be a predictor of cognitive disorders, such as sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation, insomnia, as well as short sleep duration (11\u201314). Recently, mounting evidence linked excessive sleep with cognitive disorders, such as long sleep duration (\u2265 10 hours/day) (15\u201318). Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is characterized by frequent napping during the day, which is another clinical phenotype of excessive sleep (19).\nThe question that whether EDS is related to cognitive disorders has aroused great interest. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have gradually begun to be carried out, but the number of studies remains small. Several cross-sectional studies have reported EDS was associated with cognitive disorders among communitydwelling elderly people (20\u201323). A study followed 2007 elderly individuals with normal cognition for 10 years and found that EDS increased the risk of cognitive decline (24). Three other studies reached similar conclusions in American population after 3.2\u201310 years of follow-up (25\u201327). In addition, several prospective cohort studies have pointed out that EDS or daytime napping was associated with an increased risk of dementia (28\u2013 31).\nOverall, the available studies indicated that perhaps EDS relates to poor cognitive performance. Nevertheless, patients with EDS reported excessive sleep propensity in different specific situations (32). Dozing in passive situations is generally appropriate while dozing in active situations is usually inappropriate (33). For example, dozing in passive situations may result from a voluntary unopposed sleep drive, when sleep is more welcome than unwanted (e.g., lying down to rest or watching TV). In contrast, dozing in active situations (e.g., conversations) may reflect greater severity and indicate a sleep drive that overwhelms even a strong drive to stay awake. Therefore, individuals who dozed off in the active situations had higher levels of sleepiness than those who dozed off in the passive situations. Namely, perhaps active situations-related EDS are more pathologically significant. Previous studies showed that EDS is associated with poor cognitive performance (20\u201323, 34). However, few studies classified the severity of EDS based\non sleepiness situations and considered the relationship between different levels of EDS and cognitive performance.\nIn addition, excessive sleep may be predicted by weaker social networks (35). A recent cohort study highlighted that healthy lifestyle including active social contact may be associated with slower memory decline in older adults (36). Will the association between EDS and cognitive performance be altered when a healthy lifestyle is considered? Such question remains unanswered.\nTherefore, this study aimed to explore the association between EDS in passive and active situations and general cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults. The association was further examined when the healthy lifestyle was considered. We hypothesized that EDS was independently associated with poorer cognitive performance of older adults."

Active situations included situations 3, 4, and 7. We calculated the total CESS scores of passive and active situations, respectively. And we used a cutoff point of 4/5 to indicate EDS.

Participants with a total CESS score \u2265 5 only in passive situations were passive situation-related EDS (PSR-EDS) group (n = 29); participants with a total CESS score \u2265 5 only in active situations were active situation-related EDS (ASR-EDS) group (n = 8). Participants with total CESS scores \u2265 5 in both passive and active situations were classified in the high sleep propensity (HSP) group (n = 21).

The association between high daytime sleepiness propensity and the risk of poor cognitive performance remained significant after adjusting for healthy lifestyle metrics, while the association of passive situation-related excessive daytime sleepiness was marginal.\nIndividuals were more likely to doze off in passive situations. Napping in passive situations is relatively normal. Therefore, PSREDS belongs to the mild subtype.

Besides, social engagement may be an important factor in moderating the association between PSR-EDS and poor cognitive performance. Those who are reluctant to participate in social activities and choose to lie down and sleep during the day are more likely to report PSR-EDS. Gooneratne et al. (45) found that EDS among older adults was associated with functional impairments in a broad range of activities, which involve housework, sports, activity all day, and keeping pace with others. Lee et al. (46) also reported that old men with EDS had a low index of social engagement. And poor social engagement increased the risk of cognitive decline in elderly individuals (47).\nIndividuals with HSP tend to doze in both passive and active situations. Napping in active situations often means that they can not stay awake under a high level of stimulation, which may reflect greater severity of sleepiness (32, 33, 48). In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease, greater severity of sleepiness was correlated with cognitive deterioration (30, 49). We had similar findings. Compared with older adults without EDS, those with HSP were not only associated with a greater risk of general cognitive difficulties but also had poorer language performance. Compared with PSR-EDS, the uncontrollable sleep tendency of HSP in active situations is more likely to reflect the awakening system dysfunction, which may explain why older adults with HSP had poorer cognitive performance. Research has shown that the functional integrity of the awakening system may be a prerequisite for performing complex cognitive tasks. The awakening system may promote rapid linking between separated cortical regions and have an association with age-related cognitive differences (50, 51). Some of its brain regions also played a key role in emotional and cognitive function (52, 53). We found that healthy lifestyle may be a protective factor for good cognitive performance. Previous studies have also shown that healthy lifestyle is associated with slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of dementia, even in the presence of the APOE \u03b54 allele (36, 44, 54). However, after controlling for healthy lifestyle metrics, the association between HSP and the risk of poor cognitive performance remained significant. This finding again supported that HSP belongs to the severe subtype of EDS and it\u2019s probably a potential preclinical sign of dementia. Another explanation is that older adults with HSP who dozed frequently in any situation could lack cognitive stimulation. The available studies showed that cognitive stimulation involving group or intellectually challenging activities and social interaction produced benefits on cognition among older adults (55\u201357). Conversely,\nEDS, excessive daytime sleepiness; PSR-EDS, passive situation-related EDS; HSP, high sleep propensity. Model 2: adjusted for age, sex, and education. Model 3: adjusted for age, sex, education, and other chronic organic diseases. Model 4: adjusted for age, sex, education, and Chinese healthy lifestyle metrics.\nit is possible that lacking cognitive stimulation leads to poor cognitive performance.\nOverall, we found that EDS was associated with poor cognitive performance. Besides, studies showed that EDS is closely associated with adverse health outcomes and a high incidence of accidents (34, 58\u201360). EDS not only increases the risk and mortality of metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, stroke, and other physical diseases (61\u201366). Moreover, it is closely related to many neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson\u2019s syndrome, and dementia (67, 68). EDS is not a negligible issue that threatens the health of older adults. However, few studies have reported the effective management or intervention of EDS in non-dementia elderly people. We thought it is possible to reduce the attack frequency of EDS by increasing daytime activities such as active social contact, physical exercise, and intellectual activity. Certainly, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by future studies.\nThis study has some limitations. First, our measures of EDS in passive and active situations were based mainly on self-reports. It is a more objective and accurate way for evaluating EDS in specific situations to use actigraphy to measure the duration of daytime napping and sleep diaries to record daytime activity. However, this method is complex and difficult to be applied in the community. Second, small sample size and convenience sampling, in particular the small sample size of PSR-EDS and HSP groups. A larger sample of subjects recruited across a broad range of settings is required in future investigations. Third, our assessment of biological metrics was based on self-reported history of diseases. And the evaluation of social contact was relatively single and did not involve social activities such as traveling and chatting online. Fourth, other conditions that might affect EDS, e.g., sleep-related\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nbreathing problems, may have not been investigated fully. These should be further examined in future studies."
