To date, numerous medicinal plants, such as Cornus officinalis,32\u201335 Sea Buckthorn,36 Mentha,37\u201339 and Jujube40 have been utilized to synthesize bioactive AgNPs.\nSafflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a member of the family Compositae or Asteraceae, whose medicinal properties have been known since ancient times and have been used for centuries.41,42 In China, the owers of safflower are widely used in Chinese herbal preparations due to their antioxidant, antiinammatory and antimicrobial properties, and they contain vitamins A and E, polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, and other biologically active substances in large quantities.43\u201346 The progression of some diseases like myopia (especially in children), trachoma, senile cataracts, symptoms of depression, cardiovascular disease and skin tumors have been successfully retarded by safflower or its mixtures with other herbs.47,48On the basis of its ingredients and medicinal effects, safflower has been used to fabricate bioactive AgNPs. For example, Kap Duk Lee and his coworker reported a green method for synthesizing AgNPs by using safflower ower extract.49 The biosynthesized AgNPs showed inhibition effects against E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis, C. albicans and B. cerevisiae in both liquid and solid media. They also displayed signicant cytotoxic effects on a human oral cancer cell line within the concentration range of 0.2 to 1.0 mM. Then, S. Najmeh Aboutorabi and his coworkers also biosynthesized AgNPs using safflower ower extract and evaluated the effects of process parameters, such as reaction\nScheme 1 Schematic representation of green synthesis, characterizatio\n36116 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 36115\u201336125\ntime, temperature and extract solution concentration, on the properties of biosynthesized AgNPs and the antibacterial activity on applied wool fabric.50 It is clear that the safflower ower could serve as a promising green resource to fabricate bioactive AgNPs.\nTo further exploit this sustainable resource, Jose\u0301 Agust\u0301\u0131n Tapia-Herna\u0301ndez and his coworkers were recently concerned about safflower waste,51 also called the non-medicinal parts, which accounted for about 80% of the plant. Their study aimed to biosynthesize AgNPs using an extract of mixed safflower leaf and stem, where the antibacterial activities of the AgNPs on S. aureus and P. uorescens were disclosed with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 1.9 and 7.8 mg mL\u22121, respectively. One can well perceive that using the non-medicinal parts of safflower is a good choice for fabricating bioactive AgNPs. However, we noticed that in the pioneering study of Jose\u0301 Agust\u0301\u0131n Tapia-Herna\u0301ndez and his coworkers, the AgNPs were generated aer adding AgNO3 solution and allowing it to stand for 12 h in the dark.51 The relatively long reaction time and the strict reaction conditions may limit the application of this sustainable method. Otherwise, the mixture of leaf and stem was used as a green resource, but the ratio of these two parts was undened, which has signicant implications for the reproducibility of this green method. It is obvious that the efficiency of this reduction reaction should be improved and this pioneering method should be optimized.\nApart from safflower leaf and stem (SS), safflower bud (SB) is also a non-medicinal part and is always discarded in large quantities when preparing Chinese herbal medicines. It is anticipated that safflower bud could be regarded as a potential green resource for fabricating bioactive AgNPs.\nIn this study, pure SB and SS were selected as green resources for the sustainable biosynthesis of AgNPs with antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities (Scheme 1). For the purpose of improving the efficiency of the reduction reaction, it was carried out with the assistance of ultrasonication and the\nn, and biological activities of SS and SB mediated AgNPs.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The reduction reactions were monitored over time by visual observation and UV-vis spectroscopy accompanied by an evaluation of physicochemical properties like hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity, zeta potential and stability under different process parameters. For biological applications, two kinds of AgNPs, named SS-AgNPs and SB-AgNPs, were biosynthesized aer taking the effects of process parameters into full consideration. The morphology, crystalline nature and actual diameter of these two kinds of AgNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Assays of radical scavenging were performed to disclose the antioxidant activity of both kinds of AgNPs. E. coli and S. aureus were applied as sensitive bacteria to evaluate the antibacterial properties via bacterial growth kinetic andminimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analyses, where uorescence staining experiments were used to illustrate the sterilization mechanism. The anticancer potentials of SS and SB mediated AgNPs against various human cancer cell lines were assessed thoroughly with an MTT assay. These results reveal that the assistance of ultrasonication and adjusting the process parameters are efficient methods for promoting the reduction reaction and both SS-AgNPs and SBAgNPs could be treated as potential candidates for antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer drugs."

            "text": "Initially, the source extracts of both safflower stem (SS, 5.0 mL) and bud (SB, 5.0 mL) were used as green sources for reducing silver ions (Ag+, 5.0 mL) to Ag0 with the assistance of ultrasonication. The successful synthesis of AgNPs was evidenced by a visual change in the color of the solution from faint yellow to brown within 3.0 h due to excitation of surface plasmon vibrations in AgNPs. The time of the color change was dramatically reduced in comparison with the previous study by using a mixture of safflower leaf and stem as the source extract,51 indicating an accelerated reduction reaction under ultrasonic radiation. UV-vis spectroscopy, which is a well-established method to conrm the formation of AgNPs,27 was used to analytically prove the reduced Ag0 present in the SS and SB aqueous extract by observing the appearance of a surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) band in the range 400\u2013500 nm. The absorption spectra of both SS and SB extracts alone showed no obvious peaks above 400 nm. Aer the reaction of SS with Ag+, a new weak peak appeared in the interval of 400\u2013500 nm attributable to AgNPs (SS-AgNPs, Fig. 1A). However, only a slight increase in absorbance in this interval was observed for the SB extract, which may be attributed to the very small amount of AgNPs in solution (SB-AgNPs, Fig. 1D). This result essentially\n36118 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 36115\u201336125\nagrees with visual observation of the color and indicates that the source extracts of both SS and SB are capable of reducing Ag+ to Ag0 but only with weak reduction. This is also consistent with a previous study reported by Jose\u0301 Agust\u0301\u0131n Tapia-Herna\u0301ndez that AgNPs could be generated using a mixture of safflower leaf and stem aer 12 h of incubation in the dark.51\nTo enhance the reducibility, the pH of both extracts was gradually adjusted from 4.0/5.0 to 10.0 and comparative experiments were performed at different pH. As shown in Fig. 1A, the absorption band of SS-AgNPs around 430 nm slightly decreased with increasing pH up to 7.0 and then greatly increased, where the maximum absorption was observed at pH 10.0. However, for SB-AgNPs, a continuously increasing absorption around 410 nm was observed (Fig. 1D). The increased absorption suggests the formation of more AgNPs and accelerated reduction. Peak locations of the plasmon absorption of AgNPs are affected by the size of the nanoparticles, with a shi to longer wavelength with increasing particle size. This indicates that the size of the generated SB-AgNPs is smaller than that of SS-AgNPs. Otherwise, on the basis of Mie's theory, spherical nanoparticles could give rise to only a single SPR band, whereas, according to the shape of the particles, two or more SPR bands are expected in the absorption spectra of anisotropic particles. Herein, the optical absorption spectra of both reaction mixtures displayed a single SPR band, revealing the spherical shape of the biosynthesized AgNPs, which was further conrmed by the TEM images. Since studies have documented that the AgNPs formed in more basic pH are unstable and agglomerate in the medium,53 the pH of the extract was not adjusted further.\nReports indicated that the natural active ingredients in the extract not only reduce the metal ions to nanoparticles but also cover the formed nanoparticles by acting as capping agents.25 Thus, the amounts of extract are considered to signicantly inuence the reduction of Ag+ to Ag0. In order to further accelerate the reduction, experiments were performed on different volume ratios of extract and AgNO3 at pH 10.0. Fig. 1B and E display the optical absorption spectra of both SS and SB extracts with AgNO3 aer 4.0 and 6.0 h of incubation, respectively. With small amounts of extract (1 : 20), only a weak band with a maximum absorbance around 420 nm was observed. With a gradual increase in the amount of extract to 1 : 1, the absorption of the AgNPs around 420 nm increased signicantly and reached a maximum. It is obvious that the greater the amount of extract added, the greater the number of AgNPs generated. This is consistent with previous studies. However, since both source extracts are so thick, extracts of larger concentration could not be obtained. In addition, the optical absorption spectra of these two mixtures in different material ratios also reveal the feature of a slight band shi, indicating various sizes of AgNPs.\nIncubation time is also an important factor affecting the synthesis and stability of nanoparticles.26 Fig. 1C and F display the UV-vis spectroscopy of the AgNPs aer proximity to AgNO3 with SS and SB extracts at different times, where the pH of both extracts is 10.0 and the material ratio is 1 : 1. It was found that aer incubation for up to 4.0 h, the featured SPR band of AgNPs in both extracts could be clearly observed. With the passage of\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Aer this, there were no obvious changes in the absorption associated with the AgNPs. The UV-vis spectra displayed a slight band shi within the incubation time, and the formation of AgNPs with different sizes should account for this. It is clear that the biosynthesis of AgNPs with 5.0 mL of 10 mM AgNO3 and 5.0 mL of extract at pH 10.0 would show maximum efficiency and the reduction reaction would be fully completed within 6.0 and 8.0 h for SS and SB, respectively."

Previous reports indicated that the size of nanoparticles would be signicantly inuenced by the pH of the extract, which has a negligible effect on the shape.30 Our earlier studies revealed that the average size of AgNPs is not necessarily the smallest under the conditions with maximum efficiency.32,36,52 Thus, in order to obtain AgNPs with small size, the average size was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) when the material ratio of the extract and AgNO3 was 1 : 1. DLS is an analytical method which estimates the particle diameter along with the external phytochemical coating, usually called the hydrodynamic diameter. The average sizes of the biosynthesized AgNPs at different pH aer incubation for a certain time are shown in Fig. 2A and C. It is obvious that the average size of SS-AgNPs biosynthesized at pH 6.0 is relatively smaller than for other pH values and the smallest size of SS-AgNPs could be obtained at pH 8.0 aer 6.0 h of incubation (19.7\u00b1 0.8 nm). However, this reveals that an alkaline solution could accelerate the generation of SB-AgNPs of small size.

The distribution of average size is in accord with the evolution of the above-mentioned UV-vis spectrum.\nStudies also showed that an optimum concentration of extract is necessary for the reduction and stabilization of nanoparticles.29 If the concentration is outside this level, the nanoparticles are obtained in lower amounts and with a bulkier size or they accumulate, causing defective stabilization and coarser particles. Thus, the effects of the material ratio on the average size of SS and SB mediated AgNPs were assessed at pH 10.0 aer 4.0 and 6.0 h of incubation, respectively.

The average size of SSAgNPs gradually decreased and reached a minimum when the ratio was 1 : 2. However, there was an increase in average size until the concentration of the SB extract reached 1 : 2. When the ratio was adjusted to 1 : 1, the average size dramatically decreased to 23.5 \u00b1 0.3 nm."

            "text": "Polydispersity is another important parameter for nanoparticles, which has a signicant effect on the characteristics of nanoparticles. Thus, the polydispersity index (PDI) of AgNPs biosynthesized by both SS and SB was determined. Fig. 3A and C display the PDI of AgNPs obtained when the material ratio was 1 : 1 for both extracts. They show that SS-AgNPs with the smallest and largest PDI values could be generated at pH 4.0 and 7.0, respectively. A neutral solution is disadvantageous to the generation of SS-AgNPs with superior dispersion. The smallest PDI value of SS-AgNPs is 0.22 \u00b1 0.01. However, a neutral SB extract facilitates the generation of AgNPs with superior dispersion. SB-AgNPs in neutral solution have smaller PDI values compared with those synthesized in alkaline or acidic solutions. The smallest PDI value (0.27 \u00b1 0.01) was obtained when the experiment was performed at pH 8.0 aer 8.0 h of incubation. Studies indicated that, if the sample has a PDI value lower than 0.3, it would exist in monodispersed form. Herein, the smallest PDI values of SS-AgNPs and SB-AgNPs are below this level, indicating that AgNPs with superior dispersion could be generated by both SS and SB extracts.\nThe effect of the material ratio on the PDI of the AgNPs was also evaluated when the experiment was performed at pH 10.0 aer 4.0 and 6.0 h of incubation with SS and SB, respectively. It is obvious that, with increased concentration, the PDI of SSAgNPs gradually increases. The smallest PDI (0.19 \u00b1 0.02) could be obtained when the material ratio was 1 : 20. The high concentration of SB extract (1 : 1) would form SB-AgNPs with poor dispersion, where the PDI value was 0.82 \u00b1 0.01. With\n36120 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 36115\u201336125\nother material ratios used in this study, the PDI of AgNPs is below the value of 0.3, meaning accessibility to AgNPs with superior dispersion.\n3.4 z-Potential\nz-Potential is a physicochemical property that is associated with the stability of nanoparticles and it has a signicant effect on antimicrobial activity, since electrostatic adhesion would facilitate the interaction of nanoparticles and the cell membrane.27 It is well known that particles with higher repulsive forces demonstrate robust Brownian movement with greater stability. In parallel, particles with increased attractive forces aggregate and settle down, and may fail to demonstrate biological activities. Clearly, nanoparticles with a high magnitude of z-potential are electrically stable, while nanoparticles with a lowmagnitude of z-potential tend to coagulate. Previous studies indicated that nanoparticles with z-potentials in the interval \u221225.0 to +25.0 mV may lead to the aggregation of nanoparticles deriving from interparticle attraction. However, if the z-potentials are outside of this range, the nanoparticles would show long-term stability. Therefore, the z-potential was measured to judge the surface state and the stability of the AgNPs synthesized by both extracts. Fig. 4A compares the z-potential of AgNPs synthesized by SS and SB extracts at different pH when thematerial ratio was 1 : 1 aer 5.0 and 8.0 h of incubation, respectively. Obviously, the SS-AgNPs have larger z-potential values than the SB-AgNPs, meaning greater loads on the surface of SS-AgNPs. For both SS\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

In practice, when the synthetic AgNPs were le for 30 days, the average size revealed negligible change, verifying their superior stability. Otherwise, the negative z-potential means electronegative capping agents on the surface of the AgNPs. These molecules may be avonoids, tannins, proteins, polysaccharides, steroids, fatty acids, phenolic acids, anthocyanins, or gallic acid derivatives contained in the SS and SB extracts, as conrmed by previous FTIR studies by Jose\u0301 Agust\u0301\u0131n Tapia-Herna\u0301ndez and his coworkers.51\nFig. 4B displays the z-potential of synthetic AgNPs with various concentrations of SB extract at pH 10.0 aer 8.0 h of incubation. It was anticipated that the greater the amount of extract added, the greater the load would be on the surface of the AgNPs. However, the material ratio seems to have a negligible effect on the z-potential of the synthetic AgNPs.\nIn order to obtain more AgNPs of small size for further characterization and investigations of biological activity, reduction reactions were performed at pH 10.0 and material ratio 1 : 1 for both SS and SB extracts, where the reaction mixtures were incubated for 5.0 h and 6.0 h, respectively."

Another two strong signals resulting from carbon and copper in the spectrum should relate to the carboncoated copper grid used in the TEM and EDS analysis.

The shapes of the SS-AgNPs and SB-AgNPs are both spherical, reinforced by the sharp and narrow peak of the UVvisible spectrum in Fig. 1. It is obvious that the SS-AgNPs have diameters roughly in the range of 20\u201330 nm basically in accordance with the DLS results. The diameters of the SS-AgNPs are slightly bigger than those of SB-AgNPs, which appear to be below 20 nm.

To further illustrate their crystalline structure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed and the results are displayed in Fig. 7. The typical peaks observed for both SS-AgNPs and SB-AgNPs are almost the same, indicating the same crystalline structure.

Thus, a DPPH assay was performed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of biosynthesized AgNPs, which is one of the quickest methods. DPPH is a stable free radical, and its color changes from purple to yellow when it accepts hydrogen and electrons from donors.\nThe rates of free radical scavenging were calculated aer adding twofold serial concentrations of synthetic AgNPs into DPPH solution. As shown in Fig. 8, the AgNPs capped by SS and\n36122 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 36115\u201336125\nSB reveal signicant DPPH scavenging activity, which is closely related to the concentration of synthetic AgNPs. When the concentration of AgNPs synthesized by SS was increased from 0.78 to 100 mg mL\u22121, the scavenging activities increased from 32.6% to 82.2%. Further addition of AgNPs to 400 mg mL\u22121 had only a small inuence on the radical scavenging activities (85.2%). The scavenging activity of AgNPs capped by SB is smaller than that for SS-AgNPs. The SB-AgNPs had scavenging activity of 67.7% in 50.0 mg mL\u22121. However, when the amount of AgNPs was increased to 400.0 mg mL\u22121, the scavenging activity changed slightly to 69.1%. Herein, the radical scavenging activity of AgNPs capped by SS and SB is comparable with those from previous reports55,56 indicating their potential application in the treatment of many diseases caused by oxidative stress.\n3.7 In vitro antibacterial activities\nThe growth kinetics of E. coli and S. aureus were measured for the purpose of evaluating the antibacterial activities of synthetic AgNPs. Aer treatment with twofold serial concentrations of AgNPs, the absorbance of bacteria at 600 nm was measured and is displayed in Fig. 9, exhibiting dose-dependence. Growth inhibition could obviously be observed for both pathogens, even when treated with 3.1 mg mL\u22121 AgNPs synthesized with both extracts. For SS mediated AgNPs, the minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) were found to be 25.0 and 12.5 mg mL\u22121 against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. However, when these two pathogens were incubated with SB-AgNPs, the MICs were determined to be 25.0 and 50.0 mg mL\u22121, a little bit higher than for SS mediated AgNPs. The MIC of AgNPs obtained herein is slightly different from those obtained by Jose\u0301 Agust\u0301\u0131n TapiaHernandez using wastage from safflower (S. aureus 1.9 mg mL\u22121; P. uorescens 7.8 mg mL\u22121).51 We speculate that the difference might arise from the different methods used for the assessment of antibacterial activity and the AgNPs having different physicochemical properties.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As shown in Fig. S1,\u2020 the bacterial cells without AgNPs treatment were stained by DAPI, showing blue uorescence, but not by PI, indicating that the bacterial membranes were intact. However, aer treatment with AgNPs (2*MIC), both types of bacterial cell were stained by PI, showing red uorescence, verifying that the membranes of both cells had been disrupted.\n3.8 In vitro anticancer activities\nApart from combatting infections, AgNPs are also used to deal with serious health problems such as cancer, especially multidrug resistant cancer cells.27 Herein, an MTT assay was performed to evaluate the anticancer activity of both SS and SB mediated AgNPs against human colorectal cancer SW620 and cervical cancer HeLa in vitro. As shown in Fig. 10, the incubation of these two cancer lines with SS mediated AgNPs would give rise to a decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent fashion. With the addition of 50 mg mL\u22121 SS-AgNPs, the cell viabilities of SW620 and HeLa were signicantly reduced to 11.0% and 11.6%, respectively. The AgNPs synthesized by SB also display cytotoxicity against the SW620 cell line, where the cell viability was found to be 22.2% at 50 mg mL\u22121 SB-AgNPs. Interestingly, they seem to be incapable of action against the HeLa cell line even aer treatment with 80 mg mL\u22121 SB-AgNPs.\nTo further evaluate the results of the anticancer assay, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the AgNPs is presented, which represents a quantitative measure of the drug concentration required to inhibit a certain biological process by half. By tting the dose\u2013response curve constructed above, the IC50 values of the AgNPs against cancer cell lines were determined to be 5.4 (SS-SW620), 10.6 (SB-SW620) and 26.8 mg mL\u22121 (SS-HeLa). These results demonstrated the potential anticancer activity of AgNPs against cancer cell lines with varying sensitivity.\nThe AgNPs synthesized by SS and SB extracts herein displayed high anticancer activity, comparable with AgNPs synthesized using Iranian Mentha pulegium (\u223c100 mg mL\u22121 for HeLa and MCF-7),37 Iresine herbstii (51 mg mL\u22121 for HeLa)57 and Cornus officinalis (20.68 and 69.72 mg mL\u22121 for HCT116 and HepG2, respectively),32 and Sea Buckthorn (8.77, 14.59, and 27.98\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "In the present study, AgNPs were produced by a sustainable green chemistry method with the non-medicinal parts of safflower (pure bud and stem) as potent bioreducers with the assistance of sonication. The current method of biosynthesis using safflower stem and bud is more time-efficient and resource-efficient, taking into account both the safety design and the needs of biological action and could be pursued in a wide range of contexts. By employing our established method, AgNPs with desirable particle sizes and stability characteristics could be conveniently generated by adjusting process parameters like the pH of the extract, the material ratio and incubation time. Characterization of the selectively synthesized AgNPs revealed their crystalline structure, average size, and surface loads. The antioxidant potentials of as-prepared AgNPs were disclosed by a radical scavenging experiment. An in vitro antibacterial and anticancer assay of both kinds of AgNPs demonstrated dose-dependent action in a certain concentration range against both pathogens and cancer cell strains, conrming their potent biological activity. The results of the present study provide experimental evidence that the assistance of sonication and adjusting the process parameters are efficient methods for promoting the reduction reaction, and that both SS and SB mediated AgNPs could serve as promising antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer agents.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
