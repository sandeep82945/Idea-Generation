1. **Investigate the effects of different qubit-cavity coupling strengths on the dynamical non-Markovianity (DnM) of the cavity mode.** The paper considers a specific coupling strength, but it would be interesting to see how the DnM changes as the coupling strength is varied. This could provide insights into the optimal conditions for achieving strong DnM.


2. **Explore the use of different qubit-cavity interaction Hamiltonians.** The paper considers the Tavis-Cummings model, but there are many other possible Hamiltonians that could be used to describe the interaction between the qubits and the cavity. It would be interesting to see how the DnM changes when different Hamiltonians are used.


3. **Investigate the effects of qubit-qubit interactions on the DnM of the cavity mode.** The paper considers the case of non-interacting qubits, but it would be interesting to see how the DnM changes when qubit-qubit interactions are introduced. This could provide insights into the role of entanglement in the generation of DnM.


4. **Explore the use of the tunable DnM to engineer new types of quantum devices.** The paper suggests that the tunable DnM could be used to engineer bosonic quantum memristors. It would be interesting to explore other potential applications of the tunable DnM, such as the development of quantum sensors or quantum computers.


5. **Investigate the experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme.** The paper provides a theoretical proposal for achieving tunable DnM in a cavity mode. It would be interesting to investigate the experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme. This could involve developing new experimental techniques or identifying existing platforms that could be used to implement the scheme.
