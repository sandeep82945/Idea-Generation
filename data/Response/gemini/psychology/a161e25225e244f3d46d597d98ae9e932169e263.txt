1. **Investigate the effect of different drying methods on the activity of proteins and saccharides.** This could be done by comparing the activity of proteins and saccharides dried using different methods, such as freeze-drying, spray-drying, and miniaturized drying. This would help to determine the best drying method for preserving the activity of proteins and saccharides.


2. **Study the effect of different saccharides on the stability of proteins during storage.** This could be done by storing proteins in the presence of different saccharides and then measuring their activity over time. This would help to identify saccharides that can stabilize proteins during storage and prevent them from losing their activity.


3. **Investigate the mechanism by which saccharides stabilize proteins during drying.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and spectroscopy. This would help to understand how saccharides interact with proteins and prevent them from denaturing during drying.


4. **Develop new saccharide-based formulations for the drying of proteins.** This could be done by combining different saccharides with other excipients, such as amino acids or polymers. This would help to create formulations that are more effective at preserving the activity of proteins during drying.


5. **Investigate the use of saccharides to stabilize proteins in other applications.** This could include applications such as food processing, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. This would help to expand the use of saccharides as a versatile tool for stabilizing proteins.
