    "abstractText": "The extremely small size of micro-/nanomaterials limits the application of conventional thermal measurement methods using a contact heating source or probing sensor. Therefore, noncontact thermal measurement methods are preferable in micro-/nanoscale thermal characterization. In this review, one of the non-contact thermal measurement methods, photothermal (PT) technique based on thermal radiation, is introduced. When subjected to laser heating with controllable modulation frequencies, surface thermal radiation carries fruitful information for thermal property determination. As thermal properties are closely related to the internal structure of materials, for micro-/nanomaterials, PT technique can measure not only thermal properties but also features in the micro-/nanostructure. Practical applications of PT technique in the thermal measurement of micro-/nanomaterials are then reviewed, including special wall-structure investigation in multiwall carbon nanotubes, porosity determination in nanomaterial assemblies, and the observation of amorphous/crystalline structure transformation in proteins in heat treatment. Furthermore, the limitations and future application extensions are discussed.",

            "text": "With reductions in size to the micro-/nanometer level, temperature probing and thermal measurement have become difficult to conduct using traditional contact-based methods and equipment (thermal couples and thermistor, etc.). Non-contact thermal measurement methods have thus become prevalent for the thermal characterization of micro-/nanomaterials [1,2]. Non-contact methods mainly benefit from the laser heating source and thermally induced phenomena, which can be detected from a distance [3\u201311]. Based on the features of the phenomena, the widely adopted non-contact thermal methods are typically divided into three types: time-domain techniques, frequency-domain techniques, and spectroscopy [1]. Among these techniques, time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) [7,12,13] and frequencydomain thermoreflectance (FDTR) [14,15] detect the temperature rise by sensing changes in the surface optical properties in the time and frequency domains. They utilize an ultrafast heating pulse to generate a nanometer-level thermal penetration depth and thus have a good ability to measure the in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity for thin films and bulks. The obvious drawbacks of these two methods are that they require smooth surfaces and post-processing. The photoacoustic (PA) method is a frequency-domain method that measures the surface temperature by detecting the sound waves produced by the work done by the periodical thermal expansion of the heated surface [3]. Avoiding the mechanical piston effect induced by the thermal expansion of the heated surface, the modulation frequency of the heating laser is limited so that it is lower than the order of\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1884. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12111884 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1884 2 of 11\n10 kHz [9,11,16]. The PA method can work well with micrometer-thick films and bulks due to the long thermal penetration depth at a lower frequency [9]. Furthermore, as it is limited by the microphone, the PA method is usually deployed at room temperature [3,9,11]. The laser flash method [17,18] involves heating a suspended material on the front side and analyzing the transient temperature rise in the time domain from the back based on the thermal radiation. Compared with the PA method, the laser flash method can be used with a wide temperature range from \u2212125 to 2800 \u25e6C [1]. However, this method has thickness limitations with regard to samples [19,20]. More recently, Raman-based thermal methods have become popular due to its feature of being material-specific. The steady-state Raman method has a simple physical mechanism for thermal characterization [21,22], while the transient Raman method offers high accuracy in measurement results [8,23\u201331]. It is notable that the temperature probing depth with the Raman method is usually tens of nanometers. It is less often used to measure the thermal properties of thick films or bulks. More comprehensive reviews of general photothermal technologies can be found in [1,2]. In this paper, a short review is provided for the photothermal (PT) technique based on thermal radiation established in Wang\u2019s lab [32,33]. This PT technique stems from PA technology. However, in contrast to PA technology, PT technique acquires the frequencydomain thermal radiation instead of sound waves, which can reduce the complexity of the measurement setup and widen the temperature range for thermal measurement, as the microphone is no longer necessary. Furthermore, it has no frequency limitation and, thus, can theoretically measure samples with thicknesses ranging from nanoscale to bulk. The PT method also has a low requirement for smooth surfaces when compared to thermoreflectance methods because it detects thermal radiation rather than reflections. In Sections 2 and 3, the theory and a typical experimental setup for PT technique are introduced. Section 4 discusses the application of PT technique in the thermal characterization of micro-/nanomaterials, especially the measurement of thermophysical properties and structure probing. Furthermore, considerations for the thermal measurement of micro/nanomaterials using PT technique are also discussed."

In each period, the surface temperature immediately rises after heating is applied. The speed and intensity of the thermal response of the surface are strongly dependent on the thermal properties of the materials under the surface. Thermal radiation due to surface temperature rise carries important information regarding the thermal properties of the materials and structures beneath, both for homogeneous and multilayered structures."

Compared with the original periodical heating source, the occurrence of temperature rises and thermal radiation is delayed by the heat conduction inside the multilayered structure.

Measurement based on the phase shift\u2014the phase shift method\u2014can be used to accurately evaluate the thermal properties of a specific layer and the interfacial thermal conductance in the multilayered structure due to the high sensitivity of ~0.1\u25e6 [32].

            "text": "A typical measurement setup using the PT technique developed in Wang\u2019s lab [11] is shown in Figure 1b. The function generator-modulated diode laser (at a visible wavelength) is focused on a sample surface by using a focal lens to heat the sample. Then, a pair of offaxis parabolic mirrors collect the raised thermal radiation resulting from the temperature rise and send it to an infrared (IR) detector. Along with the radiation collection, the diffuse reflection of the incident laser from the surface is also gathered. Though the IR detector is much less sensitive to the visible wavelength, the reflection is still much stronger than the radiation. Thus, an IR window (germanium (Ge) window in Figure 1b) is placed in front of the detector to eliminate the visible diffuse reflection and let only the thermal radiation enter into the detector. The radiation-converted voltage signal is then intensified in a preamplifier and finally analyzed in a lock-in amplifier to extract the phase shift and the amplitude when compared with the reference signal from the function generator. When using PT technique, given that the unexpected, complex photon\u2013electron\u2013 phonon process may occur under laser irradiation in the sample, especially for semiconductors, a metal coating (usually gold, aluminum, etc.) is applied to the sample surface to act as a well-defined energy absorber and heater. The coating is optically thick and can totally absorb the incidence. At the same time, it is thermally thin and has a negligible effect on heat conduction (phase shift). It is physically understandable that the heat diffusion length/depth in the multilayered structure should be controllable by changing the modulating frequency. The selection of the modulating frequency of the heating laser needs to be evaluated in advance because the sample layer in the multilayered structure should be involved in the heat conduction."

For example, the optical path and electric devices involved raise an additional time delay in the phase shift, and the fluctuations in the laser power, as well as the optical path, cause unexpected variations in amplitude. Thus, calibration of the measurement system is necessary to exclude these effects from the raw data. The diffuse reflection of the incident laser is measured to calibrate the measurement system, since it passes through the same path as the thermal radiation does. The calibrated phase shift \u03c6cal and amplitude Acal are shown in Figure 2. To calibrate \u03c6raw, the absolute phase shift due to heat conduction is quickly determined as \u03c6nor = \u03c6raw \u2212 \u03c6cal. For the amplitude, it is more complicated. The amplitude is affected by not only the laser power and attenuation in the optical path but also the modulation frequency f.

Uncertainty During the data measurement, different heat conduction processes occur when the\nmodulation frequency is changed. Then, the thermal properties can be determined by fitting the temperature variation against the frequencies. Wang et al. found that the uncertainty is related to the ratio of the thermal diffusion length \u03bci to the layer thickness Li [11]. Based on their SiO2/Si sample, the numerical uncertainty for the phase shift method was around \u00b15%when \u03bci and Li were in the same order, and it increased to \u00b115% when \u03bci/Li was around 100. For the case in which \u03bci/Li was less than 0.15, the thermal energy would not diffuse across the SiO2 layer. The phase shift method would not be suitable for this case, while the amplitude method showed a \u00b110% uncertainty. Xu et al. studied a similar SiO2/Si sample and achieved an experimental uncertainty of 5% based on the phase shift method and 10% with the amplitude method [33]. For thermal contact resistance measurement, the experimental sensitivity and uncertainty were limited by the uncertainty in the thermal conductivity discussed above. The sensible limit was reported to be 10\u22128 m2K/W [11] for the phase shift method and 10\u22127 m2K/W [33] for the amplitude method. Since the thermal contact resistance fell in the range of 10\u22129\u201310\u22127 m2K/W, the amplitude method was not sensitive to the thermal contact resistance. It could thus accurately measure the thermal conductivity without knowledge of the interface.\n4.

From Equations (5)\u2013(8), it can be seen that the method determines the absolute value of thermal resistance for conductance (the sum of L/\u03ba and R) and heat capacitance (L\u03c1cp). For a certain layer i with a thin thickness Li, when its thermal resistance (Li/\u03bai) is much smaller than\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1884 9 of 11\nthe uncertainty \u2206R of R, R will dominate the variation in the PT signal and the change in Li/\u03bai will not be sensed. The minimum thickness in the PT method should thus be larger than \u2206R\u00b7\u03bai. As alternatives, the TDTR and FDTR methods employ an ultrafast pulsed laser (femtosecond to nanosecond) to realize a nanometer-level thermal penetration depth and, thus, the thermal measurement of nanometer-thick coatings [14]. Raman-based thermal methods measure temperature according to the variation in the materials\u2019 characteristic peaks in the Raman spectrum. They are available for both suspended and supported films and need no metal coating on the top of samples [24,26,30,37,38]. Another concern about the PT method is the in-plane thermal conductivity. As described in the physical model, the heating laser spot size should be larger than the in-plane thermal diffusion length in each layer so that the 1D model is valid. However, if the sample has a high in-plane thermal conductivity (such as graphene, etc.), the 1D model is violated. A direct solution is to build a 3D heat conduction model and also consider the spatial distribution of the heating laser [39,40]. For suspended samples, the evaluation of the transient term in Equation (2) in the time domain and the steady-state temperature field mapping can be used achieve in-plane thermal conductivity measurement using the current experimental setup. Moreover, other methods, such as the TDTR [41], FDTR [14], and Raman-based thermal methods [25,42,43], can achieve both kinds of in-plane thermal conductivity measurement. Furthermore, infrared thermal radiation is not material-specific. When measuring an individual nanostructure, such as a single nanoparticle, an IR detector may gather the thermal radiation from the nanoparticle and its surroundings/supporting materials. The determined thermal properties are thus averages one rather than the properties for a specific nanostructure. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy has a fingerprint feature and can respond to temperature changes and detect the temperature rise for individual micro/nanostructures [24,38,44\u201347]."
