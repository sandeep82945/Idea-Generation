Notable examples include a long-sought switch in the selectivity of the refractory sclareolide core, an override of benzylic fluorination, and a rare case of 3,30-difluorination. Furthermore, calculations illuminate a low barrier transition state for fluorination, supporting our notion that alcohols\nare engaged in coordinated reagent direction. A hydrogen bonding interaction between the innate hydroxy directing group and fluorine is also highlighted for several substrates with 19F\u20131H HOESY\nexperiments, calculations, and more.\nThe hydroxy (OH) group is treasured and versatile in chemistry and biology.1 Its ubiquity in nature and broad spectrum of chemical properties make it an attractive source as a potential directing group.2 The exploitation of the mild Lewis basicity exhibited by alcohols has afforded several elegant pathways for selective functionalization (e.g., Sharpless epoxidation,3 homogeneous hydrogenation,4 cross-coupling reactions,5 among others6). Recently, we reported a photochemically promoted carbonyl-directed aliphatic uorination, and most notably, established the key role that C\u2013H/O hydrogen bonds play in the success of the reaction.7 Our detailed mechanistic investigations prompt us to postulate that other Lewis basic functional groups (such as \u2013OH) can direct uorination in highly complementary ways.8 In this communication, we report a hydroxy-directed aliphatic uorination method that exhibits unique directing properties and greatly expands the domain of radical uorination into the less established realm governing high diastereoselectivity.9\nOur rst inclination that functional groups other than carbonyls may inuence uorination regiochemical outcomes was obtained while screening substrates for our published ketone-directed radical-based method (Scheme 1).8a In this example, we surmised that oxidation of the tertiary hydroxy group on substrate 1 cannot occur and would demonstrate functional group tolerance (directing to C11, compound 2). Surprisingly, the two major regioisomers (products 3 and 4) are\nniversity, 3400 N. Charles St., Baltimore,\nmation (ESI) available. See\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nderivatized by Selectuor (SF) on C12 and C16 \u2013 indicative of the freely rotating hydroxyl directing uorination. Without an obvious explanation of how these groups could be involved in dictating regiochemistry, we continued the mechanistic study of carbonyl-directed uorination (Scheme 2A). We established that the regioselective coordinated hydrogen atom abstraction occurs by hydrogen bonding between a strategically placed carbonyl and Selectuor radical dication (SRD).7 However, we noted that the subsequent radical uorination is not diastereoselective due to the locally planar nature of carbonyl groups. Thus, we posed the question: are there other directing groups that can provide both regio- and diastereoselectivity? Such a group would optimally be attached to a sp3 hybridized carbon; thus the \u201cthree dimensional\u201d hydroxy carbon logically comes to mind as an attractive choice, and Scheme 1 illustrates the rst positive hint.\nWe began our detailed study with a simple substrate that contains a tertiary hydroxyl group. Alcohol 5 was synthesized stereoselectively by the reaction of 3-methylcyclohexanone, FeCl3, and 4-chlorophenylmagnesium bromide;10 the 4-chlorophenyl substituent allows for an uncomplicated product identication and isolation (aromatic chromophore). We sought to determine optimal reaction conditions by examination of numerous photosensitizers, bases, solvents, and light sources (Table 1). To our satisfaction, uorination not only provides the intended regioisomer but only a single diastereomer is formed (compound 6). A photosensitizer screen shows that benzil (in MeCN solvent) generally affords the highest yield (83%).7 Although we utilize cool blue LEDs (sharp cutoff ca. 400 nm), CFLs (small amount of UVB (280\u2013315 nm)\nChem.

Control substrates, such as methylcyclohexane, afford low or no yields of product mixtures under identical conditions.\n7008 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 7007\u20137013\nThe screening concurrently buttresses our claim that hydroxy-directed uorination is proceeding through a mechanism involving a network of C\u2013H/OH hydrogen bonds.12 Other N\u2013F reagents (for example, N-uorobenzenesulfonimide and Nuoropyridinium tetrauoroborate) do not provide the desired uorinated product 6. The 1,3-diaxial relationship shown in Fig. 1 presents an intramolecular competition: tertiary vs. secondary C\u2013H abstraction (O/H\u2013C calculated distances: 2.62 and 2.70 A\u030a at B3LYP 6-311++G**, respectively). The tertiary uoride is the major product in this case.\nWith optimized conditions established, we assessed the siteselectivity of the method with a molecule derived from the acid catalyzed cyclization of a-caryophyllene, b-caryophyllene alcohol (commonly used as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetics, soaps, and detergents).13 When subjected to uorination conditions, it targets the strained cyclobutane ring (substrate 7) in 52% yield (Table 2). Based on computational modeling (B3LYP/6-311++G**), the hydroxy group bisects the cyclobutane ring; thus, the diastereomeric ratio is only 1.2 : 1. However, this observation suggests that diastereoselectivity is incumbent upon the relative position of the hydroxy group in space to the\nwith cool white LEDs for 14 h.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Products 12\u201315, on the other hand, illustrate that directionality may in turn inuence siteselectivity.\nNext, we pursued a substrate that supports our notion that hydroxy group orientation can inuence both site selectivity and diastereoselectivity favorably.

Moreover, we synthesized a complementary derivative through PCC oxidation followed by a Grignard reaction, thereby switching directionality of the hydroxy group (Fig. 3A) to target the C3 or C5 positions instead (compound 8).

Additionally, only a single stereoisomer is produced for both (d.r. 99 : 1) and reinforce this study as a salient example of diastereoselective radical uorination.\nIn the midst of characterizing compound 9, we uncovered a noteworthy hydrogen bonding interaction. Firstly, our plan was to identify the \u2013OH peak within the 1H NMR spectrum and determine if there is a through-space interaction with uorine in the 19F\u20131H HOESY NMR spectrum (ultimately aiding in assigning the stereochemistry of the uorine).15 At rst glance, no peaks were immediately discernible as the \u2013OH; however, when a stoichiometric amount of H2O is added, it becomes apparent that the \u2013OH group and geminal proton to the hydroxy peaks broaden by rapid proton exchange (Fig. 2A). Upon closer examination of the dry 1H NMR spectrum, the \u2013OH peak appears to be a sharp doublet of doublets: one bond coupling to the geminal C\u2013H proton of 9 Hz and one of the largest reported through-space couplings to uorine of 20 Hz. The 19F\u20131H HOESY spectrum also supports our regio- and stereochemical assignment \u2013 a strong interaction between uorine and Ha, Hb, and Hd, as well as no apparent interaction with Hc and He (Fig. 2B). Consequently, we postulate that intramolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the considerable coupling constant. This conclusion is also supported by calculations at\n7010 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 7007\u20137013\nB3LYP/6-311++G** (Fig. 2C): the O\u2013H\u2013F angle is given as 140 and F/H\u2013O bond distance is 1.97 A\u030a. Appreciating the complexity and biological signicance of steroids,16 we derivatized dehydroepiandrosterone to afford uorinated substrate 10 (42%; d.r. 99 : 1). Computational modeling assisted in verifying that the b-hydroxy group targets the C12 position (B3LYP/6-311++G**); furthermore, the b-uoro isomer is the major product (validated by NOESY, 1H, and 19F NMR). Additionally, we subjected 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (endogenous progestogen steroid hormone17) to uorination conditions and found the a-uoro product (11) as the major diastereomer in 55% yield (99 : 1 d.r.). To investigate further the notion of coordinated uorination and explanation of the observed stereoisomers (e.g., b-hydroxy/b-uoro and a-hydroxy/ a-uoro), we calculated a simplied system comparing the uorination of 1-propyl radical and g-propanol radical (Scheme 2C). The reaction can be distilled into two key steps: a siteselective HAT, followed by a diastereoselective uorination reaction. The following isodesmic relation (uB97xd/6-31+G*, 7.63 kcal mol 1) illustrates the stabilizing energetic role that the hydroxy group plays in commanding diastereoselectivity. The transition states represent low barrier processes; a solvent dielectric was necessary to nd saddle points.\nAdditionally, a simple Protein Data Bank (PDB) survey showed numerous intermolecular close contacts between hydroxy groups and H\u2013C\u2013+NR3 moieties.18 What is more,\nH2O in solution.

Alternatively, one can imagine the reaction proceeding through a Barton20 or Hofmann\u2013Lo\u0308ffler\u2013Freytag21 style mechanism. To probe this possibility, we employed a b-caryophyllene alcohol hypochlorite derivative to form the alkoxy radical directly, and found that under standard conditions there is complex fragmentation and nonselective uorination (Scheme 2B). Lastly, we compared the hydroxy versus carbonyl group SF coordination computationally. The carbonyl group is preferred to bind to SF through nonclassical C\u2013H/O hydrogen bonds preferentially over the hydroxy group, as the following isodesmic relation shows (acetone and t-BuOH asmodels; uB97xd/ 6-31+G*, 3.81 kcal mol 1), but, once again, rigidity and propinquity are ultimately more important factors in determining directing effects (Scheme 3).\nThe tetrahedral nature of hydroxy groups provides unique access to previously unobtainable sites. For example, we compared menthol and an alkylated congener to form products 12 and 13 (Fig. 3B). The hydroxy group in the precursor to 12 is in the equatorial position, mandating the exocyclic isopropyl group as the reactive site (40% yield).22 In the precursor to 13, the methyl and isopropyl substituent lock the hydroxy group\nScheme 4 Comparing fluorination outcomes for different functional groups.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ninto the axial position, targeting its endocyclic tertiary site through a 1,3-diaxial relationship to afford uorinated product in 57% yield (d.r. 99 : 1). In all, the comparison showcases the versatility in directing ability, offering a choice of regio- and stereoselectivity based on the stereochemistry of the hydroxy group. The directing system only necessitates two features based on our results: (1) the hydroxy group must be either secondary or tertiary (primary tends to favor oxidation) and (2) the oxygen atom must be within the range of 2.4\u20133.2 A\u030a of the targeted secondary or tertiary hydrogen.\nAmong the several biologically active compounds we screened, caratol derivatives 14 and 15 were found to be attractive candidates that reveal directed uorination to an exocyclic isopropyl group (Table 2). Comprising ca. 40% of carrot seed oil, caratol is its major constituent and has shown allelopathic interactions (e.g., as insecticidal, antifungal, and herbicidal agents23).24 Aer extraction, isolation, and derivatization, molecules 14 and 15 are afforded in 65% and 83% yield (Table 2). Acetates and oxidized sulfur-containing functional groups were well tolerated.\nAnother natural product we modied to a tertiary alcohol was sclareolide, which has a rich history of uorinating on its C2 and C3 positions due to polar effects, as reported by Tang,25 Groves,9f Britton,26 and others.27 The derived alcohol nally overrode this natural tendency and directed to the predicted position in 56% (d.r. 99 : 1) (product 16). Smaller amounts of competitive polar effect uorination were observed at the C2 and C3 positions, highlighting how challenging a problem the functionalization of the sclareolide core presents.28,29\nAn altered dihydroactinidiolide was found to participate in the uorination through a 1,3-diaxial guided HAT and uorination in 55% yield (product 17, d.r. 99 : 1). We next modeled several more substrates that participated in similar 1,3 relationships; however, each exhibited a variation from one another (e.g., ring size or fused aromatic ring). Products 19 and 18 displayed the reaction's capability to direct to the desired positions with an expanded (65%; d.r. 99 : 1) and reduced (45%; d.r. 99 : 1) ring system when compared to the previous 6-membered ring examples. Additionally, we examined a methylated a-tetralone derivative. The desired 3-uoro product 20 forms in 43% yield (d.r. 99 : 1), overriding benzylic uorination (Scheme 4).30 Under identical conditions a-tetralone provides 4-uorotetralone in 48% yield. In similar motif, 1-phenylindanol, we intentionally targeted the benzylic position in a 90% and 10 : 1 d.r. (product 21). Unlike the methylated a-tetralone derivative, the geometry of the starting material calculated at B3LYP/6311++G** shows the hydroxy group is not truly axial and is 4.30 A\u030a from the targeted C\u2013H bond, explaining the dip in diastereoselectivity.\nNext, we examined an isomer of borneol that is widely used in perfumery, fenchol.31 The secondary alcohol displays a diastereoselective uorination in 38% (d.r. 99 : 1) (product 22). Our last designed motif was ideally constructed to have a doublydirecting effect. Our observations show that a well-positioned hydroxy group not only provides sequential regioselective hydrogen atom abstraction but also displays a powerful demonstration of Selectuor guidance to afford the cis-diuoro\nChem.

Spectroscopically (1H, 13C, and 19F NMR), the product possesses apparent Cs symmetry and showcases close interactions (e.g., diagnostic couplings and chemical shis). cis-Polyuorocycloalkanes are of intense current interest in materials chemistry, wherein faces of differing polarity can complement one another.32\nAll in all, this photochemical hydroxy-directed uorination report represents one of the rst steps in commanding diastereoselectivity within the eld of radical uorination. An ability to dictate regio- and stereoselectivity is demonstrated in a variety of substrates by simply switching the stereochemistry of the hydroxy group. Computations support the key role of Selectuor coordination to the key hydroxy group in the uorination step. Future studies will seek to uncover other compatible Lewis basic functional groups, expanding further the versatility of radical uorination."
