    "abstractText": "Intellectual disability leads to a loss of autonomy and a high level of dependence, requiring support from another person permanently. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the assessment of caregiver burden in healthcare actions, to avoid putting the health of caregivers and patients at risk. In this sense, the study aimed to analyze the internal structure of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in a sample of caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities, to provide convergent and discriminant evidence with a measure of the risk of maltreatment, and to estimate the reliability of the scores from the Classical Test Theory and the Rasch Measurement Theory. The study was instrumental. The sample consisted of 287 Peruvian informal primary caregivers of persons diagnosed with intellectual disabilities. To collect validity evidence, the internal structure (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA) and the relationship with other variables (convergent and discriminant evidence) were used, while reliability was estimated through the omega coefficient and Rasch analysis. The internal structure of the ZBI corroborated a unidimensional structure. In terms of convergent and discriminant evidence, the scale presents adequate evidence. Reliability levels were also good. Previously, the psychometric properties of the ZBI have not been studied in caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities, and it represents the first study of the scale in Peru. The results obtained will allow the use of this scale to design actions in the work with caregivers and studies to understand the psychology of the caregiver.",

Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the assessment of caregiver burden in healthcare actions, to avoid putting the health of caregivers and patients at risk. In this sense, the study aimed to analyze the internal structure of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in a sample of caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities, to provide convergent and discriminant evidence with a measure of the risk of maltreatment, and to estimate the reliability of the scores from the Classical Test Theory and the Rasch Measurement Theory. The study was instrumental. The sample consisted of 287 Peruvian informal primary caregivers of persons diagnosed with intellectual disabilities. To collect validity evidence, the internal structure (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA) and the relationship with other variables (convergent and discriminant evidence) were used, while reliability was estimated through the omega coefficient and Rasch analysis. The internal structure of the ZBI corroborated a unidimensional structure. In terms of convergent and discriminant evidence, the scale presents adequate evidence. Reliability levels were also good. Previously, the psychometric properties of the ZBI have not been studied in caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities, and it represents the first study of the scale in Peru. The results obtained will allow the use of this scale to design actions in the work with caregivers and studies to understand the psychology of the caregiver.\nKeywords: Zarit Burden Interview, ZBI, caregivers, intellectual disabilities, Rasch analysis, psychometric properties\nINTRODUCTION\nThe concept of disability has evolved historically, before linked to a bio-medical model of disease and now based on a systemic model, and can be conceptualized as a health condition determined by the social context (World Health Organization [WHO], 2007). In this sense, the degree of disability depends on the interaction that the person establishes with others, being many times the attitudes of the environment an obstacle to personal, family, educational, social, or labor participation (Cuenot, 2018). It is estimated that 15.6% of people over 15 years of age live with a disability, of which 5.1% are under 14 years of age and 0.7% have a severe disability (World Health Organization [WHO] and World Bank, 2011). Disability in Peru represents 10.3% of the total population, of which, 48.3%\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\npresent visual disability, 7.6% hearing, 3.1% to speak or communicate, 15.1% to move or walk, 4.2% to understand or learn, 3.3% to relate to others, and those with multi disability represent 18.4% (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica [INEI], 2019). However, there is no exact statistics on disability due to intellectual deficit.\nIntellectual disability is one of the disabilities that generates greater dependence on its environment and is commonly associated with other comorbidities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, seizures, and sensory problems (Uzun et al., 2020). According to Schalock et al. (2021), it is defined as a deficit in intellectual functioning, which is expressed through an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70, in addition to limitations in social adaptation skills, such as self-direction, social skills, movement, and personal care among others, presenting before the age of 18 years (Tass\u00e9 et al., 2016). This type of disability leads to a loss of autonomy and a high level of dependence, requiring support from another person permanently, commonly referred to as a caregiver (Segu\u00ed et al., 2008).\nAccording to the literature, there are two types of caregivers: formal and informal. The formal caregiver is the person who receives payment for the service. While the informal caregiver is commonly a family member, friend, or neighbor. Although this type of caregiver is neither paid nor trained to perform the work, they have a high degree of commitment characterized by their affective bond (Ruiz and Nava, 2012; Montero et al., 2014).\nIn the case of people with intellectual disabilities, the type of care in healthcare is usually informal, with the mother being the main caregiver (Boluarte, 2019). Although currently there is greater economic and social participation of women. However, still retains the traditional role in child-rearing (Duarte and Garc\u00eda-Horta, 2016; Tartaglini et al., 2020). In turn, other family members also assume the role of caregiver, such as grandparents, siblings, and in some cases the father, who, in light of the existing literature, assumes little responsibility for the childrearing (Esp\u00edn, 2008; Lima-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2018; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2019). In this context, the presence of dysfunctionality in family relationships, inadequate coping styles, job abandonment, and low educational level of the mother not only affects the quality of family life (Esp\u00edn, 2008; Cohen et al., 2014) but also the deterioration of physical, mental, and social health with serious psychopathological implications (Segu\u00ed et al., 2008).\nIn this way, caregiver burden has been studied, defined as the attitudes and emotional-affective reactions from the experiences of the role with repercussions in the personal, family, and social spheres (Zarit et al., 1980). Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the assessment of caregiver burden in healthcare actions, to avoid putting the health of caregivers and patients at risk (Zarit et al., 1986; Schreiner et al., 2006).\nThere are different scales to measure caregiver burden (Crespo and Rivas, 2015), such as the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI; Novak and Guest, 1989), widely used in a different diagnostic groups, in children, adolescents, and adults with spinal cord injury (Farmer et al., 2018; Conti et al., 2019; Ortiz-Rubio et al., 2021). The CBI has been recently adapted to Spanish (V\u00e1zquez et al., 2019) obtaining a reduced version of 15 items. Likewise, the Screen for Caregiver Burden (SCB; Vitaliano et al., 1991), is\nused for the objective and subjective measurements of caregiver burden in the elderly.\nOne of the most widely used instruments is the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI; Zarit et al., 1980). This measure, unidimensional and with 29 items in its original version, assesses the caregiver\u2019s health, psychological wellbeing, finances, social life, and the relationship between the caregiver and the person with a disability. However, its factor structure and extent have had modifications over time (Knight et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2018).\nThe 22-item version (Zarit et al., 1985) has been studied in different contexts and translated into different languages, such as the United Kingdom (Siegert et al., 2010), Turkey (\u00d6zl\u00fc et al., 2009), Singapore (Seng et al., 2010), Portugal (da Cruz, 2010), Brazil (Taub et al., 2004), and among others. The adaptation to Spanish was carried out by Mart\u00edn-Carrasco et al. (1996) and later re-evaluated by Mart\u00edn-Carrasco et al. (2010), who showed that this measure was made up of three factors (i.e., burden, competence, and dependence) showing correlation with the caregiver\u2019s mental health status and the presence of behavioral disorders in the patient.\nIn its factorial structure, it has been found the presence of three factors with different denomination: impact of care, interpersonal burden, and self-efficacy expectations (Montorio et al., 1998); shame, anger, and self-criticism (Knight et al., 2000); tensions referring to the role, intrapsychic tensions, competencies, and expectations (Bianchi et al., 2016); subjective impact, competence, and dependence (Mart\u00edn-Carrasco et al., 2010); role-related strain, self-criticism, and negative emotion (Tang et al., 2016). Other studies report the presence of five factors: sacrifice, loss of control, shame/anger, self-criticism, and dependence (Lu et al., 2009), caregiver feeling of oversacrifice, dependency, negative emotion, caregiver feeling of inadequacy, and uncertainty about the patient\u2019s future (Ko et al., 2008). Other studies report four-factor structures: personal effort, privacy conflict, uncertain attitude, and guilt (Yoon and Robinson, 2005); consequences of caregiving on the caregiver, patient dependency, caregiving fatigue, uncertainty, guilt, and fear (Al-Rawashdeh et al., 2016); interpersonal burden, the impact of caregiving, competencies, and expectations about caregiving (Barreto-Osorio et al., 2015). The different theoretical interpretation in the measurement of caregiver burden with the ZBI is evident, demonstrating that there is no clear consensus on the dimensionality of the instrument (Monreal and Prieto, 2017).\nShort versions are proposed to achieve a parsimonious structural model, which allows the instrument to be used in interventions that require optimizing the application time. In this sense, H\u00e9bert et al. (2000) with a 12-item version proposes a twofactor model: personal strain and role strain. Likewise, B\u00e9dard et al. (2001) proposed a short version of 12 and a 4-item version for screening studies, reporting its usefulness in caregivers of patients with different diagnoses (caregivers of older adults and children with chronic disabilities). The 12-item unidimensional version has shown adequate psychometric properties in several studies (O\u2019Rourke and Tuokko, 2003; Ballesteros et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2017; Rueda et al., 2017; Pinyopornpanish et al., 2020; Tartaglini et al., 2020).\nThe literature shows that there is no clear consensus on the dimensionality of the instrument (Monreal and Prieto, 2017).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\nWhile some studies state the presence of three dimensions, others report the presence of one or more additional factors. Li et al. (2018) named the fourth-factor as caregiving performance corresponding to items 20 and 21. However, Barreto-Osorio et al. (2015) indicate that these items would be related to indecisiveness about caregiving (7, 20, and 21). The conceptual controversies of the construct could be explained by a solid theoretical basis. The updated theory of attachment and emotional self-regulation allows understanding the conflicts in close relationships (Jarrett, 1985; Mikulincer and Shaver, 2005), caring for people dependent on the family context, generates positive and negative affective relationships, which alter the quality of the relationship with repercussions on the quality of family life.\nReliability has been commonly measured by internal consistency, in the case of global, measures the coefficients fluctuated between 0.70 and 0.93 (Lu et al., 2009; \u00d6zl\u00fc et al., 2009; Bianchi et al., 2016). While in multidimensional analysis, coefficients below 0.70 are reported (H\u00e9bert et al., 2000). Other methods, such as test-retest and inter-observer reliability, have also been used, using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) technique, obtaining good results, e.g., ICC = 0.88 (Taub et al., 2004) and ICC = 0.78 (Rajabi-Mashhadi et al., 2015) in samples of caregivers of chronically disabled patients.\nOn the other hand, studies show the relationship of caregiver burden with other variables, such as the risk of caregiver abuse (\u00d6zcan et al., 2017; Orfila et al., 2018; Saravia et al., 2019). A positive correlation has also been observed (r = 0.844; p < 0.001) with abuse of caregivers of people with behavioral disorders affected by dementia to a moderate degree (Gimeno et al., 2021), indicating that the higher the level of burden, the risk of maltreatment increases by the caregiver. Likewise, in people with dementia in Spain, a moderate relationship (r = 0.486; p < 0.001) was found between the risk of caregiver abuse, measured through the Caregiver Abuse Screen (CASE), and caregiver burden, assessed by the ZBI (Rivera-Navarro et al., 2018).\nMost of the ZBI psychometric studies have been tested in samples of caregivers of adult patients with mental and degenerative diseases (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, and acquired brain injury). To date, there are no psychometric studies that have assessed the ZBI in caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities. However, there are studies on the burden of caregivers in this population. Kim et al. (2021) found a partial mediation of family functioning on the relationship between care burden and quality of life for caregivers of children with intellectual disabilities in Mongolia. For the measurement of care burden, they used the CBI, reporting good levels of reliability (\u03b1 > 0.70). In addition, Barros et al. (2019) found a negative relationship between quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social relationships, environment, and global) and the burden of caregivers of children and young adults with intellectual disabilities in Brazil. The assessment of burden of caregivers was conducted through the ZBI. However, due to the nature of the study, they only reported the overall estimate of reliability, which was good (\u03b1 = 0.90).\nThe psychometric properties of the ZBI have not been examined in the Peruvian context, being relevant to know its\npsychometric properties to recommend its appropriate use in clinical-therapeutic assessment and intervention. Therefore, the present study is aimed to analyze the internal structure of the Zarit Burden Inventory in a sample of Peruvian primary caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities and to test the convergent and discriminant validity with a measure of the risk of maltreatment. In addition, we seek to estimate reliability using Classical Item Theory and Rasch Measurement Theory."

From this result, it was sought to obtain a sample size greater than the minimum recommended.\nThe initial sample size was 303.

The CASE aims to detect the risk of physical, psychosocial abuse, and neglect by primary caregivers toward older adults (Reis and Nahmiash, 1995). For this study, the Spanish version of the CASE developed by\nP\u00e9rez-Rojo et al. (2015) was used. The CASE is made up of eight items grouped into two factors, Abuse (six items) and Neglect/Dependency (two items), which were found in the original study (Reis and Nahmiash, 1995) and the Spanish version (P\u00e9rez-Rojo et al., 2015). However, the Brazilian (Reichenheim et al., 2009) and Pakistani (Khan et al., 2020) versions suggest the presence of a unidimensional structure. The items are answered on a dichotomous response scale (No = 0; Yes = 1), so, their total scores vary between 0 and 8, where a higher score indicates a high risk of maltreatment.\nIn this study, for the collection of validity evidence based on internal structure, a two-factor related model was tested through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), obtaining adequate fit indices [\u03c72 = 41.284, df = 19, \u03c72/df = 2.173, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.973, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.961, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.064 [90% confidence interval (CI): 0.037, 0.091], Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.070, and Weighted Root Mean Square Residual (WRMR) = 0.885]. However, scores on the Neglect/Dependency factor presented a low level of reliability (\u03c9 = 0.412), unlike the abuse factor (\u03c9 = 0.768), which obtained an acceptable level. Because of these results and the high correlation between the factors (r = 0.940), a unidimensional model was tested. The CFA indicated good fit indices for the unifactorial structure (\u03c72 = 41.381, df = 20, \u03c72/df = 2.069, CFI = 0.974, TLI = 0.964, RMSEA = 0.061 [90% CI: 0.034, 0.088], SRMR = 0.070, and WRMR = 0.889) and the factor loadings were found to be between 0.527 and 0.876. Likewise, the average variance explained (AVE) was 0.491, showing an acceptable level of convergent evidence. Regarding reliability, the CASE showed acceptable internal consistency (\u03c9 = 0.793 [95% CI: 0.733, 0.824])."

The identified caregivers signed an informed consent form, where the objective of the research was explained to them and the guarantee of confidentiality and anonymity of their participation. Subsequently, the caregivers proceeded to fill out the data collection form in person. This form consisted of a sociodemographic survey and the two measurement instruments (ZBI and CASE).\nOnce the database with 303 responses was obtained, univariate outliers were analyzed through the median absolute deviation (Leys et al., 2019) and multivariate outliers through the Mahalanobis-MCD distance (Leys et al., 2018). Four cases of univariate outliers and 12 cases of multivariate outliers were found, being removed from the database, leaving the final database with 287 participants. This process was carried out because many statistical procedures are affected by the presence of outliers. In some situations, in the presence of outliers, the statistical power of some methods presents less power and therefore, unreliable results (Aguinis et al., 2013). Likewise, outlier detection is a recommended good practice in data management. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed with\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\nand without outliers, observing a small impact of outliers, mainly in descriptive statistics, such as the mean (Thabane et al., 2013)."

In the first stage, the descriptive measures of the items were obtained through the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. These last two coefficients indicated the level of departure from a normal distribution, considering adequate values between \u22122 and 2 (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2019). Likewise, the floor effect and ceiling effect of the items were analyzed, considering the percentage of people who answered the lowest and highest answer alternative, respectively. In this sense, those items with percentages equal to or less than 15% were evaluated as free of these effects (McHorney and Tarlov, 1995). Additionally, the discrimination of the items was estimated through the corrected item-rest polyserial correlation, taking as acceptable indices greater than 0.20 (Schmeiser and Welch, 2006).\nIn the second stage, validity evidence was collected based on the internal structure of the test using CFA. The estimation method was the Weighted Least Squares Means and Variance adjusted (WLSMV) with robust SEs and Scaling-Shifted scaled statistic test (SS), applied to the matrix of polychoric correlations of the items. To fix the metrics of the dimensions, one of their indicators, called the reference indicator, was used. That is, the factor loadings of the first indicator with its dimension were fixed. These fixed loadings were equal to 1. Regarding the goodnessof-fit indices to assess the estimated models, the ratio between Chi-square and degrees of freedom (SS\u03c72/df) was used, taking as appropriate values below 5 (Schumacker and Lomax, 2016); the CFI and TLI with adequate values higher than 0.90 (Keith, 2019); the RMSEA and SRMR considering values less than 0.08 as adequate (Schumacker and Lomax, 2016); and the WRMR with values lower than 1 being appropriate (DiStefano et al., 2018). Likewise, factor loadings above 0.40 were considered acceptable (Brown, 2015).\nLater, in the third phase, validity evidence was collected based on the relationship with other variables. For this purpose, convergent and discriminant evidence was collected. The convergent evidence was evaluated from the average variance extracted (AVE), taking as minimum acceptable values those proposed by Moral (2019), which considers the factor loadings,"

A structural equation model (SEM) was tested to estimate the relationship between ZBI and CASE, using the same criteria as in the CFA to assess model fit. In addition, the relationship between the variables was assessed as small, medium, and large considering correlation coefficients above 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50, respectively (Cohen, 1988). On the other hand, the discriminant evidence was collected through two procedures, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT), taking as adequate values lower than 0.85 (Henseler et al., 2015), and the Fornell and Larcker criterion, which consists of comparing the square root of the AVE and the correlations with the other variables, where the former must be greater than the latter to conclude that there is discriminant evidence (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).\nIn the fourth phase of analysis, the reliability of the test scores was evaluated using the internal consistency method. For this objective, the ordinal omega coefficient was used, estimated from the factorial solution obtained from the CFA (Viladrich et al., 2017; Flora, 2020). This coefficient varies between 0 and 1, being valued as adequate from 0.70 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). CIs were estimated at a 95% confidence level using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method with 10,000 replications. Additionally, to have a better understanding of the score reliability, inter-item polychoric correlations were estimated (Ventura-Le\u00f3n and Pe\u00f1a-Calero, 2021).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\nFinally, an analysis of the ZBI was carried out from the perspective of Rasch Measurement Theory, using Andrich\u2019s Rasch model or Rating Scale. Within this analysis, the functionality of the response categories was analyzed based on the use of statistical criteria for scale optimization. In addition, the fit of the model to the data was evaluated based on three fit indices (RMSEA, TLI, and CFI), taking as acceptable values those presented in the CFA. On the other hand, the reliability of the persons and items was estimated, considering values above 0.70 adequate (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). Finally, the fit of the items to the model was verified using the Infit and Outfit statistics, being considered good between 0.7 and 1.3 (Wright and Linacre, 1994; Bond and Fox, 2013).\nThe data analysis was carried out through R version 4.1.1 (R Core Team, 2021) in the RStudio graphical user interface (RStudio Team, 2021). The tidyverse package version 1.3.1 (Wickham et al., 2019) was used for data manipulation; the Routliers package version 0.0.0.3 (Klein and Delacre, 2021) for the identification of outliers; the psych package version 2.1.9 (Revelle, 2021) for descriptive analysis; the lavaan package version 0.6-9 (Rosseel, 2012) for the CFA; the semTools package version 0.5-5 (Jorgensen et al., 2021) to estimate the reliability, AVE, and HTMT; the CTT package version 2.3.3 (Willse, 2018) to estimate the polyserial item-rest correlation; the MBESS package version 4.8.0 (Kelley, 2020) for the estimation of CIs for reliability coefficients; and the mirt package version 1.34 (Chalmers, 2012) for Rasch analysis."

To date, different versions of this measure have been developed for some conditions (i.e., dementia, Alzheimer, and cognitive complaints). The present study was conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the ZBI in Peruvian caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first study in this sample. To this end, we evaluated the factorial structure of ZBI, its internal consistency, and its association to other variables."

            "text": "Regarding its internal structure, we assess the dimensionality of the previous nineteen models. Results from CFA indicated that Whitlatch et al.\u2019s (1991) two-factor with 22 items model provided a poor fit to the data. These results are consistent with other studies (Knight et al., 2000; Li et al., 2018; Landfeldt et al., 2019). Thus, we opted to try other solutions. In the current sample, we found a significant improvement for H\u00e9bert et al.\u2019s (2000) and Rueda et al.\u2019s (2017) model, which have single- and two-factor structures, respectively. However, our data fit slightly better for Rueda et al.\u2019s (2017) model.\nSimilar findings were obtained by Tartaglini et al. (2020), who found that the fit of the model improved by reducing to 17 items loaded on one factor, so they remained five more items (i.e., item 1: \u201cFeel your relative asks for more help than he/she needs,\u201d item 4: \u201cFeel embarrassed over your relative\u2019s behavior,\u201d item 5: \u201cFeel angry when you are around your relative,\u201d item 8: \u201cFeel your relative is dependent on you,\u201d and item 14: \u201cFeel that your relative seems to expect you to take care of him/her as if you were the only one he/she could depend on\u201d). Four of these five items had the weakest factor loadings in Tartaglini et al. (2020), and four of five of these items were also eliminated for Rueda et al.\u2019s (2017) model. Regarded item content, Rasch modeling confirmed that the data fit well for Rueda et al.\u2019s (2017) model. None of the items reported severe misfit, which demonstrated unidimensionality. In addition, the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\nAndrich Rasch model showed a better fit than the 12-item version of Pinyopornpanish et al. (2020), which did not demonstrate unidimensionality.\nOn the other hand, the results also showed a poor fit for the three and four-factor models. This finding contrasts with previous studies that revealed the ZBI is multidimensional. In this sense, Pinyopornpanish et al.\u2019s (2020) validation study found that three-factor and four-factor provided a better fit to the data for ZBI-22 than a unidimensional model. It is noteworthy that the authors allowed the covariance of item 11 (Feel you do not have as much privacy as you) and item 12 (Feel your social life has suffered due to caring for your relative) residuals for all models (i.e., onefactor, two-factor, three-factor, and four-factor), which was needed to reach an acceptable fit. However, the specification of correlations between residuals may hide a misspecified model or a bad internal structure, showing an increase in goodness-of-fit indices, which would not contribute to the understanding of the model and the measurement of the construct (Dominguez-Lara, 2019).\nTherefore, it can be concluded that, in informal caregivers of persons with intellectual disabilities, the use of a short version of the ZBI is better than the full 22-item version (ZBI-22). Specifically, in this study, the 13-item version proposed by Rueda et al. (2017) is suggested. The nine items that presented problems (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 14, 15, 20, and 21) do not contribute to the measurement of the construct \u201cburden.\u201d Item 1 (Feel that your relative asks for more help than he/she needs) because people with intellectual disabilities require a higher level of support for certain tasks, caregivers may not consider that these people exaggerate in their demands. Items 4 (Feel embarrassed over your relative\u2019s behavior), 5 (Feel angry when you are around your relative), and 7 (Afraid what the future holds for your relative) were shown to be problematic as they link caregivers\u2019 emotions to the present or future of people with intellectual disabilities, this possibly because of the familial bonding that occurs in most of them.\nThe situation pointed out in the previous items may be the same as with items 20 (Feel you should be doing more for your relative) and 21 (Feel you could do a better job in caring for your relative), related to feelings of guilt and inferiority on the part of the caregivers. Items 8 (Feel your relative is dependent on you), and 14 (Feel that your relative seems to expect you to take care of him/her as if you were the only one he/she could depend on) are related to the dependence of people with intellectual disabilities and caregivers, which is assumed in most cases, because of the family bond. Finally, item 15 (Feel that you do not have enough money to take care of your relative in addition to the rest of your expenses) is the one that relates little to the rest of the ZBI items, as it refers to a socio-economic aspect of the caregiver, so it seems to be a very specific issue within the instrument."

In this sample, caregiver burden displayed a significant positive association with a measure of the risk of mistreatment, a result that is consistent with previous studies (Gimeno et al., 2021), which showed a strong correlation between ZBI and CASE (>0.80). In addition, the present study found a higher correlation between the CASE and ZBI total scores (r = 0.667) compared to that reported by Rivera-Navarro et al. (2018), who showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.486) in a sample of caregivers of people with dementia. On the other hand, the AVE of the ZBI was 0.404, adequate for the context of the study (Moral, 2019), and the discriminant evidence indicators showed acceptable levels. Thus, the ZBI scores present convergent and discriminant evidence."

            "text": "In interpreting the results from the study, several limitations are noteworthy. First, the sample was predominately female, so we were not able unable to examine the measurement invariance across gender. However, previous research has suggested that levels of experienced burden are different between women and men (Lai, 2012; Lin et al., 2017). Second, the burden was evaluated using a self-reported instrument. Thus, results could be affected by social desirability or memory biases (Althubaiti, 2016). Future research may also include other strategies as in-depth qualitative interviews. Third, we employed a convenience sample, so the results are not necessarily representative of the population. Fourth, the study design was cross-sectional, and it was not viable to assess test-retest reliability and predictive validity. Future studies using longitudinal designs could make available more useful information.\nDespite the limitations, our study is the first to apply the ZBI to caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities. Moreover, the present work is the first to validate the Peruvian version of the ZBI. Furthermore, the unidimensional structure of the ZBI allows researchers and clinicians to use it and obtain an overall score easily, due to it consists of only 13 items. From a methodological perspective, this study assessed the internal structure using both Classical Test Theory and Rasch model and provided a model\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 792805\nthat explains the relationship of the ZBI with other psychological constructs using SEM. In this sense, our findings support the robust validity and reliability of the ZBI."

            "text": "The ZBI is a commonly used tool in international caregiver burden investigation. The key contribution of this study relies on the validation of the ZBI in a sample of caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities. Analysis of internal structure validity using CFA and Rasch modeling supports a unidimensional structure. Hence, this version of the ZBI allows for a time-efficient and useful assessment of the burden."
