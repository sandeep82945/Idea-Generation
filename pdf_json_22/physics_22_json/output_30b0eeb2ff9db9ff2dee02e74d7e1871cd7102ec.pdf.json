Several parameter sets (SRV\u2019s) are generated to asses the influence of \u03b4-meson on the properties of neutron star. These parametrizations correspond to different values of coupling constant of \u03b4-meson to the nucleons with remaining ones calibrated to yield finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter properties consistent with the available experimental data. It is observed that to fit the properties of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, a stronger coupling between isovector-vector \u03c1 meson and nucleons is required in the presence of \u03b4 field. Furthermore, the \u03b4meson is found to affect the radius of canonical neutron star significantly. The value of dimensionless tidal deformability, \u039b for the canonical neutron star also satisfies the constraints from the waveform models analysis of GW170817 binary neutron star merger event. A covariance analysis is performed to estimate the statistical uncertainties of the model parameters as well as correlations among the model parameters and different observables of interest.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNeutron stars are the densest objects in the observable universe and deep knowledge of the Equation of State (EoS) of the dense matter in beta-equilibrium is thus required to understand their behavior. It has been shown that the dense matter EoS must be treated relativistically [1, 2]. For this reason, relativistic mean field (RMF) models have been widely used to obtain a realistic description of the properties of finite nuclei, bulk nuclear matter or the properties of neutron stars. Currently, many different variants of RMF models with various couplings are in use to study the finite nuclei and neutron star properties [3\u20135]. Accurate constraints are necessary to understand the limits of these different types of models. During the last decade, a wide range of astrophysical observations such as the precise measurement of massive millisecond pulsars using Shapiro delay technique [6, 7], detection of gravitational wave generated by binary neutron stars in the GW170817 event by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration [8, 9], or the joint mass radius measurement of neutron stars using X-ray timing technique by NICER collaboration [10\u201313] started to provide unprecedented new constraints on the dense matter EoS. They have triggered plethora of theoretical studies to look at the dense matter EoS from very different perspectives c.f. Ref. [14] and references therein. First of its kind model independent\n\u2217 virenthakur2154@gmail.com \u2020 raj.phy@gmail.com \u2021 sinp.bijay@gmail.com \u00a7 shashi.dhiman@gmail.com\nmeasurement of neutron skin thickness \u2206rnp of 208Pb [15] and 48Ca [16] in the Jefferesen lab also inspired theoretical studies to take a fresher look at the isovector channel of the nuclear interaction [17\u201321].\nEffective mass of nucleon quantifies the momentum dependence of nuclear force in the medium. It can be quoted for infinite nuclear matter at the Fermi surface. It is, however, necessary to realize that the concept of effective mass is different in non-relativistic [22, 23] and relativistic formalism [24]. Nevertheless, it plays some crucial roles to determine various finite nuclear properties e.g. isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR) [25], nucleon nucleon scattering in optical potentials [26] or even in realizing various properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars [27, 28]. Recently, a systematic study was performed using RMF models which assessed the impact of relativistic (Dirac) effective mass (M\u2217) on the properties of neutron star [29]. The isovector splitting of the effective mass, which measures the difference between neutron (M\u2217n) and proton (M \u2217 p ) effective mass, can influence greatly as well the physical properties of finite nuclei such as locating the drip-lines [30] or nucleonnucleus scattering of asymmetric systems [26]. Its impact increases manifold in high density environment which can alter thermal and transport properties of asymmetric matter [31, 32] or neutrino opacities of neutron star matter [33]. To settle its value, even at saturation, remains a persisting challenge both theoretically [34\u201338] and experimentally [26, 39, 40].\nAppearance of isovector splitting of effective mass to the leading order in RMF models occurs through the isovector-scalar \u03b4 mesons. It impacts the proton fraction in neutron stars and hence the cooling process of\n2 neutron stars after formation [41, 42]. It can also influence the global properties of neutron stars [27, 28, 43\u201346]. A systematic study of RMF models with added freedom in the isospin channel through \u03b4 meson, optimized using well constrained finite nuclear properties and extrapolating at high density to understand the properties of neutron stars and in general dense matter EoS, can enhance our knowledge on the density dependence of the isovector channel of nuclear interaction. The present study is aimed towards investigating the effects of \u03b4 meson on the dense matter EoS within the framework of RMF model. We generate several parameter sets by varying the coupling strength of \u03b4 meson to the nucleons such that the low density behaviour of the EOSs remain consistent with the available finite nuclei data and a few empirical properties of infinite nuclear matter evaluated at the saturation density. The properties of neutron stars obtained with these EOSs are them compared to asses the role of \u03b4 mesons. The paper is organized as follows. In section II, the theoretical framework which is used to construct the EoS for neutron stars is discussed. We also discuss the procedure to optimize the coupling constants and the method to perform a covariance analysis in the same section. In section III, we present our results. We summarize and draw our conclusions in section IV."

            "text": "In the present study, five new relativistic interactions SRV00, SRV01, SRV02, SRV03, and SRV04 have been generated for the Lagrangian density given by Eq. (1) to investigate the effect of \u03b4 meson on the properties of finite nuclei and neutron star matter. Here, SRV00, SRV01, SRV02, SRV03 and SRV04 parametrizations correspond to different value of the coupling of \u03b4-meson to the nucleon i.e. g\u03b4 = 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 respectively. As the effect of \u03b4 meson is predominantly important at suprasaturation densities, one can a-priori anticipate its insignificant impact in finite nuclei, which is primarily sensitive to the EoS at subsaturation densities. This is the reason why we kept fixed the g\u03b4 at aforementioned values optimizing the rest of the parameters in Eq. (1). This is not far from the strategy recently used by Li et. al. in Ref. [46]. The parameters of the model are obtained by fitting the experimental data [50] on binding energies (BE) and charge rms radii (rch) [51] of some spherical nuclei 16,24O, 40,48Ca, 56,78Ni, 88Sr,90Zr, 100,116,132Sn and 208Pb. For the open shell nuclei, the pairing has been included using BCS formalism with constant pairing gaps [52, 53] that are taken from the nucleon separation energies of neighboring nuclei [50]. Neutron and proton pairing gaps are evaluated by using fourth order finite difference mass formula (five point difference) [54]. The neutron and proton pairing gaps (\u2206n,\u2206p) in MeV for the open shell nuclei are 88Sr(0.0,1.284), 90Zr(0.0,1.239) and 116Sn(1.189,0.0). The neutron pairing gap for 24O practically vanishes since the first unoccupied orbit 1d3/2 is almost 4.5 MeV above the completely filled 2s1/2 orbit [55, 56]. The pairing correlation energies for a fix gap \u2206 is calculated by using the paring window of 2~\u03c9, where ~\u03c9 = 45A\u22121/3 - 25A\u22122/3 MeV [48]. We also incorporated the recently measured neutron skin thickness of 208Pb using the parity violating electron scattering experiment [15] in our fit data. The optimization of the parameters (p) appearing in the Lagrangian (Eq. 1) is done by using the simulated annealing method (SAM) [57\u201359] by following \u03c72 minimization procedure which is given as,\n\u03c72(p) = 1\nNd \u2212Np\nNd \u2211\ni=1\n( M expi \u2212M th i\n\u03c3i\n)2\n, (3)\nwhere Nd is the number of experimental data points and Np is the number of fitted parameters. The \u03c3i denotes adopted errors [60, 61] and M expi and M th i are the experimental and the corresponding theoretical values, respectively, for a given observable. The minimum value of \u03c720 corresponds to the optimal values p0 of the parameters. Once the optimized parameter set is obtained, the correlation coefficient between two quantities Y and Z, can be calculated by covariance analysis [60\u201364] as\nrY Z = \u2206Y\u2206Z \u221a\n\u2206Y 2 \u2206Z2 , (4)\n3\nwhere covariance between Y and Z is expressed as\n\u2206Y\u2206Z = \u2211\n\u03b1\u03b2\n(\n\u2202Y\n\u2202p\u03b1\n)\np 0\nC\u22121\u03b1\u03b2\n(\n\u2202Z\n\u2202p\u03b2\n)\np 0\n.

            "text": "We have obtained five different parameter sets corresponding to different values of g\u03b4 by calibrating the remaining prameters to a suitable set of on finite nuclei as described earlier. All parametrizations obtained in the present work give equally good fit to the properties of finite nuclei which were used for the optimization procedure. In Table I we display optimum values of the model parameters for all the five SRV parameter sets along with the uncertainties on them computed using Eq. (5). It can be seen that the parameter g\u03c1 increases with the increase in value of g\u03b4. A larger value of g\u03c1 is required in the presence of the \u03b4-field to fit the properties of finite nuclei. As the contribution of the \u03b4-field is attractive, increased binding due to the \u03b4-field has to be compensated by the higher value of the repulsion by the \u03c1-field. The parameter g\u03c1 has its lowest value for SRV00 parametrization (g\u03b4=0). For any finite value of \u03b4-coupling (g\u03b4 > 0) i.e. for SRV01, SRV02, SRV03 and SRV04 parametrizations, the strength of \u03c1-coupling (g\u03c1) increases gradually. The cross-coupling between the \u03c9\u00b5 and \u03c1\u00b5 fields quantified by the term c1 decreases slightly from 4.6003 to 3.0107 as the value of coupling constant g\u03b4 increases from 0.0 to 4.0 corresponding to different SRV parametrizations. In Table II, different observables fitted in the present work, their experimental values [50, 51], adopted errors \u03c3 on them [65] along with the calculated values for different\nSRV parametrizations are displayed. The estimated uncertanties are also listed for the fitted observables. The fitted values of finite nuclei properties are quite close to their experimental counterparts. The root mean square (rms) errors on the BE are found to be in the range 1.50\u22121.86MeV, and the ones for rch are found to be 0.02 fm for the different parameterizatons. It is quite interesting to observe that even though g\u03b4 influences the coupling g\u03c1, the isovector sensitive observable \u2206rnp varies only slightly \u223c 0.01 fm across the different SRV models obtained in the present work. This observation is quite similar to the one obtained by Li et. al. [46].\nIn Table III, we present the results for the properties of Symmetric Nuclear Matter (SNM) such as binding energy per nucleon (E/A), incompressibility (K), the ratio of effective mass to the mass of nucleon (M\u2217/M) along with symmetry energy coefficient (J), and its slope (L), all are evaluated at the saturation density (\u03c10). We also quote the theoretically calculated error on them. The results are presented for all five SRV parametrizations.\n4\nThe value of E/A lies in the range \u221216.09 to \u221216.12 for the five parametrizations. The value of J and L obtained by our parametrizations are consistent with the constraints from observational analysis J = 31.6 \u00b1 2.66 MeV and L = 58.9 \u00b1 16 MeV [66, 67]. The value of K is also in agreement with the value 240 \u00b1 20 MeV determined from isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) for 90Zr and 208Pb nuclei [68, 69]. It can also be seen from Table III that the mean values of the slope of of symmetry energy (L) for SRV parametrizations decrease with the increase in the value of g\u03b4. The average value of L decreases from 65.23 MeV in SRV00 to 55.31 MeV for SRV04. It can be noted that the isoscalar properties (E/A, K, \u03c10 and M\n\u2217/M) are well constrained for all SRV parametrizations. The only exception is the error on K in case of SRV04, where the error is almost 10% of its central value. But in the isovector sector, the percentage error on the slope of symmetry energy (L) are consis-\ntently on the larger side for all SRV parametrizations.\nA great deal of importance to perform covariance analysis in theoretical studies has been pointed out recently [60, 63]. It not only enables one to quote statistical uncertainties on model parameters or any calculated observables, but also privedes complementary information about the sensitivity of the parameters to physical observables, redundancies among fitted observables or interdependences among model parameters. As our primary objective is not to establish an ultimate model, for demonstrative purpose, we will discuss the results of covariance analysis as outlined in Section IIB, only for the model SRV02. The results for other parameter sets are quite similar (not shown here). In Fig. 1, the correlation coefficients between different model parameters appearing in Eq. (1) are outlined for SRV02 parametrization. A strong correlation is found between the several pairs of model parameters, like, g\u03c3 and g\u03c9, g\u03c1 and c1 and \u03bb\n5 g \u03c3 g\u03c9 g \u03c1 \u03ba \u03bb c 1 \u03b6 m \u03c3 E/A K \u03c1 0 M * /M J L Pb 20 8 sk in SRV02 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nFIG. 2. (Color online) Correlation coefficients (absolute values) between the model parameters and a set of physical observables for SRV02 parametrization (see text for details).\nand \u03b6 with correlation coefficients 0.99, 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. These interdependences mean that if one of these pairs are fixed at a particular value, the other must attain the precise value as suggested by their correlation to satisfactorily obtain the fit data. The results obtained for the correlations among model parameters presented in Fig. 1 are quite similar to the obtained in Refs. [19, 70]. Anticipating the strong correlation between L and \u2206rnp which is shown later (see Fig. 3), this may be attributed to the large experimental error on the \u2206rnp for\n208Pb, which also led us choosing a rather large adopted error during optimization. The theoretical errors on the \u2206rnp of\n208Pb nucleus are found to be 0.032, 0.028, 0.026, 0.0353 and 0.029 fm for SRV00, SRV01, SRV02, SRV03, and SRV04 parametrizations, respectively. These are much smaller compared to the adopted error (0.071 fm, which is also the experimental error obtained in Ref. [15]).\nWe now display in Fig. 2, the correlation coefficients between the model parameters apearing in Lagrangian (Eq. 1) and the different properties of interest corresponding to the SNM and the density dependent symmetry energy as displayed in Table III and the \u2206rnp of\n208Pb for SRV02. A strong correlation is observed between the isovector parameter g\u03c1 with the symmetry energy coefficient (J), its slope (L) and \u2206rnp of\n208Pb. The vector mixing parameter c1 is also found to have a strong correlation with the J and L. This strong correlation is anticipated, as c1 and g\u03c1 are strongly correlated to each other, which was observed in Fig. 1. It is also realized from Fig. 2 that bulk properties of SNM like E/A, K, \u03c10 and M\u2217/M have strong correlations with isoscalar coupling parameters g\u03c3, g\u03c9 and \u03ba. This study is quite consistent with previous calculations in the literature [20, 56, 70].\nE/A K \u03c1 0 M * /M J L\nPb 20 8 sk in\nE/A\nK\n\u03c1 0\nM * /M\nJ\nL\nPb 20 8 sk in\nSRV02\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nFIG. 3.

(Color online) Effective masses of proton and neutron for a few values of asymmetry parameter \u03b1 for SRV04 parametrization.\nIn Fig. 3, we display the correlation coefficients among the different observables in graphical form, particularly which were also studied in Fig. 2. In the isoscalar sector the only strong correlation observed is between binding energy per nucleon (E/A) and incompressibility coefficient (K). The K also shows some mild correlations with all other observables displayed in the figure. The symmetry energy J and its slope parameter L are found to be strongly correlated. As mentioned earlier in the discussion of Table III, we observe a strong correlation of the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb with J and L. These results are also in line with the earlier ones [70].\n6 It is quite important to emphasize that we kept fixed the strength of the coupling of \u03b4 meson to different values and optimized the rest. This might be partially responsible to impart a strong correlation among the isovector sensitive parameters g\u03c1, c1 to J, L or \u2206rnp of\n208Pb (see Fig. 2) to reproduce the fitted data within bounds. It further gets clarified in the strong correlations among \u2206rnp (\n208Pb), J and L in Fig. 3. Anticipating the results obtained for neutron stars which are discussed later, this strong correlation somewhat restricts the behavior of the matter at high densities in the isovector channel, resulting in a monotonic increasing in the radius and tidal deformability of 1.4 M\u2299 (see Table IV) with the increase of the \u03b4 meson coupling g\u03b4. A full optimization is thus needed with suitable data in the future including g\u03b4, to understand this behavior further. In the present work we have included the simplest form of \u03b4-meson coupling (g\u03b4) to the nucleons. Furthermore, a higher order mixed scalar interactions of \u03b4 meson has a large influence on the symmetry energy and its density dependence. This enables one to have flexibility to vary the behaviour of EoS at high density and gives a large influence on the properties of neutron stars [71\u201373]. To study the effects of \u03b4-meson on nucleon mass, in Fig. 4, the effective mass of proton and neutron are plotted as a function of baryon density for three values of asymmetry parameter \u03b1= 0, 0.5, 1 (\u03b1=\n\u03c1n\u2212\u03c1p \u03c1n+\u03c1p ) for SRV04 parametrization, which has\nthe largest value of g\u03b4 amongst all SRV variants obtained in the present work. The asymmetry parameter \u03b1 = 0.0 represents the SNM and \u03b1=1 corresponds to the pure neutron matter (PNM). It is clear from the Eq. (2) that the presence of \u03b4-meson leads to splitting of nucleon mass. For SNM, there is no splitting of the nucleon mass. In Fig. 4, the solid (dashed) lines depict the effective mass of proton (neutron) for \u03b1= 0, 0.5 and 1.0. One can observe from the figure that the effective proton mass is larger than the neutron effective mass. The splitting of the proton and neutron effective masses due to the \u03b4-meson can be important in the highly asymmetric system like a neutron star or supernova environment. At the center of a neutron star the density can reach \u223c 5-6 \u03c10 and \u03b1 \u223c 0.7-0.8. One can readily estimate the amount of splitting in the effective mass in this situation looking at Fig. 4. It can also affect the transport properties of neutron star matter [74].\nTo assess the impact of \u03b4-meson on the global properties of neutron star, we plot the gravitational mass (MG) of non-rotating neutron star as a function of radius for all SRV parametrizations in Fig. 5. The maximum mass (Mmax) and the corresponding radius (Rmax) of neutron star for all the models obtained here lie in the range 2.04 - 2.13 M\u2299 and 11.48 - 12.11 km, respectively. This satisfies the recently measured radius of PSRJ0740+6620with 12.45+0.65\u22120.65 km by NICER collaboration [12, 13]. The radius of neutron star of 2M\u2299 is also in accordance with the observational data of PSRJ0740+6620 by NICER [12, 13]. The maximum mass of the neutron star attained by various SRV parametrizations supports the constraint\n8 10 12 14 16 R(km)\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2\nM G\n(M o)\nSRV00\nSRV01\nSRV02\nSRV03\nSRV04\nC au\nsa lit\ny PSR J1614-2230PSR J0348+432\n.\nPSR J0740+6620\nMiller(2019)\nRiley(2019)\nGW170817 (Rezzolla 2018)\nRiley (2021) Miller (2021)\nFIG. 5.

It is observed that the radius (R1.4) of neutron star with mass 1.4M\u2299, can be significantly affected by the presence of \u03b4-meson as we move from parametrization set SRV00 to SRV04. The value of R1.4 with the inclusion of TM1 crust EoS [77] lies in the range 12.92- 13.86 km, which is also in line with the range proposed in Ref. [12, 78]. It is observed that the radius R1.4 increases by 7.27 % and the maximum mass of neutron star changes by 4.4 % from SRV00 to SRV04 parametrizations with the variation of coupling g\u03b4= 0.0 to 4.0. This change in the neutron star properties may be attributed to the impact of \u03b4-meson, which affects high-density behavior of asymmetric nuclear matter.\nTidal deformability imparted by the companion stars on one another in a binary system can yield remarkable information on the EoS for neutron star [79, 80]. In Fig. 6, we show the results of dimensionless tidal deformability \u039b, defined as \u039b= (2/3)k2(R/MG)\n5, where k2 is the love number, as a function of the neutron star mass MG for different SRV models. The recent constraints on the tidal deformability \u039b1.4 of 1.4M\u2299 neutron star including GW170817 [8, 81] is also given in the figure. The value of \u039b1.4 lies in the range 484 - 783 for different SRV parametrizations, which satisfies the proposed limit are listed in Refs. [8, 78, 82, 83]. The value of \u039b1.4 increases with the increase in the value of the coupling g\u03b4 corresponding to the SRV parametrizations as can be seen from Fig. 6. All these results are summarized in Table IV. The theoretical erros/uncertainities in neutron star properties for SRV parametrizations are also mentioned\n7\nTABLE IV. The properties of nonrotating neutron star for the various EOSs computed with SRV parameter sets are presented along with the theoretical errors on them.

The neutron star properties such as Mmax, Rmax, R1.4, R2.0 are relatively well constrained for all SRV parametrizations (at \u2264 3 %) whereas for \u039b1.4, the theoretical uncertainities are found to be \u2264 10%.\nTo this end, we may mention that the contribution of \u03b4 meson is considered only through its linear interaction with nucleons. However, inclusion of the self interaction of \u03b4 mesons and the mixed interactions with other mesons may alter the symmetry energy at suprasaturation densities. This would further enhance the flexibility of EOS of dense matter and accordingly the properties of neutron stars [71\u201373]. Inclusion of the higher order contributions of \u03b4 meson thus enable one to model the properties of neutron stars in somewhat independent of the properties of finite nuclei. The optimization of effective Lagrangian that includes different terms involving \u03b4 meson field requires accurate knowledge of neutron star properties over a wide range of mass."

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "The effect of the isovector-scalar field corresponding to \u03b4-meson in relativistic mean field theory is investigated. We have generated five sets of SRV parametrizations SRV00, SRV01, SRV02, SRV03 and SRV04 to explore the effects of \u03b4-meson on the properties of finite nuclei, infinite nuclear matter, and neutron stars. A covariance analysis to measure the accuracy of model predictions is also performed. This also enabled us to carry out a systematic study of correlations among model parameters and various finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter properties of interest. The SRV parametrizations have been obtained in such a way that they reproduce the ground state properties of the finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter properties quite convincingly. In turn, they satisfy the constraints on mass and radius of the neutron star and its dimensionless tidal deformability, \u039b, from recent astrophysical observations [8, 66, 67, 78, 81]. It is observed that to fit the properties of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, a stronger coupling between the \u03c1-meson and nucleons (g\u03c1) is required in the presence \u03b4-meson field. Furthermore, the \u03b4-meson significantly affects the radius of canonical neutron star. It is found that the contributions from \u03b4-meson is important and has some significant effects on the dense matter EoS. The value of \u039b1.4 for different SRV parametrization is also in line with the constraint obtained from GW170817 event. It is clear that the isovector splitting of effective mass of nucleon in the presence of \u03b4 in dense asymmetric matter, like the scenario present in the core of a neutron star, can be significant. It remains, however, an open question how to identify in future the signatures of isovector effective mass splitting from astrophysical observations."
