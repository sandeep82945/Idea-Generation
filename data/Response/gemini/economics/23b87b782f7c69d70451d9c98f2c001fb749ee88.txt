1. **Investigate the impact of network density on knowledge acquisition performance.** The study found that bridging inter-network connections and intra-network cohesion have a positive effect on knowledge acquisition performance. However, it is unclear how network density, or the number of connections between actors in a network, affects this relationship. Future research could explore how network density moderates the effects of bridging inter-network connections and intra-network cohesion on knowledge acquisition performance.
2. **Examine the role of trust in the relationship between network configuration and knowledge acquisition performance.** The study suggests that relational cohesion, or the strength of relationships between actors in a network, is important for knowledge acquisition performance. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to relational cohesion. Future research could investigate the role of trust in the relationship between network configuration and knowledge acquisition performance.
3. **Explore the effects of network configuration on different types of knowledge acquisition.** The study focuses on the effects of network configuration on knowledge acquisition performance in general. However, it is possible that network configuration has different effects on different types of knowledge acquisition, such as exploratory learning or exploitative learning. Future research could explore how network configuration affects different types of knowledge acquisition.
4. **Investigate the impact of network configuration on innovation performance.** The study suggests that network configuration can affect knowledge acquisition performance, which is a precursor to innovation performance. However, it is unclear how network configuration directly affects innovation performance. Future research could investigate the impact of network configuration on innovation performance.
5. **Examine the effects of network configuration on organizational ambidexterity.** The study suggests that network configuration can help organizations achieve ambidexterity, or the ability to balance exploration and exploitation. However, it is unclear how network configuration affects organizational ambidexterity. Future research could investigate the effects of network configuration on organizational ambidexterity.
