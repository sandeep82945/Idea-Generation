    "abstractText": "Starting with a gentle approach to the Alday\u2013Gaiotto\u2013Tachikawa (AGT) correspondence from its 6d origin, these notes provide a wide (albeit shallow) survey of the literature on numerous extensions of the correspondence up to early 2020. This is an extended writeup of the lectures given at the Winter School \u201cYRISW 2020\u201d to appear in a special issue of JPhysA. Class S is a wide class of 4d N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories (ranging from super-QCD to non-Lagrangian theories) obtained by twisted compactification of 6d N = (2, 0) superconformal theories on a Riemann surface C. This 6d construction yields the Coulomb branch and Seiberg\u2013Witten geometry of class S theories, geometrizes S-duality, and leads to the AGT correspondence, which states that many observables of class S theories are equal to 2d conformal field theory (CFT) correlators. For instance, the four-sphere partition function of a 4d N = 2 SU(2) superconformal quiver theory is equal to a Liouville CFT correlator of primary operators. Extensions of the AGT correspondence abound: asymptotically-free gauge theories and Argyres\u2013Douglas theories correspond to irregular CFT operators, quivers with higher-rank gauge groups and non-Lagrangian tinkertoys such as TN correspond to Toda CFT correlators, and nonlocal operators (Wilson\u2013\u2019t Hooft loops, surface operators, domain walls) correspond to Verlinde networks, degenerate primary operators, braiding and fusion kernels, and Riemann surfaces with boundaries. \u2217CNRS, Laboratoire de Physique Th\u00e9orique et Hautes Energies, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Paris, France 1 ar X iv :2 00 6. 14 02 5v 3 [ he pth ] 6 A pr 2 02 2",

            "text": "Quantum field theories (QFTs) arise from many different constructions, be it Lagrangian descriptions, dimensional reduction or geometric engineering. The resulting building blocks can then be further deformed (e.g. partially Higgsed), coupled (e.g. by gauging symmetries), or reduced by decoupling a subsector. Theories living in different dimensions can also be fruitfully coupled together.\nWe explore these constructions, and some computation techniques, in the world of 4d N = 2 supersymmetric theories, specifically class S theories [1] which are dimensional reduction of a 6d theory (\u201cS\u201d stands for \u201cSix\u201d). Class S includes the most commonly studied 4d N = 2 Lagrangian gauge theories (super-Yang\u2013Mills (SYM), super-QCD (SQCD), quiver gauge theories, N = 4 SYM and its mass deformation) and non-Lagrangian ones such as Argyres\u2013Douglas (AD) theories [2], but also a plethora of previously unknown ones that have considerably broadened the set of known 4d N = 2 theories.\nTo construct a class S theory we start from a 6d N = (2, 0) superconformal field theory (SCFT) denoted by X (g), which is characterized by a simply-laced1 Lie algebra g, for instance su(N). We then reduce X (g) on a Riemann surface C called the ultraviolet (UV) curve2, while preserving 4d N = 2 supersymmetry thanks to a procedure called partial topological twist. The Riemann surface can have punctures (removed points, so that C = C \\{z1, . . . , zn} with C being compact) at which boundary conditions must be prescribed. Each choice of punctured Riemann surface, and data Di describing the boundary condition at zi, leads to one 4d N = 2 class S theory T(g, C,D).\nDue to their 6d origin, nonperturbative dynamics of class S theories are encoded in the geometry of C. For example the Seiberg\u2013Witten (SW) curve [3, 4] of a theory, which determines the low-energy effective action in a given Coulomb branch vacuum, is a branched cover of C. Strikingly, this idea extends to many observables of the class S theory. The AGT correspondence [5] concerns the four-sphere (and ellipsoid) partition function:\nZS4 b (T(g, C,D)) =\n\u2329 V\u0302D1(z1) . . . V\u0302Dn(zn) \u232aToda(g) C\n(1.1)\nwhere the right-hand side is a correlator of vertex operators in the Liouville CFT (for g = su(2)) or its generalization, Toda CFT. The vertex operators are inserted at each puncture zi and depend on the data Di characterizing punctures.\nThe rest of the introduction summarizes this review quickly: the reader should feel free to skip to the main text. Sections 2, 3, and 4 (summarized in subsection 1.1) describe the theories T(g, C,D) and the puncture data Di. Sections 5 and 6 (summarized in subsection 1.2) explain how to define and compute both sides of (1.1), namely ZS4\nb and\nLiouville CFT correlators. Finally, sections 7, 8, 9, and 10 describe numerous extensions of the correspondence, with pointers to the literature. In subsection 1.3 we present the preexisting reviews on topics related to AGT.3\n1A simple Lie algebra g is simply-laced if all its roots have the same length. Such algebras have an ADE classification: concretely, g is one of su(N), so(2N), e6, e7, or e8.\n2The two-dimensional Riemann surface C is a complex curve: it has complex dimension 1. 3References (out before January 31, 2020) and comments on more recent developments welcome."

            "text": "In the main text we study the 6d (2, 0) theory X (g) (section 2), its twisted dimensional reductions to class S theories (section 3), and Lagrangian descriptions of some of these 4d N = 2 theories (section 4). Here we only give some outcomes of these discussions. We often reduce to g = su(N) for simplicity, but extensions to g = so(2N) are also well-understood [6, 7].\nBuilding blocks for T(g, C,D). A Riemann surface C of genus g with n punctures can be cut into 2g \u2212 2 + n three-punctured spheres, also called trinions or pairs of pants4 glued together by tubes that connect pairs of punctures. Such a description is often called a pants decomposition of C. Correspondingly, the general class S theory T(g, C,D) can be decomposed into class S theories called tinkertoys that correspond to each three-punctured sphere (tinkertoys range in complexity from free hypermultiplets to previously unknown non-Lagrangian isolated SCFTs). Each puncture is associated to a flavour symmetry, and connecting two punctures by a tube amounts to identifying the two associated flavour symmetries and gauging them using the same 4d N = 2 vector multiplet. For instance a four-punctured sphere can be split into two three-punctured spheres (for suitable groups G1, . . . , G5):\nT (\nG1\nG2 G3\nG4\n) = T ( G1 G2\nG5\n) \u2297 gauge G5 T ( G5\nG3\nG4\n) . (1.2)\nIn simple cases where tinkertoys are collections of hypermultiplets, this results in gauge theories with an explicit Lagrangian made of hypermultiplets and vector multiplets. Thanks to the partial topological twist, the 4d theory does not depend on the metric of C [8, 9] but only on the complex structure of C, which can be described by the \u201clength\u201d and \u201cangle\u201d of each tube. These two parameters control the complexified gauge coupling (q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 with \u03c4 = \u03b82\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i g2 ) that combines the Yang\u2013Mills coupling g with the theta angle \u03b8 of the 4d vector multiplet corresponding to the tube. Weak coupling g \u2192 0 corresponds to a very long tube.\nOf course, C can be decomposed in many ways into three-punctured spheres: correspondingly, T(g, C,D) has many equivalent dual descriptions involving completely different sets of fields and gauge groups. The weak gauge coupling regime of these descriptions correspond to regimes where the complex structure on C is well-described by one pants decomposition where three-punctured spheres are joined by very long tubes. These regimes, which are different cusps of the space of complex structures on C, are continuously connected by varying the gauge couplings. In this way, gauge theories at strong coupling in one description may admit a different weakly-coupled description. This phenomenon [1] generalizes S-duality of the SU(2) Nf = 4 theory and of N = 4 SYM. The 6d construction thus makes these S-dualities manifest through C.\n4That number is zero or negative for the sphere with 0, 1 or 2 punctures and the torus with no punctures: these Riemann surfaces cannot be cut into three-punctured spheres, and the class S construction does not give a 4d theory, see [8].\nIn the 6d construction, the punctures at zi \u2208 C are codimension 2 defects that wrap the 4d spacetime on which the class S theory is defined. To preserve supersymmetry of the 4d theory the defects should be half-BPS, namely preserve half of the original supersymmetry. One must classify such defects (typically by moving along the Coulomb branch), and then the tinkertoys corresponding to three-punctured spheres. Incidentally, the 6d theory also admits interesting half-BPS codimension 4 operators supported on 2d subspaces, which enrich the correspondence.\nCoulomb branch and Seiberg\u2013Witten curve. One way to get a handle on the theory T(g, C,D) is to describe its supersymmetric vacua, especially its Coulomb branch, and give the low-energy behaviour of the theory near each vacuum. This branch is spanned by Coulomb branch operators, namely local operators annihilated by all 4d antichiral supercharges.\nSemiclassically, vacua of the 6d (2, 0) theory X (g) are parametrized modulo gauge transformations by some (commuting, diagonalizable) adjoint-valued scalars \u03a6I , where I = 6, . . . , 10 is an index for the so(5) R-symmetry5. Alternatively they are parametrized by (consistent) values for gauge-invariant polynomials (Casimirs) such as Tr(\u03a6I\u03a6J). Coulomb branch vacua of the 4d theory are then configurations of the \u03a6I (or rather of the invariant polynomials) allowed to vary along the curve C. More precisely, tracking down how 4d N = 2 antichiral supercharges embed into 6d N = (2, 0), we find two restrictions: the Casimirs depend holomorphically on the coordinate z \u2208 C, and among all the \u03a6I only \u03a6z := \u03a66 + i\u03a67 is non-zero. Because the partial topological twist mixes a subalgebra so(2) of R-symmetry (under which \u03a6z is charged) into the rotation group on C, \u03a6zdz is tensorial (specifically a one-form) on C. Roughly speaking, then, the 4d Coulomb branch is parametrized by the adjoint-valued holomorphic one-form \u03a6zdz on C modulo gauge transformations, and more invariantly by vacuum expectation values (VEVs) \u3008Pk(\u03a6z)\u3009dzk of Casimir polynomials.\nIn the g = su(N) case we repackage them as \u03c6k(z) = uk(z)dzk, k = 2, . . . , N , defined in local coordinates z \u2208 C by expanding\n\u3008det(x\u2212 \u03a6z)\u3009 = xN + N\u2211 k=2 uk(z)xN\u2212k. (1.3)\nIt is then useful to consider the zeros of this determinant\n\u03a3 = { (z, x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 xN + N\u2211\nk=2 uk(z)xN\u2212k = 0\n} \u2282 T \u2217C, (1.4)\nwhere z is a coordinate on C and x parametrizes the fiber of the cotangent bundle T \u2217C, the bundle of one-forms6 on C. The complex curve \u03a3 depends on the choice of vacuum (specified by \u03c62, . . . , \u03c6N ) and turns out to be the SW curve of T(g, C,D), presented as an N -fold (ramified) cover of C.

A puncture at zi \u2208 C is described in this language as a singularity of the gauge-invariants \u03c6k. An important example is the full tame puncture which imposes a first order pole \u03a6z \u223c mi(z \u2212 zi)\u22121dz + O(1) at zi, up to conjugation, where the residue mi \u2208 gC is a suitably generic element of the complexification gC of g. This mass8 parameter mi can be understood as a constant value for the background vector multiplet scalar that couples to the flavour symmetry g corresponding to the puncture at zi. In gauge-invariant terms this first order pole translates to\n\u3008Pk(\u03a6z)\u3009 = Pk(mi)\n(z \u2212 zi)k + . . . , (1.5)\nor equivalently \u03c6k \u221d dzk/(z \u2212 zi)k + . . . with a leading-order coefficient determined from mi, using (1.3) in the su(N) case.\nIn fact, when C gets pinched and split into two in the limit where a tube becomes infinitely thin, this type of singularity generically occurs. The main building block of class S theories is thus the tinkertoy Tg, namely the theory associated to a sphere with three full tame punctures. A frequent notation is TN := Tsu(N). By matching SW curves and SW differentials of T(su(2), C,D) theories to previously known theories such as SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD, one checks that T2 is simply a collection of 4 free hypermultiplets [1]. In general, however, the theory Tg is a non-Lagrangian theory, with (at least) one flavour symmetry g for each puncture. For instance, Tsu(3) is the Minahan\u2013Nemeschansky SCFT with flavour symmetry e6 \u2283 su(3)3.\nThere are more general tame punctures, defined as points where one imposes a first order pole of \u03a6z with a residue m that may be non-generic. The resulting tinkertoys amount to a partial Higgsing: moving onto the Higgs branch of Tg by turning on a nilpotent VEV for (the moment map of) the symmetry carried by the puncture, thus reducing the symmetry. For su(N) they are characterized by the pattern of equal eigenvalues of m, encoded as a partition of N , and they lead to lower-order poles for the \u03c6k. The partition for a full tame puncture is N = 1+1+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+1, also denoted by [1N ]; it carries su(N) flavour symmetry (broken explicitly by the mass m). At the other extreme, the puncture corresponding to the partition [N ] (all eigenvalues equal, hence vanishing) is a trivial absence of puncture since it is a pole with zero residue. The next \u201csmallest\u201d puncture, called a simple tame puncture corresponds to the partition [N \u2212 1, 1] so m = diag(m1, . . . ,m1,\u2212(N \u2212 1)m1); it carries u(1) flavour symmetry, enhanced to su(2) for N = 2 since in that case the simple and full punctures are identical. Both the full and the simple tame punctures appear in the class S description of SU(N) Nf = 2N SQCD, as depicted in Figure 1.\n7Equation (1.4) is often reformulated as \u03bbN + \u2211N\nk=2 \u03c6k(z)\u03bb N\u2212k = 0.\n8For su(N), the N eigenvalues of mi give residues of \u03bb at each of the N points of \u03a3 projecting to zi. Integrating \u03bb to compute masses of BPS particles picks up such residues, which are thus mass parameters.\nWhile the gauge algebra carried by each tube is g when all punctures are full tame punctures, more general tame punctures may lead to smaller gauge algebras. For example, su(N) class S includes linear quiver gauge theories with gauge group \u220fi SU(Ni) (with Ni \u2264 N), one hypermultiplet in each bifundamental representation Ni \u2297 Ni+1, and Mi \u2264 2Ni \u2212 Ni\u22121 \u2212 Ni+1 hypermultiplets9 in fundamental representations Ni of each SU(Ni). This is summarized in the quiver diagram\nSU(N1) SU(N2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 SU(Np)\nM1 M2 Mp (1.6)\n1.2 Basic AGT correspondence\nWe summarize here two sections that build up to the full AGT correspondence. First, section 5 describes how the (squashed) sphere partition function ZS4\nb of quiver gauge\ntheories is computed using supersymmetric localization, and especially the issue of instanton counting. Then, section 6 explains basic aspects of Liouville CFT and gives the precise statement of the AGT correspondence for g = su(2) generalized quivers.\nSupersymmetric localization. In section 5 we explain how to place class S theories on the (squashed) four-sphere S4b := {y25 + b2(y21 + y22) + b\u22122(y23 + y24) = r2} \u2282 R5 supersymmetrically, which incidentally requires masses to be purely imaginary. We also explain how to evaluate the partition function on this ellipsoid using supersymmetric localization [10, 11]. This path integral technique applies to each 4d N = 2 Lagrangian description of T(g, C,D)\u2014if such a description exists.10 Supersymmetric localization can\n9When this bound is saturated the gauge coupling of that group does not run. When it is obeyed but not saturated (so Mi < 2Ni \u2212Ni\u22121 \u2212Ni+1) we get an asymptotically free gauge theory, which can be realized in class S using wild punctures. When the bound is violated instead, the theory is only an effective theory and does not have a class S construction.\n10Factorization properties of ZS4 b that we find upon cutting the Riemann surface also hold for nonLagrangian class S theories. They are obtained by applying supersymmetric localization to the vector\nreduce the infinite-dimensional path integral down to a finite-dimensional integral over supersymmetric configurations of the hypermultiplets and vector multiplets. One finds configurations labeled by the (purely imaginary) constant value a of a vector multiplet scalar, which can be gauge-fixed to lie in the Cartan subalgebra of the gauge algebras. These configurations are additionally dressed by point-like instantons at one pole (y5 = r) and anti-instantons at the other pole (y5 = \u2212r) of S4b . The partition function then reads\nZS4 b (q, q) =\n\u222b daZcl(a, q, q)Zone-loop(a)Zinst(a, q)Zinst(a, q), (1.7)\nwhere we omit the dependence on g and data D at the punctures but write explicitly the dependence on complex structure parameters q of the curve C. Here, Zcl comes from the classical action of supersymmetric configurations; it depends non-holomorphically on the complex gauge couplings q, but factorizes as Zcl(a, q, q) = Zcl\u2032(a, q)Zcl\u2032(a, q). Quadratic fluctuations around these configurations yield Zone-loop(a), a straightforward product of special functions that is completely independent of the shape (complex structure) of C. Finally, (anti)-instantons at each pole bring a factor of Zinst that depends (anti)-holomorphically on gauge couplings q.\nThe factor Zinst(a, q) = \u2211 k\u22650 q\nkZinst,k(a) = 1+O(q1) is Nekrasov\u2019s instanton partition function [12, 13] with parameters 1 = b/r, 2 = 1/(rb), computable in favourable cases. The main difficulty is to compute each k-instanton contribution Zinst,k(a), which is an integral over the k-instanton moduli space. This space is finite-dimensional but very singular, and its singularities are understood best for unitary gauge groups. For linear quivers of unitary groups, which are obtained from (1.6) by replacing all SU(Ni) gauge groups by U(Ni), the Nekrasov partition function can be determined by equivariant localization or through IIA brane constructions. The instanton partition function of the SU theories (1.6) that we care about can then be derived by an appropriate decoupling of the U(1) factors, which divides Zinst(a, q) by simple factors such as powers of (1\u2212 q) [5]. Various other methods have been devised, but there is as of yet no complete first principles derivation of Zinst for general class S theories, and even when restricting to g = su(2) with tame punctures.11\nS-dual Lagrangian descriptions of the same theory, obtained by different pants decompositions of C, should have the same partition function if S-duality is to hold. The equality of explicit integral expressions (1.7) is extremely challenging to prove, even for the SU(2) Nf = 4 theory. In fact the easiest way I know is to derive the AGT correspondence in that case (e.g. [14]) and then rely on modularity properties on the 2d CFT side shown in [15\u201317].\nLiouville CFT correlators and basic AGT correspondence. In section 6 we move on to the other side of the correspondence for g = su(2), namely Liouville CFT correlators. Liouville CFT depends on a \u201cbackground charge\u201d Q = b+ 1/b \u2265 2 (the central charge is c = 1 + 6Q2 \u2265 25), which translates on the 4d side to a deformation parameter of S4 into\nmultiplets only, and not to the tinkertoys. 11I thank Jaewon Song for clarifications on this point.\nthe ellipsoid S4b . As in any 2d CFT, local operators organize into conformal families constructed by acting with the Virasoro algebra on primary operators. In the Liouville CFT these primaries are the vertex operators V\u0302\u03b1, labeled by a continuous parameter \u03b1 = Q/2 + iP with P \u2208 R/Z2 (called momentum), and they have equal holomorphic and antiholomorphic dimension h(\u03b1) = \u03b1(Q \u2212 \u03b1) = Q2/4 + P 2. In the su(2) case the data Dj for each tame puncture reduces to specifying a mass mj \u2208 iR/Z2 (imaginary), naturally identified with a Liouville momentum (up to the sphere\u2019s radius r): the AGT correspondence then states\nZS4 b\n( T(su(2), C,m) ) = \u2329 V\u0302Q/2+rm1(z1) . . . V\u0302Q/2+rmn(zn) \u232aLiouville C . (1.8)\nAs in any 2d CFT, n-point functions of Virasoro primary operators on the Riemann surface C have a useful expression for each pants decomposition of the punctured Riemann surface C. The idea is to insert a complete set of states along each cut in the decomposition, then use Virasoro symmetry to rewrite all resulting three-point functions in terms of those of primaries. Schematically this gives\u2329\nV\u0302\u00b51(z1, z\u03041) . . . V\u0302\u00b5n(zn, z\u0304n) \u232aLiouville C = \u222b d\u03b1C(\u00b5, \u03b1)F(\u00b5, \u03b1, q)F(\u00b5, \u03b1, q). (1.9)\nHere we integrate over all internal momenta \u03b1 labelling the conformal family in each inserted complete set of states. The factor C(\u00b5, \u03b1) is a combination of structure constants of Liouville CFT. The other two factors are conformal blocks, which are purely about representation theory of the Virasoro algebra, and which depend (anti)-holomorphically on the complex structure parameters q of C, including (cross-ratios of) zi.\nBoth sides of the AGT correspondence admit the same kind of expressions (1.7) and (1.9) for each pants decomposition of C, with one integration variable a or \u03b1 for each tube, and a factorization of the dependence on q into holomorphic and antiholomorphic. In fact these expressions match factor by factor: Zone-loop(m, a) = C(\u00b5, \u03b1) and Zcl\u2032(a, q)Zinst(m, a, q) = F(\u00b5, \u03b1, q). An additional entry in the dictionary is that \u03c62 on the 4d side corresponds to the holomorphic stress-tensor T (z) on the Liouville side in the classical limit r \u2192 \u221e: the leading term in an operator product expansion (OPE) with T (z) matches r2\u03c62(z),\nT (z)V\u0302\u00b5(0) = h(\u00b5)V\u0302\u00b5(0)\nz2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ' r\u2192\u221e \u2212r\n2m2 z2 V\u0302\u00b5(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ' \u2212r2\u03c62(z)V\u0302\u00b5(0) + . . . . (1.10)\nWe end section 6 by outlining the technical derivation of how Liouville CFT appears upon reducing the 6d theory on S4 [18].\nExtensions of the AGT correspondence. The AGT correspondence is generalized in two ways in section 7. First, asymptotically free theories and AD theories are described by replacing tame punctures by wild punctures, which replaces primary vertex operators by irregular ones on the CFT side. Second, su(2) is replaced by g = su(N): hypermultiplets are then replaced by non-Lagrangian building blocks TN and Liouville CFT by Toda CFT.\nIn section 8 we investigate how to include in the AGT correspondence various gauge theory operators (local operators, Wilson\u2013\u2019t Hooft loops, . . . ). The CFT side features Verlinde loops, degenerate vertex operators, fusion and braiding kernels, and Riemann surfaces with boundaries. The dictionary and references are summarized in Table 1.\nTable 1: AGT correspondence for extended operators, sorted by codimension of the 6d operator or orbifold that yields them, and sorted by dimension on the 4d side.

Placing the 6d theory onto other product spaces M \u00d7 C (with some twist) leads to interesting relations between theories on M and on C: the index/qYang\u2013Mills (YM) correspondence [110], the 3d/3d correspondence [111], the 2d/4d correspondence [112]. In another direction, some class S theories (especially linear quiver gauge theories) can be realized as reductions of 5d N = 1 theories. Instanton partition functions have direct analogues in 5d as certain q-deformations of the 4d results. This leads to a q-deformed AGT correspondence [113] equating these 5d instanton partition functions to chiral correlators (\u201cconformal blocks\u201d) of q-deformed Virasoro orWN algebras. The S5 partition function involves three instanton partition functions, and its proper translation to non-chiral correlators of a complete q-Toda theory is still under investigation [114]. We end in section 10 with a quick outline of many topics omitted in this review, such as matrix models, topological strings, quantum integrable systems, etc."

I particularly recommend Tachikawa\u2019s very clear collection of reviews [115\u2013118].\n\u2022 6d (2, 0) SCFTs. These theories, and more generally 6d (1, 0) SCFT, are reviewed in [119] from an F-theory perspective. For codimension 2 defects, which are central in the AGT correspondence, see [120].\n\u2022 4d N = 2 and Seiberg\u2013Witten. While there are nice introductions from the late 1990\u2019s [121, 122] to the SW solution of 4d N = 2 theories, I recommend more modern explanations such as Martone\u2019s notes in this school [123], and the well-known review \u201cfor pedestrians\u201d [115] which covers a lot of ground, including how AD theories arise from limits of SQCD. The book [124] discusses many modern relations between 4d N = 2 theories and other topics. The review [117] is focussed on the very important non-Lagrangian 4d N = 2 theory TN .\n\u2022 Localization and instanton counting. Supersymmetric localization is reviewed in the book [125], and in particular the squashed four-sphere partition function in [126]. Its expression involves Nekrasov\u2019s instanton partition function, for which a good starting point is [116], followed by [127] which discusses all gauge groups, subtleties regarding the U(1) factor, and the choice of renormalization scheme.\n\u2022 Toda CFT and W-algebras.12 Liouville CFT is reviewed in [128, 129] among many others, and it is worth reading [130] for some subtleties. There are no recent reviews on Toda CFT or on W-algebras. For W-algebras see the old [131, 132] (and possibly [133]) or the truncations of W1+\u221e in [134, 135]. For Toda CFT perhaps the early article [136] or my thesis [137]13.\n\u2022 AGT for physicists. See [118] (or perhaps [138], in Japanese) for a brief review, and the longer [139] ranging from SW basics to AD theories arising from degenerations of SQCD. The matrix model approach to AGT is reviewed in [140, 141].\n\u2022 AGT for mathematicians. Possible starting points for mathematicians include the introductory seminar notes [142], a \u201cpseudo-mathematical pseudo-review\u201d [143, 144], incomplete (nevertheless 200 pages long) lecture notes [145], a categorical version of the correspondence [146], a review that focuses on moduli spaces of flat connections [147] and one discussing instanton counting on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces [148]. There are also notes on mathematical applications of the 6d (2, 0) SCFT to geometric representation theory, symplectic duality, knot homology, and Hitchin systems [149].\n\u2022 Generalizations of AGT. These include the 3d/3d correspondence reviewed in [150] and the AGT relation between 5d N = 1 gauge theories and q-Toda correlators in [151].\nGiven these numerous reviews, writing yet another set of notes is perhaps futile, but hopefully the rather different approach taken here, starting from the 6d theory,\n12I thank Ioana Coman for pointers. 13Better reference very welcome: only the AN\u22121 case is considered there, and only full, simple, and\ndegenerate punctures rather than general tame punctured labeled by partitions of N .\nis the right one for some readers. I apologize for omitting many directions from this review, listed in the conclusion section 10, especially a broader discussion of the BPS/CFT correspondence and of the deep links to quantization of integrable models underlying SW geometry, matrix models, and topological strings.\nPart I\nClass S theories 2 6d (2, 0) SCFT of ADE type Superconformal algebras exist in dimensions up to 6, and there is by now ample evidence for the existence of 6d N = (2, 0) (maximally supersymmetric) SCFTs X (g), labelled by a Lie algebra g that is simply-laced14,15. Nobody knows how to actually define X (g) directly in a QFT language, for instance through a Lagrangian formulation. It is instead obtained as a decoupling limit of certain string theory or M-theory brane setups.\nProperties of X (g)\n\u2022 X (g) has vacua whose infra-red (IR) description is an abelian 6d (2, 0) theory of self-dual two-form gauge fields valued in the Cartan algebra of g modulo the Weyl group. \u2022 X (g) is a UV-completion of 5d N = 2 SYM in the sense that SYM with gauge algebra g and gauge coupling g5d gives an IR description of X (g) compactified on a circle of radius g25d. \u2022 X (g) admits codimension 2 half-BPS defects labeled by nilpotent orbits in g, and codimension 4 half-BPS defects labeled by representations of g.\nDespite its stringy construction, the theory is expected to be a bona-fide local QFT, for instance having a local conserved stress-tensor.16 These constructions entail three important properties detailed to the right.\nThe first two properties are compatible because both 5d N = 2 SYM on its Coulomb branch, and the abelian 6d theory on a circle, are described by 5d abelian vector multiplets in the Cartan of g. The last property is compatible as well, as the defects have rather explicit descriptions when one moves along the Coulomb branch or when one places the theory on a circle. The existence of X (g) with these properties is confirmed by many consistency checks involving better-understood theories. A major set of consistency checks is the AGT correspondence obtained by placing these theories on the product M4 \u00d7 C2 of a 4d and a 2d manifolds.\n14As a reminder, simply-laced Lie algebras are aN\u22121 = su(N), so(2N) = dN , and the three exceptional algebras e6, e7, e8 (in each case the subscript is the rank). This ADE classification has several beautiful avatars in theoretical physics but we will not get to explore them in this review.\n15While different constructions of X (g) give the same condition that g is simply-laced, including some field theoretic arguments [152], it has not been proven that X (g) exhaust all 6d N = (2, 0) SCFTs. The situation is the same in 4d N = 4 SCFT: there might possibly be such theories other than N = 4 SYM theories.\n16To be precise, it is a relative quantum field theory [153].\nIn this section we describe the symmetry algebra osp(8\u2217|4) (subsection 2.1), properties of self-dual two-form gauge fields (subsection 2.2), string/M-theory constructions (subsection 2.3) and extended operators (subsection 2.4) of X (g)."

Their even (bosonic) part consists of the conformal algebra so(2, d) (in Lorentzian signature) and an R-symmetry algebra, and their odd (fermionic) part consists of supercharges that must transform in the spinor representation of so(2, d), and such that translations are realized as anticommutators of supercharges.\nThe classification is in Table 2. In dimensions d = 3, 4, 6 the conformal algebra coincides with the expected so(2, d) thanks to accidental isomorphisms17 so(2, 3) = sp(4,R) and so(2, 4) = su(2, 2) and so(2, 6) = so\u2217(8). In each case, the spinor representation of so(2, d) is the fundamental (vector) representation of the other group. It is known that SCFTs with more than 16 Poincar\u00e9 supercharges do not exist for d \u2265 4 (and are free for d = 3) [155], and this leads to the bounds on N given in the table.\nFor the 6d case of interest to us, minimal spinor representation of the Lorentz algebra so(2, 6) are chiral, and the superconformal algebras contain N = 1 or 2 such chiral spinors (technically, symplectic Majorana\u2013Weyl spinors) with the same chirality. These algebras are thus called 6d N = (1, 0) and 6d N = (2, 0) superconformal algebras. There is no 6d N = (1, 1) superconformal algebra.

When ambiguities arise there are standard decorations to distinguish them, such as overlines for conjugating the representation, or primes when there are several irreps of the same dimension and they are not related by conjugation. A peculiar example is so(8) and other real forms thereof like so(p, 8\u2212 p) as they have three dimension 8 irreps: the defining representation of so(8) called 8v, and two conjugate\nand R-symmetry algebras so(6, 2)\u00d7 so(5)R, with a reality condition.

In even dimension d there exists an interesting notion of (anti)19 self-dual k-form for k = d/2 \u2212 1: a k-form B with components B\u03b11...\u03b1k (antisymmetric in \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1k) such that the field strength H = dB is mapped to a multiple of itself by the Hodge star, that is,\nH\u03b10\u03b11...\u03b1k := (k + 1)! \u2202[\u03b10B\u03b11...\u03b1k] = \u00b1i d/2+s \u03b10...\u03b1k\u03b20...\u03b2k\u2202 [\u03b20B\u03b21...\u03b2k].

In 2d this happens in Lorentzian signature, and it corresponds to a real scalar field propagating only in one lightlike direction. (In the Euclidean case it is a complex chiral boson depending on one holomorphic coordinate.) In 4d with Euclidean signature, (2.1) defines self-dual gauge field configurations, also called instantons, which play a crucial role on the 4d side of the AGT correspondence.

In 6d with Lorentzian signature we get a real self-dual two-form gauge field B\u03b1\u03b2.\nWe care about 6d (2, 0) supersymmetry, in which case the multiplet containing B\u03b1\u03b2 consists of B, spinors \u03bb, and scalars \u03a6 that transform respectively as the singlet, the 4-dimensional, and the 5-dimensional representations of R-symmetry usp(4) = so(5).\nCompactifying on a circle. Let us place this 6d (2, 0) abelian theory of (B, \u03bb,\u03a6) on a circle and decompose into Kaluza\u2013Klein (KK) modes. As determined in the following exercise, the five scalars \u03a6I remain scalars, the spinors \u03bb as well, and the self-dual two-form gauge field B becomes a usual gauge field A in 5d. Altogether this gives abelian 5d N = 2 SYM.\nWe review dimensional reduction in Exercise 2.1 below. An important aspect for the reduction from X (g) to 5d is that 5d SYM has instanton particles, namely gauge field configurations with non-trivial topological number \u222b \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F\u00b5\u03bdF\u03c1\u03c3d4x on each spatial slice.\nspinor representations 8s and 8c, related by the triality automorphism of so(8). 19Self-dual and anti-self-dual cases differ by a sign, and we shall just write \u201cself-dual\u201d for simplicity.\nThese excitations of the gauge field A play the role of the tower of KK modes: their mass (proportional to) 1/g25d is correctly identified with the mass 1/R of KK modes. Exercise 2.1. 1. Consider a D-dimensional scalar field \u03d5, with Lagrangian L(\u03d5) = \u2202\u03b1\u03d5\u2202\n\u03b1\u03d5 \u2212 V (\u03d5) (you can take V = 0 for simplicity). Consider it on a d-dimensional Minkowski space times a (D \u2212 d)-dimensional torus of radius R (you can take D \u2212 d = 1 for simplicity). Write a Fourier decomposition of \u03d5 along the circle direction and rewrite the action of \u03d5 as an action for these components. In the limit R \u2192 0 notice that all Fourier modes become infinitely massive except the zero mode.\n2. Repeat the exercise for an abelian vector field A\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0, . . . , D \u2212 1) with Lagrangian F\u03b1\u03b2F\u03b1\u03b2 , where F\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2202\u03b1A\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03b2A\u03b1. Check that the dimensionally-reduced theory has both a vector field A\u00b5 (\u00b5 = 0, . . . , d\u2212 1) and D \u2212 d scalar fields. These can be gauge-invariantly understood for finite R as Wilson loops of A\u03b1 around coordinate circles of the torus. How do D-dimensional gauge transformations act? Deduce that the scalar fields are circle-valued.\n3. Repeat the exercise for a two-form B\u03b1\u03b2 reduced from 6d to 5d. This results in a two-form B\u00b5\u03bd and a one-form A\u00b5. By imposing the self-duality condition on B\u03b1\u03b2 find that B\u00b5\u03bd can be reconstructed (up to gauge transformations) from A\u00b5.\nNonabelian theory. Recall the Bianchi identity \u2202[\u00b5F\u03bd\u03c1] = 0 in 4d. It generalizes to dH = ddB = 0. For a self-dual form this implies the free equations of motion d ? dB = 0, namely \u2202\u00b5H\u00b5\u03bd... = 0. How can we add interactions? In 4d, the equation F\u00b5\u03bd = \u221312 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F \u03c1\u03c3 defining instantons makes sense even for the field strength of nonabelian gauge fields, F = dA + A \u2227 A, explicitly F\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdA\u00b5 + [A\u00b5, A\u03bd ]. The non-abelian version of the Bianchi identity is \u03bb\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1D\u00b5F\u03bd\u03c1 = 0. When the gauge field configuration is self-dual this implies the standard Yang\u2013Mills equations of motion D\u00b5F\n\u00b5\u03bb = 0. In contrast, for other self-dual k-forms, k 6= 1, there is no obvious nonabelian generalization of the relation H = dB, hence no obvious way to introduce interactions. Instead, we use two stringy constructions."

(There also exist analogous 6d (1, 1) little string theories, but they have no conformal limit so we do not discuss them further.)

We begin with the M-theory (or equivalently IIA) construction, applicable to g = su(N): X (su(N)) is the world-volume theory of a stack of N coincident M5 branes in M-theory, with the decoupled center of mass degrees of freedom removed.\nM-theory is an 11 dimensional theory (Lorentzian signature) with 32 supersymmetries (one Majorana spinor). It is related by various dualities to better-understood string theories and supergravity, for instance its low-energy limit is described by 11-dimensional supergravity. For our purposes, the most interesting aspect is that M-theory on a circle times a 10-dimensional spacetime is equivalent to IIA strings on that spacetime. The aim of this review is not to discuss the intricate web of dualities relating M-theory to IIA and other string theories, so we are quite schematic.\nA standard comment on terminology: p branes are (p + 1) dimensional objects, with p space and 1 time directions, so for instance the M5 brane is 6-dimensional and has Lorentzian signature, as we wanted. M-theory has two such half-BPS objects: the M5 brane and the M2 brane. Stacks of flat22 parallel branes of the same type preserve the same half of supersymmetry (see Exercise 2.2), and there is no energy cost to moving the branes while keeping them flat and parallel. While the world-volume theory of a stack of N Dp branes has been known for a long time to be maximally supersymmetric SYM in p + 1 dimensions (see the review [161]), the world-volume theory of stacks of branes in M-theory has proven more difficult to pin down.\n\u2022 The world-volume theory of a stack of coincident M2 branes is now known23 to be the Aharony\u2013Bergman\u2013Jafferis\u2013Maldacena (ABJM) Chern\u2013Simons matter theory, an SCFT with an explicit 3d N = 2 Lagrangian description, whose supersymmetry enhances to the expected 3d N = 8 superconformal algebra osp(8|4) preserved by the branes (see the review [162]).

The tensor branch and Higgs branch are vacua where scalar fields in tensor or hyper multiplets acquire a VEV (with (2, 0) supersymmetry the two branches combine). The tensor branch is sometimes called Coulomb branch because it reduces to Coulomb branches in 5d and 4d. In 6d N = (1, 0) theories one also has vector multiplets but they contain no scalars so there is no corresponding branch.\n22Here we work as if spacetime were flat; the backreaction of branes on the geometry does not invalidate the conclusions.\n23Depending on one\u2019s point of view, most words \u201cknown\u201d in this review should be replaced by \u201cconjectured\u201d. Ultimately, since the path integral has not been properly defined in most cases of interest to physicists, almost all non-perturbative QFT results are conjectural. One can think about how much \u201cevidence\u201d there is for one result or another. Results that are consistent with many others should then serve as a guide to determine if a given mathematical definition of the theories is acceptable.\nspace around the M2 branes. Its holographic dual is AdS4\u00d7S7. That is all we will say in this review.\n\u2022 The world-volume theory of a stack of N coincident M5 branes is what we call X (su(N)), a 6d (2, 0) SCFT with no Lagrangian description.24 More precisely, this would give u(N), but the u(1) center of mass of the branes decouples. The R-symmetry so(5) rotates space around the M5 branes. The holographic dual is AdS7\u00d7S4, which has the expected symmetry algebra osp(8\u2217|4), differing only from the 3d case by some signs in the 7d and 4d parts.\nConsequences of the M-theory construction. Consider now X (su(N)) on a circle (times five-dimensional Minkowski space). M-theory on a circle is equivalent to IIA string theory, and M5 branes wrapping the circle become D4 branes. Thus, X (su(N)) on a circle is equivalent to the world-volume theory of N D4 branes, which is 5d N = 2 SYM, as announced at the start of this section 2. Dimensional analysis shows that the 5d gauge coupling scales as g5d \u223c L1/25 in terms of the compactification circle length L5.\nWe move on to describing the vacua of X (g) from its M-theory construction. Supersymmetric vacua are parametrized by the positions of the N M5 branes in the 5 transverse directions, modulo relabelling of the branes since they are indistinguishable. The vacua are thus (RN )5/SN . At any generic vacuum, all degrees of freedom are massive (with mass proportional to the separation between the branes), except fluctuations around each individual brane, which are known to be described by one 6d abelian theory of (B, \u03bb,\u03a6) for each brane. The scalar fields \u03a6I , I = 6, . . . , 10, describe fluctuations of each of the N M5 branes in the transverse directions (except the u(1) trace part).\nIIB strings. The M-theory construction gives a lot of insight on X (g) for g = aN\u22121, and can be extended to dN by orbifolding, but it cannot realize the exceptional cases e6, e7, e8. For this a dual IIB description is needed.\nAs understood in [163], T-duality transverse to a stack of N NS5 branes in IIA theory produces IIB strings on an AN\u22121 singularity. This second construction of the 6d (2, 0) little string theory, which we will not use much, generalizes readily to all ADE cases. Place IIB string theory on Minkowski space R1,5 times a quotient C2/\u0393 by a finite subgroup \u0393 \u2282 SU(2). Such subgroups are classified by ADE Lie algebras g. For instance, the AN\u22121 case is \u0393 = ZN acting as (z, w) 7\u2192 (e2\u03c0i/Nz, e\u22122\u03c0i/Nw) on coordinates of C2. The zero-coupling limit gs \u2192 0 of this set-up yields little string theory, and the further zero-tension limit gives the 6d (2, 0) theory X (g).\nMoving along the vacuum moduli space of the 6d theory corresponds to blowing up C2/\u0393 into ALE space, namely resolving the singularity at the origin of C2/\u0393 into a collection of r = rank g finite-size two-cycles. The sizes of these two-cycles become r scalar fields \u03a6 of the 6d theory on R1,5, in the Cartan subalgebra of g. In fact their VEV parametrizes the vacua of X (g). In any vacuum, the IR degrees of freedom are: these\n24Instead of g = aN\u22121 = su(N) one can realize g = dN = so(2N) by including an O5 orbifold plane on top of the M5 branes.\nscalar fields \u03a6, the two-form B obtained by integrating the chiral four-form of IIB string theory around each of the two-cycles, and some spinors. We end up as wanted with the 6d (2, 0) theory of an abelian self-dual two-form gauge field multiplet (B, \u03bb,\u03a6) in the Cartan subalgebra of g.\nIn this description only SO(4) R-symmetry is manifest, and the reduction to 5d N = 2 SYM is also nontrivial to see."

The prime on M5\u2019 branes just helps us distinguish them from the M5 branes on which X (g) lives. Each additional stack of branes in this table breaks half of supersymmetry (see Exercise 2.2). There can be several stacks of the same kind of branes parallel to each other, in which case they don\u2019t break further supersymmetry.\nThe M2 branes extend only in one direction transverse to the M5 branes. In this direction x10 they can either be infinite, or semi-infinite ending on one M5 brane, or finite stretching between two M5 branes. Either way, from the point of view of X (g), stacks of M2 branes insert a half-BPS codimension 4 operator, namely an operator supported on a two-dimensional slice of the 6d theory [164].\nThe way it is written here, it would seem the M5 and M5\u2019 branes intersect in codimension 2. In truth they turn out to merge into a smooth complex manifold that asymptotes at large distances to the configuration we wrote. For this to happen, the x6, x7 positions of the M5 branes should grow to infinity as x4, x5 get closer to the positions of M5\u2019 branes, as depicted in Figure 2. We return to this in section 4 for concrete cases. From the point of view of X (g), at large distance, the intersection with M5\u2019 branes has an effective description as a four-dimensional (codimension 2) half-BPS operator [165].\nAs we explore the AGT correspondence in this review we learn various properties of these defects, and especially the data that describes them.

Roughly speaking, the number of boxes in each row of the Young diagram indicates how many M2 branes can end on the same M5 brane.\nExercise 2.2.

            "text": "Our aim is to place the 6d (2, 0) theory on R4 \u00d7 C2, where C2 is an arbitrary punctured Riemann surface. Doing this too naively would not preserve any symmetry beyond the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry of R4. We explain a procedure, the partial topological twist, that allows 4d N = 2 supersymmetry to be preserved regardless of C2.\nGeneralities on topological twist. First we comment on the topological twist of supersymmetric theories [166] in general terms from several point of views.\nWhen placing a field theory on a curved background, the metric g\u00b5\u03bd acts as a source for the stress tensor T\u00b5\u03bd . For a supersymmetric field theory, T\u00b5\u03bd typically belongs to a multiplet together with supersymmetry currents S\u00b5\u03b1 and R-symmetry currents J\u00b5. These can also be coupled to sources \u03c8\u03b1\u00b5 and A\u00b5. The partial topological twist consists of setting S\u00b5\u03b1 = 0 and choosing A\u00b5 equal to the spin connection derived from g\u00b5\u03bd . Schematically, at linearized order around some background values of g, \u03c8,A, when these fields are changed the Lagrangian varies by\n\u03b4L = T\u03b4g + J\u03b4A = T\u03b4g \u2212 J\u2202(\u03b4g) ' (T + \u2202J)\u03b4g. (3.1)\nIn the second step we used our choice that A is related to derivatives of the metric, and in the last step we integrate by parts.\nIn this way the topological twist amounts to redefining the stress-tensor from T to Ttwist = T + \u2202J before placing the theory on a non-trivial background metric. The twist mixes the stress-tensor T\u00b5\u03bd with the R-symmetry current J\u00b5, but it is good to remember that it does not affect any observables of the theory in flat space, only what we call the stress-tensor. Through the change of stress-tensor it changes how the theory is put on curved spaces.\nOne job of the stress-tensor is to keep track of Poincar\u00e9 symmetries: T\u00b5\u03bd is the conserved current of translation symmetries, while x[\u00b5T \u03bd]\u03c1 is the conserved current of rotations. Since the twist shifts T by a total derivatives it is simply an improvement transformation of the translation symmetry current, and it does not change the corresponding conserved charge, the momentum operator. In contrast, it has a non-trivial effect on what we call rotations: twisted rotation acts by a rotation plus an R-symmetry transformation, because schematically xT 7\u2192 xT + x\u2202J = xT \u2212 J + \u2202(xJ) where \u2202(xJ) is an improvement transformation. Commutators between translations and the twisted rotations nevertheless coincide with those in the standard Poincar\u00e9 algebra.\nWhat happens to supercharges? They typically transform as spinors under the original rotations and under R-symmetry transformations. Under the new rotations embedded diagonally, the supercharges typically split into a scalar supercharge Q and a vector. By virtue of Q being a scalar, the stress tensor is Q-closed, so that placing the theory on a curved manifold using the twisted stress-tensor preserves the supersymmetry Q. The next step is typically to restrict to operators in the Q-cohomology. In many cases, the twisted stress-tensor is Q-exact, namely T\u00b5\u03bdtwist = {Q,G\u00b5\u03bd} for some supersymmetry generator G\u00b5\u03bd , so that it vanishes in Q-cohomology and the correlators are described\nby a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). For the twist we consider, this will not happen and there will remain non-trivial local dynamics instead.\nPartial topological twist of 6d theories. The partial topological twist we use consists of only mixing some of the R-symmetries into some of the rotation symmetries. To define the specific twist we use, consider rotations so(1, 3) \u00d7 so(2)old preserving separately the two factors of a product R1,3 \u00d7 R2, and consider the block-diagonal subalgebra so(2)R \u00d7 so(3)R \u2282 so(5)R of R-symmetry. We define twisted rotations to be embedded diagonally into so(2)old \u00d7 so(2)R, namely we treat the following symmetries as our (twisted) Lorentz and R-symmetries:\nso(1, 3)\u00d7 so(2)twist \u00d7 so(3)R. (3.2)\nThis is done by changing the stress-tensor to\nT\u00b5\u03bdtwist = T \u00b5\u03bd old + 1 4( \u00b5\u03c1\u2202\u03c1J \u03bd 12 + \u03bd\u03c1\u2202\u03c1J \u00b5 12), (3.3)\nwhere J12 is the R-symmetry rotation generator of so(2)R and \u00b5\u03bd = \u03b4\u00b54 \u03b4\u03bd5 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd5\u03b4 \u00b5 4 is the Levi-Civita tensor on the R2 factor. Exercise 3.1. Check that (3.3) shifts the x4, x5 rotation current x[4T 5]\u00b5 by J12 up to total derivatives (an improvement term), so that the twisted rotation is a combination of rotation and R-symmetry.\nLet us track supersymmetries as we twist and then compactify. Under the so(1, 5) rotations of R1,5 and so(5)R R-symmetry, the Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetries transform in the spinor representation of each, denoted (4,4), with a symplectic reality condition that we hide for simplicity. Each 6d Weyl spinor, namely each representation 4 of so(1, 5) decomposes into a pair of 4d Weyl spinors of opposite chirality (2,1) \u2295 (1,2) under so(1, 3), and these spinors have opposite charges 1/2 and \u22121/2 under so(2)old. Each spinor 4 of so(5) decomposes into two 2 of so(3)R with so(2)R charges \u00b11/2. Altogether we denote this as follows, with subscripts denoting charges under the two so(2) algebras:\n(4,4) = ( (2,1) 1\n2 \u2295 (1,2)\u2212 12\n) \u2297 ( 2 1\n2 \u2295 2\u2212 12 ) = (2,1,2) 1\n2 , 1 2 \u2295 (2,1,2) 1 2 ,\u2212 1 2 \u2295 (1,2,2)\u2212 12 , 12 \u2295 (1,2,2)\u2212 12 ,\u2212 12 .\n(3.4)\nBy construction the charge under so(2)twist is the sum of those under so(2)old and so(2)R. Thus, under the so(1, 3)\u00d7 so(3)R\u00d7 so(2)twist symmetry of R1,5 that we are concentrating on, Poincar\u00e9 supercharges transform as\n(2,1; 2)1 \u2295 (2,1; 2)0 \u2295 (1,2; 2)0 \u2295 (1,2; 2)\u22121. (3.5)\nWe denote them respectively as\nQ\u03b1Az , Q \u03b1A, Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A, Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307Az\u0304 , (3.6)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b1\u0307, A, ranging from 1 to 2, are indices for spinors of so(1, 3) of the two chiralities and spinors of so(3)R, respectively, while z is a complex coordinate on the R2 factor that keeps track of so(2)twist charges \u00b11 of the first and last supercharges Qz, Q\u0304z\u0304.\nThe middle two supercharges Q, Q\u0304 are scalars under so(2)twist rotations, so that deforming the metric on R2 to any curved metric preserves these supercharges. Altogether, upon compactifying on R1,3\u00d7C with the partial topological twist we obtain a system that preserves iso(1, 3) Poincar\u00e9 symmetry, supercharges Q\u03b1A and Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A, and the so(3)R = su(2) R-symmetry. Together these form the 4d N = 2 Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetry algebra.\nIn the limit where C has zero size, we thus obtain a 4d N = 2 theory, generically.25 Twisting (3.3) does not preserve the tracelessness of T , so even though the original 6d rotation symmetry extends to conformal symmetry, this is not the case of the twisted rotation symmetry. In the zero area limit, 4d conformal symmetry can be restored and we get an SCFT unless data at punctures of C carry an intrinsic mass scale."

The special K\u00e4hler manifolds C\u03b1 are parametrized by Coulomb branch operators and the hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds H\u03b1 are parametrized by Higgs branch operators. Higgs branch chiral ring relations for class S theories were explored in [169\u2013172]. Determining all branches as done in [173, 174] for class S theories is in general difficult, so we will concentrate solely on the Coulomb branch (for which H\u03b1 is a point).\nCoulomb branch operators. The vacua of X (g) are parametrized by the VEV of scalar fields \u03a6I , I = 6, . . . , 10, in the Cartan subalgebra of g (modulo the Weyl group). The low-energy theory in a given vacuum is described by fluctuations of these fields as well as spinors \u03bb and a self-dual two-form B. Under the ( so(1, 3)\u00d7 so(3)R ) \u00d7 so(2)old\u00d7 so(2)R\n25The system at finite area of C has a certain moduli space of vacua, and in the scaling limit where the area is sent to zero one must specify around which vacuum to expand. If C has \u201cenough\u201d handles or punctures, then its Higgs branch has a maximally symmetric point around which it is natural to expand, and the 4d N = 2 limit is well-defined. If C is a sphere with \u201ctoo few punctures\u201d or is a torus without punctures, there is no maximally symmetric point and the situation is more subtle, as explained in [8].\nsymmetry algebra of interest to us just before the twist, these fields transform as\nB \u2208 (3,1,1)0,0 \u2295 (1,3,1)0,0 \u2295 (2,2,1)\u00b11,0 \u2295 (1,1,1)0,0, \u03bb \u2208 (2,1,2) 1\n2 ,\u00b1 1 2 \u2295 (1,2,2)\u2212 12 ,\u00b1 12 , \u03a6z := \u03a66 + i\u03a67 \u2208 (1,1,1)0,1, \u03a68,\u03a69,\u03a610 \u2208 (1,1,3)0,0, \u03a6z\u0304 := \u03a66 \u2212 i\u03a67 \u2208 (1,1,1)0,\u22121. (3.7)\nOn the other hand the supercharges Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A transform as (1,2,2)\u22121/2,1/2. We deduce that\nQ\u0304\u03b1\u0307A\u03a6z = 0 (3.8)\nbecause no component of \u03bb has the appropriate so(2)R charge 3/2. Really, we should be working with the corresponding gauge-invariant operators, such as traces Tr(\u03a6jz) in classical cases su(N) and so(2N). These are the Casimirs of g, polynomials Pk(\u03a6z) of various degrees dk for k = 1, . . . , rank g. Concretely, for classical gauge groups these gauge-invariant operators annihilated by Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A are\nTr(\u03a6jz), j = 2, 3, 4, . . . , N for su(N), Tr(\u03a6jz), j = 2, 4, 6, . . . , 2N \u2212 2, and Pfaff(\u03a6z) for so(2N).\n(3.9)\n(We recall that the Pfaffian is a square root of the determinant.) For reference, the degrees of Casimirs of su(N) are 2, 3, . . . , N ; of so(2N) are 2, 4, 6, . . . , 2N \u2212 2 and N ; of e6 are 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12; of e7 are 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18; of e8 are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\nIt is often convenient to replace \u03a6z by \u03a6zdz to soak up the z index and obtain a tensor. Then we work with the order dk differentials Pk(\u03a6z)dzdk on the holomorphic curve (aka Riemann surface) C. A somewhat different basis is more practical: for instance for su(N) one expands\ndet(X \u2212 \u03a6zdz) = XN \u2212 N\u2211 j=2 Oj XN\u2212j . (3.10)\nExercise 3.2. Check that O2 = Tr(\u03a62z/2)dz2, O3 = Tr(\u03a63z/3)dz3, and perhaps check that O4 = Tr(\u03a64z/4)dz4 \u2212O22/2. Why is there no O1?\nCoulomb branch. What VEV can we give Oj to define a vacuum? Denote it by26\n\u03c6j := \u3008Oj\u3009. (3.11)\nIt should be constant along R1,3 to avoid breaking Poincar\u00e9 symmetry. Next we use the anticommutator {Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A, Q\u0304\u03b2\u0307Bz\u0304 } \u223c \u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 AB\u2202z\u0304 to deduce that \u03c6j must depend holomorphically on z:\n\u03b1\u0307\u03b2\u0307 AB\u2202z\u0304\u03c6j \u223c \u2329 Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307A ( Q\u0304\u03b2\u0307Bz\u0304 Oj )\u232a + \u2329 Q\u0304\u03b2\u0307Bz\u0304 ( Q\u0304\u03b1\u0307AOj )\u232a = 0. (3.12)\n26The notation is slightly ill-defined in the case of so(4K) because there are then two Casimirs of the same degree 2K, leading to two order 2K differentials: \u03c62K defined from traces of powers of \u03a6z, and \u03c6\u03032K = \u3008Pfaff(\u03a6z)\u3009 dz2K .\nThe first term vanishes because the twisted compactification preserves the supercharge Q\u0304. The second term vanishes by construction of Oj .\nThe Coulomb branch of the 4d N = 2 theory is thus parametrized by degree dk differentials \u03c6dk on C for k = 1, . . . , rank g. When there are no punctures,\nB = r\u2295\nk=1 H0(C,K\u2297dk), \u03c6j \u2208 H0(C,K\u2297j), (3.13)\nwhere K is the canonical bundle on the curve C and H0(C,L) is the vector space of sections of the line bundle L on C. When C has punctures, the sections \u03c6dk have prescribed behaviours at each puncture. Starting in section 4 we explain, for concrete choices of C giving usual 4dN = 2 gauge theories, how to relate the parametrization (3.13) to the usual description in terms of scalars in 4d N = 2 vector multiplets.\nHitchin system. We would like to say intuitively that the 4d Coulomb branch is parametrized by the \u201cVEV\u201d of the adjoint-valued holomorphic one-form \u03a6zdz, a putative element of H0(C,K \u2297 g), modulo gauge transformations. Of course, VEVs of non-gaugeinvariant operators don\u2019t make sense (or are automatically zero, depending on your point of view) so talking about them is an abuse of language. Nevertheless in our case there is a construction of the so-called Hitchin field (or Higgs field), a holomorphic one-form \u03d5 = \u03d5zdz with component \u03d5z \u2208 g, whose Casimirs give Tr(\u03a6jz)dzj in the su(N) case and likewise in other cases. For convenience we occasionally use \u03d5 rather than the gauge-invariants \u03c6j in some explanations.\nThe story is a bit longer: one compactifies the 4d theory further on S1. Coulomb branch vacua of the 3d theory are given by solutions (A,\u03d5) of the Hitchin system on C,\nF + [\u03d5, \u03d5\u0304] = 0, \u2202\u0304A\u03d5 = 0, \u2202A\u03d5\u0304 = 0, (3.14)\nmodulo G gauge transformations. The resulting Coulomb branchM (the Hitchin moduli space) admits a projection onto the Coulomb branch B of the 4d theory by mapping (A,\u03d5) to Casimirs of \u03d5. The Hitchin equations (3.14) are equivalent to flatness of the GC connection A+ \u03d5zdz + \u03d5\u0304z\u0304dz\u0304 together with a gauge-fixing condition, so thatM can also be described as the moduli space of complex GC flat connections on C modulo GC gauge transformaions.\nComment on the IR behaviour. The low-energy limit of the 6d theory in a generic vacuum is given by an abelian 6d (2, 0) theory valued in the vacuum moduli space. Likewise, in a Coulomb branch vacuum described by a given choice of differentials \u03c6j in (3.13), the effective description of the 4d N = 2 theory includes massless scalar fields describing fluctuations of the \u03c6j . Together with similar dimensional reductions of B\u00b5\u03bd and \u03bb, these scalar fields form 4d N = 2 abelian vector multiplets.\nHow many? The scalar fields have the Coulomb branch B as their target, so we should expect an infrared description as a 4d N = 2 gauge theory with gauge group U(1)dimC B. At particular points on the Coulomb branch there are additional massless\nparticles charged under this gauge group. The Coulomb branch typically features points that are even more singular, where the low-energy dynamics are not abelian."

In the su(N) = aN\u22121 case we can repackage the data of \u03c6k in a geometric way in terms of the SW curve \u03a3 and SW differential \u03bb defined next.\nConsider the canonical line bundle T \u2217C C, whose fiber at a point in C consists of one-forms at that point. In a local coordinate z on C the total space T \u2217C admits coordinates (z, x) where x \u2208 C describes a one-form xdz. There is a natural injection C \u21aa\u2192 T \u2217C, the \u201czero section\u201d, that maps z \u2208 C to (z, x = 0).

Note that (3.15) is consistent with transformation properties of x and of the uj since each term is (the sole component of) a holomorphic N -form. At generic points z \u2208 C this equation (3.15) has N solutions, which locally gives an N sheeted cover of C. Generically, at certain isolated points on C two sheets intersect with a branch point of order 2. We have constructed in this way an N -sheeted ramified cover \u03a3 of C.\nAs we will see in concrete examples, \u03a3 turns out to be the SW curve of the 4d N = 2 theory in the given Coulomb branch vacuum, and the SW differential is the holomorphic one-form \u03bb defined as \u03bb = xdz in coordinates (z, x) of T \u2217C. The fact that our (\u03a3, \u03bb) matches the usual one is easier to see for concrete theories later on, but we can give some intuition. Besides indirectly giving the prepotential for the low-energy U(1)dimC B vector multiplets, one of the jobs of the SW curves is to calculate the central charge of particles (which puts a BPS lower bound on their mass) in terms of their electric, magnetic, and flavour charges: it should be obtained by integrating \u03bb along closed contours in \u03a3. Let us confirm this from the M-theory perspective in the A-type case.\nM-theory perspective on SW curve. We recall that X (su(N)) is the world-volume theory of N M5 branes (with the decoupled center of mass modes removed). The Rsymmetry is then realized geometrically as transverse rotations. The topological twist corresponds to combining the 2d rotations with 2d transverse rotations, and one finds that the full geometrical set-up corresponding to X (su(N)) partially twisted on R1,3 \u00d7C is to consider M-theory on R1,3 \u00d7 T \u2217C \u00d7 R3 and to place M5 branes along R1,3 \u00d7 C, the zero section.27\nMoving onto the Coulomb branch corresponds to shifting the M5 branes away from each other along the fibers of T \u2217C. Since the branes are indistinguishable they generically\n27More generally, T \u2217C can be replaced by a four-dimensional hyper-K\u00e4hler manifold and C by a holomorphic cycle inside Q.\nreconnect into an N -sheeted ramified cover \u03a3 \u2282 T \u2217C of C. Supersymmetry requires it to be holomorphic and we thus reproduce the above classification of Coulomb branch vacua. We emphasize that the UV curve C characterizes the theory, while the IR curve (or SW curve) \u03a3 depends on (and characterizes) the given Coulomb branch vacuum.\nExcitations of the brane system include massless fluctuations along the Coulomb branch of course, but also very interesting massive excitations coming from M2 branes ending on the M5 branes. Consider a two-dimensional surface D \u2282 T \u2217C whose boundary lies in the SW curve, \u2202D \u2282 \u03a3, and let us place an M2 brane along D \u00d7 R where R is the time direction in 4d Minkowski space. From the 4d point of view this describes a particle sitting still as time passes. Its mass m is simply the area of D,\nm = \u222b D |dzdx| \u2265 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b D dzdx \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b D d(xdz) \u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b \u2202D \u03bb \u2223\u2223\u2223. (3.16)\nThis reproduces the BPS lower bound expected from the SW curve and differential (\u03a3, \u03bb). In fact, realizing the SW curve \u03a3 as a fibration over C gives slightly finer control of the BPS spectrum than just knowing \u03a3 (and \u03bb). Indeed, some closed curves on \u03a3 are not the boundary of any two-dimensional D \u2282 T \u2217C, so that the M-theory setup \u201cknows\u201d that no BPS state with these charges exist, while the data of (\u03a3, \u03bb) only would not know it.\nThese M-theory considerations suggest that we found the right notion of SW curve and differential for class S theories. But we have yet to explain any concrete description of the 4d theories, rather than only their IR behaviour on the Coulomb branch. We turn to this next."

We now study how the class S theory can be described without moving along its Coulomb branch. Our guide to find such a description is that it should reproduce the aforementioned IR physics (it also reproduces some protected observables), and that different descriptions we find should be (exactly) dual to each other. Recall that the partial twist ensures that 4d physics we are interested in only depends on the complex structure of the Riemann surface C on which we compactify. We can thus pick any metric compatible with this complex structure.\nGluing. Consider two punctures p1, p2 \u2208 C of the same (or of different) punctured Riemann surface C = C \\{pi} and consider disks around p1 and p2. As far as the complex structure is concerned, these punctured disks are the same as semi-infinite cylinders thanks to the exponential map (expressed here in coordinates centered at pi)\nexp: (\u2212\u221e, \u03c1i]\u00d7 (R/(2\u03c0Z)) \u223c\u2212\u2192 { z \u2223\u2223 |z| \u2264 e\u03c1i} \\ {0}.\npi \u03c1i\npi (3.17)\nWe can glue two such semi-infinite cylinders by cutting their infinite end off at some finite distance and identifying the cutoff points on the left side of the following diagram:\n\u03c11\n\u03c12\nRest of Riemann surface\n(3.18)\nwhere the \u201crest\u201d can remain connected or be disconnected upon removing the tube. In terms of complex coordinates w and z around p1 and p2 respectively (with p1 at w = 0 and p2 at z = 0), the identification is\nzw = q (3.19)\nfor some parameter q. The modulus |q| gives the aspect ratio (length over circumference) (\u2212 log |q|)/2\u03c0 of the tube, while the phase of q indicates how the cylinders are rotated before gluing. The coordinates w, z are only locally defined so |q| cannot be too big: the tube can be arbitrarily long/thin but not too short/thick, as the description otherwise breaks down.

Despite how it is drawn in (3.18), the cylinder connecting the two punctures is flat and of constant circumference 2\u03c0L5 (for some metric). Let us denote the directions along and around the cylinder as x4, x5. We know that the 6d theory X (g) reduced on a circle gives 5d N = 2 SYM with gauge algebra g and coupling g25d ' L5. We should thus expect that part of the system obtained by reducing X (g) on the glued surface (3.18) is 5d N = 2 SYM on an interval of length L4 \u223c (\u2212 log |q|)L5. In the limit\nwhere C shrinks to a point, the 5d term Tr(F 2) does not depend much on the x4 direction, thus the 4d Lagrangian ought to have a term\n1 g25d \u222b I Tr(F 2) = 1 g24d Tr(F 2), 1 g24d = L4 g25d ' L4 L5 = \u2212 log |q|.

The instanton current of a 5d gauge field is defined as\nJ inst\u00b5 = \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4 Tr(F \u03bd\u03c1F \u03c3\u03c4 ). (3.21)\nAs we mentioned earlier, in the reduction from X (g) to 5d N = 2 SYM the KK (Kaluza\u2013 Klein) modes correspond to instanton particles of the 5d theory, namely the KK momentum in x5 is equal to the charge under J inst. Thinking of x4 as Euclidean time, the translation operator P5 is given as an integral of the \u201ctime\u201d component J inst4 over the 4d \u201cspatial\u201d directions x0, . . . , x3. Twisting the cylinder by an angle \u03b8 = Im log |q| thus contributes a term \u03b8Tr(F \u2227 F ) to the 4d Lagrangian when we eventually reduce C to a point.\nAltogether we expect that a long cylinder as in (3.18) should yield a 4d N = 2 vector multiplet with complexified gauge coupling \u03c4 given by log q:\n\u03c4 = \u03b82\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i g2 , q \u223c e2\u03c0i\u03c4 . (3.22)\nThe relation is made more precise later in concrete geometries.\nPants decomposition and S-duality. Vector multiplets must gauge flavour symmetries of some matter sector, and our next task is to understand where that matter comes from. For this, the key is to send gauge couplings to zero, because in this limit the vector multiplet decouples and leaves behind the matter sector with its flavour symmetries. Exercise 3.4. As a toy model, consider a scalar field \u03c6 transforming in some representation of a group G, and gauge the symmetry G using a gauge field A. We denote by D = d +A the covariant derivative and F = dA+A \u2227A, and ignore numerical factors. By introducing a field A\u0303 = g\u22121A with canonically normalized kinetic term, show how\nL = 1 g2 Tr(F 2) + |D\u03c6|2 g\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Tr(dA\u0303)2 + |d\u03c6|2. (3.23)\nNote that in the limit the flavour symmetry G of \u03c6 is not gauged any longer. The original gauge theory can be then restored (up to the free gauge field A\u0303) by gauging this flavour symmetry with a new gauge field. Check the same decoupling happens for spinors (\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u00b5D\u00b5\u03c8).\nAny punctured Riemann surface C with genus g and n punctures, except for (g, n) among (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), can be decomposed into three-punctured spheres (pairs of pants) glued as described above. Such a decomposition is called a pants decomposition. For each pants decomposition of C there is a corresponding cusp in the moduli space Mg,n of Riemann surfaces with genus g and n punctures. At this cusp, C is described\nby three-punctured spheres joined by infinitely thin tubes. Each such tube yields an infinitely weakly coupled vector multiplet in the 4d theory, so that in this limit we can expect 6d fields \u201clocalized\u201d on each pair of pants to decouple from each other since the 4d vector multiplets joining them become free:\nfree vector free vector (3.24)\nAs in the toy model, the symmetries gauged by the vector multiplet are restored as flavour symmetries in the zero coupling limit.\nThe picture that emerges is as follows. The building blocks of T(g, C,D) are class S theories called tinkertoys associated to three-punctured spheres. These (4d N = 2) tinkertoys have flavour symmetries associated to each puncture, which we study carefully later. For each tube, consider the flavour symmetry groups F1 and F2 associated to the two punctures that it connects, and gauge a suitable diagonal subgroup F \u2282 F1 \u00d7 F2 using a 4d N = 2 vector multiplet. This yields T(g, C,D). This description of T(g, C,D) for each pants decomposition of C can be written schematically as\nT(g, C,D) = ( \u220f pants T(g, sphere \\ 3pt) ) / ( \u220f tubes gauge group ) . (3.25)\nA large part of the work in understanding the AGT correspondence is to classify tinkertoys obtained from three punctured spheres with different types of punctures. Their flavour symmetry can be rather intricate, which is why we cannot make the gauge groups more explicit in (3.25) in such generality.\nWhen all punctures are so-called full tame punctures (explained later), all building blocks are the same tinkertoy Tg. This theory is an isolated28 SCFT with (at least) g3 flavour symmetry associated to its three punctures. For g = su(2) it consists of four free hypermultiplets, while for other g it has no 4d N = 2 Lagrangian description.\nOf course, a given Riemann surface has many inequivalent decompositions into pairs of pants. Each one leads to a description of T(g, C,D) as a weakly coupled gauge theory in one corner of parameter space. At strong coupling (short tubes) another description may be weakly coupled hence more useful. In concrete cases this reproduces known 4d N = 2 S-dualities. Here is an exercise to get an intuition about pants decompositions. Exercise 3.5 (Combinatorics of pants decompositions). 1. Given a surface Cg,n with genus g and n punctures, check that all pants decompositions use the same number of three-punctured spheres.\n2. Draw the three topologically different29 pants decompositions of a four-punctured sphere (assuming punctures are distinguishable). How many pants decompositions does an n-punctured sphere have? Does a once-punctured torus have a finite number of pants decompositions?\n28An SCFT with a certain amount of supersymmetry is isolated if it does not have any exactly marginal deformation with the same supersymmetry (such as gauge couplings in 4d).\n29Two pants decompositions are the same in this sense if the closed curves cutting the surface into pieces with three boundaries can be deformed into each other without (self)-intersection or crossing punctures.\n3. Return to point 3 of Exercise 3.3 and construct the sphere with n = 4 (or 5) punctures by gluing three-punctured spheres in all possible ways.\n4. We don\u2019t need to degenerate the Riemann surface completely down to pairs of pants: as soon as C involves one long tube the theory T(g, C,D) can be written in terms of a weakly coupled vector multiplet gauging flavour symmetries of a \u201csmaller\u201d class S theory. What Riemann surface (genus, punctures) underlies the latter theory? There are two cases depending on whether the surface disconnects."

In subsection 4.2 we glue two such building blocks to learn how X (su(2)) on a sphere with four tame punctures reproduces known aspects of 4d N = 2 SQCD with gauge group SU(2) and Nf = 4 flavours. This is the conventional starting point of AGT reviews: one usually studies S-duality of SU(2) SQCD [4] and of quivers gauge theories [175], before explaining the unifying 6d point of view [1]. We extend the discussion in subsection 4.3 to generalized SU(2) quivers arising\nDescription of punctures and some tinkertoys\n\u2022 The su(2) tinkertoy consist of a trifundamental halfhypermultiplet of SU(2)3. \u2022 The su(N) tinkertoy with two full and one simple puncture is an SU(N)2 bifundamental hypermultiplet. \u2022 For su(N), at a full tame puncture z0 the differentials obey \u03c6k = ( \u03c3k (z\u2212z0)k +O( 1 (z\u2212z0)k\u22121 ) ) dzk for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 N where \u03c3k has mass dimension k.

This teaches us that there are several types of tame punctures hence several types of codimension 4 operators in the 6d theory. All theories we consider in this section are such that gauge couplings have vanishing one-loop beta function, and this implies that the couplings have vanishing beta function at all orders [176]."

            "text": "We discuss tame punctures; for su(2) there is only one type. We then consider X (su(2)) on a sphere CP1 with three tame punctures at 0, 1,\u221e and we argue that the resulting tinkertoy T2 = Tsu(2), which is the main building block of su(2) class S theories, is a collection of four free hypermultiplets. There is no first principle derivation of that fact, but we will see many checks of it, especially correct postdictions of Coulomb branch and SW curves of many gauge theories, as well as consistency with string theory dualities.\nTame punctures. We describe punctures in terms of their effect on the Hitchin field \u03d5(z) parametrizing the Coulomb branch, or gauge-invariantly in terms of the higher-order differentials \u03c6dk , k = 1, . . . , rank g.\nPunctures can arise from pinching a thin tube. In a complex coordinate w \u2208 R\u00d7 S1 describing this tube, the \u03c6dk often tend to constants (times dwdk) inside the thin tube. Cutting the cylinder (the opposite of what we did in (3.18)) and applying the exponential map (3.17) z = ew, we generically expect\n\u03c6dk ' dzdk zdk + . . . (4.1)\nwith some coefficients, in a local coordinate z in which the puncture is at z = 0. This motivates us to work with tame punctures, namely points where \u03d5(z)dz has a first order pole with a prescribed residue, of course up to gauge conjugation: the prescribed residue translates generically to a prescribed leading coefficient in (4.1) \u2014a full tame puncture. We study other punctures later in section 7: tame punctures in which \u03c6dk have lower-order poles instead of (4.1), and wild punctures defined as having higher-order poles.\nMassive and massless tame punctures for su(2). For now we focus on su(2): there is then a single type of tame puncture.\nThis case has a single Casimir, the quadratic differential \u03c62 = 12 Tr(\u03d52)dz2. We impose the residue of the Hitchin field \u03d5 up to conjugation (which we denote \u223c): for non-zero m \u2208 C,\n\u03d5(z) \u223c (diag(m,\u2212m)\nz \u2212 zi +O(1)\n) dz =\u21d2 \u03c62(z) = ( m2\n(z \u2212 zi)2 +O ( 1 z \u2212 zi )) dz2. (4.2)\nWe call m 6= 0 the mass parameter of the puncture for the following reason. The sheets of \u03a3 defined in (3.15) behave as x\u00b1(z) = \u00b1m/(z \u2212 zi) + O(1), and integrating the SW differential \u03bb around zi on one of the two sheets picks up the residue \u00b1m. This means m appears as a contribution to the central charge hence to masses of BPS particles.\nNaively, taking the m \u2192 0 limit in the \u03d5(z) asymptotics changes zi into a regular point. In the \u03c62 equation however, the puncture remains as a first order pole. This is explained from the \u03d5(z) point of view by noting that it is only defined up to conjugation. Conjugating the diagonal matrix diag(m,\u2212m) before taking the m\u2192 0 limit can yield a non-zero value, (\nm 0 0 \u2212m ) \u223c ( m 1 0 \u2212m ) m\u21920\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 ( 0 1 0 0 ) . (4.3)\nIndeed, we find a consistent massless tame puncture \u03d5(z) \u223c ((\n0 1 0 0\n) 1\nz \u2212 zi +O(1)\n) dz =\u21d2 \u03c62(z) = O ( 1 z \u2212 zi ) dz2 (4.4)\nwhere the pole has a free coefficient. Interestingly, the sheets of \u03a3 defined by x2dz2 = \u03c62 admit a branch point at such a massless puncture.\nExercise 4.1. 1. For any \u03b1 \u2208 C find an invertible matrix g \u2208 SL(2,C) such that g\u22121 diag(m,\u2212m)g = (m \u03b1 0 \u2212m ) .\n2. Check that all ( 0 \u03b1 0 0 ) , \u03b1 6= 0, are conjugate to each other.\n3. How does the coefficient of 1/(z \u2212 zi) arise in (4.2) and (4.4) from components of the (z \u2212 zi)0 term in the expansion of \u03d5?\nWe interpret (4.2) as follows: the massless puncture (4.4) carries SU(2) flavour symmetry, and turning on a constant scalar \u03c6background = m in a background vector multiplet coupled to that symmetry changes the puncture to the massive one (4.2).\nThree-punctured sphere and symmetries. Now consider T2, the result of placing X (su(2)) on a sphere CP1 with three tame punctures. What do we know for sure about T2?\nFirst, it should have at least SU(2)3 flavour symmetry, one SU(2) per puncture. We learn in the next exercise that 4 free hypermultiplets indeed have an USp(8) flavour symmetry, which contains SU(2)\u00d7 Spin(4) = SU(2)3. The USp(8) flavour symmetry is in this context an emergent symmetry that is only present in the limit where C shrinks to a point; it is not a symmetry of the 6d setup. Exercise 4.2. 1. Check that k free scalar fields carry O(k) flavour symmetry. Check that p free hypermultiplets contain 4p free scalars hence have O(4p) symmetries (and more from spinors). Out of these, check a USp(2p) subgroup commutes with SU(2)R R-symmetry. (Hint: as an intermediate step, the U(2p) subgroup commutes with J3 \u2208 SU(2)R.)\n2. Now gauge an SU(2) = USp(2) flavour symmetry embedded diagonally into USp(2)p \u2282 USp(2p). The gauged su(2) times su(2)R combine into so(4). Check that the 4p scalars organize as p copies of the fundamental representation of so(4). Deduce that the remaining flavour symmetry is SO(p). It is in fact Spin(p) because of the action on spinors in the hypermultiplets.\nThe trifundamental half-hypermultiplet. All three SU(2) symmetries of the four hypermultiplets can be made manifest, at the cost of hiding N = 2 supersymmetry. Split each hypermultiplet into a pair of N = 1 chiral multiplets (q, q\u0303). The four hypermultiplets split into eight N = 1 chiral multiplets qaiu where a, i, u (ranging from 1 to 2) are indices for the three independent SU(2). To reconstruct the hypermultiplets as (q, q\u0303) simply introduce the notation\nq\u0303aiu = ab ij uvqbjv. (4.5)\nThe hypermultiplets are thus in a trifundamental representation of SU(2)3 with a reality property (4.5) that halves the number of components. This set of matter fields is called a half-hypermultiplet.\nIf background vector multiplet scalars (i.e., masses m1,m2,m3) are turned on for the three SU(2)3, then the underlying 8 chiral multiplets have complex masses \u00b1m1\u00b1m2\u00b1m3 for all choices of signs. In particular one of the 4 hypermultiplets becomes massless when m2 = \u00b1m1 \u00b1m3. This is important later.\nSeiberg\u2013Witten curve of T2. We denote by m1,m2,m3 the mass parameters of punctures at 0, 1,\u221e in the sense of (4.2) or (4.4).30 The Coulomb branch (if any) of the 4d theory is parametrized by holomorphic quadratic differential \u03c62(z) that have second order poles (4.2) or first-order in the massless case (4.4) at each of the punctures, and no other pole. The puncture at infinity translates to a condition as z \u2192\u221e:\n\u03c62(z) = ( m23 z2 +O ( 1 z3 )) dz2. (4.6)\nWe recall Liouville\u2019s theorem regarding entire functions (holomorphic functions on C with no pole): if an entire function f is bounded as |f(z)| < Kzp for some constant K and exponent p then f is a polynomial of degree at most p. Exercise 4.3. Find a quadratic differential \u03c62(z) = u2(z)dz2 that has the prescribed second order poles at 0, 1,\u221e and no other singularity and show it is unique. (Hint: write it as u2(z) = f(z)/(z2(z \u2212 1)2), change variables to w = 1/z to polynomially bound f at infinity and use Liouville\u2019s theorem to bound the degree of f , then compare with the prescribed asymptotics to fix coefficients.)\nThe Coulomb branch is thus a single point, which is consistent with the lack of vector multiplet in our description of T2 as free hypermultiplets. Explicitly,\n\u03c62(z) = u2(z)dz2, u2(z) = \u2212m21 z2(z \u2212 1) + m22 z(z \u2212 1)2 + m23 z(z \u2212 1) . (4.7)\nLet us find the IR description of T2 at this unique Coulomb branch vacuum. As we commented on page 24, the low-energy theory is generically a 4d N = 2 abelian gauge theory with the vector multiplet scalars living in the Coulomb branch B. Here there is no Coulomb branch hence no gauge fields in the IR. There may be hypermultiplets: for this we have to study the SW curve \u03a3 defined by x2 = u2 and the SW differential \u03bb = xdz. The integral of \u03bb over closed cycles tells us about masses of BPS states.\nThe curve \u03a3 is a ramified double cover of CP1. How many branch points does it have? Branch points are where the two sheets x = \u00b1\u221au2 rejoin, namely where u2 = 0. This happens at the (generically) two roots of the quadratic polynomial\nz2(z \u2212 1)2u2(z) = \u2212(z \u2212 1)m21 + zm22 + z(z \u2212 1)m23. (4.8)\nAltogether, \u03a3 wraps the sphere twice, with a single branch cut. It is thus topologically a sphere. The three punctures at 0, 1,\u221e \u2208 CP1 become six point on \u03a3 where the SW differential \u03bb blows up:\n\u03a3: 0 1\n\u221e :C (4.9)\n30We don\u2019t know at this stage that they are the same parameters as in the last paragraph about the trifundamental half-hypermultiplet.\nBPS spectrum. Contour integrals of \u03bb give integer31 linear combinations of residues of \u03bb = xdz = \u00b1\u221au2 dz at the poles z = 0, 1,\u221e. By construction these residues are \u00b1m1,\u00b1m2,\u00b1m3, so we find that masses (or rather central charges) of BPS states take the form Z = f1m1 + f2m2 + f3m3 for f1, f2, f3 \u2208 Z. On the other hand, the trifundamental half-hypermultiplet only has BPS states with integer linear combinations of \u00b1m1\u00b1m2\u00b1m3: this imposes the further restriction that f1 = f2 = f3 mod 2. Does the tinkertoy T2 also have that restriction?\nIn subsection 3.3 we learned that M-theory instructs us to only integrate \u03bb over contours \u03b3 in \u03a3 \u2282 T \u2217C that can be written as the boundary \u03b3 = \u2202D of some twodimensional surface D \u2282 T \u2217C. Exercise 4.4. 1. First choose D to be a small circle around one of the punctures, times the interval connecting the two sheets of \u03a3. Its boundary is a pair of circles picking up twice the same residue mi (from different sheets). Deduce that 2m1, 2m2, 2m3 and all their integer linear combinations are in the spectrum.\n2. Next, choose D such that \u2202D is a contour from one branch point to the other (on one sheet) and back via the other sheet. Note that the contour \u2202D can be deformed to a contour staying on one sheet and surrounding the cut. Deduce that the integral of \u03bb is one of the combinations \u00b1m1 \u00b1m2 \u00b1m3 (three poles are on each side of the contour) and conclude that the BPS spectrum of T2 contains all Z = f1m1 + f2m2 + f3m3 with f1 = f2 = f3 mod 2.\n3. (Mathematical.) For any D \u2282 T \u2217C with boundary \u2202D \u2282 \u03a3, consider the projection \u03c0 : T \u2217C \u2192 C and deduce that \u03c0(\u2202D) = \u2202(\u03c0(D)) cannot surround a pole. Deduce that the BPS spectrum of T2 is exactly that of the trifundamental half-hypermultiplet.\nGenerically, all of these BPS particles are massive so that the low-energy theory is empty. An interesting case is the limit m2 \u2192 \u00b1(m1 \u00b1 m3) where one of the four hypermultiplets in the trifundamental half-hypermultiplet becomes massless. Then the SW curve degenerates because the two branch points collide: indeed, u2 has a double root (4.8)\nz2(z \u2212 1)2u2(z) = (m1 \u00b1 zm3)2. (4.10)\nThe contour we considered in point 2 of the above exercise shrinks to zero size while \u03bb itself remains finite, so the integral is indeed zero, consistent with the vanishing mass. We will run this kind of easy consistency checks for the more complicated theories.\n4.2 4d N = 2 SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD After so many generalities let us study the Coulomb branch, SW curve and S-dualities of our first interesting concrete theory: X (su(2)) on a sphere with four tame punctures.\nIdentifying the 4d theory (spoilers in the title above). We place the four punctures at z1 = 0, z2 = q, z3 = 1, z4 =\u221e on the two-sphere CP1. The three degeneration limits q \u2192 0, 1,\u221e of the four-punctured sphere correspond to all ways of clustering the\n31We ignore the factor of 2\u03c0i in the residue theorem.\npunctures pairwise. Since the three limits are identical up to permuting the punctures we concentrate on q \u2192 0. In this limit, we expect on general grounds that the 4d theory consists of two tinkertoys Tsu(2) and one SU(2) vector multiplet gauging an SU(2) flavour symmetry of each tinkertoy. After this gauging each tinkertoy should still carry at least su(2) \u00d7 su(2) flavour symmetries associated to its two remaining punctures. We can depict this as a (generalized) quiver making all symmetries explicit:\nT ( su(2),CP1 \\ {0, q, 1,\u221e} ) = SU(2)\nSU(2) SU(2)\nSU(2)\nSU(2) (4.11)\nHere the round node denotes a gauge group while square nodes denote flavour symmetries. Each junction represents our favorite tinkertoy T2, the trifundamental halfhypermultiplet, i.e., four hypermultiplets transforming as two doublet representations of the SU(2) gauge group.\nWe thus get two flavours from the left junction and two flavours from the right junction, hence the theory is SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 flavours. While each tinkertoy in (4.11) has Spin(4) flavour symmetry after gauging SU(2), the full theory has Nf = 4 doublets of SU(2) on an equal footing hence has flavour symmetry Spin(8), larger than Spin(4)2. This symmetry of the 4d theory only emerges in the limit where C shrinks to a point.\nCoulomb branch. We denote by m1,m2,m3,m4 the mass parameters at each of these punctures in the sense of (4.2) or (4.4). Coulomb branch vacua of the 4d theory are parametrized by holomorphic quadratic differential \u03c62(z) that have second order poles (4.2) or first-order in the massless case (4.4) at each of the punctures, and no other pole. The puncture at infinity translates to a condition as z \u2192\u221e:\n\u03c62(z) = ( m24 z2 +O ( 1 z3 )) dz2. (4.12)\nWe parametrize the possible \u03c62(z) in the next exercise, starting with the massless case m1 = m2 = m3 = m4 = 0 for which \u03c62 has first-order poles. Exercise 4.5. 1. Find all quadratic differentials \u03c62(z) = u2(z)dz2 that have first order poles at 0, q, 1,\u221e and no other. (Hint: after writing u2(z) = f(z)/(z(z \u2212 q)(z \u2212 1)), change variables to w = 1/z to deduce a polynomial bound on f(z), then use Liouville\u2019s theorem mentioned above.)\n2. Find one quadratic differential \u03c62 that has leading behaviour m2i /(z \u2212 zi)2 for i = 1, 2, 3 and m24/z2 at infinity as per (4.12). Combining with the massless case deduce all such quadratic differentials.\nWe find a one-dimensional Coulomb branch B = C with vacua32\n\u03c62 = u2dz2, u2(z) = q zm 2 1 + q(q\u22121) z\u2212q m 2 2 + z\u2212qz\u22121m23 + zm24 \u2212 u\nz(z \u2212 q)(z \u2212 1) (4.13)\n32The variable u parametrizing the Coulomb branch can be freely redefined, hence you may have gotten a slightly different expression in Exercise 4.5.\nlabeled by u \u2208 B = C. A zero-th order check that we did not go astray is that we got the correct dimension (namely 1) for the Coulomb branch of SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 flavours.\nDegeneration limit. As q \u2192 0, the surface degenerates, and we should obtain in a suitable sense two disconnected three-punctured spheres. For |q|, |z| 1 at fixed masses, (4.13) behaves as\n\u03c62(z) ' \u2212q z m 2 1 + qz\u2212qm22 + u z(z \u2212 q) dz 2, (4.14)\nwhich is precisely the quadratic differential on a sphere with three tame punctures of masses squared m21, m22, and u. Likewise, for |q| |z|, 1 (4.13) behaves as the quadratic differential on a three-punctured sphere with masses squared u, m23 and m24. This is consistent with how we introduced tame punctures in subsection 4.1.\nSince masses are background values of vector multiplet scalars, we learn from (4.14) the identification\nu = 12 \u2329 Tr\u03c62 \u232a\n(4.15)\nin the weakly-coupled limit |q| 1, where \u03c6 is the (dynamical) vector multiplet scalar corresponding to the SU(2) gauge group. In other words u is the usual parametrization of the Coulomb branch of SQCD.\nSeiberg\u2013Witten curve. We now return to general q. The SW curve and differential are defined by \u03a3 = {(x, z) \u2208 T \u2217CP1 | x2 = u2(z)} and \u03bb = xdz.\nThe curve \u03a3 is a ramified double cover of CP1. How many branch points does it have? Branch points are where the two sheets x = \u00b1\u221au2 rejoin, namely where u2 = 0. This happens at the (generically) four roots of the polynomial z2(z \u2212 q)2(z \u2212 1)2u2(z), which is quartic. Altogether, \u03a3 wraps the sphere twice, with four branch points joined by two branch cuts. It is thus topologically a torus. In addition to these branch cuts we have four punctures at 0, q, 1,\u221e \u2208 CP1, hence eight point on \u03a3 where the SW differential \u03bb blows up:\n\u03a3: 0 q 1 \u221e :C (4.16)\nExercise 4.6. 1. By changing coordinates as x = x\u0303/z + m2/(z \u2212 q) + m3/(z \u2212 1), rewrite the curve x2 = u2 in a form that only has simple poles at z = 0, q, 1. Show that \u03bb\u0303 := x\u0303dz/z differs from the SW differential \u03bb = xdz by a u-independent term whose contour integrals (residues) are linear combinations of masses. Recall the BPS mass formula \u222e \u03bb = na+maD+fimi and check what changing \u03bb to \u03bb\u0303 amounts to a redefinition of flavour charges. Up to simple changes of coordinates perhaps33 match with more 33I have not checked yet what form Martone uses in his notes.\nconventional expressions of the SW curve and differential of SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD given in [123]. The match confirms that we correctly identified the tinkertoy Tsu(2).\nSingularities on the Coulomb branch. As we described on page 24, the low-energy theory is generically a 4d N = 2 abelian gauge theory with the vector multiplet scalars living in the Coulomb branch B. For generic values of u and of masses, we thus get a U(1) vector multiplet, but at special values of the parameters some branch points may collide, which leads to interesting low-energy behaviours. We already saw that near (4.10) in our study of the tinkertoy: we found particular values of the masses where a pair of branch points of the SW curve collide. This collision made a certain contour shrink to zero size, hence lead to a massless BPS particle which remains present in the IR theory. For SQCD such collisions of branch points enrich the IR theory by adding one or more massless hypermultiplets charged under the low-energy U(1). Exercise 4.7 (On the discriminant). The discriminant of a degree d polynomial P (z) = pd \u220fd a=1(z \u2212 za) is \u2206P = p2d\u22122d \u220f a<b(za \u2212 zb)2. It vanishes by construction exactly when P (z) has double roots. It is known that \u2206P can be expressed as a polynomial of degree 2d\u2212 2 in the coefficients pj of P (z) = \u2211d j=0 pjz\nj . Check this for quadratic polynomials. Our question is to find when P (z) = z2(z \u2212 q)2(z \u2212 1)2u2(z), which is a quartic polynomial given explicitly in (4.13), has double roots (hence when two branch points collide). The discriminant \u2206P is then of degree 6 in the coefficients of P . Since P depends linearly on u we find that \u2206P is of degree 6 in u (the leading coefficient turns out to be nonzero). We should thus expect 6 singularities on the Coulomb branch.\nFour of these can be seen concretely in the weak coupling limit (with fixed masses). Then \u03c62 is roughly given by the quadratic differential on each pair of pants, connected by a long tube where \u03c62 is suitably constant, see (4.14). Each three-punctured sphere has two zeros of \u03c62, hence one branch cut of the SW curve. Consider the pair of pants with masses squared m21,m22, u, for definiteness. Its branch cut shrinks to zero size whenever any combination \u00b1m1 \u00b1m2 \u00b1 \u221a u of the mass parameters vanishes. We thus find four of the six singular points of the Coulomb branch:\nu = (m1 \u00b1m2)2 +O(q) and u = (m3 \u00b1m4)2 +O(q). (4.17)\nThe remaining two points are not so easy to determine from the explicit quadratic differential (4.13) of the class S theory, partly because they correspond to the collision of branch points that sit in different pair of pants in our decomposition above. A tedious series expansion shows that at34\nu = \u00b12 ( q(m22 \u2212m21)(m23 \u2212m24) )1/2 +O(q) (4.18) two branch points collide at z = \u22132 ( q(m22 \u2212m21)/(m23 \u2212m24)\n)1/2 + O(q), with the sign being correlated to that of u.\nFrom the point of view of SQCD with Nf = 4 flavours, what happens is as follows. The four doublet hypermultiplets have mass parameters m1 +m2,m1\u2212m2,m3 +m4,m3\u2212m4,\n34It would be nice to understand the formulae better from our 6d construction.\nso when the \u201cVEV\u201d of the vector multiplet \u03c6 matches one of these we get a massless hypermultiplet; its charge is +1 or \u22121 under the low-energy U(1) because that is how the diagonal U(1) \u2282 SU(2) acts on a doublet. At low energies |u| |mi|, |mi \u00b1mj |, all hypermultiplets are massive and can be integrated out, leaving behind pure SU(2) SYM, whose Coulomb branch is known to have two singular points at u = \u00b12\u039b, the monopole and dyon points. Incidentally we learn that the dynamically generated scale is at 1/2 times the value (4.18). The main takeaway for our purposes is that the 6d perspective reproduces all the expected physics of SQCD.\nBy tuning more than just u we can get more than two branch points to collide, hence more than one set of fields to become massless. Such limits can lead in the IR to non-trivial SCFT including the AD theory, which we return to in section 7. The limits are also interesting on the 2d side.\nCoupling constants. It may be puzzling how q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 , which ranges over C \\ {0, 1}, reproduces the complexified gauge coupling \u03c4Lag = \u03b8/(2\u03c0) + 4\u03c0i/g2 that appears in a Lagrangian description of SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4, especially the fact that Im \u03c4Lag > 0. To relate them, we consider the massless limit where all mi \u2192 0, such that the theory is an SCFT and the couplings do not run. An equivalent limit is the large |u| region of the Coulomb branch, specifically |u| |mi|2. From this point of view the running is stopped very quickly at the large energy scale |u|. Thus, the IR gauge coupling \u03c4IR captured by the SW curve obeys \u03c4IR = 2\u03c4Lag, with a factor due to how U(1) embeds into SU(2).\nThe SW curve \u03a3 is a torus double-covering the sphere, with four branch points found at zeros of u2. At most one of the first four terms in u2 given in (4.13) can be large at once, so to compensate for the large value of u one must have z close to one of the punctures 0, q, 1,\u221e: the four branch points are thus at\nz = O ( m21 u ) , z = q +O ( m22 u ) , z = 1 +O ( m23 u ) , z = O ( u\nm24\n) . (4.19)\nThe modular parameter \u03c4IR of the torus \u03a3 gives the complexified gauge coupling, which automatically obeys Im \u03c4IR > 0. In terms of the modular lambda function \u03bb, one has [177]\nq = \u03bb(\u03c4IR) = 16e\u03c0i\u03c4IR \u2212 128e2\u03c0i\u03c4IR + . . . ,\n\u03c4 = 12\u03c4IR + log 16 2\u03c0i \u2212 8 2\u03c0ie \u03c0i\u03c4IR + . . . , (4.20)\nwhere the expansion holds for small gauge coupling g. Both \u03c4 and \u03c4Lag = 12\u03c4IR are perfectly good definitions of gauge coupling, which amount to two different renormalization scheme, differing by a constant shift and by instanton corrections. The freedom to redefine couplings appears again in (5.38).\nS-duality. The four-punctured sphere CP1 \\{0, q, 1,\u221e} has three pants decompositions hence three Lagrangian descriptions. The descriptions are identical except for permutations of masses m1,m2,m3,m4 and changing q \u2192 1/q or q \u2192 1\u2212 q. This is S-duality of\nSQCD [4]. In the notation of (4.11),\nSU(2)1\nSU(2)2 SU(2) q SU(2)3 SU(2)4 = SU(2)1 SU(2)2 SU(2) 1/q SU(2)3 SU(2)4 =\nSU(2)1\nSU(2)2 SU(2) 1\u2212q SU(2)3\nSU(2)4 (4.21)\nWhile these equalities are manifest in the 6d perspective they hide deep non-perturbative physics, as they are equalities between QFTs involving completely different elementary gauge fields and matter fields (the gauge field A\u00b5 in some description is unrelated to A\u00b5 in another).\n4.3 Generalized SU(2) quivers We have given all the ingredients to determine su(2) class S theories arising from X (su(2)) on an arbitrary punctured Riemann surface C with tame punctures.35 This subsection will thus consist essentially of exercises.\nFive-punctured sphere. We consider here C = CP1 \\ {0, z1, z2, 1,\u221e}; note that we shifted indices of punctures zi a bit compared to our earlier conventions. For any decomposition into three-punctured spheres the Lagrangian has the form\nT ( su(2),CP1 \\ {0, z1, z2, 1,\u221e} ) = SU(2)\nSU(2) SU(2)\nSU(2) SU(2) SU(2)\nSU(2) (4.22)\nContrarily to spheres with fewer punctures, the SU(2)5 flavour symmetry manifest from 6d does not enhance in the 4d theory (as far as I know). S-dualities of this theory were studied in [175] before class S theories and their S-dualities were uncovered in [1]. Exercise 4.8. Write C as the gluing of three pairs of pants with gluing parameters z1/z2 and z2 following Exercise 3.3. Exercise 4.9. For each pants decomposition of C check that the Lagrangian description is (4.22), with gauge group SU(2)2 and twelve hypermultiplets. In what representations of the SU(2)2 gauge group do they transform? What flavour symmetries do these representations carry? Exercise 4.10. 1. Each SU(2) gauge group is coupled to four doublet hypermultiplets. When the other gauge group is weakly coupled the theory is thus SQCD coupled to further matter by a weakly coupled gauge field. \u201cApply\u201d S-duality to this SQCD theory and check that the resulting description is the description one would have written for some pair of pants of the five-punctured sphere.\n35We exclude the sphere with no puncture, one puncture (a plane), or two punctures (a cylinder), and the torus without punctures, as they are pathological.\n2. Check that elementary S-dualities (4.21) applied to different gauge nodes do not commute so that the S-duality group(oid) of the SU(2)2 gauge theory is not the product of S-duality groups of two SQCD theories.\nPunctured sphere. Next we consider CP1 \\ {z0, . . . , zn\u22121} with n punctures, with z0 = 0, zn\u22122 = 1, zn\u22121 = \u221e. Denote by m0,m1, . . . ,mn\u22121 the mass parameters of the punctures. Exercise 4.11. 1. By using Liouville\u2019s theorem as in Exercise 4.3 and Exercise 4.5, find all quadratic differentials \u03c62(z) that have the prescribed second order poles at punctures. Deduce that the Coulomb branch is B = Cn\u22123.\n2. Write a SU(2)n\u22123 linear quiver description of the theory that is weakly coupled in the regime |z1| |z2| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |zn\u22123| 1.\n2. Expand \u03c62(z) in this regime for z in an annulus |zi\u22121| |z| |zi+1| (i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 2). Check that \u03c62 reduces to the differential of T2 on each of these pair of pants building blocks. Check that B = Cn\u22123 can be parametrized by the parameters ui, i = 1, . . . , n\u2212 3 of punctures in these pants. Identify ui = 12 Tr\u03c62i where \u03c6i is the vector multiplet scalar of the i-th vector multiplet.\n3. Check that starting at n = 6 pants decompositions can be topologically distinct beyond just the permutation of punctures.\nPunctured torus. We repeat a similar exercise for genus g = 1. One could also study theories associated to higher-genus curves, but the relevant mathematics are out of scope of this review. Exercise 4.12. 1. The once-punctured torus is obtained by gluing two punctures of the same pair of pants. Write the theory as an SU(2) gauge theory and note that there is a decoupled gauge singlet in addition to the adjoint hypermultiplet.36\n2. Write the theory associated to an n-punctured torus as a circular SU(2)n quiver with a bifundamental hypermultiplet for each pair of neighboring groups. The weak gauge coupling regime corresponds to a long torus with well-separated punctures.\n3. If you know enough about elliptic functions determine all quadratic differentials with prescribed second order poles at the punctures. Expand them in the weak gauge coupling limit as in Exercise 4.11.\n4.4 Linear quiver su(N) theories We move on briefly to su(N) class S theories, specifically a particular subclass that is ad-hoc from the 6d perspective but leads to linear quiver gauge theories in 4d, as can be understood using brane constructions. These will be useful for our discussion of instantons.\n36It is not immediately clear to me how such gauge singlets work out when considering different Lagrangian descriptions of n-punctured tori or of higher genus surfaces. Indeed, some channels include adjoint hypermultiplets, hence gauge singlets, while for others the singlets are not manifest.\nConformal SQCD. Let us try and realize SU(N) SQCD with Nf = 2N flavours (the number of flavours needed for a vanishing beta function) as a class S theory. Its flavour symmetry is u(Nf ) = u(2N) (enhanced to so(8) when N = 2). In analogy to the N = 2 case we expect the gauge group to correspond to a tube joining two three-punctured spheres, so we split the 2N flavours as two groups of N , where each group should come from one of the two three-punctured sphere. The flavour symmetry of each group is u(N) = u(1)\u00d7 su(N), so that this split makes su(N)2\u00d7 u(1)2 flavour symmetry manifest. In analogy to the N = 2 case we associate each of the four factors to one puncture and write an analogue of (4.11):37\nT ( su(N),CP1 \\ 4pt, suitable data ) =\nSU(N)\nU(1) SU(N)\nU(1)\nSU(N) (4.23)\nIn the N = 2 case the u(N) = u(2) symmetry enhances to so(4), namely the u(1) factor enhances to su(2). For N > 2 in contrast we have to deal with the presence of different kinds of punctures. We delay the full story to subsection 7.2. For now we shall be content with using two types of tame punctures: full punctures that carry su(N) flavour symmetry and simple punctures that carry u(1).\nFrom the 6d point of view, the u(2N) flavour symmetry of conformal su(N) SQCD is an accidental IR symmetry, as it is not a symmetry of the 6d N = (2, 0) setup.\nFree hypermultiplets. The left and right sides of the quiver (4.23) consist of N2 hypermultiplets that each have u(1) \u00d7 su(N)2 flavour symmetry (actually more before gauging), of which one su(N) factor is gauged. This collection of N2 free hypermultiplets is the tinkertoy associated to a sphere with two full and one simple puncture.\nPunctures. Following the general ideas from the su(2) case the full punctures are described as a boundary condition like (4.2):\n\u03d5(z) \u223c (\nmi z \u2212 zi\n+O(1) ) dz =\u21d2 \u03c6k(z) = ((\u22121)k+1\u03c3k(mi)\n(z \u2212 zi)k +O ( 1 (z \u2212 zi)k\u22121 )) dzk,\n(4.24) for mi \u2208 su(N), where the symmetric polynomials \u03c3k(mi) are defined by expanding det(X \u2212mi) = XN + \u2211 k\u22652X\nN\u2212k(\u22121)k\u03c3k(mi). The condition on \u03d5(z) should be understood modulo conjugation, hence only the conjugacy class of mi is important.\nWe return in subsection 7.2 to a description of conjugacy classes in su(N)C = sl(N,C). For now, it suffices to mention simple punctures, whose mass parameters take the form mi = diag((N \u2212 1)\u00b5,\u2212\u00b5, . . . ,\u2212\u00b5). As a result, the massless limit where mi becomes\n37As in various other places in this review there are inaccuracies about the global structure of groups. Corrections welcome.\nnilpotent (see (4.4) for the N = 2 case) is different for full and simple punctures:\n\u03c6k(z) = O ( 1 (z \u2212 zi)k\u22121 ) dzk (massless full puncture),\n\u03c6k(z) = O ( 1\n(z \u2212 zi)\n) dzk (massless simple puncture).\n(4.25)\nExercise 4.13. 1. Massless case. Find the most general degree k \u2265 2 differential on the three-punctured sphere with a simple pole at z = 1 and poles of order k \u2212 1 at z = 0,\u221e. Deduce the SW curve of the class S theory corresponding to a sphere with one simple and two full punctures and deduce the theory has no Coulomb branch, consistent with free hypermultiplets. 2. Massive case. For N = 3, evaluate det(x \u2212 \u03d5z) near a simple puncture \u03d5(z) \u223c( (z \u2212 1)\u22121m + p ) dz with m = diag(2\u00b5,\u2212\u00b5,\u2212\u00b5). Observe that the (z \u2212 1)\u2212k terms in ud(z), for k, d = 2, 3, are expressed in terms of the (z \u2212 1)\u22121 terms and of \u00b5. Deduce that there is again no Coulomb branch.\n3. Massless case. Write the most general degree k \u2265 2 differential on the n-punctured sphere with order k\u22121 poles (full punctures) at 0,\u221e and simple poles (simple punctures) at q1, . . . , qn\u22123, 1. Write the SW curve and check that the Coulomb branch has dimension (n\u2212 3)(N \u2212 1), consistent with the quiver (4.26) below.\nLinear quiver gauge theory. Starting with collections of N2 free hypermultiplets, identifying pairs of su(N) symmetries, and gauging them using vector multiplets, we find\nT ( su(N),CP1 \\ {0, z1, . . . , zn\u22122,\u221e} ) =\nSU(N)\nU(1) SU(N) U(1) SU(N) U(1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 U(1) SU(N)\nU(1)\nSU(N)\n(4.26)\nwhere we have underlined the simple punctures (so that only 0 and \u221e are full punctures). This linear quiver gauge theory description corresponds to a specific degeneration limit of the Riemann surface. We emphasize that other limits would involve more elaborate tinkertoys, which do not typically have any Lagrangian description unless every pair of pants involves a simple puncture. As found in Exercise 4.13, the SW curve in the massless case reads\nxN = N\u2211 k=2\nP (k) n\u22124(z)\n(z \u2212 z1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (z \u2212 zn\u22122)zk\u22121 xN\u2212k (4.27)\nwhere P (k)n\u22124 denote polynomials of degree n\u2212 4. Exercise 4.14. Consider the degeneration limit where each zi+1/zi is kept fixed (and |zi+1/zi| > 1) except zj+1/zj \u2192 +\u221e for some j. Check that the part of the curve with finite x/zj takes the form (4.27) with n replaced by j + 2 and additional mass terms. In particular the new puncture is a full puncture.\nBrane construction. We know that the 6d (2, 0) theory X (su(N)) is the world-volume theory of a stack of N coincident M5 branes (minus the center of mass). The Riemann surface in (4.26) can be taken to be a cylinder, with some punctures. Then the brane setup can be described by N M5 branes wrapping the cylinder, with the insertion of transverse M5\u2019 branes at n\u2212 2 points on the cylinder.\nNow, M-theory on a circle is IIA string theory, M5 branes wrapping the circle become D4 branes, while M5\u2019 branes at points on the circle become NS5 branes. This gives a well-known brane set-up [178] with N D4 brane segments stretching between each pair of neighboring NS5 branes:\nNS5 D4\n(4.28)\nThe world-volume description of this brane diagram is known to be the linear quiver gauge theory (4.26). Mass parameters of the two SU(N) flavour symmetries are positions (vertically in the figure) of the semi-infinite D4 branes on either end. Mass parameters of all U(1) flavour symmetries are distances between centers of masses of each collection of N D4 branes. The remaining vertical positions are dynamical and appear on the gauge theory side as Coulomb branch parameters. The SW curve and differential of the linear quiver can be extracted from this construction [178] and coincides with what is found from the 6d perspective.\nIt is very easy in the brane diagram to accomodate gauge group ranks that are not all the same. We outline in subsection 7.2 how to realize such theories in class S.\nPart II\nAGT correspondence"

In subsection 5.2 we reduce the infinitedimensional path integral to a finitedimensional one (a matrix model) in the Lagrangian case using supersymmetric localization. The resulting expression is built from Nekrasov instanton partition functions, which we explore in subsection 5.3. Supersymmetric localization implies that some factorization properties remain true even for non-Lagrangian theories, see subsection 5.4.\nLocalization on the round sphere was done in [10] and extended to the squashed sphere in [11] based on some analogous developments on 3d squashed spheres [184, 185].

            "text": "An easy case: the round sphere. Placing an SCFT on a round sphere S4 is in principle39 straightforward: just apply a conformal transformation to the flat space theory since the sphere is conformally flat. The 4d N = 2 superconformal algebra on S4 is then the same as on R4, namely su\u2217(4|2), whose bosonic part is the conformal algebra su\u2217(4) = so(5, 1) times the R-symmetry algebras u(1) and su\u2217(2) = su(2).\nThe class S theories we study (for tame punctures) are mass deformations of SCFTs. They can thus be placed on S4 by conformally mapping the SCFT to the sphere, then turning on masses as background values for vector multiplet scalars coupled to the various flavour symmetries. Mass terms turn out to break half of supersymmetry, break the conformal algebra to the rotation algebra so(5) = usp(4), and the R-symmetry to so(2) = so\u2217(2). Altogether one can work out that massive theories preserve the supersymmetry subalgebra\nosp\u2217(2|4) \u2282 su\u2217(2|4). (5.2) 39Identifying operators in flat space and on the sphere is subtle, as there can be some mixing involving\ncurvature tensors. This was understood for 4d N = 2 theories in [192].\nNote that this differs quite a bit from the Poincar\u00e9 algebra preserved by massive theories on R4: for instance spatial isometries of R4 are iso(4) = R4 o so(4) while here we have the usp(4) = so(5) rotation algebra.\nThe AGT correspondence involves an ellipsoid (often called squashed sphere) S4b and not only S4. The squashed sphere is not conformally flat, and defining theories on this background requires technology that we now explain.\nConformal Killing vectors. We are interested in QFTs on rigid curved spaces (no dynamical gravity). Placing a Poincar\u00e9-invariant QFT on a curved space is done by coupling the theory to gravity and freezing the value of the metric40. Invariance under changes of coordinates leads to the existence of a conserved stress tensor (\u2207\u03bdT\u00b5\u03bd = 0). As the next exercise shows, the resulting curved-space theory preserves some space-time (Poincar\u00e9) symmetries provided the metric admits Killing vectors Y\u00b5, defined by the Killing vector equation \u2207\u00b5Y\u03bd + \u2207\u03bdY\u00b5 = 0. More generally if the flat-space QFT is conformal, isometry and conformal symmetries of the CFT are given by conformal Killing vectors\n\u2207\u00b5Y\u03bd +\u2207\u03bdY\u00b5 = 2 d g\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u03c1Y \u03c1. (5.3)\nExercise 5.1. 1. A Poincar\u00e9-invariant local QFT has a conserved stress-tensor T\u00b5\u03bd that is symmetric. Check that the current Y\u00b5T\u00b5\u03bd is conserved if Y is a Killing vector.\n2. If the flat-space QFT is conformally invariant, T\u00b5\u03bd is traceless as well. Check that Y\u00b5T\n\u00b5\u03bd is then conserved provided Y is a conformal Killing vector. Hint: explain the factor 2/d in (5.3) by taking the trace of the equation.\nConformal Killing spinors. Consider now a supersymmetric theory. This means that there are conserved supersymmetry currents G\u00b5\u03b1 and G\u0303\u03b1\u0307\u00b5, where \u00b5 is a vector index of the SO(4) rotation group, and \u03b1 = 1, 2 and \u03b1\u0307 = 1, 2 are spinor indices with both chiralities. Leaving the spinor index of G\u00b5 implicit, the conservation equation reads\nD\u00b5G \u00b5 := \u2207\u00b5G\u00b5 + 1 4\u03c9\u00b5 ab\u03b3a\u03b3bG \u00b5 = 0 (5.4)\nwhere \u2207 is the Levi\u2013Civita connection of the given metric, \u03c9 its spin connection, a, b are vielbein indices, and \u03b3 are Dirac matrices.\nTo get a usual conserved translation current from the conserved stress-tensor in flat space one contracts T\u00b5\u03bd with a constant translation vector a\u00b5. Likewise here we have usual currents \u03beG\u00b5 = \u03be\u03b1G\u00b5\u03b1 and \u03be\u0303G\u0303\u00b5 = \u03be\u0303\u03b1\u0307G\u03b1\u0307\u00b5 for constant41 spinors \u03be. In curved space we can check that \u03beG\u00b5 is conserved provided \u03be is a Killing spinor:\nD\u00b5\u03be := ( \u2202\u00b5 +\n1 4\u03c9 ab \u00b5 \u03b3a\u03b3b\n) \u03be = 0. (5.5)\n40To be precise, if the theory has spinors one must additionally give a spin structure rather than only the metric (for instance giving a vielbein is enough).\n41Here we use a common abuse of language: talking about constant spinors requires a choice of vielbein, for which we choose the standard Cartesian one on flat space.\n(Note that we put \u2202 instead of \u2207 because \u03be has no vector index.) Just as a theory is conformally invariant if x\u00b5T\u00b5\u03bd is conserved, a theory is superconformally invariant if x\u03bd\u03b3\u03bdG\u00b5 is conserved in the same sense as (5.4). When put on curved space, the theory now has super(conformal) symmetries if the spacetime admits a conformal Killing spinor\nD\u00b5\u03be = 1 d \u03b3\u00b5\u03b3 \u03bdD\u03bd\u03be. (5.6)\nExercise 5.2. Check that (5.6) indeed leads to a conserved current \u03beG if the theory is superconformal.\nGeneralized Killing spinors. We defined the (partial) topological twist in subsection 3.1 as a mixing of some rotations and R-symmetries, which allowed us to compactify the 6d (2, 0) theory on a Riemann surface C. This idea is refined and generalized as follows whenever the flat-space theory has an R-symmetry current J\u00b5. When placing the QFT on curved space we can turn on a background gauge field V\u00b5 coupled to J\u00b5 in addition to the metric g\u00b5\u03bd that is coupled to T\u00b5\u03bd (we typically don\u2019t turn on fermionic backgrounds coupled to supersymmetry currents).\nIn such a background, the Killing spinor equation (5.5) generalizes by including the R-symmetry gauge field in the covariant derivative:\nD\u00b5\u03be := ( \u2202\u00b5 +\n1 4\u03c9 ab \u00b5 \u03b3a\u03b3b + V\u00b5\n) \u03be = 0. (5.7)\nThe conformal Killing spinor equation generalizes in the same way to (5.6) with the new D\u00b5. Here V\u00b5\u03be should be suitably weighted by the R-charge under the given Rsymmetry, as is standard for covariant derivatives in the presence of a gauge field. The (partial) topological twist consists of choosing V\u00b5 to cancel some component of \u03c9ab\u00b5 so that the corresponding component of \u03be can simply be chosen to be constant (along C). More general choices for the background gauge field V can make it possible to preserve some supersymmetries even if the curved manifold of interest does not have any (conformal) Killing spinors.\nSquashed sphere. The supergravity background found in [11] to place 4d N = 2 theories on S4b is rather complicated and gives non-zero values to most bosonic fields in the supergravity multiplet. We point to the review [126] for actual expressions. For our purposes we only need two aspects. The metric is the one induced from that of Euclidean R5 in the embedding\nS4b := { y25 + b2(y21 + y22) + b\u22122(y23 + y24) = r2} \u2282 R5. (5.8)\nParts of 4d N = 2 supersymmetry remain: U(1)2 rotations M12 and M34 in the y1, y2 and y3, y4 planes, and a supercharge Q (and its conjugate) such that\nQ2 = b r (M12 \u2212 12J R 3 ) + 1 br (M34 \u2212 12J R 3 ) (5.9)\nwhere JR3 is the Cartan generator of su(2)R."

            "text": "The idea of supersymmetric localization is several decades old when applied to scalar supercharges of topologically twisted field theories. It received a new life since Pestun\u2019s calculation in 2007 [10] of the sphere partition function of 4dN = 2 theories, and of Wilson loop expectation values. In the following decade the technique was sucessfully applied to many dimensions (from 1d to 7d and even continuous dimensions) and geometries (such as spheres Sd, products Sd\u22121 \u00d7 S1, hemispheres and other spaces with boundaries), as summarized in the 2016 review volume [125]. Besides the applications to understanding supersymmetric theories and black hole state counting, the resulting expressions are often complicated special functions with an interest of their own. We introduce here the technique and present in subsection 5.4 a variant that explains various factorization properties.\nSet-up for supersymmetric localization. Our goal is to compute a path integral\n\u3008O\u3009 = \u222b [D\u03c6]e\u2212SO (5.10)\nthat is invariant under some supercharge Q (we denote collectively all the fields as \u03c6). This means that the action and path integration measure are Q-invariant (QS = 0 and\u222b\n[D\u03c6]Q(anything) = 0) and that the observable also is (QO = 0). Roughly speaking, the integrand is invariant along orbits of Q in the space of field configurations, so the integral on each non-trivial orbit is the Grassmann integral of a constant hence vanishes.\nRecipe for supersymmetric localization\n\u2022 Choose a supergravity background onM with at least one generalized conformal Killing spinor \u03be, so that the theory onM has at least one supersymmetry Q. Realize it off-shell. \u2022 Choose a fermionic functional V that is Q2-invariant and has (QV )bosonic \u2265 0 on the path integral contour. \u2022 Find zeros of (QV )bosonic, which will be the resulting integration locus, often finite-dimensional. \u2022 Expand (QV )bosonic to quadratic order around these zeros and compute the Gaussian integral (one-loop determinants).\nIntuitively, this ought to reduce the integral to Q-invariant field configurations.\nSupersymmetric localization is based on the path integral so we need the supersymmetry Q to be realized off-shell, not only on-shell. For highly supersymmetric theories (such as 4d N = 2), realizing all supersymmetries on-shell requires infinitely many auxiliary fields, but only a finite number are typically needed to realize a single supercharge off-shell.\nThe key idea of supersymmetric localization is to deform the action S in a way that does not affect \u3008O\u3009 yet suppresses contributions from most configurations, thus reducing the path integral down to a smaller space of configurations. Typically one arranges to make this smaller space finite-dimensional so as to get a well-defined finite-dimensional integral, but it can also be interesting to get a lower-dimensional field theory.\nConcretely, one needs some functional of the fields with three properties: it is Qexact (namely of the form QV ), Q-closed (namely V is invariant under the bosonic\nsymmetry Q2), and has nonnegative bosonic part on the path integration contour we wish to consider. A typical choice is roughly speaking a sum over all fermions of the theory (collectively denoted as \u03c8) of the form\nV = \u2211\nall spinors \u03c8 \u03c8Q\u03c8 =\u21d2 (QV )bosonic = \u2211 \u03c8 |Q\u03c8|2 (5.11)\nfor a suitable definition of the conjugate Q\u03c8 which ensures positivity of (Q\u03c8)Q\u03c8 along the path integral contour.\nSaddle-point calculation. Once such a term is chosen, we deform the action by tQV for t \u2208 [0,+\u221e) and notice that the observable is unaffected since\n\u3008O\u3009t = \u222b [D\u03c6]e\u2212S\u2212tQVO\n=\u21d2 \u2202t\u3008O\u3009t = \u2212 \u222b [D\u03c6]e\u2212S\u2212tQVOQV = \u2212 \u222b [D\u03c6]Q ( e\u2212S\u2212tQVO V ) = 0.\n(5.12)\nHere we used that QO = 0 = Q(S + tQV ) to write the integrand as Q of something. The observable is t-independent, so we can take the limit t\u2192\u221e, in which limit the saddle-point approximation becomes exact. In addition, any saddle with (QV )bosonic > 0 is infinitely suppressed by e\u2212tQV . Since we assumed QV \u2265 0, in this limit we are left with an integral over field configurations with QV = 0 and the Gaussian integral of quadratic fluctuations around it:\n\u3008O\u3009 = \u3008O\u3009t=0 = lim t\u2192\u221e \u3008O\u3009t = \u222b QV=0 [D\u03c6]e\u2212S[\u03c6]Zone-loop[\u03c6]O[\u03c6]. (5.13)\nHere we wrote schematically \u222b QV=0, but this may also involve discrete sums if the space of zeros of QV is disconnected. Here Zone-loop[\u03c6] is the result of a Gaussian integral of exp(\u2212tQV ) around a field configuration \u03c6 that is a zero of QV .\nCalculating the one-loop determinant Zone-loop is often the most technical step. It is determined by the quadratic terms (QV )2 in QV , and more precisely is a ratio of determinants of the fermionic and bosonic parts of (QV )2. In sufficiently simple geometries one can explicitly diagonalize these operators by listing all the modes and regularize the infinite products over modes using e.g. zeta-function regularization. The calculation involves huge cancellations, due to how the supercharge Q pairs up most bosonic and fermionic modes together. Roughly, only modes that are annihilated by Q contribute, and this observation helps extend the cases where one-loop determinants can be evaluated in a pedestrian manner. Finally, this latter calculation can be much simplified by using powerful index theorems. We refer to the review volume [125] for details. Exercise 5.3. 1. Remind yourself that for a symmetric n \u00d7 n matrix \u2206 we have the Gaussian integral \u222b Rn dnx exp(\u2212xT\u2206x) = \u221a det(\u03c0/\u2206).\n2. Consider next n pairs of Grassmann variables \u03b81, \u03b8\u03041, . . . , \u03b8n, \u03b8\u0304n and an n \u00d7 n matrix D, and evaluate the Berezin integral \u222b dn\u03b8dn\u03b8\u0304 exp(\u2212\u03b8\u0304.D.\u03b8) = \u00b1detD.\nIn concrete QFT applications, the bosonic operator \u2206 is roughly the Laplacian and the fermionic operator D is roughly the Dirac operator, so that \u2206 \u223c D2 and their one-loop determinants mostly cancel.\nSaddle-points on ellipsoid. We now apply localization to 4d N = 2 theories on the squashed sphere S4b . We take the standard deformation term (5.11) where the sum ranges over quarks \u03c8 (hypermultiplet spinors) and gauginos \u03bb (vector multiplet spinors). The resulting QV is pretty similar to the 4d N = 2 action of these multiplets, and we only mention what is needed to determine the space (QV )bosonic = 0.\nSupersymmetric localization relies on the existence of a supercharge Q that is an off-shell symmetry. This requires the addition of some auxiliary fields K to the 4d N = 2 theory. For now we focus on the sphere [10], restoring the squashing only in the final expressions [11].\nFor the hypermultiplet we have\n(QVhyper)bosonic = |Dq|2 + |Dq\u0303|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ R 6 |q| 2 + R6 |q\u0303| 2 + |Kq|2. (5.14)\nHere, R is the Ricci scalar, which is positive: this term arises upon conformally mapping |Dq|2 from flat space to the sphere. The \u201c. . . \u201d are also a sum of squares, so the zero locus has the whole hypermultiplet set to zero:\nq = q\u0303 = Kq = 0, (5.15)\nand fermions as well since they are Grassmann variables. For the vector multiplet we have similar terms with q, q\u0303 replaced by the vector multiplet scalar \u03c6, but we also have terms like |F\u00b5\u03bd |2 and terms due to the supergravity background. Eventually (the bosonic part of) the deformation term can be massaged to a sum of squares of the form\n(QV )vector,bosonic = r \u2212 x0 2r ( F\u2212\u00b5\u03bd + w\u2212\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6 )2 + r + x02r (F+\u00b5\u03bd + w+\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6)2 + |D\u03c6|2 + [\u03c6, \u03c6\u2020]2 + |K\u03c6,i + wi Im\u03c6|2.\n(5.16)\nHere F\u2212 and F+ are the (anti)-self-dual parts of the gauge field strength, K\u03c6,i, i = 1, 2, 3 are auxiliary fields (a triplet of su(2)R), and w\u00b1\u00b5\u03bd and wi are determined by the supergravity background.\nLet us find zeros of (5.16). Each term must vanish, so in particular \u03c6 is covariantly constant (D\u03c6 = 0). Away from the poles x0 = \u00b1r, we have F\u00b1\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212w\u00b1\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6 so F\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212w\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6 where w = w+ + w\u2212. Then the Bianchi identities imply\n0 = D\u00b5F\u00b5\u03bd = D\u00b5(\u2212w\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6) = \u2212(\u2202\u00b5w\u00b5\u03bd) Re\u03c6\u2212 w\u00b5\u03bd Re(D\u00b5\u03c6) (5.17)\nand the last term vanish since D\u00b5\u03c6 = 0. In the specific supergravity background we have here, \u2202\u00b5w\u00b5\u03bd 6= 0, so we learn that Re\u03c6 = 0, hence F\u00b5\u03bd = 0. Thus, in a suitable gauge the gauge field vanishes and\nA\u00b5 = 0, \u03c6 = a, K\u03c6,i = \u2212wia away from poles, (5.18)\nfor a constant a. At the poles x0 = \u00b1r, on the other hand, we only have one of the two equations F\u00b1\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212w\u00b1\u00b5\u03bd Re\u03c6, while the other part of F\u00b5\u03bd is unconstrained. This suggests to include point-like instanton configurations at the poles:\ninstantons (F+ = 0) at x0 = r; anti-instantons (F\u2212 = 0) at x0 = \u2212r. (5.19)\nLet us concentrate on the North pole x0 = r. Instanton configurations are insensitive to matter, so that the instanton moduli space Minst is a product, over simple gauge group factors, of a moduli space of instantons for each gauge group. This, in turn, splits as a union of infinitely many connected components, labeled by the instanton number k = # \u222b Tr(F \u2227 F ) \u2208 Z\u22650 (for some calculable constant #), with one instanton number\nper gauge group. Altogether, denoting the gauge group by \u220fI GI , Minst =\n\u220f I ( \u2294 kI\u22650 MGI ,kI ) . (5.20)\nReality of Coulomb branch parameter and masses. The condition Re a = 0 simply means that a \u2208 g rather than the complexification thereof. We gauge-fix it so that it belongs to the Cartan subalgebra h modulo the Weyl group. The reality condition is then that \u3008w, a\u3009 \u2208 iR, for every weight w. (5.21) For instance, a is anti-Hermitian for g = su(N).\nThis reality condition arose here from studying saddle-points of the deformation term, but the same condition also derives from requiring the configuration to be Q-invariant. As explained previously, hypermultiplet masses m simply amount to constant background values for vector multiplet scalars. Thus, the reality condition (5.21) is also required for masses in order for them to preserve the supercharge Q used by supersymmetric localization. In other words, curved-space supersymmetry on S4b requires masses to be imaginary.\nResult for round and squashed sphere. Saddle-point configurations defined by (5.15), (5.18), (5.19) are thus characterized by a choice, for each gauge group, of an imaginary Coulomb branch parameter a and point-like (anti)-instanton configurations at the poles. For any such saddle-point we compute the classical action\nScl = \u2212Re(2\u03c0i\u03c4) Tr(ra)2 + 2\u03c0i\u03c4n\u2212 2\u03c0i\u03c4n, \u03c4 = \u03b8 2\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i g2 , (5.22)\nwhere the radius r of the (squashed) sphere (5.8) makes the first term dimensionless. We refer to [126] for the computation of one-loop determinants (Gaussian integral) capturing the effect of quadratic fluctuations around the saddle-points. For the zero (anti)-instanton saddle, one gets\nZone-loop = Zvectorone-loopZ hyper one-loop for k = k = 0. (5.23)\nHere, the vector multiplet one-loop determinant is a product over roots \u03b1 of all gauge group factors (non-zero weights of the adjoint representation),42\nZvectorone-loop = \u220f \u03b1\u2208\u2206 \u03a5b(\u3008\u03b1, ra\u3009), (5.24)\nwhere \u03a5b is a special function defined in Appendix A. We emphasize that its argument here is purely imaginary. The hypermultiplet one-loop determinant is a product over weights w (with multiplicity) of the representation in which the hypermultiplet transforms,\nZhyperone-loop = \u220f w\u2208R 1 \u03a5b ( b+1/b 2 + \u3008w, ra\u3009 ) . (5.25)\nAs explained previously, hypermultiplet masses are simply background values for vector multiplet scalars corresponding to flavour symmetries, so adding a mass m in (5.25) simply changes\n\u03a5b ( b+ 1/b 2 + \u3008w, ra\u3009 ) \u2192 \u03a5b ( b+ 1/b 2 + \u3008w, ra\u3009+ rm ) . (5.26)\nImportantly, hypermultiplets in the representations R and R are equivalent (with mass m \u2192 \u2212m) and one checks that the symmetry \u03a5b(b + 1/b \u2212 x) = \u03a5b(x) ensures that the one-loop determinant (5.25) computed with both presentations is the same. For a half-hypermultiplet in a pseudoreal representation R ' R one should keep only one factor for each pair of conjugate weights; thanks to the same symmetry of \u03a5b it does not matter which weight one selects in each pair. As expected all factors are invariant under the b\u2192 1/b symmetry of S4b thanks to \u03a5b = \u03a51/b.\nOne-loop determinants can be further understood as products of contributions from both hemispheres, essentially by decomposing each \u03a5b function as \u03a5b(x) = 1/(\u0393b(x) \u0393b(b+ 1/b\u2212 x)). (Anti)-instantons at each pole only affect one-loop contributions from the corresponding hemisphere, which leads to a factorization property of the form\nZone-loop(a, k, \u03be, k, \u03be) = Zone-loop(a)Zone-loop,inst(a, k, \u03be)Zone-loop,inst(a, k, \u03be) (5.27)\nwhere \u03be \u2208MG,k and \u03be \u2208MG,k parametrize the instanton configurations and Zone-loop(a) is the ratio of \u03a5b written above.\nAltogether, collecting all (anti)-instanton contributions together, including the classical contributions expressed in terms of q = exp(2\u03c0i\u03c4), the partition function reads\nZS4 b\n= \u222b daZcl(a, qq)Zone-loop(a)Zinst(a, q)Zinst(a, q). (5.28)\nHere, the integral ranges over the Cartan algebras of all gauge groups, Zone-loop is given above, and the exponent in Zcl = exp(\u2212Scl) = |q|r\n2|a|2 involves the Killing form 42To be precise, we have included here in Zvectorone-loop the Vandermonde determinant \u220f \u03b1\u2208\u2206(\u3008\u03b1, ra\u3009) that\narises when converting from an integral over the whole gauge algebra g to its Cartan subalgebra.\n|a|2 = \u2212Tr(a2) of the Lie algebra and is positive since a is imaginary. We collected into Zinst the shift of Scl due to instantons, and Zone-loop,inst, suitably integrated over the instanton moduli space,\nZinst(a, q) = \u2211\nall kI\u22650\n(\u220f I qkII )\u222b\u220f I MGI,kI Zone-loop,inst(a, k, \u03be) d\u03be.

            "text": "Omega background. The point-like configurations in (5.19) are only sensitive to the leading expansion of the supergravity background around the poles. This supergravity background has a flat metric and a non-trivial graviphoton, and coincides with the Omega background R4 1, 2 discovered by Nekrasov [12], with parameters 1 = b/r, 2 = 1/(rb). It was thus naturally conjectured in [10, 11] (and later works) that in the expression (5.28) of ZS4 b , the function Zinst(a, q) = 1 +O(q1) to be included is the partition function of the 4d N = 2 theory on the Omega background R4 1, 2 , called Nekrasov\u2019s instanton partition function [12, 13]. We refer to reviews [116, 127] for a more detailed introduction to Zinst.\nThe Omega background tends to R4 as 1, 2 \u2192 0, and can be understood as a regulator for IR divergences due to non-compactness of R4. In fact, as explained in [12, 13] and the appendix of [193], the partition function gives the low-energy prepotential of the gauge theory:43\nF (a, q) = Fpert(a, q) + lim 1, 2\u21920\n( 1 2 logZinst(a, q; 1, 2) ) , (5.30)\nwhere Fpert results from a one-loop computation and can be extracted from Zone-loop. In this way, the instanton partition function gives access to the low-energy dynamics of the 4d N = 2 theory at a point a along the Coulomb branch. The whole SW curve can then be rigorously derived, as done in [13, 194, 195]. The derivation relies on a link with the theory of random partitions.\nThe Omega background can also be obtained as the \u03b2 \u2192 0 limit of a 5d background S1\u03b2 \u00d7 1, 2 R4 defined as the quotient of R\u00d7 C\u00d7 C under the identification (x, z1, z2) \u223c (x+ \u03b2, ei\u03b2 1z1, ei\u03b2 2z2). Many 4d N = 2 Lagrangian theory can be lifted to a 5d N = 1 theory, in which case the instanton partition function Zinst has a 5d analogue defined as the partition function on S1\u03b2 \u00d7 1, 2 R4. It is also worth mentioning developments in how to construct the Omega background in string theory and M-theory [196\u2013200].\nComputation methods. The instanton partition function is an integral over the moduli space of instantons with an integrand depending on matter. As mentioned above, this moduli space decomposes as a product over simple gauge group factors, and the\n43The prepotential is the Lagrangian density in N = 2 superspace, and it encodes fully the low-energy dynamics of U(1) gauge fields at a generic point on the Coulomb branch. We point to reviews such as [115] for more discussion of this crucial function.\nmoduli space for each gauge group factor has one connected component for each instanton number k \u2265 0, with dimensions growing with k. There are several methods to compute the instanton partition function [127].44\n\u2022 ADHM construction. For classical gauge groups U (rather than SU), USp, SO the n-instanton moduli space can be realized as a symplectic quotient through the Atiyah\u2013Drinfeld\u2013Hitchin\u2013Manin (ADHM) construction [201], while no such constructions are available in general for the exceptional groups E6,E7,E8,F4,G2, nor for SU. Physically, the ADHM construction expresses the instanton moduli space as the moduli space of a supersymmetric matrix model, describing D(\u22121) brane instantons in a background of D3 branes and O3 planes that realize 4d N = 2 vector multiplets [202\u2013204]. The matrix model is known for hypermultiplets in suitable representation (e.g. bifundamental). Localization then reduces Zinst from an integral over the whole moduli space down to a discrete sum of contributions from collections of point-like instantons respecting certain U(1) symmetries. We give the resulting formula for U(N) gauge theories in (5.33), below. This Losev\u2013Moore\u2013Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili (LMNS) formula was obtained in [205\u2013207], derived in [12], and extended to other classical groups in [208\u2013210], to quivers in [194], and to supergroup theories in [211]. These methods apply to 5d N = 1 lifts of these theories: the S1\u03b2 \u00d7 1, 2 R4 instanton partition function matches the supersymmetric index of a quantum mechanics analogue of the matrix model (see e.g. [212, 213]).\n\u2022 Pure 4d N = 2 SYM. For exceptional gauge groups there is no ADHM construction. The one-instanton moduli space is (C2 times) the orbit under G of the highest weight vector of its adjoint representation. This allows a group-theoretic calculation of one-instanton partition functions for arbitrary gauge groups in pure SYM [99, 214, 215]. This was extended to two instantons in [216]. Instead of realizing the k-instanton moduli space as a Higgs branch as in the ADHM construction, it can be realized as the Coulomb branch of a 3d N = 4 SCFT. The Coulomb branch Hilbert series (a specialization of the superconformal index) of this 3d theory then gives the k-instanton partition function of pure SYM on S1\u03b2 \u00d7 1, 2 R4 with an arbitrary gauge group [217]. The instanton partition function for pure En SYM theory can be determined from the Hall\u2013Littlewood index of the En Minahan\u2013Nemeschansky theory, calculated using the TQFT realization of this index discussed in subsection 9.2.\n\u2022 Mass-deformed 4d N = 4 SYM. For 4d N = 2\u2217 SYM, which interpolates between N = 4 and N = 2 SYM as the mass is varied, the prepotential (or its Omegadeformation) is expected to obey a modular anomaly equation that describes how it transforms under S-duality [218, 219]. This led to a formula for the prepotential in terms of Eisenstein series for arbitrary gauge groups [220\u2013223]. This technique extends somewhat, for instance to conformal SQCD [224, 225].\n44I thank Jaewon Song for correspondence on some methods.\n\u2022 Recursion relations. Comparing the instanton partition function to the partition function on the blow-up of C2 yields recursion relations (see [226\u2013228] and references therein). For hypermultiplets (but not half-hypermultiplets) in a large class of representations of both classical and exceptional gauge groups, one can solve these recursion relations and deduce Zinst from the perturbative (one-loop) partition function.\nSome matter representations escape all the available methods: most notably, general Lagrangians constructed from SU(2) vector multiplets and trifundamental halfhypermultiplets, which are the Lagrangian descriptions of SU(2) class S theories. Among these theories, Zinst is known whenever the theory can be written with gauge groups SU(2) and SO(4) = (SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2))/Z2 and bifundamental matter (of two SU(2) groups or of an SU(2) and an SO(4) group); see [96, 98]. A possible way forward relies on the topological vertex formalism [229].\nNekrasov partition functions have many generalizations, such as on ALE space [82, 230\u2013235] and more general spaces [236\u2013238], spiked instantons [239], and a proposed generalization to 4d N = 1 theories [240].\nExplicit formula for linear quiver gauge theories. We focus now on the linear quiver gauge theory\nSU(N1) SU(N2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 SU(Np)\nM1 M2 Mp (5.31)\nwhich is a slight generalization (allowing Ni to be distinct) of those in subsection 4.4. This theory has gauge group \u220fpi=1 SU(Ni), one hypermultiplet in each bifundamental representation Ni \u2297 Ni+1, and Mi hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation Ni of each group. If the theory is conformal or asymptotically free, namely the beta-function coefficient bj = 2Nj \u2212Nj\u22121 \u2212Nj+1 \u2212Mj is non-negative, then it can be realized in class S using quiver tails, see (7.15).\nExtending the gauge groups from SU(Ni) to U(Ni) allows the theory to be realized in IIA string theory, as the world-volume theory of groups of Ni parallel D4 branes stretched between consecutive NS5 branes, together with Mi transverse D6 branes that give rise to fundamental hypermultiplets, as depicted in Figure 3. Instantons are described as D0 branes also stretching between NS5 branes, and Zinst is the partition function of their world-volume theory, summed over the number of D0 branes. Eventually, one must remove spurious factors caused by the additional U(1) gauge groups.\nWe denote the Coulomb branch parameter ai = {ai1, . . . , aiNi} for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p, and by ki the number of instantons for U(Ni), namely the number of D0 branes in the i-th interval between NS5 branes. Then\nZinst [\u220f U(Ni) ] = \u2211\nk1\u22650,...,kp\u22650 zk11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 z kp p Z (k) inst, (5.32)\nwhere the counting parameters zj encode the dynamical scale \u039bj or gauge coupling \u03c4j\nof the j-th gauge group.45 The k-instanton contribution to Zinst is the matrix model contour integral\nZ (k) inst =\n\u222b d\u03c6\n\u220f i,F,I (miF \u2212 \u03c6iI) p\u22121\u220f i=1 [\u220f I,J S(\u03c6i+1J \u2212 \u03c6iI) \u220f A,J (\u03c6i+1J \u2212 aiA + 1 + 2) \u220f I,B (ai+1B \u2212 \u03c6iI) ]\n\u220f i [ ( 1 2 1+ 2 ) ki \u220f I 6=J S(\u03c6iI \u2212 \u03c6iJ) \u220f A,I (\u03c6iI \u2212 aiA + 1 + 2)(aiA \u2212 \u03c6iI) ]\n(5.33) where S(\u03c6) = \u2212(\u03c6+ 1)(\u03c6+ 2)/[\u03c6(\u2212\u03c6\u2212 1 \u2212 2)], indices run over the ranges that are natural given where they appear (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p, 1 \u2264 F \u2264 Mi, 1 \u2264 I \u2264 ki, 1 \u2264 J \u2264 ki+1, 1 \u2264 A \u2264 Ni, 1 \u2264 B \u2264 Ni+1), and d\u03c6 denotes a product of all d\u03c6iI . The first factor in the numerator captures the effect of fundamental hypermultiplets, the rest of the numerator comes from bifundamental hypermultiplets, and the denominator from vector multiplets.\nThe integrand can be understood from the IIA string theory construction depicted in Figure 3. The vector multiplet contribution (denominator) arises from strings stretching between different D0 branes in a given interval (1/S factors) and strings stretching between D0 and D4 branes (the remaining factors). The fundamental hypermultiplet contribution arises from strings connecting D0 and D6 branes. Strings joining D0 or D4 branes on two sides of an NS5 brane yield the bifundamental hypermultiplet contribution, in which one omits the D4-D4 interactions because they are already taken into account in Zone-loop.\nThe same formula can be obtained from first principles using the mathematically rigorous ADHM construction. The contour in (5.33) is such that it enclose poles at\n{\u03c6iI | 1 \u2264 I \u2264 ki} = {aiA + (r \u2212 1) 1 + (s\u2212 1) 2 | (r, s) \u2208 \u03bbiA} (5.34)\nfor each collection of Young diagrams \u03bbiA, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p, 1 \u2264 A \u2264 Ni with a total number of boxes equal to the instanton number, \u2211NiA=1|\u03bbiA| = ki. The set of poles (5.34) arises from a prescription called the Jeffrey\u2013Kirwan (JK) residue prescription, which follows from equivariant localization [210]. This prescription was also obtained from localization of the aforementioned ADHM supersymmetric matrix model [241\u2013244]. Exercise 5.4. Specialize these formulas to U(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 flavours (p = 1, N1 = 2, M1 = 4). Note that the four mass parameters m1B, B = 1, . . . , 4 can all be shifted by shifting the Coulomb branch parameters a1A, A = 1, 2. This is a shadow of the fact that in the U(2) theory we have only SU(Nf ) flavour symmetry, not SO(2Nf ) like for SU(2) SQCD. Compute the one-instanton contribution in Zinst. Start computing the two-instanton contribution to get an idea of the complexity: write the integrand and list the poles.\nU(1) factor. The brane realization of the theory required the gauging of U(1) symmetries to complete SU(Ni) into U(Ni) gauge groups. In this process, U(1) mass parameters\n45If bj = 2Nj \u2212Nj\u22121 \u2212Nj+1 \u2212Mj is positive then zj = \u039b bj j while if bj = 0 then zj is essentially e 2\u03c0i\u03c4j . To be precise there is some renormalization scheme ambiguity in what we mean by \u03c4j , as we discuss momentarily on page 56. The logic is rather to extract from Zinst the prepotential as a function of zj , deduce how IR couplings relate to zj , and finally invert the map if we want to express zj in terms of physically meaningful quantities.\nbecome dynamical vector multiplet scalars. Thankfully, Zinst is calculated for constant values of these scalars, so that we can simply set these Coulomb branch parameters to the U(1) mass parameters we started with.\nThe major problematic effect of the gauging is to introduce spurious instanton contributions from the U(1) gauge factor. After spending a week puzzled about a mismatch with 2d CFT conformal blocks, the authors of [5] proposed to divide out this spurious U(1) instanton contribution, schematically46\nZinst [\u220f SU(Ni) ] = Zinst [\u220f U(Ni) ] / ( U(1) factor ) . (5.35)\nThis U(1) factor is more readily singled out on the CFT side. Instanton partition functions for linear quivers of SU(N) gauge groups are expected to match conformal blocks of the WN algebra (Virasoro for N = 2), while U(N) gauge groups correspond to conformal blocks of WN times the Heisenberg chiral algebra. The difference (or rather ratio) of these two situations is thus given by a conformal block of the Heisenberg chiral algebra, namely a free field correlation function of chiral vertex operators. This point of view was understood in [14] for N = 2 and later extended in [245]. For the linear quiver considered here, the factor is schematically(\nU(1) factor ) ' \u220f 1\u2264i\u2264j\u2264p (1\u2212 zi \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 zj)cij (5.36)\nfor some exponents cij that are quadratic in the mass parameters.\nRenormalization schemes: an example. Given the issue of extracting the U(1) factor, and additional restrictions on which theories can be treated by brane constructions,\n46References welcome: it would be good to lay down the procedure nicely on the instanton partition function side, and I likely missed the correct reference.\npeople have sought other methods to determine Zinst. We present one method [96] that exemplifies a subtlety in comparing different results.\nBrane setups with orientifold planes gives access to Zinst for linear quivers with alternating USp and Spin groups. We return to such quivers and their class S construction at the end of subsection 7.2. One of the simplest examples is in fact a different description of SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 flavors:\nSpin(4) USp(2) Spin(4) = SU(2)\nSU(2) SU(2)\nSU(2) SU(2) . (5.37)\nMore generally, linear quivers of USp(2) = SU(2) and Spin(4) = SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2) gauge groups are equivalent to generalized SU(2) quivers. In simple enough cases such as (5.37) the instanton partition function can also be computed through the U(2) ADHM construction and removing U(1) factors (5.35). Surprisingly, the two methods yield different series in powers of the exponentiated gauge coupling qLag = e2\u03c0i\u03c4Lag , which would naively suggest an inconsistency!\nThe same issue showed up a long time ago when comparing SW solutions coming from different constructions of 4d N = 2 theories. It was resolved [246] by noting a renormalization scheme ambiguity in the definition of the couplings. We have already encountered this ambiguity in (4.20) when comparing the gauge coupling \u03c4Lag appearing in the Lagrangian of SU(2) SQCD to the position q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 arising in the class S construction of this same theory and found a relation \u03c4 = \u03c4Lag + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 with a constant shift and an infinite tower of instanton corrections.47\nLet us concentrate on (mass-deformed) SCFTs such as SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD, whose gauge couplings do not run, and let us simplify expressions by assuming there is a single gauge coupling. In two renormalization schemes that agree at leading order, the gauge coupling constants \u03c4, \u03c4\u0303 are related as\n\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 + \u2211 n\u22650 cne 2\u03c0in\u03c4 , (5.38)\nwhere the \u03c4 -independent coefficients cn are dimensionless. In concrete cases these coefficients are independent of Coulomb branch and mass parameters; assuming that the schemes agree at leading order throughout the parameter space, a possible argument is that the coefficients cn should be bounded functions of the Coulomb branch and mass parameters, hence must be constants by the Liouville theorem on analytic functions.\nThe U(2) and USp(2)\u2013Spin(4) approaches to Zinst are related in precisely this way, as understood in [96]. Consider SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 massless hypermultiplets. The quiver descriptions (5.37) correspond to seeing SQCD either as a reduction of X (so(4)) = X (su(2))\u2297X (su(2)) with Z2-automorphism twist defects, or a reduction of X (su(2)):\nT [ so(4),\n] = T su(2),  . (5.39)\n47In the AGT context, an early reference pointing out these instanton corrections is [247], see also [248] for an F-theory derivation.\nThe double-cover of the so(4) curve (cylinder with a branch cut) is the su(2) curve (four-punctured sphere). The relation between the modular parameter qso(4) of the cut cylinder and the IR coupling is fixed through the same considerations as for the modular parameter qsu(2) of the four-punctured sphere (4.20). This allows to relate them to each other,\nqso(4) = \u221a 16\u03bb(2\u03c4IR) = 16e\u03c0i\u03c4IR +O(e3\u03c0i\u03c4IR),\nqsu(2) = \u03bb(\u03c4IR) = qso(4) ( 1 + qso(4) 4 )\u22122 = 16e\u03c0i\u03c4IR \u2212 128e2\u03c0i\u03c4IR +O(e3\u03c0i\u03c4IR). (5.40)\nWhen comparing Nekrasov instanton partition functions, the non-trivial map between the counting parameters qsu(2) and qso(4) must be taken into account."

            "heading": "5.4 Cutting by localization",
            "text": "Supersymmetric localization without a Lagrangian. We have presented supersymmetric localization so far for Lagrangian theories, as the technique relies on a path-integral formulation. In the absence of a path-integral formulation we cannot deform the action S \u2192 S + tQV as before, but we can still deform an expectation value \u3008O\u3009 to \u3008Oe\u2212tQV \u3009. In the same way as in (5.12) this expectation value is t-independent provided the supercharge Q is not spontaneously broken in the state of interest, and QO = 0. In the t\u2192 +\u221e limit the observable \u3008O\u3009 should reduce in some sense to \u201czeros of (QV )bosonic\u201d, whenever such a notion can be defined.\nIn the following,48 using a deformation term for vector multiplets only, we decompose the partition function of a general class S theory into simple building blocks for any pants decomposition of C. On an orthogonal note, using a deformation term restricted to S3b \u2282 S4b , we factorize the partition function as the integral of a product of (anti)-holomorphic functions of q as in (5.28), for any theory whose 3d restriction is Lagrangian.\nCutting C by localizing vector multiplets. Higher-rank class S theories are typically non-Lagrangian, obtained by gauging common flavour symmetries of certain isolated SCFTs called tinkertoys (most notably TN ). Gauging symmetries, however, is performed using standard vector multiplets that are described by a standard path integral, with a gauge coupling \u03c4 just as in the Lagrangian case. This raises the prospect of applying supersymmetric localization to these vector multiplets.\nLet us make more explicit what we mean by gauging a flavour symmetry group G of some theory T (a product of tinkertoys). The G symmetry current multiplet in T is first coupled to a non-dynamical vector multiplet (A, \u03bb, \u03c6). The partition function ZT[A, \u03bb, \u03c6] depends on this background vector multiplet, whose components may be given any values (constant or not). Gauging consists of performing the path integral over the vector multiplet fields, so that the partition function of the gauged theory is\nZT,gauged = \u222b [DAD\u03bbD\u03c6] e\u2212SSYM[A,\u03bb,\u03c6]ZT[A, \u03bb, \u03c6], (5.41)\n48The ideas mostly appear in the literature, but may not have been collected previously in this way.\nwhere the SYM action includes the gauge coupling and theta term, and the path integral measure implicitly accounts for gauge fixing. Similar expressions are available for any other observable of the gauged theory, in terms of observables of the non-gauged theory.\nThe idea then is to add the deformation term (5.11) for the vector multiplet, without adding any deformation terms for the tinkertoys. Supersymmetric localization restricts the vector multiplet path integral as\nZT,gauged = lim t\u2192+\u221e\n\u222b [DAD\u03bbD\u03c6] e\u2212SSYM\u2212tQVvectorZT[A, \u03bb, \u03c6]\n= \u222b QVvector=0 [DAD\u03c6]e\u2212SSYM[A,\u03c6]Zvectorone-loop[A, \u03c6]ZT[A, \u03c6]. (5.42)\nThe locus QVvector = 0 cannot in principle have the fermion \u03bb turned on, which is why \u03bb disappears in the last line. The locus is described by (5.18) away from the poles and (5.19) at poles. Namely, zeros of the vector multiplet deformation term are characterized by a constant imaginary value \u03c6 = a \u2208 g and by (anti)-instantons at the poles.\nIn our applications T splits into decoupled sectors T = \u220fL TL. Decomposing G = \u220fI GI into simple factors and denoting by hI their Cartan algebra, we find\nZT,gauged = \u220f I [ \u2211 kI ,kI\u22650 \u222b hI\u00d7MGI,kI\u00d7MGI,kI daId\u03beId\u03beI ]{ \u220f I [ |qI |r 2|aI |2qkII q kI I Z vector one-loop[GI ; aI , kI , \u03beI , kI , \u03beI ] ] \u220f L ZTL [a, k, \u03be, k, \u03be] } .\n(5.43)\nFor class S theories, this matches precisely how a correlator on C would be calculated by inserting, on each tube of a pants decomposition of C, a complete set of states labeled by aI , kI , \u03beI , kI , \u03beI . Indeed, we recognize the sum over states \u2211 k,k \u222b a,\u03be,\u03be for each tube I, the inverse norm of that state, and the remaining three-point functions ZTL for each three-punctured sphere L. We know that ZTL is only sensitive to aI , kI , \u03beI , kI , \u03beI for groups under which TL is charged; in class S these correspond to the tubes that connect to the given tinkertoy.\nHolomorphic factorization by localizing on S3b . We now turn to a method to cut and glue partition functions using supersymmetric localization. This was most deeply explored in [249, 250] where many previously observed factorisation properties were derived (see also [91] for an earlier application of the idea). Our aim here is to explain the holomorphic dependence in q by cutting the sphere in halves along the equator S3b \u2282 S4b . This is nicely complementary to how we have cut the Riemann surface C above.\nAs a warm-up we revise the Lagrangian case. The keys for factorization in that case are that\n\u2022 the q and q dependence arises from instantons at the poles;\n\u2022 these instantons do not interact through ZTL .\nTo be precise, T consists of hypermultiplets and supersymmetric localization with the hypermultiplet deformation term sets all fields of T to zero, and quadratic fluctuations yield the product of a function of a, k, \u03be and a function of a, k, \u03be, as for the vector multiplet (5.27). Thus, the q, k, \u03be and q, k, \u03be dependence completely decouple from each other in (5.43). Collecting together the sum-integral over k, \u03be into an instanton partition function, we retrieve the expected factorization as an integral over a of a holomorphic times an antiholomorphic function of q, as stated in (5.28).\nWe now rephrase this in terms of localization. The S3b restriction of the 4d fields are 3d N = 2 vector and hypermultiplets, and the full 4d theory is alternatively described as two (identical) 4d theories on the hemispheres of S4b , coupled together through their boundary condition: for instance the partition function reads\nZS4 b\n= \u222b\n[D\u03a63d]e\u2212S3d[\u03a63d]ZHS4 b ,North[\u03a63d, q, q]ZHS4 b ,South[\u03a63d, q, q], (5.44)\nwhere \u03a63d denotes collectively all fields of the 3d N = 2 theory on the equator and ZHS... denote the path integrals over fields on each of the two hemispheres. This expression can be seen as the expectation value of (very complicated) observables ZHS... of the 3d theory.\nThe equator theory can then be localized by adding to it the usual deformation term that is used for localization on S3b . The 3d hypermultiplets get localized to zero as in 4d (5.15). The 3d vector multiplets get localized to constant values \u03c6 = a \u2208 g. As for any other observable, the ZHS... factors are evaluated on the localization locus so that\nZS4 b\n= \u222b\ndaZcl,3d[a]Zone-loop,3d[a]ZHS4 b ,North[a, q]ZHS4 b ,South[a, q]. (5.45)\nThe hemisphere partition functions are evaluated here with Dirichlet boundary conditions with a constant boundary value a for the vector multiplet scalars. The absence of gaugecoupling dependence in 3d is standard: YM terms in 3d are Q-exact. More generally, YM and theta terms are Q-exact everywhere away from the North/South poles where their sum/difference is not Q-exact in a smooth way. This explains why the hemisphere contributions only depend on q or q.\nThis idea of cutting the theory along the equator generalizes beyond Lagrangian theories. Even though ZTL may not have a path integral description, general axioms of QFT still apply and one can insert a complete set of states along the hypersurface S3b \u2282 S4b . The partition function is then seen as the overlap of two states prepared by the path integral over hemispheres,\nZS4 b\n= \u2211\n|\u03a6\u3009\u2208H[S3 b ]\n\u2329 HS4b North \u2223\u2223 \u03a6\u232a\u2329\u03a6 \u2223\u2223 HS4b South\u232a. (5.46) Then, Q-invariance of the set-up implies that the sum restricts to Q-invariant states,\nZS4 b\n= \u2211\n|a\u3009\u2208H[S3 b ],Q|a\u3009=0\n\u2329 HS4b North \u2223\u2223 a\u232a\u2329a \u2223\u2223 HS4b South\u232a, (5.47)\nand Q-exactness of the YM\u00b1 theta terms on each hemisphere shows that the two factors are (anti)-holomorphic functions of q as wanted.\nWe observe that the Coulomb branch integral over a \u2208 h is in general replaced by a sum/integral over Q-invariant states in the S3b Hilbert space of the 4d theory. This is typically a larger space, especially in the presence of non-Lagrangian tinkertoys.\n6 AGT for SU(2) quivers The AGT relation (5.1) relates observables of two different dimensional reductions of the 6d (2, 0) theory X (su(2)). We have explained in section 4 how reducing X (su(2)) on a Riemann surface C = C \\ {z1, . . . , zn} yields a 4d N = 2 su(2) Sicilian49 quiver gauge theory that depends on C, with gauge couplings related to the complex structure of C. Likewise, we expect that reducing X (su(2)) on S4b should yield a 2d theory with a coupling constant b, and the codimension 2 defects of X (su(2)) inserted at punctures zi of C should become local operators in 2d. Since this 2d dimensional reduction is somewhat technical, we postpone it to subsection 6.3, explaining there briefly why one should expect 6d observables to be computable both on the 4d and 2d sides.\nBefore that we determine the relevant 2d theory in a more historically accurate way in subsection 6.2: its correlators should reproduce the S4b partition functions of class S theories. These partition functions only depend on the complex structure of C, hence only on the conformal class of the metric on C. This means that the 2d theory we seek should be a CFT, and it turns out to be Liouville CFT. As a result, we begin by reviewing Liouville CFT and 2d CFT basics in subsection 6.1. We summarize aspects of the correspondence in Table 3.\n49Thus named because of a resemblance between trinions and the triskelion featuring prominently on the flag of Sicily.\n6.1 2d CFT and Liouville CFT\nWe refer to reviews such as [128, 129] (and references therein) for an introduction to 2d CFT and in particular to Liouville CFT. The Young Researchers Integrability School and Workshop (YRISW) course [251] also provides a brief introduction to 2d CFT and their symmetry algebras (chiral algebras), which curiously also show up independently as a protected subsector of 4d N = 2 theories.\nVirasoro algebra. In contrast to other dimensions, the conformal symmetry algebra in 2d is the product Vir\u00d7Vir of two infinite-dimensional algebras. The Virasoro algebra Vir is spanned by Ln, n \u2208 Z and a central element C, subject to\n[Lm, Ln] = (m\u2212 n)Lm+n + 1 12\u03b4m+n=0(m 3 \u2212m)C. (6.1)\nThis algebra, and the other copy spanned by Ln, n \u2208 Z and C, acts on the Hilbert space of the theory on a circle. For any given 2d CFT the elements C,C of the conformal algebra act as multiplications by constants called central charges and denoted c, c or cL, cR.\nIn a CFT, radial quantization identifies such states to their infinite-radial-past limit, which is a local operator O at the center of radial quantization. The state corresponding to O under this state-operator correspondence is denoted by |O\u3009. Under this correspondence, the action of Vir\u00d7Vir on states translates to an action on local operators by commutator. Exercise 6.1. Using (6.1), check [Lm, [Ln, Lp]]+[Ln, [Lp, Lm]]+[Lp, [Lm, Ln]] = 0. This is the Jacobi identity, essential for consistency of the Lie algebra Vir. Check that the factor m3 \u2212m is fixed by the Jacobi identity up to mixing Ln with C and scaling C.\nCheck that C\u0303 = kC and L\u0303n = Lkn/k + \u03b4n=0(k \u2212 1/k)C/24 obey the Virasoro commutation relations for any k \u2208 Z\\{0}, so that the Virasoro algebra contains infinitely many Virasoro subalgebras. Conversely, the Virasoro algebra can be embedded as the integer modes of a larger Virasoro algebra with fractional modes, useful in symmetric product orbifolds [252].\nConformal dimensions. Dilations and rotations around the center of radial quantizations are generated by L0\u00b1L0, hence the dimension \u2206 = hO+hO and spin hO\u2212hO \u2208 12Z of a local operator are given by the action of L0 and L0:\n[L0,O] = hOO, [L0,O] = hOO. (6.2)\nDespite the notation, the conformal dimensions hO and hO are independent numbers. In a unitary CFT they are both real and non-negative. We find it more convenient to mostly work with states, in which case \u2206O and hO \u2212 hO are the energy and momentum of the state.\nInterestingly, the commutator [L0, Ln] = \u2212nLn implies that if |O\u3009 has conformal dimensions (hO, hO) then Ln|O\u3009 has conformal dimensions (hO \u2212n, hO). For this reason, Ln, n \u2265 1 are called lowering operators, and Ln, n \u2264 \u22121 are called raising operators. The same applies to Ln.\nPrimary operators. The Hilbert space of a given theory organizes into conformal families, namely representations of Vir\u00d7Vir. In a unitary CFT, states have a non-negative energy so each conformal family has a state |V \u3009 of minimal dimension. Such a state is annihilated by all lowering operators Ln, Ln, n \u2265 1 and is called a primary state (the corresponding operator V is called a primary operator):\nLn|V \u3009 = Ln|V \u3009 = 0, n \u2265 1. (6.3)\nFrom this state of conformal dimensions (h, h) one can construct a tower of states of higher dimensions by acting with L\u2212n and L\u2212n, n \u2265 1. Using the Virasoro commutator (6.1) these raising operators can be ordered, and the set of descendants is spanned by the following states\nL\u2212Y L\u2212Y |V \u3009 := L\u2212m1 . . . L\u2212mkL\u2212n1 . . . L\u2212nl |V \u3009, (6.4)\nwhere Y, Y are two Young diagrams, m1 \u2265 m2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 mk \u2265 1 are the successive lengths of rows of Y , and likewise n1 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 1 the rows of Y . The conformal dimensions of (6.4) are ( h+m1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+mk, h+ n1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ nl ) . These states are called descendants of |V \u3009. In fact, the whole representation of Vir\u00d7Vir is spanned (as a vector space) by (6.4), and generically these states are linearly independent. Exercise 6.2. 1. For |V \u3009 a primary state, and for m,n \u2208 Z, rewrite LmLn|V \u3009 as a linear combination of terms (6.4) with properly sorted indices.\n2. Check that for any Y, Y , acting with any Ln or Ln on L\u2212Y L\u2212Y |V \u3009 yields a linear combination of such descendants.\nTwo and three-point functions. Conformal symmetry constrains correlators of local operators. Denoting by zij = zi \u2212 zj , the two- and three-point functions of primary operators Vi of conformal dimensions (hi, hi) take the form\n\u3008V1(z1, z1)V2(z2, z2)\u3009 = g12 \u03b4h1=h2\u03b4h1=h2 z \u22122h1 12 z \u22122h1 12 ,\n\u3008V1(z1, z1)V2(z2, z2)V3(z3, z3)\u3009 = C123 zh1\u2212h2\u2212h323 z h2\u2212h3\u2212h1 31 z h3\u2212h1\u2212h2 12\n\u00d7 zh1\u2212h2\u2212h323 z h2\u2212h3\u2212h1 31 z h3\u2212h1\u2212h2 12 ,\n(6.5)\nwhere g12, C123 are constants depending on the primary operators involved. Descendant operators can be written as Virasoro generators Ln, Ln acting on primary operators, and these generators act on (6.5) as various differential operators.\nIf the CFT has a single primary operator of each conformal dimension (h, h), which is the case for Liouville CFT, then g12 can be absorbed in a normalization of that operator. Despite this possibility, the standard normalization of primary operators V\u03b1 has nontrivial g12, and our AGT-friendly normalization V\u0302\u03b1 given below also does. Once this normalization is chosen, the theory is characterized by its spectrum of primary operators (their conformal dimensions) and by three-point functions C123 as explained next.\nCorrelators and conformal blocks. The n \u2265 4 point functions of primary operators are then fixed by conformal invariance [253]. For concreteness, consider a 4-point function, and insert a complete set of states, which we separate according to representations of Vir\u00d7Vir:\n\u3008V1V2V3V4\u3009 = \u2211\nV,V \u2032 primaries Y,Y ,Y \u2032,Y \u2032 Young diagrams\n\u3008V1V2L\u2212Y L\u2212Y |V \u3009 g \u22121(Y, Y , V ;Y \u2032, Y \u2032, V \u2032) \u3008V \u2032|LY \u2032LY \u2032V3V4\u3009,\n(6.6) where g\u22121(Y, Y , V ;Y \u2032, Y \u2032, V \u2032 ) denotes components of the (matrix) inverse of the \u201cmatrix\u201d with components \u3008V \u2032|LY \u2032LY \u2032L\u2212Y L\u2212Y |V \u3009. Translating all Virasoro generators to differential operators acting on the position dependence in (6.5) gives\n\u3008V1V2V3V4\u3009 = \u2211\nV5,V6 primaries C125g\n\u22121 56 C634F(h1, . . . , h5; z1, . . . , z4)F(h1, . . . , h5; z1, . . . , z4).\n(6.7) Up to unimportant factors, the (locally) holomorphic factor F is called a conformal block. It is entirely determined by dimensions h1, . . . , h4 of the external operators, and the dimension h5 = h6 of the internal operator inserted as part of the complete set of states.\nWe could have inserted a complete set of states with a different choice of which pair of operators Vi lies on the two sides of the inserted states. More generally, the possible ways to insert complete set of states to reduce a sphere n-point function (down to the constants g, C, and conformal blocks) correspond to the ways of decomposing the n-punctured sphere into three-punctured spheres: a complete set of states is inserted along each closed loop cutting the sphere into pieces. In all cases, conformal blocks are purely representation-theoretic objects; they depend on dimensions of the n external operators and of n\u2212 3 internal operators inserted along cuts.\nLiouville theory. Liouville theory describes a single scalar field subject to the action\nS[\u03c6] = 14\u03c0\n\u222b d2z\u221ag (\u2202\u03bd\u03c6\u2202\u03bd\u03c6+QR\u03c6+ 4\u03c0\u00b5 e2b\u03c6) (6.8)\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar. Provided Q = b + 1/b this theory is conformal, with holomorphic stress-tensor T = (\u2202\u03c6)2 +Q\u22022\u03c6 and central charges c = c = 1 + 6Q2 \u2265 25.\nWhile it looks like the cosmological constant \u00b5 is a coupling constant, it turns out to only appears in trivial ways in correlators: instead there is interesting dependence on b > 0, with b\u2192 0 being the semiclassical limit. The Liouville CFT admits a (non-manifest) duality b\u2192 1/b while keeping \u03bb = ( \u03c0\u0393(b2) \u0393(1\u2212b2)\u00b5\n)1/b fixed. One can check that V\u03b1 = :e2\u03b1\u03d5: are conformal primary operators of left/right-moving dimension h(\u03b1) = \u03b1(Q\u2212\u03b1) = Q2/4+P 2, for \u03b1 = (b+1/b)/2+iP , P \u2208 R. The invariance h(Q\u2212 \u03b1) = h(\u03b1) suggests the identification V\u03b1 = R(\u03b1)VQ\u2212\u03b1. The reflection coefficient can be determined (using conformal bootstrap) to be\nR(\u03b1) = \u2212\u03bbQ\u22122\u03b1 \u0393(b(2\u03b1\u2212Q))\u0393(1b (2\u03b1\u2212Q)) \u0393(b(Q\u2212 2\u03b1))\u0393(1b (Q\u2212 2\u03b1)) . (6.9)\nThe two-point function is then\n\u3008V\u03b11V\u03b12\u3009 = \u03b4\u03b11+\u03b12=Q +R(\u03b11)\u03b4\u03b11=\u03b12 . (6.10)\nThe three-point function is known to be given by the Dorn\u2013Otto\u2013Zamolodchikov\u2013 Zamolodchikov (DOZZ) formula [254, 255]\nC\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13 = \u3008V\u03b11V\u03b12V\u03b13\u3009\n= (b 2/b\u22122b\u03bb)Q\u2212\u03b11\u2212\u03b12\u2212\u03b13\u03a5\u2032b(0)\u03a5b(2\u03b11)\u03a5b(2\u03b12)\u03a5b(2\u03b13) \u03a5b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212Q)\u03a5b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13)\u03a5b(\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11)\u03a5b(\u03b13 + \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12) .

Exercise 6.3. 1. Check that the DOZZ formula (6.11) respects the expected b \u2192 1/b duality, and the symmetries \u03b1i \u2192 Q\u2212\u03b1i for any of the i, up to the appropriate reflection coefficient.\n2. Using properties of \u03a5b listed in Appendix A, show that at fixed generic \u03b11, \u03b12, the \u03b13 \u2192 0 limit of C\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13 vanishes. Show that for \u03b11 = \u03b12 the limit is infinite, while (\u03b13/2)C\u03b1\u03b1\u03b13 \u2192 g\u03b1\u03b1 = R(\u03b1).\n6.2 Finding the AGT dictionary\nWe expect a relation of the form\nZS4 b\n( T(su(2), C,m) ) = \u2329 V\u0302\u03b11(z1) . . . V\u0302\u03b1n(zn) \u232a C\n(6.13)\nfor any number n of puncture, where V\u0302\u03b1i(zi) are the reductions of codimension 2 operators of the 6d theory down to points. In this section we use known S4b partition function to determine that the relevant 2d CFT is Liouville CFT described above, and that V\u0302\u03b1 are suitable rescalings of vertex operators V\u03b1.\nThree-point functions and normalization. A 2d CFT is characterized by its spectrum (left and right conformal dimensions of primary operators) and OPE structure constants (equivalently, three-point functions of conformal primary operators). When constructing class S theories from X (su(2)), the data associated to a puncture is a mass parameter m \u2208 iR/Z2. We thus want local operators V with a continuous parameter. For consistency with earlier notation we denote this (dimensionless) parameter as \u03b1 = Q/2 + rm, where Q = b+ 1/b.\nDetermining the conformal dimension of V\u0302\u03b1 will have to wait; let us begin with three-point functions. We know that the theory associated to a three-punctured sphere is a trifundamental half-hypermultiplet. Its partition function is a hypermultiplet one-loop determinant (5.25), so that the three-point function is\nC\u0302\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13 := \u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u03b12 V\u0302\u03b13\u3009 = \u220f \u00b1\u00b1 1 \u03a5b ( \u03b11 \u00b1 (\u03b12 \u2212Q/2)\u00b1 (\u03b13 \u2212Q/2)\n) = 1\u03a5b(\u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11)\u03a5b(\u03b13 + \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12)\u03a5b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13)\u03a5b(\u03b11 + \u03b12 + \u03b13 \u2212Q) , (6.14)\nin which we used the invariance \u03a5b(x) = \u03a5b(Q \u2212 x). This matches precisely the denominator of the DOZZ formula (6.11), and the numerator can be absorbed (except for an \u03b1-independent factor) by the normalization\nV\u0302\u03b1 = (b2/b\u22122b\u03bb)\u03b1\u2212Q/2\n\u03a5b(2\u03b1) V\u03b1. (6.15)\nWith this normalization one can check that V\u0302\u03b1 = V\u0302Q\u2212\u03b1 and that the two-point function reads\ng\u0302\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 = \u3008V\u0302\u03b1V\u0302\u03b1\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4\u03b1+\u03b1\u2032=Q + \u03b4\u03b1=\u03b1\u2032\n\u03a5b(Q\u2212 2\u03b1)\u03a5b(2\u03b1\u2212Q) . (6.16)\nFour-point functions and dimensions. To determine the conformal dimension of V\u0302\u03b1 we consider a four-punctured sphere and cut it in a channel suitable for the q \u2192 0 limit, where q is the cross-ratio of the four punctures. The gauge theory corresponding to a four-punctured sphere is su(2) Nf = 4 SQCD, and its partition function, computed using supersymmetric localization, takes the form (5.28)\nZS4 b = \u222b iR/Z2 da |q|r2|a|2Zone-loop(a)Zinst(a, q)Zinst(a, q). (6.17)\nIn the q \u2192 0 limit, Zinst \u2192 1. This expression should be compared to the decomposition of a four-point function in 2d CFT,\n\u3008V\u0302\u03b11(0)V\u0302\u03b12(q)V\u0302\u03b13(1)V\u0302\u03b14(\u221e)\u3009 = \u222b Q/2+iR/Z2 d\u03b1 qh(\u03b1)qh(\u03b1) C\u0302\u03b11\u03b12\u03b1C\u0302\u03b1\u03b13\u03b14 g\u0302\u03b1\u03b1 F(\u03b1i, \u03b1; q)F(\u03b1i, \u03b1; q) (6.18)\nin which F are conformal blocks that depend (anti)-holomorphically on the cross-ratio q, and tend to 1 as q \u2192 0.\nWe have already identified the three-point functions C to hypermultiplet one-loop determinants. In turn, the inverse two-point function g\u0302\u22121\u03b1\u03b1 is equal to the vector multiplet one-loop determinant. It is thus natural to expect the conformal blocks to match instanton partition functions, and to identify the powers of q, namely h(\u03b1) = h(\u03b1) = Q2/4 + P 2 and r2|a|2, up to a harmless shift by Q2/4.\nConformal blocks and proofs of AGT. The key remaining piece to check the AGT dictionary is to verify that conformal blocks do indeed match instanton partition functions,50 as tested at low orders (in powers of q) in [5, 93, 257\u2013263]. There have been many approaches to this (see for instance [124, section 5.3] for a short review).\nOne set of approaches relies on exhibiting an action of the Virasoro algebra (and many generalizations) on the instanton moduli space. See [264, 265] for an early example, and generalizations in [14, 29, 82, 266\u2013284]. In particular, one can construct [14, 29, 245, 285, 286] (see also [287\u2013289]) an orthonormal basis of conformal descendants of |V\u0302\u03b1\u3009 such that inserting these states in a four-point function as in (6.6) yields term by term the expression of Nekrasov instanton partition functions as sums over U(1)-invariant point-like instanton configurations. The Virasoro algebra and W-algebras also appear in a 6d context in [290\u2013293]. See also our discussion of more elaborate symmetry algebras on page 101 in section 10.\nRecursion relations are studied in [227, 271, 294\u2013296]. One difficulty is for instance the presence of spurious poles in terms of the instanton expansion, which disappear when summing all contributions [297]. The large c limit is investigated in [298, 299]. A free-field approach based on Dotsenko\u2013Fateev representations of CFT correlators is given in [289, 300\u2013306]. A string-theory derivation of the AGT dictionary (from a 5d generalization) is given in [67, 307] and reviewed in [308]. A rather different approach is based on characterizing both conformal blocks and instanton partition functions as solutions to Riemann\u2013Hilbert problems [309]."

            "heading": "6.3 Liouville from 6d",
            "text": "We have argued that the relevant 2d theory for the AGT correspondence is Liouville CFT, and numerous checks of the AGT correspondence validate this. Could we see it directly from 6d?\nThe approach. Deformations of the metric of C that preserve its conformal class (or equivalently complex structure) are Q-exact with respect to the supercharge Q that we used for supersymmetric localization [18]. Thus, such deformations do not affect the partition function of the 6d theory, which can be computed in the limits where C is infinitely smaller or larger than S4b . Importantly, this argument holds also in the presence of any Q-closed observables such as the loops, surfaces, or walls that we consider in section 8. Remembering that the 6d theory is conformally invariant, these limits are equivalent to dimensionally reducing on either one of the factors. We should thus expect to obtain Liouville CFT (or its higher-rank generalization, Toda CFT discussed further in subsection 7.1) by dimensionally reducing the 6d theory X (su(2)) (or X (su(N))) along S4b .\nIn [18, 310], C\u00f3rdova and Jafferis have performed this reduction in three steps: 50Interestingly, the case of N = 4 SYM caused some early confusion in the literature, clarified in [256]: this theory has Zinst = 1, and it corresponds to a torus with a non-trivial vertex operator insertion \u03b1 = Q/2.\nX (g) reduced on S1 yields 5d N = 2 SYM; X (g) reduced on S3b (or quotients thereof51) yields 3d complex Chern\u2013Simons theory; X (g) reduced on S4b yields 2d complex Toda CFT. They conjectured that this complexified version of Toda CFT is dual to ordinary Toda CFT. The derivation was extended in [313] to include orbifold surface operators (see also [314] for another approach).\nReduction to complex Chern\u2013Simons theory. The reduction to 3d is relevant for the 3d/3d analogue of the AGT correspondence that we will describe in subsection 9.3. We place the 6d theory on S3b \u00d7C3, where the squashed sphere is described for instance by its isometric embedding into R4 as S3b = {b2(y21 + y22) + b\u22122(y23 + y24) = r2} \u2282 R4. Preserving supersymmetry requires a partial topological twist, which amounts to including suitable background values for supergravity fields, determined in [315]. The approach in [310] was to work with a different squashing of the sphere S3 that preserves U(1) \u00d7 SU(2) isometries instead of U(1)\u00d7U(1). We will gloss over this, as the backgrounds differ by suitably Q-exact terms that do not affect partition functions eventually.\nThe Hopf fibration of S3, namely an S1 fibration over S2, is compatible with the squashing. Thus, X (g) can be reduced first on the S1 fibers, obtaining 5d N = 2 SYM theory. Thankfully, the non-abelian 5d theory has a Lagrangian description, hence can be further dimensionally reduced explicitly, in contrast to X (g), which has no known Lagrangian description.\nA further reduction on the S2 base of the Hopf fibration gives the following light fields, all valued in the adjoint representation of g.\n\u2022 One 3d gauge field A arising from components of the 5d gauge field along C3. It has a 3d Chern\u2013Simons term at level k = 1, which arises because the 5d graviphoton has one unit of flux through S2 in the supergravity background. This in turn stems from the Hopf fibration; when reducing on S2 \u00d7 S1 instead, k = 0.\n\u2022 Zero modes of the five vector multiplet scalars of 5d N = 2 SYM. Because the twist identifies an so(3) \u2282 so(5) subgroup of R-symmetry with 3d rotations, these zero modes combine into a one-form X and a pair of scalars Yi.\n\u2022 Four fermions \u03bb with a two-derivative Lagrangian \u2212\u03bb(\u2207A)2\u03bb+ [X,\u03bb]2. In terms of \u2206 = (\u2207A)2 + (adX)2, the quadratic path integral over \u03bb yields a factor of (det \u2206)2, while the pair of scalars Yi yields 1/ det \u2206 since their Lagrangian is \u2212Y\u2206Y .\nAltogether, Y and \u03bb give a factor of det \u2206, which matches the Faddeev\u2013Popov determinant for gauge fixing (\u2207A)\u00b5X\u00b5 = 0 the \u201cimaginary\u201d gauge transformation (A\u00b5, X\u00b5) 7\u2192 (A\u00b5 \u2212 [X\u00b5, g], X\u00b5 +\u2207A\u00b5 g) for a local gauge parameter g.\nThe final 3d theory has a pair of one-forms, hence a complex one-formA = A+iX \u2208 gC with action\nS = q8\u03c0 \u222b C3 Tr ( A \u2227 dA+ 23A \u2227A \u2227A ) + q\u03038\u03c0 \u222b C3 Tr ( A \u2227 dA+ 23A \u2227A \u2227A ) (6.19)\n51The reduction of X (g) on S1 \u00d7 S2 also yields complex Chern\u2013Simons, at a different level [311, 312].\nsubject to GC gauge invariance stemming from the standard and the imaginary gauge invariances. The action for X arises from numerous supergravity fields necessary to ensure supersymmetry. The coupling constants q = k + is and q\u0303 = k \u2212 is encode the geometry as\nk = 1, s = 1\u2212 b 2\n1 + b2 . (6.20)\nMore generally the theory makes sense for k \u2208 Z and s \u2208 R \u222a iR. The SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) preserving squashing of S3 used in [310] has a parameter ` \u2208 (0,+\u221e) and s = \u221a 1\u2212 `2 can also take imaginary values. Other values of k arise from changing S3b to S2 \u00d7 S1 for k = 0, or to the (squashed) Lens space L(k, 1)b = S3b /Zk. The 3d/3d correspondence is discussed in subsection 9.3.\nReduction to complex Toda theory. The idea in [18] is to treat S4b as a squashed three-sphere S3b fibered over an interval. In the notation of (5.8) the interval is parametrized by y5 \u2208 [\u2212r, r] and the S3b has squared radius r2 \u2212 y25, namely it degenerates to a point at both ends. The product metric g on S4b \u00d7C is mapped by a Weyl transformation to S3b \u00d7 C3, where C3 is a warped product of C with an interval:\ng = dy25 + (r2 \u2212 y25) gS3 b\n+ gC , 1\nr2 \u2212 y25 g = gS3\nb + dy 2 5 + gC r2 \u2212 y25 . (6.21)\nThe resulting metric is singular at y5 = \u00b1r, which leads to boundary conditions for the theory on C3 = [\u2212r, r] \u00d7w C. The edge modes coming from each extremity are then understood to be described by chiral complex Toda theory. Combining these two chiral theories gives complex Toda CFT on C. This theory describes a complex boson \u03a6 in the complexification of the Cartan subalgebra h \u2282 g, with an exponential potential,\nSgC Toda = q\n8\u03c0 \u222b C ( \u3008\u2202\u03a6, \u2202\u0304\u03a6\u3009+ r\u2211 j=1 e\u3008ej ,\u03a6\u3009 ) d2z + q\u03038\u03c0 \u222b C ( \u3008\u2202\u03a6, \u2202\u0304\u03a6\u3009+ r\u2211 j=1 e\u3008ej ,\u03a6\u3009 ) d2z,\n(6.22) where ej are the simple roots of g, r = rank g, and the Killing form and the pairing of h\u2217 and h are both denoted \u3008 , \u3009. The coupling constants q = k + is, q\u0303 = k \u2212 is encode the geometry as in (6.20).\nRelation to ordinary Toda theory. The conjecture is then that complex Toda CFT is related to an earlier proposal of [22] (based on [20] in the k = 2 case) for the AGT correspondence on S4b /Zk. For g = su(N), the 2d CFT proposed in [22] consists of two decoupled theories: an s\u0302u(k)N/u(1)k\u22121 coset, and real parafermionic Toda CFT with parameters N , k, and b = \u221a q\u0303/q (coinciding with the squashing parameter). The latter theory describes parafermions and real bosons \u03c8,\u03d5 \u2208 h, where the parafermions are described by another coset model s\u0302u(N)k/u\u0302(1)N\u22121 and are coupled through dimension 1\u2212 1/k operators \u03c8j\u03c8\u0304j to the real bosons,\nSpara-Toda = S ( s\u0302u(N)k u\u0302(1)N\u22121 ) + \u222b C ( \u3008\u2202\u03d5, \u2202\u0304\u03d5\u3009+ N\u22121\u2211 j=1 \u03c8j\u03c8\u0304je (b/ \u221a k)\u3008ej ,\u03d5\u3009 ) d2z. (6.23)\nFor k = 1 both the decoupled coset and the parafermions trivialize and we are left with ordinary Toda CFT with coupling b, as stated by the standard AGT correspondence.\nThe conjectured duality between complex Toda CFT and coset plus para-Toda CFT has only been checked explicitly for the simplest case of g = su(2) with k = 1 in [316], and in [29, 317] for the case N = k = 2 where it essentially boils down to bosonization.

            "text": "In this section we enter the realm of non-Lagrangian theories: while all class S theories arising from X (su(2)) with tame punctures can be realized by coupling vector and hypermultiplets, we now extend the story in two ways.\nThe 6d (2, 0) theory X (g) is labeled by an arbitrary simply-laced simple Lie algebra g, so it is no wonder that the AGT correspondence [5] extends beyond su(2) to su(N) [93] and general gauge algebras [96, 98, 99, 318], with Liouville CFT generalizing to the Toda CFT. After reviewing this CFT in subsection 7.1 with an eye towards its connections to gauge theory, we describe an example of AGT correspondence and important considerations\n\u2022 Most higher-rank class S theories are non-Lagrangian. \u2022 Partial Higgsing gives a hierarchy of tame punctures. Some are described by quiver tails of SU groups. \u2022 Collisions of tame punctures give wild punctures. This often results in AD theories. \u2022 Tame punctures map to Toda semi-degenerate primaries. \u2022 Wild punctures map to Toda CFT irregular operators.\nabout punctures in subsection 7.2. Second, in subsection 7.3, we consider interesting limits where two punctures collide while the parameters describing the defects are appropriately scaled. The resulting wild punctures allow to realize asymptotically-free gauge theories (such as SU(2) SQCD with Nf < 4), and AD theories [2] as part of class S.\n7.1 Toda CFT\nLagrangian and symmetries. We cannot do justice to the fifty year history of Toda theory, starting from the Toda lattice [319, 320] in 1967, which consists of particles with nearest-neighbor exponential interactions (see [321] for an early review). Its QFT version was defined in 1982 in [322] and found to be conformal. Given a simply-laced52 Lie algebra g and its Cartan Lie algebra h, Toda CFT describes a real scalar field \u03c6 \u2208 h\n52Toda CFT is defined for an arbitrary simple Lie algebra, but we only present the simply-laced case because only that case is relevant for the AGT correspondence. Correlators in non-simply-laced Toda CFT presumably correspond to correlators of suitable outer automorphism twist operators in the gauge theory on S4b .\nsubject to the Lagrangian density\nL = 18\u03c0 ( g\u0302ab\u3008\u2202a\u03c6, \u2202b\u03c6\u3009+ 2\u3008Q,\u03d5\u3009R\u0302 ) + \u00b5 rank g\u2211 i=1 eb\u3008ei,\u03c6\u3009. (7.1)\nHere, ei are the simple roots of g and \u3008 , \u3009 denotes both the pairing of h\u2217 and h and the Killing form. The background charge vector Q that multiplies the scalar curvature R\u0302 of the background metric g\u0302 is set to Q = (b+ 1b )\u03c1 where \u03c1 is the Weyl vector, namely the half-sum of positive roots, equivalently the sum of all fundamental weights $j . Vertex operators V\u03b1 = e\u3008\u03b1,\u03c6\u3009 (we suppress normal ordering in this notation) are labeled by \u03b1 \u2208 h\u2217C and have holomorphic conformal dimension53\nh(\u03b1) = 12\u3008\u03b1, 2Q\u2212 \u03b1\u3009. (7.2)\nIn particular h(bei) = 1, which ensures that the exponential potential terms are exactly marginal. Their coupling \u00b5 is redundant and amounts to shifting \u03c6 by a multiple of \u03c1. The coupling b > 0 however plays an essential role: for instance the central charge c = rank g + 12\u3008Q,Q\u3009 depends on it. For simply-laced g the theory is (expected to be) dual under b 7\u2192 1/b, while keeping \u03bb = [\u03c0\u0393(b2)\u00b5/\u0393(1 \u2212 b2)]1/b fixed. This is quite satisfactory for the AGT correspondence since S4b and S41/b are isometric.\nBeyond the infinite-dimensional Virasoro symmetries of 2d CFT, Toda CFT has (anti)-holomorphicWg symmetries. This chiral algebra was uncovered in [323] for g = su(3), and more broadly in [324\u2013326] as a symmetry of minimal models. See [327] for an early review.54 It can be realized by quantum Drinfeld\u2013Sokolov reduction of an affine Lie algebra [131, 132, 329, 330]. (See [331, 332] for applications to W-strings.) In the g = su(N) case it can be realized as a truncation of a more general chiral algebra W\u221e generated by infinitely many conserved currents, as reviewed in [134]. As a chiral algebra, Wg is generated by rank g conserved currents W (k)(z) whose spins k are the degrees of Casimir invariants of g. The quadratic Casimir invariant yields the holomorphic stress-tensor T (z) = W (2)(z) which generates the Virasoro subalgebra of Wg.\nPrimary operators and normalization. The vertex operators V\u03b1 = e\u3008\u03b1,\u03c6\u3009 have definite quantum numbers w(k)(\u03b1) under zero-modes of all W (k), namely the OPE starts as\nW (k)(z)V\u03b1(0) = w(k)(\u03b1) zk V\u03b1(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (7.3)\nwith for instance w(2)(\u03b1) = h(\u03b1) given in (7.2). The conserved current W (k)(z) translates on the gauge theory side to the degree k differential \u03c6k that shows up in the construction (1.4) of the SW curve. The momenta Im\u03b1 are r times the (diagonalized) mass parameter m \u2208 g at a given tame puncture. In the classical limit r \u2192\u221e the quantum\n53The standard conventions for Q in Liouville and Toda CFT differ by a factor of 2, so that typical Liouville momenta take the form \u03b1 = Q/2 + iP while typical Toda momenta are \u03b1 = Q+ iP .\n54The contemporary [328] by the same authors is supposedly relevant, but not available to me.\nnumbers w(k)(\u03b1) simplify to Casimir invariants of g and the OPE (7.3) becomes the singularities of \u03c6k near tame punctures [19].\nThe quantum numbers w(k)(\u03b1) are invariant under the Weyl group action \u03b1 7\u2192 Q+w(\u03b1\u2212Q) for any Weyl group element w : h\u2217 \u2192 h\u2217. Thus, V\u03b1 and VQ+w(\u03b1\u2212Q) have the same quantum numbers; in Toda CFT they are the same operator up to a normalization called reflection amplitude and determined in [333\u2013335]. For generic \u03b1, the expressions can be recast as the statement that [93]55\nV\u0302\u03b1 = \u03bb\u3008\u03c1,\u03b1\u2212Q\u3009\u220f\ne>0 \u03a5b(\u3008Q\u2212 \u03b1, e\u3009) V\u03b1(z) (7.4)\nis invariant under Weyl reflections of \u03b1, where the product ranges over all positive roots e and we recall \u03bb = [\u03c0\u0393(b2)\u00b5/\u0393(1\u2212 b2)]1/b. While often convenient, the normalization (7.4) does not make sense for values of \u03b1 where the denominator blows up.\nThe operator spectrum of Toda CFT consists of vertex operators VQ+a with a \u2208 h (purely imaginary in our conventions), modulo the Weyl group. Each of them is the highest-weight of a Verma module of the Wg algebra, with no null states. As for the Virasoro algebra, there are some values of momenta (away from this line) for which the vertex operators have null descendants. The precise condition56 is that V\u03b1 has null descendants if \u3008\u03b1\u2212Q, e\u3009 = \u2212n1b\u2212 n2/b for any root e and positive integers n1, n2 > 0.\nCorrelators in Toda CFT. The Wg symmetry severely constrains two and threepoint functions in Toda CFT. A two-point function of primary operators V\u03b11 and V\u03b12 can only be non-vanishing if their quantum numbers obey w(k)(\u03b11) = (\u22121)kw(k)(\u03b12), hence \u03b11 = 2Q \u2212 \u03b12 modulo the Weyl group. Taking into account our preferred normalization (7.4) one has\n\u3008V\u0302\u03b1(z, z\u0304)V\u0302\u03b1\u2032(0)\u3009 = |z|\u22124h(\u03b1) \u2211 w\u2208Weyl \u03b4Q\u2212\u03b1\u2032=w(\u03b1\u2212Q)\u220f roots e \u03a5b(\u3008Q\u2212 \u03b1, e\u3009) , (7.5)\nwhere the sum of delta functions simply ensures Weyl invariance and working with the unnormalized V\u03b1 (which is necessary to treat partially degenerate momenta) would simply introduce some reflection amplitudes in this sum. The Shapovalov matrix of two-point functions of Wg-descendants follows in the standard way by commuting the W-algebra modes W (k)n . Our normalization choice is pleasant because, as in the su(2) case, the inverse two-point function \u220fe \u03a5b(\u3008Q\u2212 \u03b1, e\u3009) matches the one-loop determinant of a vector multiplet for the gauge algebra g.\nThe three-point functions of primaries are encoded in coefficients C\u0302123 = C\u0302(\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13)\n\u3008V\u0302\u03b11(z1, z\u03041)V\u0302\u03b12(z2, z\u03042)V\u0302\u03b13(z3, z\u03043)\u3009 = C\u0302(\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13)\n|z1 \u2212 z2|2h12 |z1 \u2212 z3|2h13 |z2 \u2212 z3|2h23 , (7.6)\n55The reflection amplitude in [333\u2013335] and in later work [136] (by one of the same authors) seems to differ by a sign. I take the latter sign to be correct as it seems to agree with Liouville CFT.\n56This is obtained using screening charges, see e.g. [336]. Reading modern references, I think that the null descendants start at level n1n2, but I have not found the suitable references in old Toda CFT literature. Help welcome.\nwhere hij = h(\u03b1i) + h(\u03b1j)\u2212 h(\u03b1k). The general three-point function is not known, and in addition three-point functions of most Wg-descendants cannot be expressed in terms of C\u0302123, unlike the standard case of Virasoro descendants. Only certain special cases [136, 337, 338] discussed below have been determined.\nUnder-determined conformal blocks. This has a knock-on effect on higher-point Toda CFT correlators, as the conformal blocks describing how Wg descendants contribute are not fixed by symmetry. Consider for instance\n\u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u03b12 V\u0302\u03b13 V\u0302\u03b14\u3009 = \u222b a\u2208h/Weyl da \u2211 Y \u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u03b12 V\u0302 [Y ] Q\u2212a\u3009 1 \u3008V\u0302Q\u2212aV\u0302Q+a\u3009 \u3008V\u0302 [Y ]Q+aV\u0302\u03b13 V\u0302\u03b14\u3009, (7.7)\nwhere we suppressed the spatial dependence, the integral ranges over primary operators V\u0302\u03b1 in the spectrum, and the sum ranges over their descendants, orthogonalized and normalized to have the same norm \u3008V\u0302Q\u2212aV\u0302Q+a\u3009 as primaries. For generic \u03b1i, the only three-point functions \u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u03b12 V\u0302 [Y ] Q\u2212a\u3009 that are determined by primary three-point functions are those where V\u0302 [Y ]Q\u2212a is in fact a Virasoro descendant of V\u0302Q\u2212a. The class S theory coming from a three-punctured sphere with full tame punctures is the non-Lagrangian tinkertoy Tg, and supersymmetric localization has nothing to say on its sphere partition function. A very powerful roundabout way is to consider the 5d lift and work out the limit of S4b \u00d7 S1 partition function when the circle radius \u03b2 shrinks [339\u2013342]. In principle this provides conjectural expressions for C\u0302123 and all descendant three-point functions [343], but it is not clear that the \u03b2 \u2192 0 limits exist, and it is not clear how to relate parameters of the topological vertex formalism to bases of descendants, as explained in detail in [229]. Higher-point correlators correspond to theories obtained by gauging together copies of Tg. Since the gauge group is simply one factor G per tube, the instanton moduli space is known, and the instanton partition function is some integral over this space. The integrand, however, depends on the matter theories Tg, whose reaction to instantons is not known. This is exactly analogous to how the sum over descendants is known but the requisite three-point functions do not derive from C\u0302123.\n7.2 Higher rank AGT correspondence\nThe main building block of class S theories is the tinkertoy Tg for three full tame punctures, reviewed in [117]. This tinkertoy is non-Lagrangian57 for g 6= su(2). As a result, another type of tame punctures (called simple punctures) is needed for the simplest examples of higher-rank AGT correspondence, such as the matching of an SU(N) SQCD partition function with an su(N) Toda CFT four-point function.\nBesides full and simple tame punctures, there are other tame punctures (and of course a host of wild punctures) studied in [1, 6, 261, 318, 336, 345, 346] A large program to\n57Interestingly, its 3d N = 4 dimensional reduction is mirror to a Lagrangian theory described by a star-shaped quiver [344].\nclassify tinkertoys has been carried out by Chacaltana and Distler and collaborators in [95, 97, 100\u2013106, 108] (a warning though, their use of \u201cirregular\u201d is non-standard in this context). The punctures that can arise in a limit where one of the tubes in the Riemann surface becomes pinched were studied in [8, 347].\nThe various tame punctures correspond to Toda CFT vertex operators V\u03b1 that are partially degenerate, as we explain for g = su(N). We also describe how punctures can be \u201cpartially closed\u201d by tuning their parameters, which on the gauge theory side corresponds to a partial Higgsing. Finally, we outline how to include non-simply-laced gauge groups.\nWyllard relation: SU(N) linear quiver and a su(N) Toda CFT correlator. For simplicity we now focus on the g = su(N) case, which is understood best. The chiral algebra is denoted variously Wsu(N) = WAN\u22121 = WN .\nIn subsection 4.4 we considered a linear quiver gauge theory whose hypermultiplets transform in bifundamental representations of n\u2212 1 successive SU(N) groups, of which the middle n\u22123 are gauged. Besides the two SU(N) flavour symmetries at the ends of the quiver, each of the n\u22122 hypermultiplets has a U(1) flavour symmetry. As stated in (4.26), this theory is realized by reducing X (su(N)) on a sphere with n punctures corresponding to these n flavour symmetry factors. The SU(N) flavour symmetries correspond to full tame punctures, at which each differential \u03c6k has a pole of order k \u2212 1 in the massless case, or k when SU(N) masses are turned on. The U(1) flavour symmetries correspond to simple tame punctures where each \u03c6k has a simple pole in the massless case (the massive case is more complicated).\nThe AGT correspondence proposed in [93] takes the form\nZS4 b  SU(N) U(1) SU(N) U(1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 U(1) SU(N) U(1) SU(N)  = \u2329V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u00b52 V\u0302\u00b53 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 V\u0302\u00b5n\u22121 V\u0302\u03b1n\u232aToda(su(N)) (7.8) where \u03b1j (j = 1, n) encode the imaginary SU(N) mass parameters of the two full punctures, mj = (mj1, . . . ,mjN ) with \u2211 pmjp = 0, while \u00b5j (j = 2, . . . , n\u2212 1) encodes the j-th U(1) mass parameter mj \u2208 iR as\n\u03b1j = Q+ rmj , j = 1, n, \u00b5j = ( N 2 ( b+ 1 b ) + rmj ) $1, j = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7n\u2212 1.\n(7.9)\nFor instance in the case n = 4 this identifies a Toda CFT four-point function to the partition function of SU(N) SQCD with Nf = 2N flavours.\nTo understand these momenta, we discuss the corresponding vertex operators V\u03b1 and their WN descendants. We have already encountered momenta in Q+ h which describe normalizable states that occur in the spectrum of Toda CFT. Momenta proportional to the first weight $1 are called semi-degenerate momenta: as uncovered starting in [348, 349] they have null WN descendants at level 1. Consider a three-point function \u3008V\u03b1V\u03ba$1V\u03b1\u2032\u3009 with a semi-degenerate vertex operator. Thanks to null vectors, the action\nof arbitrary WN generators can be converted to Virasoro generators, hence to differential operators acting on the known coordinate-dependence. This means that three-point functions of descendants of V\u03b1, V\u03ba$1 , and V\u03b1\u2032 are uniquely fixed as a multiple of the three-point function of primaries.\nChecking the Wyllard relation. As in the su(2) case, the matching (7.8) is most directly checked in the S-duality frame corresponding to the s-channel decomposition of the sphere correlator. Each three-punctured sphere piece has one simple puncture and two full punctures (and corresponds on the gauge theory side to a bifundamental hypermultiplet). Expanding the correlator in this channel, rewriting descendant threepoint functions in terms of the primaries, and collecting the descendant\u2019s contributions into a conformal block, we have\n\u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u00b52 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 V\u0302\u00b5n\u22121 V\u0302\u03b1n\u3009 = \u222b aj\u2208h/Weyl 2\u2264j\u2264n\u22122 da \u3008V\u0302\u03b11 V\u0302\u00b52 V\u0302Q+a2\u3009\u3008V\u0302Q\u2212a2 V\u0302\u00b53 V\u0302Q+a3\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3008V\u0302Q\u2212an\u22122 V\u0302\u00b5n\u22121 V\u0302\u03b1n\u3009 \u3008V\u0302Q+a2 V\u0302Q\u2212a2\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3008V\u0302Q+an\u22122 V\u0302Q\u2212an\u22122\u3009 F(z)F(z),\n(7.10) for some conformal blocks F(z) that are (in principle) calculable as series in powers of complex structure parameters of C, and that depend on all external and internal momenta. The very fact that conformal blocks are calculable (for these momenta) matches nicely with the fact that the 4d theory is Lagrangian hence its partition function is calculable by supersymmetric localization.\nOne key part of the matching is that the n\u2212 2 three-point functions in (7.10) should match with the one-loop determinants of the n\u2212 2 bifundamental hypermultiplets in the quiver. Thankfully, the three-point functions \u3008V\u03b11V\u03ba$1V\u03b1\u3009 of two non-degenerate and one semi-degenerate vertex operators were worked out in [136, 337, 338] by inserting a fully degenerate vertex operator V\u2212b$1 into the correlator and solving a differential equation that results.58 Consider the normalization (7.4) of non-degenerate operators and an ad-hoc normalization\nV\u0302\u03ba$1 = \u03bb\u3008\u03ba$1,\u03c1\u3009\n(\u03a5b(b))N\u22121\u03a5b(\u03ba) V\u03ba$1 (7.11)\nwhich is Weyl-invariant but is an abuse of notation since V\u0302 does not relate to V in the same way as in (7.4). Then the three-point function is [136]\nC\u0302(Q+ a1,\u03ba$1, Q+ a2) = 1\u220fN\ni,j=1 \u03a5b(\u03ba/N \u2212 \u3008a1, hi\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a2, hj\u3009) (7.12)\nwhere hi are the weights of the fundamental representation of su(N). The product of Upsilon functions correctly coincides with the one-loop determinants of N2 hypermultiplets\n58This bootstrap technique was introduced by Teschner to solve Liouville CFT. See also [68, 350\u2013352] for further explorations in the Toda CFT context with more general fully degenerate vertex operators. See [353, 354] for other related correlators.\non S4b with suitable masses. The inverse two-point functions match with vector multiplet one-loop determinants, see below (7.5). The classical action also reproduces correctly the leading z-dependence of the Toda CFT correlator. Finally, one can tediously match conformal blocks with instanton partition functions order by order, to confirm (7.8).\nThe Toda correlator in (7.8) can be decomposed in principle in many other channels. For instance taking the OPE of the semi-degenerate vertex operators V\u0302\u00b51 and V\u0302\u00b52 in the four-point function (n = 4) yields a t-channel decomposition. In the N = 3 case, the internal momenta produced by this fusion are non-degenerate, so that the decomposition involves general three-point functions. The corresponding S-duality frame of SU(3) SQCD consists of the Tsu(3) tinkertoy (the e6 Minahan\u2013Nemeschansky SCFT) coupled to some hypermultiplets by a gauge group that turns out to be SU(2). For general N , such fusions lead to numerous types of punctures intermediate between the full and the simple puncture.\nPartial Higgsing. Consider the linear quiver in (7.8). Its Higgs branch consists of supersymmetric vacua where hypermultiplet scalars get a VEV. Upon moving to any given point on the Higgs branch, the hypermultiplet VEV may break gauge symmetry to a smaller group, thus reducing the quiver to a smaller one.\nWe denote scalars in the bifundamental hypermultiplets as (Qj , Q\u0303j) for j = 2, . . . , n\u22121. An important class of vacua are obtained by imposing a nilpotent VEV to the moment map (see e.g. the appendix of [355])\n\u00b51 = Q\u03032Q2 \u2212 1 N Tr(Q\u03032Q2) (7.13)\nof the leftmost SU(N) flavour symmetry group. Nilpotent matrices in su(N)C = sl(N,C) are classified up to conjugation by a partition of N , or equivalently a Young diagram Y with N boxes. Denoting by nk the number of columns of length k in Y , the nilpotent VEV we consider takes the block-diagonal form\n\u3008\u00b51\u3009 = J\u2295n11 \u2295 J \u2295n2 2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 J \u2295n` ` (7.14)\nwith nk Jordan blocks Jk of size k \u00d7 k (for instance J1 = (0)). The VEV \u3008\u00b51\u3009 cannot be imposed in isolation, as the F -term relations lead to non-vanishing values for the hypermultiplets (Qj , Q\u0303j) for j = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , `.\nThe Higgs mechanism thus breaks multiple gauge symmetries. Specifically, it reduces the first few groups of the quiver to a quiver tail\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 N` N`\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 N1\nn` n`\u22121 n1\n(7.15)\nwhere round nodes are SU(Nj) gauge groups, rectangles count fundamental hypermultiplets, and Nj is determined by N0 = 0 and Nj \u2212Nj\u22121 = nj + nj+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ n` (which is\nthe length of the j-th row). In other words, Nj counts all boxes in rows 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , j and in particular N` = N . The flavour symmetry is[\u220f\u0300\nk=1 U(nk)\n] /U(1)diag. (7.16)\nThe puncture has n1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + n` \u2212 1 = N1 \u2212 1 mass parameters. The nilpotent matrix (7.14) can also be understood as the image of the raising operator under an embedding \u03c1 : SU(2) \u2192 SU(N). In that equivalent description, the flavour symmetry (7.16) arises as the commutant of \u03c1.\nQuiver tails and punctures. Starting from a quiver tail (7.15) and its SW solution obtained from M-theory [178], Gaiotto understood in [1] the relevant patterns of pole orders for the differentials \u03c6k. This helped determine that tame punctures are labeled by partitions of N . Linear quivers with arbitrary quiver tails are realized in class S as the reduction of X (su(N)) on a sphere with arbitrarily many simple tame punctures and with two (general) tame punctures.\nIn fact, the partial Higgsing procedure we described replaces the full tame puncture (that we started with) by precisely the tame puncture labeled by Y . Just as full tame punctures carry SU(N) flavour symmetry, the puncture carries flavour symmetry (7.16). The dictionary between quiver tails, punctures, and the order of poles, is nicely written in [6].\nPunctures can be closed entirely. This is most easily seen for the simple punctures in (7.8): on the gauge theory side, two neighboring SU(N) groups are reduced to their diagonal subgroup, and we are left with a shorter linear quiver.\nPartially degenerate vertex operators. Partial Higgsing translates on the Toda CFT side to changing a non-degenerate vertex operator to a partially degenerate one.\nAccording to footnote 56, level 1 null WN descendants of a vertex operator V\u03b1 are characterized by roots e for which \u3008\u03b1 \u2212 Q, e\u3009 = \u2212b \u2212 1/b. Up to a Weyl group transformation of \u03b1\u2212Q, we choose these roots be simple roots ej only. The condition then reduces to \u3008\u03b1, ej\u3009 = 0, namely \u3008\u03b1, hj\u3009 = \u3008\u03b1, hj+1\u3009 in terms of the weights hi of the defining representation of su(N). The components \u3008\u03b1, hi\u3009 of \u03b1 organize as\n\u03b1 = ( \u03b1(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1(1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nl1\n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1(r), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1(r)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 lr\n) (7.17)\nwhere lk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r denote the number of equal components, and we can reorder the components such that l1 \u2265 l2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 lr \u2265 0 defines lengths of columns of some Young diagram Y . This is the same Young diagram classification as for the punctures. For instance the momentum has r \u2212 1 parameters (because of tracelessness), which is the length of the first row of Y (minus one) thus matches the counting in (7.16).\nThe precise proposal in [336] is that a tame puncture labeled by Y corresponds to a vertex operator with momentum\n\u03b1 = ( b+ 1\nb\n) \u03c1Y +mY , (7.18)\nwith mY the mass parameters for the flavour symmetry (7.16) and \u03c1Y the projection of the Weyl vector \u03c1 onto the subspace with the multiplicities (7.17). For the full puncture case Y = 1N we have \u03c1Y = \u03c1, while for the simple puncture Y = (N \u2212 1) + 1 one finds \u03c1Y = (N/2)$1. In both cases the proposal reproduces (7.9).\nPunctures: nilpotent orbits, Nahm, Hitchin, and Toda. For the A-type case g = su(N) we have seen that tame punctures are labeled by partitions of N . A broader perspective is that tame codimension 2 defects of X (su(N)) are labeled by such a partition. The D-type case and USp\u2013SO quiver tails are considered in [6].\nFor general 6d (2, 0) theories X (g), there are (at least) three sets of data that equivalently characterize the defect.59\n\u2022 Nahm data. A nilpotent orbit ON \u2282 gC that describes a Nahm pole boundary condition for SYM with gauge group G. This arises by considering X (g) on R2,1 \u00d7 cigar \u00d7 S1 with the defect at the tip of the cigar. Reducing first on the circle direction of the cigar gives 5d N = 2 SYM with gauge group G, with a Nahm pole boundary condition.\n\u2022 Hitchin data. A nilpotent orbit OH \u2282 gC with additional discrete data. Within the same R2,1\u00d7cigar\u00d7S1 geometric setup, reducing first on S1 gives a codimension 2 defect in 5d, then reducing the cigar to a half-line gives the S-dual of the Nahm pole boundary condition. This data was studied early on in [356].\n\u2022 Toda data. A partially degenerate primary operator of g Toda CFT specified by its null Wg descendants.\nNahm and Hitchin data were related in [100]. The relation to Toda data was understood in [318] for the case where e is principal nilpotent inside some Levi subalgebra of g, see also [357, 358].\nThe same classification holds for codimension 2 operators in the 6d (2, 0) little string theory with Lie algebra g (which implies the classification for X (g)). The approach in [342, 359, 360] is to realize little strings as IIB strings on a C2/\u0393 singularity, where the defect consists of D5 branes wrapping certain non-compact two-cycles in C2/\u0393.\nNon-simply-laced gauge groups. Reducing X (g) on a circle yields 5d N = 2 SYM with gauge algebra g, which is simply-laced. Non-simply-laced gauge groups are achieved by twisting, namely changing the periodicity of fields,60 by an outer automorphism of g.\n59Help welcome to complete the references. 60This notion of twist is unrelated to the partial topological twist used to preserve supersymmetry\nwhen reducing X (g) on C.\nLikewise, class S includes 4d N = 2 theories with arbitrary gauge groups: these are obtained by including (outer automorphism) twist lines that may end on punctures. This direction was explored in [96, 98, 99, 318] (see also [361]). See Figure 4 for an example with g = so(2N) and its reformulation as a su(2) class S theory for N = 2 since so(4) = su(2)2."

They admit a broad generalization to \u201cwild\u201d defects, introduced by Witten [362] in the context of surface operators in 4d N = 4 SYM. These defects impose a stronger blow-up near their support for the \u201cfields\u201d of the 6d theory.\nWild punctures from collisions. We recall the massive tame puncture (4.2)\n\u03d5(z) \u223c (diag(m,\u2212m)\nz \u2212 zi +O(1)\n) dz =\u21d2 \u03c62(z) = ( m2\n(z \u2212 zi)2 +O ( 1 z \u2212 zi )) dz2 (7.19)\nand its massless version (4.4). Colliding l such simple poles of \u03d5, while scaling appropriately the mass parameters, leads to a pole of order l, hence generically to \u03c62 \u223c dz2/(z \u2212 zi)2l. Just as their tame counterparts, the resulting wild punctures of level l can be partially closed by imposing some relations between eigenvalues in the series expansion of \u03a6z, so that the pole of \u03c62 has an order lower than 2l.\nThe collision limits can have two main effects on the 4d gauge theory: decoupling some hypermultiplets by making them massive while keeping the dynamical scale \u039b fixed, or tuning the theory to an AD point on the Coulomb branch [2, 363\u2013365] at which point the theory becomes a strongly-coupled isolated SCFT.\nFor the case g = su(2) that we consider for now, wild punctures are labeled by the order of the pole of \u03c62 (which is 2 for a tame puncture), and of course by coefficients of the expansion at these poles. By cutting the Riemann surface along circles as in the tame case, su(2) class S theories can be constructed by gauging SU(2) flavour symmetries of\nthe trifundamental half-hypermultiplet T2 (corresponding to a sphere with three tame punctures) and of theories Xp corresponding to a sphere with a tame puncture and a wild puncture at which \u03c62 has a pole of order p > 2. See Figure 5. Spheres with a single wild puncture cannot be cut into these building blocks and lead to other interesting theories Yp. This exhausts su(2) class S.\nExamples of theories with wild punctures. Just for this explanation we denote by (p1 p2 . . . pk) the class S theory obtained for a sphere with k punctures at which \u03c62 has poles of order p1, . . . , pk, respectively. Let us exemplify both effects above starting from SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD, realized as (2 2 2 2) in this notation, namely by taking C to be a sphere with four tame punctures. We first decouple hypermultiplets.\n\u2022 SU(2) Nf = 3 SQCD arises from (2 2 4), a sphere with two tame punctures and one wild puncture of order 4, obtained as a collision of two tame punctures.\n\u2022 SU(2) Nf = 2 SQCD appears in two ways in class S. First, as (4 4) obtained from (2 2 4) by colliding the two tame punctures. Alternatively, as (2 2 3): one can decouple the hypermultiplet by tuning a mass parameter of the wild puncture in the (2 2 4) description of the Nf = 3 theory, and this reduces the pole of \u03c62 at the wild puncture from order 4 to order 3. A consistency check is that the two constructions lead to equivalent SW geometry.\n\u2022 SU(2) Nf = 1 SQCD then appears as (4 3).\n\u2022 Pure SU(2) SYM appears as (3 3) with two minimally wild punctures.\nThere are further collision limits, which turn out to realize AD theories. By colliding the two wild punctures in the (4 3) realization of SU(2) Nf = 1 SQCD we get a single wild puncture of rather high order (7): this is the Y7 theory mentioned above. The AD point (most singular point) of the Coulomb branch of SU(2) Nf = 2 is obtained by colliding punctures (4 4)\u2192 (8) or (2 2 3)\u2192 (2 5), both punctured curves C turning out to give the same 4d SCFT (namely Y8 ' X5). For SU(2) Nf = 3 we find the collision (2 2 4)\u2192 (2 6), which is X6. Of course, these limits all translate to tuning parameters on the gauge theory side and were thus found a long time ago [2, 363], but the class S realization embeds them in a broader setting.\nExercise 7.1. Recall the SW curve (4.13) of the su(2) class S theory for a four-punctured sphere: x2 = u2(z) with\nu2(z) = q zm 2 1 + q(q\u22121) z\u2212q m 2 2 + z\u2212qz\u22121m23 + zm24 \u2212 u\nz(z \u2212 q)(z \u2212 1) .

The collision of n \u2265 2 vertex operators yields irregular operators denoted In\u22121, which depend on the original n momenta (suitably rescaled). Their Ward identities with the stress tensor involve poles of the same order 2n as the pole of \u03c62 on the gauge theory side that arises in the same collision.

The decoupling of hypermultiplets starting from SU(2) Nf = 4 SQCD or N = 2\u2217 SYM, and its effect in the AGT corespondence, were studied in [94, 368\u2013375]. Higher-level irregular states (BMT states) of the Virasoro algebra were investigated in [366, 367, 376\u2013380], and generalizations to W-algebras in [99, 378, 381\u2013383]. On the CFT side, collisions of primary operators and direct definitions of irregular states were made by Rim and collaborators [377, 379, 380, 384\u2013391], and others [68, 392\u2013401].\nFurther directions. Some AD theories were found at particular points on the Coulomb branch of Lagrangian gauge theories, and as appearing in S-dual descriptions in [2, 169, 363\u2013365, 402]. Class S constructions of a variety of AD theories and related topics are in [6, 8, 403\u2013410] and in Xie\u2019s work with collaborators [411\u2013423]. It is not expected that class S theories exhaust all possible 4d N = 2 theories (see e.g. [424]). Besides a classification of Lagrangian field theories [425, 426], and a program to classify theories according to their Coulomb branch geometry [427\u2013435], other constructions of 4d N = 2 theories have been explored [406, 414, 416, 417, 419, 436\u2013447].\nAn interesting tool to check the AGT correspondence even in the absence of Lagrangian descriptions of the class S theories is to compute central charges and anomalies. The central charge of Toda CFT (and generalizations) was matched with a reduction to 2d of the anomaly 8-form of the 6d (2, 0) theory X (g) in [19, 22, 448, 449].

Let \u03d5 be the scalar in one of the vector multiplets (corresponding to a tube), and consider gauge-invariants such as Tr\u03d5l in the A-type case, and more generally all Casimirs of g. Classically, they appear as coefficients of the differentials \u03c6k and can thus be retrieved as certain weighted integrals of \u03c6k. Going back to general 1, 2, the operator Tr\u03d5l on the 4d side corresponds to a suitable weighted integral of currents W\u0303l [19].62 For instance, inserting Tr\u03d52 takes a derivative of ZS4\nb with respect to gauge couplings [460\u2013462], namely\nto the shape of C, which indeed translates to an integrated insertion of the holomorphic stress-tensor T = W\u03032.\nCorrelation functions on S4b with (products of) Tr\u03d5j inserted at one pole and Tr \u03d5\u0304k at the other can be computed by supersymmetric localization, although the operators complicate instanton counting.

The reduction of X (g) on this tube gives 5d N = 2 SYM on an interval, and the codimension 4 defect gives a line operator, specifically a Wilson loop, which depends additionally on a choice of representation R of g. In fact this is the clearest way to see that codimension 4 operators\nof X (g) should depend on such a representation of g. Further reduction to 4d gives a half-BPS Wilson loop measuring the holonomy of the corresponding gauge field A\u03b3 along L, plus some contribution from scalar superpartners to ensure supersymmetry:\nW\u03b3,R = TrR ( Pexp \u222b L ( A\u03b3 + scalars\u03b3 )) . (8.3)\nThe gauge group G\u03b3 and the Wilson loop only depend on the homotopy class of \u03b3. On the 2d CFT side the corresponding object is a certain 1d topological defect along \u03b3 called a degenerate Verlinde loop operator. Verlinde loops are constructed as monodromies of a vertex operator V\u03c9. The specific choice corresponding to W\u03b3,R is to take a momentum \u03c9 = \u2212b\u00b11\u2126R, where \u00b1 depends on the choice of circle L, while \u2126R is the highest weight63 of the representation R. For this choice of \u03c9, the vertex operator V\u03c9 is degenerate in the sense that it is annihilated by various combinations of W-algebra generators. Incidentally, the most general degenerate momentum \u03c9 = \u2212b\u2126 \u2212 b\u22121\u2126\u2032 corresponds to inserting Wilson loops along both allowed circles.\nConcrete checks of the correspondence are straightforward. The Wilson loop is compatible with supersymmetric localization [10] and inserts a simple a-dependent factor in (1.7). The Verlinde loop L\u03b3 acts diagonally on a complete set of states inserted along \u03b3 hence appears in the correlator (1.9) simply as a function of the internal momentum \u03b1 (related to a). They match:\n\u3008W\u03b3,R\u3009T(g,C,D)S4 b\n= \u222b da TrR(ea\u03b3 )Zcl(a, q, q)Zone-loop(a)Zinst(a, q)Zinst(a, q)\n= \u222b d\u03b1 f(\u03b1)C(\u03b1)F(\u03b1, q)F(\u03b1, q) = \u2329 V\u0302\u00b51 . . . V\u0302\u00b5nL\u03b3 \u232aToda(g) C .\n(8.4)\nDyonic loop operators. Now consider a pants decomposition of C that does not include \u03b3 among its cuts. The 2d CFT side is still given by a Verlinde loop along \u03b3, but its expression in the given basis of conformal blocks is no longer diagonal: it is\u2329\nV\u0302\u00b51 . . . V\u0302\u00b5nL\u03b3 \u232aToda(g) C = \u222b d\u03b1C(\u03b1)F(\u03b1, q) \u2211 h L\u03b3(\u03b1, \u03b1+ h)F(\u03b1+ h, q) (8.5)\nwhere h ranges over a finite collection64 of momenta related to the weights of R. The corresponding loop operator in 4d is described in this S-duality frame as a \u2019t Hooft or dyonic loop instead of a Wilson loop. Rather than being defined by an insertion in the path integral like the Wilson loop (8.3), a \u2019t Hooft loop on L is defined by imposing a singular boundary condition on the gauge field that prescribes a non-zero monopole charge 12\u03c0 \u222b F on a two-sphere S2 surrounding L. Dyonic loops involve additionally a Wilson loop insertion along the same circle L. The path integral ranges over such singular 63Weights are in h\u2217, which we identify with the Cartan subalgebra h \u2282 g using the Killing form. 64The fusion of a degenerate operator V\u03c9 with another vertex operator has a finite number of terms.\nfield configurations instead of the usual smooth ones, and supersymmetric localization still applies [501] and reproduces (8.5), provided one correctly accounts for monopole bubbling [503\u2013508].\nInterestingly, Verlinde loops must be generalized to Verlinde networks (involving fusion of degenerate vertex operators) to reproduce half-BPS dyonic loops with the most general electric and magnetic charges [46, 51, 52, 516].\nAlgebra of line operators. In light of (8.5), dyonic loops or Verlinde networks can be understood as difference operators acting on functions of internal momenta \u03b1, or equivalently acting on functions on the Coulomb branch B. Inserting dyonic loops at different latitudes y5 yields a product of difference operators, which is non-commutative because the loops cannot be reordered while preserving supersymmetry. The OPE of loop operators provides skein relations that express these products as linear combinations of dyonic loops and defines an algebra A 1, 2 of loop operators (we recall 1 = b/r and 2 = 1/(rb)). Teschner [309, 517] emphasized early on the importance of this algebra in the AGT correspondence; see the reviews [489, 518]. The earlier work [519] concentrated on 4d N = 4 SYM.\nEach pants decomposition of C gives a representation of A 1, 2 as difference operators, in which certain loops are diagonalized (8.4) while others remain nondiagonal (8.5). The modular kernels, which relate conformal blocks in different pants decompositions, simply map between eigenbases of various loop operators, and they can be worked out from A 1, 2 . The eigenbases themselves (instanton partition functions) are then solutions of a Riemann\u2013Hilbert type problem that can be solved. Their 1, 2 \u2192 0 limit is then the low-energy prepotential (5.30). All of this rich content hidden in A 1, 2 led the authors of [309] to call it the \u201cnon-perturbative skeleton\u201d of T(g, C,D).\nIn the Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili (NS) limit 2 \u2192 0 of the algebra A 1, 2 , the difference operators become differential operators on B, which further become coordinates on a torus fibration over B, in the classical limit 1, 2 \u2192 0.65 The geometry simplifies in the NS limit, where S4b degenerates to R2 \u00d7 S2b . Near the loops along the equator of S2b the geometry is R3 \u00d7b S1 with a twisted periodicity around S1, and the twist is removed in the classical limit. Precisely this geometry was considered in [167, 502, 510, 520\u2013523] (on \u201cframed BPS states\u201d). On untwisted R3 \u00d7 S1, vacuum expectation values of the loop operators define coordinates on the Coulomb branchM of the class S theory on R3 \u00d7 S1, which is the aforementioned torus fibration over B. The twisted periodicity of R3 \u00d7b S1 quantizes this algebra of coordinates into an algebra of differential operators, the NS limit of A 1, 2 .\nAs described near (3.14) the R3\u00d7S1 Coulomb branchM can be seen alternatively as the Hitchin moduli space on C, or as the moduli space of flat GC connections on C (where the Lie algebra of GC is the complexification of g). The last point of view fits nicely with the 3d/3d correspondence discussed in subsection 9.3, which involves GC Chern\u2013Simons theory. Further works on the Hitchin system, opers, and Darboux coordinates on M include [50, 343, 356, 366, 415, 488, 524\u2013535] (some are reviewed in [536]); a different\n65Similar to how momentum p \u223c i\u2202x in quantum mechanics is a coordinate in classical mechanics.\ntechnique is based on spectral networks, which abelianize flat connections on C [537\u2013549]; see also [49, 550\u2013552]."

            "text": "Surface operators are reviewed in [458] (for early references, see [553, 554]). Surface operators compatible with supersymmetric localization on S4b can be inserted along two squashed spheres intersecting at the poles or some two-tori, expressed in Cartesian coordinates of an R5 as follows:\nS4b := { y25 + b2(y21 + y22) + b\u22122(y23 + y24) = r2 } ,\nS2b := { y1 = y2 = 0, y25 + b\u22122(y23 + y24) = r2 } ,\nS21/b := { y25 + b2(y21 + y22) = r2, y3 = y4 = 0 } ,\nT 2\u03b8,\u03d5 := { y5 = r cos \u03b8, y21 + y22 = (rb\u22121 sin \u03b8 cos\u03d5)2, y23 + y24 = (rb sin \u03b8 sin\u03d5)2 } .\n(8.6)\nThe latter case has not been studied so we concentrate here on the spheres, on which the surface operators preserve a 2d N = (2, 2) subalgebra of 4d N = 2. Such operators arise either from a codimension 4 operator of X (g) at a point z \u2208 C or from a codimension 2 operator wrapping all of C. (See also [516] on foams of surface operators, [555, 556] on duality defects, [557] for a holographic approach.) The space of couplings of the first type of surface operators is exactly the UV curve C, thus it gives a definition of C directly from the 4d N = 2 theory.\nVortex string operators. We begin with surface operators arising from a codimension 4 operator of the 6d theory placed at a point z \u2208 C and one of the two possible spheres S2b (sign \u201c+\u201d below) or S21/b (sign \u201c\u2212\u201d below). This class of operators is sometimes called M2-brane surface operators because it arises from the addition of M2 branes in the M-theory construction of class S theories. They can also arise via Higgsing a larger 4d theory if the Higgsed field has a non-trivial space-dependent profile [558\u2013560]. Their AGT interpretation is explored in [39, 55\u201363, 66\u201371, 561, 562], in part based on their exact partition functions, studied in [69, 563\u2013576]. The same operators are important in the 5d version and S1 \u00d7 S3b version of the correspondence [64, 65, 190, 570, 571, 577\u2013580]; see also [537, 539, 581\u2013590] for other considerations on this class of surface operators.\nAs we have learned from studying loops, codimension 4 operators carry a choice of representation R of g. On the 2d CFT side we thus want a point operator labeled by R: the natural guess is a degenerate vertex operator V\u03c9 with \u03c9 = \u2212b\u00b11\u2126R, the sign \u00b1 being determined by which squashed two-sphere we use on the 4d side. This suggests an equality\n\u3008surface operator\u3009T(g,C,D) S4 b = \u2329 V\u0302\u00b51 . . . V\u0302\u00b5nV\u2212b\u00b11\u2126R \u232aToda(g) C . (8.7)\nThe right-hand side can be written as an analytic continuation of an (n + 1)-point correlator \u3008V\u0302\u00b51 . . . V\u0302\u00b5n+1\u3009 of non-degenerate vertex operators. The analytic continuation\nin the corresponding class S theory T \u2032 was first understood in [558] in Lagrangian cases66: it amounts to considering a supersymmetric \u201cvortex string\u201d configuration in T \u2032 in which certain hypermultiplet scalars acquire space-dependent VEVs concentrated in codimension 2. In the low-energy limit, the non-zero scalars Higgs some gauge symmetries of T \u2032 down to those of T , and the configuration is effectively described by a surface operator in the theory T .\nDescription as a 4d-2d coupled system. Besides this vortex string construction of surface operators obtained from codimension 4 operators of X (g), these surface operators can be described by coupling to the 4d theory a 2d N = (2, 2) gauge theory living on the defect. In this context the left-hand side of (8.7) is the partition function of the 4d-2d coupled system on squashed spheres. A simple example is that of SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4 and a defect labeled by the K-th symmetric representation. The 2d theory then consists of chiral multiplets in doublet representations of 4d flavour and gauge groups, and in fundamental and antifundamental representations of a 2d U(K) gauge group:\nZS2 b \u2282S4 b  2 2 2 K 4d 2d  = \u2329V\u0302\u00b51 V\u0302\u00b52 V\u0302\u00b53 V\u0302\u00b54V\u2212Kb/2\u232aLiouville S2 . (8.8)\nThe position z of V\u2212Kb/2 matches the Fayet\u2013Iliopoulos (FI) parameter of the 2d U(K) gauge group. Such a 2d description of the most general R in su(N) Lagrangian theories is proposed in [68] and checked by comparing limits z \u2192 zi in gauge theory to the known OPE of V\u2212b\u00b11\u2126R and V\u0302\u00b5i . More general degenerate insertions V\u2212b\u2126\u2212\u2126\u2032/b translate to intersecting defects with extra 0d fields living at the poles where the defects intersect [69]. An important difficulty in checking equalities like (8.8) is to compute contributions Zinst,vort from the poles of S4b , which involve both instantons of the 4d theory and vortices of the 2d theory [574]. Incidentally, in an 1, 2 \u2192 0 limit this 4d-2d analogue of Nekrasov\u2019s partition function gives both the 4d theory\u2019s effective prepotential F and the 2d theory\u2019s effective twisted superpotential W, obtained earlier in [55, 565]:\nlogZinst,vort = F 1 2 + W 1 +O(1). (8.9)\nGukov\u2013Witten operators: monodromy defects and orbifolds. Next we discuss surface operators called M5-brane surface operators, or codimension 2 operators, or orbifold surface defects, studied in [72\u201385, 120, 318, 358, 362, 553, 570, 576, 591\u2013598] and in [359, 360] from the little string theory viewpoint. We have already encountered codimension 2 defects of X (g), since they are the origin of tame punctures that impose certain boundary conditions on the differentials \u03c6k. Wrapping these codimension 2 operators on C thus gives surface operators that impose certain singular boundary conditions on the 4d fields. Specifically, this yields N = 2 versions of Gukov\u2013Witten (GW) surface operators [553], which impose that 4d gauge fields A behave as A \u223c \u03b1d\u03b8 as r \u2192 0\n66It would be good to clarify the situation for the most general class S theories.\nwith a prescribed \u03b1 \u2208 t in the Cartan algebra of g, where (r, \u03b8) are polar coordinates transverse to the defect.\nIf A is an SU(N) gauge field, say, let us denote eigenvalues of \u03b1 = diag(\u03b11, . . . ) as \u03b1i with multiplicities Ni, i = 1, . . . ,M so that \u2211 iNi\u03b1i = 0 and \u2211 iNi = N . Then the\n4d gauge group breaks to (\u220f i U(Ni) ) /U(1) at the defect. The instanton moduli space with such a monodromy defect is equivalent as a complex manifold to the moduli space of instantons on an orbifold C \u00d7 (C/ZM ) [599]. Here, ZM embeds into both rotations of C with charge +1 and the gauge group SU(N) with charges i with multiplicity Ni, thus reproduces the expected symmetry breaking. The Nekrasov partition function Zinst is obtained from the usual one by restricting to ZM -invariant instantons. It matches conformal blocks of the affine SL(N) algebra (for the full defect that has all Ni = 1) [72, 73], or its Drinfeld\u2013Sokolov (DS) reductions [74] more generally.\nThe GW defects can also be described by coupling suitable 2d N = (2, 2) gauge theories to the 4d theory. For pure 4d N = 2 SYM,\nZS2 b \u2282S4 b\n[ N Kn\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 K14d 2d ] = \u2329 V\u0302\u00b51 V\u0302\u00b52 V\u0302\u00b53 V\u0302\u00b54 \u232ageneralization of Toda CFT S2\n(8.10) where Ki = N1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + Ni. While the symmetry algebra is understood, the relevant (non-chiral) CFTs generalizing Toda CFT is not.\nInterestingly, conformal blocks of the affine SL(2) algebra are related to conformal blocks of the Virasoro algebra with additional degenerate vertex operators, as pointed out early on in an AGT setting in [600]. This, and its N > 2 analogues, leads to some identifications between the two types of surface operators up to a suitable integral kernel [532, 601].\nOne should be careful in reading some early 2010\u2019s literature on surface operators in the AGT context, as the two types of surface operators are hard to distinguish in the su(2) case. The \u201ccodimension 2\u201d orbifold C\u00d7 (C/ZM ) considered here should also not be confused with the \u201ccodimension 4\u201d orbifold C2/ZM discussed on page 83, for which ZM rotates both factors. Just as for the C2/ZM orbifold, the C\u00d7 (C/ZM ) orbifold ought to arise as a limit of a 5d gauge theory on C2 \u00d7q S1 for a suitable root of unity limit of q, t."

            "text": "The AGT correspondence also allows for half-BPS 3d operators that separate the 4d spacetime into two parts or give it a boundary. A good starting point is [43].\nSymmetry-breaking wall. A first construction [43] is to place a (tame) codimension 2 defect of X (g) on the equator of S4b , times a closed loop \u03b3 \u2282 C. The gauge theory description is understood in terms of the gauge group G\u03b3 defined on page 84. The boundary conditions for the 4d vector multiplet are similar to those near a GW surface defect, and they define a symmetry-breaking wall where gauge symmetries reduce to a subgroup H \u2282 G\u03b3 . On the CFT side the situation is similar to loop operators, and one\ngets the Verlinde loop on \u03b3 constructed by inserting the vertex operator V\u03b1 associated to the defect and moving it around \u03b3.\nThe continuous parameters of \u03b1 (of the codimension 2 defect) are FI parameters of the unbroken gauge symmetry H on the wall. General vertex operators can also include a discrete part, and correspondingly tame codimension 2 defects that are not full can be dressed with additional codimension 4 defects living on their world-volume. In the present construction this leads to Wilson loop operators in representations R1 and R2 of H on the two circles of subsection 8.2. These loops are stuck on the domain wall unless R1 (resp. R2) are representations of G itself.\nJanus wall. Our second construction does not involve codimension 2 or 4 operators. Instead, we place X (g) on S4b \u00d7 C with the complex structure of C varying with the latitude of S4b [43]. This preserves half of the supersymmetry and in the limit where the variation happens sharply at the equator (or a parallel) we get a so-called Janus domain wall [602\u2013607] in the 4d theory. This is a half-BPS interface between class S theories with different gauge couplings. The partition function with this interface has the usual factorized form (1.7) with holomorphic and antiholomorphic contributions from the poles, but the gauge couplings used in each factor are not complex conjugates. Correspondingly, the CFT correlator (1.9) changes to using different complex structures for the holomorphic and antiholomorphic factors.\nS-duality wall. Tuning gauge couplings we can get theories that are S-dual. By switching to the same S-duality frame on both sides we get a 3d operator called the S-duality wall [608] that has the same theory (and same gauge couplings) on both sides. Inserting an S-duality wall in a 4d theory amounts on the 2d side to performing a modular transformation (fusion, braiding, S-move) on holomorphic (or antiholomorphic) conformal blocks. This is related to special cases [87, 89, 609, 610] of the 3d/3d correspondence we discuss in subsection 9.3. The S-duality wall has an interplay with loop operators: it translates in a suitable sense from Wilson loops on one side of the wall to \u2019t Hooft loops on the other side.\nFor instance, the S-duality wall of 4d N = 4 SYM is equivalent to coupling a 3d N = 4 theory T [G] to SYM on both sides of the wall [608], and the S-move kernel is expected [86] to match the S3b partition function of T [G]. For g = su(N), the wall theory is a 3d N = 4 linear quiver,\nZS3 b\n[ N N\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 ] = (WN algebra S-move kernel). (8.11)\nThe known braiding kernel [611, 612] for Virasoro four-point conformal blocks led to a description [88] of the S-duality wall of 4d N = 2 SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 4, as 3d N = 2 SU(2) SQCD with Nf = 6, suitably coupled to the 4d theories on both sides.\nBootstrapping the braiding kernel of WN four-point conformal blocks led to a description [90] for the S-duality wall of SU(N) SQCD as U(N \u2212 1) SQCD (with a 3d monopole superpotential understood in [613]), coupled by cubic superpotentials to the 4d theories\non both sides of the wall,\nZ  U(N\u22121) 2N N\nN\n4d\n4d\n = (WN algebra braiding kernel). (8.12)\nJust like the T [G] theories, this 3d N = 2 theory (in isolation, after decoupling the 4d fields) admits numerous dualities [614]. Duality walls of 5d theories were studied in [615, 616].\nBoundary CFT. We mentioned orbifolds earlier. Instead of orbifolding the 4d space one can orbifold by a Z2 symmetry that acts as a reflection with respect to the equator of S4b and a reflection on the Riemann surface (so as to preserve chirality of X (g)). This leads to an AGT correspondence for Riemann surfaces with boundaries and for non-orientable surfaces [91, 92]. On the gauge theory side, one obtains simultaneously some gauge fields defined on the squashed hemisphere HS4b and others on the squashed projective space RP4b . The hemisphere partition function was evaluated in [617] while the projective space partition function is obtained in [91] by the gluing technique explored further in [249, 250].\nThe inclusion of boundary operators has not been fully elucidated. It would also be interesting to go beyond the g = su(N) case treated so far, for instance understanding how the double-cover construction discussed below (5.38) interacts with the Z2 quotient that produces the Riemann surface boundaries.\nAGT correspondence in some other geometries\n\u2022 For 5d N = 1 lifts of class S theories, Zinst and ZS5 match q-deformed Toda conformal blocks and correlators.

For a review, see [151].68\nInstanton partition functions. The 4d N = 2 Omega background used to define Nekrasov\u2019s instanton partition function [12, 13] is conveniently expressed in terms of a 5d N = 1 lift: placing the theory on R4 \u00d7 S1 with twisted boundary conditions around S1 such that R4 rotates by q and t in two two-planes, and with an additional twist by an R-symmetry to preserve some supersymmetry. More precisely, this definition for |q| = |t| = 1 can be extended to complex q, t by turning on additional supergravity fields. The 5d lift deforms all factors in Zinst from rational functions to trigonometric functions of masses and Coulomb branch parameters. It is natural to ask how the Toda CFT side of the AGT correspondence can be deformed to accomodate for this.\nOne finds that the 5d (also called K-theoretic) Zinst is a chiral block for a q-deformed W-algebra [35, 113, 229, 340, 341, 618\u2013620]: the relevant deformations of the Virasoro algebra and of W-algebras were constructed long ago [621\u2013624] (see [625] for a modern construction).69 When mass and Coulomb branch parameters are suitably quantized the equality can be proven using Dotsenko\u2013Fateev integral representations of qWN conformal blocks [67, 304, 307, 342, 626] (also used in [627]). See also [272, 628].\nThe 5d N = 1 quiver gauge theories admit realizations in terms of webs of (p, q) fivebranes in IIB string theory [7]. Applying S-duality exchanges the role of D5 and NS5 branes, thus equating Zinst for a SU(N)M\u22121 linear quiver gauge theory to an SU(M)N\u22121 one (see [629] for a proof for M = N = 2). This 5d spectral duality (also called fiber-base duality [630]) relates in general chiral blocks of different qWN theories [631, 632], it implies certain instances of 3d mirror symmetry [585], and relations between spin chains [633]. When reading the literature, one should keep in mind which of the two spectral duality frames is adopted, see [634] for a nice explanation.\nThe 4d case is retrieved as the limit q \u2192 1 with t = q\u2212\u03b2 and fixed \u2212\u03b2 = b2 = 1/ 2 giving the 4d deformation parameters. Other interesting limits than q, t \u2192 1 exist, especially taking q and t a k-th roots of unity one obtains Nekrasov partition functions on C2/Zk ALE space studied in [29, 33, 35\u201337, 85, 635]. Another simplifying limit is the Hall-Littlewood limit q \u2192 0 [281, 282].\n68I thank Fabrizio Nieri for answering my questions thoroughly. 69As in 4d, working with U(N) rather than SU(N) gauge groups makes Zinst more tractable; correspondingly one works with the Ding\u2013Iohara algebra, a slight extension of (the universal envelopping algebra of) the qW-algebra of type g [267].\nAn unrelated application of Zinst and qWN conformal blocks is to construct solutions of q-Painlev\u00e9 equations [636\u2013639], as in the 4d case.\nCompact partition functions. Let us now glue instanton partition functions together. While the partition function on S4 involves a pair of instanton contributions from the two fixed point of the supercharge squared, the partition function of 5d N = 1 theories on S5 combines three K-theoretic instanton partition functions because the supercharge has three fixed circles [640]. Schematically,\nZS5 = \u222b daZpertZinst,1Zinst,2Zinst,3. (9.1)\nThe squashed S5 has three axis lengths \u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93 and here the different Zinst,i are computed in the \u2126 background with parameters (q, t) given by (\u03c92\u03c91 , \u03c93 \u03c91 ), (\u03c91\u03c92 , \u03c93 \u03c92 ), (\u03c91\u03c93 , \u03c92 \u03c93\n), respectively.\nThe picture that emerges [64, 339, 577] is that there exists a q-deformed version of Toda CFT, called q-Toda theory,70 that has qWN symmetry and whose correlators should match with S5 partition functions. The fact that three chiral factors need to be combined leads to a remarkable \u201cmodular triple\u201d of q-Virasoro algebras [114] (for N = 2), similar to the modular double combining Uq(sl(2)) with q = e2\u03c0ib\n2 and q = e2\u03c0i/b2 in 2d CFT. A non-local Lagrangian for q-Liouville is proposed in [114].\nHalf-BPS operators with 3d N = 2 supersymmetry played an important early role right from the start. On the squashed S5 they can be inserted along three distinct S3 that intersect pairwise along S1. The first explorations of the correspondence for ZS5 concerned the case of a single 3d operator in a simple 5d bulk theory, which can be obtained by Higgsing a larger 5d theory [64, 577, 641]. Just as the analogous surface operators in the standard AGT correspondence, these 3d operators correspond to degenerate q-Toda CFT vertex operators. They are useful to bootstrap structure constants of q-Toda, and show up in a Higgs branch localization expression of the instanton and S5 partition functions [189, 190, 642], again completely analogous to the 4d story [188, 571], albeit more technically involved. A mathematical take on this is in [284].\nCodimension 4 operators of the 5d theory, specifically Wilson loops, are studied in [643]; they translate in q-Toda to stress tensor and higher-spin operator insertions.\nGeometric setup. The correspondence is partially understood geometrically through 6d (2, 0) little string theories. Contrarily to the SCFTs X (g), little string theories can only be reduced on zero-curvature surfaces, so the choice of Riemann surface and punctures is restricted. When reducing on a cylinder with full punctures at the two ends, one would expect a 4d reduction but the string winding modes give instead a 5d N = 1 theory on the T-dual circle times R4. The correct limits to reproduce the 4d/2d AGT correspondence and a dual version were discussed in [644, 645].\n70One should be careful that many papers talk about q-Liouville or q-Toda theory even when they only consider chiral blocks, which only involve the q-Virasoro and qWN symmetry algebras.\nIt is not clear at this point what q-Toda theory really is, in particular whether it is fundamentally a 2d theory that can only be placed on zero-curvature surfaces, as suggested by the little string construction, or whether it should be thought as a 1d theory in order to obtain an effective Lagrangian [114].\nElliptic lift. Lifting one dimension up, 6d partition functions on R4\u00d7T 2 (twisted) and S5 \u00d7 S1 (superconformal index) [646] are related to the elliptic deformation (q, t)-Toda: see [272, 306, 647\u2013660].\n9.2 Superconformal index and 2d q-YM\nWe now move on to partition functions of 4d N = 2 class S theories on M4 = S3 \u00d7 S1.\nSupersymmetric index. See the review [661] for superconformal class S theories and [662] for general 4d N = 1 theories. We shall not write too much here, but we rather point to another course in this school [663]. The AGT relation to q-YM is also surveyed briefly in [118].\nThe S3 \u00d7 S1 partition function is defined and computable for 4d N = 1 theories with an anomaly-free U(1) R-symmetry. Up to a factor involving the Casimir energy of the theory, expressible in terms of a and c anomalies, the partition function coincides with the supersymmetric index, defined to be the Witten index of the theory quantized on S3 \u00d7 R. Once refined by fugacities ui for mutually commuting rotations, flavour, and R-symmetries (with charges Ki), the index is written as\nI(u) = Tr [ (\u22121)F e\u2212\u03b2H\u0303 \u220f i uKii ] (9.2)\nwhere (\u22121)F counts bosonic and fermionic states with opposite signs, H\u0303 = {Q,Q\u2020} for some supercharge Q, and I is \u03b2-independent thanks to cancellations between bosonic and fermionic states when H\u0303 6= 0. This simplification means that I(u) counts (with signs) short representations of the supersymmetry algebra. Fugacities ui are encoded in the S3 \u00d7 S1 partition function as holonomies around the S1 for background gauge fields coupled to the given symmetry: in particular, fugacities (p, q) for two combinations of rotations and R-symmetries can be understood as a non-trivial fibration of S3 over S1.\nThe index formally does not depend on any continuous parameter beyond these:71 it is an renormalization group (RG) flow invariant and is independent of gauge couplings for instance, thus can be easily computed in any weakly-coupled Lagrangian description. In this way I(u) reduces to a simple signed count of local gauge-invariant operators built from the elementary fields in any given Lagrangian description (in other dimensions nonperturbative objects must be included). Being an eminently computable RG flow invariant makes the index a powerful window into nonperturbative physics of 4d N = 1 gauge theories, especially their IR dualities.\n71In some contexts, this formal invariance of the index fails, which gives wall-crossing phenomena.\nComputing the index is much harder if we have no Lagrangian description, but part of the structure remains: if a theory T is defined by gauging a common flavour symmetry G of two theories T1, T2, then the indices are related schematically as\nI[T ](a1, a2) = \u222b [dz]G Ivec(z) I[T1](a1, z) I[T2](a2, z), (9.3)\nwhere we hid the p, q dependence but kept explicit the fugacities a1 and a2 for flavour symmetries of T1 and T2 commuting with G, which become flavour symmetries of T . The integral over the fugacity z for the symmetry G is done with a suitable measure Ivec, which from the localization point of view is the vector multiplet one-loop determinant. In fact, (9.3) gives a way to compute the index of a non-Lagrangian theory: embed it into a larger theory that is dual to a Lagrangian gauge theory, whose index is computable [664].\nClass S. We now specialize to class S theories, and specifically to superconformal ones. Since the index cannot depend on gauge couplings, it only depends on the topology of the Riemann surface C and the type of punctures. Thus, compared to the standard AGT correspondence, the 2d CFT side should be replaced by a TQFT, as worked out in [665]. Consider the theory T(g, C,D). A flavour symmetry is associated to each puncture zi, i = 1, . . . , n, and we turn on corresponding fugacities ai. For any pants decomposition of C we can express T(g, C,D) as the result of gauging flavour symmetries of a collection of tinkertoys (isolated SCFTs) associated to three-punctured spheres. Through (9.3), the index then reduces to an integral of superconformal indices of tinkertoys. This precisely mimics the structure of correlators in a TQFT:\nI [ T(g, C,D) ] (ai) = \u3008OD1(a1) . . .ODn(an)\u3009some TQFT (9.4)\nfor suitable operators OD that depend on the type of puncture. In analogy to Liouville CFT bootstrap, which relied on using degenerate vertex operators that correspond in gauge theory to surface operators, one can bootstrap the index of all tinkertoy building blocks using surface operators [558]. Adding a surface operator to the index corresponds to acting with a difference operator \u0398 on fugacities associated to any one of the punctures, and by topological invariance it does not matter which puncture. Expressing the result in an eigenbasis of \u0398 labeled by representations \u03bb of g eventually gives\nI [ T(g, C,D) ] (ai) = \u2211 \u03bb (C\u03bb)2g\u22122\u03c6D1\u03bb (a1) . . . \u03c6 Dn \u03bb (an) (9.5)\nfor some structure constants C\u03bb(p, q, t) and wave functions \u03c6D\u03bb (p, q, t; a).72 Wave functions for arbitrary punctures are related to those for full punctures by taking suitable residues in flavour fugacities [666]. The sum may diverge if there are too few punctures or if they are too \u201csmall\u201d, signalling either that the given class S theory does not exist or that the index is not sufficiently refined because there are additional flavour symmetries not associated to any of the punctures.\n72Here we introduced a fugacity t for the additional R-symmetry of 4d N = 2 theories.\nThe wave functions can be computed order by order in p, q, t, but are not known in closed form. In the Schur limit q = t correlators are functions of q only (p-dependent terms are Q-exact), wavefunctions are proportional to Schur polynomials, and the corresponding TQFT is q-deformed 2d Yang\u2013Mills theory [110]. In the more general Macdonald limit p = 0, wavefunctions are essentially Macdonald polynomials in q, t and the TQFT must be deformed by changing the measure in the path integral of q-YM theory [667]. The HallLittlewood limit p = q = 0 turns Macdonald polynomials to the easier Hall-Littlewood polynomials, which only depend on t. The Coulomb limit (t, p\u2192 0 with fixed p/t and q) is also interesting. The 2d TQFT description, which remains quite implicit for general p, q, t, was derived starting from the 6d theory X (g) in [668] (earlier derivations in [669\u2013671] did not account for instanton corrections).\nThe correspondence is tested and extended in natural ways: inserting Wilson\u2013\u2019t Hooft loops at the poles of S3 and correspondingly loops in q-YM [53, 54, 672, 673], inserting general surface operators [65, 567, 578, 590, 674], replacing S3 by the Lens space L(p, 1) = S3/Zp [675\u2013677], taking C to have non-zero area [678], generalizing to D-type gauge groups and non-simply-laced ones (using outer automorphism twists) [679, 680]. The relation with Hilbert series of instanton moduli spaces is explored in [216, 226]. The superconformal index of many AD type theories is also known by now in the Macdonald limit [681\u2013685]. The key open question in this direction seems to be getting a handle on the full parameter space (p, q, t) rather than its p = 0 Macdonald slice."

            "text": "So far we have reduced the 6d (2, 0) theory of type g with a partial topological twist along a Riemann surface. Reducing it instead on M3 \u00d7 C3, with a twist along a threemanifold C3, gives a 3d N = 2 gauge theory on M3. One can add codimension 2 operators of the 6d theory to get analogues of punctures: boundary conditions along knots K1 \u2282 C3 (which we leave implicit in our notation). This defines a large class of 3d N = 2 gauge theories73 T(g, C3,K1). Their supersymmetric partition functions match K1 \u2282 C3 partition functions of complexified Chern\u2013Simons theory. See [150, 686, 687] for reviews and [89, 111, 310, 316, 525, 527, 609, 610, 688\u2013727] for works on this correspondence and its applications.\nNatural building blocks for C3 \\K1 are tetrahedra, and each triangulation of C3 \\K1 yields an explicit gauge theory description of the 3d N = 2 theory as the IR limit of an abelian Chern\u2013Simons theory (and deformations by masses or other parameters). More precisely, this description misses parts of the theory T(g, C3,K1), as pointed out in [698, 699], and these additional branches are still under investigation (see e.g. [725]). Similarly to how changing pants decompositions in the 4d/2d correspondence amounts to S-duality, Pachner\u2019s 2-3 move for triangulated 3-manifolds, which trades two neighboring tetrahedra for three tetrahedra covering the same part of the manifold, yields 3d N = 2 dualities. Contrarily to S-duality, these are not all-scale dualities but only IR dualities.\n73This is not a standard notation; sometimes T(su(N), C3,K1) is denoted TN [C3 \\K1].\nStatement of the correspondence. The 3d/3d AGT correspondence was formulated in [111, 525], after several papers treating less general geometries: either reducing T(g, C3,K1) further on S1 [728] (getting a 2d N = (2, 2) theory), or taking C3 to be a mapping cylinder or torus (Riemann surface fibered over an interval or circle) [87, 610, 729, 730]. The partition function of T(g, C3,K1) on certain manifolds M3 is equal to the partition function on C3 \\K1 of Chern\u2013Simons theory with a gauge group GC whose Lie algebra is the complexification of g. This, in turn, provides invariants of knots and of 3-manifolds. Complex Chern\u2013Simons theory depends on levels (k, \u03c3), one quantized k \u2208 Z and one continuous \u03c3 \u2208 R\u222a iR, related to the choice of M3. Its action is straightforward,\nS = k + i\u03c38\u03c0 \u222b C3 Tr ( A\u2227dA+ 23A\u2227A\u2227A ) + k \u2212 i\u03c38\u03c0 \u222b C3 Tr ( A\u2227dA+ 23A\u2227A\u2227A ) , (9.6)\nwhere A = A + i\u03a6 is a complex gauge field. However, defining Chern\u2013Simons theory completely is subtle when the gauge group is noncompact [731], and in fact the 3d/3d correspondence helps define it for complex gauge group GC [150, 316, 732, 733]. See also [734, 735] for a few applications of complexified Chern\u2013Simons theory.\nThe squashed sphere partition function (M3 = S3b ) corresponds to Chern\u2013Simons at level k = 1 [111, 310]. The supersymmetric index (M3 = S2 \u00d7q S1) corresponds to Chern\u2013Simons at level k = 0 [311, 312, 689].74 The partition function on a squashed lens space M3 = L(k, 1)b corresponds to a general Chern\u2013Simons level k [316, 732]. (These supersymmetric partition functions and more are reviewed in [736].)\nZS2\u00d7qS1 [T(g, C3,K1)] = ZC3 [ GC at levels ( 0, \u03c3 ) ], q = e2\u03c0/\u03c3\nZS3 b [T(g, C3,K1)] = ZC3\n[ GC at levels ( 1, 1\u2212b21+b2 ) ]\nZL(k,1)b [T(g, C3,K1)] = ZC3 [ GC at levels ( k, k 1\u2212b 2 1+b2 ) ]\n(9.7)\nAll three can be decomposed into holomorphic blocks [691, 700, 737], which are partition functions on the Omega background R2 \u00d7q S1 or equivalently the cigar D2 \u00d7q S1, and are wave functions on the Chern\u2013Simons side. A semi-classical version of this is that the set of supersymmetric vacua on R2 \u00d7 S1 matches the space of flat GC connections on C3 \\K1 with suitable boundary conditions along K1.\nBoundaries and generalizations. When C3 has 2d boundaries (on which the knot K1 can end), the 3d N = 2 theory lives at the boundary of (and is coupled to) the 4d N = 2 class S theory associated to \u2202C3 [43, 89, 111, 673]. In particular, when C3 is a cobordism, namely \u2202C3 consists of two disconnected components, it is more natural to think of the 3d N = 2 theory as a domain wall between the two corresponding 4d N = 2 class S theories which are only coupled through their common 3d boundary. The construction is thus functorial with respect to gluing. One particularly simple example of the setup was described in [43]: consider C3 = R\u00d7 C where the complex structure of C varies along the R direction; then on the gauge theory side we have the 4d N = 2 theory\n74I don\u2019t know if the differences between [311, 312] have been resolved.\nT(g, C) with a Janus domain wall defined by varying the 4d gauge couplings along one direction. Further works in this direction include [698, 711].\nAs known since Witten\u2019s [738], many knot invariants can be expressed as partition functions or other observables of gauge theories. For a sample of references, see [692, 739\u2013746] and the review [747], as well as calculations of knot invariants through the study of families of superpolynomials in [748\u2013762].\nA different topological twist realizes homological invariants of knots and threemanifolds (monopole/Heegaard Floer and Khovanov\u2013Rozansky homology) in terms of 3d N = 2 theory T(g, C3,K1) partially topologically twisted on a Riemann surface [698, 706, 716]. Holographic calculations [717, 719\u2013722, 763\u2013766] probe or use the correspondence at large N . Dimensional reduction from the 4d N = 2 superconformal index to the 3d N = 2 sphere partition function translates to dimensional oxydation from 2d q-YM to a hyperbolic manifold [675, 767]. The 3d/3d correspondence can also be refined using higher-form symmetries [724]. Half-BPS 2d N = (0, 2) boundary conditions and domain walls of 3d N = 2 theories were studied in [609] and subsequent papers, and one offshoot is the 2d/4d correspondence [112] discussed next."

            "text": "2d/4d correspondence. Reducing the 6d (2, 0) theory on T 2 \u00d7 C4 with a partial topological twist along the four-manifold C4 gives 2d N = (0, 2) supersymmetric gauge theories. This setting has been somewhat less studied, owing to how the topology of four-manifolds is more complicated than for the 4d/2d and 3d/3d correspondences. The relevant twist of the M5 brane action was constructed explicitly in [768, 769].\nA dictionary \u00e0 la AGT is proposed in [112]: the Vafa\u2013Witten partition function on C4 [770] is the superconformal index of the 2d (0, 2) theory, while 4d Kirby calculus translates to dualities of 2d N = (0, 2) theories such as [771]. Four-manifolds with a boundary \u2202(C4) correspond to domain walls between the 3d N = 2 theories associated to \u2202(C4) by the 3d/3d correspondence [609] (see also [772]). Four-manifolds of the form CP1 \u00d7C are considered in [773] and provide an analogue of class S theories. This can be enriched further by inserting defects of the 6d (2, 0) theory. There are several variants: compactifying on S2 \u00d7 C4 [774], generalizing to 6d (1, 0) theories [775], and using a different twist to connect 4-manifold invariants to 2d N = (0, 2) chiral correlators [776, 777]. The abelian case is studied in detail in [778]. See also [779, 780].\nLess supersymmetry. One can learn properties of strongly-coupled 4d N = 1 theories, for instance analogues of Seiberg dualities, from supersymmetry-breaking deformations of 4d N = 2 theories and S-duality [139, 170, 781\u2013787]. These developments have led to finding 4d N = 1 Lagrangian descriptions for 4d N = 2 AD theories that admit no 4d N = 2 Lagrangian description, as done for instance in [410, 788\u2013801] (see also [802] with more supersymmetry). They also lead to new 4d N = 2 that may be \u201cminimal\u201d in the sense of having the smallest central charges (a, c) [797].\nAnother approach to getting 4d N = 1 theories is to consider more general compactifications of 6d N = (2, 0) SCFTs that amount to placing M5 branes on a complex curve\ninside a Calabi\u2013Yau three-fold [355, 361, 528, 784, 791, 803\u2013809]. Generalizations of SW geometry appear to exist [810]. A further reduction yields 3d N = 2 theories [811].\nA particularly natural path to lower supersymmetry arises from orbifolds of the Mtheory setup. The 6d (1, 0) theory of M5 branes at a Zk singularity has very interesting reductions to 4d N = 1 theories called class Sk [615, 674, 812\u2013824], see [825\u2013827] for M5 branes probing more general ADE singularities. In principle this leads to an analogue of the AGT correspondence, but the ZS4 partition function of N = 1 theories suffers some ambiguities, and the instanton partition function is not known (see however a very interesting proposal [240]).\nBeyond these orbifolded M5 branes, there exists a zoo of 6d (1, 0) theories constructed from F-theory [828, 829], reviewed in [119, 830]. Compactifying them further on a torus gives 4d N = 2 supersymmetry, reproducing many class S theories [814]. The set-up has also been studied on a Riemann surface [831\u2013834] or on a torus with fluxes turned on [820, 825\u2013827] to get 4d N = 1 theories, and with surface operators [579, 833, 835]. The reduction from 6d to 5d is also interesting [836].\nTwo other rich families of 4d N = 1 SCFTs are bipartite quivers [837, 838], and D3 branes probing orientifolds of toric singularities [839\u2013843].\nMiscellaneous. By fine-tuning (and analytically continuing) parameters, one gets the AGT correspondence for minimal models [277, 487, 844\u2013848] and a \u201cfinite\u201d version of AGT on the mathematical side [849\u2013851].\nClass S 4d N = 2 theories have also been localized on other geometries: S2 \u00d7 S2 corresponds to Liouville gravity [852], S2 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 I to complex Toda CFT [853], S2 \u00d7 T 2 in [657].\nInstead of reducing M5 branes on product geometries, reducing D3 branes yields a 2d/2d correspondence [854\u2013857], while M2 branes give a 1d/2d correspondence [858, 859]. A 3d/3d N = 1 correspondence was also proposed in [715].\n10 Conclusions\n\u2022 BPS/CFT correspondence: SW curves of quite general 4d N = 2 theories are spectral curves of integrable systems. \u2022 Topological strings give Zinst for theories obtained by reducing (p, q) 5-brane webs, or IIB geometric engineering. \u2022 Matrix models with logarithmic potentials yield Zinst of Lagrangian 4d N = 2 theories. There is plenty more to be said about the AGT correspondence. Most obviously we have not placed this correspondence in the wider context of the BPS/CFT correspondence between 4d N = 2 gauge theories and integrable models underlying SW geometry. We have also omitted the connections to refined topological strings and matrix models.\nIntegrable systems. The SW solutions of many 4d N = 2 theories can be realized as the spectral curve of known integrable systems [860\u2013863], such as the periodic Toda spin\nchain, Calogero-Moser, Ruijsenaars, sine-Gordon etc. As a quite general example, for 4d N = 2 theories of class S it is the Hitchin integrable system [167]. Placing the 4d theory on the Omega background with 2 = 0 (the Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili limit) corresponds to quantizing the integrable system, and turning on 2 yields a further refinement [864]. It is also understood how to include surface operators in these discussions.\nNekrasov has advocated for seeing these considerations as a BPS/CFT correspondence, reviewed in [71, 280, 865\u2013867] (see also [70, 189, 190, 239, 628, 645, 868\u2013870]), which relates supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges (e.g. 4d N = 2) to integrable models and 2d CFT. Since this applies beyond class S theories, one can consider the AGT correspondence as merely an instance of it in which one can make further progress.\nAnother instance is the Bethe/gauge correspondence, which roughly speaking arises in the Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili limit. In this limit, the Omega-deformed 4d N = 2 theories reduce to a 2d N = (2, 2) theory whose properties match with those of quantum integrable systems. For instance the twisted chiral ring of the 2d theory gives quantum Hamiltonian, supersymmetric vacua correspond to Bethe states, and the 2d twisted superpotential is the Yang\u2013Yang function of the integrable system. The limit was studied in [864, 871\u2013891] among others.\nFor further unsorted references regarding integrable models and class S theories, see [57, 211, 279, 292, 400, 524, 530, 561, 584, 593, 609, 633, 634, 748, 864, 883, 892\u2013949].\nTopological strings. Topological strings and their relation with the AGT correspondence are reviewed in [950].\nFor 4d N = 2 theories realized from IIB geometric engineering [630, 951, 952] or as dimensional reductions of 5d N = 1 theories living on (p, q) fivebrane webs, instanton partition functions can be expressed as partition functions Ztop of topological strings, as reviewed in [953]. As advocated in [954] to explain the AGT correspondence, Ztop can be further expressed in terms of Penner-like matrix models with logarithmic potentials [955\u2013 961], which match with Dotsenko\u2013Fateev integral representations of conformal blocks. We return to these matrix models shortly.\nThe topological string partition function Ztop is computed through the topological vertex formalism, developped in [962\u2013965] in the unrefined case 1 = \u2212 2, and for general 1, 2 in two formulations in [966, 967] and [968, 969], whose equivalence is explained in [970] by realizing the refined topological vertex as an intertwiner of the Ding\u2013Iohara\u2013 Miki (DIM) algebra. See also [911, 971\u2013974] for further tests and subtleties, [975, 976] for a world-sheet perspective, [977, 978] for a discussion of dualities that ensure that Ztop is independent of the so-called preferred direction, and [979, 980] for a generalization beyond A-type quivers by introducing new topological vertices. Sometimes, Ztop can instead be bootstrapped using holomorphic anomaly equations [879, 953, 981\u2013986], blowup equations [987], or the quantum curve [988, 989].\nThe calculation in [339\u2013342] of the partition function of TN theories, hence the three-point function of Toda CFT, is particularly interesting. Surface operators and their relation to geometric transition and qq-characters are discussed in [56, 58, 59, 562, 660, 934, 971, 990\u2013992]. Other AGT developments based on the refined topological vertex\ninclude [229, 846, 988, 993\u20131006].\nSymmetries and special polynomials. The renewed interest in refined topological strings in the context of AGT led to developping many families of special polynomials generalizing Jack and Macdonald polynomials, including Macdonald-Kerov functions, generalized Schur functions, elliptic generalized Macdonald polynomials and more: see [598, 762, 1007\u20131020] for recent developments.\nThese developments are based on various underlying symmetry algebras that generalize W-algebras [131, 330] and would deserve a review of their own by someone more qualified. My survey of the literature suggests the following main players. I found the references [268, 1021] useful starting points.\n\u2022 The (centrally-extended) elliptic Hall algebra E\u03c3,\u03c3 introduced in [1022] is an associative algebra generated by um,n for (m,n) \u2208 Z2 with u0,0 = 0, and by commuting generators \u03c3, \u03c3. These are subject to commutation relations expressing [uy, ux] (for some x, y \u2208 Z2) as a polynomial in \u03c3, \u03c3, and the generators uz for z \u2208 Z2 in the segment joining x + y to the origin. The algebra may be thought as the stable limit [1023] E\u03c3,\u03c3 = S\u0308H\u221e of spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) S\u0308Hn. The latter, also called Cherednik algebras, were introduced in [1024] and reviewed in [1025]. The algebra E\u03c3,\u03c3 admits an action of SL(2,Z) by automorphisms, induced by the action on Z2. For any coprime a, b, the subalgebra generated by uma,mb, m \u2208 Z, forms a copy of the quantum group Uq(gl1), and these copies are interchanged by the SL(2,Z) action. Let MU(N) be the moduli space of non-commutative U(N) instantons on C2 (Gieseker framed moduli space). Its equivariant K-theory admits an action of E\u03c3,\u03c3 [1021, 1026, 1027].\n\u2022 The DIM algebra (discovered independently by Ding\u2013Iohara [1028], Miki [1029], and others [1022, 1026]) is an associative algebra depending on complex parameters with q1q2q3 = 1. It is generated by \u03c8\u221210 and ei, fi, \u03c8i for i \u2208 Z, with quadratic relations such as [ei, fj ] = 1(1\u2212q1)(1\u2212q2)(1\u2212q3) ( (\u03b4i+j>0 \u2212 \u03b4i+j<0)\u03c8i+j + \u03b4i+j=0(\u03c80 \u2212 \u03c8\u221210 ) ) .\n\u2022 The quantum toroidal algebra U\u0308q1,q2,q3(gl1), also called quantum continuous gl\u221e, is a quotient of DIM by cubic Serre relations [e0, [e1, e\u22121]] = 0 and [f0, [f1, f\u22121]] = 0. It appeared already in [1029] and is explored in [1030\u20131032]. It is also a specialization of the elliptic Hall algebra E\u03c3,\u03c3 at \u03c3 = 1 [1032], and as such, it acts on the aforementioned equivariant K-theory.\n\u2022 The affine Yangian of gl1 [269, 1033], denoted Y\u0308h1,h2,h3(gl1) for h1 + h2 + h3 = 0 is generated by ei, fi, \u03c8i for i \u2265 0 and relations deriving from those of U\u0308q1,q2,q3(gl1). It is a stable limit of spherical degenerate DAHA. The equivariant cohomology of MU(N) admits an action of Y\u0308q1,q2,q3(gl1) [268, 1021].\n\u2022 The algebra denoted SHc [268, 269] is isomorphic to the specialization of Y\u0308h1,h2,h3(gl1) at h1 = 1 [1033]. It has various constructions, such as the spherical degenerate DAHA of GL(\u221e), or the spherical cohomological Hall algebra (COHA) of the quiver with one vertex and one loop. Up to topological completions, SHc at particular values of the parameters matches the universal envelopping algebra of the WN chiral algebra [268]. This leads to an action of WN on the equivariant cohomology of the instanton moduli spaceMU(N), which explains on the 4d gauge theory side the appearance of the WN symmetry of Toda CFT.\nThe elliptic Hall algebra, DIM algebra, and their numerous degeneration limits were used for AGT-related applications in [36, 281, 282, 385, 642, 648, 651, 929, 944, 970, 978, 980, 1012, 1013, 1017, 1034\u20131043]. As these algebras are intimately related and almost equivalent for physics applications, it is hard to disentangle which precise algebra is relevant to any given physics work. The choice is often based on which generators of the algebra are the most physically meaningful: translating from one presentation of the algebras to another is highly involved, see for instance [1033, 1044].\nFurther algebras have also been considered.\n\u2022 The quantum toroidal algebra U\u0308q1,q2,q3(slk) was introduced in [1045\u20131047]. The relation between different presentations of U\u0308q1,q2,q3(slk) and its analogue Y\u0308h1,h2,h3(slk), and a further classical limit, were explored in [1048\u20131051]. I do not know if there is are analogues of the DIM algebra or of the elliptic Hall algebra for this setting. This class of algebras is relevant to the AGT correspondence in the presence of a Zk orbifold [1052\u20131054], see also perhaps [37].\n\u2022 Just as the WN chiral algebra embeds into SHc, suitable specializations of E\u03c3,\u03c3 contain [1055] qW-algebras and quiver W-algebras, themselves explored further in [84, 135, 625, 634, 645, 654, 659, 777, 868, 870, 1056\u20131073].\n\u2022 A general point of view on BPS algebras is given by COHAs [1066, 1074\u20131077].\n\u2022 The Skylanin algebra also appears in related literature. It is a one-parameter deformation of the quantum group Uq(sl2).\nBased on these generalized symmetry algebras there exists an elliptic version of the refined topological vertex (an intertwiner of the elliptic DIM algebra) [927, 1078\u20131080] for use in the 6d lift of the AGT correspondence, as well as a Macdonald refined topological vertex [656, 660] and an analogue when the 4d spacetime is orbifolded [1053].\nMatrix models. The AGT correspondence (including its q-deformed version) can be explored by studying matrix models [954] since both instanton partition functions and conformal blocks are Penner-like matrix model integrals with logarithmic potentials. See the reviews [140, 308].\nOn the 2d CFT side the matrix model representation arises as Dotsenko\u2013Fateev free-field representations of conformal blocks, which are available provided the sum of\nLiouville/Toda momenta in each three-punctured sphere is suitably quantized. Internal momenta in the conformal block translate to choices of contours in the matrix model integral [289, 1081, 1082]. Moving away from these quantized slices in parameter space requires analytic continuation, which is only completely under control in the g = su(2) case since coefficients in various expansions are known to be rational functions of all parameters in this case.\nThe link between 4d gauge theory and matrix models shows up as an equality of Zinst with the matrix model partition functions [1083, 1084] (directly without going through the topological string Ztop), a matching of the SW curve with the matrix model\u2019s spectral curve and of the SW differential with the 1-point resolvent [60, 370, 894, 1085, 1086]. Both this link and the one with 2d CFT generalize to b2 = 1/ 2 6= \u22121 in terms of \u03b2-deformed matrix models [1083, 1086], to 5d [618, 1083, 1087], to asymptotically free theories [370, 373, 1088\u20131091], to su(N) theories [1087, 1092], to quiver gauge theories [1093] and generalized quivers [1094] (higher genus C), and to an orbifold of R4 [21].\nThe relations are tested in various limits in [373, 1095\u20131099] and proven in some cases [67, 307]. Since the Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili limit 2 \u2192 0 of Zinst quantizes the integrable models underlying a 4d N = 2 theory\u2019s SW solution, matrix models give useful information about integrable models, see for instance [729, 919, 1100\u20131103]. Matrix models have also been studied for applications to wild punctures and AD theories, especially in the classical limit c\u2192\u221e (Nekrasov\u2013Shatashvili limit on the gauge theory side) in [371, 372, 377, 379, 380, 384, 386\u2013391, 1104\u20131108].\nIn another direction, modular properties of (properly normalized) instanton partition functions under S-duality are studied in [218, 219, 224, 225, 573, 996, 997, 1109\u20131120] through matrix model and other techniques. Other works and reviews abound [301, 629, 639, 1121\u20131134], as well as PhD theses [1135\u20131137].\nOther connected topics. We list disparate subjects that are connected in various ways with the AGT correspondence. Reference lists are both less complete and less properly filtered here than elsewhere in the review.\nHolographic duals of the 6d N = (2, 0) theory, of 4d N = 2 class S theories, and in the presence of extended operators are explored in [448, 557, 587, 763, 764, 766, 1052, 1138\u20131156].\nSupersymmetric localization applies to many background geometries, and for a sample of interesting cases see [240, 503, 822, 848, 1157\u20131167] and reviews [1160, 1163]. Resurgence and Borel summability of various expansions of Zinst (and of other exact results from supersymmetric localization) are studied in [468, 514, 1168\u20131173]. These give some insight on how applicable resurgence techniques are in QFT.\nThere are numerous interplays with other properties of 4d N = 2 theories.\n\u2022 Topological anti-topological fusion (tt\u2217 equations) [999, 1174\u20131176].\n\u2022 The chiral algebra that appears as a protected subsector of 4d N = 2 theories [172, 423, 580, 681, 683, 792, 795, 949, 1067, 1177\u20131217] (see also [293, 1218\u20131222] and references thereto).\n\u2022 Gauge/Yang\u2013Baxter equation (YBE) [674, 713, 1223\u20131229] reviewed in [1230]. See also [1231].\n\u2022 The way class S theories are built by combining building blocks through gauging suggests to introduce a notion of theory space [1232, 1233].\n\u2022 Conformal bootstrap: besides the constructions discussed in this review, another interesting method to find QFTs, specifically unitary CFTs, is the conformal bootstrap program started in [1234] and applied to 4d N = 2 theories in [1235]. Some AD theories in particular are located at corners of the regions of parameter space allowed by the bootstrap.\nThe AGT correspondence has increased the interest in several old questions about 2d CFT.\n\u2022 Computing conformal blocks, correlators, and fusion matrices, either through recursion relations [227, 294, 371, 619, 1118, 1236\u20131244], using holography in the large c limit [298, 479, 891, 1245\u20131262], or Chern\u2013Simons theory [1263].\n\u2022 Studying variants of Toda CFT, parafermionic Liouville CFT etc. [1264\u20131266].\n\u2022 Some (disputed) links to the fractional quantum Hall effect [1141, 1267\u20131272].\n\u2022 Isomonodromy problems, as it is now known that conformal blocks (and hence Nekrasov partition functions), Fourier transformed with respect to internal momenta, give solutions to Painlev\u00e9 equations arising in isomonodromy problems for Fuchsian connections [233, 394, 398, 401, 591, 910, 925, 946, 989, 1002, 1106, 1120, 1130, 1131, 1169, 1173, 1246, 1259, 1273\u20131305]; likewise the chiral blocks of the q-deformed Virasoro algebra and qW-algebras give solutions of q-Painlev\u00e9 equations [636\u2013638].\nIncidentally, the Liouville CFT has finally been defined mathematically from its path integral: see [1306, 1307] and references therein. Other mathematical references include the study of 6j symbols of (the modular double of) Uq(sl2) [88], relations to the geometric Langlands correspondence or deformations thereof [517, 644, 1063, 1064, 1308, 1309].\nFinal thoughts. The construction of new theories by dimensionally reduction in various geometrical setups has proven very fruitful. It has led to many new quantum field theories that can be used as building blocks for yet more discoveries. The large number of dualities uncovered in this way can be further enriched by considering extended operators in their various incarnations. I hope that readers will participate in this exciting journey charting the space of quantum field theories!"
