 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the adsorption capacity and kinetics of the nanocellulose/alginate beads for other cationic pollutants besides methylene blue and Cd2+, such as other heavy metal ions or organic contaminants. 

2. Optimize the oxidation process to maximize carboxyl group content while minimizing any negative impacts on bead structure or water flux. This could involve tweaking parameters like oxidant concentration, reaction time, temperature, etc.

3. Incorporate other functional nanomaterials into the beads like graphene oxide or metal-organic frameworks to provide additional adsorptive sites or catalytic effects.

4. Evaluate the performance of bead-packed columns over extended operation times to determine reusability, fouling effects, and long-term stability. 

5. Develop mathematical models to describe adsorption behavior and optimize column design parameters like bead size, bed height, flow rate, etc. for industrial-scale applications.
