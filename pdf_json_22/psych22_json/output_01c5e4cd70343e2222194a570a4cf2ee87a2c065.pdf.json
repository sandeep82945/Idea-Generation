Especially, at risk are frontline healthcare workers who are participating in the care of such patients.\nAim: This study investigated the burden of mental health problems amongst the frontline health workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Ethiopia.\nSetting: East Hararghe Zone of Oromia Region and Harari Regional State, Ethiopia.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three selected hospitals of COVID-19 treatment centers. Simple random sampling was used to select a sample of 423 participants from each hospital. The self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to assess the presence of common mental disorders. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were fitted to identify factors associated with common mental disorders. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05.\nResults: The prevalence of common mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers was 22.6%. Being female, married, having had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working in COVID-19 treatment centers and ICU, having any symptoms of COVID-19, current threemonth use of any substances, and poor social support were found to be strong predictors of common mental disorders in frontline health workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia.\nConclusion: The considerable proportions of frontline health care workers have common mental health problems. Strategies need to address COVID-19 related mental health problems, and integrate psychosocial intervention to support the frontline health workers is paramount.\nKeywords: COVID-19; Ethiopia; frontline; health workers; mental health problems; SARSCoV-2.\nCommon mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic\nin Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study\nhttp://www.sajpsychiatry.org Open Access\nto protect healthcare workers from infection became increasingly scarce and in developing countries where the facility of health delivering systems is not well organised, front-line workers for COVID-19 are more stressed and prone to the development of different categories of mental health problems such as anxiety, suicide, sleep problems, depressive disorders and became martyrs.10,11,12 Early identification and intervention of psychological problems associated with COVID-19 are pivotal to ensure an appropriate response to this pandemic.13,14\nThe common mental disorders (CMD) are high during this pandemic in frontline healthcare workers; these could be because of the burden of their setting, wearing heavy protective personal equipment, making it much more difficult to carry out medical operations or procedures than under normal conditions.15 In addition, strict procedures to be followed, higher demands in the work setting, reduced capacity to use social support and stigma within the communities are putting them at further risk.16,17 These factors, together with the fear of being contagious and infecting others (including the loved ones), could increase the possibility of developing CMD amongst frontline workers.18,19\nTherefore, it is very important to study frontline health workers\u2019 mental health status and the burden of psychological disorder with regard to COVID-19 preparedness or care provision. There are several studies conducted in the developed countries that showed the mental health problems of frontline healthcare workers, but there are limited findings in developing countries. Although the importance of mental wellness amongst healthcare workers is well understood, the burden of common mental health problems related to COVID-19 is not well studied yet in Ethiopia."

A total of 169 (42%) study participants were female. A considerable portion of 137 (34.1%) participants were married. Considering the profession of the participants, 165 (41.0%) were nurses, and 95 (23.6%) were medical doctors. About the educational status of the study participants, the majority 317 (78.9%) of the frontline healthcare workers had a degree and above (Table 1).\nClinical and COVID-19 related variables of the study participants As Table 2 shows, the mean year of experience for the study participants was 5.6 (\u00b1 4.8) years during the data collection period. More than half of the 226 (56.2%) respondents have had direct contact with COVID-19 patients during their working area. Regarding the professionals\u2019 current working unit, 86 (21.4%) were working in COVID-19 treatment centres, and 36 (9%) were working in intensive care units (ICUs). It was also noted that 117 (29.1%) professionals were working in the ward to deliver healthcare services for the patients. As to the time focusing on gathering information about the current pandemic, more than half of the 254 (63.2%) respondents spent two times daily on focusing information about COVID-19. Regarding COVID-19 symptoms of the study participants, 93 (23.1%) have had COVID-19 symptoms during the data collection period (Table 2).\nThe frontline healthcare workers have had to practise different measures of COVID-19 during the time of data collection. Accordingly, 243 (60.4%), 68 (16.9%) and 67 (16.7%) of them were mostly practising proper use of mask, hand washing and social distancing, respectively, but 25 (6%) of them were not practising any type of COVID-19 control measures during the study period (Figure 1).\nSocial support description of the study participants The social support level of the frontline healthcare workers was assessed by using Oslo social support scale which was grouped into poor, moderate and strong social support. Accordingly, 181 (45%) of them had poor social support, 154 (38.3%) had moderate social support and 67 (16.7%) had strong social support.\nSubstance use description of the study participants Concerning any substance use in the lifetime and current time, majority of the frontline healthcare workers 290 (72.1%) never used any substance in their lifetime, and 96 (23.9%)\nTABLE 1: Socio-demographic description of frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, 2021 (n\u202f=\u202f402).\nVariables Category Frequency Percentage Gender Male 233 58.0 Female 169 42.0 Marital status Single 170 42.3 Married 137 34.1 Others\u2020 95 23.6 Ethnicity Oromo 221 55.0 Amhara 113 28.1 Harari 37 9.2 Others\u2021 31 7.7 Educational status Diploma 85 21.1 Degree and above 317 78.9 Profession Nurse 165 41.0 Medical doctor 95 23.6 Pharmacy 74 18.4 Laboratory 19 4.7 Health officer 26 6.5 Others\u00a7 23 5.7\n\u2020, Divorced, widowed and separated. \u2021, Gurage, Tigrai, Silte. \u00a7, Anesthetics, ophthalmologist.\nstudy participants were using some type of substance in the current 3 months.\nCommon mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia Common mental disorders were measured using SRQ-20 and a score more than 7 (seven) denoted the presence of CMD. Based on this finding, the prevalence of the CMD amongst frontline healthcare workers was 91 (22.6%) with 95% CI (18.4, 26.4) (Figure 2).\nFactors associated with common mental disorders amongst frontline healthcare workers In this study, sex, marital status, having direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working units, having any symptoms of COVID-19, current 3-month use of any substances and poor social support were found to be strong predictors of CMD amongst frontline healthcare workers in East Ethiopia (Table 3).\nAbout the sex of the frontline healthcare workers, female participants were found to be 4.5 times more likely to develop CMD (AOR = 4.50, 95% CI = 2.42, 8.43) (Table 3).\nThe frontline healthcare workers who were married were found to be 3.89 times more likely to develop CMD compared with single frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 period (AOR = 3.89, 95% CI = 1.90, 7.95) (Table 3).\nThe participants who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients were found to be 2.80 times more likely to develop CMD compared with the participants who had no direct contact with COVID-19 patients (AOR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.45, 5.40) (Table 3).\nRegarding the frontline healthcare workers working unit, the study participants who had worked in COVID-19 treatment centres and ICUs were found to be 3.45 and 2.15 times more likely to have CMD, respectively, compared with the study participants who were working in the ward (AOR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.45, 8.20 and AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 0.79, 5.85) (Table 3).\nhttp://www.sajpsychiatry.org Open Access\nAbout the frontline healthcare workers who had some symptoms of COVID-19, the participants who had some symptoms of COVID-19 were found to be 4.00 times more likely to develop CMD compared with the study participants who did not experience sign and symptoms of COVID-19 (AOR = 4.00, 95% CI = 2.10, 7.64) (Table 3).\nThe study participants who had used any type of substance in the last 3 months, and those with poor social supports were 2.62 and 2.52 times more likely to have had developed CMD, respectively (AOR = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.30, 5.40 and AOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.01, 6.30) (Table 3)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with CMD amongst frontline healthcare workers during the time of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Accordingly, the prevalence of the CMD amongst frontline healthcare workers who were fighting COVID-19 disease in Ethiopia was 22.6% (18.4\u201326.4). The finding is low compared with the results from China which revealed that a considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (50.4%), anxiety (44.6%), insomnia (34.0%) and distress (71.5%).7 The lower proportion of the current finding might be because of the time of the first exposure of frontline healthcare workers in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment and lack of enough information about the transmission, clinical manifestation and the course of novel coronavirus. This finding is also lower compared with the study conducted during the SARS outbreak in China which showed that 68% of the frontline healthcare workers experienced a high level of stress and 57% developed psychological distress. The lower finding of the current study might be because of the adaptability of the healthcare workers with the COVID-19 pandemic and learned experience from other countries affected by COVID-19.\nThis study also showed that being female sex, married, having a direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working in COVID-19 treatment centres and ICUs, having any symptoms of coronavirus, current 3-month use of any substances and poor social support were found to be strong predictors of CMD amongst frontline healthcare workers.\nThe odds of developing the common mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst female and married frontline healthcare workers were 4.5 and 3.89 times high, respectively. There were consistent findings from a study conducted in Iran25 concluding that the prevalence of anxiety was high amongst female participants. This finding was an inconsistent result with a previously conducted study in Singapore26 which stated that single healthcare workers (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.02, 2.0) developed more psychiatric symptoms during the SARS outbreak. This inconsistent result might be because of an adequate sample of the study participants, psychosocial stressors underlying the occurrence of mental health problems, and the distribution of study participants was different from the current study. The high\nprevalence of CMD amongst married frontline healthcare workers might be because of the fear of being infected and transmitted to their family members including their child or loved one, and the stress of running a household.27\nThe prevalence of CMD was 2.80 and 3.45 times high amongst healthcare workers who had direct contact with patients of coronavirus and had some symptoms of COVID-19, respectively. This result is supported by a previously conducted study in China.28 The high prevalence of mental health problems of those who had direct contact experiencing some symptoms of COVID-19 might be the fear of the lethal effect of coronavirus, fear of the risk of transmission of disease to their families, peer or loved ones.29\nThe healthcare workers who were working in COVID-19 treatment centres and ICUs were found to be 3.45 and 2.15 times more likely to have CMD, respectively, compared with the study participants who were working in the ward. The result is consistent with the finding from China14 that showed that the medical staff working in the COVID-19 treatment centres had a higher prevalence of common mental health problems.\nThis study also revealed the current use of any type of substance and poor social support as predictors of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were observed the high prevalence of CMD amongst participants who had used any substance in the current 3 month and poor social support. The finding supports that good social support is a vital factor in protecting the healthcare workers\u2019 mental well-being and psychological health.6,30,31\nFurthermore, the finding from this study recognises that the long-term working experience in the hospital was protective for the occurrence of CMD. As the work experience is increased by a year, the development of common mental health problems is decreased by 0.9. The low occurrence of mental disorders in the long-duration of work might be because of the life experience gained by the healthcare workers, good copy strategies and interaction with the peer group."

Being female, married, having had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, working in COVID-19 treatment centres and ICUs, having some symptoms of COVID-19, current 3-month use of any substance and poor social support were significantly associated with\nhttp://www.sajpsychiatry.org Open Access\nCMD. Therefore, strategies need to address problems related to mental health and integrate psychosocial intervention to support the frontline healthcare workers.\nEstablishing psychosocial support such as supportive communication in everyday interaction and supporting the healthcare workers who are experiencing distress are of significance to reduce the impact of COVID-19 amongst frontline healthcare workers. The female, married and frontline healthcare workers who have poor social support pay substantial attention to control the disastrous mental health effect of the coronavirus pandemic amongst healthcare workers."
