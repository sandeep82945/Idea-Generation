Apart from unaccounted confounders such as age, sex, muscle mass, or diet, the misperception of constant mass ratios between analyte and corrector over a wide hydration range entails deceptive correction errors foremost at both ends of the hydration spectrum. Mitigating creatininecorrection errors (CRCE) by restricting uCR ranges to 0.3 (0.4)-3 g/L generates high numbers of sample rejects and allows for misleading fluctuations within presumably tolerable uCR ranges, undermining the validity of clinical, forensic, and epidemiological investigations. Methods The CRCE for exemplary total weight arsenic (TWuAs) was analyzed in n= 5599 unselected spot urine samples. After confining data to 14 \u2013 82 years, uncorrected arsenic (uAsUC) < 500 \u00b5g/l, and uCR < 4.5 g/L, the remaining 5400 samples were partitioned, and a calculation method to standardize uAsUC to 1 g/L uCR was developed based on uAsUCstratified power functional regression analysis (PFRA). Findings The obtained standardizing method of variable power-functional creatinine correction (V-PFCRC) represents a progression of reportedly proven simple power-functional CCRC (S-PFCRC) modifications. In contrast to CCRC and S-PFCRC, standardization to 1 g/L uCR by V-PFCRC yielded constant uAsN values over the entire uCR range in all sextiles. Residual bias was largely neutralized in all sextiles of uAsN (R2 9E-06 \u2013 0.04) compared to uAsUC (R2 0.93 \u2013 0.99) and CCRC (R2 0.42 \u2013 0.89). The strongest %CRCEs were found in samples at low concentrations of uCR (SBC -0.96) and/or uAsUC (SBC -0.11). Interpretation Standardization to 1 g/L uCR by V-PFRA allows for more reliable dilution adjustment of spot urinary results than CCRC and S-PFCRC. As an easily adoptable, novel approach, the calculation method developed in this study can minimize residual dilution bias in urinary biomarkers adjusted by uCR, SG, and osmolality. While minimizing sample rejects, V-PFCRC will improve reliability and comparability, particularly of lower concentrated urinary biomarkers in conventional readings and multiple linear regression models.

            "text": "Urine is the most commonly used specimen in occupational and environmental biomonitoring of toxic metals.1 For better practicability and compliance, spot urine is commonly favored over 24-h urine samples, which, unlike spot urine, account for diurnal variation and, to a degree, for hydration. However, the spot urinary concentration of a biomarker expressed as mass per urine volume (e.g., \u00b5g/L) is an unreliable parameter. It primarily depends on hydration, and variable fluid intakes produce significant differences in urinary concentrations, with diluted urines usually yielding lower biomarker readings than concentrated urines (Fig. 1a).2 In the case of urinary arsenic (uAs), more than a third of the variation in spot urinary concentrations could be attributed to dilution.3 To standardize intra- and interindividual concentrations over time, fluctuations in spot urine dilution are commonly adjusted for either by urinary creatinine (uCR) or less frequently by specific gravity (SG) and osmolality as proxies for urinary flow rate (UFR).3 All these conventional methods, however, only partially adjust for variation in diuresis.1,3,4,5,6,7,8 Creatinine (CR), a nitrogenous waste product from muscular energy generation by breaking down creatine-phosphate, has been reported to be nonnegligibly influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, lean muscle mass, meat/creatine intake, and collection time, thus complicating inter- and intraindividual comparisons.6,9,10,11 Furthermore, relations between analyte concentrations and UFR have been determined to be log-linear instead of linear, as wrongly assumed in dilution adjustments by CCRC and specific gravity/osmolality.3,5 Despite these obvious fallacies, CCRC, specific gravity, and osmolality remain the most common default approaches to urinary dilution adjustment. All reasonable suggestions to mathematically account for excretion differences have yet to find their way into common clinical practice.3,4"

            "text": "In CCRC, the analyte concentration is divided by uCR, thus converting the scale of results to the weight of analyte per weight of creatinine (analyte \u00b5g/uCR mg or g). This tends to standardize results because adults excrete CR at a relatively constant daily rate expressed as mg/kg body mass.12 The justification of CCRC is essentially based on three implicit assumptions: 1) Individual and interindividual uCR excretion rates were constant over time and varied only by UFR, while the influences of muscularity, age, ethnicity, exercise level, and diet (vegetarian vs. omnivorous) were negligible compared to the variability in hydration.3,12 2) There was no confounding of CR and analyte by common causal factors or direct causal relationships between the two.2,13 3) The relative ratio between the mass of the analyte and the mass of uCR was preserved with variations in hydration and UFR. All three assumptions are inadequate and gave rise to criticism and even requirements for complete renunciation of CCRC or its substitution by multiple linear\nregression models (MLRM), including uCR as a covariate.14,15 Most objections are directed to the unaccounted factors mentioned in assumption 1, entailing uncontrolled fluctuations of uCR and analyte/uCR ratios.6,8,9,10,13,15 In contrast, the significant flaws in assumptions 2 and 3 appear to be less of a topic in the literature.3\nDependent biological variables standardized by a denominator (here, uCR) generally tend to present unusual statistical properties, potentially impairing the sensitivity and precision of a marker.11,16 To avoid ratio forms of data, it was proposed to take the denominator variable as a covariate (amongst age, sex, or ethnicity) in MLRM.1,2,16,17 The covariate solution, however, is complicated by the eventual role of uCR as a so-called 'collider', potentially inducing noncausal associations and further confounding.2,13 Moreover, it was noted that adjusting for uCR as a covariate may not adequately control for the measurement error resulting from inter-individual variations in urinary dilution.2 While more sophisticated MLRM reportedly minimized bias in a range of simulated theoretical scenarios, their broad implementation remains complicated by demographic heterogeneity, potentially necessitating regional adjustments of MLRM, classification issues for patients of minority- or mixed ethnic backgrounds, elaborate pre-analytical questionings and exams, and an incomplete understanding of the number, nature, and complex interrelations of covariates to be included in MLRM.2,13"

Analyte and uCR (likewise SG) usually change their proportionality in response to UFR, and the oversimplified division of analyte by uCR generates creatinine correction errors (CRCE) either with false elevations in diluted urine and declines in concentrated urine, such as in total weight uAs (TWuAs, Fig. 1a/b), or vice versa.3 Despite its mathematically tangible and accountable nature, this systemic methodological error inherent in all common dilution adjustments (uCR > SG > osmolality) is mitigated mainly symptomatically by restricting dilution ranges.3 Limiting valid ranges of uCR to 0.3 (0.4) \u2013 3 g/L uCR, however, does render a good portion of samples (in the present study, a total of 22.3%) formally uninterpretable (Fig. 1b) and will eminently affect lower uCR samples of females (29% rejection rate in this study), smaller infants (30% rejection rate in < 7-year-olds), and highly diluted samples after excessive intake or recent IV administration of fluids.10 Since it does not address the root cause of misperceived linearity, uCR restriction does not provide hydration-independent results within the presumed acceptable range (Figs. 1a/b, 2c). As the remaining hydration bias will exceed the magnitude of most other uncontrolled covariates, it involves a considerable potential for misjudgment of actual exposures, underlining the need for more accurate dilution adjustment. Several investigators have already proposed mathematical modifications of CCRC to account for excretion differences in corrective equations.3,5,18,19,20 A more recent study by Middleton et al. (2019) compared the efficacy of various dilution corrections for spoturinary arsenic. The authors reported significant mitigation of CRCE by mathematically accounting for the analyte-specific discordance between the respective slopes of uCR and the analyte in relation to UFR.3 The major improvements of the simple potency-functional approach over CCRC were demonstrated in terms of both the residual dependence of AsN on uCR (R) and the degree of correlation of AsN with actual drinking water exposure. The authors modified CCRC by a simple power functional uCR correction (S-PFCRC) to standardize results to 1 g/l uCR.3,5 Standardized arsenic (uAsN) was expressed as a function of uncorrected uAs (uAsUC) and uCR corresponding to Eq. 3 of the present study, which is fundamental to the method developed herein (Fig. 1):\nuAsN = uAsUC \u00d7 uCR -z (z is equivalent to b in the present study, see Fig. 1). Theoretically, z is empirically derived by the ratio of the regression slopes of uAs (buAs) against UFR to that of uCR (buCR) against UFR (z\u202f=\u202fbAs /buCR).3 To remove dilution bias from the sample set, the authors adopted a numeric approach to derive the prior unknown exponent z.20 After computing uAsN for a range of z values, z = 0.8 was considered most adequate based on the weakest linear correlation of uAsN and uCR, with the R-value closest to zero understood as an indicator of the lowest residual dilution variation in uAsN.3 The authors resorted to this auxiliary method of z determination due to the absence of comprehensive empirically derived data while acknowledging that forcing a correlation of absolute zero this way may not be completely robust. Another limitation of their study was the modest sample size of 202 spot urine samples, which precluded systematic analyses of demographic influences such as sex or age on correction performance. Nevertheless, their results clearly demonstrated substantial improvements in CCRC results by S-PFCRC, which achieved equivalent minimal residual dilution dependencies for uAsN as for analogously modified dilution adjustments by SG and osmolality. In the present retrospective study, the comparatively large set of n = 5599 samples permitted the development of a more sophisticated progression of S-PFCRC, providing stable dilution adjustment in the upper and lower marginal areas of uAsUC (App. 7b). Furthermore, the effects of age and sex on the corrective functions could be investigated in more detail as will be demonstrated in the second part of this study."

Water contaminated with As can be directly consumed, or it can enter the food chain via plants and animals and thus imperil the safety of our food supply in a multifaceted way.27 For many human populations, seafood has been identified as the primary source of As since its concentration in many fish and shellfish vastly exceeds As levels of most drinking waters and other food sources as they commonly mount into the mg/kg range (Tbl. 1).26,28-30 In marine-derived foods As is primarily present in the form of less harmful, organic As compounds (oAs), with the non-toxic arsenobetaine (AsB, \"fish-arsenic\") reportedly accounting for 75% - 100% of total oAs in seafood and 0.4% - 90% in freshwater fish.28,29,31 AsB is rapidly excreted unmetabolized with a half-life of 18 hours. Compared to most oAs, iAs is highly toxic, and water contaminated with iAs, used for drinking, food preparation, or irrigation of food crops, is thought to pose the greatest threat to the public from environmental As. Another critical source of iAs appears to be rice, which is ten times more absorbent of iAs than any other grain.24,26"

The metabolic path from iAs to DMA occurs via several methylated As intermediates, some of which (MMAIII, DMAIII) exhibit even higher toxicity than iAs (Tbl.1).34,35 Methylation efficacy is decreased with increasing As dose levels and in smokers.26,36 Conversely, methylation capacity increases with age and is higher in females, possibly due to the stimulating effect of estrogen on the production of choline, a substrate for the biosynthesis of SAME in the liver and kidneys.36 The primary route of excretion of the various inorganic and organic As compounds is through the kidneys, with only a tiny fraction excreted into bile and feces.26"

Consequently, they are predominantly stored in the protein fraction of mammalian tissue, where they can impede the function of many enzymes,26,40 and react with cellular thiols, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), thus elevating the intracellular redox potential and promoting oxidative damage.27 The broad clinical toxicological profile of long-term exposure to iAs from drinking water and food includes affections of the liver, gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Typical skin lesions are pigmentation changes, palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, Blackfoot disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, acrocyanosis, or white Mee's lines in fingernails.

Greater differences in renal handling probably exist regarding tubular reabsorption, which in the case of CR occurs at mostly negligible levels and has been described for arsenic as a function of both urinary dilution and of the activity of a common reabsorption mechanism, i.e., via the activity of the NaPT-IIa/c transporters (Tbl.3).37-39 The renal clearance of CR is accomplished primarily by free glomerular filtration and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 by transporter-mediated tubular secretion, which accounts for 10\u2013 40% of total creatinine clearance, depending on kidney function.46,47 Tubular secretion of uCR becomes more relevant in chronic kidney disease (CKD) when creatinine is progressively hypersecreted by remnant renal tubules as GFR deteriorates.48 Apart from CKD, tubular creatinine secretion is upregulated in liver cirrhosis (via OCT2 transporters) and by testosterone.49-51 In contrast to tubular secretion, reabsorption of creatinine is considered rare, even though it has been observed in some cases, such as in newborns and the very elderly.46\nArsenic, like CR, undergoes free glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, with AsB, MMA, and DMA being excreted much faster in urine than inorganic arsenic.26,52-54 The renal-tubular As-transport molecules known to date, including their differential substrates and sex preferences, are summarized in Table 3. At least some evidence exists for tubular reabsorption of arsenate (iAsV) followed by its intracellular conversion to arsenite (iAsIII) and subsequent diffusion of iAsIII across the apical and basolateral membranes of the tubular cell in the canine kidney.55 Consistently, iAsIII was significantly (9.3-fold) higher than less toxic iAsV in human urinary samples.44 The asymmetric tubular reabsorption and net excretion of trivalent and pentavalent arsenic species might be partly explained by variations in acidity and electrical charge (Tbl.1).56 iAsIII and iAsV differ in the oxidative state and molar mass (MM iAsIII 122.9 vs. MM iAsV 138.9), and even more so concerning their acidity. Arsenate (iAsV), featuring an acid dissociation constant of pKa1 2.19, appears substantially more acidic than iAsIII (pKa1 9.23). At physiological urinary pH, iAsV, unlike iAsIII, will primarily be present in its deprotonated, negatively charged, anionic form. Anionic iAsV can cross proximal tubular apical membranes using sodium/phosphate cotransporters (NaPT-IIa/c) while substituting and competitively inhibiting the reabsorption of negatively charged inorganic phosphate.37,38,39 As the low pKa of iAsV seems to favor its tubular reabsorption, the prolonged reabsorption of more alkaline species such as iAsIII, MMA (pKa1 4.1), and DMA (pKa 6.2) might conversely facilitate their faster urinary clearance. In addition to their lower acidity, the attached methyl groups of MMA (MM 161), DMA (MM 170), and AsB (MM 178) may additionally slow the reabsorption of these organic TWuAs species by improving their solubility. An essential factor for tubular reabsorption of at least iAsV appears to be higher urinary flow, which reportedly inhibited arsenate reabsorption in canine kidneys.57 The\nactivation of NaPT-II transporters with consequential higher reabsorption of PO4- and iAsV is well known from studies on extreme dehydration, where massive increases in serum PO4- have been observed.58,59 Increased plasma calcium levels in the dehydrated state will suppress PTH secretion with successive increases in fractional calcium excretion and elevated tubular reabsorption of PO4- and iAsV.60 Consistently, hydration (uCR) also appears to affect the molecular composition of TWuAs. Several studies have consistently shown positive correlations between uCR and urinary %DMA and negative correlations between uCR and %iAs in humans.54,61-65 A longitudinal study in Bangladesh investigated the influence of uCR and other factors such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, betel nut intake, season, and daytime fasting during Ramadan on specified uAs (TWuAs, iAs, DMA, MMA).62 Increased uCR exerted the most substantial effect of all studied factors on uAs parameters: high uCR was positively associated with TWuAs, iAs, MMA, %MMA, DMA, and %DMA, whereas high uCR was inversely associated with %iAs. All these findings are in accordance with disproportionally stronger increases in tubular reabsorption of iAs than of the oAs compounds in states of lower hydration/UFR."

In contrast, arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) quantitatively requires much less SAME.63,65 Considering this highly disproportional consumption of SAME, the required dose of As to implicate a significant reduction in SAME-dependent synthesis of creatine (and subsequently CR and uCR) is expected to be exceptionally high. In animal experiments, SAME was also not found to stimulate the urinary excretion of methylated arsenic metabolites when administered prior to a challenging dose of inorganic arsenic.66 Nonetheless, the positive associations between uCR and %MMA/DMA were hypothesized to be confounded by methylation capacity. In addition to the presence of SAME, methylation depends on the variable efficacy of AS3MT to compete with other SAME-dependent enzymes for this essential cofactor.65 SAME's potential confounding of uAs and uCR led authors to abandon CCRC, use uncorrected uAsUC instead, or include uCR as a covariate in MLRM.14,15 However, full omission of dilution correction appears to imply a stronger urinary dilution bias of uAsUC than the skewed CCRC (Figs. 1, 2). Apart from biochemical confounding, several alternative explanations for the association of uCR and %DMA/MMA were proposed, with the theory of disproportional dependency of iAs- and DMA/MMA net excretions on UFR being the most conclusive.37 Relatively lower renal net excretion of iAs concurrent with rather constant, hydrationproportional excretion of uCR and methylated uAs in states of dehydration could alternatively explain the positive association between uCR and the percentage of methylated uAs."

In addition, AsB showed the highest variability in urinary concentration (ICR 1.7 - 29.0 vs. ICR 2.7 - 7.3 for DMA), indicating that in outliers with high unspecified TWuAs, the main constituent will most likely be AsB from seafood. Most studies either measure TWuAs, which comprises all ICP-MS-detectable forms of As in urine, or so-called 'total uAs', representing the sum of speciated iAs and their methylated metabolites (DMA, MMA) while neglecting AsB and other oAs.24,30,44,63 This sum ('Total uAs') is pragmatically considered a parameter for chronic exposure to drinking water, albeit neglecting the contribution of marine arsenosugars or -lipids to MMA and DMA (Tbl.1), potentially incurring seafood-related misestimates of drinking water exposures.37,44,57,61-63,69 Therefore, the sum of urinary iAs + MMA or even iAs in blood were proposed as more adequate parameters for chronic iAs exposure than 'Total uAs'.29,70 In clinical settings, TWuAs is usually measured as a first-line test, while speciation analysis is reserved for high TWuAs samples. In the present retrospective study, TWuAs was chosen as a paradigmatic marker because of its abundant presence in human urine. It provides a sufficiently high number of samples featuring a broad enough concentration range to establish adequate numerical non-linear adjustment functions.21,26,41,71 The imprecision due to varying As sources and the resulting differences in TWuAs composition and, thus, CRCE is understood to be extensively compensated for by the large sample size."

Given the free glomerular filtration of both uCR and TWuAs, b = 1 would require the ratio of net secretions of both substances to be constant over a wide urinary dilution range, meaning both hydration and renal arsenic load would have to influence the respective tubular secretions of TWuAs and uCR to the same extent. In contrast, when b approximates zero, a parallel to the x-axis results in no correlation between uCR and TWuAs.

The 5400 samples fulfilling all three criteria were stratified into 15 uCR ranges and 6 uAsUC-sextiles (Fig. 2a). Power-functional regression curves were determined for each uAsUC sextile separately (Fig. 2b). The prior partitioning and uAsUC-sextile-stratified PFRA of data (Fig. 2a) proved to be a necessary step, as S-PFCRC preferably corrects uAsUC values closer to the mean (App. 7b). Despite a decent overall computational correction of CRCE by S-PFCRC, there remain\nsubstantial residual dependencies between uCR and uAsN in marginal quartiles 1 and 4, as revealed by PFRA (App. 7b). Alternatively, to the power function used, the relationship between uCR and uAsUC could be described by a logarithmic function of the form uAsUC = a + b \u00d7 ln (uCR). However, the logarithmic regression curves do not intersect the abscissa at the zero-point (as PFRA and CCRC curves do) but in the positive range, leading to nonsensical negative uAsN correction values at very high urine dilutions (here uCR < 0.11 g/L, data not shown). The coefficients a and exponents b of the 6 curves of Figure 2b are related to each other in a positive logarithmic way (Fig. 3), which forms the basis for the variable power function correction derived in Eqs. 1-8. The coefficient a of a regression curve equals its uAsN value, which is assigned to all uAsUC values of that curve along the total range of uCR (Figs. 1c, 2b).\nThe log relation between exponent b and coefficient a with c and d representing analytespecific coefficients (Fig. 3) takes the general form: (4) b(a) = c \u00d7 Ln(a) + d (here b = 0.053 \u00d7 ln(a) + 0.631; c = 0.0534, d = 0.631), Solving (4) for a yields: (5) a(b) = exp (b/c - d/c) (here a = exp (18.73 \u00d7 b - 11.82)) Appendix 8a illustrates the direct proportionality of coefficient a to uAsUC for 8 different uCR concentration ranges. Congruent with both the linearity between uAsN and a and the positive log relationship between a (uAsN) and b (Fig. 3), the dependence of exponent b on uAsUC was also found to be of positive logarithmic nature (App. 8b). With the apparent increase in exponent b as a function of uAsUC, the relationship between uCR and uAsUC will approximate direct proportionality (b = 1) in high uAsUC samples. This is probably due to the progressive saturation of tubular TWuAs reabsorption transport mechanisms with a rising renal TWuAs load.\nIn summary, higher TWuAs loads, represented either by a (Fig. 3, App. 8a) or by uAsUC (App. 8b), appear to increase the fractional excretion of uAs and thus shift exponent b closer to the value of 1, implying more constant uAsUC/uCR-ratios and lower magnitudes of CCRE (Figs. 4a-c)."

Since uCR and uAsUC are confounded primarily by hydration status and possibly by methylation capacity or other potential metabolic factors, they cannot be considered independent\nvariables influencing %CRCE. To better estimate the individual contributions of uCR and uAsUC, multiple linear regression analysis was pragmatically performed with %CRCE as the dependent variable and uCR-adjusted uAsUC percentile rank (Fig. 4c) in addition to log uCR as independent variables (Apps. 6, 10a). Standardized \u03b2 coefficients were determined to be -0.96 for uCR and -0.11 for uAsUC, suggesting that the overall influence of uCR on %CRCE is substantially stronger than that of uAsUC, even though uAsUC, particularly at lower percentile ranks, seems to noticeably influence CRCE (Figs. 4b/c).\n4.

            "text": "Power-functional approaches to dilution adjustment generally partition the graphic relation between the uncorrected analyte (here, uAsUC) and uCR into a fan of curved lines intersecting the zero point, in contrast to the erroneously assumed straight lines in CCRC. All values on a curve are attributed to the same standardized value. The curvature of the lines as a function of uCR and uAsUC is determined by the disproportional dependence of the respective renal net excretion rates on UFR. In simple PFCRC (S-PFCRC), all lines of the function uAsN = uAsUC x uCR -z share the identical exponent z, and the variation in arsenic exposure is expressed exclusively by the differences in the factors a. In contrast, the variable exponent b of the V-PFCRC presented herein increases in positive logarithmic dependence with TWuAs. Successful attempts to compensate CRCE by S-PFCRC have been well documented.3,5,18 In S-PFCRC, the dependence of the correction on UFR is represented by the constant exponent z, which can be either empirically determined by resource-intense measurements of biomarker-specific analyte-UFR slopes or by adopting the reported numerical approach.3,20 However, a constant z, no matter by which method it was determined, will entail the inherent drawback of the observed residual dependencies at both edges of corrected data sets (App. 7b). The herein-developed progression of S-PFCRC to an analyte-stratified variable PFCRC (V-PFCRC) additionally compensates for the independent influence of the analyte level on exponent z, denominated 'b' in V-PFCRC (Fig.3). This proved necessary, as uAsUC, being confounded with uCR by UFR, seems to make a minor independent contribution to %CRCE, especially at lower uCR-adjusted percentile ranks of uAsUC (Fig. 4b/c, App. 6). In contrast to S-PFCRC, V-PFCRC not only attains overall minimization of residual correlations between uAsN and uCR (R2 and exponent b close to zero comparable to S-PFCRC) but also reliably removes residual dependencies in the marginal concentration ranges, as seen in unstratified data sets corrected by S-PFCRC (Fig. 1d, App. 7b). In V-PFCRC, the degree of disproportion in UFR dependence is accounted for by two coefficients (c and d) modifying the standardizing function (Eq. 8) in an analyte-specific manner (Figs. 3, 4). The coefficients c and d can be easily numerically identified by a larger dataset that includes uCR and analyte concentrations while avoiding more elaborate UFR measurements. The accuracy of standardizing functions depends on the representativity and number of samples available for their establishment. The 5400 samples in this study were enough\nto attain a robust log relationship between coefficient a and exponent b. The derived coefficients c and d proved stable, enabling adequate analyte-specific dilution adjustment (Fig. 3). Approximate estimations on fewer samples (\u2265 1000) will most likely already allow for considerable improvement in results, especially for less complex markers. Standardization to 1 g/L uCR by V-PFCRC effectively eliminated CRCE over broad urine dilution, and uAsUC ranges not only in aggregated (Fig. 2d, App. 7a/b) but also in age- and sex-disaggregated analyses, as verified by simple PFRA (see Part II). The quite uniform mitigation of CRCE in all subgroups can be seen as evidence of its principal induction by a common fundamental physiological misconception with only minor quantitative modifications by other biasing factors such as sex, age, or diet, which may nevertheless induce considerable bias by mechanisms other than dilution (Part II). Apart from the asymmetrical net excretions, the generally higher proportions of poorly reabsorbed, methylated As species such as AsB and DMA from predominant marine sources in high TWuAs-samples could further contribute to the effect (Sec. 1.4).28,54,61 Stronger similarity in tubular behavior of methylated As species to uCR should shift TWuAs/uCR relations closer to linearity, thus minimizing CRCE. In the present study, the imprecision due to varying As sources and the resulting differences in the TWuAs composition and, thus, CRCE is understood to be extensively compensated for by the large sample size. Future studies should determine corrective V-PFCRC formulas for all the individual TWuAs components separately to control any TWuAs-concentration-dependent composition bias."

            "text": "Apart from the more complex exemplary parameter TWuAs used herein, the general form of Eq.8, uAsN = uAsUC \u00d7 uCR - [LN (uAsUC) + d/c]/[Ln (uCR) + 1/c], can be applied to all other spot urinary analytes by determining coefficients c and d for any urinary biomarker as the analytespecific basis for adequate dilution adjustment. The inverse correlation of %CRCE and TWuAs (Fig. 4c) suggests that CCRC incurs the strongest misestimates of real exposure in urinary analytes present in only minute amounts. Standardizing these low-concentration analytes to 1 g/L uCR is a prerequisite for their precision. The reliability and validity of dilution adjustments by SG or osmolality, both of which are considered less susceptible to interference than uCR, are compromised in a similar way to CCRC.3 The negligence of the asynchronous hydration-dependent tubular handling of a biomarker on the one hand and of the urinary electrolytes and osmolytes such as urea, uCR, and uric acid that define the SG of urine on the other will induce related correction errors in both methods, albeit quantitatively weaker than in CCRC.3,11,18 Previous promising results for simple power-functional modifications of dilution adjustments by SG and osmolality and the linear relationship between CCRC and SG correction support this assumption.3,5,11,72 It appears consistent that variable powerfunctional corrections analog to V-PFCRC can likewise provide the algebraic basis for adequately compensating dilution adjustment errors by SG and osmolality."

            "text": "S-PFCRC and V-PFCRC account for the physiological hydration-dependent differences in analyte/uCR net excretion ratios. The stable results over a broad urinary dilution (or UFR) range will increase the reliability and comparability of spot urinary biomarkers and permit the omission of symptomatic uCR-range restrictions to 0.3 \u2013 3 g/L as a source of considerable sample rejection rates. Avoiding cumbersome preanalytical questioning and examination, as required for more elaborate MLRM, V-PFCRC, and analog power-\nfunctional modifications of SG and osmolality, are comparably resource- and cost-saving methods. They can be readily implemented in clinical and epidemiological practice by integrating the corrective functions in lab software. Its retrospective application to existing datasets will enable an adequate understanding of previously reported associations between urinary markers and proxies for UFR, such as uCR, osmolality, and SG.54,61,62 That said, it should be noted that standardization primarily mitigates the systemic disproportional dependences of uCR and analyte excretion on UFR. It will thus strongly improve intra- and interindividual comparability and form a more rational basis for establishing normal ranges or toxic thresholds, which may still exhibit age-, sex-, diet-, ethnic-, cross-cultural or other biases due to hydration-independent toxicokinetic factors. These factors may additionally need to be compensated for, be it by differentiating reference ranges or in MLRM using PFCRC values as covariates (see Part II).2,17 A potential for compromise of V-PFCRC lies in the differential tubular reabsorption characteristics of various analyte components in more complex biomarkers. In TWuAs, this might become relevant in major deviations from common TWuAs composition, in rare acute iAs poisoning with tubular reabsorption rates substantially higher, like usually seen in high TWuAs featuring higher proportions of readily excreted oAs. High doses of iAs will thus entail lower exponent b and higher CCREs, being under-compensated by normalization and leading to overestimated As loads in dilute urine and underestimations in concentrated urine (Fig. 1). However, this case appears to be of only minor clinical relevance, since standardized results, due to its lower exponent b, will still be more precise than CCRC and excessively high TWuAs samples will be subjected to speciation anyway. Apart from acute poisoning, major regional differences in alimentation, particularly in seafood consumption or IV-fluid administration shortly before urine sampling, may necessitate adjustments of standardization functions.\n5. Conclusions/Key Messages\n\u25aa Conventional dilution adjustments of spot-urinary biomarkers are flawed with significant hydration-dependent result fluctuations. Previous studies indicated the potential benefits of power functional over conventional linear dilution adjustments.\n\u25aa The results of the CRCE analysis of exemplary TWuAs conducted in this study strongly support V-PFCRC as a promising, numeric power-functional approach to abolish residual hydration bias in spot urinary biomarker results over wide ranges of uCRs and analytes.\n\u25aa V-PFCRC and analog corrections for specific gravity or osmolality allow for more precise dilution adjustment of spot urinary biomarkers than CCRC and S-PFCRC. The method can yield more accurate standardized readings and thus enhance the explanatory power of epidemiological, clinical, and forensic studies.\n6.

PMID: 16529719.\n13. Supplementary Material/Appendices\nAppendix 1: Age structure of study population by sex. Female and male study groups were similar with respect to age structure. n=5599 samples \u2264 500 mcg/L uAsUC (from a total of 5608 samples) were analyzed, and 9 outliers with uAsUC >500 (548 \u2013 5763 mcg/L) were precluded. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant age difference between the female and male groups.\nAppendix 2: Urinary creatinine by sex. Female patients had a significantly lower uCR than men (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test).\nAppendix 3: Uncorrected urinary arsenic (uAsUC) by sex. Female patients had significantly lower uAsUC than men (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U Test).\nAppendix 4: Conventionally CR-corrected urinary arsenic (uAsC) by sex. Female patients had significantly higher corrected uAsC than men (p = 0.014, Mann-Whitney U Test).\nAppendix 5: Distribution of absolute and percentual deviations of uAsN from uAsC. All samples with < 500 \u00b5g uAsUC. a) Absolute differences were calculated for all by |\u2206| =|uAsN - uAsC|. Overlapping histograms are plotted for the full range of uCR (dark green, n = 5599) and after uCR restriction adopting the usual exclusion limits, i.e., all samples within the range from 0.3 - 3 g/L uCR (light green, n = 4781). b) Percent deviations were calculated by |\u2206 %| = |\u2206|x 100/uAsUC. They are either plotted as complete or uCR-restricted datasets analog to histogram a. c) Absolute numbers and percentages of samples with uAsc deviating more than either 20% or 30% from uAsN.\nAppendix 6: Multilinear regression analysis of the contributions of uCR and uAsUC to %CRCE. ANOVA established significance. Standardized regression beta coefficients (\u03b2) were calculated for uAsUC and uCR. Formally, multiple-linear regression is not quite appropriate here because %CRCE, as the dependent variable, is not unrelated to the independent variables uCR and uAsUC. Additionally, all three variables are not normally distributed. Despite these limitations, the beta coefficient, which is significantly higher for uCR in all 3 cases, signals a stronger influence of uCR than uAsUC on %CRCE.\nAppendix 7a: Enlarged illustration of uCR/TWuAs relations in sextiles 1-5 for uAsUC, uAsC, and uAsN. Section of Fig. 2b-d with ordinate truncated to 40.\nAppendix 7b: Comparison of quartiles of uAsUC, uAsC, and uAsN for S-PFCRC (c) and V-PFCRC (d). Preliminary analysis of all n=298 samples from in-house patients with uAsUC < 100 \u00b5g/L. S-PFCRC (c) still exhibits stronger residual dependencies (high R2 and exponent b) in the marginal quartiles 1 and 4, which is resolved by V-PFCRC (d).\nAppendix 8a: The uCR-differential linear relationship between coefficient a and uAsUC. Data were apportioned into 8 uCR ranges and 5 uAsUC quintiles and analyzed by power regression analog to Figs. 2a/b, yielding 5 curves of the form uAsUC = a \u00d7 uCR b. Linear relations between uAsUC (mean of respective quintile) and a of corresponding curves were established by linear regression for all 8 uCR ranges (uCR means in the legend of App. 8b). The gradual decrease of line slopes with urinary concentrations (uCR) signifies uAsN (= a) to take on smaller values than uAsUC in samples with uCR > 1 g/L and higher than uAsUC with uCR < 1 g/L.\nAppendix 8b: The uCR-differential logarithmical relationship between exponent b and uAsUC. The positive logarithmic dependence of exponent b on uAsUC is illustrated by the 5 power equations of App. 8a for all 8 uCRs. Higher renal As loads may raise the fractional excretion rate of uAs, thus converging it with the fractional excretion of uCR, which under ordinary conditions is not reabsorbed at all. The consequences are more negligible CRCEs at higher uAsUC due to the approximation of b to the value of 1. In addition to the uAsUC-dependent increment of exponent b, a negative dependence of the curve slopes on uCR was observed. In all eight uCR ranges, the curves become gradually steeper with urinary dilution, indicating that closer to linear relations between uCR and uAsUC are attained already at lower uAsUC.\nAppendix 9a: Effect of log-transformation on the distribution of uCR data. Histograms and quantilequantile plots of all n=5599 samples with uAsUC \u2264 500 g/L are given in linear (left) and log-transformed (right) form for uCR (a), uAsUC (b), and uAs (c).\nAppendix 9b-d: Effect of log-transformation on the distribution of TWuAs data. Histograms and quantilequantile plots of all n=5599 samples with uAsUC \u2264 500 g/L are given in linear (left) and log-transformed (right) form for uAsUC (b), uAsC (c), and uAsN (d)."
