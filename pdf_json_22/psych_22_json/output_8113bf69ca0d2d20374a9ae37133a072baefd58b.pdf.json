            "text": "Chronic low back pain, as indicated by the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, represents the fourth overall cause of burden in the age range of 25 to 49 years, the seventh in the age range of 10\u201324 years, and the sixth in the age range of 50\u201374 years [1]. Back and neck pain present the world\u2019s largest disease burden related to years lived with disability [2, 3]. The overall point prevalence mean in the general population is estimated at approximately 7% for cervical pain and 14% for low back pain [4, 5], with high recurrence rate in both conditions [1]. The condition is considered \u2018chronic\u2019 when it persists for more than 3 months or when it stays for a longer time than is necessary for the recovery of a tissue lesion [6].\nIdentified risk factors of pain chronicity are age, genetic predisposition, sex, previous experience and attitude toward pain [7, 8]. Nonspecific pain could account for the 90\u201395% of cases with back pain [9], where it has not been possible to clearly identify the structure, the pathology or the real origin of the symptoms.\nChronic pain states are often accompanied by affective, emotional and cognitive disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and cognitive deficits) [10]. The standard definition of chronic pain, defined as pain experienced on most days or every day in the previous 3 months, lacks specificity. There are individuals that evolve favorably after a few months and other that suffer chronic pain for several months, altering their way of life considerably. Furthermore, there are different degrees of severity. There are patients living their lives in a normal way, with limitations, and others who can spend days in bed.\nTo address this problem The US National Pain Strategy proposed the concept of high-\nimpact chronic pain (HICP). The aim of the definition is to better identify people with significant levels of interference with life (i.e. daily activities, work, exercise, etc.) [11]. HICP incorporates both disability and pain duration. Based on the 2011 National Health Interview Survey, the prevalence of HICP can be calculated in US population [12]. IPCA affected 4.8% of the US adult population, or about 10.6 million people, compared to 13.60%, or about 29.9 million people with chronic pain without limitation (CPWL). It was estimated that 7.9 million people, 74% of the CPWL population, had chronic (high intensity) back pain, and 19 million people, 63.5% of the CPWL population, had chronic back pain (without limitations). Approximately 41.5% of the population with chronic back pain have HICP, significantly limiting their quality of life [12].\nIn the United States neck and low back pain are the second-leading condition that\nincreased its spending between 1996 and 2013, with $64.4 billion over 18 years [13]. Therefore, there is a need to find cost-effective treatments for these conditions. Degenerative disc disease is affecting 266 million patients (3.63%) with low back pain every year [14]. It is incidence in Europe has been estimated in 5.7%. The subset of symptomatic disc degeneration has affected\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276734 November 9, 2022 2 / 19"

Outside the submitted work, Dr. Alkhraisat and Dr. Anitua are researchers at BTI Biotechnology Institute.\n403 million new patients every year worldwide. The treatments of symptomatic disc degeneration vary from noninvasive (physical therapy, pain medication) to invasive surgical intervention [15]. Surgical approaches will be associated with risks of the surgery and may derive in repeated surgeries due to the increase in the stress received by the other segments. There is a need for interventions that combine strategies based on decreasing symptoms of stress and depression, increasing coping with pain and increasing physical activity, as all of these variables are predictors of improvement.\nInterestingly, the implementation of cognitive behavior-based program has produced a\nreduction of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in nonsurgical and surgical patients [16]. Furthermore, mindfulness-based therapy has produced a positive effect on pain beliefs and psychological well-being of patients with disk herniation [17]. Preoperative mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) may have benefits in pain control for those patients undergoing spine surgery [18].\nMBSR programs could be a good alliance in the clinical managements of patients with pain-\nful disk degeneration. In 1982, Kabat-Zinn employed an outpatient program based on the practice of mindfulness meditation for chronic pain patients that achieved a significant reduction in pain [19]. This improvement has been related to the detached observation, a basic learning in meditation practices, which would help to uncouple the sensory aspect of pain experience from the affective alarm reaction [19]. More randomized clinical trials have reported a clinical benefit of the MBSR in patients with low back pain [20\u201322]. The MBSR has been shown to be cost saving when compared with usual care alone for chronic lower back pain [23]. That seminal study has significantly expanded the employment of mindfulnessbased stress reduction (MBSR) programs in medicine. Participation in such programs has shown to be effective to improve anxiety, depression and pain [24\u201326]. Burns et al. have shown in patients with chronic pain that MBSR has produced significant differences to the \u201cusual care alone\u201d on average by session 6 [27]. The positive effect of the MBSR program on depression symptoms could be mediated by the reduction in rumination [25]. Also, neurobiological research has shown that mindfulness interventions significantly affect cortisol levels, age-related DNA telomere maintenance activity and neuronal activity [26, 28, 29].\nFurthermore, there are indications that reductions in stress are mediated by lowering the\nlevels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-17) and influencing factors of cell transcription and gene expression [30\u201332].\nTo study the efficacy of the MBSR program on the inflammatory, psychological and bio-\nmechanical domains of patients with low back pain and symptomatic discopathy or disk herniation, randomized controlled clinical trials have been designed and implemented. The null hypothesis has been that MBSR had no significant influence on the inflammatory biomarkers and symptoms in patients with chronic low back pain. This could be related to the absence of effect on patients\u2019 approach toward pain, disability, well-being and overall subjective health."

Pain coping skills training and sequential body movements were included. The sessions included theoretical and practical contents, in addition to detailed explanation of the exercises that patients needed to do at home. As\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276734 November 9, 2022 4 / 19\nhomework, patients were instructed to follow a series of daily 45-min exercises which were specifically tailored for back pain conditions. The MBSR program was the one proposed by the Mindfulness Center of the University of Massachusetts [35], but the following modifications were included to adapt it to patients with chronic back pain. The two sessions related to body postures, originally proposed by Kabat-Zinn [34], were replaced by muscle relaxation and simpler movements supervised by two specialists in physiotherapy. Supplementary file (S1 File) describes in detail the exercises that had been implemented in this study. The purpose of this modification was to avoid unnecessary risks for patients by performing postures that could be a biomechanical challenge, to encourage mobility by starting from postures that would provide greater control and safety and to facilitate the development of mindfulness in the interoception of posture. Another modification in the MBSR program was the inclusion of psychoeducational contents on pain, the role of psychological distress in the development of pain and the use of effective coping strategies, with a focus on tolerance and acceptance. Thus, the adapted program paid more attention to the role of interoception and proprioception in the development of mindfulness. The instructor (GGD) in both sites had 10 years of experience teaching MBSR and was trained at the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Patients were provided with an online platform where they had access to audio records for the daily exercises of MBSR, the workbook and the instructor to solve doubts related to the program. Questionnaires were administered every week to evaluate the adherence and possible adverse effects of the MBSR program.

Demographic and psychological variables were collected by means of an online questionnaire using Qualtrics software. Blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks. The samples were stored in a laboratory with offices in the two sites of the study and were analyzed on the same day to avoid bias. Furthermore, the samples were collected between 9:00\u201310:30 am. Cortisol was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). The cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 y IL-17 were measured by multiplex immunoassay based on highly sensitive Luminex technique. All the biomechanical analysis was performed in an independent and accredited laboratory for clinical analysis.\nDemographic variables included sex, education level and age. The Primary variables were\nstress reduction (measured by the variation of cortisol in the blood) and the variation of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 y IL-17 levels in blood. The sleep and breathing analysis were also included and assessed; however, data are not included in this manuscript. Secondary outcomes were mindfulness, self-compassion, pain acceptance, disability, depression, anxiety, stress, well-being, health-related quality of life and life satisfaction. These variables were assessed by the following validated questionnaires:\nFive Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire\u2014short form (FFMQ). This is a widely used mea-\nsure of mindfulness that includes five factors: describing, acting with awareness, observing, not judging inner experience, and not reacting to inner experience. In addition, the total score is also used. The scale consists of 20 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 [36].\nSelf-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS). This is a measure of compassion for oneself. It\nmeasures the extent to which there is awareness of psychological distress and the degree of kindness towards oneself. It originally includes three components: mindfulness, self-compassion and common humanity [37]. The scale consists of 12 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale that is 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5.\nPain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Instrument designed to assess the coping strategies used\nby chronic pain patients [38]. The inventory includes 3 subscales that assess the following components: Rumination, Magnification and Helplessness. The scale consists of 13 items scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.\nChronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire-Revised (CPAQ-R). It measures the acceptance of\nchronic pain in its psychosocial dimension [39]. Acceptance of pain focuses on the performance of meaningful activities and the achievement of important goals, rather than the use of internal resources to end pain unsuccessfully. It has two subscales: Activity engagement (pursuit of life activities regardless of pain) and Pain willingness (recognition that avoidance and control are often unworkable methods of adapting to chronic pain). Composed of 20 items, 7-point Likert scale.\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scale\u201421 Items (DASS-21). A 21-item scale widely used to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress [40]. The questions are asked with a oneweek range. It uses a 4-point Likert scale with three subscales corresponding to symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.\nSatisfaction with Life questionnaire (SWLS). Life satisfaction is the personal perception of\nwell-being or happiness; in other words, it is the valuation of one\u2019s own life in relation to one\u2019s own goals, expectations or interests directly mediated by the cultural context in which one lives [41]. The scale consists of five items and uses a Likert-type response format. Exploratory factor analysis suggests that the scale is unidimensional.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276734 November 9, 2022 6 / 19\nWHO-5 Well Being Index. The World Health Organization\u2019s WHO-5 index is a 5-item,\n6-point Likert scale questionnaire that measures subjective well-being [42].\nShort Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). It is a generic scale that provides a profile of health\nstatus and is applicable to both patients and the general population [43]. The 36 items of the instrument cover the following scales: Physical Function, Physical Role, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Emotional Role and Mental Health.\nPain and Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI). The 19 items of this test look at different determi-\nnants of sleep quality [44]. Items analyze different determinants of sleep quality, grouped into seven components: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunction.\nAs a deviation from the original protocol, there were questionnaires (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), Survey of Pain Attitudes\u2014Brief (SOPA.B), Pain Coping Inventory (PC), the Chronic Pain Grade Scale (CPGS;90) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)) were not passed to the patients to reduce the overloaded on them. Furthermore, the main coping strategy for chronic pain in MBSR-CBP is acceptance and detached attention to catastrophic thoughts (assessed with the PCS and CPAQ-R questionnaires). Having the vitality subscale provided by SF-36, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) was not passed. To measure stress, DASS was used and the Perceived Stressed Scale (PSS) was omitted."

(48 per group with longitudinal measurements). To guarantee that the MBSR protocol is followed properly, a number of no more than 25 participants per course is advisable, subsequently, the experimental sample will be divided into two weekly groups of 24 subjects.\nFor the duration of the program, participants were asked not to change their clinical habits\nor initiate new pharmacological or clinical treatments. If they did, the participant continued to take part in the program, but he/she was not included in the analysis, to avoid interference with the variables being tested. Python 3.8.5 was used for preprocessing the questionnaire data and merging all the databases generated in the measurement procedure [33]. R version 4.0.1 (R Core Team, 2020) was used for the descriptive and comparative statistical analysis. A mixed 2 (Group) x 3 (Time) repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to analyze changes in means over time. The assumption of normality was checked with Shapiro-Wilk test. The impact of outliers was checked for the analysis of each variable. Homogeneity of variance was checked by Levene\u2019s test and the homogeneity of covariances by Box\u2019s M test. The Greenhouse-Geisser sphericity correction was used for factors that violated the sphericity assumption. The mixed ANOVA was conducted using the rstatix package [46]. For those variables that did not pass the assumptions required for Mixed ANOVA, Robust ANOVA tests were used [47]. Specifically, for the normality analysis a double check was performed; Shapiro-Wilk normality test and visual check with QQ plot. Likewise, for variables that do not meet the assumptions, Dunn\u2019s test for between-group comparisons and Wilcoxon test for within-group comparisons were used. For the analysis of correlations of cortisol with psychological variables, the Pingouin library in python and the skip function were used [48]. This function is a robust method that avoids possible errors produced by outliers [49]. The function yielded Spearman correlation coefficients after removing outliers.

            "text": "The effect of the MBSR program has not been statistically significant on the blood cortisol level. This could be attributed to the fact that all the patients in this study had the blood cortisol within the normal reference values (6\u201323 \u03bcg/dl) [50]. Nevertheless, MBSR has slowed down the increase in blood levels of cortisol (a measure of stress), considering its increase in patients in the control group. MBSR-CBP has significantly reduced blood levels of IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 is a proinflammatory and pronociceptive cytokine [51]. It has been reported to be involved in neurodegeneration, chronic inflammation, and chronic pain [52], but no evidence has been found for its association with chronic back pain [51]. However, the meta-analysis by Ng et al. showed that older people with depression had significantly higher peripheral IL-1\u03b2 levels than people in the control group and along the same lines [53]. Ellul et al. concluded that IL-1\u03b2 is a reliable biomarker for major depressive disorder [54]. The IL-1\u03b2 level changes could be due to the effect of the program on depressive symptoms. Depression has been linked to a high accumulation of IL-1\u03b2 [55\u201357]. In a study with a murine model, peripheral nerve injuries caused in mice increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn contributed to the development of depressive-like behaviors in the mice. Also, stress-induced in mice for two weeks promoted the occurrence of depressive-like behavior after nerve injury by promoting IL-1\u03b2 expression [58]. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) may be screening biomarkers in the prediction of treatment response in patients with depression [56]. In addition, the relationship between back pain and depressive symptoms has also been reported by [59]. Overall, the Intervention seems to have a psychological effect by decreasing the symptoms of psychological distress and this could have been a cause of the decrease in IL-1\u03b2 in the experimental group. Long-term follow-up is needed to find out the relationship between MBSR, cortisol, and inflammatory cytokines.\nDirect measures related to mindfulness have significantly improved in patients in the exper-\nimental group thus suggesting that mindfulness training has had the expected effect. Patients reported an increase in mindfulness (FFMQ) and self-compassion (SF-SCS).\nAccording to the review by Haldeman et al. (2012), there is no clear understanding of the origin of chronic back pain in 98% of patients [60]. Moreover, current prevention and treatment methods are open to improvement [61\u201363]. There is evidence that factors such as highstress levels, depressed mood, and anxiety are strong predictors of back pain [62, 64, 65]. The recommendations for the treatment of non-specific chronic back pain are based on a biopsychosocial approach promoting the patients\u2019 ability to resume their activities, social interactions, and physical exercise, and it is useful to include psychological treatment for people with persistent symptoms [62, 66]. Research suggests that the highest ratios of reported perceived pain are related to emotional stress [66]. Even the use of opiates (remifentanil) can be blocked by negative patient expectations and be 200% more effective if the patient\u2019s expectations are positive [67]. The effects of a positive expectation were associated with activity in the endogenous pain modulation system and the negative effects of expectation with activity in the hippocampus, results that make us consider that part of the solution to the great problem we are\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276734 November 9, 2022 12 / 19\ndealing with is the inclusion of a multidisciplinary approach to the patient with chronic back pain. Increased pain management strategies, increasing acceptance of pain, may be the cause of a greater disposition to be involved in daily activities and the encouragement of physical exercise. The results suggest that the intervention could help patients to improve their pain acceptance (CPAQ). The patients in the study had no experience with mindfulness-based practices, a condition we used to evaluate the potential application of mindfulness-based programs to real clinical settings, where very few people would likely have practiced mindfulness. The design was also intended to avoid possible contaminating effects on motivation and adherence. The results show that the program could be used to promote activity (SF-36 physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health), or to increase social interactions (SF36 social functioning). According to the review by Maher et al. [68], physical exercise, has high evidence as a treatment within non-pharmacological therapies. It is common to advise the patient to practice physical exercise or lead an active life. However, catastrophizing, rumination, or symptomatology of stress, depression, or anxiety could be factors that curb healthy behaviors and thus prolong the patient\u2019s symptomatology. It is necessary to design techniques to increase pain tolerance and psychological distress. MBSR-CBP could be a possible option not only because of its effect, but also because of its potential for adaptability, as it can be applied in large groups, or even in an online format [69]. In this regard, Herman et al. have found that MBSR has been cost saving when compared with usual care alone for chronic lower back pain [23]. The MBSR-CBP of the current study has included psychoeducational contents on pain, the role of psychological distress in the development of pain and the use of effective coping strategies, with a focus on tolerance and acceptance. Ashar et al. have shown that pain reprocessing therapy has been effective in producing substantial and durable pain relief [70]. The focus of this therapy has been the reconceptualization of pain as related to nondangerous brain activity rather than injury in the peripheral tissue. Possible mechanisms could be related on one hand to less response to low back pain in the anterior midcingulate, the anterior prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula for PRT vs usual care [70]. In the other hand, it could be related to increase resting connectivity between the primary somatosensory cortex, and the anterior prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula. Furthermore, an increase in the connectivity between the precuneus and the anterior midcingulate [70].\nTaking RCTs from the report on noninvasive treatments for chronic pain by Skelly et al.\n[71], there are two previous papers like the present study using MBSR for the treatment of chronic back pain. Morone et al. demonstrated that MBSR, in conjunction with an active healthy aging program, was effective in reducing self-reported pain disability at post-treatment [20]. These pain-related benefits were not maintained at the 6-month follow-up evaluation. However, Cherkin et al. demonstrated that MBSR reduced functional limitations due to pain among participants with chronic back pain at 4- and 13-month follow-up compared to the standard treatment [22]. Clinically significant improvement in pain management was achieved in 61% of patients compared to 44% of the usual treatment for back pain. In both protocols, no substantial changes were specified concerning the original MBSR. The present study has a smaller sample size, but we have included a measure of cortisol, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-\u03b1 exploring a possible biological mechanism that could explain the decrease in depressive symptomatology by decreasing IL-1\u03b2. It has been observed that an improvement in sleep quality that is part of an overall improvement in mental health (decreased stress and depression) and an increase in well-being and life satisfaction. Like the studies by Cherkin et al. and Morone et al. [20, 22], we have observed statistically significant changes in disability and perceived pain scales. Morone et al. have shown that MBSR has produced a significant improvement in the CPAQ, Activities Engagement subscale and SF-36 Physical Function with 3 months of follow-up [21]. Cherkin et al. have shown that MBSR has achieved a clinically significant\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276734 November 9, 2022 13 / 19\nimprovement in the RDQ (60.5% for the MBSR group vs. 44.1% for the usual care group) and in pain bothersomeness (43.6% for the MBSR group vs. 26.6% in the usual care group) [22]. The effects of the MBSR have been durable with little changes over 13 months. However, Morone et al. have found that the effects of mind-body program for chronic low back pain have improved short-term function and long-term current and most severe pain [20]. But the functional improvement has not been durable (follow-up time has been 6 months). Worth to mention, the study by Morone et al. has recruited older patients (\ufffd 65 years).\nThe study did not include post-treatment measures, which is a limitation of the present\nstudy. Although patients and clinician were not blinded to the assigned group. The statistical analysis was performed blindly. Although the measurement of the allostatic load has not been included, the study has assessed the negative affective states in patients with low back pain and degenerative disk disease. Data on the usual therapy has not been collected and differences between patients/centre could not be excluded. However, all participants have been asked not to change their clinical habits or initiate new pharmacological or clinical treatments. Since there has been no active control group, benefits cannot be attributed specifically to mindfulness practice. Benefits may be compounded by factors like group support, teacher support, expectations and attention received. In addition, a mindfulness-based program is composed of many elements, apart from the practice itself, like pain pedagogy, lifestyle pedagogy and its impact on health, and body and stretching practices. Specific designs are needed to dismantle the contributing factors. The sample size is not large enough to generalize the results, yet the statistics are sufficiently robust to show an appreciable trend of improvement in the experimental group. Experimental designs with a larger sample size are needed to generalize the results."
