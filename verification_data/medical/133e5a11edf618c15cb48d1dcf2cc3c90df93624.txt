"Nevertheless, the recognition of possible risk compensation is necessary to implement appropriate interventions for reducing the occurrence of risk compensation after HPV vaccination." 

"First, our study is a cross-sectional survey, which limited causal inference. Cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings in the future." 

"Second, MSM do not receive HPV vaccination. We investigated the risk compensation intention in a hypothetical situation of having received HPV vaccination. Although behavioral intention is deemed to be a major factor affecting actual behavior, some differences occur between actual behavior and intention." 

"Third, due to the obscuring nature of the MSM, a non-probabilistic sampling method was used in this study. The results may be biased, which may limit the generalization of our findings to other MSM populations."
