This interest was accentuated by reflections on global citizenships and migratory processes that, together with deep economic, social, and legal inequalities, constantly challenge the nineteenthcentury ideal of homogeneous identity construction (Westheimer, 2015). Despite the equality values, recognition, and respect for differences roundly consolidated after the atrocities committed in the first half of the twentieth century (El Navas, 1997), current societies are plagued by inequalities, exclusion, and discrimination, whether in terms of\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 03 November 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.997423"

Issues about structural injustices and their approaches in nowadays globalized societies have been debated, but not comprehensively from the perspective of power differences as applied to social psychological perspectives on justice (Liu and Pratto, 2018; Plenty, 2018).\nLiberal perspectives focused social justice analysis on inequalities resulting from material and cultural goods distribution or other types of resources (Rawls, 2001). Thus, they proposed that equity in social conditions makes a fair distribution of social goods and resources possible. In addition, according to Nussbaum (Nussbaum, 2012), a fundamental requirement to achieve Social Justice is respect for human dignity, which implies the obligation that citizenship be\u00a0 situated above a broad (and specific) minimum threshold in at least 10 central capacities. Different authors noted that because of the profound cultural differences in contemporary societies, such equity would be\u00a0 impossible without recognizing the particularities of the diverse social groups (e.g., Young, 1990; Taylor, 1993; Fraser, 1995). Besides these lines, for such recognition to be\u00a0assertive -avoiding perpetuating inequality-, the groups involved must participate in decision-making on issues affecting disparate aspects of their lives (Miller, 1999; Young, 2004; Fraser, 2008).\nThree-dimensional model of social justice: Redistribution, recognition and representation\nBased on different authors (Murillo et\u00a0al., 2014; Hern\u00e1ndezCastilla and Hidalgo Farran, 2015), in order to assess social justice it is essential to base on a multidimensional concept (focused on at least three types of injustices: economic, cultural and political) considering the great diversity of existing injustices. Within this context, (Fraser, 2008) proposed social justice should be\u00a0analyzed by involving to three constitutively related dimensions: redistribution of resources (not only economic but also educational, social, health, etc.), recognition of diversity (whether of identities, genders, cultures, etc.) and representation (participation in decision-making that affects people\u2019s lives, both in the redistribution of resources and multiple identities recognition). It is possible to identify injustices affecting these three dimensions in any society (Murillo and Hern\u00e1ndez-Castilla, 2011). In the present study, these considerations were addressed in order to design a Social Justice scale that was as wide as possible and adapted to current injustices and problems. Firstly, according to Fraser (Fraser, 2008) based on a classic perspective of the concept, there is Redistribution or Economic Justice (Rawls, 2001; Sen, 2009), which suggests the need for a just distribution of goods and material resources, as well as distribution at the cultural level. Secondly, the dimension of Recognition or Cultural Justice (Fraser and Honneth, 2006) highlights the need for sociocultural respect towards all people, as well as to value human diversity and promote fair relationships. This perspective encourages an absence\nof social and cultural domination, giving visibility and recognition to minorities that have been historically excluded for different reasons. Thirdly, the notion of Representation or Political Justice (Young, 1990) attempts to give people the option to participate in society in an active and equal way. Therefore, the present study is aimed to validate an instrument based on a philosophical conception of social justice closer to the social sciences, in order to empirically contrast said paradigm.\nFor example, in Spanish society, economic and resource inequality between social groups is profound. This situation of social unfairness is evident when considering that Spain exhibits one of the lowest equality indicators in the European Union, along with Bulgaria, Greece, and Lithuania (European Union: European Commission, Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Progress Report on the Implementation of the Hotspot Approach in Greece, 2016). While in most of the countries that make up the European Union the top\u00a020% of people with the highest salaries earn five times the 20% who earn the least, in Spain this ratio is six and a half times above average. Additionally, in terms of recognition, women continue to suffer discrimination both at work and personally, as reported in the public sphere (Cepeda Gonz\u00e1lez, 2017). Likewise, the situation of minority groups in Spanish society, like those with other cultural identities resulting from the incorporation of migrants, or the scarce tradition of respect for their linguistic diversity within the State, is also worrying. Other recent studies show significant levels of prejudice (both subtle and blatant) towards minority groups such as, for example, the Roma people (e.g., Cuadrado et\u00a0 al., 2016; Etchezahar et\u00a0 al., 2016). Moreover, as mentioned earlier and following (Fraser and Honneth, 2006; Fraser, 2008), resource distribution and recognition are expressed in the possibility of social groups\u2019 involvement, beyond political representation. In the Spanish context, the situation concerning this dimension is also worrying. Several studies indicate that young people reject and take distance from partisan politics, preferring new forms of community-based citizen participation, whether in NGOs or different local initiatives (Par\u00e9s, and y Subirats, J., 2016). In this regard, we\u00a0must underline democratic systems depend on a politically active citizenry (Bierle and Cayford, 2002; Fischer, 2018). Therefore, the common framework of justice around citizenship can be\u00a0seen as a psychosocial process that seeks to ensure social reconciliation in societies which have been fragmented and seek to improve democracy (Basabe and P\u00e1ez, 2021).\nDespite the social relevance of social justice-related issues and its broad intellectual tradition, few precedent studies have adopted a psychological perspective. The analysis of justice-related judgments boasts a vast tradition, from the pioneering work of (Piaget, 1976/1932), through the contributions of (Kohlberg, 1971), to contemporary constructivist proposals (Barreiro et\u00a0al., 2019; Elenbaas et\u00a0 al., 2020). Such works were not devoted to analyzing the representations that comprise how people think about social justice, considering the three dimensions proposed by Fraser. However, numerous instruments have been designed to\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nassess variables that guide or maintain certain injustices, through the attribution of responsibility and/or the justification of social domination. In relation to social justice, several of these instruments evaluate aspects proposed by (5), but they do so in isolation and focusing on the situation of injustice or the assessment of its consequences. In order to evaluate the representations of social justice, which can respond as predictive or consistent variables with those already studied, it is necessary to develop a new instrument that fully responds to social demands. In this way, it is intended not only to evaluate the construct of social justice in a multidimensional way, but also to know the scope of each factor that composes it. Therefore, to date, we\u00a0lack valid and reliable instruments specifically designed to assess how people represent social justice and how these representations relate to psychosocial variables widely studied as responsible for maintaining social inequalities, such as belief in a just world and social dominance orientation (Etchezahar and Brussino, 2015; Barreiro et\u00a0al., 2019).\nThe evaluation of social justice and other psychosocial variables involved\nThe assessment of Social Justice representations has a first scale based approached in the study conducted by (Enterline et\u00a0al., 2008), who built a 12-item scale called \u201cLearning to Teach Beliefs about Social Justice\u201d (LTSJ-B). This technique consists of a survey containing indicators on the perception, expectations, and beliefs of U.S. teachers about retributive justice in the teaching process (Enterline et\u00a0al., 2008). Some years after the development of this assessment, (Ginns et\u00a0al., 2015) tested it in Australia, obtaining adequate psychometric results. While considered groundbreaking in the analysis of social justice, this study focuses only on one aspect of the construct: the distribution of human and economic resources.\nOn the other hand, following theory of planned behavior, (Torres-Harding et\u00a0al., 2012) develops a social justice evaluation and used it with practitioners, students, professors, and different community members. The authors consider social justice as a set of values or beliefs referring to equitable access to social resources and protection of human resources, which need to be\u00a0evaluated in four dimensions: attitudes towards social justice, perception of behavioral control, subjective norm, and behavioral intentions. From their perspective, society should work towards the empowerment of disadvantaged people. Their analysis attempts to take a further step in understanding how certain attitudes towards social justice are closely related to direct action. Like the (Enterline et\u00a0al., 2008) assessment, the (Torres-Harding et\u00a0al., 2012) study focuses on one aspect of social justice: equity in terms of goods and resources distribution.\nIn contrast (Murillo et\u00a0al., 2014), empirically analyzed the different dimensions of social justice according to (Fraser, 2008): redistribution, recognition, and representation. The authors developed a 16-item scale, elaborated from three dimensions:\nsocial justice in society, education with social justice, and commitment to social justice. They obtained adequate reliability and validity indicators in a sample of Spanish students and teachers. As indicated by the authors, this scale enables exploring personal and social factors affecting social justice, such as education, values, and personal experiences in the three dimensions of the construct. However, it does not discriminate the elements of representation, recognition, and redistribution.\nAlong these lines (Murillo and Hern\u00e1ndez-Castilla, 2011), developed a Social Justice Questionnaire comprising a set of moral dilemmas to assess the three dimensions of social justice in teachers and students of primary and secondary education. The questionnaire consists of a set of dilemmas with different response options, created according to their proximity-distance to the social justice dimensions proposed by (Fraser, 2008) (redistribution, recognition, and representation). Participants must choose which option they consider represents their way of thinking. This technique is the first to advance in analyzing the three social justice dimensions in a specific way. Moreover, based on the study of the dilemmas included, different works strengthened this line of research, showing valid evidence (Jacott and Maldonado, 2012). Because how were they built, many of these dilemmas share different dimensions of social justice, hence, it is difficult to analyze individually in each participant the dimension levels of representation, redistribution, and recognition. According to the authors (Jacott et\u00a0al., 2014), constructing dilemmas representing each dimension secludedly is complex. For example, if we\u00a0analyze: \u201ca school has a playground where a girl with a wheelchair cannot play, what should the school do?\u201d with the response options: (1) The school must adapt the playground so the girl with a wheelchair can play like the rest, (2) The school must adapt part of the playground to give the girl a place to play or (3) The school needs to evaluate whether the costs involved in adapting the playground are a priority. On the one hand, the redistribution of the school\u2019s resources is at stake; however, diversity is also explicitly recognized in terms of the possibilities of the different actors involved.\nThere is an extensive tradition dedicated to study psychosocial variables that favor the maintenance of social inequality. These types of variables have shown to be\u00a0related to the measures that directly or indirectly justify the injustices of the system in which they occur (Vargas-Salfate et\u00a0al., 2018). These include studies on the belief in a just world (Lerner, 1980; Lerner and Clayton, 2011). This belief responds to the need to live in a stable and predictable environment, that makes future planning possible, and protects against injustice. Thus, the belief in a just world is at the basis of meritocratic social systems and favors the maintenance of social order (Jost and Hunyady, 2005) by denying social injustices (Kay and Jost, 2003; Wolfradt and Dalbert, 2003; Sutton and Douglas, 2005). Therefore, this belief would be\u00a0 the outcome of an ideological appropriation process (Barreiro and Castorina, 2015). Another psychosocial variable explored to explain the maintenance of inequalities is social dominance orientation (Pratto et\u00a0al., 1994). The theory of social dominance proposes a psychological mechanism based on the tendency to establish and\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nmaintain social hierarchies, conceiving certain groups as superior and others as inferior (Sidanius and Pratto, 1999; Sidanius et\u00a0al., 2000). From this perspective, subordinated people should have at their disposal representations of social justice to empower them to meet their needs and to equalize their power with that of other groups (Liu and Khan, 2021). It is worth noting that, according to (Lambert et\u00a0al., 1998), the social dominance and the belief in a just world make up a belief system with negative consequences for society that underestimates and blames the victims of injustice. We\u00a0hypothesize that social dominance and the belief in a just world are the ideological backgrounds of social justice.\nIn the first place, this paper proposes the development of a social justice representation assessment aimed at discriminating its three dimensions (Representation, Recognition, and Redistribution) and studying whether the differences depend on the gender of the participants. Secondly, we\u00a0analyze if the belief in a just world and social dominance are predictive of the social justice dimensions."

We\u00a0discarded 12 items for kurtosis excess according to the parameters proposed by Botella et\u00a0al. (Botella et\u00a0al., 1993), where is stated that values between \u22121,4 and 1,4 are adequate. Although all items respond directly to one of the dimensions of the construct, some of them obtained biased responses. For instance, when asked indirectly about the dimension Redistribution with items such as \u201cThe State should not give financial aid to anyone,\u201d the vast majority of participants showed a broad disagreement. For Recognition dimension, items such as \u201cImmigrants should adapt to the country they arrive in if they want to be\u00a0accepted\u201d were dismissed. Also, for Representation dimension \u201cThe citizens\u2019 vote is often overestimated\u201d or \u201cSometimes it is better for a few people with extensive political knowledge to have the right to vote, rather than for anyone to be\u00a0able to do so.\u201d The Table\u00a01 shows the final 18 item\u2019s, the internal consistency of each factor evaluated through Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient, and the mean, standard deviation, itemtotal correlation, and alpha if the item is removed from the scale. In addition, the factor loadings for each item (KMO = 0.877; Bartletts test: p < 0.001) were informed.\nAll items present adequate psychometric indicators. The Representation dimension can improve its reliability by removing item 9, however it refers to an important aspect of the construct: interest to take part in political decisions, so the item has been kept. Subsequently, we\u00a0performed a structural equation analysis to compare a unidimensional theoretical model with a model of three correlated dimensions. All indicators show a better data adjustment to the three correlated dimensions model, therefore, the unidimensional model should be\u00a0discarded to analyze the representations of social justice with the tested items (Table\u00a02).\nRegarding the differences according to gender, we\u00a0 observed statistically significant differences in two of the three dimensions of social justice. In Recognition, women (M = 23.29; SD = 4.10) obtained higher scores (t = \u22122.91; p < 0.001; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.26) with respect to men (M = 22.13; SD = 4.78), as did Representation, where women (M = 25.06; SD = 3.35) had higher levels (t = \u22123.82; p < 0.001; Cohen\u2019s d = 0.34) than men (M = 23.79; SD = 4.12). There were no statistically significant differences in Redistribution. Regarding the factorial invariance of the questionnaire according to gender (Men: \u03c72 = 442.88, df = 135; CFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.04 [0.038\u20130.051]; Women: \u03c72 = 293.44, df = 135; CFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.05 [0.041\u20130.059]), the results on S-B Scaled Difference \u03c72 = 14.36, df = 15; (p = 0.50) allow us to assume both form invariance and invariance of equal factor loadings considering gender.\nSocial dominance, belief in a just world and the social justice dimensions\nHaving arrived at a preliminary valid and reliable scale for assessing social justice, we\u00a0proceeded to analyze the relationships between the three dimensions of the construct with two psychosocial variables: Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and the Belief in a Just World (BJW) (Table\u00a03).\nThe psychosocial variables that more strongly correlates with social justice dimensions are Social Dominance with Recognition (r = \u22120.426; p < 0.001), and Participation (r = \u22120.322; p < 0.001), and the Belief in a Just World with Redistribution (r = \u22120.330; p < 0.001).\nFinally, observing the significant and highly correlated relationships between Social Dominance and Belief in a Just World with the three dimensions of Social Justice, we\u00a0tested a path analysis to account for influential relationships between the proposed theoretical variables (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThe metric indicators show an adequate data adjustment to the proposed theoretical model (S-B X2 = 24,47; df = 5; \u0394S-B\nTABLE\u00a02 Confirmatory factor analysis of the social justice scale (SJS).\nS-B X2(gl) \u0394S-B X2(gl) CFI IFI RMSEA\nSJS (one dimension) 357.26 (135) 2.64 0.81 0.82 0.063 (0.055\u20130.070) SJS (three dimension) 238.69 (132) 1.80 0.92 0.93 0.044 (0.035\u20130.053)\nAdequate values: \u0394S-B \u03c72(gl) \u2264 3; NNFI, CFI, IFI \u2265 0.90; RMSEA \u2264 0.05.\nTABLE\u00a03 Relations between the social justice scale dimensions and psychosocial variables.\n1 2 3 4 5\n1.

            "text": "The main purpose of this work was to analyze preliminary the psychometric properties of the Social Justice Scale, whose dimensions represent the three dimensions of the construct proposed by (Fraser, 2008). We\u00a0 found reliability and validity indicators suitable for its use across our online sample, providing a first approach to the subject, making further exploration of the phenomenon possible.\nOne of the main discussions regarding the evaluation of the construct was whether Social Justice dimensions could be\u00a0considered independently or as a single factor consisting of different dimensions. In this sense, our findings indicated that, while significantly correlated, they are independent and the items cannot be\u00a0analyzed in a single dimension of the construct. The factorial invariance of the questionnaire according to gender has shown results which allow us to assume both an invariance of form and an invariance of equal factor loadings for men and women. However, it is suggested to continue studying the structure of the construct in other larger studies, based on this validated version of the scale. The use of a threedimensional model of social justice (Fraser, 2008) in social contexts may be\u00a0a key instrument to understand more deeply the origin of certain existing injustices with diverse causes. This can help different socio-educational professionals to find specific ways to reduce the levels of injustice related to each dimension with a higher prevalence.\nWe also inquired about the differences in each dimension of social justice by gender of the participants. Women in this study obtained higher scores in the Recognition and Representation dimensions, while Redistribution remained constant. These results are consistent with previous studies (Murillo et\u00a0al., 2014), showing the greater sensitivity or critical awareness of women related to attitudes towards global social justice. However, when analyzing social justice through its three dimensions, the differences have not always been significant for redistribution and representation. In this sense, recognition affects aspects that are directly related to respect, tolerance and empathy towards diversity, compared to redistribution and participation (economic and political justice) which are dimensions in which leadership has traditionally been exercised by men. This aspect may be\u00a0due to the fact that, although in recent decades the recognition and participation of women in the political sphere have increased, there are still significant levels of inequality with respect to men. In addition, recent studies indicate women have a greater tendency to be\u00a0prosocial than men in their social justice representation (Jacott et\u00a0al., 2014; Albal\u00e1 Genol and Guerra, 2020). In any case, it is recommended to replicate this preliminary study in samples with a greater gender diversity.\nThe relationships between the three dimensions of social justice with psychosocial variables traditionally operating as the\nideological background that contributes to the perpetuation of social inequalities, such as social dominance orientation and belief in a just world, were also examined. The correlational results have shown that, in coherence with previous research (Sutton and Douglas, 2005), BJW and SDO might be\u00a0operating as psychosocial variables with a certain predictability towards the justification of social inequality, and therefore showing negative relationships with the three dimensions of social justice. In particular, Redistribution is the one that has the most negative link with BJW, which shows that this variable has a clear link with the hypothesis of a just world (Lerner, 1980): each person always gets what they deserve and therefore the distribution of resources is not necessary. Regarding to Social Dominance, Recognition and Representation are the dimensions that show the most predominant negative relationships, which might be\u00a0related to a more hierarchical orientation on who should participate socially, excluding minority groups. We\u00a0 found statistically significant relationships between the variables in each case and went a step further by proposing a theoretical model where both belief in a just world and social dominance act as predictor variables of the three dimensions of social justice. We\u00a0consider that belief in a just world and social dominance provide a strong ideological background for the three dimensions of social justice.\nWhile meeting the aims proposed in this study, the work has several limitations that should be\u00a0addressed in future research. First, although the study had acceptable results, it is a preliminary study for validation of the Social Justice Scale; therefore, it is necessary to continue replicating its assessment in larger and more heterogeneous samples, and to control the balance in key variables such as SES, gender and age. For example, it was not possible to perform an invariance test according to SES because only one of the four categories (middle class) reached the adequate number of cases to perform this type of analysis (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007) (n > 200). Future studies should analyze different evaluations of SES. Secondly, we\u00a0 developed an assessment of the three dimensions of social justice based on Fraser\u2019s (Fraser, 2008) ideas; however, the author\u2019s theoretical proposal is much broader than the scale items developed in this study can address. The predictor variables of social justice should also be\u00a0 considered, given we\u00a0could observe that belief in a just world and orientation to social dominance are directly involved in the assessment of each dimension of the social justice construct. Other variables such as openness to experience, need for cognitive closure, authoritarianism, ideological positioning, among others, may also contribute to the values of social justice. Besides, for future studies of the Social Justice Scale, it is suggested include the cultural factor considering the possibility of including native speakers and second language speakers, because no case has been considered so far. Also, we\u00a0need to continue evaluating psychological variables that may be\u00a0directly influenced by the construct, such as different expressions of prejudice, democratic regime support, local economic perception, as well as different citizen action forms. Also, future investigations should delve in the study of the concurrent and discriminant validity of the scale. A challenge for\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nfuture researches, is to determine the origin of the correlation between low social justice representations (redistribution, recognition and representation) and other social attitudes, prejudice and behaviors that may result. The evidenced model is based on a dynamic perspective of social justice concept, never definitive or complete and is always open to reflection and improvement (Miller, 1999). In addition, the findings should be\u00a0implications for future studies related to social justice, since a unidimensional analysis may lead to errors in its evaluation and in its possible relationship with other psychosocial variables.\nAs proposed by (Westheimer, 2015), it is essential to pursue the discussion on the importance of developing a citizenshiporiented social justice that considers citizens to be\u00a0fundamental active change agents in reproducing the inequities and injustices of the world we\u00a0live in. A possible perspective for future studies could be\u00a0to consider the incorporation of relevant dimensions for younger citizenship and not directly addressed by redistribution, recognition and representation, for example: environmentalism, feminism and digital citizenship."
