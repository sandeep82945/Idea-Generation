    "abstractText": "Black holes were found to possess properties that mirror ordinary thermodynamical systems in the landmark paper by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking almost half a century ago. Since then much progress has been made, but many fundamental issues remain. For example, what are the underlying degrees of freedom of a black hole horizon that give rise to said thermodynamical properties? Furthermore, classical black holes also harbor a spacetime singularity. Although it is often believed that quantum gravity would \u201ccure\u201d the singularity, as emphasized by Penrose, this viewpoint requires a deeper examination. In this review, I will examine the possibility that singularities remain in quantum gravity, the roles they may play, and the possible links between singularity and black hole thermodynamics. I will also discuss how \u2013 inspired by Penrose\u2019s Weyl curvature hypothesis \u2013 gravitational entropy for a black hole can be defined using curvature invariants, and the surprising implication that the entropy of black holes in different theories of gravity are different manifestations of spacetime curvature, i.e., their underlying microstructures could be different. Finally, I review the \u201cHookean law\u201d recently established for singly rotating Myers-Perry black holes (including 4-dimensional Kerr black holes) that connect black hole fragmentation \u2013 a consequence of the second law of black hole thermodynamics \u2013 with the maximum \u201cHookean force\u201d, as well as with the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner. This also suggests a new way to study black hole microstructures, and hints at the possibility that some black holes are beyond the Hookean regime (and thus have different microstructures). While examining the remarkable connections between black hole thermodynamics, spacetime singularities and cosmic censorship, as well as gravitational entropy, I shall point out some subtleties, provide some new thoughts, and raise some hard but fundamental questions, including whether black hole thermodynamics is really just \u201cordinary thermodynamics\u201d or something quite different.",

Since then much progress has been made, but many fundamental issues remain. For example, what are the underlying degrees of freedom of a black hole horizon that give rise to said thermodynamical properties? Furthermore, classical black holes also harbor a spacetime singularity. Although it is often believed that quantum gravity would \u201ccure\u201d the singularity, as emphasized by Penrose, this viewpoint requires a deeper examination. In this review, I will examine the possibility that singularities remain in quantum gravity, the roles they may play, and the possible links between singularity and black hole thermodynamics. I will also discuss how \u2013 inspired by Penrose\u2019s Weyl curvature hypothesis \u2013 gravitational entropy for a black hole can be defined using curvature invariants, and the surprising implication that the entropy of black holes in different theories of gravity are different manifestations of spacetime curvature, i.e., their underlying microstructures could be different. Finally, I review the \u201cHookean law\u201d recently established for singly rotating Myers-Perry black holes (including 4-dimensional Kerr black holes) that connect black hole fragmentation \u2013 a consequence of the second law of black hole thermodynamics \u2013 with the maximum \u201cHookean force\u201d, as well as with the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner. This also suggests a new way to study black hole microstructures, and hints at the possibility that some black holes are beyond the Hookean regime (and thus have different microstructures). While examining the remarkable connections between black hole thermodynamics, spacetime singularities and cosmic censorship, as well as gravitational entropy, I shall point out some subtleties, provide some new thoughts, and raise some hard but fundamental questions, including whether black hole thermodynamics is really just \u201cordinary thermodynamics\u201d or something quite different."

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION: BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS, SINGULARITIES, AND\nQUANTUM GRAVITY\nIn Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity (GR), a spacetime region can be sufficiently curved that nothing, not even light, can escape. Such regions, known as black holes, continue to fascinate both the general public and professional physicists. Black holes are certainly not an \u201cobject\u201d in the physical sense. Instead the boundary of a black hole, its horizon, is only a non-tangible mathematical surface. Yet astrophysical observations have provided strong evidence that black holes do exist in our actual universe. From a theoretical physicist\u2019s point of view, there are at least two remarkable properties about black holes: (1) they behave like a thermodynamical system, namely they have entropy and temperature, despite being made of empty spacetime; (2) they harbor a singularity deep within.\nNow, property (1) is surprising because prior to the discovery of Hawking radiation [1] no one expected a black hole to be able to radiate, and thus the correspondence with thermodynamics was initially taken as a mere analogy by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking. In fact, back\nlElectronic address: ycong@yzu.edu.cn\nthen they referred to the laws of black hole mechanics instead of thermodynamics [2]. Now we know that black holes have a well-defined Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [3] and Hawking temperature. For an asymptotically flat Schwarzschild black hole of mass M in 4-dimensions, the entropy S and the temperature T are given by\nS = kBc\n3\n~G A 4 , and T =\n~c3\n8\u03c0GkBM , (1)\nwhere kB , c, G, ~ denote the Boltzmann constant, the speed of light in vacuum, Newton\u2019s gravitational constant and the reduced Planck constant, respectively (hereinafter, they will be set to unity). Note that the entropy is proportional to the horizon area A, which is a very peculiar behavior compared to ordinary thermodynamical systems that we are more familiar with, such as that of a box of gas, whose entropy is proportional to the volume of the box. There had been investigations that tried to understand how such an area scaling of entropy could develop as a star approaches the black hole formation limit [4, 5]. However, this is not yet well-understood.\nCrucially, Hawking proved that in classical GR, the area of the horizon cannot decrease, which indeed is what we expect once we have identified the horizon to be the measure of the entropy via Eq.(1). This is now referred to as Hawking\u2019s area theorem [6]. Once quantum effects are included, black holes can shrink in size due to Hawking radiation, but the generalized second law [7] (GSL) re-\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n16 85\n6v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n3 0\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2 mains valid: that is, the entropy in the radiation together with the black hole entropy at a later time is always larger than the black hole entropy at the initial time before the radiation is emitted. Note the misnomer: there is really nothing \u201cgeneralized\u201d about the GSL, it is just the usual second law applied to the whole system; it is only generalized with respect to the original second law of black hole (only) thermodynamics.\nHow the community came to gradually accept black holes as a bona fide thermodynamical system has been explained in details by Wallace [8, 9] (see also [10]). Here it suffices to emphasize that nowadays most theoretical physicists take black hole thermodynamics for granted, and a huge edifice of research is based on it. For example, the fact that Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is proportional to its surface area led to the \u201cholographic principle\u201d [11] that the entropy contained inside an apparent horizon (even in cosmological settings) is bounded by the area of the horizon. This idea culminated in the \u201cgauge/gravity duality\u201d or \u201cAdS/CFT correspondence\u201d [12] 1 , which gave rise to an independent field of research altogether.\nNevertheless, there are fundamental issues regarding black hole thermodynamics that require further examinations. One longstanding mystery is the underlying degrees of freedom or microstructures that give rise to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. What exactly does the entropy measure? Even after close to 50 years, we do not know why a static neutral Schwarzschild black hole \u2013 the simplest of them all \u2013 has the most amount of entropy; why does spinning up a black hole decrease its entropy? In fact, an avid reader has perhaps noticed that I chose to phrase property (1) as black holes behaving like a thermodynamical system, instead of the more straightforward \u201cblack holes are thermodynamical systems\u201d. This is because there are some indications that black hole thermodynamics is not ordinary thermodynamics despite the superficial resemblances. I will come back to this point in the final section.\nProperty (2) is the consequence of Penrose\u2019s singularity theorem [13, 14], which earned him a Nobel Prize in 2020. Although mathematically speaking the theorem only proves geodesic incompleteness, physically black hole singularities are also where spacetime curvature becomes unbounded. The divergence renders GR useless in describing the physics at singularities. One should of course be\n1In gauge/gravity duality, the physics of a system in the presence of gravity inside an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime (\u201cthe bulk\u201d) is equivalent to the physics of another non-gravitational field theory with one less spatial dimension at the conformal boundary. However, in most interesting applications, the field theory is not completely conformal. For example, when the field theory has a temperature dual to the Hawking radiation in the bulk, the temperature gives a length scale to the boundary. Hence the term \u201cgauge/gravity duality\u201d is more accurate than \u201cAnti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence\u201d. I have not much to say about this important aspect of theoretical physics, though there will be occasional related remarks.\nvery suspicious when calculations yield infinity. Thus it is suspected that the diverging curvature is a signal that GR is no longer applicable near the singularity. From the point of view of treating GR as an effective field theory [15, 16], this makes sense \u2013 a sufficiently high curvature corresponds to high energy scale beyond some ultraviolet cutoff that GR can no longer be trusted (even making this statement precise is nontrivial because the relationship between \u201chigh curvature\u201d and \u201chigh energy\u201d is not so straightforward. Among other reasons, one crucial difficulty is the notion of \u201cgravitational energy\u201d, itself not well understood; see the recent article [17]). Therefore, it is usually suspected that once quantum theory is taken into account properly, the singularity would be \u201ccured\u201d, i.e., rendered non-singular. In other words, the classical singularity is often viewed as something that is unwanted and which is not to be taken as \u201creal\u201d, merely a signal that GR is no longer the valid theory. However, in view of the fact that we do not really have a fully working theory of quantum gravity (QG), we should keep our options open and consider seriously the possibility that some kind of singularities might persist down to the QG regime. It might be replaced by something else, a \u201cquantum singularity\u201d that is perhaps less pathological than its classical counterpart, yet nevertheless might not be completely cured. (It could also be possible that whether a singularity is resolved in QG depends on its \u201cstrength\u201d [18].) In the subsequent discussions, we shall see why it might be important to keep some singularities around. In fact, they could be a feature, rather than a bug, of general relativity.\nWe also recall that the mainstream view of the end state of Hawking evaporation is that eventually the black hole completely disappears, and one is left with an empty spacetime2, though if one considers the quantum vacuum before black hole formation and after the evaporation they might be different, as proposed by the soft hair picture [19, 20]. This, at least to me, seems to suggest that it is implicitly assumed that either the singularity was never really there (not even a quantum version), or that the quantum singularity evolves such that at the end it dissolves completely, and so we do not have a naked quantum singularity3. If the second possibility holds, then it is plausible that quantum singularity is somehow tied to the horizon (which also needs to be replaced by a\n2An alternative view that some sort of remnant persists is not entirely ruled out [21], though they are widely argued to be problematic. Indeed, the recently popular weak gravity conjecture [22, 23] was partly formulated to prevent such a state from ever arising.\n3Here we recall Penrose\u2019s statement to the contrary [24]: \u201cIt is hard to avoid the conclusion that the endpoint of the Hawking evaporation of a black hole would be a naked singularity \u2013 or at least something that one [sic] a classical scale would closely resemble a naked singularity.\u201d In fact, Russo has argued that a complete evaporation would lead to a catastrophic event at the end of the evaporation [25] \u2013 an outbrust of Planckian curvature wave similar to a \u201cthunderbolt\u201d singularity [24, 26, 27].\n3 quantum notion thereof) so that the singularity is guaranteed to dissolve when the horizon does, i.e. some version of quantum cosmic censorship continues to hold4. The mainstream viewpoint regarding Hawking evaporation is therefore quite consistent with the idea that cosmic censorship remains relevant in QG. In the next section I will continue to discuss the possibility that the singularity is somehow related to the horizon. Granted that this is not a mainstream view, and I myself am not entirely convinced of it anyway, I think it is important to explore such a possibility.\nThe structure of this review \u2013 which is not meant to be comprehensive \u2013 is as follows: in the next section I will discuss the roles singularities might play, and why they might continue to exist in some ways in QG. In Sec. (III) I will discuss the idea of gravitational entropy, and a proposal of gravitational entropy based on my recent work with Gregoris [31], which was motivated by Penrose\u2019s Weyl curvature hypothesis (in the cosmological context of the \u201carrow of time\u201d). This approach suggests that different constructions of curvature invariants might account for black hole entropy in different theories of gravity, which in turn might imply that non-GR black holes have different microstructures. While the main objective is to shed some light on the nature of BekensteinHawking entropy, the bigger theme that underlies this investigation concerns the hope that one might gain a better understanding of gravitational entropy in more general contexts (such as gravitational waves), and the role singularities and cosmic censorship might play in this. In Sec. (IV), I will review the recently established \u201cHookean law\u201d, based on a collaboration with Di Gennaro and Good [32], that can be viewed as a new aspect of black hole thermodynamics. In short, a Hookean law \u201cF = kx\u201d analogous to a spring is defined for black holes, whose maximum value corresponds to black hole fragmentation (a black hole splitting into two as the latter configuration has a higher entropy). Surprisingly this can be related to the thermodynamic geometry of Ruppeiner, as well as to the \u201cmaximum force conjecture\u201d in GR [33\u201336]. We also suggested in [32] that there might be non-GR black holes that go beyond the Hookean regime, and thus possess different microstructures, as also conjectured in Sec. (III). Finally I conclude with some prospects and suggestions for future investigations in Sec. (IV).\n4In fact, cosmic censorship is not a strictly classical phenomenon, for under some situations one needs quantum effects to maintain the censorship [28, 29] that would have otherwise failed. See also [30]."

            "text": "Not all singularities are the same \u2013 some are worse than others. The problematic ones are timelike singularities, which are singularities in space, such as the ones inside the rotating Kerr black hole, or the charged ReissnerNordsrto\u0308m black hole. They would be visible to anyone that enters the black hole, and worse still, if the horizon is somehow destroyed, be visible to the rest of the universe. This is problematic because we lack a theory that can properly describe the physics of singularity, and if a singularity can be observed, it can also affect physics far away. General relativity would then lose its predictive power, since given an initial condition we can no longer evolve a system in time without also knowing what sort of boundary condition we should prescribe to the singularity (i.e., Cauchy problem is no longer well-posed). This is the reason behind Penrose\u2019s proposal of cosmic censorship conjecture [14]. The conjecture comes in two forms: the weak form essentially forbids naked singularity so that the rest of the universe outside black holes is predictive, whereas the strong form requires this to be true also for the interior observers, namely we should not expect a stable timelike singularity to be physical. In this work, by cosmic censorship I mean the weak version. The strong version will be explicitly referred to as such.\nA spacelike singularity, which is \u201clocated in time\u201d, like the one inside a Schwarzschild black hole, is harmless because being \u201cthe end of time\u201d it cannot affect anything. Incidentally, the big bang singularity which is \u201cthe beginning of time\u201d is also harmless because even though we still cannot fathom the physics right after the Big Bang, the subsequent evolution of the universe is relatively wellunderstood and we can just take an initial slice at some later time and evolve that forward. Lastly, a null singularity, which can occur on the horizon of some black holes, can be problematic if it has a diverging curvature, since then its neighborhood can have unbounded curvature that can affect the exterior universe. I have recently reviewed various aspects of weak cosmic censorship [37], which I shall refer the readers to for more details.\nIn this section I wish to focus on one issue: why is cosmic censorship relevant at all? Especially if we think that there is no such thing as an actual singularity (if it is cured by QG \u2013 not surprisingly there are different attitudes among physicists towards singularities in relation to QG [38]), then why should we even be bothered by cosmic censorship? Well, because Nature seems to care. The fact is that we have not seen any naked singularity (or whatever replacing it in QG). On the contrary, astronomical observations reveal numerous black holes that are rotating very close to the extremal limit [39], which is as fast as cosmic censorship would allow. In addition, theoretical attempts to destroy black hole horizons reveal how difficult such tasks can be. In other words, the laws of physics seem to abhor naked singularities. That is to\n4 say, it does seem that cosmic censorship is generically true (quantifying the meaning of \u201cgeneric\u201d is of course not easy). It seems strange that Nature would try so hard to uphold cosmic censorship if there is nothing worrying inside black holes5. This is of course not even close to a serious argument. Indeed, this suggestive opinion has at least one loop hole: there are regular black holes beyond GR that do not have a singularity by construction, yet they typically have an extremal configuration. Though we do not call it by the name cosmic censorship, it is rather the same phenomenon: there are values of the parameters that the configuration ceases to have a horizon. I will come back to discuss regular black holes later.\nFor now, let us take a step back and recall the usual assumptions of the singularity theorem, and ask if we still expect singularities at the quantum level. The original singularity of Penrose, and many versions thereafter, assume some kind of energy conditions [40]. Even the weakest classical energy condition, the null energy condition (NEC), is known to be violated once quantum effects are considered. It is possible to prove singularity theorems assuming only the averaged energy conditions [41\u201344], integrated over some regions instead of being valid pointwise, which are believed to hold at the semi-classical level. (Even taking into account Hawking evaporation, which of course violates NEC, a singularity theorem can still be proved [45].) But what happens in the QG regime? One naturally suspects that even the averaged energy conditions may cease to hold. One is faced with the hard problem of deciding which principles should we still hold on to entering the realm of QG. Should we keep some kind of energy condition? Should we even keep Lorentz invariance6, for example? Or some properties from quantum information theory, perhaps? With the lack of experimental guidance, it is often down to personal bias as to what should be regarded as fundamental.\nOne possibility is to hold on to some notion of thermodynamics (or inspired from it), in particular the second law. As Eddington has famously declared [50], \u201cThe law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme\n5We can further compare this with the ultraviolet catastrophe (Rayleigh\u2013Jeans catastrophe) in classical thermodynamics. In that case, a divergence was predicted by the classical theory, which of course did not match observations. Once quantum mechanics is taken into account, the infinity is \u201ccured\u201d and one obtains the Planck spectrum. Thus quantum mechanics is required to explain the observed spectrum. In our context, however, the classical theory of GR already predicts the correct observation: namely there is a censorship bound, without which one runs into the problem with naked singularity. If QG cures away the singularity, it also removes the need for cosmic censorship. So quantum modifications in this case, seemingly introduced a new question instead of solving an existing one.\n6Interestingly, and somewhat surprisingly, there may be nontrivial connections between Lorentz symmetry and the second law of thermodynamics [46\u201348], and local Lorentz symmetry may be an emergent property of the macroscopic world with origins in a microscopic second law of causal horizon thermodynamics [49].\nposition among the laws of Nature. [...] if your theory is found to be against the Second Law of Thermodynamics I can give you no hope.\u201d The second law reflects some sort of order \u2013 it is the statement that universe has an arrow of time [51]. Is the second law, or at least the notion of entropy, \u201csacred\u201d enough to survive in QG? One might argue that microscopic physics experiences no arrow of time because the laws of physics is fundamentally time symmetric. Indeed, the entropy of the configuration of a gas in a box tends to increase over time (molecules released from a bottle of perfume at a corner of the box quickly spread uniformly throughout). If we take a video recording of the process and play it backward it would be obvious that the footage is played backward. However, if we zoom in to record the individual motion of gas molecules and their collisions, the footage would appear essentially the same whether we play it forward or backward in time. For this reason we might be tempted to suspect that at the QG level the arrow of time \u2013 which is in this sense emergent and not fundamental \u2013 is not important. However, the Big Bang was in the QG regime, and the universe did evolve forward in time, giving rise to the macroscopic arrow of time. Therefore it is not so clear that QG does not distinguish between some kind of low entropic state from some other high entropic state (this is also related to the difference between an initial singularity and a final singularity, which I will discuss below). Let us therefore, at least entertain the possibility that the notion of entropy, and some kind of second law, remains valid in QG. Indeed, assuming that the GSL holds and with some machinery from quantum information theory, Wall [52] was able to prove a version of the singularity theorem. Thus, as per our discussion above, it could be possible that a similar result may hold in QG.\nWhile there is no concrete evidence that supports the notion of singularity in full QG, there is at least one evidence that cosmic censorship remains relevant at least in the low energy limit of string theory (not just semiclassical GR). The case in point is the evaporation of the charged dilaton black hole (the \u201cGHS\u201d solution [53\u201355]). As Hiscock and Weems have shown [56], the Hawking evaporation of charged black holes is highly nontrivial, but the bottom line is this: for a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole, if the initial charge-to-mass ratio is sufficiently large, then the black hole simply steadily discharges towards the Schwarzschild limit. However, if it started with a low charge-to-mass ratio, it will radiate predominantly neutral particles and so the charge-to-mass ratio first increases, though eventually it will start to decrease. The extremal configuration is therefore not only unachievable (which is to be expected from the third law of black hole thermodynamics since it has zero Hawking temperature), but that any black hole that comes close to the extremal state will be \u201crepelled\u201d away. Note that this is also the expectation from the weak gravity conjecture. Now, we can naively apply the Hiscock-Weems method to study the evolution of the evaporating GHS black hole, which can be understood as a string theoretic version of charged black\n5 holes, at least in the low energy limit. In this case we found that the black hole continues to approach the extremal limit without turning around. This violates the spirit of cosmic censorship because the extremal GHS black hole is a null singularity, with a nonzero Hawking temperature and a diverging curvature. Therefore, even if the extremal state is not exactly attained, the theory becomes nonpredictive when the black hole gets arbitrarily close to being extremal (and so has arbitrarily large curvature). The point is that it does not take an exact singular state with infinite curvature to be problematic, an arbitrarily large one is equally bad. We can turn the situation around and ask, if we impose cosmic censorship, i.e., if we require that the evolution of the charge-to-mass ratio to eventually turn around, how do we go about implementing it? The Hiscock-Weems model involves the charge loss rate due to particle production via the Schwinger effect7, which should receive correction in the presence of the dilaton. In fact, by assuming a rather simple minimal ansatz for the correction, such that the charge-to-mass ratio turns around, Yao and I found that we could re-derive the correct charge particle production rate in the dilatonMaxwell theory [59], which was previously obtained in the literature via a direct QFT computation [60]. Explicitly, the ansatz we assumed for the exponential term in the Schwinger process takes the form:\nexp ( \u2212\nr2+ Q0Q + C Q Q0\n) = exp (\u221a 2M(C \u2212 2)\nQ0\n) (2)\n\u00d7 [ 1\u2212 2 + C\nQ0 \u03b5+O(\u03b52)\n] ,\nwhere Q0 := e/(\u03c0m 2), and \u03b5 is the deviation away from\nthe extremal charge configuration Q = \u221a\n2M \u2212\u03b5, while C is the correction term due to the presence of the dilaton. That is to say, C = 0 corresponds to the usual exponential term in the Schwinger effect in standard quantum electrodynamics. The additional dimensionless term CQ/Q0 essentially renders the Schwinger effect less suppressed. How much of enhancement in the production rate do we need to discharge the black hole away from extremality? It turned out that for any fixed value of 0 < C < 2, we can always choose M sufficiently large so that there are initial datum that would lead to extremality under Hawking evaporation and Schwinger pair production. Therefore, if we want to impose cosmic censorship as per the discussion above, the minimal choice is C = 2, which is indeed the correct value obtained via QFT. This example shows that cosmic censorship can be used as a guiding principle to deduce other physics. Furthermore, this example provides an indirect, but strong, evidence that cosmic censorship\n7Note that the Schwinger effect is necessarily suppressed for all values of black hole parameters [57], but it is crucial that the term be included, otherwise all Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black holes will tend to extremality, and potentially violates cosmic censorship [58].\nremains relevant at least in the low energy limit of quantum gravity. (Di Gennaro and I also conjectured in [61] that as any black hole undergoes Hawking evaporation, its parameters should evolve in such a way that it avoids becoming extremal, not just avoid becoming a truly naked singularity. This could be used as a guide to rule out non-standard models of Hawking evaporation.) In addition to the Maxwell-dilaton case, recently some authors have investigated black hole evaporation in the presence of higher order curvature terms (with or without a dilaton), such as the Gauss-Bonnet term. It was found that cosmic censorship can be violated due to the formation of either a naked singularity or a high-curvature elliptic region [62\u201365].\nHaving discussed the various hints that singularities might remain in QG, let us now turn to discuss what roles they may play. That is, there might be good reasons why Nature wants to keep singularities around. First of all, recall that the Schwarzschild metric admits a negative mass solution. While mathematically valid, it is unphysical, otherwise we would not have a stable ground state in GR. The positive energy theorem guarantees stability in this sense. The negative mass Schwarzschild solution is however, not a black hole, because it has no horizon. Instead it is a naked singularity, which would be obvious if we draw its Penrose diagram. The interior solution of a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m or a Kerr black hole inside the inner horizon (ignoring the stability issue for now) is actually similar, which also can be seen from their Penrose diagrams. With respect to an interior observer, the timelike singularities within these black holes are naked (the strong cosmic censorship conjecture wants to rule out such a scenario). Indeed, we see the \u201cnegative mass\u201d phenomenon here as well: gravity becomes repulsive near these singularities [37], and freely falling observers along geodesics (of a neutral particle in the charged case), cannot hit the singularities. Instead they are repulsed away into another universe, if we take the maximally extended solutions at face value (which we should not, because of the instability of the inner horizon). Therefore, one can say that even though a naked singularity has a negative mass and is thus not allowed, it is nevertheless acceptable to have such a singularity hidden behind the horizon (if we only accept the weak cosmic censorship instead of the strong version8) \u2013 the mass as measured from outside is positive. It has therefore been suggested that singularities play the role of ensuring stability even in QG. Namely, if QG corrections render a classical singularity regular, there would no longer be any need for cosmic censorship, and in principle, the \u201cregularized singularity\u201d can there-\n8It is worth emphasizing again at this point that singularities are problematic only when they cause the theory to lose predictability. If the instability of the inner horizon turns into a spacelike singularity, there is actually no problem with predictability, and as such, is a good thing. Many physicists, however, are uncomfortable with singularities, even if they are spacelike.\n6 fore be naked. But then there is no clear reason why the energy of these regularized singularity should be bounded from below; they can be very negative. In other words, cosmic censorship could therefore play the role of ruling out unphysical solutions that would otherwise render the theory unstable [66].\nFrom the above discussion, we already observed a curious relationship between the singularity and the horizon, they seem to conspire to give a positive mass. In fact, there seems to be more to this story. In an asymptotically flat spacetime we could compute what is the mass of the black hole in the usual way. This is the Arnowitt-DeserMisner (ADM) mass \u2013 which is essentially the mass we would physically assign to the black hole. On the other hand, there is another mass, or rather \u201cinternal energy\u201d E, that is physical in the sense that it is the energy that appears in the first law of black hole thermodynamics: dE = T dS. There is no obvious reason why we should have E = M . However, this is a robust feature in GR. For example, in anti-de Sitter spacetime, the rotating Kerr-AdS black hole has a mass that is analogous to the ADM mass (the Abbott-Deser mass) [67, 68], which is exactly the same mass that is required for the first law to hold [69]. However, this nice property that the gravitational mass is the same as the thermodynamic mass need not hold for regular black holes [70, 71], in which by construction there is no singularity within. While the gravitational mass is positive, it is not the same as the thermodynamic mass in the first law (alternatively we could give up the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for these black holes [70]). Thus, we see that the singularity is inherently related to black hole thermodynamics \u2013 which are usually thought to be the properties due solely to the horizon.\nLet us make a few remarks on regular black holes [72]. These are ad hoc geometries in which the singularity is somehow regularized by some exotic matter field or by some quantum effects. Regular black holes can have multiple horizons, which means that they can become extremal much like a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole. A Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole can lose its horizon and expose the singularity if the charge becomes too large. The cosmic censorship conjecture says that this should not happen. The censorship bound is therefore a mathematical condition that requires the existence of a horizon. Such kind of bound also exists for regular black holes with multiple horizons, despite they harbor no singularity! In general, therefore, one should not equate the censorship bound with the horizon existence condition, as there is nothing to be censored in a regular black hole. However, the fact that these black holes have an inner horizon, the same sort of arguments leading to mass inflation inside a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole also suggests that we should not trust the validity of their interior solution. But it is precisely the interior solution that is of interest in this context. If, under mass inflation, the inner horizon turns into a singularity, then this would defeat the entire purpose of constructing a regular black hole solution in\nthe first place (see, however, [73]). This conundrum has been discussed in details by Carballo-Rubio et al. [74, 75], the bottom line is that it is far from clear whether multihorizon regular black holes are self-consistent. (If there is only one horizon, there is also no \u201chorizon existence condition\u201d \u2013 the solution always exists.) There are some solutions that are claimed to be stable [76, 77], but to prove this at the mathematically rigorous level would require more work. Their thermodynamics should also be further examined.\nThis is a good place to mention some rigorous results regarding the inner horizon. The naive Penrose diagram of Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m and Kerr black holes found in the standard GR textbooks are now known to be incorrect. The Cauchy horizon is itself essentially singular (\u201cweak null singularity\u201d [78, 79]). Its instability does eventually lead to the formation of a singularity, co-existing with a portion of a Cauchy horizon [79\u201383]. This singularity is most likely spacelike. Whether this happens for the regular black holes requires a proof at the same level of rigor. Of course, at some point, quantum corrections will change the classical picture. However, even at the quantum level, it is likely that Cauchy horizon would be inherently singular in some ways [84]. In a recent work [85], Bousso and Shahbazi-Moghaddam even argued that \u201cquantum singularities blurs the line between an ordinary singularities and a Cauchy horizon.\u201d Remarkably, whether spacetime continues to exist beyond a Cauchy horizon may be probed by the thermal one-point function of a massive field outside the black hole [86, 87]."

            "text": "I have briefly mentioned the arrow of time problem in the previous section. As Penrose pointed out [88], the Big Bang is special because entropy was very small back then, compared to what it could have been. More specifically Penrose computed the full phase space volume, and the volume that corresponds to the actual initial conditions of our observable universe. The ratio is about 1010 123\n[89], dubbed the \u201cPenrose number\u201d9 in [91] by McInnes, who also pointed out that the number of internally consistent\n9The estimate made by Penrose is essentially based on the number of microstates corresponding to the maximum possible entropy, which is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole with the total mass of the observable universe. Surprisingly, this number is also close to the one obtained by assuming we are living inside a de Sitter spacetime (now that we know that the universe undergoes an accelerated expansion), in which the de Sitter horizon entropy is S \u223c 1/\u039b \u223c 10122 in the Planck units. The current actual entropy inside the observable universe is about 10104, which also includes contributions from supermassive black holes [90]. This is an example of the \u201cholographic principle\u201d in action, that the entropy of the cosmic horizon bounds the interior entropy.\n7 universes in the string landscape \u2013 usually cited as 10500 for definiteness \u2013 is utterly negligible by comparison. In other words, it appears that it is extremely improbable that our universe started in the way it did. Explaining this is the arrow of time problem, which involves some very tricky issues (including the infamous \u201cmeasure problem\u201d [92] of how to make sense of probability when you have an eternal inflation), and deserves another review by itself, therefore it is not our aim to discuss it in depths here. For our purpose, we shall focus on only one aspect: namely gravitational field has entropy, which we still do not know how to properly quantify. This is important for the arrow of time problem, as one should track all sorts of entropy \u2013 not just the matter degrees of freedom \u2013 to say whether entropy is high or low.\nFrom the uniform and Planck spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we see that the matter sector did attain thermal equilibrium in early times. Yet we know that the overall entropy of the universe keeps on increasing (thus giving rise to the arrow of time). Therefore, Penrose realized that the initial entropy must be low in the sense that gravitational entropy was low. Although we do not know much about gravitational entropy, it makes sense to suspect that it should be somehow related to the Weyl curvature. This is because in GR, it is not the full Riemann curvature tensor that appears in the Einstein field equations. Only the trace part of the Riemann tensor \u2013 the Ricci tensor (and its contraction, the Ricci scalar) is related to the matter-energy stress tensor. The traceless part of the Riemann tensor is exactly the Weyl tensor, whose components are denoted by Cabcd. In other words, the Weyl curvature is the only part of the curvature that exists in free space in the absence of matter, and thus has to do with gravitational degrees of freedom only. Penrose therefore proposed the Weyl curvature hypothesis [93], which states that the initial Big Bang entropy must correspond to a very small Weyl curvature (which measures \u201ctidal deformation\u201d in GR), whereas the Weyl curvature is expected to be large at a putative Big Crunch, or at the black hole singularities. The different characters of the initial and final singularities may indicate that their resolutions (if any) in QG may need to be different. Quite independently of the arrow of time problem, it is an interesting question by itself to properly understand gravitational entropy. Mostly we are only confident of one special case: the BekensteinHawking entropy of a black hole. Before coming back to the question of what black hole entropy really measures, let us comment on the bigger picture.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, Hawking\u2019s area theorem [6] proved that classically10 the area (and hence\n10A strengthened version of the theorem can be proved even when the NEC is somewhat violated [94]. At present it is not clear whether the relaxed energy conditions that guarantee the validity of a semi-classical version of the area theorem would also be the same conditions that forbid Hawking radiation and vice versa.\nthe entropy) of a black hole horizon cannot decrease. Recently, the area law has even been \u201ctested\u201d using the first ever observed gravitational wave data (of course, as a mathematical result, the area theorem needs no \u201ctest\u201d \u2013 the real purpose of such test is to see if the assumptions of the theorem hold in the actual universe) [95].\nIn view of the current huge interests in gravitational wave physics, it is intriguing to note that Hawking\u2019s original motivation was to study how much energy can be emitted by gravitational waves during black hole mergers. The area theorem implies that the area of the post-merger black hole must be at least as large as the sum of the areas of the initially separate black holes. This in turn gives an upper bound on how much of black hole mass can be converted into gravitational waves11. It would be very interesting to further understand this process from the point of thermodynamics. Recall that a black hole that undergoes Hawking evaporation still satisfies the GSL since the entropy in the Hawking particles compensates the reduction in the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. So why is it that gravitational waves cannot compensate for a putative decrease in the post-merger area? The area theorem amounts to an indirect argument that such a process is not possible. It must be that gravitational waves cannot carry so much entropy. To understand why not we must be able to quantify gravitational entropy in general, not just that of black holes, but also (at least) for gravitational waves [97]. Such a proposal has been made by Clifton, Ellis, and Tavakol, utilizing the Bel-Robinson tensor, which is constructed from the Weyl tensor and its dual, and has a natural interpretation as the effective \u201csuper-energymomentum tensor\u201d of free gravitational fields [98], yet much is still to be understood12.\nWe may even consider the extreme case to try to see why such a process is impossible: consider two black holes collide and completely \u201cannihilate\u201d into gravitational waves. It turns out there is a good reason to prohibit this \u2013 the end result would not just be an empty space plus gravitational waves. Rather, it would likely create a naked singularity and thus violates cosmic censorship. For the same reason an asymptotically flat and 4-dimensional black hole cannot split into two. This is Theorem 12.2.1 in Wald\u2019s GR textbook [101]. We note that, as pointed out in [102], the premise of the theorem is to assume that spacetime is \u201cpredictable\u201d, i.e., no unknown information coming in from a putative naked singularity. Thus the contrapositive statement would be that if black holes do\n11A lower bound on the entropy of a black hole can be deduced from a bound on the minimal (Tolman) redshift factor of gravitational waves emerging from the vicinity of its horizon [96].\n12The Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol gravitational entropy was also shown to be increasing during structure formation in Szekeres Class I models [99]. Interestingly, in the presence of shear, the Clifton-EllisTavakol gravitational entropy can increase even though the Weyl curvature decreases. Thus, the Weyl curvature hypothesis is not strictly valid in all cosmological spacetimes [100].\n8 bifurcate, the spacetime would contain a naked singularity (or perhaps other anomalies). The theorem however assumes an arrow of time [102] \u2013 otherwise the same theorem would \u201cprove\u201d that black holes cannot merge or cannot form from the collisions of gravitational waves. In other words, if we know which direction is the future (i.e. the direction entropy increases), and if cosmic censorship holds, then it follows that black holes cannot bifurcate or otherwise reduce their total areas13. So again the arrow of time creeps into the problem; to understand the thermodynamical aspect of gravitational wave we need to have a good understanding of gravitational entropy, not just for black holes but for gravitational waves, and possibly also for singularities (see the final section for more comments on this).\nEven in the case of black hole entropy \u2013 the best understood of all instances of gravitational entropy, it is still unclear what is the underlying microstructures or microstates that this entropy supposdly measures. This question can be asked on different levels. It would certainly be best to understand this at the full QG level. One approach from string theory (Strominger-Vafa [105]) was able to derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by counting the microstates made of a stack of branes that collapse to form an extremal black hole when some coupling parameter is tuned. It is, however, unclear if this can be done for generic black holes. Incidentally, one interesting aspect is that the end result of the \u201ccollapse\u201d still has the same entropy as the initial configurations. In other words, the initial states that form the black hole saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This is non-generic: a typical collapse of a stars to form a black hole, for example, involves a huge increase of entropy by a factor of 1020(M/M )\n1/2, where M denotes a solar mass [106, 107]. While specific examples can be constructed at the classical level whose initial conditions do saturate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound, such configurations are highly nontrivial and finely tuned [108]. This calls for a better understanding of two challenges: (1) Why does gravitational collapse generically involve such a huge increase in entropy? (2) Notwithstanding the Strominger-Vafa approach (and others) at the QG level, can we understand, from the point of view of Weyl curvature, how to interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy?\nOne naive but straightforward proposal to address (2) was proposed in [109]. The idea is simply to treat the contraction CabcdC\nabcd as the entropy density and integrate over the appropriate spacetime region to obtain the\n13It is debatable whether this is really a problem. For example, when singularity does form when a black string or black ring undergoes \u201cpinch-off\u201d under Gregory-Laflamme instability [103], the loss of classical predictability of the system is argued to be quite small. This is also the case for the naked singularity formation under black hole collision in higher dimensions. To quote [104], \u201ceven if cosmic censorship is violated, its spirit remains unchallenged.\u201d Is a little violation acceptable?\nentropy of the gravitational field as\nSgrav := \u222b CabcdC abcd dV4 , (3)\nwhere dV4 = \u221a h d4x is the hypersurface volume element, which after integrating from r = 0 to the horizon, reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy up to a constant prefactor. Due to dimensionality reason, this only makes sense in 5-dimensions, unless we modify the proposal in an ad hoc way by raising the integrand to the appropriate dimension-dependent power. Another problem with this proposal is the need to set a cutoff in the lower limit of the integral to avoid a divergence at the singularity r = 0.\nIn [31], Gregoris and I proposed a different construction. First, we note that for Petrov type D spacetimes, \u03a82 = Cabcdn\nambm\u0304cld is the only nonzero Weyl scalar. For a static spherically symmetric black hole in 4-dimensions (no assumption of asymptotic flatness) with a metric component \u2212gtt = f(r), we have, upon adopting the null coframe,\n\u03a82 = r2f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 2rf \u2032 + 2f \u2212 2\n12r2 , (4)\nDW =\n\u221a 2f(r2f \u2032\u2032 \u2212 2rf \u2032 + 2f \u2212 2)\n8r3 , (5)\nwhere DW is the component of the first order frame derivative of the Weyl tensor W = Cabcd; D := n\na\u2207a being the Newman-Penrose directional derivative. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can then be reproduced by\nSgrav := 1\n3 \u221a 2 \u222b rH 0 \u222b S2 \u2223\u2223\u2223DW \u03a82 \u2223\u2223\u2223r2 sin \u03b8\u221a f(r) dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = \u03c0r2H = A 4 ,\n(6) without a need of any cutoff near the singularity. Adopting the same language of Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol [98] by writing\nSgrav = \u222b V \u03c1grav Tgrav dV , (7)\nwe can interpret the Cartan invariants DW and W = |\u03a82| to be the \u201cenergy density and temperature of the gravitational field\u201d, respectively. The quantity DW is also known as the Cartan invariant, which vanishes on the horizon (and thus serves as a local \u201cdetector\u201d of a horizon [110]). Unlike the previous proposal in Eq.(3), Sgrav is\nfinite because of the function 1/ \u221a f(r) entering the hyperspace volume element dV3 = (r 2 sin \u03b8/ \u221a f(r)) dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6, which cancels the divergence behavior of the integrand \u03c1grav/Tgrav at the horizon. The prefactor 1/3 \u221a 2 in proposal (6) is chosen a posteriori to match the BekensteinHawking entropy, which is still a shortcoming (that is also present in [98] and [109]).\nOur proposal also works in the cosmological setting. Generalizations to higher dimensions, though not trivial, should be possible. We studied the 5-dimensional case explicitly as well [31]. Rather surprisingly, it also works for Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m spacetime (whereas this is not\n9 the case for proposal (3)). This seems to suggest that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole only counts the gravitational degrees of freedom.\nI think there is one major mystery yet to be understood in these proposals: the integral from r = 0 up to the horizon is an integral in time for the Schwarzschild case (since the vector field \u2202r is timelike in the interior), whereas for the cosmological spacetimes an integral out towards the cosmological horizon is an integral in space (granted that space itself is expanding hence there is a time dependence), and worse still for the Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m case, part of the integrals involve spatial integrals whereas the region between the two horizons is a temporal integral. Yet these distinctions do not seem to matter in calculating Sgrav, why is that? Naively one might suspect that entropy has to do with the temporal direction (in which the entropy increases \u2013 one such proposal for black hole entropy was made in [111]), but this does not appear to be the case.\nAnother interesting aspect is that our proposal is purely geometrical, so it will always give an area law regardless of the underlying gravitational theory. However, we know that not all black holes in modified gravity satisfy the simple area law. For example, S 6= A/4 in general in f(R) gravity [112\u2013117], the Lovelock theory [118], and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity [119\u2013121]. This suggests that some non-GR black holes might have different underlying microstates or microstructures from black holes in GR, in the sense that their gravitational entropy is not given by the integrand proportional to DW/\u03a82. In the next section, I will review another line of thought that also suggests this conclusion."

Recently, in a joint work with Di Gennaro and Good [32], we found that in the case of singly rotating black holes in dimensions d > 5, by defining the \u201cspring constant\u201d k from the difference of the Hawking temperature between a rotating black hole and a non-rotating one, and by identifying x with the event horizon r+ of the rotating black hole, the maximum value of F = kx in higher dimensions correspond to the instability point at which the black hole fragments into two, almost like an over-stretched spring. Note that black hole fragmentation is entropically allowed in d > 5, unlike in 4-dimensions in which fragmentation is impossible due to Hawking\u2019s area theorem. Though there is no fragmentation in d = 4, the Hookean law still exhibits interesting properties which I will come back to in the following.\nExplicitly, the Hawking temperature of a Myers-Perry\nblack hole in d-dimensional spacetime is given by\nT = 1\n4\u03c0 ( 2rd\u22124+ \u00b5 + d\u2212 5 r+ ) , (8)\nwhere \u00b5 is a normalized mass parameter14:\n\u00b5 := 16\u03c0G\n(d\u2212 2)\u2126d\u22122 M, \u2126d\u22122 :=\n2\u03c0 d\u22121 2 \u0393 ( d\u22121 2 ) . We can simplify the calculation by assuming an ultraspinning limit (but this is not necessary) so that \u00b5 can be expressed as \u00b5 = rd\u22125+ a 2, where a is the usual rotation parameter. Then the temperature can be re-written as\nT = 1\n2\u03c0  d\u2212 32\u00b5 1d\u22123 \u2212 [ d\u2212 3 2r+ (r+ a ) 2 d\u22123 \u2212 d\u2212 5 2r+ \u2212 r+ a2 ] \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=:k\n . (9)\nWhen k = 0 this expression reduces back to the temperature of a static black hole. So in this sense the \u201cspring constant\u201d k measures a deviation away from being Schwarzschild. The \u201cHookean force\u201d F = kr+ can be shown to be bounded from above\nF = d\u2212 3\n2 (r+ a ) 2 d\u22123 \u2212 d\u2212 5 2 \u2212 r2+ a2 . 0.21 (10)\nin Planck units. We referred to this as a \u201cforce\u201d only for convenience, it is not really a force, which can be seen by restoring ~, G, c, kB explicitly. Remarkably, despite the naively defined F = kr+, the upper bound corresponds to parameter values at which the black hole becomes unstable and is about to fragment into two Schwarzschild pieces. In terms of the rotation parameter a this happens when a/r+ & 1.36 according to Emparan and Myers [122].\nThis trend holds in d > 6, with the upper bound on F being monotonically decreasing with d. The case for d = 4 is interesting in its own right. There is no fragmentation in this case. However, the expression of k becomes equivalent to k = M\u21262+, which is of the same form as the spring constant of an actual spring of mass m, namely, k = m\u03c92 in undergraduate physics. It is this coincidence that led Good and I to propose the black hole \u201cspring constant\u201d in the first place [123]. This does not hold in higher dimensions, but the definition of k from Hawking temperature does extend meaningfully to higher dimensions. In d = 4 the Hookean law satisfies F 6 1/4, with equality attained when the black hole is an extremal Kerr solution. Note that there is no extremal limit in d > 6 singly rotating Myers-Perry spacetimes; for d = 5\n14Here \u2126d\u22122 is the area of the unit (d\u2212 2)-dimensional sphere, not to be confused with the angular velocity of the horizon, which I will denote \u2126+.\n10\nthe extremal case is essentially a naked singularity (the horizon coincides with it), but the black hole is likely to fragment before it becomes extremal.\nDespite the fact that F is not a real force, this looks suspiciously like the \u201cmaximum force conjecture\u201d in GR [33\u201336], which essentially states that the force between two bodies is bounded from above by 1/4 in its strong form, and by an O(1) value in its weak form [124]. There are indeed other conjectures concerning the maximum value of physical quantities that can be obtained from the maximum force by multiplying appropriate factors of ~, G, c [125\u2013127], although the maximum value is not necessarily 1/4. Having said that, surprisingly, the value 1/4 does make some intriguing appearances in our investigations of Myers-Perry black holes, although it is still unclear whether this is just a coincidence. First, as noted previously, the Hookean law satisfies F 6 1/4 in all dimensions. More intriguing features are revealed by plotting the sign of the Ruppeiner scalar in the phase space of angular momentum and entropy.\nThe Ruppeiner metric [128] is essentially the Hessian of the entropy function of the black hole parameters,\ngRij := \u2212\u2202i\u2202jS(M,Na), (11)\ninterpreted as a Riemannian metric in the phase space. Here M is the black hole mass, and Na are other extensive variables of the system (for our case, the angular momentum J). The Ruppeiner scalar, R, is the scalar curvature computed from this metric. In terms of the entropy S and the angular momentum J , it is given by\nR = \u2212 1 S\n1\u2212 12 \u00b7 d\u22125d\u22123 J2 S2( 1\u2212 4 \u00b7 d\u22125d\u22123 J2 S2 )( 1 + 4 \u00b7 d\u22125d\u22123 J2 S2 ) . (12) If we examine the sign of Ruppeiner scalar in the plot of S against J , we will find that [32] in 6 dimensions and above, there is always a wedge bounded by two straight lines passing through the origin in which the Ruppeiner scalar is positive. The upper line corresponds exactly to J2/S2 = 1/4 in d = 6, along which the Ruppeiner scalar vanishes. As d increases, the wedge region moves with respect to this line, so that J2/S2 = 1/4 is contained in the wedge (and thus has positive Ruppeiner scalar). In the large d limit, the line J2/S2 = 1/4 tends to the lower boundary line of the wedge. The lower line always corresponds to a diverging Ruppeiner scalar in all dimensions d > 6.\nIt has been argued that the Ruppeiner scalar encodes the type of interactions of the underlying degrees of freedom in a statistic mechanical system [129, 130]. More precisely, the scalar curvature is positive if the underlying statistical interactions of the thermodynamical system is repulsive, and likewise it is negative for attractive interactions. The system becomes more unstable as the Ruppeiner scalar increases its value [131, 132]. A diverging scalar curvature indicates a phase transition. Of course, if the Ruppeiner metric (Eq.(11)) is defined without the negative sign then the interpretation of the interactions would be the opposite.\nModulo the subtleties of whether this interpretation really applies to black holes because the spacetime metric signature is Lorentzian [133], our results suggest that the microstructures of black holes usually have an attractive interaction among themselves. As angular momentum increases, the interaction can turn repulsive and eventually the black hole breaks apart. The fragmentation line is not the same as the phase transition line mentioned above, but is rather always located above the J2/S2 = 1/4 line (so the phase transition is not really relevant). As the number of dimension increases, the fragmentation line shifts closer towards the phase transition line. This seems to indicate that as the number of spacetime dimensions increases, it gets harder to break apart the black hole (as the attractive interaction is stronger). We suggested an intuitive picture: imagine the microstructures are like molecules that bond to their neighbors in many directions. With more independent spatial directions, there are more bonds available, and so it becomes increasingly hard to completely break them apart by fast rotation with respect to one particular axis only. Of course this does not tell us what sort of microstructures underlie black hole thermodynamics, but it does perhaps give us a new direction to think about some issues. (Note that the Hookean F should not be interpreted as the actual force between the microstructures.)\nIt is unlikely that the bound for the Hookean law F 6 1/4 is true for all black holes, but this might not be a shortcoming. Rather, it might be an indication that the linear Hookean law F = kx no longer applies. As we suggested in [32], it is possible that other black hole solutions (with other matter fields, non-GR etc.) might go beyond the linear spring regime (and the new F might then be bounded by 1/4, but this is just a guess at this point). After all, for actual springs, how the force scales with the stretched distance x in the non-linear regime depends on what sort of material it is made from. Perhaps black holes would be the same, and the behavior beyond the naively defined Hookean law might reveal more about the different microstructures underlying black holes in different theories."

            "heading": "V. OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE",
            "text": "In this review I have looked into some aspects of black hole thermodynamics and black hole singularities, as well as their possible connections. In particular, I discussed the possibility that some kind of quantum singularities might remain even in QG, that singularities play some roles in guaranteeing a stable ground state exists, as well as connecting the black hole \u201cinternal energy\u201d that appears in the first law of black hole thermodynamics with the black hole ADM mass. Since energy is somewhat related to the least action principle, it is also worth mentioning the so-called \u201cfinite-action conjecture\u201d [134, 135], in which the finiteness of the action of a cosmological theory (\u201ctotal action of the universe\u201d) is tied to the sin-\n11\ngularities in spacetime. In other words, if a spacetime has no singularity, then the \u201caction singularities\u201d (divergence) cannot be avoided and vice-versa. Thus the question becomes: is keeping the action finite more important, such that spacetime singularities are relatively small price to pay? Incidentally, requiring a finite total action also relates to the Weyl curvature hypothesis and the arrow of time issue [136], and hence is relevant for gravitational entropy.\nI also discussed the ever mysterious microstructures of black holes \u2013 the \u201cspacetime atoms/molecules\u201d that form the statistical mechanics basis for black hole thermodynamics, from two perspectives. The first is from the point of view of gravitational entropy utilizing the Cartan invariant and the Weyl scalar, which reproduces (up to a constant prefactor) the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a spherically symmetric black hole that satisfies the area law. Some aspects of this proposal (as well as some other similar proposals in the literature) remain mysterious, such as why it involves the integral from the singularity to the horizon, regardless of whether r is a spatial or temporal coordinate. As far as the microstructures are concerned, we can conclude that if this proposal is correct, then (1) the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy measures only the gravitational degrees of freedom even when there are some other fields present (e.g., the Maxwell field in the Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m case); and (2) the microstructures could be different for black holes that do not satisfy the area law, because different combinations of curvature invariants would be required to reproduce their entropy expressions.\nThe second perspective is from the point of view of a recently proposed Hookean law of black holes, which also hinted at possibly different microstructures for black holes in different theories of gravity. The Hookean law F = kx for Myers-Perry black holes in GR is bounded by some dimension-dependent value (all less than 1/4) that also correspond to black hole parameters that, as Emparan and Myers shown [122], the black holes become unstable and should fragment into two Schwarzschild pieces. In this sense it is an interesting and novel aspect of black hole thermodynamics that deserves a deeper study.\nI think there are plenty of interesting issues to be further investigated, especially about gravitational entropy, and how this can be properly taken into account by the generalized second law when gravitational waves are emitted during black hole mergers. Is the GSL a good guiding principle even in QG? The relationship between singularities and black hole thermodynamics should also be looked into on various levels. For example, a recent work by Bousso and Shahbazi-Moghaddam [137] proved a version of the singularity theorem assuming the existence of \u201chyperentropic region\u201d, namely a spacetime region that has an entropy that exceeds the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of its spatial boundary. Essentially this tells us that a singularity must form if a region has too much entropy. What other fascinating connections are there between singularities and thermodynamics in general? Can we\nsomehow prescribe the notion of entropy to singularities themselves? (One such attempt in a special case was carried out in [138].) This might be needed if we were to understand why two colliding black holes cannot \u201cannihilate\u201d each other by converting into pure gravitational waves, by keeping track of the entropy in the gravitational waves and the singularity that might be left behind. There is also another huge area that has made quite a lot of progress in recent years that I have not reviewed in this work, namely the quantum information perspective, especially insights gained in the contexts of gauge/gravity correspondence (entanglement entropy, complexity, etc.); see [139\u2013141].\nOn the other hand, I also feel that we need to reexamine some very fundamental issues regarding the nature of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We should perhaps take a step back and ask whether black hole thermodynamics is special in some sense compared to other \u201cordinary\u201d thermodynamical systems. In the context of black hole evaporation, it is the prevalent point of view among most theoretical physicists (with notable exceptions like Penrose) that quantum information is never lost, and that an evaporating black hole is fundamentally the same as a burning book or a piece of hot coal [142], so that the information in a black hole can in principle be recovered from the Hawking radiation. This might or might not be true. Regardless, there is one fundamental difference between black hole and ordinary thermodynamical system: the second law of the latter system is not an absolute law, rather it is a statistical one. There is always a very small probability that some rare configurations of the microstates can occur and so the entropy decreases. To put simply, there are thermal fluctuations that can lower the entropy. In fact, given sufficient time, systems near equilibrium will spontaneously fluctuate into lower-entropy states, thus locally reversing the thermodynamic arrow of time (the cosmological implication of such a phenomenon was studied in [143]). The second law for black holes (Hawking\u2019s area law), on the other hand, is absolute. As long as the energy condition is satisfied, the differential geometric proof does not allow the horizon area to ever decrease under classical processes. (Other dissimilarities between black holes and ordinary thermodynamical systems were discussed in [144].)\nHistorically, Max Planck once objected Boltzmann\u2019s theory of atoms because he believed that the second law should be absolute and not statistical. He thought that the atomic idea was irreconcilably opposed to the law of entropy increase [145]. Now, interestingly, as already explained, black hole entropy is \u201cPlanckian\u201d rather than \u201cBoltzmannian\u201d. One may wish to argue that the interpretation of black hole area as entropy requires quantum mechanics, or else the entropy would be infinite, since ~ is in the denominator of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula (though the first law makes sense without quantum mechanics: ~ cancels out in T dS). So in this sense, Hawking\u2019s area theorem is not entirely classical and therefore the energy conditions might not hold absolutely, which in\n12\nturn allows the area to occasionally decrease. However, usually when we say that the classical energy condition can be violated when quantum effects are considered, we are referring to the matter sector. What happens when we consider only the gravitational field? How does the quantum nature of the horizon entropy allow the area to decrease, and how is this tied to the energy condition? To some extent, we already understood that the classical null energy condition is a property of gravity that follows from the second law of thermodynamics applied locally to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy associated with patches of null congruences [146]. But to fully answer this question we may have to first understand the properties of the microstructures of black holes. A possible arena to investigate this issue is via gauge/gravity correspondence, since the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the bulk is dual to the entropy of the matter field at the AdS boundary, thus if the matter field entropy is \u201cBoltzmannian\u201d, so should the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in some way. On the other hand, we are used to thermodynamics being a manifestation of the underlying statistical mechanics. Is this really true for black holes? Perhaps a different approach in understanding thermodynamics quite independently of statistical mechanics could shed some light on this mystery [147\u2013149].\nLastly, let me mention some other quantum aspects of singularities. I have already discussed the possibility that the classical singularities are not completely cured, but rendered more benign in some form in QG. If so, this could be useful for other purposes. For example, it has been suggested that such singularities could induce dimensional reduction effects in QG, which could render QG perturbatively renormalizable [150, 151]. Penrose, on the other hand, suggested that information is truly lost inside a black hole once it hits the singularity. As a consequence, the relevant phase space volume is reduced [152]. Imposing suitable boundary conditions at or near the singularity (or whatever replaced it in QG) may also help to resolve the arrow of time problem [153\u2013155]. Curiously, there is also the possibility\nthat the arrow of time is nontrivial inside black holes [154, 156]. As for cosmic censorship at the quantum level, a curious related result is the discovery of a dynamically generated boundary, dubbed the \u201cZeno border\u201d near the Schwarzschild singularity [157]. There is no loss of predictability because the singularity cannot be probed by a quantum field. This is consistent with the previous results in the literature that Schwarzschild spacetime is quantum complete in the sense that the ground state does not support field configurations near the singularity [158]; see also [157, 159]. It is clear that there are many interesting issues to be studied, even after almost half a century of the discovery of black hole thermodynamics."
