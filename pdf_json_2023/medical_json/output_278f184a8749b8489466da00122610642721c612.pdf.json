    "abstractText": "Study question To construct prediction models based on the Bayesian network (BN) learning method for the probability of fertilization failure (including low fertilization rate [LRF] and total fertilization failure [TFF]) in assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment. Summary answer A BN model was developed to predict TFF/LFR. The model showed relatively high calibration in external validation, which could facilitate the identification of risk factors for fertilization disorders and improve the efficiency of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment. What is known already The prediction of TFF/LFR is very complex. Although some studies attempted to construct prediction models for TFF/LRF, most of the reported models were based on limited variables and traditional regression-based models, which are unsuitable for analyzing real-world clinical data. Therefore, none of the reported models have been widely used in routine clinical practice. To date, BN modeling analysis is a prominent and increasingly popular machine learning method that is powerful in dealing with dynamic and complex real-world data. Study design, size, duration A retrospective study was performed with 106,640 fresh embryo IVF/ICSI cycles from 2009 to 2019 in one of China\u2019s largest reproductive health centers. Participants/materials, setting, methods A total of 106, 640 cycles were included in this study, including 97,102 controls, 4,339 LFR cases, and 5,199 TFF cases. Twenty-four predictors were initially included, including 13 femalerelated variables, five male-related variables, and six variables related to IVF/ICSI treatment. BN modeling analysis with tenfold cross-validation was performed to construct the predictive model for TFF/LFR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curves (AUCs) were used to evaluate the performance of",

The model showed relatively high calibration in external validation, which could facilitate the identification of risk factors for fertilization disorders and improve the efficiency of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment.\nWhat is known already The prediction of TFF/LFR is very complex. Although some studies attempted to construct prediction models for TFF/LRF, most of the reported models were based on limited variables and traditional regression-based models, which are unsuitable for analyzing real-world clinical data. Therefore, none of the reported models have been widely used in routine clinical practice. To date, BN modeling analysis is a prominent and increasingly popular machine learning method that is powerful in dealing with dynamic and complex real-world data.\nStudy design, size, duration A retrospective study was performed with 106,640 fresh embryo IVF/ICSI cycles from 2009 to 2019 in one of China\u2019s largest reproductive health centers.\nParticipants/materials, setting, methods A total of 106, 640 cycles were included in this study, including 97,102 controls, 4,339 LFR cases, and 5,199 TFF cases. Twenty-four predictors were initially included, including 13 femalerelated variables, five male-related variables, and six variables related to IVF/ICSI treatment. BN modeling analysis with tenfold cross-validation was performed to construct the predictive model for TFF/LFR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curves (AUCs) were used to evaluate the performance of the BN model.\nMain results and the role of chance All twenty-four predictors were first organized into seven hierarchical layers in a theoretical BN model, according to prior knowledge from previous literature and clinical practice. A machinelearning BN model was generated based on real-world clinical data, containing a total of eighteen predictors, of\n*Correspondence: Yuanyuan Wang yyuanwang@163.com Jie Qiao jie.qiao@263.net Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nwhich the infertility type, ART method, and number of retrieved oocytes directly influence the probabilities of LFR/ TFF. The prediction accuracy of the BN model was 91.7%. The AUC of the TFF versus control groups was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.766-0.791), with a sensitivity of 71.2% and specificity of 70.1%; the AUC of of TFF versus LFR groups was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.790-0.824), with a sensitivity of 49.0% and specificity of 99.0%.\nLimitations, reason for caution First, our study was based on clinical data from a single center, and the results of this study should be further verified by external data. In addition, some critical data (e.g., the detailed IVF laboratory parameters of the sperm and oocytes used for insemination) were not available in this study, which should be given full consideration when further improving the performance of the BN model.\nWider implications of the findings Based on extensive clinical real-world data, we developed a BN model to predict the probabilities of fertilization failures in ART, which provides new clues for clinical decision-making support for clinicians in formulating personalized treatment plans and further improving ART treatment outcomes.\nStudy funding/competing interest(s) Dr. Y.

            "text": "Fertilization is the most crucial step during in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Fertilization results from complex processes and reactions between sperm and oocytes [1, 2]. Any breakdown in this process could lead to fertilization disorders, including a low fertilization rate (LFR, defined as a fertilization rate lower than 25%) or even total fertilization failure (TFF, defined as no fertilized egg formation and a fertilization rate of zero) [3]. The occurrence of an LFR ranges from 10 to 20% in IVF, while that of TFF is 10%- 20% in IVF and even 3\u20135% in ICSI [4, 5]. The TFF/LFR could result in the failure of IVF/ICSI treatment, thus placing heavy economic and psychological burdens on couples undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles.\nThe prediction of TFF/LFR is very complex. Although the laboratory parameters of retrieved sperm and oocytes have been proposed to be essential factors in the fertilization rate [6, 7], it has been reported that TFF can also occur in couples with apparently normal gametes with good quality [8], implying that there might be other important factors that affect fertilization. Recently, many studies have reported that disrupted genetic and epigenetic patterns [9, 10], female age and duration of infertility [11], and female hormone levels [12, 13] could contribute to the risk of fertilization failure.\nSome studies have attempted to develop prediction models for the occurrence of fertilization disorders based on traditional regression models. One study included 304 couples with TFF and 304 control couples to develop a prediction model for TFF [14], while another study included 892 couples to develop a TFF prediction model\n[15]. These reported models are based on minimal sample sizes and variables, and none have been widely used in routine clinical practice [16]. In our previous study, we used an extensive clinical database based on IVF medical records and established a prediction model for TFF/ LFR using multiple logistic regression models [17]. Traditional regression-based approaches have the following features: 1) they model associations rather than causal structures; 2) they operate under restrictive assumptions about the relationships among variables, and the relationships between predictors cannot be considered; and 3) each outcome must be trained on the model and a static set of data [18]. These features make the roles of conventional regression-based prediction models quite limited, especially for dynamic and complicated clinical data.\nMachine learning algorithms for constructing personalized risk prediction models have been extensively developed. The Bayesian network (BN) is one of the most widely used machine learning approaches for risk prediction [19]. The structure of a BN model is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the arcs have a formal interpretation in terms of probabilistic conditional independence [20]. BN models are powerful for investigating dependent relationships among the variables of a domain under uncertainty and dealing with real-world data that are dynamic and complex [19].\nTherefore, we performed a retrospective study based on a real-world clinical database that involved 106,640 IVF/ ICSI cycles from 2009 to 2019 in a reproductive center. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel BN model with better performance. The model accurately and dynamically predicted the possibilities of TFF/LFR by using known predictors obtained from clinical practice. This\nstudy could provide new clues for clinical decision-making support for clinicians in formulating personalized treatment plans and further improving the outcomes of IVF/ICSI treatment."

Therefore, the arc from \u201cgenetic factor\u201d to \u201cfemale age\u201d is included the blacklist and is never included in the network during machine learning). The variables in the latter layer cannot influence the variables in the former layers, which means that the arcs cannot point from the latter layers to the former layers. In addition, femalerelated variables are considered not to be adjusted with male-related variables. We performed structure learning based on the Hill Climber Bayes Net method, which can add, delete, and reverse edges (arrows) as it searches through the feature space and terminates when an optimal model structure is achieved [27].

Bayesian statistics have been rapidly developed to solve real-world data problems and have now permeated all the major areas of medical statistics, including clinical trials, epidemiology, predictive modeling, and decisionmaking [28]. BN analysis could provide a natural way to represent the uncertainties involved in medicine when dealing with diagnosis, treatment selection, planning, and prognosis prediction [19]. Recently, various studies have reported BN-based predictive models and decision support systems in the medical field. One study derived a new Bayesian network-based risk stratification model for the prediction of short-term and long-term mortality in patients with left ventricular assist devices, with accuracies of 95%, 90%, 90%, 83%, and 78%, and ROCs of 91%, 82%, 82%, 80% and 81% respectively at each endpoints postimplantation (30\u00a0day, 90\u00a0day, 6\u00a0months, 1\u00a0year, and 2\u00a0years), which were higher than those of traditional conventional predictive models [27]. A study performed a BN analysis of the probabilistic relationships between various obesity phenotypes and cardiovascular disease risk based on 6276 individuals within the Chinese population and showed that the probability of cardiovascular disease risk was influenced by age and sex [17]. Bayesian network structures have also been developed and validated to predict tumor risk, recurrence, and survival [29]. These previous studies indicate that Bayesian models can reliably represent the complex causal relationships of multiple variables with clinical outcomes. However, the BN model has not yet been used in the field of reproductive health. Moreover, although some studies have reported predictive models for fertilization disorders based on traditional statistical analysis, no model has been widely used in clinical practice [16]. One European study reported that the number of retrieved oocytes, female smoking, and nontubal factor infertility were predictors of TFF [14]. Another study reported that male age, the number of IVF cycles, the indication for IVF, and the prewash total motile sperm count were predictors\nfor TFF with an AUC of 0.75 [15]. Our previous study developed a traditional logistic analysis-based predictive model for TFF/LFR based on clinical variables. The AUC for the TFF group was 0.743 (95% CI: 0.729\u20130.757), with a sensitivity of 66.1% and specificity of 70.3% [21].\nWe reported a BN predictive model for fertilization failure in the present study. The AUC for the TFF group using the BN model was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.766\u20130.791), which was higher than that in previous studies. The sensitivity and specificity of the BN model for the TFF group were 71.2% and 70.1%, respectively. The sensitivity was higher than that of the traditional model, implying that the model could distinguish TFF cases from controls more easily and sensitively. Notably, the AUC of the TFF versus LFR groups in this study reached 0.807 (95% CI: 0.790\u20130.824), indicating that this BN model had good performance in distinguishing TFF from LFR, which could help clinicians identify patients who may have TFF from those with a LFR. The BN model identified three key variables, including infertility type, insemination method, and the number of oocytes retrieved, that were the most crucial predictors for TFF/LRF and directly impacted the probability of fertilization disorders. For a couple diagnosed with primary infertility, and less than 5 retrieved oocytes (nonmodified variables), the probability for TFF was 20.6% when they underwent IVFET insemination. Nevertheless, the probability could decrease to 14.9% when they undergo ICSI. This model is meaningful in assisting clinicians in a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d manner to modify their detailed protocols to decrease the probability of TFF.\nMost traditional regression-based models can only show how each variable relates to the outcomes. Nevertheless, these models do not perform well in determining the predictors\u2019 interactions. In contrast to traditional statistical methods, which comprise weighted combinations of independent variables, BNs provide the advantages of a rigorous probabilistic framework to perform inference for multiple variables and an intuitive representation that clinicians can easily interpret. In this study, we found that although several variables did not show direct associations with fertilization failure, they could influence other vital variables and form complex networks, thus affecting fertilization failure. For example, in the current BN model, female age could influence factors such as the AFC, BMI, parity, gravidity, and female disease history. These variables further influenced the key variables, such as the number of retrieved oocytes and insemination methods during treatment, thus contributing to the probability of fertilization failures. The \u201cstep-by-step\u201d network provides a more accurate and detailed description and improves the performance of the patient decision-making process compared to the \u201cblack-box\u201d risk\nscores, which can only take limited numbers of variables into account and have difficulty representing the complexity of the occurrence of LFR/TFF.\nMissing information for several variables frequently occurs among patient records, and traditional regression-based models do not solve this problem. BN models can intuitively present relationships between predictors, evaluate potential possibilities for outcomes layer by layer based on some given predictors, fill missing values and solve \u201cuncertainties\u201d by calculating conditional possibilities based on a parent node. Therefore, BN models have already been translated into clinical practice [30, 31]. For example, the Pittsburgh Cervical Cancer Screening Model, a dynamic Bayesian network assessing the risk of cervical precancer and invasive cancer, has been established. It was constructed based on expert knowledge and follow-up data collected over 13\u00a0years [32]. BN models also performed better in diagnosing dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to most other well-known classifiers/models [31]. Therefore, based on the BN model validated in this study, we plan to develop an online application available to clinicians and patients, that could easily interpret the predictors and key decision points of fertilization failure along the continuum of a patient\u2019s clinical course. The application will be integrated with electronic health records to compute patients\u2019 probabilities of TFF/LFR based on the most current clinical data available. An additional feature will allow reproductive clinicians to customize the decision support tool according to each patient\u2019s unique conditions.\nSome limitations need to be addressed before any potential extrapolation of the findings. First, our study was based on a single-center analysis. Although this center is one of the largest reproductive health centers in China, serving infertile couples from all 31 provinces in China, the BN model constructed by using the single-center clinical data in this study should be further verified by external data. Second, since our data were automatically extracted from the computer-based patient record system, the detailed IVF laboratory parameters of sperm and oocytes used for insemination were unavailable; thus, the impact of sperm and oocyte parameters on fertilization outcomes was not evaluated in this study. Third, based on the center\u2019s data sharing & access regulations, any personally identifiable information (such as name and ID card) should be excluded from the dataset used for scientific research. So, we could only obtain data based on IVF cycles. The data used in this study were per cycle, not per couple or patient, so the BN model might not apply to patients with recurrent fertilization disorders. Further research is needed to explore such predictive factors or models for chronic fertilization disorders\nand consider the influence of repeated measurement and recurrent fertilization disorders. Fourth, since most of the predictors used in this study were known factors, we did not provide new predictors for TFF/LFR. However, the primary purpose of our study was to develop a predictive model with better performance and fit for real-world data based on known clinical factors rather than to capture new risk factors for TFF/LFR. Fifth, rather than giving a specific cutoff value as in traditional regression models, in the BN model, the decision-making meant that we could compare possibilities of TFF/LFR in different protocols and then choose the optimal protocol with the lowest predicted probability of TFF/LFR. Finally, the BN model performed well in distingguishing TFF patients from LFR patients and controls. Identifying TFF patients is of great concern for clinicians and embryologists. However, the model did not perform as well in distinguishing LFR from controls. Therefore, the BN model should be further optimized to better distinguish LFR group from controls by using more sensitive predictors in further research. In addition, we deleted cycles with missing values rather than filling the missing values by using some statistical approaches. However, we compared distributions of the critical variables between excluded (incomplete data) and included (complete data) data. The frequencies of key variables such as the age of the partners, number of retrieved oocytes, insemination method, and infertility type, which directly influenced fertilization in the BN model, were comparable between the included and excluded cycles. This implies that the missing data were likely to be missing at random, and deleting these missing values may not have introduced much bias (Supplementary Table\u00a03)."

The insemination method, infertility type, and number of retrieved oocytes were direct predictors of TFF/ LFR. The BN model provided relatively good performance in distinguishing the TFF group from controls and LFR groups, but the performance in distinguishing the LFR group from controls needs improvement. The model could be used to build clinical decision support systems to predict fertilization disorders and further provide new evidence for the power of the BN model and its wider use in modeling and the analysis of medical data, especially when the analysis concerns areas of diagnostic or prognostic uncertainty and a sizeable number of variables are involved in the process.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12958- 023- 01065-x.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1.
