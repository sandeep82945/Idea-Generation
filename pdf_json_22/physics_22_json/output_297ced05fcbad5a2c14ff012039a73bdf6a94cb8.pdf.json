            "text": "The existence of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) with masses larger than billion solar masses at z & 6 (e.g., Ban\u0303ados et al. 2018; Matsuoka et al. 2018a; Wang et al. 2021a), when the Universe was < 1 Gyr old, challenges our current understanding of SMBH and galaxy formation and evolution, and is thus one of the most pressing open issues in modern astrophysics (e.g., Woods et al. 2019). Their distance and faintness make observations of these objects difficult and strongly biased towards the most luminous and massive accreting SMBHs. A complementary approach is to use numerical simulations as tools to study the largely unknown phases of SMBH growth in the early Universe (e.g., Tanaka & Haiman 2009; Sijacki et al. 2009; Habouzit et al. 2016, 2019). However, observed properties of high-redshift accreting SMBHs, or active galactic nuclei (AGN), and predictions of numerical simulations have been compared only seldom (e.g., Ni et al. 2020; Habouzit et al. 2021; Di Mascia et al. 2021a, Zana et al. accepted).\nAn important ingredient entering in numerical simulations focused on the early growth of SMBHs is the effect of AGN feedback (e.g. Costa et al. 2014, 2020; Barai et al. 2018; Habouzit et al. 2019; Valentini et al. 2021), as it is often considered to have a major role in shaping the evolution of AGN and galaxies along the whole cosmic history (e.g., Fiore et al. 2017). In particular, optically-selected luminous quasi-\nstellar objects (QSOs) in the early Universe often present evidence for the launching of fast and massive multi-phase outflows (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al. 2015; Bischetti et al. 2019; Carniani et al. 2019; Schindler et al. 2020; Izumi et al. 2021; but see also, e.g., Decarli et al. 2018; Novak et al. 2020; Meyer et al. 2022), which are expected to affect the observable properties of the QSOs themselves and their host galaxies, such as X-ray oscuration, UV extinction, and gas content (e.g., Brusa et al. 2015; Ni et al. 2020).\nOutflows observed in QSOs are though to originate from fast nuclear winds, which, in turn, may be accelerated by several physical mechanisms, including radiation pressure, due to UV photons produced in the accretion disc, on dust grains or on partially ionized gas mediated by UV transitions, and magnetic effects (e.g. Proga et al. 2000; Murray et al. 2005; Fabian et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2015; Ricci et al. 2017). The physical scales involved in these processes are those of the accretion disk (e.g., Giustini & Proga 2019). Since such scales cannot be resolved by large-scale cosmological simulations, different authors have modeled AGN feedback using several different recipes (e.g., Barai et al. 2018; Costa et al. 2020; Ni et al. 2020). Moreover, the effect of the outflow on the surrounding material can potentially depend on its geometry (e.g., Zubovas et al. 2016). Since the exact acceleration physics, and thus launching direction, of nuclear winds is not well understood, numerical simulations typically assume ei-\n\u00a9 2020 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n09 18\n1v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n1 8\nM ay\n2 02\n2 ther spherical (e.g., Feng et al. 2016) or bi-conical (e.g., Sala et al. 2021) outflow geometry as study cases.\nBeside the properties of the individual galaxies hosting accreting SMBHs, numerical simulations provide also information on the environment of high-redshift luminous AGN. While these objects are expected to reside in the peaks of the dark matter halo distribution, which are generally characterized by large overdensities of galaxies (e.g., Costa et al. 2014; Wise et al. 2019), although with some scatter (e.g., Habouzit et al. 2019), observations struggle to provide us with a clear view of typical high-redshift QSO environment. In fact, z > 6 QSOs have been reported to reside in a variety of environments, including underdense, normal, and overdense regions (e.g. Ota et al. 2018; Mazzucchelli et al. 2019; Overzier 2021). The first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensity around a z > 6 QSOs was presented recently by Mignoli et al. (2020), followed by a tentative confirmation of another structure by Overzier (2021).\nA significant fraction (\u2248 40%) of z & 6 QSOs has ALMAdetected dusty companion galaxies at distances of a few kpc (e.g. Willott et al. 2017; Decarli et al. 2018; Neeleman et al. 2019; Venemans et al. 2020). These satellite galaxies might host heavily reddened and buried AGN (e.g., Di Mascia et al. 2021a), although currently there is no strong observational evidence for the presence of accreting SMBHs in their centres (e.g., Connor et al. 2019, 2020; Vito et al. 2019a, 2021). Such objects would be typically brighter than inactive galaxies, expecially in the X-ray band. Therefore, their predicted number in numerical simulations can be tested against observational results to infer how well simulations approximate reality.\nIn this paper, we present a study of the effect of AGN kinetic feedback on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN in cosmological simulations. In particular, we analyse a set of numerical simulations presented by Barai et al. (2018, hereafter, B18) with different kinetic feedback prescriptions, focusing on the most massive SMBH at z = 6 and its surrounding environment. We extract multiwavelength observables such as column density and radial extent of the gas distributed in the host galaxies, UV and X-ray AGN fluxes, and number of satellite AGN detectable over small (i.e., a few kpc) distances from the central SMBH. We compare these properties with results from multiwavelength observations.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In \u00a7 2 we describe the numerical setup of the simulations, the AGN selection, and the method used to measure the gas column density and distribution. In \u00a7 3 we discuss the redshift evolution of the column densities for the considered AGN. In \u00a7 4 we present the observable properties of the simulated AGN and their host galaxies, and we compare them with empirical findings. In \u00a7 5 we investigate the presence of multiple AGN systems over scales of a few kpc, and we compare their detectability rates in the X-ray band with results from observations of high-redshift AGN. Finally, in \u00a7 6 we discuss and interpret the results, and in \u00a7 7 we provide a summary. All quoted distances are physical unless otherwise noticed. We adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology with H0 = 67.7 km s\n\u22121 and \u2126m = 0.307 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016)."

We provide here a summary of the numerical setup and refer to the original works for an in-depth discussion.\nB18 used a modified version of the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) N-body code gadget-3 (Springel 2005) to follow the evolution of a comoving volume of (500 Mpc)3, starting from cosmological initial condition generated with music (Hahn & Abel 2011) at z = 100, and zooming-in on the most massive (i.e., 4 \u00d7 1012 M ) dark matter (DM) halo, corresponding to a \u2248 3\u03c3 overdensity (e.g., Barkana & Loeb 2001), inside the box down to z = 6. Therefore, the final zoomed-in simulations focus by construction on a highly biased cubic region, with a volume of (5.21 Mpc)3. The highest level of the simulation has a mass resolution of mDM = 7.54\u00d7106 M and mgas = 1.41\u00d7106 M for DM and gas particles, respectively. The softening length for gravitational forces for these high-resolution DM and gas particles is Rsoft = 1h\n\u22121 ckpc. The code accounts for gas heating and cooling (including metal-line cooling) depending on the gas metal content, based on eleven element species (H, He, C, Ca, O, N, Ne, Mg, S, Si, Fe) that are tracked in the simulation (Tornatore et al. 2007). Star formation in the inter-stellar medium (ISM) is implemented following the multiphase effective subresolution model by Springel & Hernquist (2003), adopting a density threshold for star formation of nSF = 0.13 cm\n\u22123. The simulations include stellar winds, supernovae feedback, and metal enrichment, and assume a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function in the mass range 0.1 \u2212 100 M (Tornatore et al. 2007; Barai et al. 2013; Biffi et al. 2016).\nWhen a DM halo that is not already hosting a black hole (BH) reaches a total mass of Mh > 109 M , a MBH = 105 M BH is seeded at its centre. BHs are treated as collisionless sink particles and are allowed to grow by accretion of the surrounding gas or by mergers with other BHs. Gas accretion onto BHs is modelled via the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton accretion rate M\u0307Bondi (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939; Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Bondi 1952), capped at the Eddington rate M\u0307Edd:\nM\u0307BH = min(M\u0307Bondi, M\u0307Edd). (1)\nAccreting BH radiate away a fraction r of the accreted restmass energy, with a bolometric luminosity\nLbol = rM\u0307BHc 2, (2)\nwhere c is the speed of light. B18 fixed the radiative efficiency to r = 0.1, a fiducial value for radiatively efficient, geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks around a Schwarzschild BH (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973).\nA fraction f = 0.05 of the total output energy is distributed to the surrounding gas in a kinetic form1. In AGNcone the kinetic energy is distributed along two cones with a half-opening angle of 45\u25e6. The direction of the cone axis is chosen randomly for each BH at the seeding time, and is kept\n1 We refer to B18 for details about the choice of the value for f and the numerical implementation of the kinetic feedback.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\nFeedback effect on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN 3\nfixed throughout the simulation (Barai et al. 2018), similarly to what is done in Zubovas et al.

In particular, we follow the most massive SMBH at z = 6 in each simulation set, and consider a box with side size of 60 kpc centred on it. We refer to all of the SMBHs in the box accreting at \u02d9MBH > 0.02 M yr\n\u22121 (i.e., Lbol \u2248 1044 erg s\u22121) as AGN. Fig. 1 presents the BH mass evolution of AGN in the two simulations. Each AGN is labelled with the initial letter of the run (C for AGNcone, S for AGNsphere).\nAGNcone forms two very massive (> 109M ) BHs at z < 7, while only less massive BHs are formed in the AGNsphere run. This behaviour is linked to the implementation of the feedback: AGNcone allows the gas to accrete continuously along the equatorial directions, while the lack of a preferential direction along which the outflow is launched in AGNsphere does not allow for a steady and efficient accretion onto the SMBH. This effect can be appreciated in Fig. 2: the accretion rate of AGNcone is generally higher than that of AGNsphere, at least up to M\u0307 \u2248 1\u221230 M yr\u22121. At higher accretion rates, which are reached by the most accreting BHs at z < 7, AGN feedback prevents further increase of the accretion rate.\nHereafter, we focus our analysis on the AGN that reach z = 6 with MBH > 10 8 M and Lbol > 10 46 erg s\u22121; (see filled symbols in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), which we refer to as \u201cbright AGN\u201d (i.e., C1, C2, and C3 in AGNcone; S1 and S2 in AGNsphere). These BH mass and luminosity values are typical of known z > 6 QSOs (e.g., Yang et al. 2021), allowing us to compare the physical properties of simulated and observed AGN in a consistent way. We note that, since the simulations focus on a single cosmic region at high redshift, the derived expectations on the AGN observable properties might be affected by cosmic variance."

            "text": "Here we describe the method that we use to derive the distribution of hydrogen, helium, and metal column densities in the ISM for galaxies hosting AGN in the considered simulations. We make use of the hydrogen column density in the remaining of the paper to derive the observational properties predicted by the two considered simulations.\nWe estimate the distribution of the column densities for the bright AGN in the simulations by launching 1000 randomly selected lines of sight (LOSs) toward each AGN from a distance d = 30 kpc. Each LOS is considered as the axis of a cylinder with basis radius of Rsoft. We note that the resolutions of the simulations do not allow us to probe structures on smaller scales, as, for instance, the existence of a dusty torus on pc scales. Then, each cylinder is divided along its length into bins of lbin = 0.25 kpc width, for a total of\nd lbin = 120 radial bins. We compute the density of each chemical element in a bin of the cylinder from the mass carried by each particle included in that bin. With this approach, we also obtain the radial distribution of the gas density. Finally, we integrate\nalong the cylinder to compute the total column density of hydrogen (NH) and of the other elements. The resulting total NH is not sensitive to reasonably different values of lbin (i.e., from 0.25 kpc to 1 kpc). Therefore, we used lbin = 0.25 as this value allows us to sample well the radial distribution of the gas (see \u00a7 4.2). Fig. 3 (upper panel) presents an example of the derived column-density map centred on the QSO C1 in AGNcone. Each circle represents one of the 1000 random LOSs, which sample homogeneously the entire solid angle as seen from C1.\nTo assess the effect of feedback on the column density (\u00a7 3), we also consider an additional simulation run presented in Barai et al. (2018), that is identical in terms of initial conditions and physical prescriptions to the AGNcone and AGNsphere, except that BHs are not seeded. The only type of feedback in this run, which we refer to as noAGN , is due to supernovae explosions (see Barai et al. 2018 for detailed discussion).\nWe associate each AGN in a simulation to the corresponding galaxy in the noAGN runs following a method similar to that described in Zana et al. (accepted): first, we identify the DM halo hosting the AGN as the one having its centre of mass closest to the position of the SMBH. Then, we identify the corresponding halo in the noAGN run by crossmatching the DM particle IDs in the two runs, and selecting the halo in noAGN which shares the largest fraction of particles with the initial AGN halo, further imposing that the mass difference must be within a factor of 10-50.%2 Finally, we repeat the procedure described above on the selected halo in noAGN , and derive the column density distribution in absence of AGN feedback. At z > 8, the redshifts at which the noAGN snapshots are taken are significantly different from those of the runs including AGN, making the DM-halo match procedure highly uncertain. Thus, we limit the identification of the AGN-hosting galaxies counterparts in the noAGN run to z < 8."

            "text": "Fig. 4 presents the evolution of the column density for bright AGN in the AGNcone and AGNsphere simulations. Considering the AGNcone simulation, the AGN column densities are similar to, or slightly lower than, those derived for the corresponding galaxies in the noAGN run until the AGN accretion rate reaches M\u0307 \u2248 10 \u2212 30 M yr\u22121. This happens at z \u2248 7 for C1 and C2, and z \u2248 6.3 for C3 (see Fig. 2). At later times, the AGN column density drops significantly by up to \u2248 1 dex and the accretion rate starts to oscillate. The 10% and 90% percentiles span up to one order of magnitude, especially at z = 6 \u2212 7, when the accretion rates reach the maximum values, producing the most powerful conical outflows.\nInstead, the column densities of the corresponding galaxies in noAGN (grey stripes in Fig. 4) keep on increasing relatively smoothly. This finding confirms the AGN NH drop and the presence of unobscured LOSs to the effect of the conical kinetic feedback. At low accretion rates the produced\n2 The exact threshold is adjusted at each time step in order to find at least one halo counterpart.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\n4\noutflow cannot stop the infall of material, but once the accretion rate reaches high enough values, the energy carried by the outflow impacts a significant part of the gas in the halo, hindering further infalling, especially along the conical outflow directions. As a result, the NH decreases, as well as the AGN accretion rate, until more material is allowed to accrete, producing a new burst of powerful feedback. Such a cyclic activity explains the decreasing median NH , the wider NH distribution, and the oscillating M\u0307 behaviour at later cosmic times. This result is in qualitative agreement with the self-regulation scenario discussed by, e.g., Sijacki et al. (2009); Dubois et al. (2013); Costa et al. (2014); Feng et al. (2014); Richardson et al. (2016); Trebitsch et al. (2019), according to which the AGN feedback controls the growth of the black hole and limits the duration of high accretion episodes by emptying the host galaxy gas reservoir, provided that the accretion rate is sufficiently high.\nHowever, we note that the physical interpretation of our results is complicated by the effect that one AGN may have\non other AGN-hosting galaxies passing through its feedback cone. In fact, C1, C2, and C3 in AGNcone at z < 7 are always closer than 30 kpc, and reach minimum distances as small as 4 kpc. At these distances, powerful outflows launched from one AGN may affect nearby galaxies (e.g., Zana et al. accepted).\nAs an example of the feedback effect on the column density, in Fig. 3, we compare the NH map centred on C1 with the radial velocity map of all particle within 10 kpc from C1. The maps correspond to z = 7.1, when C1 reaches a local maximum in accretion rate before the strong AGN feedback starts to impact significantly the NH (Fig. 4) and M\u0307 starts to oscillate. Comparing the column density map (upper panel) with the map of the radial velocity of individual particles (lower panel), we notice that the two conical outflows, identified as regions with positive radial velocities, correspond to LOSs with low column densities. Such LOSs are those along which high-redshift AGN are more easily to be detected in the rest-frame UV band, as we investigate in details in \u00a7 4.3. Fig. 5 presents the fraction of LOSs along which\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\nFeedback effect on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN 5\nNH < 10 22 cm\u22122 (solid lines) and NH < 10 23 cm\u22122 (dashed lines) for each bright AGN. Hereafter, we use the widely used threshold NH = 10\n22 cm\u22122 to separate obscured and unobscured AGN.3 For instance, Merloni et al. (2014) found that such a value returns the best agreement between samples of obscured AGN as defined in optical (e.g., narrow emissionline AGN) and X-ray bands. From Fig. 5 we infer that only at z . 7 a fraction of the LOSs would appear as unobscured. In particular, at z . 7 C1 presents unobscured LOSs over\n3 However, we note that we consider the dust extinction as a more relevant quantity when we study the AGN rest-frame UV emission in \u00a7 4.3.\n10 \u2212 40% of the solid angle, while this fraction is much more variable with redshift (i.e., 0 \u2212 80%) for C2 and C3.\nThe most massive BH in the AGNsphere simulation, S1, follows a somewhat similar NH evolution to that of the AGN in AGNcone: a roughly constant median NH value up to z \u2248 7 followed by a slightly decreasing and wider NH distribution (Fig. 4), and the appearance of unobscured LOSs (Fig. 5) at later cosmic times. However, some differences exist: first, the AGN NH is always significant lower than that of the corresponding galaxy in the noAGN run (grey stripe), even at z > 7. Secondly, the column density drop at z < 7 is not as strong as in the AGNcone case. Finally, at z > 7 the accretion rate of S1 is not as smooth as in the AGNcone case,\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\n6\nand keeps on increasing even at z < 7. These differences may be due to the prescripted geometry of the kinetic feedback in the AGNsphere case, in which gas particles are accelerated in a random direction during every accretion event. Therefore, in contrast with the AGNcone case, there is no preferential direction (i.e., the equatorial plane of the conical outflow) along which material can keep on accreting undisturbed for long periods of time at z > 7. In particular, the accretion rate of S1 never exceeds \u2248 10 M yr\u22121, which is the approximate threshold after which the AGN kinetic feedback affects more evidently the NH distribution and the accretion rate of AGN in the AGNcone run.\nThe column density evolution of S2, instead, does not appear to be strongly influenced by the AGN feedback. Although the median NH is slightly lower than the values found in the noAGN case, it remains constant with time, and does not drop even at z < 6.5, when S2 reaches similar accretion rate to S1. As a result, S2 would never appear as an unob-\nscured AGN. We note that the typical column density of S2 is a factor \u2248 3 higher than that of S1 at any redshift, and its accretion rate rises smoothly from z = 7 to z = 6. These properties suggest that higher accretion rates than the values reached by S2 are required in order to launch outflows powerful enough to sweep away the gas in the case of large column densities (e.g., Trebitsch et al. 2019), even when kinetic energy is distributed along random directions by the AGN feedback.\nThe median values of NH we derive from the Barai et al. (2018) simulations are consistent with typical values found by Lupi et al. (2022). However, the resolution of that work is \u00d785 higher than our simulations, and allows the authors to sample compact regions of dense gas with NH & 1024 cm\u22122, especially at z > 8, when AGN feedback has not yet affected significantly the ISM distribution and density in the host galaxies. One of the main methodological differences with that work is that we compare the ISM densities in the same\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\nFeedback effect on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN 7\ngalaxies in which SMBHs are actively accreting or are not seeded at all.

Low and moderate values of column densities (NH . 1022 cm\u22122) can absorb soft X-ray photons (rest-frame energies . 2\nkeV), whereas larger column densities are required to absorb a high fraction of more energetic photons. However, X-ray observations of high-redshift QSOs (e.g. Vito et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2021b) sample rest-frame energies E > 3 keV, and are thus sensitive only to high column densities (NH & 3\u00d71023 cm\u22122), at least at the sentivities of currently available facilities. Moreover, all of the known z > 6 QSOs have been selected based on their unobscured rest-frame UV emission (i.e., they are optically classified as type 1 QSOs), and thus are not expected to be heavily obscured in the Xray band. For these reasons, existing X-ray observations of bright z > 6 QSOs provide us with only loose upper limits of NH . The downward-pointing red arrows in Fig. 4 are the observed upper limits on NH derived for a sample of z > 6 QSOs by Nanni et al. 2017 and Connor et al. 2019, with typical luminosities Lbol = 10\n46 \u2212 1047 erg s\u22121. The column densities derived for bright AGN in all of the considered simulations are lower than, or consistent with, such loose upper limits. Although the NH values found for the noAGN case are typically higher, they are still consistent with some measured upper limits. Therefore, the constraints on NH ob-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\n8 tained from X-ray observations of high-redshift QSOs only marginally favour the presence of kinetic feedback.\nWe note that constraining AGN obscuration using X-ray observations requires an assumption on gas metallicity, as Xray photons are mainly absorbed by metal atoms. Typically, solar metallicity is assumed, whereas the ISM metallicity of the host galaxies of the AGN in the B18 simulations is subsolar (e.g., by factors of \u2248 2 \u2212 3 at z = 6; e.g., Zana et al. in prep.). This consideration reinforces the overall consistency between the NH values constrained from X-ray observations and found in the simulations, as significantly larger column densities would be required in the case of sub-solar metallicities to produce X-ray obscuration in excess to that observed in real QSOs. In \u00a7 5 we discuss the X-ray detectability of the QSOs in the simulations."

            "text": "We investigate the effect of kinetic feedback on the observable sizes of the gas reservoirs in high-redshift QSOs. From the radial distribution of NH derived for each LOS in \u00a7 2, we computed the radius from the centre of the galaxy which includes 90% of the gas contributing to the total NH . Then, for each galaxy, we computed the median value considering all of the 1000 LOSs, and define it as R90. We use such a quantity to quantify the size of the gas reservoir in a galaxy.\nFig. 6 presents R90 as a function of redshift for every bright AGN in the AGNcone and AGNsphere simulations, as well as for the matched galaxies in the noAGN runs. All of the bright AGN in the AGNcone simulation (C1, C2, C3) have a similar evolution of R90: their gas reservoir sizes are constant (\u2248 1 kpc) at z & 7. At lower redshift, where NH decreases due to strong effect of the kinetic feedback, which is proportional to M\u0307 and Lbol (see the color-code of the circles in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6), R90 increases up to several kpc. This behaviour is expected considering that the AGN feedback applies a mechanical push to the surrounding gas particles. In fact, the size of the gas reservoir in the noAGN run, where the AGN feedback lacks (grey dashed lines in Fig. 6), remains constant or tends to even decrease at later cosmic times.\nThe evolution of R90 for S1 in the AGNsphere simulation is similar to that of the AGN in the AGNcone simulation. However, the increase of R90 is stronger and begins at earlier cosmic times. We recall that the accretion rate of S1 is typically lower than that of the AGN in AGNcone (see Fig. 2), and therefore the stronger evolution of R90 is not due to intrinsically stronger outflows launched by the AGN, but, as discussed in \u00a7 3, to the different geometry of the outflow: being launched along random directions at every accretion event, the outflow is more likely to transmit the kinetic energy to the gas particles in the galaxy even at low or moderate accretion rates. Instead, S2 does not follow the same evolution as S1. On the contrary, R90 decreases to sub kpc values approaching z = 6. As discussed in \u00a7 3 we ascribe this behaviour to the relatively low accretion rate, which does not produce feedback strong enough to efficiently affect the gas distribution in the host galaxy.\nWe compare our findings with the observed extent of the [C II] emission of 25 z > 6 QSOs presented by Venemans et al. (2020), assuming that the [C II] emission line is a good tracer of the spatial extent of the total gas reservoir (e.g., Zanella et al. 2018; Sommovigo et al. 2021). We used the major axis\nof the deconvolved [C II] emission size (Tab. 3 of Venemans et al. 2020), which represents the FWHM of the emitting source, and converted it into the radius that includes 90% of the [C II] light, assuming a Gaussian distribution.4 The resulting values are reported in Fig. 6) as black ticks at the redshift of each QSO.\nThe AGN in the AGNcone simulation have R90 consistent with the observed values, while the median gas size of S1 is larger at nearly every redshift. S2 have a size consistent with the most compact QSOs in the Venemans et al. (2020) sample. However, this comparison is not fair: the ISM in S2 produces very large column densities at all redshifts and all LOSs (Fig. 4), and thus large expected values of dust extinction. All of the QSOs studied in Venemans et al. (2020) are instead rest-frame UV selected objects: we lack observational information about the extent of the gas reservoirs of buried high-redshift QSOs, as is S2. In all cases, the median gas size of the noAGN control galaxies are smaller than the observed values for QSOs, suggesting that kinetic feedback is required to produce the gas extents observed in real QSOs."

In this section, we compare the expected rest-frame UV magnitudes of bright AGN in the simulations with the observed values of known z > 6 QSOs.\nWe assumed that the intrinsic (i.e., unextincted) rest-frame UV spectra of the AGN-hosting galaxies in the simulations are dominated by the AGN (i.e., we do not include stellar emission) and are well represented by the Vanden Berk et al.

Thus, we obtain a distribution of 1000 values of m1450 at every redshift. In Fig. 7 we show the magnitudes obtained for the 50% least (purple regions) and most (grey hatched regions) extincted LOSs. To allow for a comparison with observations, we add the magnitudes of a sample of z > 6 QSOs collected from Ban\u0303ados et al. (2016, 2018), Chehade et al. (2018), Matsuoka et al.

(2020a,b), with typical magnitudes of 19 . m1450 . 24.\nAmong the considered simulations, AGNcone produces the UV brightest AGN, which are consistent with the magnitudes of known QSOs at z . 7. As discussed in \u00a7 3, such redshift range corresponds to the period when the AGN strong kinetic feedback strongly affects the gas column density in the host galaxy, strongly suggesting that known, optically selected z > 6 AGN are indeed observed preferentially along directions where AGN feedback has cleared the LOS of most of the gas and dust. This prediction is hard to be tested ob-\nservationally. Not only estimating the outflow direction is a difficult task, but the incidence of outflow in high-redshift AGN itself is still a matter of debate (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al. 2015; Bischetti et al. 2019; Novak et al. 2020; Izumi et al. 2021; Meyer et al. 2022). Moreover, z > 6 QSOs might have been detected along LOSs which have been previously cleared of most of the gas and dust by past outflows. In this respect, a caveat arises from the numerical implementation of the ISM properties in the Barai et al. (2018) simulations, which, as described in \u00a7 2.1, follow the prescription of Springel & Hernquist (2003). This model does not capture the ISM porosity and therefore is not able to resolve clumpy structures on pc scales. Resolving such structures might decrease the effective opacity of the medium and possibly produce more unobscured lines of sight, even in the absence of AGN feedback.\nIn Fig. 7, only < 50% of the LOSs of an individual AGN have extinction values small enough to reproduce the observed magnitudes. We computed the probability that multiple AGN appear as UV bright (i.e., m1450 . 24) sources\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\n10\nalong the same LOS, and found that it is negligible. This result is consistent with observations, according to which, to date, no such a system of multiple UV-bright AGN has been discovered at high redshift.\nThe most luminous AGN in the AGNsphere run, S1, reaches magnitudes as bright as the observed values only at z \u2248 6.5, while it fails at reproducing the magnitudes of z > 6.5 QSOs. This is due to the lower accretion rate, and thus lower intrinsic luminosity, of S1 than the accretion rates of bright AGN in AGNcone. The large column density of S2 results in dramatic extinction levels along all of the LOSs, such that only along a small fraction of the LOSs S2 has apparent magnitude consistent with those of observed highredshift QSOs, despite its intrinsic luminosity being similar to that of S1 at z < 6.5 (Fig. 2)."

The latter hypothesis implies that the simulations overpredict the number of bright AGN, due to, e.g., the specific numerical setup and seeding prescription.

However, we have to take into account another effect related to the specific choice of the LOS: the emission of different AGN might be blended along some LOSs due to projection effects, and appear as a single X-ray source. This effect might be important as the projected angular separations of the AGN in the considered simulations are comparable with the angular resolution of Chandra (i.e., \u2248 0.5\u2032\u2032), which is the existing X-ray observatory with the sharpest view.\nWe produce mock observations using the SOXS v. 3.0 software,6 using Chandra response matrices and ancillary files suitable for Cycle 20. SOXS accounts for three background components: a uniform Galactic component, a cosmic background due to point-like sources, and an instrumental component. For each simulation, we produce two sets of mock images, assuming an exposure time of 30 ks or 50 ks, which are typical lengths of real Chandra observations of z > 6 QSOs (e.g., Vito et al. 2019a; Wang et al. 2021b). For each set, we considered 100 random LOSs, along which all AGN have been projected on the sky plane according to their tri-dimensional positions in the simulations. This allows us to statistically take into account 1) the possible blending of multiple sources due to projection effects, and 2) the Poisson fluctuations of the number of detected X-ray photons at a given intrinsic flux.\nWe convert the bolometric luminosities of AGN in the simulations into X-ray luminosities in the rest-frame 2 \u2212 10 keV\n6 https://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/soxs/\nenergy band using the Duras et al.

(2019b) and Wang et al. (2021b) find hints for a steepening at higher redshifts.

Instead, according to the AGNsphere run, 30 ks (50 ks) Chandra observations of z & 6.2 (z & 6.5) should typically return no detected source, but the probability to detect one or more AGN increases quickly approaching z = 6.\nIn order to compare these results with real data, we collected all of the available Chandra observations of z = 6 \u2212 7 QSOs with exposure times of 20-40 ks and 40-80 ks (Tab. 1). The median exposure time of the 20-40 ks (40-80 ks) observations is 38 ks (54 ks) and the median redshift of the targeted QSOs is z = 6.4 (z = 6.5). These values are well matched to our sets of 30 ks and 50 ks mock images, respectively. We repeated the detection procedure described above on the real Chandra observations, considering only an area of R < 30 kpc from the targeted QSO, to allow for a fair comparison with the mock image results. We stress that the blind detection procedure prevents any bias related to rest-frame UV pre-selection of possible X-ray sources.\nThe last column of Tab. 1 reports the number of detected sources in the real observations,9 which are almost equally split between no detected source and one detected source (i.e., the targeted QSO): the average numbers of detected Xray sources in one observation are 0.50 and 0.56 for the 20- 30 ks and 40-80 ks samples, respectively. Similar values are obtained by splitting each sample according to its median redshift. Comparing these results with the expected numbers of detected sources in simulations (Fig. 9), we find that AGNcone overestimates the number of detectable AGN at all\n9 We note that for almost all of the QSOs considered here, the results of the blind detection procedure agree with what reported in the literature, but for J084229.43+121850.5. Vito et al. (2019b) reported a detection of X-ray emission from this QSO, while here we report it as undetected.

Instead, AGNsphere underestimates such number assuming 30 ks observations, while shows a strong dependence on redshift for longer exposures: at z > 6.5 and z < 6.5 it underestimates and overestimates, respectively, the average number of detected X-ray sources.\nDue to the small sample sizes of real QSO observations and the narrow range covered by the number of detectable X-ray sources, it is difficult to provide a quantitatively robust comparison with the predictions from simulations. Nonetheless, we attempt to do it by comparing the normalized histograms of detected sources in the mock and real observations over the entire z = 6 \u2212 7 range (Fig. 10). This is justified by the relatively flat redshift distribution of the QSOs targeted by real observations (Tab. 1). For each set of mock images, we computed the two-sample Anderson-Darling test.10 The null hypothesis is that the mock and real observations are drawn from the same parent population, for what the number of detected X-ray sources is concern. We found that the null hypothesis can be rejected with high significance (i.e., Anderson-Darling test sigificance level . 0.001) for almost all combinations of simulations and exposure times: Fig. 10 confirms that AGNcone and AGNsphere overestimate and underestimate, respectively, the number of detectable X-ray sources. Mock simulations of AGNsphere with texp = 50 ks is the only set for which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, although this simulation is not consistent with real observations for texp = 30 ks. It is worth noting that few z > 6 QSOs have been pointed with long Chandra exposures (100\u2013500 ks; e.g. Nanni et al. 2018, Connor et al. 2020, Vito et al. 2021). Some of these observations were performed to check the presence of faint and possibly obscured AGN around z > 6 QSOs, for which companion galaxies have been detected with ALMA and HST.

In particular, the AGNcone simulation does not assume the outflow to be perpendicular to the plane of the host galaxy, as suggested by several observations of kpc-scale outflows or radio jets in the local universe (e.g., Garc\u0301\u0131a-Burillo et al. 2014; Cresci et al. 2015; Morganti et al. 2015; Venturi et al. 2021), where the outflow geometry can be studied in details, and by some numerical simulations (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2012).\nSeveral physical mechanisms can concur in the acceleration of winds at sub-pc scales that eventually produce largescale outflows, including magneto-hydrodynamic effect (e.g., Sadowski et al. 2013), thermal driving (e.g., Proga 2007), radiation pressure acceleration, either applied on dust (e.g., Ishibashi & Fabian 2015) or mediated by UV transitions (e.g. Proga & Kallman 2004; Mizumoto et al. 2021), which might produce outflows with different geometries. Moreover, the outflow geometry might be affected by interactions with the surrounding environment as the outflow expands (e.g. Nelson et al. 2019; Talbot et al. 2021), and might change with time. Cosmological simulations cannot describe in detail such a complex, and largely unknown, physics and evolution of outflows with relatively simple numerical recipes.\nThe goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of two particular large-scale outflow geometries (i.e., a spherical outflow and a bi-conical outflow parametrized as described in \u00a7 2.1) on the observable properties of high-redshift AGN, regardless of the sub-grid physical mechanisms responsible for their acceleration. Extensive numerical simulations with identical initial conditions and physics except for the outflow parameters would be required to check whether and how the results are sensitive to different choices of the outflow parameters.\nKinetic feedback produced during the phases of fast accretion of SMBHs in the Barai et al. (2018) simulations has a significant impact on the surrounding material and is required to match the predicted observable properties of bright AGN with observational results. One of the strongest piece of evidence is represented by the study of the gas extent in the AGN host galaxies (Fig. 6): the gas reservoirs in the noAGN case (i.e., in absence of AGN feedback) are always more compact than those derived from ALMA observations of z > 6 QSOs (see also, e.g., van der Vlugt & Costa 2019). The effect of AGN feedback pushes the gas in the host galaxies to larger distances (i.e., up to a few kpc) from the centres, in agreement with observations (e.g., Cicone et al. 2015; Bischetti et al. 2019; Venemans et al. 2020; Izumi et al. 2021). Although other mechanisms related to AGN feedback may produce such an observable, by, for instance, preventing gas infall from large scales (e.g., Trussler et al. 2020) or causing\nfluctuations in the gravitational potential, which may lead to a radial migration of the material (e.g., van der Vlugt & Costa 2019), Barai et al. (2018) found that the mechanical removal of gas from the inner region of the host galaxies is the main process that affects their gas content in their simulations. We underline that also some 5 < z < 7 star-forming (1 \u2212 70 M yr\u22121) galaxies have been found to show both an extended [C II] halo (e.g., Fujimoto et al. 2020) and broad wings in the [C II] emission-line profile (e.g., Gallerani et al. 2018; Ginolfi et al. 2020), suggestive of outflows possibly powered by a yet undetected accreting MBH (e.g., Orofino et al. 2021).\nAt z < 7 the feedback produces a general decrease of the NH (Fig. 4), allowing for the appearance of unobscured (i.e., NH < 10\n22 cm\u22122) LOSs (Fig. 5). Such directions are most probably those along which known z > 6 QSOs are preferentially observed, as the rest-frame UV selection of these objects requires low dust extinction. In fact, at z . 6.5, when the feedback effect is the strongest, bright AGN in the AGNcone simulation are able to reach the UV magnitudes observed for known z > 6 QSOs (Fig. 7). However, such LOSs represent only a fraction of the total LOSs of an AGN (see also, e.g., Ni et al. 2020; Trebitsch et al. 2019; Lupi et al. 2022): more than half of the LOSs would appear too faint to be selected as high-redshift objects in current optical/near-IR surveys, suggesting that a large fraction of the high-redshift, intrinsically luminous QSO population is observationally missed due to strong UV extinction produced by the ISM only. The presence of a dusty torus on pc scales, which is not included in the simulations we have analysed, would further increase such a fraction.\nThe outflow geometry likely plays an important role: in the case of a conic outflow, SMBH accretion proceeds at maximum efficiency through equatorial infalling of gas until M\u0307 \u2248 10\u221230 M yr\u22121 (Fig. 2), producing BHs with masses of > 109 M at z = 6 \u2212 7 (Fig. 1). At these accretion rates, the feedback regulates further accretion and reduces the typical obscuring column density, in particular along the cone direction (Fig. 3). In the case of outflows launched along random directions, the feedback can affect the growth of the SMBH and the NH distribution even at lower accretion rates, resulting in < 109 M BHs at z = 6, provided that the gas in the host galaxy is not too dense, as in the case of S2. Thus, the ISM properties (i.e., NH and radial size of the gas) of the brightest AGN in the AGNsphere run is in agreement with observations. However, hindering the formation of > 109 M BHs, the spherical geometry of the feedback in AGNsphere prevents AGN from reaching intrinsic luminosities comparable to known z > 6 QSOs at most redshifts (Fig. 7).\nInterestingly, even the most luminous AGN in AGNcone cannot explain the detection of UV-bright QSOs at z \u2248 7.5 (Fig. 7), due to the combination of the relatively small BH masses, and hence low accretion rates, which, by construction, are capped at the Eddington rate, and typically highNH at that early cosmic time in this simulation. The existence of bright QSOs at z \u2248 7.5 (e.g., Ban\u0303ados et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2021b) requires different physical conditions for the SMBH formation and mass growth from those adopted in the considered simulations.12 Future numerical simulations may\n12 As mentioned in \u00a7 2.2, cosmic variance may affect our conclu-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\nFeedback effect on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN 15\nexplore such conditions as viable ways to reconcile the expected and observed properties of z > 7 AGN. Non-mutually exclusive possibilities are: (a) different BH seeding mechanisms, that is, bright and massive QSOs discovered at z \u2248 7.5 may be grown from more massive BH seeds or have been seeded at earlier redshift than the SMBHs in the simulations. (b) Sustained periods of super-Eddington accretion at z > 7.5, whereas in the simulations the SMBH accretion rate is capped at the Eddington limit. (c) Mass accretion characterized by a lower radiative efficiency than the value used in the simulations (i.e., r = 0.1). In this case, the mass that is not converted into radiation contributes to the growth of SMBH, which can reach higher masses than those found in simulations at a given time. For instance, Davies et al. (2019) report observational evidence for possible low radiation efficiency ( r \u2248 0.001) in highredshift QSOs. (d) High-redshift AGN typically reside in regions which are even more overdense than that investigated in the Barai et al. (2018) simulations, thus favouring the formation of SMBHs at earlier epochs. However, this possibility would arguably make the discrepancy between the observed and expected number of multiple X-ray detected AGN on small scales even worse. In addition, observational studies return contradictory results on the typical large-scale environment of high-redshift\nsions, as the simulations focus on a single cosmic region at high redshift.\nAGN (e.g., Ota et al. 2018; Mazzucchelli et al. 2019; Mignoli et al. 2020; Overzier 2021).\nThe analysis that we have performed demonstrates that the comparison between several observable properties of AGN predicted by the Barai et al. (2018) simulations and the observational results, including both the properties of the individual galaxies and the environment, can help us to validate the recipes and assumptions adopted in numerical simulations. In particular, we found that AGN in the considered simulations match the gas radial distributions and apparent UV magnitudes of high-redshift QSOs. In addition, the same set of simulations has been demonstrated to reproduce well a number of physical properties of z > 6 QSOs, such as dust properties (Di Mascia et al. 2021b), multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (Di Mascia et al. 2021a), and the number of UV-detected and [C II]-detected satellite galaxies (Zana et al. accepted).\nHowever, we also found that the predicted number of X-ray detectable satellite AGN located over small scales around luminous high-redshift QSOs both in the AGNcone and AGNsphere simulations does not agree with the observational results. This observable is relatively easy to estimate from simulations as it depends primarily on the BH accretion rate only, once a suitable conversion to X-ray luminosity is assumed. Moreover, gas and dust absorption does not affect significantly the observed X-ray emission from high-redshift AGN, as opposed to UV emission, up to high column densities (log NH\ncm\u22122 \u2248 23.5 \u2212 24.0; see \u00a7 4.1 and \u00a7 4.3). The mismatch between the number of multiple X-ray detected AGN on small scales between simulations and observations may be related to numerical issues and physical pre-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\n16\nscriptions. In particular, the simplistic BH seeding recipe implemented in the considered simulations (i.e., a 105 M BH is placed in the centre of a galaxy when this reaches a given mass threshold) naturally leads to the formation of a large number of SMBHs, that would appear as bright AGN at later cosmic times. Similar seeding recipies have been commonly adopted by most cosmological simulations (e.g., Costa et al. 2014, Di Matteo et al. 2017, Barai et al. 2018, Smidt et al. 2018, Lupi et al. 2019, Valentini et al. 2021), and typically mimic the \u201cheavy seed\u201d formation channel for SMBHs (e.g., Lodato & Natarajan 2006; Ferrara et al. 2014). However, theoretical models of \u201cheavy seed\u201d formation require stringent physical conditions on, e.g., metallicity, physical state of the gas, ad radiation fields (e.g., Ferrara et al. 2014). Accounting for such conditions in cosmological simulations is particularly difficult, but would reduce the number of formed SMBHs, and thus the discrepancy with observational results.\nAnother possibility is that observed QSOs at high redshift do not reside in regions as dense as those probed in the analysed simulations (but see, e.g., Zana et al. accepted). In this case, the formation of multiple SMBHs is expected to be hindered, helping us reconcile the expected number of X-ray sources with observational results. In addition, we would also expect to form less massive BHs, with direct consequences on the observational expectations discussed in this paper, as the BH mass is tightly linked with the maximum accretion rate, and thus AGN luminosity and feedback strength. Qualitatively, we would expect to derive fainter rest-frame UV and X-ray fluxes, weaker feedback, and, as a consequence (see Fig. 6), more compact gas reservoirs (i.e., similar to the noAGN case) than the values discussed in \u00a7 4.2, \u00a7 4.3, and \u00a7 5. Future X-ray facilities will provide us with the required sensitivity and angular resolution to investigate the presence of multiple faint AGN around bright high-redshift QSOs down to unprecedented flux limits (see \u00a7 5.3)."

            "heading": "7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "We studied the observable properties of z = 6 \u2212 10 bright AGN in a suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations by Barai et al. (2018) characterized by the inclusion of AGN kinetic feedback with either bi-conical (namely, AGNcone) and spherical (AGNsphere) outflow geometry. We focused our investigation on the gas column density and size in the host galaxies, the AGN rest-frame UV magnitude and X-ray fluxes, and the detectability of systems of multiple AGN over a few kpc scale in the X-ray band. We compared these quantities with a control simulation in which SMBHs are not seeded (i.e., noAGN ), and observational results of z > 6 AGN. We summarize our findings as follows.\n\u2022 AGNcone produces three bright AGN that grow up to 5 \u00d7 108 < MBH < 5 \u00d7 109 M at z = 6. These objects are characterized by a steady increase of their accretion rate up to \u2248 10\u221230 M yr\u22121. Once such high values are reached (at z \u2248 6.5 \u2212 7), the strong AGN feedback prevents further increase of the accretion rate. This behaviour is linked with the biconical geometry of the outflow, that allows steady infalling of material along the equatorial directions, at least until the feedback grows strong enough to affect most of the gas in the galaxy halo. In AGNsphere, the spherical geometry of the outflow affects gas accretion already at low and moderate\nSMBH growth rate. For this reason, the two bright AGN produced in AGNsphere reach lower values of BH masses (i.e., 2 \u00d7 108 < MBH < 5 \u00d7 108 M ) and accretion rates (M\u0307 < 10 M yr \u22121) than objects in AGNcone.\n\u2022 AGN host galaxies in AGNsphere have gas column densities ofNH \u2248 1023 cm\u22122 from their formation up to z = 6.5\u22127, when NH presents a remarkable drop due to the strong AGN feedback. In fact, the NH in matched galaxies in noAGN continues to increase during the entire considered redshift range. The brightest AGN in AGNsphere presents a similar behaviour as those in AGNcone, although the NH is typically slightly lower. We interpret this difference again as due to the assumed spherical symmetry of the outflow. Instead, the second bright AGN in AGNsphere do not reach accretion rate sufficiently high to significantly affect the gas in the host galaxy. Our findings are consistent with the upper limits on NH recently reported for a set of z > 6 AGN observed in the X-rays.\n\u2022 Kinetic feedback is required to match the gas extent reported for high-redshift QSOs (i.e., up to a few kpc). In fact, galaxies in noAGN present typical gas sizes of < 1 kpc, while the extents of the gas reservoirs of AGN in AGNcone and AGNsphere increase up to the observed values of a few kpc at z . 7. The exception is the second bright AGN in AGNsphere, due to its relatively low values of accretion rate.\n\u2022 All AGN in the simulations would appear as obscured (i.e., NH > 10\n22 cm\u22122) along all lines of sight (LOSs) at z > 7. These objects would be missed by currently employed UV-based selection methods, which are heavily affected by dust extiction, and would require observations in different bands (e.g., X-ray or infrared) to be unveiled. At later cosmic times, a fraction of LOSs (up to \u2248 80%, depending on the specific AGN and redshift) have NH < 10\n22 cm\u22122. These are the preferential directions along which known, UV-selected z > 6 QSOs are observed.\n\u2022 Under simple, but reasonable, assumptions on the gasto-dust mass scaling and dust distribution, we estimate the apparent UV magnitudes (m1450) of the AGN in the simulations along different LOSs. We found that AGN in AGNcone have m1450 consistent with those observed for real highredshift QSOs (i.e., m1450 < 25) along . 50% of the LOSs at z < 7. AGN in AGNsphere, instead, have fainter magnitudes, due to the lower instrinsic luminosities, and, for the second AGN, the high extinction levels along most of the LOSs. No AGN in the simulations can reproduce the observed UV magnitudes of the few z \u2248 7.5 QSOs known to date, whose formation and accretion history are likely not well captured by the prescriptions assumed in the simulations.\n\u2022 The presence of multiple bright AGN over scales of a few kpc led us to investigate their detectability in X-ray observations with Chandra, and to compare the results with real observations of z > 6 QSOs. We found that the AGNcone run significantly overpredicts the number of X-ray detected multiple AGN at high redshift. Instead, AGNsphere produces AGN with lower rate of X-ray detection than typical values derived in relatively shallow (i.e., 30 ks) observations, while it is consistent with the results obtained with longer (i.e., 50 ks) observations.\nThese results demonstrate that the AGN in the considered simulations have physical properties consistent with those of real QSOs for what the column density and extent of the gas\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201318 (2020)\nFeedback effect on the observable properties of z > 6 AGN 17\nin the host galaxies and the UV magnitudes are concerned. A bi-conical geometry for the outflow is favored over a spherical geometry, as it reproduces AGN with the high luminosities and SMBH masses observed for z = 6 \u2212 7 QSOs. However, both simulations cannot explain the recent discovery of luminous QSOs at z \u2248 7.5, which may have been formed at higher redshift than the assumed seeding time in our simulations, or may have undergone extensive periods of super-Eddington accretion.\nMoreover, we showed that the number of multiple AGN detectable in X-ray band over few kpc scales is the observable property that the considered simulations struggled the most to reproduce. We propose that this issue can be due to the simplistic BH seeding methods generally implemented in cosmological simulations, that do not account for the complex physics related with the formation and rapid growth of massive BHs in the early Universe. Future X-ray observatories will provide us with the sensitivity required to investigate the possible presence of multiple faint AGN satellites around luminous QSOs at high redshift."
