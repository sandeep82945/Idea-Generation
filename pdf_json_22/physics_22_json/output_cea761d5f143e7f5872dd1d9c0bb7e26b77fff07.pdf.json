INTRODUCTION\nSince the discovery of quantum Hall effect1\u20134, the topological phase of matter has attracted extensive attention. Although the topological phase of matter is first found in electronic systems, it is later extended to the field of quasi-particles, such as phonons5, photons6,7 and even magnons8, etc. Katsura et al.9 theoretically predicted the thermal Hall effect of magnons. Subsequently, Onose et al.8 experimentally confirms the existence of magnon Hall effect in Lu2V2O7 with pyrochlore structure, which sets off an upsurge of studying the topological properties of magnons. So far, various non-trivial topological phases of magnons for different crystal structures and magnetic interactions had been presented. In two-dimensional (2D) system, it is found that the anisotropic magnetic interaction, such as the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction10\u201312, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)13\u201316 and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI)17,18 rather than the isotropic magnetic interaction (Heisenberg-type exchange interaction), usually produce the non-trivial topological phase of magnon in different types of lattices, e.g. honeycomb lattice, Kagome lattice and triangular lattice, etc. These anisotropic interactions often open an energy gap and lead to topological magnon insulator, and can be seen as effective spin-orbit couplings in electronic topological insulator. Due to the inherent topological protection, the topological magnons generally have a wider application prospect than the traditional ones. Due to the abundance of magnetic materials and magnetic structures19, as well as the manipulation of various magnetic interactions, magnons have become an important platform for topological physics and quantum technology20,21. As a consequence, it has great potential application for designing novel quantum devices in magnonics22,23.\nAs we know, there also are abundant topological phases in one-dimensional (1D) electronic systems, e.g. Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and Kitaev chain, etc. Indeed unlike electrons, the magnon topological phases are easier to be realized by regulating magnetic interactions. Although the 2D magnons are extensively studied in previous years and numerous topological magnon states (e.g. magnonic topological insulator, magnonic topological semimetal with Dirac or Weyl magnon, etc.) are discovered, the topological properties of magnons in 1D system remain unclear. We can expect more abundant topological phases in 1D magnon systems than in electronic systems due to the rich regulation of magnetic interactions. We notice that recently Pirmoradian et al.12 constructed a 1D magnetosphere\nchain24, in which there is only dipole-dipole interaction rather than Heisenberg-type interaction between macrospins on the magnetospheres, and they discovered topological magnons by manipulating the external magnetic field. As a matter of fact, the magnetosphere chain they studied is a classical magnetic macrosystem. However, the mechanism to induce intrinsic topological magnons without external field is still lacking, especially the topological properties in the lattice model of the realistic magnetic materials is deserved to explore.\nIn this paper, here we investigate the possible magnonic topological phases and the related topological phase transitions in a 1D ferromagnetic (FM) SSH model by manipulating both the isotropic Heisenberg exchange interaction and the anisotropic exchange interactions, including DMI and PDI. To characterize the topological phase, we adopt the Zak phase for the infinite system and the real-space topological number for the finite system, respectively. We first investigate the pure Heisenberg-type interaction, and find that the topological phase can be realized by adjusting the ratio of intracellular interaction J1 and intercellular interaction J2, i.e. J2/J1. This result is very different from that in the 2D honeycomb ferromagnet, in which there is no topological phase transition for only isotropic Heisenberg-type interaction. Moreover, the introduction of anisotropic interactions, i.e. DMI (intracellular interaction D1 and intercellular interaction D2) and PDI (intracellular interaction F1 and intercellular interaction F2), also plays an important role in the realization of the topological phases. We demonstrate that the intercellular interactions (J2, D2, and F2) favor topological non-trivial phase, while the intracellular interactions (J1, D1, and F1) hinder it, in the 1D FM SSH model. This paper is organized as follows: the theoretical model and method are introduced in Sec. II; the numerical results and discussions are presented in Sec. III; and the last section is the remarks and conclusions."

            "text": "Analogous to the electronic SSH model24, as shown in Fig. 1(a), we construct a 1D FM SSH model including the intracellular and intercellular interactions, i.e. J1 and J2, which presents a pure Heisenberg-type model. In general, there are two types of FM ground states, that is, the spin orientation is perpendicular to or along the direction of the 1D chain, as shown in Fig. 1(c), and thus these two quantization axes are considered, respectively.\nThe Hamiltonian of the 1D spin chain with anisotropic exchange interactions can be\nwritten as\nH = H0 +HAE +HDM +HPD. (1)\nH0 is the Heisenberg exchange interaction, reading\nH0 = \u2212J1 N \u2211\ni=1\nSi,A \u00b7Si,B \u2212 J2 N\u22121 \u2211\ni=1\nSi,B \u00b7Si+1,A, (2)\nwhere J1 and J2 represent the exchange interaction in the unit cell (intracellular) and between the two unit cells (intercellular), respectively. And HAE = \u221212 \u2211 iKi(S z i ) 2 is the easyaxial anisotropy term for the quantization z-axis, where Ki is the axial anisotropy energy (Ki=10J1 is used for all the calculations). HDM denotes the DMI term 25,26, originating from the spin-orbit coupling, while HPD represents the PDI 27,28, mainly contributed from both the strong spin-orbit coupling and the orbital degree of freedom.\nThe DMI and PDI are covered by the following forms:\nHDM = D1 \u00b7 \u2211\ni\n(Si,A \u00d7 Si,B) (3)\n+D2 \u00b7 \u2211\ni,i+1\n(Si,B \u00d7 Si+1,A) ,\nHPD = \u2212F1 N \u2211\ni=1\n(Si,A \u00b7 ei,AB) (Si,B \u00b7 ei,AB) (4)\n\u2212F2 N\u22121 \u2211\ni=1\n(Si,B \u00b7 ei,i+1,BA) (Si+1,A \u00b7 ei,i+1,BA),\nwhere D1 (F1) and D2 (F2) represent intracellular and intercellular nearest neighbor DMIs (PDIs), respectively. ei,AB is the unit vector between lattice sites A and B in the i-th unit cell, and ei,i+1,BA is the unit vector between lattice site B of the i-th unit cell and lattice site A of the (i+ 1)-th unit cell. ei,AB and ei,i+1,BA point in the direction of the chain.\nWe firstly analyze the magnetic ground state before calculating the magnon spectrum. The Heisenberg term with \u2212J < 0 favors the FM state, and the easy-axial anisotropy term with Kz tends to align the spins parallel along the z axis. However, in the presence of anisotropic magnetic exchange interactions, the nearest-neighboring DMI and PDI, the magnetic ground state may change. In the classical spin limit, the derivation process with respect to the spin canting angles29 is performed to obtain the minimal energy of the total Hamiltonian H (Eq.(1)). Two possible ground states are found to be the FM states along zaxis and x-axis with the total energies per unit cell \u2212(J1+J2)\u2212K and \u2212(J1+J2)\u2212(F1+F2), respectively. Hence the phase boundary is K = F1 + F2, that is, when K > F1 + F2, it is FM state with spins oriented along the z axis (z-FM phase), otherwise, it is FM state with the spins oriented along the x axis (x-FM phase). Through the analysis of the total energy, it is found that the component of the DMI Dz, will not affect the z-FM phase because it does not contribute to the total energy. While the PDI F > 0 prefers each pair of spins to be parallel to the bond between them (x axis), so it can change the magnetic ground state. Note that all the parameter values used (K = 10J1, F = J1, 0 < F2/F1 \u2264 5, for the convenience of theoretical analysis) fall into the z-FM phase, even for the large values of Dz or F .\nBy the linear Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation30 with bosonic generation (annihilation) operator (for A sublattice, a\u2020 (a); for B sublattice, b\u2020 (b)), the Hamiltonian of magnon in momentum k-space can be expressed as H = 1 2 \u2211 k \u03a8 \u2020 kHk\u03a8k, where \u03a8k = (\nak, a \u2020 \u2212k, bk, b \u2020 \u2212k\n)T\n. Using the linear HP transformation, the spin operators for the A (or B)\nsublattice are given by \n    \n    \nS\u2020A = \u221a 2Sa S\u2212A = \u221a 2Sa\u2020 SzA = S \u2212 a\u2020a.\nBy the Bogoliubov transformation31, we can diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian and obtain the energy spectrum of the magnon. The magnon Hamiltonian Hk satisfies the generalized eigenvalue problem32,\n\u03b7Hk\u0393k = \u0393k\u03b7Ek, (5)\nwhere \u0393k is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes the magnon Hamiltonian, \u03b7 is a\nmetric matrix, \u03b7 = I2\u00d72\u2297\u03c3z , I is the identity matrix, and \u03c3z =\n\n\n1 0 0 \u22121\n\n is the Pauli matrix.\nIn the generalized eigenvalue problem of boson, E(k) = \u2212E(\u2212k) is artificially introduced. As a result, we only need to consider the non\u2212negative eigenvalues of the energy spectrum. On the other hand, for a finite 1D system with N unit cells, the generalized eigenvalue problem in real space is \u03b7H\u0393 = \u0393\u03b7E, where H is the 2N \u00d7 2N real space matrix, and \u03b7 = IN\u00d7N \u2297 \u03c3z.\nAs is known that, the electronic 1D SSH model possesses the chiral (\u0393), spatial (P ) and temporal (T ) inversion symmetries33 defined as \u0393H(k)\u0393\u22121 = \u2212H(k), PH(k)P\u22121 = H(\u2212k),\nTH(k)T\u22121 = H(\u2212k), respectively, in which \u0393 = I2\u00d72\u2297\u03c3z , P = I2\u00d72\u2297\u03c3x, T = I2\u00d72\u2297\n\n\n0 i i 0\n\n.\nThe chiral symmetry requires on-site energy is 0, while the spatial and temporal inversion symmetry only require the identical on-site energies34. In consequence, for the 1D FM SSH model with pure Heisenberg-type interaction, the chiral symmetry is broken, while the spatial and temporal inversion symmetries are preserved. When the anisotropic DMI and PDI exist in the system, the spatial inversion symmetry is broken while only the temporal inversion symmetry is preserved. Consequentially, the 1D FM SSH model of magnons has no direct correspondence to the electronic systems because of the different symmetries; thus, the topological magnons of the magnetic SSH model are not superficial extensions of the electronic SSH system. The most important difference is that the topological magnons involving anisotropic interaction features do not have direct correspondence to any electronic systems, though the isotropic Heisenberg term (J1 and J2) corresponds to the electronic\ninteractions (t1 and t2). In addition, it should be pointed out that the change of quantization axis does not affect the symmetry of the system.\nFor a 1D infinite system, Zak phase35 is often used to describe its topological properties\nwithin the momentum k-space,\n\u03d5Zak = \u2212i \u222b\nBZ\n\u03a8\u2020k d\ndk \u03a8kdk. (6)\nWhen \u03d5Zak is not 0, the topological phase is non-trivial, and the system has topological edge state; otherwise, the topological number is 0, and the topological phase is trivial, which means no topological edge state in the system.\nFor a 1D finite system, we extend the real-space topological number of the electronic (fermionic) version36 to the magnonic (bosonic) case. The topological number of real space NR is described as\nNR = 1\n2 Sig((X + iH)\u03b7), (7)\nwhere X is a matrix composed of rescaled coordinates consistent with the size of H . For the i-th unit cell, its reduced coordinates are Xi,j = i\u03b4ij N . Sig(Q) is equal to the number of positive eigenvalues of Q = (X + iH)\u03b7."

            "text": "A. Heisenberg-type interaction\nWe first investigate the 1D FM SSH model with only pure Heisenberg-type isotropic exchange interaction. Through the linear HP transformation mentioned above, the Heisenberg interaction term H0 can be expressed as\nH0 = (J1 + J2 +K)S \u2211\ni\n(\na\u2020iai + b \u2020 ibi\n)\n(8)\n\u2212J1S \u2211\ni\n(\naib \u2020 i + a \u2020 ibi\n)\n\u2212 J2S \u2211\ni\n(\nbia \u2020 i+1 + b \u2020 iai+1\n)\n.\nThe matrix of H0 can be seen in the Appendix.\nThe band structures dependent on the ratio J1/J2 are presented in Fig. 2(a)-(c). It is obviously found that a topological phase transition occurs at a critical ratio J1/J2=1, accompanied by an energy gap close. This is very similar to the case of the electronic 1D\nSSH model37, that is the phase transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases can be realized by regulating the ratio of the intracellular and intercellular interactions, distinctly different from that in the 2D honeycomb ferromagnet in which the topological phase transition is mainly induced by the anisotropic interaction rather than the isotropic interaction16. Notice that for the critical ratio J1/J2=1, the system exhibits a linear Diraclike dispersion, but it is trivial owning to the band accidental degeneracy. Therefore, for J1/J2 6=1, although the energy band opens a gap, it is not necessarily topologically non-trivial. It is demonstrated that the intercellular (intracellular) interaction J2 (J1) favors (unfavors) the topological non-trivial phase. Indeed, for J1 < J2 (in comparison with \u03b4t = t1 \u2212 t2 > 0 for the electronic SSH model), the magnon state is a 1D topological magnon insulator, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In addition, we note that the position of the gap close at k = \u03c0 or \u2212\u03c0 is different from that of the electronic SSH model at k = 0. Owning to the finite energy gap\nof 1D topological magnon insulator, a topologically protected edge state can be expected according to the bulk-edge correspondence38. In order to investigate the edge state of this topological magnon insulator, the energy spectrums of finite lattice sites in real space are also given, as displayed in Fig. 2(d)-(f). Accordingly, two degenerate edge states are found located within the band gap for the topological magnon insulating phase, which can be seen in Fig. 2(f).\nThrough the analysis of the real-space-resolved wave functions for the two degenerate edge states, it is found that the two edge states are separately localized at the two ends of the 1D chain, as seen in Fig. 3. In fact, this degenerate edge states can be simply lifted by introducing an inequivalence between A and B sites in the SSH model. Considering the\ntopological characteristic of this in-gap edge states, it can be regarded as zero-energy mode of magnon at finite frequency in 1D quantum magnets, which is very like the Majorana zero mode in 1D chain (nanowire) of electronic system39. It should be emphasized that the in-gap edge state as a novel type of bound state is distinctly different from the two-magnon bound state in 1D Heisenberg spin chain40.\nThe corresponding topological invariants in both the momentum k-space (Zak phase \u03d5Zak) and the real space (NR) are shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the topological number changes from 0 to 1 at the critical point J1=J2 after the energy gap is closed and reopened, indicating the phase transition process between the topological trivial and nontrivial phases. Notice that it can be seen that the topological number of k-space and real space are consistent with each other in describing the topological phase transition, implying\nour methods in calculating the topological invariants are effective.\nFor the quantization x-axis, as displayed in Fig. 1(c), the Heisenberg interaction term H \u2032\n0\ncan be rewritten as\nH \u2032 0 = (J1 + J2)S \u2211\ni\n(\na\u2020iai + b \u2020 ibi\n)\n(9)\n\u2212J1S \u2211\ni\n( a\u2020ibi + h.c. ) \u2212 J2S \u2211\ni\n( b\u2020iai+1 + h.c. )\nObviously, it is consistent with the form of the quantization z-axis which indicates that the change of the quantization axis does not affect our results for the pure Heisenberg-type interaction.\nB. In the presence of DMI\nAlthough the isotropic Heisenberg interaction can induce the topological phase in 1D spin chain, the anisotropic interactions play an essential role in topological phase transition in 2D lattices, such as honeycomb13,14,17,41 and Kagome42,43 lattices, etc. Therefore the influence\nof the anisotropic exchange interactions deserves investigation. Here we first focus on the DMI originating from the spin-orbit coupling. Using the linear HP transformation, the DMI term HDM (more details are shown in Appendix) can be written as\nHDM = \u2212iD1zS \u2211\ni\n( a\u2020ibi \u2212 aib\u2020i )\n(10)\n\u2212iD2zS \u2211\ni,i+1\n( b\u2020iai+1 \u2212 bia\u2020i+1 ) ,\nwhere D1z and D2z are the components of intracellular D1 and intercellular D2 on the quantization z\u2212axis of spin, respectively. For simplicity, we fix D1z = J2 = 1 for the J1/J2 case and D1z = J1 = 1 for the J2/J1 case in all the calculations. Note that due to the chiral characteristic of DMI, the values of both D1z and D2z can be positive or negative for 1D chain, and all cases of four possible signs are considered. It is found that the change of sign does not change the topological phase diagram, but only the position of the closing gap in the energy spectrum during the phase transition. For D2z/D1z > 0, the energy gap closes at k = \u03c0/2 (Note that for the pure DMI alone, the gap closes at k = 0, not shown here, different from the case of the pure Heisenberg interaction.); otherwise, the position where energy gap closes is associated with D2z/D1z. Therefore, we only consider two cases with the relative sign of the D2z/D1z being positive or negative.\nCompared with the case of pure Heisenberg interaction, the phase transition condition (more details are shown in Appendix) in the presence of the anisotropic DMI is J21+D 2 1z\u2212J22\u2212 D22z = 0. Thus, the phase transition occurs at |D2z/D1z| = J1/J2 for the fixed D1z = J2 = 1 case, and (J2/J1) 2 + (D2z/D1z) 2 = 2 for the fixed D1z = J1 = 1 case. Obviously, the intercellular D2 (intracellular D1) DMI boosts (weakens) and even induces (eliminates) the topologically non-trivial phase, though the Heisenberg interaction alone can lead to the topological magnon phase, which obviously can be seen in Figs. 5-7.\nFor the quantization x-axis, as displayed in Fig. 1(c), the DMI term H \u2032\nDM can be rewritten\nas\nH \u2032 DM = \u2212iD1xS \u2211\ni\n( a\u2020ibi \u2212 aib\u2020i )\n(11)\n\u2212iD2xS \u2211\ni,i+1\n( b\u2020iai+1 \u2212 bia\u2020i+1 ) ,\nwhere D1x and D2x are the components of D1 and D2 on the quantization x-axis of spin, respectively. From the analysis of the DMI, we can find that only the components in the\ndirection of quantization axis will affect the topological properties of the system. Therefore, the conclusions drawn above are still valid.\nC. In the presence of PDI\nApart from the DMI, the PDI is another essential anisotropic exchange interaction, which is generally from the combination of the strong spin-orbit coupling and the orbital degree of\nfreedom28. Consequently, the PDI has the different influence on magnons due to its origin distinctly different from that of the DMI. For the quantization z-axis, using the linear HP transformation, the PDI term HPD (more details are shown in Appendix) are described as\nHPD = \u2212 F1 2 S \u2211\ni\n(\naibi + aib \u2020 i + a \u2020 ibi + a \u2020 ib \u2020 i\n)\n(12)\n\u2212F2 2 S \u2211\ni,i+1\n(\nbiai+1 + bia \u2020 i+1 + b \u2020 iai+1 + b \u2020 ia \u2020 i+1\n)\n.\nIn this 1D chain case, the direction of the PDI is along the x-axis and perpendicular to the quantization z-axis. For simplicity, F1 = J2 = 1 for the J1/J2 case and F1 = J1 = 1 for the J2/J1 case is fixed in all the calculations. The phase transition condition (more details are shown in Appendix) in the case of the Heisenberg interaction and PDI is F1+2J1\u2212F2\u22122J2 = 0. Thus the boundary between the trivial and non-trivial phases is determined by the relation 2J1/J2 \u2212 1 = F2/F1 for F1/J2 = 1, and \u22122J2/J1 + 3 = F2/F1 for F1/J1 = 1. Similar to the Heisenberg interaction and DMI cases, the intercellular F2 (intracellular F1) PDI favors (unfavors) the topologically non-trivial phase, as demonstrated in Figs. 8-10. Compared with the cases of the Heisenberg and DMI interactions, the position of gap close for the pure PDI case is at k = \u03c0, same as the Heisenberg one. This is a result of the different symmetries of these three magnetic interactions.\nFor the quantization x-axis, as displayed in Fig. 1(c), the PDI term H \u2032\nPD can be rewritten\nas\nH \u2032 PD = \u2212 (F1 + F2)S \u2211\ni\n(\na\u2020iai + b \u2020 ibi\n)\n, (13)\nand then the PDI becomes a term similar to the easy-axial anisotropy K term, equivalent to the on-site energy of magnon. Therefore, the PDI has no influence on the topological properties in this case.\nD. In the presence of both DMI and PDI\nFinally, we turn to the case of coexistence of both the anisotropic DMI and PDI. In fact, the Heisenberg interaction, DMI and PDI may possibly coexist in the same realistic\nmagnetic materials due to the the existence of multiple degrees of freedom, especially in 3d, 4d and even 5d correlated materials, such as magnetic materials in iridates44,45, etc. However, the phase transition condition is no longer linear. For simplicity, both D1z = J1, F1 = J1 and J1 = 1 are fixed in all the calculations. Then the phase transition boundary can be determined numerically.\nAs shown in Figs. 11, comparing the J-D, J-F and D-F phase diagrams, it is found that the coexistence of the isotropic Heisenberg interaction, anisotropic DMI and PDI show\ndifferent topological phase diagrams from these in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 9(a) as a result of the interplay among them. Evidently, these three interactions have synergistic effects on the generation of topologically non-trivial phase. In essence, it is the intercellular interactions (J2, D2 and F2) rather than the intracellular interactions (J1, D1 and F1) that contribute to the emergence of the topological phases. As a consequence, these different magnetic exchange interactions introduce a rich topological phase diagram in the 1D magnon system, suggesting a realization of multiple manipulation of topological magnonics. As matter of fact, the relative strength between the isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions, can be changed by the strain and pressure regulations in the realistic materials, subsequently the topological phase transition of magnons can be achieved."

            "text": "We notice that different from our local spins, topological magnons in 1D itinerant flatband ferromagnet are also proposed46. Indeed, the 1D topological magnons can be explored in realistic one-dimensional (1D) magnets47, quasi-1D magnetic materials48, or 1D organic\nmagnetic systems49,50. As can be expected, more 1D magnetic models rather than the SSH model can be extended to topological magnons. Another way to implement the 1D ferromagnetic SSH model is to strip an edge from the magnonic 2D SSH model in honeycomb ferromagnets51. On the other hand, our results also imply that the topological magnons in the 1D systems are distinctly different from these in the 2D ones, introducing a new platform for the topological magnons.\nIn summary, we construct a one-dimensional (1D) ferromagnetic (FM) SSH model with the anisotropic interactions, and find a topological magnon non-trivial phase described by the\nZak phase, induced not only by the pure strong intercellular isotropic Heisenberg interaction J1/J2 < 1, but also by the strong intercellular anisotropic DMI and PDI. The intercellular anisotropic DMI and PDI in combination with the intercellular isotropic Heisenberg-type interaction manifest a synergistic effect on the topological phase transition. In addition, the quantization axis of spin also substantially affect the topological magnon phase diagram owing to the anisotropic interactions. Of particular interest, the existence of topologically protected in-gap edge states (magnon bound states) in 1D magnets with FM SSH model provides a possible route to Majorana-like particle realization. Due to the rich manipulated magnetic interactions and the 1D structural characteristics, abundant topological magnon states and magnonic crystals can be designed from bottom to top, suggesting potential applications in the field of topological magnonics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Sciences Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 11974354, 11774350 and 11574315.

When the topological phase transition occurs at the closed energy gap, and the parameters are satisfied by \n \n \n\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 cos(ka) + \u03b31\u03b21 sin(ka) = 0 sin(ka)\u2212 \u03b21 + \u03b31\u03b21 cos(ka) = 0 (17)\nCancelling sin(ka) and cos(ka), we find \u03b221 + \u03b1 2 = 1 + \u03b321\u03b2 2 1 . Here we take \u03b21 = 1 and a = 1. As a result, the condition of the phase transition (i.e. the gap closed) is \u03b12 = \u03b321 . When \u03b31 = \u03b1, sin(ka) = 1, that is, k = \u03c0/2a; when \u03b31 = \u2212\u03b1, sin(ka) = (1 \u2212 \u03b12)/(1 + \u03b12), cos(ka) = \u22122\u03b1/(1 + \u03b12).\nFor H2 = H0 + HPD, we assume F1/J2 = \u03b22 > 0, F2/F1 = \u03b32 > 0, F2/J2 = \u03b32\u03b22. The\nparameters are satisfied by\n(2\u03b1 + \u03b22) 2 + (2 + \u03b32\u03b22) 2 + 2(2\u03b1+ \u03b22)(2 + \u03b32\u03b22) cos(ka) = 0 (18)\nObviously, \u22121 \u2264 cos(ka) < 0. Assuming n = cos(ka)\u2212 (\u22121), it can be rewritten as\n((2\u03b1 + \u03b22)\u2212 (2 + \u03b32\u03b22))2 + 2n(2\u03b1+ \u03b22)(2 + \u03b32\u03b22) = 0 (19)\nWe can see that it is valid only for n = 0, i.e. cos(ka) = \u22121. We take \u03b22 = 1, and then \u03b32 = 2\u03b1 \u2212 1. Then the condition of topological phase transition can be determined analytically.\n\u2217 dyliu@ntu.edu.cn \u2020 zou@theory.issp.ac.cn 1 K. von Klitzing, G. Dorda, and M. Pepper, Phys. Rev.
