    "abstractText": "Indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) is a well-known metabolite involved in tryptophan metabolism. Indole derivatives are involved in the differentiation of immune cells and the synthesis of cytokines via the aryl hydrocarbon receptors for modulating immunity, and the indole derivatives may be involved in allergic responses. I3LA was selected as a candidate substance for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD), and its inhibitory effect on AD progression was investigated. Full-thickness human skin equivalents (HSEs) consisting of human-derived cells were generated on microfluidic chips and stimulated with major AD-inducing factors. The induced AD-HSEs were treated with I3LA for 7 days, and this affected the AD-associated genetic biomarkers and increased the expression of the major constituent proteins of the skin barrier. After the treatment for 14 days, the surface became rough and sloughed off, and there was no significant difference between the increased AD-related mRNA expression and the skin barrier protein expression. Therefore, the short-term use of I3LA for approximately one week is considered to be effective in suppressing AD.",

            "text": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease [1]. The pathological features of AD include dry erythematous lesions and severe itching, extensive intercellular edema (spongiosis) in the epidermis, and intracellular edema (i.e., ballooning of the keratinocytes) [2,3]. In AD, T cells are hyperdifferentiated into T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and the mRNA expression levels of the Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) are significantly increased when they are compared to those in normal skin [3]. AD is a Th2-mediated hyperimmune response, and approximately 80% of AD patients have elevated serum IgE levels. The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are significantly overexpressed in the skin lesions of patients with AD. The weakening of the epidermal barrier function in AD is associated with the downregulation of barrier-associated molecules such as filaggrin (FLG), loricrin (LOR), and involucrin (IVL) [4], which are coordinated by various barrier proteins such as FLG and LOR via sequential cross-linking. Most human epidermal barrier proteins are mapped to the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) by a 1.9 Mbp gene cluster that is located on chromosome 1p21, which plays a substantial role in the terminal differentiation of the human epidermis [5]. A variety of external and internal stimuli, including Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) or Th22 (IL-22) cytokines, lead to the upregulation or downregulation of the barrier gene expression levels of the barrier proteins in EDCs. IL-4 and IL-13 are known to significantly inhibit the gene and protein expression of FLG and LOR [6\u20138]. IL-4 and IL-13 induce AD in skin keratinocytes [9]. Thymic stromal\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2022, 23, 13520 2 of 14\nlymphopoietin (TSLP) is a major epithelia-derived cytokine that is involved in AD pathogenesis [10,11]. In particular, increased TSLP expression was observed in skin keratinocytes from AD patients, and elevated TSLP levels were reported in the serum of children with AD [12]. Corneocyte TSLP expression levels have been reported to be correlated with cutaneous sensitivity and asthma severity [13]. Because of its genetically determined pathophysiology, there is no perfect cure for AD. Until recently, AD treatments have focused on preventing the triggers, hydrating the skin, and reducing the inflammation. A typical treatment for atopy is the use of topical corticosteroids (steroids) to treat the inflammation. However, since the long-term use of topical corticosteroids is limited by its side effects [14\u201317], substances and treatments that can be used for a long time without the occurrence of toxicity are required. Treatment with microbial metabolites can be considered as a safer and more effective strategy for the treatment of AD. AD treatment strategies can consider modulating the skin microbiota to promote the development of topical or systemic drugs, which originate from microbial metabolites and the production of specific useful metabolites. Microbial metabolites have received widespread interest over the past few years, however, skin microbial metabolites are less well-known than gut microbes are [18,19]. AD is the most well-studied skin disease in microbiological treatments, and the research has mainly focused on the structure and diversity of the microbial communities [20,21]. Previous studies have revealed significant changes in the skin\u2019s microbial community diversity and structure in AD patients compared to healthy individuals as well as changes in specific microbes, such as Staphylococcus aureus [21,22]. It has also been reported that tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is attenuated in the skin microbiome of patients with AD [23]. These results have identified major metabolites that are formed by the skin microbiota that are either current or likely targets in the search for AD therapeutics. Indole and indole derivatives are essential amino acid Trp metabolites that influence the host\u2019s physiology via several molecular mechanisms [24,25]. Indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) is a metabolite of Trp, and indole derivatives participate in the differentiation of immune cells and the synthesis of cytokines via the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) to regulate the immune responses and participate in anti-inflammatory and allergic reactions [26,27]. AhR is involved in skin homeostasis in both physiological and pathological conditions [28]. Recently, it was reported that microbial metabolites on the skin\u2019s surface can activate AhR in keratinocytes and control skin inflammation [29]. Histamines act through the H4 receptor of T cells to inhibit the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation and promote Th2 reactions to cause atopy [30]. I3LA was effective in regulating the STAT1 signaling pathway [31]. In a previous study, the macrophages that were differentiated from THP-1 cell lines were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to confirm the effect of an indole derivative on the expression of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13, which validated that indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and I3LA play a role in allergic pathogenesis [26]. Most models and disease assessments that predict drug toxicity at nonclinical stages have been conducted via animal testing. However, their biological similarities that they have with humans are often limited, and the strengthened regulations on the use of laboratory animals have led to a growing need for alternative experimental models [32\u201334]. In this study, AD was induced using a skin-on-a-chip generation of HSEs, which is an alternative animal model. In the HSEs composed of human-derived AD-induced cells, we attempted to confirm the effects of I3LA on AD disease progression and symptom alleviation, as well as the expression of related cytokine mRNAs, TSLP mRNA, and epidermal barrier proteins."

Skin Barrier Recovery Effect by I3LA To confirm the effects of I3LA on the morphology, the tissue cross-sections were examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. As shown in Figure 4, when we were looking at the stratum corneum of the skin tissue on day 7, it was found that the stratum corneum in the group that was treated with I3LA was thicker than that of the untreated group. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) results confirmed that the treatment with I3LA for 7 days resulted in a thicker stratum corneum due to the increased expression of the key constituent proteins of the skin barrier, which led to the skin barrier\u2019s restoration. On the 14th day, as shown in b, it was observed that the keratin layer of the group that was treated with I3LA was not significantly different or damaged when it was compared to the untreated group. The IHC results showed no significant differences in the skin barrier proteins after 14 days of the I3LA treatment.

The treatment for 14 days did not generate a significantly different expression of these proteins compared to the 7-day treatment. Similar to the results of the gene expression comparison using a PCR, I3LA did not affect the expression of epidermal barrier-related genes, and therefore, there was no significant difference in the expression of the skin barrier proteins. IL-4 and IL-13 decrease the expression of FLG, IVL, and LOR, the major constituent proteins of the skin barrier [4,37\u201339]. To investigate the expression of FLG, IVL, and LOR in the AD tissue and the efficacy of I3LA in restoring the skin barrier, an IHC was performed, and the results are shown in Figure 4c\u2013h. The response to the I3LA treatment was compared between the groups that were treated with IL-4 or IL-13, individually, and the group that was treated with both. When I3LA was administered for 7 days, FLG, IVL, and LOR were increased in the group that was not treated with I3LA. However, FLG and IVL decreased in the group that was treated with both IL-4/IL-13 and I3LA in comparison to the group that was not treated with I3LA. When I3LA was administered for 14 days, FLG increased in the group that was treated with IL-13 in comparison to the group not treated with I3LA. FLG expression decreased in the group that was treated with IL-4 in I3LA, and the skin barrier\u2019s damage was not reversed. The expression of IVL and LOR was higher in the group that was treated with I3LA than it was in the untreated group. The total protein expression in the control group that was treated with I3LA for 14 days was reduced when it was compared to that of the group that was not treated with I3LA. Overall, the I3LA treatment for 7 days increased the expression of the major constituent proteins of the skin barrier, but the treatment for 14 days did not lead to further changes. In order to morphologically confirm the effect of I3LA, the surface of the tissue was observed using SEM, and the results of this are summarized in Figure 5. Corneocytes were extruded into a hexagonal shape and sloughed off in the SC layer. Decreased FLG expression can affect the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels, and consequently, alter the skin\u2019s hydration and pH [40]. Skin dehydration causes xerosis, the weakening of the epidermal barrier, and itchiness. An increased pH enhances the activity of the proteases that are responsible for keratin exfoliation and decreases the activity of the enzymes that are involved in barrier lipid synthesis [41,42]. The treatment with cytokines likely caused a severe desquamation of the stratum corneum and led to a rough surface that is indicative of hyperkeratosis. However, when the combined IL-4/IL-13 treatment was used for 14 days alongside I3LA, we observed the appearance of a very rough surface, the severe shedding of keratin, and/or cracked skin surfaces, suggesting that the barrier formation was severely compromised, and the AD had progressed. When we were examining the surface of the tissue, the AD-HSEs that were treated with I3LA for 7 days were observed to have no or reduced amounts of raised areas and a flat or smooth surface. This is thought to be related to the decrease in the expression of the TSLP, CA2, and IL-6 genes when it was treated with I3LA for 7 days.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13520 8 of 14 Int. J. Mol.

Novel treatment strategies using the skin microbiota may be safer and more effective. As part of the basic research to utilize the skin microbiota to develop topical or systemic drugs from skin microbial metabolites and to produce useful therapeutics, I3LA was investigated for its efficacy as an AD therapeutic agent. The I3LA treatment for 7 days had a positive effect on AD and the allergy-related gene biomarkers, but it did not affect the skin barrier-related mRNA expression. It did result in an increase in the expression of the major constituent proteins of the skin barrier. However, the I3LA treatment for more than 14 days resulted in surface roughness and keratin shedding, and it did not affect the AD-related mRNA or the skin barrier protein expression. Therefore, the short-term use of I3LA for approximately one week is considered to be effective in suppressing AD. In addition, we determined that I3LA inhibited the contraction of HSEs. The significant anti-contractile effect of I3LA was attenuated by the addition of cytokines. The contractile inhibitory effect of I3LA was reduced by the cytokines in the following order of magnitude: IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation, the IL-13 only treatment, and the IL-4 only treatment. In this study, it was not possible to clarify the mechanism by which I3LA, a microbial metabolite, was involved in the contraction HSEs suppression and how it affected the expression of the AD-related mRNAs such as TSLP and IL-6. In the future, extensive research should be conducted to understand the biological effects of these metabolites on contraction, and to understand the current and potential treatment approaches and potential value of skin microbial metabolites in regulating such conditions.\nAuthor Contributions: G.Y.S. supervised the project and designed the experiments; K.K. and H.K. conducted the experiments, analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript; K.K. wrote and prepared the original draft; G.Y.S. performed data quantification, discussed the results and commented on the manuscript.
