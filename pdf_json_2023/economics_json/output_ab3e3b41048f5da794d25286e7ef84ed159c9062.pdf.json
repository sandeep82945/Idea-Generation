    "abstractText": "The purpose of this study is to investigate how COVID-19 pandemic including some coping strategies such as hand wash with soap and food consumption influences work operation or performance of nonfarm household enterprises (NHEs) in Nigeria using 2020 Living Standard Measurement Survey data of 1728 sample size. This study departs from existing study in two ways: first, the study employs multinomial logistic regression technique to ascertain the determinants of work performance of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria. Second, the study focuses on nonfarm enterprises such as petty trade, road side automobile and cab drivers. The results show that COVID-19 pandemic is significant with negative influence on the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria. The result of the study also reveals that coping strategy such as hand wash with soap during the pandemic is an important driver of work performance or operation of NHEs in Nigeria. Another coping strategy like food consumption by nonfarm household enterprises shows insignificant influence on work operation which implies that there is no relationship between food consumption and work operation by NHEs in Nigeria. The policy recommendation of this study, among others, is that policies should focus on procurement of sanitary material for public use. This can be achieved through public sensitisation in terms of organising workshops and conferences.",

            "text": "Work operation or performance, according to Janssen (2000), is an activity that is performed to meet the objectives and requirements of a job. Messmann and Mulder (2011) also define work operation as activities employees perform to meet the responsibilities and goals of their roles. These definitions indicate that work operation has a common synergy with observable (physical) and unobservable (mental) components to achieve desired job performance. The observable work operation indicates manual labour, while unobservable work operation indicates human initiative. Indeed, by these definitions of work operation, we can agree that developing countries like Nigeria are still lacking potential in terms of work operation despite the fact that the country is endowed in both capital and human resources. Also, the coping strategy in this study is conceptualised as tactical approach to manage conditions and crises that are appraised distressing.\nIt has been found in recent years that inadequacies in work operation and coping strategies by NHEs have posed a significant problem for policymakers, especially in developing countries like Nigeria. These problems overtime have led to considerable loss of output and profit performance not only in enterprises but in other corporate organisations. Clearly, such inadequacies in work operation have brought numerous unpleasant economic consequences to business in terms of profit and expansion in Nigeria. For instance, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC, 2022) reveals that many enterprises established in Nigeria, particularly small and medium enterprises, are seriously challenged with low work operation in recent years. Another report from Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) in 2020 attests to the fact and also revealed that Nigeria has recorded some substantial increase in unemployment of about 4.5% in the recent time. Such increase in unemployment was found to have caused a huge decline of output production in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Such increase in unemployment is blamed on inadequacies of work operation by enterprises (Ojonta, 2023).\nSome studies in the literature (e.g. Omaka-Amari, 2020; Mustapha et\u00a0al., 2020; Ozili, 2020; Onyeaghala & Olajide, 2020) highlighted some trickledown effect of unemployment rate in Nigeria if allowed to continue in Nigeria. The study revealed that when unemployment increases, the common phenomenon is wrong signal in economic growth, consistent of protest and agitation in the nationwide. Apart from the issue of unemployment caused by poor work operation, the 2018 National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reveals that Nigeria is still facing a low income characterised by high level of inequality, poor living condition and high dependency ratio. Indeed, Nigeria is currently regarded as the world\u2019s poverty headquarters with over 93 million people living in extreme poverty (Urama & Iheonu, 2019). It is believed that the performance of nonfarm household enterprises (NHEs) may have deteriorated following the low work operation, thereby worsening the poverty situation in the country. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be threatening the performance and survival of these enterprises, particularly their production and expansion. This, in turn, constitutes serious impediment to household welfare since many households may be exposed to the challenges of low productivity, high commodity prices, and low demand for goods and services. Hence, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a setback to the operations of NHEs as it appears to have crippled the ability of these enterprises to create jobs and alleviate poverty.\nIndeed, the influence of COVID-19 pandemic including its coping strategies on the performance of NHEs in developing countries like Nigeria cannot be over stressed. This is because the pandemic is characterised by high cost of products in the market, deterioration\n1 3\nin the standard of living, and low level of consumption (Andam et\u00a0al., 2020). Akanni and Gabriel (2020) revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to global economic shutdown, which would in turn have a severely influence on the countries with little or no diversified sources of revenue. Some recent studies in the extant literature (Coccia, 2021; Suthar et\u00a0al., 2021; Adib et\u00a0al., 2021; Oyebode et\u00a0al., 2021; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2021) established that COVID-19 pandemic is real and its adverse influence has caused serious impediments on general work performance of firms in urban relative to rural areas. In practical and/or economic terms, COVID-19 pandemic is seen to have established huge presence of social and physical distancing, which has somewhat affected the supply of goods and services to consumers by NHEs. This experience occasioned by this pandemic had actually affected the economy of most developing countries with high level of shocks to consumption patterns, poor returns on investment in NHEs, and poor output production by these enterprises.\nIt has also revealed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a viral pandemic that has substantially threatened the performance of NHEs in Nigeria, regardless of whether such enterprises are located in the rural or urban areas (NBS, 2020). This suggests that a large population of NHEs in Nigeria are facing with great problems and deprivations resulting from the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Such problems and deprivations include: limited in supply of palliatives like food, clothing, hand sanitizers and face mask from both the government and the private sector participants to the end users. These palliatives were meant to cushion the adverse effects of the pandemic. However, these palliatives were diverted to individual use despites the financial support from other countries of the world. Apart from world support in providing these palliatives, several efforts and initiatives have been made on the part of government to guarantee safety and survival of NHEs. These initiatives are in form of directives to financial institutions by government to disburse funds to small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) through relevant intervention funds set up by the Central Bank of Nigeria, such as the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, MSME Development Fund, and Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) funds. The main aim of these interventions is to make funds available and affordable to SMEs in order to curtail the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure the sustainability of enterprise in Nigeria.\nThere are some previous studies in the literature that examined the factors that influence work performance from various perspectives, both in developed and developing economies. Many of these studies in developing countries such as Omaka-Amari, 2020; Mustapha et\u00a0al., 2020; Ozili, 2020; Onyeaghala & Olajide, 2020) focused on using data from the daily updates of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to examine the effects of the pandemic from public health management perspective. Salako et\u00a0al. (2020) investigated the effects of the pandemic on the environment. This study appears to be close to the current study, but they nonetheless focused on different indicators in measuring the performance of work operation by HNEs in Nigeria using ordinary least square technique. Some studies from developed economies, Amzat et\u00a0 al. (2020), Chakraborty and Maity (2020), Suryahadi et\u00a0al.(2020), Waris et\u00a0al.(2020), Tuite et\u00a0al. (2020), Ardabili et\u00a0al. (2020), Wu et\u00a0al. (2020), and Danese et\u00a0al. (2020), among others focused on how COVID-19 pandemic significantly influences human respiratory system. Other previous studies in the literature such as Binti et\u00a0 al., (2020), Lingzhong et\u00a0 al. (2020), and Anastassopoulou et\u00a0 al. (2020) investigated how COVID-19 pandemic has significant influence on public healthcare, while Chakraborty and Maity (2020), Suryahadi et\u00a0al. (2020), and Waris et\u00a0al. (2020) examined the influence of coping strategies such income, access to credit and spending pattern as determinants of work performance. This study departs from these previous studies that\n1 3\nhave been conducted with the use of ordinary least square technique. These studies faced problems associated with such approach and as such made this study to employ logistic regression technique in the study of how COVID-19 pandemic and some coping strategies such as washing hands with soap and food consumption influenced the work operation of household nonfarm enterprises in Nigeria. This study is of the view that a study of work operation or performance of household nonfarm enterprises using ordinary least square technique without considering the important role of logistic regression technique using survey dataset from NBS cannot decisively unfold the true situation of work performance of household nonfarm enterprises in Nigeria. Hence, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the influence of COVID-19 pandemic and its coping strategies on the work operation of household nonfarm enterprises in Nigeria.\nConsequently, the key questions asked in this study are: how has COVID-19 pandemic influenced on the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria? How has coping strategy such as hand wash with soap and kind of food consumption during pandemic influence the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria? In other words, the objectives of this study are twofold, namely: (i) to ascertain the how COVID-19 pandemic influences the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria; and (ii) to ascertain influence of coping strategies such as hand wash with soap and food consumption during pandemic on the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria. To achieve these two objectives, we employed a primary method for data analysis, quantitative data analysis. These specific objectives are relevant because unveiling the factors influencing the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria will provide the much-needed evidence, which will in turn assist policymakers in advancing the fortunes of these enterprises, thereby repositioning these enterprises for better performance in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, the following hypotheses were evaluated in this study:\nHypothesis 1 COVID-19 pandemic has not influenced significantly on the work operation of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria.\nHypothesis 2 Coping strategies such as hand wash with soap and food consumption have not significantly influenced the work operation of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria.\nThe remaining sections of this paper proceed as follows. The next Section presents an overview of the extant literature from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, while Sect.\u00a03 provides the data and the method of analysis employed in this study, detailing the model specification. The empirical results are shown and discussed in Sect.\u00a04, while Sect.\u00a05 concludes the paper."

            "text": "Some theories in the literature support this investigation on the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. a novel disease) and the work operation of NHEs. These theories include: the multi-factorial causation theory; the Miasma theory, and the germ theory of disease (Farr, 1848; Grandmann, 2006; Pasteur, 1881). According to the multi-factorial causation theory advanced by Grandmann (2006), agent, host and environmental factors\n1 3\nwill act and interact in synergy and as joint independent partners in causing a disease. The theory of multi-factorial causation established that the existence of a disease is associated with the environment. The theory established that the environment could escalate diseases to undermine individuals, who wish to maintain their productive capacity. This theory was designed to display three key factors, namely: to examine the role of multi-factorial causation, to decide how the environment affects the economy as a whole, and to show how government policies can restructure the economy. Empirical studies (e.g. Ardabili et\u00a0al., 2020; Chakraborty & Maity, 2020; Danese et\u00a0al., 2020; Suryahadi et\u00a0al., 2020; Tuite et\u00a0al., 2020; Waris et\u00a0al., 2020; Wu et\u00a0al., 2020) that have investigated how COVID-19 pandemic affects economies are generally underpinned by this theoretical viewpoint.\nFarr (1848) propounded the Miasma theory. The theory was designed to examine the source of cholera disease. The theory established that cholera pandemic is contagious as it passes from one sick individual to others. The theorist further explained that cholera pandemic can be spread through breathing of polluted air, and that the pandemic could lead to high mortality rate on the part of the people that do not have the preventive measures. The theory shows that the widespread of cholera pandemic could lead to problem of moral hazard and asymmetric information.\nThe germ theory of disease as propounded by Pasteur (1881) explains that it is important to know the source of any disease that is widespread. The theory established that each germ helps a disease to spread, and without germs, diseases will not transfer from one person to another. The theory describes germs as simple living organisms that could be seen only with a microscope. The theory established that when germs are found in humans, the likelihood is that such humans could be attacked by diseases and that germs can as well be transferred to cause sickness in another human. The theory explains that germs are associated with diseases based on the underlying conditions such as environmental and social contacts. According to the theorist, social contact by individuals is a major cause of germ and disease transmission. Empirical studies like Oyeniran and Chia (2020), Salako et\u00a0al. (2020) and Amzat et\u00a0al. (2020) are consistent with this theoretical perspective."

            "text": "Some studies have been conducted for the purpose of estimating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, both within and outside Nigeria. Outside Nigeria, studies like Chakraborty and Maity (2020), Suryahadi et\u00a0al.(2020), Waris et\u00a0al.(2020), Tuite et\u00a0al. (2020), Ardabili et\u00a0al. (2020), Wu et\u00a0al. (2020), and Danese et\u00a0al. (2020) established that COVID-19 pandemic is real and its effects are devastating. These studies generally established that COVID-19 pandemic influences negatively and significantly on the economy.\nThe prediction and experience of COVID-19 pandemic on health management have been explored by other studies, such as Binti et\u00a0al. (2020), Lingzhong et\u00a0al. (2020), and Anastassopoulou et\u00a0 al. (2020). These studies predicted that COVID-19 pandemic would be characterised as substantial public health threat. Rothan and Byrareddy (2020) demonstrated that COVID-19 pandemic is not only causing public health threat, but that it is also a pathogen that targets primarily human respiratory system. Yang et\u00a0al. (2020) found that COVID-19 pandemic is characterised by fever, fatigue, cough, and ground-glass capacity on chest tomography. The pandemic of coronavirus and its effect on global mental health was investigated by Torales et\u00a0 al. (2020). The study revealed that COVID-19 pandemic has effect on global mental health. Elengoe (2020) established that preventive measures\n1 3\nare very important instruments in controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 and explained that preparedness should be a priority against future pandemics in Malaysia.\nIn Nigeria, studies like Mustapha et\u00a0al. (2020), Ozili (2020), and Onyeaghala and Olajide (2020) investigated the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on public health and found that COVID-19 pandemic is more prevalent in environments that are cosmopolitan in nature. Other studies like Oyeniran and Chia (2020), Salako et\u00a0al. (2020), and Amzat et\u00a0al. (2020) found that COVID-19 pandemic will be doubled if stringent public health measures are not adequately enforced in Nigeria. Ajisegiri et\u00a0al. (2020) used cross sectional data to investigate COVID-19 pandemic and the need for engagement of local health workers for effective epidemic response in Nigeria, while Olusola et\u00a0al. (2022) and Ejeh et\u00a0al. (2020) employed field data. These studies generally show that COVID-19 pandemic exerts negative and significant influence on the work operation of health workers. Omaka-Amari1 et\u00a0al. (2020) examined the existence of COVID-19 pandemic using data from daily updates of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The study explained the trend of COVID19 spread within the first 2\u00a0months of the pandemic in Nigeria and found that within that period, there was a steady increase in COVID-19 from one case on 27 February 2020 to 1932 confirmed cases, 58 fatalities and 319 discharged cases by 30 April 2020.\nOverall, the empirical literature indicates that the influence of COVID-19 pandemic and coping strategies such as washing hands with soap and food consumption on the work operation of NHEs in Nigeria is yet to be investigated. Herein lies the main contribution of this study to the literature. Studies in Nigeria (e.g. Ajisegiri et\u00a0al., 2020; Ejeh et\u00a0al., 2020; Olusola et\u00a0al., 2022; Oyeniran & Chia, 2020) did not explicitly focus on household nonfarm enterprises."

            "text": "The theory of multi-factorial causation propounded by Grandmann (2006) provides the theoretical underpinning for this study. This theory recognises the role of the environment in the existence of a disease. Here, the theory is extended by considering two groups of identical individuals; such that while one group is located in a favourable environment (i.e. an urban area), the other is located in a less favourable environment (i.e. a rural area). It is assumed here that a favourable environment is an urban area where affordable social amenities are available. Thus, households would prefer to locate their nonfarm enterprises in such urban areas regardless of the high cost of living in such environment. This is because such NHEs are expected to yield better returns on investment through profits and business expansions. However, recent experiences have shown that COVID-19 pandemic is more prevalent in such urban environments than the less favourable rural environments. Another studies by Oyeniran and Chia (2020), Salako et\u00a0al. (2020), and Amzat et\u00a0al. (2020) on the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that it has something to do with the environment. This situation in which households or individuals are willing to locate their nonfarm enterprises in such urban environments despite the alarming rate of COVID-19 infections in such environment will eventually lead to slow down in the operations of such enterprises. However, such situations can hamper the effective operations or work capacity of NHEs. Such NHEs could then face a serious problem of adverse selection or moral hazard. The general conclusion could be that the overall work operation of the enterprises will be adversely\n1 3\naffected. Thus, the theorist submits that the environment where a pandemic is found can greatly influence the work operation of enterprises located in it. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic may have greatly influenced the challenges presently confronting NHEs in developing countries. Thus, the theory of multi-factorial causation advanced by Grandmann (2006) provides some support for the specification of the underlying model for this study."

Since the work operation of NHEs is a dependent variable with three categories, this study followed the modelling approach of multinomial logic regression as contained in the study by Nxumalo et\u00a0 al. (2019) rooted in Greene (2003). In the Multinomial Logit model employed in this study, Yi is used to represent the work operation of NHEs, while Xi is used to represent the set of independent variables incorporated in the study. The study assumes that each variable is mutually exclusive event. Hence, the MNL model is coded as three outcomes in measuring the welfare influence of COVID19 pandemic. That is, the MNL model determines the probability that an enterprise i has one of the j mutually exclusive. The dependent variable which is either the work operation or performance by NHEs present three categories (0 = TEMPORARY CLOSED as reference category, suggests that HNE is not working consistently; 1 = NOT CLOSED, implies that HNE is working consistently; 2 = PERMANENTLY CLOSED, denotes that HNE was totally shutdown of work performance). Following Justino et\u00a0 al. (2008), this probability can be stated formally as:\nIn Eq.\u00a0 (1), Yi represents the work operation experienced by each enterprise, i; k are the coefficients to be estimated; and xi are the set of independent variables. To achieve identification in estimation, 0 (i.e. no substantial threat) has been set to zero. This is referred to as the Theil Normalisation. Without this normalisation, different parameterisation could give rise to identical probabilities leading to indeterminacy in the model. Theil normalisation helps to overcome this problem in the MNL model. All other k are estimated in relation to the 0 benchmark.\nThe independent variables included in the study, Xi, are explained as follows:\n\u2022 X1 denotes WASH, which describes the NHEs that had sufficient soap to wash hands. This is a binary variable which takes a value of 1 if the NHE had sufficient soap to wash hands, and 0 otherwise if NHEs had insufficient soap to wash hands. \u2022 X2 denotes FOOD, which describes the food consumption of NHEs. It is also a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if the NHEs had sufficient food consumption, and 0 otherwise if NHEs did not have sufficient food consumption. \u2022 X3 denotes PANDEMIC, which describes how much threat COVID-19 pandemic has caused a HNE. It is a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if the pandemic had caused substantial threat, and 0 otherwise if the pandemic did not cause any substantial threat.\n(1) P(Yi = j) =\ne jxi\n1 + J \u2211\nK=1\ne kxi\n, for j = 1, 2\u2026 J; and P(Yi = 0) = 1\n1 + J \u2211\nK=1\ne kxi\n.\nThese variable descriptions are further summarised in Table\u00a01."

The data captured all the 36 states of the federation including Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja. The dataset studied in living standard measurement survey was designed to capture local government areas as reporting domain. However, the sample designed for the survey was prepared to cut across the national, zones and state of the country. The sampling frame for the local government which is 774 in the country employed Enumeration Areas (EA) replicated such that each local government had 3 replicates to 10 EAs each. The LSMS employed a balanced sampling technique of which selection of EA constitutes the first stage or rather primary sampling units. The survey contains information regarding COVID-19 pandemic work operation of NHEs and other aspects of NHEs\u2019 characteristics like coping strategies during the period of COVID-19 pandemic. Since this study focused on COVID-19 pandemic and various forms of coping strategies, we utilised the available data in the survey with a sample size of 1728. The balanced sampling approach (using the cube method) was adopted for the analysis. The balanced sampling approach enables selection of a random sample that still retains the properties of the frame across selected covariates. In sample selection, the formula developed by Taro Yamane was used to determine the sample size and a sample of 1728 were selected for the study (Osunka & Unachukwu, 2020). This suggests that the total population of the observations amounted to 20,667."

The table shows that NHEs in rural areas have more percentage share of substantial threat of COVID-19 in rural areas relative to their counterpart in urban areas. The quantitative evidence from the table also shows during the pandemic, the working operations of NHEs reveal that greater share of the enterprise of 482 do not closed, while very few of 71 are temporary closed\nand in between the two of 133 enterprises are permanently closed. The table also indicates that the working operation of the NHEs is more of the enterprise in rural areas.\nTable\u00a02 also demonstrated some coping strategies during the pandemic to ensure effective and efficient performance of work operation of NHEs in Nigeria. The table shows that more of the NHEs in rural areas buy soap to wash during the pandemic relative to their counterpart in urban areas. Those who do not adopt such strategy are found more in rural areas. But considering the kind of food consumption by NHEs, the table indicates that more share of rural areas support (yes) that kind of food consumption by NHEs is a coping strategy during the pandemic but less in urban areas."

However, correct classification was only 3.00% for the \u201cNOT CLOSED\u201d group and zero TEMPORARY CLOSED cases were correctly classified. This model then is most useful for those whose NHEs scores improved\n1 3\ngroup for cases 4, \u201cPERMANENTLY CLOSED\u201d group for cases 479 and \u201cTEMPORARY CLOSED\u201d group for 0 cases. The table indicates that the overall final model which is 70.5% is accurately predicted. The classification table also shows that the \u201cPERMANENTLY CLOSED\u201d group had 479 cases with highest prediction level of 99.6%. \u201cNOT CLOSED\u201d group had 4 cases with 3% prediction level, while \u201cTEMPORARY CLOSED\u201d group had no prediction level. The prediction is somewhat common occurrence in multinomial logistic regression. For the 4 cases in the \u201cNOT CLOSED\u201d group, the predicted model incorrectly classified 129 cases as \u201cPERMANENTLY CLOSED\u201d and 0 cases as \u201cTEMPORARY CLOSED\u201d. For the No cases in the \u201cTEMPORARY CLOSED\u201d group, the predicted model incorrectly classified 2 as \u201cNOT CLOSED\u201d and 69 cases as \u201cPERMANENTLY CLOSED\u201d. For 497 cases in the \u201cPERMANENTLY CLOSED\u201d group, the prediction model incorrectly classified 2 cases in the \u201cNOT CLOSED\u201d and 0 in the \u201cTEMPORARY CLOSED\u201d. Using the percentage of marginal frequencies of dependent variables as shown in Table\u00a02, the proportional-by chance accuracy rate for 25% prediction improvement is established as follows: (0.1032 + 0.7022 + 0.1932 = 0.541), then (1.25 \u00d7 0.541 = 0.676). If 70.5% > 67.6%, then the model improves on chance by 25% or more and is considered adequate or useful. These results are in line with the finding by Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000)."

Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic included in the model as explanatory variable, other explanatory variable is coping strategies such as washing hands with soap and food consumption. The findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic (PANDEMIC) has a negative coefficient of \u2212 0.549, which is statistically significant at 1% level. This implies that COVID-19 pandemic has negative influence on the work operation of household nonfarm enterprises in Nigeria. This also suggests that COVID-19 is not a driven factor of work operation of household nonfarm enterprises in Nigeria especially when the enterprise is not closed. This result is consistent with the study by Nwosu et\u00a0al. (2018), Ojonta and Ogbuabor (2021a; b) and Ojonta et\u00a0al. (2021), which also established that COVID-19 pandemic is a serious impediment to work operation of NHEs in Nigeria. The findings also indicate that coping strategy like washing hands with soap (WASH) during the pandemic plays an important role on work operation by NHEs in Nigeria. The WASH has a positive coefficient of (1.131), which is also statistically significant at 1% level. This also implies that buying soap to wash hands during pandemic is an important driver of work operation by NHEs in Nigeria. This result is consistent with studies conducted by Ojonta (2023). This study has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic and coping strategy of washing hand with soap are significant factors that influence the work operation by nonfarm household enterprise in Nigeria both negative and positive, respectively. Another factor, food consumption by NHEs as coping strategy is insignificant in influencing work operation."

            "text": "Using a multinomial logistic regression model, we estimated how COVID-19 pandemic and some coping strategies such as food consumption pattern and washing hands with soap influence the work operation of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria. The results\nObservation: 1728, dependent variable: work operation 1 = B: relative risk ratio value, which represents the estimated coefficients, 2 = S.E: denotes robust standard error, 3 = p value: represents probability value of estimated model, 4 = Exp(B): denotes odd ratio computed as exponential of B (coefficient) **, ***Significance level at 5% and 1%, respectively\n1 3\nindicate that COVID-19 pandemic adversely and significantly influences work operation by nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria. Specifically, we find that the threat caused by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely influences the work operation by nonfarm household when the enterprise are not closed but insignificant when HNEs are permanently closed. In addition, we find that coping strategy like washing hands with soap is an important driver of work operation. This suggests that when the enterprise is not closed, washing hands with soap during the pandemic is an important factor of work operation by nonfarm household enterprises than when the enterprise is permanently closed. The results also show that food consumption is not a significant factor in terms of coping strategy in influencing work operation of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria. This suggests that food consumption pattern does not influence the work operation when the enterprise is not closed and permanently closed. These findings indicate that there is a need for policies that will enhance the work operation of nonfarm household enterprises in Nigeria, especially during or after COVID-19 pandemic. Such policies should not be avoided because of its relevance in improving the work operation. Some of these policies should focus on government intervention to ensure that adequate medical services are provided to the public. This can be possible through suitable appointment and recruitment of qualified medical practitioners, improved live condition of the people through income improvement and public awareness of the pandemic through conferences, seminars and workshops. Another policy recommendation is to support regular hand wash especially in a strategic places such as offices, market places and public gathering. This can only come to reality through enforcement on the public for effective compliance of the policy. Government can equally provide equipment and enabling environment that will drive the coping strategy of hand wash. These policy recommendations are to ensure that nonfarm household enterprises remain in operation on a sustainable basis, especially during this period of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This study also recommends that washing of hands should be promoted through adequate budget provisions and implementation.\nThe limitations of this study are focused on the issue of poor funding on the part of government and foreign agencies. Adequate funding is required to guarantee research motivation.\nData availability The data for this study are available on request.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest All the authors included in this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose."
