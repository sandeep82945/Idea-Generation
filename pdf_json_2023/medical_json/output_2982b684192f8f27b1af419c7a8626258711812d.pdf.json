It has been confirmed that in the general population, an elevated RC level is related to a 5-fold higher risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors for PAD development. However, the association between RC and PAD in the specific population of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been investigated. Herein, the correlation was investigated between RC and PAD in T2DM patients.\nMethods: In the retrospective study, the hematological parameter data of 246 T2DM patients without PAD (T2DM - WPAD) and 270 T2DM patients with PAD (T2DM - PAD) was collected. Differences in RC levels between the two groups were compared, and the association between RC and PAD severity was examined. Multifactorial regression was used to determine whether RC was a significant contributor to the development of T2DM - PAD. The diagnostic potential of RC was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nResults: The RC levels in T2DM - PAD individuals were considerably greater than in T2DM - WPAD individuals (P < 0.001). RC had a positive correlation with disease severity. Further, multifactorial logistic regression analyses found that elevated RC levels were a major contributor to T2DM - PAD (P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the RC for T2DM - PAD patients was 0.727. The cut-off value of RC was 0.64 mmol/L.\nConclusion: The RC levels were higher in T2DM - PAD patients, and were independently linked with its severity. Diabetic patients with RC levels > 0.64 mmol/L had an elevated risk of developing PAD.\nKEYWORDS\ntype 2 diabetes, peripheral artery disease, remnant cholesterol, risk factor, lipid\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "PAD is a chronic arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs caused by atherosclerosis and is linked with substantial disability and death (1). T2DM is a main factor in the progression of atherosclerosis. The incidence of PAD rises in tandem with the occurrence of T2DM (2). In addition, diabetic people have a worse prognosis for PAD than non-diabetic ones (1). Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment of PAD in diabetic subjects are necessary to reduce the danger of major adverse limb events (MALEs) (2).The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is currently recommended as the primary screening tool for PAD in diabetic patients and those with multiple risk factors (3). The ABI\u2019s limited sensitivity in detecting PAD in its earliest stage highlights the critical need to discover new markers that may detect PAD in diabetics at an earlier stage.\nRC is the cholesterol in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and consists of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediatedensity lipoproteins (IDL), and chylomicron remnants (4). RC-level assessment can be easily calculated using established formulas, which are easy-to-access, and may provide valuable data for clinical management (5). Evidence from large prospective cohort studies based on the general population suggests a causal relationship between high remnant cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease(CVD), and it is well established that lowering these lipoproteins reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in humans (6\u20138). Recent studies have confirmed the atherogenic potential of RC, however, many of these studies focused on elevated RC levels in coronary arterial disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease, demonstrating an association between elevated RC levels and the risk of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke (8\u201310). Interestingly, a recent investigation showed that in the general population, an elevated RC level was associated with a five-fold higher risk of PAD, greater than for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (10). High RC levels are common in diabetic individuals and has been linked to atherosclerosis through lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (11). It\u2019s intriguing to speculate about whether or not RC also plays a part in the development of PAD in diabetics. Nevertheless, until now, there has been no study on whether there is a correlation between RC and PAD in T2DM population. The aim of the research was to examine whether higher RC levels were related to higher PAD risk among T2DM individuals."

T2DM patients with or without PAD were recruited. T2DM\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 02\nwas defined as a fasting plasma glucose(FPG) level \u2265 7.0 mmol/L and/or 2-h plasma glucose(PG) \u226511.1 mmol/L during OGTT and/ or HbA1c level \u2265 6.5%, based on the T2DM international criteria (ADA) (12). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18-79 years with a confirmed diagnosis of T2DM. The excluding criteria were: a) coronary artery disease (CAD); b) history of stoke; c) diabetic retinopathy; d) acute complications of diabetes mellitus (such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia hyperosmotic state, and lactic acidosis); e) chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min; f) documented liver cirrhosis with Child\u2013Pugh C dysfunction; g) history of active solid or hematological malignancy or autoimmune diseases; h) ABI > 1.4; i)RC < 0; j) suspected or confirmed pregnancy; k) undefined type of diabetes or clinical suspicion of non-type 2 diabetes mellitus; l) previous non-traumatic lower limb amputation; m) incomplete clinical data.\nEach patient included in the study was evaluated for a history of PAD symptoms. The ABI was measured in patients with PAD-like symptoms. ABI was calculated according to the Transatlantic InterSociety Consensus Document II (TASC-II) guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial disease (13). ABI was calculated as the ratio of ankle-to-brachial artery systolic pressure. ABI was computed by dividing the highest systolic pressure recorded in either the right or left brachial arteries or the anterior or posterior tibial arteries in each limb (14). The physician evaluated the patients\u2019 lower extremities using arterial Dopplerenhanced ultrasonography if they had symptoms in both legs. Patients with an ABI > 0.90 who were asymptomatic were not additionally evaluated for PAD.\nPatients whose ABI < 0.9 underwent arterial Doppler-enhanced ultrasonography of the limb extremities. The common femoral artery, femoral artery bifurcation, popliteal artery, posterior tibial artery, and dorsalis pedis artery were examined. The evaluation and score of vascular pathology were as follows: a) Artery intima thickness: normal (< 1 mm), 0 point; moderately thickened (1 \u2013 1.2 mm), 1 point; severely thickened (> 1.2 mm), 2 points. b) Hardening: normal, 0 point; mildly hardened (the intima was not thickened, the echo was increased, and with no plaque), 1 point; moderately to severely hardened (mildly hardened, accompanied with plaque or stenosis), 2 points. c) Plaque: normal (no plaque forming), 0 point; single plaque, 1 point; numerous plaques, 2 points; scattered plaques, 3 points. d) Stenosis: normal, 0 point; mild stenosis (narrowing by 30%\u201350%), 1 point; moderate or severe stenosis (narrowing by 50% \u2013 75%), 2 points; occlusion (no blood flow), 3 points. The degree of PAD was categorized based on the total number of points: a) 0 point, normal; b) < 10 mild; c) 10 \u2013 20 points, moderate; d) > 20 points, severe (15)."

The incidence of mild, moderate, and severe PAD was 50.7, 23.3, and 25.9% in PAD patients, respectively.\nClinical and laboratory features of T2DM - PAD patients: Subgroup analysis according to PAD severity\nThe three groups did not differ regarding gender, duration of diabetes, history of smoking, drinking, and dyslipidemia, SBP, DBP, and laboratory parameters such as ALT, AST, urea, Cr, FPG, HbA1c, TC, LDL-C, N-HDL-C, TyG index, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, NLR, and MLR (P > 0.05) (Table 2). As disease severity increased, history of hypertension, eGFR, and HDLC presented a decreasing trend (P < 0.05), but TG, RC, platelets, and PHR showed an increasing trend (P < 0.05). Moderate PAD patients had the highest levels of age, uric acid, and CRP (P < 0.05). Significant differences were found between the three groups using only oral medication or only insulin (P < 0.05).\nThe violin - plot in Figure 1 found that the RC levels showed an\nincreasing relationship with disease extent.\nCorrelation of RC and other lipid variables with severity levels of T2DM \u2013 PAD\nThe correlations between RC and other lipid variables were assessed by utilizing spearman correlation analysis (including TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and N-HDL-C) in PAD patients. Based on the data in Table 3, RC (r = 0.387, P < 0.001), TG (r = 0.151, P = 0.013), and HDL-C (r = -0.197, P < 0.001) were associated with the PAD severity levels. RC still maintained connections with PAD stages after adjusting for TG and/or HDL-C using partial correlation analysis.\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of RC for T2DM - PAD occurrence\nAs univariate logistic regression analysis showed (Table 4), age, duration of diabetes, history of hypertension, SBP, DBP, ALT, urea, Cr, eGFR, HDL-C, CRP, RC, NLR, MLR, and PHR were independently associated with PAD occurrence in T2DM patients (P < 0.05). After excluding the effects of confounding factors for multivariate logistic regression, age, duration of diabetes, HDL-C, RC, NLR, MLR, and PHR were still statistically significant.

The main conclusions were as follows: (1) RC levels had a positive association with the occurrence and severity of PAD, and RC was independently related to an increased risk of PAD in T2DM patients; (2) diabetic patients with RC levels > 0.64 mmol/L had an elevated risk of developing PAD.\nPatients with T2DM and PAD have a cardiovascular mortality risk five times higher than patients with only one disease (17, 18). Hence, effective early screening and identification of T2DM - PAD individuals is crucial (19). Several potential biomarkers have been detected for PAD in diabetic patients, including HMGB 1, OPG, FGF 23, Omentin-1, Cyr61, and Sortilin (20\u201324). However, there are several limitations to obtaining these data in daily clinical practice. RC can be easily obtained using standard laboratory indices and may have substantial clinical use.\nLDL-C is an established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (25). However, a high residual risk of CVD persists even in patients whose LDL-C levels meet therapeutic targets after statin therapy, as established by multiple recent meta-analyses (26, 27). RC may be an important contributor of this residual risk (28). In this study, RC levels were significantly higher in the PAD group than in the WPAD group, and LDL-C"

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that the goal level of LDL be below 1.8 mmol/L with an LDL-C reduction of \u2265 50% from baseline (29). Unfortunately, LDL-C levels failed to meet the established criteria in both groups of patients. In the Supplementary Material, the two groups were divided respectively based on the use of statins or not. In the subgroups, LDL-C levels decreased significantly, whereas there was no statistical difference in RC levels. The results indicated that statins did not have a substantial effect on RC levels in T2DM patients with or without PAD (See Supplementary Tables 1, 2). Previous clinical studies have shown that statins reduce RC levels in patients with CAD (30, 31). A prospective cohort with a larger sample size is necessary to see\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 07\nwhether statins reduce RC levels in patients with PAD. Comparing the PAD and WPAD groups of patients with LDL-C at the target level, a significant difference in RC levels was found. Elevated RC levels might explain the residual risk of PAD in DM patients with LDL-C level < 1.8 mmol/L (See Supplementary Table 3).\nIn this study, the severity of PAD was graded based on ultrasound measurements, which showed a positive correlation between RC levels and severity (Figure 1). Patients were also classified according to the severity of their clinical symptoms using the Fontaine classification (32); however, there was no link between the RC levels and the Fontaine classification. This finding provided more evidence that RC should be promoted in clinical settings alongside ultrasonography results for patient evaluation\nRC, remnant cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; TC, total cholesterol; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; N-HDL-C, non-HDL-C.

After adjusting for other factors in the lipid profile using partial correlation analysis (all P < 0.001), a significant connection was found between RC and ultrasound grading. (Table 3)\nThemultifactorial regression, excluding the effects of confounding factors, showed that RC was independently associated with T2DM - PAD. This study also demonstrated that age and duration of diabetes were independent risk factors, consistent with previous studies (19). The roles of lipid metabolism and inflammation in atherosclerosis are well-established. It is generally accepted that NLR and MLR can be evaluated as inflammatory markers (33, 34). The platelet to HDL-C ratio as a novel inflammatory index has also garnered attention (35). The research also showed that HDL-C was a protective factor, and that NLR, MLR, and PHR were independent risk factors for PAD (Table 4). The ability of RC to predict T2DM - PAD was examined by using ROC curve, and the AUC was 0.727. The cut-off value was 0.64 mmol/L, indicating that diabetic patients with RC > 0.64 mmol/L had an elevated risk of developing PAD.\nThe TyG index, a surrogate for insulin resistance, is significantly related to the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-orthoglycemic clamp (36) and can be a reliable assessment of insulin resistance in patients. RC has been explored to be linked to insulin resistance (37). TyG index showed a correlation with RC (r = 0.485, P < 0.001) (Table 5), so it could be speculated that elevated RC levels in T2DM - PAD patients might be mediated by insulin resistance. In addition, one of the key mechanisms of pathogenesis for T2DM - PAD is the hypo-inflammatory response (38). It is worth noting that RC can also cause an inflammatory response, resulting in vascular endothelial damage (5). As shown in Table 5, CRP, NLR, MLR, and PHR levels were elevated in the T2DM - PAD individuals, but only PHR was significantly linked to RC (r = 0.123, P = 0.044). The correlation between inflammation and RC needs to be further verified by a large-scale investigation.\nThe fact that RC leads to atherosclerosis is the most likely cause of the link between raised RC levels and an increased risk of PAD (39). As with LDL particles, RCmay enter the endothelium, where they are predominantly trapped because of their relatively large size (40), leading to the development of atherosclerosis as a result of cholesterol levels (39). Elevated RC levels are considered a risk factor for endothelial vasodilator dysfunction and can upregulate endothelial\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 08\nexpression of endothelial-derived proatherogenic thrombogenic molecules via redox mechanisms (41, 42).It was reported that at high glucose concentrations, endothelial cells showed increased expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1), thereby increasing vascular dysfunction (43). Interestingly, RC stimulated NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide formation and induction of cytokines in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via activation of LOX-1, thereby exacerbating atherosclerosis (44). Furthermore, LOX-1-mediated uptake of RC plays important roles in atherogenesis by inducing LOX-1 expression and vascular smooth muscle cell migration, especially in the context of postprandial hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (45). It could be hypothesized that in patients with DM and PAD, RC might also\nFIGURE 2 ROC curve analysis of the ability of RC to predict T2DM \u2013 PAD. RC, remnant cholesterol.

Further studies are needed to determine the specific mechanism of action.\nHowever, this current study also has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in a single center, unable to determine the causal relationship between disease and RC. Second, the data were collected from clinical databases, and direct measurement of RC has not yet become a routine test for clinical lipid testing. Therefore, only get the calculated RC levels could be obtained. Calculated and measured RC are closely related (46, 47). Previous studies have shown that calculated RC underestimates the risk of myocardial infarction compared to directly measured RC (48). Nevertheless, calculated RC can be easily obtained from available lipid measurements at no additional cost, and therefore has a strong clinical utility. Third, although the non-fasting RC is critical in the development of atherosclerosis (49), only fasting RC levels were considered, possibly ignoring the possible results of non-fasting RC levels (6).Further prospective studies are required to analyze whether RC accelerates atherosclerosis progression."
