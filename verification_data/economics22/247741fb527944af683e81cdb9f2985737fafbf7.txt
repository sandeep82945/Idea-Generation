"Lastly, our study also considers the demand-side effect of environmental initiatives. We consider that firms (namely, the manufacturer and supplier) operate in a market where consumers are environmentally friendly. In the last few decades, consumers’ preferences for green products have led to additional implications for firms. Studies have shown that there are consumer segments that are environmentally conscious and prefer green products. For many firms, this signals an opportunity to drive product changes and target such consumer markets [8–10]. We, therefore, consider consumer demand to be positively affected by the level of the greenness of a product. An eco-friendly or green product by definition is one, which consumes fewer resources during production and emits less carbon [2, 11, 12]. Therefore, we consider a model of consumer demand, which depends on the product’s green level, which is measured by reduced carbon emissions. The higher the reduction in carbon emissions, the greener the product."
