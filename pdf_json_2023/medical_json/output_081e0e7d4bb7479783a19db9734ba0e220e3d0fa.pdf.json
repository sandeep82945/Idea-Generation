    "abstractText": "19 Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a specific form of autophagy that selectively 20 targets proteins containing a KFERQ-like motif and relies on the chaperone protein HSC70 for 21 substrate recognition. In \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a disease characterized by the 22 hepatic build-up of \u03b11-Antitrypsin Z mutant (ATZ), CMA\u2019s role had been unclear. This work 23 demonstrates the critical role that CMA plays in preventing ATZ accumulation; suppressing 24 CMA worsens ATZ accumulation, whilst activating it through chemical stimulation or 25 LAMP2A overexpression promotes ATZ breakdown. Specifically, ATZ\u2019s 121QELLR125 motif 26 is critical for HSC70 recognition and LAMP2A's charged C-terminal cytoplasmic tail is vital 27 for substrate binding, facilitating CMA-mediated degradation of ATZ. This selective activation 28 of CMA operates independently from other autophagy pathways and alleviate ATZ aggregates 29 caused cellular stress. These findings highlight CMA's critical function in cellular protein 30 quality control of ATZ and place it as a novel target for AATD treatment approaches. 31 32 33 34 35",

            "text": "Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a specific form of autophagy that selectively 20 targets proteins containing a KFERQ-like motif and relies on the chaperone protein HSC70 for 21 substrate recognition. In \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a disease characterized by the 22 hepatic build-up of \u03b11-Antitrypsin Z mutant (ATZ), CMA\u2019s role had been unclear. This work 23 demonstrates the critical role that CMA plays in preventing ATZ accumulation; suppressing 24 CMA worsens ATZ accumulation, whilst activating it through chemical stimulation or 25 LAMP2A overexpression promotes ATZ breakdown. Specifically, ATZ\u2019s 121QELLR125 motif 26 is critical for HSC70 recognition and LAMP2A's charged C-terminal cytoplasmic tail is vital 27 for substrate binding, facilitating CMA-mediated degradation of ATZ. This selective activation 28 of CMA operates independently from other autophagy pathways and alleviate ATZ aggregates 29 caused cellular stress. These findings highlight CMA's critical function in cellular protein 30 quality control of ATZ and place it as a novel target for AATD treatment approaches. 31 32 33 34 35 Keywords 36 Chaperone-mediated autophagy, alpha-1 antitrypsin, protein degradation, LAMP2A, 37 HSC70 38 39\n40 Introduction 41\nThe autophagy-lysosome pathway is a major protein aggregate clearance mechanism that 42 is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. This system can be classified into three main types based 43 on their distinctive digestion processes: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-44 mediated autophagy (CMA)[1]. Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy) and 45 microautophagy non-selectively engulf various substrates, whereas CMA specifically targets 46 proteins containing the CMA-targeting KFERQ motif [2,3]. In CMA pathway, the heat shock 47 cognate protein of 70 kDa (HSC70, also known as HSPA8) recognizes the KFERQ motif of 48 substrate to form a substrate\u2013chaperone complex [4], the complex was then delivered to 49 lysosome surface to interact with the CMA specific receptor lysosome-associated membrane 50 protein type 2A (LAMP2A). The LAMP2A in charge of delivering substrates directly to the 51 lysosomal lumen for degradation [4,5]. Increasing evidence suggests that CMA plays a crucial 52 role in various of physiological processes; CMA malfunction has been linked to a variety of 53 diseases including neurodegenerative illnesses, metabolic disorders, lysosomal storage 54 disorders and cancer [3] . 55 Alpha one antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serum protease inhibitor primarily synthesized in the 56 liver and serves as a pulmonary neutrophil elastase neutralizer to protect the lung from self-57 elastolytic digestion. Thus, it plays a critical role in maintaining proper pulmonary proteolytic-58 inhibitor balance[6,7]. A1AT is a highly polymorphic protein, over 120 mutations in the 59 SERPINA1 gene have been identified and most mutation caused disease pathogenesis manifests 60 as pulmonary emphysema because the loss of function as elastase neutralizer. These mutated 61 A1AT caused manifestation is called alpha one antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). One genetic 62 mutation result for a mutant protein ATZ with a E342K substitution exert the most sever 63 phenotype. ATZ has misfolded conformation and prone to aggregate into insoluble polymers 64 and The abnormal ATZ polymerization could result in liver cirrhosis [7,8]. Lung diseases 65 resulting from AATD are treated with intravenous infusions of A1AT from donated human 66 plasma , but this therapy does not mitigate liver damage caused by hepatic ATZ aggregates [9]. 67 It has been established that, the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome and autophagy\u2013lysosomal pathways 68 represent the two major routes for ATZ\u2019s bio-digestion [10,11]. Enhancing autophagy using 69\nchemical compounds have all been shown to prohibit A1AT protein accumulation and 70 alleviating cell injury[12]. To date, there have been no studies exploring the role of CMA in the 71 regulation of ATZ catabolism. Theoretically, proteins with KFERQ motif could be recognized 72 by HSC70 and delivered for CMA degradation. Searching the sequence of ATZ, there is a 73 typical pentapeptide motifs within the ATZ sequence and those amino acids are exposed on the 74 surface of the protein molecular. This observation leads us to speculate that ATZ could be 75 targeted for CMA, and manipulating CMA might offer a solution for ATZ digestion, preventing 76 substantial polymerization. 77 78 Material and methods: 79\nCell culture and plasmids transfection 80\nHEK 293 and HepG2 cells were obtained from the National Collection of Authenticated 81 Cell Cultures in Shanghai, China. The HeLa ATG16L1-/- and HeLa BECLIN1-/- cell lines were 82 provided by Dr. Yue Xu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. All cells were cultured in 83 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM\uff0cFI101-01, TransGen Biotech) supplemented 84 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS\uff0cFI101-04, TransGen Biotech), 50 IU penicillin, and 50 85 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin under conditions of 37\u00b0C with a CO2 concentration of 5%. Following the 86 manufacturer's instructions for transfection reagents (Lip8000, Beyotime), cells at a confluence 87 level of approximately 70% to 80% underwent plasmid transfection. Cells were then harvested 88 for further analysis after 48 to 72 hours post-transfection. 89\nAntibodies and Chemicals 90\nA1AT(8H10L18\uff0cThermoFisher), LC3(AL221, Beyotime), Flag(AE005, AE169, 91 ABclonal), ATG16L1(AE3637, ABclonal), BECLIN1(A21191, ABclonal), \u03b2-Actin(AC026, 92 ABclonal), LAMP2A(AF1036, Beyotime), HRP Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (AS014, 93 ABclonal), HRP Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)(AS003, ABclonal), ABflo\u00ae 594-conjugated 94 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (AS054, ABclonal), ABflo\u00ae 488-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit 95 IgG (H+L) (AS053, ABclonal) Cycloheximide(01810, Sigma), DMSO(D8371, Solarbo), 96 puromycin(P8230, Solarbo), streptomycin(P1400, Solarbo), AR7(HY-101106, 97\nMedChemExpress), QX77(HY-112483, MedChemExpress), MG-132(HY-13259, 98 MedChemExpress), Chloroquine(HY-17589A, MedChemExpress). 99\n100\nMolecular cloning and ShRNA knockdown 101\nLAMP2A and HSC70 were cloned into pCDH-CMV (72265, Addgene) by PCR amplifying 102 the ORFs from cDNA templates of HSC70 (19514, Addgene) and LAMP2A (86146, Addgene), 103 followed by digestion with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. The molecular cloning was 104 performed using T4 DNA ligase and the resulting constructs were transformed into DH5\u03b1 E. 105 coli cells. Plasmid purification and extraction steps were carried out using the Endo Free Mini 106 Plasmid Kit II (DP118, TIANGEN). ShRNA sequences are detailed in supplementary Figure 1, 107 and the corresponding shRNA plasmids were transfected into cells using Lip8000 transfection 108 reagent (C0533FT, Beyotime), following the manufacturer's protocol. 109\nCloning of lentiviral expression constructs 110\nTo develop GFP-ATZ and LAMP2A-expressing HEK 293 cells in a stable manner within 111 the pCDH-CMV vector using lentivirus, the LAMP2A and ATZ genes were amplified by PCR, 112 specifically targeting the ORFs from the cDNA templates of LAMP2A or SERPINA1. The 113 resulting cDNA insert of pCDH-CMV was then sub-cloned into the lentiviral backbone plasmid 114 pCHD-CMV-IRES-pur, thus constructing the pCDH-CMV-GFP-ATZ or pCDH-CMV-115 LAMP2A plasmids. To generate lentiviral particles expressing the pCDH-CMV-GFP-ATZ or 116 pCDH-CMV-LAMP2A plasmids, the corresponding constructs were co-transfected with the 117 VSV-G and PVSV-2 helper plasmids into HEK 293 cells. The transfected cells were cultured 118 for 4 days to ensure sufficient expression time. Subsequently, the culture medium containing 119 viral particles was collected, filtered to remove debris, and used to infect HEK 293 cells, 120 inducing efficient expression of the target proteins within the host cells. 121\nDiscovery and Mutations of the CMA Recognition Motif \"KFERQ-like Pentapeptide\" 122\nTo demonstrate the involvement of CMA recognition motif, the complete amino acid 123\nsequence of the SERPINA1 gene was obtained by accessing the UniProt database (P01009). A 124 search was performed using the web server \"KFERQ finder V0.8\" 125 \uff08https://rshine.einsteinmed.edu/\uff09to identify pentapeptide sequences associated with the 126 CMA recognition motif. Within the amino acid sequence of SERPINA1 (A1AT), a canonical 127 pentapeptide fragment, QELLR, was found at positions 121-125. To modify the physical 128 properties of amino acids within the targeting motif, as described by Orenstein and Cuervo [13], 129 we introduced mutations into the CMA recognition motif (5'-CAGGAACTCCTCCGT-3') 130 resulting in 5'-GCGGCACTCCTCCGT-3'. The mutated motif was then sub-cloned into a 131 pCDH-CMV plasmid. 132\nFractionation of Cytoplasmic Soluble Proteins and Aggregates 133\nThe cells were lysed using RIPA lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 13,000g for 10 134 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic soluble fraction, and the pellet 135 was resuspended in lysis buffer containing an additional 2% SDS. The resuspended pellet was 136 further homogenized by puncturing with a 28-gauge needle ten times. 137\nImmunoblotting 138\nCell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer to extract total protein. The obtained lysates 139 were then subjected to centrifugation at 17,000g for 20 minutes at 4\u2103 to separate the soluble 140 lysates from the insoluble microspheres. Protein concentrations were determined using the 141 Bicinchoninic acid method, as directed by the manufacturer's instructions using the Pierce BCA 142 protein assay kit (23235, Thermo). Equal amounts of protein were transferred to a 143 polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel 144 electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4\u2103, 145 followed by incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 45 minutes. Blot 146 was performed using a chemiluminescence kit (BeyoECL Plus P0018S, Beyotime) and visual 147 detection was performed using a western blotting detection system (Tienong 5200, China). The 148 gray values of protein bands in each group were subsequently quantified using ImageJ software, 149 and the ratio of target bands to \u03b2-actin bands was utilized as the measure of protein expression 150\nlevel. The experiment was repeated three times with distinct protein samples. 151\nImmunoprecipitation 152\nTo obtain the whole cell extract, the cells were treated with lysis buffer containing protease 153 inhibitor, and the resulting supernatant was collected. Magnetic beads (AC047, AE097, 154 ABclonal) were pre-treated with antibody binding and subsequently mixed thoroughly with the 155 extracted total cell protein samples. The mixture was then subjected to rotational agitation and 156 incubated overnight at 4\u2103 to facilitate the formation of immune complexes. The protein-bound 157 magnetic beads were isolated using a magnetic separation rack, and the supernatant from the 158 heated beads was analyzed through SDS-PAGE and western blot. 159\nImmunofluorescence 160\nThe cells were washed three times with pre-chilled PBS (P1020, Solarbio), for 1 minute 161 each time. Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 minutes in an immunostaining 162 fixation solution (P0098, Beyotime) and then underwent three additional washes with PBS, 163 each lasting 5 minutes. Following a 25-minute incubation at room temperature in an 164 immunostaining permeabilization solution (Triton X-100, P0096, Beyotime), the cells were 165 again washed three times with PBS for 5 minutes each. Next, the cells were permeabilized, and 166 non-specific sites were blocked using an immunostaining blocking solution (P0102, Beyotime) 167 at room temperature for 1 hour. The primary antibodies, diluted in an immunostaining primary 168 antibody dilution solution (P0103, Beyotime), were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. On the 169 following day, the primary antibodies were removed, and a wash with immunostaining washing 170 solution (P0106, Beyotime) was performed on the cells. Subsequently, the cells were incubated 171 at room temperature for 1 hour with secondary antibodies, diluted in an immunostaining 172 secondary antibody dilution solution (P0108, Beyotime). The cells were washed three times 173 with PBS. Finally, the cells were mounted onto slides using a fluorescence decay mounting 174 medium containing DAPI (S2110, Solarbio). Confocal microscopy images were captured, 175 processed using a laser scanning confocal microscope\uff08TCS SP5II, Leica\uff09, and analyzed 176 using ImageJ. 177\nCellular GFP-ATZ protein clearance rate assessed by flow cytometry 178\nHEK 293 cells expressing GFP-ATZ were transfected with a plasmid for 48 hours. After 179 centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed using 180 FACScan flow cytometry (BD LSR Fortessa X-20) for GFP fluorescence (488-nm laser 181 excitation, 530/30 filter for detection). A total of 3\u00d7105 cells underwent scanning to exclude 182 cellular debris based on forward and side-angle scatters (FSC and SSC). Cells expressing GFP 183 were gated, and the percentage depletion of GFP-positive cells was calculated relative to the 184 control group. The clearance rate of GFP-ATZ protein is assessed by measuring the average 185 fluorescence intensity. The clearance rate of GFP-ATZ protein is assessed by measuring the 186 average fluorescence intensity. 187 188\nCycloheximide Chase Analysis 189\nThe CHX chase experiments involved a 48-hour cell culture period following plasmid 190 transfection. Protein synthesis was blocked using CHX treatment at a concentration of 100 191 \u03bcg/ml.

It involved utilizing 211 the clusterProfiler package (v.4.5.0) in R software (v.4.2.2), as described by Wu et al [14]. 212 Hiplot Pro served as the platform for importing and analyzing the data, while clusterProfiler 213 facilitated various bioinformatics analyses. The analysis was carried out by using R software 214 (v.4.2.2) package clusterProfiler (v.4.5.0) through Hiplot Pro (https://hiplot.com.cn/). 215 Enrichment items with corrected p\uff1c0.05 were considered significantly enriched. 216 217\nMitochondrial condition measurements 218\nCellular mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the Mitochondrial 219 Membrane Potential Assay Kit (Beyotime, C2001S) with the TMRE dye. The principle of this 220 assay kit is based on the response of TMRE dye to changes in mitochondrial membrane 221 potential within cells. TMRE, a mitochondria-specific fluorescent probe with red fluorescence, 222 exhibits distinct fluorescence signals upon binding to ATP within the mitochondria [15]. Cells 223 were washed three times with chilled PBS and then incubated with TMRE fluorescent dye at 224 37\u2103 for 30 minutes. Fluorescence intensity was measured using fluorescence microscopy and 225 flow cytometry, with an excitation wavelength of 550nm and an emission wavelength of 575nm. 226\nCell Viability 227\nTo assess cell viability, the Cell Titer-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay kit was used. 228 The amount of ATP inside the cells was measured to indicate cellular metabolic activity. The 229\nassay measures the luminescent signal produced by the conversion of ATP to adenosine 230 monophosphate (AMP) by the enzyme luciferase[16]. The treated cells were mixed with the 231 reagent and agitated to induce cell lysis. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature 232 to stabilize the luminescent signal. The luminescence intensity was recorded using the BioTek 233 Synergy Neo2 multimode microplate reader. 234\nStatistical analysis 235\nThe statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad 236 Software). The experimental data was presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Comparisons between two 237 groups were conducted by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test for parametric data, and 238 comparisons between multiple groups were conducted by one-way ANOVA. Statistical 239 significance was set at p\uff1c0.05.*; p\uff1c0.01.**; p\uff1c0.001.***; p\uff1c0.0001.****; NC, no 240 significance. 241 242 Results: 243\nCMA influence homeostasis of wide type and Mutant \u03b11-Antitrypsin Z 244\nIn CMA, its activity is primarily modulated by changes in the levels of LAMP2A at the 245 lysosomal membrane[3]. To evaluate CMA's influence on ATZ, a stable cell line was created to 246 express GFP-ATZ, which was subsequently transfected with incremental quantities of the 247 LAMP2A-encoding plasmid. This resulted in a dose-dependent diminution of GFP-ATZ 248 protein levels corresponding to the augmented expression of exogenous LAMP2A (Figure 1A, 249 B). Simultaneously, a reduction in the standard CMA substrate GAPDH was observed, 250 suggestive of enhanced CMA activity (Figure 1B). 251 Due to its aggregation-prone properties, the mutant protein ATZ leads to the formation of 252 insoluble protein inclusions[17]. We thus resuspended the cell pellet in cell lysis buffer 253 containing 2% SDS and dissect the CMA\u2019s effect on insoluble ATZ. Unlike A1AT, we observed 254 an aberrant amount of ATZ in the insoluble fraction. However, with the expression of LAMP2A, 255 the insoluble ATZ level also significantly reduced (Figure 1C). Additionally, transfecting 256 LAMP2A into the HepG2 hepatic cell line, which naturally expresses A1AT, resulted in a 257\nsignificant decline in endogenous A1AT levels upon LAMP2A overexpression (Figure 1D). 258 This indicates that LAMP2A overexpression disrupts the homeostasis of both wild-type A1AT 259 and ATZ. 260 To further validate the regulatory effect of LAMP2A on ATZ, we attempted to manipulate 261 the endogenous levels of LAMP2A. We designed two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that 262 specifically target the cytosolic tail of the LAMP2A transcript, a region that differs between 263 Lamp2 gene isoforms A and B, C (Supplementary Figure 1A\uff0c1B). After transfecting the cells 264 expressing GFP-ATZ with the two shRNA-coded vectors for 48 hours, a significant (>70%) 265 reduction in LAMP2A mRNA levels was observed compared to cells treated with a scrambled 266 shRNA, while no noticeable changes were detected in the transcripts of LAMP2B and 267 LAMP2C (Supplementary Figure 1C,1D). Moreover, in the same samples, we detected a 268 notable increase in GFP-ATZ protein levels (Figure 1E, 1F). 269 As the modulation of LAMP2A did not alter ATZ transcription (Supplementary Figure 270 2A), we speculate that the changes in ATZ levels may result from altered protein degradation 271 dynamics. To confirm this, we blocked protein synthesis in the ATZ expression cells with 272 cycloheximide (CHX) 24 hours after LAMP2A coding plasmids transfection and monitored the 273 remaining ATZ at different time points post the drug treatment. The results indicated an 274 accelerated degradation of ATZ in cells with LAMP2A overexpression, as evidenced by a 275 decrease in half-life from 8 to 6 hours (Figure 1G). Additionally, overexpression of HSC70, 276 another key component of CMA[4], also heightened the degradation of GFP-ATZ in a dose-277 dependent manner(Supplementary Figure 3A\u3001B). These experiments collectively suggest that 278 CMA plays a significant role in the proteostasis of both mutant ATZ and wild-type A1AT. 279\nATZ is degraded through the CMA pathway mediated by LAMP2A 280\nThe above assays have provided evidences supporting CMA's participation in regulating 281 ATZ's degradation, and we hypothesize that CMA directly targets ATZ for clearance. To 282 corroborate this hypothesis, we conducted a pull-down assay of ATZ-flag protein and confirmed 283 the association with LAMP2A (Figure 2A). Additionally, we stained endogenous LAMP2A and 284 examined its co-localization with ATZ. We observed distinct CMA puncta, as indicated by 285\nLAMP2A, and a significant overlap between GFP-ATZ and LAMP2A (Figure 2B). We also 286 examined the interaction between ATZ and HSC70 and found a potent binding of ATZ with 287 HSC70 (Supplementary Figure 3C). 288 The degradation of substrates by CMA relies on the acidic environment within lysosomes 289 [18]. To investigate whether ATZ degradation is dependent on the lysosome, we treated cells 290 overexpressing LAMP2A with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) for variable times. We 291 observed that the level of CQ blocked the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, leading to 292 accumulated levels of ATZ (Figure 2D). These evidences thus prove the directed accessibility 293 of CMA to ATZ and its mediation of degradation depending on lysosomal hydrolysis activity. 294 Consistent with this, we found that QX77[19], a CMA-specific activator, was able to boost 295 LAMP2A's level and eliminate the typical CMA substrate GAPDH, as well as GFP-ATZ 296 (Figure 2E). 297 The cytosolic tail of LAMP2A, comprising 12 amino acids, is essential for the recruitment 298 of HSC70-substrate complexes to lysosomes, facilitating their interaction via positively 299 charged residues [20,21]. To elucidate how LAMP2A recognizes ATZ, we engineered plasmids 300 for two LAMP2A variants: one encoding a truncated version lacking the C-terminal tail 301 (LAMP2A-truncate), and another encoding a mutant wherein positively charged amino acids 302 at positions 401 to 404 (401KHHH404) were substituted with alanines (401AAAA404) (Figure 303 2F\uff0cSupplementary Figure 4). These plasmids were introduced into cells expressing GFP-ATZ. 304 Our findings revealed that only the wild-type LAMP2A significantly reduced ATZ levels, 305 whereas both the LAMP2A-truncate and LAMP2A-mutant variants were ineffective (Figure 306 2G). Additionally, immunoprecipitation assays with Flag-tagged ATZ demonstrated markedly 307 reduced co-immunoprecipitation with the truncated and mutant forms of LAMP2A (Figure 2H). 308 These data further affirm that CMA facilitates ATZ degradation in a LAMP2A-dependent 309 manner, highlighting the critical role of the C-terminal cytosolic tail in mediating this 310 interaction. 311\nThe 121QELLR125 pentapeptide motif is crucial in CMA mediated ATZ degradation 312\nThe CMA pathway differs from autophagy in its distinct substrate preference. Substrates 313\ndegraded through the CMA pathway typically contain the classical \"KFERQ\" pentapeptide 314 sequence, which serves as a recognized site by HSC70[3]. Using the \"KFERQ finder V0.8\" 315 web server (https://rshine.einsteinmed.edu/), we identified a typical KFERQ motif 316 (121QELLR125) within the ATZ protein. To investigate the role of this specific motif, we 317 engineered a mutant variant, AA-ATZ (121AALLR125) (Figure 3A) and evaluated its binding 318 affinity to HSC70 and LAMP2A through a CO-IP assay. Remarkably, the mutant demonstrated 319 a marked decrease in binding to both LAMP2A and HSC70 compared to the ATZ protein 320 (Figure 3B, 3C). Immunofluorescence assays further substantiated the diminished interaction 321 between the mutant ATZ protein and LAMP2A (Figure 3D). 322 In addition, we observed that the basal protein level of AA-ATZ was significantly higher 323 than that of ATZ under the condition of equal transfection of ATZ or AA-ATZ plasmids, 324 regardless of whether LAMP2A was overexpressed or not (Figure 3E). We hypothesized that 325 this discrepancy was caused by the inefficient degradation of mutant AA-ATZ by CMA. To 326 prove this, we compared the degradation rate of ATZ with that of AA-ATZ under conditions of 327 high CMA activity with a CHX chasing experiment. The results showed that, indeed, with the 328 activation of CMA, the degradation rate of AA-ATZ was slower than ATZ, with a protein half-329 life reduced from 5.2 hours to 3.5 hours (Figure 3F). These results underscore the importance 330 of the CMA pentapeptide 121QELLR125 in ATZ for its degradation through the CMA pathway. 331 They further demonstrate that ATZ is bona fide substrate of CMA. 332\nCMA degrade ATZ independent of macroautophagy 333\nWith above assays, we confirmed that ATZ could be degraded via the CMA pathway. 334 However, there are complicated compensatory regulatory mechanisms between 335 macroautophagy and CMA [22-24]. To mitigate the influence of macroautophagy, we employed 336 autophagy-deficient HeLa ATG16L1-/- cells[25] to reassess our findings. In wild-type HeLa 337 cells, we observed that serum starvation not only activates CMA but also macroautophagy, as 338 indicated by increased levels of LAMP2A and LC3II, alongside enhanced ATZ degradation 339 (Figure 4A). Conversely, in HeLa ATG16L1-/- cells subjected to identical starvation conditions, 340 the absence of LC3II formation confirmed the disruption of autophagy, yet ATZ protein levels 341\nstill diminished (Figure 4B). Furthermore, in HeLa ATG16L1-/- cells, the overexpression of 342 exogenous LAMP2A resulted in dose-dependent degradation of ATZ, which was similarly 343 effective in wild-type alpha-1 antitrypsin A1AT and insoluble ATZ aggregates (Figures 4C, D). 344 By employing CMA-specific activators, AR7 and QX77 [26,27], we noted identical 345 degradation patterns for the prototypical CMA substrates GAPDH and ATZ (Figure 4E). 346 Further investigations into the pentapeptide's influence in autophagy-deficient cells showed that 347 AA-ATZ exhibited a lower degradation efficiency than ATZ (Figure 4F). These data suggesting 348 that CMA is capable of degrading ATZ independently of macroautophagy. 349 In addition to its role in autophagy, ATG16L1 has been implicated in anti-inflammatory 350 responses and the regulation of hormone secretion[28,29]. To rule out the influence of 351 ATG16L1's non-autophagic functions, we utilized another autophagy deficient model, the HeLa 352 BECLIN 1-/- cell line [30,31]. In the HeLa BECLIN 1-/- cells, a similar decrease in ATZ protein 353 levels was observed after inducing CMA through serum starvation and LAMP2A 354 overexpression (Figure 4G, H). Notably, this decline in ATZ persisted despite the inhibition of 355 the proteasome pathway when LAMP2A was overexpressed (Figure 4H). These findings lend 356 further support to the notion that CMA can independently facilitate the degradation of ATZ. 357\nCMA-mediated ATZ degradation mitigates cellular stress 358\nPrior research indicates that ATZ aggregates leads to the cellular toxicity including 359 mitochondrial damage[32]. We conducted a comparison of cell survival rates under normal 360 conditions and after activating CMA. Overexpression of LAMP2A and HSC70 in cell lines 361 stably expressing GFP-ATZ significantly improved cell viability (Figure 5A).Mitochondrial 362 membrane potential alterations serve as a critical metric for mitochondrial damage assessment 363 [33]. Using the TMRE probe to measure mitochondrial inner membrane potential[15], a notable 364 increase in fluorescence intensity was detected upon overexpression of LAMP2A and HSC70, 365 as compared to controls (Figure 5B,5C). This enhancement suggests a reestablishment of 366 mitochondrial integrity, implicating the potential of CMA activation in mitigating 367 mitochondrial damage. 368 Through transcriptome-wide analysis, we found that CMA activation via LAMP2A 369\noverexpression results in the upregulation of three genes and the downregulation of sixteen 370 genes (Figure 5D, Supplementary Table). Notably, genes implicated in apoptosis and oxidative 371 protein damage, such as DNAJB1, HSPA6, ANKRD1, and EDEM2, were markedly 372 downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further suggested that these 373 downregulated genes are predominantly associated with chaperone-mediated protein folding 374 (Figure 5E, Supplementary Figure 5). Additionally, KEGG pathway analysis underscored the 375 downregulated genes' roles in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 376 (Supplementary Figure 5). Considering the established function of heat shock proteins (HSPs) 377 in the management of protein misfolding and ER stress, we performed a cluster analysis of HSP 378 genes related to protein misfolding. The analysis revealed a decrease in the expression of 379 various HSP genes upon CMA activation (Figure 5F), suggesting that enhanced ATZ 380 degradation through CMA may alleviate ER stress and diminish the necessity for protein 381 chaperones. 382 383 Discussion 384\nA comprehensive understanding of the catabolic mechanism responsible for the 385 degradation of ATZ is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies for AATD. To date, the 386 degradation of ATZ has been associated with both the proteasome and autophagy-lysosome 387 pathways[34]. Multiple evidences indicated upregulated autophagic pathway in the AATD 388 pathologic cells, and augmentation of autophagy has been demonstrated to facilitate the 389 clearance of ATZ aggregates [11,35]. Furthermore, recent evidence has identified a 390 noncanonical ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation pathway (ERLAD) that transports ATZ 391 directly from the ER to the lysosome[36]. Despite this, the specific role of CMA in ATZ 392 catabolism remains to be fully elucidated. This study presents biochemical evidence confirming 393 CMA's role in ATZ degradation and elucidates its underlying mechanisms. 394 CMA is a selective process where the chaperone protein HSC70 recognizes misfolded 395 proteins, delivering them to LAMP2A for internalization. [37]. Our first piece of evidence 396 supporting the involvement of CMA in the regulation of ATZ comes from the finding that 397 LAMP2A directly interacts with ATZ and promotes its degradation (Figure 1 and 2). LAMP2A, 398 produced by alternative splicing of the LAMP2 gene, is the only isoform implicated in CMA 399\n[38,39]. The selective silencing of LAMP2A leads to increased ATZ levels, underscoring 400 CMA's unique role in managing ATZ (Figure 1). 401 The structural distinctions between LAMP2 isoforms are localized to their C-terminal 402 transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail's positively charged residues 403 are vital for substrate recognition in CMA [39]. Our research demonstrates that alterations to 404 the cytoplasmic tail, either through deletion or modification of these key amino acids, 405 compromise substrate binding and consequently hinder degradation (Figure 2G, H). This 406 corroborates previous research underscoring the critical role of the cytoplasmic tail in the 407 recognition of substrates by the CMA pathway. 408 CMA specific pentapeptide KFERQ motif in substrate is absolutely necessary for CMA 409 mediated degradation, because it serves as a recognition site for HSC70 binding [40]. In this 410 study, we identified a pentapeptide sequence, 121QELLR125, on ATZ and demonstrated that 411 modifications to this sequence significantly weaken the interactions among ATZ, HSC70, and 412 LAMP2A (Figure 3B, C). Variants of ATZ lacking this motif displayed a marked decrease in 413 degradation rate, resulting in significant accumulation, even under normal physiological 414 conditions (Figure 3E, F). The identification of 121QELLR125 motif further confirm ATZ as a 415 bona fide substrate for CMA. 416 Macroautophagy and CMA, both lysosomal-dependent digestion pathways, are 417 coordinately regulated in response to stress, with complex interplay and compensatory 418 mechanisms. For example, the activation of CMA has been observed to suppress 419 macroautophagy, while blocking CMA triggers an upregulation of macroautophagy [22,24]. 420 Conversely, the induction of macroautophagy has been shown to diminish CMA activity [23]. 421 In our study, we utilized two different autophagy-deficient cell lines to confirm that CMA acts 422 independently to degrade ATZ (Figure 4). Conventionally, it is believed that in AATD affected 423 cells, soluble ATZ is degraded by the proteasome system [10], whereas insoluble aggregates 424 are cleared by autophagy-lysosome pathways and the ERLAD pathway[11,35,36]. The 425 identification of CMA as a novel pathway for ATZ clearance brings us closer to achieving a 426 comprehensive understanding of the catabolic processes involved in ATZ metabolism. 427 Microautophagy is another cellular degradation pathway conserved in mammalian cells, 428 characterized by the direct engulfment of substrates by invagination of the lysosomal 429\nmembrane[41]. The available data allow us to conclude that ATZ is a substrate of CMA, as it 430 meets all the criteria for CMA substrates, including possessing the KFERQ-like pentapeptide, 431 interacting with HSC70 and LAMP2A, and undergoing digestion within the lysosome. But it 432 also raises another question: what is microautophagy\u2019s role in ATZ\u2019s catabolic regulation? 433 While the precise involvement of microautophagy remains to be conclusively determined, 434 emerging evidence suggests it could play a role in modulating ATZ levels. For example, 435 overexpression of HSC70 exerts a greater effect on the clearance of ATZ and overall cellular 436 recovery than LAMP2A overexpression does (Figure 5A). Such an effect is consistent with the 437 process of endosomal microautophagy (e-MI), which selectively engulfs soluble proteins that 438 present a KFERQ-like pattern, with HSC70 facilitation[42]. We postulate in that case 439 overexpressed HSC70 may redirect a portion of ATZ to e-MI for degradation, offering 440 additional cellular protection. Extensive research is necessary to thoroughly elucidating these 441 mechanisms in this regard. 442 ER stress and mitochondrial damage are two typical characteristics of ATZ-induced 443 cellular malfunctions[43,44]. In our study, we observed simultaneous alleviation of 444 mitochondrial damage and restoration of cellular growth status upon the effective activation of 445 CMA. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CMA activation marginally altered global gene 446 expression, with only 16 genes showing significant downregulation. Of these, four were 447 intimately linked to protein folding, suggests a rebalancing of proteostasis due to the reduced 448 presence of intracellular misfolded proteins [45]. The diminished expression of EDEM2, a gene 449 implicated in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation [46], hints at the 450 successful removing of misfolded proteins from the ER and a reduction in ER stress. Moreover, 451 notable decreases in the expression of DNAJB1 and ANKRD1 both associated with apoptotic 452 regulation[47] and ANKRD1[48], suggesting reduced cell apoptosis further confirming the 453 positive role played by CMA towards maintaining cellular viability (Figure 5). 454 However, it is important to note that CMA serves as an essential intracellular protein 455 degradation pathway. In theory, CMA targets proteins containing the KFERQ motif, which 456 accounts for approximately 30% of soluble cytosolic proteins. Enhancing CMA activity would 457 facilitate the removal of misfolded and oxidized proteins, and ultimately enhancing cellular 458 viability[22]. Hence, in this context, Thus, the observed cellular recovery should not be 459\nexclusively credited to ATZ aggregate removal but also acknowledged as a broader impact of 460 CMA in reducing general cellular stress by targeting various oxidized and misfolded proteins. 461 The aggregation of ATZ is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of AATD liver disease, 462 prompting various attempts to halt or reverse the aggregation process and mitigate AATD 463 progression. These strategies include inhibiting ATZ synthesis[49-51], enhancing secretion 464 [52,53], blocking polymerization [54,55] and promoting degradation [35,56]. The identification 465 of macroautophagy activation as a means to accelerate ATZ degradation has led to the 466 investigation of autophagy-boosting drugs such as carbamazepine, rapamycin, and 467 fluphenazine[12]. Our discovery of CMA involvement in the regulation of ATZ suggests that 468 specific enhancers of CMA may offer new therapeutic options for AATD. Since the discovery 469 of CMA pathway, there have been many attempts to discover small molecules for CMA 470 manipulation. In recent years, a series of small molecular drugs that can activate CMA have 471 been found. However, most CMA activators interfere with other cellular pathways, often 472 causing disturbance in essential cellular processes, including biomaterial metabolism or protein 473 synthesis, which hinders their application[57]. AR7 and QX77 both derivatives of retinoic acid, 474 stands out as the most effective CMA inducer developed thus far [19,27]. 475 In our model, we found the treatment with AR7 and QX77, enhancing CMA activity and 476 clearing ATZ in both normal and autophagy-deficient cells (Figure1E and 4E). This finding 477 suggests that CMA-specific activators could serve as potential small-molecule drug therapies 478 for AATD. Previous studies conducted with Alzheimer's disease mice have also demonstrated 479 the clearance of pathological proteins when treated with AR7 derivatives, thereby providing 480 support for their potential therapeutic implications [58]. Thus, performing future in vivo studies 481 to investigate the impact of these CMA activators on ATZ clearance in animal models would 482 hold significant value, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of their therapeutic potential. 483 In conclusion, our study establishes CMA as a previously neglected protein degradation 484 pathway involved in regulating the catabolism of ATZ. As depicted in Figure 6, in addition to 485 the proteasome and autophagy, ATZ can also undergo degradation via CMA. Specifically, the 486 ATZ protein is recognized by HSC70 through the pentapeptide 121QELLR125 and delivered 487 to LAMP2A to interact with its C terminal cytosolic tail on the lysosomal membrane, the 488 LAMP2A then transporting the substrate into the lysosome for digestion. Activation of CMA, 489\neither through the overexpression of LAMP2A or the use of small molecular activators, 490 enhances the digestion of ATZ, thereby slowing down its aggregation process and mitigating 491 cellular stress. 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519\n520\nFigure 521\nFigure 1: LAMPA2A influence mutant alpha one antitrypsin ATZ steady-state 522 protein level 523\n524 A: GFP-ATZ-expressing HEK 293 cells were transfected with increasing amounts (1, 2, 525 3, 4, or 5 \u03bcg/mL of cell medium) of a vector expressing LAMP2A for 48 hours.

Specifically, the heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) protein recognizes the 721 ATZ protein through the pentapeptide sequence 121QELLR125 and transports it to lysosome-722 associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) on the lysosomal membrane. Augmenting CMA 723 activity through LAMP2A overexpression or AR7 utilization enhances ATZ digestion via this 724 pathway, thereby alleviating cellular stress, including ER stress and mitochondrial impairment. 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737\nReference: 738\n1.
