    "abstractText": "A bone conduction (BC) sound presented on either side of the head will travel to the cochleae in both ears, and this crosstalk phenomenon is considered one factor limiting the benefits of binaural hearing with BC. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the phase and level required for crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea; however, given a human subject\u2019s inability to consistently detect low frequencies, this method is limited to cancellations at frequencies above 1000 Hz. This study describes an alternative approach for implementing a crosstalk cancellation system for low frequencies by measuring ear-canal sound pressure (ECSP). Since the ear canal is close to the cochlea, we hypothesized that altering ECSP in response to a BC stimulation may be used to achieve crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea. Our approach relies on ECSP measurements to estimate impulse responses (IRs) from bone transducers to a probe microphone in the ear canal. The IRs are then used to predict the phase and level required for crosstalk cancellation at the probe microphone\u2019s location. To confirm the hypothesis, we measured tone reception threshold (TRT), the lowest tone level participants could detect, under two conditions: with and without crosstalk cancellation. Although crosstalk cancellation was designed to occur at the probe microphone and not at the cochlea, the TRT results showed that participants were still able to perceive cancellations at frequencies below 1000 Hz.

INTRODUCTION\nASOUND transmitted to the cochlea through the bonesof the skull is known as bone conduction (BC) sound. Unlike an air conduction (AC) sound, a BC sound presented on either side of the head will travel to the cochleae in both ears, as illustrated in Fig. 1. This study refers to the BC sound that propagates to the ear on the opposite side of the head as a \u201ccrosstalk\u201d sound.\nBecause a BC sound stimulates both cochleae, it has long been debated whether wearing a pair of BC hearing devices is beneficial to the ability to hear with both ears, especially for patients with bilateral conductive hearing loss (BCHL) [1]\u2013 [3]. To confirm that binaural benefits exist, speech-in-noise and localization tests were carried out on patients fitted with bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) [4], [5] and on normalhearing participants with bone transducers (BTs) mounted on a headband [6]. It was reported that participants were able to\nmaintain accurate sound localization within 30o/45o [4]\u2013[6]; however, this localization accuracy decreased as sounds were moved to the extreme right or left of the subjects [7]. For speech-in-noise tests where speech and noise originated from two different directions, the benefit of BC stimulation was approximately half the decibel level as that of AC stimulation [8]. Other research studies have also confirmed that the binaural benefits exist but are limited due to crosstalk [9], [10]. Therefore, crosstalk is considered a primary limiting factor of the benefits of binaural hearing with bone conduction.\nThere are five different pathways that allow a BC sound to stimulate the cochlea in the inner ear. These are (1) the softtissue vibration that produces the ear-canal sound pressure (ECSP) [11]\u2013[13]; (2) the bone vibration that also produces the ECSP [14]; (3) the inertial movement on the middle ear ossicles [15] and the inertia forces of the inner ear fluid [16]; (4) compressions and expansions of the cochlear space [16];\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Fig. 2 illustrates these five pathways by which BC sounds can also reach the inner ear on the opposite side of the head. In practice, however, it is difficult to distinguish between these pathways.\nThe question now is how to attenuate BC crosstalk being delivered to the other ear; and whether it is possible. Ideally, phase and level information of the vibrational response in the inner ear may be used to attenuate crosstalk by delivering a cancellation sound with a second BT; however, it is difficult to measure. Based on Fig. 2 above, an alternative entity that is easily accessible in live humans\u2014and may be used to cancel crosstalk\u2014is the ECSP in the outer ear. A recent research on the outer ear pathway during BC hearing by Surendran and Stenfelt [13] reported that the contribution from the ECSP is 10 dB below other contributors at frequencies up to 2 kHz and becomes less important at frequencies above 4 kHz. Although the ECSP is not a major contributor, it is still unclear whether canceling crosstalk sounds in the outer ear does not affect other BC pathways. For example, when the ECSP can be reduced by canceling crosstalk, the vibrations of the bony ear canal, part of the temporal bone that produces ECSP, are expected to decrease in amplitude. This may influence Pathways 3 and 4 and thus result in a reduction in the total BC perception because the outer ear and inner ear are relatively close and connected by the same temporal bone. In the case of patients with conductive hearing loss, sounds are unable to travel through the AC pathway due to an obstruction or damage to the outer or middle ear. So, the total perception might depend only on Pathways 3, 4, and 5; see Fig. 2.\nIn this study, we aim to investigate whether the ECSP can serve as an alternative, easily accessible entity for developing a crosstalk cancellation system to improve the utility of using two BTs. However, one limitation of this present study is that it focused on participants with normal hearing. Conducting this study on patients with conductive hearing loss is necessary to evaluate whether they would actually benefit from the findings presented here, which remains our future work."

            "text": "Many studies have investigated the binaural benefits of using a pair of bone conduction hearing devices [4]\u2013[10]; however, only a few studies have investigated how to reduce crosstalk using a method called \u201ccrosstalk cancellation\u201d [19]\u2013[21]. The method was originally developed to minimize crosstalk between two loudspeakers and two ears to accurately reproduce binaural sounds [22], [23]. Fig. 3 shows the crosstalk issue in binaural sound reproduction over loudspeakers, in principle, similar to that over two BTs. As suggested by Liao, Mcleod, and Culling [20], [24], it is necessary to estimate the transfer functions from each BT to each cochlea [20] or to understand the phase and level of a sound reaching the cochlea from each BT [24] in order to create a crosstalk cancellation system.\nLiao investigated the implementation of a crosstalk cancellation system on a dry human skull [20] in which accelerometers mounted at the arcuate eminences were assumed as the cochleae. It was reported that crosstalk cancellation worked well in the frequency range of 0.25\u20131.5 kHz with an attenuation of up to 12 dB, depending on the frequency. Although we cannot generalize the result due to the difference in properties between a dry human skull and a living human head, a similar cancellation performance might be observed in the same low frequency range; however, a noninvasive method is required to confirm this.\nSeveral attempts have been made to implement a crosstalk cancellation system on the human head [19], [25]. Zhong proposed a method based on psychoacoustic measurements [25]: this method works by canceling a BC pure tone (from one BT) with an AC pure tone (from an earphone). If a participant can feel the silence due to the cancellation of two pure tones,"

The collected phases and levels at different frequencies are then used to predict the new phases and levels required for BC sounds from two BTs to effectively cancel each other out at the cochlea. The method was published as a patent document [25], and there is no detailed information on the extent to which crosstalk can be attenuated. In our previous study, we attempted to achieve crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea by canceling crosstalk at a sensor in the ear canal [19]. Although the crosstalk could be canceled, participants did not experience significant attenuation, which we believe was due to the sensor located at the ear canal entrance and thus too far to the cochlea. In addition, the crosstalk cancellation achieved at the sensor location was also found to be ineffective for frequencies below 800 Hz [19].\nA recent and promising method to achieve crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea is the so-called two-BT method developed by Mcleod and Culling [21]. Unlike the method proposed by Zhong [25], the two-BT method does not require earphones and only relies on two BTs, allowing it be used in patients with conductive hearing loss. In the two-BT method, two pure tones from two BTs are presented to the head. Then, a participant is asked to manually adjust the phase and level of one of the tones until the participant perceives the sound moving from the center of the head to the left or right in an imaginary plane, known as lateralization. When the laterality perceptually reaches its extreme, crosstalk cancellation is assumed to be achieved at the cochlea. Subjective evaluations of three participants showed that the method could achieve crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea over a wide frequency range of 1 to 4 kHz with an average benefit of 12.1 dB [21], significantly outperforming previous studies in terms of frequency range. Although, the effectiveness of the method was clearly demonstrated, participants found it difficult to adjust the phase and level at low frequencies [21]; as a result, this method is limited to cancellation at frequencies above 1 kHz. Despite these findings, because localization cues were considered dominant at low frequencies [26], we consider it necessary to further evaluate the extent to which crosstalk cancellation can be achieved at frequencies below 1 kHz.\nIn this paper, we propose a crosstalk cancellation scheme for two BTs. In contrast to the two-BT method in which the phase and level required for crosstalk cancellation were subjectively set by the user [21], here we developed an objective cancellation method based on the sound pressure produced by the vibrations of the bony ear canal\u2014part of the temporal bone\u2014in response to BC stimulation. It is important to note that the primary contribution of this study was not to develop a new method but rather to investigate an alternative cancellation strategy and adapt existing techniques to the problem of crosstalk. Specifically, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We implemented a crosstalk cancellation system using two BTs and a probe microphone. In principle, the system measures the sound pressure produced by crosstalk in the ear canal and then adjusts the anti-crosstalk sound from the second BT to negate that sound pressure.\n\u2022 We investigated whether the sound pressure produced in the ear canal could serve as an alternative entity for implementing crosstalk cancellation. This was achieved by measuring tone reception thresholds (TRTs) at frequencies below 1 kHz under two noise conditions: with and without crosstalk cancellation. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the TRT results at low frequencies, except at high frequencies [21]."

HYPOTHESIS Since the ear canal is close to the cochlea, we hypothesized that when crosstalk cancellation occurs at the probe microphone location, participants may still feel the cancellation. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured tone reception threshold (TRT), the lowest tone level participants could detect under two noise conditions: with and without crosstalk cancellation, as illustrated in Fig. 5. We assume that cancellation occurs at the cochlea if the TRTs with crosstalk cancellation are lower than those without cancellation.\nC. PARTICIPANTS The participants were seven young adults (six males and one female) aged between 21 and 31 years (mean = 24.29 years) with no tinnitus. They all had normal pure-tone audiometric thresholds (<25 dB hearing level) at octave frequencies. The amount of earwax in the participants was also confirmed not to cause problems such as blockage when earplugs were inserted deeply into both ear canals. In addition, all participants had prior experience with measurements that relied on their responses to auditory stimuli.\nRadioEar B81 BTs mounted on a headband were placed at locations equivalent to the bone-anchored hearing aid, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). To maintain a good acoustic coupling, the headband was adjusted to achieve a force of 2.5\u20133.0 N as suggested by Mcleod et al. [24] and Reinfeldt et al. [27]. An ER-10B+ probe microphone from Etymotic was inserted into the left ear canal to estimate an anti-crosstalk signal, as shown in Fig. 4(a). For both TRT measurements, a pair of 3M push-ins earplugs was used to prevent any AC sound radiating from two BTs from entering both ear canals (Fig. 5). All experiments were performed in an anechoic room.\nD. EQUIPMENT GNU Octave software was used to create sound stimuli sampled at 16 kHz. Sound generation and recording were performed using ALSA audio controlled with Python on a Linux operating system. A Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1 USB sound card was used for digital-to-analog (DA) and analogto-digital (AD) conversions. ECSPs were captured using the Etymotic ER-10B+ low-noise microphone system and amplified by 40 dB.\nE. B81 BONE TRANSDUCERS Before starting the experiments, the frequency responses of the two B81 BTs we used in this study were first measured to ensure they had the same response. The measurement set-up used to obtain the B81 frequency response was adopted from Jansson, Frohlich, et al. [28], [29]. The B81 BT was applied to a B&K 4930 artificial mastoid with a static force of 5.4 N, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). When a test signal at 1VRMS was presented to the B81 BT, the output voltage from the artificial mastoid was amplified using a B&K 2690 amplifier. The final voltage level was then converted to a force level in decibel relative to 1\u00b5N. The time-stretched pulse signal [30] was used as the test signal to measure the frequency response.\nFigs. 6(a) and (b) show the B81 responses in frequency and time domains, respectively. The frequency response obtained from the measurement was similar to that in the B81 datasheet [31]. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the left and right BTs used in this study produced almost the same responses both in the frequency and time domains. In addition, the level differences between the two responses were less than 1 dB at frequencies between 200 Hz and 5 kHz, meaning that both left and right BTs were almost identical."

We define this crosstalk compensation (CTC) filter wRL(n).\nTo achieve crosstalk cancellation in each user\u2019s ear canal, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a), the filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm is used to estimate the optimal CTC filter coefficients based on each user\u2019s IRs.

A phase unwrapping process was applied to the phase difference to obtain a continuous phase. If the unwrapped phase difference decreases to a negative value while the frequency rises, the anti-signal presented to the ipsilateral BT must be delayed to cancel crosstalk at the probe microphone. If the level difference is positive, the anti-signal presented to the ipsilateral BT will be stronger than the signal sent to the contralateral BT, thus achieving destructive interference. In addition, the positive level difference also means that the frequency response from the ipsilateral BT, hLL(n), is normally at a lower level than the response from the contralateral one, hRL(n); in other words, at a frequency where the level difference is positive (Fig. 9(b)), the blue line is usually below the red line (Fig. 7), and vice versa.\nAs expected, because the frequency responses (Fig. 7) differed between participants, the patterns of level differences (Fig. 9(b)) were similarly different, albeit less so.

Then, the CTC filter obtained from the second experiment was used to estimate the anti-noise signal for measuring TRTs. When participants took a break during which the BTs were removed, they were required to repeat a single trial of the first and second experiments to update the CTC filter coefficients to account for positional changes; otherwise, crosstalk cancellation would degrade or fail entirely.\nHere TRT was estimated by the 2-down/1-up adaptive twointerval forced-choice procedure [32]. To carry out the procedure, a graphical user interface (GUI) was used to present two intervals sequentially, each containing a 1-s band noise but a 0.6-s pure tone sounding randomly in only one of them. The GUI presented two buttons, one of which turned green when the interval was played (Fig. 11(b)). All participants knew that a pure tone would be presented either by Button 1 or 2. After two intervals were played, participants were asked to choose the interval in which the target pure tone was heard by clicking one of the buttons. We set the starting level of the target pure tone at -15 dB re 1VRMS. If participants managed to give two consecutive correct responses, the pure tone level would be decreased by 4 dB; on the other hand, if one incorrect response was detected, it would be increased by 4 dB. After the first four reversals, 2-dB step was then used (Fig. 11(a)). Each run consisted of 12 reversals, and TRT was calculated by averaging the levels at the last eight reversals. Each participant performed 14 runs of TRT measurements at seven frequencies with and without crosstalk cancellation."

If crosstalk cancellation occurs at the cochlea or the band noise is successfully canceled in the left ear, a participant will detect a pure tone at a lower TRT (green marker) than without crosstalk cancellation (red marker), indicating the addition of an anti-noise signal improves TRT.\nAs shown in Fig. 12 above, most green markers were lower than the red ones, indicating that crosstalk cancellation benefited all participants, albeit at varying levels relating to their own cancellation performance (Fig. 10) in the second experiment. For example, in the case of Participant 5 at frequencies between 800 and 1000 Hz, when poor cancellation was observed at the probe microphone (see Fig. 10), TRT results also showed that there was almost no difference between thresholds with and without crosstalk cancellation at 800 Hz (see Fig. 12). Conversely, when the probe microphone observed crosstalk cancellation at all target frequencies (see Participants 2 and 4 in Fig. 10), their TRTs with crosstalk cancellation at the same frequencies were also lower than those without crosstalk cancellation (Fig. 12).\nIn some cases, a noticeable crosstalk cancellation was observed at the probe microphone but TRTs showed opposite results. For example, in the second experiment, the microphone observed crosstalk cancellation at 630 Hz for Participant 1 and at 800 Hz for Participant 3; see Fig. 10. However, their TRT results (in Fig. 12) showed no difference, meaning that they perceived no cancellation. A similar case was also found in Participant 7, where a cancellation of more than 10 dB was observed at the probe microphone at frequencies of 400, 500, and 630 Hz (Fig. 10). However, TRTs with crosstalk cancellation showed only small\nVOLUME 4, 2016 9\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

One possible explanation for these cases might be because crosstalk cancellation was actually designed to occur at the microphone. Thus, depending on the frequency, the amount of destructive interference at the cochlea may have been worse than at the probe microphone.\nIn general, adding an anti-noise signal improved TRT in all participants, the averages of which are shown in Table 2. The lowest benefit of 6.7 dB was identified at a frequency of 800 Hz, while the greatest benefit presented as 13.4 dB at 500 Hz.\nIV. GENERAL DISCUSSION We hypothesized that the proximity of the ear canal to the cochlea would allow participants to perceive a change in the level of crosstalk if crosstalk cancellation occurred at the location of the probe microphone in the ear canal. We investigated this hypothesis by measuring TRTs under two noise conditions: with and without crosstalk cancellation, as presented in Fig. 12. From the figure, we confirmed that participants could indeed perceive the cancellation, indicated by most TRTs with crosstalk cancellation being lower than without cancellation. However, it should be noted that TRT measurements in this study were performed only in participants with normal hearing and not in patients with conductive hearing loss. Because we reduced\u2014or canceled altogether\u2014the ear canal sound pressure (ECSP) level caused by crosstalk, there is a possibility that crosstalk cancellation felt by participants was actually the decrease in the ECSP level, indicating that TRTs may be ECSP-dependent in normal-hearing participants. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether patients with conductive hearing loss would actually benefit from the crosstalk cancellation method presented here.\nIn order to achieve destructive interference at the probe microphone, the phase and level differences required to create an anti-crosstalk signal were estimated from IRs of each participant using the FxLMS algorithm. Fig. 9 shows the phase (a) and level (b) differences required for crosstalk cancellation in each of the participants. The primary advantage of the method presented here is that the required phase and level can be predicted much faster (less than 1 min) when compared to the two-BT method proposed by Mcleod and Culling that requires approximately 50 mins [21]. Our method, however, produced less accurate estimations because the target cancellation was at the probe microphone and not at the cochlea. As discussed in Subsection IIIH(3), at certain frequencies, three out of seven participants felt no difference or only slight improvements in TRT with the addition of an anti-crosstalk signal, although the microphone in the ear canal showed an attenuation of over 10 dB. One possible solution to this problem is to adopt the two-BT method. The CTC filter coefficients estimated using the FxLMS can be manually tuned in the frequency domain at a specific frequency until participants feel silence or experience a change in laterality due to the cancellation of two tones. This approach may improve our current method and enable cancellation in a wider frequency range, which remains as our future work.\nIn this study, the FxLMS algorithm was not implemented in real-time. So, the primary and secondary path responses, hRL(n) and hLL(n), were estimated in advance using TSP signals before the FxLMS algorithm was used. In this paper, hRL(n) and hLL(n) refer to the IRs from the contralateral and ipsilateral BTs, respectively, to the probe microphone in the ear canal; see Fig. 8. When BTs were removed and put back in their previous position while maintaining the same static force, hRL(n) and hLL(n) varied only slightly in the frequency domain (see Fig. 7). The estimated primary and secondary paths of each participant were then used to run a simulation where the FxLMS algorithm (Table 1) was used to estimate the coefficients of the CTC filter (see Fig. 9). Our measurements showed that, using the estimated coefficients, crosstalk cancellation was successfully achieved in all participants\u2019 ear canals, indicated by a decrease in ECSP level at low frequencies (see Fig. 10).\nThere is a certain condition where crosstalk cancellation\u2014 a decrease in ECSP level\u2014is difficult to achieve in a specific frequency range but still works fine in the rest of the target low-frequency range. This case was found in Participant 5 at frequencies between 800\u20131000 Hz (Fig. 10). This occurs when the probe microphone on the ipsilateral side receives much lower sound energy from the ipsilateral BT than from the contralateral BT; which means that the secondary path response hLL(n) has a significantly lower level response of narrow frequency bandwidth than the primary path response hRL(n) (see Participant 5\u2019s IRs at 800\u20131000 Hz in Fig. 7). This phenomenon is called \u201canti-resonance\u201d and, according to measurements of BC sound in six cadaver heads, the antiresonance frequency differs between the heads [33]. When the anti-resonance frequency was close to the test frequency, we found no difference in TRTs with and without crosstalk cancellation (see Participant 5\u2019s TRTs at 800 Hz in Fig. 12). Mcleod and Culling also reported that the crosstalk cancellation task becomes difficult if it is near the anti-resonance frequency [34]. In order to achieve the optimal performance, it may be necessary to apply constraints so that the FxLMS algorithm can ignore cancellations near the anti-resonance frequency during the adaptation of the filter coefficients; this also remains future work."
