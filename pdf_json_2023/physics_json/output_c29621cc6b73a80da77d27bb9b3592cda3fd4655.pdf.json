Several physical, chemical, and biological techniques, such as adsorption, absorption, membrane separation, occulation and coagulation, and electrochemical and catalysis, have been applied recently for the destruction and removal of organic contaminants before their release in wastewater.4,6\u20138 Among them, adsorption, an eco-friendly and efficient method, showed a promising route to handle various environmental contaminants.9,10 Nonetheless, eliminating organic dyes from industrial water is still challenging due to possible by-product\ninh City University of Food Industry, 140 Vietnam 34 Le Loi, Phu Hoi, Hue City, 530000,\nstrial University of Ho Chi Minh City, 12\n, Vietnam.

Besides, metal oxides exhibit goodmechanical properties and resistance to thermal decomposition compared to others.16 Out of these, alumina oxide adsorbents, such as a-Al2O3, gAl2O3, and g-AlOOH in various forms, which show eco-friendly nature, cost-effective, are easily synthesized.11,16\u201320 Hydrolysis and precipitation are easy, simple, and cost-effective routes for preparing these nanoparticles and their composites. The physicochemical properties of produced materials can be inuenced by solvent, concentration, and temperature. Though alumina oxide adsorbents have been commonly used as adsorbent materials, the removal efficiency of these materials toward organic dyes is still not high owing to their low surface area and pore volume.19,21 To avoid these problems, there have been many studies on the modication of alumina to improve their physicochemical properties, enhancing adsorption. For instance, Ibrahim et al. prepared a Cr2O3\u2013Al2O3 composite and found that the material exhibited improved adsorption ability toward Congo red dye.22 Recently, Barakat et al. developed an Al2O3/GO/halloysite nanotube composite with improved\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5859\u20135868 | 5859\nScheme 1 The schematic diagram for the spray pyrolysis synthesis of TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Singh et al. synthesized an Al2O3/GO cellulosebased 3D-hydrogel that showed enhanced adsorption ability compared to the bare Al2O3.23 Ding et al. prepared an Al2O3\u2013 TiO2 nanocomposite with enhanced adsorption performance to uranium from an aqueous solution.19 Despite many efforts, research on tailoring alumina oxide structures to improve their physicochemical properties and porosity is still limited.\nDeveloping a highly efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method for material preparation is also a critical issue, particularly when considering applying the material in the industry. So far, most materials have been prepared using batch mode synthesis, which usually requires a very long holding time and is challenging to scale.24\u201326 Recently, research has shown that spray pyrolysis has a high potential and advantage for preparing metal oxides as it is versatile, rapid, and scalable.27\u201331 The spray pyrolysis process includes four main steps: (i) generation of droplets from precursor solution, (ii) shrinkage of droplets, (iii) conversion of precursors to metal oxides, and (iv) solid particle formation.27,32 In addition, our previous work indicated that gAl2O3 microspheres prepared by spray pyrolysis exhibited considerably improved surface area and pore volume compared to that derived by the conventional precipitation method.24,33\nHerein, various contents of TiO2 were in situ incorporated into g-Al2O3 via the spry pyrolysis of boehmite sol and titania sol mixture, producing mesoporous Al2O3\u2013TiO2 microspheres. It was realized that introducing TiO2 into g-Al2O3 created synergetic effects that reduced the alumina's crystallite size and made more mesoporous structures as well as new active sites. The prepared TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres were rst used as adsorbents to remove anionic methyl orange and cationic rhodamine B from water in the batch adsorption process. Then, the impact of environmental conditions, including concentration, pH, and coexisting ions, was systematically studied to optimize the removal efficiency. Finally, TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres were further tested for the continuous ow column adsorption of dyes to conrm the applicability of spray pyrolysis-derived TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres."

The crystallography analysis of all materials was performed, and the results are presented in Fig. 2(a).

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nXRD patterns of TiO2/Al2O3 #5 and TiO2/Al2O3 #15 samples show only peaks of g-Al2O3 but no sign of TiO2. This could be because the newly formed TiO2 particles were nely incorporated within the g-Al2O3 matrix during the spray pyrolysis or could exist in the amorphous phase and beyond the XRD detection. Nonetheless, the XRD pattern of TiO2/Al2O3 #25 exhibits the peaks of TiO2 anatase at 2q \u223c25.4\u00b0. This suggests that TiO2 might grow well and agglomerate onto the surface of g-Al2O3 at such a high content. Furthermore, the peaks of Al2O3 were observed to shi slightly and were broader [see the inset Fig. 2(a)], suggesting the incorporated titania could increase lattice strain and reduce the particle size of alumina. Indeed, the particle size of g-Al2O3 was estimated by applying the Scherrer formula, and obtained results are presented in Table 1. As shown, the bare g-Al2O3 had a crystallite size of ca.\u223c3.75 nm; meanwhile, the crystallite size of Al2O3 in the composite TiO2/ Al2O3 #5 and TiO2/Al2O3 #15 was ca. \u223c3.60 and \u223c3.44 nm, respectively. However, loading higher TiO2 content, up to 25 wt%, did not affect the crystallite size of Al2O3.\nThe temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 was performed to evaluate the materials' content and types of acid sites. As demonstrated in Fig. 2(b), the TPD prole of the bare g-Al2O3 and TiO2 exhibits a desorption peak of NH3 at a low temperature of \u223c200 \u00b0C and 227 \u00b0C, respectively, which are ascribed to their weak acid sites. For the TiO2/Al2O3 composite, the TPD curve shows NH3 desorption peaks at approximately 230 \u00b0C and 578 \u00b0 C, assigned to weak and strong acid sites, respectively. The results indicate that incorporating TiO2 into g-Al2O3 generated more acid sites owing to the added Ti4+ sites or the newly formed bonds (e.g., \u2013Al\u2013O\u2013Ti\u2013) in the composite materials.24,34 Because of the electrostatic force, these acid sites would enhance the materials' adsorption ability toward anionic dyes. The acid density of the prepared materials was obtained by dividing total acid sites by surface area. Accordingly, the highest acid density of ca. \u223c3.89 mmol m\u22122 was achieved for the synthesized TiO2/Al2O3 #15 sample.

The bare g-Al2O3 and TiO2 anatase had pHPZC values of\u223c8.3 and 5.1, respectively.

That is to say, introducing TiO2 anatase into the g-Al2O3 host generated a synergistic effect that enhanced the adsorption of dyes onto the TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres. Nonetheless, increasing the TiO2 dopant content up to 25 wt% diminished the adsorption ability of the adsorbent owing to their signicantly reduced porosity. Table 2 compares the removal of MO and RB over various adsorbents, showing that the spray pyrolysis-derived TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres exhibited high adsorption ability towards dyes compared to many counterparts.\nThe adsorption behaviour of organic contaminants onto the produced adsorbents was uncovered by applying the nonlinear pseudo-rst-order and pseudo-second-order models, as presented in Fig. 4(a\u2013d) (the dash lines). The consistency between the experimental data and the models was evaluated via the average relative error (ARE), which is dened as follows:14\nARE \u00bc Xn i\u00bc1 qe;exp qe;cal qe;exp\n(2) where qe,exp and qe,cal are the experimental and estimated adsorbing amounts (mg g\u22121), respectively.\nTable 2 Removal of MO and RB over various adsorbents\nPollutant Adsorbent\nMO de-Oiled soyga Natural skin almonds Orange peel Hyper crosslinked polymeric adsorbent g-Fe2O3/SiO2/chitosan composite Spray pyrolysis-derived TiO2/Al2O3 microsphere RB Xanthium strumarium L. seed hull Microwave-activated rice husk ash Activated carbon from lignocellulosic waste Hyper crosslinked polymeric adsorbent Furfural residue Spray pyrolysis-derived TiO2/Al2O3 microsphere\nThe obtained tted parameters are listed in Table 3. As shown, the higher value of the coefficient R2 and the lower value of ARE were obtained for the pseudo-second-order, suggesting that this kinetic model described the capture of dyes onto the adsorbents well. Accordingly, the rate constants obtained for the second-order model follow the order kMO > kRB, indicating that the adsorption rate of MO was faster than RB under the investigated conditions. The rate-limiting adsorption step was determined by applying the intraparticle diffusion (ID) model, which is expressed as follows:35,36\nqt = kIDt 1/2 + C (3)\nwhere kID is the rate constant of the intraparticle diffusion model (mg g\u22121 min\u22121/2), qt is the adsorbing amount (mg g\n\u22121), and C is a constant. As shown in Fig. 4(e and f), these obtained ID plots included three separate linear portions, implying three diffusion stages during the adsorption process.

The gradual adsorption step was the second stage, which was governed by intraparticle diffusion.

Fig. 5(c and d) show the effects of pH on the adsorption of the investigated textile dyes onto the TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres. As shown, the adsorbing amount of MO decreased; meanwhile, the adsorbing amount of RB increased with an increase in pH, exhibiting pH sensitivity and dependent capture capacity of these molecules. In acidic media, the \u2013OH groups on the surface of the TiO2/Al2O3 spheres were protonated by H + ions to form \u2013OH2 +, giving a positively charged surface. Thus, this leads to restricting the approach of cationic RB dye owing to electrostatic repulsion. However, due to electrostatic attraction, the positively charged surface would increasingly attract more anionic MOmolecules onto the adsorbent's exterior, enhancing adsorption. Conversely, in basic media, the TiO2/Al2O3 surface was deprotonated by OH\u2212 ions, producing a negatively charged surface favourable for the adsorption of cationic RB species. Besides electrostatic force, the interaction between TiO2/Al2O3 adsorbent materials and dye molecules might include hydrogen bonding."

Here, the batch adsorption process was implemented using an equimolar solution of MO and RB (30 mg L\u22121, pH \u223c 5.5) utilizing the spray pyrolysis-derived TiO2/Al2O3 #15 microspheres. Fig. 7(a) shows the UV-vis spectrum of the solution, and Fig. 7(b) shows the FT-IR spectrum of TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres before and aer the adsorption of textile dyes. Results reveal that the MO and RB were simultaneously removed over the TiO2-incorporated Al2O3 microspheres. Aer 6.5 h, the UV adsorption intensity of MO (lmax = 463 nm) was signicantly reduced by approximately 87%, while that of RB (lmax = 554 nm) exhibited a decrease of roughly 32%. The ndings suggested that the adsorbent preferentially adsorbed MO much more than the latter contaminant. This can be explained by the fact that MO, an anionic dye, was quickly adsorbed on the positively charged surface of TiO2/Al2O3 owing to the electrostatic attraction force. Moreover, the newly generated acid sites (e.g., Ti4+) of the composite could also contribute to the enhanced capture of anionic dyes.\nConversely, RB, a cationic dye, would not be favourable for adsorption onto the adsorbent because of the electrostatic repulsive force. Besides, the different adsorption behaviour of MO and RB onto the TiO2-incorporated Al2O3 microsphere could be attributed to their differences in chemical structures and molecular sizes. Indeed, pore/size-selective adsorption, monitored by the adsorbate molecule magnitude and adsorbent dimensions, is reportedly an effective adsorption mechanism.14,46 Herein, methyl orange has a molecular size of \u223c1.2 nm, which is smaller than RB (\u223c1.8 nm).47 Therefore, MO\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The prepared TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres are uniform spherical particles with diameters ranging from 0.5\u20132.5 mm. With increasing TiO2 content from 5 to 25 wt%, the surface area reduced from 298 m2 g\u22121 to 175 m2 g\u22121, while the mean pore diameter increased from 3.81 to 4.45 nm, respectively. Furthermore, loading low TiO2 contents (5\u201315 wt%) reduced the crystallite size of the Al2O3 host. Dye adsorption in batch modes shows that loading 5 to 15 wt% TiO2 content enhanced the adsorption ability of the adsorbent compared to the bare metal oxides because of the reduced particle size of Al2O3, newly formed pore structures, and active sites. Furthermore, introducing TiO2 into Al2O3 created more active sites, enhancing the adsorption performance. The pH media signicantly impacted the adsorption performance of TiO2/Al2O3 microspheres; meanwhile, adding the coexisting anions with a concentration range of 1.5\u20135.0 mmol L\u22121 caused insignicant effects.
