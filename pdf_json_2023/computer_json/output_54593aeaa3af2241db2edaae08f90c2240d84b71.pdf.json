    "abstractText": "33 The ability to remember what happened where and when constitutes the basic fabric of 34 our memories and who we are. Forming and recalling memories depends on detecting novelty, 35 building associations to prior knowledge, and dynamically retrieving context-relevant 36 information. Previous studies have scrutinized the neural machinery for individual components 37 of recognition or associative memory under laboratory conditions, such as recalling elements 38 from arbitrary lists of words or pictures. In this study, we implemented a well-known card39 matching game that integrates multiple components of memory formation together in a 40 naturalistic setting to investigate the dynamic neural processes underlying complex natural 41 human memory. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1,750 depth or subdural 42 electrodes implanted in 20 patients with pharmacologically-intractable epilepsy while they were 43 performing the task. We leveraged generalized linear models to simultaneously assess the 44 relative contribution of neural responses to distinct task components. Neural activity in the 45 gamma frequency band signaled novelty and graded degrees of familiarity, represented the 46 strength and outcome of associative recall, and finally reflected visual feedback on a trial-by-trial 47 basis. The large-scale data and models enable dissociating and at the same time dynamically 48 tracing the different cognitive components during fast, complex, and natural human memory 49 behaviors. 50 51 Significance 52 53 Different aspects of memory like recognition, association, and recall have often been 54 studied in isolation under laboratory conditions. Here we implemented a task that naturally 55 integrates recognition, association, and retrieval, mimicking real-world memory experiences. 56 Recording invasive intracranial field potentials from the human brain, this study shows that 57 neural activity in the gamma frequency band in neocortical areas in temporal and frontal cortex 58 reflects temporally overlapping yet computationally dissociable mental processes during 59 dynamic memory formation. 60 61 62 .

Forming and recalling memories depends on detecting novelty, 35\nbuilding associations to prior knowledge, and dynamically retrieving context-relevant 36\ninformation. Previous studies have scrutinized the neural machinery for individual components 37\nof recognition or associative memory under laboratory conditions, such as recalling elements 38\nfrom arbitrary lists of words or pictures. In this study, we implemented a well-known card-39\nmatching game that integrates multiple components of memory formation together in a 40\nnaturalistic setting to investigate the dynamic neural processes underlying complex natural 41\nhuman memory. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1,750 depth or subdural 42\nelectrodes implanted in 20 patients with pharmacologically-intractable epilepsy while they were 43\nperforming the task. We leveraged generalized linear models to simultaneously assess the 44\nrelative contribution of neural responses to distinct task components. Neural activity in the 45\ngamma frequency band signaled novelty and graded degrees of familiarity, represented the 46\nstrength and outcome of associative recall, and finally reflected visual feedback on a trial-by-trial 47\nbasis. The large-scale data and models enable dissociating and at the same time dynamically 48\ntracing the different cognitive components during fast, complex, and natural human memory 49\nbehaviors. 50\n51\nSignificance 52 53 Different aspects of memory like recognition, association, and recall have often been 54\nstudied in isolation under laboratory conditions. Here we implemented a task that naturally 55\nintegrates recognition, association, and retrieval, mimicking real-world memory experiences. 56\nRecording invasive intracranial field potentials from the human brain, this study shows that 57\nneural activity in the gamma frequency band in neocortical areas in temporal and frontal cortex 58\nreflects temporally overlapping yet computationally dissociable mental processes during 59\ndynamic memory formation. 60\n61\n62\nMain Text 63\nIntroduction 64\nEpisodic memories constitute the essential backbone of our identities. Neural circuits 65\nmust extract, store, and retrieve information about what, when, and where of specific life events. 66\nIn stark contrast to most efforts in current artificial intelligence algorithms, the formation and 67\nretrieval of episodic memories occurs in a largely unsupervised fashion, with single or limited 68\nexposures, and leads to continual learning of new events that are automatically linked to previous 69\nexperiences. Despite extensive efforts at the molecular, physiological, and behavioral levels, our 70\nmechanistic understanding of the formation of episodic memories remains limited. 71\nThe formation and recall of memories require assessing novelty versus familiarity, 72\nbuilding bridges between sensory inputs and prior knowledge, and effectively retrieving 73\ninformation in the context of current task demands or internal thoughts. There is extensive 74\nliterature examining neural responses during separate components of this process. A large 75\nnumber of studies have focused on tasks that involve presenting a list of items, such as words, 76\npictures, or video clips, and either recalling items from these lists or assessing recognition 77\nmemory for those items (e.g., (1-12)). Another prominent experimental paradigm inspired by 78\nresearch in rodents has focused on spatial navigation (e.g., (13-16)). 79\nJudging an item as novel is necessary for its successful memory encoding (17), and 80\nrecognizing an item as familiar facilitates memory retrieval (18). Several studies have 81\ndocumented correlates of recognition memory for novelty versus familiarity, primarily but not 82\nexclusively, in medial temporal lobe structures in rodents, monkeys, and humans (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 83\n13, 19-23). Both novel and familiar items need to be incorporated into the body of prior 84\nknowledge by forming novel associations. Associative memory has been commonly investigated 85\nby having participants learn pairs of items and then recall one of the two items or assess whether 86\na given association is correct or not (e.g., (24-33)). Although recognition memory and associative 87\nmemory have been largely studied separately, they are not independent in real-world memory 88\ntasks. Successful implementation of associative memory is contingent on basic recognition 89\nprocesses. 90\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We focused on the neural 94\nactivities in the gamma frequency band (30-150 Hz), which are thought to indirectly reflect the 95\nsynchronous firing of ensembles of neurons that support neuronal communication as well as 96\ncortical computation (34-38). We constructed generalized linear models to characterize how 97\nneural responses are modulated by the different behavioral components involved in the task. 98\nThe results show how neural circuits transition from representing novelty and graded degrees of 99\nfamiliarity to the strength and outcome of associative recall and reward feedback on a trial-by-100\ntrial basis. 101\n102\nResults 103\n104\nWe recorded intracranial field potentials (IFPs) from 20 patients with pharmacologically 105\nintractable epilepsy implanted with depth electrodes (Table S1, one participant also had subdural 106\nsurface electrodes). Participants played a memory-matching game (Figure 1, Movie S1, Methods). 107\nEach trial consisted of two self-paced clicks. Clicking on a tile revealed an image (Figure 1A). 108\nImage categories included person, animal, food, vehicle, and indoor scenes. If the two tiles in a 109\ntrial contained the same image (match, Figure 1B), the two tiles turned green and could not be 110\nclicked again for the remainder of the block. If the two images were different (mismatch, Figure 111\n1A and 1C), the two tiles turned black and could be clicked again. Participants started in a 3\u00d73 112\ntile board block like the one shown in Figure 1 and progressed to more difficult blocks (4\u00d74, 5\u00d75, 113\n6\u00d76, or 7\u00d77 tiles). All tiles had a corresponding match, except for one tile in the boards with an 114\nodd number of tiles (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7). 115\n116\nMismatch trials showed longer reaction times and were associated with less frequent and less 117\nrecent exposure to matching pairs 118\n119\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

All participants performed much better than a memoryless model (random clicking, 121\np<0.001, here and in subsequent tests unless stated otherwise: permutation test, 5,000 iterations, 122\none-tailed) and performed worse than a model assuming perfect memory (p<0.001, Figure 2A). 123\nThe reaction time (RT) was defined as the time interval between the first and second clicks within 124\na trial (Figure 1A). The reaction time was longer for mismatch than match trials for all board sizes 125\n(p<0.007, Figure 2B). 126\nFor a tile in a given trial, we defined n-since-last-click (nslc) as the number of clicks elapsed 127\nsince the last time the same tile was clicked (Figure 1A-B). As expected, nslc increased with board 128\nsize (p<0.001, linear regression, F-test, Figure 2C-D). For the 2nd tile, nslc was larger in mismatch 129\ncompared to match trials for all board sizes except the 3x3 case (p<0.001, Figure 2D), a reflection 130\nof the decay in memory for tiles that were not seen recently. The larger nslc in mismatch trials 131\nalso held for the 1st tile only for the 7x7 board size (p<0.001, Figure 2C). If the participants believe 132\nthat they know the locations of both tiles in a matching pair, a reasonable strategy is to click first 133\nthe tile they are less sure about, likely because they have seen this tile earlier rather than later in 134\nthe block. This strategy accounts for the differences between the 1st tile (Figure 2C) and 2nd tile 135\n(Figure 2D). 136\nFor a tile in a given trial, we defined n-since-pair (nsp) as the number of clicks since the 137\nlast time when its matching pair was seen (Figure 1A, C). As expected, nsp increased with board 138\nsize given the increased difficulty (p<0.001, linear regression, F-test, Figure 2E-2F). Additionally, 139\nthe more recent the tile's matching pair was seen, the more likely the trial was a match. Thus, 140\nnsp was larger in mismatch compared to match trials in all cases except the 3x3 board size for 141\nthe 1st tile (p<0.001, Figure 2E). For the 2nd tile, nsp for any match trial was always one because 142\nthe matching pair would have been revealed in the previous click, by definition. Thus, there was 143\na large difference between nsp between match and mismatch trials (p<0.001, Figure 2F). 144\nWe performed infrared eye-tracking on ten healthy participants while they performed the 145\nsame task. Participants fixated on the tile they clicked, both for the first and second tiles, and 146\nboth for match and mismatch trials (Figure S1). For the first tile, there was no difference in the 147\ndynamics of saccades towards and away from the target tile between match and mismatch trials 148\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For the 149\nsecond tile, there was no difference in the dynamics of saccades toward the target tile before the 150\nclick. However, for approximately 1 second after the 2nd click, the distance to the center of the 151\ntile was, on average, 1.76 dva (degrees of visual angle) larger for match than mismatch trials 152\n(Figure S1B). This small difference may be attributed to participants' lingering slightly longer 153\nduring mismatch trials, arguably in an effort to remember the tile. 154\n155\nNeural signals reflect novelty and familiarity 156\n157\nWe recorded intracranial field potentials from 1,750 electrodes (Table S2). We excluded 158\n582 electrodes due to bipolar referencing, locations in pathological sites, or signals containing 159\nartifacts (Methods). We included in the analyses 676 bipolarly referenced electrodes in the gray 160\nmatter (Figure 3) and 492 in the white matter (Figure S2). Table S2 describes electrode locations 161\nseparated by brain region and hemisphere. Although the white matter is presumed to contain 162\nmostly myelinated axons, previous studies have shown that intracranial field potential signals 163\nfrom the white matter can demonstrate biologically meaningful information (39, 40). Such signals 164\ncould reflect small errors in electrode localization on the order of ~2 millimeters and also the 165\nspread of intracranial field potential signals over 1 to 5 millimeters (35, 36, 41-43), implying that 166\nwhite matter electrodes may still capture activity from gray matter. Indeed, we show here that 167\nelectrodes in the white matter reveal task-relevant properties and therefore included electrodes 168\nin the white matter in our analyses. To avoid confusion about the origin of the signals, we focused 169\non the gray matter electrodes in the main text and reported results from electrodes in the white 170\nmatter in the Supplementary Material. None of the conclusions in this study would change if we 171\nwere to report the results from electrodes in the gray matter exclusively. 172\nWe built two generalized linear models (GLM) to characterize how the neural responses 173\ndepended on the cognitive demands of each trial. The first model focused on the neural 174\nresponses to the 1st tile, and the second model on the 2nd tile. In both cases, we focused on 175\npredicting the area under the curve (AUC) of the gamma band power (30-150 Hz) in each trial 176\n(Methods). For the first GLM, the time window started when the 1st tile was clicked and ended 177\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This criterion was a reasonable tradeoff 179\nbetween minimizing overlap with responses after the 2nd tile and maximally capturing 180\ninformation before the 2nd tile. For the second model, the time window started with the 2nd click 181\nand ended one second afterward. 182\nWe considered 15 predictors for the GLM models, including whether a trial was a match 183\nor not, reaction time, n-since-last-click (nslc), and n-since-pair (nsp), the variables introduced in 184\nFigures 1-2. We also included additional predictors: first-click (whether a tile was clicked for the 185\nfirst time), n-times-seen (number of times an image had been seen), next-match (whether the 186\nsubsequent trial was a match), board size, x and y position of the clicked tile within the board, 187\ndistance between the first and the second tiles, and whether the image contained a person, 188\nanimal, food, or vehicle. Table 1 lists all the predictors and their definitions. Since several 189\npredictors were correlated with each other (Figure S3A-B), we computed the variance inflation 190\nfactor (VIF) (44), a metric commonly used to account for correlations between predictors in 191\ngeneralized linear models. The VIF of each predictor was smaller than 3 for all participants (Figure 192\nS3C-D). Therefore, the correlations between predictors did not harm the performance of the 193\nmodels (Methods). 194\nWhen the first tile in a trial was clicked, its status in memory guided the following actions. 195\nIf it was a new image, the participant needed to encode it in memory for future retrieval. Thus, 196\nthe ability to detect novelty is the first step for successful encoding. The predictor first-click 197\ndescribed novelty and had a value of 1 whenever a tile was seen for the first time and 0 otherwise. 198\nIf a tile had been viewed before, it would appear familiar to the participant, and the degree of 199\nfamiliarity depended on how long ago that tile had been seen last. The predictor n-since-last-click 200\n(Figure 1A-B, Figure 2C-D) described familiarity; the smaller nslc, the more familiar the tile is 201\nbecause that same tile was seen more recently. 202\nFigure 4A-D shows the neural activity of an electrode located in the right lateral 203\norbitofrontal cortex (arrow in Figure 4D), whose responses to the first tile correlated with novelty. 204\nThe GLM analysis indicated that first-click was a significant predictor of the neural responses 205\n(Figure 4A). The neural responses to the first tile showed a decrease in activity for novel tiles 206\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This decrease in activity is reflected by the negative sign in the GLM 208\nfirst-click predictor (Figure 4A). 209\nNovelty was a significant predictor of the neural responses after the first tile (p<0.01, GLM) 210\nfor 50 electrodes in the gray matter (7.4% of the total, Table S3A, Figure 4D) and 33 electrodes 211\nin the white matter (6.7% of the total, Table S3B). The lateral orbitofrontal (LOF) cortex and pars 212\nopercularis contained significantly more electrodes than expected by chance (p<0.01, Methods). 213\nFigure 4E-H show the neural activity of an electrode located in the left pars opercularis 214\n(arrow in Figure 4H), whose responses to the first tile correlated with familiarity. The GLM 215\nanalysis indicated that both n-since-last-click (nslc) and first-click were significant predictors of 216\nthe neural responses (p<0.001, GLM, Figure 4E). Novel tiles (completely unfamiliar tiles, Figure 217\n4F, blue) elicited strong responses, followed by less familiar tiles (higher nslc, Figure 4F, yellow). 218\nFamiliar tiles (nslc=1, i.e., tiles that had just been seen in the preceding trial) elicited almost no 219\nresponse (Figure 4F, red). The strong correlation between the neural responses, novelty, and 220\nfamiliarity can also be readily appreciated in individual trials (Figure 4G). 221\nThe reaction time was also a significant predictor for the neural responses recorded from 222\nthis electrode (Figure 4E). However, the differences in neural responses signaling novelty and 223\ndistinct degrees of familiarity cannot be explained by differences in reaction time. The differences 224\nin neural responses associated with novelty and familiarity persisted after reaction time 225\nequalization (see vertical dashed lines indicating equalized RT in Figure 4F). 226\nThe nslc predictor was statistically significant (p<0.01, GLM) in 45 gray matter electrodes 227\n(6.7% of the total, Table S4A, Figure 4H) and 32 white matter electrodes (6.5%, Table S4B, Figure 228\nS4D). Figure S4 shows an example electrode located in the white matter whose responses 229\ncorrelated with novelty and familiarity. The majority of electrodes (82.2%) showed a positive 230\ncorrelation between the neural responses and nslc as illustrated in Figure 4E-G. The remaining 231\nelectrodes (17.8%) showed a negative correlation, i.e., stronger neural responses for more 232\nfamiliar items. Figure S5 depicts an example electrode located in the right pars opercularis 233\nshowing a negative correlation between familiarity and neural responses. 234\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The electrodes that showed both first-click and 237\nn-since-last-click as significant predictors (20 electrodes) are denoted by red circles in Figure 4D 238\nand Figure 4H. Among these 20 electrodes, the signs of the t-statistic for the first-click and n-239\nsince-last-click predictors were consistent for 18 electrodes (16 positive and 2 negative). Only 240\ntwo electrodes exhibited opposite signs. These results indicate that novelty largely resembles 241\nextremely low familiarity in terms of the underlying neural responses. 242\n243\nNeural signals predict correct retrieval 244\n245\nAfter seeing the 1st tile, participants attempt to find the tile's pair. If the 1st tile's pair was 246\nnever encountered before, this is a random choice among the unseen tiles. If the tile's pair is 247\nunfamiliar, recalling a match is error-prone and often leads to mismatches (Figure 2E). For highly 248\nfamiliar cases, participants can retrieve the correct location to find the match tile. Therefore, we 249\nasked whether the neural responses after exposure to the first tile and before seeing the 2nd tile 250\ncould predict successful retrieval. 251\nFigure 5 shows the neural activity of an electrode located in the right lateral orbitofrontal 252\ncortex (arrow in Figure 5E), whose responses were predictive of successful retrieval. The GLM 253\nanalysis indicated that match was a significant predictor of the neural responses (p<0.001, Figure 254\n5A). This electrode showed stronger responses during match trials (Figure 5B, green) than during 255\nmismatch trials (Figure 5B, black). These differences can even be appreciated in single trials 256\n(compare Figure 5C versus Figure 5D). Of note, these differences are evident shortly after 257\nvisualization of the first tile, with a peak at 500 ms after clicking the first tile, well before clicking 258\nthe second tile, when the participant did not know for certain yet whether the trial would be a 259\nmatch or not. Thus, the strong neural differences between match and mismatch trials reflect the 260\nparticipant's internal retrieval of the correct pairs' locations. 261\nWhether a trial was a match or not was a significant predictor of the neural responses for 262\n32 electrodes in the gray matter (4.7% of the total, Table S5A, Figure 5E) and 30 electrodes in 263\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For an example electrode in the white 264\nmatter see Figure S6. In most cases (91 %), neural activity was higher during match trials than 265\nduring mismatch trials, as illustrated in Figure 5. The locations of all these electrodes, shown in 266\nFigure 5E (gray matter) and Figure S6 (white matter), reveal that the majority were located in the 267\nlateral orbitofrontal (LOF) cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and the insula. The LOF cortex 268\ncontained significantly more electrodes than expected by chance (p<0.01, Methods). 269\nThe peak in neural activity occurred at approximately 500 ms after the 1st click (Figure 5B). 270\nAs discussed in the previous section, the match predictor correlated with several other predictors 271\n(Figure S3). However, the GLM analysis shows that the match's presence, but not other 272\npredictors, accounts for the neural responses (Figure 5A). To further establish this point, Figure 273\nS7A shows the responses of this same electrode, in the same format as Figure 5B, after equalizing 274\nthe n-since-last-click (nslc) distributions for match and mismatch trials by subsampling the data. 275\nThe same conclusions hold in this case. Furthermore, Figure S7B shows each match trial's gamma 276\npower AUC versus the value of n-since-last-click and Figure S7C displays the same data from 277\nmismatch trials. The variable nslc did not account for the neural responses in either case (p>0.18, 278\nlinear regression). Similar conclusions hold for the other predictors. 279\nFigure S8 shows another example electrode located in the left middle temporal gyrus 280\nwhere the match was a significant predictor for the gamma band activity between the 1st and 2nd 281\ntiles. Similar to the LOF electrode in Figure 5, the gamma power during match trials was higher 282\nthan during mismatch trials. However, the pattern of modulation in this electrode was sustained 283\nrather than transient (compare Figure S8 versus Figure 5B-D). The change in gamma power was 284\nalso evident in individual trials (Figure S8B-C). These observations suggest that the middle 285\ntemporal and lateral orbitofrontal regions might be functionally distinct during memory retrieval. 286\nIn sum, these results indicate that even before the actual realization of whether a trial was a 287\nmatch or mismatch (i.e., before the onset of the 2nd tile), there were distinct neural responses 288\nthat were predictive of the trial's outcome. 289\n290\nNeural signals reflect the strength of memory retrieval 291\n292\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The smaller nsp, the more recently the tile's pair had been seen (Figure 2E-F). 295\nThis predictor is different from n-since-last-click, which indicates how recently the same tile, 296\nrather than its pair, had been seen (Figure 1). We considered only match trials for this predictor 297\n(n-since-pair*match) because there was no successful retrieval of the tile's pair in mismatch trials. 298\nFigure 6 shows an example electrode in the left middle temporal gyrus (arrow in Figure 299\n6E). In contrast with the electrode in Figure 5, both the match predictor and the nsp predictor 300\nwere significant in the GLM analysis (Figure 6A). The t-statistic for nsp was negative, indicating a 301\ndecrease in gamma band power for matching pairs that were more distant in memory. Indeed, 302\nresponses were strongest for those tiles whose pairs had been seen less than 2 clicks ago (Figure 303\n6B, red) and weakest when matching pairs had been seen more than 10 clicks ago (Figure 6B, 304\npurple). There was a negative correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) of the gamma 305\nband power and nsp (Figure 6C, p<0.001, linear regression). This correlation disappeared when 306\nconsidering mismatch trials (Figure 6D, p=0.66, linear regression), suggesting that the 307\nrelationship between the neural signals and memory strength was contingent on successful 308\nretrieval. 309\nThe nsp predictor was statistically significant (p<0.01, GLM) in 15 electrodes in the gray 310\nmatter (2.2% of the total, Table S6A, Figure 6E) and 9 electrodes in the white matter (1.8% of the 311\ntotal, Table S6B, Figure S9E). For an example electrode located in the white matter, see Figure 312\nS9. Most of these electrodes showed a negative t-statistic, as in the example in Figure 6, and 313\nthree electrodes (20%) showed the reverse effect (i.e., an increase in the neural signal for more 314\ndistant associative memories). For most of these electrodes (73.3%), match was also a significant 315\npredictor, as illustrated by the example in Figure 6A, indicating that the neural signals encoded 316\nboth successful retrieval and memory strength. 317\n318\nNeural signals reflect feedback after the second tile 319\n320\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We first asked 322\nwhether novelty and familiarity were also encoded in the neural responses after the 2nd tile. We 323\nbuilt a separate GLM using the same 15 predictors except for n-since-pair*match (Table 1) to 324\ndescribe the AUC of the gamma power during one second after clicking the 2nd tile. We excluded 325\nn-since-pair*match here because it would always be 1 during match trials (by definition, the first 326\nclick was the pair of the second click). For the second tile, first-click was a significant predictor in 327\n24 electrodes in the gray matter (3.6% of the total, Table S7A, Figure S10E) and 12 in the white 328\nmatter (2.4% of the total, Table S7B). Thus, less than half the number of electrodes reflected 329\nnovelty during the 2nd tile compared to the first tile (cf. Table S7A versus Table S3A and Table 330\nS7B versus Table S3B). For the second tile, n-since-last-click was a significant predictor in 9 331\nelectrodes in the gray matter (1.3% of the total, Table S8A, Figure S10D) and 24 in the white 332\nmatter (4.9% of the total, Table S8B), again, less than half the number of electrodes reflecting 333\nfamiliarity during the first tile (cf. Table S8A versus Table S4A and Table S8B versus Table S4B). 334\nAn example electrode in the LOF region whose responses correlated with familiarity after 335\nthe 2nd tile is shown in Figure S10. The LOF cortex contained significantly more electrodes than 336\nexpected by chance (p<0.01, Methods). Among all the 9 electrodes where n-since-last-click was 337\na significant predictor during the 2nd tile, 7 electrodes also had first-click as a significant predictor 338\n(Figure S10D-E, red circles). In sum, novelty and familiarity of a tile were still encoded in the 339\nneural responses to the second tile, but to a lesser degree than during the responses to the first 340\ntile. This reduction may be due to the fact that two images were presented simultaneously, and 341\nthe neural signals might reflect a weighted combination of the responses to each (45). Moreover, 342\nfor match trials, the information about the 2nd tile does not need to be encoded in memory 343\nanymore to thrive in the task. 344\nAmong the 83 electrodes that had first-click as a significant predictor during the 1st tile 345\nand the 36 electrodes during the 2nd tile (including both gray and white matter), 15 electrodes 346\n(11 gray matter + 4 white matter) overlapped, i.e., first-click was a significant predictor during 347\nboth the 1st and the 2nd tiles.

These electrodes may reflect general 351\nrather than specific novelty or familiarity mechanisms, irrespective of tile order, image content, 352\nor location. 353\nNext, we asked whether the differences between match and mismatch trials were also 354\nmanifested after the 2nd tile was revealed, i.e., after the participant became explicitly aware of 355\nwhether the trial was a match or not. Figure 7 shows an example electrode located in the left 356\ninsula (see arrow in Figure 7E) where match was a significant predictor for the neural responses 357\nafter the 2nd tile (p<0.001, GLM, Figure 7A). The neural signals during match trials were larger 358\nthan during mismatch trials (Figure 7B) and could be readily observed even in single trials (Figure 359\n7C vs. 7D). 360\nAfter the 2nd tile, the match predictor was statistically significant (p<0.01, GLM) for 112 361\nelectrodes in the gray matter (16.6% of the total, Table S9A, Figure 7E) and 66 electrodes in the 362\nwhite matter (13.4% of the total, Table S9B, Figure S11E). For an example electrode in the white 363\nmatter, see Figure S11. The locations of all these electrodes, shown in Figure 7E (gray matter) 364\nand Figure S11E (white matter), reveal that the majority were circumscribed to the LOF and the 365\ninsula. The proportions of significant electrodes in both regions were higher than expected by 366\nchance (p<0.01, Methods). 367\nThere were 17 electrodes in the gray matter and 15 in the white matter where the match 368\npredictor was significant for both the 1st and the 2nd tiles. These electrodes represented 53.1% 369\n(gray matter) and 50% (white matter) of the electrodes that were significant according to the 1st 370\ntile, and 15.2% (gray matter) and 22.8% (white matter) of the electrodes that were significant 371\naccording to the 2nd tile. These electrodes were located in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the 372\nmedial temporal lobe, and the insula (Figure 5E, S6E, 7E, and S11E, red circles). The electrode in 373\nFigure S11 exemplifies such electrodes. The electrode in Figure S8 reveals a continuous 374\nenhancement for match trials after the 1st tile that was sustained and continued after the onset 375\nof the 2nd tile. 376\n377\nA machine learning classifier could predict matches in single trials 378\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For this analysis, we considered only those brain regions 381\nwith more than 12 electrodes combining all participants (Methods). Figure 8 shows the average 382\ndecoding performance of an SVM classifier after 200 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation. At each 383\niteration, the SVM consisted of a binary classifier (match versus mismatch). The predictors were 384\nthe PCA features extracted from the concatenated neural responses of electrodes within a 385\nparticular brain region. The superior parietal gyrus and insula exhibited decoding accuracy above 386\nchance (p<0.01, Methods) during the 1st tile (Figure 8A). The lateral orbitofrontal and middle 387\ntemporal cortex also showed accuracy above chance (>60%, Figure 8A), albeit not statistically 388\nsignificant. As expected based on the responses of individual electrodes, the decoding accuracy 389\nwas higher after the 2nd tile compared to the 1st tile. After the 2nd tile, multiple brain regions 390\nshowed accuracy above chance (p<0.01, Figure 8B). The lateral orbitofrontal cortex, insula, 391\nmiddle temporal gyrus, and pars opercularis showed the highest accuracy (>75%). Similar results 392\nwere obtained when subsampling 12 electrodes during each iteration (Figure S12). 393\n394\nDiscussion 395\n396\nIn this study, we followed the dynamics of neural signals during a natural memory task 397\nbased on a classical card-matching game. Participants performed the task very well, slightly 398\nworse than expected by a perfect memory model (Figure 2A), showing increased reaction times 399\nduring mismatch trials (Figure 2B) as well as decay of memory traces with time since encoding 400\n(Figure 2C-F). The extensive sampling of brain regions afforded by studying the neural activity of 401\nmore than 1,000 electrodes across 20 participants (Figure 3 and Figure S2) enabled us to track 402\nneural responses during each of the steps required in the task with broad brain coverage. 403\nThe first step to encode tile information is to correctly determine whether a tile is novel 404\nor not. We refer to the ability to detect novelty and familiarity as non-associative recognition 405\nmemory (6, 27). Assessment of novelty and familiarity orchestrate encoding and maintenance 406\nstrategies (17, 46). We found strong neural responses that signal novelty and familiarity (Figure 407\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Several electrodes responded both to novelty 408\nand familiarity. In these cases, novel and highly unfamiliar items triggered similar neural 409\nresponses (Figure 4F-G, Figure S4B-C, Figure S10B-C). The lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the pars 410\nopercularis, and the medial temporal lobe contained a preponderance of electrodes signaling 411\nnovelty and familiarity. These responses are reminiscent of novelty and familiarity signals that 412\nhave typically been described in tasks involving a sequence of images presented with occasional 413\nrepetitions (6, 7, 10, 47) but are not restricted to the medial temporal lobe. While some 414\nelectrodes may also encode information about the image content (Figure 4E), the fact that 415\ncorrelates of familiarity can be observed at the level of intracranial field potentials suggests that 416\nthe representation of familiarity may not be content-specific. Different contents with the same 417\nlevel of familiarity may induce the same response, consistent with the observation that neurons 418\ninvolved in memory formation are rarely sharply tuned to particular sensory features (31). 419\nAfter seeing the first tile in a trial, participants could estimate whether they remembered 420\nthe location of its pair and, thus, whether they would get a match or not. Participants link the 421\nfirst tile with its pair to internally predict where to click next. Indeed, neural responses strongly 422\nreflected not only these predictions (Figure 5, Figures S6, S8) but also the internal estimate of 423\nthe strength or the confidence of these predictions (Figure 6). Even though participants could not 424\nknow for sure yet whether the trial would be a match or not, the neural signals demonstrated a 425\nlarge difference between match and mismatch trials after the first tile and before the revelation 426\nof the second tile. These differences were either transient (Figure 5) or sustained (Figure S8). We 427\nspeculate that transient increases in activity during match trials might signal the sudden 428\nrealization and high confidence about the trial outcome (match or mismatch). In contrast, 429\nsustained responses may correspond to the active retrieval processes. It is possible that sustained 430\nactivity could arise due to averaging across temporally shifted transient activities from individual 431\nneurons (48). However, it has been reported that single neurons in the hippocampus can also 432\nshow sustained firing rate increase for successful associative retrieval (49). Extensive work has 433\ndocumented the importance of the hippocampus and surrounding structures in the MTL in 434\nassociative memory (e.g., (6, 29, 49, 50)). In addition to the MTL, the current results show that 435\nother areas, such as the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, also play a critical role in associative recall. 436\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Other studies have examined memory 438\nformation in naturalistic or real-world scenarios at the behavioral level (52-56). The task 439\nintroduced here is in between these two extremes. The card-matching game is more realistic and 440\nadds multiple complexities compared to a sequence of individual images or words. Yet, it allows 441\nfor a high level of control over stimulus timing and experimental parameters that are difficult to 442\nachieve when studying memory in real-world scenarios. The neurophysiological responses 443\ntracked multiple steps in the task, from detecting novel tiles to their subsequent encoding, 444\nassociation, retrieval, and feedback. 445\nComplex and natural tasks necessarily depend on the interplay of multiple intercorrelated 446\nvariables. To tame the complexity of these different variables, we used generalized linear models 447\nto quantitatively assess the influence of distinct predictors on the neural responses. Through 448\nthese GLM analyses, we could characterize neurophysiological responses that were largely 449\ngoverned by individual predictors after accounting for the correlations among predictors (Figure 450\nS3). While focusing on any one predictor, these results were corroborated by subsampling the 451\ndata to equalize other predictor variables that potentially affect the neural responses. Given the 452\ncomplexity of the task and the nature of the intracranial field potential signals studied here, it is 453\nremarkable that it is possible to isolate individual aspects of the task reflected in the 454\nneurophysiological responses. 455\nThe high temporal resolution, extensive spatial sampling, and systematic computational 456\nmodels provide an opportunity to characterize the dynamics of complex naturalistic tasks. These 457\nobservations provide initial steps to further our understanding of how different components of 458\nencoding and retrieval interact during the formation of natural memory events. 459\n460\nMethods 461\n462\nTask paradigm 463\nParticipants performed our implementation of the classical memory matching game 464\n(Figure 1, Movie S1).

A square board containing n \u00d7 n tiles was shown throughout each 466\nblock. In the beginning, all tiles were shown in black. In each trial, participants chose one tile, and 467\nthen a second tile, by clicking on them in a self-paced fashion. Upon clicking, the tile revealed a 468\ncommon object like a cat or an indoor scene like a kitchen. At the end of each trial, either the 469\ntwo tiles revealed the same content (match) or not (mismatch). If the tiles matched, then the two 470\ntiles turned green 1,000 ms after the second click, and the two tiles could not be clicked again for 471\nthe remainder of the block. If the tiles did not match, they turned black 1,000 ms after the second 472\nclick and could be clicked again in subsequent trials. When all tiles turned green, i.e., all matches 473\nwere found, the block ended, and another block began. During each block, the map between 474\npositions and objects was fixed. The game always started with a block of size 3\u00d73 and progressed 475\nto more difficult blocks (4\u00d74, 5\u00d75, 6\u00d76, and finally 7\u00d77). Blocks with an odd number of tiles (3\u00d73, 476\n5\u00d75, and 7\u00d77) contained one distractor object (a human face) with no corresponding pair. For 477\neach block except the 3\u00d73 board, there was a limit for the total time elapsed (2 minutes for 4\u00d74, 478\n3.3 min for 5\u00d75, 4.8 min for 6\u00d76, and 8.2 min for 7x7). If a participant did not complete a block 479\nwithin the time limit, the block ended, and a new, easier block started by reducing the board size 480\nn by 1, except when n=7, where it was reduced by 2. Conversely, when participants successfully 481\ncompleted a block with a board of size n within the allotted time limit, they moved on to a more 482\ndifficult block by increasing n by 1. When participants completed an n=7 block, they performed 483\nfurther n=7 blocks. There was no image repetition across blocks. 484\nAll the images were from the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation dataset (57) and were 485\nrendered in grayscale and square shape. We included a balanced number of pictures from 5 486\ncategories: person, animal, food, vehicle, and indoor scenes. All the images were rendered on a 487\n13-inch Apple MacBook Pro laptop. The size of each tile was 0.75\u00d70.75 inches (approximately 2x2 488\ndegrees of visual angle, dva) and the separation between two adjacent tiles was 0.125 inch (0.33 489\ndva) for board size n=7 and 0.25 inch (0.67 dva) for the others. The game implementation was 490\nwritten and presented using the Psychtoolbox extension (58, 59) in Matlab_2016b (Mathworks, 491\nNatick, MA). 492\n493\nEpilepsy participants and recording procedures 494\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

All recording sessions were seizure-free. All patients had normal or 498\ncorrected-to-normal vision. The study protocol was approved by each hospital's institutional 499\nreview board. Experiments were run under patients' or their legal guardians' informed consent. 500\nOne patient at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) was implanted with both stereo 501\nencephalography (sEEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes, while all other patients had 502\nonly sEEG electrodes (Ad-tech, USA; ALCIS, France). Intracranial field potentials were recorded 503\nwith Natus (Pleasanton, CA) and Micromed (Italy). The sampling rate was 2048 Hz at Boston 504\nChildren's Hospital, 512 Hz or 1024 Hz at BWH, and 512 Hz at Xuanwu Hospital. Electrode 505\ntrajectories were determined based on clinical purposes for precisely localizing suspected 506\nepileptogenic foci and surgically treating epilepsy (60). 507\n508\nEye tracking procedures 509\nTen non-epilepsy healthy participants (23-35 years old, 9 female) performed the same 510\ntask while their eye movements were tracked with the EyeLink 1000 plus system (SR Research, 511\nCanada) at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The task paradigm was the same as the one for epilepsy 512\nparticipants except that, before each block began, participants fixated on a center cross to ensure 513\nthat the EyeLink eye-tracking system was well-calibrated. Otherwise, a re-calibration session 514\nensued. The task was presented on a 19-inch CRT monitor (Sony Multiscan G520), and 515\nparticipants sat about 21 inches away from the monitor screen. The tile size was 1x1 inches 516\n(approximately 2.7x2.7 degrees of visual angle) as appeared on the screen. The study protocol 517\nwas approved by the institutional review board at Boston Children's Hospital, and each 518\nparticipant completed the task with informed consent.

The perfect memory model remembered all 524\nrevealed tiles without forgetting. The random model simulated random clicking. We calculated 525\nthe reaction time (RT, time between two clicks in a trial), n-since-pair (number of clicks since the 526\nlast time when a tile's matching pair was seen), n-since-last-click (the number of clicks since the 527\nsame tile was clicked), and n-times-seen (number of times the same image had been seen). For 528\nn-since-pair and n-since-last-click, we excluded trials in which any tile was seen for the first time, 529\ni.e., when a tile's matching pair had never been revealed, or there was no previous click. We 530\ncompared these variables for match and mismatch trials at each board size (Figure 2, 531\npermutation test, 5,000 iterations, a=0.01). We defined random matches as a match trial where 532\nthe second tile had never been seen before; such trials were excluded from both the behavioral 533\nand neurophysiological analyses. We used the F-test for linear regression models to assess 534\nwhether RT, n-since-pair, n-since-last-click, and n-times-seen significantly covary with board size. 535\nThe linear regression models' predictors were these four behavioral parameters and the 536\ndependent variable the board size. We created separate models for match and mismatch trials 537\nand 1st and 2nd tiles. 538\n539\nElectrode localization 540\nElectrodes were localized using the iELVis (61) toolbox. We used Freesurfer (62) to 541\nsegment the preimplant magnetic resonance (MR) images, upon which post-implant CT was 542\nrigidly registered. Electrodes were marked in the CT aligned to preimplant MRI using Bioimage 543\nSuite (63). Each electrode was assigned to an anatomical location using the Desikan-Killiany (64) 544\natlas for subdural grids or strips or FreeSurfer's volumetric brain segmentation for depth 545\nelectrodes. For white matter electrodes, we also reported their closest gray matter locations. Out 546\nof 1,750 electrodes in total, we included 676 bipolarly referenced electrodes in the gray matter 547\n(Figure 3, Table S2) and 492 bipolarly referenced electrodes in the white matter (Figure S2, Table 548\nS2). Five hundred eighty-two electrodes were not considered for analyses due to bipolar 549\nreferencing, locations in pathological sites, or electrodes containing large artifacts.

A zero-phase digital notch filter (Matlab function 556\n\"filtfilt\") was applied to the bipolarly subtracted broadband signals to remove the line frequency 557\nat 60 Hz (BCH, BWH) or 50 Hz (Xuanwu) and their harmonics. For each electrode, trials whose 558\namplitudes (Voltagemax-Voltagemin) were larger than 5 standard deviations from the mean 559\namplitude across all trials were considered potential artifacts and discarded from further 560\nanalyses (67). For the first tile, the time window for artifact rejection was from 400 ms before the 561\nclick until 1 second after the average RT. For the second tile, the time window was [400 ms + 562\naverage RT] before the second click until 1 second after the second click. Across all electrodes, 563\nwe rejected 1.75% of all trials for the 1st tile and 1.73% for the second tile. 564\n565\nTime-frequency decomposition 566\nThe gamma band (30-150 Hz) power was computed using the Chronux toolbox (68). We 567\nused a time-bandwidth product of 5 and 7 leading tapers, a moving window size of 200 ms, and 568\na step size of 10 ms (69). For each trial, the power was normalized by subtracting the mean 569\ngamma band power during the baseline (400 ms before 1st tile) and dividing by the standard 570\ndeviation of the gamma power during the baseline. For all the participants, there were more 571\nmismatch than match trials. In the raster plots, we subsampled the mismatch trials, keeping 572\nthose trials whose reaction times were closest to the mean reaction time of match trials. All 573\nrandom matches were excluded from analyses. 574\n575\nGeneralized linear model 576\nWe used generalized linear models (GLM) (70, 71) to analyze the relationship between 577\nthe gamma band power and behavioral parameters.

For the first GLM, the time window started when the 1st tile was clicked and ended at a 580\ntime corresponding to the 90th percentile of the distribution of reaction times (time difference 581\nbetween the 1st and the 2nd click, Figure 1A) for each participant. This criterion was a reasonable 582\ntradeoff between minimum overlap with responses after the 2nd tile and the maximum amount 583\nof information captured. For the second GLM, we used 1 second after the 2nd tile click as the 584\nanalysis window. The response variable to be fit by the GLM analyses was defined as the area 585\nunder the curve (AUC) of the gamma band power over the specified time windows. Table 1 586\ndescribes the behavioral parameters that were considered as predictors in the models. 587\nWe performed a multicollinearity analysis to assess the presence of highly correlated 588\npredictors that could impair the model's performance (72, 73). We calculated the variance 589\ninflation factor (VIF) for each predictor to detect the presence of multicollinearities. A VIF of 1 590\nindicates that there is no correlation with other predictors. The larger the VIF, the higher the 591\ncorrelation. A VIF greater than 5 indicates a very high correlation that could significantly harm 592\nthe model's performance. For all participants in our analysis, the VIFs of all predictors were 593\nsmaller than 3 (Figure S3C-D). 594\nFor n-since-pair, we included the interaction term between this predictor and match (n-595\nsince-pair*match) to test the hypothesis that when a trial was a match, the strength of the neural 596\nresponse after the first tile was modulated by how recently the tile's matching pair was seen for 597\nthe last time. The neurophysiological responses confirmed that this is a reasonable way to model 598\nthe data (Figure 6B). We represented image categories as predictor variables in the GLM by 599\nincluding four out of the five categories (animal, food, vehicle, and person). We dropped the 600\n\"indoor\" category to avoid falling into the \"dummy variable trap\" (74). For each predictor, we 601\ncalculated the parameter estimate (beta coefficient) from the least mean squares fit of the model 602\nto the data, the t-statistic (beta divided by its standard error), and the p-value to test the effect 603\nof each predictor on the neural responses. A beta coefficient or t-statistic of zero indicated that 604\nthe predictor did not affect the neural responses. A predictor was considered statistically 605\nsignificant if the GLM model differed from a constant model (p<0.01) and the p-value for that 606\npredictor was smaller than 0.01. 607\n.CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Taking the match predictor 611\nfor gray matter electrodes as an example, from the total of 676 gray matter electrode locations, 612\nwe randomly sampled 32 electrodes (the number of match-significant gray matter electrodes) 613\n5,000 times, and calculated the p-value of any location, say insula, as the number of times when 614\nn for insula and match-significant was less than n for insula sampled. If p<0.01, that brain region 615\nwas considered to have significantly more electrodes than expected by chance. 616\n617\nDecoding of match 618\nWe used a machine learning decoding approach to evaluate whether the neural 619\nresponses from a given brain region could predict whether the trial was a match or a mismatch. 620\nFor this analysis, we selected only those brain regions in which we had at least 12 electrodes. We 621\nused two different decoders for each brain region, one using neural responses between the 1st 622\ntile and 800 ms after the 1st tile click, and the other using the neural responses between the 2nd 623\ntile and 800 ms after the 2nd tile click. We performed 200 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation for 624\neach brain region and tile to split the trials into independent train and test sets (1,000 splits in 625\ntotal). We concatenated the neural responses of electrodes within the same brain region, using 626\ntwo different approaches: (i) taking all electrodes in each brain region, and (ii) randomly 627\nsubsampling 12 electrodes at each iteration. The number of match and mismatch trials was 628\nnormalized by random subsampling. To reduce the dimensionality of the neural responses, we 629\nused principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA parameters were computed using only the 630\ntraining data, and we selected the number of components that could explain 70% of the training 631\nneural responses variance. We used support vector machines (SVM) with a linear kernel for the 632\nbinary classification (match or mismatch), using as the model inputs the PCA features computed 633\nfrom the neural responses. We followed the same procedure to test whether the classification 634\nperformance was above chance, but we randomized the response variable (match or mismatch) 635\nat every iteration.

Experimental paradigm 814\nA-C. Three consecutive trials in a 3\u00d73 board. In each trial, two tiles were flipped sequentially in a 815 self-paced manner (1st tile, then 2nd tile). If the two tiles contained different images (A, C, 816 mismatch), both tiles reset to their original active (black) state after 1 second. If both tiles 817 contained the same image (B, match), they turned green after 1 second and stayed green for the 818 remainder of the block. Three behavioral predictors used in the generalized linear models (GLM) 819 are defined here: reaction time (the time between the 1st and 2nd tile within a trial), n-since-last-820 click (the number of clicks elapsed since the same tile was clicked last), and n-since-pair (the 821 number of clicks elapsed since the last time a given tile\u2019s matching pair was clicked). Each tile 822 spanned approximately 2 degrees of visual angle (dva) in size.

The 843 performance of epilepsy patients 844 was better than the random model 845 and worse than the perfect model. 846 The number of clicks per tile 847 increased as board size 848 incremented. B.
