The corresponding process continuously transforms gas precursors into aerosols into aerogels into macroscopic nanotextiles.

This paper reviews progress in the application of such manufacturing process to nanotubes and nanowires.

We summarise emerging descriptions of the formation of aerogels through percolation theory and multi-scale models for the collision and aggregation of 1D nanoparticles. The paper shows that macroscopic ensembles of 1D nanoparticles resemble textiles in their porous network structure, high flexibility and damage-tolerance. Their bulk properties depend strongly on inter-particle properties and are dominated by alignment and volume fraction.

Many of their applications, such as electrodes, membranes, and structural elements, require forming macroscopic ensembles composed of a myriad of these building blocks. The challenge of assembling high aspect ratio particles into macroscopic materials resembles the early development of macromolecular materials based on synthetic polymers and gives a glimpse of the enormous transformative impact nanoparticles can have.\nProcessing or assembly of these high aspect ratio inorganic building blocks is challenging. They are much longer than traditional nanofillers, much thicker than polymer chains and much smaller than monolithic materials. Dispersion-based processes can be extremely effective at low volume fractions and have multiple applications, but can become increasingly ineffective as the nanoparticle length increases. One inherent limitation is the rapid increase in viscosity with increasing aspect ratio and/or volume fraction.1 Similarly, thermodynamic considerations imply that higher aspect ratio nanoparticles require increasingly higher dilution to disperse them.2 A typical dispersion of individualised high aspect ratio nanoparticles has a concentration of 10\u22122 mg ml\u22121, or about 105 times more volume of solvent than nanofillers, and requires previous stages of purification and centrifugation.3\nAn emerging alternative is to synthesise 1D nanoparticles (nanotubes or nanowires) suspended in the gas phase and directly assemble them into macroscopic network materials, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, circumventing the need for dispersion processes. In essence, the process consists in the aerosol-catalysed synthesis of high aspect ratio nanoparticles that can aggregate to form an aerogel which can be shaped as a freestanding macroscopic nanotextile. Growth of 1D nanoparticles through floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FCCVD) is about 1000 times faster than substratebased processes, leading to the synthesis of ultra-long nanoparticles that can form macroscopic networks and have translated into some of the best performing structural materials, transparent conductors and battery anodes. This manuscript sets out to review progress in using FCCVD for the synthesis of new high-performance macroscopic materials and identifies pressing open questions in the field. For clarity and to help unify similar concepts across different scientific communities, we include a glossary in the Appendix."

            "text": "A timeline with breakthroughs in the synthesis and assembly of 1D nanoparticles by FCCVD is presented in Fig. 2. The initial evolution in synthesis of 1D nanoparticles by FCCVD occurred largely through parallel developments in the fields of nanocarbon and nanowire growth. The first reports of the synthesis of 1D nanoparticles via FCCVD date from the 80s, corresponding to vapour-grown carbon fibres (VGCFs) produced through the thermocatalytic decomposition of carbon sources in the presence of a transition metal aerosol in continuous flow reactors.4,5 Early work on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) drew heavily from methods used for VGCF growth. Growth of CNTs from aerosol catalysts enabled large advances in the controlled synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)6 and its early scale-up.7\nA breakthrough came when the addition of sulphur during FCCVD produced a large increase in CNT length, and thus to their entanglement in the gas phase and formation of freestanding strands.8 Soon after, use of different precursors and changes in synthesis reaction conditions led to the demonstration of spinning of continuous macroscopic sheets and fibres directly drawn from aerogels of CNTs synthesised by FCCVD.9 Intense research activity on CNT fibres has followed ever since. Bulk fibre with better properties than the best engineering materials have been reported after improvements\nin CNT synthesis and assembly.18,19 The CNT fibre manufacturing process continues to evolve but is now much better understood20\u201322 and is used in scaled up industrial facilities. Improvements to control CNT molecular features (diameter and number of layers) and aggregation23 under dilute reaction conditions have also translated into high-performance transparent conductors24 and optoelectronic elements25 based on networks of CNTs.\nStemming from CNT research, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) were grown by FCCVD at Berkeley and the AFOSR.12,26 Order-of-magnitude increases in growth rate were later obtained when using a high-pressure plasma reactor system.14 Several studies have followed on the synthesis27,28 of BNNTs and the properties of their macroscopic ensembles.29,30\nIn parallel to this work on nanotubes, Samuelson\u2019s research group at Lund University achieved the first demonstration of nanowire synthesis by FCCVD. Nanowires of GaAs were grown in the gas phase using an aerosol of Au nanoparticles as the catalyst; they coined the term \u201caerotaxy\u201d to refer to this process.13 Crucially, it was noted that growth rate in FCCVD was 20\u20131000 times higher than with substrate-bound catalysts. Extensive work followed on achieving compositional control,15,31 understanding and controlling flow patterns in continuous reactors,32 and scaling up manufacture for optoelectronic applications.33\u201335\nRecently, we demonstrated the growth of two additional types of nanowires by FCCVD and their assembly into macroscopic structures directly from the gas phase, Si nanowires (SiNWs),16 and separately, SiC nanowires (SiCNWs).17 Their growth rate by FCCVD is also 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than in substrate-based CVD (SCVD). FCCVD-produced SiNW networks have extraordinary mechanical properties and extremely high electrochemical capacity for Li-ion storage as anodes in batteries.36\nEvidence suggests the feasibility of synthesising over 100 different 1D inorganic nanoparticles via FCCVD. This implies that FCCVD can be a universal process for the synthesis and direct assembly of 1D nanoparticles into macroscopic network materials with high-performance properties. To review progress in this quest, we divide the process into three areas following the direction of the synthetic path (Fig. 1): first, the growth region where particles form an aerosol; next, the assembly of 1D nanoparticles to form aggregates and ultimately an aerogel; and finally the structure and bulk properties as denser network materials."

            "text": "CVD, catalysis and aerosol science\nIt is instructive to analyse 1D nanoparticle growth by FCCVD by comparison with conventional substrate-based CVD, its parent process. Based on current mechanistic understanding, in SCVD growth of 1D nanoparticles catalyst particles predeposited on a substrate are exposed to precursors at high temperature; the precursor material incorporates into the catalyst through migration of adatoms on the surface or through direct impingement; the excess of precursor material in the catalyst alloy leads to nucleation at the substrate interface and to epitaxial growth of sequential crystal monolayers. In FCCVD, the catalyst nanoparticles are suspended in the gas phase as an aerosol. The current view is that inclusion of adatoms comes mainly from direct influx. Nucleation occurs at the surface of the nanoparticles and the nanowire grows from progressive segregation of the precursor as a solid product. In both modes, the vapour\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) growth mechanism is the most common. The differences between conventional substrate-based CVD and FCCVD are seemingly subtle, but have deep implications for the reaction conditions and the resulting solid products. Table 1 summarises the main features of the two synthesis modes.\nReaction temperature (\u00b0C) Limited by side reactions contaminating\nthin film Allows higher Temp.\nGrowth velocity (nm s-1) 0.1 \u2013 100 100 \u2013 106\nCatalyst particle size Control through patterning Limited control through aerosol\nselection\nReaction products\nEnsemble format Vertically aligned and attached to\nsubstrate\nFrom random to preferentially aligned networks\n1D nanoparticle materials synthesized > 70 CNT, GaAs(P)NW, BNNT, SiNW, SiCNW\nA fundamental difference is that FCCVD is conducted with the catalyst aerosol, precursors and reaction gases, all flowing through the reactor vessel (typically a ceramic tube). This reaction mode resembles a continuous tubular reactor typically idealised as a plug flow reactor (PFR). For FCCVD processes, it is employed using very short residence times and a nonconstant temperature profile. In less than about 60 s, the species travel through the length of the tube and are exposed to a temperature profile with a heating gradient of up to 50 \u00b0C cm\u22121. In that time, the precursors decompose, get incorporated in the catalyst and are segregated as ultra-long nanowires/ nanotubes. The same process typically takes 100 times longer in conventional SCVD. And very importantly, in SCVD there is usually continuous precursor feed to the stationary catalyst and the reaction zone temperature is nominally constant and uniform. This reaction mode resembles a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of the two reactor modes.\nIn substrate growth of nanowires at low pressure, growth rate follows a dependence of the form r\u2212p, where r is the catalyst radius and p is an exponent between 0.5 and 2 depending on growth conditions.37 A known model suggests that this dependence is due to growth being limited by diffusion of adatoms to the catalyst from the substrate and the nanowire surface (Fig. 4A and B).38 In such description, impingement of precursors or adatoms directly on the catalyst is explicitly neglected.\nIn FCCVD, the growth rate of GaAs,32 SiNWs or SiCNWs at higher pressures shows no such dependence on nanowire radius (Fig. 4C). Johansson et al. have extended the substrate-based model to analyse the growth of inorganic nanowires from catalyst aerosols at high partial pressure.39 Their analysis indicates that at the relatively high pressure used so far in FCCVD\n(>100 Pa) growth is limited by adatom incorporation, hence independent of pressure in this regime, as shown by the effect of partial pressure of group V precursors in Fig. 4D.\nPerhaps the most striking feature of FCCVD is the exceptionally fast growth rate observed for all nanowires and nanotubes so far produced with this method. This fast growth rate has also translated into high nanowire aspect ratios, which is desired for bulk applications, as discussed in Section 5.\nFig. 5 presents a comparison of reported growth rates for nanowires of GaAs, Si and SiC, and nanotubes of C and BN. For this comparison, we take the nanowire length increase over total growth time, thus assuming a constant growth rate. For FCCVD, given the exceptionally fast process, even determining an averaged growth rate constant is challenging. Lower limits of growth rate have been estimated by identifying the region in flow reactors where nanowires/nanotubes are formed, although with significant uncertainty.17,20\nThe comparison evidences that 1D nanoparticles inherently grow between 10 and 1000 times faster via FCCVD than SCVD. For VGCFs and CNTs, this has been previously attributed to the presence of sulphur40 and to the higher reaction temperatures used in FCCVD, which could affect reaction kinetics or change the catalyst state from solid to liquid.41 However, data for nanowire growth show a faster rate at equal reaction temperature, and at least for SiNWs, without suspected changes in solidification from the eutectic. In addition, all experimental data points in Fig. 5 correspond to growth conditions at high partial pressures. The indication is that this is a general feature of FCCVD. It produces order of magnitude faster growth rate than SCVD across all 1D nanoparticles, irrespective of the specific composition of the 1D crystal or the composition of the catalyst.\nThe two growth modes operate in different regimes. Overall, SCVD is considered to be in a regime limited by the diffusion of precursors and/or adatoms to the catalyst. In contrast, in FCCVD these diffusion limitations are not present, removing this rate-limiting step. Instead, the relatively narrow band of growth rates when plotted in atoms per second (in Fig. 5B) suggests that in FCCVD the limiting process is the rate of crystal step growth. This would mean that growth rate by FCCVD approaches the limit for VLS growth. The question, then, is about the differences in reaction conditions in FCCVD and SCVD leading to these two different regimes.\nEarly work proposed that FCCVD prevents the formation of a \u201cdepletion layer\u201d by elimination of the substrate.13 The premise is that in SCVD, the local concentration of the precursor is progressively reduced during nanowire growth, presumably due to the presence of precursor decomposition by-products in the vicinity of the catalyst and a longer diffusion path. This mechanism is plausible for a root-growth process, where the catalyst remains anchored to the substrate, but less so for tip-growth, which is also common for CNTs.\nThe concept of a depletion layer may not fully explain the differences in growth rate but does identify the importance of precursor availability. More precisely, FCCVD and SCVD are expected to have different rates of impingement of precursor molecules (or their derivatives) on the catalyst. In substrate-based CVD (in a CSTR), the temperature and catalyst concentration and size are constant, so the impingement rate is governed by precursor availability, which is constant under equilibrium in the reactor and assuming no changes in the diffusion path to reach the catalyst. For FCCVD, both the catalyst and the precursor are mobile and collide in the gas phase. The impingement rate is the collision rate. For typical distances between particles/molecules in FCCVD, such impingement rate might also depend on intermolecular forces between the catalyst and precursor.57\nA way to rationalise the difference observed between FCCVD and SCVD processes is to observe the intrinsic differences between both processes. If one assumes that the critical step in nanowire growth is the formation of reactive radicals in the bulk gas, then the distance between such a radical and the closest available catalyst particle can be computed using Monte Carlo simulations for both FCCVD and SCVD processes using standard conditions for comparison. Fig. 6A shows the average catalyst-radical species separation assuming a concentration of 108 part per cm3, as reported in experimental FCCVD studies.16,17 For the SCVD case, the assumption is a 1 cm3 cube with 32 nm catalyst particles at the bottom with a\ndensity of 82 particles per \u03bcm2. The predicted distance distribution of a randomly created radical due to Arrhenius type\nof activated collision is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller in the FCCVD case than in the SCVD case. Such a difference, along with the absence of major spatial constraints, i.e., radicals can impinge from almost any direction, could be the reason why FCCVD has been experimentally shown to be also orders of magnitude faster than conventional SCVD processes. This distance difference would be critical in the case of non-ballistic type of catalyst\u2013reagent radical interaction,57 especially if a competing reaction can deplete the radical availability and reduce selectivity.58 Another implication of shorter distances is the capability of maximizing precursor utilization with respect to the gas volume, resulting in higher production capacity.13\ncatalyst particles (82 part per \u03bcm2 \u00d7 1 cm2). The same particle diameter is used in both cases and the distance distribution is then calculated using Monte Carlo generated radicals in the control volume.\n3.1 Reaction selectivity\nAs in other transformation processes, FCCVD can produce other products in addition to 1D nanoparticles. The interest is in understanding the dominant factors enabling high reaction selectivity towards 1D nanoparticles. Of the multiple additional possible products, we focus on the predominant solid materials typically found in these reactions. The analysis ignores reactions at the walls of the reactor, which can be significant contributors to precursor depletion57 and/or decomposition.59\nThe first type is non-catalysed solids, essentially nanoparticles that nucleate either in the gas-phase or as a layer on the surface of the nanoparticle. Various catalyst-free methods pursue the growth of similar nanoparticles as aerosols, but for the purpose of making macroscopic network materials, they are undesired impurities analogous to carbon soot. Examples of \u201csoot\u201d particles of GaAs, Si, and SiC found in the synthesis of different nanowires by FCCVD are included in Fig. 7.\nThe formation of soot over nanowires can be accurately analysed for Au-catalysed Si by FCCVD. At the low temperature required for SiNW growth the Si soot formed is amorphous, hence enabling discrimination of the two products and\nquantification of the mass fraction of each product, for instance using Raman spectroscopy and XRD. (For the study in\nref. 58, the mass fraction of SiNWs relative to all solid products is equal to the degree of sample crystallinity, C\u02c9.) Therefore, these measurements provide a direct metric for selectivity under different reaction conditions.\nSoot and related solid products are preferentially formed in the absence of hydrogen, hence why a hydrogen atmosphere is used in FCCVD growth of CNTs,20 SiCNWs17 and SiNWs58 and gas-phase growth of BNNTs.60 They also form at high precursor concentrations (in nitrogen) for GaAsNW FCCVD synthesis.32\nIn SiNW growth by FCCVD, at a low SiH4/H2 ratio, nearly 100% selectivity to SiNWs can be achieved. Higher ratios, for instance, by augmenting precursor availability, produce increasingly more nucleation of amorphous nanoparticles, i.e., Si soot, which grows in addition to the SiNWs (Fig. 7E). The quantification of catalysed and non-catalysed solid products, combined with a relatively simple decomposition route for SiH4, enables a quantitative description of the role of hydrogen in controlling reaction selectivity for SiNWs. Hydrogen inhibits the decomposition of silane into derivatives that would otherwise polymerise into amorphous Si nanoparticles, according to the reactions in Fig. 8A. The experimental data for conversion and selectivity could be fitted to a reaction model using a combination of literature data for the kinetics of non-catalysed formation of Si nanoparticles, an expression for growth velocity of nanowires and a proposed reaction mechanism based on the silylene radical (Fig. 8B).58\nLooking ahead, it is of interest to produce a similar description of the competing reactions in the growth of other 1D nanoparticles. Amongst the data required from experiment and modelling are (i) a measure of the mass and particle number concentration of solid reaction products, (ii) kinetic expressions describing the rate of soot formation, (iii) kinetic expressions for nanowire growth, and (iv) a tentative reaction mechanism tree with dominant paths.\nThe other type of undesired products is solids produced through the catalyst, but different from the target nanowires. These may consist of a nucleated shell or nanowires of different morphology or composition from the desired one.\nIn the growth of nanowires by FCCVD, the observation is that under successful conditions for nanowire growth, all the catalyst that travels through the flow reactor produces nanowires. As shown in the example in Fig. 9, inspection of solid products collected from the gas phase consistently shows that all catalyst nanoparticles are at the tip of nanowires. This is generally observed for growth of 1D nanoparticles of Si, SiC and GaAs. In contrast, in FCCVD growth of carbon nanotubes, the vast majority of the catalyst does not produce CNTs. The example in Fig. 9 shows a typical aerogel of CNTs with multiple residual catalyst particles attached to them. From the knowledge of CNT dimensions and the mass fraction of C and Fe, it is estimated that only 0.05 at% of Fe nanoparticles produce CNTs.56 From ex situ analysis, most of the catalyst corresponds to metallic nanoparticles encapsulated with a graphitic shell (Fig. 9B). Residual core\u2013shell particles have been found irrespective of the choice of transition metals used as the catalyst in FCCVD growth of CNTs.\nGiven their extreme abundance, we consider possible formation mechanisms as alternative reaction paths to CNT growth. One possibility is that the shell segregates upon cooling. For such a case, these catalysts may be considered inactive for the production of any solid nucleus, let alone growing CNTs. There are no in situ experimental measurements to discard this scenario, but it seems the more improbable. From a simple mass balance calculation, the minimum mass fraction of C in a metal catalyst nanoparticle to produce a shell is approximately 1/(1 + 2\u03a6) (with \u03a6, the nanoparticle diameter, in nanometres).61 For small particles, for instance \u03a6 = 1 nm, the mass fraction (33%) is much larger than the concentration in the Fe\u2013C eutectic (4.3%), although they become comparable for particle diameters above around 8 nm.\nMore likely, the shell forms in the reaction zone, causing encapsulation of the catalyst and thus impeding CNT growth. After all, an encapsulating graphitic shell can be the most likely solid product for an sp2-hybridised crystal in the absence\nof an interface with a substrate. As a corollary, it follows that this alternative reaction path is governed by the crystal structure and surface energy of the nucleus and 1D nanostructure, hence prominent for nanotubes but not for nanowires. From this perspective, selectivity towards nanotubes requires preventing catalyst encapsulation. Promotors used in CNT growth by FCCVD are thought to form biphasic catalyst particles,21,62 which may reduce encapsulation probability. Indeed, the addition of sulphur as the promoter increases conversion in FCCVD CNT growth;63 however, it is challenging to separate its effect on CNT thickness and number concentration.\nThe bulk equilibrium phase diagram provides more insight into the reaction conditions leading to selective growth of specific nanowires. Analysing the nanowire nucleation process as a solidification of a bulk alloy is a simplification, but some experimental observations argue in favour of it. For example, the minimum experimental temperatures used for growth of various nanotubes and nanowires by FCCVD are close to the eutectic temperature on the corresponding phase diagram (Table 2). In addition, decomposition of precursors is likely to be fast compared to the residence times. Decomposition of ferrocene, a source of Fe catalyst, is estimated at a maximum of 0.1 s under experimental conditions,20 for example.\nOne strategy to use thermodynamic equilibrium phase data is to represent the nanowire nucleation process as a trajectory in the isothermal phase diagram starting at the catalyst end and moving towards the constituent(s) of the nanowire. Fig. 10 shows examples for CNTs and SiCNWs. Relevant for CNTs grown by FCCVD, the Fe\u2013S\u2013C ternary diagram at high temperature (Fig. 10A) presents an Fe-rich liquid (L), and two immiscible liquids, one rich in C (L1) and the other in S (L2). At high C contents, the immiscible liquids are in equilibrium with solid C (L1 + L2 + C(s)). The hypothesis indicates that this composition range produces a graphitic shell, which thus encapsulates the catalyst and prevents CNT growth. Growth of CNTs is thought to occur for lower S compositions at the boundary between L and L1 + L2, where solid C is not in equilibrium and thus gets ejected as the sidewalls of a CNT. The envisaged mechanism for CNT growth in these conditions is shown in Fig. 10B. An S-containing shell is predicted by the phase diagram upon cooling and observed experimentally.62,64\nThe calculated Fe\u2013Si\u2013C phase diagram has also been recently applied to rationalise the growth of SiCNWs (Fig. 10C\u2013 E).17 The SiC nanowires were produced using an aerosol of Fe using a precursor containing both C and Si, under a hydrogen atmosphere. The synthesis conditions used did not produce CNTs or SiNWs, despite being close to those used when targeting such 1D nanoparticles. Fig. 10D shows the calculated trajectory on the Fe\u2013Si\u2013C phase diagram starting from the catalyst and increasing Si\u2013C content according to the stoichiometry of the precursor. The phase fractions are illustrated in Fig. 10E. For this and other trajectories, a liquid is first formed. Upon segregation of C the liquid moves down to the Sirich corner. When the Si solubility of the liquid is exceeded, SiC is then segregated. The implication is that provided both Si and C are incorporated into the catalyst, the expected solid product is predominantly SiC.\nBy way of summary, in Fig. 11 we present a schematic of the main solid products and corresponding reaction paths for nanotubes and nanowires. It includes estimates of the catalyst mass fraction distributions, which highlight how seemingly similar growth processes, namely nanotube and nanowire growth, lead to diametrically opposite use of catalysts supplied and different competing reactions that can reduce selectivity.\n3.2 Nanowire/nanotube control\nThe most direct way to control the diameter of 1D nanoparticles produced by VLS is through the size of the catalyst particle. For substrate-based CVD growth, seed particles are deposited/formed onto the substrate prior to growth, from colloidal dispersions, thin films or using lithography. This enables large control over particle size distribution and position on the substrate. For the floating catalyst, the nanoparticles are formed as an aerosol either via chemical means such as in situ decomposition of catalyst precursors (e.g., ferrocene),21 or by physical means, including the formation of an aerosol through thermal evaporation16 or spark discharge65 of the catalyst material before entry into the FCCVD reactor.66,67 These aerosol methods produce catalyst particles with a broad size distribution. The size distribution may be reduced using particle size selection methods or in-line sintering, but at the expense of reducing catalyst concentration. Typical particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 12A.\nIn nanowire growth by FCCVD, there is a broad correspondence between nanowire diameter and catalyst size, provided NW tapering (the process by which the bottom of the NW is thicker than the top) is avoided. This correspondence has been observed for Si, SiC and GaAs. An example of a SiNW diameter distribution is included in Fig. 12B. The nanowire diameter distributions are log\u2013normal, with geometric standard deviation > 1.36, as summarized in Table 3, which follows the expectation for an aerosol of metallic catalyst particles.68\nFor nanotube growth by FCCVD, its outer diameter is approximately the same as the size of its catalyst particle. However, as noted before, only a very small fraction of aerosol particles form nanotubes. This is also evident when considering the diameter distribution of nanotubes produced by FCCVD. As shown in Fig. 12B, this distribution is at the low end compared to that of nanowires and represents a minute fraction of the catalyst aerosol in the absence of size selection methods.\nWhereas in nanowire growth by FCCVD diameter can be controlled using established aerosol methods,35 controlling inner and outer diameters of nanotubes is more challenging and additionally requires intervention at the stage of incorporation of the precursor and the composition of the catalyst.\nThis has been achieved through control of injection of precursors and gases,22 optimization of residence times,72 and introduction of group 16 elements.21\nAt present, the FCCVD process would seem to offer limited scope to narrow the distribution of 1D nanoparticle diameter closer to a monodisperse distribution, which is a requirement for some applications in optoelectronics. For those applications, SCVD with pre-formed monodispersed catalysts prevented from coalescence represents a better alternative.\n3.3 Throughput\nAs a general chemical process, CVD-based growth of 1D nanoparticles is considered scalable. CNTs are produced in fluidised bed reactors in fully industrialised facilities with a capacity of the order of 2 kt per year per plant. Synthesis of SiNWs in laboratory-scale fluidised bed reactors with a scalable process based on silica nanoparticles resembling geodes has been recently demonstrated.73 Specifically concerning FCCVD, the oldest scaled-up example is VGCF production. Industrial-grade VGCFs have been available for decades at relatively large industrial facilities with a reported capacity of tens of tons per site as early as 2001.74\nDespite the seemingly inherent scalability of CVD-based reactions, FCCVD growth of 1D nanoparticles is mostly operated at a low throughput in research facilities. Throughput in laboratory-scale reactors is at grams per day and at several pilot plant industrial facilities still estimated below a kilogram per day. A detailed analysis of the scalability of FCCVD is beyond the scope of this paper, but a review of reactor operation conditions on the laboratory scale can provide general indicators of progress independent of reactor size.\nA figure of merit for productivity of industrial catalytic processes is the ratio of mass produced per reactor volume and unit time. Analysis of industrial production of fuels and chemicals suggests a threshold for industrial viability of 0.1 t (m3 h)\u22121.75 Laboratory-scale reactors for FCCVD synthesis of CNTs and NWs typically produce less than 1 g h\u22121, with a productivity of around 10\u22125 t (m3 h)\u22121 (Table 4).\na Data for pilot plant reactor, courtesy of Grupo Antol\u00edn. b European Commission \u2013 European IPPC Bureau \u2013 large volume inorganic chemicals, solids and other industry.\nCommon values for the parameters currently employed in the process, as well as others related to precursor conversion for nanoparticle growth, are included in Table 4 and compared to industrial processes (note that the residence time included in Table 4 corresponds to the estimated reaction residence time, rather than the total time of precursor flow in the reactor).\nUnder perfect conversion and 100% selectivity, the process may be limited by the rate of solidification, in which case the throughput is the product of the number of catalyst particles and nanowire growth rate. From the experimental data in Fig. 5, the nanowire growth rate is of the order of 10\u221213 g s\u22121. For the residence times used in FCCVD of 1\u201310 s and assuming no losses to the walls, the catalyst concentration can reach 109 cm\u22123. Taking the conventional tubular furnace reactor dimensions and flow rates, the mass flux comes out at 1.8 kg h\u22121, which gives a productivity of 0.11 t (m3 h)\u22121, just abovethe industrial threshold for fuels and chemicals. These may be considered upper limits for laboratory-scale\nreactors. Indeed, small pilot plant reactors for VGCFs with a throughput of 500 g h\u22121 have productivities of 10\u22123 t (m3 h)\u22121, although presumably higher at full scale up.\nFor some FCCVD reactions, an opportunity to increase productivity is by increasing the fraction of catalyst particles that produce nanowires ( f ). As noted before, current FCCVD growth of CNTs (and BNNT) operates under values of f \u223c 0.001 due to low selectivity. For nanowire growth by FCCVD, virtually all catalyst particles that remain as an aerosol produce nanowires and f \u2248 1. However, their productivity is at present comparable because of the \u2248103 times higher aspect ratio of CNTs.\nHigher productivity could be achieved with a shorter residence time. Industrial flame pyrolysis processes, for example, require 104 shorter residence times. However, it is possible that residence times of 1\u201310 s are close to the limits imposed by the rate of crystal growth. Note, for instance, that although residence times for spherical nanoparticles are 104 shorter than for nanotubes/nanowires, their aspect ratio is smaller by a similar amount. This may indicate that residence times in both processes are limited by solidification rates.\nUnder conditions when there is no excess of catalyst, for instance, in growth of NWs, smaller catalyst particles may lead to higher productivity on account of their higher surface-tovolume ratio. There are several aerosol methods for control of particle size; however, preserving the catalyst aerosol size distribution through the reactor is challenging considering the high target particle concentrations and the expected particle coalescence upon coagulation given the high operating temperature in FCCVD. The catalyst aerosol produced will evolve and converge into a single line, as depicted in Fig. 13,\nwith residence times used in FCCVD of 1\u201310 s corresponding to a maximum catalyst concentration of \u2248108\u2013109 cm\u22123. A review of the literature shows that the catalyst concentration used in FCCVD growth is 106 cm\u22123 for GaAs,13 107 cm\u22123 for SiNW16 and 106\u2013109 cm\u22123 for CNT, 66,69 suggesting that much higher catalyst concentrations than those currently used are plausible.\nOften for FCCVD synthesis, productivity is limited by precursor conversion. Present FCCVD growth processes are operated under conditions where the precursor concentrations are extremely low. As identified for CNTs, besides increases in conversion and collection, reaching significant throughput will require large increases in precursor and catalyst concentration in the reaction zone.20 This is evident by considering both the process efficiency and the process yield. The former is the fraction of the precursor transformed into the desired solid, and the latter is the fraction of solid products over all species in the reaction zone. Their ratio is the molar fraction of precursors. Fig. 14 shows experimental data for process yield and precursor efficiency for SiNWs and CNTs. Interestingly, the data fall on a straight line, which may be partly due to experiments on SiNW growth being conducted using parameters taken from CNT growth as reference. Overall, the data show that less than 10% of the precursor is transformed into collected solid and that less than 1% of the species introduced form nanowires/nanotubes. Recycling of carrier gases, for example, will increase process yield and move the data upwards. Increasing conversion or collection of nanowires improves efficiency along the diagonal.\nIn view of this analysis, the challenge to increase productivity for 1D nanoparticle growth by FCCVD may be summarised as achieving >10% precursor conversion with near 100% selectivity at catalyst concentrations above 108 cm\u22123."

            "text": "Boies et al. have recently performed a seminal kinetic analysis of aerogel formation based on determination of collision rates of 1D nanoparticles.79 They used simulation to determine the first collision kernel for rigid 1D nanoparticles, accounting for both particle rotation80 and translation, for different 1D morphologies. Reduced order relations were provided to enable direct calculation of collision kernels for 1D nanoparticles from geometric parameters without the need for simulations.\nTheir analysis shows that 1D nanoparticles commonly produced by FCCVD fall in an intermediate regime, where the timescales for rotation (?\u0302?r) and translation (?\u0302?x) are comparable. As shown in Fig. 15A, ?\u0302?r/?\u0302?x \u223c 0.3 for the common diameters and lengths of nanotubes and nanowires. Fig. 15B shows the dimensional collision kernel for rigid 1D nanoparticles of different length. It shows that collisions are enhanced for nanoparticles of dissimilar length. In addition, the resulting kernel gives a 10-fold enhancement in collisions compared to spheres (dashed lines). The authors also analysed the formation of bundles: aligned aggregates of 1D nanoparticles that enhance particle interaction and are commonly found in CNTs. With the knowledge of the collision kernel, the authors calculated the time for bundling (Fig. 15C) for the conditions found in FCCVD reactors with a concentration of 108 cm\u22123 and accounting for a range of morphological parameters. The mean bundling time obtained of 3 seconds agrees with the residence times found in such reactors (Fig. 15D).\nIn a follow-up study the group simulated the bundling process using a multi-scale method.81 In the simulations, upon collision and contact, CNTs \u201czip\u201d by rapidly aligning parallel to each other, forming a bundle (Fig. 16A and B). This bundle structure is common in CNTs, and occasionally found in agglomerates of SiNWs (Fig. 16C). The simulations show that bundling times increase as a function of collision angle following a power law as a function of CNT length, and that bundling dynamics are dominated by the length of the shorter of the two interacting CNTs.81 It is proposed that the aerogel forms when the bundling time is of the same order of magnitude as the bundle collision time and in the order of 10\u22121 to 103 ns.81 These results were developed for CNT\u2013CNT collisions but are expected to be applicable to boron nitride nanotubes and NWs.\nTo compare different FCCVD processes, we previously proposed to analyse the aggregation of 1D nanoparticles in the gas phase through percolation theory, based on the concept of excluded volume.16 This description relates volumetric concentration (v) and aspect ratio (s) of the nanoparticles to the probability of forming a continuous network in the volume of interest. For ideal (penetrable) rigid rods, the percolation threshold is vp \u2248 0.5 s\u22121. The product \ud835\udc63 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 then becomes a very rough parameter to assess the likelihood for 1D nanoparticles to form an aerogel in the gas phase, thus marking the boundary between an aerosol and an aerogel. A comparison of this metric for different reports is shown in Fig. 17, including reference values of \ud835\udc63 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60. The graph evidences the wide range of conditions under which FCCVD is operated and their correspondence to the format of the macroscopic material targeted. Low values of \ud835\udc63 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 are conducive to individualised particles whose aggregation can be controlled downstream to form thin layers for optoelectronics. Midrange values enable formation of freestanding sheets of nanoparticles randomly oriented in the plane. At the highest end are conditions leading to the formation of a macroscopic aerogel, for example, capable of withstanding continuous drawing from the gas phase as a fibre spinning process."

            "text": "electrodes, and structural materials\n5.1 General structure\u2013property relations in nanostructured network materials\nIn macroscopic ensembles, a longer length of the constituent nanoparticle generally increases bulk properties. For transport properties, reducing the number of ends can reduce the contribution from inter-particle resistance. Longer nanoparticles sustain higher axial stress through a longer length for stress build-up. In fibres of highly aligned CNTs, for example, both longitudinal electrical conductivity and tensile strength have been shown to scale linearly with constituent aspect ratio.83\nFig. 18 shows a comparison of literature data on bulk properties of macroscopic ensembles of different CNTs and their corresponding volume fraction. The data show that dispersion-based processing methods, which use CNTs produced by SCVD, are generally constrained to volume fractions below 10 wt%, which limits their bulk properties relative to those of the constituent. Fig. 18 also includes a cluster of data points with high properties, produced from liquid crystal solutions\nof \u22481 nm-diameter CNTs in strong acids. However, this route is ineffective for larger-diameter nanotubes or nanowires.\nFor reference, the persistence length of a typical inorganic nanowire, a thin CNT and a rigid-rod polymer are >10 000 \u03bcm,\n\u2248100 \u03bcm84 and \u224850 nm, respectively.\nAssembling high aspect ratio nanoparticles from the gas phase can overcome the limitations of dispersion-based processing. Through gas-phase assembly even CNTs of extraordinarily high aspect ratios above \u2248105 can be assembled into materials with volume fractions of above 20%, leading to bulk properties comparable to the constituents, which compete with best-of-class traditional materials. The medium volume fractions are also relevant for electrodes for energy storage and conversion, as discussed below.\nImplicit in the data in Fig. 18 is the importance of alignment in ensembles of high aspect ratio nanoparticles, which largely dominates bulk properties. The low volume fraction systems are comprised of randomly oriented nanoparticles. In such arrangement, they can form freestanding foams, or nanocomposites where the nanoparticles are dispersed in a matrix, often polymeric. Higher volume fraction can be achieved in sheets where the nanoparticles have some degree of alignment through the thickness and random orientation in the plane, analogous to paper sheets or non-woven fabrics. In aligned fibres, 1D nanoparticles are oriented parallel to each other and to the fibre axis, which results in higher packing and volume fractions approaching 100%. Fig. 19 shows examples of different materials with the three types of orientation,\nall produced through gas-phase assembly. The SiNW sheet and aligned CNT fibre have \u224825% and \u224865% of the density of their constituent crystal, respectively. For reference, in those formats, they have values of \ud835\udc63 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 > 50, showing the significant densification from the aerogel state.\n5.2 Nanowire network materials with textile-like properties\nThe macroscopic ensembles of 1D nanoparticles assembled from the gas phase have inherently a network structure, consisting of weakly interacting, aggregated long nanoparticles resembling a nanotextile. Indeed, they have textile-like properties, such as flexibility in bending, resistance to cutting and the possibility for weaving, knitting,86 knotting,87 etc. Overall, this network structure implies that their mechanical behaviour is often radically different from that of their constituents in the monolithic state. The most evident example is their ability to sustain large deformations. Under tensile\ndeformation, for example, sheets of different NWs reach strain-to-break in excess of 2.5%, compared to the 0.1\u20131% for their monolithic analogues, such as boron fibres (BF), carbon fibres (CF) and bulk silicon (Fig. 20A). These sheets have a characteristic sailshaped stress\u2013strain curve resulting from combined elastoplastic deformation and progressive sliding of elements. This behaviour contrasts with the brittle, linear-elastic deformation of monolithic analogues and is instead similar to that of paper and other athermal fibrillary networks.88\nThe deformation mechanism in nanostructured networks can lead to much larger damage-tolerance than in monolithic analogues, as crack propagation is arrested and diverted laterally. Given the relatively large and elastoplastic nature of tensile deformation of these networks, their damage tolerance can be best characterised in terms of work of fracture, i.e., the energy required to break them, instead of fracture toughness. Aligned fibres of CNTs produced from the gas phase have work of fracture and strength, a combination of interest for impact, which is above traditional highperformance synthetic fibres (Fig. 20B). Gas phase-produced unidirectional fabrics of CNTs have work of fracture also above that of CF, a property that contributes to preserving their properties upon recycling from structural composites. Nanostructured networks of SiNWs have a work of fracture of 0.36 J g\u22121, compared with the 0.014 J g\u22121 of their monolithic analogues and orders of magnitude above that of particulate electrodes (0.003 J g\u22121),16 for example. The emerging evidence is that gas-phase processing into nanostructured networks imbues inorganic materials with a \u201ctoughness\u201d otherwise inaccessible in the particulate or monolithic format.\n5.3 Electrical conductors\nGas-phase assembly has been particularly successful in the manufacture of transparent conductors. The general process consists in the direct deposition of a thin network of CNTs onto a transparent substrate (Fig. 21). Industrial-scale transparent conductors based on (doped) SWCNTs with 90% transparency in the visible range have reached a sheet resistance of 35 Ohm sq\u22121,24 significantly below the 100 Ohm sq\u22121 resistance of the conventional ITO standard. The high conductivity of these networks stems from the long length of the constituent CNTs, control over their diameter and\naggregation into bundles,24 and the introduction of dopants.92 Here again, gas-phase synthesis stands out over wetprocessing by enabling processing of long nanoparticles with controlled aggregation as engineered networks. The figure of merit for transparent conductors is the ratio of optical \u03c3op to bulk DC conductivity \u03c3dc,B, which is related to\ntransmittance (T ) and sheet resistance (Rs) by by \ud835\udc47 = (1 + \ud835\udc4d0\n2\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc35 ) \u22122 , where Z0 is the impedance of free space. As\nshown in Fig. 21E, the figure of merit for CNTs is significantly higher for gas-phase assembly than for wet processing.\n5.4 Nanostructured electrodes\nThe use of gas phase assembly to produce electrodes is part of a broader trend to explore architectures beyond granular electrodes with a layered structure supported on a metallic foil (Fig. 22). Replacing granular materials (active and conducting additives) with a nanostructured network of high aspect ratio materials can lead to composite architectures that improve the performance of electrodes, open new electrode processing routes, and enable a myriad of complexshaped and deformable devices.96,97\nAn instructive example is battery electrodes where particulate conductors are replaced by high aspect ratio CNTs. At mass fractions above \u22481 wt%, SWNTs can form a continuous (segregated) network that contains the active material and forms a composite structure even without polymer binders.98 Out-of-plane electrical conductivity and tensile strength are two important electrode properties dominated by the CNT network, which led to a comparison of different processing methods (Fig. 23).\nPioneering work on composite electrodes produced from slurries of SWNTs and granular active materials shows that their out-of-plane conductivity follows a percolation model, with a limiting value of \u22480.1 S m\u22121,99 which is close to the proposed threshold (1 S m\u22121) to prevent electron transport limitations in batteries (Fig. 23A). Using different active materials, these composites showed strength above 4 MPa, enabling manufacture of thick electrodes that overcome the limiting critical crack thickness of particulate coatings of around 100 microns.98\nIn an example of a gas phase method, CNTs are directly grown on spherical active particles flowing through a CVD reactor. The \u201chairy\u201d particles are then processed as the conventional granular active material to form electrodes deposited on a current collector. Electrodes produced from hairy particles reach 10\u201350 wt% of CNTs and higher conductivity and superior electrochemical performance compared to control samples.100\nCNT nanotextiles produced by FCCVD have been widely used to produce a variety of such composite electrodes, whereby the active material is incorporated into the pre-made CNT nanotextile scaffold.101 MoS2/CNT nanotextiles have shown out-of-plane electrical conductivity above the threshold for electronic rate-limitations in charge/discharge of LIBs. They also have specific tensile strength higher than that of steel and over an order of magnitude higher than that of wetprocessed analogues (Fig. 23B). The electrical and mechanical properties of these composite electrodes stem from the long length of CNTs, but also from a higher mass fraction. A comparison of the composites from wet- and gas-phase processing shows that they are generally in different mass fraction ranges. The limited data available also suggest that bulk properties in these systems scale differently with mass fraction (Fig. 23B). There are many other examples of improved performance in electrodes with gas phase-assembled processed CNT networks, including stabilisation of battery active materials,102\u2013104 and increased conversion efficiency in various photo(electro)catalytic electrodes.105\u2013109 These processes are, however, more strongly dependent on the active material and multiple interfaces in the system and thus harder to compare against wet-processed analogues.\nGiven their combined strength and longitudinal conductivity at high mass fractions, the nanocarbon networks in composite electrodes can act as a built-in current collector, eliminating metallic foil current collectors and enabling electrodes with complex shapes. Examples of non-conventional electrode formats include fibre-shaped,96 sheet-like,113 and transparent,114 for multiple energy storage,115 conversion116 and energy harvesting processes.117 Some examples are included in Fig. 24. The underlying feature is the relatively high tensile strength and strain-to-break of the nanocarbon network backbone, combined with a small device thickness. In conjunction with a suitable soft matrix, patterning of CNT nanotextile current collectors has been used to demonstrate multiple types of stretchable opto(electronic) devices.118 With a stiff matrix and special electrolytes, they have formed structural energy-storing composites.119 These examples illustrate the plethora of architectures and devices enabled by replacement of metallic foil current collectors with FCCVDproduced CNT nanotextiles.\nAn emerging area of interest is the synthesis of high aspect ratio active materials directly in the gas phase. After all, many of today\u2019s particulate battery materials are produced industrially through thermal synthesis routes in flow-through reactors, including established active materials and conductors, and a range of emerging nanoparticles for anodes and cathodes. 126,127 These particles are then dispersed in suitable solvents, mixed with a binder to form a slurry and coated on a current collector to form electrodes. Recently, we demonstrated that high aspect ratio SiNWs produced by FCCVD can be directly assembled as electrodes from the gas-phase, eliminating all need for solvents and mixing steps.36 In its nanotextile form, the active material is freestanding, flexible and has sufficient mechanical robustness for downstream processing into battery cells, altogether avoiding slurry processing. The implications are beyond Si anodes and LIBs. FCCVD growth of active materials opens a completely new route for the manufacture of electrodes through gas-tonanotextile processing (Fig. 25).\nExtending the application of FCCVD beyond CNT conductors and SiNW anodes is an appealing prospect. The typical volume fraction of porous materials in electrodes for energy storage (e.g., active material129), photocatalysis (e.g., TiO2 photoelectrode130) and electrocatalysis (catalyst supports and gas diffusion layers131) is 25\u201380%. These volume fractions are high to attain through wet processing, but are readily accessible through gas phase assembly. From a more fundamental point of view, the electrodes comprised exclusively of an active material as a nanostructured network are interesting model systems that can help understand the interfacial role of binders and conductive additives, the contributions of inter- and intra-particle charge transport, and the contribution of different rate-limiting electrochemical processes.\nFrom the point of view of applications, as 1D nanoparticles become increasingly available as macroscopic nanotextiles, there will be more focus on further processing them into components. The associated challenges to interface nanotextiles\nwith polymers to make composites132,133 or with metals134\u2013136 for charge transfer process, for example, have been largely addressed for CNT nanotextiles and led to methods transferable to nanotextiles of other chemical compositions."

However, as multiple transformation steps are integrated in a single manufacturing process, it becomes necessary to introduce on-line measurement methods to characterise individual processing steps. This will require different experimental methods to monitor the composition and morphology during 1D nanoparticle growth, aggregation and densification. Similarly, the process as a whole would benefit from development of models that bridge different length scales of materials and time scales of processes involved in the three main stages of the manufacturing route.\nConcerning primarily the growth stage, there is a need for fundamental studies that describe the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of 1D nanoparticle growth in the FCCVD regime and which can provide a complete description of its inherently fast growth rate. A better understanding on the fundamental factors that govern selectivity will accelerate the synthesis and assembly of other 1D nanoparticles, a pressing need considering that there are roughly 10 times more 1D nanoparticles producible by FCCVD (>70) than the total ever synthesised by this method (5) over the last 40 years. Improvements are also necessary to understand the reaction mechanism and underlying kinetics in order to limit competing reaction paths that deplete the reagents and contaminate the 1D nanoparticle product, particularly the formation of soot, in order to preserve selectivity while increasing reaction throughput.\nIn addition to increasing the palette of ultra-long 1D nanoparticles produced by FCCVD, future efforts should be directed at controlling their crystal structure and purity. This is a significant challenge given the extremely short reaction times involved, the mobility and evolution of the catalyst particles in the gas-phase, and the inherent breadth of catalyst size distribution. A promising avenue is to perform in situ spectroscopic measurements during growth of 1D nanoparticles, particularly under resonance conditions that therefore allow detection at low concentrations.\nThe aggregation of high aspect ratio nanoparticles in the gas phase is central to this manufacturing route, yet it is the least understood stage. Particularly because of the lack of analogous processes in the scientific realm and the inherent technical challenges in the detection of aerosols and aerogels in the FCCVD environment. These are invitations to explore a fertile ground for development of further instrumentation and modelling. An improved understanding of aerogel formation is likely to benefit from studying different 1D nanoparticles that span a range of morphologies and aggregation dynamics. It will require the implementation and development of multiple techniques to characterise particles and ensembles on different length-scales, both in situ and offline. This involves not only integrating characterisation tools in the 1D nanoparticle reactors, but also developing portable model reactors to high intensity synchrotron facilities.\nAdvances are also sought in describing three-dimensional bulk mechanical and transport properties of nanotextiles, including those with a moderate degree of alignment. Building on existing micro-mechanical models, a future goal should be to describe the large strain-to-break and intrinsic damage-tolerance of these network materials. These properties set them apart from their monolithic analogues and can have important implications for extended durability and re-use of structural materials and electrodes."

The aerosol may also comprise aggregates of a few 1D nanoparticles.\nPercolation: formation of a continuous network of aggregated 1D nanoparticles in a macroscopic volume.\n1D nanoparticle aerogel: percolated network of 1D nanoparticles, with ultra-low mass fraction or bulk density (\u03c1bulk/ \u03c11D NP < 0.01), mechanically stable against the stresses generated from the flow and collection of materials in FCCVD.\nNanotextile: a class of materials consisting of a network of high aspect ratio nanoparticles, characterised by a significant porosity (>\u224810%), and interaction between nanoparticles through secondary bonds.\nSheet: example of freestanding nanotextiles with random orientation in the plane, sometimes also referred to as mats. For CNTs, this was traditionally referred to as bucky paper. (In case where the 1D nanoparticles have some degree of alignment in the plane, for example when made of wound CNT fibre aerogels, and because of the large size of components routinely produced in industry, e.g., 1 m wide and >10 m long, these are more appropriately referred to as non-woven fabrics.) Soot: nanoscale material formed through the direct pyrolysis of precursors without intervention of the catalyst during growth, typically in the form of quasi-spherical nanoparticles or clusters that may attach to nanowires."
