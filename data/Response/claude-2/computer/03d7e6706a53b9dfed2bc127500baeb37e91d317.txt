 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate using the EPFA for other SAR imaging modes like stripmap and ScanSAR to handle large scenes. The current paper focuses on spotlight mode SAR.

2. Explore integrating the EPFA with other techniques like motion compensation to further improve image focusing over large areas. The EPFA alone may still have some residual errors. 

3. Analyze the EPFA's performance for highly nonlinear flight paths like circular trajectories. The current analysis is based on linear trajectories.

4. Develop more advanced space-variant phase error compensation methods to increase computational efficiency. The sub-block approach could be further optimized.  

5. Extend the EPFA for bistatic SAR configurations and compare performance to existing bistatic PFA techniques. The current EPFA is derived for monostatic mode.
