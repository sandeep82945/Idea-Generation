            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe fermionic sign problem is one of the most fundamental limitations of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.1,2 In projector QMC methods, where the aim is to project out a specific state\u2014usually the ground state\u2014through a stochastic evolution of signed walkers, the problem manifests itself through the exponential growth of an undesired distribution of walkers of \u201cbosonized\u201d or \u201cstoquastized\u201d character, leaving the desired fermionic distribution lost in the noise of the simulation. This instability leads to diverging variances in expectation values of measured observables.\nThere are three known strategies to counter this problem. The first is to place constraints on the evolving distribution of walkers to prevent the growth of the undesired distribution. The fixed-node approximation of Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC),3\u20135 the constrained path and phaseless approximations of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC),6\u201312 and the initiator approximation13 of the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method14 all fall into this category. The difficulty is that\nthese approximations generally lead to biased results (unless an exact form of the constraint, e.g., via a symmetry, can be applied), and furthermore, these approximations are either uncontrolled or can only be controlled (reduced) through time-consuming protocols, such as multi-determinant trial wavefunctions in the fixed-node and phaseless approximations, or by increasing the walker number in the initiator approximation. These methods are ultimately scaling exponentially in the computational resources needed to achieve a desired accuracy. The second strategy is to perform unconstrained projections, attempting to measure a transient fermionic signal before the undesired solution becomes dominant. Such simulations are practical only for very small systems and otherwise cost exponential time. The third strategy, which is advocated in the FCIQMC method (without the initiator approximation), is to introduce walker annihilation processes into the algorithm, which destabilize the undesired solution15 and allow the desired fermionic solution to emerge without bias. The difficulty here is that a minimum number of walkers is required to achieve this, and this minimum number is generally found to scale with the size of the Hilbert space. This makes the\nJ. Chem.

When exact FCIQMC is applicable, the quality of the sampled wavefunction is comparable to that obtained by exact diagonalization, but with a lower memory requirement.\nWhen FCIQMC is used with a small number of walkers, the unphysical stoquastic solution becomes dominant and the fermionic solution is lost in noise. The stability of the fermionic solution can be quantified by the energy gap between the exact fermionic groundstate and that of the undesired solution.15 However, as we will show in this paper, the stoquastized gap alone does not fully describe the computational difficulty to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we will show that two Hamiltonians with exactly the same gap can, nevertheless, require very different minimal numbers of walkers to converge. We show that guiding wavefunctions can be used to further mitigate the sign problem by reducing the minimum of walkers required to fully resolve the sign problem, thereby arriving at an exact scheme with lower computational cost. (Previously, it has been found that by employing a trial wavefunction, a \u201cfixednode Hamiltonian\u201d can be defined by which this stoquastized gap can be reduced at the expense of introducing an approximation to the Hamiltonian.)16\u201319\nIf a Hamiltonian in a particular basis has no sign problem, then its stoquastized gap is identically zero; conversely, if this gap is found to be zero, then that Hamiltonian has no sign problem. A weak sign problem is one in which the gap is non-zero, but small. There are some systems, such as periodic 1D Hubbard models, in which the gap remains small even as the system size grows (i.e., it is not size-extensive). In these cases, the FCIQMC algorithm can be applied to very large systems, essentially accessing the thermodynamic limit. In other systems, the gap grows with system size, ultimately limiting the system sizes, which can be treated. Even here, one can still obtain exact-diagonalization quality results for systems far exceeding conventional exact diagonalization.\nA characteristic of weak sign-problem fermionic systems is that their wavefunctions tend to be highly spread out throughout the Hilbert space, somewhat similar to the related stoquastized systems (in which all imaginary-time Feynman path contributions are strictly positive, leading to diffuse, non-compact wavefunctions). For such systems, methods based on truncations of the Hilbert space will lead to large errors. Therefore, techniques such as the initiator approximation of FCIQMC, or similar selected CI methods of quantum chemistry, struggle to describe such systems. Paradoxically, therefore, weak sign-problem systems are highly challenging systems, and it is necessary to devise alternative techniques\u2014not based on truncations\u2014to address them. The FCIQMC method without the initiator approximation is one such method, but even there, it needs to be adapted to efficiently yet faithfully sample the exact fermionic ground-state. Devising such a method is the main purpose of the present study.\nIt is an interesting fact that not every fermionic quantum system has a sign problem in FCIQMC, even in non-trivial cases. In some systems, it turns out that it is possible to subdivide the Hilbert space of the problem in such a way that, during the propagation step of the FCIQMC algorithm, all walkers that arrive at a given point in the Hilbert space always have the same sign, even though there are both types of walkers distributed throughout the space. Such a case occurs in one-dimensional Hubbard models with open boundary\nconditions, irrespective of the filling, as long as one uses a real-space basis.20\nThe Hamiltonian for a Hubbard chain of length \u2113 is given by\nH\u0302Hubb = \u2212t \u2113\n\u2211 i=1 \u2211 \u03c3=\u2191,\u2193 (c\u0302\u2020i,\u03c3 c\u0302i+1,\u03c3 + c\u0302 \u2020 i+1,\u03c3 c\u0302i,\u03c3) +U\u2211 i n\u0302i,\u2191n\u0302i,\u2193. (1)\nc\u0302\u2020i,\u03c3 and c\u0302i,\u03c3 are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators at lattice site i with electron spin \u03c3, respectively. n\u0302i,\u03c3 = c\u0302\u2020i,\u03c3 c\u0302i,\u03c3 are the corresponding number operators. t is the hopping amplitude, and U is the on-site interaction. The Hubbard model is a seemingly simple lattice model but yet already shows the rich physical properties of more realistic system setups21\u201323 and has been studied with a variety of different computational methods.24\nFor open boundary conditions\u2014sites \u2113 and 1 are not regarded as neighbors\u2014the system is sign-problem-free for all fillings. For periodic (anti-periodic) boundary conditions\u2014sites \u2113 and 1 are connected with hopping amplitude \u2212t (t)\u2014there is no sign problem for an odd (even) number of up-electrons and an odd (even) number of down-electrons.\nIn these systems, calculations of systems with up to 150 sites in the case of the one-dimensional Hubbard chains have been shown to be calculable with FCIQMC.20 In such large spaces, another systematic bias called population control bias, which is independent of the sign problem, becomes notable. It has been shown that the application of importance sampling in combination with an a posteriori reweighing procedure can practically remove the bias.\nWhen moving away from the filling rules in the periodic 1D Hubbard model mentioned previously or moving to 2D Hubbard systems, there is an inevitable sign problem. However, we will show that these systems still show only a weak sign problem when using a real-space basis, meaning that the number of FCIQMC walkers to fully resolve the sign problem is very small compared to the total Hilbert space size.\nTo illustrate that in a real-space basis the sign problem of the Hubbard model is comparatively weak, we calculated \u0394Estoq of two half-filled Hubbard 4 \u00d7 4 systems. For U/t = 8, in a real-space basis, we obtain \u0394Estoq = 3.792. In a reciprocal-space basis, we get 97.201, which means an increase of almost two orders of magnitude. These numbers are also shown in Fig. 2. Even for U/t = 4\u2014where the k-space representation typically is much more suitable25\u2014\u0394Estoq in the real-space basis is still much lower than in the reciprocal-space basis (8.401 compared to 40.720).\nThe sign problem is especially weak if the lattice geometry still resembles the geometry of a sign-problem-free 1D system, such as a two-legged ladder. Still, the minimum number of walkers may be too high to be affordable.\nIn this paper, we analyze the FCIQMC algorithm applied to weak sign-problem fermionic systems, epitomized by Hubbard models in a real-space basis in periodic 1D and ladder geometry (see Fig. 1). In such problems, the initiator approximation is severe, while the exact algorithm can be applied affordably using importance sampling. We observe a significant reduction of the minimum number of walkers in weak-sign-problem systems. We use the method to report unbiased results for the interaction regime of U/t = 8 at and close to half-filling.\nJ. Chem.

            "text": "FCIQMC is an imaginary-time projection method to (in its simplest formulation) sample the ground state wavefunction \u2223\u03a80\u27e9 of a Hamiltonian H\u0302 by solving the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation.14 The master equation is given by\n\u2212 d\nd\u03c4 \u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9 = [H\u0302 \u2212 S]\u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9, (2)\nwith S being a scalar parameter, the shift. Starting from an initial wavefunction \u2223\u03a8(0)\u27e9 that has non-zero overlap with the true ground state, \u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9 will converge to the ground state in the large-\u03c4 limit.\nFCIQMC applies this master equation in a finite basis of Slater determinants (although recently FCIQMC has been extended to a spin-adapted version working in a basis of configuration state functions26,27). The evolving wavefunction coefficients are represented by a number of walkers N i that reside on a specific Slater determinant \u2223Di\u27e9. H\u0302 is, then, stochastically applied to the instantaneous walker distribution in discretized time steps \u0394\u03c4 as\n\u2212 \u0394Ni(\u03c4)\n\u0394\u03c4 = [Hii \u2212 S]Ni(\u03c4) +\u2211 i\u2260j HjiNj(\u03c4). (3)\nThe stochastic application of H\u0302 consists of three steps: spawning, death/cloning, and annihilation. In the spawning step, each walker attempts to spawn from the determinant \u2223Di\u27e9 it is sitting on to a determinant \u2223Dj\u27e9 that it is connected to by a non-zero Hamiltonian matrix element Hji. The spawning attempt succeeds with a probability pspawn = \u0394\u03c4\u2223Hji\u2223/pgenji , where p gen ji is the probability that \u2223Dj\u27e9 is selected as a target determinant starting from \u2223Di\u27e9. In the death/cloning step, the walker population N i of every occupied determinant is multiplied by \u0394\u03c4(Hii \u2212 S). If after this step the walker population is lower than a certain minimum occupation threshold (mostly chosen to be 1), the population is stochastically rounded either up to the occupation threshold or down to 0. If it is rounded to 0, the determinant is removed from memory until a new spawn happens onto this particular determinant. This makes the instantaneous representation of the FCIQMC wavefunction very memoryefficient. The annihilation step is an important step for reducing the sign problem. As the last step of an iteration, all spawns to the same target determinant are communicated to the same processor. There, positive and negative spawns cancel each other. This is easily possible since FCIQMC works in a discrete basis of Slater determinants unlike, e.g., diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) where such immediate cancellations are not straightforwardly possible and, therefore, of limited effectiveness.5\nThe ground-state energy can be measured by averaging either the projected energy or the shift. The projected energy is defined as\nEproj(\u03c4) = \u27e8D0\u2223H\u0302\u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9 \u27e8D0\u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9 , (4)\nwhere \u2223D0\u27e9 is the reference determinant (which in real-space Hubbard systems close to half-filling is always a N\u00e9el determinant). The shift is not only used to control the population but can also be used as an energy estimator. It is updated according to\nS(\u03c4) = S(\u03c4 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4) \u2212 \u03b3\nA\u0394\u03c4 ln( N(\u03c4) N(\u03c4 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4) ) \u2212 \u03b32 4A\u0394\u03c4 ln( N(\u03c4) Nw ) (5)\nevery A iterations. The third term is an extension to the usual shift update formula and was presented in Ref. 28. The first logarithmic term just leads to a constant population. The second term has the desired population Nw in the denominator so that the average total population will converge to that value precisely. The prefactor \u03b32/4 ensures critical damping in a simplified model and still proves useful in actual simulations.\nTypically, in ab initio systems, FCIQMC is applied in conjunction with the initiator approximation13 and has been successfully applied in various ab initio systems,29\u201332 as well as the Hubbard model in a reciprocal-space basis for U/t \u2264 4.25,33 In the initiator method, determinants are dynamically marked as initiators during the simulation when their walker population exceeds the preset initiator threshold tinit. Only initiators are allowed to spawn to every other determinant since they are deemed to be sign-coherent because of their well-established population of a single sign. Noninitiators can only passively acquire population and spawn to occupied determinants only, with the rare exception that two simultaneous non-initiator spawns on an empty determinant are also allowed. This leads to an effective, dynamically updated truncation of the Hamiltonian. This introduces a bias into the sampled wavefunction and energy estimators. The initiator approximation is not suitable for treating the real-space Hubbard model for U/t \u2272 16 where the wavefunction is strongly spread-out across the Hilbert space. Even for tinit close or equal to the occupation threshold, the initiator truncation becomes so severe that the energy estimates are very slowly converging with respect to Nw, even when using improved formulation of the initiator method, such as the adaptive-shift method.34,35 Therefore, in the following, we will discuss calculations and algorithmic improvement within non-initiator FCIQMC only."

On the same note, the overlap with any reasonable trial wavefunction vanishes because the fermionic solution is exponentially suppressed. This also makes the determination of the ground-state energy using projected energy estimators impossible.\n\u0394Estoq is an important concept to quantify the sign problem. It can be regarded as a global quantity that quantifies how far the stoquastized and fermionic differ. However, there is no monotonic relation between the stoquastized gap and the actual computational effort (i.e., the minimum number of walkers required) to solve a system with FCIQMC. In a practical simulation, the actual sampling of the wavefunction is also important. This fact will be demonstrated and exploited later in this paper.\nTo render the correct fermionic solution of a given signproblematic Hamiltonian with FCIQMC, the Hilbert space has to be occupied with a minimum number of walkers simultaneously. This is such that the necessary annihilations can actually take place and the fermionic solution can emerge. Still, the minimum number of walkers Nmin to get the numerically exact ground-state solution and overcome the sign problem is typically smaller than the number of determinants \u2223\u210b \u2223 in the Hilbert space. The minimum number of walkers is also called the annihilation plateau since in most cases, it can be identified by a plateau in the walker number in the walker growth phase, caused by walker annihilations. However, especially in the real-space Hubbard systems studied in this paper, the plateau can be hard to identify. Therefore, we use a different method to determine Nmin, which we call the fixed-N0 method. In this method, the population on the reference determinant is held fixed, rather than the total population. In order to achieve this, the shift is updated according to\nS(\u03c4) = \u2211jH0jNj(\u03c4)\nN0(\u03c4) . (7)\nN0(\u03c4) is the population of the reference determinant at imaginary time \u03c4 and j runs over all connected determinants, including j = 0.\nThe shift is now equivalent to Eproj, and there is only a single energy estimator. Plugging Eq. (7) into Eq. (3) leads to\n\u0394N0(\u03c4) = \u2212\u0394\u03c4[(H00 \u2212 \u2211jH0jNj(\u03c4)\nN0(\u03c4) )N0(\u03c4) + \u2211 j\u22600 H0jNj(\u03c4) \u23a4 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a5 \u23a6 = 0,\n(8)\nso the population on the reference determinant is held exactly constant at a specified value N0 and especially at a given sign. This ensures sign coherence automatically at the expense of a total walker population Nw that is not predefined. For N0 = 1, the averaged total population Nw would converge to Nmin exactly. Choosing N0, this low, typically, leads to large fluctuations of Nw, however, making it difficult to average. Therefore, in all calculations, in this paper, we will use N0 = 50, which will lead to Nw slightly higher than Nmin.37"

For the chains, the gap is 0 for all systems with odd n\u2191 and odd n\u2193. It is not size-extensive for all other fillings, and \u0394Estoq decreases with system size. The sign problem in the 2 \u00d7 \u2113 ladder case is size-extensive, i.e., \u0394Estoq increases when the length of the ladder system is increased. However, at U/t = 16, this increase is rather slow, whereas at U/t = 8, it is much faster. This implies that the large-U limit of the ladder systems remains weakly sign-problematic even for large systems. On the other hand, the low U limit becomes increasingly sign problematic in the real-space representation.\nless than 108 walkers when accounting for the population control bias.\nOn the same note, this leads to the counterintuitive situation that for sign-problematic 1D systems of intermediate size (e.g., around 50 sites), where Estoq0 is still smaller than E0 outside of statistical errors, is much harder or even impossible to solve. Even if the non-size-extensive gap is already very small at this system size, due to the very large Hilbert space size, a significant or even unreachable number of walkers would be needed to establish a sign-coherent solution.\nJ.

It always consists of a four-site plaquette. Therefore, the special circumstances that cause the non-extensivity of the sign problem in the 1D case no longer exist here. In addition to the elementary cycles, adding more four-site plaquettes even increases the number of sign-problematic cycles. This leads to an extensive sign problem, which means that the stoquastic gaps increase with system size. This is shown in Fig. 3(b). This severely limits the treatable system size. Depending on the exact shape of the lattice, however, the sign problem can\u2014even though it is sizeextensive\u2014still be weak and systems well beyond the capability of exact diagonalization can be treated numerically exactly when FCIQMC is enhanced by an importance sampling scheme using a simple guiding wavefunction. An example for a Hubbard system class with a very weak sign problem is the ladder systems, shown in Fig. 1, which are 2 \u00d7 \u2113 Hubbard lattices with a 2 \u00d7 2 primitive cell. Ladder systems have been studied mostly using the densitymatrix renormalization group (DMRG) as they still show a relatively low entanglement entropy, making it possible to calculate larger clusters.38\nWe end this section by noting that our finding that the realspace representation results in a weaker sign problem compared to the momentum space representation is in line with a similar conclusion arrived at by Blunt, in a study of fixed-node and partial-node FCIQMC,19 for ab initio systems. There, he found that fully localized basis sets tend to lead to weaker sign problems (as measured by the population plateau), compared to split-localized and canonical Hartree\u2013Fock or natural orbitals. Taken together with our results, we believe this finding may be quite general, namely, real-space or localized basis sets\u2014while leading to highly spread-out, non-compact, wavefunctions\u2014also lead to the weakest sign problems. Put another way, we hypothesize that orbital representations that lead to compact wavefunctions tend also to lead to severe sign problems, implying that the observed compactness may be due to large amounts of annihilation.\nWe support this by the following argument: Suppose that we perform a deterministic simulation using the FCIQMC master equation [Eq. (3)]. At equilibrium, the net contribution onto \u2223Di\u27e9 is \u0394N i(\u03c4) = 0. When all other N j equal their respective true Cj coefficient, N i is then given by\nNi = \u2212 \u2211i\u2260jHjiNj\nHii \u2212 S . (15)\nN i will be small if (i) Hii is large, (ii) all connected N j or their respective matrix elements Hji are small in magnitude, or (iii) there are a lot of canceling contributions from connected determinants \u2223Dj\u27e9 because of opposite signs. Case (iii) leads to a large contribution to the sign problem by \u2223Di\u27e9 even though it might be unimportant in the FCI expansion. This indicates that compact wavefunctions due to the orbital representation can on the same note cause a more severe sign problem.\nThis highlights the general challenge we face, namely, to successfully overcome the sign problem, we may need to abandon the notion of seeking orbital representations that lead to maximally compact wavefunctions."

However, finding and applying these manyparticle basis rotations that could potentially reduce the gap, in general, are equally hard or even harder than overcoming the sign problem itself.39,40 Single-particle basis rotations can reduce the sign problem, but this can be used only in very limited cases.41\nFor the FCIQMC method, however, we find empirically that \u0394Estoq is not the only defining factor on how difficult it is to overcome the sign problem. Since the number of walkers ultimately determines the necessary computational resources for an FCIQMC simulation, the minimum number of walkers Nmin to obtain the sign-coherent solution is the important algorithmic quantity. We also define the ratio s = Nmin/\u2223\u210b \u2223 as the FCIQMC-related strength of the sign problem. Examples of the relationship between s and Nmin with respect to \u0394Estoq are shown in Fig. 4.\nWe find that s is a monotonic function of \u0394Estoq when moving from half-filling to one hole for a given system size. Increasing the length of the ladder will, however, increase \u0394Estoq but decrease s. On the other hand, when looking purely at Nmin, we find that it behaves exponentially with respect to \u0394Estoq for a given filling. The one-hole systems, however, systematically have a higher Estoq even though a larger but half-filled system might have a larger Nmin.\nTherefore, we conclude that the exact shape of the wavefunction also influences how computationally expensive it is to overcome the FCIQMC sign problem. Thus, we investigate how guiding wavefunctions that leave \u0394Estoq unchanged influence the strength of the FCIQMC sign problem."

Hence, instead of modifying \u0394Estoq, we can also make the wavefunction more compact by applying a simple diagonal guiding wavefunction \u2223\u03a8g\u27e9. Here, we will use a Gutzwiller-like wavefunction ansatz.\nIt is common practice in various QMC methods to use a guiding wavefunction to improve convergence and reduce stochastic fluctuations.42\u201345 We define the Gutzwiller wavefunction as\n\u2223\u03a8Gutzwiller\u27e9 = [exp(\u2212gU\u2211 k n\u0302k\u2191n\u0302k\u2193)]\u2223\u03a8HF\u27e9, (16)\nwhere \u2223\u03a8HF\u27e9 is the Hartree\u2013Fock determinant.46 \u2223\u03a8HF\u27e9 spans all determinants in the real-space basis, making the evaluation of \u27e8Di\u2223\u03a8Gutzwiller\u27e9 require additional computational overhead.

The overlaps with another real-space determinant \u2223Dj\u27e9 are, therefore, simply given by\n\u27e8Dj\u2223\u03a8g\u27e9 = exp(\u2212gHjj). (18)\nJ. Chem.

The minimum number of walkers, both in absolute numbers Nmin and relative to the Hilbert space size s = Nmin/\u2223\u210b \u2223, as a function of the stoquastized gap for various Hubbard systems in the real-space representation at half-filling (hf) and with one hole at U/t = 8. s is a measure of the FCIQMC-related strength of the sign problem. It can be seen that although Nmin increases with system size for a given type of system, s decreases for the same systems.\nIn FCIQMC, it is applied by scaling the spawning attempts from determinant \u2223Di\u27e9 to \u2223Dj\u27e9 by\nwij = \u27e8Dj\u2223\u03a8g\u27e9 \u27e8Di\u2223\u03a8g\u27e9 = exp[\u2212g(Hjj \u2212Hii)]. (19)\nIn contrast to using full \u2223\u03a8Gutzwiller\u27e9, these weights are cheap to calculate as the diagonal elements are required anyway for the death/cloning step.\nThe matrix elements of the matrix that is sampled when weighing the spawns like that are\nH\u0303ji = exp(gHii)Hji exp(\u2212gHjj). (20)\nThis is a similarity-transformed version of the original Hamiltonian; thus, the spectrum is conserved. Since the transformation is diagonal and the matrix elements H\u0303ij are merely a scaled version of Hji, it is true that\nexp(gHii)Hstoqji exp(\u2212gHjj) = [exp(gHii)Hji exp(\u2212gHjj)] stoq, (21)\nso ( \u02dc\u0302H) stoq\nis also a similarity-transformed version of H\u0302 stoq. Therefore, the spectrum of H\u0302 stoq is conserved, too. Thus, \u0394Estoq is left unchanged in the importance-sampled Hamiltonian.\nOn the other hand, the distribution of the weights in the ground-state wavefunction expansion that is sampled in an FCIQMC run is changed. The ground-state wavefunction of \u02dc\u0302H is given by\n\u2223\u03a8\u0303\u27e9 =\u2211 i C\u0303i\u2223Di\u27e9 =\u2211 i \u27e8Di\u2223\u03a8g\u27e9Ci\u2223Di\u27e9 =\u2211 i exp(\u2212gHii)Ci\u2223Di\u27e9, (22)\nwhere Ci are the real-space wavefunction coefficients of the untransformed wavefunction. For positive values of g, the transformation\nincreases the compactness of the wavefunction, i.e., the \u21131 norm of the wavefunction is concentrated on fewer determinants since determinants with larger diagonal elements (i.e., a larger number of double occupancies) are suppressed. The effect on a wavefunction is shown for a small 2 \u00d7 3 Hubbard ladder in Fig. 5 where exact diagonalization is trivial.\nB. Improved convergence with importance sampling When running an FCIQMC simulation with a walker number Nw smaller than Nmin, the shift S is a biased energy estimator. Since for Nw < Nmin the sign problem is unresolved, the sampled FCIQMC wavefunction \u2223\u03a8(\u03c4)\u27e9 is some superposition of the equally valid solutions \u2223\u03a8\u27e9 and \u2212\u2223\u03a8\u27e9. Therefore, the population on the reference determinant \u2223D0\u27e9 also does not have a constant sign. Thus, Eproj\nJ. Chem.

For a large enough population Nw \u2265 Nmin, the average shift S converges to the exact ground state energy E0. For Nw < Nmin, the Hilbert space is not occupied by enough walkers simultaneously such that enough annihilations can take place because opposite sign walkers do not meet in the same iteration on the respective determinant. A sign-incoherent wavefunction is sampled in this case. Because of only partially occurring annihilations, the Hilbert space is overpopulated with respect to the fermionic ground-state wavefunction \u2223\u03a80\u27e9 but underpopulated with respect to the stoquastized version \u2223\u03a8stoq0 \u27e9 as some but not all necessary annihilations take place on average. Therefore, the average shift, which is sensitive to the number of annihilated walkers as it is the population control parameter, is in between the two respective ground-state energies in these cases, Estoq0 < S < E0.\nApplying a guiding wavefunction such as \u2223\u03a8g\u27e9 that compactifies the ground-state solution and resembles the true solution \u2223\u03a80\u27e9 can greatly improve the convergence of S with respect to Nw and, thus, lower Nmin. It increases the number of annihilations and in doing so enables the algorithm to resolve the sign problem for a lower number of walkers. Figure 6 shows the convergence curve for a 2 \u00d7 8 ladder system at half-filling and with one hole for different g. It also\ndisplays the mean number of annihilations for the half-filled system as a function of Nw. Also shown is Nmin as determined using the fixed-N0 scheme with N0 = 50. As expected, it is situated at a walker number slightly above where convergence is reached."

The Hubbard Hamiltonian only allows for hoppings of the same spins to nearest-neighboring sites, so without loss of generality, an excitation of an \u2191-electron from site j to a site j \u00b1 1 is given by\nc\u0302\u2020j\u00b11,\u2191c\u0302j,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b11 ,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 j,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b1n\u2191,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b21 ,\u2193, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b2n\u2193 ,\u2193\u2223\u27e9\n= c\u0302\u2020\u03b11 ,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 j\u00b11,\u2191 c\u0302j,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 j,\u2191\n\u00b2 =1\n, . . . , c\u0302\u2020\u03b1n\u2191 ,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b21 ,\u2193, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b2n\u2193 ,\u2193\u2223\u27e9 (A2)\n(where j \u00b1 1 is not occupied with an \u2191-electron already). Since both c\u0302\u2020j\u00b11 and c\u0302j,\u2191 were commuted with the same number of c\u0302 \u2020 \u2191 operators, trivially, there is no sign change. For an excitation of a \u2193-electron, the same applies. This proves that all 1D Hubbard systems with open boundary conditions are sign-problem-free.

            "text": "IN 1D SYSTEMS: HEURISTIC EXPLANATION\nWithout loss of generality, let us look at two determinants \u2223Di\u27e9 and \u2223Dj\u27e9 in a system with an even number of \u2191-electrons and an odd number of \u2193-electrons. Between \u2223Di\u27e9 and \u2223Dj\u27e9, a single \u2191-electron is moved from site i to site j,\n\u2223Di\u27e9 = c\u0302\u2020\u03b11 ,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302i,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b1n\u2191 ,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b21 ,\u2193, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b2n\u2193 ,\u2193\u2223\u27e9, (B1)\n\u2223Dj\u27e9 = c\u0302\u2020\u03b11 ,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302j,\u2191, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b1n\u2191 ,\u2191c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b21 ,\u2193, . . . , c\u0302 \u2020 \u03b2n\u2193 ,\u2193\u2223\u27e9. (B2)\nThe two main contributing pathways consist of one moving \u2191-electrons not exploiting periodic boundary conditions and one moving them exploiting the boundary conditions. In the FCIQMC language, according to Eq. (3), a walker sitting on \u2223Di\u27e9 is creating\nPnon\u2212periodic = (\u0394\u03c4t)\u2223j\u2212i\u2223 \u22c5 (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4(ndocc + 1)U)n i,j \u2193\n\u22c5 (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4ndoccU)\u2223j\u2212i\u2223\u2212n i,j \u2193 (B3)\nwalkers on \u2223Dj\u27e9, where ndocc is the number of doubly occupied sites shared by \u2223Di\u27e9 and \u2223Dj\u27e9, \u2223j \u2212 i\u2223 is the number of sites between site i and site j, and ni,j\u2193 is the number of \u2193-electrons between i and j. In contrast, exploiting periodic boundary conditions leads to\nPperiodic = \u2212(\u0394\u03c4t)nsites\u2212\u2223j\u2212i\u2223 \u22c5 (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4(ndocc + 1)U)n\u2193\u2212n i,j \u2193\n\u22c5 (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c4ndoccU)(nsites\u2212\u2223j\u2212i\u2223)\u2212(n\u2193\u2212n i,j \u2193 ). (B4)\nOn the one hand, the contribution of these pathways to the fermionic solution is given by Pnon-periodic + Pperiodic. On the other hand, the contribution to the stoquastic solution is \u2223Pnon\u2212periodic + Pperiodic\u2223. Therefore, we can conclude that the stoquastized gap due to these contributions is largest when Pnon-periodic = \u2212Pperiodic because of maximal cancellation. One deviates from the equality if (i) nsites is large, (ii) n\u2193 \u2212 n i,j \u2193 is large, and (iii) U is large, implying a reduction of the sign-problematic contribution."
