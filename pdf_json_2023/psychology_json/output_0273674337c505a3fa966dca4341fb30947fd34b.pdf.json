Our research showed that adding bromine (Br) to Li3PS4 sulfide glass results in a similar crystal structure and high ionic conductivity comparable to that of another compound Li10GeP2S12. This structure differs from the PS4 anion framework of Li3PS4. In addition, the ionic conductivity decreases owing to a structural transition to the \u03b2\u2010phase. Herein, we present our findings on the local structure of Li3PS4 sulfide glass and its crystallized glass ceramic with the addition of Br. This analysis relies on the pair distribution function analysis obtained from high\u2010energy X\u2010ray diffraction. Moreover, using the bond valence sum method, we verified that incorporating Br promotes the formation of Li ionic conduction pathways. Our results indicate that precise control over the anion molecular structure by introducing halogens holds promise for achieving high Li\u2010ion conductivity.",

Our results indicate that precise control over the anion molecular structure by introducing halogens holds promise for achieving high Li\u2011ion conductivity.\nOne of the key strategies to achieve carbon neutrality is the development of all-solid-state batteries. Conventional liquid batteries utilize flammable organic solvents as electrolytes, raising safety concerns such as leakage and resulting ignition. In contrast, the electrolyte in an all-solid-state battery is solid, effectively addressing the safety issues associated with liquid-based batteries. Moreover, all-solid-state batteries can outperform liquid batteries in practical applications, especially in the automotive and stationary sectors. They offer advantages such as a high lithium-ion transport ratio and high energy output1,2, enabling high voltage operation and enhanced capacity. Additionally, all-solid-state batteries can utilize high-capacity sulfur-based electrode materials3, which are incompatible with liquid electrolytes owing to their high reactivity with solvents4. As a result, extensive research is underway to explore and advance the potential of all-solid-state batteries in achieving these desirable features5,6.\nOne of the crucial components in the advancement of all-solid-state batteries is the solid electrolyte. Among various solid electrolytes, the sulfide-based systems7\u201313 exhibited high ionic conductivity. The Li2S\u2013P2S5 system demonstrates different glassy and crystalline structures depending on the composition and heat treatment temperature. In the Li2S:P2S5 = 75:25 system, the glass exhibits a conductivity of ~ 10\u22124\u00a0S/cm, while the beta crystals and other structures in the high-temperature range have conductivity < 10\u22124\u00a0S/cm, similar to that of glass. In contrast, the Li2S:P2S5 = 70:30 system exhibits Li7P3S11 crystal with a remarkable ionic conductivity of 3.2 \u00d7 10 mS/cm14,15. However, this system contains P2S7 anions, so H2S generation is more likely to occur16. To address the H2S generation issue, researchers have developed solid electrolytes comparable to liquid electrolytes. An example of such a solid electrolyte is Li10GeP2S12, commonly known as LGPS, developed by Kanno, which exhibits a conductivity of 12\u00a0mS/cm17\u201319. Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 is another important solid electrolyte with a conductivity of 25 mS/cm20. These systems do not contain the P2S7 anions. However, these materials rely on the costly rare metal Ge and face challenges in terms of electrical stability. As a result, alternative materials using Sn or Si instead of Ge21,22 and designs incorporating O in place of S have also been explored23.\nHigh ionic conductivity and the absence of rare metals are crucial for the industrial implementation of sulfide-based solid electrolytes. Herein, we have successfully developed a solid electrolyte material with high ionic conductivity by incorporating halogen elements into Li3PS4 glass, which serves as the base material24\u201328. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the detailed structure of the developed material.\nOPEN\n1Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, 1060, Nishikawatsu-Cho, Matsue, Shimane 690-8504, Japan. 2Idemitsu Kosan Co.

            "text": "Figure\u00a01 depicts the heat flow behavior of glassy LiPS-Br annealed at 220\u00a0\u00b0C and the corresponding ionic conductivity at each annealing temperature. The XRD patterns shown in Fig.\u00a02 reveal that within the temperature range of 190\u00a0\u00b0C\u2013210\u00a0\u00b0C, a previously unidentified crystalline phase emerged as the primary source of ionic conductivity, surpassing 1 mS/cm. Conversely, when the temperature exceeded 220\u00a0\u00b0C, \u03b2-crystals became evident, considerably decreasing ionic conductivity. The newly observed unknown phase is presumed to possess a metastable structure, evident from its broad half-width and limited temperature range within a single phase.\nFigure\u00a03 illustrates the experimental X-ray pair distribution function for the glass and the crystal after annealing at 200\u00a0\u00b0C, with the Li3PS4 glass serving as a reference. A comparison of the glass structures reveals a P\u2013S correlation within the PS4 molecule at a distance of 2.0\u00a0\u00c5, an S\u2013S correlation within the same molecule at 3.4\u00a0\u00c5, and a peak at ~ 4.0\u00a0\u00c5 originating from an S\u2013S correlation between the molecules8. Adding Br does not significantly affect the glassy structure, as the peak positions and pair distribution functions (PDFs) above 5\u00a0\u00c5 remain almost identical before and after adding Br, despite variations in peak intensities caused by compositional differences. The area ratio of the P\u2013S correlation located at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 and the X-ray weight factor ratio was calculated to be 0.754 and 0.758, respectively. The difference in peak intensity can be attributed to compositional disparities, but there is no notable distinction in the P\u2013S correlation or the presence of PS4 molecules within each glass structure. Adding Br increases the intensity of the peak located at 4.0\u00a0\u00c5, indicating the presence of a correlation associated with Br. Comparing the Br added glass and crystal, no changes are observed in the P\u2013S correlation within the PS4 molecule appeared at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 or the S\u2013S correlation within the same molecule located at 3.4\u00a0\u00c5, confirming that no alterations have occurred within the PS4 molecule from glass to the crystal. However, the crystals exhibit an intensity increase in the peak observed at ~ 4.0\u00a0\u00c5, corresponding to the S\u2013S distance between PS4 molecules. Based on the observed correlation related to Br at this distance, it can be deduced that alternations occur in the correlation between PS4 molecules, between PS4 molecules and Br\u2212 anions, or among the Br\u2212 anions them can be inferred, given the correlation related to Br at this distance. Furthermore, a peak indicative of the ordering of the molecular arrangement is observed in the crystal above 5.0\u00a0\u00c5.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43347-9\nFigure\u00a01.

Comparison of Br-doped glass and glass ceramic with a pure Li3PS4 glass as a reference.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16063 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43347-9\nHerein, we investigate the high ionic conductivity observed in Br-doped glass ceramic, which exhibit comparable performance to Li7P3S11, comprising PS4 and P2S7 molecules. Therefore, we determined the specific location of the Br\u2212 anion within the glass ceramic, which has an almost crystalline structure. The newly formed crystalline phase is considered metastable owing to its broad diffraction peak width, which poses challenges for applying Rietveld refinement without a hypothesis. To address this, we conducted XRD calculations for structurally stable configurations verified via self-consistent field calculations using density functional theory (see Fig.\u00a0S1). Several initial structures were assumed, and insertion and substitution-type structural models were obtained based on the LGPS structure, as depicted in Fig.\u00a04. As shown in the figure, the insertion type involves the presence of Br\u2212 ions within the gaps between PS4 molecules. Given that the PS4 molecule carries a charge of \u2212 3 and the GeS4 molecule in LGPS structure is \u2212 4, there are likely three or four Br\u2212 ions associated with each PS4 molecule. Br\u2212 ions tend to form clusters together with Li ions.\nFigure\u00a0S1a represents the structure without Br, while Fig.\u00a0S1b shows the addition of one Br atom to both the (0,0,0) and (0.5,0.5,0.5) sites. The circle in the in the figure represents the experimental XRD, while the blue line represents the calculated XRD based on the structural model. One Br added to the model results in an approximate LiBr ratio (mol%) of 7.7. Considering a more realistic scenario, we added approximately two Br ions, resulting in a LiBr ratio of ~ 14.3\u00a0mol%. Additionally, we investigated the substitution-type structural model using the same approach. Four S ions at positions (0.00000, 0.30099, 0.79168), (0.00000, 0.69901, 0.79168), (0.20443, 0.50000, 0.59727), and (0.79557, 0.50000, 0.59727) on the P1 site were replaced with one to four Br\u2212 ions, as shown in Fig.\u00a0S1c\u2013e. As depicted in Fig.\u00a0S1f,g, we examined structural models for insertion and substitution types. The results indicated that the substitution-type with four Br atoms at the P1 site closely matched the experimental data. The PDF G(r) for these two models was calculated and compared to validate the insertion and substitution types in terms of local structure. The experimental data are represented by black lines, the calculated insertion type by light green solid lines, and the substitution-type by blue solid lines (see Fig.\u00a05). It is evident from these figures that the peak reproducibility is higher for the substitution-type compared to the insertion type. Furthermore, the substitution-type structural model accurately reproduced the characteristic peak appeared at ~ 4.0\u00a0\u00c5, confirming its presence in the system with Br. Therefore, it is highly likely that Br forms clusters at the P1 site.\nBased on our consideration, we chose the substitution-type structural model and replaced the P1 site with a Br cluster. Structural optimization was then carried out using Rietveld analysis. The results revealed that the occupancy of Br is 0.15 ~ 0.25, suggesting that 15 ~ 25% of PS4 molecules are replaced by the Br cluster. Figure\u00a06 shows that incorporating an 8% Br cluster in the structural model accurately reproduces the XRD pattern. Detailed structural parameters can be found in Table\u00a0S1. Notably, the atomic displacement of P in the Br cluster differs significantly from the unsubstituted structural model, indicating substantial anion fluctuations within the structure compared to the pure unsubstituted model.\nFigure\u00a07a illustrates the Li-ion conduction pathway investigated by depicting the \u0394E = 0.80\u00a0eV in the Br cluster-substituted structural model. The presence of Br clusters hinders the pathway for Li-ion conduction, while the pathway emerges in regions without Br. Upon examining the overall structural model, it is evident that the paths do not form in the c-axis direction but rather in the b-axis direction. The calculations for \u03b2-Li3PS4, which exhibits low conductivity, yield similar results as depicted in Fig.\u00a07b, indicating the absence of such pathways. In contrast, the structural model of LGPS with high ionic conductivity displays a formation of a three-dimensional pathway, as depicted in Fig.\u00a07c. The presence of Br is considered a contributing factor to the enhanced ionic conductivity through halogen addition. However, the limited formation of high-conductivity pathways along the c-axis in the vicinity of Br likely accounts for the disparity in ionic conductivity compared to LGPS.\n(a) Insertion-type (b) Substitution-type\nFigure\u00a04.

            "text": "Br-doped Li3PS4 exhibits a minimal presence of P2S7 molecules that effectively suppresses the generation of H2S. Instead, it forms an LGPS-like structure and demonstrates high ion conductivity. This characteristic makes it a promising material for solid electrolytes in all-solid-state batteries, striking a balance between desirable properties.\nThe local structural characterization conducted through high-energy XRD and PDF analysis confirms that the molecular framework structure of the precursor glass remains unaltered. Upon converting to glass ceramic and subsequent crystallization, PS4 sites randomly incorporate Br atoms. Furthermore, using the Bond valence sum method to visualize Li-ion conduction pathways in the structural model, one can observe that Br facilitates the formation of ionic conduction paths resembling those found in LGPS. However, the formation of pathways along the c-axis direction is insufficient owing to structural geometry limitations.\nThis study emphasizes the importance of structure control in glass ceramic as it can pave the way for developing novel glass/glass\u2013ceramic solid electrolyte materials in future research."
