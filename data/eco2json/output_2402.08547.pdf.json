    "abstractText": "We consider the setting of repeated fair division between two players, denoted Alice and Bob, with private valuations over a cake. In each round, a new cake arrives, which is identical to the ones in previous rounds. Alice cuts the cake at a point of her choice, while Bob chooses the left piece or the right piece, leaving the remainder for Alice. We consider two versions: sequential, where Bob observes Alice\u2019s cut point before choosing left/right, and simultaneous, where he only observes her cut point after making his choice. The simultaneous version was first considered by Aumann and Maschler [AM95]. We observe that if Bob is almost myopic and chooses his favorite piece too often, then he can be systematically exploited by Alice through a strategy akin to a binary search. This strategy allows Alice to approximate Bob\u2019s preferences with increasing precision, thereby securing a disproportionate share of the resource over time. We analyze the limits of how much a player can exploit the other one and show that fair utility profiles are in fact achievable. Specifically, the players can enforce the equitable utility profile of (1/2, 1/2) in the limit on every trajectory of play, by keeping the other player\u2019s utility to approximately 1/2 on average while guaranteeing they themselves get at least approximately 1/2 on average. We show this theorem using a connection with Blackwell approachability [Bla56]. Finally, we analyze a natural dynamic known as fictitious play, where players best respond to the empirical distribution of the other player. We show that fictitious play converges to the equitable utility profile of (1/2, 1/2) at a rate of O(1/ \u221a T ).",

There is an extensive literature on cake cutting in mathematics, political science, economics [RW98, BT96, Mou03] and computer science [BCE+16], with a number of protocols implemented [GP14].\nTraditional approaches to cake cutting often consider single instances of division. However, many real-world scenarios require a repeated division of resources. For instance, consider the recurring task of allocating classroom space in educational institutions each quarter or that of repeatedly dividing computational resources (such as CPU and memory) among the members of an organization. These settings reflect the reality of many social and economic interactions, necessitating a model that not only addresses the fairness of a single division, but also the dynamics and strategies that emerge among participants over repeated interactions.\nRepeated fair division is a classic problem first considered by Aumann and Maschler [AM95], where two players\u2014denoted Alice and Bob\u2014have private valuations over the cake and interact in the following environment. Every day a new cake arrives, which is the same as the ones in previous days. Alice cuts the cake at a point of her choosing, while Bob chooses either the left piece or the right piece, leaving the remainder to Alice. [AM95] considered the simultaneous setting, where both players take their actions at the same time each day, and analyzed the payoffs achievable by Bob when he can have one of two types of valuations.\nIn this paper, we provide the first substantial progress in this classic setting. We further analyze the simultaneous version from [AM95] and also go beyond it, by considering the sequential version where Bob has the advantage of observing Alice\u2019s chosen cut point before making his selection. Tactical considerations remain pivotal in the sequential version, which is none other than the repeated Cut-and-choose protocol with strategic players.\nA key observation in our study is the strategic vulnerability inherent in repeated Cut-andchoose. At a high level, if Bob consistently chooses his preferred piece, then he can be systematically exploited by Alice through a strategy akin to a binary search. This strategy allows Alice to approximate Bob\u2019s preferences with increasing precision, thereby securing a disproportionate share of the resource over time. To fight back Alice\u2019s attempt to exploit him, Bob could deceive her by being unpredictable, thus hiding his preferences. While this behavior has the potential to reduce Alice\u2019s share of the cake, it could also come at the price of affecting Bob\u2019s own payoff guarantees in the long term.\nOur analysis of the repeated cake cutting game formalizes the intuition that Alice can exploit a (nearly) myopic Bob that often chooses his favorite piece. However, the outcome where Alice gets more value is not necessarily fair, as she is happier than Bob. The fairness notion of equitability embodies the idea that players should be equally happy, formally requiring that Alice\u2019s value for her allocation should equal Bob\u2019s value for his allocation. Achieving equitability is particularly important in scenarios with potential for conflict, such as splitting an inheritance.\nWe show that achieving equitable outcomes in the repeated interaction is in fact possible. Specifically, each player has a strategy that ensures that the other player gets no more than approximately 1/2 on average, while they themselves also get approximately 1/2 on average. This approaches the equitable utility profile of (1/2, 1/2) in the limit. We obtain this result by using a connection with Blackwell approachability [Bla56]. Finally, we consider a natural dynamic known as fictitious play [Bro51], where the players best respond to the empirical frequency given by the past actions of the other player. We show that fictitious play converges to the equitable utility profile of (1/2, 1/2) at a rate of O(1/ \u221a T )."

Each player i has a private value density function vi : [0, 1]\u2192 R+.\nThe value of player i for each interval [c, d] \u2286 [0, 1] is denoted Vi([c, d]) = \u222b d c vi(x) dx. The\nvaluations are additive: Vi (\u22c3m j=1Xj ) = \u2211m\nj=1 Vi(Xj) for all disjoint intervals X1, . . . , Xm \u2286 [0, 1]. By definition, atoms are worth zero and the valuations are normalized so that Vi([0, 1]) = 1 for each player i. We assume the densities are bounded:\n\u2022 There exist \u03b4,\u2206 > 0 such that \u03b4 \u2264 vi(x) \u2264 \u2206 for all x \u2208 [0, 1].\nA piece of cake is a finite union of disjoint intervals. A piece is connected if it\u2019s a single interval. An allocation Z = (ZA, ZB) is a partition of the cake among the players such that each player i receives piece Zi, the pieces are disjoint, and \u22c3 i\u2208N Zi = [0, 1]. The valuation (aka utility or payoff) of player i at an allocation Z is Vi(Zi).

            "text": "We start with the following observation about the sequential setting. If Bob chooses his favorite piece in each round, then Alice can exploit him in the long run by running binary search on his midpoint until identifying it within a small error and then cutting near it for the rest of time. This will lead to Alice getting essentially her Stackelberg value in all but O(log T ) rounds, while Bob will get 1/2 in all but O(log T ) rounds.\nProposition 1. If Bob plays myopically in the sequential setting, then Alice has a strategy that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O(log T ).\nThis exploitation phenomenon holds more generally: if Bob\u2019s strategy has bounded regret with respect to the standard of selecting his preferred piece in every round in hindsight, then Alice can almost get her Stackelberg value in each round. Her Stackelberg regret is a function of Bob\u2019s regret guarantee, as quantified in the next theorem.\nTheorem 1 (Exploiting a nearly myopic Bob). Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). Suppose Bob plays a strategy that ensures his regret is O(T\u03b1) in the sequential setting. Let B\u03b1 denote the set of all such Bob strategies.\n\u2022 If Alice knows \u03b1, she has a strategy SA = SA(\u03b1) that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O ( T \u03b1+1 2 log T ) .\nMoreover, Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) for some Bob strategy in B\u03b1.\n\u2022 If Alice does not know \u03b1, she has a strategy SA that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O ( T log T ) .\nThis is essentially optimal: if SA guarantees Alice Stackelberg regret O(T \u03b2) against all Bob strategies in B\u03b1 for some \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1), then SA has Stackelberg regret \u2126(T ) for some Bob strategy in B\u03b2.\n1The sequential version is the repeated Cut-and-choose protocol, where the players may not necessarily be honest.\nIn contrast, in the simultaneous setting, Alice may not approach her Stackelberg value on every trajectory of play. In order to get her Stackelberg value in any given round, Alice needs to cut near Bob\u2019s midpoint and Bob needs to pick the piece he prefers, say R. However, if Bob deterministically commits to picking R, he will be completely exploited by an Alice who cuts at 1, breaking any reasonable regret guarantee he might have. Indeed, any Bob with a deterministic strategy (possibly using different actions over the rounds) has a corresponding Alice who can completely exploit him. Therefore, any Bob strategy with a good regret guarantee would behave randomly, making it impossible for Alice to reliably get her Stackelberg value on every trajectory. For this reason, we focus on the sequential setting when studying how Alice can exploit Bob.2"

            "text": "We overview related work in several areas, including fair division, repeated games and their connections with learning.\nCake cutting and fairness notions. The cake cutting model was introduced in [Ste48] to capture the allocation of a heterogeneous resource among agents with complex preferences. There are n players, each with a private value density over the cake, which is represented as the interval [0, 1]. The goal is to find a \u201cfair\u201d allocation of the cake among the n players, where the fairness notion could include proportionality, envy-freeness 3, and equitability. The related task of necklace splitting [Alo87] requires dividing the cake in t pieces (not necessarily contiguous) such that each player has value 1/t for each of the pieces. Special cases include the consensus halving problem, where t = 2, and finding perfect allocations, where t = n. For surveys, see [RW98, BT96, Mou03, BCE+16, Pro13].\nExistence of fair allocations. Proportional allocations with contiguous pieces can be computed efficiently for any number of players [EP84, DS61]. However, the existence of more stringent fairness notions such as envy-freenes is typically ensured by a fixed point theorem. An envy-free allocation with contiguous pieces exists for any instance with n of players via an application of Sperner\u2019s lemma or Brouwer\u2019s fixed point theorem [ES99, Str80], while the existence of perfect partitions is shown via Borsuk-Ulam [Alo87].\nComplexity of cake cutting. There is a standard query model for cake cutting, called the Robertson-Webb (RW) query model [WS07], where a mediator (algorithm) helps the players find a fair division by asking them enough queries about their preferences until it has sufficient information to output a fair allocation.\nProportional allocations with contiguous pieces can be computed with O(n log n) queries [EP84], with matching lower bounds for finding proportional (not necessarily contiguous) allocations were given in [WS07, EP06].\nFor the query complexity of exact envy-free cake cutting (possibly with disconnected pieces), a lower bound of \u2126(n2) was given by [Pro09] and an upper bound of O ( nn nn nn )\nby [AM16]. [ACF+18] designed a simpler algorithm for 4 agents. The problem of computing envy-free allocations with high probability was solved by [Che20].\nEquitable, envy-free, or perfect allocations with minimum number of cuts cannot be computed exactly by RW protocols [Str08], thus \u03b5-fairness becomes the goal. The query complexity of finding \u03b5-fair (envy-free, equitable, perfect) allocations was analyzed in [CDP13, PW17, BN22, BN19, HR23]. [DQS12] studied the complexity of cake cutting in the white box model, showing that \u03b5-envy-free cake cutting with contiguous pieces is PPAD-complete when the valuations are unrestricted (i.e. not necessarily induced by value densities, allowing externalities). See [GHS20, FRHHH22, Seg18] for more on the complexity of cake cutting.\n3An allocation is envy-free if no player prefers the piece of another player to their own.\nThe complexity of consensus halving was studied, e.g., in [DFH21, GHI+20, FRHSZ20] and the complexity of necklace splitting in [AG20, FRHSZ21].\nIncentives in cake cutting. A body of work studied truthful cake cutting in the RW query model [MT10, BM15] and in the direct revelation model [CLPP13, BST23, BLS22, Tao22]. The equilibria of cake cutting protocols with strategic agents were considered in [NY08, BM13], with an algorithmic model of generalized cut-and-choose protocols proposed in [BCKP16]. [GI21] designed branch-choice protocols as a simpler yet expressive alternative.\nMultiple divisible/indivisible goods and chores. New models. The complexity of finding fair allocations in settings with multiple indivisible was considered in [OPS21, PR20, PR19, MS21, CKMS21, BCF+19] among many others. For more on the fair allocation of indivisible goods and applicable solution concepts, see, e.g., [ABFV22, Pro20, CGM20, CGM+21, PW14]. For the allocation of divisible or indivisible bads, see, e.g., [KMT21, CGMM21].\n[GZH+11] studied fairness in settings inspired by cloud computing, where there are multiple divisible goods (e.g. CPU and memory) and the users have to run jobs with different resource requirements. [GZH+11] introduced the dominant resource fairness (DRF) mechanism and showed it has strong fairness and incentive properties. [PPS15] further studied the properties of the DRF mechanism for indivisible goods. [KSG+20] studied the allocation of multiple goods in settings where the players do not know their own resource requirements, with the goal of designing mechanisms that guarantee efficiency, fairness, and strategy-proofness.\nCake cutting with separation was studied in [ESS21], fair division of a graph or graphical cake cutting in [BCE+17, BS21, DEG+22], multi-layered cakes in [IM21], cake cutting where some parts are good and others bad in [SH18], and when the whole cake is a bad (e.g. chore) in [FH18, DFHY18, HSY23]. Cake cutting in two dimensions was studied in [SHNHA17] and cake cutting in practice in [KOS22]. The allocation of multiple homogeneous divisible goods was studied in [CGPS22].\nDynamic fair division. Closest to our setting is the analysis in the book of [AM95] (page 243), where two players are dividing a cake with a cherry. Alice (the cutter) has a uniform density and so she does not care for the cherry, while Bob (the chooser) may or may not like the cherry. Alice and Bob declare their actions simultaneously and Alice is only allowed to cut in one of two locations. Additionally, Alice has a prior over the type of Bob she is facing. The question is how the players should behave in the repeated game. [AM95] analyze the set of payoffs approachable for Bob using Blackwell approachability. The difference from our setting is that we allow arbitrary value densities for the players and do not assume priors. Additionally, we also consider the sequential version.\nOnline cake cutting was considered by [Wal11], in the setting where agents can arrive and depart over time and the goal is to still ensure some form of fairness. Dynamic fair division with multiple divisible goods was studied in [KPS14], with agents arriving over time but not departing and the allocation algorithm taking irrevocable decisions (i.e., the resources can never be taken back once given to an agent).\n[FPV15] considered the allocation of a single unit of a divisible resource when the arrivals and departures of the agents are uncertain. The question is how to maintain fairness and Pareto efficiency in a way that minimizes the disruptions to existing allocations. [BHP22] consider dynamic fair division with partial information, where T goods become available over a sequence of rounds, every good must be allocated immediately and irrevocably before the next one arrives, and the valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution.\nLearning in repeated Stackelberg games. The Stackelberg game (competition) was first introduced by [Sta34] to understand the first mover advantage of firms when entering a market. The Stackelberg equilibrium concept has received significant interest in economics and computer science, with real world applications such as security games [Tam11, BBHP15], online strategic classification [DRS+18], and online principal agent problems [HMRS23]. Our model can be seen as each player facing an online learning version of a repeated Stackelberg game.\n[KL03] considered a seller\u2019s problem of designing an efficient repeated posted price mechanism to buy identical goods when it interacts with a sequence of myopic buyers. [GXG+19, BGH+20, ZZJJ23] considered a repeated Stackelberg game to study how the follower or leader can exploit the opponent in a general game with arbitrary payoffs. Their techniques, however, do not apply to our model as they typically consider the setting of one player knowing the entire payoff matrix trying to deceive the other player given various behavioral assumptions.\nExploiting no-regret agents. Several works have considered the extent to which one player can exploit the knowledge that the other player has a strategy with sublinear regret. The goal is often to approach the Stackelberg value, the maximum payoff that the exploiter could get by selecting an action first and allowing the opponent to best-respond. In simultaneous games, [DSS19] showed that it is possible for the exploiter to get arbitrarily close to their Stackelberg value, assuming knowledge of the other player\u2019s payoff function. [HLNW22] showed that, for certain types of sequential games, an exploiting leader can approach their Stackelberg value in the limit. Our Theorem 1 is a similar statement in our setting, but we bound the exploited agent\u2019s behavior with an explicit regret guarantee rather than using discounted future payoffs. Moreover, our setting is not captured by the types of games they consider.\nFictitious play. Fictitious play was introduced in [Bro51]. Convergence to Nash equilibria has been shown for zero-sum games [Rob51] and special cases of general-sum games [Nac90, MS96b, MS96a].\nNone of these results directly apply to our setting, but the most relevant is [Ber05], which covered non-degenerate 2 \u00d7 n games (i.e. where every action has a unique best response). Our \u201c2 \u00d7 \u221e\u201d game is degenerate, as Bob does not have a unique best response to Alice cutting at mB. Few existing works apply fictitious play to settings where the players have continuous action spaces. An example is [PL14], which showed that a variant (stochastic fictitious play) does converge in two-player zero-sum games with continuous action spaces.\n[Kar59] conjectured that fictitious play converges at a rate of O(T\u22121/2). [BFH13] found small games where the convergence rate is O(T\u22121/2), but with very large constants in the O(). [DP14] disproved Karlin\u2019s conjecture, showing that there exist games in which convergence takes place at a rate of \u2126(T\u22121/n) using adversarial tie-breaking rules. [PPSC23] found more examples of games in which fictitious play converges exponentially slowly in the number n of actions that each player has.\n[Har98] showed that fictitious play converges at a rate of O(T\u22121) in 2 \u00d7 2 zero-sum games. [ALW21] considered settings with diagonal payoff matrices and non-adversarial tie-breaking rules and showed convergence rates of O(T\u22121/2). The result in [ALW21] does not imply a rate of convergence in our setting because requiring the payoff matrix to be diagonal would correspond to Alice only being allowed to cut at 0 or 1. This assumption is not as natural in our setting. In fact, if Alice can only cut at 0 or 1 the game becomes zero-sum. Furthermore, we allow arbitrary tie-breaking rules.\nStrategic experimentation In the general strategic experimentation model, there are n players and k arms. In every round, each player pulls an arm, receives the resulting reward, and obtains feedback about the other player. There are two types of feedback models: perfect monitoring, where the feedback consists of both the choice of the other player and their reward; and imperfect monitoring, where the feedback consists of the choice of the other player but not their reward.\n[BH99] study strategic experimentation with two players, two arms, and perfect monitoring in continuous time, where one of the arms is \u201csafe\u201d and emits steady rewards, while the other arm is \u201crisky\u201d and is governed by a stochastic process. The main effects observed in symmetric equilibria are a free rider effect and an encouragement effect, where a player may explore more in order to encourage further exploration from others. [KRC05] considered the same problem for exponential bandits, and obtained a unique symmetric Markov equilibria followed by various asymmetric ones. We refer to [HS17] for a survey.\n[Aoy98, Aoy11] study strategic experimentation with imperfect monitoring when there are two players and two arms with discrete priors, showing that the players eventually settle on the same arm in any equilibrium. This is a version of the agreement theorem by [Aum76] for the multi-player multi-armed bandit model, stating that rational players cannot agree to disagree. [RSV07, RSV13] also study the model with imperfect monitoring, but where the decision to switch from the risky arm to the safe one is irreversible.\nThe model with imperfect monitoring has similarities to our setting. Our model also involves two players engaged in a strategic repeated game such that each player observes the action of the other player but not their reward. The main difference is that the payoffs of the players are misaligned, the action spaces are orthogonal, and the payoffs are deterministic. It is also an interesting open direction for future work to explore what happens if the payoffs in our model are stochastic.\nSocial learning Initiated by [Ban92, Wel92], a long line of literature studied social learning (or herd behavior) to investigate agents who learn over time in a shared environment. Unlike the strategic experimentation model, the agents do not strategize against each other, but only observe the past actions and possibly rewards therein. The objective is to identify whether the social learning succeeds or fails if the agents receive private signals [SS00], have behavioral biases [BHSS23], or have a certain network structure [BG98]. Incentivized exploration by [KMP14, CH18] considers mechanism design in a similar problem, to induce the society to behave in a desired manner."

Suppose Alice uses a mixed strategy SA and Bob uses a mixed strategy SB. We say that\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s strategy SA ensures Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is at most \u03b3 against SB if RegA(H) \u2264 \u03b3 for all T -round histories H that could have arisen under the strategy pair (SA, SB).\n\u2022 Bob\u2019s strategy SB ensures Bob\u2019s regret is at most \u03b3 if RegB(H) \u2264 \u03b3 for all T -round histories H that could have arisen under the strategy pair (SA, SB).\nMore broadly, a Bob strategy SB has regret \u03b3 if\n\u2022 RegB(H) \u2264 \u03b3 for all T -round historiesH that could have arisen under strategy pairs (SA, SB), for all Alice strategies SA.\nNext we provide a proof sketch for Theorem 1, which is divided in the next two propositions, corresponding to the cases where Alice knows and does not know \u03b1.\nProposition 2. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). Suppose Bob plays a strategy that ensures his regret is O(T\u03b1) and let B\u03b1 denote the set of all such Bob strategies. Assume Alice knows \u03b1. Then she has a strategy SA = SA(\u03b1) that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O ( T \u03b1+1 2 log T ) . This is essentially optimal:\nAlice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) for some Bob strategy in B\u03b1.\nProof sketch. We sketch both the upper and lower bounds.\nSketch for the upper bound. Let SB denote Bob\u2019s strategy, which guarantees his regret is O(T\u03b1). Suppose Alice knows \u03b1. Then Alice initializes an interval I = [0, 1] and uses the next strategy. Iteratively, for i = 0, 1, . . . ,:\n1. Alice discretizes the interval I = [u,w] in a constant number of sub-intervals (set to 6) of equal value to her, by cutting at points ai,j for j \u2208 [5] such that u < ai,1 < ai,2 < . . . < ai,5 < w. Denote ai,0 = u and ai,6 = w.\nThe full proof explains why the index j from step 3 is unique and why it is in fact necessary to include a slightly larger interval than [ai,j , ai,j+1] in the recursion step, due to Bob potentially having lied if his midpoint was very close to a boundary of [ai,j , ai,j+1] but on the other side. Sketch for the lower bound. The lower bound of \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) relies on the observation that\nrounds where Alice cuts near mB and Bob picks his less-preferred piece cost Bob very little but cost Alice a lot. More precisely, suppose mA < mB and Alice cuts at mB \u2212 \u03b5. Then compared to his regret bound, Bob loses \u0398(\u03b5) if he picks the wrong piece. On the other hand, Alice loses \u0398(mB \u2212mA) = \u0398(1) compared to her Stackelberg value.\nBob can use this asymmetry by acting as if his midpoint were \u0398 ( T \u03b1\u22121 2 ) closer to mA than it\nreally is. Lying \u0398 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) times costs Bob only \u0398(T\u03b1) regret, but costs Alice \u0398 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) regret. To\navoid accumulating more regret than this, Bob can afterwards revert to picking his truly preferred piece; the damage to Alice\u2019s payoff has already been done.\nProposition 3. Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). Suppose Bob plays a strategy that ensures his regret is O(T\u03b1). Let B\u03b1 denote the set of all such Bob strategies. If Alice does not know \u03b1, she has a strategy SA that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O ( T\nlog T\n) .\nThis is essentially optimal: if SA guarantees Alice Stackelberg regret O(T \u03b2) against all Bob strategies in B\u03b1 for some \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1), then SA has Stackelberg regret \u2126(T ) for some Bob strategy in B\u03b2.\nProof sketch. Alice\u2019s strategy that achieves O(T/ log T ) regret follows the same template as her strategy from Proposition 2. The only difference is that she sets \u03b7 differently (and much larger) to cover any possible regret bound Bob could have.\nThe main idea of the lower bound is that, if Alice does not know the value of \u03b1 in Bob\u2019s regret bound, she cannot know when she has true information about Bob\u2019s preferences. We exploit this by having a Bob with O(T \u03b2) regret behave exactly like one with O(T\u03b1) regret but a different midpoint. Then Bob can hide his deception from an Alice with O(T \u03b2) regret because he can tolerate more regret than Alice.\nTheorem 1 is implied by Proposition 2 and Proposition 3.\nWe briefly remark that the players\u2019 value densities must be bounded for Theorem 1 to hold; see Remark 1 in Appendix A.2 for a counterexample with unbounded value densities."

Alice\u2019s strategy is based on Blackwell approachability [Bla56]. The challenge is that Alice has to be prepared for an uncountably infinite variety of Bob\u2019s valuation functions, while the original construction in [Bla56] works when the number of player types is finite. Another difference is that Alice\u2019s action space is also infinite, which turns out to be necessary.\nWe get around the infinite-Bob issue in two steps. First, Alice\u2019s strategy defines a countably infinite set V as a stand-in for the full variety of Bobs. We design V to include arbitrarily good approximations to any valuation function.\nSecond, we replace Blackwell\u2019s original finite-dimensional space with a countably-infinite-dimensional one, where the elements of V are the axes. We define an inner product on this space and use it to adopt Blackwell\u2019s argument. Briefly, Alice\u2019s strategy tracks the average payoff to each type of Bob in V and defines S to be the region of the space where all of them have payoffs at most 1/2. In each round, she constructs a cut point which moves the Bobs\u2019 average payoff closer to S, and in the limit traps them in S.\nUnder this strategy, Alice\u2019s payoff guarantee is mostly a byproduct of Bob\u2019s. If Bob and Alice have the same value density, then uA+uB = 1, so bounding Bob\u2019s payoff to 1/2 also bounds Alice\u2019s to 1/2. We achieve the substantially better bound on Alice\u2019s payoff by explicitly including her value density vA in the set V of Bobs, thus eliminating any approximation error."

The precise statement is included next.\nRestatement of Theorem 4.

To analyze the fictitious play dynamic, we define for each t = 0, . . . , T :\n\u2022 \u03b1t = rt\u2212 \u2113t, where rt is the number of times Bob picked R up to round t and \u2113t is the number of times he picked L\n\u2022 \u03b2t = \u2211t\n\u03c4=1\n( 2VB([0, a\u03c4 ])\u2212 1 ) .\nThe quantities \u03b1t and \u03b2t control what happens under fictitious play: Alice\u2019s decision in round t+1 is based on \u03b1t and Bob\u2019s decision in round t+1 is based on \u03b2t. These decisions in turn affect\n\u03b1t+1 and \u03b2t+1, forming a dynamical system. In general, these dynamics result in a counterclockwise spiral through \u03b1-\u03b2 space. Figure 6 illustrates the sequences \u03b1t and \u03b2t for the instance in Figure 2.\nWe define \u03c1t = |\u03b1t| + |\u03b2t| and formalize this spiral, by showing that the sequence {\u03c1}Tt=0 is non-decreasing and analyzing the change in (\u03b1t, \u03b2t) from round to round. Figure 6 illustrates the parameter \u03c1t over time. Figure 7 illustrates the spiral (associated with the same trajectory as in Figure 2 and 6), where the spiral is visualized as a scatter plot of the sequence (\u03b1t, \u03b2t)t\u22651.\nWe first use these dynamics to bound Bob\u2019s payoff. Bob\u2019s payoff can be almost directly read off due to changes in \u03b2t closely matching changes in Bob\u2019s payoff. Bob\u2019s total payoff to round t turns out to be of the order t/2\u00b1 \u03c1t, so bounding the rate at which the spiral expands also bounds Bob\u2019s payoff.\nWe then use the dynamics to bound the total payoff to Alice and Bob. Alice can only cut in the interior of the cake when \u03b1t = 0, which happens less and less often as the spiral expands. The players\u2019 total payoff when Alice cuts at one end of the cake is 1, so across T rounds we show the sum of cumulative payoffs of the players is of the order T \u00b1\u0398( \u221a T ).\nCombining the bound on the total payoff with the bound on Bob\u2019s payoff gives a bound for Alice\u2019s payoff."

            "text": "Restatement of Proposition 1. If Bob plays myopically in the sequential setting, then Alice has a strategy that ensures her Stackelberg regret is O(log T ).\nProof. We consider an explore-then-commit type of algorithm for Alice. In the exploration phase, Alice does binary search to find Bob\u2019s midpoint (within accuracy of 1/T ). In the commitment (exploitation) phase, Alice repeatedly cuts at Bob\u2019s approximate midpoint. This leads to Alice getting nearly her Stackelberg value in nearly every round. Figure 8 shows a visualization of a cake instance with Alice and Bob\u2019s midpoints, respectively, with Alice\u2019s search process.\nAlice\u2019s algorithm is described precisely in Figure 9.\nWe show that Algorithm A.1 in Figure 9 with \u03c4 = \u0398(lnT ) gives the desired regret bound in several steps.\nBob\u2019s midpoint lies in the interval [rt, \u2113t] for all t To this end, we first claim that Bob\u2019s midpoint lies in [\u2113t, rt] at each round t. We proceed by induction on t. The base case is t = 1 clearly holds since \u21131 = 0 and r1 = 1, so mB \u2208 [\u21131, r1]. Suppose that mB \u2208 [\u2113t, rt] for some t \u2265 1. Given that Alice cuts at xt \u2208 (\u2113t, rt), if bt = L, this implies that mB \u2208 [\u2113t, xt]. Hence mB \u2208 [\u2113t, xt] = [\u2113t+1, rt+1]. This argument also holds when Bob chooses R. Thus by induction, we conclude that mB \u2208 [\u2113t, rt] for every t \u2208 [T ].\nAlice\u2019s midpoint satisfies mA /\u2208 (\u2113t, rt) for every t \u2265 2 Now, during the execution of the algorithm, we will next show that Alice\u2019s midpoint mA satisfies either of mA \u2264 \u2113t and mA \u2265 rt, i.e., mA /\u2208 (\u2113t, rt) for every t \u2265 2. To see this, recall that in the first round, Alice cuts x1 = mA. If b1 = L, then \u21132 = 0 and r2 = mA. In this case, [\u21132, r2] = [0,mA], so mA /\u2208 (\u21132, r2). Afterwards, it still holds since the intervals only shrink, i.e., (\u2113t+1, rt+1) \u2282 (\u2113t, rt). Similarly, consider the case that b1 = R. Then, we have \u21132 = mA and r2 = 1. Thus [\u21132, r2] = [mA, 1], which implies that mA /\u2208 (\u21132, r2). Again since the intervals (\u2113t, rt) only shrink, we conclude that mA /\u2208 (\u2113t, rt) for every t \u2265 2.\nInterval exponentially shrinks We have VA([\u2113t, rt]) = VA([\u2113t\u22121, rt\u22121])/2 for every t \u2208 [T ], as we shrink the interval by cutting a point that equalizes Alice\u2019s value for both parts within the interval. This implies that VA([\u2113\u03c4 , r\u03c4 ]) = 2 \u2212\u03c4+1.\nBounding exploitation phase regret In the exploitation phase, due to the observation above, we have two cases: (i) mA \u2264 \u2113\u03c4 and (ii) mA \u2265 r\u03c4 . We will prove that in either case, Alice\u2019s single-round regret in the exploitation phase is at most 2\u2212\u03c4+1 +\u2206/T .\n\u2022 For the first case of mA \u2264 \u2113\u03c4 , Alice keeps cutting at \u2113\u03c4 \u2212 1/T for the rest of rounds as per the algorithm\u2019s description. Then, Bob will myopically choose R and Alice will obtain VA([0, \u2113\u03c4 \u2212 1/T ]). In this case, we have that mA \u2264 mB since mB \u2208 [\u2113\u03c4 , r\u03c4 ]. Then, Alice\u2019s single-round regret in the exploitation phase is bounded by\nVA([0,mB])\u2212 VA([0, \u2113\u03c4 \u2212 1/T ]) = VA([\u2113\u03c4 ,mB]) + VA([\u2113\u03c4 \u2212 1/T, \u2113\u03c4 ])\n\u2264 VA([\u2113\u03c4 , r\u03c4 ]) + \u2206\nT\n= 2\u2212\u03c4+1 + \u2206\nT .\n\u2022 Otherwise suppose mA \u2265 r\u03c4 . According to the algorithm, Alice keeps cutting r\u03c4 + 1/T for all the rest of the rounds, and Bob will respond with L. In this case we have mA \u2265 mB since mB \u2208 [\u2113\u03c4 , r\u03c4 ]. Similarly, Alice\u2019s single-round regret can be upper-bounded by\nVA([mB, 1])\u2212 VA([r\u03c4 + 1/T, 1]) = VA([mB, r\u03c4 ]) + VA([r\u03c4 , r\u03c4 + 1/T ])\n\u2264 VA([\u2113\u03c4 , r\u03c4 ]) + \u2206\nT\n= 2\u2212\u03c4+1 + \u2206\nT .\nHence in both cases, Alice\u2019s single-round regret in the exploitation phase is at most 2\u2212\u03c4+1 +\u2206/T .\nFinal regret bound Overall, by simply upper-bounding Alice\u2019s single-round regret in the exploration phase by 1, we obtain the following upper bound for the total regret:\n\u03c4 \u00b7 1 + (T \u2212 \u03c4) \u00b7 ( 2\u2212\u03c4+1 + \u2206\nT\n) .\nPlugging \u03c4 = ln(T ), we obtain the regret bound of O(lnT ), which completes the proof.5"

Overall, Alice will use an explore-then-commit style of algorithm:\n\u2022 In the exploration phase, Alice will conduct a variant of binary search to locate Bob\u2019s midpoint mB within an accuracy of O (\u221a f(T )/T log T ) .\n\u2022 In the exploitation phase, Alice will cut near the estimated midpoint for the rest of the rounds.\nThe main difficulty that Alice encounters is to precisely locate Bob\u2019s midpoint in the exploration phase, since Bob can fool Alice if she cuts sufficiently close to his midpoint. We overcome this challenge by having Alice\u2019s algorithm stay far enough from mB so that Bob is forced to answer truthfully most of the time. Notation. Let w = \u221a f(T )/T lnT . Then n = \u230a\u2212 log2(3w)\u230b. Since f(T ) < T(lnT )2 by the assumption in the proposition statement, we have w < 1 and thereby n \u2265 0. Also recall the proposition\nstatement assumes that Bob\u2019s strategy guarantees him a regret of at most rf(T ) for some r > 0. Moreover, T was chosen such that T > exp ( 4r\u2206 \u03b4 ) .\nConsider the Alice strategy described in Algorithm A.2 (Fig. 10). By Lemma 1, the exploration phase in Alice\u2019s strategy is well-defined.\nNext we derive some useful observations and then combine them to upper-bound Alice\u2019s regret.\nUseful observations. By Lemma 2, we have mB \u2208 [xn, yn]. Consider the cut point \u03c7 in the exploitation phase. We write Intv[x, y] to denote the interval [x, y] if y \u2265 x and [y, x] if x > y. Then, we obtain\nVA(Intv[\u03c7,mB]) \u2264 VA([xn, yn]) (By definition of \u03c7) = 2\u2212n (By property 2 of Lemma 2)\n\u2264 2log2(3w)+1 (Plugging in n and using \u2212\u230a\u2212x\u230b \u2264 x+ 1 )\n= 6\n\u221a f(T )\nT lnT, (4)\nwhere the last identity in (4) holds by definition of w. To upper-bound the number of times that Bob chooses the piece he likes less in the exploitation phase, we consider the following three cases with respect to \u03c7:\n(a) If \u03c7 = xn then mA < xn. Thus xn \u0338= 0, so VB([\u03c7,mB]) > r \u221a f(T )/T by Lemma 2. Since\nBob\u2019s regret is at most rf(T ), it follows that Bob takes the wrong piece at most 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T times.\n(b) If \u03c7 = yn then mA > yn. Thus yn \u0338= 1, so VB([mB, \u03c7]) > r \u221a f(T )/T by Lemma 2. Since\nBob\u2019s regret is at most rf(T ), it follows that Bob takes the wrong piece at most 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T times.\n(c) If \u03c7 = mA, then there is no wrong piece because Alice values both equally. Thus this case does not increase the count of incorrect decisions.\nPutting it all together. In the exploration phase, Alice accumulates regret at most n\u00b75 \u2308\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T \u2309 ,\nsince that is the length of the exploration phase. In the exploitation phase, the regret comes from two sources:\n\u2022 The gap between \u03c7 and mB, which is bounded in equation (4).\n\u2022 The rounds in the exploitation phase in which Bob chooses his least favorite piece. There are at most 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T such rounds by cases (a-c). Thus Alice\u2019s cumulative regret due to these\nrounds is also at most 12 \u221a\nf(T ) \u00b7 T . Then Alice\u2019s overall regret is at most:\nn \u00b7 5 \u2308\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T \u2309 + T \u00b76 \u221a f(T )/T lnT + 1\n2\n\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T\n\u2264n \u00b7 10 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T + T \u00b7 6 \u221a f(T )/T lnT + 1\n2\n\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T\n(Since \u2308x\u2309 \u2264 2x \u2200x \u2265 1) \u2264 ( 5\nln 2 + 6\n)\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T lnT, (Plugging in n and rearranging)\nwhich is O (\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T lnT ) . This completes the proof.\nThe following lemma shows that the exploration phase is well-defined.\nLemma 1. Alice\u2019s strategy from Algorithm A.2 (Fig. 10) has the following properties:\n(i) If step (3.c) is executed in Alice\u2019s exploration phase, then there is a unique index k \u2208 [4] such that ci,j = R \u2200j \u2264 k and ci,j = L \u2200j > k.\n(ii) For each j \u2208 [5], define c\u0303i,j = L if Bob prefers [0, ai,j ] to [ai,j , 1] and c\u0303i,j = R otherwise. If there exists j \u2208 [5] such that c\u0303i,j \u0338= ci,j, then mB \u2208 (ai,j\u22121, ai,j+1).\n(iii) For all i \u2208 {0, . . . , n\u2212 1} and j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , 5}, we have VB([ai,j , ai,j+1]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T .\nProof. We prove each of the parts (i\u2212 iii) required by the lemma.\nProof of part (iii). Let j \u2208 {0, . . . , 5}. Bob\u2019s valuation for the interval [ai,j , ai,j+1] can be lower bounded as follows:\nVB([ai,j , ai,j+1]) \u2265 \u03b4 \u00b7 (ai,j+1 \u2212 ai,j) (Since vB(x) \u2265 \u03b4 \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1])\n\u2265 \u03b4 \u2206 VA([ai,j , ai,j+1]) (Since vA(x) \u2264 \u2206 \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1]) = \u03b4\n\u2206 \u00b7 1 6 VA([xi, yi]) . (5)\nBy definition, Alice\u2019s strategy halves the cake interval considered with each iteration i \u2208 {0, . . . , n\u22121}, that is: VA([xi, yi]) = 1/2\u00b7VA([xi\u22121, yi\u22121]). Thus VA([xi, yi]) = 2\u2212i and 2\u2212i \u2265 2\u2212n for all i \u2208 {0, . . . , n}. Combining these observations with inequality (5), we obtain\nVB([ai,j , ai,j+1]) \u2265 2 \u00b7 \u03b4 12\u2206 2\u2212n . (6)\nLet w = \u221a\nf(T )/T lnT . Then n = \u230a\u2212 log2(3w)\u230b. We have\n\u03b4\n12\u2206 2\u2212n =\n\u03b4\n12\u2206 2\u2212\u230a\u2212 log2(3w)\u230b (By definition of n)\n\u2265 \u03b4 12\u2206 2log2(3w) (Since \u2212\u230a\u2212x\u230b \u2265 x)\n> \u03b4 4\u2206 \u00b7 \u221a f(T ) T \u00b7 4r\u2206 \u03b4 (By definition of w and since T > exp ( 4r\u2206 \u03b4 ) )\n= r \u221a f(T )/T . (7)\nCombining inequalities (6) and (7), we conclude that\nVB([ai,j , ai,j+1]) > 2r\n\u221a f(T )\nT . (8)\nThis concludes the proof of part (iii).\nProof of parts (i) and (ii). For each i = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1, we will show that at most one of the majority answers ci,j , for j \u2208 [5], is different from Bob\u2019s truthful response.\nTo be precise, recall from the lemma statement that c\u0303i,j \u2208 {L,R} is Bob\u2019s truthful response that maximizes his value when Alice cut at ai,j .\nDefine\nSi = { j \u2208 [5] : ci,j \u0338= c\u0303i,j } . (9)\nLet Intv[x, y] denote the interval [x, y] if y \u2265 x and [y, x] if x > y. If j \u2208 Si, it must be the case that Bob picked the wrong piece in at least 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T rounds in which the cut was ai,j . Then Bob accumulated at least VB(Intv[mB, ai,j ]) regret in each such round. Let \u2113 \u2208 [4]. We have\n1\n2\n\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T \u2211 j\u2208Si VB(Intv[mB, ai,j ]) \u2264 r \u00b7 f(T ) (Since Bob\u2019s total regret is at most r \u00b7 f(T ))\n< 1\n2 VB([ai,\u2113, ai,\u2113+1])\n\u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T . (By (8))\nDividing both sides by 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T gives:\u2211\nj\u2208Si\nVB(Intv[mB, ai,j ]) < VB([ai,\u2113, ai,\u2113+1]) \u2200\u2113 \u2208 [4] . (10)\nWe show that |Si| \u2264 1. Suppose towards a contradiction that |Si| > 1, meaning there exist indices j, \u2113 \u2208 Si with j \u0338= \u2113. Then\nIntv[ai,j , ai,\u2113] \u2286 (Intv[mB, ai,j ] \u222a Intv[mB, ai,\u2113]) .\nThis implies that VB(Intv[ai,j , ai,\u2113]) \u2264 VB(Intv[mB, ai,j ]) + VB(Intv[mB, ai,\u2113]) \u2264 \u2211 j\u2208Si VB(Intv[mB, ai,j ]), (11)\nwhich contradicts (10). Thus the assumption was false and |Si| \u2264 1. For any j \u2208 Si, we must have either mB \u2208 (ai,j\u22121, ai,j ] or mB \u2208 [ai,j , ai,j+1), as otherwise (10) would be violated. Therefore, if c\u0303i,j \u0338= ci,j for some j \u2208 [5], then mB \u2208 (ai,j\u22121, ai,j+1). This is part (ii) required by the lemma.\nFinally, we prove part (i). We will show there exists a unique k \u2208 [4] such that ci,j = R \u2200j \u2264 k and ci,j = L \u2200j > k. The proof considers two cases:\n\u2022 Case |Si| = 0. Then every ci,j truthfully reflects Bob\u2019s preferences: ci,j = R if ai,j < mB, and ci,j = L if ai,j > mB; ci,j \u2208 {L,R} if ai,j = mB. An illustration can be seen in Figure 11. In all cases, there is a single switch from R to L, and so the index k is unique.\n\u2022 Case |Si| = 1. Then all but one of the ci,j \u2019s truthfully reflect Bob\u2019s preferences. An illustration can be seen in Figure 12.\nBy part (ii) of the lemma, the only exception occurs at an index j with mB \u2208 (ai,j\u22121, ai,j+1). But then ci,\u2113 = c\u0303i,\u2113 = R for \u2113 \u2264 j \u2212 1 and ci,\u2113 = c\u0303i,\u2113 = L for \u2113 \u2265 j + 1, so regardless of ci,j there will be a single switch from R to L.\nThis concludes that the conditions for ci,j in Step 3.c hold if the conditions in steps 3.a and 3.b do not. This concludes the proof of part (i).\nThe following lemma further reveals several properties of the constructed intervals during the execution of the algorithm.\nLemma 2. In the exploration phase of Algorithm A.2 (Fig. 10), Alice constructs a sequence of intervals\n[x0, y0], [x1, y1], . . . , [xn, yn]\nsuch that the following properties hold:\n\u2022 Property 1: x0 = 0 and y0 = 1,\n\u2022 Property 2: VA([xi+1, yi+1]) = 12VA([xi, yi]) for i = 0, . . . , n\u2212 1,\n\u2022 Property 3: mB \u2208 [xi, yi], for all i, \u2022 Property 4: If xi \u0338= 0, then VB([xi,mB]) > r \u221a f(T )/T .\n\u2022 Property 5: If yi \u0338= 1, then VB([mB, yi]) > r \u221a f(T )/T .\nProof. Property 1 holds since [x0, y0] = [0, 1] by definition of the algorithm. Property 2 follows from our choice of xi+1 and yi+1 always ensuring that [xi+1, yi+1] contains 3 of the 6 intervals of equal value the ai,j divide [xi, yi] into.\nWe will show Properties 3-5 by induction. The base case is i = 0. Then [x0, y0] = [0, 1]. Properties 3-5 are vacuously true for this interval.\nAssume that Properties 3-5 hold for i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1}. For each j \u2208 [5], let c\u0303i,j represent Bob\u2019s truthful answer when the cut point is ai,j . Formally, we have c\u0303i,j = L if Bob prefers [0, ai,j ] to [ai,j , 1] and c\u0303i,j = R otherwise.\nWe show Properties 3-5 also hold for i+ 1 by considering the next three cases:\nCase ci,j = L for all j. In this case, the majority of Bob\u2019s answers is L at each cut point used by Alice. An illustration can be seen in Figure 13.\n(a) (b)\nCase ci,j = R for all j. In this case, the majority of Bob\u2019s answers is R at each cut point used by Alice. An illustration can be seen in Figure 14.\nThen the algorithm recurses in the interval [xi+1, yi+1] given by xi+1 = ai,3 and yi+1 = yi. By Lemma 1, we have c\u0303i,j = ci,j for each of j \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nWe claim that mB \u2208 (ai,4, yi]. To see this, consider two cases:\n\u2022 Case c\u0303i,5 = ci,5: then mB \u2208 [ai,5, yi] since the majority answers are consistent with Bob\u2019s true preference.\n\u2022 Case c\u0303i,5 \u0338= ci,5: then mB \u2208 (ai,4, yi) by Lemma 1.\nThen mB \u2208 (ai,4, yi] \u2282 [xi+1, yi+1], which proves Property 3 for i+ 1.\nSince mB \u2208 (ai,4, yi], we have\nVB([xi+1,mB]) \u2265 VB([ai,3, ai,4]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T ,\nand so Property 4 holds for i+ 1.\nIf yi+1 = 1, then Property 5 vacuously follows. Otherwise, we have yi+1 = yi. Then by the inductive hypothesis we obtain VB([mB, yi+1]) = VB([mB, yi]) > r \u221a f(T )/T . Thus Property 5 holds for i+ 1 as well.\nCase where there is a transition from R to L and the last R is ci,k for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , 4}. An illustration can be seen in Figure 15.\nIn this case, Alice recurses on the interval [xi+1, yi+1] given by xi+1 = ai,k\u22121 and yi+1 = ai,k+2.\nIf any of the ci,j differ from the c\u0303i,j , it must be ci,k or ci,k+1 because otherwise Bob\u2019s true preferences would alternate between R and L more than once, which is impossible. We consider three sub-cases:\n1. Case c\u0303i,k \u0338= ci,k. Each time Bob picked his less-preferred piece when Alice cut at ai,k, he lost 2VB(Intv[ai,k,mB]) in value compared to his regret benchmark. Since c\u0303i,k \u0338= ci,k,\nhe did so at least 12 \u221a\nf(T ) \u00b7 T times. In order to have regret at most rf(T ), he must have\nVB(Intv[ai,k,mB]) \u2264 r \u221a f(T )\nT . (12)\nBy Lemma 1, we have\nmB \u2208 (ai,k\u22121, ai,k+1) (13)\nand\nVB([ai,k\u22121, ai,k]) > 2r\n\u221a f(T )\nT . (14)\nCombining equations (12), (13), and (14) we obtain\nVB([xi+1,mB]) = VB([ai,k\u22121,mB]) (Since xi+1 = ai,k\u22121)\n\u2265 VB([ai,k\u22121, ai,k])\u2212 VB(Intv[ai,k,mB]) (Since mB > ai,k\u22121 by (13)) > r \u221a f(T )/T . (By (12) and (14))\nThus VB([xi+1,mB]) > r \u221a f(T )/T , so Property 4 holds for i+ 1.\nSince mB \u2208 (ai,k\u22121, ai,k+1), we have VB([mB, yi+1]) \u2265 VB([ai,k+1, ai,k+2]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T , proving Property 5 for i+ 1.\n2. Case c\u0303i,k+1 \u0338= ci,k+1. Each time Bob picked his less-preferred piece when Alice cut at ai,k+1, he lost 2VB(Intv[ai,k+1,mB]) in value compared to his regret benchmark. Since c\u0303i,k+1 \u0338= ci,k+1, he did so at least 12 \u221a f(T ) \u00b7 T times. In order to have regret at most\nrf(T ), he must have\nVB(Intv[ai,k+1,mB]) \u2264 r \u221a f(T )\nT . (15)\nBy Lemma 1, we have\nmB \u2208 (ai,k, ai,k+2) (16)\nand\nVB([ai,k, ai,k+1]) > 2r\n\u221a f(T )\nT . (17)\nCombining equations (15), (16), and (17) we obtain\nVB([mB, yi+1]) = VB([mB, ai,k+2]) (Since yi+1 = ai,k+2)\n\u2265 VB([ai,k+1, ai,k+2])\u2212 VB(Intv[ai,k+1,mB]) (Since mB < ai,k+2 by (16))\n> r \u221a f(T )/T . (By (15) and (17))\nThus VB([mB, yi+1]) > r \u221a f(T )/T , so Property 5 holds for i+ 1.\nSince mB \u2208 (ai,k, ai,k+2), we have VB([xi+1,mB]) \u2265 VB([ai,k\u22121, ai,k]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T , which proves Property 4 for i+ 1.\n3. Case c\u0303i,j = ci,j for all j \u2208 [5]. Then mB \u2208 [ai,k, ai,k+1]. By Lemma 1, we have\nVB([xi,mB]) \u2265 VB([xi, ai,k]) = VB([ai,k\u22121, ai,k]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T (18)\nand\nVB([mB, yi]) \u2265 VB([ai,k+1, yi]) = VB([ai,k+1, ai,k+2]) > 2r \u221a f(T )/T . (19)\nInequality (18) implies Property 4 for i+1, while inequality (19) implies Property 5 for i+ 1.\nIn all three cases, mB \u2208 [ai,k\u22121, ai,k+2] = [xi+1, yi+1], showing Property 3 for i+ 1.\nThus, in all three cases, Properties 3-5 hold for i+1. By induction, they hold for all i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n}. This completes the proof.\nProposition 5. Let vA be an arbitrary Alice density and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). Then there exists a value density function v\u0303B = v\u0303B(vA) and strategy S\u0303B = S\u0303B(vA, \u03b1) that ensures Bob\u2019s regret is O(T \u03b1)\nwhile Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) .\nProof. At a high level, the Bob we construct will behave as if his midpoint were at mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 . If Alice calls his bluff, i.e. cuts close to mB \u201cenough\u201d times, then Bob reverts to being honest by actually selecting his preferred piece.\nFormally, let y be an arbitrary point such that y > mA. Define the Bob value density v\u0303B as follows:\nv\u0303B(x) =\n{ 1 2y \u2200x \u2208 [0, y]\n1 2(1\u2212y) \u2200x \u2208 (y, 1] .\n(20)\nBob\u2019s value density v\u0303B is bounded since y is a fixed constant. Moreover, Bob\u2019s midpoint mB is exactly at y. Let S\u0303B be Bob\u2019s strategy as defined in Figure 16.\nStrategy S\u0303B ensures that Bob takes his less-favorite piece at most T \u03b1+1 2 times, and this only\nhappens when Alice cuts in the interval\nP = [mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ,mB] . (21)\nSince the density v\u0303B is bounded from above by a constant, Bob gives up a value of at most O(T \u03b1\u22121 2 ) in each such round. Thus Bob\u2019s regret is O(T\u03b1). Now let us compute Alice\u2019s regret with respect to her Stackelberg value. Suppose that T is sufficiently large, so that mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 > mA. There are two cases depending on whether Alice triggers the switch in Bob\u2019s strategy or not.\n\u2022 Alice cuts in P at least T \u03b1+1 2 times. Consider the first T \u03b1+1 2 times Alice cuts in P . Whenever\nAlice cuts at some point x \u2208 P , her utility will be VA([x, 1]) since Bob plays L. Therefore, her payoff in that round is maximized when x is minimized, which occurs at the left-hand endpoint x = mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 . However,\nmB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 > mA,\nand so\nVA ([ mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 , 1 ]) < 1/2 . (22)\nThen her Stackelberg regret over all the rounds in which she cuts in P is at least\nT \u03b1+1 2 \u00b7 ( VA([0,mB])\u2212 VA ([ mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 , 1 ])) > T \u03b1+1 2 \u00b7 ( VA([0,mA]) + VA([mA,mB])\u2212 1\n2 ) = T \u03b1+1 2 VA([mA,mB]) \u2208 \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) .\n\u2022 Alice cuts in P fewer than T \u03b1+1 2 times. In this case, we will show that Alice\u2019s payoff per\nround cannot be more than VA ([ 0,mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ]) . To see this, we consider two sub-cases.\nIf Alice cuts at a point x < mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 , then Bob picks R and Alice\u2019s utility in that round is\nVA([0, x]) < VA ([ 0,mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ]) . (23)\nIf Alice cuts at a point x \u2265 mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 , then Bob picks L and Alice\u2019s utility in that round is\nVA([x, 1]) < 1\n2 < VA\n([ 0,mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ]) . (24)\nCombining (23) and (24), we obtain that in each round t \u2208 [T ], Alice\u2019s utility is utA \u2264 VA ([ 0,mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ]) . (25)\nSumming over all rounds t \u2208 [T ], we obtain that Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is T\u2211 t=1 ( u\u2217A \u2212 utA ) \u2265 T\u2211 t=1 ( VA([0,mB])\u2212 VA ([ 0,mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ])) (26)\n= T\u2211 t=1 VA ([ mB \u2212 T \u03b1\u22121 2 ,mB ]) (27)\n\u2265 T\u2211 t=1 \u03b4 \u00b7 T \u03b1\u22121 2 \u2208 \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) . (28)\nThus in both cases, Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is at least \u2126 ( T \u03b1+1 2 ) , which concludes the proof.\nLemma 3. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1). Suppose Alice\u2019s density is vA and her strategy is SA. There exists a Bob Bob1 = (vB,1, SB,1) that depends on vA and a Bob Bob2 = (vB,2, SB,2) that depends on vA and SA, such that\n\u2022 Bob1 has regret O(T\u03b1) (i.e. strategy SB,1 ensures that a player with density vB,1 has regret O(T\u03b1))\n\u2022 Bob2 has regret O(T \u03b2); and\n\u2022 if SA ensures Alice Stackelberg regret of O(T \u03b2) against Bob1, then SA has regret at least T/6 against Bob2.\nProof. Let x be the cake position such that VA([0, x]) = 2/3, and let y be the cake position such that VA([0, y]) = 5/6. The first Bob, Bob1, will have a valuation function vB,1 that has midpoint x. We define Bob1\u2019s strategy SB,1 so that it truthfully picks his preferred piece, i.e.,\nSB,1(At, Bt\u22121) = { L if at \u2208 (x, 1] R if at \u2208 [0, x] .\n(29)\nAgainst Bob1, Alice\u2019s Stackelberg value is 2/3. Suppose SA ensures Alice Stackelberg regret at most rT \u03b2 against Bob1 for some r > 0.\nThen we define our second Bob, denoted Bob2, having a valuation function vB,2 which has a midpoint at y. Let k(t) be the number of times Alice cuts in the interval (x, y] in rounds {1, . . . , t}. Then Bob2\u2019s strategy will be defined as follows:\nSB,2(At, Bt\u22121) =  SB,1(At, Bt\u22121) if k(t) \u2264 3rT \u03b2\nL if k(t) > 3rT \u03b2 and at \u2208 (y, 1] R if k(t) > 3rT \u03b2 and at \u2208 [0, y] .\n(30)\nIntuitively, SB,2 switches to being honest after Alice cuts in (x, y] sufficiently many times. This transition gives Bob2 a regret guarantee of O(T \u03b2).\nWhen Alice plays SA against Bob1, her total payoff is\nuA(SA, SB,1) \u2265 2T/3\u2212 rT \u03b2 . (31)\nHowever, every round she cuts in (x, y], her payoff is less than 1/3. Therefore, against Bob1, her total payoff can also be bounded by\nuA(SA, SB,1) \u2264 2T/3\u2212 k(T )/3 . (32)\nCombining inequalities (31) and (32), we obtain\nk(T ) \u2264 3rT \u03b2. (33)\nBy definition, strategy SB,2 behaves the same as strategy SB,1 when k(T ) \u2264 3rT \u03b2. By (33), we have k(T ) \u2264 3rT \u03b2 when Alice uses strategy SA. Thus, if Alice uses strategy SA, then Bob1 and Bob2 behave exactly the same way. Therefore, Alice receives no more than 2/3 per round against Bob2, so her regret is at least T/6 \u2208 \u2126(T ).\nIf Bob\u2019s density is not lower bounded by any constant, then Theorem 1 fails as shown in the next remark.\nRemark 1. Let \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). There exist value densities vA and vB, where vA(x) \u2208 [\u03b4,\u2206] \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1] and vB(x) \u2208 (0,\u2206] \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1] such that Bob has a strategy SB which guarantees his regret is at most T\u03b1 and Alice\u2019s Stackelberg regret is at least \u2126(T/ log T ), no matter what strategy she uses.\nProof. The specific valuations will be defined in terms of cumulative valuations. Let Alice\u2019s valuation be:\nVA([0, x]) = { 1 2x if x \u2208 [0, 1/2] 3 2x\u2212 1 2 if x \u2208 (1/2, 1]\nLet Bob\u2019s valuation be:\nVB([0, x]) = { x if x \u2208 [0, 1/2] 1 2 + 2 \u2212 1 2x\u22121 if x \u2208 (1/2, 1]\n(34)\nIntuitively, Alice has a well-behaved piecewise uniform density with midpoint mA = 2/3. Bob\u2019s density is well-behaved for x \u2264 1/2, but the density rapidly approaches zero just to the right of x = 1/2.\nFix an arbitrary \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). There exists a point y on the cake such that VB([1/2, y]) = 12T \u03b1\u22121.\nDefine Bob\u2019s strategy SB as follows:\nSB(At, Bt\u22121, vB, T ) =\n{ R if at < y\nL if at \u2265 y .\nThis strategy would be honest if Bob\u2019s midpoint were at y rather than 1/2. That means it only differs from his preferred piece when at \u2208 (1/2, y]. The worst outcome for Bob occurs when at = y. But by construction, even in a round where Alice cuts at y, Bob only loses T\u03b1\u22121 utility compared to picking his preferred piece. Since there are T rounds, his overall regret is at most T\u03b1.\nAlice, on the other hand, cannot do very well compared to her Stackelberg value. Her Stackelberg value is 3/4, achieved by cutting at Bob\u2019s midpoint of 1/2 and receiving her preferred piece. But Bob prevents this payoff by pretending his midpoint is at y. To obtain the exact location of y, note that\nVB([1/2, y]) = 1 2 T\u03b1\u22121.\nPlugging (34), this is equivalent to\n2 \u2212 1 2y\u22121 = 1\n2 T\u03b1\u22121.\nSolving for y, we have\ny = 1\n2 +\n1\n(2\u2212 2\u03b1) log2 T + 2 .\nFor sufficiently large T , we have y \u2208 (mB,mA). Alice\u2019s best cut location in each round is then at y itself, which gives her a per-round payoff of\nVA([y, 1]) = 3 4 \u2212 3 (4\u2212 4\u03b1) log2 T + 4 .\nAdding this up over all T rounds gives a total regret of at least, we obtain\n3T\n(4\u2212 4\u03b1) log2 T + 4 ,\nwhich is \u2126(T/ log T ) as required. This completes the proof."

In Appendix B.2, we prove Theorem 3, which shows that Bob can enforce equitable payoffs.\nB.1 Appendix: Alice enforcing equitable payoffs\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2, the statement of which is included next.\nRestatement of Theorem 2 (Alice enforcing equitable payoffs; formal). In both the sequential and simultaneous settings, Alice has a pure strategy SA, such that for every Bob strategy SB:\n\u2022 on every trajectory of play, Alice\u2019s average payoff is at least 1/2\u2212 o(1), while Bob\u2019s average payoff is at most 1/2 + o(1).

We first define some notations.\nDefinition 4 (Set of valuationsWn). For each n \u2208 N\u2217, we define the following set of non-decreasing piecewise linear functions with n pieces:\nWn = { f : [0, 1]\u2192 [0, 1] | f is non-decreasing with f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(i/n) \u00b7 n \u2208 Z\u22650, and\nf(x) = f ( i n ) + ( x\u2212 i n )( f ( i+ 1 n ) \u2212 f ( i n )) \u2200i \u2208 {0, . . . , n\u2212 1} \u2200x \u2208 [ i n , i+ 1 n ]} .\nDefinition 5 (Set of functions Vn). For each n \u2208 N\u2217, recall Wn was given in Definition 4 and define Vn as the following set of functions:\nVn = { Wn if n \u0338= 2 W2 \u222a {fA} if n = 2, where fA : [0, 1]\u2192 [0, 1] is the function fA(x) = VA([0, x]).\nDefinition 6 (The set V). Let V = \u22c3\u221e\nn=1 {(n, V ) : V \u2208 Vn} , where Vn is given by Definition 5.\nRemark 2. By construction, for each n \u2208 N\u2217, every function f \u2208 Vn is non-decreasing.\nFor each n \u2208 N\u2217, Wn contains the nondecreasing piecewise linear functions through a grid with spacing 1/n. For large n, then, Wn should contain approximations to any given function accurate to roughly O(1/n).\nIf Alice bases her strategy on limiting the payoff of the Bobs in each Wn, then she will limit Bob\u2019s payoff but not necessarily guarantee herself a very good payoff. The inclusion of Alice\u2019s valuation function in V rectifies this, allowing us to show a much tighter bound on Alice\u2019s payoff.\nTo formalize the ability of the elements of the Vn to approximate arbitrary valuation functions, we prove the following three lemmas. The first of them (Lemma 4) is somewhat technical, but most directly shows the richness of the Vn. It will be used to prove Lemmas 5 and 6, which will be used directly to bound the payoff of an unbounded-density and bounded-density Bob, respectively.\nLemma 4. Let f : [0, 1]\u2192 [0, 1] be continuous and increasing with f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Suppose there exist n \u2208 N\u2217 and \u03b5 \u2208 (0,\u221e) such that\n|f(x)\u2212 f(y)| \u2264 \u03b5 \u2200x, y \u2208 [0, 1] with |x\u2212 y| \u2264 1/n . (37)\nThen there exists Vn \u2208 Vn, where Vn is the set of functions from Definition 5, such that |f(x)\u2212 Vn(x)| \u2264 \u03b5+ 2/n \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1].\nProof. For x \u2208 R, let \u230ax\u2309 denote the nearest integer to x, breaking ties in favor of \u2308x\u2309 when x = \u230ax\u230b+ 1/2.\nRecall the set of functions Wn from Definition 4. Let Vn be the function in Wn such that:\nVn(i/n) = \u230an \u00b7 f(i/n)\u2309\nn \u2200i \u2208 [n\u2212 1] . (38)\nThen we claim the function Vn approximates well the function f at the points i/n, that is: |Vn(i/n)\u2212 f(i/n)| = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u230an \u00b7 f(i/n)\u2309n \u2212 f(i/n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 12n \u2200i \u2208 {0, . . . , n}, (39) where for i \u2208 [n\u2212 1] the inequality in (39) follows from (38), for i = 0 it follows from Vn(0) =\n0 = f(0), and for i = n it follows from Vn(1) = 1 = f(1).\nLet x \u2208 [0, 1]. We show three inequalities next:\n1. By inequality (37) from the lemma statement with parameters \u230axn\u230b/n and \u2308xn\u2309/n, we get\nf ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) \u2212 f ( \u230axn\u230b n ) \u2264 \u03b5 . (40)\n2. By inequality (39) with i = \u2308xn\u2309, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Vn(\u2308xn\u2309n ) \u2212 f ( \u2308xn\u2309 n )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 12n . (41) 3. By inequality (39) with i = \u230axn\u230b, we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223f (\u230axn\u230bn ) \u2212 Vn ( \u230axn\u230b n\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 12n . (42) Summing up inequalities (40), (41), (42) and applying the triangle inequality, we obtain\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Vn(\u2308xn\u2309n ) \u2212 Vn ( \u230axn\u230b n\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03b5+ 1n . (43) We obtain\nVn ( \u230axn\u230b n ) \u2212 1 2n \u2264 f ( \u230axn\u230b n ) (By (39) with i = \u230axn\u230b)\n\u2264 f(x) (Since f is non-decreasing) \u2264 f ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) (Since f is non-decreasing)\n\u2264 Vn ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) + 1 2n . (By (39) with i = \u2308xn\u2309)\nDenoting J = [ Vn ( \u230axn\u230b\nn\n) \u2212 1/(2n), Vn ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) + 1/(2n) ] , we conclude that f(x) \u2208 J . Since the\nfunction Vn is non-decreasing by Remark 2, we have\nVn ( \u230axn\u230b n ) \u2212 1 2n \u2264 Vn (x)\u2212 1 2n < Vn(x) < Vn(x) + 1 2n \u2264 Vn ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) + 1 2n . (44)\nThus Vn(x) \u2208 J . Since both f(x) \u2208 J and Vn(x) \u2208 J , we can bound |f(x)\u2212 Vn(x)| as follows:\n|f(x)\u2212 Vn(x)| \u2264 |J |\n= ( Vn ( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) + 1 2n ) \u2212 ( Vn ( \u230axn\u230b n ) \u2212 1 2n ) \u2264 \u03b5+ 2\nn . (Since Vn\n( \u2308xn\u2309 n ) \u2212 Vn ( \u230axn\u230b n ) \u2264 \u03b5+ 1/n by (43))\nSince this holds for all x \u2208 [0, 1], the function Vn required by the lemma exists.\nLemma 5. Let f : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] be continuous and increasing with f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. For each \u03b5 > 0, there exists n \u2208 N\u2217 and a function Vn \u2208 Vn such that\n|Vn(x)\u2212 f(x)| \u2264 \u03b5 \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1], (45)\nrecalling that the set of functions Vn is given by Definition 5.\nProof. Let \u03f5 > 0. Since f is continuous and increasing, its inverse f\u22121 is also continuous and increasing. Since f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1, we have f\u22121(0) = 0 and f\u22121(1) = 1. Consider a function g : [0, 1\u2212 \u03b5/4]\u2192 [0, 1] defined as\ng(x) = f\u22121 (x+ \u03b5/4)\u2212 f\u22121(x) . (46)\nSince f\u22121 is continuous and bounded over a closed interval, so is the function g. Therefore, by the extreme value theorem, g attains a global minimum value \u03b4\u2217. Since f\u22121 is strictly increasing, g is never zero, so\n\u03b4\u2217 > 0 . (47)\nSince we will analyze g(f(x)), it will be useful to define the set of values x for which g(f(x)) is well defined, that is:\nS\u03b5 = {x \u2208 [0, 1] | f(x) \u2208 [0, 1\u2212 \u03b5/4]} . (48)\nSince \u03b4\u2217 is a global minimum of g, we have\ng(f(x)) \u2265 \u03b4\u2217 \u2200x \u2208 S\u03b5 . (49)\nUsing the definition of g (equation (46)) in (49) yields\ng(f(x)) = f\u22121 (f(x) + \u03b5/4)\u2212 f\u22121(f(x)) \u2265 \u03b4\u2217 \u2200x \u2208 S\u03b5 . (50)\nSince f\u22121(f(x)) = x, inequality (50) yields f\u22121 (f(x) + \u03b5/4)\u2212 x \u2265 \u03b4\u2217, or equivalently,\nf\u22121 (f(x) + \u03b5/4) \u2265 x+ \u03b4\u2217 \u2200x \u2208 S\u03b5 . (51)\nApplying f to both sides of (51) and using monotonicity of f , we obtain f(x) + \u03b5/4 \u2265 f(x + \u03b4\u2217) for all x \u2208 S\u03b5, or equivalently\nf (x+ \u03b4\u2217)\u2212 f(x) \u2264 \u03b5/4 \u2200x \u2208 S\u03b5 . (52)\nSince \u03b5 > 0 and \u03b4\u2217 > 0 by (47), there exists n \u2208 N such that\nn > 1/\u03b4\u2217 and n > 4/\u03b5 . (53)\nNote that because the range of f\u22121 is [0, 1], the left side of (51) is at most 1. Therefore, from (51) and the fact that \u03b4\u2217 > 1/n by (53):\n1 \u2265 x+ \u03b4\u2217 > x+ 1/n \u2200x \u2208 S\u03b5 (54)\nConsider an arbitrary x, y \u2208 [0, 1] with x \u2264 y \u2264 x+ 1/n. We consider two cases:\n\u2022 Case x \u2208 S\u03b5: Since f is strictly increasing and x+ \u03b4\u2217 \u2264 1 by (54), we have:\nf(y) \u2264 f(x+ 1/n) < f(x+ \u03b4\u2217) (55)\nSubtracting f(x) from both sides of (55) and applying (52), we obtain\nf(y)\u2212 f(x) < \u03b5/4 (56)\n\u2022 Case x \u0338\u2208 S\u03b5: Then f(x) > 1\u2212 \u03b5/4. Since f(y) \u2264 1, we have:\nf(y)\u2212 f(x) < 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b5/4) = \u03b5/4 . (57)\nCombining cases x \u2208 S\u03b5 and x \u0338\u2208 S\u03b5 gives f(y)\u2212f(x) < \u03b5/4 \u2200x, y \u2208 [0, 1] with x \u2264 y \u2264 x+1/n . Since f is strictly increasing, we have f(x) \u2264 f(y) when x \u2264 y, and so\n|f(x)\u2212 f(y)| < \u03b5/4 \u2200x, y \u2208 [0, 1] with |x\u2212 y| \u2264 1/n . (58)\nBy Lemma 4, there exists a function Vn \u2208 Vn such that:\n|f(x)\u2212 Vn(x)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 + 2/n \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1] . (59)\nSince n > 4/\u03b5 by (53), inequality (59) gives\n|f(x)\u2212 Vn(x)| \u2264 \u03b5/4 + 2/n < \u03b5/4 + \u03b5/2 < \u03b5 \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1] . (60)\nThis completes the proof.\nLemma 6. Suppose vB is a value density function for Bob with vB(x) \u2264 \u2206 for some \u2206 > 0 and all x \u2208 [0, 1]. Then for all n \u2208 N\u2217, there exists a function Vn \u2208 Vn such that\u2223\u2223\u2223Vn(x)\u2212 VB([0, x])\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2206+ 2\nn \u2200x \u2208 [0, 1] .\nProof. Let n \u2208 N\u2217. Since Bob\u2019s density is upper bounded by \u2206, we have\n|VB([0, x])\u2212 VB([0, y])| \u2264 \u2206|x\u2212 y| \u2200x, y \u2208 [0, 1] . (61)\nWhen |x\u2212 y| \u2264 1/n, we get |VB([0, x])\u2212 VB([0, y])| \u2264 \u2206|x\u2212 y| \u2264 D/n. By Lemma 4 applied to the function f : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] given by f(x) = VB([0, x]), there exists\nVn \u2208 Vn with |Vn(x)\u2212 VB([0, x])| \u2264 \u2206/n+ 2/n for all x \u2208 [0, 1] . This completes the proof.\nThe set of functions Vn will be used to construct a strategy for Alice. The rate of growth of the size of the set |Vn| as a function of n will influence the error bounds on the utilities of the players. Next we bound the size of the set Vn.\nLemma 7. |Vn| \u2264 4n\u22121 \u2200n \u2208 N\u2217.\nProof. We first estimate the size of each set Wn, and then will infer the bound for the size of Vn. Consider the density function corresponding to any particular V \u2208 Wn. Because V is piecewise linear, its density is piecewise constant. Each V is then uniquely determined by a sequence d1, d2, . . . , dn, where di is the value density between i\u22121 n and i n . Each di must be a non-negative integer, because each of these intervals has width 1/n and sees V rise by an integer multiple of 1/n. More strongly, because V (0) = 0 and V (1) = 1, we must have the next relation between the di\u2019s:\nn\u2211 i=1 di n = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 n\u2211 i=1 di = n . (62)\nThus, the size |Wn| is the number of possible partitions of n into n parts with nonnegative integer sizes. The size of Wn can then be counted by a standard combinatorics technique. Represent each choice of d1, d2, . . . , dn with a sequence of n \u201cstars\u201d and n\u2212 1 \u201cbars\u201d: d1 stars, then a bar, then d2 stars, then another bar, and so on. Each choice of d1, . . . , dn corresponds to a unique arrangement of stars and bars. The opposite is also true: given an arrangement, the number of stars between each pair of bars can be read off as d1, . . . , dn. The size of Vn is then the number of arrangements, which is ( 2n\u22121 n ) .\nThe upper bound can then be shown by induction. As a base case, ( 2\u00b71\u22121\n1 ) = ( 1 1 ) = 1 \u2264 41\u22121.\nNow assume ( 2n\u22121 n ) \u2264 4n\u22121 for an arbitrary n \u2265 1. We have(\n2(n+ 1)\u2212 1 n+ 1\n) = (2n+ 1)!\n(n+ 1)! \u00b7 n! = (2n\u2212 1)! \u00b7 2n \u00b7 (2n+ 1) n! \u00b7 (n\u2212 1)! \u00b7 n(n+ 1) =\n( 2n\u2212 1\nn\n) \u00b7 2n(2n+ 1)\nn(n+ 1)\n\u2264 4n\u22121 \u00b7 4 n+ 12 n+ 1\n(By the inductive hypothesis)\n\u2264 4n\u22121 \u00b7 4 = 4(n+1)\u22121\nSo by induction, the bound holds for all n \u2265 1. Because Vn = Wn for all n \u0338= 2, the only case left to verify is n = 2. By calculation, |W2| =(\n3 2 ) = 3, so including the extra function makes |V2| = 4 = 42\u22121.\nSome other technical lemmas are necessary. The first two relate to the following function, which acts like an infinite-dimensional inner product.\nDefinition 7. Let X be the collection of all functions X : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1]. For functions X,Y : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1], define a function P : X \u00d7 X \u2192 R as follows:\nP (X,Y ) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n |Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V ) .\nLemma 8. The function P has the properties of an inner product. In particular, for all functions X,Y, Z : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1] and all constants c \u2208 [\u22121, 1], the following holds:\n(1) P (X,Y ) exists, and the infinite sum converges absolutely\n(2) P (X,Y ) = P (Y,X)\n(3) |P (X,Y )| \u2264 1\n(4) P (cX, Y ) = cP (X,Y )\n(5) P (X + Z, Y ) = P (X,Y ) + P (Z, Y ), assuming X + Z is in the domain of P\n(6) P (X,X) = 0 if X(n, V ) = 0 for all n and all V , and P (X,X) > 0 otherwise\nProof. We separately prove each of the properties. For the first property, note that the individual terms go to zero\nlim n\u2192\u221e \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 12n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 limn\u2192\u221e 12n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn |X(n, V )Y (n, V )|\n\u2264 lim n\u2192\u221e\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn 1 (By the bounds on X and Y )\n= lim n\u2192\u221e\n1\n2n|Vn| |Vn| = lim n\u2192\u221e\n1\n2n\n= 0 .\nUsing the above upper bound for individual terms, the sum of the absolute values does not diverge as follows\n\u221e\u2211 n=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 12n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u221e\u2211 n=1 1 2n = 1 .\nSo P (X,Y ) exists and the infinite sum converges absolutely. The existence is enough for property (2), which follows directly from the productX(n, V )Y (n, V ) being commutative. This calculation directly verifies property (3). The absolute convergence allows for the linear operations in properties (4) and (5) to factor through the sum. First, for property (4) we obtain\nP (cX, Y ) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn cX(n, V )Y (n, V )\n= c \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V )\n= cP (A,B) .\nFor property (5) observe that:\nP (X + Z, Y ) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn (X(n, V ) + Z(n, V ))Y (n, V )\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V ) + Z(n, V )Y (n, V )\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )Y (n, V ) + \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn Z(n, V )Y (n, V )\n= P (X,Y ) + P (Z, Y ) .\nFor property (6), observe that the expression can be rewritten as:\nP (X,X) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V )2 .\nThis is a sum of squares, which will be zero if all the included X(n, V ) are zero and positive otherwise.\nLemma 9. For each x \u2208 [0, 1], let Gx : V \u2192 [\u22121/2,\u22121/2] be a function defined by Gx(n, V ) = V (x)\u2212 12 . Then, for any Z : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1], the following function is continuous in x:\nP (Gx, Z) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( V (x)\u2212 1 2 ) Z(n, V ).\nProof. Alice\u2019s valuation function in V2 needs to be handled separately. Accordingly, write:\nP (Gx, Z) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( V (x)\u2212 1 2 ) Z(n, V )\n= 1\n22|V2|\n( VA([0, x])\u2212 1\n2\n) Z(n, VA) + \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Wn\n( V (x)\u2212 1\n2\n) Z(n, V ) .\nAs long as each of these two parts is continuous, the sum will be too. The first part is continuous because VA([0, x]) is continuous. To prove the second part, for notational simplicity, define\nP \u2032(Gx, Z) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Wn\n( V (x)\u2212 1\n2\n) Z(n, V )\nThe continuity of P \u2032 will be shown by directly appealing to the definition of a limit. First, note that each V \u2208 Wn is made of n linear segments, each of width 1n and height at most 1. Therefore, if V \u2208 Wn, for all x, y \u2208 [0, 1]:\n|V (y)\u2212 V (x)| \u2264 |y \u2212 x|n (63)\nFix an arbitrary \u03b5 > 0 and x \u2208 [0, 1]. Choose \u03b4 = \u03b5/2. For any y such that |y \u2212 x| < \u03b4:\u2223\u2223P \u2032(Gy, Z)\u2212 P \u2032(Gx, Z)\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223P \u2032(Gy \u2212Gx, Z)\u2223\u2223 (By property (5)) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Wn\n(V (y)\u2212 V (x))Z(n, V ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264\n\u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Wn\n|V (y)\u2212 V (x)| \u00b7 |Z(n, V )| (Triangle inequality)\n\u2264 \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Wn\nn|y \u2212 x| \u00b7 1 (By ineq (63) and Z \u2264 1)\n\u2264 |y \u2212 x| \u221e\u2211 n=1 n 2n (Since |Wn| \u2264 |Vn|) = |y \u2212 x| \u00b7 2 < 2\u03b4 (By choice of \u03b4)\n= \u03b5 .\nTherefore, for all x \u2208 [0, 1]: lim y\u2192x P \u2032(Gy, Z) = P \u2032(Gx, Z),\nwhich is the definition of P \u2032(Gx, Z) being continuous in x. This concludes that P (Gx, Z) is continuous in x.\nFinally, the last one is a strengthening of Lemma 1 from [Bla56], under a stronger hypotheses.\nLemma 10. Suppose a sequence of nonnegative values \u03b41, \u03b42, . . . satisfies, for all t \u2265 1:\n\u03b4t+1 \u2264 1\n(t+ 1)2 + ( t\u2212 1 t+ 1 ) \u03b4t .\nThen limt\u2192\u221e \u03b4t = 0. In particular, for all t \u2265 2:\n\u03b4t \u2264 1\nt(t\u2212 1) t\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i \u2264 1 t .\nProof. The latter bound will be shown by induction. As a base case, consider t = 2. The condition for t = 1 gives:\n\u03b42 \u2264 1\n(1 + 1)2 + ( 1\u2212 1 1 + 1 ) \u03b41 = 1 4 =\n1\n2(2\u2212 1) 2\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i . (64)\nSo the base case holds. Now suppose the conclusion holds for some t \u2265 2. Assume that the claim holds for \u03b4t. We can expand the upper bound of \u03b4t+1 as follows.\n\u03b4t+1 \u2264 1\n(t+ 1)2 + ( t\u2212 1 t+ 1 ) \u03b4t (65)\n\u2264 1 (t+ 1)2 + ( t\u2212 1 t+ 1 ) 1 t(t\u2212 1) t\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i\n(By the induction hypothesis)\n= 1\n(t+ 1)2 +\n1\nt(t+ 1) t\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i\n(66)\n= 1\n(t+ 1)t t+1\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i . (67)\nNow it suffices to show that the last term in (67) is upper bounded by 1/t, which follows from the following inequality:\n1\nt(t\u2212 1) t\u2211 i=2 i\u2212 1 i \u2264 1 t(t\u2212 1) t\u2211 i=2 1 = 1 t(t\u2212 1) \u00b7 (t\u2212 1) = 1 t . (68)\nThus \u03b4t+1 \u2264 1/t, which completes the proof.\nNow the groundwork is laid to prove Theorem 2. The idea is to limit every strategy and every valuation in every Vn to an average payoff of 1/2, which is sufficient to limit Bob equipped with arbitrary valuation as well.\nProof of Theorem 2. We first define the Alice\u2019s strategy in an analytical manner, and then prove that it is well-defined. Then we will show that this strategy will force Bob\u2019s payoff to be at most 1/2 on average, by showing both that Bob\u2019s valuation can be well-approximated by functions in V and that such valuation functions are limited to a payoff of 1/2 on average. Finally, we establish explicit convergence rates for Bob\u2019s payoff if his valuation is bounded, as well as the convergence of Alice\u2019s payoff to 1/2.\nDefining Alice\u2019s strategy SA Consider Alice\u2019s decision in round T . In each round t < T , let the payoff to Bob whose cumulative valuation function is V be ut,V . For each x \u2208 [0, 1], let Gx : V \u2192 [\u22121, 1] be a function defined as Gx(n, V ) = V (x) \u2212 1/2. Let Ut(n, V ) = ut,V \u2212 1/2 for t = 1, . . . , T \u2212 1, and let U t(n, V ) = \u2211t i=1 Ui(n, V )/t. Let Wt(n, V ) = max{0, U t(n, V )} for t = 1, . . . , T \u2212 1. In round T , Alice\u2019s strategy SA is to cut at a point x such that P (Gx,WT\u22121) = 0. We then show that SA is well-defined. It suffices to prove that such an x always exists. To this end, observe that\nP (G0,WT\u22121) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( V (0)\u2212 1 2 ) WT\u22121(n, V )\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn \u22121 2 WT\u22121(n, V )\n\u2264 \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn 0 (Since WT\u22121(\u00b7) is nonnegative)\n= 0 .\nUsing similar algebra for P (G1,WT\u22121), we obtain\nP (G1,WT\u22121) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( V (1)\u2212 1 2 ) WT\u22121(n, V )\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn 1 2 WT\u22121(n, V )\n\u2265 \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn 0 (Since WT\u22121(\u00b7) is nonnegative)\n= 0\nBy Lemma 9, P (Gx,WT\u22121) is continuous in x, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists x such that P (Gx,WT\u22121) = 0."

(69)\nFor t < T , let Yt : V \u2192 [\u22121/2, 1/2] be the function defined by:\nYt(n, V ) = min{0, U t(n, V )}\nBy Claim 3, we have \u03b4t \u2264 1/t for all t \u2265 2. Now we will show that this strategy guarantees that, for any Bob\u2019s valuation function vB and any strategy SB Bob employs, his average payoff is at most 1/2. Consider an arbitrary \u03b5 > 0. It will be shown that, for some sufficiently large T , Bob\u2019s average payoff up to any point after round T is at most 1/2 + \u03b5.\nIn the general case, this convergence can be established from Lemma 5. Consider N,T \u2208 N\u2217 such that\n\u2022 N is such that there exists V \u2032 \u2208 VN with |V \u2032(x)\u2212 VB([0, x])| < \u03b5/2 for all x \u2208 [0, 1].\n\u2022 T is sufficiently large so that\n\u03b4t < \u03b52\n4 \u00b7 2N |VN | \u2200t \u2265 T . (70)\nFor example, taking T = \u23084\u00b72N |VN |\n\u03b52\n\u2309 would suffice.\nWe will show that for each t \u2265 T , we have U t(N,V \u2032) < \u03b5/2. This trivially holds if U t(N,V \u2032) \u2264 0, so assume U t(N,V \u2032) > 0. We then obtain\nU t(N,V \u2032) = \u221a 2N |VN | \u00b7\n1\n2N |VN | U t(N,V \u2032)2\n= \u221a 2N |VN | \u00b7\n1 2N |VN | ( U t(N,V \u2032)\u2212 Yt(N,V \u2032) )2 , (71)\nwhere (71) follows from the fact that Yt(N,V \u2032) = min{0, U t(N,V \u2032)} = 0. Using (71), we can upper bound U t(N,V \u2032) as follows:\nU t(N,V \u2032) \u2264 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a2N |VN | \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( U t(n, V )\u2212 Yt(n, V ) )2 = \u221a 2N |VN |P (U t \u2212 Yt, U t \u2212 Yt)\n= \u221a 2N |VN |\u03b4t (72)\n< \u221a 2N |VN | \u00b7\n\u03b52\n4 \u00b7 2N |VN | =\n\u03b5 2 . (By (70))\nTherefore, we have U t(N,V \u2032) < \u03b5/2 for all t \u2265 T . Translating back into payoffs, this gives a Bob whose cumulative valuation function is V \u2032 an average payoff of less than 1/2 + \u03b5/2. By the choice of V \u2032, we have\n|V \u2032(x)\u2212 VB([0, x])| < \u03b5/2 for all x \u2208 [0, 1] . (73)\nso the average payoff to a Bob whose valuation function is vB is less than 1/2 + \u03b5. Since this construction works for all \u03b5 > 0, Bob\u2019s average payoff satisfies the following inequality as required:\nuB(1, t) t \u2264 1 2 + o(1) .\nExplicit bounds It remains to prove inequality (35) when Bob\u2019s density is upper bounded by \u2206, and prove Alice\u2019s explicit payoff in inequality (36). Choose an integer N large enough that\n\u2206 + 2\nN <\n\u03b5 2 .\nFor instance, taking N = \u23082(\u2206 + 2)/\u03b5\u2309 is sufficient. By Lemma 6, there exists V \u2032 \u2208 VN such that |V \u2032(x)\u2212VB([0, x])| < (\u2206+2)/N for all x \u2208 [0, 1]. Choose T in exactly the same way as the general case, i.e. T = \u23084 \u00b7 2N |VN |/\u03b52\u2309. By exactly the same algebra as the general case, we can conclude that U t(N,V \u2032) < \u03b5/2 for all t \u2265 T . By the choice of V \u2032, we have\n|V \u2032(x)\u2212 VB([0, x])| < \u03b5/2 for all x \u2208 [0, 1] , (74)\nso the average payoff to Bob is at most 12 + \u03b5.

(75)\nHence, for such T\u03b5, we have\nT\u03b5 \u2264 \u2308 4 \u00b7 2N \u00b7 4N\u22121\n\u03b52\n\u2309 .\nSince \u2308x\u2309 \u2264 2x for x \u2265 1/2, this implies\nT\u03b5 \u2264 2 8N\n\u03b52 .\nDue to our choice of N , we can further obtain\nT\u03b5 \u2264 2 8\n2(\u2206+2) \u03b5 +1\n\u03b52 . (76)\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides in (76), we have\nln(T\u03b5) \u2264 ln(16) + 2(\u2206 + 2)\n\u03b5 ln(8) + 2 ln\n( 1\n\u03b5\n) .\nUsing the fact that ln(x) \u2264 x\u2212 1 for every x > 0, it follows that\nln(T\u03b5) \u2264 ln(16) + 2(\u2206 + 2)\n\u03b5 ln(8) + 2\n( 1 \u03b5 \u2212 1 ) . (77)\nRearranging (77), we finally obtain\n\u03b5 \u2264 2 ln(8)(\u2206 + 2) + 2 ln(T\u03b5)\u2212 ln(16) + 2 .\nNote that this requires the step of dividing by ln(T\u03b5)\u2212 ln(16) + 2 and it needs this quantity to be positive, which is indeed positive for T \u2265 3. Rounding the terms gives the desired regret bound for Bob.\nTo provide Alice\u2019s payoff bound in inequality (36), consider a hypothetical Bob whose valuation function v\u0303B is exactly the same as Alice\u2019s valuation function vA. For all rounds \u03c4 , the payoff u\u0303 \u03c4 B to this Bob then satisfies:\nu\u03c4A + u\u0303 \u03c4 B = VA([0, a\u03c4 ]) + VA([a\u03c4 , 1]) (One player gets VA([0, a\u03c4 ]) and the other gets VA([a\u03c4 , 1]))\n= 1 (78)\nFor any t, summing u\u03c4A + u\u0303 \u03c4 B over \u03c4 \u2208 [t] and dividing by t then gives:\nuA(1, t)\nt +\nu\u0303B(1, t)\nt = 1 (79)\nSo it suffices to upper-bound this particular Bob\u2019s payoff to lower-bound Alice\u2019s payoff. Choose an arbitrary \u03b5 > 0. Let T\u03b5 = \u230822|V2|\n\u03b52\n\u2309 , ensuring \u03b4t < \u03b52\n22|V2| for all t \u2265 T\u03b5. By construction, Alice\u2019s valuation function VA([0, x]) \u2208 V2. Taking N = 2 and V \u2032 = VA, we can then use identical algebra as the general-Bob case up to (72) to conclude that, for t \u2265 T\u03b5:\nU t(2, VA) \u2264 \u221a 22|V2|\u03b4t (Copying over (72))\n< \u221a 22|V2| \u00b7 \u03b52\n22|V2| = \u03b5 (80)\nSo this Bob\u2019s payoff is upper-bounded by 1/2 + \u03b5, and so by (79) Alice\u2019s payoff is lower-bounded by 1/2\u2212 \u03b5. To solve for \u03b5, observe that T\u03b5 \u2264 16/\u03b52 + 1. Solving this bound on T\u03b5 for \u03b5 gives\n\u03b5 \u2264 4\u221a T\u03b5 \u2212 1 ,\nand it finishes the proof.\nWe finally provide the claims and their proofs used throughout the main proof.\nClaim 1. In the setting of Theorem 2, if U t /\u2208 S, then argminX\u2208S P (U t \u2212 X,U t \u2212 X) exists. Furthermore:\nargmin X\u2208S\nP (U t \u2212X,U t \u2212X) = Yt = min{0, U t(n, V )}\nProof of the claim. Let Yt = min{0, U t(n, V )} \u2208 S. For any X \u2208 S, P (U t \u2212X,U t \u2212X) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn ( U t(n, V )\u2212X(n, V ) )2\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1\n2n|Vn|  \u2211 V \u2208Vn\nUt(n,V )>0\n( U t(n, V )\u2212X(n, V ) )2 + \u2211 V \u2208Vn\nUt(n,V )\u22640\n( U t(n, V )\u2212X(n, V ) )2 \n(81)\nSince X \u2208 S, we have that X(n, V ) \u2264 0 for every n and V , due to our construction of S.\nTherefore, replacing them with 0 brings them closer to any positive value and so decreases the first sum of squares. The second sum of squares is nonnegative, so it can be reduced by replacing it with 0. Applying these simplifications, we obtain\n\u221e\u2211 n=1\n1\n2n|Vn|  \u2211 V \u2208Vn\nUt(n,V )>0\n( U t(n, V )\u2212X(n, V ) )2 + \u2211 V \u2208Vn\nUt(n,V )\u22640\n( U t(n, V )\u2212X(n, V ) )2 \n\u2265 \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1\n2n|Vn|  \u2211 V \u2208Vn\nUt(n,V )>0\n( U t(n, V )\u2212 0 )2 + 0  =D(U t \u2212 Yt, U t \u2212 Yt), (Only the U(n, V ) > 0 terms remain)\nand it proves the claim.\nClaim 2. In the setting of Theorem 2, the following properties hold when U t /\u2208 S.\n1. P (Yt,Wt) = 0\n2. P (Ut+1,Wt) = 0\n3. P (U t,Wt) > 0\n4. P (X,Wt) \u2264 0 for all X \u2208 S\nProof of the claim. All of these properties can be explained by expanding the dot product P and referring to the strategy SA. The first one is the most straightforward: Yt and Wt are never nonzero in the same coordinate, so P (Yt,Wt) = 0. For the second one, by definition, in round t + 1 Alice cuts at a point x such that P (Gx,Wt) = 0. If Bob selects the left piece, Ut+1 = Gx. If Bob instead selects the right piece:\nUt+1(n, V ) = (1\u2212 V (x))\u2212 1\n2\n= 1\n2 \u2212 V (x)\n= \u2212Gx(n, V ) .\nSo by property 4 of Lemma 8, we have P (Ut+1,Wt) = \u2212P (Gx,Wt) = 0. Because P is linear as per property 5 in Lemma 8, any mixed strategy over these outcomes must also satisfy P (Ut+1,Wt) = 0.\nFor part (3) of the lemma, expanding the dot product gives:\nP (X,Wt) = \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211 V \u2208Vn X(n, V ) \u00b7max{0, U t(n, V )}\n= \u221e\u2211 n=1\n1 2n|Vn| \u2211\nV \u2208Vn,Ut(n,V )>0\nX(n, V )U t(n, V ) .\nAs there exists (n, V ) such that U t(n, V ) > 0, this sum is strictly positive when X = U t(n, V ), and so P (U t,Wt) > 0. Similarly, for X \u2208 S, we have X(n, V ) \u2264 0 for all (n, V ), so P (X,Wt) \u2264 0.\nClaim 3. In the setting of Theorem 2, the sequence {\u03b4t}\u221et=1 defined in (69) satisfies the inequality \u03b4t \u2264 1/t for all t \u2265 2.\nProof. We will show that our construction of \u03b4t satisfies the recursion formula defined in Lemma 10. We first focus on the case such that \u03b4t > 0, which is equivalent to U t /\u2208 S, and then prove that it also holds for \u03b4t = 0. Given that \u03b4t > 0, we observe that\n\u03b4t+1 = inf X\u2208S\nP (U t+1 \u2212X,U t+1 \u2212X) \u2264 P (U t+1 \u2212 Yt, U t+1 \u2212 Yt) . (82)\nBy rewriting the right hand side of (82), we obtain\n\u03b4t+1 \u2264 P ((U t+1 \u2212 U t) + (U t \u2212 Yt), (U t+1 \u2212 U t) + (U t \u2212 Yt)) (83)\nDistributing over P in the expression on the right hand side of (83), we get that (83) is equivalent to\n\u03b4t+1 \u2264 P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t+1 \u2212 U t) + 2P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) + P (U t \u2212 Yt, U t \u2212 Yt) = P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t+1 \u2212 U t) + 2P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) + \u03b4t, (84)\nwhere the inequality follows from Claim 1. Noting that U t+1 \u2212 U t = (Ut+1 \u2212 U t)/(t+ 1), we have\nP (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) = 1\nt+ 1 P (Ut+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt)\n= 1\nt+ 1 P ((Ut+1 \u2212 Yt) + (Yt \u2212 U t), U t \u2212 Yt)\n= 1\nt+ 1\n( P (Ut+1 \u2212 Yt, U t \u2212 Yt) + P (Yt \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) ) .\nBy using U t = Wt + Yt, we can expand it by\nP (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) = 1\nt+ 1\n( P (Ut+1,Wt)\u2212 P (Yt,Wt)\u2212 P (Yt \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) ) .\n= 1\nt+ 1 (P (Ut+1,Wt)\u2212 P (Yt,Wt)\u2212 \u03b4t) (By Claim 1)\n= 1\nt+ 1 (0\u2212 0\u2212 \u03b4t) (By Claim 2)\n= \u2212 1 t+ 1 \u00b7 \u03b4t. (85)\nFurther, observe that\nP (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t+1 \u2212 U t) = 1\n(t+ 1)2 P (Ut+1 \u2212 U t, Ut+1 \u2212 U t)\n\u2264 1 (t+ 1)2 , (86)\nwhere the inequality follows from Property (3) in Lemma 8.\nPutting (84), (85) and (86) together, we obtain the following inequality for \u03b4t > 0:\n\u03b4t+1 \u2264 P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t+1 \u2212 U t) + 2P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t \u2212 Yt) + \u03b4t\n\u2264 1 (t+ 1)2 \u2212 2 t+ 1 \u03b4t + \u03b4t\n= 1\n(t+ 1)2 +\n( 1\u2212 2\nt+ 1\n) \u03b4t .\nNow, we show that the same inequality holds for the case such that \u03b4t = 0 too. Since U t \u2208 S, we obtain\n\u03b4t+1 = inf X\u2208S\nP (U t+1 \u2212X,U t+1 \u2212X)\n\u2264 P (U t+1 \u2212 U t, U t+1 \u2212 U t) \u2264 1 (t+ 1)2\n(By (86))\n= 1\n(t+ 1)2 +\n( 1\u2212 2\nt+ 1\n) \u03b4t.\nBy Lemma 10, we therefore have that \u03b4t \u2264 1/t for t \u2265 2."

            "text": "In this section, we prove Theorem 3, which shows how Bob can enforce equitable payoffs.\nRestatement of Theorem 3 (Bob enforcing equitable payoffs; formal).\n\u2022 In the sequential setting: Bob has a pure strategy SB, such that for every Alice strategy SA, on every trajectory of play, Bob\u2019s average payoff is at least 1/2\u2212 o(1), while Alice\u2019s average payoff is at most 1/2 + o(1).

Bob\u2019s strategy for the simultaneous setting follows from Proposition 6. His strategy for the sequential setting follows from Proposition 7.\nProposition 6. In the simultaneous setting, Bob has a mixed strategy SB such that, for every Alice strategy SA:\nE[uA] T = E[uB] T = 1 2 .\nProof. Bob\u2019s strategy is very simple: in each round, randomly pick L or R with equal probability.\nTo analyze the expected payoffs, consider an arbitrary player i \u2208 {A,B} and arbitrary round t. Bob is equally likely to pick L or R in round t, so each player is equally likely to receive [0, at] or [at, 1] in round t. Therefore, their expected payoff is:\nE[uti] = 1\n2 Vi([0, at]) +\n1 2 Vi([at, 1])\n= 1\n2 Vi([0, 1]) (Since valuations are additive)\n= 1\n2 . (87)\nSumming (87) over the T rounds gives the desired expected payoffs for each player.\nProposition 7. Bob has a pure strategy SB, such that for every Alice strategy SA, the cumulative utilities in the sequential game are bounded by:\nuA(SA, SB) \u2264 T/2 + ( \u2206\n2\u03b4 + 2\n) \u00b7 \u221a T and uB(SA, SB) \u2265 T/2\u2212 \u221a T .\nProof. Bob devises his strategy SB by considering a division of the cake into P = \u2308 \u221a T \u2309 consecutive intervals I1, . . . , IP of equal value to him. That is, Bob chooses points 0 = z0 \u2264 z1 . . . \u2264 zP = 1 such that\nIj = { [zj\u22121, zj) if 1 \u2264 j \u2264 P \u2212 1; [zP\u22121, zP ] if j = P ;\nand VB(Ij) = 1/P \u2200j \u2208 [P ] . (88)\nAn illustration of the division into intervals used by Bob can be seen in Figure 17.\nBob\u2019s strategy SB is defined as follows. Bob keeps a counter j associated with each interval Ij , such that the value of the counter at time t, denoted cj,t, represents how many times Alice has cut inside the interval Ij in the first t rounds (including round t). For each time t \u2208 [T ]:\n\u2022 Let Ij be the interval that contains Alice\u2019s cut at time t (that is, at \u2208 Ij), for j \u2208 [P ].\n\u2022 If cj,t is even then Bob plays L; if cj,t is odd, then Bob plays R.\nInformally, Bob alternates between L and R inside each interval Ij . We argue that this Bob strategy ensures his payoff is at least 1/2\u2212 o(1) per round, while Alice cannot get more than 1/2+ o(1) per round.\nFor each i \u2208 [P ] and j \u2208 [ci,T ], let ri,j be the first time when the number of cuts in Ii reached j. That is,\nri,j = min{t \u2208 N | ci,t = j and at \u2208 Ii} .\nBy definition of the sequence {ri,\u2113}, for each i, j \u2208 N with 2j \u2264 ci,T :\n\u2022 Alice cut in the interval Ii in both rounds ri,2j\u22121 and ri,2j (meaning ari,2j\u22121 , ari,2j \u2208 Ii);\n\u2022 Bob played different actions in the rounds ri,2j\u22121 and ri,2j .\nWe view rounds ri,2j\u22121 and ri,2j as a pair. For each i \u2208 [P ], there is at most one round ri,j that does not have a pair, namely round ri,ci,T : the last round Alice cut in Ii. However, this loss only represents at most P rounds in total, which will translate to a sub-linear loss for either Alice\u2019s or Bob\u2019s utility estimates.\nNow we can bound the cumulative utility of each player.\nBob\u2019s payoff. For each i, j \u2208 N with 2j \u2264 ci,T , Bob\u2019s payoff across the two rounds ri,2j\u22121 and ri,2j is bounded by\nu ri,2j\u22121 B + u ri,2j B \u2265 1\u2212 VB(Ii) = 1\u2212\n1 P . (89)\nSince the rounds ri,j with i \u2208 [P ] and 2j \u2264 ci,T represent a subset of the total set of rounds [T ], Bob\u2019s cumulative payoff is at least\nT\u2211 t=1 utB \u2265 P\u2211 i=1  \u2211 j\u2208N:2j\u2264ci,T u ri,2j\u22121 B + u ri,2j B  \u2265\nP\u2211 i=1  \u2211 j\u2208N:2j\u2264ci,T ( 1\u2212 1 P ) (By (89)) \u2265 ( 1\u2212 1\nP\n) T \u2212 P\n2 (Since the sum is over at least T\u2212P2 pairs of rounds)\nSince P = \u2308 \u221a T \u2309 \u2265 \u221a T , we get\nuB = T\u2211 t=1 utB \u2265 ( 1\u2212 1 P ) T \u2212 P 2 = T 2 \u2212 \u2308 \u221a T \u2309 2 \u2212 T 2\u2308 \u221a T \u2309 + 1 2\n\u2265 T 2 \u2212 \u221a T + 1 2 \u2212 \u221a T 2 + 1 2 = T\n2 \u2212 \u221a T .

            "text": "In this section, we analyze the fictitious play dynamics from Definition 3 and prove Theorem 4. We first prove the main theorem using lemmas that will be presented later, and then prove the required lemmas.\nRestatement of Theorem 4. When both Alice and Bob run fictitious play, regardless of tiebreaking rules, their average payoff will converge to 1/2 at a rate of O(1/ \u221a T ).

(95)\nSince uA = \u2211T t=1 u t A and uB = \u2211T t=1 u t B, both players\u2019 utilities are bounded as required, which completes the proof.\nTo prove the required lemmas, we first introduce several notations. For ease for exposition, we often use round t = 0 as a fake round in which nothing actually happens and all the defined quantities are zero.\nDefinition 8. For t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T}:\n\u2022 Let rt be the number of rounds in which Bob has picked R, up to and including round t.\n\u2022 Let \u2113t be the number of rounds in which Bob has picked L up to and including round t.\n\u2022 Let \u03b1t = rt \u2212 \u2113t. \u2022 Let \u03b2t = \u2211t i=1(2VB([0, ai])\u2212 1).\n\u2022 Let \u03c1t = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t|, which we call the radius.\nWe remark that in the fake round of t = 0, all these variables have the value zero. Alice\u2019s action under fictitious play entirely depends on the variable \u03b1t while Bob\u2019s action entirely depends on \u03b2t. Overall, we will bound the payoffs using the growth of the radius \u03c1t over t = 0, 1, . . . , T . To this end, we introduce two lemmas that will play an essential role throughout the proof.\nFirst, the following lemma formally argues that the action taken by each player is guided by their corresponding variable \u03b1 and \u03b2t, respectively.\nLemma 11. Let t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T \u2212 1}. Then the following hold for round t+ 1:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s action with respect to \u03b1t:\n\u2013 If \u03b1t > 0, Alice will cut at 1.\n\u2013 If \u03b1t < 0, Alice will cut at 0.\n\u2013 If \u03b1t = 0, any action would incur the same payoff, so she could cut anywhere.\n\u2022 Bob\u2019s action with respect to \u03b2t:\n\u2013 If \u03b2t > 0, Bob will pick L.\n\u2013 If \u03b2t < 0, Bob will pick R.\n\u2013 If \u03b2t = 0, any action would incur the same payoff, so he could pick either L or R.\nProof. First, consider Alice\u2019s choice. For t = 0, there is no history, so any choice has the same value to her; accordingly, \u03b10 = 0. For t \u2265 1, the expected value she assigns to any particular cut location x is:\n1 t (rtVA([0, x]) + \u2113tVA([x, 1])) = 1 t (rtVA([0, x]) + \u2113t(1\u2212 VA([0, x]))\n= rt \u2212 \u2113t\nt VA([0, x]) + \u2113t t\n= \u03b1t t VA([0, x]) + \u2113t t . (96)\nFrom (96), we get that Alice\u2019s cut decision is entirely based on \u03b1t. If \u03b1t < 0, she will minimize VA([0, x]), which means she cuts at 0. If \u03b1t > 0, she will maximize VA([0, x]), which means she cuts at 1. If \u03b1t = 0, then her choice of x doesn\u2019t affect her expected value.\nNow consider Bob\u2019s choice. For t = 0, there is no history, so Bob is indifferent between L and R; accordingly, \u03b20 = 0. For t \u2265 1, the expected value he assigns to choosing L is:\nEL = 1\nt t\u2211 i=1 VB([0, ai]) . (97)\nThe expected value he assigns to choosing R is:\nER = 1\nt t\u2211 i=1 VB([ai, 1]) . (98)\nCombining (97) and (98), the difference between his expected value for choosing L and R is:\nEL \u2212 ER =\n( 1\nt t\u2211 i=1 VB([0, ai])\n) \u2212 ( 1\nt t\u2211 i=1 VB([ai, 1])\n) = 1\nt t\u2211 i=1 (2VB([0, ai])\u2212 1) = \u03b2t t . (99)\nFrom (99), we get that Bob\u2019s decision is entirely based on \u03b2t. If \u03b2t < 0, he values R more than L, so he picks R. If \u03b2t > 0, he values L more than R, so he picks L. If \u03b2t = 0, he values each equally.\nThe following lemma further describes the evolution of \u03b1t and \u03b2t given the actions taken by the players.\nLemma 12. For each round t \u2208 [T ]:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s action affects \u03b2t as follows:\n\u2013 If Alice cuts at 0 in round t, then \u03b2t = \u03b2t\u22121 \u2212 1. \u2013 If Alice cuts at 1 in round t, then \u03b2t = \u03b2t\u22121 + 1. \u2013 If she cuts at x \u2208 (0, 1), then |\u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121| < 1.\n\u2022 Bob\u2019s action affects \u03b1t as follows:\n\u2013 If Bob picks L in round t, then \u03b1t = \u03b1t\u22121 \u2212 1. \u2013 If Bob picks R in round t, then \u03b1t = \u03b1t\u22121 + 1.\nProof. First, we consider the impact of Alice\u2019s cut point at on \u03b2t. Explicitly writing out the difference \u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121 gives:\n\u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121 = t\u2211\ni=1 (2VB([0, ai])\u2212 1)\u2212 t\u22121\u2211 i=1 (2VB([0, ai])\u2212 1) = 2VB([0, at])\u2212 1 . (100)\nIf at = 0, then VB([0, at]) = VB([0, 0]) = 0, so by (100) we have \u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121 = \u22121 as desired. If at = 1, then VB([0, at]) = VB([0, 1]) = 1, so by (100) we have \u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121 = 1. If at \u2208 (0, 1), then there is at least some cake on each side of at, so we have VB([0, at]) \u2208 (0, 1). By (100), we have \u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121 \u2208 (\u22121, 1), so |\u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121| < 1 as stated by the lemma. Second, we consider the impact of Bob\u2019s choice on \u03b1t. Explicitly writing out the difference \u03b1t \u2212 \u03b1t\u22121, we obtain the following:\n\u03b1t \u2212 \u03b1t\u22121 = (rt \u2212 \u2113t)\u2212 (rt\u22121 \u2212 \u2113t\u22121) = (rt \u2212 rt\u22121)\u2212 (\u2113t \u2212 \u2113t\u22121) =\n{ 1 bt = R\n\u22121 bt = L (101)\nThis completes the proof.\nLet us elaborate more the dynamics of each player based on Lemma 11 and 12. If either of \u03b1t or \u03b2t is exactly 0, the corresponding player will use their tie-breaking rules. Ignoring these cases, these choices lead to movement through (\u03b1t, \u03b2t) space that spirals counter-clockwise around the origin at exactly 45 degree angles. Figure 18-(a) describes the overall dynamics of the variables (\u03b1t, \u03b2t).\nThe following lemma shows a symmetry that will help reduce the number of cases in the subsequent analysis. Figure 18-(b) depicts the rotational symmetry of fictitious play dynamics in the \u03b1-\u03b2-plane shown by the lemma. Specifically, the symmetry will allow us to assume \u03b1t \u2265 0 without loss of generality when analyzing \u03c1t and u t B.\nLemma 13. Consider an arbitrary pair of tie-breaking rules for both players. Consider the resulting sequence for the variables \u03b1t, \u03b2t and u t B for t = 0, . . . , T . Then, there exists another choice of tiebreaking rules that would result in the sequence of variables \u03b1\u0303t, \u03b2\u0303t, and u\u0303 t B for t = 0, . . . , T such that\n\u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t; \u03b2\u0303t = \u2212\u03b2t; u\u0303tB = utB . (102)\nProof. The proof will proceed by induction.\nBase case All of \u03b10, \u03b1\u03030, \u03b20, \u03b2\u03030, u 0 B, and u\u0303 0 B are zero, so (102) trivially holds.\nInductive hypothesis Assume that (102) holds for some t \u2265 0.\nInductive step We show that (102) holds for t+1. Suppose that, under the original tie-breaking rules, Alice cut at at+1 and Bob picked bt+1 \u2208 {L,R} in round t + 1. First, we analyze for Alice. Let a\u2032t+1 \u2208 [0, 1] be the unique point for which\nVB([0, at+1]) = VB([a \u2032 t+1, 1]) . (103)\nThe point a\u2032t+1 is uniquely defined since Bob\u2019s density is strictly positive. We show that there exists another choice of tie-breaking rules under which, starting from \u03b1\u0303t and \u03b2\u0303t, Alice cuts at a \u2032 t+1 in round t+ 1. We split into cases based on \u03b1t:\n(\u03b1t > 0): Then at+1 = 1 by Lemma 11. Since VB([0, at+1]) = VB([0, 1]), we have a \u2032 t+1 = 0 by\ndefinition. By the inductive hypothesis, we have \u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t, and so \u03b1\u0303t < 0. Then, regardless of tie-breaking rules, Alice cuts at 0 = a\u2032t+1.\n(\u03b1t < 0): Then at+1 = 0 by Lemma 11. Since VB([0, at+1] = 0 = VB([1, 1]), we have a \u2032 t+1 = 1\nby definition. By the inductive hypothesis, \u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t, and so \u03b1\u0303t > 0. Then, regardless of tie-breaking rules, Alice cuts at 1 = a\u2032t+1.\n(\u03b1t = 0): Then Alice can break ties any way she likes by Lemma 11. However, \u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t = 0, so any cut point is a valid choice for her new tie-breaking rule. In particular, she can cut at a\u2032t+1.\nSecond, we analyze for Bob. Let b\u2032t+1 \u2208 {L,R} be such that b\u2032t+1 \u0338= bt+1. We show that there exist tie-breaking rules under which, starting from \u03b1\u0303t and \u03b2\u0303t, Bob chooses b \u2032 t+1. We split into cases based on \u03b2t:\n(\u03b2t > 0): Then bt+1 = L by Lemma 11; therefore, b \u2032 t+1 = R. By the inductive hypothesis,\n\u03b2\u0303t = \u2212\u03b2t, so \u03b2\u0303t < 0. Then, regardless of tie-breaking rules, Bob picks R = b\u2032t+1.\n(\u03b2t < 0): Then bt+1 = R by Lemma 11; therefore, b \u2032 t+1 = L. By the inductive hypothesis,\n\u03b2\u0303t = \u2212\u03b2t, so \u03b2\u0303t > 0. Then, regardless of tie-breaking rules, Bob picks L = b\u2032t+1.\n(\u03b2t = 0): Then Bob can break ties any way he likes by Lemma 11. However, \u03b2\u0303t = \u2212\u03b2t = 0, so either L or R is a valid choice for his new tie-breaking rule. In particular, he can choose b\u2032t+1.\nFinally, we show that these opposite choices have exactly the desired effect on \u03b1\u0303t+1, \u03b2\u0303t+1, and u\u0303t+1B . Covering each in turn:\n\u2022 Since Bob picks the opposite side under the trajectory associated with \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b2\u0303, the change from \u03b1t to \u03b1t+1 is in the opposite direction as the change from \u03b1\u0303t to \u03b1\u0303t+1 by Lemma 12. By the inductive hypothesis, we have \u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t, and so \u03b1\u0303t+1 = \u2212\u03b1t+1.\n\u2022 Since Alice picks the mirror image of her cut point under the trajectory associated with \u03b1\u0303 and \u03b2\u0303, the change from \u03b2t to \u03b2t+1 is exactly opposite to the change from \u03b2\u0303t to \u03b2\u0303t+1. Specifically,\n\u03b2t+1 = \u03b2t + ( 2VB([0, at+1])\u2212 1 ) , (104)\nwhile\n\u03b2\u0303t+1 = \u03b2\u0303t + ( 2VB([0, a \u2032 t+1])\u2212 1 ) = \u03b2\u0303t + 2(1\u2212 VB([a\u2032t+1, 1]))\u2212 1 = \u03b2\u0303t + 2(1\u2212 VB([0, at+1]))\u2212 1\n= \u03b2\u0303t \u2212 ( 2VB([0, at+1])\u2212 1 ) . (105)\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we have \u03b2\u0303t = \u2212\u03b2t. Using equations (104) and (105), we obtain \u03b2\u0303t+1 = \u2212\u03b2t+1.\n\u2022 Under Alice\u2019s new cut point a\u2032t+1, Bob\u2019s valuation of the left and right sides of the cake swap, i.e., VB([0, a \u2032 t+1]) = VB([at+1, 1]). But he also chooses the opposite side, so he gets exactly the\nsame payoff as under the original tie-breaking rules in round t+ 1. Therefore, u\u0303t+1B = u t+1 B .\nBy induction, the claim holds for all t, which completes the proof.\nIn addition, it is helpful to distinguish between the rounds that cross an axis in the \u03b1-\u03b2 plane and those that do not. The following formalizes the definition of such rounds, which are depicted in Figure 19-(a).\nDefinition 9. An axis-crossing round is a round t where at least one of the following occurs:\n\u2022 \u03b1t = 0\n\u2022 \u03b2t+1 > 0, but \u03b2t \u2264 0\n\u2022 \u03b2t+1 < 0, but \u03b2t \u2265 0.\nImportantly, we will show that \u03c1t can strictly increase only if the current round is axis-crossing, while it is non-decreasing over the entire game. The following lemma formalizes this observation. We provide an example in Figure 19-(b).\nLemma 14. Let t \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , T}. The radius \u03c1t satisfies the following properties:\n(a) \u03c1t = \u03c1t+1 if t is not axis-crossing\n(b) \u03c1t \u2264 \u03c1t+1 \u2264 2 + \u03c1t if t is axis-crossing\n(c) \u03c10 = 0\n(d) \u03c1t \u2265 1 for t \u2265 1.\nIn particular, the radius \u03c1t is non-decreasing in t.\nProof. First, we will show (a) and (b). Consider an arbitrary round t \u2208 {0, . . . , T}. By Lemma 12, we have |\u03b1t+1 \u2212 \u03b1t| \u2264 1 and |\u03b2t+1 \u2212 \u03b2t| \u2264 1, so by the triangle inequality\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c1t+1 \u2212 \u03c1t\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223|\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| \u2212 |\u03b1t| \u2212 |\u03b2t|\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2 . (106) Therefore, \u03c1t+1 \u2264 2+\u03c1t, as required by (b). Thus for (a) and (b) it remains to show that \u03c1t+1 \u2265 \u03c1t \u2200t \u2208 {0, . . . , T} and that \u03c1t+1 = \u03c1t if t is not axis-crossing.\nBy Lemma 13, it suffices to consider \u03b1t \u2265 0. More precisely, this is because if \u03b1t \u2264 0, then there exists a tie-breaking rule with associated \u03b1\u0303t satisfying \u03b1\u0303t = \u2212\u03b1t for every t = 0, 1, . . . , T , so \u03b1\u0303t \u2265 0. Crucially, the lemma ensures the sequences \u03b1\u0303t and \u03b1t have the same radius \u03c1t.\nWe consider a few cases based on \u03b1t and \u03b2t, considering only \u03b1t \u2265 0. Since \u03b1t is an integer, also divide into \u03b1t \u2265 1 and \u03b1t = 0:\n(\u03b1t \u2265 1 and \u03b2t > 0): By Lemma 11 Alice will cut at 1 and Bob will pick L. Then by Lemma 12, we have \u03b1t+1 = \u03b1t \u2212 1 and \u03b2t+1 = \u03b2t + 1. Therefore:\n\u03c1t+1 = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| = \u03b1t \u2212 1 + \u03b2t + 1 (Since \u03b1t+1 \u2265 0) = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| (Because \u03b1t, \u03b2t \u2265 0) = \u03c1t . (107)\n(\u03b1t \u2265 1 and \u03b2t = 0): Then Alice will cut at 1 and Bob will pick whichever piece he likes. Therefore \u03b1t+1 = \u03b1t\u00b1 1 and \u03b2t+1 = \u03b2t +1 = 1. Since \u03b2t \u2264 0 but \u03b2t+1 > 0, round t is axis-crossing. What remains is to show that \u03c1t+1 \u2265 \u03c1t in this case:\n\u03c1t+1 = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| \u2265 |\u03b1t| \u2212 1 + 1 (Because |x\u00b1 y| \u2265 |x| \u2212 |y| for all x, y) = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| (Since \u03b2t = 0) = \u03c1t . (108)\n(\u03b1t \u2265 1 and \u22121 < \u03b2t < 0): Then Alice will cut at 1 and Bob will pick R. Therefore, \u03b1t+1 = \u03b1t+1 and \u03b2t+1 = \u03b2t + 1. Since \u03b2t < 0 but \u03b2t+1 > 0, round t is axis-crossing. What remains is to show that \u03c1t+1 \u2265 \u03c1t:\n\u03c1t+1 = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| = \u03b1t + 1 + |\u03b2t + 1| \u2265 \u03b1t + 1 + |\u03b2t| \u2212 1 (Since |x+ y| \u2265 |x| \u2212 |y| for all x, y) = \u03c1t . (109)\n(\u03b1t \u2265 1 and \u03b2t \u2264 \u22121): Then Alice will cut at 1 and Bob will pick R. Therefore, \u03b1t+1 = \u03b1t + 1 and \u03b2t+1 = \u03b2t + 1. In this case, \u03c1t+1 = \u03c1t:\n\u03c1t+1 = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| = \u03b1t + 1\u2212 (\u03b2t + 1) (Because \u03b2t + 1 \u2264 0) = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| (Since \u03b2t \u2264 0) = \u03c1t . (110)\n(\u03b1t = 0 and \u03b2t \u2265 0): Then t is an axis-crossing round. Bob could pick either L or R, but either way |\u03b1t+1| = 1. Alice could cut anywhere, but since |\u03b2t+1 \u2212 \u03b2t| \u2264 1 we can still conclude |\u03b2t| \u2212 |\u03b2t+1| \u2264 1. Therefore:\n\u03c1t+1 = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| \u2265 1 + |\u03b2t| \u2212 1 = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| (Since \u03b1t = 0) = \u03c1t . (111)\n(\u03b1t = 0 and \u03b2t < 0): Then we can use the symmetry of Lemma 13 to consider \u03b2t > 0 instead, which has already been covered.\nIn all cases, properties (a) and (b) must hold.\nNow we show that the properties (c) and (d) hold. Property (c) follows from \u03b10 = \u03b20 = 0. Because \u03c1t+1 \u2265 \u03c1t for all t, property (d) would follow from showing \u03c11 \u2265 1, which can be seen true from the following inequality:\n\u03c11 = |\u03b11|+ |\u03b21| = 1 + |\u03b21| (Since \u03b10 = 0, so \u03b11 = \u00b11) \u2265 1 . (112)\nThis finishes the proof.\nLemma 15. Suppose t\u2212 1 is an axis-crossing round and \u03c4 > t\u2212 1 is the next axis-crossing round after t\u2212 1. Then, there exists at least \u03c1t \u2212 2 and at most \u03c1t rounds between them, i.e.,\n\u03c1t \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2212 t \u2264 \u03c1t . (113)\nProof. By Lemma 13, we can assume \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 0. Then it suffices to consider only four types that the axis-crossing round t\u2212 1 could have:\n(i) \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 1, \u03b2t\u22121 \u2264 0, and \u03b2t > 0;\n(ii) \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 1, \u03b2t\u22121 \u2265 0, and \u03b2t < 0;\n(iii) \u03b1t\u22121 = 0 and \u03b2t\u22121 \u2265 1;\n(iv) \u03b1t\u22121 = 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b2t\u22121 < 1.\nWe show separately for each of the types (i)-(iv).\n(i) \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 1, \u03b2t\u22121 \u2264 0, and \u03b2t > 0. Because \u03b1t\u22121 > 0, Alice will cut at 1 in round t by Lemma 11, so \u03b2t = \u03b2t\u22121 + 1. Since \u03b2t\u22121 and \u03b2t have different signs, it must be that \u22121 < \u03b2t\u22121 \u2264 0 and 0 < \u03b2t \u2264 1. As long as \u03b1 remains positive, Alice will keep cutting at 1 and increasing \u03b2 by Lemma 11 and Lemma 12, so the next axis-crossing round \u03c4 cannot be one where \u03b2 changes\nsign. Thus, it must be the one satisfying \u03b1\u03c4 = 0. Until then, Bob will keep picking L, so \u03b1 will decrease by 1 every round. Therefore, this implies that \u03c4 = t + \u03b1t. To show \u03c4 \u2212 t \u2264 \u03c1t as required by (113), we have\n\u03c4 \u2212 t = \u03b1t \u2264 |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| \u2264 \u03c1t.\nTo prove \u03c1t \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2212 t, observe that \u03b1t \u2265 \u03b1t\u22121 \u2212 1. Since \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 1, we have \u03b1t \u2265 0. Thus\n\u03c4 \u2212 t = \u03b1t \u2265 |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| \u2212 1 (Since 0 < \u03b2t \u2264 1 and \u03b1t \u2265 0) = \u03c1t \u2212 1 > \u03c1t \u2212 2 . (114)\n(ii) \u03b1t\u22121 \u2265 1, \u03b2t\u22121 \u2265 0, and \u03b2t < 0. Because \u03b1t\u22121 > 0, Alice will cut at 1 in round t, so \u03b2t = \u03b2t\u22121 + 1. But then \u03b2t > \u03b2t\u22121 \u2265 0, contradicting \u03b2t < 0. Therefore, this case cannot happen.\n(iii) \u03b1t\u22121 = 0 and \u03b2t\u22121 \u2265 1. By Lemma 11, Alice can cut wherever she likes, but Bob will pick L. Wherever Alice cuts, we will have \u03b1t = \u22121 and \u03b2t \u2265 0. In order to return to \u03b1 = 0, Bob must start picking R, but he cannot do so until \u03b2 \u2264 0 by Lemma 11. Therefore, the next axis-crossing round \u03c4 will be the one where \u03b2\u03c4+1 < 0 and \u03b2\u03c4 \u2265 0. Until then, Alice will keep cutting at 0, so \u03b2 will decrease by 1 every round. Therefore, \u03c4 = t + \u230a\u03b2t\u230b, and this implies that\n\u03c4 \u2212 t = \u230a\u03b2t\u230b \u2264 |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t| = \u03c1t .\nAgain to show \u03c1t \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2212 t, observe that\n\u03c4 \u2212 t = \u230a\u03b2t\u230b \u2265 |\u03b1t| \u2212 1 + |\u03b2t| \u2212 1 (Since \u03b1t = \u22121 and \u03b2t \u2265 0) = \u03c1t \u2212 2 .\n(iv) \u03b1t\u22121 = 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b2t\u22121 < 1. Under these constraints, we have \u03c1t\u22121 = |\u03b1t\u22121| + |\u03b2t\u22121| < 1, so part (d) of Lemma 14 implies that t \u2212 1 = 0. Therefore, we have \u03b1t\u22121 = \u03b2t\u22121 = 0. Accounting for all possible choices Alice and Bob can make, it must be the case that \u03b1t = \u00b11 and \u22121 \u2264 \u03b2t \u2264 1, which implies that 1 \u2264 \u03c1t \u2264 2. Thus it suffices to show that \u03c4 \u2212 t \u2264 1. We have a few cases:\n\u2022 If \u03b1t = 1 and \u03b2t > 0, then Bob will pick L in round t + 1 by Lemma 11. Therefore, \u03b1t+1 = 0, so \u03c4 = t+ 1. \u2022 If \u03b1t = 1 and \u22121 < \u03b2t \u2264 0, then Alice will cut at 1 in round t + 1 by Lemma 11. Therefore, \u03b2t+1 > 0, so round t is axis-crossing and \u03c4 \u2212 t = 0. \u2022 If \u03b1t = 1 and \u03b2t = \u22121, then Alice will cut at 1 and Bob will pick R in round t + 1 by Lemma 11. That will lead to \u03b1t+1 = 2 and \u03b2t+1 = 0, so round t + 1 is axis-crossing. Therefore, \u03c4 \u2212 t = 1.\n\u2022 If \u03b1t = \u22121, we can reduce to the \u03b1t = 1 case by Lemma 13.\nThus for all types (i)-(iv), it follows that \u03c1t \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2212 t \u2264 \u03c1t as desired.\nThe next two lemmas show different conditions under which \u03c1 must increase. The first (Lemma 16) is more technical in nature, while the second (Lemma 17) is key to bounding the players\u2019 total payoff.\nLemma 16. Suppose there exists a round t such that \u03b2t \u0338\u2208 Z. Let \u03c4 > t be the first round after t such that \u03b2t\u03b2\u03c4 \u2264 0, i.e., \u03b2\u03c4 is zero or has the opposite sign of \u03b2t. Then the following inequality holds:\n\u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u230b+ 1.\nProof. Again by Lemma 13, we can assume without loss of generality that \u03b2t \u2265 0. Since \u03b2t \u0338\u2208 Z, we can further assume \u03b2t > 0.\nSuppose that \u03b2\u03c4 \u0338\u2208 Z. Because \u03c4 > t is the first round after t with \u03b2\u03c4 \u2264 0, we must have \u03b2\u03c4\u22121 > 0. Since \u03b2\u03c4 \u0338\u2208 Z, we also have \u03b2\u03c4 < 0. Combining |\u03b2\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c4\u22121| \u2264 1 and \u03b2\u03c4 < 0 yields 0 < \u03b2\u03c4\u22121 < 1. Since \u03b2\u03c4\u22121 > 0, Bob picked L in round \u03c4 by Lemma 11, so we have \u03b1\u03c4 = \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2212 1. As \u03b2\u03c4 < \u03b2\u03c4\u22121, Alice must have not cut at 1 in round \u03c4 by Lemma 12. This implies that \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2264 0. Finally, we obtain\n\u03c1\u03c4 = |\u03b1\u03c4 |+ |\u03b2\u03c4 | \u2265 |\u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2212 1|+ 0 (Since \u03b1\u03c4 = \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2212 1) = 1\u2212 \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 (Since \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2264 0) = 1 + |\u03b1\u03c4\u22121|+ \u230a|\u03b2\u03c4\u22121|\u230b (Since \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2264 0 and 0 < \u03b2\u03c4\u22121 < 1) = 1 + \u230a\u03c1\u03c4\u22121\u230b (Since \u03b1\u03c4\u22121 \u2208 Z) \u2265 1 + \u230a\u03c1t\u230b . (By Lemma 14)\nOn the other hand, suppose \u03b2\u03c4 \u2208 Z. By Lemma 14, we have \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1t. Since \u03b2t \u0338\u2208 Z but \u03b1t \u2208 Z and \u03b1\u03c4 \u2208 Z, we have \u03c1\u03c4 \u2208 Z but \u03c1t \u0338\u2208 Z. Therefore, \u230a\u03c1t\u230b < \u03c1t \u2264 \u03c1\u03c4 . Since both \u230a\u03c1t\u230b \u2208 Z and \u03c1\u03c4 \u2208 Z, we have \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u230b+ 1.\nLemma 17. Let t be a round in which Alice cuts at at \u2208 (0, 1). Let \u03c4 \u2212 1 be the first axis-crossing round strictly after t\u2212 1. Then \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b+ 1.\nProof. By Lemma 11, Alice will cut at 0 or 1 if \u03b1t\u22121 \u0338= 0. As Alice does not cut at 0 or 1 in round t, this implies that \u03b1t\u22121 = 0. First, if \u03b2t\u22121 = 0, then Lemma 14 implies t \u2212 1 = 0, so \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 1 = \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b+ 1 as required.\nOtherwise, by Lemma 13, we can assume without loss of generality that \u03b2t\u22121 > 0. Because \u03c1t\u22121 \u2265 |\u03b2t\u22121| > 0, Lemma 14 implies t\u2212 1 \u2265 1. By part (d) of Lemma 14, we further have\n1 \u2264 \u03c1t\u22121 = |\u03b1t\u22121|+ |\u03b2t\u22121| = \u03b2t\u22121 .\nSince Alice does not cut at 0 in round t, we have \u03b2t > \u03b2t\u22121 \u2212 1 by Lemma 11, which implies that \u03b2t > 0. As \u03b2t\u22121 > 0, Bob picked L in round t by Lemma 11, so we have \u03b1t < 0. Again by Lemma 11, for \u03b1 to return to 0, Bob would have to start picking R, but he won\u2019t until \u03b2 stops being positive. Therefore, the next axis-crossing round after t will be one where \u03b2 crosses into being non-positive from positive, so \u03b2\u03c4 < 0.\nLet s > t \u2212 1 be the first round after t \u2212 1 such that \u03b2s \u2264 0. Because \u03b2\u03c4 < 0, we have s \u2264 \u03c4 . Because \u03b2t > 0, we have s > t.\nIf \u03b2t\u22121 \u0338\u2208 Z, then applying Lemma 16 to t \u2212 1 yields \u03c1s \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b + 1. By Lemma 14, we have \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1s, and so \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1s \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b+ 1 as required.\nIf \u03b2t \u0338\u2208 Z, then applying Lemma 16 to t yields \u03c1s \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u230b + 1. By Lemma 14, we have \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1s and \u03c1t \u2265 \u03c1t\u22121, and so \u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1s \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u230b+ 1 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b+ 1 as required.\nElse, we have \u03b2t\u22121, \u03b2t \u2208 Z. Since Alice did not cut at 0 or 1 in round t, by Lemma 12 we have |\u03b2t \u2212 \u03b2t\u22121| < 1. Since \u03b2t, \u03b2t\u22121 \u2208 Z, we get \u03b2t\u22121 = \u03b2t. Moreover, since \u03b1t\u22121 = 0, we have |\u03b1t| = |\u03b1t\u22121 \u00b1 1| = 1. This implies that\n\u03c1\u03c4 \u2265 \u03c1t (By Lemma 14) = \u03c1t\u22121 + 1 (Since \u03b2t = \u03b2t\u22121 and |\u03b1t| = |\u03b1t\u22121|+ 1) \u2265 \u230a\u03c1t\u22121\u230b+ 1 .\nThis completes the proof.\nThe following lemma bounds Bob\u2019s total payoff using the radius \u03c1t.\nLemma 18. For every round t \u2265 0, the following inequalities hold:\n\u2212\u03c1t \u2264 t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03c1t. (115)\nProof. We will first show the following stronger set of inequalities by induction on t:\n0 \u2264 |\u03b1t|+ t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03c1t. (116)\nAs a base case, consider t = 0. Before anything has happened, all three sides of (116) are zero, so the inequalities trivially hold.\nNow assume that (116) holds for some t \u2265 0, and we will prove that it still holds for round t + 1. We consider three cases separately in what follows, depending on the values of \u03b1t and \u03b2t. Note that again by Lemma 13, it suffices to only consider cases where \u03b1t \u2265 0.\n\u2022 If \u03b1t > 0, Alice will cut at 1 in round t + 1 by Lemma 11. If Bob picks L, then he will receive a payoff of 1 and \u03b1t will decrease by 1 due to Lemma 12. If Bob picks R, then he will receive a payoff of 0 and \u03b1t will increase by 1 due to Lemma 12. In either case, the changes to |\u03b1t|+ \u2211t i=1(2uB(i)\u2212 1) cancel out, which implies that\n|\u03b1t|+ t\u2211\ni=1 (2uiB \u2212 1) = |\u03b1t+1|+ t+1\u2211 i=1 (2uiB \u2212 1). (117)\nFurther, by Lemma 14 we have \u03c1t+1 \u2265 \u03c1t. Together with the induction hypothesis (116), this concludes\n0 \u2264 |\u03b1t+1|+ t+1\u2211 i=1 (2uiB \u2212 1) \u2264 \u03c1t+1,\nand thus the induction holds for the first case.\n\u2022 If \u03b1t = 0 and \u03b2t \u2265 0, then regardless of whether Bob picks L or R in round t + 1 we have |\u03b1t+1| = |0\u00b1 1| = 1 as \u03b1 necessarily changes by 1. Therefore, we have(\n|\u03b1t+1|+ t+1\u2211 i=1 (2uiB \u2212 1)\n) \u2212 ( |\u03b1t|+\nt\u2211 i=1 (2uiB \u2212 1) ) = 1 + 2ut+1B \u2212 1\n= 2ut+1B (118)\nAlso, the change in \u03c1 can be bounded as follows:\n\u03c1t+1 \u2212 \u03c1t = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| \u2212 |\u03b1t| \u2212 |\u03b2t|\n= 1 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t+1\u2211 i=1 (2VB([0, ai])\u2212 1) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 0\u2212 \u03b2t (\u03b2t \u2265 0) = 1 + |(2VB([0, at+1])\u2212 1) + \u03b2t| \u2212 \u03b2t \u2265 1 + 2VB([0, at+1])\u2212 1 (Removing the absolute value) = 2VB([0, at+1]) (119)\nIf Bob picked L in round t + 1, this is exactly the same as (118). If Bob picked R, then by Lemma 11 and the assumption that \u03b2t \u2265 0 we must have \u03b2t = 0. The change in the radius can be bounded as follows:\n\u03c1t+1 \u2212 \u03c1t = |\u03b1t+1|+ |\u03b2t+1| \u2212 |\u03b1t| \u2212 |\u03b2t| = 1 + |2VB([0, at+1])\u2212 1| \u2212 0\u2212 0 (\u03b2t = 0) = 1 + |1\u2212 2VB([at+1, 1])| (VB([0, at+1]) + VB([at+1, 1]) = 1) = 1 + |\u2212 (1\u2212 2VB([at+1, 1]))| \u2265 1\u2212 1 + 2VB([at+1, 1]) (Removing the absolute value) = 2ut+1B (Since Bob picked R)\nIn either case, the radius increased by at least as much as the middle of (116). More precisely, by the induction hypothesis (116), we obtain\n|\u03b1t+1|+ t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) = |\u03b1t|+ t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) + 2ut+1B \u2212 1 + |\u03b1t+1| \u2212 |\u03b1t|\n\u2265 0 + 2ut+1B (\u03b1t = 0 and |\u03b1t+1| = 1) \u2265 0. (ut+1B \u2265 0)\nNote further that\n|\u03b1t+1|+ t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) = |\u03b1t|+ t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) + 2ut+1B \u2212 1 + |\u03b1t+1| \u2212 |\u03b1t|\n\u2264 \u03c1t + 2ut+1B (By the induction hypothesis) = \u03c1t+1. (\u03c1t+1 \u2212 \u03c1t = 2ut+1B )\nThis finishes the proof of the induction for the second case.\n\u2022 If \u03b1t = 0 and \u03b2t < 0, then by Lemma 13 we can consider \u03b1t = 0 and \u03b2t > 0 instead, which has already been shown above.\nIn all cases, the inductive step holds. Therefore, by induction principle, (116) holds for all t. Subtracting |\u03b1t| from all three sides of it, we obtain\n\u2212|\u03b1t| \u2264 t\u2211\ni=1\n(2uiB \u2212 1) \u2264 |\u03b2t|.\nSince \u03c1t = |\u03b1t|+ |\u03b2t|, this immediately implies the desired bounds.\nNow that we have bounds on the relevant events in terms of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03c1, we can bound them as functions of T to obtain our final result.\nLemma 19. Let n \u2265 7. Let t1, t2, . . . , tn be a sequence of rounds such that for all i \u2208 [n \u2212 1] the following inequality holds:\n\u03c1ti+1 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1ti\u230b+ 1. (120)\nThen tn \u2212 t1 > 110n 2. Proof. First, we will show by induction that, for i \u2208 [n], we have \u03c1ti \u2265 i \u2212 1. For the base case, \u03c1t1 \u2265 \u03c10 = 0, so the inequality trivially holds.\nNow assume \u03c1ti \u2265 i\u2212 1 for some i \u2208 [n\u2212 1] and we will prove that the induction step holds for the case i+ 1. By (120), observe that\n\u03c1ti+1 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1ti\u230b+ 1 \u2265 \u230ai\u2212 1\u230b+ 1 = (i+ 1)\u2212 1.\nThus, by the induction principle we have\n\u03c1ti \u2265 i\u2212 1 for i = 1, . . . , n (121)\nNow consider an arbitrary i \u2208 [n\u22121]. Note that \u03c1ti+1 \u2265 \u230a\u03c1ti\u230b+1 implies \u03c1ti+1 > \u03c1ti . Therefore, by Lemma 14, there must be an axis-crossing round ci among the interval [ti, ti+1). This is because if this is not true, we have \u03c1ti+1 = \u03c1ti which contradicts \u03c1ti+1 > \u03c1ti . Repeating the same argument for each i, we conclude that there exists a sequence of rounds c1, c2, . . . , cn\u22121 each of which is axis-crossing, and satisfies the following inequality for every i \u2208 [n\u2212 1]:\nti \u2264 ci < ti+1 (122)\nIn addition, for any i \u2208 [n\u2212 1], we observe that\nci+1 \u2212 (ci + 1) \u2265 \u03c1ci+1 \u2212 2 (By Lemma 15, with \u03c4 = ci+1 and t = ci + 1) \u2265 \u03c1ti \u2212 2 (By (122)) \u2265 i\u2212 3 (By (121))\nSlightly rearranging, we obtain\nci+1 \u2212 ci \u2265 i\u2212 2 \u2200i \u2208 [n\u2212 1] . (123)\nCombining (122) and (123), we finally obtain\ntn \u2212 t1 > cn\u22121 \u2212 c1 (By (122))\n= n\u22122\u2211 i=1 (ci+1 \u2212 ci)\n\u2265 n\u22122\u2211 i=1 (i\u2212 2) (By (123)) = 1\n2 n2 \u2212 7 2 n+ 5.\nFor n \u2265 7, we have 12n 2 \u2212 72n+ 5 \u2265 1 10n 2,6 and so tn \u2212 t1 > n2/10, as required. 6We omit the elementary calculus.\nThe following lemma will finally be combined with Lemma 18 to obtain the desired bound for Bob\u2019s payoff.\nLemma 20. For T \u2265 5, the final radius \u03c1T satisfies the following:\n\u03c1T \u2264 2 \u221a 10T .\nProof. Let t1 = 0, and for i \u2265 2 recursively define ti be the first round after ti\u22121 satisfying \u03c1ti \u2265 \u230a\u03c1ti\u22121\u230b+ 1. Let n be the last index of such ti given the time horizon T .\nAs an immediate corollary of Lemma 19, we have\nn \u2264 max{7, \u221a 10T}.\nFor T \u2265 5, this implies that n \u2264 \u221a 10T . (124)\nBy Lemma 14, we also know that \u03c1 can increase by at most 2 per round. Furthermore, since tn is the last element in the sequence {ti}i\u2208[n], we have \u03c1T < \u230a\u03c1tn\u230b+1. Relaxing this slightly, we have\n\u03c1T \u2264 \u03c1tn + 2 . (125)\nTherefore, we obtain the following inequalities:\n\u03c1T \u2264 2 + \u03c1tn (By (125))\n= 2 + n\u22121\u2211 i=1 (\u03c1i+1 \u2212 \u03c1i) \u2264 2 + 2(n\u2212 1) (By Lemma 14) = 2n . (126)\nPutting (124) and (126) together, we obtain\n\u03c1T \u2264 2 \u221a 10T ,\nwhich finishes the proof of the lemma.\nUsing the above bound on the radius together with Lemma 18, Bob\u2019s payoff can now be bounded as follows.\nLemma 21. For T \u2265 5, Bob\u2019s total payoff satisfies:\nT 2 \u2212 \u221a 10T \u2264 T\u2211 t=1 utB \u2264 T 2 + \u221a 10T .\nProof. We start from the inequality (115). Halving all three sides of (115) for t = T and adding T/2, we obtain\nT 2 \u2212 1 2 \u03c1T \u2264 T\u2211 t=1 utB \u2264 T 2 + 1 2 \u03c1T .\nUsing the upper bound \u03c1T \u2264 2 \u221a 10T from Lemma 20 gives the desired bounds.\nCombined with Lemma 21, Alice\u2019s payoff can eventually be bounded using the following lemma, which effectively bounds the summation of Alice and Bob\u2019s total payoff.\nLemma 22. For T \u2265 5, the summation of total payoff to Alice and Bob satisfies the following:\nT \u2212 \u221a 10T \u2264 T\u2211 t=1 ( utA + u t B ) \u2264 T + \u221a 10T .\nProof. Given the time horizon T , let s1, s2, . . . , sk be the rounds in which Alice cuts at a point other than 0 or 1, where k denotes the number of such rounds. These are the only rounds in which the total payoff utA + u t B is not necessarily 1. The total payoff in these rounds can be bounded as\n0 \u2264 usiA + u si B \u2264 2 \u2200i \u2208 [k] .\nThus, we obtain\nT \u2212 k \u2264 T\u2211 t=1 utA + u t B \u2264 T + k.\nTherefore, it suffices to prove that k \u2264 \u221a 10T .\nIf k < 7, the proof follows as k < 7 \u2264 \u221a 10T .\nOtherwise, we have k \u2265 7. For each si, let \u03c4i be the round after the next axis-crossing round after si \u2212 1. Consider si for an arbitrary i \u2208 [k]. Due to Lemma 11, if \u03b1si\u22121 \u0338= 0 then Alice cuts at 0 or 1 in round si, which contradicts our definition of round si. Thus we have \u03b1si\u22121 = 0. This argument holds for arbitrary i \u2208 [k], so both si\u22121 and si+1\u22121 are axis-crossing rounds. Moreover, since both \u03b1si\u22121 = 0 and \u03b1si+1\u22121 = 0, there must have been some rounds between si \u2212 1 and si+1\u2212 1 where Bob picked L and some where he picked R. Therefore, \u03b2 must have changed sign at least once, so there is another axis-crossing round in between si \u2212 1 and si+1 \u2212 1 where \u03b2 changed sign. This implies that for every i = 1, . . . , k\u2212 1, the next axis crossing round \u03c4i after si\u2212 1 should exist at least before si+1 \u2212 1, i.e.,\n\u03c4i \u2264 si+1 \u2212 1 . (127)\nDue to the monotonicity of \u03c1 by Lemma 14, for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1} we have\n\u03c1si+1\u22121 \u2265 \u03c1\u03c4i (By (127)) \u2265 \u230a\u03c1si\u22121\u230b+ 1 . (By Lemma 17)\nBy Lemma 19, we have:\n(sk \u2212 1)\u2212 (s1 \u2212 1) > 1\n10 k2 . (128)\nRe-arranging (128) and using the fact that sk \u2212 s1 \u2264 T , we obtain k < \u221a 10T . This finishes the proof of the case k \u2265 7, which completes the lemma."
