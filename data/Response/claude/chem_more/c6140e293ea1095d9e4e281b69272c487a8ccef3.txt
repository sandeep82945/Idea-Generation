 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct in vitro and in vivo studies to further investigate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of picein against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. The preliminary in silico and in vitro results are promising but more studies are needed. 

2. Compare the neuroprotective effects of picein extracted from different plant sources like Salix species, Picrorhiza kurroa, and Norway spruce. This can identify the best plant source for therapeutic picein.

3. Explore the potential of picein as a BACE1 inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease treatment through in vitro enzyme assays and animal model studies. The in silico results suggest it may have inhibitory effects.

4. Investigate the synergistic effects of picein with other known neuroprotective agents like curcumin and ginseng. Combination therapy may provide enhanced benefits. 

5. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of picein supplementation in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. This is important to translate the preclinical findings to humans.
