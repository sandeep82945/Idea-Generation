However, given the inherent complexity of this disease and its development, it remains unclear as to whether associated interhemispheric changes play an important role in auditory verbal hallucination (AVH) development. As such, this study was developed to explore interhemispheric connectivity in the context of schizophrenia with AVH while excluding positive symptoms and other factors with the potential to confound these results.\nMethod: In total, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess 42 patients with AVH (APG), 26 without AVH (NPG), and 82 normal control (NC) individuals. Inter-hemispheric connectivity in these subjects was then assessed through the use of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and Pearson correlation analyses.\nResult: Relative to HC and NPG subjects, APG individuals exhibited a decrease in VMHC in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) extending into Heschl\u2019s gyrus, the insula, and the Rolandic operculum as well as in the fusiform gyrus extending into the para-hippocampus (Corrected p < 0.005, cluster size = 52). Among APG individuals, these observed impairments of interhemispheric connectivity were negatively correlated with Ho man auditory hallucination scores.\nConclusion: These results support the schizophrenia hemitropic disconnection hypothesis, and provide novel evidence suggesting that there may be a relationship between reductions in inter-hemispheric connectivity in auditory and memory-related networks and the pathogenesis of AVH in patients with schizophrenia following the exclusion of confounding factors from other positive symptoms.\nKEYWORDS\nschizophrenia, auditory verbal hallucinations, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, auditory-related network, memory-related network\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are a common symptom in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, affecting up to 60\u201370% of these individuals (1). The pathological basis for AVH development has been linked to the hemispheric specialization of functional connectivity within the brain (2\u2013 4). As noted previously, relative increases in the contributions of right hemisphere language areas may correspond to the more complex experiential characteristics of AVHs (5), with reductions in language lateralization potentially contributing to the perceived reality of these hallucinatory sounds. Other functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported schizophrenia to be associated with decreases in the typical lateralization of language processing in the brain (left > right), with AVH severity being associated with decreased functional lateralization (6, 7). Other studies have further linked the development of schizophrenia to interhemispheric disconnectivity, with the specific localization of such abnormalities in affected patients potentially playing a role in AVH development (8\u201310). At present, it remains unclear as to whether left-greater-than-right or right-greaterthan-left lateralization is most closely associated with AVH development. Differences in interhemispheric connectivity that have previously been observed when comparing patients with and without AVHs may also be confounded by other positive symptoms such as excitement, delusions, or confusion. Given this possibility and inconsistencies among prior studies, there is a clear need to conduct further studies exploring the relationships between changes within and between hemispheres and AVH incidence in individuals with schizophrenia. We supposed that there might be a relationship between reductions in inter-hemispheric connectivity in auditory and memoryrelated networks and the pathogenesis of AVH in patients with schizophrenia.\nThe present study was developed to assess interhemispheric connectivity in schizophrenia patients with and without AVHs through the use of a voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) approach in order to establish the relationship between interhemispheric changes and AVH development. The results of these analyses will serve as the first exploration of the mechanistic basis for AVH incidence in patients with schizophrenia as a function of inter-hemispheric connectivity when analyzed in a manner that minimized the confounding effects of other positive symptoms and related clinical symptoms on associated phenotypes."

Diagnoses were confirmed by administering the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (SCID), 4th edition (DSM-IV). These patients were further separated into two groups based on whether they do or do not experience AVHs (42 APG and 26 NPG, respectively). Classification standards were based upon PANSS scores and details pertaining to current and past symptoms obtained through a combination of face-to-face interviews and a review of prior medical records. Patients were included in the APG group if they exhibited a P3 (hallucination) score of > 4 and reported experiencing AVHs a minimum of once per month. APG status was additionally assessed by Professor HL Wang using the Hoffman Auditory Hallucination scale so as to establish the content, frequency, emotional impact, severity, and degree of attention associated with these hallucinations (11). Participants in the NPG group were patients that had not experienced AVH during the course of their illness. In addition, a normal control (NC) group consisting of 82 age, sex-, and handedness (right-handed)-matched native Chinese speakers were recruited for this study, which received approval from the local research ethics committee. All subjects provided written informed consent to participate following the review of a complete study description. Patient clinical and demographical data are compiled in Table 1."

Low-frequency drifts and high-frequency physiological noise were mitigated with a temporal filter (0.01\u20130.10Hz). As recent evidence suggests that the effects of head motion can be more effectively eliminated when using higher-order models (14), mean frame-wise displacement (FD), which measures voxelwise differences in motion and associated derivations, was assessed as a means of measuring head micromovements for study participants (15, 16). Nuisance regression was conducted through the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and global signals as covariates.\nVoxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity analyses\nVMHC for each patient wasmeasured based on the observed resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) among pairs of symmetric inter-hemispheric voxels. Briefly, VMHC maps were generated through Pearson correlation analyses of individual voxels and the mirror voxel in the opposite hemisphere of the brain (17). Measured correlation values were then subjected\nto Fisher z-transformation to improve associated normality, and group analyses were conducted with the resultant VMHC z-value data."

            "text": "The results of this study, which suggest that schizophrenia patients that experience AVHs exhibit significant changes in interhemispheric connectivity, offer robust neuroimaging support for the relationship between homotopic dysconnectivity and the occurrence of such hallucinations in schizophrenia (18). In contrast to prior studies, the present analysis was conducted after fully taking participant characteristics into consideration based on the assumption that other PANSS positive score items other than AVHs, such as delusions and suspicion, may have confounded the true relationship between AVH incidence and\nFIGURE 3 The Ho man score was negatively correlated with the VMHC in the STG cluster in APG (p < 0.05).\nabnormal. As such, the comparable PANSS total score, PANSS negative score, PANSS positive score (with the exception of P3), and PANSS general psychopathology results in the APG and NPG groups in the present analysis effectively mitigated the potential confounding effects of these variables. Even after controlling for these factors, greater abnormal homotopic connectivity was still observed in schizophrenia patients affected by AVHs relative to patients not affected by these hallucinations.\nThe fusiform gyrus plays important roles in visual and sensory processing. When individuals experience abnormal sensory processing and aberrant voice recognition, this may lead to the false identification of one\u2019s own voice as emanating from an external source, contributing to the perception of AVHs (19). The observed aberrant homotopic connectivity of the fusiform gyrus in patients with AVHs in the present study cohort supported this conclusion. Notably, this abnormal homotopic connectivity of the fusiform cluster extended to the para-hippocampal gyrus in those patients that experienced AVHs. In a study conducted by Xiao et al., all analyzed schizophrenia patients similarly exhibited para-hippocampus abnormalities (18), in contrast to the results of the present study in which abnormalities in the para-hippocampus were only evident in AVH patients. VMHC values for this region of the brain were significantly negatively correlated with Hoffman scores, although more research will be necessary to explain this finding. The parahippocampus is an important component of the limbic system, which regulates memory storage and retrieval (20). Schizophrenia patients primarily report AVHs as consisting of critical speech hallucinations, and often report similar comments in their previous memories. Abnormal activity and connectivity of the parahippocampal gyrus may result in incorrect perceptions pertaining to the storage and\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nextraction of information (8, 21). AVHs may thus develop as a consequence of the abnormal processing and retrieval of certain memories, as supported by a prior study in which patients experiencing hallucinations exhibited greater difficulty in determining the sources of memories (22).\nWith respect to the STG cluster, several studies have demonstrated that the role of the temporal lobe in voice recognition is inextricably linked to auditory hallucinations (23, 24). The more pronounced reduction in VMHC values in the STG and Heschl\u2019s gyrus in schizophrenia patients affected by AVHs further suggested that these regions are linked to the development of these hallucinations. Decreases in VMHC values in the STG and Heschl\u2019s gyrus would contribute to the dysfunctional cognition underlying AVHs through the incorrect identification of one\u2019s own voice as emanating from an external source. The Rolandic operculum is located in the frontal lobe and has repeatedly been shown to be closely linked to the mechanisms underlying psellism (7). One prior theoretical analysis of individuals with high schizotypy revealed alterations in both global properties and a reduction in the density of the gray matter in the Rolandic operculum in these patients (25). The Rolandic operculum also plays a role in the processing of auditory feedback, which may be linked to the processing of auditory feedback underlying AVH development (26). The insula is a multimodal convergence zone that plays a role in emotional regulation, contributing to the development of chronic positive symptoms together with the amygdala (27). One meta-analysis of functional data revealed a close relationship between AVHs in schizophrenia patients and the hippocampus, auditory cortex, and hippocampus (28). Consistently, structural and functional abnormalities may be suggestive of a central role for the insula in the production of AVHs (29)."
