    "abstractText": "Carbon dioxide emission is a high-profile issue that can affect both the human economy and human existence, but few scholars have studied the relationship between these two. Therefore, this study constructs the panel threshold regression (PTR) based on the National Bureau of Statistics of China\u2019s panel data from 2002 to 2019 in 19 regions. One of the advantages of PTR is to leverage segmented functions, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the data. Besides, by introducing the idea of a threshold, PTR can effectively avoid structural changes in the data. The different between this study and other research is that this study divides 19 regions into two parts: Eastern China and Central China. Based on that, this study researches and compares the different influences of the aging population on carbon emissions in these two regions. The results show that although the Environment Kuznets Curve has been confirmed in both Eastern China and Central China, with the development of the economy, the carbon emissions will increase in Eastern China and decrease in Central China, respectively. In addition, the key factors affecting carbon emissions in Eastern China and Central China are trade dependence and urbanization rate separately. Hence, this study suggests that the regional governments in Eastern China may guide and encourage more international trading companies to move to Central China, and at the same time, the regional governments in Central China should issue more policies to attract these companies, such as: reducing land lease fees and building better transportation infrastructure. Apart from that, the governments in Central China should vigorously increase the rate of urbanization to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency.",

One of the\nadvantages of PTR is to leverage segmented functions, allowing for a more detailed analy-\nsis of the data.

The different between this study and other research is that\nthis study divides 19 regions into two parts: Eastern China and Central China. Based on\nthat, this study researches and compares the different influences of the aging population on\ncarbon emissions in these two regions. The results show that although the Environment\nKuznets Curve has been confirmed in both Eastern China and Central China, with the devel-\nopment of the economy, the carbon emissions will increase in Eastern China and decrease\nin Central China, respectively. In addition, the key factors affecting carbon emissions in\nEastern China and Central China are trade dependence and urbanization rate separately.\nHence, this study suggests that the regional governments in Eastern China may guide and\nencourage more international trading companies to move to Central China, and at the same\ntime, the regional governments in Central China should issue more policies to attract these\ncompanies, such as: reducing land lease fees and building better transportation infrastruc-\nture. Apart from that, the governments in Central China should vigorously increase the rate\nof urbanization to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency."

Pachauri et al. [2] pointed out that carbon emissions from human activities accounted for about 95% of total carbon emissions. Matthew [3] noted that carbon dioxide is the main cause of the greenhouse effect. Studies by Nkalu and Edeme [4] and Matthew [5], respectively, demonstrated that excess carbon emissions reduced crop yields and shortened human lifespan. Research by Li et al. [6] showed that China is the largest coal consumer in the world: with coal being the primary source of energy consumption for the country. At the 75th United Nation General Assembly, the Chinese government scheduled that China would peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and will achieve carbon by 2060. There are two ways to achieve carbon neutrality: reduce CO2 emissions or increase CO2 uptake. This research studies how to achieve carbon neutrality by reducing carbon dioxide.\nPreviously, most studies had focused on exploring the impact of economic factors on car-\nbon emissions. For example, Dogan and Inglesi-Lotz [7] verified the Environment Kuznets Curve (ECK) using European panel data; there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between overall economic growth and carbon emissions. Simionescu et al. [8] made the same conclusion. Specifically, on the left side of the inflexion point, carbon emissions increase with economic development. When the level of economic development crosses the inflexion point, carbon emissions will decrease with economic development. Hanushek and Woessmann [9] found that education improved human capital, promotes economic development, and ultimately increases carbon emissions; this result was more significant in developing countries. However, the impact of economic factors on carbon emissions is inconsistent. For instance, Baiocchi et al. [10] and Uche et al. [11] found that increasing human capital would decrease carbon emissions of the United Kingdom. Besides, Wang and Su [12], Liu and Bae [13], and Ali et al. [14] discovered that the urbanization rate could significantly increase carbon emissions.\nSome scholars studied carbon emissions from the perspective of energy. Ohlan [15] used\nthe ARDL model and discovered that energy consumption would significantly increase India\u2019s carbon emissions. Xie [16] found that between 1992 and 2007, the main source of China\u2019s carbon emissions was investment-induced demand. Gross fixed capital formation, household consumption and exports together account for one-third of China\u2019s energy consumption annually. York [17] pointed out that the urbanization process of the European Union would increase energy consumption and eventually generated more carbon emissions. Similarly, Adesina and Mwamba [18] also established that countries with higher unemployment rates would use higher energy and ultimately increase carbon emissions. Therefore, replacing traditional fossil energy with renewable power source is one of the primary methods for governments to reduce carbon emissions. Research by Yao et al. [19] shows that a 10% increase in renewable energy consumption could reduce carbon emissions by 1.6%. The research of Sha et al. [20] and Zoundi [21] also verified this conclusion.\nDemographic is one of the factors attributed to carbon emissions. Baiocchi et al. [10] was the first to argue that socio-demographic variables are important in explaining carbon emissions. Zagheni [22] provided a methodological contribution to the study of the impact of population age structure on carbon emissions. Liddle and Lung [23] used the STIRPAT model to demonstrate that the impact of population on the environment varies greatly across different age groups. Similarly, Menz and Welsch [24] reached the same conclusion using 45 years of panel data from 26 countries. However, there is no unified conclusion on how the transition of population age structure affects the production of carbon emissions. Furthermore, Liang et al. [25] illustrated that the aging population was one of the inevitable results of the transformation of the population age structure. It is deemed that China would soon face a very serious aging population problem. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the impact of the aging population on China\u2019s carbon emissions.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290582 September 14, 2023 2 / 17\nFunding: The authors received no specific funding for this work.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nBased on the above research, this study aims to probe the regional impact of the aging pop-\nulation on carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve this purpose, this study utilizes the panel threshold regression (PTR). PTR adopts the idea of the segmented function, which can reflect more data information which is different from the traditional model. In addition, when studying the influence of independent variables on dependent variables, independent variables are generally difficult to be directly changed. However, PTR can study how the change of the threshold variable, affects the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable, without changing the independent variable. Therefore, this study can identify the unique threshold variable that affects different regions, so as to provide different recommendations for local governments.\nThe contributions of this study are as follows: first, the investigation verifies the non-linear\nrelationship between the aging population and carbon emissions in Eastern and Central China. Second, the scrutiny fills in the gaps in the regional differences impact of the aging population on carbon emissions in the same country and provides empirical literature for the following research on the impact of the aging population on carbon emissions. Third, the exploration uses the more advanced panel threshold regression to avoid possible structural changes in the data. Fourth, the result of the study determines plausible policy suggestions for China\u2019s regions that have higher carbon emissions.\nThe rest of this research study is arranged as follows: Section 2 reviews the related and latest\nresearch and puts forward hypotheses; Section 3 elaborates on the methodology and data processing and sources; Section 4 presents the empirical research and discussions; and the last section presents the empirical results and policy recommendations to the Chinese government."

            "text": "Wang and Li [26] found that the aging population would reduce carbon emissions through using panel data from 154 countries. Similarly, Dalton et al. [27] also found that the aging population would reduce carbon footprints. There are two main explanations for the aging population\u2019s suppression of carbon discharge. The first is from Tonn et al. [28], that the lifestyle of the elderly tended to be a low-carbon lifestyle; Yu et al. [29] found that older people were more inclined to use public transportation. The second is the explanation from Cole and Neumayer [30], that the main reason for the increase in carbon emissions was the surge in labor supply. Sun et al. [31] found that in countries with more aging populations, lower labor force participation rates reduced economic growth, and ultimately reduced carbon dioxide emissions. However, the findings of Rjoub et al. [32] showed a positive correlation between life expectancy and carbon emissions. The root cause of the aging population is the continuous decline in birth rate and increased life expectancy. Therefore, the research of Rjoub et al. [32] surmised that the aging population will escalate greenhouse gas emissions. Fan et al. [33] divided China into two parts, urban and rural. Both the urban and rural areas showed that the aging population would significantly increase carbon emissions. They believed that the reason for this conclusion was the continuous increase in income level and consumption demand. The results of Wang and Wang [34] showed that as the population ages, different income groups and carbon footprints were correlated differently. High-income groups would increase carbon emissions, but the relationship between low-income groups and acid gas emissions was an inverted Ushape. Besides, Liu et al. [35] and Meng and Han [36] found that population density also affected carbon emissions.\nThe above studies prove that the population age structure has become a new factor affecting\ncarbon dioxide emissions, but the impact of the population age structure on the emissions is inconsistent. The main reason for the inconsistencies in the findings of the previous scholars is\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290582 September 14, 2023 3 / 17\nthat they carried out their studies from different perspectives. In other words, when the academics study the impact of the population age structure on carbon emissions from the perspective of population quantity, the relationship between the two is often positive. When the research framework is studied from the perspective of population quality, the relationship between the two is often negatively correlated. In the early stage of the aging population, the number of young and old people seem to increase in tandem; but the increment is greater in the number of young people compared to the old people. Therefore, the impact of population quantity is greater than that of population quality. In contrast, for the later stage of the aging population, the increase in the number of young people is lower than the increase in the number of old people. Thusly, the impact of population quality is greater than that of population quantity. Based on that, this study puts forward the following hypothesis:\nH1o: the relationship between the aging population and carbon emission in Eastern and\nCentral China is linear.\nH1a: the relationship between the aging population and carbon emission in Eastern and\nCentral China is non-linear.\nKais and Sami [37] divided 58 countries into three regions and found an inverted U-\nshaped curve between carbon emissions and GDP per capita, which confirmed the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Li and Lin [38], correspondingly, used data from 73 countries and found that urbanization would increase and improved resource utilization, and ultimately reduced carbon emissions. However, cross-country research is difficult to help a country formulate policies to reduce carbon emissions, because the national conditions of different countries are quite different. Lenzen et al. [39] found that increasing income had different effects across countries. The research of Zhang and Zhuang [40] pointed out that the regional impact of human capital on economic growth is related to the level of economic development. Developed provinces benefit more from higher educated population, while less developed provinces rely more on people with primary and secondary education. Similarly, Wei [41] found that the initial stock of human capital had a huge and significant impact on the later accumulation of fixed assets. In fact, the initial stock of human capital in Eastern China is significantly larger than that in Central China. On that account, this study believes that the impact of human capital on different regions of China is different from one another. Zhang and Tan [42] confirmed for the first time in their research that the impact of the aging population on China\u2019s greenhouse gas present regional differences. However, when they measure the aging population, they only use the population ratio, and do not adopt a more advanced and accurate old dependency ratio. Besides that, they used the firstgeneration unit root and cointegration tests, but the first-generation tests ignore the crosssectional dependency problem. Thus, the results may be biased. Fan et al. [43] used the STIRPAT model to find that population had a large impact on CO2 emissions, especially within the proportion of the population aged 15\u201364. Moreover, as the level of economic development increases, the impact of per capita GDP growth on CO2 emissions showed an approximately decreasing trend. Mohmmed et al. [44] studied the ten countries with the largest carbon emissions in the world; and found that population and monetary earnings were the two major factors affecting carbon emissions in China, and the United States. However, though the income level boosted carbon emissions in some countries, it depressed them in others. Granados and Spash [45] found that unemployment depressed US carbon emissions. Xu et al. [46] found that import and export would increase China\u2019s carbon emissions. Based on this, this study puts forward the following hypothesis:\nH2o: the impact of the aging population in Eastern and Central China is the same. H2a: the impact of the aging population in Eastern and Central China is different.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290582 September 14, 2023 4 / 17"

The time length of the panel data used in this study is 18 years (2002 to 2019), with the inclusion of 19 regions in China (except Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Tibet).\nIn terms of carbon emissions, the data are from Carbon Emission Account & Datasets\n(CEADs). The CEADs provides open, transparent, and free data downloads, aiming to provide certain research conditions and data services for academic analyzers in the field of climate change and to promote the openness and sharing of scientific research. The data were collected and calculated by the research of Shan et al. [47], Shan et al. [48], Shan et al. [49], and Guan et al. [50].\nThe old dependency ratio, within the research, is calculated by dividing the population over\nthe age of 65 by the population aged 15 to 64. The calculation method of trade openness is the total amount of import and export trade divided by GDP, and trade openness is the threshold variable. The old dependency ratio is calculated by dividing the number of urban residents by the number of the total population.\nDifferent scholars divide China\u2019s regions in different ways. For example, Zou et al. [51] and\nWang et al. [52] directly divides China into two parts: urban and rural. Yet, this classification method is outdated and not suitable for the study of the aging population. It is because China already has a relatively high urbanization rate, and the urbanization rate in some developed areas is as high as 80%. There are also some scholars such as Liu et al. [53], and Meng and Han [36], who only study one region of China (Northwest and Shanghai). However, China has vast territories, and the results of one region cannot fully reflect the situation of the whole country.\nIn Table 2, this study refers to the classification standard of the National Bureau of Statistics\nof China, and divides the 19 regions into Eastern and Central divisions. There are three main reasons for this classification. First, from the perspective of economic development, since the implementation of China\u2019s Reform and Opening up in 1978, the economic development of Eastern China is significantly higher than that of Central China. Second, from the perspective of human resource, the regressive development of education in Central China leads to the quality of the labor force being generally lower than that in Eastern China; Third, from the perspective of economic structure, manufacturing and services account for a higher share of GDP in Eastern China, but Central China is still dependent on the agricultural economy."

Therefore, from the perspective of level data, the variables are unstable. Nevertheless, after differencing the data, all variables are significant at the 1% level. Therefore, all variables are also stable in Central China.\nTable 4 shows the outcomes of the cointegration test.

The difference is that Eastern China is on the left side of the curve, while Central China is on the right side. Wang et al. [52] believes that the main reason for this situation is that there is a lot of heavy industry in Eastern China. Thus, for Eastern China, relocating heavy industry or improving energy efficiency are important ways to reduce carbon emissions. Third, since the LIL of Eastern and Central China is statistically significant at the 5% level, improving educational attainment can decrease per capita carbon emissions. Research of Zafar et al. [66] and Shobande and Simplice [67] determines that education reduces carbon emissions in two main ways. First, education can improve citizens\u2019 awareness of environmental protection. Second, education can achieve sustainable green economic development.\nFor the differences of the two regions: First, the threshold variable is different. For Eastern\nChina, the threshold variable is trade openness, and the turning point is 3.2400 (25.53%). When the trade openness is less than 3.2400, the coefficient of LODR is -0.5925; When the trade openness is larger than 3.2400, the LODR\u2019s coefficient is -0.4188. Since both two coefficients are significant at the 1% level, from the perspective of reducing per capita carbon emissions, the government of Eastern China should keep the trade openness below 25.53%. The conclusion is the same with the research finding of Dou et al. [68]. Nevertheless, for Central China, the threshold variable is the total population, and the flexion is 8.1400 (34.29 million people). When the total population is on the left side of flexion, the coefficient of LODR is 0.4066; when the total population is on the right side of flexion, the LODR\u2019s coefficient is 0.5675. However, when the LPPL is less than 8.1400 and the LODR\u2019s coefficient becomes insignificant, this study cannot determine the correlation between the aging population and per capita carbon emissions in this range. Thus, the government of Central China should keep their total population above 34.29 million people.\nSecond, in terms of the urbanization rate, it is insignificant in Eastern China but significant in Central China. In other words, only by increasing the urbanization rate can the per capita carbon emissions in Central China be reduced. Xu [69]\u2019s study showed that the higher the population density, the lower the per capita greenhouse gas emissions. Eastern China is highly developed and densely populated, so there is no statistical relationship between urbanization rates and carbon emissions. For Central China, increasing urbanization could make the population more concentrated, thus increasing the use of public transport and reducing carbon emissions per person.\nThird, the impact of total population changes on per capita carbon emissions in Eastern\nChina is indeterminate. Whereas increasing trade openness can effectively reduce Central China\u2019s per capita carbon emissions.\nTable 8 presents robustness outcome. During the robustness test, the old dependency ratio\nis replaced by the percentage of elderly population. Other than that, all parameters, variables, and methods are unchanged. The robustness results show that the symbols of all variable coefficients and the values of the threshold variables do not change, except for the coefficients of variables which change slightly. The results confirm the non-linear relationship between the aging population and carbon emissions in Eastern and Central China."

In other words, the correlation between the aging population and per capita carbon emissions is non-linear. Besides, for Eastern China, the authorities there should keep the trade openness below 25.53% because it is the optimum interval, from a reducing carbon emissions perspective. Nevertheless, for Central China, governments should limit the total population to over 34.29 million.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290582 September 14, 2023 11 / 17\nSecondly, the EKC hypothesis is suitable in Eastern and Central China, and the turning\npoint is 12.17, and 9.62, respectively. This outcome indicates that all of Eastern China did not arrive at the inflexion whilst the Central China was on the right side of the inflexion. However, some regions of Central China crossed the turning point in 2007, and some made the turning point crossing in 2008. Thus, for Eastern China, per capita carbon emissions will still increase with economic development, but for Central China, per capita carbon emissions will decrease with economic expansion.\nThirdly, improving educational attainment can effectively decrease per capita CO2 emissions.\nImproving the education level has been identified as a potential means to reduce carbon emissions for two key reasons. One, higher education levels are associated with an increased awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development among individuals. Educated individuals are more likely to understand the importance of environmental conservation and adopt environmentally friendly behaviors. For instance, they may choose to use public transportation, carpool, or engage in other low-carbon transportation options; thereby reducing carbon emissions from individual transportation activities. Two, higher education levels contribute to the development and application of sustainable technologies. Wang et al. [70] presented that intellectual people are more likely to engage in research and development activities, leading to the creation of new technologies and solutions aimed at reducing carbon footprint. For instance, research findings of Shobande [71] and Shobande and Lawrence [72] indicate that enhancing technological innovation, especially, information and communication technology can be an effective way to reduce carbon emissions. Thus, by improving education levels, societies can enhance environmental awareness, promote sustainable behaviors, and facilitate the adoption of innovative technologies. These combined efforts can contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions and support the transition towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious society."

At the same time, Central China should introduce more policies to attract import and export companies to settle there, such as reducing land lease funds and building better, easily accessible transportation infrastructure.\nSecondly, the governments of Eastern and Central China should invest heavily in educa-\ntion. People who are more educated tend to have stronger awareness of protecting the environment, especially during their teenage years. In addition, these people are at ease in using public transportation. Being educated also means they are learned to manipulate high-tech machines that can improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing carbon emissions. In addition, higher educational attainment is conducive to the development and use of scientific research and technology.\nThirdly, the governments of Eastern China should increase the urbanization rate. Winter in\nNorthern China is very cold, and the government provides central heating. This policy increases energy efficiency and reduces energy usage. However, because this arrangement requires pipes and other infrastructure, central heating is hard to come by in rural areas. Therefore, rural residents need to keep themselves warm by burning coal, wood or turning on air heater. Consequently, those methods release a large amount of carbon dioxide into the air. Hence, increasing the urbanization rate can reduce carbon emissions and improve the quality of life for people in the interior areas.\nFourth, the governments of Central China should control the total population. A larger\npopulation often correlates with higher energy consumption and increased economic activity, resulting in elevated carbon emissions. Moreover, population growth can drive changes in consumer demand and consumption patterns, potentially leading to greater resource utilization and carbon emissions. This effect is particularly noticeable when individuals prefer goods and services associated with high carbon footprints. Thus, by reducing the total population, the strain on resources and the environment can be eased, leading to a reduction in greenhouse effects and a more sustainable trajectory for the region."

            "text": "This study has several limitations. Firstly, Dou et al. [68] study indicated that import and export exercise will produce different issues in carbon emissions. Any further studies taken will carry out research on the impact of China\u2019s imports and exports of the different regions on carbon dioxide emissions respectively and consider the heterogeneity of the regions. Secondly, influenced by traditional culture, some Chinese people have a serious preference for boys over girls. Hence, the gender ratio in China is slightly unbalanced. Xinping et al. [73] finding pointed out that gender difference would have a significant impact on China\u2019s economy. Therefore, the subsequent study will explore the impact of gender differences on China\u2019s carbon emissions. In addition, this study mainly discusses the impact of demographic factors on carbon dioxide emissions. In the future research, this study will refer to the research of Makhdum et al. [74], Li et al. [75], Simionescu and Cifuentes-Faura [76], and Wang et al. [77] to discuss clean energy and its impact on carbon dioxide emission, as well as how to achieve sustainable development in the long term for China."
