    "abstractText": "Landauer\u2019s principle gives a fundamental limit to the thermodynamic cost of erasing information. Its saturation requires a reversible isothermal process, and hence infinite time. We develop a finite-time version of Landauer\u2019s principle for a bit encoded in the occupation of a single fermionic mode, which can be strongly coupled to a reservoir. By solving the exact nonequilibrium dynamics, we optimize erasure processes (taking both the fermion\u2019s energy and system-bath coupling as control parameters) in the slow driving regime through a geometric approach to thermodynamics. We find analytic expressions for the thermodynamic metric and geodesic equations, which can be solved numerically. Their solution yields optimal processes that allow us to characterize a finitetime correction to Landauer\u2019s bound, fully taking into account strong coupling effects. Our result suggests the emergence of the Planckian time, \u03c4Pl = \u0127/kBT , as the shortest timescale for information erasure.",

Its saturation requires a reversible isothermal process, and hence infinite time. We develop a finite-time version of Landauer\u2019s principle for a bit encoded in the occupation of a single fermionic mode, which can be strongly coupled to a reservoir. By solving the exact nonequilibrium dynamics, we optimize erasure processes (taking both the fermion\u2019s energy and system-bath coupling as control parameters) in the slow driving regime through a geometric approach to thermodynamics. We find analytic expressions for the thermodynamic metric and geodesic equations, which can be solved numerically. Their solution yields optimal processes that allow us to characterize a finitetime correction to Landauer\u2019s bound, fully taking into account strong coupling effects. Our result suggests the emergence of the Planckian time, \u03c4Pl = \u210f/kBT , as the shortest timescale for information erasure."

            "text": "Any logical irreversible operation that will incur a thermodynamic cost in the form of heat dissipated into the environment. Landauer\u2019s principle quantifies this relation between information processing and thermodynamics with the bound Q \u2265 kBT ln 2 for the erasure of a single bit of information [1]. Here Q is the dissipated heat, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature at which the process is taking place. In recent years, this principle has been intensively studied within the fields of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics [2\u201317], and has been approached in several experimental platforms [18\u2013 29]. Alberto Rolandi: alberto.rolandi@unige.ch Mart\u00ed Perarnau-Llobet: marti.perarnaullobet@unige.ch\nThe unattainability principle suggests that Landauer\u2019s bound cannot be saturated with finite resources, namely time and energy [30\u201332]. In finite time, using tools from optimal transport theory [33\u201335] and thermodynamic geometry [36\u201343], optimal erasure protocols have been derived both for classical systems described by overdamped Langevin dynamics [44\u201348] and open quantum systems described by Lindblad master equations [35, 49\u201354]. Such optimal protocols naturally lead to a finite-time correction to Landauer\u2019s bound in different physical set-ups, which has given rise to the term finite-time Landauer principle [45, 48, 52]. For a slowly driven (quantum) two-level system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, the finite-time bound takes the simple form (see App. B.2 and Refs. [50, 54])\nQ \u2265 kBT ( ln 2 + \u03c0 2\n4\u0393\u03c4\n) + O ( 1 \u03932\u03c42 ) , (1)\nwhere \u03c4 is the total time of the process and \u0393 is the thermalization rate. The finite-time correction is positive, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics, and when \u0393\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e we recover the standard bound. We also note that the optimal protocol saturating the finite bound eq. (1) has been recently implemented in a semiconductor quantum dot [29]. More general versions of eq. (1) have also been recently developed for Markovian systems driven at any speed [35, 51, 52].\nDespite this remarkable progress, previous works on the finite-time Landauer principle have focused in Markovian systems which, for quantum systems, can be guaranteed by a sufficiently weak interaction between system and bath. In the presence of strong coupling [55\u201359], we expect both new opportunities arising due to faster relaxation rates and non-Markovian dynamics [60\u2013 67], as well as challenges due to the presence of new sources of irreversibility [68\u201375].

Our main result is summarised in what follows:\nMain result\nGiven a two-level system that can be strongly coupled to a thermal bath, we find that the finite-time version of Landauer\u2019s principle can be expressed as\nQ \u2265 kBT (\nln 2 + a\u03c4Pl \u03c4\n) + O ( 1 \u03932\u03c42 ) (2)\nwhere a \u2248 2.57946, \u03c4Pl = \u210f/kBT is the so-called Planckian time [84], and \u0393 is the average thermalization rate (see details below). This extends eq. (1) to strong system-bath couplings, with the transition between the two being characterized in Fig. 2. The finite-time correction in eq. (2) is of quantum-mechanical nature and independent of the coupling strength, hence prevailing even for arbitrarily strong system-bath coupling (roughly speaking, \u0393 \u2192 \u221e in eq. (1)).\nThe appearance of the Planckian time \u03c4Pl = \u210f/kBT in eq. (2) is particularly interesting.This timescale encodes two fundamental constants in nature: Boltzmann\u2019s constant kB and Planck\u2019s constant \u210f. It arises in several contexts in manybody physics, including quantum transport and quantum chaos; see Ref. [84] for a review. In analogy with the \u201cPlanck time\u201d in quantum gravity, it is associated with the shortest timescale of thermalization [84\u201387]; that is, the shortest time needed to redistribute energy between particles and reach thermal equilibrium. This gives an insightful context to our main result eq. (2): a fundamental finite-time quantum correction must appear to Landauer\u2019s bound due to a minimal time required for thermalization. This also suggests that the form of eq. (2) has a broader range of applicability, with the value a depending on the specific many-body thermalizing dynamics considered.\nIn order to obtain eq. (2), we exploit the framework of thermodynamic geometry [36\u201342], which has proven successful to devise minimally dissi-\npative processes both in classical [40, 88\u201394] and quantum systems [12, 50, 95\u201399]."

The state \u03c1(t) of SB evolves as \u03c1(t) = U(t)\u03c1(0)U \u2020(t) with U(t) = T exp(\u2212 i\u210f \u222b t 0 ds H(s)).

The entropy production \u03a3 \u2265 0 accounts for the irreversible energetic contribution in finite-time processes, and depends on the particular driving path H(t) linking H(0) to H(\u03c4). Minimising \u03a3 over all finite-time processes leads to thermodynamic protocols that minimize the work W . Furthermore, in an erasure process, \u2206ES = 0 (see details below) therefore these protocols also minimize the dissipated heat Q."

(3) as H(t) = \u2211 j \u03bbj(t)Xj where {\u03bbj(t)} are the externally controllable parameters and {Xj} are the corresponding observables. In order to apply the geometric approach, we need to impose more structure on the possible evolutions U(t) generated by eq. (3). We require two basic ingredients: Requirement 1: Thermalization. In absence of driving, the conjugated observables Xj thermalize. More precisely, for a frozen Hamiltonian H(t), we have\nlim s\u2192\u221e\nTr[U\u0303t(s)\u03c1(0)U\u0303 \u2020t (s)Xj ] = \u27e8Xj(t)\u27e9eq, (7)\nwhere U\u0303t(s) \u2261 e\u2212iH(t)s, \u27e8Xj(t)\u27e9eq = Tr[\u03c9\u03b2(t)Xj ], \u03c9\u03b2(t) = e\u2212\u03b2H(t)/Z(t), and \u03b2 is implicitly defined by the initial energy of the total system. In the context considered here, namely purely unitary dynamics of SB, this condition is satisfied both by non-integrable systems satisfying the ETH hypothesis [101, 102] and also for integrable systems typically appearing in open quantum systems [103\u2013106]. Requirement 2: Slow driving, so that the system remains close to the instantaneous equilibrium state while being driven. This enables us to keep only leading terms when making a linearresponse expansion in the driving speed [107], which can be expressed as:\n\u27e8Xj(t)\u27e9 = \u27e8Xj(t)\u27e9eq + \u2211\ni\nmij \u03bb\u0307i(t) + ... (8)\nThe coefficients mij , which depend on the point {\u03bbi(t)}, can in principle be derived from the exact equations of motion. We should note that it is well known that optimal finite-time protocols feature jumps [108]. However, these jumps disappear near the reversible limit (see App. E and [109]) and their contribution to the dissipated heat becomes negligible. Therefore this requirement becomes a natural assumption in the context of finding a first order correction to Landauer\u2019s bound.\nCombining the expansion of eq. (8) with eq. (4) and eq. (6), we obtain the standard expression for\nentropy production at leading order in the inverse of the driving speed [37, 40, 42]:\nkBT\u03a3 = \u2211 ij \u222b \u03c4 0 dt \u03bb\u0307i(t)mij(t)\u03bb\u0307j(t) (9)\nwhere, in contrast to previous works, the metric mij depends on the unitary dynamics of SB (this will later be solved for a specific model). Because of the second law of thermodynamics, it follows that mij can be expressed as a metric, i.e., a symmetric, positive-definite m \u2265 0 operator that depends smoothly on the point {\u03bbi(t)}. We can associate a length to a protocol by defining L = \u222b \u03c4 0 dt \u221a\u2211 ij \u03bb\u0307i(t)mij(t)\u03bb\u0307j(t). It is related to the entropy production via a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality [37, 40, 42]:\nkBT\u03a3 \u2265 1 \u03c4 L2 , (10)\nwhere equality is satisfied by protocols with constant entropy production rate\u2211\nij \u03bb\u0307i(t)mij(t)\u03bb\u0307j(t). Furthermore, to minimize the entropy production of any (slow) protocol we have to find the shortest path between the desired initial and final value of the Hamiltonian\u2019s parameters. This corresponds to a geodesic path, with length L, which naturally defines a minimal entropy production\nkBT\u03a3min = 1 \u03c4 L2 . (11)\nWe can find \u03a3min by solving the geodesic equation that is derived from the metric and computing its length [37, 40, 42]."

The energy \u03b5 is the difference between the energy of the two-level system and the chemical potential of the bath1. We are assuming optimal control over the functions \u03b5(t) and g(t) so that we can fully optimize the protocol and reach the fundamental limit for this system. While this level of control is, in principle, ambitious experimentally in regards to the coupling, it has been achieved in quantum dots [110] where the tunneling rate (i.e. interaction strength) can be modified by several orders of magnitude. We take the continuum limit and assume that the spectral density of the bath is a Lorentzian\nJ(\u03c9) = \u039b 2\n\u039b2 + \u03c92 , (13)\nwhere \u039b > 0 is a parameter characterizing its width. Exact and explicit solutions for the resonant-level model are known in the wide-band limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e [76\u201382]. This limit is commonly used to describe quantum systems in contact with fermionic macroscopic baths, e.g. in quantum dots or single-molecule junctions [111, 112]. In essence, it neglects the structure of the density of states in the bath and, as a consequence, a main limitation is that it fails to describe the shorttime dynamics [112]. Nevertheless, this problem does not affect this study since we are interested in large times. We should further note that the energy of the system-bath interaction is proportional to \u039b, and therefore is divergent in this limit. We will therefore take \u039b to be finite but much larger than any other energy scale of the system. For our analysis to be valid we simply require dynamics much slower than \u039b\u22121 [76].\nThe dynamics are solved via a quantum Langevin approach, which is detailed in App. A (see also [62, 83]).

(17)\nFrom the exact solutions for p(t) and v(t), in App. A we show that Requirement 1 is satisfied, and hence W = \u2206F in the quasistatic limit. For slow but finite-time processes, we perform a slow driving expansion of eq. (14) and eq.

Therefore we will compare the results one obtains in slow driving and the results of [51, 52] to the exact minimization of [109].\nWe are interested in erasure processes, where \u03b5(t) is driven from2 \u03b5(0) = 0 to \u03b5(\u03c4) = \u03b5\u2217 with \u03b5\u2217 \u226b kBT in a time \u03c4 .

In App. E we prove why the jumps should also disappear in the long times limit at strong coupling. As detailed in App. B.2, and also discussed in previous references [50], the optimal driving solution in this limit has the simple analytical form\n\u03b5(t) = 2\u03b2\u22121 ln tan [ \u03c0 4 (t/\u03c4 + 1) ] , (28)\nleading to the work cost\nW = kBT ( ln 2 + \u03c0 2\n4\u03c4\u0393\n) , (29)\nfrom where we can directly recover eq.

For completeness, we also show recent results of [51, 52]. These results apply more generally to any Markovian master equation (here we apply them to the particular case of eq. (27)), and one can see that they provide a bound to the exact numerical (and approximate analytical) solutions."

            "text": "We now focus on erasure outside of any approximation, where we will optimize the driving over both the energy and coupling. In what follows, we focus on minimising \u03a3 in an erasure process, which imposes specific boundary conditions to the geodesic equations. We assume that we have no prior knowledge of the system, therefore its initial state is \u03c1S(0) = 1/2. This translates in taking \u03b5(0) = 0 so that it coincides with the thermal state of HS . For the qubit to be erased we want its final state to be \u03c1S(\u03c4) \u2248 |0\u27e9\u27e80| (i.e. p(\u03c4) \u2248 0). Since the driving is done slowly, p(t) is always close to its thermal expectation value. Therefore by choosing \u03b2\u03b5(\u03c4) \u2192 \u221e we ensure p(\u03c4) \u2248 04. For the coupling, the boundary conditions are \u00b5(0) = \u00b5(\u03c4) = 0, because we want to think of this as an \u201cerasure machine\u201d that the qubit is \u201cbrought to\u201d at the start and \u201cretrieved from\u201d at the end. Given this family of protocols, we recognise from eq. (6) that W = kBT (ln 2 + \u03a3), and similarly Q = kBT (ln 2 + \u03a3), thus justifying the minimisation of \u03a3 as given in eq. (9). After the qubit has been decoupled (i.e. at t > \u03c4), we bring the Hamiltonian of the system back to its starting value (\u03b5 = 0) to close the cycle. Since p(\u03c4) \u2248 0,\n4Strictly speaking, in order to ensure consistency with the slow driving limit, \u03b2\u03b5(\u03c4) has to remain finite (so that the speed \u03bb\u0307 remain finite). However, the final population p(\u03c4) is exponentially small with \u03b2\u03b5(\u03c4), leading to exponentially small corrections. Our results are valid up to such corrections, and for sufficiently large \u03c4 to ensure the validity of the approximation.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 6\nthis step requires no work, and it can be done arbitrarily quickly.\nThe geodesic equations we obtain for this process are not solvable analytically. The integral of eq. (18) can be solved to give us an expression of the metric in terms of polygamma functions (cf. App. B) but it does not simplify the geodesic equations into an analytically solvable form. We therefore turn to numerical tools to obtain the optimal protocol and compute the the dissipated work. Though, in our case, we want to impose the aforementioned boundary conditions; this is known as a Boundary Value Problem (BVP), which is famously hard to solve numerically [114]. Though we can use the fact that the high temperature limit is accurate at the start of an erasure protocol, therefore the initial conditions of the optimal protocol for erasure will match the initial conditions of eq. (21) and eq. (22). This allows us to turn the BVP into an Initial Value Problem (cf. App. G) which is much simpler to solve.\nIn Fig. 2 we show optimal erasure protocols in the (\u00b5, \u03b5) space for different final values of \u03b2\u03b5. We can notice that the predictions of the high and low temperature limit are verified: at the start of the protocols the coupling is increased but once we reach a certain value there is no more need to increase it, regardless of the final value of \u03b2\u03b5 we try to reach. Interestingly, the maximal value reached by \u03b2\u00b5 is larger than 1. This shows that reaching the strong coupling is needed to achieve optimal erasure, which is one of the main insights of our work. In the same figure we also show the value of \u03c4\u03a3min/\u03b2 for the optimal protocol as a function of the final energy.\nWe can see that for small values of \u03b2\u03b5(\u03c4) eq. (23) gives an accurate description of the work cost, but as we reach higher values it saturates around \u03c4\u03a3min/\u03b2 = 2.57946 \u00b1 1 \u00b7 10\u22125 [\u210f]. This provides a finite-time correction to Landauer\u2019s principle in this set-up, thus leading to a generalisation of eq. (1):\nQ \u2265 kBT (\nln 2 + a\u03c4Pl \u03c4\n) + O ( 1 \u03932\u03c42 ) . (30)\nwith a \u2248 2.57946 and \u03c4Pl = \u03b2\u210f. This is one of the main results of this work and can be seen as a generalization of eq. (1). As opposed to the results of [51] and [52], eq. (30) is only valid for large protocol times; yet, it has the advantage of taking into account strong coupling effects (including any possible variation of the coupling strength), having a much simpler form for the correction (which is independent of any chosen relaxation timescale), and we provide an explicit protocol to achieve it. By turning around eq. (30) one can highlight a quantum speed limit for erasure of a qubit, furthermore this speed limit is of the order of the Planckian time \u03c4Pl = \u210f/kBT which is conjectured to be the fastest relaxation timescale for thermalization [84]. In particular, one can see that eq. (30) bounds the speed of erasure by the order of \u03c4Pl regardless of how large is the coupling strength used in the protocol.\nInterestingly, we now argue that the form of the correction eq. (30) is in fact general of any Landauer erasure protocol with control on S and the SB coupling. Indeed, first note that the geodesic length L is dimensionless and can only depend on \u03b2 and the boundary conditions as we optimize over \u00b5 and \u03b5. In an erasure process, the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 7\nboundary conditions read: \u03b5(0) = 0, \u03b5(\u03c4) \u2192 \u221e, and \u00b5i(0) = \u00b5i(\u03c4) = 0 where i runs over all the possible control parameters on SB. But this implies that L is independent of them and hence of \u03b2. Therefore kBT\u03a3min will take the form of a constant, independent of any parameter of the system and bath, divided by \u03c4 . This is a crucial difference from eq. (1).\nThis simple argument based on dimensional analysis thus shows that eq. (30) is rather general, with the value of a depending on the specific implementation (e.g. the ohmicity of the bath). It is important to highlight that the bound eq. (30) implies that, even when having access to arbitrary strong SB interactions (naively taking \u0393 \u2192 \u221e in eq. (1)), infinite time is still required for perfect erasure due to the quantum-mechanical correction derived here.\nFinally, we analyze a scenario where the coupling is kept constant while \u03b5(t) is driven, which is motivated both by experimental set-ups and for a comparison with the weakly interacting case. Therefore, we restrict to one-parameter protocols consisting of the three following steps: 1. while keeping \u03b5 at 0 we turn on the coupling to some value \u00b5\u2217; 2. while keeping the coupling fixed we bring \u03b5 from 0 to some value \u03b5\u2217 \u226b kBT ; 3. while keeping \u03b5 constant we turn off the coupling. Each step contributes positively to the entropy production, and its minimisation is discussed in App. F. In Fig. 2, we show \u03a3min for different values of \u00b5\u2217, ranging from the weak to the super-strong coupling regime. It can be appreciated how eq. (1) breaks down, and also how such one-parameter protocols become close to the fundamental limit eq. (30) for \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 > 1."

            "heading": "6 Conclusions and outlook",
            "text": "Deriving finite-time corrections to the seminal Landauer bound is a challenging endeavour in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics [35, 44\u2013 54]. Previous works have focused on markovian systems only, which in the quantum regime is obtained through the weak coupling limit (\u03b2g2 \u2192 0). However, should a general finite-time correction exist, it will require the presence of strong coupling at some point during the process as the dissipation generated in finite time is propor-\ntional to g\u22122 when g is small5. Motivated by this observation, we have developed new insights into the form of optimal protocols for erasure beyond the weak coupling limit.\nWe have focused on a bit encoded in the occupation of a single fermionic mode, which can be strongly coupled to a reservoir. We have derived analytically the thermodynamic metric, which governs the dissipation rate in the slow driving regime, and showed that it takes a simple form in the high and low temperature limits. From the general form of the metric we obtained the optimal erasure protocol, which requires increasing the coupling strength to g2 \u223c kBT , which corresponds to a relaxation timescale of the order of the Planckian time \u03c4Pl. The corresponding dissipation yields a finite-time correction to Landauer\u2019s bound for this setup, which is substantially lower than similar results in the weak coupling regime. Furthermore, by using the obtained bound as a quantum speed limit, this result adds further evidence to the conjecture [84] that \u03c4Pl is fastest relaxation timescale many-body systems can achieve.\nWhile our results were derived in a fermionic model there are some general insights that follow from our work. First there is a fundamental quantum correction that prevails, see eq. (30), which can be compared with eq. (1) derived in the weak coupling regime. While the specific value of a in eq. (30) will depend on the specific setup, it will never approach 0 (even for diverging system-bath coupling) due to the inherent cost of changing the interaction strength. Furthermore, to obtain these results we adapted the framework of thermodynamic geometry to system-bath unitary dynamics in which the coupling can be arbitrarily large or small. This is in contrast to recent claims of failure of this approach in closed quantum systems [115]. Finally, as was argued before, our results make evident the need of strong coupling in a general finite-time correction to Landauer\u2019s principle.\nThis work opens exciting directions for the future. On the one hand, the level of experimental control required to implement such protocols is in principle possible in quantum dots [116\u2013119],\n5This can be seen by expanding the finite time dissipation around g2 = 0 for long times: kBT \u03a3 \u221d 1/g2\u03c4 , which follows by noticing that the relaxation time-scale is of the order of g\u22122.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 8\nwhere the energy-level \u03b5(t) and coupling g(t) can be independently controlled, even by several orders of magnitude [110]. On the other hand, it would be interesting to characterise the dependence of a in the nature of the bath and the SB coupling (e.g. its spectral density), more generally to derive similar quantum-mechanical finitetime corrections that are independent of the specific implementation, and to gain further insights in the connection between Landauer erasure and the Planckian time.\nAcknowledgments.

            "text": "A.1 Solving the Heisenberg equations We consider a single fermionic mode coupled to a fermionic bath. Without loss of generality we can set the chemical potential to 0 and the ground state of the two-level system to 0. The Hamiltonians of the system and bath are\nH\u0302S(t) = \u03b5(t)a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 , (31)\nH\u0302B = n\u2211\nk=1 \u03c9k b\u0302\n\u2020 k b\u0302k , (32)\nwhere a\u0302\u2020 is the creation operator of the two-level system and b\u0302\u2020k is the creation operator of a bath mode with frequency \u03c9k. These ladder operators follow the canonical anticommutation relations. For the interaction between system and bath, the Hamiltonian is\nH\u0302int(t) = g(t)V\u0302 = g(t) n\u2211\nk=1 \u03bbka\u0302\n\u2020b\u0302k + \u03bb\u2217k b\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302 , (33)\nwhere the \u03bbk are the interaction weights.\nWill will consider that \u03b5(t) and g(t) are the control parameters to then perform the erasure of information in the single mode of the system. We now proceed to solve the dynamics of the system and bath in the Heisenberg picture. For an operator A\u0302 in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, we denote by A\u0302H(t) the corresponding operator in the the Heisenberg picture. The evolution of A\u0302H(t) is defined by the Heisenberg equation of motion:\nd dt A\u0302H(t) = i\n[ H\u0302(t), A\u0302H(t) ] , (34)\nwhere H\u0302(t) = H\u0302S(t) + H\u0302int(t) + H\u0302B and \u210f = 1. Applying this equation to the ladder operators a\u0302H(t) and b\u0302k,H(t) we find the following system of n+ 1 equations:\nd dt a\u0302H(t) = \u2212i\u03b5(t)a\u0302H(t) \u2212 ig(t) \u2211 k \u03bbk b\u0302k,H(t) , (35)\nd dt b\u0302k,H(t) = \u2212i\u03c9k b\u0302k,H(t) \u2212 ig(t)\u03bb\u2217ka\u0302H(t) . (36)\nBy defining u\u0302k(t) = ei\u03c9ktb\u0302k,H(t) we can see that eq. (36) becomes\ne\u2212i\u03c9kt d\ndt u\u0302k(t) = \u2212ig(t)\u03bb\u2217ka\u0302H(t) ,\nwhich is solved by u\u0302k(t) = u\u0302k(0) \u2212 i\u03bb\u2217k \u222b t 0 ds e i\u03c9ksg(s)a\u0302H(s). We therefore find\nb\u0302k,H(t) = e\u2212i\u03c9ktb\u0302k \u2212 i\u03bb\u2217k \u222b t\n0 ds g(s)a\u0302H(s)ei\u03c9k(s\u2212t) , (37)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 13\nwhere we used that u\u0302k(0) = b\u0302k,H(0) = b\u0302k. Therefore\n\u2211 k \u03bbk b\u0302k,H(t) = \u03be\u0302(t) \u2212 i \u222b t 0 ds \u03c7(s\u2212 t)g(s)a\u0302H(s) , (38)\nwhere we defined the noise operator \u03be\u0302(t) = \u2211\nk e \u2212i\u03c9kt\u03bbk b\u0302k and \u03c7(t) = \u2211 k e\ni\u03c9kt|\u03bbk|2. We can notice that \u03c7(t) is the (symmetrized) noise correlation function:\u2329{\n\u03be\u0302\u2020(t), \u03be\u0302(0) }\u232a = \u2211 j,k ei\u03c9kt\u03bb\u2217k\u03bbj \u2329{ b\u0302\u2020k, b\u0302j }\u232a = \u2211 k ei\u03c9kt|\u03bbk|2 = \u03c7(t) ,\nand its Fourier transform is the (unit-less) spectral density of the bath J(\u03c9) = 2\u03c0 \u2211\nk |\u03bbk|2\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9k) By inserting eq. (38) into equation eq. (35) we find an equation of motion for a\u0302H(t):\nd dt a\u0302H(t) = \u2212i\u03b5(t)a\u0302H(t) \u2212 ig(t)\u03be\u0302(t) \u2212 g(t) \u222b t 0 ds \u03c7(s\u2212 t)g(s)a\u0302H(s) . (39)\nIn order to solve eq. (39) we will need to explicitly take the continuum limit so that our bath indeed becomes a bath. We can take its spectral density to be either a Lorentzian J(\u03c9) = \u039b2\u039b2+\u03c92 or a pass-band J(\u03c9) = \u0398(\u039b \u2212 |\u03c9|) (\u0398 is the Heaviside step function). We will need to assume that we are working in the wide-band approximation (\u039b \u2192 \u221e). More practically, we are assuming that the bath interaction is the same over the energies we are spanning with the system. This limit allows us to say that the noise correlation function is negligible for time differences larger than zero:\nlim \u039b\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e \u03c7(t) = \u03b4(t) .\nIn this limit eq. (39) becomes considerably simpler:\nd dt a\u0302H(t) = \u2212 ( i\u03b5(t) + 12g(t) 2 ) a\u0302H(t) \u2212 ig(t)\u03be\u0302(t) . (40)\nSimilarly to how we solved eq. (36), we define u\u0302(t) = exp [\u222b t 0 z(s)ds ] a\u0302H(t) for z(t) := i\u03b5(t) + 12g(t)\n2. Now we have\ne\u2212 \u222b t 0 z(s)ds d\ndt u\u0302(t) = \u2212ig(t)\u03be\u0302(t) ,\nwhich is solved by u\u0302(t) = u\u0302(0) \u2212 i \u222b t 0 ds g(s) exp [ \u222b s\n0 z(r)dr] \u03be\u0302(s). We therefore find the solution of the evolution of the ladder operator of the distinguished mode:\na\u0302H(t) = G(t, 0)a\u0302\u2212 i \u222b t\n0 ds g(s)G(t, s)\u03be\u0302(s) (41)\nwhere we defined the propagator G(t, s) = exp [ \u2212 \u222b t s z(r)dr ]\n. And from eq. (37) we find the solution for the bath modes:\nb\u0302k,H(t) = e\u2212i\u03c9ktb\u0302k \u2212i\u03bb\u2217k \u222b t\n0 ds g(s)G(s, 0)a\u0302ei\u03c9k(s\u2212t)\u2212\u03bb\u2217k \u222b t 0 ds \u222b s 0 dr g(s)g(r)G(s, r)\u03be\u0302(r)ei\u03c9k(s\u2212t) . (42)\nA.2 Relevant observables\nSince we are performing an erasure, we will assume the system starts in a factorized state and that the bath starts in a thermal state at inverse temperature \u03b2 state with respect to its Hamiltonian:\n\u03c1\u0302(0) = \u03c1\u0302S(0) \u2297 e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302B\nZB , ZB = Tr[e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302B ] .\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 14\nWe are interested in computing the occupation probability of the excited level p(t) = \u27e8a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\u27e9 and the system-bath interaction potential v(t) = \u27e8V\u0302 \u27e9. From eq. (41) we have\np(t) = Tr [ \u03c1\u0302(0)a\u0302\u2020H(t)a\u0302H(t) ] = |G(t, 0)|2 p(0) + \u222b t 0 dsdr g(s)g(r)G\u2217(t, s)G(t, r)Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2HB ZB \u03be\u0302\u2020(s)\u03be\u0302(r) ] ,\n(43) where we used the CAR to get Tr[a\u0302\u2020\u03be\u0302(s)] = 0 and drop the cross terms. Further using the CAR we simplify the remaining trace in the integral:\nTr [ e\u2212\u03b2HB\nZB \u03be\u0302\u2020(s)\u03be\u0302(r)\n] = \u2211\nk\nei\u03c9k(s\u2212r)|\u03bbk|2Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2HB\nZB b\u0302\u2020k b\u0302k\n] = \u2211\nk\nei\u03c9k(r\u2212s)|\u03bbk|2f\u03b2(\u03c9k) , (44)\nwhere f\u03b2(\u03c9) = (1 + e\u03b2\u03c9)\u22121 is the Fermi-Dirac distribution. We can apply the continuum limit to eq. (44) by using the equality 2\u03c0 \u2211 k |\u03bbk|2h(\u03c9k) = \u222b d\u03c9 J(\u03c9)h(\u03c9), which holds for any function h by definition of J. We can then apply the wideband limit by using lim\u039b\u2192\u221e limn\u2192\u221e J(\u03c9) = 1. We find\nTr [ e\u2212\u03b2HB\nZB \u03be\u0302\u2020(s)\u03be\u0302(r)\n] = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c9 2\u03c0 e i\u03c9(s\u2212r)J(\u03c9)f\u03b2(\u03c9)\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c9 2\u03c0 e i\u03c9(s\u2212r)f\u03b2(\u03c9) . (45)\nApplying eq. (45) to eq.

(50)\nAs a side-note, it is interesting to note that the frequency integral of eq.

This expression is useful for numerical implementations as it is faster to compute than the integral of eq. (49).\nBy taking the limit t \u2192 \u221e in eq. (49) and eq.

Inserting this in the expression for the thermal expectation of the probability of occupation we find\npth = 1 Z \u2211 jk \u27e8j|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9\u27e80|a\u0302|k\u27e9 Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302 c\u0302\u2020j c\u0302k ] = \u2211 k\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8k|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9\u2223\u2223\u22232 Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5k c\u0302 \u2020 k c\u0302k c\u0302\u2020k c\u0302k ]\nTr [ e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5k c\u0302 \u2020 k c\u0302k ] = \u2211\nk \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8k|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9\u2223\u2223\u22232 f\u03b2(\u03b5k) . (60)\nFrom eq. (41) it is easy to see that we can write the propagator in the following way\nG(t, 0) = \u27e80|a\u0302H(t)a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9 = \u27e80|U\u0302 \u2020(t)a\u0302U\u0302(t)a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9 = \u2211\nk\ne\u2212i\u03b5kt \u27e80|U\u0302 \u2020(t)a\u0302|k\u27e9\u27e8k|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9 = \u2211\nk\ne\u2212i\u03b5kt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8k|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9\u2223\u2223\u22232 ,\n(61) where we used the fact that the vacuum state does not evolve U\u0302(t) |0\u27e9 = |0\u27e9 and that since we are performing no driving we have U\u0302(t) = e\u2212it \u2211 k \u03b5k c\u0302 \u2020 k\nc\u0302k . Note that the sum needs only to be over 1- particle states as there is a scalar product with the 1-particle state a\u0302\u2020 |0\u27e9. By now defining \u03c6(\u03c9) :=\u2211\nk \u2223\u2223\u2223\u27e8k|a\u0302\u2020|0\u27e9\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5k) we can identify G(t, 0) =\n\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u03c6(\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t , (62)\npth = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9)\u03c6(\u03c9) . (63)\nConsidering eq. (55) it is clear that if \u03c6(\u03c9) = 1\u03c0 \u211c [ G\u0303(\u2212i\u03c9) ] then we have proven pth = limt\u2192\u221e p(t). Therefore we compute the Laplace transform of G(t, 0) using eq.

Since \u03c6(\u03c9) is by\ndefinition a real function we can see that P. \u222b\u221e\n\u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u2032 \u03c6(\u03c9\u2032) \u03c9\u2212\u03c9\u2032 is a real number. Therefore we can conclude \u03c6(\u03c9) = 1\u03c0 \u211c [ G\u0303(\u2212i\u03c9) ] . Which concludes the proof of the thermalization of p(t).\nTo prove the thermalization of v(t) we proceed in a similar fashion.

By further defining \u03c80(\u03c9) := \u2211 k \u03bb \u2217 k\u03c8k(\u03c9) and \u03c8(\u03c9) = \u03c80(\u03c9) + \u03c8\u22170(\u03c9) we can see that\nK(t) := \u2211\nj\n|\u03bbj |2 (Kj(t) +Hj(t)) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u03c8(\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t , (67)\nvth = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9)\u03c8(\u03c9) .

First we make the time parameter in \u03b5 and g dimensionless, so that the protocol starts at \u201ctime\u201d input parameter 0 and ends at \u201ctime\u201d input parameter 1. So we have the following mappings: t \u2192 \u03c4t, \u222b dt \u2192 \u03c4 \u222b dt and ddt \u2192 \u03c4 \u22121 d dt . Second we need to \u201cextract\u201d the evolution timescale of the system in order to make the slow driving expansion. From eq. (46), eq. (47) and the definition of the propagator (or more clearly form eq. (49) and eq. (50)) it is quite clear that the relaxation timescale of the system, at any point of the evolution, is of the order (g(t)2)\u22121. Hence we are going take the average of the square of the coupling as normalizing factor, we therefore define (in normalized time) \u0393 := \u222b 1 0 dt g(t)2. We now define a normalized version of our control parameters:\n\u03f5(t) := 1\u0393\u03b5(t) , \u03b3(t) := 1 2\u0393g(t) 2 . (74)\nWe can therefore write the expression for work cost in this new convention\nW = \u222b 1\n0 dt \u03f5\u0307(t)\u0393p(t) + \u03b3\u0307(t)\n\u221a \u0393\n2\u03b3(t)v(t) . (75)\nWe can also rewrite the propagator G(t, s) = exp [ \u2212\u03c4\u0393 \u222b t s dr \u03b3(r) + i\u03f5(r) ] , (76)\nand the expectation values of the observables\np(t) = |G(t, 0)|2 p0 + 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c4\u0393\u222b t 0 ds \u03b3(s) 1 2G(t, s)ei\u03c4\u03c9\u0393(t\u2212s) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (77) v(t) = \u03c4\u0393 \u221a 2\u0393 \u03c0 \u2111 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) \u222b t 0 ds \u03b3(s) 1 2G(t, s)ei\u03c4\u0393\u03c9(t\u2212s) , (78)\nwhere we were able to insert a phase in the time integral of eq. (77) because of the absolute value and rescaled \u03c9 by \u0393. We can see that we have to expand in 1/\u03c4\u0393 the same integral for both eq. (77) and eq. (78). To do that we do partial integration. First, we can notice that\nG\u03c9(t, s) := G(t, s)ei\u03c4\u0393\u03c9(t\u2212s) = exp [ \u2212\u03c4\u0393 \u222b t s dr \u03b3(r) + i(\u03f5(r) \u2212 \u03c9) ] .\nFurthermore we have d\nds G\u03c9(t, s) = \u03c4\u0393 [\u03b3(s) + i(\u03f5(s) \u2212 \u03c9)]G\u03c9(t, s) .\nTherefore we can write\n\u03c4\u0393 \u222b t\n0 ds \u03b3(s)\n1 2G\u03c9(t, s) = \u222b t 0 ds\n\u03b3(s) 1 2\n\u03b3(s) + i(\u03f5(s) \u2212 \u03c9) d ds G\u03c9(t, s) ,\n= \u03b3(s) 1 2 \u03b3(s) + i(\u03f5(s) \u2212 \u03c9)G\u03c9(t, s) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t s=0 \u2212 \u222b t 0 ds G\u03c9(t, s) d ds\n\u03b3(s) 1 2\n\u03b3(s) + i(\u03f5(s) \u2212 \u03c9) , (79)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify.

(80)\nSimilarly as in eq. (79), we keep only the evaluation at s = t for the first term because the evaluation at s = 0 is of order O(e\u2212\u03c4\u0393). Whereas the remaining integral will also have to be evaluated by parts, and in doing so we will obtain another power of 1/\u03c4\u0393. But since we are only interested in the first order correction and the integral will only yield terms of order O(1/\u03c42\u03932) we don\u2019t need to compute it. By combining eq. (79) and eq.

(82)\nCombining this with eq. (77) we find the expansion of p(t) in the slow driving regime\np(t) = 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) \u03b3(t) \u03b3(t)2 + (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2\n+ 1 \u03c4\u0393 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) 4\u03f5\u0307(t)\u03b3(t)2(\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9) + \u03b3\u0307(t)\u03b3(t) ( \u03b3(t)2 \u2212 3(\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 ) (\u03b3(t)2 + (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2)3 + O( 1 \u03c42\u03932 ) .

(84)\nTherefore the slow driving expansion of v(t) is\n1\u221a 2\u0393\u03b3(t) v(t) = \u2212 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) \u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9 \u03b3(t)2 + (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2\n\u2212 1 \u03c4\u0393 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9\u0393) 2\u03b3\u0307(t)(\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9) ( \u03b3(t)2 \u2212 (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 ) \u2212 \u03f5\u0307(t)\u03b3(t) ( \u03b3(t)2 \u2212 3(\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 ) (\u03b3(t)2 + (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2)3\n+ O( 1 \u03c42\u03932 ) . (85)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 20\nTherefore we can see that we can rewrite the work cost of the protocol as\nW = W (0) + 1 \u03c4\u0393W (1) + O( 1 \u03c42\u03932 ) . (86)\nThe leading order term is\nW (0) = 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9) \u222b 1 0 dt \u03f5\u0307(t)\u03b3(t) \u2212 \u03b3\u0307(t)(\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9/\u0393) \u03b3(t)2 + (\u03f5(t) \u2212 \u03c9/\u0393)2\n= 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9) ( arctan \u03b3(0) \u03f5(0) \u2212 \u03c9/\u0393 \u2212 arctan \u03b3(1) \u03f5(1) \u2212 \u03c9/\u0393 ) , (87)\nwhere we re-scaled \u03c9 by \u0393. Here we were able to perform the integral independently of the function describing the control parameters. Therefore W (0) only depends on their initial and final value. More importantly, we can identify the instantaneous thermal expectation values of p(t) and v(t) (from eq. (52) and eq. (53)) in the time integral of W (0). This implies very directly that W (0) = \u2206F . We can notice that we can write W (1) as\nW (1) = \u222b 1\n0 dt\n\u02d9\u20d7 \u03bbTt m(\u03bb\u20d7t) \u02d9\u20d7 \u03bbt , (88)\nwith \u03bb\u20d7t = (\u03f5(t), \u03b3(t))T and the metric\nm(\u03bb\u20d7) = 1 \u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9)m\u03c9(\u03f5\u2212 \u03c9/\u0393, \u03b3) , (89)\nfor\nm\u03c9(\u03f5, \u03b3) = 1\n(\u03b32 + \u03f52)3\n( 4\u03f5\u03b32 \u03b3(\u03b32 \u2212 3\u03f52)\n\u03b3(\u03b32 \u2212 3\u03f52) 2\u03f5(\u03f52 \u2212 \u03b32)\n) . (90)\nSince the leading order is independent of the path taken in parameter space, minimizing the work cost of erasure only implies minimizing W (1), i.e., the entropy production kBT\u03a3. As we see from eq. (88) it is equivalent to finding the shortest path in a metric space described by the metric m(\u03bb\u20d7). The length of this shortest path is known as thermodynamic length. In the main text eq. (18) and eq. (19) represent the metric when the problem is rewritten in terms of the unit-full parameters.\nB.2 Weak coupling limit\nPrevious works on optimization of finite-time Landauer erasure have focused on the Markovian regime [44\u201354], corresponding to the weak coupling limit. We analyze this regime in this section. First we assume that the coupling remains unchanged during the protocol, which means \u0393 = g2 and \u03b3 = 1. We start by rewriting p(t) from eq. (83) in a more convenient manner under this first assumption:\np(t) = 12\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9) \u0393 \u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 + 1 \u03c4\u0393 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9) \u03b5\u0307(t)(\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)\u03933 (\u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2)3 + O( 1 \u03c42\u03932 ) , (91) where we used eq. (74) to go back to unit-full parameters and re-scaled \u03c9 by \u0393. Integrating by parts the second integral we get\np(t) = 12\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9) \u0393 \u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 + 1 \u03c4\u0393 \u03b2\u03b5\u0307(t) 8\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 f\u03b2(\u03c9)(1\u2212f\u03b2(\u03c9)) \u03933 (\u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2)2 , (92) where we used that dd\u03c9f\u03b2(\u03c9) = \u2212\u03b2f\u03b2(\u03c9)(1\u2212f\u03b2(\u03c9)), d d\u03c9 1 (\u03932/4+(\u03b5(t)\u2212\u03c9)2)2 = 4(\u03b5(t)\u2212\u03c9) (\u03932/4+(\u03b5(t)\u2212\u03c9)2)3 and dropped the O(1/\u03c42\u03932) to make the notation lighter. We now take the weak coupling limit, but we do so while\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 21\nkeeping the slow driving assumption: \u03c4\u0393 \u226b 1. Using the results of [120] we get the following\nlim \u0393\u21920 1 \u03c0 \u0393/2 \u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2 = \u03b4(\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9) ,\nlim \u0393\u21920 1 \u03c0 \u03933/8 (\u03932/4 + (\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9)2)2 = 1 2\u03b4(\u03b5(t) \u2212 \u03c9) ,\nwhere the equalities are meant in a distributional sense. Therefore we find that the occupation probability in the weak coupling limit is\np(t) = f\u03b2(\u03b5(t)) + 1 \u03c4\u0393\u03b2\u03b5\u0307(t)f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))[1 \u2212 f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))] . (93)\nThis result coincides with applying a slow driving expansion to a simple exponential relaxation model with characteristic time \u0393 (p\u0307 = \u2212\u03c4\u0393[p\u2212 f\u03b2(\u03f5(t))]). Computing the work cost yields\nW = \u2206F + 1 \u03c4\u0393\u03b2 \u222b 1 0 dt \u03b5\u0307(t)2f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))[1 \u2212 f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))] , (94)\nwith \u2206F = \u03b2\u22121 ln 1+e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5(0)1+e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5(1) . We will now minimize the work cost of the erasure protocol, similar optimizations have been done before in [50, 109, 121]. From variational calculus we know that the extremal function of the integral in eq. (94) will keep the integrand constant. So we can solve the variational problem as follows:\n\u03b5\u0307(t) \u221a f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))[1 \u2212 f\u03b2(\u03b5(t))] = Kw ,\u222b \u03b5(t)\n\u03b5(0)\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03b5/2 1 + e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5d\u03b5 = Kw \u222b t 0 dt\u2032 ,\n2 arctan(e\u03b2\u03b5(t)/2) \u2212 \u03c02 = \u03b2Kwt ,\n\u03b5(t) = 2\u03b2\u22121 ln tan ( \u03b2Kwt/2 + \u03c0\n4\n) ,\n(95)\nwith Kw = 2\u03b2\u22121(arctan(e\u03b2\u03b5(1)/2) \u2212 \u03c04 ) \u03b2\u03f5(1)\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c02\u03b2 \u22121. We therefore find\n\u03b5weak(t) = 2\u03b2\u22121 ln tan ( \u03c0 4 (t+ 1) ) , (96)\nand recover the result of eq. (1) from the main text:\nW = kBT ( ln 2 + \u03c0 2\n4\u03c4\u0393\n) . (97)\nB.3 Solving the integral of the thermodynamic metric and finding the symmetry\nWe will now try to find a more tractable version of the metric in eq. (89). First we notice that\nm\u03c9(\u03f5, \u03b3) = \u2212 d\nd\u03f5 1 (\u03b32 + \u03f52)2\n( \u03b32 \u2212\u03f5\u03b3\n\u2212\u03f5\u03b3 \u03f52\n) =: \u2212 d\nd\u03f5 m0(\u03f5, \u03b3) . (98)\nWe can remark that m0 coincides with a metric of an angle distance in the (\u03f5, \u03b3) space. To solve the integral of eq. (89) we will go in Fourier space.

Though this dependence disappears if we reparameterize the problem in terms of its original unit-full parameters. We start by rewriting the work as\nW = \u2206F +W (1) + O( 1 \u03c42\u03932 ) , (106)\nwhere we redefined W (1) with the unit-full parameters \u03bb\u20d7t = (\u03b5(t), \u00b5(t))T (with \u00b5(t) := 12g(t) 2 = \u0393\u03b3(t)):\nW (1) = 1 \u03c4 \u222b 1 0 dt \u02d9\u20d7 \u03bbTt m(\u03bb\u20d7t) \u02d9\u20d7 \u03bbt, (107)\nm(\u03bb\u20d7) = \u03b24\u03c02\u00b51 \u211c\u03c8 (1) (1 2 + \u03b2 2\u03c0z ) \u2212 \u03b2 2 8\u03c03 ( \u211c \u2111 \u2111 \u2212\u211c ) \u03c8(2) (1 2 + \u03b2 2\u03c0z ) . (108)\nWe remind the reader that z = \u00b5+ i\u03b5. This metric is the same as the one presented in the main text. Despite not looking very approachable, eq. (108) is a much more tractable version of eq. (18) from the main text when it comes to numerical implementations (as the polygamma functions are computed much faster than integrals) and analytical studies of the geometric properties of thermodynamic protocols.\nWe can notice from eq. (107) and eq. (108) is that there is a symmetry in the corrective term. If we perform the following transformation:\n\u03b5(t) \u2192 \u03bb\u03b5(t) , \u00b5(t) \u2192 \u03bb\u00b5(t) , \u03b2 \u2192 \u03bb\u22121\u03b2 ,\n(109)\nfor \u03bb > 0; then W (1) remains unchanged. This symmetry allows us to conclude that the minimal value of W (1) to perform Landauer erasure will be of the form c/\u03c4 where c is a constant that does not depend on any physical quantity."

But instead of solving an initial value problem (which we can always solve by numerical integration, in principle) we are trying to solve a boundary value problem. Generically, to solve a BVP numerically, the solver will try many IVPs until the wanted BVP is reached. But here we can notice that we can turn the BVP into an IVP by taking an analytical approximation of the problem around the point (\u03b5, \u00b5) = (0, 0).\nAs we have seen in eq. (109) there is an underlying symmetry in this problem, so a limit where \u03b5 and \u00b5 are infinitesimal is the same as a limit where \u03b2 is infinitesimal but \u03b5 and \u00b5 finite.

It is important to note that despite the fact that this approximation will yield some analytical results on how to optimize a protocol in the high temperature regime it will not give us a result that is relevant for Landauer erasure because to perform erasure we are assuming that we reach \u03b2\u03b5 \u226b 1, which is a low temperature limit.\nOne way to obtain an analytical result in this framework is by going back to eq. (89) and apply the high-temperature expansion of the Fermi-Dirac distribution: f\u03b2(\u03c9) = 12 \u2212 1 4\u03b2\u03c9 + O(\u03b2\n3\u03c93). Since m0(\u00b1\u221e, \u03b3) = 0 the first term of the metric in this expansion is 0. But from the next order we find (in unit-full parameters)\nmHT (\u03bb\u20d7) = \u03b2\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5 (\u00b52 + \u03c92)3 ( 4\u03c9\u00b52 \u00b5(\u00b52 \u2212 3\u03c92) \u00b5(\u00b52 \u2212 3\u03c92) 2\u03c9(\u03c92 \u2212 \u00b52) ) = \u03b28\u00b51 . (110)\nIt might not be immediate why we also require \u03b2\u00b5 \u226a 1, but it becomes clear that it is required when we want to obtain the same result by applying the same expansion on eq. (108) (which would also allow us to get further orders). We will now compute and solve the equations of motion:\n\u03bb\u0308i + \u0393ijk\u03bb\u0307j \u03bb\u0307k = 0 , (111)\nwhere we assumed the Einstein tensorial notation and \u0393ijk are the Christoffel symbols\n\u0393ijk := 1 2m il(\u2202jmkl + \u2202kmjl \u2212 \u2202lmjk) . (112)\nHere we have mil = 8\u00b5\u03b2 \u03b4 il and \u2202ambc = \u2212 \u03b28\u00b52 \u03b4a\u00b5\u03b4bc. We therefore find\n\u0393ijk = \u2212 1\n2\u00b5(\u03b4j\u00b5\u03b4 i k + \u03b4k\u00b5\u03b4ij \u2212 \u03b4i\u00b5\u03b4jk) , (113)\nwhich can be rewritten as\n\u0393\u03b5 = \u2212 12\u00b5 ( 0 1 1 0 ) , \u0393\u00b5 = 12\u00b5 ( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) . (114)\nWe get the following differential equations for \u00b5 and \u03b5:\n\u03b5\u0308\u00b5 = \u03b5\u0307\u00b5\u0307 , 2\u00b5\u00b5\u0308 = \u00b5\u03072 \u2212 \u03b5\u03072. (115)\nFrom the first equation we can see that \u222b d\u03b5\u0307/\u03b5\u0307 = \u222b d\u00b5/\u00b5, therefore \u03b5\u0307 = C\u00b5 for some constant C (we can already see as a sanity check that \u03b5\u0307 never changes sign in an optimal protocol). The equation for \u00b5 becomes\n2\u00b5\u00b5\u0308 = \u00b5\u03072 \u2212 C2\u00b52 ,\nwhen we consider that \u00b5 = g2/2 and \u00b5\u0308 = g\u03072 + gg\u0308 we can see that\ng\u0308 = \u2212C2g/4 .\nTaking into account that the boundary conditions for g are g(0) = g(1) = 0 we find that g(t) = A sin(k\u03c0t) for some constant A, k \u2208 N\u2217 and C = 2k\u03c0. By choosing \u03b5(0) = 0 and \u03b5(1) = \u03b5\u2217 we have \u03b5(t) = k\u03c0A2 \u222b t 0 ds sin(k\u03c0s)2, therefore A2 = 2\u03b5\u2217 k\u03c0 . Thus the optimal protocol, portrayed in Fig. 3, is\n\u03b5(t) = \u03b5\u2217 ( t\u2212 sin(2k\u03c0t)2k\u03c0 ) , \u00b5(t) = \u03b5\u2217 k\u03c0 sin(k\u03c0t)2 .

            "text": "As is mentioned in the main text, it is well known [108] that, at weak coupling, discontinuities appear at the beginning and at the end in optimal finite-time protocols. In the main text we gave numerical evidence to the fact that these jumps disappear as one approaches the quasistatic limit. Here we make an a posteriori argument as to why these jumps should also disappear for the system we studied in the strong coupling regime.\nWe can start by immediately discarding jumps in the coupling because these lead to a diverging work cost in the wideband limit. Then, if one makes a jump in the energy at the start of the protocol from 0 to \u03b5\u2217 its work cost is\nWjump = p(0)\u03b5\u2217 = 1 2\u03b5\u2217 , (126)\nwhere p(0) is the probability of occupation at t = 0 and is set to be 1/2. We can compare it to the work cost given by an optimal continuous protocol with the same boundary conditions:\nWcont = \u2206F + a(\u03b2\u03b5\u2217)\u210f\n\u03c4 = kBT ln ( 2 1 + e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u2217 ) + a(\u03b2\u03b5\u2217)\u210f \u03c4 , (127)\nwhere a(\u03b2\u03b5\u2217) is a bounded function of \u03b2\u03b5\u2217 (c.f. figure in the main text). We note that by expanding \u2206F around \u03b2 = 0 we find\n\u2206F = 12\u03b5\u2217 \u2212 1 8\u03b2\u03b5 2 \u2217 + O(\u03b23) . (128)\nTherefore at \u03b2 > 0 and small enough one finds that \u2206F < Wjump. But one can also note that lim\u03b2\u2192\u221e \u2206F = 0, and since \u2206F is a monotonous function of \u03b2 we conclude that \u2206F < Wjump for any temperature and any \u03b5\u2217 > 0. At this point it is immediate that there exists \u03c4 large enough such that Wcont < Wjump. We finally consider jumps in the energy at the end of the protocol. These jumps would have to be performed once the coupling is very close to zero since it is at the end of the protocol. In this limit optimal protocols are found by [109]. These optimal protocols feature jumps whose magnitude is controlled by a constant of integration K, in particular the magnitude of these jumps is O( \u221a K). This constant is defined as follows (in terms of our notation with unit-less time)\nK = 1 \u03c42\u03932\np\u03072\n(p+ p\u0307/\u03c4\u0393)(1 \u2212 p\u2212 p\u0307/\u03c4\u0393) .

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 27\nFrom which it is clear that K goes to 0 in the limit of \u03c4\u0393 \u226b 1 and therefore the jumps disappear. This behavior is also confirmed in Fig. 1 where these optimal protocols are shown."

            "text": "Because of the metric we obtain in eq. (108) it is quite clear that, in the two-parameter case, we will not be able to solve analytically the geodesics for the full problem. This even prevents us form finding an analytical expression for the distance between two points in the parameter space, as it is the length of the shortest path (for which we have no expression). But by fixing one parameter to an arbitrary value and solving for the other we can use the fact that geodesics always have a conserved quantity along their path (the integrand: \u02d9\u20d7\u03bbTt m(\u03bb\u20d7t) \u02d9\u20d7 \u03bbt) to avoid solving the geodesic equation and finding an explicit formula for the length and geodesic. We point out the fact that the symmetry mentioned in App. B does not lead to a conserved quantity because \u03b2 is a constant of the system instead of a function of time for which we are solving.\nHere we will take the erasure protocol to be made of three parts, which will be optimized separately: 1. we turn on the coupling to some value \u00b5\u2217 while keeping the energy at zero; 2. while keeping the coupling at \u00b5\u2217 we increase the energy from zero to infinity; 3. we turn the coupling off. Incidentally, this type of protocols are more realistic for an experimental realization as often setups are not able to control optimally energy an coupling at the same time. And even if the control over the coupling is only to turn it on to some value and turn it off, step 2 will remain valid. Furthermore, previous studies done at weak coupling essentially are described by this type of protocol; but they are in a regime where step 1 and 3 can be neglected. Therefore we can compare the results of this section to those of the weak coupling limit.\nWe start by looking at step 3, in the limit of \u03b2\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e we actually reach a scenario described by the T = 0 limit. Therefore the length of this step is described by eq. (123), for any finite value of \u00b5\u2217 the angle span of this step is trivially 0. Therefore, up to first order, this step will not cause any extra dissipation, no matter how it is realized.\nWe notice that we can write the length of the first step as follows\nL1 = \u222b 1\n0 dt |\u00b5\u0307(t)|m\u00b5\u00b5(0, \u00b5(t))1/2 = \u222b \u00b5(1) 0 d\u00b5 m\u00b5\u00b5(0, \u00b5)1/2 , (130)\nwhere we used the fact that, since the metric is not explicitly time-dependent, the sign of \u00b5\u0307 has to be always positive for this step. With eq. (108) we find the following expression for the length\nL1 = 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03b2\u00b5\u2217/2\u03c0 0 \u221a \u211c [1 x \u03c8(1) (1 2 + x ) + \u03c8(2) (1 2 + x )] dx . (131)\nNow that we have an expression for L1 we can recover an equation for \u00b5(t). We can use the fact that the integrand of the time integral in eq. (130) is constant to obtain\ntL1 = 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03b2\u00b5(t)/2\u03c0 0 \u221a \u211c [1 x \u03c8(1) (1 2 + x ) + \u03c8(2) (1 2 + x )] dx , (132)\nwhich gives an implicit definition of \u00b5(t), or rather an explicit definition of its inverse t(\u00b5). By following the same procedure as in step 1 we can recover the length of step 2\nL2 = 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u221a \u211c [ 2\u03c0 \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 \u03c8(1) (1 2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy ) \u2212 \u03c8(2) (1 2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy )] dy , (133)\nand the implicit definition of \u03b5(t)\nL2t = 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u222b \u03b2\u03b5(t)/2\u03c0 0 \u221a \u211c [ 2\u03c0 \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 \u03c8(1) (1 2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy ) \u2212 \u03c8(2) (1 2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy )] dy .

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 28\nThese implicit definitions of \u03b5(t) and \u00b5(t) can be solved numerically, the results are shown in Fig. 4.\nThe question remains about how to subdivide optimally the protocol times of step 1 (\u03c41) and step 2 (\u03c42 = \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c41). The total excess work is given by W (1) = L21/\u03c41 +L22/\u03c42, by taking the derivative and imposing it to be zero we find\n\u03c41 = L1\nL2 + L1 \u03c4 . (135)\nAnd therefore we find\nW (1) = 1 \u03c4 (L1 + L2)2 , (136)\nwhich is indeed what was to be expected, as L1 + L2 is the total length of the protocol. We now discuss how we can obtain an exact version of eq. (1) of the main text, so that it applies also in the strong coupling regime. First we can notice that since L1 > 0 and L2 > 0 we have W (1) \u2265 L22/\u03c4 . Then by considering that m\u03b5\u03b5(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217) is a one-dimensional metric it has to be positive by definition. Therefore the integrand of eq. (133) is always positive. Next we can consider the fact that\nlim \u00b5\u2217\u2192\u221e 2\u03c0 \u03b2\u00b5\u2217\n\u03c8(1) (1\n2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy\n) \u2212 \u03c8(2) (1 2 + \u03b2\u00b5\u2217 2\u03c0 + iy ) = 0 . (137)\nTherefore, for all \u00b5\u2217 and all \u03b5\nm\u03b5\u03b5(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217) \u2265 lim \u00b5\u2217\u2192\u221e m\u03b5\u03b5(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217) , (138)\nwhich allows us to conclude L2 \u2265 lim\u00b5\u2217\u2192\u221e L2. For any finite \u00b5\u2217 large enough m\u03b5\u03b5(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217) can be approximated by [mT =0]\u03b5\u03b5(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217). The angle spanned by the integral of L2 is \u03c0/2. Therefore for all \u00b5\u2217\n\u222b \u221e 0 d\u03b5 [mT =0(\u03b5, \u00b5\u2217)]1/2\u03b5\u03b5 = \u221a \u03c0 2 , (139)\nand since the approximation becomes exact in the limit \u00b5\u2217 \u2192 \u221e we have lim\u00b5\u2217\u2192\u221e L2 = \u221a \u03c0/2. Therefore,\nW (1) \u2265 \u03c04\u03c4 . (140)\nIn Fig. 5 we show the minimal value of W (1) for step 2 as a function of \u03b2\u00b5\u2217, and we compare it to eq. (1) of the main text and to eq. (140). We can see how, when the coupling becomes small, the exact curve agrees with eq. (1).\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 29"

(112). Though the differential equations we get are quite untractable and cannot be solved analytically, we won\u2019t even write them here as they are very long and will not bring any insight. Therefore we will solve them numerically, and indeed eq. (141) is quite practical for numerical integration since the second derivative of the parameters can be easily isolated. The boundary conditions we impose for the erasure protocol are {\u03b5(0) = \u00b5(0) = \u00b5(1) = 0 , \u03b5(1) \u226b kBT}. Indeed we cannot impose \u03b2\u03b5(1) = \u221e because we are performing numerics, therefore we set it to be an arbitrarily large value.\nBut at this point we can notice that close to t = 0, by continuity, we are satisfying the conditions for the high temperature approximation. And at t = 0 the approximation becomes exact. Therefore the initial conditions of an optimal erasure protocol in the general case must match with the initial conditions of the protocols that we previously studied in the high-temperature regime. From a numerical perspective it is much more preferable to solve an initial value problem instead of a boundary value problem. Therefore we used the numerical solver DOP853, implemented in the scipy library in python, to solve eq. (141) with the initial conditions given by eq. (116).\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 30\nTo be precise, we cannot start the integration from t = 0 as the metric is formally divergent at (\u03b5, \u00b5) = (0, 0), therefore we evaluate eq. (116) at an infinitesimal time and integrate from there. The specific value we choose for \u03b5\u2217 sets the value of \u03b5(1) that is reached in a monotonous way. When \u03b5\u2217 is chosen small the protocol closes matches with those of eq. (116) (as long as \u03b5(1) is also small). Then for larger values of \u03b5\u2217 we get more interesting behavior, as is shown in Fig. 6.\nWhen one changes the value of k in eq. (116) the value of \u03b5(1) that is reached is different. But, as is shown in Fig. 7, by numerically searching values of \u03b5\u2217 such that the same \u03b5(1) is reached for different values of k we find that the protocols end up being the same.\nFinally we thought it might be interesting to compare the best one-parameter protocol to the geodesic erasure protocol we find numerically. And we can see from Fig. 8 that, despite seeming very different in the path taken in the parameter space, when we look at the functions of time they are actually quite similar. The apparent difference happens because the part of the protocol for \u03b2\u03b5 \u226b 1 is done very quickly since the metric is vanishing in that region.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-10-24, click title to verify.
