INTRODUCTION\nAt high temperature and high pressure (HTHP), water exhibits unique properties compared with those at ambient conditions. In particular, supercritical water has the solubility of liquid water and the diffusivity of its gaseous phase, resulting in high reactivity. The low environmental impact and inexpensiveness of water have led to the widespread use of sub- and supercritical water in decomposing waste (including plastics and biomass).\nHTHP hydrothermal experiments are carried out in a pressure vessel made of metal, which severely limits in situ observation of the reaction process. HTHP apparatus equipped with a transparent window made of sapphire or diamond, for example, has been developed for in situ observation or investigation using various analysis techniques. However, a sample opaque to visible light cannot be observed inside the apparatus, and a signal from a sample cannot be obtained unless the sample passes through the probe light of the analyzing devices. Further problems facing the windows are frequent breakages, pressure leaks, and temperature irregularities.\nOverall, it is difficult to gather clear details of reaction mechanisms under HTHP conditions using existing methods.\nNeutron imaging generates transmission images that represent the neutron attenuation properties of an object as gray-scale values, much like x-ray imaging. However, unlike x-rays, neutrons can penetrate metal owing to their interactions with nuclei.1 For example, a neutron of wavelength 1 \u00c5 can penetrate \u223c86% through a 10 mm-thick iron of density 7.87 g/cm3. This technique enables in situ observation inside a metal pressure vessel without requiring a window. Previous studies have applied neutron imaging to observe the behavior of salt precipitation,2,3 density changes of supercritical water flowing in porous carbon material,4 and the mixing behavior of supercritical water and room-temperature water in a T-shaped tubular channel.5\nPrevious in situ observation studies have used flow-type reactors, whereas decomposition processes at HTHP typically use batchtype reactors. Batch-type reactor experiments do not allow the state of a sample to be known until the reactor is opened after the temperature and pressure have returned to room conditions. In situ\nRev. Sci. Instrum. 94, 083904 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0159685 94, 083904-1\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 15:27:18\nobservation of reaction processes in batch-type reactors would help determine optimal reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time. This could improve efficiency and reduce the energy, time, and cost required for HTHP experiments. Neutron imaging is an ideal technique for analyzing reaction processes in batch-type reactors. This study developed a batch-type HTHP cell for neutron imaging, which was used to visualize the behavior of sub- and supercritical water in the cell. The decomposition of two types of plastic under HTHP was observed."

            "text": "Figure 1 outlines the HTHP cell for neutron imaging and shows a photograph of the cell\u2019s reaction tube. HTHP was induced in the reaction tube by heating it inside the heating box, which consisted of a brass heater block and a 50 mm-thick insulator. Stainless steel (SUS304) plates covered the heating box. Two cartridge heaters (500 W) were inserted into the heater block, which had an aperture of 10 mm wide and 102 mm high; the outer stainless steel plate had an aperture of 20 mm wide and 160 mm high. The apertures allowed neutrons to pass. The sample, as a solute, and water, as a solvent, were inserted into a reaction tube, which was then installed into the heating box. A pressure gauge and safety valve were connected to the reaction tube through a high-pressure fitting.\nThe maximum temperature and pressure settings for the cell were 500 \u25cbC and 50 MPa, respectively, targeting the supercritical state of water. Two types of reaction tubes were prepared using stainless steel (SUS316), one with a 4.8 mm inner diameter, 14.1 mm outer diameter, 205 mm height, and 3.7 ml internal volume, and the other with a 6.4 mm inner diameter, 14.1 mm outer diameter, 205 mm height, and 6.6 ml internal volume.\nA reaction tube was heated by the heater block. The lower 100 mm of its 205 mm-height were installed in the block for heating. The high-pressure fitting above the tube was covered by an insulator. Three thermocouples (Nikkato Corporation, T90-200DK9C-3EXD) inserted in the side of the heating box monitored the temperature\nof the reaction tube. These thermocouples were in direct contact with the outer surface of the reaction tube. Therefore, the measured temperature represented the temperature of the outer surface of the reaction tube and did not directly represent the temperature of the reactant solution inside the reaction tube. Figure 1(a) shows the three locations for monitoring temperature. The temperature recorded at the middle position was used for temperature control. The heating rate could be adjusted by the current supplied to the heater and was usually set at \u223c10 \u25cbC per min.\nA pressure gauge (Keller, PA-35XHTC) connected to the reaction tube via a high-pressure fitting monitored the pressure. A safety valve was installed to release pressure if it rose above 55 MPa. Figure 2 shows the relationships among the amount of water, temperature, and pressure when only water was in the reaction tube. The pressure depended on the volume of the enclosed sample and the temperature. The measured temperature-pressure data deviated from the saturated vapor pressure curve. As described earlier, the reaction tube was only heated by inserting the lower 100 mm into the heating box, while its upper part, as well as the high-pressure fitting, pressure gauge, and safety valve, remained unheated. Additionally, the measured temperature represented the temperature of the outer surface of the reaction tube\u2019s lower part, which was heated by the heater block, rather than the inside of the reaction tube. Consequently, the temperature of the reactant solution inside the reaction tube is expected to have been lower than the measured temperature. This discrepancy is considered to explain the deviation of the temperature-pressure data obtained using the HTHP cell from the saturated vapor pressure curve. The difference between the inside temperature and the measured temperature is not constant and is estimated to increase at higher temperatures. Furthermore, it is estimated that the temperature difference decreases as the volume of water filled into the reaction tube increases. For example, with 3 ml of water sealed in a reaction tube of 4.8 mm inner diameter, the pressure reached 41.9 MPa at 500 \u25cbC, whereas it reached 44.3 MPa at 390 \u25cbC using 6 ml of water in a tube of 6.4 mm inner diameter. The pressure values based on the water volume and the temperature of the reaction tube were estimated using the calculator\nFIG. 1. (a) Overview of the HTHP cell designed for neutron imaging.

For the former case, the estimated pressure was 69.4 MPa; for the latter, it was 149.7 MPa. However, the actual measured pressure was lower than that calculated owing to the difference between the measured temperature and the inside temperature, as mentioned earlier, and because the actual internal volume of the high-pressure fitting, pressure gauge, and safety valve is larger than estimated. We are considering design improvements to enable the insertion of a temperature sensor into the interior of the reaction tube to measure the temperature inside the tube."

To perform measurements with high neutron flux and small beam divergence, the HTHP cell was placed on the upstream sample stage of RADEN. A camera-type detector was installed behind the cell. A neutron beam with a repetition rate of 25 Hz (40 ms intervals) was irradiated into the cell. Neutrons that penetrated the HTHP cell were converted to light by a 6LiF/ZnS scintillator screen (0.1 or 0.2 mm thick) in the detector. The emitted light was recorded as a gray-scale image using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera with 1024 \u00d7 1024 active pixels. The field of view was set to 100 \u00d7 100 mm2, and the spatial resolution was estimated at \u223c0.15 mm.\nThe neutron transmission images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ, open-source software for scientific image processing and analysis.9 The images of each sample were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The read-out noise of the EMCCD camera was then subtracted from the averaged images. Finally, the processed\nimages were divided by the image without a sample to correct for the inhomogeneity of the incident neutron beam."

The imaging used a reaction tube of 4.8 mm inner diameter containing 3.5 ml of deionized water (H2O). The temperature was raised to and held at each target temperature before imaging. Neutron transmission imaging used an exposure of 300 pulses of neutron irradiation (roughly 12 s), and ten images were later averaged using image processing software to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nFigure 4 shows images of the HTHP cell filled with H2O.

Thick metallic parts, such as the heater block and high-pressure fitting, also appear dark owing to strong neutron attenuation. In contrast, thin metal parts such as the reaction tube walls and insulation, appear brighter owing to high neutron transmission. Figures 4(b)\u20134(d) show neutron transmission images taken under HTHP conditions. The brightness of H2O in the reaction tube changed as the temperature increased because the density of H2O changed with temperature and pressure. At 200 \u25cbC and 1.0 MPa [Fig. 4(b)], the middle of the reaction tube appeared brighter than at ambient conditions, indicating that the water was gaseous, less dense, and thus allowed increased neutron transmission. However, darker areas appeared lower in the reaction tube near its bottom. The section of the reaction tube above the heater block was presumed to be cooler than the section in the heater block. The water there then condensed, descended, and accumulated at the bottom of the reaction tube, resulting in the observed lower dark area. Subcritical water at 350 \u25cbC and 10.4 MPa and supercritical water at 440 \u25cbC and 44.9 MPa showed uniform brightness distributions in the reaction tube. The water appeared brighter in these images than at room temperature and pressure, indicating its lower density at HTHP than at ambient conditions. The neutron transmission of H2O in the reaction tube was \u223c6% at room temperature, \u223c18% in bright areas of images of gaseous water at 200 \u25cbC, and \u223c10% at 350 and 440 \u25cbC.\nThe motion of water at HTHP was also captured. At 200\u2013300 \u25cbC, it showed convection cycles inside the reaction tube: it accumulated in the lower part of the tube at 200 \u25cbC [Fig. 4(b)], rose intermittently, and then descended along the tube\u2019s inner wall. Water evaporated at the bottom of the tube, then rose, cooled, and condensed at the top of the reaction tube before descending to the bottom along the tube\u2019s inner wall. The image taken at >350 \u25cbC shows uniform brightness throughout the reaction tube that did not vary with time, indicating a steady state both spatially and temporally.\nB. In situ observation of plastic decomposition at HTHP\nTo investigate the feasibility of in situ observation of reaction processes, neutron transmission images were taken of two types of\nplastic decomposing under HTHP. Polypropylene or polyethylene solutes were processed in heavy water (D2O). Twenty grains of each plastic (spherical polypropylene, \u223c3 mm in diameter, or rectangular polyethylene, \u223c3 mm long on each side) were added with 2.0 ml of D2O to a reaction tube of 6.4 mm inner diameter. Heavy water with 99.9 atom% was used to enhance the contrast between the plastic and solvent in the neutron images. Neutron attenuation coefficiency depends on elements or isotopes.1 Hydrogen scatters neutrons well, and neutrons cannot easily pass through hydrogen, even in small quantities. Therefore, neutrons do not easily penetrate H2O. In contrast, deuterium has significantly lower neutron attenuation than hydrogen, so using D2O increases the contrast between the hydrogen-rich plastic and the solvent, leading to a remarkable separation of the two in neutron transmission images. Images were taken as the plastics decomposed during heating to the target temperature, while being held at the target temperature, and during cooling. The decomposition of polypropylene was monitored using a series of ten images, each taken with an exposure of 40 pulses of neutron irradiation (\u223c1.6 s). Polyethylene was observed using a single image with an exposure of 60 pulses of neutron irradiation (\u223c2.4 s). In the measurement of polyethylene, the image quality might deteriorate due to shorter exposure times. However, we attempted to enhance the time resolution to observe dynamic processes.\nFigure 5 shows neutron transmission images of polypropylene during decomposition at HTHP. At room temperature [Fig. 5(a)], black specks in the reaction tube represent the 20 polypropylene grains, and the D2O solvent appeared slightly darker. Using D2O as a solvent instead of H2O provided sufficient contrast to observe the plastic grains\u2019 shapes. Heating to 200 \u25cbC began to change the grains\u2019 shapes. The image at 300 \u25cbC and 0.7 MPa [Fig. 5(b)] indicated the melting of the polypropylene. At 400 \u25cbC and 1.7 MPa [Fig. 5(c)], the black parts corresponding to the melting polypropylene were still visible, indicating incomplete decomposition. During holding at 400 \u25cbC for 150 min, the pressure reached 5.5 MPa [Fig. 5(d)], and the melted polypropylene changed shape considerably and accumulated at the bottom of the tube. The remaining black part suggested that the polypropylene had not yet decomposed. At 500 \u25cbC [Fig. 5(e)], the melted polypropylene accumulated even further. The density of the melted polypropylene was estimated to be higher than that of D2O at HTHP, which caused the melted polypropylene to accumulate at\nRev. Sci.

Figure 5(f) shows a neutron transmission image after holding at 500 \u25cbC for \u223c8 min. The black accumulation in the lower part of the reaction tube disappeared, suggesting complete decomposition. The decomposed polypropylene diffused into the tube, resulting in a lower density of hydrogen and high neutron transmission. After cooling to 80 \u25cbC and \u223c9 h [Fig. 5(g)], a black mass and a slightly darker area were observed in the reaction tube, indicating two layers corresponding to the reaction products of polypropylene and D2O, respectively. In addition, careful observation of the black reaction products also revealed a dark gray area on their upper side. The polypropylene presumably decomposed into oil. The internal pressure increased to 0.7 MPa, which was higher than atmospheric pressure because some of the decomposed polypropylene was gasified.\nChen et al.10 reported that polypropylene can be converted into useful products using supercritical water. Their study found that polypropylene did not decompose at 380 \u25cbC, even a after reaction lasting for 4 h. However, increasing the reaction temperature to at least 425 \u25cbC resulted in the decomposition of the polypropylene and an increased oil yield with a prolonged reaction time. They also observed that as the reaction time or reaction temperature increased, the naphtha components increased while the heavy oil components decreased. As the reaction progressed, the oil transformed into gas, with propene being the major component. They found that little water participated as a reactant or as a product in the conversion of polypropylene. These findings suggest that at 400 \u25cbC [Fig. 5(d)],\nthe decomposition of polypropylene had not yet been initiated and only shape changes due to melting occurred. At 500 \u25cbC [Figs. 5(e) and 5(f)], the reaction became more vigorous, indicating the conversion of polypropylene into oil. The reaction product in Fig. 5(g) showed two components with different contrasts, which were speculated to be the decomposed naphtha components and heavy oil components. Given previous findings that polypropylene can decompose to give gas, the increased internal pressure observed in this study can be attributed to the decomposition and gasification of polypropylene. As described earlier, the detection system developed in this study succeeded in clearly visualizing the decomposition process of plastic under HTHP conditions.\nFigure 6 shows neutron transmission images during the decomposition of polyethylene at HTHP. These transmission images were taken with an exposure time of 2.4 s, which is about seven times shorter than the average exposure time of about 16 s used for the transmission image in Fig. 5. As a result, the image quality (signal-tonoise ratio) is reduced. However, this shorter exposure time allows a more detailed observation of the dynamic process of the plastic sample remaining and dissolving in the tube. At room temperature [Fig. 6(a)], square polyethylene grains appeared black. Some grains occupied the lower part of the reaction tube. After placing the grains in the tube, D2O was added. As some grains were probably trapped against the inner wall of the tube, they did not float. At \u223c170 \u25cbC [Fig. 6(b)], the grains began to change shape as they melted. At 200 \u25cbC [Fig. 6(c)], black parts were scattered through-\nRev. Sci. Instrum. 94, 083904 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0159685 94, 083904-5\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 15:27:18\nout the reaction tube. After further heating to 450 \u25cbC [Fig. 6(d)], black parts remained visible, indicating that the polyethylene grains were still in the process of decomposition. At 500 \u25cbC [Fig. 6(e)], a black area formed at the bottom of the reaction tube, indicating the accumulation of melted polyethylene. The brightness of this black area then increased gradually. This black area disappeared \u223c15 min after reaching 500 \u25cbC [Fig. 6(f)], indicating that the polyethylene had decomposed. The heating was stopped, and the tube naturally cooled to 59 \u25cbC in about 11 h. As with polypropylene, two layers were observed: a black mass corresponding to the reaction products of polyethylene and a slightly brighter area probably corresponding to D2O. The inner pressure was 0.7 MPa, which again was high, indicating that the decomposed polyethylene was gasified.\nObservation of the progress of the reactions of plastics at HTHP showed their different dynamic behaviors. Polypropylene reacted while remaining in the midsection of the reaction tube, whereas polyethylene reacted while moving around inside the tube."

The cell\u2019s maximum temperature and pressure were 500 \u25cbC and 50 MPa, respectively. HTHP neutron transmission images of H2O and two types of plastic (polypropylene and polyethylene) decomposing in D2O were obtained. The obtained images showed that the brightness (i.e., neutron transmission) of water in the reaction tube varied depending on the temperature and pressure owing to changes in its density and phase state. The decomposition of plastics at hydrothermal conditions was also observed, indicating that they decomposed at 500 \u25cbC. The developed observation cell provided detailed information about HTHP hydrothermal experiments, such as reaction time, temperature, and pressure conditions, as well as dynamic information about a sample in a reaction vessel. In addition to facilitating observation of the decomposition of plastics, this cell could also be used to monitor the decomposition of biomass samples, the reforming of heavy oil, and the synthesis of nano-sized materials using sub- and supercritical water. In situ observation of the reaction processes of various samples is expected to clarify the reaction mechanisms and thus aid in the development of more efficient and sustainable processing methods."
