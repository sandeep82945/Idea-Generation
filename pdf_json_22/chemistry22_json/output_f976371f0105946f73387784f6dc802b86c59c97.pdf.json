    "abstractText": "To enhance uptake of photosensitizers by epithelial tumor cells by targeting these to EGFR, pyropheophorbide derivatives were synthesized that had erlotinib attached to different positions on the macrocycle. Although the addition of erlotinib reduced cellular uptake, several compounds showed prolonged cellular retention and maintained photodynamic efficacy. The aim of this study was to identify whether erlotinib moiety assists in tumor targeting through interaction with EGFR and whether this interaction inhibits EGFR kinase activity. The activity of the conjugates was analyzed in primary cultures of human head and neck tumor cells with high-level expression of EGFR, and in human carcinomas grown as xenografts in mice. Uptake of erlotinib conjugates did not correlate with cellular expression of EGFR and none of the compounds exerted EGFR-inhibitory activity. One derivative with erlotinib at position 3, PS-10, displayed enhanced tumor cell-specific retention in mitochondria/ER and improved PDT efficacy in a subset of tumor cases. Moreover, upon treatment of the conjugates with therapeutic light, EGFR-inhibitory activity was recovered that attenuated EGFR signal-dependent tumor cell proliferation. This finding suggests that tumor cell-specific deposition of erlotinib-pyropheophorbides, followed by light triggered release of EGFR-inhibitory activity, may improve photodynamic therapy by attenuating tumor growth that is dependent on EGFR-derived signals.",

            "text": "Past studies of carcinoma cells derived from surgical specimens of lung and head and neck (HN) tumor tissues have indicated a large range by which the lead second generation photosensitizer (PS), HPPH [3-(1\u2032-hexyloxy)ethyl-3-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a] is taken up and retained by tumor cells [1,2]. Although tumor cells from ~50% of cases, after placing in primary cultures, showed a preferential retention of HPPH over co-resident stromal cells, tumor cells from other cases indicated substantially reduced retention. By applying variants of HPPH, which differ primarily in the presence of side groups on the tetrapyrrole macrocycle, structural elements for enhanced cancer cell-specific retention have been identified [3\u20135]. Most observed was the prolonged retention of compounds with neutralized charge at position 172, as exemplified by methyl ester derivatives [5]. Not surprisingly, comparable methyl ester derivatives of near-infrared PSs have emerged as optimized compounds entering clinical trials [6,7]. To increase uptake of PSs by tumor cells, a targeted delivery was approached. The rationale was that, because epithelial cancer cells, such as derived from lung, HN, or bladder, have elevated expression of EGFR, uptake of PSs, including HPPH, could be improved by using EGFR-interacting forms [8,9]. The basic strategy was to modify HPPH and related chlorins at different peripheral positions by the addition of the small-molecular\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11081. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231911081 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11081 2 of 17\nEGFR inhibitor erlotinib [10,11]. The initial functional evaluation was made with HPPHrelated pyropheophorbides containing erlotinib conjugated to position 31, 13, 172, or 20 via a benzoic acid linker [11]. The attachment involved either a rigid or flexible, short or long linker structure. The biological assays of the various products were restricted to the quantification of cellular uptake in tissue culture and photodynamic action in vivo using established tumor models. The results identified one erlotinib conjugate, PS 10, which exerted a photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy exceeding that of HPPH. Two interrelated questions remained to be answered concerning the functionality of the erlotinib-pyropheophorbide-a conjugates: (a) to what extent is the EGFR-binding and inhibitory activity of the erlotinib moiety retained and (b) does it contribute to the PDT outcome? We expected that the level of photoreaction mediated by the chlorin portion is not affected by the presence of erlotinib and is proportional to the amount of the PS present in tumor cells [11]. The current study determined the effectiveness of the chimeric photosensitizers to be taken up relative to the level of EGFR expression, to mediate a proportional level of photoreaction, and to modulate EGFR functions. The results demonstrate that erlotinib attached to pyropheophorbide, despite the predicted appropriate structural interaction with the target EGFR site, does not appreciably mediate EGFR-dependent uptake and does not inhibit EGFR kinase activity. However, upon treatment of a subset of erlotinib conjugates with therapeutic light, EGFR-inhibitory activity is recovered that is effective in attenuating EGFR kinase activity and EGFR signal-dependent tumor cell proliferation."

            "text": "The current functional study involved examples of erlotinib chlorin conjugates described previously [11] and which are depicted in Figure 1. The original designations of these compounds were retained to facilitate cross-comparison of data. Sets of erlotinib conjugates had been synthesized to evaluate the functional impact of several specific structural features: flexible or rigid linker (PS 5 vs. PS 8); attachment of erlotinib to position 172 or position 31 (PS 8 vs. PS 10); contribution of an acidic charge at position 172 to cellular retention (PS 10 vs. PS 11); attachment of erlotinib to the meta or para position of the rigid benzyloxy linker (PS 10 vs. PS 16), a chiral methyl group at position 31 of pyropheophorbide (PS 10 vs. PS 19); increase to three erlotinib moieties (PS 8 vs. PS 27); and attachment of erlotinib to position 13 of chlorin e6 with short or long linker structure (PS 38 vs. PS 43). The initial characterization of additional compounds had already ruled out as ineffective those PSs with erlotinib conjugated to position 20 via benzoic acid linker of pyropheophorbide (PS 23) or to the imide ring of purpurinimide (PS 29 and PS 31). Following information regarding cellular activity had been obtained [11]. Erlotinib attached by rigid linker reduced cellular uptake. Uptake was further lowered when erlotinib was placed into para position of the benzyloxy linker. Retention was also attenuated when pyropheophorbide is missing the chiral methyl group at position 31. The intracellular sites of deposition for every PS with a single erlotinib moiety appeared to be the same as for nonconjugated HPPH. The highest level of cellular uptake, but coupled with reduced tumor cell specificity, was determined for PS 5. In contrast, PS 10, although taken up at moderate level, demonstrated highest differential retention by a subset of tumor cells. Uptake and photodynamic activities measured in cell culture systems could be confirmed in vivo using xenografts of established human cancer cell lines. However, none of the preliminary cell studies provided evidence for a specific involvement of an erlotinib-sensitive and EGFR-dependent action. The current study addresses this issue. To be effective as substrate for binding to EGFR, as well as to act as inhibitor of the EGFR kinase, erlotinib conjugates must gain access to the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR protein. Hence, excluded are those compounds that are endocytosed and deposited to lysosomes, such as PS 27. To visualize the mode of cellular entry and intracellular localization of the erlotinib conjugates under investigation, we employed reconstituted co-cultures of\nInt. J. Mol.

Incubations for 30 min demonstrated the immediate and high-level entry of HPPH by diffusion into both cell types and incubation for 24 h yielded maximal level of HPPH accumulation. The subcellular site of deposition is mitochondria/ER, which is clearly distinct from lysosomal compartment (Figure 3A, left 2 panels). The relative retention of HPPH during the subsequent 48 h chase period defined the cell type specificity (Figure 2). Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 19\nFigure 1.

            "text": "Previous studies on the photosensitizing properties of pyropheophorbides, including HPPH, have indicated a tight correlation between the amount of PS taken up by the cells, as determined by the PS fluorescence, and the light-dependent photoreaction mediated by the PS [2]. The photoreaction was quantified by the covalent crosslinking of the latent transcription factor STAT3, loss of EGFR and activation of the stress p38 MAP kinase pathway. The same experimental analysis was applied to erlotinib conjugates. To assess the range of cell-specific PS action, T-EC preparations from different HN tumor samples with distinct binding activity for HPPH, were incubated with erlotinib-conjugates and the relationship of PS retention and response to the photoreaction determined. In the example of an early passage of HN-138 T-EC (larynx tumor), which had indicated a low HPPH-retaining activity, the structurally related pair of PS 10 and PS 11 (differing in the presence of a methylester versus a carboxyl group at position 172) was compared to HPPH and HPPH-ME (Figure 5A,B). Although the carboxylated compounds (HPPH and PS 11) were taken up at several-fold higher levels than the corresponding methylester derivatives (HPPH-ME and PS 10), after 72 h chase, only minor fraction remained (Figure 5A). In contrast, the methylester derivatives showed much lower egress rates with PS 10 as having the highest remaining level. Treatment of these cultures with therapeutic 665-nm light elicited photoreactions, which were proportional to the PS level (Figure 5B). As reported previously, the relative value for STAT3 dimerization in turn predicts the level of 24 h post-PDT survival of the cultures [2]. A survey of >100 separate monoytypic T-EC cultures for their lethal response to HPPH-mediated PDT indicated a \u201cLD50\u201d equivalent when ~1% of cellular STAT3 has been converted into dimers [2]. Complete lethal response was reached with 2\u201310% STAT3 dimerization. Hence, in the case of the HN-138 T-EC cultures used in Figure 5A,B, the effectiveness of PDT by the PSs is ranked PS 10 > HPPH-ME > HPPH > PS 11, with the last one yielding minimal, if any lethal reaction. The application of erlotinib-PS in murine tumor models had indicated an unexpectedly high PDT efficacy for several conjugates. Although the cellular level of these PS did not appreciably exceed that of HPPH, higher lethal cell response and lower tumor recurrence were noted [11]. The standard analysis of PDT-mediated cell death in tissue culture was limited to the determination of cell viability 24 h after therapeutic light treatment. To assess PDT effect on long-term cell survival and recovery of proliferation, the post-PDT culture period must be extended to several days. Moreover, the influence of cellular interaction within the microenvironment of the tumor tissue needs to be considered. Indeed, growth analyses of many HN T-EC preparations have indicated that proliferation of the tumor cells is enhanced by stromal cell-derived growth factors. Hence, to characterize postPDT tumor cell survival and growth, we chose to use reconstituted co-cultures of tumor epithelial and stromal cells as test system. The fact that stromal cells preferentially lost HPPH and erlotinib-conjugates (Figure 2), these cells were expected to survive PDT [14] and to potentially contribute growth-promoting factors to those tumor cells which escaped lethal PDT.\nInt.

Both PSs in the stromal cells and PS 10 in tumor cells were reduced below lethal PDT level, whereas PS 5 in tumor cells was retained at lethal level. Treatment of the co-cultures with 665-nm light followed by 5-day post-PDT incubation in full growth medium resulted, as expected, in the survival of the stromal cells, but with the elimination of all tumor cells (Figure 5C, right side panels). This seemingly paradox lethal action on PS 10-containing tumor cells, which should have survived at least in part, suggested an unexpected contribution of a PDT-dependent process."

Therefore, we focused on determining the effect of the photoreaction on erlotinib conjugates alone. PS 10 dissolved in methanol was exposed to 660-nm light. Light treatment for 16 min (=5.3 J/cm2) led to ~40% reduction of PS fluorescence due to photobleaching. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected over the course of light treatment. The products were added to the cell-based EGFR kinase assay at a concentration equivalent to 3 \u00b5M original PS 10 (Figure 6A). A light treatment-dependent production of EGFR-inhibitory activity was detected. Maximal inhibitory activity was generated by 8 min light treatment (=2.65 J/cm2). Prolonged photoreaction led to a reduced recovery of EGFR-inhibitory activity, probably due destructive oxidative processes [15]. Using the densitometric values for the immunoblot signals for phosphorylated EGFR and ERK, a quantitative estimate of the photochemical release of erlotinib-type activity from PS 10 was obtained (Figure 6B). Three separate sets of photoreactions yielded comparable time course of inhibitor release, although the relative recovery of inhibitory activity was variable. Based on testing serially diluted preparations of erlotinib and light-treated PS 10 (Figure 6C), we estimated a recovery of 1 to 10% of erlotinib-like inhibitory activity from PS 10. Equivalent recovery was obtained with PS 11, but insignificant amount with PS 5 and PS 8. Surprisingly, the photoreaction mediated by PS 27 generated the highest recovery of EGFR-inhibitory activity (Figure 6C), probably due to the presence of triple erlotinib moieties. We interpret the presence of EGFR-inhibitory activity in light-treated subset of erlotinib conjugates to be due to partial photochemical breakdown of the conjugates releasing erlotinib moieties now effective as EGFR kinase inhibitors. The precise molecular structure of the photoproducts in any of the PS preparations remains to be determined.

PS 27 has not been considered for further studies because it does not diffuse into cells, is poorly taken up by HN EC, and is primarily deposited into lysosomes. However, it mediates a photoreaction that releases erlotinib-equivalent activity that is now diffusible, inhibits EGFR activity and attenuates proliferation. Hence, despite its uptake into lysosomes, intact PS 27 could assist in reducing recovery of light-treated tumor cells through attenuation of EGFR signaling. The limiting factor would be the amount of PS 27, or of any other erlotinib conjugate, that can reach tumor tissue, and to be retained by cancer cells for mediating a photoreaction sufficiently effective for production of cell damaging reactive oxygen species [15] and for liberating erlotinib-related products that attenuate localized growth-supporting signaling. Notable is that most of the erlotinib-related activity should be confined to tumor cells. If cells survive the photoreaction, the PS-released erlotinib activity may exert EGFR inhibition and attenuated proliferation. It has already been shown that systemically administered erlotinib in combination with PDT, result in improved PDT outcome, despite the expected action of erlotinib in non-tumor cells [16\u201318]."

            "text": "The experimental work with cell culture models has provided information about preference of tumor epithelial cells for the various PSs (Figure 2), the site of intracellular retention (Figure 3) and the consequence of light-triggered photoreaction (Figures 5\u20137). When attempting to translate this knowledge to the same tumor cell type but grown in vivo, one recognizes that the key information regarding systemic distribution and the level of uptake of the PSs at local tumor tissue needs to be gained through in situ measurements [8]. The subsequent assessment of the relationship between cellular concentration of PS in tumor tissue and immediate PDT response in vivo is expected to be much in line with what has been defined in ex vivo models. The initial characterization of the erlotinib conjugates in murine models of epithelial tumor types had determined the organ distribution [11]. The method of choice was wholebody imaging of PS fluorescence of infused PS preparations. While these analyses had provided an estimate for the gross anatomical location of the PSs as a function of time following injection, the image resolution was insufficient to inform about cellular and subcellular level of each PS. To gain this information and to quantitatively compare retention of key erlotinib-PS conjugates, we resorted to the imaging of tissue cryosections. The same microscopic detection system was used that we have applied to the analysis of tissue cultures. Patient-derived bladder cancer (BC-3) xenografts grown in NSG mice were chosen as test model (Figure 8). BC-3 tumor cells have high level expression of EGFR and form welldefined tumor cell clusters separated by stromal tissue within subcutaneously propagated xenografts. The in vivo properties of three structurally related PSs, PS-531, PS 10 and PS-908, were compared. PS-531 [6] had served as substrate for the synthesis of PS 10. PS-908 [10] tested an alternative position of erlotinib in that erlotinib was conjugated via a benzyl linker to position 172 as found in PS 8. Organ distribution of the PSs was determined 24 h after intravenous injection by fluorescence microscopy of 10 \u00b5m cryosections. All three PSs show uniform and high-level retention in liver with PS-908 reaching the highest concentration. Kidney retained the same PSs in a more heterogenous pattern within tubular cells. BC-3 xenograft on average had level equal to 25% of the liver for PS-531 and PS 10, and 10% of the liver for PS-908. The most relevant information gained by the in vivo experiments as shown in Figure 8 is that the erlotinib conjugates reached within 24 h a fairly uniform access to the tumor cell clusters, were retained by the tumor cells markedly above the stromal area, and presented subcellular deposition as already determined of tissue culture cells. Few regions within large tumor area showed a reduced level of PS fluorescence at the center and elevated level at periphery, suggesting heterogeneity in intra-tumoral distribution or diffusion of the PSs.\nInt.

NSG mice bearing patient-derived bladder cancer (BC-3) xenografts received an intravenous injection of PSs (3 \u03bcmol/kg) and organs were collected 24 h later. Cryosections (10 \u03bcm) were imaged for PS fluorescence and compared to the H&E-stained histology.\nA separate experiment tested the regional distribution of PS 10 in a subcutaneous HNT1 xenograft by using the same treatment and analysis technique as applied for BC3 xenograft-bearing mice. The cryosection of the HNT1 tissue indicated an intra-tumoral distribution of PS 10 with heterogeneity among tumor cell clusters, which was comparable to that seen for BC3 (Supplementary Figure S1). The level of PS fluorescence detected in cryosection allows a prediction about the relative effectiveness of the photoreaction and its impact on cell survival. In the case of PS 10 treatment, the release of EGFR-inhibitory activity as a function of the local concentration of PS 10 may appreciably contribute to the post-PDT programing of the surviving tumor cells, activity of the local stromal cells and of inflammatory cells entering post-PDT site. This suggested mechanism may also explain the higher PDT efficacy of PS 10 compared to HPPH detected in the previous in vivo tumor treatment models [11].\nFigure 8.

            "text": "The functional analyses of erlotinib-pheophorbide conjugates demonstrated that the presence of the tetrapyrrole moiety prevents an effective interaction of the erlotinib moiety with the cytoplasmic receptor domain involved in kinase activity. Despite the predicted correct structural presentation of the bound erlotinib to the ATP binding site, the dominant lipid nature and preference for membrane association of the pheophorbide moiety seemingly prevents this to occur. Hence, the originally envisioned targeting function of erlotinib to direct a photosensitizer to EGFR-expressing cells is not observed. However, the results of the study of tumor cell type-specific retention indicates that erlotinib, separate to\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 11081 16 of 17\nits EGFR-binding property, also represents a structural element that in combination with the attached pheophorbide gained a favorable binding activity to the mitochondria/ER components. The susceptibility of some of the erlotinib conjugates to react to the lightactivated oxidative process by a degrading process deliberating product(s) with erlotinib properties indicates a non-anticipated benefit for PDT of EGFR signal-dependent tumor. The localized action of these products, within the timeframe of its effective retention in the microenvironment of the tumor tissue, will moderate EGFR-directed signaling in all resident cell types. Some of these activities are thought to be in part responsible for the heightened PDT action on tumors in vivo.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms231911081/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: E.C.T. and R.R.C. were instrumental for: investigation, methodology, formal analysis and validation.
