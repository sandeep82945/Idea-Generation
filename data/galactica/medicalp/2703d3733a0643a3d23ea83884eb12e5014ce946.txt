This cross-sectional study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital’s rehabilitation clinic, aimed to validate Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) results obtained through plantar pressure analysis using commercial smart insoles (SPPB-SI) and to compare these results to manually acquired results by an experienced examiner (SPPB-M). This study included 40 independent-walking inpatients and outpatients aged 50 or older. SPPB-SI and SPPB-M were administered concurrently, with the smart insoles providing plantar pressure data that were converted into time–pressure curves. Two interpreters assessed the curves, determining component completion times for the SPPB-SI scores. Among the 40 participants (mean age: 72.98, SD: 9.27), the mean total SPPB-SI score was 7.72 ± 2.50, and the mean total SPPB-M score was 7.95 ± 2.63. The time recordings and measured scores of each SPPB-SI component exhibited high reliability with interand intra-interpreter correlation coefficients of 0.9 and 0.8 or higher, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the total SPPB-SI and SPPB-M scores was 0.831 (p < 0.001), and that between the component scores of the two measurements ranged from 0.837 to 0.901 (p < 0.001). Consistent correlations with geriatric functional parameters were observed for both SPPB-SI and SPPB-M. This study underscores the potential of commercial smart insoles as reliable tools for conducting SPPB assessments. 1. conclusions The SPPB-SI, based on plantar pressure analysis using commercial smart insoles, demonstrated excellent agreement with the SPPB-M measured using a standardized protocol. These findings highlight the potential of smart insoles as reliable SPPB inspection devices.
