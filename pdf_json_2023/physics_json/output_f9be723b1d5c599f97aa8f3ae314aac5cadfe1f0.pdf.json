Since the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of emvododstat in humans is time-dependent, a repeat dose study design using a combination of microtracer radioactivity and high radioactivity doses was employed to evaluate the metabolism and excretion of emvododstat near steady state. Seven healthy male subjects each received 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat daily oral doses for 6 days followed by a 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci high radioactivity oral dose on Day 7. Following the last 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat dose on Day 6, total radioactivity in plasma peaked at 6 h post-dose. Following a high radioactivity oral dose (16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci) of 14C-emvododstat on Day 7, both whole blood and plasma radioactivity peaked at 6 h, rapidly declined from 6 h to 36 h postdose, and decreased slowly thereafter with measurable radioactivity at 240 h post-dose. The mean cumulative recovery of the administered dose was 6.0% in urine and 19.9% in feces by 240 h post-dose, and the mean extrapolated recovery to infinity was 37.3% in urine and 56.6% in feces. Similar metabolite profiles were observed after repeat daily microtracer radioactivity oral dosing on Day 6 and after a high radioactivity oral dose on Day 7.

            "text": "Emvododstat, also known as PTC299 (Figure 1), is an orally bioavailable, small molecule originally identified as an inhibitor of the translation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA) mRNA (Cao et al., 2016), and was developed as an oncology agent for the treatment of solid tumors (Bender Ignacio et al., 2016; Packer et al., 2015; Weetall, et al., 2016). Later research revealed that emvododstat\u2019s mechanism of action is due to its direct and potent inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme, a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis (Cao et al., 2019). In vitro studies demonstrated that emvododstat is more potent against leukemic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), than against solid tumors (Branstrom et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2019). Emvododstat also showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity, and most importantly, emvododstat potently inhibited viral replication and suppressed induction of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 (SARSCoV-2) cell-based assays (Luban et al., 2021). Based on these results, emvododstat has the potential to address unmet needs in certain cancers and RNA virus infection diseases, where cancer cells or viruses rely on the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides for survival or rapid proliferation. Emvododstat is now under clinical development for the treatment of AML and for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. In vitro metabolism studies showed that O-demethylation followed by glucuronidation were the major metabolic pathways for emvododstat; multiple CYPs appeared to be involved in emvododstat metabolism; emvododstat and O-desmethyl emvododstat were both inhibitors of CYP2D6 and BCRP transporter, but neither of them was a substrate for common efflux or uptake transporters investigated (Ma et al., 2022a). Following oral administration, emvododstat is bioavailable in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys; the absorption is generally slow, and the plasma exposure of less pharmacologically active Odesmethyl emvododstat is lower than that of parent emvododstat in rodents, but relatively higher in dogs and monkeys (Ma et al., 2022a). Following a single oral dose in rats and dogs, excretion of 14C-emvododstat-derived radioactivity was faster in dogs than in rats, while urinary excretion was minimal (<1% of dose) in both rats and dogs; emvododstat was the dominant radioactive component in\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n7\nrat plasma and feces, and was also the dominant radioactive component in dog feces, while emvododstat and two of its metabolites (O-desmethyl emvododstat and M312) were the major circulating components in dog plasma (Ma et al., 2022b). Emvododstat has been administered to healthy subjects, patients with solid tumors, AML, and hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 infection. Following a single oral dose of emvododstat from 0.03 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the mean Tmax was observed in a range of 3.5 to 5.3 h. While maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increased in a dose-proportional manner, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) generally increased more than dose-proportionally with increasing dose from 0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg (Weetall et al., 2016). Plasma exposure of O-desmethyl emvododstat in human subjects was low, 1.3 to 4.5% of emvododstat AUC after single oral dose of emvododstat, but this ratio increased to 9.6 to 38% after repeat 40 mg twice daily (BID), 80 mg BID, and 100 mg BID dosing for 28 days in HIV infected patients with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (Bender Ignacio et al., 2016). Both emvododstat and O-desmethyl emvododstat had long plasma terminal half-life (T1/2), and the T1/2 was dose dependent: longer T1/2 was observed with escalating dose (Weetall et al., 2016). As advocated by the recent FDA draft guidance for human radiolabeled mass balance studies, if the investigational drug and/or active metabolite(s) exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics, the subjects should receive a single radiolabeled dose of the drug after reaching steady state with non-radiolabeled doses, and the bioanalysis of the non-radiolabeled moieties at steady state should be conducted to help interpret the results because this approach only evaluates the clearance pathway of the radiolabeled drug (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, May 2022). For such dosing regimen, however, quantification of nonradiolabeled moieties is not possible for unknown metabolites or if the reference standards of the known metabolites are not readily available. On the other hand, although the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of the total drug and metabolites (radio-labeled and nonlabelled) may have reached steady state following a single radioactivity dose preceded by repeat dosing with nonradiolabeled drug, since the overall quantification is based on the radioactivity measurement derived from\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n8\nthe last radioactive dose, and the unlabeled parent and metabolites already in the body are not accounted for, such dosing regimen is still considered as a single radioactive dose. With the increasing application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) technology in pharmaceutical industry, we believe that at the same total therapeutic dose, repeated daily microtracer radioactivity dosing followed by a traditional high radioactivity dose is a practical and better approach to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion (AME) properties of compounds with non-linear PK or for which the metabolism is time-dependent. AMS analysis of matrices (plasma, urine and feces) from the last microtracer radioactivity dosing provides AME properties at or near the steady state, while liquid scintillation counting of the samples from the traditional, higher radioactivity dose provides rich information such as mass balance and metabolite formation and elimination kinetics at a reasonable cost. Here we report AME properties of emvododstat in healthy human subjects at close to the steady state by applying a dedicated study design that includes repeated daily microtracer radioactivity oral dosing followed by a high radioactivity oral dose.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n9"

An Independent Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the clinical study protocol, any clinical study protocol amendments, subject information sheets, written informed consent forms, and other relevant documentation. Prior to participation in the study, each subject was apprised of the nature and purpose of the study, and informed consent was obtained. Since metabolism of emvododstat in humans appears to be time-dependent (Weetall et al., 2016), in order to evaluate emvododstat metabolism near steady state, a study design using repeat daily oral doses containing microtracer radioactivity followed by a single oral dose with high radioactivity was adopted in this study. Available data from previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients indicated that a dose of up to 80 mg once daily (QD) in a tablet formulation is a safe dose to be used in clinical studies with healthy volunteers. The current study was performed with an oral solution of emvododstat at a dose of 16 mg QD, which was expected to provide similar exposure to emvododstat as the 40 to 80 mg QD in a tablet formulation. The 0.3 \u00b5Ci or 11.1 kBq 14C-emvododstat microtracer radioactivity dose was projected to be adequate for the detection of emvododstat and its metabolites using AMS. The estimated effective radiation burden after a single oral radioactivity dose of 100 \u00b5Ci or 3.7 MBq 14C-emvododstat was estimated to be approximately 0.48 mSv.

The clinical phase of the study was conducted at ICON (Groningen, the Netherlands). A total of 7 healthy male subjects between 19 and 32 years of age and with a body mass index between 20.6 and 28.0 kg/m2 participated in the study. All subjects were white. On Days 1 to 6, each subject received a 16 mg (0.3 \u00b5Ci or 11.1 kBq) QD oral dose of 14C-emvododstat after at least 10 h overnight fasting. Following the last oral dose on Day 6, blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h post-dose, urine samples were collected from 0 to 12 and 12 to 24 h and fecal samples were collected 0 to 24 h in all subjects post Day 6 dose. On Day 7, each subject received a single oral dose of 16 mg (100 \u00b5Ci or 3.7 MBq) 14C-emvododstat. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 h and at 24 h intervals up to 240 h post-dose, and urine and fecal samples were collected continuously over 24 h intervals up to 240 h post Day 7 dose. By the 240 h collection period, none of the subjects met the discharge criteria (\u2265 90% of the dose recovered or < 0.5% of the dose excreted in urine and feces combined in 2 consecutive 24 h collection intervals) and all subjects were invited for 5 additional followup visits with 24 h urine and feces collection periods: all subjects returned for additional follow-up on Day 23 and Day 30, 3 subjects on Day 45, and 2 subjects on Day 59 and Day 73.

Sample preparation for total radioactivity analysis Total radioactivity (TRA) in plasma, urine and fecal samples post Day 6 dose (16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci or 11.1 kBq) was measured using AMS at The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO, Leiden, The Netherlands). For AMS analysis, a reference standard ANU sucrose-8542 (C12H22O11) with a certified 14C/12C isotope ratio was used to check the performance of the instrument; 5 standard samples and 2 quality control samples were included in each batch analysis with a minimum of three replicates (van Duijn et al., 2014).\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n11\nTRA in blood, plasma, urine and fecal samples post Day 7 dose (16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci or 3.7 MBq) was measured using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) at ICON (Groningen, the Netherlands).

The product ions at m/z 310.0503 of (C17H11O2N2Cl\u02d9 +), 282.0554 (C16H11ON2Cl\u02d9 +) and 253.0605 (C15H10N2Cl +) were observed.

            "text": "Emvododstat is a lipophilic, neutral compound with low aqueous solubility. Following a single oral dose in male Long-Evans rats, distribution of 14C-emvododstat-derived radioactivity was extensive with the endocrine, fatty, and secretory tissues containing the highest radioactivity (Ma et al., 2022b). Consistent with extensive distribution and retention in fatty tissues in male Long-Evans rats, excretion of 14C-emvododstat-derived radioactivity in intact male SD rats was slow following a single oral dose, approximately 65% of the dose (0.3% in urine and 54.7% in feces while 35.4% in carcass) within 7 days post-dose in rats. In contrast, approximately 93% of dose was recovered by 8 days post-dose with most of the radioactivity excreted in 0-24 h feces following a single oral dose in dogs. The faster excretion in dogs was most likely due to lower absorption as indicated by the observation that close to 80% of dose was excreted in 0-24 h feces and >94% of fecal radioactivity was attributed to unchanged emvododstat with little contribution from metabolites (Ma et al., 2022b). Following a single oral 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat dose on Day 7 in human subjects in the current study, approximately 26% of the dose (6 % in urine and 19.9% in feces) was recovered by 240 h postdose. Additional 24 h collection intervals were used to follow-up the excretion until 1608 h post-dose. The total recovery as extrapolated to infinity in the current study was 94.7% (37.3 % in urine and 56.6% in feces) (Table 4). Urinary excretion of 14C-emvododstat-derived radioactivity was low in both rats and dogs (<1% dose within 8 days post oral dose), but was much higher, 6% of the dose by 240 h post-dose and up to 37% of the dose extrapolated to infinity, in human subjects (Table 4). Since the metabolism of emvododstat in humans appears to be time dependent (Bender Ignacio et al., 2016), a study design with a 6-day once daily 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci oral dosing followed by a 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci oral dose was adopted in order to evaluate mass balance and emvododstat metabolism near the steady state. Similar metabolite profiles were observed between Day 6 and Day 7 in all matrices following repeat once daily oral dosing of 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat for 6 days or following a single oral 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat dose on Day 7. Following the last 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat oral dose on Day 6, emvododstat was the dominant component in plasma, accounting for 51.0% of TRA in the\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n20\n0-24 h plasma pool, while M443, O-desmethyl emvododstat glucuronide and O-desmethyl emvododstat, accounting for 14.1, 11.7 and 9.6% of TRA, respectively, were the most abundant metabolites in 0-24 h plasma after the last 16 mg/0.3 \u00b5Ci dose on Day 6. Other metabolites were much less abundant, each accounting for less than 4% of the 0-24 h plasma radioactivity (Table 2). Emvododstat was not detectable while M474, accounting for 72.5% of TRA, was the dominant metabolite in 0-24 h urine on Day 6. Emvododstat and O-desmethyl emvododstat were the most abundant components, accounting for 20.3 and 47.2% of TRA, respectively, in 0-24 h feces on Day 6 (Table 3). Following 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci 14C-emvododstat oral dose on Day 7, unchanged emvododstat was the most abundant circulating entity, accounting for 35.6% of AUC of 0-240 h plasma TRA; M443 and O-desmethyl emvododstat glucuronide were the most abundant metabolites, accounting for 15.0% and 11.7% of plasma TRA, respectively; O-desmethyl emvododstat, M474, M298, and M312 were less abundant metabolites, accounting for 8.61, 7.41, 4.66, and 4.31% of AUC0-240 TRA, respectively (Table 2). In 0-240 h urine, emvododstat was not detectable and M474 was the most abundant metabolite, accounting for 4.06% of the dose (Table 3). In 0-240 h feces, emvododstat accounted for 1.63% of the dose, and O-desmethyl emvododstat was the most abundant metabolite, accounting for 8.97% of the dose; other metabolites M298, M443, M312, and M324 were less abundant, accounting for 1.15, 1.09, 0.76, and 0.50% of the dose, respectively (Table 3). It should be noted that except for O-desmethyl emvododstat and its glucuronide, both peaking at 6 h postdose, formation of all other metabolites was slow with Tmax observed from 144 to 240 h following a single oral 16 mg/100 \u00b5Ci dose on Day 7 in human subjects (Table 2). Due to slow elimination of TRA as observed from 36 to 240 h post-dose, concentrations of these slowly forming metabolites were low and therefore were hard to accurately measure using the scintillation counting approach. For this end, it is advantageous that metabolites were enriched after a 6-day repeat daily microtracer radioactivity dosing and quantified using the most sensitive AMS detection technique in combination with the plasma AUC pooling strategy (Hop et al., 1998). For example, M443, M312, and M298 were not detectable or barely detectable by LSC within 24 h after a single high radioactivity dose on Day 7 but can be adequately detected by AMS in 0-24 h plasma following repeat daily microtracer radioactivity doses for 6 days\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n21\n(Table 2). A follow-up high radioactivity dose on Day 7 provided the desired mass balance data and most importantly, the plasma metabolite kinetics, generating useful and complementary distribution results for the Day 6 plasma metabolite data. As noted above, different radioactivity detection techniques were used to analyze samples following the Day 6 microtracer radioactivity dose and the Day 7 high radioactivity dose: after the last microtracer radioactivity dosing on Day 6, one plasma AUC pool, one urine pool and one feces pool from all subjects were profiled using AMS technology, while pooled plasma at individual timepoints and one pooled urine and feces from all subjects were analyzed using traditional scintillation counting techniques. Compared with the high radioactivity dose (100 \u00b5Ci) on Day 7, the microtracer dose (0.3 \u00b5Ci/day) is negligible and the resulting radioactivity after repeated dosing is too low to be detected by less sensitive scintillation counting technique, and thus the Day 7 dose is considered a single dose that the plasma radioactivity was lower in Day 7 plasma than in Day 6 plasma (Figure 2). Although the profiles are qualitatively similar to each other for each matrix obtained after the last microtracer radioactivity dose on Day 6 and after the high radioactivity dose on Day 7, we believe the differences of relative abundance between the 2 profiles are largely due to repeat dosing vs single dosing, but other factors, such as analytical method used and sample pooling strategy (AUC pool vs individual time point plasma pool, and 0-24 h pool for Day 6 samples vs 0-240 h pool for samples after Day 7 dose) cannot be excluded. A head-to-head comparison using AMS analysis on diluted Day 7 samples might provide additional information in this regard. In other clinical studies that used similar daily oral doses, both emvododstat and O-desmethyl emvododstat reached steady state in approximately 2 weeks, therefore, steady state may not have been reached after 6 daily doses in the current study. Due to the limitation of tedious sample processing and long analysis time in the AMS analysis, similar to plasma sample analysis, urine and fecal samples were analyzed using different method, therefore the differences between Day 6 and Day 7 profiles may also be contributed by analytical methods as well as by dosing frequency. Therefore, additional head-to-head sample analysis is needed to get a clear answer. Nevertheless, the current study design clearly shows the added value of repeated microtracer radioactivity dosing for drugs with slow metabolism and disposition,\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n22\nwhere steady state metabolite profiles might be different from single dose metabolite profiles. The new FDA mass balance guidance suggests that one could employ a single radiolabeled dose of the investigational drug after reaching steady state with non-radiolabeled doses for such drugs. Because this approach only evaluates the clearance pathway of the radiolabeled drug, bioanalysis of the nonradiolabeled moieties at steady state should be conducted to help interpret the results (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, May 2022). However, bioanalytical methods may not be available for all \u2018moieties\u2019, especially if such studies are conducted at the early stage as FDA advocated in that same draft guidance. On the other hand, quantification of non-radiolabeled moieties is not possible if the metabolites are not ambiguously identified or if the reference standards of the known metabolites are not available. In such situations, the repeated microtracer radioactivity dose study design may be a better choice to allow for full metabolite profiling at or near steady state if drug or metabolite exhibits time-dependent pharmacokinetics, without the need for non-radiolabeled metabolite synthesis and bioanalytical method development. In our opinion, such design may be considered for other investigational drugs that show slow metabolism or for which metabolite formation is time dependent. Theoretically, the amount of drug input equals the amount of drug excretion during the same dosing period at true steady state. If one is able to dose the subject close to the true steady state, and obtain all needed data (e.g. plasma PK based on individual time points and mass balance etc.) after the last microtracer radioactivity dosing using more sensitive but costly AMS analysis, then the high radioactivity dose may be optional and the only advantage of such a dose is to obtain excretion kinetics, if the elimination of radioactivity is slow like in our current study. Obviously, more research is needed to optimize such study designs and to maximize outcome with reasonable use of resources. Following a single oral dose of 14C-emvododstat in rats and dogs, emvododstat was the dominant radioactive component in rat plasma while emvododstat and its two metabolites (O-desmethyl emvododstat and M312) were the major circulating components in dog plasma (Ma et al., 2022b). Although O-demethylation followed by glucuronidation are the common pathways in rats, dogs, and\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n23\nhumans, the N-carbamoyl ester link was stable in rats while labile in dogs and humans: hydrolysis on the amide side led to the formation of M312 and subsequently M324, M298 and M474 in dogs and humans, while hydrolysis or transesterification on the ester side resulted in the formation of M443 in humans. LC/MS data indicate that M443 is a serine conjugate metabolite of emvododstat possibly through the transesterification mechanism. Serine is a nonessential amino acid that is the precursor for cysteine, selenocysteine, tryptophan, glycine, and phospholipids, and plays a role in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines (Reitzer, 2009). Serine conjugates with xenobiotics (Steventon and Hutt, 2002; Ravenzwaay et al., 2003; Aloysius et al., 2008) and endogenous serine conjugates with lipids such as N-arachidonoyl-serine (Milman et al., 2006) and N-stearoyl serine (Tan et al., 2010) have been reported in animal species, but the formation of serine conjugate metabolites of xenobiotics in humans seems to be rare. Nevertheless, additional research is needed to better understand the formation of M443 and the relevance of emvododstat metabolites to the efficacy and safety of emvododstat in humans. In conclusions, since the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of emvododstat in humans is time-dependent, the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of emvododstat were investigated by using a combination approach of microtracer radioactivity and high radioactivity doses. Resolution of challenges due to slow metabolism and elimination of a lipophilic compound highlighted in this study was achieved by repeat daily microtracer radioactivity oral dosing followed by a high radioactivity oral dosing at therapeutically relevant doses. Such design may provide an alternative approach to better understand AME properties of investigational drugs that show slow metabolism or for which metabolite formation is time dependent.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 12, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n24"
