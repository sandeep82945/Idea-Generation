Heterogeneity in MS clinical presentation has posed a major challenge for identifying genetic variants associated with disease outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we used prospectively ascertained clinical outcomes data from the largest international MS Registry, MSBase. We assembled a cohort of deeply phenotyped individuals with relapse-onset MS. We used unbiased genome-wide association study and machine learning approaches to assess the genetic contribution to longitudinally defined MS severity phenotypes in 1,813 individuals. Our results did not identify any variants of moderate to large effect sizes that met genome-wide significance thresholds. However, we demonstrate that clinical outcomes in relapse-onset MS are associated with multiple genetic loci of small effect sizes. Using a machine learning approach incorporating over 62,000 variants and demographic variables available at MS disease onset, we could predict severity with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.83 \u2013 0.91). This approach, if externally validated, could quickly prove useful for clinical stratification at MS onset. Further, we find evidence to support central nervous system and mitochondrial involvement in determining MS severity.\n.

It affects approximately 2.8 million people worldwide, predominantly females.1 Rates of disability progression and long-term outcomes are highly heterogeneous amongst people with relapse-onset MS (RMS).2 At present, the ability to predict a person\u2019s likely long-term disease outcome at onset is very limited, but highly desirable, in order to stratify individuals for initiation with the most appropriate disease-modifying therapy.\nTo-date, over 230 common variants have been linked to MS risk.3 The only replicated genetic modifier of MS phenotype is carriage of the principal risk allele, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*15:01. In European populations, carriage of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele confers younger age of onset.4 However, large studies have shown that this allele has no effect on MS progression after onset.5, 6 Further, there is strong evidence to suggest that currently known risk variants, aside from HLA-DRB1*15:01, play no major role in determining MS severity.7-9\nA genetic influence on MS outcome is, however, plausible, in particular relating to the severity of secondary inflammation (e.g. development of slowly expanding, or chronic rim-active lesions), resilience to neuroaxonal injury, or remyelination capacity. Indeed, preliminary genome-wide association study (GWAS) evidence suggests that susceptibility and severity likely involve distinct biological processes and pathways.10-12\nThe best evidence to-date for a genetic contribution to disease outcomes comes from a small number of cross-sectional GWAS dedicated to a search for severity signals associated with the MS severity scale (MSSS) score13, or age at onset.9, 10, 14-17 However, these signals failed to reach significance at the genome-wide level, possibly due to inclusion of populations with both relapse-onset and progressiveonset clinical courses. As the genetic architecture underlying worsening in relapse-onset MS and progressive-onset MS is possibly distinct,18 it could be important to study these populations separately. Further, use of limited cross-sectional phenotypic MSSS data to assess disease severity limits accurate severity phenotyping due to both major ceiling effects and instability in RMS.13\nThe heterogeneity in MS severity, both between individuals, and within individuals over time, is large. Therefore, analysis of longitudinally acquired clinical trajectories over many years is likely to be more reliable for accurate severity assignation. Given that preliminary evidence suggests that genetic variation influences severity outcomes, we used both unbiased genome-wide association, and\n.

Our secondary analyses further interrogated SNV signals derived from our primary analyses, and also aimed to replicate previously reported suggestive markers of MS severity using a targeted approach."

Assessment of the genomic locations of SNVs with p<1x10-5 for the l-ARMSS phenotype demonstrated that 55.1% (p=6.63x10-3 for enrichment) of the signals were in intergenic regions and 34.7% were intronic (Figure S5a). This was numerically different to the I-MSSS endpoint analysis, where 47.9% of SNVs were intronic (p=5.41x10-3 for enrichment) and 36.8% were intergenic (p=0.0193; Figure S5b).

            "text": "Two of the fundamental, unanswered questions with respect to relapsing-remitting MS are first, what is the source of the marked clinical disease heterogeneity? That is, why do some people with RMS have a rapidly progressing, severely disabling disease course, whilst others do not? And second, can we utilise genetic and other information to predict MS outcomes?\nHere, through a series of analyses that took advantage of a unique, multicentre, prospectively ascertained, longitudinal, clinical dataset,24 we can shed some light on the genetic architecture that underpins MS clinical heterogeneity. Our primary, unbiased GWAS analyses demonstrate that there are no common variants with moderate to large effect sizes that contribute to MS severity. With time, and very large cohorts, we will likely confirm that MS severity is at least partially determined by polygenic mechanisms of small effect size. Alternatively, we may find that variants which influence severity may be time-variable, rather than having a constant effect.25 Importantly, our results suggest that disease outcomes are not under strong genetic control. Indeed our study results demonstrated that common genetic variants explained only 20% of severity heritability, with wide error margins. Therefore, suggesting that, as clinical experience shows, outcomes are, to an extent, modifiable with appropriate and early disease-modifying therapy (DMT) intervention.26-28 This is further underscored in the modern era where, with the introduction of DMT, rates of disability accumulation have slowed, and fewer disabling cases are being seen, relative to historical cohorts.29-33 Future pharmacogenomic studies34 may prove to be invaluable to guide precise prescription practices to further slow progression or modify disease outcomes. The complex interplay between genes and the environment likely additionally plays a significant role in outcome modulation. It has been shown that disability accumulation may be modified by additional lifestyle factors such as pregnancy27 and smoking cessation.35 Epigenetic studies may therefore shed further light on relevant, modifiable mechanisms that regulate MS outcomes.\nThe application of machine learning to GWAS data is considered by some36 to be the \u201clast hope\u201d to gain meaningful insights for complex diseases where no variants meet significance thresholds. Our machine learning algorithm was unable to provide additional biological insights into the underlying genetic architecture of MS severity, instead reinforcing that common SNVs independently\n.

Regardless, machine learning was able to predict non-linear effects and large SNV clusters that can accurately classify MS outcomes, and may prove to be of prognostic utility. Whilst we retained the MS susceptibility wGRS in our algorithm, it was not a major contributor to our predictive model, again consistent with our above findings, and past reports demonstrating that MS risk variants have little influence on severity outcomes.7 The classification accuracy of our machine learning algorithm increased with the addition of age at onset. In fact, age at onset was one of the strongest predictors of outcome in our machine learning models, consistent with past reports.27 Our machine learning algorithm was designed with internal checks to prevent data over fitting. We used a slow learning rate, with a 70/30 training/testing set and internal bootstrapping over 20,000 learning iterations. We achieved positive predictive values for outcome assignation of between 0.889 \u2013 0.844 and negative predictive values in the range of 0.851 \u2013 0.853. To our knowledge, this is a world first for MS genetic studies. Whilst a previous ML study successfully predicted MS severity,37 this was predicated on health records, and data that take years to decades to obtain e.g. change in clinical parameters between years \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 to predict \u2018z\u2019. The variables included in our classification algorithm are readily available at disease onset. With the rapid decrease in the cost of beadchip genotyping, and high PPV and NPV we achieved, our machine learning algorithm could readily translate into clinical practice upon validation in an independent cohort.\nIn our secondary analyses, we replicated the association between the main MS risk allele HLADRB1*15:01 and age at onset.4, 6 Further, ours is the first study to replicate rs868824, intronic to IMMP2L,10 as being associated with age at onset in a targeted analysis. IMMP2L, an inner mitochondrial membrane protease, has been associated with cellular senescence,38 ovarian aging via oxidative stress and estrogen-mediated pathways,39 together with neurological disorders.40-43 Recent evidence points to accelerated cellular senescence and biological aging in people MS,44-46 and suggests that these factors may reduce remyelination capacity.45 The validation of the association of rs868824 with age at onset, is a first step towards understanding the potential biological mechanisms underlying accelerated cellular senescence in MS.\nThe integration of the top SNVs identified in our de novo GWAS analyses into hard EDSS disability milestone survival analyses, again identified variants intronic to or near genes implicated in mitochondrial function: rs111399831, nearest to SUCLA2, and rs9643199 intronic to MTSS1; as well as variants intronic to genes implicated in CNS function: rs7289446 intronic to SEZ6L, rs295254 intronic to RCL1, rs9643199 intronic to MTSS1, rs2776741 nearest to RCAN3AS, and rs7070182 Intronic to TCF7L2.

Most importantly, these variants identify highly biologically and clinically plausible leads for potential replication of clinical heterogeneity in similar or larger cohorts.\nSUCLA2 is expressed in the brain and muscle, and encodes the beta-subunit of succinate-CoA ligase, an enzyme required for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.47 Variations in MTSS1 have been reported to associate with mitochondrial complex 1 deficiency in ClinVar (SCV001137705.1, SCV001137706.1). The variants we describe here are intronic to, or near to these genes, and are likely to be tagging rather than causal. However, together with IMMP2L, we describe three variants associated with mitochondrial function, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a recognised pathophysiological hallmark of CNS injury in MS.48, 49\nWhilst MTSS1 has been reported to associate with mitochondrial function, it has primarily been described in the context of B-cell mediated immunity,50 and various CNS pathologies.51,52 Most relevant perhaps to MS outcomes, is the association between MTSS1, cortical volume, and Purkinje cell dendritic arborization.53, 54 SEZ6L, the top signal in both l-ARMSS and l-MSSS analyses, is implicated in dendritic spine density variation, and arborization in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex.20 Disruptions in SEZ6L cause neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative conditions, as well as having a role in motor function.20, 55, 56 Copy number variation in RCL1, has also been associated with severe psychiatric disease,57 and depression.58 Progressive synaptic loss, or synaptopathy, is a hallmark of MS pathology;59, 60 evident in both acutely active demyelinating lesions,61 as well as chronic inactive lesions.62 It has been shown that loss of synaptic density is associated with network dysfunction,60 implicating a failure of synaptic plasticity to compensate for immune-mediated neural damage. It is therefore plausible that the variants identified in this study implicate a genetic susceptibility to impaired compensatory mechanisms, or impaired neural survival in those with severe MS. This of course requires independent validation but raises an intriguing new line of enquiry.\nInterestingly, we identified a variant intronic to TCF7L2 as associated with severity in males. TCF7L2 is a transcription factor involved in Wnt signalling pathways, and associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.63 Critically in the context of our study, TCF7L2 has been shown to maintain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the progenitor state, acting as a molecular switch that can inhibit Wnt signalling to promote oligodendroglial differentiation.64 Why this variant was\n.

However, the role of TCF7L2 in MS severity requires further investigation. Interestingly, gene set enrichment analyses revealed that both Wnt signalling pathway components together with progesterone response pathways were enriched in our analyses. Progesterone is a known regulator of myelin development, as well as having neuroprotective effects,65 lending support to the notion that genetic susceptibility to impaired remyelination predisposes to more severe MS.\nOur tissue enrichment analyses specifically pointed towards genes enriched in cerebellar function. The cerebellum plays a key role in motor coordination as well as cognition.66 It has long been held26 and recently confirmed,67 that cerebellar signs and symptoms are a predictor of poor prognosis in MS. The results of our analyses therefore point to highly relevant and biologically plausible genetic explanations for clinically observed disease heterogeneity.\nOur multicentre study was conducted using rigorously defined and prospectively collected longitudinal clinical and treatment data from the MSBase Registry, making our cohort globally unique. Due to the nature of this cohort, we were unable to validate our results in an equivalent dataset, therefore, the data presented herein require independent validation. We did try to overcome this limitation by testing top SNV signals using alternate definitions of disease severity, namely survival analyses of time to irreversible disability milestones. Similarly, our ML analyses were performed using a conservative 70/30 training/testing split relative to the traditional 80/20 split, accompanied with internal bootstrapping. Our efforts to expand our cohort for future analyses are ongoing.\nHere we report an important milestone in our progress towards understanding the clinical heterogeneity of MS outcomes, implicating functionally distinct mechanisms to MS risk. We demonstrate that common genetic variants of moderate to large effect sizes do not contribute to MS severity. In secondary sex-stratified analyses, we identified two genetic loci that surpassed GWAS significance thresholds, providing evidence of sex dimorphism in MS severity. We identified a further six variants with strong evidence for regulating clinical outcomes. We observed an overrepresentation of genes expressed in CNS compartments generally, and specifically in the cerebellum. These involved mitochondrial function, synaptic plasticity, cellular senescence, calcium and g-protein receptor signalling pathways. Importantly, we demonstrate that machine learning using common SNV clusters, together with clinical variables readily available at diagnosis can improve prognostic capabilities at\n.
