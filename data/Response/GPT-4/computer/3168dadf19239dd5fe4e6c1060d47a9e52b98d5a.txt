Enhancing Sensitivity and Specificity of E-Nose Devices for Early COVID-19 Detection: Future research could focus on optimizing the sensor arrays and machine learning algorithms in e-nose devices to improve their sensitivity and specificity. This would involve the development of sensors capable of detecting lower concentrations of COVID-19 specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human breath and the creation of more sophisticated algorithms that can accurately differentiate between COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases based on VOC profiles.

Longitudinal Studies on VOC Biomarkers Across Different Stages of COVID-19: Conducting longitudinal studies to investigate changes in VOC emissions from patients over the course of their COVID-19 infection. This research could help in understanding the progression of the disease and in identifying VOC biomarkers that are specific to different stages of the infection, including asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe cases.

Investigating the Role of Co-infections and Pre-existing Conditions: Exploring how co-infections (e.g., with other viruses or bacteria) and pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma) affect the VOC biomarker profiles of COVID-19 patients. This research would aid in refining e-nose diagnostics to account for these variables, potentially leading to more accurate and personalized disease detection.

Integration of E-Nose Technologies with Other Diagnostic Tools: Researching the integration of e-nose technologies with other diagnostic methods (e.g., rapid antigen tests, PCR tests) to create a comprehensive diagnostic toolkit for COVID-19. This could involve developing multimodal diagnostic platforms that leverage the strengths of each method to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in disease detection.

Development of Portable and Wearable E-Nose Devices for Real-Time Monitoring: Focusing on the development of portable and wearable e-nose devices that can be used for real-time monitoring of individuals at high risk of COVID-19 exposure. These devices could be used in healthcare settings, public spaces, or by individuals in their homes to provide continuous monitoring of VOC emissions, enabling early detection and isolation of infected individuals to prevent disease spread.
