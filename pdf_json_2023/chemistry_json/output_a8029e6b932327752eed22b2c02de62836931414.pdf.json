            "text": "Soft corals of the genus Sinularia (subclass Octocorallia, order Alcyonacea, family Alcyoniidae) have been well studied by organic chemists for a long time [1,2]. To date, hundreds of secondary metabolites have been discovered in approximately 50 species of this genus [2]. Chemically, the structures of these metabolites can be classified into three main types, namely terpenes, steroids, and prostaglandins, which are responsible for a diverse range of significant bioactivities, especially cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory potentials [1\u20133]. The first chemical and biological study on the soft coral S. nanolobata was performed in 1997, resulting in the isolation of four cytotoxic amphilectane-type diterpenoids [4]. In the following decades, a variety of diterpenoids, nor-diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, nor-sesquiterpenoids, steroids, seco-steroids, and steroidal glycosides, which exhibited interesting biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and neuroprotective activities, were isolated from the titled animals [5\u201313]. Their unique structures and excellent bioactivities attracted our ongoing interest to search for more bioactive secondary metabolites from the South China Sea soft corals. Recently, the soft coral S. nanolobata was collected off Ximao Island, Hainan Province, China, in May 2019. Our previous chemical study on the titled animal resulted in the isolation and characterization of a series of polyoxygenated diterpenoids [14]. Further chemical investigation of the acetone extract of the same sample led to the isolation and characterization of three previously undescribed cembrane-type diterpenoids (1\u20133) and a new casbane-type diterpenoid (4) (Figure 1). Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation, and cytotoxic activity of these newly isolated compounds.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6892. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196892 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules"

            "text": "The acetone extract of S. nanolobata was portioned between Et2O and H2O to afford the Et2O-soluble fraction, which was subjected to silica gel column chromatography to yield 12 subfractions. The subfractions were further purified using repeated silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and reversed-phase HPLC to afford compounds 1\u20137. The known compounds were rapidly characterized as grandilobatin D (5) [6], 11,12-epoxy-1E,3E,7E-cembratrien-15-ol (6) [15], and casbene (7) [16] by comparing the observed and reported spectroscopic data. Compound 1 was obtained as an optically active {[\u03b1]20D \u221213.5 (c 0.25, CHCl3)} colorless oil. Its molecular formula, C21H34O2, was determined using the HR-EIMS ion peak at m/z 318.2554 [M]+ (calcd. for C21H34O2, Figure S1g), implying 5 degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the presence of a carbonyl group (1708 cm\u22121, Figure S1h). The 1H NMR data (Table 1) of 1 displayed two vinyl methyls at \u03b4H 1.75 (3H, s) and 1.70 (3H, s), two tertiary methyls at \u03b4H 1.29 (3H, s) and 1.30 (3H, s), a bimodal methyl at \u03b4H 0.98 (3H, d, J = 6.9 Hz), an oxymethyl at \u03b4H 3.02 (3H, s), and three olefinic protons at \u03b4H 6.17 (1H, d, J = 10.7 Hz), 5.89 (1H, d, J = 10.7 Hz), and 5.24 (1H, m), respectively. The 13C NMR data together with DEPT and HSQC spectra indicated the presence of 21 carbon signals, which were classified as 6 methyls, 6 methylenes, 4 methines, and 5 quaternary carbons. The aforementioned data revealed that 1 was a cembrane-type diterpenoid and closely resembled that of co-occurring known compound, grandilobatin D (5) [6], with the only difference being the methoxyl group at C-15 in 1 instead of the C-15 hydroxyl group in 5, which is in agreement with the mass data. This replacement caused the 13C NMR resonance of C-15 to be shifted downfield from \u03b4C 73.9 to 78.2 in 1. The position of the methoxyl group at C-15 was further confirmed by the HMBC correlation from \u2212OMe (\u03b4H 3.02) to C-15 (\u03b4C 78.2) (Figure 2). The geometries of the double bonds at \u22061,2, \u22063,4, and \u22067,8 were both assigned to be E by the observed chemical shifts (<20 ppm) of the two vinyl methyls resonance at \u03b4C 17.4 (C-18) and \u03b4C 17.6 (C-19), along with the NOESY correlations of H-2 (\u03b4H 6.17)/Me-18 (\u03b4H 1.75), H-3 (\u03b4H 5.89)/H2-14 (\u03b4H 2.23 and 1.97), and H-7 (\u03b4H 5.24)/H2-9 (\u03b4H 3.03). The TDDFT-ECD calculation was carried out to deduce the absolute configuration of 1, which has been proven to be a reliable structure elucidation method for the determination of the absolute configuration of natural products. In detail, torsional sampling conformational searches using MMFFs (Merck Molecular Force Field) were carried out by means of the conformational search module in the Macromodel by applying an energy window of 21 kJ/mol, which afforded 145 conformers for (12S)-1. The Boltzmann populations of the conformers were obtained based on the potential energy provided by the MMFFs, which afforded five conformers for re-optimization. The re-optimization and the following TDDFT calculations of the re-optimized geometries were all performed using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level with IEFPCM (Polarizable Continuum Model using the Integral Equation Formalism variant) solvent model for acetonitrile. Frequency analysis was performed as well to confirm that the re-optimized geometries were at the energy minima. Finally, the SpecDis 1.62 software was used to obtain the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectra and visualize the results. Detailed comparison of the experimental ECD spectrum with those of calculated ones revealed that the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectrum of (12S)-\n1 displayed an identical curve compared to the experimental one (Figure 3). Consequently, the absolute configuration of 1 was determined as 12S.\n\u2212OMe 3.02, s 50.4, q 3.02, s 50.4, q a 1H NMR at 600 MHz, values are reported in ppm referenced to CHCl3 (\u03b4H 7.26). 13C NMR at 150 MHz, values are reported in ppm referenced to CDCl3 (\u03b4C 77.16). Assignments were aided by HSQC and HMBC experiments.\nCompound 2, which was isolated as a colorless oil, gave the molecular formula C21H34O2, the same as that of 1, on the basis of HR-EIMS ion peak at m/z 318.2558 [M]+ (calcd. for C21H34O2, 318.2553). The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 1) of 2 were virtually identical to those of the known co-isolated compound, 11,12-epoxy-1E,3E,7E-cembratrien15-ol (6), with the exception of a methoxyl group at C-15 in 2 instead of the C-15 hydroxyl group in 6. The planar structure of 2 was further elucidated via 1H\u20131H COSY and HMBC experiments (Figure 2). The E geometries of the double bonds \u22063,4 and \u22067,8 in 2 were determined using the chemical shifts (<20 ppm) of the C-18 (\u03b4C 18.3) and C-19 (\u03b4C 15.1) methyl groups, which were further confirmed by the NOESY cross-peaks of H-2 (\u03b4H 6.14)/Me-18 (\u03b4H 1.74), and H-7 (\u03b4H 5.29)/H2-9 (\u03b4H 2.26) (Figure 2). Moreover, the NOESY correlations of H-2/Me-16 (\u03b4H 1.30) and H-3 (\u03b4H 5.82)/H2-14 (\u03b4H 2.12 and 2.03) assigned the E geometry of the double bond \u22061,2. The relative configuration of C-11 and C-12 of 2 were suggested to be the same 11R*, 12R* as those of 6 due to the similar NMR data and the diagnostic NOESY relationships of H-11 (\u03b4H 2.90)/H-13\u03b2 (\u03b4H 1.33) and Me-20 (\u03b4H 1.25)/H-10\u03b2 (\u03b4H 1.45) (Figure 2). The absolute configuration of 2 was established by the application of the TDDFT-ECD calculation method. In this case, conformational search afforded 171 conformers for (11R, 12R)-2 and 5 conformers for re-optimization and the following TDDFT-ECD calculation. As shown in Figure 3, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectrum of (11R, 12R)-2 was matched to the experimental ECD spectrum of 2. Accordingly, the structure of 2 was elucidated as depicted in Figure 1. Compound 3 was also obtained as a colorless oil with the molecular formula of C21H34O2 on the basis of HR-EIMS ion peak at m/z 318.2566 [M]+ (calcd. for C21H34O2, 318.2553). Analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR data of 3 (Table 2) revealed similarities to 2, except for the location of the methoxyl group from the C-15 in 2 transferred to C-4 in 3, and accompanied by the isomerization of olefins from \u22061,2 and \u22063,4 to \u22061,15 and \u22062,3, respectively. These observations were supported by the HMBC correlations from the methyl protons Me-18 (\u03b4H 1.31) to C-3 (\u03b4C 130.5), C-4 (\u03b4C 77.3), and C-5 (\u03b4C 41.7); \u2212OMe (\u03b4H 3.07) to C-4 (\u03b4C 77.3); Me-16 (\u03b4H 1.81) to C-1 (\u03b4C 129.5) and C-15 (\u03b4C 131.7); and from the olefinic proton H-2 (\u03b4H 5.71) to C-15 (Figure 2). The large coupling constant (J2,3 = 16.3 Hz) and the 13C chemical shift of the methyl group Me-19 (\u03b4C 14.8) established the E geometries of the double bonds \u22062,3 and \u22067,8. Its relative configuration at C-11 and C-12 was proven to be the same 11R* and 12R* as those of 2 on the basis of the NOESY experiment (Figure 2). The whole relative configuration of the remaining chiral center C-4 and the distant stereochemical domain C-11/C-12 were defined using the QM-NMR calculation and DP4+ analysis [17,18]. These calculation methods utilize Bayes\u2019s theorem to estimate the probability of the selected candidate being correct. The common stages included the generation of plausible isomers and conformational search for each isomer in the gas phase using the MMFFs as applied in the Macromodel software Schrodinger2015-2. Finally, the NMR parameters on the two possible candidate isomers (Figure S5a, 3a: 4R*, 11R*, and 12R*; 3b: 4S*, 11R*, and 12R*) were calculated by the means of gauge including\natomic orbitals (GIAO) method at the mPW1PW91/6-31+G(d) level of theory following the DP4+ protocols. As a result, the experimentally observed NMR data of 3 gave the best match of over 99% to the 3b isomer (Figure S5b).\na 1H NMR at 600 MHz, values are reported in ppm referenced to CHCl3 (\u03b4H 7.26). 13C NMR at 150 MHz, values are reported in ppm referenced to CDCl3 (\u03b4C 77.16). Assignments were aided by HSQC and HMBC experiments.\nWith the relative configuration assigned, the following task was the determination of the absolute configuration of 3. Similarly, TDDFT-ECD calculation method was again applied in this case to determine the absolute configuration of 3. The conformational search of isomer (4S, 11R, 12R)-3 afforded 125 conformers and obtained 5 conformers with Boltzmann populations of more than 1% for the following re-optimization and TDDFT-ECD calculations. As shown in Figure 4, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectrum of (4S, 11R, and 12R)-3 highly matched the experimental ECD curve of 3. In light of these evidence, the structure of compound 3 was established as depicted in Figure 1. Compound 4 was isolated as a colorless oil, possessing the molecular formula of C20H30 by the HR-EIMS ion peak at m/z 270.2342 [M]+ (calcd. for C20H30, 270.2342), suggesting that 4 possessed 6 degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR data (Table 2) of 4 resembled those of the known co-isolated compound, casbene (7), with the exception of a conjugated terminal double bond in 4 instead of the vinyl methyl in 7. This replacement caused the presence of another three olefinic protons and the absence of a methyl signal in the 1H NMR of 4. The planar structure of 4 was further confirmed by the analysis of its 1H\u20131H COSY and HMBC correlations (Figure 2). The geometries of the double bonds \u22063,4 and \u22067,8 were assigned to be both E by the shielded carbon resonances of the two vinyl methyls at \u03b4C 15.8 (C-18) and 18.0 (C-19), along with the obvious NOESY correlations of Me-18 (\u03b4H 1.65)/H-2 (\u03b4H 1.32) and Me-19 (\u03b4H 1.64)/H2-6 (\u03b4H 2.16) (Figure 2).\nMoreover, the large coupling constants (J10,11 = 16.2 Hz) between H-10 and H-11 established the E geometry of the double bond \u220610,11. The 1,2-cis-configuration of C-1 and C-2 was determined by the NOE relationships of H-1/H-2/Me-16 (Figure 2) and the large \u2206\u03b4C value (13.1 ppm) between the gem-dimethyls C-16 (\u03b4C 29.2) and C-17 (\u03b4C 16.1). Moreover, the TDDFT-ECD calculation method was also applied to determine the absolute configuration of 4. As a result, the Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectrum of (1S, 2R)-4 highly matched to the experimental one, while the ECD profile of enantiomer (1R, 2S)-4 showed completely opposite curve (Figure 4). Consequently, the absolute configuration of 4 was determined to be 1S, 2R.\nIn the in vitro bioassay, cembrane-type diterpenoids have been well documented to display the growth inhibitory activities against various cancer cell lines [19]. Accordingly, the cytotoxic activities of all the isolated compounds 1\u20137 were evaluated in vitro against HEL (human erythroleukemia cells), H1975 (human lung adenocarcinoma cells), A549 (human non-small cell lung cancer cells), H1299 (human non-small cell lung cancer cells), and MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cells) by using the CCK8 and MTT methods. The dose-dependent assay was performed for the determination of IC50 values for the active compounds, and only compounds 1 and 5 exhibited medium cytotoxic activities against HEL cells with IC50 values of 37.09 and 42.37 \u00b5M, respectively, compared to that of the positive control doxorubicin (IC50 = 0.05 \u00b5M for HEL). In light of the above data, the primary structure\u2013activity relationships of 1\u20137 were summarized, and the moderate potency of 1, 5 and the inactivity of 2\u20134, 6, 7 suggested that the carbonyl group at C-10 seemed to have a significant impact on the cytotoxic activity against the tested cell lines. Furthermore, the structural comparison for the pair of 1 and 5 revealed that the substitutes at C-15 also contributed to the activity."

Structurally, all the new compounds 1\u20134 shared the same cembrane or casbane-type carbon skeleton with known analogues 5\u20137, and these molecules differed from each other mainly in different substituents or double bond positions, which suggested that they underwent a common biosynthesis pathway. In the bioassay, ketone carbonyl compounds 1 and 5 showed potential cytotoxic activities against HEL cells compared to that of inactive compounds, which provided a possible lead scaffold for further structural modifications to design novel anti-tumor drug. Further research should be conducted on the ecological roles of these bioactive secondary metabolites formed during the biosynthesis process of the soft coral."
