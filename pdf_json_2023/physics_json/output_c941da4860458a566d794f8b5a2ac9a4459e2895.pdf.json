    "abstractText": "Recently, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrometry has garnered considerable attention because it enables real-time and unpolluted detection of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and plays a crucial role in the early warning of emerging organic contaminants. However, the accuracy of detection is inevitably constrained by the co-absorption of organic pollutants and turbidity at UV wavelengths. To ensure accurate detection of COD, it is necessary to directly subtract the absorbance caused by turbidity from the overlaid spectrum using the principle of superposition. The absorbance of COD is confined to the UV range, whereas that of turbidity extends across the entire UV-vis spectrum. Therefore, based on its visible absorbance, the UV absorbance of turbidity can be predicted. In this way, the compensation for turbidity is achieved by subtracting the predicted absorbance from the overlaid spectrum. Herein, a straightforward yet robust exponential model was employed based on this principle to predict the corresponding absorbance of turbidity at UV wavelengths. The model was used to analyze the overlaid absorption spectra of synthetic water samples containing COD and turbidity. The partial least squares (PLS) method was employed to predict the COD concentrations in synthetic water samples based on the compensated spectra, and the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) values were recorded. The results indicated that the processed spectra yielded a considerably lower RMSE value (9.51) than the unprocessed spectra (29.9). Furthermore, the exponential model outperformed existing turbidity compensation models, including the Lambert-Beer law-based model (RMSE = 12.53) and multiplescattering cluster method (RMSE = 79.34). Several wastewater samples were also analyzed to evaluate the applicability of the exponential model to natural water. UV analysis yielded undesirable results owing to filtration procedures. However, the consistency between the compensated spectra and filtered wastewater samples in the visible range demonstrated that the model is applicable to natural water. Therefore, this proposed method is advantageous for improving the accuracy of COD measurement in turbid water.",

            "text": "With the rapid development of industries and explosive population growth, considerable amounts of emerging organic contaminants are being discharged into natural water bodies, causing severe environmental issues in the world today (Lapworth et\u00a0al., 2012; Pal et\u00a0al., 2014). Chemical oxygen demand (COD), which represents the level of organic pollutants in water, is a crucial indicator of the impact of emerging organic contaminants on water quality. Having reliable COD analysis methods is essential for effective water quality monitoring in wastewater treatment, a prerequisite for controlling water pollution. Currently, methods for measuring COD include the potassium permanganate method, the dichromate method, the flowinjection analysis method, the electrochemical analysis method, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy (Li et\u00a0 al., 2018). Among these methods, UV-vis spectroscopy is the most commonly used optical technique for assessing the COD concentration in water (Hu and Wang, 2017; Xu et\u00a0al., 2023). This approach indirectly measures the absorption of UV-vis light by organic matter to determine COD levels.\nUV-vis spectroscopy is widely utilized for COD measurement due to its rapid measurement time, lack of secondary pollution, reagentfree nature, and ability to provide real-time determination (Carr\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2017; Ma et\u00a0al., 2018). However, UV-vis spectroscopy is typically limited by the interference of suspended particles; thus, effective methods must be\u00a0adopted to suppress the influence of interfering factors and improve prediction accuracy (Wu et\u00a0al., 2017; Chen et\u00a0al., 2021). Turbidity compensation has become a research focus in the area of COD measurement based on UV-vis spectroscopy (Hu et\u00a0al., 2016; Li et\u00a0al., 2019; Hu et\u00a0al., 2020; Kang et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). Nevertheless, the turbidity compensation algorithm for COD measurement has not been extensively researched.\nPresently, there are primarily two categories of turbidity compensation methods (Li et\u00a0al., 2019). In one category, the COD value is corrected by using a model of the COD prediction error versus turbidity; however, such a model cannot completely eliminate the impact of turbidity, leading to poor versatility. In the second category, the absorption spectrum is determined by subtracting the absorbance caused by turbidity, requiring a complex model to calculate the turbidity absorbance. Apart from exhibiting large deviations, these complex models pose challenges for embedded programming and local calibration, rendering them unsuitable for online sensors. To address these limitations, the main objectives of this study were as follows: (1) develop an effective turbidity compensation method for COD measurement using UV-vis spectrometry, (2) investigate the applicability of embedded programming and local calibration as well as the possibility of online spectrometers to the model, (3) evaluate the accuracy of COD prediction in mixtures containing COD and turbidity, and (4) explore the feasibility of measuring COD in natural water using this model."

The operation and data collection of the spectrometer were controlled using an additional computer. The xenon lamp and spectrometer used in this study were compact enough to be\u00a0 enclosed within a cylinder, enabling the development of streamlined spectral probes. Ensuring that the optical system exhibits sufficient stability is crucial, because irregular factors can easily disrupt the absorption law of turbidity across the entire spectrum."

To establish a mathematical model for turbidity compensation, 15 formazine suspensions of 10\u2013200 FNU (formazine nephelometric units) were prepared. Further, a series of mixtures containing COD and turbidity were measured to validate the performance of the established model. Subsequently, 30 different mixtures with specific concentrations of COD and turbidity were prepared using a COD stock solution and formazine suspension. The COD stock solution was prepared by dissolving potassium hydrogen phthalate in water. All reagents were purchased from Maclin (China), and all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water (18.2 M\u03a9 cm at 25\u00b0C) obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q system.\nSeveral wastewater samples were also analyzed to assess the applicability of the model to natural water. The samples were collected at the inlet of an A/A/O municipal wastewater treatment system located in the Low Carbon Water Environmental Technology Center at Renmin University in China. The turbidity absorbance of wastewater was determined by calculating the difference spectra between filtered and unfiltered samples, with the filtration process utilizing 0.45 \u03bcm membranes (Haining Kewel Company, China). Finally, the feasibility of the model was assessed through a comparison of the compensated and measured spectra from the filtered water samples."

Absorption by the pure COD solution occurred predominantly within the UV range (180 ~ 320 nm) and increased with increasing turbidity concentration. This confirms that water turbidity poses a significant challenge to measuring COD using UV-vis spectrometry. Therefore, it is imperative to establish an efficient model for predicting the equivalent absorbance of turbidity at each UV wavelength to obtain the absorbance of COD alone by subtracting the overlapping spectrum. This method enables accurate detection of COD through the compensated ultraviolet spectrum.\nFIGURE\u00a01 Schematic illustration of spectral acquisition system.\nFIGURE\u00a02 The absorption spectra of 50 mg/L COD solutions mixed with varying turbidity concentrations (A); the absorption spectra of formazine suspensions at different concentrations (B); the logarithmic UV-vis spectra of formazine suspensions (C). The two vertical dashed lines indicate the linear range of the curves, which is between 5.4 < Ln (wavelength) <6.5 or 220 nm < wavelength < 660 nm.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nTo establish a model for predicting the equivalent absorbance of turbidity at different wavelengths, further investigation into its absorption behavior across the entire spectrum is required. For this purpose, we\u00a0measured the absorbance of formazine suspensions with varying concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 FNU and presented the resulting spectra in Figure\u00a02B. Turbidity exhibits absorbance over the entire spectrum owing to light scattering caused by suspended particles, with higher turbidity corresponding to stronger absorbance at each wavelength. For each absorption spectrum, the absorbance decreases rapidly initially and then gradually with longer wavelengths. Several studies have reported an exponential increase in particle absorbance at shorter wavelengths, which is visually consistent with the absorption spectra of formazine suspensions (Langergraber et\u00a0al., 2003; Berho et\u00a0al., 2004). We\u00a0hypothesized that an exponential model\ncould be\u00a0 utilized to predict the absorbance of turbidity at each wavelength, enabling effective turbidity compensation.\nBased on the aforementioned hypothesis, the logarithmic UV-vis spectra of the formazine suspensions were transformed to linear form, as illustrated in Figure\u00a0 2C. It is noteworthy that the logarithmic spectra exhibit a visually linear trend within the range of 220 to 660 nm (5.4 < Ln (wavelength) < 6.5). The logarithmic spectra were subjected to linear regression analysis, with the resulting data presented in Table\u00a01. The high values of R2 (>0.98) indicate a strong linear correlation between the variables under investigation. However, there are nonlinear regions within the logarithmic spectra, particularly at shorter and longer wavelengths. The nonlinearity observed at shorter wavelengths (<220 nm) may be\u00a0attributed to the presence of co-absorptive substances, such as organic compounds and nitrates. As absorbances at longer wavelengths (>660 nm) are relatively small, they are susceptible to random noise interference, causing nonlinearity. In summary, the relationship between turbidity absorbance and wavelength can be\u00a0expressed by Eq. (1) below:\nLn A k Ln bTur( ) = \u22c5 ( ) +\u03bb (1)\nThe absorbance of turbidity at wavelength \u03bb is denoted by ATur, and k and b represent the slope and intercept of the logarithmic spectra, respectively. However, the linearity of Equation (1) may be\u00a0affected by the stability of the experimental system, with an unstable system often resulting in a downward trend in the logarithmic spectra. The instability of the system is primarily attributed to the impact of the spectrometer and xenon lamp. Specifically, the highly sensitive chargecoupled device detector in the spectrometer is susceptible to noise, ambient light, and dark-current interference. In contrast, the spectrometer utilized in this study was equipped with a less sensitive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor detector (e.g., UV20, Horiba), which tends to be\u00a0less susceptible to these impact factors. Additionally, the light intensity of the xenon lamp must be\u00a0sufficiently strong to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio in the system.\nTable\u00a01 clearly shows that parameter b gradually increases with increasing turbidity, while parameter k remains relatively constant. Furthermore, an investigation into the relationship between parameter b and turbidity was conducted, as depicted in Figure\u00a03. To simplify the local calibration, a polynomial function was utilized to fit the curve with an R2 value of 0.995. A quadratic relationship between parameter b and turbidity was demonstrated, allowing for the determination of parameter b as a function of turbidity based on Eq. (2) as follows:\nb m T n Tur p= \u22c5 + \u22c5 +ur 2\n(2)\nThe quadratic function is represented by the coefficients m, n, and p, while Tur denotes the turbidity concentration. Substituting Eq.

The latter can be\u00a0transformed into a COD concentration by utilizing multivariate analysis tools. Measuring the turbidity prior to measuring COD is recommended because COD absorbance occurs in the UV range rather than in the visible range of the spectrum (Figure\u00a0 2A). Turbidity can be\u00a0 measured by utilizing the absorbance at visible wavelengths, such as the wavelength band of 500 to 750 nm (Fleischmann et\u00a0 al., 2002). As depicted in Figure\u00a0 2B, a proportional relationship exists between turbidity and the absorbance of visible wavelengths; thus, multivariate analysis tools (e.g., partial least squares method; PLS) can also be\u00a0employed for turbidity measurement."

Chemical oxygen demand prediction by exponential model and its comparison with the Lambert-Beer law and multiple-scattering cluster method\nTo verify the compensation performance of the exponential model, a series of mixtures containing COD and turbidity were measured, and the corresponding raw spectra are presented in Figure\u00a04A. Subsequently, these raw spectra underwent processing using Eq. (4), resulting in compensated absorption spectra, as shown in Figure\u00a04B. Other turbidity compensation models, such as the Lambert-Beer law-based (LBL) and multiple-scattering cluster (MSC) models mentioned in the literature, were also examined for comparison with the exponential model presented here (Wu et\u00a0al., 2017; Li et\u00a0al., 2019; Chen et\u00a0al., 2021). The compensated spectra from the LBL and MSC models are shown in Figures\u00a04C,D, respectively. The compensated spectra of MSC exhibit distinct deviations from those of the exponential and LBL models. Specifically, after compensation by the MSC model, the absorbance of water samples at visible wavelengths remains nonzero, whereas it approaches zero in the compensated spectra of the LBL and exponential models. This discrepancy can be\u00a0attributed to turbidity in the water samples, which the MSC model cannot effectively eliminate. Moreover, the majority of the UV spectra tend to cluster together in the MSC model, which disrupts the proportional relationship between UV absorption and COD concentration, leading to decreasing COD measurement accuracy. In contrast, the LBL and exponential models provide highly dispersed UV spectra that enable more accurate predictions of COD.\nThe PLS method has been demonstrated to provide the most robust multivariate calibrations for addressing concentration-spectra relationships. As such, it is employed herein to retrieve the COD concentration based on the compensated absorption spectra (Wold et\u00a0al., 2001; Lepot et\u00a0al., 2016; Li et\u00a0al., 2020). Figure\u00a05A displays the predictions of the PLS models based on four types of compensated spectra, with their corresponding R2 and RMSE values listed in Table\u00a02. The results obtained from the LBL and exponential models are generally consistent with the actual COD values, exhibiting small\nRMSE values. In contrast, the MSC predictions deviate greatly from the actual values, resulting in larger RMSE values. Therefore, the MSC model is comparatively less effective in compensating for turbidity than the exponential and LBL models.\nAlthough the accuracy of the COD prediction in turbid water was significantly enhanced by the LBL and exponential models, a lower RMSE value was achieved only with the exponential model. This outcome may be\u00a0attributed to the LBL model employing LambertBeer\u2019s law to simulate the turbidity absorbance at each wavelength. It is well known that the Lambert-Beer law establishes a linear correlation between absorbance and solute concentration. However, this linearity is only observed at low concentrations at which the absorbance of the solute remains below a certain threshold. As previously stated, the absorbance of the turbidity increases exponentially as the wavelength decreases. Therefore, the relationship between absorbance and turbidity becomes less linear at shorter wavelengths, as shown in Figure\u00a05B. Owing to this nonlinearity in the UV region, the LBL method performs worse in the UV than in the visible region. In contrast, the turbidity absorption conforms almost entirely to the exponential law across the entire spectrum. Therefore, the performance of the exponential model is consistent from the UV to the visible regions. As UV absorption provides more informative data for COD prediction, the RMSE value obtained by the exponential model was lower than that obtained with the LBL model."

            "text": "Turbidity in natural water is caused by the presence of numerous particles of varying properties, resulting in multiple scattering (Huber and Frost, 1998). To assess the applicability of the exponential model in natural water, several wastewater samples were also analyzed. The turbidity absorption in wastewater can be\u00a0determined by calculating the difference spectra between filtered and unfiltered samples, as illustrated in plots (A) and (B) of Figure\u00a06. Subsequently, the logarithmic spectra of turbidity can be\u00a0obtained, as shown in Figure\u00a06C. Here, the logarithmic spectra exhibit a visually linear and uniform trend at ln(wavelength) >5.8 (wavelength > 320 nm). An exponential model can be\u00a0established based on the linear portions of the spectra to predict the equivalent absorbance of turbidity at each wavelength. The elimination of cross-sensitivity in the UV range is achieved by subtracting the equivalent absorbance. By comparing Figures\u00a02C, 6C, it is evident that the logarithmic spectra slopes of formazine suspensions exhibits a significantly greater magnitude than that of turbidity in wastewater. The disparity in particle size between the formazine suspension and wastewater turbidity is the primary cause of this phenomenon. Several studies have indicated that particulates with smaller diameters tend to exhibit a steep absorption spectrum, whereas those with larger diameters typically display a more gradual absorption spectrum (Huber and Frost, 1998; Berho et\u00a0al., 2004). Therefore, the smaller particle size of formazine particles results in a steeper logarithmic spectrum compared to wastewater turbidity.\nArtificial filtration can also eliminate the cross-sensitivity of turbidity, allowing for a visual evaluation of the performance of the exponential model through comparison with filtered samples, as shown in\nFigure\u00a0 6D. The compensated spectra are highly consistent with the filtered spectra within the wavelength band of 320 ~ 720 nm. However, the compensated spectra exhibit higher values than the filtered spectra at the 200 ~ 320 nm range, potentially resulting in positive deviations during the COD measurements.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE\u00a04 The raw UV-vis spectra of 30 mixtures containing COD and turbidity are presented (A).

Therefore, it can be\u00a0concluded that the deviation observed within the UV range is not due to any shortcomings inherent within the exponential model. In achieving a high level of consistency between the compensated spectra and the filtered spectra in the visible range, the exponential model demonstrates that it remains applicable for simulating turbidity absorption behavior in natural water. The validation results indicate that the proposed exponential model is superior to the LBL and MSC methods for compensating turbidity, rendering it suitable for use in online spectrometers to enhance COD measurement accuracy in turbid water. The light scattering caused by particles in water is influenced by various factors, such as the concentration, diameter, and refractive index of the particle, as well as the measuring angle and wavelength of incident light (Huber and Frost, 1998). It is important to acknowledge that these factors may also impact the turbidity compensation model, thus necessitating recalibration of the model in response to changes in application conditions."
