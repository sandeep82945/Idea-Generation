 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab as a treatment for palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), since the paper suggests it may be beneficial.

2. Investigate the role of α4β7 integrin and its ligands like MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the pathogenesis of PPP to better understand the mechanism of action of vedolizumab. 

3. Explore whether other medications that target α4β7 integrin, besides vedolizumab, could also be effective treatments for PPP.

4. Study if improving the intestinal environment, through approaches like probiotics or dietary changes, can help treat PPP, since the paper proposes this as an indirect mechanism for vedolizumab.

5. Examine skin biopsies from PPP patients to evaluate if endothelial expression of VCAM-1 correlates with disease severity and treatment response. This could further elucidate the potential direct action of vedolizumab on skin lesions.
