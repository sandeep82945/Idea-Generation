    "abstractText": "We compare high-order methods including spectral difference (SD), flux reconstruction (FR), the entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (ES-DGSEM), modal discontinuous Galerkin methods, and WENO to select the best candidate to simulate strong shock waves characteristic of hypersonic flows. We consider several benchmarks, including the Leblanc and modified shock-density wave interaction problems that require robust stabilization and positivity-preserving properties for a successful flow realization. We also perform simulations of the three-species Sod problem with simplified chemistry with the chemical reaction source terms introduced in the Euler equations. The ES-DGSEM scheme exhibits the highest stability, negligible numerical oscillations, and requires the least computational effort in resolving reactive flow regimes with strong shock waves. Therefore, we extend the ES-DGSEM to hypersonic Euler equations by deriving a new set of two-point entropy conservative fluxes for a five-species gas model. Stabilization for capturing strong shock waves occurs by blending high-order entropy conservative fluxes with low-order finite volume fluxes constructed using the HLLC Riemann solver. The hypersonic Euler solver is verified using the non-equilibrium chemistry Sod problem. To this end, we adopt the Mutation++ library to compute the reaction source terms, thermodynamic properties, and transport coefficients. We also investigate the effect of real chemistry versus ideal chemistry, and the results demonstrate that the ideal chemistry assumption fails at high temperatures, hence real chemistry must be employed for accurate predictions. Finally, we consider a viscous hypersonic flow problem to verify the transport coefficients and reaction source terms determined by the Mutation++ library.",

For example, the aerodynamic forces that act on a space capsule during re-entry directly affect the design of the navigation and control surfaces of the capsule. Calculating the thermal loads leads to the design of safe heat shield tiles with optimal thickness for the hypersonic regimes. Hypersonic flow simulations require a robust, accurate, and scalable numerical method to capture multiscale and chemically reactive compressible flows. The numerical method must resolve strong bow shocks with extreme pressure and temperature ratios, which trigger chemical reactions such as air dissociation and recombination. The chemical reactions progress with a finite rate, which violates the frozen chemical composition assumption and chemical equilibrium with infinite rate chemistry. Moreover,\n\u2217Corresponding author.E-mail address: george_karniadakis@brown.edu\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n12 63\n5v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nthe turbulent boundary layer behind strong bow shocks must be resolved for a vast range of wavenumbers to precisely predict the surface forces and heat loads. A candidate numerical method is the high-order discontinuous spectral element methods (DSEM) that exhibits low numerical dissipation and dispersion errors [1] at high wavenumbers, which adds accuracy in predicting the turbulent boundary layer of hypersonic vehicles. These discontinuous high-order methods can be discretized onto local elements providing a framework suitable for parallel computations. However, DSEM lacks robustness when resolving strong shock waves with extreme pressure ratios.\nThe majority of the existing numerical approaches for solving hypersonic flows consists of low-order finite volume methods with various Euler flux formulations [2, 3]. Low-order finite volume methods exhibit a high degree of robustness. However, due to excessive numerical errors, especially in long-time simulations, they encounter numerical issues such as bow shock carbuncle [4, 5, 6] and the erroneous prediction of surface heating in hypersonic flows [5]. Predicting the surface heat fluxes is essential since it directly determines heat shield design for hypersonic re-entry. Finite volume methods are also dependent on the type of mesh elements and grid orientation [7]. Non-aligned grids with strong bow shocks induce numerical errors, leading to the incorrect prediction of surface heating [7, 8]. Grid alignment issue can be alleviated by adapting grid lines to the bow shock shape [9, 10]; however, detecting the location of the bow shock creates implementation issues for complex geometries. Finite volume methods also fail to resolve the turbulent boundary layer accurately at high speeds.\nHigh-order methods may potentially overcome the deficiencies of low-order methods in simulating hypersonic flows. Marxen et al. [11] showed that a high-order finite difference scheme could successfully resolve a reactive turbulent boundary layer in equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions for Mach number 10. Passiatore et al. [12] simulated the effect of finite rate chemistry in turbulent hypersonic boundary layers using a 10th order finite difference scheme with localized artificial diffusion method added for numerical stability. Although the high-order finite difference scheme obtains promising results for the hypersonic boundary layer, it cannot be directly applied to deformed elements required in complex-geometry flows. Discontinuous spectral element methods provide the geometric flexibility of finite volume as well as high-order accuracy [13]. Ching et al. [8] developed a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for high Mach number flows. They showed that their DG method could resolve bow shocks without carbuncles and without a shock-aligned mesh. However, they did not employ real chemistry effects and assumed frozen properties for the flow.\nA high-order scheme must be able to resolve non-equilibrium chemical reactions, strong shock waves, and near-vacuum conditions that are specific to hypersonic flows. Zhang and Shu [14] first introduced a high-order DG scheme that preserves the positivity of density and pressure near vacuum conditions for Euler equations. The DG scheme can simulate high-pressure ratio shock waves using a combination of total variation bounded (TVB) [15] method and a positivity preserving scheme that maintains high-order accuracy. They later extended the positivity preserving scheme to Euler equations with reaction source terms [16]. However, their method failed to correctly predict the three species high-pressure ratio Sod problem with reaction source terms. Zhang and Shu [17] also developed a positivity preserving scheme for a fifth-order finite difference WENO scheme and successfully solved the three species Sod problem with reaction source terms.\nFor collocation discontinuous spectral element methods such as discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM), spectral difference (SD), and flux reconstruction (FR) approaches, a nonlinear modal filter can be employed to preserve the high accuracy, conservation, positivity of pressure and density, and entropy stability [18]. The optimal modal filter strength is selected to satisfy the entropy stability and positivity of pressure and density for all the solution points using a bisection root-finding method. The adaptive modal filtering method is yet to be evaluated on multiple species reactive Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Another viable stabilizing technique for high-pressure ratio shock waves includes entropy-stable high order DGSEM schemes for which entropy stability is recovered at the discrete level [19]. Constructing entropy stable DG approaches requires the derivation of the entropy conservative fluxes [20, 21]. The entropy conservative fluxes have been derived for multi-component gas mixtures [22] when the specific heat coefficients are constant or a polynomial function of the temperature. However, entropy conservative fluxes have yet to be derived for hypersonic flows, where the internal energy consists of the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. In the current study, we develop a new set of entropy-conservative fluxes that conserve entropy for hypersonic flows.\nAir is a gas mixture consisting of atomic and diatomic species. At high speeds, bow shocks generate hot gas regions behind the shocks that excite the vibrational and electronic modes of the gas mixture. At high temperatures, the thermodynamic and transport properties of the gas mixture are temperature-dependent. Moreover, when the temperature exceeds a certain limit, the dissociation and recombination reaction rates begin to increase, the composition of the gas mixture changes, and the frozen gas mixture assumption fails. The gas mixture can be assumed in local equilibrium when the advection characteristic time is much larger than the reaction time scale. For hypersonic flows, the advection time scale is comparable to the reaction time scale due to high velocities. A small advection time scale must be modeled with non-equilibrium chemistry. At even higher velocities, ionization of the gas mixture begins generating species with electric charges such as electrons and ions. The air has been modeled as three- [23], five- [11], and eleven-species [24]\ngas mixtures. In this work, the five-species model of Park [25] is employed for finite rate chemistry and non-equilibrium thermodynamic calculations.\nIn this current study we aim to develop a high-order robust numerical framework for simulating hypersonic flows modeled with real chemistry. The high-order framework is constructed based on the DGSEM approach stabilized using a flux blending technique [19]. The blending is constructed such that the high accuracy of the DGSEM scheme is preserved for the smooth regions, and the conservation property remains intact. The DGSEM scheme is reformulated as a flux differencing expression, where the two points entropy conservative (EC) fluxes can be employed. The novel elements of this work include:\n\u2022 Comparing existing state-of-the-art discontinuous spectral element methods for resolving extreme pressure ratio shock waves in near vacuum conditions.\n\u2022 Constructing an entropy-stable high order scheme for the hypersonic Euler equations. \u2022 Deriving entropy-conservative fluxes for the formulation of hypersonic flows modeled using the Rigid-Rotor\nHarmonic-Oscillator (RRHO) method [26]. \u2022 Deriving a new technique to approximate an averaging term in the formulation of the two-point entropy-\nconservative (EC) fluxes when the left and right states approach the same values. \u2022 Quantifying the effect of modeling real chemistry in hypersonic flows versus ideal chemistry. \u2022 Constructing a hypersonic Navier-Stokes solver based on the entropy-stable Euler scheme and the Bassi and\nRebay (BR1) approach [27] for discretizing the viscous terms. \u2022 Validating the Mutation++ library for calculating the species source term, thermodynamic properties, and\ntransport coefficients.\nUsing the blending technique and the newly derived EC fluxes, we construct an entropy-stable DGSEM (ES-DGSEM) scheme for the hypersonic Euler equations. The ES-DGSEM scheme is first evaluated and compared with other high-order spectral element methods for the single-species compressible Euler equations initialized with the Leblanc test problem. Each approach is then employed to simulate a modified shock-density wave interaction problem with a high-pressure ratio. The shock-density wave interaction problem assesses the high-order scheme in handling shock turbulence interactions. Subsequently, the three-species Sod problem with simple chemistry is used to compare the positivity-preserving and shock-capturing abilities of available high-order methods for solving the multi-species Euler equations with reaction source terms. Next, the new EC fluxes\u2019 global and local entropy conservation is verified by solving a periodic smooth initial condition test case. This is followed by the calculation of reaction source terms and thermodynamic properties, which are validated by solving a hypersonic Sod problem with real chemistry. The effect of real versus ideal chemistry models is investigated by employing a hypersonic Sod problem. The last benchmark problem is the simulation of chemically reactive Navier-Stokes equations behind the hypersonic shock wave to validate the transport properties of the dissociating gas model. We conclude by summarizing the most important findings of our work."

DGSEM is the main numerical method that we extend to hypersonic flows. Here, we describe the numerical framework and the stabilizing technique used for the numerical simulation of high-pressure ratio shock waves. We consider the governing equation of the I th conservative variable in Eq. (1) as\n\u2202U I \u2202t + \u2202F I(U,Wx) \u2202x = SI , x \u2208 \u2126 (34)\nwhere U I = U I(x, t) is the I th conservative variable solution, F I(U,Wx) is the flux and SI is the source term for the corresponding I th conservative variable. The vector of primitive variables is also defined as W = (\u03c11, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c1Ns , u, T )T . We divide the physical domain, \u2126, into N non-overlapping and geometrically conforming elements defined as \u2126 \u2248 \u2126k = {x|xk < x < xk+1} for k = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N . The global solution is approximated as a direct sum of the local piecewise polynomial solution and expressed as\nU I(x, t) \u2248 UeD,I(x, t) = N\u2295 k=1 UeD,Ik (x, t), (35)\nwhereas the flux function is estimated by a union of continuous elemental functions as\nF I(x, t) \u2248 F e,I(x, t) = N\u2295 k=1 F e,Ik (x, t). (36)\nIn Eqs. (35) and (36), the superscript e refers to the approximate solution or flux inside the kth element. From now on, we omit the superscripts e and D for brevity. An affine mapping is used to map 1D elements onto a reference elements [\u22121, 1] with reference coordinate \u03b7 to perform the numerical integration over the element. The mapping function is x(\u03b7) = 0.5(1\u2212 \u03b7)xk + 0.5(1 + \u03b7)xk+1. Equation (34) is recast into the reference element as follows\n\u2202U\u0303 Ik \u2202t + 1 |J | \u2202F\u0303 Ik \u2202\u03b7 = S\u0303Ik , (37)\nwhere |J | is local transformation Jacobian and defined as |J | = x\u03b7 and the variables U\u0303 Ik and F\u0303 Ik denotes the respective quantity in the mapped space. To recover the weak form of (37), we multiply Eq. (37) with a Lagrange polynomial test\nfunction constructed based on Lobatto Gauss Legendre (LGL) points. These Lagrange polynomials are defined in the interval \u03b7 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] as\nli(\u03b7) = P\u220f m=0,m 6=i \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7m \u03b7i \u2212 \u03b7m .

(42)\nThe boundary matrix is also defined as\nB = diag([\u22121, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0, 1]). (43) The superscript \u2217 indicates the interface numerical flux calculated for advective and viscous fluxes at the element\u2019s boundaries. The mass and differentiation matrices satisfy the following property\nMD + (MD)T = B, (44) which is referenced to as the summation by parts (SBP) property [31]. Using the SBP property, we can derive the equivalent strong form of the DGSEM scheme from (42) as\nd~U Ik dt = \u2212 1 |J |\n( M\u22121B ( ~F \u2217Ik \u2212 ~F Ik ) \u2212D~F Ik ) + ~SIk .

(46)\nIn Eq. (45), ~F \u2217Ik = ( F \u2217Il,k , 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0, F \u2217Ir,k )T consists of left and right boundaries fluxes. We will also decompose the flux function vectors into advective and diffusive parts such that ~F \u2217Ik = ~F \u2217I,a k + ~F \u2217I,vk and ~F I k = ~F I,ak + ~F I,vk ."

            "heading": "2.3.1 Advective fluxes",
            "text": "The advective interface fluxes are determined by constructing a Riemann problem from the two different states of the solution vectors at the left and right-hand sides of the interface. The Riemann problem is then solved using an approximate Riemann solver such as HLLC [32] to determine the common interface flux. Therefore, the interface fluxes are calculated as\nF \u2217I,al,k = F HLLC(Uk\u22121,P ,Uk,0), F \u2217I,a r,k = F HLLC(Uk,P ,Uk+1,0). (47) For the advective volume fluxes, Fisher et al. [33] and Carpenter et al. [34] proved that the derivative operator with the diagonal SBP property can be reformulated into a sub-cell based finite volume scheme as\nP\u2211 n=0 DinF I,a k,n = F\u0304 I,ak,i+1 \u2212 F\u0304 I,a k,i \u03c9i , i = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,P, and k = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N. (48)\nThe flux differencing from Eq. (48) proves the conservation of the derivative operator. Fisher et al. [33] and Carpenter et al. [34] showed that the volume flux differencing relation (48) can be written in terms of two-point entropy conserving flux functions F \u2217\u2217IEC = F \u2217\u2217I EC (Uk,i,Uk,j) as\nF\u0304 I,ak,i+1 \u2212 F\u0304 I,a k,i\n\u03c9i = 2 P\u2211 n=0 DinF \u2217\u2217I k,EC(Uk,i,Uk,n). (49)\nFisher et al. [33] and Carpenter et al. [34] then showed that the two-point entropy conservative flux results in a high-order accurate discretization. Gassner et al. [20] later concluded that the high order accuracy resulted from the symmetry and consistency of the two-point flux function and not from the entropy conservation. Therefore, they rewrote Eq. (49) such that\nF\u0304 I,ak,i+1 \u2212 F\u0304 I,a k,i\n\u03c9i = 2 P\u2211 n=0 DinF \u2217\u2217I k (Uk,i,Uk,n), (50)\nwhere the two-point flux function F \u2217\u2217Ik satisfies consistency and symmetry conditions as\nF \u2217\u2217Ik (Uk,i,Uk,i) = F I k (Uk,i) and F \u2217\u2217I k (Uk,i,Uk,j) = F \u2217\u2217I k (Uk,j ,Uk,i). (51)\nTwo-point entropy conservative fluxes can be determined using the semi-discrete setting of Tadmor [35, 36]. We derive new entropy conservative fluxes [37] for the hypersonic equations in Section 3. Here, we can also employ the split form fluxes presented in the literature such as standard DG [38], Morinishi [39], Ducros et al. [40], Kennedy and Gruber [41], and Pirozzoli [42]. Gassner et al. [20] presents the two-point flux formulations of all the split forms. This strategy avoids the tedious calculations of the entropy conservative fluxes for the hypersonic formulations. It also provides a flux differencing framework that can be exploited for constructing a conservative hybrid discretization for shock capturing.\nUsing Eq. (48), the semi-discrete form of DGSEM (52) is expressed as\nd~U Ik dt = \u2212 1 |J |\n( M\u22121B ( ~F \u2217I,ak \u2212 ~F I,a k ) \u2212M\u22121\u2206 ~\u0304F I,ak ) \u2212 1 |J | ( M\u22121B ( ~F \u2217I,vk \u2212 ~F I,v k ) \u2212D~F I,vk ) + ~SIk , (52)\nwith\n\u2206 =  \u22121 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u22121 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 ... . . . . . . . . . . . . ...\n0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 \u22121 1 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 \u22121 1\n \u2208 R(P+1)\u00d7(P+2), (53)\nand the high-order flux vectors ~\u0304F I,ak are defined as\nF\u0304 I,ak,0 = F I,a k,0 , F\u0304 I,a k,j = P\u2211 m=j j\u22121\u2211 n=0 2HnmF \u2217\u2217,I k,(n,m) j = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,P, F\u0304 I,a k,P+1 = F I,a k,P , (54)\nwhere H := MD. We can now blend the high-order flux ~\u0304F I,ak with a first-order finite volume flux constructed on the interfaces of sub-cells. The sizes of those finite volume sub-cells are given by the quadrature weights of each LGL point [19]. In the sub-cells, the solution values on the LGL points are taken to be the sub-cell solution averages [19]. To stabilize the high-order scheme, we blend the high-order flux function with the low-order finite volume one. Using a combination of the high and low order fluxes, we rewrite Eq. (52) as\nd~U Ik dt = \u2212 1 |J |\n( M\u22121B ( ~F \u2217I,ak \u2212 ~F I,a k ) \u2212M\u22121\u2206 ( (1\u2212 \u03b1) ~\u0304F I,ak + \u03b1~F I,FV k )) \u2212 1 |J | ( M\u22121B ( ~F \u2217I,vk \u2212 ~F I,v k ) \u2212D~F I,vk ) +~SIk\n(55)\nwith \u03b1 as the blending coefficient defined as \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03b1max]. The blending coefficient \u03b1 is constant over each element. The limit \u03b1max is a user-defined value that satisfies \u03b1max \u2264 1. The value of \u03b1 is determined based on the decay rate of the energy stored at high modes on each element [19]. The finite volume flux vector is expressed as\n~F I,FVk =  0 F\u0303 \u2217I,ak (Uk,0,Uk,1) ...\nF\u0303 \u2217I,ak (Uk,P\u22121,Uk,P) 0  \u2208 RP+2 (56) where the \u2217 superscript denotes the Riemann flux calculated from the two solution states at an interface. When \u03b1 = 1, the discretization reduces to a finite volume scheme, and when \u03b1 = 0, the discretization reverts to the high-order DGSEM scheme. The blending technique is identical to the work of Hennemann et al. [19]."

The jump and average operators are expressed as\n[[a]] = a+ \u2212 a\u2212, {{a}} = 1 2 (a+ + a\u2212). (69)\nWe now need to define the jump conditions for entropy variables and for the potential function \u03c8 (68).

(77)\nEquation (77) must be implemented such that when a+ \u2192 a\u2212, the logarithmic average approaches a finite value. Ismail and Roe derive an accurate approximation [43] to determine the average value of Eq. (77) when the right and left states are close to each other. We need to derive the jump of the following logarithmic term[[\nln ( e\u03b8ka \u2212 1 )]] =\n[[a]]\n{{a}}ln,exp,k .

(81)\nAs a result, the new logarithmic average is derived as\n{{a}}ln,exp,k = {{e\u03b8ka \u2212 1}}ln{{a}}exp,k.

The initial conditions are defined as\n(\u03c1, u, p) =\n{( 2, 0, 109 ) x \u2264 0.0\n(0.001, 0, 1) x > 0.0, (92)\nwhere the pressure ratio is 109 and the density ratio is 105. The spatial domain is defined as x \u2208 [\u221210, 10] and the final time of the simulation is tfinal = 0.0001. The extreme high-pressure ratio in this test case is specific to the hypersonic flows where strong shock waves occur in near-vacuum conditions. For this test case, we solve the 1D Euler system of equations for a single species gas mixture with a constant \u03b3 = 1.4.\nFigures 1(a)-(c) present the density, velocity, and pressure profiles of the Leblanc Sod problem at t = 0.0001. All the test cases employ 1000 spectral elements with polynomial order P = 3. The time step size of all the simulations is fixed at \u2206t = 2.0893\u00d7 10\u22128. The maximum allowable value for the blending coefficient is \u03b1max = 0.5 for the ES-DGSEM scheme. The EC flux of Chandrashekar [47] is employed for the single species gas model in the ES-DGSEM scheme. According to Figure 1(a), the ES-DGSEM scheme smears the contact discontinuity more than the FR and SD schemes since it detects shocks over an element. However, for the FR and SD schemes, the shock can be located between two solution points; therefore, the discontinuities are captured sharper than in the ES-DGSEM scheme. Figure 1(b) reveals that the FR and SD approaches generate a higher amplitude of numerical oscillations close to the shock fronts compared to the ES-DGSEM scheme. Among the three schemes, the SD solver generates larger oscillations and undershoots at contact wave and shock front in density and pressure profiles. The discontinuous flux function in the SD scheme is constructed using P + 1 polynomial order, compared to P order polynomial in the FR and ES-DGSEM schemes. A higher polynomial degree can induce a higher amplitude of oscillations when evaluated at the boundaries of elements.\nA robust shock-capturing technique is required to resolve strong shock waves where stabilization can be achieved by filtering the solution down to mean modes [18]. Adaptive modal filtering can lower the order of accuracy to one by zeroing out all the other modes except the mean mode. Therefore, for stability, the numerical scheme must ensure that the mean solution always stays within the physical bounds given a bounded solution value on all the solution points at the previous time step. All three high-order schemes maintain the physical bounds of the mean solution. According to our experience, employing artificial viscosity cannot stabilize the high-order spectral method for high-pressure ratios shock waves. The ES-DGSEM scheme performs robustly and generates the most negligible numerical oscillations in capturing large pressure ratio shock waves. At the same time, it slightly smears the sharp solution jumps compared to the FR and SD schemes."

A high-resolution case with N = 3000 elements and P = 3 is simulated using the DGSEM Euler solver to be considered an exact solution for comparison. All the simulation cases are performed with N = 170 elements and P = 3.

The FR, SD, and ES-DGSEM results compare the accuracy of capturing high-frequency features that could appear in shock-turbulence interaction scenarios. The stabilization scheme for shock capturing is adaptive modal filtering for FR and SD schemes and high and low order blending technique for the ES-DGSEM. According to Fig. 2(a), all the schemes can successfully resolve all the discontinuous and continuous parts of the solution with slight differences. Looking at Fig. 2(b), the SD and FR schemes fail to capture the dip at x = 2.82 correctly, and the FR method misses to predict the valley at x = 3.265 while the ES-DGSEM successfully resolves all the features of the solution. The adaptive filter maintains the numerical entropy at all the solution and flux points above a threshold, which is the minimum numerical entropy within the Voronoi elements\n(neighboring elements) at the previous Runge Kutta sub-step. This assumption may not correctly operate when there are high-frequency regions besides the shock or contact waves in the domain, where the adaptive filter can be switched on due to the high gradient smooth regions and smear some features of the solution. The selected numerical threshold for entropy = 10\u22124 must be modified to avoid excessive filtering at high-gradient smooth regions. Therefore, the adaptive modal filter must be tuned according to the problem. However, for the ES-DGSEM scheme the shock capturing is not problem dependent and the tuning parameter is usually kept at 0.5. The shock wave captured by the SD and FR schemes is sharper than the DGSEM scheme while introducing overshoots and undershoots. The SD undershoots and overshoots are the largest among the three schemes."

The physical domain is defined as x \u2208 [0, 1]. Periodic boundary conditions are assigned at x = 0 and x = 1. Since entropy conservative fluxes are employed for the interior flux points and at the elements\u2019 interfaces, the global entropy rate should remain at machine zero over time.\nThe global entropy rate is determined by multiplying the Eq. (52) without the source and diffusive fluxes into the discrete entropy variables inside each element and calculating the entropy rate of each element using the quadrature rules. We then sum the entropy rate of each element over the entire physical domain to calculate the global entropy rate. The global entropy rate is determined for each time step until t = 0.1, and the rate of entropy change in time is plotted in Fig. 4. The initial and final time profiles are also plotted for three variables in Fig. 5. According to Fig. 4, the rate of entropy change remains within the 10\u22125 order of magnitude over time. The value of the global entropy rate is not machine zero; however, it is close to the numerical tolerance defined for inverting the internal energy to the temperature in the Mutation++ library. For calculating the temperature from the internal energy value, the Mutaion++ library uses an iterative loop that uses Newton-Rophson\u2019s method to determine temperature until the residual becomes less than a specific numerical tolerance. In the Mutation++ library, this tolerance is in the order of 10\u22127, which becomes a limiting factor for the entropy conservation error. We can observe that the global entropy change rate remains close to the numerical tolerance over time. We can thus conclude that the entropy conservative fluxes expressed in Eqs. (89)-(91) retain the global entropy conservation. We also validate that the Tadmor relation is retrieved when the two points\u2019 EC fluxes are multiplied into the jump in entropy variables, the product should be equal to the jump in potential function \u03c8."

The physical domain is defined as a 1D interval with constant initial profiles for temperature, velocity, and five species densities.

The initial mass fractions are determined assuming equilibrium condition at T\u221e = 350 K and P\u221e = 35.9593 Pa. The reference values are also calculated using the equilibrium assumption at T\u221e and P\u221e and shown in Table 4. The non-dimensional \u03c1u variable is initialized at 9.25. The 1D interval is defined as x \u2208 [0, 0.02] and the simulation is continued until tfinal = 0.03 when the steady state is reached.\nMarxen et al. [11] applied Dirichlet boundary condition at the inflow (x = 0.0) and the outflow conditions are enforced using a penalty source term applied on a sponge region defined as x \u2208 [0.01394, 0.02]. For the DGSEM scheme, the boundary conditions for the advective fluxes are enforced weakly through the approximate Riemann solver. Therefore, we define a sponge region at the inflow to mimic the Dirichlet condition of the finite difference code in [11]. We define a Lagrange multiplier to enforce desired values for the conservative variables at the boundaries. We modify the source term of the equations as\nSi = Si \u2212 \u03c3 (Ui \u2212 Ui,0) i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Ns + 2, (100) where Si is the source term for the ith transport equation.

In the inflow sponge region, we employed 5 elements, and for the rest of the domain, 40 elements are used and the polynomial order is set at P = 3. For this test case, the mass diffusion fluxes are set at zero similar to Marxen et al. work [11].\nA comparison between the viscous version of DGSEM scheme and Marxen et al. [11] finite difference approach is shown in Fig. 8(a)-(c). The results show a good agreement with the reference results except for a small discrepancy in the N and NO mass fraction profiles. The sources of the discrepancy can be attributed to two reasons. In the finite\ndifference code, the boundary condition is directly set as a Dirichlet condition at the inflow boundary. In contrast, for the DGSEM code, the conditions are applied weakly through the Riemann solver for advective fluxes. Second, the finite difference code does not recover the mass conservation, which would ensure the summation of all the mass fractions to be unity. The summation of all the five species mass fractions from Marxen\u2019s results adds up to 1.0035 at x = 0.01 for the steady-state solution. The amount of error in summing all the mass fractions in Marxen\u2019s results is in the same order as the difference in the mass fractions comparison. Therefore, the results of the viscous DGSEM scheme are likely more accurate since it preserves mass conservation and enforces unity for the summation of all the species\u2019 mass fractions."

            "text": "In this study, we sought to identify a high-order scheme that could simulate flows with strong shock waves close to vacuum conditions. We began by examining single-species test cases without real chemistry effects. Various existing high-order methods, such as FR, SD, WENO, DG, and DGSEM were considered as well as state-of-the-art stabilization schemes and positivity-preserving techniques for simulating strong shock waves. First, we compared the SD and FR schemes coupled with adaptive entropy modal filtering for positivity preserving and stabilization and entropy stable DGSEM (ES-DGSEM) scheme to simulate the Leblanc problem. With the ES-DGSEM scheme we obtained results with the most negligible amplitude of oscillations compared to the other spectral element methods. We then evaluated the three schemes by simulating the modified shock-density wave interaction problems, where the shock wave Mach number is 10, similar to the hypersonic regimes. The ES-DGSEM scheme can capture smooth high gradient flow conditions and shock discontinuities simultaneously without losing its high accuracy in the smooth regions of the solution.\nWe then employed various high-order schemes to simulate the Sod problem with simplified chemistry. The ES-DGSEM scheme reduced oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities compared to FR and SD schemes. The modal DG obtained inaccurate results, while the WENO approach had comparable accuracy with the ES-DGSEM scheme. After comparing the high-order methods using relevant benchmark problems, we extended the ES-DGSEM to hypersonic flows with real chemistry. The reason is that the DGSEM scheme can readily scale to large parallel computations compared to the high-order WENO schemes. Also, the FR and SD schemes with adaptive modal filtering are unstable in simulating five species gas mixtures.\nThe current study presents a high-order DGSEM framework to solve hypersonic flows governing equations with real chemistry models. An entropy stable scheme was first constructed for the hypersonic Euler equation with the five-species gas mixture model. The standard DGSEM scheme was reformulated into flux differencing representation; then, the two-point entropy conservative fluxes were derived to reconstruct a high-order entropy conservative framework. The blending shock-capturing technique was integrated into the entropy conservative method to achieve entropy stability. A positivity-preserving technique was also coupled with the ES-DGSEM to maintain the species\u2019 densities and pressure within the physical bounds. A novel formulation for the hypersonic Euler equation was also derived that retrieves the local and global entropy conservation up to the numerical precision enforced by the tolerance of inverting internal energy to the temperature. The entropy-stable DGSEM Euler solver was employed to solve a non-equilibrium Sod\nproblem with stiff reaction source terms. The entropy stable scheme showed good agreement with the reference results and generated a minimal amount of oscillations due to the discontinuities in the solution. The effect of considering real chemistry versus ideal chemistry was also investigated by considering a hypersonic Sod problem. The results demonstrated that as the driver gas temperature increased above a threshold, the ideal chemistry modeling results deviated drastically from the real chemistry modeling. Therefore, real chemistry modeling is essential for correctly simulating hypersonic flows.\nThe ES-DGSEM Euler solver was extended to the solution of the reactive Navier-Stokes equations. The diffusive fluxes were discretized using the BR1 approach. The reactive Navier-Stokes solver was then used to simulate a hypersonic viscous 1D steady-state solution behind a strong shock wave. The gas thermodynamic properties, transport coefficients, and chemical reaction source terms were all calculated using the Mutation++ library. The viscous test case verified the correct calculation of the species source terms along with the transport coefficients by coupling the Mutation++ library with the ES-DGSEM solver. In the future, the 1D hypersonic DGSEM scheme can be extended to 2D and 3D dimensions since the ES-DGSEM has been successfully extended to multiple dimensions for non-reactive flows."
