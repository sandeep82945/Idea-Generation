    "abstractText": "Applications of clathrate hydrate require fast formation kinetics of it, which is the longstanding technological bottleneck due to mass transfer and heat transfer limitations. Although several methods, such as surfactants and mechanical stirring, have been employed to accelerate gas hydrate formation, the problems they bring are not negligible. Recently, a new water-in-air dispersion stabilized by hydrophobic nanosilica, dry water, has been used as an effective promoter for hydrate formation. In this review, we summarize the preparation procedure of dry water and factors affecting the physical properties of dry water dispersion. The effect of dry water dispersion on gas hydrate formation is discussed from the thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. Dry water dispersion shifts the gas hydrate phase boundary to milder conditions. Dry water increases the gas hydrate formation rate and improves gas storage capacity by enhancing water-guest gas contact. The performance comparison and synergy of dry water with other common hydrate promoters are also summarized. The self-preservation effect of dry water hydrate was investigated. Despite the prominent effect of dry water in promoting gas hydrate formation, its reusability problem still remains to be solved. We present and compare several methods to improve its reusability. Finally, we propose knowledge gaps in dry water hydrate research and future research directions.",

            "text": "Gas hydrate, also known as clathrate hydrate, is a compound with an ice-like structure in which guest molecules are trapped inside cages formed by hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Despite its similarity to ice, clathrate hydrate can remain stable above the melting point of ice because of the cages stabilized by the guest molecules. Many gas molecules with a low solubility in water, such as low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen, can form hydrate crystals with water molecules when temperature and pressure conditions fall within the stable zone of the clathrate hydrate phase diagram. Compared to aqueous solutions, the amount of gas that can be accommodated in the form of clathrate is much greater, making it a promising option for gas storage applications. For example, CO2 hydrate can be used to capture and sequester CO2, which is a main greenhouse gas whose emission target was set to its reduction by about 45% by 2030 [1]. Transporting flammable or potentially explosive gases like H2 and natural gas is also safer with clathrate hydrate than with other methods like liquefaction. In contrast to guest gases, electrolytes are soluble in water and insoluble in clathrates, making clathrate hydrate useful for seawater desalination. Additionally, the differences in the thermodynamic conditions of different gas hydrate formations can be used for gas separation. Though promising, the commercialization of clathrate hydrate applications is limited by the low water-to-hydrate conversion rate and slow kinetics, which are caused by mass transfer limitations [2] and heat transfer limitations [3]. Because most guest molecules have low solubility in water, the mass transfer limitation results in the highest supersaturation\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3731. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093731 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3731 2 of 19\nat the guest-water interface. When hydrate forms, it blocks further guest diffusion to the bulk water phase because the hydrate phase is mostly impermeable to gases, limiting clathrate hydrate formation to the interface where the guest gas contacts the water directly. Furthermore, the exothermic nature of clathrate hydrate formation lowers the driving force, thereby slowing down the nucleation kinetics. To address the slow kinetics of clathrate hydrate formation, several methods have been employed. One such method is mechanical stirring, which has been shown to improve mass transfer, dissipate the latent heat released by hydrate formation, and increase the rate of hydrate formation [4]. Another method is the use of a surfactant, which was proved to be an effective kinetic hydrate promoter (KHP) by increasing the solubility of the guest in water and lowering the guest aqueous-phase interfacial tension [5\u201311]. The most commonly used surfactant has been sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [12,13]. However, many surfactants are toxic and not suitable for some clathrate hydrate applications like water desalination or food processing [14]. Another challenge of using a surfactant as a KHP is the severe formation of foams, which have a long lifetime that persists long after hydrate dissociation [15]. To this end, amino acids were investigated and found to enhance the clathrate hydrate formation rate without raising the problem of toxicity and bubbling [16,17], thus being more environmentally friendly. Like surfactants, an amino acid is an amphiphilic molecule with a hydrophobic chain and a hydrophilic carboxylic head. The mechanism of amino acids of promoting hydrate formation is similar to that of surfactants [17]. However, the effectiveness of an amino acid in promoting hydrate formation kinetics was found to be dependent on the type of the guest gases [18] and the hydrophobicity of the amino acid [19]. Additionally, amino acid-based compounds [20] were reported to have a promoting effect on gas hydrate formation. Ionic liquids (ILs), which are a type of organic salt, have been found to be effective in promoting gas hydrate formation. Several studies have reported that certain ILs, such as 1-hydroxyethyl-1-methylmorpholinium chloride [21], aromatic-based ILs [22], choline octanoate [23], and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate [24], promote methane hydrate formation. Interestingly, the promoting mechanism of ILs differs from that of surfactants. However, it is worth noting that both amino acids and ILs can either promote or inhibit hydrate formation, depending on their composition. Other environmentally friendly gas hydrate promoters have been developed to comply with increasingly strict environmental regulations, in addition to amino acids. Ignosulfonates [25\u201327] have been reported to promote gas hydrate formation due to their capillarity-driven characteristics, which improve gas diffusion from the bulk guest gas phase into the aqueous phase [28]. Biosurfactants, such as surfactin [29] and rhamnolipid [30], have the same mechanism as synthetic surfactants in promoting gas hydrate formation, but are more biodegradable. Recently, hydrate seed solutions have been utilized as nucleation sites to facilitate hydrate formation [31\u201333]. This technique involves the use of pre-formed gas hydrate crystals, such as cyclopentane hydrate, under mild conditions as hydrate seeds to promote gas hydrate formation that would otherwise require more demanding conditions, such as hydrogen hydrate and methane hydrate. Experimental results have confirmed its effectiveness in accelerating gas uptake and promoting the formation of hydrocarbonhydrogen mixed gas hydrates. Non-chemical-based methods have also been employed to enhance the kinetics of hydrate formation. The inclusion of nanoparticles (with a particle size between 1 and 100 nm) not only offers heterogeneous nucleation sites, thereby reducing the activation energy barrier to nucleation, but also greatly enhances the heat transfer characteristics of the system [34]. Studies conducted by Alibadi et al. showed nanoparticles (CuO) significantly increased the kinetics of hydrate formation [35]. Ahuja demonstrated the promoting effect of hydrophobic nanosilica on hydrate growth when combined with a surfactant (Span 80) [36]. It is important to note that one limitation of using nanoparticles as kinetic hydrate promoters (KHPs) is the cost and difficulty associated with the synthesis process. Furthermore,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3731 3 of 19\nnanoparticles have a high tendency to aggregate in the bulk phase due to their large surface area, thereby gradually losing their hydrate promoting effect over time, unless they are stabilized by surfactants. As a result, recent efforts have focused on improving the kinetics of hydrate formation through methods that enhance contact between the guest and the water molecules. A wide range of porous media has been investigated, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [37], silica sands [38\u201340], silica gels [39,41], superabsorbent polymers (SAP) [42\u201344], glass beads [45], clay [46], activated carbon [47,48], nanotubes [49,50], and biological porous materials [51]. If we disregard the impact of porous media on the phase equilibrium of gas hydrates, it is commonly believed that such media can provide a greater number of nucleation sites [52,53], increase the gas-liquid contact areas [54], thus promoting hydrate formation kinetics. The presence of porous media can also dissipate the latent heat of hydrate formation quickly [55] and improve the heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, it has been reported that Succinic Acid-Polyethylene Glycol (SAP) possesses the ability to promote hydrate formation kinetics while retaining methane storage capacity even after undergoing up to 20 cycles of hydrate formation and dissociation under specific temperature and pressure conditions [43]. The impact of factors, such as water saturation, gas flow rate, particle size, and the morphology of porous media on CO2 hydrate and methane hydrate formation and dissociation processes, has been extensively investigated in References [39,40], respectively. It is disappointing that the particle size of porous media has been found to have an opposite effect on hydrate formation kinetics and gas storage capacity [56]. In recent years, a novel type of water-in-air Pickering dispersion (aerosol), known as dry water, has emerged as an effective promoter of hydrate formation. Dry water droplets are primarily composed of water and nanoparticles, with water being the primary component. While it was first developed in 1964, it was not until the 1990s that scientists began to extensively study its properties [57]. The application of dry water to hydrate promotion was firstly proposed by Wang et al. in 2008 [58]. As its name suggests, dry water has the appearance of a free-flowing powder. We note that, although dry water has an appearance of a powder, dry water is in fact a dispersion (aerosol) in which water is the dispersed phase (droplets) and air is the continuous phase. It is a particle-stabilized dispersion composed of approximately 95% (w/w) water and 5% (w/w) hydrophobic nanosilica (Pickering agent).

Additionally, the structure of water molecules (not the molecular structure of H2O but the orientation of the molecules) can be reorganized in the vicinity of a hydrophobic surface [60], and the guest gas can be adsorbed at the surface of hydrophobic nanosilica to form a dense gas layer [61], thereby promoting hydrate formation thermodynamically. The preparation of dry water is straightforward,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3731 4 of 19\nand it is non-toxic and environmentally friendly, making it a promising candidate for promoting hydrate formation. However, before dry water can be widely used, several major challenges still need to be addressed. This review collates the progresses made in dry water research and provides a reference for future studies exploring dry water as a promoter of hydrate formation."

For instance, Rong et al. prepared mesoporous nanosilica particles with a comparable size of 15 nm but different degrees of hydrophobicity [62]. Only nanosilica with deep hydrophobization treatment (water contact angle higher than 110\u25e6) of the particles with grain sizes ranging from 30 to 100 \u00b5m produced dry water after vigorous stirring with water. Less hydrophobic ones, on the other hand, formed a souffl\u00e9-like mixture. In another study, Forny et al. found that, as the hydrophobicity of nanosilica increased (from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic), the products after blending with water transitioned from suspension to mousse and eventually to dry water. However, only superhydrophobic nanosilica with a water contact angle of approximately 118\u25e6 produced dry water [85]. Figure 3 shows the phase transition of the product after blending a water -nanosilica mixture, from dispersion to foam then to dry water, with increasing nanosilica hydrophobicity, characterized by the lower SiOH content indicated at the top of the figure.

Only nanosilica with deep hydrophobization treatment (water contact angle higher than 110\u00b0) of the particles with grain sizes ranging from 30 to 100 \u03bcm produced dry water after vigorous stirring with water. Less hydrophobic ones, on the other hand, formed a souffl\u00e9-like mixture. In another study, Forny et al. found that, as the hydrophobicity of nanosilica increased (from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic), the products after blending with water transitioned from suspension to mousse and eventually to dry water. However, only superhydrophobic nanosilica with a water contact angle of approximately 118\u00b0 produced dry water [85]. Figure 3 shows the phase transition of the product after blending a water -nanosilica mixture, from dispersion to foam then to dry water, with increasing nanosilica hydrophobicity, characterized by the lower SiOH content indicated at the top of the figure.

Mixing time that is too long or too short is also not conducive to the stability of dry water. After optimization, they determined that 1 g of hydrophobic silica should be mixed with 95 g of water under 30 s of blending at a speed of 22,000 rpm. Other studies, such as Zhang et al., also reported suitable blending rates as 4000\u20136000 rpm [84], and Chen et al. [90] found 5000 rpm to be optimal. Zou et al.

It has been observed that under these external stresses, water is squeezed out from dry water, resulting in phase separation and instability. Data showed that dry water stabilized by nanoparticles and gel had a higher capacity to resist water loss under high pressures, compared to the dry water stabilized solely by nanoparticles [67,84]. Cooling the dry water droplet down to 270 K has no effect on its structure, but high pressures and stirring cause instability [64]. Higher silica-to-water ratios also help dry water resist loss of stability caused by high pressure and stirring because smaller water droplet prepared under high silica content better maintains original shapes [61]. Smaller dry water droplet size, prepared from a high silica-to-water ratio, also improves dry water stability under severe external stresses [64]. Therefore, it is important to consider these external factors when examining the stability of dry water. In addition to high pressure and stirring, pH also impacts the stability of dry water. Rong et al. found that dry water stabilized by hydrophobic nanosilica underwent disassembly upon an addition of an acid due to the protonation of amine groups on the coating surface of silica particles [62]. B.P. Binks et al. found that only water with a pH between 7 and 9 forms dry water after blending with hydrophobic nanosilica. Therefore, pH is an important factor to consider when stabilizing dry water with hydrophobic nanosilica [74]. This point make CO2 hydrate formation in dry water might not be as stable as methane formation in dry water because the dissolution of CO2 in water renders the pH of the aqueous solution below 7."

In a separate study, Hu et al. measured the hydration number of dry water methane hydrate (6.224 \u00b1 0.175) and confirmed its homogeneity using Raman spectra [81,102].

Additionally, Drachuk et al. observed that an absence of an induction time for propane hydrate formation in frozen dry water compared to the typically long induction time for hydrocarbon gas hydrate [65]. This promoting effect occurred due to the enhanced guest-water contact and therefore more efficient methane diffusion into water, compared to methane hydrate formation at the methane-bulk water interface. This mechanism is consistent with the finding that hydrate formation rate in dry water closely correlated with the water droplet size dispersed by hydrophobic nanosilica [58].

In one study, Fan et al. performed hydrate formation experiments in a dry solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate and compared the gas storage kinetics of methane hydrate in dry surfactant solution with that of dry water methane hydrate [78]. Both hydrate formation in dry surfactant solution and dry water greatly enhanced methane hydrate formation rates compared to bulk water systems, and the former was found to be more effective. It was also found that methane hydrate in dry surfactant solution exhibited the same final methane storage capacity (around 170 m3/m3) as dry water methane hydrate but with faster storage rates, as confirmed by 60 min of t90 (the time taken to achieve 90% of final gas uptake) for dry surfactant solution and 200 min of t90 for dry water. The authors attributed the superior gas uptake kinetics of methane hydrate in dry surfactant solution to the better dispersion of water by dry water and the lower activity of water due to the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate molecules. On the other hand, Farhang et al. reported no synergistic effect (CO2 to hydrate conversion kept in between 40 and 50% for both dry water and THF + dry water systems) between dry water and the thermodynamic hydrate promoter (THP) tetrahydrofuran (THF) for any of the mixture ratios on CO2 hydrate formation kinetics [61].

Podenko et al. studied the effect of nanosilica content on methane hydrate formation rate and the selfpreservation effect and found that dry water with 7 wt% of R202 hydrophobic nanosilica had the optimal balance between the high hydrate formation rate and the high efficiency of self-preservation effect [75]."

Park et al. claimed that dry water gradually lost its stability, leading to a decrease in the hydrate fraction with the hydrate formation-dissociation cycles because of the phase separation of free water from dry water [79], which was confirmed using Raman spectra by Hu et al.

            "text": "Dry water has shown promise as a potential gas storage medium using clathrate hydrate formation, but there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, the preparation of dry water using hydrophobic nanosilica requires a significant amount of energy input, making it not cost-effective for large-scale production. Additionally, alternative Pickering agents that can disperse water through self-assembly need to be explored to replace hydrophobic nanosilica. Secondly, while dry water has proven to be effective in promoting CO2 and methane hydrate formation kinetics and enhancing respective gas storage capacity, there is still a gap in research on hydrogen storage in the form of dry water hydrate. The primary objective in hydrogen hydrate formation is to decrease the formation pressure. One approach is to explore the use of thermodynamic hydrate promoters, such as cyclopentane, which can form mixed gas hydrates with hydrogen at pressures considerably lower than that required for pure hydrogen hydrate formation. Additionally, although it is evident that the nanosilica content in dry water dispersion impacts gas hydrate formation kinetics by forming water droplets of various sizes, the effect of the shape of nanosilica on gas hydrate formation kinetics remains inadequately understood and could be a fascinating subject for future research. Fourthly, the reusability of dry water over hydrate formation-dissociation cycles without re-blending is a problem that still needs to be solved. Even though the addition of gelling agents has improved stability, the destabilization of dry water still occurs with increasing cycles. In the presence of hydrogel, the effect of hydrogel on the morphology of dry water clathrate hydrate also needs to be characterized. Fifthly, the self-preservation effect of dry water hydrate has not been thoroughly investigated, and maximizing its effectiveness during transportation of gas-stored dry water hydrate of different hydrate formers requires further research."

            "text": "The high gas uptake capacity of clathrate hydrate makes it an attractive material for gas storage and transportation, particularly for methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Gas storage in clathrate form is also much safer than traditional methods such as liquefaction or compression. However, slow formation kinetics due to mass transfer limits have hindered large-scale applications of clathrate hydrate for gas storage and transportation. While many methods have been applied to enhance formation kinetics, such as spraying, stirring, and adding hydrate promoters, these have limitations for large-scale applications. Recently,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3731 15 of 19\ndry water, a water-in-air dispersion stabilized by hydrophobic nanoparticles, has shown promising results in enhancing gas hydrate formation kinetics and gas storage capacity. This review summarizes the stabilizing mechanism of dry water droplet and the effect of physical conditions encountered during hydrate formation on the stability of dry water. The promoting mechanism of dry water on hydrate formation is also explored, with representative hypotheses listed. Extensive studies have shown that dry water has an excellent promoting effect on hydrate formation kinetics and gas storage capacity in the form of clathrate hydrate. However, existing critical issues, such as the destabilization of dry water after several formation-dissociation cycles, need to be addressed to enable large-scale applications of dry water in enhancing gas hydrate formation kinetics. This review also discusses future research directions for dry water hydrates.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) RGPIN-2019-04241.
