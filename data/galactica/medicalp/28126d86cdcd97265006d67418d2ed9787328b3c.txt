Cardiac image segmentation is a critical step in the early detection of cardiovascular disease. The segmentation of the biventricular is a prerequisite for evaluating cardiac function in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). In this paper, a cascaded model CAT-Seg is proposed for segmentation of 3D-CMRI volumes. CAT-Seg addresses the problem of biventricular confusion with other regions and localized the region of interest (ROI) to reduce the scope of processing. A modified DeepLabv3+ variant integrating SqueezeNet (SqueezeDeepLabv3+) is proposed as a part of CAT-Seg. SqueezeDeepLabv3+ handles the different shapes of the biventricular through the different cardiac phases, as the biventricular only accounts for small portion of the volume slices. Also, CAT-Seg presents a segmentation approach that integrates attention mechanisms into 3D Residual UNet architecture (3D-ResUNet) called 3D-ARU to improve the segmentation results of the three major structures (left ventricle (LV), Myocardium (Myo), and right ventricle (RV)). The integration of the spatial attention mechanism into ResUNet handles the fuzzy edges of the three structures. The proposed model achieves promising results in training and testing with the Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC 2017) dataset and the external validation using MyoPs. CAT-Seg demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art models. On ACDC 2017, CAT-Seg is able to segment LV, Myo, and RV with an average minimum dice symmetry coefficient (DSC) performance gap of 1.165%, 4.36%, and 3.115% respectively. The average maximum improvement in terms of DSC in segmenting LV, Myo and RV is 4.395%, 6.84% and 7.315% respectively. On MyoPs external validation, CAT-Seg outperformed the state-of-theart in segmenting LV, Myo, and RV with an average minimum performance gap of 6.13%, 5.44%, and 2.912% respectively. conclusion In this study, a fully automatic multi-stage segmentation framework CAT-Seg is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of two proposed architectures. In the first, ROI is localized by the modified variant SqueezeDeepLabv3+, to minimize processing and address the issue of pixel class
imbalance. The proposed architecture for SqueezeDeepLabv3+ uses SqueezeNet to enrich the encoder path. Also, SqueezeDeepLabv3+ modifies the atrous rate to localize the small structures like RV in ES. The second step involves submitting the ROI to 3D-ARU for segmentation. The proposed 3D-ARU uses ResUNet incorporating a spatial attention mechanism. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method produces a mean DSC of 0.9595 in ED and 0.9541 in ES. In comparison to the single-stage segmentation process, the division into steps performed better. This is supported by the evaluation of the performance using the ACDC 2017 test dataset, where the proposed method achieves higher performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in segmentation. CAT-Seg achieved an average maximum improvement in segmenting LV, Myo and RV of 4.395%, 6.84% and 7.315% respectively. Similar results are achieved when applied on the test set only of MyoPs 2020, producing a mean DSC of 0.9163 and mIoU of 0.8581. In conclusion, CAT-Seg offers a useful assistive tool to aid the early detection and treatment planning of cardiovascular diseases, which is critical for a better prognosis.
