Familysupportive supervisor behavior substantially weakens the relationship between ESB and WFBP and the indirect effect of WFBP. Similarly, family support undermines the relationship between WFBP and WFC and the indirect effect of WFBP. Employee-level stewardship and blurred work\u2013family boundaries have been common phenomena in contemporary China, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is among the first to focus on the negative impacts of employee stewardship behaviors on the employee, especially on their family, from a Chinese context.

            "text": "Stewardship behavior refers to the attitudes and behaviors of individuals who place the organization\u2019s long-term interests above their own [1]. Stewardship behavior is a pro-organizational behavior motivated by intrinsic motivation [2,3] and is altruistic and voluntary. Previous research on stewardship behavior focused on managers and family firms [4,5]. Employees\u2019 stewardship behavior is prevalent in the Chinese context, where collectivism is emphasized [6]. With increasing organizational competition, stewardship behavior can enhance individual creativity and organizational performance, including creating a competitive advantage [7\u20139]. Moreover, stewardship behavior is beneficial for organizational survival and sustainability [3]. Given the positive impact of stewardship, researchers have studied which factors motivate individual stewardship behavior, including psychological ownership [10] and trust [1] at the individual level; and leadership behaviors [1], collectivism, and low power distance organizational culture [2,11] at the organizational level. However, limited attention has been paid to the possible negative consequences of stewardship behavior on employees and their work\u2013family relationships. Since 2020, influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and closure policies, work from home [12,13] and flexible working arrangements [14,15] have become a passive or an\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

Even with the development of communication technologies, working from home has become a regular part of employees\u2019 work lives [15,16]. \u201cIf there is hysteresis as people learn new ways to work remotely and businesses reorganize, the pandemic-driven changes may portend more lasting effects on the organization of work\u201d [17]. However, working from home has posed new challenges for companies. Working from home has blurred the work\u2013family boundary and family\u2013work conflicts have become more serious. According to a 2018 NASDAQ: JOBS survey of white-collar workers in China, more than 60% of respondents experienced varying degrees of work\u2013family conflict, which have been exacerbated to some extent by the pandemic since 2020. The recent literature on working from home also reflects the conflicts that have arisen between family and work during the pandemic lockdown, such as increased stress levels [18], household and childcare burdens [19] and work interruption [20], among others. Additionally, due to the employee supervision challenges created by working from home, the initiative and self-motivation of employees had to be enhanced to improve their efficiency and productivity. Employee stewardship, as a voluntary pro-organizational behavior of employees, will play a more important role in work-from-home scenarios. However, the studies in the work\u2013family domain during the pandemic have focused on employee well-being [21], work engagement, and stress [22], but studies of employee stewardship behavior are lacking. In work-from-home scenarios during a pandemic, employees with stewardship behaviors may prioritize the allocation of limited resources to work, reducing family-to-work conflicts and thus safeguarding work efficiency and quality. However, employees\u2019 stewardship behavior toward the organization may exacerbate work\u2013family conflict, having negative consequences for the good stewards as well as their families. Therefore, the impact of stewardship behavior on employee work\u2013family relationships should be explored. Theoretically, the aim of this study was to fill the gap in the research on the family spillover effects of employee stewardship behavior, as well as on stewardship behavior as a predictive factor in the work\u2013family domain during the pandemic. In terms of organizational practice, understanding the potential benefits and costs of employee stewardship behavior on employees can better guide managers in implementing interventions. The findings of this study contribute to the current literature in three aspects: First, by exploring the negative impact of employee stewardship behavior (ESB) on work\u2013family conflict (WFC), the current understanding of the cost of good stewards in work\u2013family balance situations is understood. Second, given the highly blurred work\u2013family boundary situation during the pandemic, we investigated how good stewards produce WFC via the penetration of work into the family. Third, the findings shed light on the mediation effect of ESB on WFC by exploring the moderating role of two types of support from work and family situations, which extends the boundary conditions of the process of ESB on WFC and advances our understanding of how to help good stewards balance work and family."

            "text": "Based on the work\u2013home resources model (W-HR) [23], we argue that employee stewardship has a negative spillover effect on work\u2013home relationships. The W-HR is based on resource conservation theory [24], a theoretical framework that was explicitly proposed to explain positive and negative work\u2013home processes. The W-HR provides an accurate explanatory perspective for research in the work\u2013home domain in terms of resource conservation and depletion [23,24]. The W-HR theory states that WFC occurs when the workplace demands consume personal resources and prevent individuals from contributing to the family domain. As mentioned above, with the increasing virtualization of work and the occurrence of COVID-19, working from home and flexible work arrangements have further contributed to the blurring of work\u2013family boundaries [16,25]. Good stewards are often able to provide valuable personal resources (e.g., time, energy, and other resources) for the collective good of the organization, regardless of personal reward [1]. Good stewards willingly focus more on their work domain, which likely penetrates the family domain, leading\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 3 of 17\nto WFC. Based on the current reality and theoretical relevance, in this study, work\u2013family permeation was chosen to represent the resource depletion mechanism. The W-HR model suggests that the extent to which individual behavior generates or consumes resources varies across situational resource conditions and thus has different effects on work\u2013family relationships [26]. According to the W-HR framework, support from work or family situations can provide additional resources for individuals to better balance and allocate resources in work and family settings, thereby inhibiting the negative effects of employees\u2019 stewardship behaviors on the family domain. Family-friendly organizational policies and informal organizational support are essential resources that enable employees to manage their work and family responsibilities [27\u201329]. Specific support from supervisors in the family domain, such as empathy, resources, and action, can help subordinates achieve a better balance between work and family responsibilities than general organizational support [26,27,30]. In non-work situations, social support, specifically from family members, can help employees avoid work\u2013family conflict [31]. Therefore, we introduced two contextual resources, family-supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB) (support from the organizational situation) and family support (support from the social situation), to examine their moderating effects on the depletion mechanisms of ESB. In summary, we investigated the mechanism through which ESB influences employees in terms of work\u2013family conflict (WFC). Specifically, we examined the work\u2013family permeation\u2019s mediation effect of ESB on WFC. We explored whether the indirect effect of ESB on WFC through work\u2013family permeation is moderated by two sources of support, namely, the supervisor\u2019s family support and family support.

Figure 1 shows the research model.\nStewardship behavior refers to managers who are willing to sacrifice their self-interests to maximize the interests of their principals or shareholders and was initially targeted at managers rather than employees [32].

This concept refers to the behavior of individuals in an organization (either managers or employees) who prioritize the organizatio \u2019s long-term interests over their personal short-term interests. ESB compr s s two esse tial characteristics: (1) d dication, where stewards contribut valuable personal resources, such as time, en gy, and other resources, to the collective good of the organization, regardless of personal reward [1]; (2) organizational l ng-term inter st priority, where stewards prioritize the collective long-term interest of the organization when they are faced with a conflict between their individual short-term interests and the collective long-term interests of the organization [2]. Particularly in the Chinese context, stewards are more likely to prioritize organizational requirements over their family matters because of individual perceptions of collectivism, which leads to WFC. Work\u2013family conflict refers to the inter-role conflict that arises when the demands of work and family roles conflict with each other [34]. Work\u2013family conflict can be further divided into two directions: WFC and family\u2013work conflict [35]. We only discussed WFC in this study. Individuals have limited time, attention, and energy (physical and mental) resources [36]. Allocating resources to one role means reducing the resources available for other roles [37]. Good stewards contribute more time, energy, and other resources to\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 4 of 17\nthe work domain and fewer resources to the family, resulting in a WFC. Based on this, the following hypothesis is proposed:\nHypothesis 1. ESB is positively related to WFC."

            "text": "Work\u2013family boundary permeation is generally defined as the extent to which elements of one domain enter another [38]. By contrast, the willingness to cross work\u2013family boundaries is the extent to which an individual\u2019s current role allows for the integration and absorption of the elements of another role [39]. Similarly, work\u2013family penetration can be divided into two aspects: work\u2013family penetration and family\u2013work penetration [38]. In this study, we mainly discussed work\u2013family penetration. Furthermore, permeability is asymmetric [40]; for example, the same individual may have work\u2013family permeability but weak family\u2013work permeability. Permeability depends on the differential energy of the work and family domains [38]: the stronger the domain, the more likely its boundaries are to be firm, so are less likely to be penetrated by other domains but may penetrate other domains. According to the W-HR model, work roles can prevent individuals from fulfilling their family responsibilities because of limited resources and spillover effects [30]. Stewardship behavior implies that employees voluntarily become stewards and protectors of the organization, pursue their social values, and focus on the long-term and sustainable development of the firm [1]. Thus, individuals with stewardship behavior tend to have a stronger organizational identity [41]. Then, because the work domain of individuals with stewardship behaviors is more important than the family domain, resource allocation skews toward the work domain. This can even occur at the expense of allocating resources on the family side to secure resources on the work side, which more likely produces work\u2013family penetration. Boundary penetration can be classified into three types: physical, temporal, and psychological penetration [38]. Physical penetration refers to work (or family) matters or people entering the home (or work) space, whereas temporal penetration refers to work (or family) time requiring home (or work) time. Psychological penetration mostly refers to emotional or attitudinal spillover and the migration of ideas and skills. High-permeability boundaries allow the aspects of a person\u2019s characteristic behaviors and expressions to spill over into another life area [38]. In addition, permeability can indicate that an individual\u2019s current role allows them to be in one area when their mind is focused elsewhere (i.e., to be absent of mind, this is thinking about home while at work or thinking about work while at home) [42]. Work penetration into the home (e.g., working from home, taking work home, work-related contacts at home, and work\u2013family multitasking) was associated with work\u2013family conflict and stress [43]. According to the above analysis, individuals with stewardship behaviors are more likely to experience objective versus subjective work\u2013family penetration, and work\u2013family penetration exacerbates work\u2013family conflict [29,44,45]. Therefore, the following hypothesis was constructed:\nHypothesis 2. Employees\u2019 WFBP mediates the relationship between ESB and WFC."

            "heading": "2.3. Moderating Role of a Family-Supportive Supervisor and Family Support",
            "text": "According to the W-HR model, we suggest that support from the organization can attenuate the relationship between stewardship and work\u2013family penetration. Support from the family can attenuate the relationship between work\u2013family penetration and WFC. First, workplace social support is a vital work resource that positively impacts individuals and organizations [46,47]. Supervisor-specific support of the family domain is more strongly associated with employees\u2019 work\u2013family conflict than general organizational support [48]. The supervisor behavior that involves the understanding and support of employees in balancing work and family life is defined as family-supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB). FSSB is evidenced by supervisors providing emotional and instrumen-\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 5 of 17\ntal support to employees, modeling work\u2013family balance, and implementing innovative work\u2013family management [30]. FSSB supports both work and family and helps employees balance the dual stress of work and family roles, thereby effectively alleviating the work\u2013 family conflict faced by employees [49]. When the degree of FSSB is high in an organization, supervisors help employees balance work and family life by providing resources and support and adopting innovative management practices, such as initiating work reorganization and flexible work hours and work locations. Thus, employees gain a degree of job autonomy [30] and self-actualization is promoted [50]. By stimulating positive emotions and encouraging employees to enhance their work skills and improve their productivity, for employees with stewardship behaviors, the possibility of their work penetrating into their families is lower. Family-supportive supervisors set an example of fulfilling family responsibilities by sharing techniques they use for balancing work and family life with their subordinates [50] and supporting employees in their family responsibilities. As such, stewardship employees can perceive the organization\u2019s support of their own families. They are willing to restrict the penetration of work into their families when responding to their supervisors\u2019 requests. Conversely, when the degree of FSSB in the organization is low, employees with a tendency toward stewardship behaviors are willing to assume more work responsibilities. ESB leads to higher willingness toward and increased work\u2013family penetration. Based on the above analysis, we propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3a. Family-supportive supervisor moderates the positive relationship between ESB and WFBP so that the positive relationship is weaker when the employees perceive that the familysupportive supervising is high.\nIn terms of the family situation, family support substantially impacts work\u2013family conflict [31]. The actual work\u2013family conflict occurs between the work and family domain needs [34]. If employees choose to prioritize work needs, it may result in the infiltration of work into the family, which produces WFC. Family support is divided into instrumental and emotional support. Instrumental support refers to the behaviors and attitudes of family members in managing the family\u2019s daily affairs, which reflects the willingness of family members to share the responsibilities of family affairs. Examples of this support include actively helping those working outside of the home in the family to reduce and eliminate excessive family responsibilities and family affairs and adjusting family life to the work schedule or needs of those who are out working [51]. Strong family instrumental support means that family members proactively share household chores and reduce the objective resource investment required by employees in the family. Thus, the family stress caused by the actual work\u2013family permeation situation decreases (e.g., a short time at home, presence of cared-for members, and separation due to work) [51], thereby promoting higher work\u2013family balance. Emotional support refers to behaviors and attitudes including encouragement, understanding, concern, greeting, and problem-solving orientation expressed by the family. That is, family members show their willingness to listen to and talk with the employee in the family (outworking) and provide advice to the person outworking about work [51]. For employees with high emotional family support levels, family support allows employees to perceive that their choice to prioritize work is accepted, accommodated, and understood. Particularly in China, a work-first social norm is commonly held, where work is more than just a personal matter and a means to enhance the overall interests and honor of the family [52]. Hard work is also considered a sign of having family responsibilities [52,53]. Family members of Chinese employees tend to express understanding of the infiltration of work matters into the family. This family support behavior may weaken the WFC resulting from work-to-family infiltration. Conversely, when the level of family support in the family is low, the infiltration of work into the employee\u2019s family will lead to subjectively and objectively higher WFC. Based on the above analysis, we propose the following hypothesis:\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 6 of 17\nHypothesis 3b . Family support moderates the positive relationship between WFBP and WFC, so that the positive relationship is weaker when the employees perceive that family support is strong.\nThe relationship between stewardship behavior and WFC examined in this study reflects the contradiction between the demands of the work and family domains. Given the limitation of personal resources (time and energy), employees with a tendency toward stewardship behavior cannot effectively balance work and family roles. Employees are more willing to prioritize work over family responsibilities, work overtime, or take work home to complete, and their roles penetrate the family domain, causing WFC. According to the W-HR model, FSSB relieves the stress imposed by work demands and helps employees preserve resources in the work and family domains by providing support that balances the demands of both domains. Moreover, FSSB provides employees with a greater sense of control over work and family demands [47] and access to critical work\u2013family conflict resolution resources [54]. The family-supportive leader in the organization emphasizes support of the family aspects of the employee\u2019s life, potentially undermining the WFC caused by ESBs through work-to-family penetration. When the degree of FSSB in the organization is low, employees inclined toward stewardship behavior will experience more pressure from work; sacrifice their personal lives, including family, for the betterment of the organization; and become more unable to balance work and family demands. Therefore, Hypothesis 4a was constructed:\nHypothesis 4a. FSSB moderates the indirect effect of ESB on WFC via WFBP, such that the indirect effect is weaker when the employees perceive that the family support of the supervisor is high.\nEmployees with a tendency toward stewardship behavior usually experience highfrequency and -intensity work\u2013family permeability. The more permeable the work\u2013family boundaries, the greater the work\u2013family conflicts [29,45]. At strong levels of family support, employees perceive less family stress and they can more efficiently complete work tasks and responsibilities, allowing resources to be effectively preserved while allowing time and energy for family needs, objectively weakening the WFC caused by stewardship behaviors through work\u2013family permeability. When the degree of family support is low, employees with stewardship behavior face pressure from work and family, which more likely causes the depletion of personal resources (e.g., time and energy). Thus, complicated family affairs affect employees\u2019 positive emotions and work efficiency. Employees cannot efficiently complete organizational requirements, so spend more time and energy meeting work demands. For instance, working overtime and working from home after work may cause mutual complaints between employees and families, reinforcing the WFC caused by stewardship behavior through work-to-family penetration. Based on the above analysis, we propose the following:\nHypothesis 4b. Family support moderates the indirect effect of ESB on WFC via work\u2013family border permeation, such that the indirect effect is weaker when the employees perceive that family support is high."

We contacted the HR executives of each of the three companies in advance and created electronic questionnaires through Questionnaire Star, which were sent by the HR executives to the companies\u2019 WeChat groups for data collection. We performed attention checks in both rounds of the survey to ensure that respondents paid attention to all items of the questionnaire.

Two weeks later, at time 2, we invited the 365 participants who had participated in the time-1 survey to report their perceptions of work-to-family border permeation (WFBP), family support, and WFC. Of the 365 participants, 341 responded. After the data collection, we filtered and deleted the problematic ones (e.g., incompletely answered questionnaires).

Further, in Model 6, the effect of ESB on WFC was reduced and not significant. Meanwhile, WFBP was significantly related to WFC (\u03b2 = 0.416, p < 0.001), indicating that WFBP mediated the influence of ESB on WFC. In addition, we used the Monte Carlo simulation approach [57] to assess the indirect effect. The results showed that the indirect effect of ESB on employees\u2019 WFC was 0.238, 95% CI = [0.095, 0.380], reaching a significant level.

            "text": "Our findings provide a fourfold contribution to the literature. First, the findings advance the understanding of the effects of employee ste ardship behaviors. Previously, researchers typically focused on how stewardship behavior benefits employees, organiza-\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 12 of 17\ntions, and stakeholders [59]. Thus, the influence of stewardship behavior has been studied more in terms of individual- and organizational-level factors, such as psychological, structural, supervisory, situational, and cultural factors [10], with a lack of focus on the possible negative consequences of stewardship behavior. As a voluntary pro-organizational behavior, employees who exceed work expectations are prone to fatigue, which has conceptualized the negative fatigue-related consequences of employee involvement in organizational citizenship behavior as organizational citizenship fatigue [60]. These findings help us understand that good stewardship comes at a cost as individuals have limited time, energy, and resources. We explored the negative effects of employee stewardship behavior on employees based on an actor-centered perspective. Based on the W-HR model, we explored the positive and negative effects of employee stewardship behavior on employees in terms of the mechanism of resource consumption (the penetration of work into the family). We found that good stewards allocate more of their limited resources to work and less to family, which helps to more comprehensively explain the positive effects of stewardship behavior on work and the negative effects on employees, and enriches the current literature in the fields of stewardship behavior and work\u2013family boundaries. Second, our findings enrich the employee stewardship behavior and work\u2013family relationship literature. Most previous studies on stewardship behavior have been limited to the work domain [61], and the spillover effects of stewardship behavior on the family have been ignored. However, with the development of communication technology and the arrival of the post-pandemic era, employees are increasingly working from home, and the boundary between employees\u2019 work and family is being increasingly blurred [25]. Based on this, we focused on the effect of stewardship behavior on employee work\u2013family relationships. The study reveals the mechanism of the effect of employee stewardship behavior on work\u2013family conflict through work-to-family penetration. Based on the WHR model, this study reveals the \u201cblack box\u201d of family spillover effects of employee stewardship from a resource perspective, and organically integrates the study of employee stewardship with work\u2013family relationships. Third, our study extends the literature on the family cost of good stewardship by uncovering the boundary conditions of two sources of support: work and family. Researchers have mainly explored the direct impact of organizational support versus family support on work\u2013family conflict. This is the first study related ESB to the concept of the family domain; however, according to the W-HR model, the external resource permeation between work and family situations may impact ESB through the process of work-to-family permeation, thereby promoting WFC. We chose FBBS from the work situation and FS from the family situation as the factors affecting the work\u2013family balance relationship. We also investigated its moderating effect on the relationship between ESB and WFC. The results revealed that emotional and instrumental support from FBBS considerably inhibited the willingness to accept and the possibility of work-to-family penetration because of ESB. Emotional and instrumental support from the family strongly inhibited WFC because of employee work-to-family penetration, extending the boundary conditions of the negative effect of ESB. Moreover, the findings advance the current understanding of how good stewards can achieve work\u2013family balance. Finally, this study expands the research objects and contexts of stewardship behavior. Previously, researchers of stewardship behavior focused on managers and family firms [4], whereas we followed Davis [32] and Hernandez [1] in extending the consideration of stewardship behavior to the employee level. Moreover, researchers on stewardship behavior have focused on the factors and results of stewardship behavior in the workplace. In this study, we considered the possible adverse effects of good stewards\u2019 dedication to the organization on families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most companies had to adopt more flexible work arrangements and work-from-home patterns, increasing the blurring of work\u2013family boundaries. In a general context, we placed ESB in a dual work\u2013family context and examined the possible adverse effects of ESB in the workplace context on the\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 13 of 17\nfamily. We also considered the moderating effect of support from the work and family domains on this impact path."

            "text": "Stewardship is a pro-organizational behavior that contributes to the long-term wellbeing of the organization\u2019s stakeholders and considerably benefits organizational development and innovation. Especially in a work-from-home scenario during a pandemic, a high degree of conscious pro-organizational behavior (ESB) can effectively disrupt the family. Good stewards have a positive effect on work, but have a negative effect on themselves, and at a cost to the family. Therefore, in practice, managers need to help employees balance work and family by designing and implementing policies and measures to motivate employees to consistently demonstrate balanced stewardship behavior. The results of this study have several implications for managers: First, managers can provide employees who engage in stewardship behaviors with material and psychological resources. For example, organizations can help employees replenish resources used for practicing stewardship by including ESBs in the scope of performance evaluations and offering financial rewards. Managers can also use various opportunities during the workday to provide employees moral rewards (e.g., recognition and praise) for engaging in stewardship behaviors. Thus, employees may feel a sense of value and meaning by engaging in stewardship behaviors, which can be supported by the organization [62] and can quickly replenish employees\u2019 psychological resources, alleviating the disadvantages of ESBs for employees. Second, managers can develop support activities that directly or indirectly target employee families. Examples include additional family-related benefits created for employees that allow employees to fully assume their family responsibilities. Moreover, paid family leave, maternity leave, travel allowances, flexible benefits, childcare, early childhood-related allowances, and family days [63] are also helpful. In China, the more common benefits are maternity leave, flexible benefits, family days, and measures to help employees with stewardship behaviors to solve family problems, such as breastfeeding rooms, babysitting rooms, psychological counseling, childcare centers in the workplace, and solutions to children\u2019s schooling problems. More family support is required for employees with stewardship behaviors to mitigate the negative effects on families. Third, in the recruitment and selection process, a survey can be conducted on employees\u2019 family status to select employees with strong family support. After employees join the company, through training and family concept promotion, they can be supported in establishing harmonious family relationships to relieve their worries about engaging in family-related behaviors, which can more strongly promote work\u2013family balance and ultimately achieve a win-win situation for both the organization and the employees."

            "heading": "5.3. Limitations and Future Directions",
            "text": "With this study, we explained the negative effects of stewardship behavior as a whole, but some limitations need to be explored further in future studies: First, we measured the variables used in this study through employees\u2019 subjective evaluations. Bias in the testing effect was introduced by the possible tendency of employees to protect their privacy and manage their reputation. In the future, researchers can further validate the robustness of the findings through experimental methods or by collecting paired data. In addition, we used a time-lagged approach to obtain data, which reduced the bias of the common approach to some extent but, causal relationships cannot be inferred between variables. Therefore, longitudinal measures should be used in the future to effectively verify causal relationships. Second, we mainly used a sample of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from south China. Using this sample effectively controlled the effects of firm type and regional factors and improved the study\u2019s internal validity. However, it also limited the possibility of the findings being extrapolated to other regions of the country or abroad. As the Chinese\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6117 14 of 17\ncontext is characterized by a high collectivist orientation [6], employee-level stewardship is widespread. In the future, researchers can extend our method study to other regions or empirically examine the effects of employee-level stewardship in other countries. In addition, our study sample was mainly obtained from Internet companies. We did not consider other industries (e.g., employees of state-owned enterprises or nonprofit organizations who may have higher stewardship behaviors) and different types of employees (e.g., managerial versus non-managerial employees), which may have impacted our findings. However, given the lack of consideration of these issues at the beginning of the study design, controlling these control variables during the data analysis was impossible. In future studies, researchers can use data from different industries and other types of employees to reduce the impact of these additional variables and further validate our results. Third, in exploring the outcome variables of stewardship behaviors, we focused on the effects of ESBs on the family domain and other paths of stewardship behaviors on the family domain, which deserve further exploration. Servant leadership behavior comprises a servant, humble attitude that creates a safe and friendly work atmosphere, allowing leaders to experience positive emotions and therefore smoother and lower-friction daily interactions with subordinates. The positive emotions experienced by leaders after serving their subordinates are a vital personal resource that can have positive spillover effects and moderate work\u2013family conflict [34]. ESBs and servant leadership emphasize selflessness in the organization. Employees who exhibit stewardship behaviors may also experience positive emotions that positively impact WFC. In the future, researchers can examine the positive effects of stewardship behaviors on the family domain. Fourth, in this study, we mainly examined the impact of ESBs in the work domain on the family domain to explore how good corporate stewardship enables work-to-family balance. However, work-to-family penetration and WFC involve two-way relationships, that is, work-to-family penetration (conflict) and family-to-work penetration (conflict). Additionally, we only considered the mechanism of action in a single direction. In the Chinese scenario, hard work and dedication to the organization are seen as signs of responsibility to the family [52], and stewardship behaviors may also influence the family\u2019s evaluation of the employee and thus family-to-work conflict. The mechanisms of the role of stewardship behavior on the outcomes of both directions of work\u2013family balance (family-to-work vs. work-to-family) can be considered."

As a voluntary pro-organizational behavior of employees, employee stewardship behavior (ESB) will play a more critical role in work-from-home scenarios. Although good stewards will effectively reduce family interference with work because they will prioritize their limited resources to work rather than family matters, they will create work-family conflicts (WFC) meanwhile. Drawing on the work-home resources model, we proposed a model clarifying how ESB affects WFC. The results revealed that work-to-family border permeation (WFBP) mediates the impact of ESB on WFC. Two sources of support, namely, the supervisor\u2019s family support and family support, weaken the indirect effect of ESB on WFC through WFBP. This study is among the first to focus on the costs of employee stewardship behavior on the employee themselves in the work-to-family penetration context during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.Q. and L.W.; methodology C.Q.; software, C.Q., L.W. and X.G.; validation C.Q., L.W. and X.G.; formal analysis, C.Q. and L.W.; investigation, C.Q.; resources, L.W. and X.G.; data curation, C.Q.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.Q. and X.G.; writing\u2014 review and editing, C.Q. and L.W.; Funding acquisition, L.W.
