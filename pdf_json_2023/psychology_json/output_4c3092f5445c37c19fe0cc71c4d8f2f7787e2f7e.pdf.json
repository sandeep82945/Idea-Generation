    "abstractText": "In this study, a carboxylated carbon nanotube-grafted Ag3PO4@AgIO4 (CNT-COO\u2212/ Ag3PO4@AgIO4) composite was synthesized through an in situ electrostatic deposition method. The synthesized composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The electron transfer ability of the synthesized composite was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The CNT-COO/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite exhibited higher activity than CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and bare Ag3PO4. The material characterization and the detailed study of the various parameters thataffect the photocatalytic reaction revealed that the enhanced catalytic activity is related to the good interfacial interaction between CNT-COO and Ag3PO4. The energy band structure analysis is further considered as a reason for multi-electron reaction enhancement. The results and discussion in this study provide important information for the use of the functionalized CNT-COOH in the field of photocatalysis. Moreover, providinga new way to functionalize CNT viadifferent functional groups may lead to further development in the field of photocatalysis. This work could provide a new way to use natural sunlight to facilitate the practical application of photocatalysts toenvironmental issues.",

            "text": "Since the application of semiconductors as photocatalysts was discovered [1], enormous efforts have been madeto develop and enhance their catalytic performance by discovering new photosensitized material or designing heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts [2\u201312]. Recently, Ag3PO4 has been discovered as a novel semiconductor photocatalyst with exclusive photocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution and organic pollutant removal [13\u201315]. However, its highest possibility of photocorrosion stands as the main drawback that hinders its practical application [13,16,17]. Therefore, it isnecessaryto overcome this drawback by designing and constructing Ag3PO4-based composites. Recently, AgIO4 withconduction and valence bands of 3.61 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively, has beenreported as a promising visible light-responsive photocatalyst [18]. Therefore, fabricating Ag3PO4 with AgIO4 can successfully improve charge separation and transportation. Carbon-based substrates played an important role in supporting the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts due to their novel chemical, thermal, electrical, and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1586. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041586 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1586 2 of 14\noptical properties. Carbon nanotubes (CNT), which are fabricated from sp2 carbon, have attracted researchers\u2019 attention due to their unique specific surface area (100\u2013700 m2 g\u22121), and electronic, optical, chemical, and thermal characteristics [12,19\u201325]. These properties recommend CNT as a novel material for catalyst carriers and supporters in heterogeneous catalysts. Some studies have reported improved photocatalytic activity for CNT-based composites [26\u201331]. However, the low dispersion and the poor interfacial interaction between CNT and other materials remain the major disadvantages that limit their practical application as catalyst supporters [32\u201334]. Therefore, functionalization of CNT achieved by attaching electronegative groups or aliphatic carbon chains may increase their dispersion. Furthermore, this process can provide a more active surface on the CNT, allowing for a greater amount of catalyst materials to be loaded onto the CNT\u2019s surface.Based on the above analysis, CNT might be used as an electron capture agent to increase the activity and stability of Ag3PO4.Therefore, developing a high-efficiency photocatalyst is always a hot research topic in the photocatalytic field. In this study, CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 was synthesized with enhanced photocatalytic activity through an in situ electrostatic deposition method, which was then characterized using different techniques. The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized CNT-COO/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 was evaluated based onthe degradation of methylene blue as the target dye under natural sunlight. In addition, the effect of the optimal CNT-COOH amount on the photocatalytic performance was also investigated. Moreover, the mechanism of photodegradation was proposed."

After the negatively charged CNT-COO was suspended in water and the Ag+ ions were added, the electrostatic interaction derived the adsorption of the positively charged Ag+ ions onto the negatively charged CNT-COO to form intermediate complexes of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag+. After Na2HPO4 was dropped into the mixture, the HPO42\u2212 could react with Ag+ ions on the surface of CNTCOO to form Ag3PO4 nuclei. As the reaction proceeded, Ag3PO4 particles successfully grew on the surface of CNT-COO. The addition of KIO4, which was added dropwise, into the solution mixture resulted in the formation of large-sized AgIO4 particles, which were grafted by CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4 to form the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite.

FT-IR Analysis\nThe as-synthesized materials were first characterized by FT-IR, and the results areshown in Figure 2a. Non-carboxylated CNT does not have any characteristic peaks,whereas the carboxylated one (CNT-COOH) shows CO stretching vibration at about 1700 cm\u22121, and the \u2212OH groups show stretching and bending vibrations at about 3450 cm\u22121 and 1615 cm\u22121, respectively, confirming the successful carboxylation of CNT. In the FTIR spectra of AgIO4, a band located between 626\u2013830 cm\u22121 is attributed to the vibrations between Ag-I-O atoms. The \u2212OH group of the physically absorbed H2O shows stretching and bending vibrations at 3450 cm\u22121 and 1630 cm\u22121, respectively. In the spectra of Ag3PO4, the peak located at 553 cm\u22121 is attributed to the bending vibration of the O=P-O. The symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of P-O-P rings are found at 853 and 998 cm\u22121, respectively. The absorbed H2O molecules are shown to have bending and stretching vibrations at 1662 and 3420 cm\u22121, respectively. The P=O shows stretching vibration at 1393 cm\u22121. In the spectra of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and Ag3PO4@AgIO4, all the characteristic vibration peaks of the individual materials CNT-COO\u2212, Ag3PO4, and AgIO4 are present, which proves the formation of the heterocomposite.\n2.2.2. XRD Analysis The phase purity and the crystal structure of AgIO4, Ag3PO4, Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composites are identified by XRD spectra, which are shown in Figure 2b. Pure Ag3PO4 shows characteristic diffraction peaks that are identical to the body-centered cubic structure of Ag3PO4 [35].The XRD pattern of AgIO4 diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal structure of AgIO4 [36]. TheXRD results indicate that the well-crystallized Ag3PO4 and AgIO4 were successfully fabricated under experimental conditions. For Ag3PO4@AgIO4, theXRD patterns showed diffraction peaks corresponding to Ag3PO4 and AgIO4 crystal phases, proving that AgIO4 and Ag3PO4 are well coupled and that Ag3PO4@AgIO3 has been successfully synthesized. In the pattern of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, a smalldecrease is observed compared with Ag3PO4@AgIO4, suggesting that the combination of CNT-COOH does not affect the crystalline structure and phase composition of Ag3PO4@AgIO4; therefore, no apparent diffraction peak is observed for CNT-COOH in the XRD pattern of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4. This could be due to their relatively low percentage in the composites.Alternatively,the functionalization process maynarrow those peaks due to the loss of amorphous carbon, which is in good agreement with the previous reports [23,37]. The XRD patterns confirmed the fabrication of the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite.\n2.2. Characterization 2.2.1.

XRD Analysis\nThe phase purity and the crystal structure of AgIO4, Ag3PO4, Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composites are identified by XRD spectra, which are shown in Figure 2b. Pure Ag3PO4 shows characteristic diffraction peaks that are identical to the body-centered cubic structure of Ag3PO4 [35].The XRD pattern of AgIO4 diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal structure of AgIO4 [36]. TheXRD results indicate that the well-crystallized Ag3PO4 and AgIO4 were successfully fabricated under experimental conditions. For Ag3PO4@AgIO4, theXRD patterns showed diffraction peaks corresponding to Ag3PO4 and AgIO4 crystal phases, proving that AgIO4 and Ag3PO4 are well coupled and that Ag3PO4@AgIO3 has been successfully synthesized. In the pattern of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, a smalldecrease is observed compared with Ag3PO4@AgIO4, suggesting that the combination of CNT-COOH does not affect the crystalline structure and phase composition of Ag3PO4@AgIO4; therefore, no apparent diffraction peak is observed for CNT-COOH in the XRD pattern of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4. This could be due to their relatively low percentage in the composites.Alternatively, the functionalization process maynarrow those peaks due to the loss of amorphous carbon, which is in good agreement with the previous reports [23,37]. The XRD patterns confirmed the fabrication of the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite.\n2.2.3.

To investigate the efficient catalytic activity between different CTN-based composites, their photodegradation performance toward MB was carried out under natural sunlight. The carboxylatedCNT-based composite (CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4) exhibited higher activity than the non-carboxylated one (CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4), Figure 6a.This is because the surface electric properties of CNT-COO greatly increased the dispersity of the catalyst in the aqueous dye solution (Figure S2a Supporting Information), which increased the contact between the dye and the catalyst. Moreover, the adsorption of the positively charged dye on the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 increased due to the electrostatic attraction between the different charges (Figure S2b Supporting Information). Additionally, the electrostatic interaction between CNT-COO and Ag3PO4 significantly enhanced the charge transfer, which therefore decreasedthe recombination between the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. This is in good agreement with the EIS results. To investigate the optimal CNT-COOH amount on the synthesized composites, the photocatalyticperformanceofCNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-2.5%, CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5%, and CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-7.5% has been tested in relation tothe degradation of MB (Figure S3 Supporting Information). The results revealed that CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% exhibited the highest catalytic activity. When the content of CNT-COO increased to 7.5 mg, the degradation efficiency wasreduced. This may be due to the increasing amount of CNT-COO\u2212 shielding the surface of the photosensitive Ag3PO4 from the light, and the dye may have beenisolated from direct contact with the catalyst surface. A photocatalytic activity comparison study was carried out between CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% and its contents, Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and Ag3PO4 to further prove the photocatalytic efficiency of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5%. As seen in Figure 6b, in the absence of the photocatalyst and/or light irradiation, the dye degradation can be ignored. CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 exhibited the highest photodegradation of the dye, with nearly 100% of MB decomposingwithin 4 min,while the Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and the bare Ag3PO4 displayed degradation efficiencies of 70% and 40% within 4 min, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the excellent charge separation and transferring of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% composite."

As seen, CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% composite has predominantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for the degradation of MB with a degradation rate constant of 0.877min\u22121 compared to CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4,Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and Ag3PO4, which have a rate constant of 0.4143 min\u22121 0.3107 min\u22121 and 0.1611 min\u22121, respectively.\nTable 1.

The results revealed that CNT-COO\u2212/ Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% exhibited the highest catalytic activity. When the content of CNT-COO increased to 7.5 mg, the degradation efficiency wasreduced. This may be due to the increasing amount of CNT-COO\u2212 shielding the surface of the photosensitive Ag3PO4 from the light, and the dye may have beenisolated from direct contact with the catalyst surface. A photocatalytic activity comparison study was carried out between CNT-COO\u2212/ Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% and its contents, Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and Ag3PO4 to further prove the photocatalytic efficiency of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5%. As seen in Figure 6b, in the absence of the photocatalyst and/or light irradiation, the dye degradation can be ignored. CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 exhibited the highest photodegradation of the dye, with nearly 100% of MB decomposingwithin 4 min, while the Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and the bare Ag3PO4 displayed degradation efficiencies of 70% and 40% within 4 min, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the excellent charge separation and transferring of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4-5% composite.\n2.3.2. Simulta eous Degradation of Differe t Organic Dyes\nThe photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized composite toward the decomposition of a mixture of organic dyes was investigated under natural sunlight. MO and Rh B with a concentration of 0.01 g/L are used as representative dyes. As clearly seen in Figure S4 Supporting Information, nearly 90% of MO degraded within 2 min, while 60% of Rh B degraded at the same time. The results further confirm the enhanced catalytic\nactivity of the synthesized composite.\n2.3.3. Photocatalytic Reaction Kinetics\nThe kinetic behavior of the synthesized composite on the degradation of the organic dyes under light irradiation could be expressed as follows:\n\u2212ln(Ct/Co) = kt (1)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1586 7 of 14\nwhere k is the degradation rate constant, Co is the initial concentration of MB, and Ct is the concentration of the dye at the irradiation time of t.

All the chemicals were used as purchased without further treatment, except for CNT, which was first purified by refluxing in nitric acid.\n3.2.Preparation of Carboxylated CNT (CNT-COOH) For the preparation of CNTs-COOH, CNT was first purified by refluxing in diluted nitric acid for 4 h. It was then sonicated in a mixture of 1:3 (v/v) HNO3 (70%)/H2SO4 (98%) for 8 h at room temperature. Afterwards, it was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm and dried at 70 \u00b0C for 12 h.\n3.3.Synthesis of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 The CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite was synthesized viathe room-temperature chemical fabrication method. Typically, carboxylated CNT (CNT-COOH) wassonicated in water for 30 min to obtain a water dispersion of CNT-COOH. Then, 1.2 g/20 mL of AgNO3 was added to the CNT desperation, which was stirred for 4 h in dark conditions. Afterward, 0.8 g/20 mLof Na2HPO4 was added drop by drop. After 1 h of reaction, a solution of KIO4 (0.04 g/20 mL) was added in drops, and the reaction contents were kept inthe same conditions for another 1h. Then, the precipitate was collected viafiltration and dried at 60 \u00b0C for 12 h.\n3.4.Synthesis of CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 For the synthesis of CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4composite, non-carboxylated CNT was sonicated in water for 2 h to obtain a water dispersion of CNT. Then, 1.2 g/20 mLof AgNO3 was added to the CNTs\u2019 desperation under stirring for 4 h in dark conditions.\nFrom the above results, it isclear thatthe presence of CNT-COO\u2212 on the as-synthesized composite and the multi-electron\u2013hole species generated by Ag3PO4 and AgIO4 played a significant role in t e improvement of the p oto talytic activity of CNT-COO\u2212/ Ag3PO4@AgIO4. T e main photocatalytic reaction for the p oto egradation of the organic yes can be described by the following equ tions:\nPhotocatalyst + h\nand Ag3PO4 were observe at about 586, 455, and 543 nm, respectively. The light ab-\nsorption of Ag3PO4@AgIO4 was extended in the visible light region compared with that of\nof CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 was further extended to 586 nm with the introduction of the CNT-COO. This confirms that the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite strongly enhanced the absorption of the visible light of Ag3PO4 due to the good interfacial interface bet een CNT-COO\u2212 and Ag3PO4@AgIO4, which is beneficial to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The band gaps of the synthesized composites are determined by plotting the transformed Kubelka\u2013Munk function of light energy (\u03b1h\u028b)2 versus energy ( \u028b), (see Figure 4b). T e band gaps were estimated to be 2.05 eV, 2.23 eV, 2.4 eV, and 2.45 eV ttributed to CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and Ag3PO4@AgIO4, respectively.\nFigure 4.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy The electron\u2013hole recombination resistance and the charge transfer ability ofthe synthesized photocatalysts were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Figure 5, the diameters of the arc followed the order CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4<CNT-Ag3PO4@AgIO4< Ag3PO4@AgIO4< Ag3PO4. Therefore, it can be confirmed that CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 exhibited enhanced e\u2212/h+ separation and transferability at the catalyst\u2013electrolyte interface compared with the other composites. In addition, the good interaction between the CNT-COO and Ag3PO4 in the CNT-COO/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite further enhanced the electron transfer over the CNT-Ag3PO4@AgIO4, which was due to the interfacial bonding between the CNT-COO and Ag3PO4, which resultedin the higher photocatalytic activity of CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4.\nhV + eCB (2)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1586 10 of 14\nhVB+ + dyeCO2 + H2O+ intermediates (3)\nhVB+ + H2O\u2022OH + H+ (4)\nO2 + e CB- O2\u2022 (5)\nO2\u2212 + dye CO2 + H2O+ intermediates (6)\nAs explained in Figure 10b, after the photocatalyst is exposed to sunlight, the CNTCOO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite generates multi-electron/holes (Equation (2)). AgIO4 excites electrons to its CB, leaving holes in the VB;these electrons recombine with the holes generated by Ag3PO4 in the contact interface between the two semiconductors. The photoexcited electron on the CB of Ag3PO4 further migrates to the functionalized CNT. As a result, the holes concentrate in the VB of AgIO4 and the electrons concentrate on the functionalized CNT. Then, the h+ can directly interact with the dye (Equation (3)), and may also decompose water molecules into \u2022OH radicals (Equation (4)). Meanwhile, the electrons on the surface of CNT can be scavenged by the dissolved O2 to form superoxide radicals (O2\u2022\u2212) (Equation (5)). Finally, these photogenerated species can effectively degrade MB into CO2, H2O, and other intermediates (Equation (6)) [44\u201347]. As discussed above, it can be concluded that the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite should be attributed to the significant coeffects between the Ag3PO4@AgIO4 nanoparticle and CNT-COO. First, an Ag3PO4 particle with a narrower band gap (2.05 eV) and exceptional absorption in the visible and near UV regions qualifies the composite with a high capability for harvesting light. In addition, the more efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from excited Ag3PO4@AgIO4 to the dye molecules under light irradiation enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency. Second, the interlayer between Ag3PO4@AgIO4 and CNT-COO can prevent the recombination of thephotoexcited electron\u2013hole pairs. Third, the existence of H-bonds and the non-covalent intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 conjugation between the MB and the CNTCOO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 composite can significantly improve the adsorption of the dye molecules and provide increasing interfacial contact. Therefore, offering more active adsorption sites and photocatalytic reaction centers is beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance [48,49]."

            "text": "The study of the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalysts was carried out using the MB solution at room temperature under natural sunlight. Briefly, 25 mg of the prepared photocatalyst was mixed with 50 mLof MB (0.01 g/L) andthen sonicated for 10 min to establish adsorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. Afterward, the mixture was exposed to natural sunlight. During the illumination, 5 mLaliquots were collected at a given time interval andthen centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min) to remove the photocatalyst. The concentrations of MB solutions were determined by the UV-visible spectrophotometer at 664 nm. Additionally, the effect of light intensity on the photocatalytic activity was tested using a 350 W Xe lamp as a light source. The detection of the active species during the photocatalytic reaction was performed using p-benzoquinone (B.Q), disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetate (Na2-EDTA), and tert-butanol (t.B) as superoxide radical (\u2022O2), holes (h+) and hydroxide radical (\u2022OH) scavengers, respectively, followed by the photocatalytic activity test."

Compared with CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 exhibited enhanced optical and charge transfer properties. The optimal CNT-COOH content on CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 was investigated; the composite with 5 mg of CNT-COOH exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity.Moreover, CNT-COO\u2212/Ag3PO4@AgIO4 demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to that of CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4, Ag3PO4@AgIO4, and Ag3PO4 under natural sunlight irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the best light harvesting and inductionof electron\u2013hole pair separation and transfer. The results of this study provide important information for\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1586 12 of 14\nthe use of functionalized CNT-COOH in the field of photocatalysis. Furthermore, they present a new way to functionalize CNT usingdifferent functional groups, which may lead to further development in the field of photocatalysis. Moreover, this work could providea new way for using natural sunlight to facilitate the practical application of photocatalysts in environmental issues.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041586/s1, The following supporting information: Figure S1: SEM image of (a) nonpurifiedCNT, (b) purified CNT, (c) AgIO4, (d) CNT/Ag3PO4@AgIO4.
