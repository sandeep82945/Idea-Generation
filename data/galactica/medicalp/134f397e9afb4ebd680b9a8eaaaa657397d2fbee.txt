Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium meridionale are primary contaminants of barley, capable of producing several mycotoxins, mainly type B trichothecenes and zearalenone. Cold plasma decontamination has been gaining prominence, seeking to control the fungal and mycotoxin contamination of food and feed and to improve product quality. To reach this objective, the present study was divided into two parts. In the first part, F. meridionale and F. graminearum strains were exposed to gliding arc plasma jet (GAPJ). Cell viability tests showed the inactivation of F. meridionale after 15-min treatment, whereas F. graminearum showed to be resistant. In the second part, barley grains were treated by GAPJ for 10, 20, and 30 min, demonstrating a reduction of about 2 log CFU/g of the barleyâ€™s mycobiota, composed of yeasts, strains belonging to the F. graminearum species complex, Alternaria, and Aspergillus. A decrease in DON levels (up to 89%) was observed after exposure for 20 min. However, an increase in the toxin Deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (D3G) was observed in barley grains, indicating a conversion of DON to D3G. 1. conclusions Based on the results found in this study, GAPJ demonstrated potential for inactivating F. meridionale and F. graminearum for 15 min of exposure. Cell viability tests showed that the 15-min GAPJ treatment completely inactivated F. meridionale, whereas F. graminearum was resistant. Barley grains naturally contaminated by fungi and mycotoxins treated for 20 min with GAPJ showed a reduction of up to 2 log CFU/g for yeasts, Alternaria, and the FGSC. In addition, there was a reduction in DON levels of up to 89%, which can be considered a strategy for controlling DON in grains. However, an increase of D3G levels in the samples was observed, indicating potential conversion from DON to D3G.
