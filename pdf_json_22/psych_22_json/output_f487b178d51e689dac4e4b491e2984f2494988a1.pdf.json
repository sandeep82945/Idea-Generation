    "abstractText": "In the present work, we present normative data for a set of 39 original clipart-style images that can be used as material in studies involving judgements of proportion. The original images are drawings that depict different day-to-day scenarios (e.g., lighted windows in a building; books on a shelf) and each has seven variants of different proportions (from 20% to 80%) belonging to different categories (discrete vs continuous; social vs non-social; natural vs artificial; stimuli physical dimensions; number of referents). Normative data for these images are presented in an interactive database (available at https:// judgm entimagesandnorms. shiny apps. io/ estim ates_ inter active/), corresponding to the means of proportion estimates (in percentage form), the perceived ease of making such estimates, the perceived level of familiarity and liking for each image, and the relationships between these variables. In the paper, we analyse the data at an individual level, addressing how the latter judgements are related to the proportion estimates, how those estimates are related to objective proportions, and how these relationships are moderated by image category. The analyses presented in this paper aim to aid readers in selecting images that enable them to better address specific influences on proportional estimates or to control for those influences in their studies.",

Visual stimuli (consisting of quantifiable elements) have been widely used in research on magnitude processing, particularly proportion estimates, a fundamental process in the field of quantitative cognition (Beran & Parrish, 2016).\nProportional reasoning is studied using tasks that are based on the process of understanding a relationship (between quantities) as a simple quantity and being able to perform mental operations with it (Lamon, 2005). Researchers typically manipulate one of two dimensions: the number of elements of multiple types (i.e., discrete quantity), or the size of the parts/segments making up a\nsingle element, usually geometric shapes (i.e., continuous quantity). Examples of such tasks are those that employ visual delimited displays containing two types of elements varying in relative frequency, with participants being asked to estimate the proportion of one element type in comparison with the other type or to the whole set of elements. A variety of simple geometric elements have been used in these visual array tasks, such as coloured dots (Meert et\u00a0al., 2012; Philip, 1947; Stevens & Galanter, 1957; Varey et\u00a0al., 1990), squares (Shuford, 1961), rectangles (Spinillo & Bryant, 1999), spheres (Ginsburg & Rapoport, 1967; Jeong et\u00a0al., 2007), or vertical and horizontal lines (Shuford, 1961). Other tasks use continuous stimuli, whose quantities are processed analogously. Examples include scaling tasks, that require matching of a parcel of a target stimulus, which could be a subsegment of a length-line (i.e., number-line estimation task) or an area-shape (e.g., divided bars and pie charts), to its symbolic or non-symbolic proportional equivalent (e.g., Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014; Huttenlocher et\u00a0al., 1999; M\u00f6hring et\u00a0al., 2018), and the relative fullness tasks, that require the participant to estimate the percentage of liquid in a container, like water or coloured liquids in straight glass cylinders (e.g., Hollands & Dyre, 2000; * Teresa Garcia-Marques gmarques@ispa.pt\n1 ISPA - Instituto Universit\u00e1rio; William James Center for\u00a0Research, Rua Jardim do Tabaco, 34, 1149-041\u00a0Lisboa, Portugal\n1 3\nPearson, 1964; Piaget, 1967; Raghubir & Krishna, 1999; Yang & Raghubir, 2005).\nThese stimuli and tasks have been used in different types of research exploring the processes and features of proportional reasoning (Hollands & Dyre, 2000; Meert et\u00a0al., 2012), including studies concerning its relation to acquiring mathematical skills (e.g., Meert et\u00a0al., 2013; M\u00f6hring et\u00a0al., 2018), development of quantitative cognition in children (e.g., Boyer et\u00a0al., 2008; Jeong et\u00a0al., 2007), consumer behaviour (e.g., Attwood et\u00a0al., 2012; Chandon & Ordabayeva, 2009), and clinical deficits in neural processes (e.g., Hayashi et\u00a0al., 2013; Skagerlund et\u00a0al., 2016).\nStudies in the domain of proportional reasoning are typically carried out using materials built for the study in question. The specific physical features of those stimuli likely motivate differences in the psychophysical functions that establish the relationship between objective and subjective proportions (see claim by Hollands & Dyre, 2000; Spence, 1990; Zhang & Maloney, 2012). For instance, Boyer et\u00a0al. (2008) show that children\u2019s performance is worse when stimuli map discrete rather than continuous quantities. This stimulus variability is welcome, since it allows us to address relevant commonalities in the definition of a psychophysical function associated with proportion estimates (e.g., Hollands & Dyre, 2000). Nevertheless, the differences between studies have not been systematically addressed, and biases found in the description of processes may be amplified by the lack of variability of stimuli within studies themselves. In most cases, experimental stimuli consist only of simple geometric elements (e.g., arrays or parts of circles, squares, spheres, cylinders). More diverse stimuli, comprising different types of features, may allow researchers not only to understand the general mechanism underlying proportion estimates, but also to control features that can interfere with them and to identify different biases that can be promoted by such features.\nAlthough the preferential use of colour and geometric shapes as material allows for greater experimental control (see Smets et\u00a0al., 2015), these types of stimuli may also lack generalisation to our social world. Stimuli with social meaning, on the other hand, have the advantage of generalisation. Studies that examine the development of children\u2019s ability to reason about proportions frequently employ experimental paradigms relying on stimuli with social meaning, such as bricks (e.g., Spinillo & Bryant, 1999), marbles (Jeong et\u00a0al., 2007), drawings of pizza (e.g., Singer-Freeman & Goswami, 2001), pie slices (e.g., Spinillo & Bryant, 1991), chocolate pieces (e.g., Singer-Freeman & Goswami, 2001), or volumes of water and juice (e.g., Fujimura, 2001; Schwartz & Moore, 1998). In adults, the use of stimuli with social meaning has been restricted to consumer behaviour, such as beverages (wine, beer, and lemonade) in glasses or bottles (e.g., Attwood et\u00a0al., 2012; Troy et\u00a0al., 2018), food on plates (e.g., Kos\u012bte et\u00a0al., 2019; Wansink & van Ittersum, 2013), or\nsupermarket products in packages (e.g., Chandon & Ordabayeva, 2009; Li et\u00a0al., 2018). The use of stimuli with social meaning in these domains relates to the social nature of our cognition and the fact that most quantity estimations occur with this type of stimuli. Quantitative cognition, and proportion estimation research in particular, may be strengthened considerably by taking into account that proportion estimates are usually undertaken in a social environment. Specifically, having social environments depicted in stimuli, in which substantial control of the relevant features of the stimulus is still possible, would be an advantage to this field (see suggestion by Barth et\u00a0al., 2003, that research on human numerical competence must consider the influence of stimulus properties).\nIn line with this reading of the field, we found a need for a set of visual stimuli that could be made available to the research community, along with normative data associated with different dimensions, which could be easily used in different proportional reasoning studies, allowing for testing of new hypotheses as well as control of undesirable influences in a context that favours comparisons between studies. These normative data are most relevant when stimuli have a social meaning. Specifically, stimuli with social meaning are the most likely to differ in features able to modulate the cues that can be used to infer quantity (Fornaciai et\u00a0al., 2019), thus needing stronger experimental control.\nIn this paper, we present normative data for a set of clipartstyle social images that can be used as materials in studies involving judgements of proportion, offering the possibility to control for a set of dimensions. We specifically consider dimensions that were previously shown to influence subjective probability estimates, such as stimuli familiarity (e.g., Fox & Levav, 2000), liking (e.g., Bohner et\u00a0al., 1988; Zajonc, 1968), and response ease (e.g., Suantak et\u00a0al., 1996). We believe that this set of images will be useful for researchers, allowing them to study different dimensions of proportional reasoning with social stimuli, without having to compromise experimental control. The normative data presented in this paper can also be used in research focusing on the role of these features in the estimation process clarifying, for instance, how perceptual fluency and liking influence proportion estimates (e.g., Doi & Shinohara, 2016; Schwarz, 2004)."

These images correspond to proportions represented in different day-to-day scenarios (e.g., lighted windows in a building; books on a shelf), which vary systematically in different dimensions and proportion levels.\nAll the images define different social settings that may be used in a part-whole type of task, where researchers ask participants to estimate the proportion of one type of element\n1 3\n(e.g., lighted windows, green books on a shelf) relative to the total set of elements of various types (e.g., green and red books), or the part of an entity (e.g., volume of water in a bottle, or clouds covering the sky) relative to its total (e.g., the total volume of the bottle, or the whole sky).\nEach of the 39 images has seven different proportion level variants, where the proportions represented vary from 20% to 80%. The proportional judgements elicited are in percentage format, ranging from 0 to 100% (e.g., percentage of lighted windows in a building, green books on a shelf, water in a bottle, or clouds in the sky). Percentages are more consistently and quickly perceived by participants (see Goldstone, 1993), and provide uniform data for all images.\nDescriptive details regarding the data collected for each image are made accessible to readers via an online interactive database (available at https:// judgm ent- images- andnorms. shiny apps. io/ estim ates_ inter active/). Proportional normative data are presented in the interactive database for each of the seven variants of each image in the form of mean percentage estimates, as well as mean estimate bias associated with each image (i.e., the absolute difference between the estimates and the real proportions depicted in the images). In addition, we provide readers with data regarding the mean of the ease that participants felt while making the estimates, for each of the seven proportion-level variants of each image. The 39 images are further characterised by their perceived levels of familiarity and liking, corresponding to the means of all participants\u2019 evaluations for the 50% proportion level. Relationships between these judgements at the level of each image are also provided in the interactive database.\nIt should be further noted that the images were classified according to their different characteristics in order to consider the influence of different stimulus properties on proportion estimates (see Barth et\u00a0al., 2003). Specifically, this set of images varies in five categories, allowing for different manipulations within the same set of stimuli, besides varying in the proportion to be estimated. The images vary in the quantity type represented\u2014either continuous or discrete\u2014 and in terms of other stimulus characteristics: the presence of social elements\u2014social elements are either present or absent in the image; the nature of the stimulus\u2014either natural or artificial; the physical dimensions to be quantified\u2014 colour, shape, area, or number of elements; and the number of subsets of elements\u2014dichotomic (two types of elements) or multiple (more than two types).\nIn the results section of this paper, we provide readers with information at the individual level of analysis, clarifying how the individual\u2019s subjective proportion estimates related to objective estimates and the other judgements associated with the images, and also how these are likely to be qualified by the different image features described above. This should allow researchers to select materials knowing\nin advance that specific features of the stimuli are likely or unlikely to influence individuals\u2019 proportion estimates. The images may be used either for further testing those influences or for controlling for those influences when they are considered undesirable."

            "text": "Original visual stimuli for judgements of proportions were created in clipart style by the authors using Adobe Illustrator CS6 (Adobe Systems Incorporated: San Jose, CA).\nThe content of the images was developed using a focus group. The group\u2019s goal was to put together different ideas for scenarios in which an image may differ in part-whole proportions represented in area or volume, or in specific discrete entities. Images to be selected should provide high variability in scenarios and in different features (see below). An important aspect to be taken into account was that the stimuli should not appear bizarre in one or more of the part-whole proportions. Thirteen scenarios resulted from this process (see Fig.\u00a01 for examples). These scenarios were chosen following different criteria. The first criterion was that scenarios would have to allow for stimuli to vary in terms of either discrete quantity characteristics, based on multiple arrays of entities (i.e., proportion of elements; for instance, percentage of green marbles in a glass container) or continuous quantity characteristics, based on area or volume (i.e., fill proportion; for instance, percentage of dark fur on a pet).\n1 3\nSpecific criteria were established for the images representing the discrete part-whole proportion of elements. First, all images had to include a large number of total elements in order to avoid that participants would resort to counting rather than estimating percentages (participants tend to almost immediately quantify up to six items; Kaufman et\u00a0al., 1949). Furthermore, all the images designed had to depict non-symbolic quantities, without containing symbolical numerical elements, so that this dimension would not interfere with the judgements made. Discrete images have either two types of elements (e.g., percentage of lighted windows against dark windows) or four types of elements (e.g., percentage of yellow marbles against blue, green, and red marbles; see how this may affect quantity judgements in Pelham et\u00a0al., 1994).\nFor the images representing continuous part-whole proportions we ensure that the number of levels of the dimension was either unitary\u2014the target and its complementary (e.g., percentage of water in the bottle), or multiple\u2014the complementary area is a compound of multiple elements (e.g., percentage of clouds in the sky).\nThree different versions of each of the chosen scenarios were designed. More specifically, each version corresponded to a different exemplar of the setting, differing in general colours and stimuli disposition or type (e.g., for the percentage of fruit in a bowl scenario, three different pieces of fruit were used for each version).\nFor each of the 39 images, seven levels of part-whole proportion of fill or elements (depending on the stimuli\ncharacteristics) were created. The percentages depicted in the images varied from 20% to 80% in intervals of 10%. For the discrete stimuli images, the total number of elements was kept constant, with elements altered to result in the intended percentage of the stimuli. For the continuous stimuli images, we ran a script in Adobe Illustrator which allowed us to calculate the area of a selected vector object. The total area of fill was obtained through this method and the stimuli were altered to correspond to the intended percentage. In sum, a total of 273 original images of equal dimensions (189 \u00d7 189 cm) were created.\nAll images were drawn in the same clipart style\u2014 elements were derived from simple vector objects and shapes and manipulated using the Adobe Illustrator pen and selection tool, to produce simple images with little detail. Images are coloured, and mainly use tones of red, green, blue, and/or yellow, provided by the Adobe Illustrator colour guide. For some images, these are combined with neutral colours, such as elements of grey (e.g., marble container), brown (e.g., land area; skin), black (e.g., night sky), and white. Images generally contain a white background, except for those images which require an alternative background for emphasising the stimuli (e.g., cloud-covered sky, night sky for lighted windows). The choice of colours and minimalism design was so that the images resembled those we encounter in today\u2019s illustration and design industries, which we are exposed to every day.\nScenarios depicted in the images\nProportion\n20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80%\n1 3"

The order of image presentation was randomised and differed for each participant in each group.\nFirstly, participants either consented to participate voluntarily and entered the study or opted to abandon the study and were immediately redirected to the end of the survey.\nFor the first task, participants were asked to estimate the percentages (0 to 100%) of several visual items as spontaneously as possible. The images were displayed, one at a time, in the centre of the screen below the question \u201cWhat is the percentage of (stimuli)?\u201d (e.g., \u201cWhat is the percentage of yellow marbles?\u201d). Underneath the image, participants were presented with a text box with the instruction \u201cEstimate the percentage\u201d, where they were asked to provide a number from 0 to 100. On the same screen, they were also asked to rate how easy it was to give the estimation, using a seven-point scale from 1 = very hard to 7 = very easy. This was repeated for all 91 images of the group in random order.\nFollowing this task, participants rated the familiarity and liking of each of the 13 images that they had seen (only the 50% proportion levels of each image were shown), using two seven-point scales, 1 = unfamiliar to 7 = very familiar and 1 = dislike to 7 = like a lot, respectively. Participants were explicitly told that the images that they were rating for familiarity had all been presented in the previous task, in order to control for the influence of previous exposure on familiarity ratings1. Once again, the images were displayed one at a time, in the centre of the screen, in random order. On the same screen, both rating scales appeared below, underneath the question \u201chow familiar is this item?\u201d for the familiarity rating, and \u201chow much do you like this item?\u201d for the likeability rating.\nFinal demographic questions were then asked, and participants were thanked.

Normative scores were calculated for each image by directly averaging individuals' proportion estimates (0\u2013100) and ratings of estimation ease (1\u20137).\nAdditionally, the 273 stimuli were scored in terms of the bias associated with the individuals\u2019 proportion estimates (i.e., estimate bias). This score corresponded to the mean of the modulo of the value resulting from the subtraction of the estimated proportion provided by each participant from the objective proportion presented in the image.\nEach of the 39 images presented in this normative study was also scored in terms of two image features (perceived familiarity and liking). These scores were derived by averaging the ratings of familiarity (1\u20137) or liking (1\u20137), respectively, provided by individuals for the 50% level of proportion of each image version.\nAll image information and scores were compiled into an interactive database run as a web application (app).

The effect is moderated by the image random factor; it is less strong for some images than for others (see correlations in the interactive database), since the random factor moderates the slopes of those relationships, SD = 1.07; LRT: chi-square (2) =13, p = .002.\nEstimate and ease The estimates relate positively to the ease felt; slope \u00b1 SE = 3.80 \u00b1 0.28; t(39.2) = 13.6, p < .001, with higher estimates being felt as easier to make. The interaction\nwith the random image factor shows that this relationship is stronger for some images than others (see correlations in the interactive database), SD = 1.52; LRT: chi-square (2) = 85.3, p < .001.\nEstimate bias and judgements None of the judgements (i.e., perceived familiarity, liking, and ease) is related to the estimate bias (all ps > .12)."

            "text": "Each image was presented in seven different levels of proportions to be estimated. Here, we examine the relationship between these objective proportions and subjective proportions (i.e., estimates) within a mixed-model analysis, with the specific images as a random factor. We test for random effect intercept to determine whether some images lead to higher estimates than others. We test for two-way interaction with the random factor to understand whether some images are more prone to general response bias than others.\nResults show that estimates made by participants covary with the objective proportion presented in the image; slope \u00b1 SE = 0.97 \u00b1 0.03; t(39) = 35.20, p < .001, with the intercept of this relationship being near the 50% value4 (51.49; SE = 1.21; t(40.4) = 2.21, p = .035). The intercept of the random factor is significant; SD = 7.63; ICC = 0.226; LRT: chi-square (1) = 3878, p < .001, suggesting that some images promote higher estimates then others. We also found two-way interaction with the random factor, suggesting that the factor interferes with the slope of the relationship (SD = 0.168; LRT: chi-square (2) = 822, p < .001). This suggests that some images promote better estimates across all levels than others (see mean differences in estimate bias). Thus, future researchers should choose their images carefully as those that are more or less susceptible to general response bias and thus to objective proportion sensitivity. For instance, image PD1_50 is the image on the interactive database with the lowest mean value of estimate bias, with the mean values of estimate bias for each of the seven proportion variants of this scenario and image version ranging from 2.36 (PD1_50) to 8.49 (PD1_20). On the other hand, image PC3_50 has a mean estimate bias of 8.5, with the mean values of estimate bias for each of the seven proportion variants of this scenario and image version ranging from 6.43 (PC3_80) to 12.09 (PC3_60). Moreover, readers can look at the correlations between estimates and estimate bias (i.e., \u201cEstimateRBias\u201d), along with the respective p-values\n3 However, it should be taken into account that the LRT for variance parameters can be poorly estimated at times, which indicates that these p-values should be interpreted with caution (Baey et\u00a0al., 2019).\n4 The estimated mixed-model recoded objective proportions with 0 representing the 50% proportion level. Thus, this intercept corresponds to the standard 0 of a psychophysical function.\n1 3\n(EstimateRBias_p), which inform the reader about the slopes that operationalise how the degree of bias is dependent on the magnitude of the estimate. More specifically, these are either non-significant (i.e., a constant), positive (i.e., higher estimates are associated with higher bias), or negative (i.e., lower estimates are associated with lower bias). As an example, it can be seen in the interactive database that by selecting the image scenario \u201cPD\u201d and version \u201c1\u201d (PD1) for a future study, we would be selecting an image for which those who provide higher estimates also present less bias, which suggests that the bias promoted by the image is an underestimation. On the contrary, by selecting the image scenario \u201cBA\u201d and version \u201c3\u201d (BA3), we would be selecting an image for which the bias increases for higher estimates, which suggests that the bias promoted by the image is an overestimation."

            "text": "In this section, we analyse differences between image categories in terms of judgements and proportion estimates, and also how they modulate the previously studied relationships, adding them independently, as moderators, to the previously defined mixed models5. For this last analysis we also test for random second-order interaction effects (three-way interaction), to determine whether the category moderation effect was the same or different for all the images.\nThe categories analysed correspond to those described above: discrete versus continuous (type of quantity), depicting social elements or not\u2014presence versus absence (social elements), artificial versus natural (nature of stimuli), as being dichotomic or having more levels (total types of referents), and as either varying in amount, colour, or shape (for discrete stimuli), or varying in unitary area or multiple areas (for continuous stimuli) (stimuli dimensions).\nBelow, we summarise our analyses, firstly regarding (a) how each category influences judgements and estimates and (b) how each category moderates the relationships between judgements, and secondly, regarding (c) how each category influences the relationship between objective and subjective proportions (see Fig.\u00a02).\nType of quantity Discrete and continuous images do not differ in terms of familiarity but differ in terms of liking (continuous images are liked best: effect \u00b1 SE = \u22120.48 \u00b1 0.18; t(36.9) = \u22122.71, p = .010). Differences in estimation ease are also significant; effect \u00b1 SE = \u22120.230 \u00b1 0.13; t(270) = \u22123.90,\np < .001, suggesting that estimations are easier for continuous images. Discrete and continuous images differ in terms of the mean of proportion of estimates (estimates are lower for continuous images; effect \u00b1 SE = 6.50 \u00b1 2.55; t(270) = 2.55, p = .011) that they promote.\nFor all of the analyses presented above, the null effect of the image random factor suggests that this effect is similar for any pair of images of both categories.\nThe image discrete-continuous category only interferes with one of the relationships between judgements previously analysed: the relationship between familiarity and liking, slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.04; t(30.8) = \u22122.17, p = .038. Simple effects analysis shows that the relationship is stronger for the continuous material (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.15 \u00b1 0.03; t(36.9) = 5.58, p < .001) than the discrete material (slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.07 \u00b1 0.03; t(35.5) = 2.22, p = .033). The null second-order interaction component shows that this relationship is equal across all images.\nThe discrete-continuous factor also interferes with the relationship between objective and subjective proportions; slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.09 \u00b1 0.01; t(16124) = 8.12, p < .001. Simple effects analysis shows that both slopes are close to 1, but that the slope is lower for the continuous material (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.93 \u00b1 0.007) than for the discrete material (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.02 \u00b1 0.008). This suggests that an increase in the proportion levels reduces the sensitivity to objective proportions to a greater extent for the continuous images than for the discrete ones. This interaction is further moderated by the image random factor, suggesting that this pattern of differences may be dependent on the specific images selected; SDdiscrete = 0.119, SDcontinuous = 0.200; LRT: chisquare (5) = 826, p < .001 (see mean correlations in the interactive database).\nPresence of social elements Images with no social elements and images with social elements do not differ in terms of familiarity and ease. However, they differ in liking (effect \u00b1 SE = \u22120.478 \u00b1 0.01; t(39) = \u22122.22, p = .032), with individuals liking images with no social elements more than they liked images with social elements. A two-way interaction with the random factor, SD= 1.22; LRT: chi-square (2) = 7.97, p = .019, suggests that the effect is not the same for all images, possibly because there is greater variability in the means of liking for social images than non-social images (see correlations in the interactive database). Again, this variability allows researchers to select images that are equivalent with regard to liking in this category. There are no differences between images with no social elements and images with social elements regarding the proportion estimates made or estimate bias.\nRegarding the previously analysed relationships, this category moderates the relationship found between ease and estimate bias; slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.01; t(16002) = \u22122.49, 5 It should be noted that category moderation of the relationship between subjective and objective estimates is akin to differences regarding means in \u201cestimate bias\u201d (difference between the two estimates). Here, we report the effect with this analysis to test image random effects, over both slopes and intercepts.\n1 3\np < .013. Simple effects analysis shows that the slope is positive (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.01 \u00b1 0.01) for images with no social elements and the relationship is null (slope = 0, n.s.) for images with social elements. The interaction is further moderated by the image random factor (SDno social elements = 0.02, SDsocial elements = 0.01; LRT: chi-square (5) = 55.9 p < .001),\nsuggesting that this pattern of differences may be dependent on the specific images selected (see correlations in the interactive database).\nThis category further interferes with the relationship between objective and subjective proportions, slope \u00b1 SE = \u2212.208 \u00b1 0.01; t(16123.1) = \u221215.97,\n1 3\np < .001. Simple effects analysis shows that the slope is smaller (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.811 \u00b1 0.01) for images with social elements than for images with no social elements (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.020 \u00b1 0.006). More specifically, sensitivity to real proportions is lower for images with social elements than for images with no social elements. The interaction is moderated by the image random factor (SDno presence of social elements = 0.12, SDpresence of social elements = 0.20; LRT: chi-square (5) = 30.60 p < .001) calling attention to the fact that some images promote more bias than others (see means of bias estimate in the interactive database).\nNature of the stimuli This category did not promote differences in either liking, familiarity, or ease. We found differences in estimates associated with this category; effect \u00b1 SE = \u22127.08 \u00b1 2.31; t(22) = \u22123.06, p = .006. More specifically, participants overestimate natural stimuli and underestimate artificial stimuli. There was no interaction with the random effect, which indicates that this occurs equally for all images presented.\nRegarding the previously analysed relationships, this category moderates the relationship between ease and estimate bias; slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.01; t(16058) = \u22124.45, p < .001. Simple effects analysis shows that the slope is positive (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.01 \u00b1 0.01) for artificial stimuli and negative (slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.01) for natural stimuli. However, the three-way interaction with the random factor shows that this depends on the images considered, with the effect being stronger for some images than others (SDartificial= 0.02, SDnatural = 0.01; LRT: chi-square (5) = 49.2, p < .001; see correlations in the interactive database).\nNatural and artificial stimuli also moderate the relationship between subjective and objective proportions; slope \u00b1 SE = \u22120.139 \u00b1 0.01; t(16124.9) = \u221211.54, p < .001. Simple effects analysis shows that the slope is stronger positive (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.01 \u00b1 0.029) for artificial stimuli than (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.86 \u00b1 0.044) for natural stimuli. This suggests that artificial stimuli promote higher sensitivity to objective proportions than natural stimuli. The three-way interaction with the random factor is not significant, suggesting that this effect is generalised for all images.\nNumber of referents The number of referents did not impact ratings of familiarity nor ratings of liking. However, this category impacted ratings of ease (effect \u00b1 SE = \u22120.291 \u00b1 0.10; t(124) = \u22122.84, p = .005), suggesting that dichotomic images made the task easier in comparison with images with more referents. The random factor two-way interaction is reliable; SD = 0.896; LRT: chi-square (2) = 18.6, p < .001, and revealed that images with more referents can be perceived as either easy to estimate or difficult to estimate (see the interactive database), whereas dichotomic images are consistently reported to be easy to estimate (M = 4.26; SD = 0.28).\nThis category did not promote differences in subjective estimates.\nRegarding the previously analysed relationships, this category moderates the relationship between ease and estimates; slope \u00b1 SE = 1.40 \u00b1 0.248, t(7379) = 5.64, p < .001. Simple effects analysis shows that this relationship is weaker (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.86 \u00b1 0.181) for dichotomic stimuli than for stimuli with more referents (slope \u00b1 SE = 2.26 \u00b1 0.170). The three-way interaction shows that the differences promoted by the category are stronger for some sets of images than others; SDdichotomic = 1.09, SDmore referents = 1.37; LRT: chi-square (5) = 35.3, p < .001.\nThis category further moderates the relationship between ease and estimate; slope \u00b1 SE = 0.54 \u00b1 0.180, t(7485) = 3.73, p = .002. Simple effects analysis shows that this relationship is stronger (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.14 \u00b1 0.132) for dichotomic stimuli than for stimuli with more referents (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.69 \u00b1 0.123). This difference is stronger for some images than others (SD dichotomic = 0.59, SD more referents = 1.1; LRT: chi-square (5) = 40.5, p < .002), suggesting that, depending on the images, this difference may be more or less clear (see correlations in the interactive database).\nFinally, this category moderates the relationship between objective and subjective proportions; slope \u00b1 SE = 6.31 \u00b1 2.87; t(11.5) = 2.20, p = .049 . Simple effects analysis shows that the slope is higher (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.05 \u00b1 0.051) for dichotomic stimuli than for stimuli with more referents (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.98 \u00b1 0.051). This indicates that individuals are better at estimating proportions in dichotomic stimuli. This effect is stronger for some images than others; SD dichotomic = 0.04, SD more referents = 0.43; LRT: chi-square (5) = 22.6, p < .001, suggesting that differences promoted by the number of referents are more likely found with some images than others (see correlations in the interactive database).\nStimuli dimensions Stimuli dimensions promoted differences in familiarity and liking judgements. Specifically, these differences were found to be associated with the shape dimension (see Table\u00a02 and interactive database). Shape was perceived to be less familiar (F(4, 38.9) = 3.25, p = .021) and liked less (F(4, 38.9) = 12.5, p < .001) than other stimuli dimensions. Image as a random factor did not interfere with these effects Tables\u00a03, 4, 5 and 6.\nThis category moderates the relationship between ease and estimate, F(4, 7.23) = 18.8, p < .01. Specifically, this relationship is stronger for the colour dimension and weaker for the amount dimension (although still significant, p < .001). Furthermore, this category moderates the relationship between ease and estimate bias, (F(4, 1462) = 20.3, p <.010). Specifically, this relationship is stronger for the colour dimension and weaker for the multiple areas dimension\n1 3\n(although still significant, p < .001). Image as a random factor did not interfere significantly with these effects.\nFinally, this category moderates the relationship between objective and subjective proportions, F(4,\n16124.7) = 150.00, p < .001. Simple effects analysis clarifies that only the amount (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.055 \u00b1 0.01) and area (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.971 \u00b1 0.01) slopes are closer to 1. Slopes are lower than 1 for multiple areas (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.870 \u00b1 0.01), shape (slope \u00b1 SE = 0.637 \u00b1 0.02), and higher than 1 for colour (slope \u00b1 SE = 1.157 \u00b1 0.01). This suggests that researchers\n1 3\nmay choose the dimension to be estimated knowing which dimensions increase or decrease estimation correctness. The three-way interaction with the random factor was not significant, suggesting that image as a random factor did not interfere significantly with these effects."

            "text": "In this paper, we have presented normative data associated with a set of visual stimuli that depict social images and allow for judgements of proportion within a part-whole task. These stimuli were developed as an addition to traditional stimuli (mostly compositions of simple geometric elements) used in a broad range of research topics in proportional reasoning studies. The new material adds social relevance to those stimuli (or real-world correspondence), while at the same time providing the capacity to control for other dimensions that are here shown to be relevant for increasing or reducing the bias of estimates. It should be noted, however, that no comparisons were made in the present work between typical stimuli sets used in prior work, as our goal was first and foremost to provide normative data for these newly developed visual stimuli depicting social images. However, future research should take this aspect into consideration, as comparisons between new and traditionally employed stimuli could prove highly valuable in the advancement of the field.\nAll images under analysis in this paper are readily downloadable, and all information related to them is searchable within an online interactive database. We provide researchers with these materials to facilitate the advancement of research on this topic, since developing these kinds of materials can be time-consuming, even requiring specific skills.\nData available in the online interactive file enable a proper selection of materials for future studies. In selecting materials, researchers should take into account the analysis performed at the individual level in this paper. The category of the image may itself impact either the proportion estimates or their relationship with the objective proportions. Importantly, when the images, added to the analysis as a random factor, are shown to significantly interact with the impact of a category, it means that there is sufficient variability in the image set and that researchers may be able to find images that either strengthen or control the effect at stake. For instance, when data show that discrete and continuous stimuli differ in terms of the sensitivity to real proportions, but that image as a random factor qualifies this difference, researchers can find an image setting for which sensitivity to real proportions is equivalent for continuous and discrete images. For that, authors can rely on the analysis conducted at an individual level in this paper, and on\nthe correlation analysis at the image level provided in our interactive database.\nThe analyses conducted at an individual level are further informative in how individuals perceive an image (judgements of liking and familiarity) and the ease felt when proving a response, with the relationships between these variables differing depending on the category of the image. A specific category of images may also moderate the relationship between objective and subjective proportions, suggesting that individuals\u2019 sensitivity to the real proportions depends on the image category.\nResearchers should consider the fact that the images differ in how they are perceived, and that this perception is related to their estimates and/or estimate bias. Images differ in how much they are liked, and the level of liking is associated with the estimate bias. More specifically, images that are less liked are underestimated in their proportions, and images that are more liked are overestimated. Furthermore, images differ in terms of the ease felt by participants when providing estimates. This is relevant because there is a positive relationship between the values estimated and the perceived ease. This suggests that higher values are more easily estimated or that the estimation of higher values makes participants feel that the process is easier, or even that if individuals experience processing ease, they estimate higher values. Therefore, it seems that the way individuals perceive a stimulus, associated with how much they like the stimulus and how familiar they feel the stimulus to be, as well as the ease with which they made their estimates, is directly related to the magnitude of estimates. Social cognitive research suggests affect as a relevant modulator of subjective probability estimates (Bohner et\u00a0al., 1988; Fox & Levav, 2000; Suantak et\u00a0al., 1996). Since processing of familiar and perceptual fluent stimuli is charged with positive affect (e.g., GarciaMarques et\u00a0al., 2010, 2016), it is not surprising that our data directly demonstrate that these features interfere with the proportion estimation process. Considering that the goal of this paper is to provide stimuli for which relevant properties are previously known, when studying proportion reasoning, we do not draw conclusions about the presence of the effects, and neither explore nor offer possible explanations for them. However, we believe that this should be undertaken in future research.\nImportantly, this work showed that the relationship established between the subjective and objective proportion estimates was qualified by different types of materials, suggesting that individuals are less sensitive to real proportions when (a) these proportions change continuously rather than in a discrete way; (b) images do not have social elements (versus having social elements); (c) images represent natural (versus artificial) scenery; (d) the stimuli represented are dichotomic (versus multiple referents); and (e) images depict shapes, colour, and multiple areas\n1 3\n(versus other elements). This diversity of biases occurring with perceptual stimuli is likely to inform theories that aim to explain proportion estimation processes. The bias detected with our stimuli may have two different sources: either perception differs starkly from explicit expressions, or the numerosity perceptual context modulates perception itself. In the first case, bias occurs in the process of transforming perceptions into responses (see Shepard, 1984), and in the second, bias occurs in the perception of the quantity itself (e.g., Ebbinghaus illusions). An insight provided by the fact that there are differences in the levels of distortions promoted by the different categories is that perceptual mechanisms play a relevant role in promoting these biases. The data suggest that the characteristics of the images themselves create biases, and that these are not promoted exclusively by the process which transforms what is visually perceived into a cognitive response. This perceptual factor should thus be added to the list of factors that are already known to have an impact on the magnitude of systematic estimation errors, such as individual differences (e.g., overconfidence: see Moore & Healy, 2008) and contextual features (e.g., anchoring; see Furnham & Boo, 2011). While it is likely that the same type of bias occurs through different pathways, parsimony would challenge researchers to test the relationship between these different factors\u2014for example, testing whether individual differences or contextual factors are not themselves interfering with how we perceive reality.\nAlthough the material provided makes it easy for researchers to test their hypotheses, additional control procedures are still needed in specific studies. For example, although our study manipulates and measures many features of the images, there are other features, such as perceived visual complexity, that are also relevant in understanding proportion estimation processes (e.g., Madan et\u00a0al., 2018). Thus, authors may need to assess the degree of perceived complexity of the images that they select for their studies. In addition, it should be kept in mind that, in this normative study, the different images comprising different versions of the same scenario were assessed by different participants (i.e., a between-subjects comparison). Therefore, our data do not allow us to determine whether the scenarios are truly perceived similarly or, in other words, to report on the consistency levels of the evaluations provided to the different images of the same scenario (i.e., their reliability scores).\nExtending the\u00a0use of\u00a0this set of\u00a0images to\u00a0other magnitude estimation tasks\nThis set of images was addressed here in a part-whole task that requires the estimation of the proportion (in percentage) of a type of element relative to the total of the\nelements, or of a part of an entity relative to its entirety. However, the use of these stimuli can be extended to other proportion judgement tasks, such as scaling tasks, in which the participant is asked to match a target stimulus (composed of two elements with a given proportional relation) to its proportional equivalent (e.g., Barth et\u00a0al., 2003; Mix et\u00a0al., 1999; Meert et\u00a0al., 2012; Sophian, 2000). Tasks of matching non-symbolic fractions (e.g., Boyer et\u00a0al., 2008; Jacob & Nieder, 2009; Jeong et\u00a0al., 2007; Meert et\u00a0al., 2012) or spatial scaling tasks (e.g., Huttenlocher et\u00a0al., 1999; M\u00f6hring et\u00a0al., 2018) are some examples.\nWe further believe that the use of these images can also be extended to other magnitude tasks of the part-part ratio comparisons type, in which the quantity of an element is evaluated as a fraction of another (or its multiple), or of the ordinal comparisons type, which involve the comparison of the proportion of a stimulus relative to the proportion of others (B is smaller than/equal to/larger than A).\nAcknowledgements This research was supported and funded by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia under Grant PTDC/PSIGER/28850/2017 and Grant UIDB/04810/2020 awarded to Teresa Garcia-Marques"
