    "abstractText": "Proximity effect, which refers to the low-lying (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states with close energy levels, usually plays a negative role in the luminescent behaviors of heterocyclic luminogens. However, no systematic study attempts to reveal and manipulate proximity effect on luminescent properties. Here, we report a series of methylquinoxaline derivatives with different electron-donating groups, which show different photophysical properties and aggregationinduced emission behaviors. Experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal the gradually changedenergy levels anddifferent coupling effects of the closely related (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states, which intrinsically regulate proximity effect and aggregation-induced emission behaviors of these luminogens. With the intrinsic nature of heterocycle-containing compounds, they are utilized for sensors and information encryption with dynamic responses to acid/base stimuli. This work reveals both positive and negative impacts of proximity effect in heterocyclic aggregation-induced emission systems and provides a perspective to develop functional and responsive luminogens with aggregationinduced emission properties.",

            "text": "heterocycle-containing AIEgens\nJianyu Zhang 1,6, Yujie Tu1,6, Hanchen Shen1, JackyW. Y. Lam 1, Jianwei Sun 1, Haoke Zhang 2,3 & Ben Zhong Tang 1,4,5\nProximity effect, which refers to the low-lying (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states with close energy levels, usually plays a negative role in the luminescent behaviors of heterocyclic luminogens. However, no systematic study attempts to reveal and manipulate proximity effect on luminescent properties. Here, we report a series of methylquinoxaline derivatives with different electron-donating groups, which show different photophysical properties and aggregationinduced emission behaviors. Experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal the gradually changedenergy levels anddifferent coupling effects of the closely related (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states, which intrinsically regulate proximity effect and aggregation-induced emission behaviors of these luminogens. With the intrinsic nature of heterocycle-containing compounds, they are utilized for sensors and information encryption with dynamic responses to acid/base stimuli. This work reveals both positive and negative impacts of proximity effect in heterocyclic aggregation-induced emission systems and provides a perspective to develop functional and responsive luminogens with aggregationinduced emission properties.\nMaterials science drives the advancement of the world and matters, especially for the versatile types of organic luminescent materials (OLMs), which have been developed and widely applied to optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, biological imaging, chemical sensors, etc1\u20136. Based on the well-established theory of through-bond conjugation (TBC), molecular photophysics has been developed and utilized to design and construct OLMs by covalently connecting conjugated units and introducing electron donors and acceptors7\u201311. However, most of the traditional OLMs possess planar and rigid skeletons and suffer from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect in the aggregate and solid states because of the strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, hindering their practical applications as solid devices12\u201314. Fortunately, aggregation-induced emission (AIE), an opposite effect to ACQ, was coined, which referred to the phenomenon that luminogenswere strongly emissive in the aggregate state but nonemissive in their dilute solutions15\u201317. Unlike planar ACQmolecules, luminogens with AIE effect (AIEgens) show twisted or easily distorted conformation, and the restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM) is proven as themechanism forAIE effect18\u201321. The development and application of AIEgens have been a hotspot for OLMs during the past two decades, and many AIEgens are constructed using the star fragments of tetraphenylethene or triphenylamine as the fundamental units22\u201324. Many TBC-based strategies have been applied to manipulate the luminescent properties of these \u03c0-conjugated systems.

Hence, the design strategy and mechanistic understanding of the \u03c0-conjugated AIEgens are well-established and widely utilized for advanced applications.\nDue to the complex electronic structures of heteroatomparticipated compounds, many heteroatom-containing AIEgens from natural products or synthetic laboratories have attracted much attention in fabricating OLMs29\u201333. Meanwhile, the participation of heteroatoms and lone pairs brings some unique structures and properties that are absent in pure hydrocarbonicAIEgens, such as hydrogen bonds, excited-state intramolecular proton transfer, and roomtemperature phosphorescence34\u201337. Negligently but importantly, some compounds also show unique properties closely related to the (n,\u03c0*) transition introduced by heteroatoms, such as the proximity effect (PE). PE refers to the phenomenon that the energy level of the low-lying (n,\u03c0*) state is close to the lowest (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state in some nitrogen-heterocyclic and aromatic carbonyl compounds, which was first proposed by Edward C. Lim et al. in the 1970s38\u201341. The vibronic coupling of these two states usually leads to efficient internal conversion and nonradiative decay, resulting in the quenching of luminogens42\u201345. Hence, PE is traditionally regarded as a negative factor in constructingOLMs. Several studies have reported the solvent effect, temperature-dependent fluorescence, and substituent effect related to PE46\u201348. However, no systematic study attempts to reveal and manipulate the PEof heterocycle-containingAIEgens. It is believed that the combination of PE and RIM effect would build new theories to replenish AIE mechanisms and provide strategies to develop efficient AIEgens with unique features.\nHerein, a series of heterocycle-containing AIEgens with different electron-donatingunitsweredeveloped and synthesized to investigate the regulation of PE (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). All compounds were satisfactorily characterized, and their photophysical properties were systematically investigated (Supplementary Figs. 3\u201312). They all showed typical AIE properties but different trends of fluorescence variation towardwater additionduring the aggregation process, which was modulated by the response of PE and TICT to solvent environments. The theoretical analysis clearly illustrated the electronstructure change and different coupling effects of the low-lying (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states on their photophysical properties, suggesting both positive and negative impacts of PE. In addition, with the intrinsic nature of heteroatoms and PE, these compounds exhibited sensitive fluorescence responses to acid/base stimuli, which were rationally utilized for sensor and information encryption. This work realizes the regulationof PE in heterocyclic AIE systems andprovides a perspective to develop functional and responsive AIEgens."

            "text": "The photophysical properties of the heterocycle-containing core, 3- methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one (MQ), were first studied (Fig. 1). It showed amaximumabsorption peak (\u03bbabs) at 337 nmwith a shoulder at 355 nm in different solvents without a noticeable solvent effect (Supplementary Fig. 13a). The photoluminescence (PL) property was measured in THF/watermixtures by stepwise adding water. As shown in Fig. 1b, MQ was almost nonemissive in pure THF solution but gradually became emissive along with the increased water fractions (fw). At fw = 60%, the PL intensity (I) was 9-fold higher than that in pure THF solution (I0) (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, the maximum emission wavelength (\u03bbem) was redshifted from 393 nm to 410 nm. When fw \u2265 70%, nanoparticles with a size around 100 nmwere detected using the dynamic light scattering technique (Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting the formation of aggregates. At fw = 90%, the PL intensity was further enhanced to 13- fold higher than I0, and the \u03bbem showed a slight redshift. The absolute\nquantumyield (\u03a6) ofMQ in the crystalline state (2.1%)wasmuchhigher than the pure solution (0.1%) due to multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions and RIM effect, which was verified by its single-crystal structure (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16 and Supplementary Table 1). The above results clearly supported the AIE-active nature of MQ.\nSinceMQ is inherently an electron acceptor, the phenyl group as a weak electron donor is incorporated into MQ to construct (E)-3styrylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one (SQ) with a D\u2212A structure. Accordingly, its \u03bbabs was redshifted to 390 nm and displayed a weak solvent effect in different solvents (Supplementary Fig. 13b). The PL spectra of SQ also showed gradually enhanced intensity with the increased fw, but its PL intensity enhancement at fw = 90% (I90/I0 = 4) wasmuch smaller than MQ (I90/I0 = 13) (Fig. 1d, e). Besides, the \u03bbem exhibited an unobvious redshift (from 454 nm to 458 nm) when fw \u2264 70% and rapidly shifted to 475 nm at fw = 90%. The first stage-redshift was similar to that of MQ, but the second-stage dramatic redshift showed quite different properties with MQ, which might be ascribed to the intermolecular \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interactions in the closely packed aggregates, supported by its crystal packing and solid-state PL spectra with the same shoulder peak (Supplementary Figs. 15, 17). It is noteworthy that the redshifted \u03bbem was also observed in the crystalline MQ, although the redshift was absent in the aggregate state at fw = 90%. The above results suggested that the addition of a weak donor (phenyl ring) not only changed its physical properties (solubility, packing structure, etc.) but also significantly altered the electronic structures and photophysical properties reflected by the redshifted \u03bbem and weaker PL intensity enhancement.\nInspired by the above conclusion, the methoxy group and triphenylamine group with a stronger electron-donating ability were introduced to construct (E)-3-(4-methoxystyryl)quinoxalin-2(1H)-one (MeOSQ) and (E)-3-(4-(diphenylamino)styryl)quinoxalin-2(1H)-one (DPASQ), respectively (Fig. 2a). The \u03bbabs of MeOSQ and DPASQ further shifted bathochromically to 400 nm and 440 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13). Typically, the absorption spectra of DPASQ showed an obvious solvent effect without fine structures, indicating its strong charge transfer (CT) feature. Their PL spectra were investigated and compared in THF/watermixtures. Similar to SQ,MeOSQdisplayed enhanced PL intensity and redshifted \u03bbem with the increased fw, which could alsobe divided into two stages by fw = 60% (Fig. 2b, c). These two stages should be manipulated by the polarity of the solvent environment and aggregation effects, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 14). In the first stage, the \u03bbem showed a redshift from 463\u2013485 nm, and the PL intensity was enhanced only two times which was smaller than that of MQ and SQ. A dramatic redshift of \u03bbem (from 485\u2013533 nm) was also observed for MeOSQ in the second stage, which was caused by the intermolecular interactions as evidenced by its crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 18). As a result,MeOSQshoweda similarAIE effect (I90/I0 = 7) with SQ.\nDPASQ, serving as the strongest D\u2212A structure, exhibited a different trend of PL spectra (Fig. 2d). With the increase of fw, the PL intensity first decreased with redshifted \u03bbem, which should be attributed to the typical TICT effect (Fig. 2e)28,49,50. When fw > 60%, it showed typical AIE properties with enhanced intensity due to the formation of aggregates and RIM, although the PL intensity at fw = 90% was still lower than that in pure solution. Meanwhile, the blue-shifted \u03bbem should be ascribed to two reasons. The first one is the decreased polarity inside the formed aggregates51,52, and the other is the twisted conformationwhich is adverse to the intermolecular\u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction53. The fluorescent spectra and PL intensity change of DPASQ in MeOH/ water also supported its TICT and AIE features (Supplementary\nFig. 20). In addition, its crystalline samplewith close packing showed a bright yellow light with a \u03a6 of 10.2%, which was higher than the other three compounds (Supplementary Figs. 15, 19).\nA summary of the photophysical properties of these four AIEgens was drawn in Table 1. In the first stage, the PL properties were mainly\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3772 2\naffected by the solvent polarity. FromMQ to SQ, MeOSQ, and DPASQ, with the increase of electron-donating ability, the PL intensity enhancement was gradually weakened, and DPASQ even showed a decreased emission intensity. However, the redshifted \u03bbem was more obvious in the compounds with a strong donor. For the second stage of aggregation, all of these fourmolecules exhibited the AIE effect, but the change of \u03bbem and PL intensity was synergistically controlled by their aggregate structures and environmental polarity, resulting in complicated photophysical properties. In the crystalline state, they displayed varying \u03a6 (from 2.1% to 10.2%) but the same nature of fluorescence as suggested by their nanosecond lifetimes (Supplementary Fig. 21). According to previous reports, the photophysical properties of these four heterocycle-containing AIEgens in the first stage should be closely related to PE30,44,46. In other words, the PE is successfully regulated by altering the electron-donating group of AIEgens and solvent environment in this work. To further verify such a conclusion, the PL spectra of these four compounds were\n350 390 430 470 510 550 0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15 fw (vol %)\n90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 ytis net ni L P ( 10 5 sti n u . bra\n)\nWavelength (nm) 400 440 480 520 560 600 640\n0\n7\n14\n21\n28\nytis net ni L P (\n10 5\nsti n u . bra\n)\nWavelength (nm)\nfw (vol%) 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0\nfw = 0% fw = 90%\nb d\nc e\nfw = 0% fw = 90%\nMQ SQ\na\n0 30 60 90\n392\n397\n402\n407\n412\n417\n1\n4\n7\n10\n13\n) m n( ht g neleva W\nWater fraction (vol %)\nI/I 0\n0 30 60 90\n453\n459\n465\n471\n477\n1\n2\n3\n4\n) m n( ht g neleva W\nWater fraction (vol %)\nI/I 0\nFig. 1 | Photophysical properties ofMQ and SQ. a The chemical structures ofMQ and SQ. b Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of MQ in THF/water mixtures with different water fractions (fw).

From nonpolar hexane to polar methanol, the solvation effect was relatively weak in MQ and SQ which possessed no or a weak donor. However, in strong D\u2212A structures of MeOSQ and DPASQ, an obvious redshift of \u03bbem was observed with the increased solvent polarity. Especially, the \u03bbem of DPASQ shifted from 480\u2013600 nm (Fig. 3d). More importantly, four compounds showed different changes in PL intensity along with the increase of solvent polarity (Fig. 3e\u2013h, Supplementary Fig. 22 and Supplementary Table 2). MQ displayed monotonically increased PL intensity with a maximum I/Imin of 5, and SQ showed a similar\nenhancement with a smaller slope (the maximum I/Imin = 1.9). A similar phenomenon was also observed in some pyrene aldehyde systems56\u201358. However, the change is complex for MeOSQ without a clear trend. DPASQ even exhibited first increased and rapidly weakened PL intensity, suggesting its typical TICT effect that stabilized in polar solvents. In addition, although the tautomeric balance and monomer-dimer equilibrium of pyridines were well known, the same photophysical properties of methyl-substituted MQ (MeMQ) and unchanged 13C NMR spectra of MQ in different solvents strongly ruled out influence from these possibilities (Supplementary Figs. 23, 24)59\u201362. Therefore, the above results proved that PL properties in the first stage are mainly determined by the polarity and PE.\nTable 1 | Comparison of the photophysical properties for MQ, SQ, MeOSQ, and DPASQ toward water addition in THF/water mixturesa\nAIEgen The first stage (polarity) Thesecond stage (aggregation) fw (%) \u03bbem (nm) I/I0 fw (%) \u03bbem (nm) I/I0 MQ 0\u221270 393\u2212410 9 70\u221290 410\u2212413 13 SQ 0\u221270 454\u2212458 4 70\u221290 458\u2212475 4 MeOSQ 0\u221260 463\u2212485 2 60\u221290 485\u2212533 7 DPASQ 0\u221260 542\u2212592 0.1 60\u221290 592\u2212570 0.6 afw water fraction, \u03bbem maximum emission wavelength in THF/water mixtures, I/I0 relative PL intensity, I0 PL intensity at fw of 0%.\n430 480 530 580 630 680 0\n12\n24\n36\n48 fw (vol %)\n90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 ytis net ni L P ( 10 5 sti n u . bra\n)\nWavelength (nm) 480 520 560 600 640 680 720\n0\n8\n16\n24\n32\n40 fw (vol %)\n90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 yt is ne t ni L P ( 10 5 st i n u . b ra ) Wavelength (nm)\nMeOSQ DPASQ b d\na\n0 30 60 90 530\n550\n570\n590\n610\n630\n0.1\n0.4\n0.7\n1.0\n1.3\n1.6\n) m n ( h t g n ele va W\nWater fraction (vol %)\nI/ I 0\n0 30 60 90\n460\n480\n500\n520\n540\n1\n3\n5\n7\n) m n( ht g neleva W\nWater fraction (vol %)\nI/I 0\nfw = 0% fw = 90%\nc e\nfw = 60% fw = 90%\nFig. 2 | Photophysical properties of MeOSQ and DPASQ. a The chemical structures of MeOSQ and DPASQ. b Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of MeOSQ in THF/ water mixtures with different water fractions (fw).

            "text": "To investigate the mechanism behind the different photophysical properties of the four compounds, theoretical analysis based on timedependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) was first applied. Generally, in heteroatom-containing compounds, the (n,\u03c0*) state with small oscillator strength (f) is regarded as the nonradiative decay channel that may quench the emission. In contrast, the (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state with a large value of f is considered an emissive state (Supplementary\nFig. 25)63\u201366. Therefore, the adiabatic energy levels and corresponding hole-electron structures of the lowest-lying (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states in different solvents were calculated and analyzed for these four compounds based on their optimized ground- and excited-state geometries (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 3\u20136). The hole-electron analysis showed a distinct difference between the two kinds of electron transition. The heteroatoms of the methylquinoxaline unit mainly dominated the (n,\u03c0*) state with an f value close to zero, while \u03c0-conjugated donor and heterocyclic skeleton participated in the emissive (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state. The f value of (\u03c0,\u03c0*) transition gradually became larger with the increased polarity of solvents and the electron-donating ability of donors.\nForMQ, the energy level of the nonemissive (n,\u03c0*) state was lower than that of the emissive (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state. However, with the increase of solvent polarity, the energy levels of (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states were increased and decreased, respectively. As a result, the energy gap between these two states became smaller and almost the same in polar solvents (e.g., MeOH). Meanwhile, the gradually enhanced vibronic coupling of (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states induced the PE and boosted the radiative decay from (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state, which was the reason why MQ showed PL intensity enhancement. The decreased energy level of (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state also resulted in the redshift of the enhanced emission. Interestingly, according to previous work, this should be an antiKasha\u2019s emission from the higher excited state due to the thermal equilibrium between two coupled states and a much larger f value (>0.21) of (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state67\u201369. However, for SQ, the energy level of (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state was lower than (n,\u03c0*) state, which changed from a closely\ncoupled feature to the (\u03c0,\u03c0*) dominant lowest state with the increased solvent polarity. Although PE helped MQ boost the PL intensity, it rendered SQ a small enhancement of PL intensity because the bright (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state always showed a lower energy level than the (n,\u03c0*) state.\nFor MeOSQ and DPASQ with strong donor groups, the energy level of the bright (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state was always lower than their corresponding (n,\u03c0*) state in all solvents. The energy gaps between these two states became larger with the increased polarity, and the gap of DPASQ was bigger than MeOSQ in the same solvent. Due to the negligible PE on them, theoretically, these two compounds should exhibit a slight enhancement of PL intensity with the increased solvent polarity. However, apart from PE, it needs to be emphasized that TICT is also a dominant effect in strong D\u2212A systems with a rotatable bond, which always induces decreased PL intensity and redshifted \u03bbem with the increase of solvent polarity. Therefore, PE, TICT, and RIM work synergistically to affect the photophysical properties of MeOSQ and DPASQ in the solventmixtures, especially for DPASQ that showed a \u201cV\u201d shape of PL intensity variation anddramatically redshifted \u03bbemwith the increased water fraction (Fig. 2e)."

            "text": "Accordingly, an ideal model of regulating PE and photophysical properties in these heterocycle-containing AIE systems by introducing \u03c0\u2212conjugated donors was summarized (Fig. 5). From the methylquinoxaline core without a donor to three derivatives with donors and increased electron-donating ability, the energy levels of (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states gradually increased and decreased, respectively (Fig. 5a). Thereinto, the energy-level crossing of (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states occurred, and vibronic coupling and PE between these two stateswere firstly enhanced but further weakened. As a result, these four AIEgens exhibited different photophysical properties during the first stage of addingwater to the THF solution (Fig. 5b\u2013e): (1)When the nonemissive (n,\u03c0*) dominated the lowest-lying state, the addition of water would narrow the gap and enhance the vibronic coupling between (n,\u03c0*) and\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nI/I m\nin\nET N\nR2 = 0.809\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0.7\n1.0\n1.3\n1.6\n1.9\n2.2\nI/ I m\nin\nET N\nR2 = 0.820\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nI/I m\nin\nET N\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0\n6\n12\n18\n24\n30\nI /I m\nin\nET N\nR2 = 0.952 R2 = 0.798\na b c d\ne f g h\nMQ SQ MeOSQ\nDPASQ\n350 390 430 470 510 550\nytis net ni L P dezila mr o N\nWavelength (nm)\nhexane toluene dioxane THF DCM DMSO ACN MeOH\n390 430 470 510 550 590\nL P dezila mr o N\nytis net ni\nWavelength (nm)\nhexane toluene dioxane THF DCM DMSO ACN MeOH\n420 460 500 540 580 620\nL P dezila m r o N\nytis net\nn i\nWavelength (nm)\nhexane toluene dioxane THF DCM DMSO ACN MeOH\n460 500 540 580 620 660 700 740\nL P dezila mr o N\nytis net ni\nWavelength (nm)\nhexane toluene dioxane THF DCM DMSO ACN MeOH\nFig. 3 | Photoluminescence (PL) properties of MQ, SQ, MeOSQ, and DPASQ in different solvents. a\u2013d Normalized PL spectra of a MQ, b SQ, c MeOSQ, and dDPASQ in different solvents with increased polarity (n-hexane (hexane) < toluene < dioxane < tetrahydrofuran (THF) < dichloromethane (DCM) < dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) < acetonitrile (ACN) < methanol (MeOH)).

Accordingly, this phenomenon typically shown by MQ is termed the induction of proximity effect (IOPE), which indicates that PE is not always a negative influence as reported before. (2) Introducing a phenyl group resulted in the closely coupled two states of SQ. Therefore, the (\u03c0,\u03c0*) state became the dominant state, and the decoupling of the two close-lying states happened, resulting in the suppression of proximity effect (SOPE) and increased PL intensity (Fig. 5c). (3) Further increasing the electrondonating ability of the donor, a weak TICT effect was introduced into the system.Meanwhile, since the energy gap between (\u03c0,\u03c0*) and (n,\u03c0*) became larger, the strength of PE dramatically declined. Hence, these two opposite effects endow MeOSQ with a net effect of very weak intensity enhancement (Fig. 5d). (4)When the electron-donating ability of the \u03c0\u2212conjugated donor was further strengthened, the TICT effect was obvious, and the PE disappeared due to the very large energy gap. Accordingly, TICT became the key mechanism to influence photophysical properties, which endowed DPASQ with gradually decreased PL intensity and dramatically redshifted \u03bbem toward water addition (Fig. 5e). Nevertheless, in the second stage of adding water to the THF solution (fw \u2265 60 for MQ and SQ, and fw \u2265 70 for MeOSQ and DPASQ), four AIEgens displayed similar AIE phenomenon with gradually enhanced PL intensity after aggregation. The above mechanistic perspective suggests the successfulmanipulation of PE andphotophysical properties for heterocycle-containing AIE systems with close energy levels of (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states.\ntransfer.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3772 6"

            "text": "The intrinsic feature of heteroatoms always endows heterocyclecontaining compounds with responses to protonation, which could be utilized as chemical sensors for advanced applications. Therefore, taking MQ, MeOSQ, and DPASQ as examples, their dynamic responses to protonation were further investigated (Fig. 6a\u2013c). After adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) liquid into the MQ solution, a new redshifted absorption peak at 380 nm was gradually enhanced, which was supported by theoretical calculation (Supplementary Figs. 26a, 27a). Its PL intensity at 397 nm was first enhanced due to the increased polarity of the mixture and the resulting IOPE effect (Fig. 6a). Then, theoriginal emission peak dropped, and a newpeak at 500 nm increased. As a result, protonation gave rise to an enhanced and redshifted emission. In addition, the original absorption peaks of MeOSQ and DPASQ gradually decreased together with the rise of a new redshifted absorption peak (i.e., 518 nm for MeOSQ and 640 nm for DPASQ, respectively) due to nitrogen protonation of the methylquinoxaline core (Supplementary Figs. 26, 27). Although the absorption changes were quite similar, they displayed different PL properties. The fluorescence of MeOSQ was first raised and redshifted due to both the SOPE effect and enhanced CT of the protonated compound (Fig. 6b). However, as the protonation progressed, its fluorescence was redshifted but weakened because of the manifest self-absorption. Therefore, the protonation of MeOSQ brought about a redshifted emission with nonmonotonically changed intensity. In contrast, the original emission peak of DPASQ at 582 nm\ngradually decreased with the addition of TFA (Fig. 6c). The protonated DPASQH+ showed an enhanced TICT effect and a much lower transition possibility (f = 0.177) than DPASQ (f = 1.541), supporting its nonemissive nature and the declined PL intensity (Supplementary\nFig. 28). Besides, no protonation of the electron-donor unit or double protonated compound was observed due to the poor basic ability of triphenylamine (Supplementary Fig. 27c)70. As a result, the protonation of DPASQ produced a monotonically weakened emission, which was an opposite phenomenon to MQ.\nFor compounds that are responsive to acid stimuli, their preacidified forms are usually responsive to basic stimuli (e.g., NH3) as well. Taking DPASQ as an example, its protonation and deprotonation processes were continuously studied, indicating the nature of excellent reversibility and repeatability (Fig. 6d). Therefore, dynamic responses endow these compounds with smart sensors or information encryption applications. As a demonstration, a reusable test stripe based on MQ and DPASQ with different changes was fabricated to realize the above functions (Fig. 6e). Pattern transformations were obtained upon repeated NH3 and TFA exposure with the help of their opposite turn-on and turn-off modes.

Another mode with deprotonated compounds (MQ and DPASQ) displayed an angry face regarded as \u201cInformation II\u201d.

            "text": "PEplays an essential role in controlling the photophysical properties of heterocycle-containing compounds with close energy levels of the lowest (\u03c0,\u03c0*) and (n,\u03c0*) states, which is usually regarded as a nonradiative decay channel for luminescentmaterials. In this work, several heterocyclic methylquinoxaline derivatives with different electrondonating groups were synthesized to study the regulation of PE. All these compoundswere verified as luminogenswith AIE properties, but they exhibited different photophysical properties and AIE curves toward water addition during the aggregation process. The parent core of MQ without a donor showed (n,\u03c0*) dominant low-lying state and IOPE, while SQ with a weak donor displayed strong vibronic coupling between (n,\u03c0*) and (\u03c0,\u03c0*) states and SOPE during water addition. MeOSQ with a moderate electron donor showed (\u03c0,\u03c0*) dominant lowlying state and weak SOPE, but the opposite TICT effect dominated DPASQ due to its strongest electron donor. The theoretical analysis provided a mechanistic perspective on energy level change and PE regulation of these AIEgens, suggesting both the positive and negative impacts of PE for luminogens with different electronic states, which overturned our solidified recognition of PE. As a demonstration, these AIEgens were successfully applied as sensors with dynamic responses to acid/base stimuli based on the intrinsic nature of heterocycles and PE. This work provides a strategy to regulate the frequently ignored PE in the AIE community and also realizes the controllable molecular design of heterocyclic AIEgens for advanced applications with dynamic responses."

The excited-state geometries were\noptimized using the time-dependent DFT method at the same level of theory. To investigate the solvent effect on the energy level and electron transition of these compounds, the solvationmodel based on the density model of SMD and self-consistent reaction field was considered in the calculations. The adiabatic and vertical energy levels were summarized based on their optimized ground- and excited-state geometries. All the above calculations were carried out using Gaussian 16 program (Revision A.03). The frontier molecular orbitals were displayed using the IQmol molecular viewer package (Version 3.0.1)."
