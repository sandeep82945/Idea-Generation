While sharing emotions is known\nto enhance closeness, several questions remain underexplored. Specifically,\ndisclosing personal facts about oneself and disclosing emotions have\noften been studied together, making it difficult to determine the effects of\ndisclosing emotions per se. Moreover, not enough is known about factors that\nmay influence effects of disclosing emotions, including recipients\u2019 attitudes\ntoward emotion-sharing, the sharer\u2019s gender, and whether one considers\nthe disclosure to be\u00a0 similar to one\u2019s own experiences. We\u00a0 examined the\nimpact of disclosing positive and negative emotion on ratings of closeness,\nwarmth, competence, and leadership ability.\nMethods: 119 participants (95 female) in the United\u00a0 States were shown headshots of individuals who were introduced in the first person in\nwritten format. For half of the pictures, an autobiographical fact about the\nindividual\u2019s past was disclosed. For the other half, an autobiographical fact\nand an associated emotion were disclosed.\nResults: We\u00a0found that sharing both positive and negative emotions increased feelings of closeness above and beyond the effects of autobiographical\nsharing alone. Sharing positive emotions also increased ratings of warmth,\ncompetence, and leadership ability. Male and female sharers benefited\nequally from disclosing emotions and effects were largely robust to recipients\u2019\nattitudes toward emotional expression. Having something in common with\nthe disclosed fact or emotion further increased all ratings.\nConclusion: These findings indicate that disclosing emotions may improve interpersonal interactions, with potential management applications in business.\nKEYWORDS\nemotion, self-disclosure, vulnerability, connection, closeness, warmth, leadership, relationships\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 13 December 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.989826"

They also result in greater employee retention (De Clercq et\u00a0 al., 2020), perhaps by increasing commitment and motivation to stay (Basford and Offermann, 2012), by enhancing job and life satisfaction (Simon et\u00a0al., 2010; Fay and Kline, 2011), and by boosting the sense of fit between the employee and the organization (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2019). Professionals with good relationships are also likely to perform at higher levels than those who have poor work relationships, since they are more likely to seek help and co-worker support (Friedman et\u00a0al., 2018; De Clercq et\u00a0al., 2020), to be\u00a0creative (Zaitouni and Ouakouak, 2018), to take charge and innovate (Love and Dustin, 2014), and to surpass expectations (Kim et\u00a0al., 2019). They are also better able to resolve conflicts (Simons and Peterson, 2000) and feel safe to voice opinions and ideas (Stephens et\u00a0al., 2013). Understanding how to build positive relationships with others in the workplace is thus an important research priority (Sias and Cahill, 1998).\nOne important mechanism for enhancing closeness in the workplace is self-disclosure (Barasch, 2020; Rim\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2020). Self-disclosure can involve sharing personal details including factual statements (e.g., revealing one\u2019s favorite band) and emotion-related statements (e.g., joy experienced when first attending a concert of that band; Collins and Miller, 1994). When discussing self-disclosure, it is important to emphasize that it involves at least two people: the person sharing and the recipient of the disclosure (Collins and Miller, 1994). For decades, much research has been devoted to studying the impact of self-disclosure on relationships and perceived intimacy, often\u2013but not always\u2013 showing that self-disclosure can increase liking and closeness for both the person sharing and the recipient (Jourard, 1959; Cozby, 1973; Wheeless, 1976). Interpersonal exercises that involve systematic sharing of personal information by asking and answering a series of intimate questions with another person also increase closeness (Aron et\u00a0 al., 1997). Moreover, sharing biographical information with another person increases activation in brain regions associated with social processing and may lead to cross-brain synchrony (Ca\u00f1igueral et\u00a0al., 2021).\nSharing emotional experiences in particular may be\u00a0important for building closeness. People spontaneously seek out others to disclose both negative and positive experiences (Rim\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 1992; Pennebaker et\u00a0al., 2001). Doing so can serve multiple functions including strengthening social ties and eliciting support (Rim\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 1998; Rim\u00e9, 2009).\nNotwithstanding potential benefits (Stephens et\u00a0 al., 2013), there has long been a bias against disclosing emotions in the workplace. This reluctance may reflect traditional perceptions of emotions as weakness, and a deeply ingrained distinction between a more \u201crational\u201d work sphere and a private emotional sphere (Kark, 2011). This, of course, is a distinction that has increasingly\nbeen blurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which required individual\u2019s private and professional lives to interact in unprecedented ways (Galanti et\u00a0 al., 2021). Alongside this development, the business world has seen increasing appeals to greater vulnerability and authenticity in the workplace, particularly for leaders (Oc et\u00a0al., 2019; Couris, 2020; Ernst & Young LLP, 2021).\nDespite these trends, research has yet to disentangle the subtleties of different types of vulnerability in the workplace. Specifically, in previous research, the act of sharing autobiographical/personal facts about oneself and the specific act of sharing emotions were often studied together, making it difficult to determine the impact of sharing emotions per se (Pennebaker et\u00a0al., 2001). Moreover, not enough is known yet about how various factors may influence the effects of disclosing emotions, including recipients\u2019 attitudes toward emotional expression, the sharer\u2019s gender, and whether one considers the disclosure to be\u00a0similar to one\u2019s own life experiences. Although closeness is a desirable outcome in a professional setting because it can improve work relationships, people may also value how sharing emotions influences perceptions of warmth, competence, and leadership ability (Cuddy et\u00a0al., 2011). If sharing emotions increases the degree to which others feel close, but decreases perceptions of competence or leadership ability, people may forgo the benefits of emotional sharing in favor of being perceived as good at their job.\nGender may complicate the interactions between sharing emotions and workplace relationships (Lewis, 2000; Hess et\u00a0al., 2005; Hess, 2014). Social norms linked to traditional masculinity might lead men to refrain from sharing their emotions in fear of being seen as weak (M\u00f6ller-Leimk\u00fchler, 2002). Ironically, some evidence suggests that when men do share emotions, this is wellreceived, at least by women in a dating context (Collins and Read, 1990; Collins and Miller, 1994). Women, however, face their own dilemma arising from the stereotype of being overly emotional (Cuddy et\u00a0al., 2004; Bobbitt-Zeher, 2011; Budig et\u00a0al., 2016). Thus, it is conceivable that women are particularly at risk of harming their professional standing when disclosing emotions in the workplace.\nSituating our study in the field and theoretical framework\nWhen investigating the impact of emotion sharing, it is important to differentiate between emotional/physical expression, meaning the display of emotions through body language, facial expressions, or tone of voice (Lewis, 2000; Butler et\u00a0al., 2003; van Kleef, 2014), versus disclosing emotions verbally and factually (see framework in Figure\u00a01 and Lee and Wagner, 2002). Emotional expression typically occurs involuntarily and unconsciously, while verbal disclosure is often a deliberate act. That is, humans can become aware of their emotions and choose to verbally communicate them to a recipient (e.g., \u201cI am\u00a0sad.\u201d), even if the\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nemotion is not obviously perceptible in concurrent nonverbal cues like facial expressions (Fussell, 2014).\nA second consideration is that emotional expression, such as crying, concerns emotions that are currently being experienced (if the expression is genuine). Even if the emotion concerns a past event or involves reliving past emotions, the emotion still unfolds in the \u201chere and now.\u201d Verbal disclosure, by contrast, can also refer to emotions experienced in the past or the anticipated future (\u201cYesterday I\u00a0felt bad, but now I\u00a0feel better;\u201d \u201cI anticipate feeling joyful on my wedding day\u201d).\nVerbal disclosure of emotions allows people to communicate their inner states calmly, which has advantages\u2014such as peacefully solving interpersonal issues through dialog (e.g., saying \u201cI felt angry about\u2026,\u201d rather than attacking someone physically). Verbal expression of emotions has gained further importance in today\u2019s world because much of communication occurs in written format without witnessing concomitant physical expressions, such as when texting, writing emails, or communicating on social media (Derks et\u00a0 al., 2008; Rim\u00e9 et\u00a0 al., 2020). For these reasons, we\u00a0 specifically focused on the verbal, textual disclosure of emotions in our study.\nThe verbal expressions of emotions we\u00a0 used in our study concerned past events or circumstances rather than present emotions. Verbal expressions of present emotions are interesting in their own right, but they present additional complexity. Knowing that the sharer is experiencing an emotion right now may provoke\nbehavioral responses such as the desire to help or soothe (Christophe and Rim\u00e9, 1997). In the case of disclosing emotions about past events, the experience of the emotion itself has already occurred, although it may be\u00a0re-lived during the act of sharing (Pennebaker et\u00a0al., 2001). In the current study, we\u00a0therefore focused on verbally disclosing emotions about past events and circumstances."

We\u00a0also investigated potential side effects of sharing emotions on three other factors that are crucial in the interpersonal and professional context, namely perceptions of the sharer\u2019s warmth, competence, and leadership ability, as others have done previously (Zickfeld and Schubert, 2018; Kim and Read, 2021). Additionally, we\u00a0 considered the recipient\u2019s attitudes toward emotions and their personality, as well as the sharer\u2019s gender, and the valence of the emotion disclosed (positive vs. negative).\nSpecifically, we\u00a0studied the impact of an individual sharing an emotional experience in addition to an autobiographical fact (e.g., \u201cI often felt sad because my parents fought a lot when I\u00a0was a child\u201d) compared to sharing only the autobiographical fact without emotion (\u201cMy parents fought a lot when I\u00a0 was a child\u201d).\nFIGURE\u00a01 Theoretical Framework. Self-disclosure may involve disclosing emotions and/or personal facts about oneself. In the case of emotions, selfdisclosure may occur verbally (e.g., \u201cI feel angry\u201d) or through bodily expressions (e.g., shouting, subtle facial expressions). Personal facts (e.g., autobiographical information) are typically communicated verbally or can be\u00a0situationally expressed (e.g., through clothes or behavior). One can disclose emotions and personal facts with regards to the past (\u201cWhen we\u00a0won the basketball game, I\u00a0felt very happy\u201d), the present (\u201cWhen I\u00a0look at my to-do list, I\u00a0feel annoyed\u201d), or the future (\u201cI anticipate feeling wonderful when I\u2019ll get married\u201d). The processes of disclosing personal facts and disclosing emotions are often intermingled. For example, certain personal facts may appear to imply specific emotions (e.g., disclosing a loved one\u2019s death typically implies sadness). Nevertheless, reporting a personal fact or event is distinct from explicitly stating how that fact or event makes a person feel. Here, we\u00a0specifically study the effects of explicit, verbal (written) disclosure of emotions alongside personal facts, when compared to disclosing personal facts alone. The current study assesses self-disclosure of emotions and facts relating to the past rather than the present or the future.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nImportantly, the emotion stimulated by the same event, and thus shared with others, can differ greatly between people and may be\u00a0positive or negative (e.g., anxious, grateful). Our design allowed us to isolate the effects of positive and negative emotion sharing.\nThe specific type of self-disclosure studied here involved presentation of a photo of unfamiliar people alongside information about them displayed in written format. This procedure mimicked a common real-life context in which we\u00a0might read about others online (e.g., a resume, in profiles or blog posts on LinkedIn or other social media platforms). We\u00a0 pre-registered several hypotheses, which are shown in Table\u00a01. Our key hypothesis was that disclosing emotions will foster closeness more than disclosing personal facts alone. In addition, we\u00a0aimed to assess potential side effects of disclosing emotions on variables crucial to workplace interactions, namely perceived warmth, competence, and leadership ability."

Disclosing emotions about past personal events/\ncircumstances will foster closeness more than disclosing\nthe personal facts alone.a\n\u2022 Talking about emotional events increases liking and strengthens social bonds (Pennebaker et\u00a0al., 2001; Rim\u00e9\net\u00a0al., 2020).\n\u2022 Emotions are particularly personal experiences to disclose, because they are subjective states.\n2. This effect will be\u00a0diminished or reversed when the\nrecipient holds negative attitudes toward emotional\nexpression.a\n\u2022 A recipient with negative attitudes toward emotional expression may harbor judgmental feelings toward anyone\nwho discloses emotions (\u201cemotions as weakness\u201d; see Joseph et\u00a0al., 1994). This may worsen their opinion of\nthe sharer.\n3. Disclosing emotions will increase perceived warmth for\nboth women and men. It will decrease perceived\ncompetence in women while perceived competence will\nbe\u00a0unaffected in men. It will increase perceived\nleadership ability for men, but reduce it for women.b\n\u2022 Various gender differences concerning the effects of emotion disclosure have been documented (e.g., Hess et\u00a0al.,\n2005; Brescoll and Uhlmann, 2008; Fischer et\u00a0al., 2013; Hess, 2014).\n\u2022 Women\u2019s emotional expressions appear to sometimes lead to worse professional standing (e.g., Brescoll and\nUhlmann, 2008).\n4. Effects on closeness, warmth, competence, and\nleadership ability will differ between types of emotions\n(i.e., positive vs. negative valence). Competing hypotheses\n(Chamberlin, 1965):\na. Disclosing positive (> negative) emotions will lead to\nincreased ratings for all variables.\nb. Disclosing negative (> positive) emotions will lead to\nincreased ratings for all variables (see Yang, 2014; Yang\nand Kelly, 2016; Barasch, 2020).\nThese predictions were based on the following, opposing considerations:\na. Disclosing positive emotions does not typically involve confessing experiences that could be\u00a0perceived as a\nweakness and might reflect the sharer\u2019s positive outlook on life or resilience. These factors may lead to more\npositive effects of disclosing positive (> negative) emotions on all outcome variables.\nb. However, disclosing negative emotions may be\u00a0perceived as risky, due to the stigma often associated with\nthem (Businessolver, 2022). Therefore, recipients may feel particularly close to sharers who have the courage\nto disclose such emotions (Collins and Read, 1990; Collins and Miller, 1994), and they may also rate them\nas warmer, more competent, and more capable as leaders.\n5. Closeness will be\u00a0predicted by the extent to which the\nexpressed statements are similar to the rater\u2019s own\nexperiences and emotions.b\n\u2022 Having something in common with someone increases interpersonal liking (Tsui and O\u2019reilly, 1989; Carli et\u00a0al.,\n1991; Byrne, 1997; Devendorf and Highhouse, 2008).\n6. Recipients with high openness, low agreeableness, and\nlow neuroticism will show weaker links between\nsimilarity and closeness.b\nThese predictions were based on the following considerations (see John and Srivastava, 1999):\n\u2022 Open individuals may be\u00a0more accepting of others\u2019 experiences, even if different from oneself. This openness\nmay lead to feelings of closeness, even in the absence of similarity.\n\u2022 Individuals who are not agreeable may show lower feelings of closeness even if similarity is high, as someone\nwith low agreeableness is overall less likely to connect with others on an emotional level.\n\u2022 Individuals with low neuroticism may interpret others\u2019 experiences in a more positive way and be\u00a0less likely to\nfeel stress or anxiety from hearing about experiences different to their own. This positive outlook may lead them\nto feel closer to someone, even in the absence of similarity.\naWe also tested these predictions with regards to warmth, competence, and leadership ability (not explicitly pre-registered), to rule out negative effects of emotion disclosure on these variables that are crucial in the professional context. bFor completeness, analyses on gender and similarity were likewise carried out on all four variables: interpersonal closeness, warmth, competence, and leadership ability.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\npre-registered.2 We\u00a0 made small departures from our pre-registered analysis plan (namely substituting simple linear regressions for linear mixed-effects models) as this led to more accurate parameter estimates given the structure of the data."

Eleven participants indicated that they were Spanish, Hispanic, and/or Latino. Two-hundred participants signed up for the study, but only 164 actually took part when the link was sent out. Out of these, 32 were excluded due to failing at least one of the seven attention checks in the survey, and four could not be\u00a0 matched with the respective experimental data due to missing or faulty IDs. Nine further participants were excluded for taking <1 s on average to complete each of the ratings in the experiment itself (Wood et\u00a0al., 2017). All exclusion criteria were pre-registered. Initially, we\u00a0 had planned for a sample size of 150 based on a power calculation in GPower 3.1. The reason for the lower achieved sample size was that the number of no-shows and invalid data were higher than anticipated. Participants were recruited online via an invitation by the Wharton Behavioral Lab of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which has an existing database of research participants who take part in various experiments.

We\u00a0explained that they would see a series of 32 photos of human faces along with brief statements from each person. Participants were asked to form a first impression of each person and then evaluate four attributes. The four attributes were described as follows: \u201c1. Closeness (How close do you\u00a0feel to the person?), 2. Warmth (comprising traits like kindness, friendliness, trustworthiness, morality, sincerity, etc.,), 3. Competence (comprising efficacy, skill, creativity, confidence, intelligence, etc.,). 4. Leadership (ability to lead others in their field).\u201d The descriptions of warmth and competence were adapted from Cuddy et\u00a0al. (2008).\nWe also mentioned that, while it is difficult to make such detailed evaluations based on little information, participants should just report their first impressions without thinking too much. Moreover, to motivate participants to pay attention, they were told that we\u00a0would ask them a few simple questions afterwards on what they remember about the experiments. The respective picture and sentences were shown for 7 s in full-screen (Figure\u00a02B). Afterwards both the picture and sentences were shown in small format at the bottom part of the screen so that participants could refer back to them while giving their ratings. Responses on the closeness question were given on the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (IOS; Aron et\u00a0al., 1992). This pictorial scale consists of seven response options, each showing two circles labeled as \u2018Self \u2019 and \u2018Other\u2019, which vary in terms of overlap, from barely touching (1) to almost completely overlapping (7).

            "text": "We used mixed-effects models to analyze the data, predicting trial-level ratings (closeness, warmth, etc.,) from trial-level condition variables (e.g., Emotion vs. NoEmotion, gender of person sharing the emotion, etc.,) and participantlevel variables (e.g., positive v. negative emotion, personality, etc.,), treating trials, stimulus sentences, and stimulus images as nested within participants (i.e., as random effects). The benefits of this approach are that the data are retained in their original trial-by-trial format while the non-independence of data points per participant and specific sentence and image are taken into account, producing more accurate standard error estimates (Judd et\u00a0al., 2012).\nWe carried out the analysis using lmerTest 3.1.3 (Kuznetsova et\u00a0al., 2017) with the function lmer(), and created output tables and plots using sjPlot 2.8.1 (L\u00fcdecke, 2018) in R. While various models are conceivable, we\u00a0formulated our models based on our hypotheses. That is, we\u00a0only included variables and interaction terms that were relevant to the hypotheses. For example, we\u00a0 had predicted an interaction between three personality traits and similarity ratings per sentence but no interactions between personality and condition, emotion type or other variables. Therefore, the latter interaction terms were not included. This was done to avoid overly-complex, hard-to-interpret and overfitted models.3 Our data are available online should readers wish to analyze the data further. Whenever we\u00a0included interaction effects between variables, the corresponding main effects and lower-level interaction terms were also included to keep interaction effects interpretable. We\u00a0 also included random intercepts for participant, sentence, and stimulus image, but no random slopes as this led to convergence issues. Thus the model was formulated as follows:\n3 We did not include the race and gender of participants and their\ninteractions with the race and gender of the person disclosing the\ninformation. While interesting, such analysis would have been\nunderpowered, as there were not enough cases per subcategory (e.g.,\nPictures of White Female Individuals with an Emotion-statement, or male\nstudy participants overall).\nOutcome ~ Condition + Valence + Attitudes_Emotions +\nSharer_Gender + Similarity + Openness + Agreeableness +\nNeuroticism + Condition * Valence + Condition *\nAttitudes_Emotions + Condition * Sharer_Gender +\nSimilarity * Openness + Similarity * Agreeableness +\nSimilarity * Neuroticism + (1|Image) +\n(1|Sentence) + (1|Participant)\nAll variables were Z-scored before modeling. Outcome refers to Closeness, Warmth, Competence or Leadership Ability, modeled separately.\nFor visualization purposes only, we\u00a0 also calculated the difference in raw ratings between the Emotion and NoEmotion versions of each sentence per participant (Difference = Emotion \u2212 NoEmotion), and subsequently averaged these values across the 16 sentences per participant. The resulting mean difference scores per outcome variable and valence are shown in Figure\u00a03."

            "text": "Emotions and vulnerability are increasingly important topics in management and business (Ashkanasy and Dorris, 2017; Navas and Vijayakumar, 2018; Kock et\u00a0 al., 2019). This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Nielsen et\u00a0al., 2020), in\npart by diluting boundaries between professional and personal lives when working from home, and by growing recognition that employees\u2019 mental health is critical for attracting and retaining talent (Meissner et\u00a0al., 2020; Sull et\u00a0al., 2022). Employees who felt more connected with their co-workers during the pandemic were also two to three times more productive on collaborative tasks (Dahik et\u00a0 al., 2020). Our study, conducted in the midst of the pandemic, shows that explicitly sharing emotions (both positive and negative) about past events can have beneficial effects on interpersonal closeness. Sharing positive emotions specifically also increased perceived warmth, competence and leadership ability. Sharing negative emotions did not have any significant positive or negative effects on these factors (except for a positive trend for warmth). Our findings indicate that it may be\u00a0 both safe and beneficial to verbally disclose emotions about past events in a workplace context. Our study adds to the existing literature by specifically investigating the interpersonal impact of explicit, textual sharing of emotions above and beyond the sharing of personal facts or experiences alone, two factors that have often been intermingled in previous research (Barasch, 2020).\nFIGURE\u00a05 Values of All Outcome Variables as Predicted by Negative Attitudes Toward Emotions and Condition (Emotion vs. NoEmotion). Plot was created using the sjPlot package in R based on the reported model. Lines shown depict the predicted values, not data, to visualize the model. The other discrete predictors, not plotted here, were held constant at their proportions (not reference level). All values are Z-scored.\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nNotably, the impacts of sharing emotions\u2013in addition to personal facts--did not depend on the gender of the sharer. This was contrary to our predictions and to commonly held stereotypes about women and men in the workplace, as well as some previous research (Brescoll and Uhlmann, 2008; Fischer et\u00a0al., 2013). For example, Brescoll and Uhlmann (2008) showed that if women express anger in the workplace they are perceived as having lower status, while the same is not true for men (Hess et\u00a0al., 2005; Hess, 2014). Our findings offer promise that both women and men may reap the benefits of vulnerability in the workplace. However, it should be\u00a0noted that a large proportion of participants (77%, i.e., the recipients of the disclosures) in the current study identified as female. Future research should collect more data from male participants.\nWe also found that the impact of recipients\u2019 own attitudes toward emotional expression were negligible (Laghai and Joseph, 2000). Importantly, even if the recipient of the disclosure had excessively negative attitudes toward emotional expression, emotional sharing was not harmful. We\u00a0only found a very small effect for warmth, in that people with more negative attitudes toward emotional expression rated individuals as slightly less warm when they shared emotions (vs. no emotions). Thus, any negative effects were negligible and outweighed by the beneficial effects on participants with more positive attitudes.\nFinally, we\u00a0found that having something in common with an individual\u2019s disclosure significantly predicted closeness, warmth, competence, and leadership ability, which is in accord with prior findings (Carli et\u00a0al., 1991; Devendorf and Highhouse, 2008). The effect was particularly pronounced for closeness. In contrast to what we\u00a0predicted, personality did not modify this relationship, except for a very small effect for agreeableness: Agreeable participants showed slightly stronger effects of perceived similarity on warmth (not corrected for multiple comparisons), which is in line with our predictions. While the finding of similarity predicting closeness is not surprising, the finding of similarity predicting ratings of warmth, competence and leadership ability are more consequential. A bias for perceiving individuals with similar experiences as more professional may sometimes lead to the upholding of racist and sexist biases in the workplace, insofar these experiences are widely shared by individuals of a particular gender or from a specific ethnic group. Despite this potential danger, this finding invites the possibility of improving connections between ethnic and gender groups by disclosing personal and emotional experiences that are common to everyone.\nThe beneficial effects of expressing positive emotions on perceived competence and leadership are noteworthy. Harker and Keltner (2001) likewise found that the degree of positive emotional expression in women\u2019s college yearbook pictures was correlated with observer ratings of these women on several traits including competence. One possibility is that expressing positive emotions (e.g., gratitude) about personal experiences signals that one has the ability to learn and grow from hardship, and to discover the silver lining in difficult situations, which may signal competence and leadership potential (Spreitzer,\n2006; Gonzalez, 2010). Some of our positive sentences were indeed explicitly worded in a way that suggested resilience (e.g., \u2018I was happy even though I\u00a0had very few friends.\u2019). Fredrickson (2004) proposed the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, whereby positive emotions are theorized to help build resources and skills for the future. Wong et\u00a0 al. (2013) found that expressing positive emotions promotes goalattainment in workplace interactions, but only when expressed to superiors rather than colleagues. Moreover, the ways individuals respond to their romantic partners when discussing positive events is more predictive of well-being and breaking up\u00a02 month later than are their responses to negative events (Gable et\u00a0al., 2006).\nResearch on \u201cgeneral leader trait affect,\u201d rather than the verbal expression of specific emotions, has also revealed some benefits of positive over negative emotions for leadership. Joseph et\u00a0al. (2015) showed that positive leader affect predicts several leadership traits, including transformational leadership, and leadership effectiveness, whereas negative leader affect shows the inverse relationship (Gaddis et\u00a0 al., 2004). Leader affect can impact follower affect via emotional contagion and leaders who express positive emotions might also be\u00a0 perceived as charismatic (Johnson, 2008; Rajah et\u00a0al., 2011).\nOur findings can be\u00a0 applied to conflict mediation, teambuilding exercises, and leadership training. They may also be\u00a0 relevant in other contexts, for example in doctor\u2013patient interactions that depend on trust to work. We\u00a0note that disclosing emotions requires psychological safety and trust in the work environment (Frazier et\u00a0 al., 2017; Newman et\u00a0 al., 2017). By extension, it seems possible that disclosing emotions in a toxic work environment may be\u00a0harmful, although it is also conceivable that it may help to reduce toxicity by increasing compassion, trust, and connection. Notably, the ability to disclose emotions effectively is a skill that can be\u00a0 learned. A recent study by the Boston Consulting Group indicates that a 10-week mindfulness training fosters the ability to recognize and describe emotions, as well as the ability to non-judgmentally listen to others\u2019 experiences (Meissner et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "heading": "Limitations and future research",
            "text": "Our study has a number of limitations. First, as mentioned, our sample was primarily female, young, White and Asian. It is possible that individuals from other demographic groups react differently to emotion disclosure. For example, since men tend to talk about emotions less than women do (Pennebaker et\u00a0al., 2001; Brody et\u00a0al., 2016), it is conceivable that they will react to selfdisclosure less positively than did our largely female sample. Future studies should explore if our findings extend to other groups.\nSecond, the set-up might have been perceived as somewhat artificial and some participants might have guessed what the experiment was about. The use of standardized, artificial\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org\nnarratives and images mimicked the now common situation of learning about unfamiliar people by reading online professional networking sites or using resume sharing services like LinkedIn. Due to this design, our study may have limited generalizability to in-person interactions or to relationships with known individuals (e.g., colleagues). Concerning the risk of participants guessing the objectives of the study, it should be\u00a0noted that there were numerous factors in the experiment (e.g., gender and race of the sharer, complex sentences about the sharer\u2019s past). Therefore, it would have been difficult for participants to determine precisely our motives and interests, which somewhat mitigates concerns about demand characteristics. Participants were also blinded to the existence of the other emotion condition (i.e., participants randomly assigned to the positive emotion condition did not know about the existence of a negative emotion condition). Finally, even if a participant understood the purpose of the study that does not necessarily invalidate the results (e.g., someone commented: \u201cIt was interesting how the slight change in words in some of the sentences makes you\u00a0change your rating.\u201d). To increase ecological validity, future studies should conduct a similar experiment in real-life conditions and should include observable behavior as an outcome variable, in addition to self-reports.\nThe third limitation concerns the neutral expression of the person in the photographs while speaking about positive or negative emotions. This type of emotional incongruence or suppression is often viewed negatively (Butler et\u00a0 al., 2003). However, this approach permitted us to standardize the experiment, because\u2013unlike many previous studies\u2013we were not interested in the impact of emotional expression per se (e.g., breaking out into tears), but in the verbal disclosure of emotions. Moreover, since individuals were speaking about emotions they experienced in the past rather than the present, a neutral facial expression is still realistic.\nFourth, one may argue that the emotion-disclosure condition simply included a higher degree of self-disclosure, which could be\u00a0driving the effects (rather than emotion per se). We\u00a0attempted to keep the sentences matched in length compared to the NoEmotion condition, but this is still a valid concern. Future studies could address this issue by increasing the length of the NoEmotion condition sentences.\nFinally, we\u00a0 note that our study does not concern the experience or expression of emotions per se, but rather verbal information about emotions. Our findings are not directly translatable to the physical expression of emotions, because emotional expression (e.g., shouting when angry, crying when sad) might have very different effects on recipients compared to a factual statement about emotions. Our design also cannot distinguish effects of specific emotions (e.g., anger, sadness) but only concerns the valence of the reported emotions (positive vs. negative). It is highly plausible that effects also depend on the specific emotions experienced (Brans et\u00a0al., 2014). For example, research has shown that, for women, expressing anger results in being perceived as lower status, while this is not true for men\n(Brescoll and Uhlmann, 2008). These questions should be\u00a0 further addressed in future research. Given the beneficial effects of disclosing positive emotions on all outcomes in our study, it may be\u00a0particularly interesting to disentangle the effects of disclosing distinct positive sentiments (e.g., gratitude, joy, excitement, curiosity) on the way people are perceived and treated at work.\nFuture research should aim to uncover precisely when and where the expression of specific emotions is useful or harmful. In the \u201cnew normal\u201d of hybrid and remote work, it will be\u00a0crucial to find ways to connect with one another in meaningful and authentic ways. The current study focused on expressing emotions about past emotional experiences rather than current ones, which may be\u00a0an important distinction. Either way, the authenticity of the emotional expression likely matters (see Ceri-Booms, 2010; Crawford et\u00a0al., 2019; Oc et\u00a0al., 2019)."

            "text": "Our study was carried out in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which may have changed the importance and role of emotions and vulnerability in the workplace (Daraba et\u00a0al., 2021). Rates of anxiety, uncertainty, and loneliness were at or near record levels (Czeisler et\u00a0al., 2020; Usher et\u00a0al., 2020). Leaders who did not acknowledge and disclose these emotions may have been perceived to be\u00a0out-of-touch, possibly contributing to the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d (Sull et\u00a0 al., 2022). Moreover, the unprecedented shift to remote work led professionals\u2013even managers\u2013to show themselves in authentic and vulnerable settings when attending online meetings from their homes (Galanti et\u00a0al., 2021). The shared experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more acceptable for all of us to show our humanity, which includes communicating our emotional experiences. Our study shows that doing so increases interpersonal closeness above and beyond the effects of sharing personal facts alone, and that sharing positive emotions specifically increases perceptions of warmth, competence and leadership ability."
