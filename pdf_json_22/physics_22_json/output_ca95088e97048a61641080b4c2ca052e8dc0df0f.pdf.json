    "abstractText": "The search for the smallest quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplets in nature has motivated recent small collisions system programs at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Unambiguous identification of jet quenching due to final-state interactions is key to confirming quarkgluon plasma (QGP) formation in these reactions. We compute the nuclear modification factors RAA and Rp(d )A of charged hadrons and heavy flavor mesons in large (Au-Au, Xe-Xe, Pb-Pb) and small (d-Au, p-Pb, O-O) colliding systems, respectively. Our results include the Cronin effect and initial-state parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter. In the final state, hard partons undergo collisional energy loss and branching that was recently derived using soft-collinear-effective-theory with Glauber gluons (SCETG). In large colliding systems, mediummodified quantum chromodynamics evolution of the fragmentation functions dominates the nuclear correction. As the system size decreases, we find that cold nuclear matter effects, collisional energy loss, and QGP-induced radiations can become equally important. A systematic scan over the medium size and mass or flavor dependence of RAA provides the opportunity to separate these individual contributions and identify QGP signatures in small systems. Predictions for Rh AA, R D AA, R B AA in O-O collisions at \u221a s = 0.2 and 7 TeV are presented with and without the formation of a QGP and contrasted with the corresponding Rp(d )A calculations. Single-hadron measurements at RHIC and the LHC will not only test the O-O predictions for both light and heavy flavor production but also shed light on the possibly very different dynamics of p-A and A-A reactions at similar soft particle production multiplicities.",

Unambiguous identification of jet quenching due to final-state interactions is key to confirming quarkgluon plasma (QGP) formation in these reactions. We compute the nuclear modification factors RAA and Rp(d )A of charged hadrons and heavy flavor mesons in large (Au-Au, Xe-Xe, Pb-Pb) and small (d-Au, p-Pb, O-O) colliding systems, respectively. Our results include the Cronin effect and initial-state parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter. In the final state, hard partons undergo collisional energy loss and branching that was recently derived using soft-collinear-effective-theory with Glauber gluons (SCETG). In large colliding systems, mediummodified quantum chromodynamics evolution of the fragmentation functions dominates the nuclear correction. As the system size decreases, we find that cold nuclear matter effects, collisional energy loss, and QGP-induced radiations can become equally important. A systematic scan over the medium size and mass or flavor dependence of RAA provides the opportunity to separate these individual contributions and identify QGP signatures in small systems. Predictions for RhAA, R D AA, R B AA in O-O collisions at \u221a s = 0.2 and 7 TeV are presented with and without the formation of a QGP and contrasted with the corresponding Rp(d )A calculations. Single-hadron measurements at RHIC and the LHC will not only test the O-O predictions for both light and heavy flavor production but also shed light on the possibly very different dynamics of p-A and A-A reactions at similar soft particle production multiplicities.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevC.107.064903\nI. INTRODUCTION\nJet quenching is an unambiguous signature of quarkgluon plasma (QGP) formation in nuclear collisions and has played a central role in its discovery at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [1\u20135]. Hard partons created in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) scattering processes undergo multiple collisions with the constituents in the hot QGP medium [6\u201316]. The interactions further amplify QCD radiation, which was first studied in the soft gluon emission limit [17\u201325]. The development of effective theories of QCD that describe parton interactions in matter via the exchange of Glauber gluons [26\u201329] has enabled calculations of full in-medium splitting functions [28,30,31]. As a result, medium-modified QCD evolution and parton shower calculations [32\u201334] have successfully explained the large factor of 5\u201310 suppression in the nuclear modification factor RAA of hadron production in Au-Au and Pb-Pb collisions at the RHIC\n*weiyaoke@lanl.gov \u2020ivitev@lanl.gov\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

(1)\nHere \u3008TAB\u3009 is the centrality-averaged geometric overlap function of nuclei with mass numbers A and B. Such success has also already motivated the reverse-engineering of the detailed transport parameters of jets in the QGP [35\u201339] and to use the internal structure of jets to understand the microscopic QGP properties [40\u201343].\nRecently, puzzles have emerged in small colliding systems such as d-Au and p-Pb collisions. Similar \u201ccollective\u201d behavior in the pattern of soft particle production that is attributed to QGP evolution in large systems has been observed [44\u201349], suggesting the possibility of final-state effects. However, clear evidence of jet quenching has not been established [50\u201355]. This puzzle has led to intense discussion of the origin of the apparent collectivity [56\u201359] and the nature of the medium produced in small systems. Sensitive experiments have been designed to provide further insight into this problem, such as the geometry scan at RHIC using p-Au, d-Au, and 3He -Au [60\u201362], and the O-O collisions program at RHIC and LHC [63,64]. Theoretical predictions of jet quenching in O-O collisions already exist [65\u201368] for light and heavy-flavor quenching, using various frameworks, including transport equations and energy-loss calculations. In these studies, the QGP effects are modeled by medium-induced gluon radiation using either higher-twist [24] or the BDMPS-Z [17,18]\n2469-9985/2023/107(6)/064903(21) 064903-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nWEIYAO KE AND IVAN VITEV PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\napproach, and some studies also include collisional processes. Nevertheless, what is still missing from the theory side and the focus of this work is an analysis that combines QGP and full cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects to contrast results in p(d )-A and A-A reactions. This is an important step to establish the baseline without QGP formation and identify possibly different dynamics in symmetric versus asymmetric small systems. Then, we use in-medium QCD evolution formalism to consistently treat final-state parton shower effects for light and heavy flavor and understand the interplay with collisional energy loss.1\nThis paper aims to analyze the nuclear modification factors in various large and small systems. Calculations will be performed for light hadrons and heavy-flavor mesons, including both cold nuclear matter effects and hot QGP final-state effects, collisional energy loss and medium-induced radiation corrections to the baseline QCD factorization formalism. By fixing the jet-medium interaction parameter gs in large colliding systems, we will make predictions for light and heavy-flavor productions in d-Au, p-Pb, O-O, with and without the assumption of the existence of a QGP.\nThe motivation for this comprehensive analysis is threefold. First, although initial-state cold nuclear matter effects are overwhelmed by the QGP-induced modifications in large systems, they can be important in small systems and provide an alternative explanation of the structure of modifications without resorting to the existence of a QGP. Second, the radiative correction can be strongly reduced relative to the collisional effect in a QGP of decreasing size, as we demonstrate in this paper. Therefore, a complete treatment of hot medium effects has to include elastic collisions. Using the distinct mass dependence of radiative and collisional processes, the difference between light and heavy flavor modifications in small systems can provide a handle on the relative contribution of the two. Third, a notable source of uncertainty that has hindered theoretical analyses in small systems is the decorrelation of charged particle production, which defines centrality classes, and the average nuclear overlap function \u3008TpA\u3009. The large model-dependence in TpA complicates the interpretation of the present p-Pb modification data on hard probes. By looking into various collision geometries, especially light-ion collisions such as O-O, the normalization uncertainty is expected to be significantly reduced.\nFinally, we remark that hadrons are ideal diagnostics of QGP quenching effects and have provided the definitive evidence for strong final-state interactions and the transverse momentum dependence of parton energy loss [70,71] at both RHIC and LHC. Azimuthal asymmetries at high pT in A-A reactions are derivative signatures of jet quenching [72]. However, at small and intermediate transverse momenta in p-A and d-A, where we have data on hadron v2, they may originate from cold nuclear matter effects [56,73]. Jet production and substructure is a new probe of parton shower modification in\n1Medium-modified Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution has also been applied to understand the suppression of hadrons at the future Electron-Ion Collider [69].\nnuclear matter [74], but requires experimentally careful background subtraction. If strong suppression in the production rate of hard probes is unambiguously measured in small systems, jets could provide valuable complementary information on the QGP properties. For the purpose of first establishing jet quenching in p-Pb, d-Au, and small symmetric system like O-O, however, they offer no advantage over inclusive hadrons.\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we review the factorization calculation in nuclear collisions and discuss the initial-state and final-state effects that will be considered. The dynamical approach to evaluating cold nuclear matter effects is described in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we review in-medium QCD splitting functions obtained in SCETG, the modified QCD evolution for in-medium fragmentation function, and collisional energy loss in a thermal QGP. The model used to simulate the QGP medium is introduced in Sec. V. Results for RAA in large and small systems are presented in Sec. VI. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. VII. The data-constrained parameters for hydrodynamic simulations are described in Appendix A. Light and heavy-flavor hadron production in proton-proton collisions and their scale dependence are discussed in Appendix B. We comment on the differences between dynamically calculated CNM effects and the parametrized nuclear parton distribution functions in Appendix C."

Finally, coherent scatterings also lead to the dynamical shadowing effect that further shifts the xi by an amount proportional to the nuclear thickness function [78].

            "text": "Despite the complicated nature of parton interaction in the nuclear environment, it is possible to model the initial-state effect from QCD interactions. In Ref. [77], one considers multiple scattering (vertical gluons lines in the upper panel of Fig. 1) and induced soft gluon radiation (horizontal gluons lines in the upper panel of Fig. 1) from initial-state partons as they traverse in the nuclear matter before the hard interaction.\nCollisions shift particle spectra to slightly larger transverse momentum, resulting in an enhancement at pT around a few GeV, known as the Cronin effect [76]. The interaction potential between partons and the cold nuclear matter (CNM) is modeled by a screened Coulomb potential with typical transverse momentum transfer squared \u03bc2 = 0.12 GeV2 and mean-free paths \u03bbg = (CF /CA)\u03bbq = 1.5 fm. As mentioned earlier, we employ the Gaussian parametrization of the Cronin effect and account for the power-law tails of the Moliere multiple scattering with a numerical factor \u03be \u2248 few. The magnitude of the Cronin effect is sensitive to the shape of the particle spectra and decreases at large colliding energies [79]. For phenomenological applications we also consider 50% shorter mean-free paths to estimate its uncertainty.\nAt small transverse momenta and small values of Bjorkenx coherent multiple scattering also leads to dynamical shadowing [78,80], which we include in the calculation as a shift in the x variables. Coherent power corrections scale as \u03b4xi/xi \u223c \u03bc2A1/3/(\u2212u) and \u03b4x j/x j \u223c \u03bc2B1/3/(\u2212t ) in A-B reactions and t and u are the partonic Mandelstam variables for the hard scattering process.\nThe Cronin and dynamical shadowing effects disappear at high pT . On the contrary, induced gluon emissions that cause initial-state parton energy loss in CNM continue to be important at high energy [77,81]:\nx dNIS dxd2k = \u03b1sCR \u03c02 L\n\u03bbg\n\u222b \u03bcp+ 4\n0 d2q\n\u03bc2\n\u03c0 (q2 + \u03bc2)2\n\u00d7 \u23a1 \u23a3 q2\nk2(k \u2212 q)2 \u2212 2(q2 \u2212 q \u00b7 k) k2(k \u2212 q)2\nsin k 2L\nxp+\nk2L xp+\n\u23a4 \u23a6. (7)\nHere, x is the momentum fraction carried away by the radiated gluon. L is the path length that parton propagates in the cold nuclear matter before the hard collision. The same transversemomentum transfer squared \u03bc2 and mean-free path \u03bbg are used in equation (7) as those for the Cronin effect. The CNM energy loss also causes a shift in the momentum fraction x of the initial parton in equation (4):\nx\nx = fl \u222b 1 mN /p+ dx \u222b xmN |k| xp+ d2kx dNIS dxd2k , (8)\nwith mN the mass of the nucleon. At high energy, the CNM energy-loss contribution is approximately linearly proportional to L [79]. Therefore, for each collision centrality an averaged path length obtained from the TRENTo model\u2019s [82] simulation of the collision geometry have been used in equations (7) and (8). This introduces the centrality dependence of CNM effects, while path-length fluctuations at a given impact parameter are neglected. Furthermore, fluctuations due to multiple gluon emissions effectively reduce the mean fractional energy loss, which we account for with fl < 1. For steeply falling final-state spectra fl can be as small as 0.4 [83]. The energy dependence of the initial parton flux is much more moderate and we use fl = 0.7. For phenomenological applications, we also consider the scenario without initial-state energy loss.\n064903-3\nWEIYAO KE AND IVAN VITEV PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\nThe calculation that includes the Cronin effect, dynamical shadowing, and the CNM energy loss, hereafter referred to as the \u201cdynamical CNM calculation\u201d or \u201cCronin + eloss,\u201d will be used as the primary model for how the nuclear environment affects the initial parton density f (x, k). The advantage of the dynamical approach is that one can use only two parameters that control the magnitude of broadening and initial-state energy loss to systematically study the energy and A dependence predicted by QCD. In the large-x region, the current calculation only implements the isospin effect without parametrizing the antishadowing, EMC, and Fermi motion regions. We expect these effects to be small for the moderate-pT regions of hadron production considered in this paper.\nBy carefully selecting the colliding system, the measured final-state, the center-of-mass energy, and the kinematic region, we can enhance the sensitivity to individual CNM effects. In heavy ion collisions, however, they all can play a role in modifying the hadron and jet cross sections. To illustrate this, in Fig. 2 we compute the spectra of partons produced in the hard interaction in Au-Au collisions relative to the scaled p-p baseline at \u221a s = 200 GeV. The blue bands are dynamical model calculations with Cronin and dynamical shadowing effects only, and shaded bands are results that further include the CNM energy loss. The spread of the bands represents 50% variation in the magnitude of transverse momentum broadening. Scattering in nuclear matter introduces a nuclear size-dependent enhancement at moderate pT , while depleting particle production below 2 GeV. Dynamical shadowing also contributes to this low-pT suppression [78]. The CNM energy loss suppresses the spectra at large pT . The dynamical CNM calculations are compared with results using collinear nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) from the (n)NNPDF Collaboration [84] (black dash-dotted lines). There is no momentum broadening in the collinear nPDF.\nThe small low-pT suppression comes from the parametrized shadowing effect. At large pT , modifications results from the antishadowing, EMC, and the Fermi motion effects included in the nPDF. Unlike the dynamical CNM model, nNNPDF does not depend on the impact parameter, which is essential to include to study the centrality dependence of RAA and RpA in small colliding systems. Therefore, we primarily use the dynamical CNM model in this paper and will compare the impact of using nPDF to the final results in Appendix C."

The power counting parameter \u03bb = |k|/p+ can be thought of as the typical transverse momentum in the jet divided by its large light-cone component. In reactions with nuclei, the SCETG theory [26,27] was developed to couple the collinear fields to the background nuclear medium via Glauber gluon exchanges. Thus, hadron and jet production, and jet substructure can be described in different strongly interacting environments without loss of generality. This framework has been applied to study both the jet broadening [87] and derive the medium-modified QCD splitting functions [30,88].\nFor phenomenological application, the Glauber gluon field is often approximated by a sum of static-screened color potentials over the scattering centers in the medium\nV aR (q) = \u2211\ni\ng2s T a(R) \u2297 T a(i)\nq2 + m2D e\u2212iq\u00b7z\u2212i 1 2 q \u2212z+ .

(22)\nThe x dependence can be significantly modified compared with light flavors when k2 M2. The formulas for the medium corrections to equations (20)\u2013(22) have been derived in Ref. [28]. Although we will not write down the full in-medium expressions, we emphasize that the heavy quark mass not only introduces corrections to the propagators and the interference phases but also generates many new terms proportional to the squared quark mass.\nWe demonstrate the impact of mass corrections in the medium with numerical results, as shown in Fig. 3. The medium-correction to q \u2192 q + g and b \u2192 b + g splitting functions in 0%\u20135% central Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV and\nin 0%\u20135% O-O at 7 TeV are presented. We have factored out the vacuum-like Pqq and Pbb kernels given by equation (18) and equation (20). For the bottom quark, the vacuum splitting functions Pbb shows the so-called dead-cone effect that suppress radiations in the phase-space region x > |k|/M relative to Pqq. However, after factoring out the vacuum factor, the ratio still displays strong mass modifications [43]. Only ratios in the energy-loss region x \u2192 0 are comparable to that of the light quark.\nThe |k|-dependence calculated within kT,min = 0.2 GeV < k < xp+ is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3. Mediuminduced branchings are suppressed at large k by at least another power of 1/k2 as compared with the vacuum radiation. Meanwhile, the LPM interference factors in equations (11) and (12) suppress collinear splittings with \u03c9i z. As a result, medium-modified contributions acquires a typical transverse momentum that peaks above 1 GeV in this case, which makes the perturbative calculation of hadron quenching more reliable. The typical k is larger for the case of heavy quarks and for calculations in small systems as the typical z is smaller. In central Pb-Pb collisions, the correction at its peak can be much larger than the vacuum contribution. In central O-O collisions at 7 TeV, it is estimated to be about\n064903-6\nSEARCHING FOR QGP DROPLETS WITH HIGH-pT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\na factor of three smaller than in central Pb-Pb at 5 TeV, assuming QGP effects do exist in O-O."

This is a good approximation for the computation of radiative correction because a mismatch in p+ due to collisional energy losses is expected to be subleading in powers of \u03bb [89]. However, collisional energy loss should be taken into account to compute RAA at intermediate and small pT [10,15,90]. It was found that it can be comparable to the radiative energy loss for partons up to pT = 10 to 20 GeV. For heavy flavor particles, due to the reduced phase space for radiation when pT is only a few times the heavy quark mass M and the dead cone effect, collisional energy loss is even more important to describe heavy meson suppression at the intermediate pT . Finally, as we will see immediately, the different path length dependence of induced radiation and collisions energy dissipation makes the latter an indispensable component in the analysis of small collision systems.\nWe take the collisional energy loss obtained in hardthermal loop (HTL) calculations [7]. The energy loss of a quark per unit length in a weakly coupled thermal plasma is given by\ndEel d z = CF 4\n( 1 + Nf\n6\n) \u03b1s(ET )g 2 sT 2\n\u00d7 ln ( ET\nm2D\n)( 1\nv \u2212 1 \u2212 v 2 2v2 ln 1 + v 1 \u2212 v\n) , (23)\nwith v = p/E being the velocity of the parton in the rest frame of the QGP, applied to both heavy and light quarks. Gluon energy loss is related to that of the quark via the CA/CF quadratic Casimir ratio. The running coupling value at one loop is used in the above expression [90], where the maximum \u03b1s is cutoff at g2s/(4\u03c0 ). We remark that the running coupling effect cancels the ln(ET/m2D) enhancement from phase-space integration and results in an approximately energy-independent collisional energy loss.\nIn this study, we use averaged collisional energy loss, with hard parton production and z integration following the same distributions and trajectories as in obtaining the averaged in-medium splitting functions. We then apply the collisional energy loss to partons created in the hard process before invoking the in-medium splitting function modification of the fragmentation function. The justifications for this approximation are that (1) collisional energy loss is almost E -independent, and (2) a Eel mismatch will only cause a small difference in the QCD evolution so long as Eel Q."

(42)\nThe medium-induced correction to the splitting function does not introduce a ln Q2 dependence as strong as the vacuum one because it decays as 1/k4 or faster at large k2 and is screened by the Debye mass mD at small k2. In the low-Q2 region, the medium modifications become comparable to or can even dominate over the vacuum contribution. When this happens, one has to consider how to implement such corrections. For example, in Ref. [95], the authors only apply the modified DGLAP equation to the region Q > 1 GeV, and use the medium-modified QCD splitting function below 1 GeV to build an in-medium initial condition of the evolution. Other methods treat the low-Q2 region in a transport approach [96\u201399] where multiple medium-induced emissions are generated sequentially in a time-ordered fashion because the number of soft emissions is enhanced by the medium size. In our calculation, we notice that with the choice Q2 = k2/[x(1 \u2212 x)], Q2 is inversely proportional to the formation time of the branching \u03c4 f = p+/Q2. For soft emissions that do not significantly change p+, the Q2-ordered evolution is the same as a formation time ordered approach to compute radiative parton energy loss. However, they are not the same for energetic splittings that take a large fraction of the parton energy. We further remark that the QCD evolution approach can be applied to regions where the branching fraction x is large and regions where the medium correction is negative due to interference, which are beyond the scope of the transport equation. This may be important for small collisions systems, as the interference effects are very sensitive to a small path\n064903-8\nSEARCHING FOR QGP DROPLETS WITH HIGH-pT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\nlength. Therefore, we consider the QCD evolution approach to be a better choice for the system-size scan down to small collisions systems such as O-O and p-Pb. In addition, its predictions for light hadron quenching in large systems have been verified by experimental measurements [32,33].\nBoth the vacuum and in-medium evolution use vacuum fragmentation functions at Q0 = 0.4 GeV as the initial condition. The QCD evolution approach, similar to the traditional energy-loss approach, assumes that hadronization happens outside of the medium. However, for heavy mesons, the formation time can be significantly shortened by the large mass [100,101]. This may have additional phenomenological consequences and we will come back to this point in Sec. VI B.\nWe take the charged-pion fragmentation functions as extracted from global analysis in Ref. [102]. The fragmentation functions\u2019 initial conditions are parametrized at Q = 1 GeV, which is comparable to the typical kT of the mediummodifications. To incorporate all medium contributions, we first use the vacuum DGLAP to evolve these fragmentation functions down to Q = 0.4 GeV. They provide the common initial condition for evolution in the vacuum and the medium and we have verified that the vacuum results evolved back to Q = 1.0 GeV reproduce the original parametrization. Because the peaking contributions of the medium-induced splitting functions only come into play at perturbative values of kT (as shown in Fig. 3), so long as we focus on describing RAB at Q = pT 1 GeV, uncertainties introduced from running vacuum DGLAP evolution from Q0 = 0.4 to Q = 1 GeV will cancel against the initial condition that is obtained by evolving the fragmentation function from Q = 1 down to Q0 = 0.4. The choice of Q0 = 0.4 GeV is merely to be consistent with the nonperturbative cutoff that we introduced when tabulating the medium-induced contribution as given by equations (11) and (12), i.e., Q = {k2/[x(1 \u2212 x)]}1/2 > 2kT,min = 0.4 GeV.\nWe use the Lund-Bowler function [103] to parametrize the initial condition at Q = 0.4 GeV for the heavy quark fragmenting to a heavy meson (up to a normalization factor),\nD(z) = z\u22121\u2212bM2\u22a5 (1 \u2212 z)ae\u2212bM2\u22a5/z. (43) We have verified that with parameters a = 0.89, b = 3.3 GeV\u22122, and M2\u22a5 \u2248 M2c,b + (0.7 GeV)2,3 the evolved D(z, Q) provide a reasonable description to heavy-meson fragmentation measurements by the CLEO Collaboration [92] at Q = M\u03d2(4S)/2 and the ALEPH Collaboration [93,94] at Q = MZ/2. In Fig. 4, dashed lines are the Lund-Bowler initial conditions and blue lines are fragmentation functions evolved to Q = pT = Mz/2 for the ALEPH experiment and Q = pT = M\u03d2(4S)/2 for the CLEO experiment. Blue bands denote variation pT /2 < Q < 2pT . In this study, we set the initial condition for heavy mesons produced from gluon fragmentation to zero. The DGLAP evolution will generate finite perturbative g \u2192 D, B contributions at higher scale starting from order \u03b1s. However, it is shown in a global fit [105]\n3These values of a and b parameters are close to but slightly different from those used in Ref. [104].\nthat nonperturbative g \u2192 D, B fragmentation is small but not negligible, because it is enhanced by the large gluon production cross section in hadronic colliders at high energies. This can have phenomenological impact when we simultaneously study the nuclear modification factors of light and heavy flavors as we will comment in Sec. VI B.\nIn Fig. 5, we compare the fragmentation functions in p-p (blue solid lines) and in 0%\u20135% central Pb-Pb collisions (red dashed lines and bands) for six different fragmentation processes evolved from Q = Q0 to Q = pT = 50 GeV. The blue solid lines are the evolved results in the vacuum, and the red dashed lines with bands are results evolved in the medium with gs = 1.6, 1.8, 2.0. Compared with D(z) in the vacuum, medium-modified DGLAP evolution \u201credshifts\u201d D(z). In the calculation of inclusive hadron spectra, D(z) is always folded with a steeply falling partonic cross section. Thus, the spectra of both heavy and light hadrons are mostly sensitive to the behavior and modifications of D(z) near z = 1, even though the pion fragmentation functions (the top row) are much softer than those of heavy mesons (middle and bottom rows)."

The dynamical simulation of the quark-gluon plasma\n064903-9\nWEIYAO KE AND IVAN VITEV PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\nproduced in nuclear collisions is performed using the Duke HIC-EVENTGEN code package [106]. In this calculation, the TRENTo initial condition model of the collision geometry provides the energy deposition profiles at the proper time \u03c4 = 0+. The model of quark-gluon plasma dynamics consists of a pre-equilibrium stage modeled by free-streaming [107], followed by the 2 + 1D boost-invariant relativistic viscous hydrodynamics [108,109]. Finally, the hydrodynamic fields are particlized into hadrons at transition temperate Tsw slightly below the pseudocritical temperature of the QGP equation of state [110], and the hadronic interactions are handled by the ultrarelativistic-quantum-molecular-dynamics (UrQMD) code [111,112]. The model parameters have been tuned to the experimental measurement of particle production, flows, and correlations in previous studies [106].\nIn the current study, it will be very computationally intensive to obtain the full splitting functions and perform DGLAP evolution on an event-by-event basis. Therefore, we simulate events with centrality-averaged initial conditions. For this reason, the scale parameter (normalization) of the TRENTo energy deposition model is retuned for each system to reproduce the centrality-dependent charged particle yield and transverse energy. Because no data are available for nuclear collisions at 7 TeV, we interpolate the normalization tuned at\nRHIC and LHC energies using a third-degree polynomial in ln \u221a s to predict the normalization for O-O collisions at 7 TeV. The details can be found in Appendix A. Now, we discuss the existence of QGP effects in small systems. This may naively seem to be an unnecessary discussion, because the hydrodynamic simulations already provide the time evolution of the temperature profile. One can, in principle, use this to compare the medium temperature and the QGP pseudocritical temperature Tc to determine if the jet propagates in the QGP phase or in a hadronic phase. In fact, for those high-multiplicity events in small system collisions, the simulated medium temperature starts from a point well above Tc (see Appendix A). However, the definition of temperature in the hydrodynamics-based simulation bears certain ambiguity when the system is far from equilibrium, for example, in small colliding systems. On the other hand, in the hydrodynamic picture if it is indeed valid, energy density is converted into temperature using the lattice QCD EoS, which means that the number of scattering centers defined in this manner would approach the thermal limit. If the system is far from equilibrium, the density of scattering centers can significantly deviate from this expectation. In this study, we will therefore investigate two extreme limits of small colliding systems:\n(i) calculations with cold nuclear matter effect only; (ii) calculations with cold and hot medium effects that\nassume the QGP is described by the hydrodynamic model.\nWe let future experiments falsify either scenario."

With the same set of parameters, we then present predictions for RhAA, R D AA, and R B AA in d-Au, p-Pb, and O-O collisions. These calculations are performed with the dynamical cold nuclear matter effects. We discuss the impact of using the dynamical approach and the nuclear PDF in Appendix C. We also compare our baseline calculations in proton-proton collisions with experimental data in Appendix B.\nA. Interplay of cold (initial-state) and hot (final-state) medium effects\nIn Fig. 6, we sequentially include the contribution from Cronin effect and coherent power corrections, CNM energy loss, elastic and radiative effect in the QGP in central Pb-Pb, p-Pb and O-O collisions (columns). The coupling between the partons and the medium used in this demonstration is gs = 1.8. Rows from top to bottom show the modifications for charged hadrons, D mesons, and B mesons. The dotted lines include only Cronin momentum broadening and the peak for light hadrons is around 3 GeV. For heavier mesons, it moves to slightly higher pT . The inclusion of CNM energy loss (black\n064903-10\ndash-dotted lines) results in an overall suppression at high pT . CNM effects are much smaller in O-O collisions than those in Pb-Pb collisions, as expected from the A1/3 scaling.\nIn Pb-Pb collisions, the modified QCD splitting functions (calculations shown as blue dashed lines) lead to significant suppression of light hadron production. The further inclusion of collisional energy loss (solid blue lines) is a subleading effect in ln(E ). For heavy mesons, the radiative correction in the region pT < 5M is strongly suppressed, and the modifications are largely attributed to collisions energy loss. One should be careful, however, when interpreting the heavy-flavor results at pT M. In this region, the \u201cjet approximation\u201d E M completely breaks down, and the heavy quark\u2019s orientation can change randomly as it \u201cdiffuses\u201d in the QGP. The lowpT regime is better modeled by Langevin or other transport approaches that fully evolve the phase-space density of the heavy quark [113\u2013115]. In central p-Pb and O-O collisions, there is a notable change in the relative importance of radiative correction and collisional energy loss. This can be understood\nfrom the different medium-size scaling of the two processes as discussed in Sec. IV C. For heavy mesons in small systems, collisional processes are responsible for at least 50% of the QGP modifications."

For comparisons to b-decay electrons and nonprompt J/ , smearing functions extracted from Pythia8 [122] simulations are applied to the B meson spectra.\nFor light hadron suppression, the range 1.6 < gs < 1.8 provides a good description of the LHC data in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. At RHIC energy the data suggests a larger coupling 1.8 < gs < 2.0. This trend is consistent with many other findings that jet-medium interactions are stronger at lower temperatures relevant for collisions at the RHIC beam energy [36,123]. Our calculations for light mesons using modified fragmentation are only shown for pT > 5 GeV, below which other mechanisms such as hard-soft parton recombination become important [124].\nSwitching to the flavor or mass dependence of the suppression, the calculation agrees well with D-meson suppression at high transverse momentum but slightly overestimates RDAA\nat low pT . Data tend to lie on the lower edge of the band. The overestimation (not enough suppression) is evident for the bottom quarks. However, we are not going to tune a separate set of parameters for the heavy sector in this paper. Instead, tension with data is a useful indicator of physics that might be missing in the calculation. One improvement we can consider is the use of nonperturbative input to g \u2192 D, B fragmentation at Q = Q0, which then enhances gluon contributions at all Q scales [105]. Because the energy loss of the gluon is a factor of CA/CF larger than the quark, an enhanced gluon contribution brings down the inclusive heavy-meson RAA. Another possible explanation for the systematic deviation at low pT with increasing quark mass is the collisional dissociation of heavy mesons in the QGP [100,125]. In Sec. IV D, we argue that after the evolution the light parton fragmentation should take place outside of the QGP medium. However, the formation time of low-pT heavy mesons is considerably shorter so that they can be produced inside the nuclear medium. The calculation in Ref. [100] evaluated the collisional broadening and\n064903-12\nbreak-up of the D and B in the QGP that further suppresses RDAA below 10 GeV and R B AA below 30 GeV. This effect is not included in the present study. However, it should be much less important for calculations in small colliding systems to be discussed in Sec. VI C. Other works consider collisions between D and \u03c0, \u03c1 mesons in the hadronic phase [126,127], which is important in the low-pT region. In addition, Ref. [128] studied M/E -type drag-induced radiations of heavy quarks. These two additional effects qualitatively push the calculation in the right direction, but their overall magnitudes are too small to explain the large difference that we saw in bottom-flavor RAA."

            "text": "With the same range of parameters, we now turn to systematic predictions for small collision systems. At LHC energies there have been extensive measurements of jet production in p-A collisions. However, the interpretation of the results suffers from the ambiguity of the geometric model of nuclear collisions in the presence of large fluctuation. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 8 obtained using the TRENTo initial\ncondition model used in this study. From the left to the right panel, we plot the histograms of the self-normalized \u201cmultiplicity\u201d at the initial condition level versus the number of binary collisions (Ncoll \u2261 TAB\u03c3 inelpp ) for p-Pb, O-O, and PbPb collisions. In large colliding systems, there is a strong correlation between the nuclear geometry and the final-state multiplicity, and the determination of Ncoll or TAB that normalizes RAA is less sensitive to subnucleonic modeling and fluctuations. This relation strongly decorrelates in p-Pb collisions, making the determination of TAB extremely sensitive to proton shape, fluctuations, and particle production mechanisms. One of the motivations of O-O program is to partly recover the correlation between collision geometry and the multiplicity to provide unambiguous signatures of nuclear modification in small systems. Alternatively, one may consider self-normalized observables in small systems, such as the modification of photon-hadron correlations studied in Ref. [130], to remove the dependence on Ncoll.\nFirst, we study RpA in p-Pb collisions. In Fig. 9 we compare theoretical predictions with only CNM effects to the ATLAS data. In theoretical calculations, we always know\n064903-13\nthe correct normalization for RpA such that RpA = 1 in the absence of nuclear effects. On the experimental side, the published RpA data are strongly model-dependent: the ATLAS Collaboration obtains the normalization \u3008TpA\u3009 in the conventional Glauber model (left), and the improved Glauber-Gribov model with two choices of a parameter that controls the proton fluctuation (middle and right panels) [52]. Here we label them as ATLAS \u3008TpA\u3009 #1, #2, and #3. The resulting QpPb = dNpA\u2192h/\u3008TpA\u3009/d\u03c3pp\u2192h is shown to be extremely sensitive to the experimental choice of the nuclear geometry models.\nWhile the normalization of experimental results are uncertain, we argue that it is unlikely that medium corrections can truly cause 50% enhancement of hadron production at pT = 20 GeV as suggested by geometric model #1. We consider the geometric models #2 and #3 to be much more realistic from the point of view that RAA \u2248 1 at large pT . Focusing on scenarios #2 and #3, the cold nuclear matter calculation nicely explains the peak at low pT in the top 1% high-multiplicity events and its disappearance in 60%\u201390% p-Pb collisions, although small residual enhancement remains\n064903-14\nin peripheral collisions. Also, the peak in the data is at a slightly higher pT . This \u201ccentrality\u201d dependence comes from the nuclear-thickness (impact-parameter) dependence of the Cronin effect. Either calculations with or without CNM energy loss could be consistent with the current data in scenarios #2 and #3, although geometry #2 favors no CNM energy loss. We note that the cold nuclear matter energy loss used here can have an effect at much higher pT , and modify the production of jets in p-Pb and d-Au, as shown in Ref. [131]. The one used in this paper corresponds to the smaller of the magnitudes that were studied, as it was found to be more compatible with both RpA and RCP measurements. Such modification is further compatible with the suppression of high-pT hadrons [33] and important to quantitatively describe the suppression of jets at very high pT [132]. Clearly, a better understanding of nuclear geometry in p-A is needed to further constrain cold nuclear matter effects.\nDespite the large model-dependent uncertainty, there is little room left for the hot QGP effects in p-Pb in the current calculation. In Fig. 10, the calculations include both cold and hot nuclear effects. QGP effects introduce a strong centrality dependent suppression of RpPb at intermediate and large pT . This is not consistent with data in either scenario. However, we would like to emphasize that the temperature of the hot QGP in our simulations is determined by matching the initial condition to hydrodynamic equations using lattice EoS. This cannot exclude models of large nonequilibrium corrections to\nthe density of collision centers in small systems. The initial time for parton-medium interactions \u03c40 = 0.6 fm is taken to be the same for large to small colliding systems. It is possible for a medium of lower density created in smaller colliding systems to have a longer hydrodynamization times.\nFinally, we present our predictions for O-O collisions. In Fig. 11 we show calculations with only cold nuclear matter effect for O-O, p-Pb at the LHC energy and O-O, d-Au at the RHIC energy. Results including hot QGP effects are shown in Fig. 12. Both Figs. 11 and 12 are our predictions in small systems with the current understanding of CNM and QGP effects. If there is no QGP formed in small systems, the CNM effects are small in O-O collisions at both colliding energies. This is contrary to asymmetric collisions like p-Pb and d-Au, where the magnitude of CNM effects depends on the transport properties of cold nuclear matter and phenomenology can only be improved with a better understanding of centrality in p(d )-A. This further establishes that the O-O system is ideal to search for QGP effects. If a QGP is created in O-O collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, we estimate that hot medium effects can lead to almost 50% suppression of the charged-particle RAA at pT = 10 GeV in 0%\u201310% centrality class, while bottom mesons can be suppressed by 20% at pT = 20 GeV. At\u221a\ns = 200 GeV, the QGP effect in O-O is predicted to be much weaker from a limited lifetime of the fireball. There is about 20% suppression in charged particle RAA in central collisions and negligible effects for 30%\u201350% collisions.\n064903-15"

            "text": "In this paper, we investigated systematically the modification of light and heavy-flavor hadron production in small and large colliding systems at moderate and high pT . Our goal was to differentiate the impact of cold nuclear matter and hot QGP effects in the local thermal equilibrium limit. We performed the calculations by including medium-induced corrections into the QCD factorization framework for the more elementary p-p collisions. Cronin effect, coherent power corrections, and parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter modify the initial-state parton densities, while HTL-type collisional energy loss and medium-induced radiative correction change the hadron fragmentation function in the medium. A modified DGLAP evolution approach handles the scale evolution of the fragmentation function in the medium.\nWith jet-medium coupling gs = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2, the calculation results in a reasonable agreement with the light flavor suppression in A-A collisions at RHIC and LHC. This range can even accommodate the quenching of charm mesons, albeit with the largest of the studied couplings. However, the same range of gs underestimates the bottom meson suppression pointing to remaining tensions with the description of bottom quark dynamics even after the inclusion of collisional energy loss.\nIn small colliding systems we found that the CNM effects alone can already explain the basic patterns observed in p-Pb collisions scaled by the improved Glauber-Gribov model. Room for improvement in the description of such systems is still available, as with the CNM transport parameters used\nhere the magnitude of the Cronin enhancement and/or cold nuclear matter energy loss can be overestimated. One such improvement could be the inclusion of path length fluctuations for initial-state effects. To place tighter constraints on parton transport in large nuclei, a better understanding of centrality determination in p-A reactions will be greatly beneficial. In spite of the remaining uncertainties, we established that the current jet quenching calculation, where we employed a hydrodynamic description of the QGP with formation time \u03c40 = 0.6 fm in p-A and locally thermal distribution of quark and gluon quasiparticles, leads to quenching of hadron spectra that is inconsistent with the p-Pb data. This also implies that the contribution from parton energy loss to v2 in this small asymmetric system cannot be large. The same cannot be said for the d-Au data, where the QGP lifetime is significantly shorter and the measurement leaves room for final-state effects. This once again points to the importance of understanding the centrality determination in highly asymmetric small-on-large systems.\nIn O-O collisions at RHIC and LHC, we found that CNM effects alone only lead to very small corrections, while the formation of a QGP can suppress charged particle spectra by more than a factor of two at the LHC and by 20% at RHIC energy. Unlike the suppression in large systems that is dominated by induced radiation, collisional energy loss in O-O reactions results in modifications comparable to the effects of in-medium evolution. The predicted suppression in small systems at LHC energies with and without QGP formation is very distinct and can be easily tested with future measurements. We finally observed that if QGP quenching\n064903-16\nSEARCHING FOR QGP DROPLETS WITH HIGH-pT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\neffects are identified in O-O, the enhanced contribution from collisional processes can be tested by simultaneously looking at the flavor dependence of RAA."

We assume that only the normalization parameters change notably at different beam energy and fit them using a third-degree polynomial in ln \u221a s. The polynomials are constrained by fitting the normalization to the transverse energy (ET ) production and charged-particle (Nch) multiplicity in Au-Au collisions at 27, 62.4, 130, 200 GeV, Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, Xe-Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV, and p-Pb collisions at 5.02 and 8.16 TeV. The simulation is performed with centrality-classaveraged initial conditions, and the quality of the description of ET and Nch at various beam energies is shown in Fig. 13. The polynomial fitting using the extracted normalization factors at different beam energy is shown in Fig. 14, which results in a normalization at 7 TeV to be 19.6. The resulting multiplicity and transverse energy as functions of centrality in O-O is shown in the last panel of Fig. 13. In 0%\u201310% centrality collisions, dNch/d\u03b7 is estimated to reach 170. For 30%\u201340% mid-central collisions, dNch/d\u03b7 \u2248 58, which is similar to that in the top 1% high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions.\nThe centrality-dependent temperature profiles from the hydrodynamic simulations are used to obtain the event-averaged medium-modified splitting function, as described in Sec.

In Table II, we list the highest initial temperature reached in the hydrodynamic simulations in large and small systems.

All the experimental data have been converted into the double-differential crosssection d\u03c3/d pT /dy. We average the cross-section for D and B mesons over its particles and antiparticles but sum over all light hadrons. The perturbative calculation has leading order plus leading-logarithmic accuracy. For the comparisons to D and B meson, the fragmentation fraction f (c \u2192 D0) =\n0.549 [135] and f (b \u2192 B+) = 0.402 [136] are used. Note that we have included a next-to-leading order K factor K = 1.4 to compare the leading-order plus leading-logarithmic calculations to the data. In general, leading-order calculations have a large-scale uncertainty (the gray band, varying p2T /2 < Q2 < 2p2T ); nevertheless, the shape of the pT spectra is well reproduced, which is essential for the calculation of RAA. Furthermore, the scale uncertainty coming from the vacuum part of the evolution is largely canceled between the spectra in nuclear collisions and the proton-proton collision when computing the nuclear modification factor. This has been demonstrated in Fig. 16 that RAA almost stays unchanged with the same range of scale variation as the baseline calculations in Fig. 15."

Finally, we discuss how the signal of hot QGP effects will differ if one performs the calculation with nuclear PDF. In Fig. 17, RAA using dynamical CNM approach (blue dotted bands) are compared with nPDF calculation (gray bands) for Pb-Pb and O-O collisions. For light hadrons and charm mesons, the major differences appear at high pT , since the dynamical approach does not include modifications in the valence region. B-meson displays a surprising sensitivity to the CNM models at low pT . Again, these differences show up in the region where M/pT = O(1), which is not a well-controlled region in the current framework. Nevertheless, this difference suggests that when hot medium effects are suppressed by the large mass of b quark, it is possible to be used to probe the details of the CNM calculation.\n064903-18\nSEARCHING FOR QGP DROPLETS WITH HIGH-pT \u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 107, 064903 (2023)\n[1] D.
