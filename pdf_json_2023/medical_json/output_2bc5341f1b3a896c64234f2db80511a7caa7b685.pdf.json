    "abstractText": "Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal ageing and dementia. Most MCI patients will progress to dementia within 5 years; therefore, early intervention for MCI is important for delaying the occurrence and progression of dementia. Yi Shen Fang (YSF) granules are a promising traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment that shows great neuroprotective potential against cognitive impairment, as evidenced in clinical and basic studies. This trial aims to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of YSF granules in elderly people with MCI. Methods This study is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial. Based on the results of previous clinical trials, 280 elderly patients with MCI will be randomly divided into a treatment group (n = 140) and control group (n = 140). The study will last 33 weeks, including 1 week of screening, 8 weeks of intervention, and 24 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcomes will be the changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Memory and Executive Screening (MES) scores before and after the intervention. The secondary outcome measures will be homocysteine (HCY) levels, Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) scores and event-related potential (ERP) detection in typical cases. The TCM symptom scale is a combined measure of syndrome differentiation and treatment. During this study, the classifications and characteristics of adverse events, the times of occurrence and disappearance, the measures of treatment, their impact on the primary disease, and outcomes will be reported truthfully. Discussion This study will provide valuable clinical evidence that YSF can help to improve the cognitive function of elderly people with MCI, and the results will be disseminated via conferences and publications.

            "text": "Chinese people aged 60 and older numbered 264.02 million, or 18.7% of the total population, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China in the 2020 census. As the Chinese population ages and ageing-associated diseases increase at a rapid rate, the prevalence of dementia among individuals aged 60\u00a0years and older was found to be 6.0%, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was estimated in 15.5% of individuals of this age group in China [1]. MCI refers to a cognitive decline that does not impair cognitive function significantly, which is generally referred to as a transition state between normal cognition and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [2], and compared with normal cognition, MCI is more likely to develop into Alzheimer\u2019s disease [3]. Undoubtedly, cognitive impairment is an extremely serious problem, and effective therapy should be administered before the disease worsens. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are commonly used for treating MCI, with very little evidence showing that they can prevent the progression from MCI to dementia. The efficacy of ChEI treatment for MCI remains controversial [4\u20136]. Thus, novel strategies and prevention methods need to be explored for MCI treatment. We hope that TCM can produce positive effects on clinical treatment, increasing patients\u2019 confidence in the use of Chinese herbs, which can further enhance the efficiency of prevention and treatment.\nIn recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine has a potential multitarget therapeutic effect on early MCI and exerts neuroprotective effects, showing certain application prospects [7\u201311]. Yi Shen Fang (YSF) granules are traditional Chinese herbal compounds that have been commonly used in MCI treatment in our specialist outpatient clinic. A previous clinical study indicated that YSF could improve cognitive function in elderly patients, especially by improving naming, attention, and delayed recall ability. YSF granules consist of Xiangfu (Cyperus rotundus), Rougui (Cinnamomum verum), Sharen (Amomum dealbatum), Shanzhi (Gardenia jasminoides), Shichangpu (Acorus calamus), Yuanzhi (Polygala tenuifolia), and Xuancaohua (Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus).\nIn previous research on YSF in the treatment of cognitive impairment in vascular dementia rats carried out by our research group, we established rats with two-vessel occlusion and middle cerebral artery occlusion as a vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) rat model [12]. The results of the experiment showed that YSF could inhibit the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons and improve the spatial search ability and localization of VCI rats by regulating the BDNF-TrkB pathway and expression of mTOR protein in the hippocampus [13], which was sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai\n(No. 17ZR1428100). Based on the above basic research results, we performed a multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled study of YSF granules combined with acupuncture for elderly adults with MCI to further verify the clinical efficacy on cognitive function. The preliminary results showed that YSF granules combined with acupuncture could improve cognitive function, especially the visuospatial and executive ability of elderly patients with MCI (unpublished data). YSF has been granted the patent of invention by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (Patent No. 201810784587.8) as a TCM composition to improve VCI. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to objectively evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of YSF in the treatment of elderly patients with MCI based on our previous studies and to further provide a new therapy and clinical basis for the treatment of MCI with TCM."

The objective of this trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of YSF granules in elderly patients with MCI. The trial protocol (version 2.0, April 27, 2020) has been registered with the Chinese clinical trial registry (No. ChiCTR2000036807). The period for research recruitment is from August 5, 2021, to December 31, 2023. We present the following article in accordance with the SPIRIT 2013 reporting checklist. For more details about the checklist, please see Additional file\u00a01.\nBefore the beginning of the clinical study, all researchers will be trained on the standardized process and scale evaluation consistency to ensure the clinical trial quality and data credibility of each centre. A total of 280 elderly patients with MCI will be randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. It will be carried out in three clinical centres in Shanghai, 140 subjects will be recruited at Shanghai Municipal Hospital of TCM, and we plan to recruit 70 subjects from Shanghai Qingpu District Hospital of TCM and 70 subjects from Shanghai Jiading District Nanxiang Hospital. All participants will experience a 1-week screening period, with an 8-week treatment period and follow-up visits at 24 and 48\u00a0weeks. The primary efficacy outcome measures will be the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Memory and Executive Screening (MES) scores, which will be used to assess cognitive function following the interventions. The TCM symptom scale is a combined measure of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Safety outcome markers will include hepatic and renal functions, electrocardiogram data, routine blood and urine test results, and severe clinical discomfort. The schedule\nof enrolment, interventions, assessments and data collection is presented in Table\u00a0 1. The study will follow the Helsinki Declaration and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Municipal Hospital of TCM (approval no. 2020SHL-KY-06). Each subject could only be included in this study once and signed an informed consent form prior to study participation. The results of the study will help provide a clinical basis and TCM treatment plan for standardized diagnosis and treatment of MCI. The flowchart of this study is illustrated in Fig.\u00a01."

This method not only ensures the balance of each known important prognostic factor but also ensures that the number of cases in each treatment\ngroup in each centre was close or equal; this method is also convenient for management. To ensure the comparability of the key factors affecting the prognosis of patients in the intervention or control group, the stratified factors considered in this study are centre, sex, age and TCM syndrome patterns. Block randomization requires that the research object of each block be a multiple of the number of groups (twofold or fourfold). The sample size of this experiment is 280 patients, so each group from each area should consist of 4 patients, for a total of 70 blocks. Among them, there were 35 (140/4) blocks from the Shanghai Municipal Hospital of TCM, 18 (70/4) blocks from Shanghai Jiading District Nanxiang Hospital, and 18 (70/4) blocks from the Shanghai Qingpu District Hospital of TCM. To reduce the loss of patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the three centres could also set up a small number of blocks for 2 patients (such as fewer elderly patients) according to the actual needs.\nAt the same time, considering that when the three centres match patients of similar sex, age and TCM syndrome patterns into block groups, it is possible that the number of research objects in a block will be small or could lead to matching difficulties, so each centre should add 6 to 8 random participants (a total of 4 blocks)."

            "text": "Population ageing is an inevitable trend for the world\u2019s population [24], and China has one of the world\u2019s fastestgrowing demographics of older individuals worldwide [25]. It is estimated that by mid-century, the elderly population in China will reach 400 million, accounting for approximately 30% of the total population; accordingly, the prevalence of cognitive impairment in elderly individuals will increase. Shanghai was the first city to become a superaged society, in which ageing individuals constitute the highest percentage of the city\u2019s population. The office of the Shanghai Working Committee on Ageing and the Municipal Bureau of Statistics recently released the latest data and showed that on December 31, 2019, there were 5.1812 million older adults aged 60\u00a0years and older, accounting for 35.2% of the total population registered in Shanghai, and 2729 older people were over 100\u00a0years old in Shanghai. In China, the population ageing problem has increased the number of individuals with incapacitating diseases, accounting for 3% of the total number of elderly people, which has led to substantial personal and social burdens [26]. Therefore, how can health problems brought about by population ageing be proactively addressed? Efficacious therapy and prevention strategies\nare urgently needed to cope with age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including cognitive impairment and dementia, which are difficult problems that we need to overcome in medical and health research [27].\nCognitive function involves various aspects of working memory, execution function, reasoning ability, verbal ability, and ability to perform activities of daily living [28]. Cognitive impairment refers to the impairment of one or more functions in the above areas, which can affect the social function and quality of life of patients to varying degrees and even lead to death in severe cases. MCI is a transitional state between normal ageing and dementia [29]. Cognitive impairment is not only a simple medical problem but also a serious social problem. To the best of our knowledge, the incidence rate of MCI is 6.7% at 60\u201364\u00a0years of age, and the prevalence rate is 10 to 20% in the elderly population over 65\u00a0years old and 25.2% in the population aged 80\u201384\u00a0years old [30]. More than half of MCI patients will progress to dementia within 5\u00a0years, and only a small number of MCI patients can maintain stable cognitive function or even return to normal [31]. Approximately 10% of MCI patients convert to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) every year, and the incidence of dementia in MCI is 10 times higher than that in healthy elderly people [32]. Therefore, early intervention for MCI is very important for delaying the occurrence and development of dementia, improving the ability to perform activities of daily living, prolonging the survival period and reducing the burden of care and care; additionally, the early stage of MCI is considered to be the best intervention period to delay or reverse cognitive impairment.\nChinese herbal formulas have been widely used to improve cognitive function with a good curative effect. In the last few years, many investigators have engaged in research on TCM interventions in cognitive disorders to improve the management of MCI by TCM and to take the disease stage within the Alzheimer disease continuum seriously. TCM shows good clinical efficacy and characteristic advantages of early TCM intervention in cognitive impairment to provide an accurate basis to examine effective TCM therapies to delay the progression of cognitive impairment."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The following issues are considered limitations of the study. First, the 8-week treatment cycle in this study is relatively short. Cognitive impairment may require long-term maintenance medication to delay the development of the disease to prevent progression to dementia. Second, biomarkers and neuroimaging characteristics associated with MCI in the early symptomatic period are not yet clear. The changes in ERP and serum HCY may not fully reflect the curative effect of TCM on MCI.\nSubjective measurements combined with imaging may need to be performed to find the correlation between early brain tissue changes and MCI in further studies. Third, participants in this trial have fewer comorbidities. MCI is often comorbid with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, neurodegenerative or affective disturbance [33, 34], but the trial is aimed at increasing the pertinence of inclusion criteria and standardizing the drug to the disease, so it lacks certain generalizability. Finally, the 6-month follow-up period is rather short. MCI is a chronic, progressive disease that requires longterm follow-up to assess cognitive changes. Therefore, we may not observe the key node of cognitive impairment, further development, or transformation after the termination of treatment.\nBearing these limitations in mind, we will conduct long-term follow-up to record the prognosis of MCI patients treated with Chinese herbs. There is a dire need to strengthen health care systems with additional medical institutions and place more emphasis on the health of elderly people to improve the quality of life of these individuals. We are calling for more effective ways of delaying the progress of cognitive impairment as well as improve the prognosis."
