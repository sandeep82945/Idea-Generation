    "abstractText": "The Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) constitutes at least 77 phylogenetically distinct species including several agriculturally important and clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens. As with other Fusaria, they have been well documented to produce many secondary metabolites\u2014 compounds that are not required for the fungus to grow or develop but may be beneficial to the organism. An analysis of ten genomes from fungi within the terminal clade (clade 3) of the FSSC revealed each genome encoded 35 (F. cucurbitcola) to 48 (F. tenucristatum) secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). A total of seventy-four different BGCs were identified from the ten FSSC genomes including seven polyketide synthases (PKS), thirteen nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), two terpene synthase BGCs, and a single dimethylallytryptophan synthase (DMATS) BGC conserved in all the genomes. Some of the clusters that were shared included those responsible for producing naphthoquinones such as fusarubins, a red pigmented compound, squalestatin, and the siderophores malonichrome, ferricrocin, and triacetylfusarinine. Eight novel NRPS and five novel PKS BGCs were identified, while BGCs predicted to produce radicicol, gibberellin, and fusaoctaxin were identified, which have not previously described in members of the FSSC. The diversity of the secondary metabolite repertoire of the FSSC may contribute to the expansive host range of these fungi and their ability to colonize broad habitats.",

            "text": "Many fungi are capable of synthesizing complex compounds with bioactive properties that are not essential for the organism. These compounds, termed secondary metabolites, can have diverse chemical properties and are usually produced by a cluster of genes within the fungal genome [1]. These biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) frequently contain a key gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cbackbone\u201d unit of the compound and may include accessory genes that are responsible for further modification(s) to the compound. The two most common classes of key genes found in BGCs encode either polyketide synthases (PKSs) or nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). PKS enzymes generate a compound from linking ketides into a chain and are further divided into non-reducing and reducing PKS proteins, which are responsible for generating aromatic and fatty acid-like molecules, respectively. NRPSs catalyze the production of peptide-based compounds from individual amino acids. Other key enzymes in BGCs responsible for secondary metabolite biosynthesis include terpene synthase/cyclases, which produce compounds with the formula (C5H8)n, dimethylallytryptophan synthases (DMATS) producing derivatives of tryptophan, as well as BGCs encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase responsible for producing phosphonate compounds. The\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 799. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9080799 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 799 2 of 16\nmost prolific fungal producers of secondary metabolites are members of the Ascomycota, which produce well-known secondary metabolites such as the medically relevant compounds penicillin and lovastatin and the mycotoxins aflatoxin and deoxynivalenol (also known as vomitoxin). Members of the ascomycete genus Fusarium produce a myriad of secondary metabolites including several mycotoxins. As a genus, Fusarium is composed of hundreds of species separated into at least 23 phylogenetically distinct species complexes [2,3]. While the genus is estimated to have originated ~91 million years ago during the Cretaceous period [4], the group referred to as the F. solani species complex (FSSC) diverged from the rest of the Fusaria ~67 million years ago [4]. Currently, the FSSC is divided into at least 77 phylogenetically distinct species and are found worldwide [3,5]. This species complex is composed of three clades (clades 1\u20133) where the terminal clade 3 is the largest with at least 61 distinct species and is composed of many agriculturally important species as well as those associated with clinical infections [3,5\u20138]. Many secondary metabolites have been identified from members of the FSSC. Primarily these have been napthoquinones including fusarubin and a multitude of derivatives and similarly structured compounds (javanicin, solaniol, matricin, bikaverin, trichodermaol, etc.) [9,10]. Other confirmed secondary metabolites include citreoisocoumarin, cyclosporin, gibepyrone, lucilactaene, N-carbenzoxy-L-phenylalaninol, sansalvadmide, YCM1008A, as well as unknown metabolites including a red pigment [10,11]. Of these compounds, only the production of sansalvadmide (PKS30) and the red pigment (PKS35 also referred to as PKSN) has been experimentally linked to specific BGCs in isolates from the FSSC [12,13]. Secondary metabolites play an important role in fungal pathogenicity on plants and animals. Additionally, many secondary metabolites have inhibitory activity against other microbes, and therefore may influence the soil microbiome through their production. As members of the FSSC are soil-borne plant pathogens, evaluation of their secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential is essential to better understand these pathogens. Analysis of ten FSSC genomes revealed BGCs that were shared between all the FSSC genomes while some were unique to a single genome. Despite the abundance of these BGCs in the FSSC, the biosynthetic product of a vast majority of these BGCs remains unknown."

For the phylogenetic analysis, PKS and NRPS protein sequences from all FSSC isolates and reference protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT [25]. All the gaps and non-conserved regions were removed from the alignment using BMGE [26]. The best protein model selection was conducted using the program ProtTest 3.4 [27], and maximum likelihood phylogeny trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were generated using RAxML 8.0 [28].

The antiSMASH analysis revealed the FSSC genomes encoded an average of 41 BGCs, with the least in F. cucurbitcola\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 799 5 of 16\nwith 35 and the most in F. tenuicristatum with 48 (Table 2). The predicted number of BGCs in the two genomes of F. vanettenii, 77-13-4 and T23, were 39 and 42, respectively, indicating that diversity in the secondary metabolite potential exists within the same species (Table 2). The revised version of the F. vanettenii 77-13-4 genome identified 39 BGCs, 3 more than in the prior version. The FSSC isolates were predicted to produce PKS, NRPS, terpene synthase/cyclase, DMATS, phosphonate biosynthetic, and hybrid BGCs. The BGCs containing a PKS or NRPS gene as the main biosynthetic core gene were the most abundant gene clusters followed by terpene synthase/cyclase- containing clusters. Among these BGCs, only F. bataticola NRRL 22400 was predicted to encode a PKS\u2013terpene hybrid cluster. Two ambrosia Fusarium clade genomes, F. floridanum NRRL 62606 and F. euwallaceae UCR 1854, were capable of producing an NRPS\u2013terpene hybrid cluster and the F. bataticola and F. solani FS5 genomes were predicted to carry an NRPS\u2013DMATS hybrid cluster.\na Total BGC number is the number of BGCs in each genome and can be calculated as = (the sum of core biosynthetic genes from each BGC class\u2014the number of hybrid BGCs). b The total is the number of the indicated core protein and does not necessarily reflect the number of BGCs with that type of core biosynthetic protein. Some NRPS\u2013PKS hybrids consisted of a single core biosynthetic protein and were classified only under the PKS category. These BGCs were not included in the NRPS\u2013PKS hybrid BGC list.\nOf the putative BGCs, natural products for only a few were able to be predicted using the KnownClusterBlast function in antiSMASH (Table S1). The natural products squalestatin, a red pigment, and fusarubins/oxyjavanicin as well as several potential siderophores including fusarinine, ferricrocin, malonichrome, and metachelin, were predicted to be produced by all ten FSSC isolates analyzed in the study. Sansalvamide (NRPS30) and clavaric acid were predicted to be produced by all the FSSC isolates with the exception of those included in the ambrosia Fusarium clade (Table S1). An NRPS\u2013PKS hybrid BGC in F. solani FS5 and F. tenuicristatum was predicted to be responsible for the synthesis of cyclosporin, a secondary metabolite that has previously been described from members of the FSSC [10,33]."

Twenty-six different clades of NRPS proteins were distinguished (Figure 3 and Table S5), of which eighteen were previously identified in other Fusarium spp. and eight (NRPSA-H) were previously undescribed NRPS proteins found in the FSSC genomes. Of the 26 NRPSs in the FSSC genomes, 13 were conserved in all 10 genomes (NRPS1, NRPS2, NRPS3, NRPS6, NRPS10, NRPS11, NRPS12, NRPS13, NRPS27, NRPS28, NRPSA, NRPSB, and NRPSF; Figure 3). Conversely, NRPS21 and NRPS43 were found in only a single FSSC genome, F. tenuicristatum NRRL 22470 and F. solani FS5, respectively.

There were seven PKSs, thirteen NRPSs, two terpene synthases/cyclases, and one DMATS BGC common between all ten FSSC genomes included in this analysis. PKS3, PKS7, and PKS8 are frequently found in most Fusarium genomes [11,14], and all 10 FSSC isolates in this study carried these BGCs. Conversely, PKS32, PKS33, and PKS35 are primarily found in genomes of the FSSC and all\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 799 12 of 16\n10 FSSC genomes had these BGCs. While the biosynthetic products of PKS32 and PKS33 are not known, PKS35 is responsible for the production of a red pigment [13]. The presence of these PKS BGCs in an unidentified Fusarium sp. could aid in their identification as a member of the FSSC; however, it should be noted that PKS35 has recently been identified in closely related Fusarium species complexes such as F. staphlyeae, F. decemcellulare, and F. dimerum [14]. The production of a vast array of secondary metabolites likely contributes to the diverse environmental niche that members of the FSSC can be isolated from. For instance, many naphthoquinones have been isolated from members of the FSSC [3]. PKS3 is involved in the production of naphthoquinones such as fusarubin and oxyjavanicin, and could provide a competitive advantage to the FSSC isolates producing them as napthoquinones have antibacterial activity, especially against Gram-positive bacteria as well as inhibitory activity against protozoa and fungi [9,35]. Members of the FSSC are well-established plant pathogens and collectively have a broad host range, while some within the terminal clade of the FSSC are also associated with clinical infections resulting in fusariosis [3,5\u20138]. Some secondary metabolites have been demonstrated to be important virulence factors in fungi other than the FSSC [36]. The NRPS BGCs responsible for the synthesis of siderophores have been documented to be important for virulence for the closely related phytopathogen F. graminearum [37]. NRPS6 is conserved in ascomycetes and is responsible for the synthesis of the extracellular siderophore triaceylfusarinine, which is critical for virulence in several plant pathogenic fungi [38]. NRPS1 is responsible for the synthesis of another extracellular siderophore malonichrome, although it appears not to be as important for virulence as NRPS6, while NRPS2 is responsible for the production of the intracellular siderophore ferricrocin. In addition to these three siderophores, another might be produced by NRPS27, which is closely related to NRPS6; this may synthesize metachelins, which have been characterized in Metarhizium spp. [39]. In addition to siderophore production, two FSSC genomes included in this study also carried a BGC encoding NRPS5 and NRPS9, which are responsible for fusaotaxin A production in F. graminearum. Fusaotaxin A is a virulence factor involved in the cell-to-cell invasion of wheat [34]; however, mutants lacking the cluster display virulence similar to wild-type when inoculated in a maize stalk rot assay, indicating that this secondary metabolite is host-specific [34]. The NRPS5 homologues in the FSSC isolates are shorter, and therefore, it is hypothesized that they are responsible for producing a smaller product, although the similarity between the NRPS9 homologues suggests that the initial unit is likely \u03b3\u2013amino butyl acid (GABA), as seen with fusaotaxin A. Many secondary metabolites have phytotoxic activity and can aid in pathogenicity; in particular, the previously mentioned naphthoquinones are reported to arrest root growth [9]. Another example is radicicol (also known as monorden), which was first identified as a phytotoxin in F. virguliforme, a member of clade 2 of the FSSC and is the causative agent of soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) [40]. Radicicol is capable of producing SDSlike symptoms such as marginal curling and interveinal necrosis on soybean leaves. The secondary metabolite is an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 [41], and its production in the fungus Colletotrichum graminicola is hypothesized to suppress competing microorganisms and the plant defense response [42]. The two core radicicol PKS biosynthetic genes from F. tenuicristatum are similar to the PKS4- and PKS13-containing BGC in F. graminearum, which are responsible for the synthesis of the mycotoxin zearalenone [43,44]. A recent genuswide phylogenetic analysis of PKS proteins from Fusarium resolved the radicicol-producing PKS4 into a separate clade, PKS116, and identified structural differences in radicicol and zearalenone that were caused by reducing PKSs and post-PKS modification by other enzymes [14]. While there is similarity between the zearalenone BGC of F. graminearum and the radicicol BGC in F. tenuicristatum, radicicol biosynthesis could provide a competitive advantage in rhizosphere colonization and/or be directly involved in suppressing the plant host immune response.\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 799 13 of 16\nThe presence of some of the genes from the gibberellin BGC have been previously described in genomes of other Fusarium spp. that are more evolutionarily related than members of the FSSC (i.e., F. mangiferae, F. circinatum, and F. oxysporum; [45]). The F. mori genome has four of the seven genes in the gibberellin BGC including a homologue of the key CPS/KS gene (Figure 6A). While other Fusarium genomes have been identified to have intact gibberellin BGCs, these Fusarium isolates did not produce gibberellins under standard laboratory conditions [45]. Therefore, it is unlikely that F. mori is capable of producing gibberellins and the product of this similar BGC, if any, is unknown. Several DMATSs and phosphonate BGCs were identified in the FSSC; however, after an analysis of these clusters, none of the final products could be predicted. DMATSs catalyze the prenylation of L-tryptophan to generate dimethylallytrypthohan (DMAT), which is then predicted to be further modified by the accessory proteins also encoded within the cluster [46]. One of the best-known examples of secondary metabolites synthesized by a DMATS encoded in BGCs are the ergot alkaloids of Claviceps spp. Phosphonate-producing BGCs are capable of aiding an organism to sequester phosphorus when it is scarce or can function as an antimicrobial metabolite by producing toxic phosphonate compounds [47]. Further experimental characterization of these BGCs is necessary to identify the natural products synthesized and evaluate their biological relevance. Fungal secondary metabolites have a diverse array of bioactivity as evidenced in the number of compounds that have been developed for clinical use. As a majority of the secondary metabolite BGCs from members of the FSSC produce unknown products, further research into this area could provide alternative therapeutics. Additionally, better knowledge of these compounds could provide alternative options for disease management. Overall, the vast armamentarium utilized by members of the FSSC not only plays a critical role in pathogenesis but likely provides a competitive advantage to these fungi for further expanding their environmental niches.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/jof9080799/s1, Figure S1: Phylogenetic analysis of various PKS proteins from FSSC genomes; Figure S2: Genetic organization and conservation of fusarubin/oxyjavanicin BGC across the FSSC genomes and F. fujikuroi.
