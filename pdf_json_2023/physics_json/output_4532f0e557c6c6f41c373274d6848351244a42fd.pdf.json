    "abstractText": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that affects more than 8 million people. Although there are therapies against this disease, the search for new drugs is important because the current treatments show limited effectiveness and high toxicity. In this work, eighteen dihydrobenzofuran-type neolignans (DBNs) and two benzofuran-type neolignans (BNs) were synthesized and evaluated against amastigote forms of two Trypanosoma cruzi strains. The in vitro cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of the most active compounds were also evaluated and their relationships with T. cruzi tubulin DBNs were investigated by an in silico approach. Four DBNs demonstrated activity against the T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z strain (IC50 from 7.96 to 21.12 \u03bcM), and DBN 1 exhibited the highest activity against the amastigote forms of the T. cruzi Y strain (IC50 3.26 \u03bcM). Compounds 1\u20134 showed CC50 values higher than antitrypanosomal activities, except for DBN 3. All DBNs with antitrypanosomal activity demonstrated CH50 higher than 100 \u03bcM. The in silico results indicated that DBNs 1, 2, and 4 are capable of destabilizing the dynamics of the tubulinmicrotubule from the vinca site. These compounds displayed promising in vitro activity against T. cruzi, especially compound 1, and can be considered molecular prototypes for the development of new antiparasitic drugs.",

            "text": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and its transmission can occur by contact with contaminated blood, congenital and oral routes, and by contamination with triatomine vector feces [1]. This disease affects about 6\u20137 million people in more than 20 countries in Latin America and is responsible for 1\u20132 million deaths every year [2]. The treatment is restricted to two nitroheterocyclic drugs, benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox. Although they are very efficient in treating acute infections, these drugs have frequent undesirable side effects and have limited efficacy in the chronic phase of the disease [3]. Furthermore, BZN and nifurtimox show high toxicity and require a prolonged treatment period [4], so they are not considered ideal [5,6]. According to molecular genetics, eco-epidemiological and pathogenicity features, T. cruzi populations have been classified into at least seven discrete typing units (DTUs) [7\u201310] and\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 754. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15030754 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 754 2 of 14\nsusceptibility to reference drugs can vary among T. cruzi strains [11,12]. In this worrisome scenario, the search for new drugs against Chagas disease is important, especially in developing countries. In the research of new hit/lead compounds against trypanosomatids, many research groups have previously evaluated the activity of neolignans, which comprise an important class of phenolic structures derived from the oxidative coupling of allyl phenols and propylphenols [13]. Among neolignans, dihydrobenzofuran-type neolignans (DBNs) and benzofuran-type neolignans (BNs) have attracted attention due to their structural diversity and their broad range of biological activities, including leishmanicidal and antitrypanosomal activities [14\u201317]. For instance, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran neolignan (2,3-DBN), which is commonly found in propolis and other plants, inhibits the growth of promastigote and amastigote forms of L. (L.) amazonensis [17]. Besides, DBNs have also demonstrated activity against axenic amastigotes of L. donovani [14] and against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi [15]. The biological activities of DBNs against trypanosomatids also can be attributed to the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, a heterodimeric protein involved in various cellular processes that is considered a target for antiprotozoal chemotherapy [14]. Based on these previous reports in the literature, and as part of our ongoing research on the antiparasitic activity of synthetic compounds analogs to natural products [12,18], this work aimed to exploit the antitrypanosomal effects of eighteen synthetic DBNs and two synthetic BNs (Scheme 1) on the two T. cruzi strains and their cytotoxicity on mammalian cells under in vitro experimental conditions. The relationship between the most active compounds and their T. cruzi tubulin was also investigated by an in silico approach.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\ndisease [3]. Furthermore, BZN and nifurtimox show high toxicity and require a prolonged\ntreatment period [4], so they are not considered ideal [5,6].\nAccording to molecular genetics, eco-epidemiological and pathogenicity features, T.\ncruzi populations have been classified into at least seven discrete typing units (DTUs) [7\u2013\n10] and susceptibility to reference drugs can vary among T. cruzi strains [11,12]. In this\nworrisome scenario, the search for new drugs against Chagas disease is important, espe-\ncially in developing countries.\nIn the research of ne hit/lead compounds against trypanosomatids, many research\ngroups have previously evaluated the activity of neolignans, which comprise an important\nclass of phenolic structures derived from the oxidative coupling of allyl phenols and\npropylphenols [13]. Among neolignans, dihydrobenzofuran-type neolignans (DBNs) and\nbenzofuran-type neolignans (BNs) have attracted attention due to their structural diversity\nand their broad range of biological activities, including leishmanicidal and antitrypanoso-\nmal activities [14\u201317]. For instance, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran neolignan (2,3-DBN), which is\ncommonly found in propolis and other plants, inhibits the rowth of promastigote and\namastig te forms of L. (L.) am zonensis [17]. Besides, DBNs have also demonstrated activity\ngainst axenic amastigotes of L. donovani [14] and against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi\n[15]. The biological activities of DBNs against trypanosomatids also can be attributed to the\ninhibition of tubulin polymerization, a heterodimeric protein involved in various cellular\nprocesses that is considered a target for antiprotozoal chemotherapy [14].\nBased on these previous reports in the literature, and as part of our ongoing research\non the antiparasitic activity of synthetic compounds analogs to natural products [12,18],\nthis work aimed to exploit the antitrypanosomal effects of eighteen synthetic DBNs and\ntwo synthetic BNs (Scheme 1) on the two T. cruzi strains and their cytotoxicity on mam-\nmalia c lls under in v tro experimental conditions.

Compounds 4\u201320 were synthesized from 1 or 2 by the previously reported methodologies [21\u201323]. Briefly, the methyl esters a, b, and c (16.0 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (40 mL) in a round-bottom flask covered by aluminum foil, then Ag2O (8.0 mmol) was added as the oxidizer. The reactions were stirred under an N2 atmosphere at room temperature for 4 h. Next, the oxidizer was filtered off and the resulting crude reaction mixtures were purified by column chromatography (2.2 \u00d7 100 cm, silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm) using hexane and ethyl acetate (2:1 v/v) as eluent to give 1 (36% yield), 2 (43% yield), and 3 (12% yield) as racemic mixtures of trans-enantiomers. Neolignans 1 and 2 were converted into 4 and 5 by acetylation with acetic anhydride as previously reported by Kuo and co-workers with modifications [21]. To this end, compounds 1 (1.15 mmol) and 2 (1.30 mmol) were solubilized in pyridine (7 mL) in a three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, then acetic anhydride (7 mL) was added. The reaction was kept under stirring and N2 atmosphere at room temperature for 48 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford products 4 (82% yield) and 5 (96% yield). The synthesis of compound 6 was based on the work reported by Felix [24]. To this end, compound 1 (0.85 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL dichloromethane (DCM) in a three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature under an N2 atmosphere. Boron tribromide (BBr3, 8.5 mmol) was added, and the mixture was maintained for 7 h. The crude reaction mixture was washed with water (3 \u00d7 10 mL) and the organic phase was chromatographed over silica gel (0.8\u00d7 40 cm, silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm), using as eluent a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (5:1 v/v) to afford 6 (38% yield). Compound 7 was obtained from 1 as previously reported [21]. To this end, in a roundbottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer under an inert atmosphere (N2), DBN 1 (1.4 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (10 mL) and added to 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4benzoquinone (DDQ, 1.8 mmol) as the oxidizer. The reaction mixture was maintained under reflux for 22 h, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude reaction mixture. Purification of the crude reaction mixture by column chromatography (1.2 \u00d7 60 cm, silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm) using hexane and ethyl acetate (1:2 v/v) as eluent gave compound 7 (74% yield). Compounds 8, 12, and 13 were obtained following the methodology previously reported by Pieters and co-workers [23]. To this end, compounds 1, 2, and 7 (0.6 mmol) were dissolved in 40 mL dry acetone, and 0.3 g of Pd/C (5%) was added to the mixtures, which were put up in a high-pressure reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and H2 (60 psi) at room temperature for 2 h. The mixtures were filtered off to remove the catalyst, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give 8 (94% yield), 12 (95% yield), and 13 (88% yield), respectively. Compound 11 was obtained from 2 as described by Kuo and co-workers with modifications [21]. To this end, compound 2 (1.1 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (10 mL) in a threenecked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Next, benzoyl chloride (0.2 mL) was added. The mixture was kept under stirring at room temperature for 20 h. The crude mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure, washed with toluene and dichloromethane, and chromatographed over silica (silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm, tube dimensions 1.2 \u00d7 60 cm) with hexane and ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) to obtain 11 (95% yield). DBNs 1 and 2 were methylated as described in previous reports [23]. These starting materials (1.3 mmol) were dissolved in dry acetone (20 mL) in a three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Next, K2CO3 (2.6 mmol) and CH3I (2.6 mmol) were added and kept under stirring and an N2 atmosphere for 24 h. The mixtures were filtered and purified by column chromatography (1.2 \u00d7 60 cm, silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm) with hexane and ethyl acetate (3:2 v/v), followed by recrystallization with ether to give 16 (22% yield) and 17 (18% yield).\nCompounds 16 and 17 were further hydrogenated by the same procedure described above. Briefly, compounds 16 and 17 (0.2 mmol) were dissolved in dry acetone (20 mL) and added to a high-pressure reactor containing Pd/C (5%, 0.15g) and kept for 2 h under magnetic stirring and H2 pressure (60 psi). The crude reaction mixtures were filtered and dried under reduced pressure to give 18 (90% yield) and 19 (91% yield), respectively. Compound 19 was used to obtain 4-O-methylcedrusin (20) through reduction with LiAlH4, as described by Pieters and co-workers [23]. To this end, compound 19 (0.15 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (10 mL) in a three-necked flask, then LiAlH4 (0.15 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (5 mL) and slowly added using an addition funnel. The mixture was stirred under an N2 atmosphere for 2 h at 0 \u25e6C. The reaction mixture was worked up by the addition of H2O and then concentrated HCl. The mixture was transferred to a separation funnel, and the organic layer was collected, concentrated under reduced pressure, and further purified by column chromatography (0.8 \u00d7 40 cm, silica gel 60, 0.040\u20130.063 mm) using a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (2:8 v/v) as eluent to give 4-O-methylcedrusin (20, 49% yield). A similar procedure was applied to reduce 1 (0.75 mmol), 2 (0.75 mmol), 12 (0.4 mmol), and 13 (0.4 mmol) into 9 (62% yield), 10 (60% yield), 14 (59% yield), and 15 (52% yield), respectively. All the structures were confirmed by NMR analyses (Table S1, Figures S1\u2013S40, Supplementary Material). Purity of compounds 1\u201320 was assessed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) (Figures S41\u2013S60, Supplementary Material). A minimum purity of 90% was required for the biological assays."

To correct the alignment of the T. cruzi \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin sequences, they were performed with the aid of the T. brucei brucei, T. brucei rhodeniense, and L.

In addition, to obtain complete binding sites located at the interfaces between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin subunits and also between the \u03b2- and \u03b1tubulin, an \u03b11-\u03b2-\u03b12-heterodimer was constructed, with the subunits modeled from the 3D crystallographic model (RCSB PDB ID 402B, Rattus norvegicus). The results of the homology modeling were based on the values of the Q-Mean scoring functions (Qualitative Model Energy Analysis) and the Ramachandran graph [35,36]. The simulation was performed in the GOLD 5.3 program [37], with the centroid defined from the 3D structures PDB ID 4O2B (colchicine) and PDB ID 4EB6 (vinblastine). As for tubulin, studies were carried out in four 3D structures: PDB ID 402B (for colchicine), PDB ID 4EB6 (for vinblastine), and two other sites from the amino acid residues of colchicine and vinblastine. For tubulin, a radius of 10\u00c5 was established from their respective centroids, and the scoring function chosen for both was GoldScore. The re-docking process required to validate the simulation used colchicine and vinblastine for tubulin, which were obtained from the crystallographic structures PDB ID 4O2B and 4EB6, respectively.

This methodology allows for obtaining the structure core of DBNs in one single synthetic step in moderate yields (40\u201360%) [38]. Recently, Dias and co-workers achieved a considerable reduction in the reaction time (from 24 h to 4 h) by using acetonitrile as the reaction solvent, thus introducing an additional advantage to this methodology [20]. The synthesis of compounds 1\u201320 was designed based on the literature [14,23]. Pieters and co-workers also synthesized a series of DBNs using the Ag2O-promoted oxidative coupling of methyl esters of p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acid. Further structure modifications (catalytic hydrogenation, reduction with LiAlH4, oxidation with DDQ, and alkylation with CH3I) resulted in a total of 19 DBNs and BNs, including compounds 1\u20133, 12\u201315, 17, 19, and 20, which were evaluated for their cytotoxicity to 60 humor tumor cell lines. Compound 3 displayed an average GI50 value (i.e., the molar drug concentration required for 50% growth inhibition) of 0.3 \u00b5M and inhibited mitosis at micromolar concentrations in cell culture through a relatively weak interaction at the colchicine binding site of tubulin purified from the bovine brain [23]. A few years later, Miert and co-workers carried out the same structure modifications reported by Pieters and co-workers, adding to acetylation with Ac2O, to a series of DBNs obtained from the oxidative coupling of different alkyl esters derived from p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acid. Among the compounds tested for their antiparasitic activity, the DBN obtained from the oxidative coupling of caffeic acid and n-butyl ester displayed high activity against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (strain K1) (IC50 = 0.43 \u00b5g/mL), Leishmania donovani (IC50 values of 0.12 \u00b5g/mL and 0.19 \u00b5g/mL against axenic amastigotes and infected macrophage, respectively), and trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei rhodiense (IC50 = 0.29 \u00b5g/mL) [14]. The authors also evaluated the antitrypanosomal activity against trypomastigote forms of the Trypanosoma cruzi Tulahuen strain C2C4 containing a \u03b2-galactose (Lac-Z gene); however, none of the tested compounds displayed promising activity [14]."

Yunck by Luize and co-workers, were active against epimastigote forms of the T. cruzi Y strain, displaying IC50 values of 26.3 \u00b5g/mL (90.9 \u00b5M), 7.0 \u00b5g/mL (23.8 \u00b5M), 7.5 \u00b5g/mL (28.4 \u00b5M), and 8.0 \u00b5g/mL (30.0 \u00b5M), respectively [40]. Pereira and co-workers (2011) synthesized (\u00b1)-licarin by oxidative coupling, isolated (+)-licarin and (-)-licarin, and tested their in vitro antitrypanosomal activity against trypomastigote forms of the T. cruzi Y strain. The authors demonstrated that (-)-licarin (IC50 = 23.46 \u00b5M) is more active than (+)-licarin (87.73 \u00b5M) and (\u00b1)-licarin (127.17 \u00b5M) [16]. However, data on the\nin vitro activity of these compounds against amastigote forms of T. cruzi, which are the intracellular forms found in the tissues of the vertebrate host [41], are still scarce [42]. The antitrypanosomal activity of the DBNs 1\u20136, 9\u201320, and BNs 7 and 8 against the amastigote forms of the T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z and Y strains is shown in Table 1.\nFirst, the antitrypanosomal activity of compounds 1\u201320 was evaluated against Tulahuen lac-Z after 72 h. DBN 2 displayed the highest activity against amastigotes of the T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z strain (IC50 = 7.96 \u00b5M), followed by compounds 1 (IC50 = 11.87 \u00b5M), 3 (IC50 = 16.16 \u00b5M), and 4 (IC50 = 21.42 \u00b5M). On the other hand, compounds 5\u201320 showed IC50 values ranging from 31.58 to 300.7 \u00b5M. BZN (benznidazole), which was used as the reference compound (positive control), showed high activity (IC50 = 2.15 \u00b5M). Next, compounds 1\u20134, which were the most active against amastigotes of T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z were evaluated against amastigotes of the T cruzi Y strain. DBN 1 displayed the highest activity (IC50 = 3.26 \u00b5M), with activity similar to BZN (IC50 = 3.56 \u00b5M), whereas DBNs 2, 3, and 4 exhibited IC50 values higher than 25 \u00b5M against the amastigotes of the T. cruzi Y strain (Table 1). According to the literature, hit and lead compounds against intracellular amastigotes must display IC50 values lower than 10 \u00b5M [43]. In this context, compound 1 can be considered a hit compound in vitro, whereas compounds 2, 3, and 4 displayed promising activity against amastigote forms of T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z. The IC50 values obtained for 1\u20134 are lower as compared to those of eupomatenoid-5 (IC50 = 7 \u00b5g/mL or 23.78 \u00b5M), a benzofuran neolignan isolated from the leaves of Piper regnelli var. pallescens by Luize and co-workers [42]. Compounds 1\u20133 were synthesized directly from phenylpropanoids by oxidative coupling mediated by Ag2O, whereas compounds 4\u201320 were obtained from 1\u20133 (Scheme 1). The results shown in Table 2 evidenced that none of the derivatizations (reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis) performed in the structures of 1\u20133 to obtain 4\u201320 potentialized the in vitro antitrypanosomal activity. However, some preliminary structure-activity relationships can be suggested from these results. Reduction of the ester functionalities at C9 and C9\u2032 to convert 1 and 2 into the primary alcohols 9 and 10 caused a\n20-fold decrease in the activity. Hydrogenation of the double bond between C7\u2032 and C8\u2032 in 1 and 2 to produce 12 and 13 led to a 24-fold and 10-fold loss of the activity, respectively. Methylations (1\u219216 and 2\u219217) and acylations (at the hydroxy group at C4) also decreased the activity, but the decrease caused by these derivatizations is more discrete as compared to the ester and double-bond reductions. Apparently, the activity is also decreased by the presence of a double bond between C7 and C8 (1\u21927) and a carboxyl functionality at C9\u2032 (1\u21926), as well as by the nature of the acyl group at C4 (conversion 1\u21924 led to a two-fold loss of the activity, whereas 1\u219211 cause a 6-fold loss of the activity). These results suggest that the ester function at C9 and C9\u2032 and the double bond between C7\u2032 and C8\u2032 play a key role in the in vitro antitrypanosomal activity of DBNs against T. cruzi.\nCC50: the 50% cytotoxic concentration in different line cells (Murine spleen cells and LLC-MK2 Macaca mulatta monkey epithelial kidney cells) after 24 and 72 h, respectively. Selectivity indexes (SI) were determined by dividing the CC50 of the LLC-MK2 by IC50 at 72 h of each T. cruzi strain; CH50: the 50% hemolytic concentration; ND: not determined; BZN: benznidazole (positive control)."

All the CC50 values were found to be higher than the IC50 values in both cell lines. Compound 3 (CC50 = 30.76 \u00b5M) was the most cytotoxic in LLC-MK2 cells, followed by 4 (CC50 = 67.50 \u00b5M), 2 (CC50 = 67.59 \u00b5M), and 1 (CC50 = 70.86 \u00b5M). Compound 3 was also the most cytotoxic (CC50 < 1.95 \u00b5M) in murine spleen cells, followed by 2 (CC50 = 34.20 \u00b5M), 1 (CC50 = 49.87 \u00b5M), and 4 (CC50 = 51.09 \u00b5M). According to the literature criteria, a hit compound should show selectivity index (SI) values higher than 10 to be considered safe for use in mammals [43,44]. Here, the SI values were calculated by dividing the CC50 values for the LLC-MK2 cell lines by the IC50 values for each T. cruzi strain at 72 h. Neolignan 1 displayed a low selectivity to T. cruzi Tulahuen lac-Z (SI = 5.96). On the other hand, this compound showed an interesting selectivity to T. cruzi Y strains (SI = 21.73). This selectivity to the T. cruzi Y strain was higher as compared to BZN (SI = 12.13), which was used as the positive control. The hemolytic activity of compounds with antitrypanosomal activity is also a matter of concern due to the elevation of plasma hemoglobin with erythrocyte lysis, inducing deleterious effects mainly in the kidneys and cardiovascular system [45]. In this study, the hemolytic activity of DBNs 1\u20134, which displayed the most potent in vitro antitrypanosomal activity, was evaluated after 30 min (Table 2). All the neolignans tested and BZN displayed CH50 higher than 100 \u00b5M."

            "text": "The mechanism of action through which DBNs and BNs cause antitrypanosomal activity remains unknown. Recently, Maia and co-workers performed a virtual screening of 47 neolignans for their in vitro antitrypanosomal potential against three targets, the enzymes cruzain, trypanothione reductase, and sterol 14-alpha demethylase [46]. In the\npresent study, the target of interest was tubulin, since it is a target of great importance for inhibiting the growth and death of the parasite [47]. Moreover, synthetic dihydrobenzofuran neolignans and their related benzofurans, which contain the well-known pharmacophore for inhibitors of tubulin polymerization binding at the colchicine site have been demonstrated to have antiprotozoal properties [14]. According to the literature, four binding sites capable of disturbing the dynamics of the tubulin-microtubule are described: the colchicine site, vinca (vinblastine), curcumin, and a fourth site where naphthoquinones and their derivatives bind to the protein [47\u201349]. Thus, in this work, the interactions between DBNs 1, 2, and 4 and these four binding sites in T. cruzi tubulin were studied. To this end, an heterodimeral structure \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b1 for tubulin was constructed through homology modeling (Figure 1a) [34]. The negative Q-Mean score values for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 units were, respectively, \u22122.67 and \u22121.14, which are lower than their respective experimental structures and, therefore, were considered appropriate for docking [35]. Additionally, validation studies of the \u03b11-\u03b2-\u03b12 model showed that 97.8% of the protein\u2019s amino acid residues are found in the most energetically favorable regions of the Rachamandran diagram and 2.2% in the energetically allowed regions. The re-docking values using colchicine and vinblastine presented, respectively, RMSD values of 0.56 \u00c5 and 0.94 \u00c5, which indicated the good quality of the predictions made by molecular docking. For more detailed analyses, the poses of compounds 1, 2, and 4 were compared to the poses of colchicine, vinblastine, imido-1,4-naphthoquinone derivative, and curcumin. In addition, the results were also compared with those previously reported in the literature [47,48,50\u201352]. The results indicated that, initially, there was an overlap between compounds 1, 2, and 4 and colchicine, vinblastine, imido-1,4-naphthoquinone derivative, and curcumin (Figure 1b\u2013e), with the best overlap occurring with vinblastine through its vindoline group. This was confirmed by analyzing the interaction of the neolignan poses with the active protein site, in which the best results were observed at the vinca site (vinblastine). Hence, only the results regarding the poses on the vinca site will be described here. Regarding 1 and 2, hydrophobic interactions with \u03b2-Val175 and \u03b1-Cys353 residues are observed, as in the vinblastine pose (Figure 1b\u2013e), in addition to the agreement with the literature regarding the hydrogen bonding with \u03b2- Val179 and hydrophobic interaction with \u03b1-Cys353 [52]. This indicates that these two neolignans behave similarly concerning the vinca site (vinblastine). For neolignan 4, the interactions are similar to the vinblastine pose only in regards to the \u03b2 fraction of the protein, with hydrophobic interactions between the neolignan and the \u03b2-Leu248 and \u03b2-Lys352 residues and hydrogen bonding with \u03b2-Asn329, which highlights that interactions with residues \u03b2-Lys352 and \u03b2-Asn329 are important at this site, as previously reported [52]. The results obtained for the docking of these neolignans suggest that the inhibition of tubulin occurs through interaction with the vinca site. These data also indicate that both 1 and 2 interact more strongly at the vinca site than 4, as they interact with both residues important for protein inhibition located in the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. However, the score values for the three structures are close (57.61, 61.98, and 56.63 for 1, 2, and 4, respectively).\nRegarding 1 and 2, hydrophobic interactions with \u03b2-Val175 and \u03b1-Cys353 residues\nare observed, as in the vinblastine pose (Figure 1b\u2013e), in addition to the agreement with\nthe literature regarding the hydrogen bonding with \u03b2- Val179 and hydrophobic interac-\ntion with \u03b1-Cys353 [52]. This indicates that these two neolignans behave similarly con-\ncerning the vinca site (vinblastine). For neolignan 4, the interactions are similar to the vin-\nblastine pose only in regards to the \u03b2 fraction of the protein, with hydrophobic interactions\nbetween the neolignan and the \u03b2-Leu248 and \u03b2-Lys352 residues and hydrogen bonding\nwith \u03b2-Asn329, which highlights that interactions with residues \u03b2-Lys352 and \u03b2-Asn329\nare important at this site, as previously reported [52].\nThe results obtained for the docking of these neolignans suggest that the inhibition\nof tubulin occurs through interaction with the vinca site.

The results obtained from molecular docking indicated that 1, 2, and 4 are capable of destabilizing the dynamics of the tubulin-microtubule from the vinca site. The results indicated that the presence of the ester carbonyl at C9 and C9\u2032 and the double bond between C7\u2032 and C8\u2032 play a key role in the antitrypanosomal activity. However, these preliminary structure-activity relationships must be further confirmed by QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) studies, which are underway. Compound 1 displayed an IC50 agaisnt the T. cruzi Y strain similar to that of BZN but with a two-fold increased selectivity to T. cruzi as compared to LLC-MK2 cells. These\nresults demonstrated that DBN 1 can be considered a molecular prototype that could be used for the development of new antitrypanosomal drugs.
