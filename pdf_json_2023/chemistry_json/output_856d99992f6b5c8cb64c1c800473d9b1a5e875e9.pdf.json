    "abstractText": "Peptides, or short chains of amino-acid residues, are becoming increasingly important as active ingredients of drugs and as crucial probes and/or tools in medical, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical research. Situated at the interface between small molecules and larger macromolecular systems, they pose a difficult challenge for computational methods. We report an in silico peptide library generation and prioritization workflow using CmDock for identifying tetrapeptide ligands that bind to Fc regions of antibodies that is analogous to known in vitro recombinant peptide libraries\u2019 display and expression systems. The results of our in silico study are in accordance with existing scientific literature on in vitro peptides that bind to antibody Fc regions. In addition, we postulate an evolving in silico library design workflow that will help circumvent the combinatorial problem of in vitro comprehensive peptide libraries by focusing on peptide subunits that exhibit favorable interaction profiles in initial in silico peptide generation and testing.",

            "text": "Antibodies represent the most widespread molecules in use for analysis and recognition, having reached a 50% market share in diagnostics as early as 1990 [1,2]. Since then, their use has expanded across several fields from bio-recognition agents in molecular biochemistry and diagnostics to biopharmaceuticals [3,4]. Specifically, methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, immune-purification in industrial downstream processing, Western blot and biosensors are antibody-based along with certain immunotherapy, immunosuppressant, and infectious disease drugs [1,3,5,6]. Widespread use of antibodies is possible due to their desirable properties, such as a high level of specificity and affinity to target molecules, the ability to target diverse molecules and long shelf-life. [6,7]. Desired antibody properties stem from the mixture of unique structural properties, as they can easily be modified and refined using genetic engineering, with the most notable technology development being the groundbreaking discovery of monoclonal antibodies by K\u00f6hler and Milstein, which allowed us to treat antibodies as molecules and not variable biological serum [8]. Antibodies represent heterodimeric proteins, composed of two interconnected heavy and light chains [9,10]. The two arms of the proverbial letter Y represent the variable fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain, responsible for antigen recognition (Figure 1) [10].

The antibodies also represent binding partners for a variety of bacterial proteins, including proteins , , L and Z, with the protein A (Figure 2) binding specifically between the CH2 and CH3 do ai s of t e Fc regio [16,18]. These interactions are crucial for facilitating the develop ent of antibodies into biological drugs as they are utilized for antibody purification, antibody localization on nano aterials and for i prove ent of seru protein half-lives [1]. However, as such purification is expensive, amounting to up to 50\u201380% of the overall production cost, and with the demand for antibodies growing each year, alternative methods with improved properties for the affinity capture of IgG are required. Besides the high production cost, antibodies purified using proteins A and G are burdened by additional factors such as activity loss due to harsh elution or sterilization conditions, as well as leaching of toxic and immunogenic fragments into final products [19,20]. Ligands that would substitute proteins A and G fall short of the logarithmic removal value (LRV) set by protein A, despite an almost three-decade effort to improve on them [20]. Small peptides are currently the most promising candidates to replace proteins A and G as biorecognition reagents [3,4,20]. Despite their small size, usually 4\u201320 amino-acid residues (AAs), short peptides can bind the target Fc region with specific interactions. Their small size also comes as an advantage because it facilitates cost-efficient synthesis and resistance to harsh elution conditions, since no complex folding patterns are required for biorecognition [3,18]. In comparison with proteins A and G, they also possess low toxicity and immunogenicity\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 3 of 22\nprofiles [4].

Antibody surface is depicted and color-coded according to surface aminoacid residue properties (red and blue indicate negatively and positively charged surface residues, respectively, cyan indicates polar amino-acid residues, green hydrophobic amino-acid residues and gray glycines). Protein A residues in direct contact with the antibody are labelled.\nSeveral successful attempts at developing such short peptides exist, such as the hydroxybenzyl-based ligand D2AAG and DAAG, peptides HYFKFD, HDRRHL and HWRGWV, mimetic peptide (RTY)4K2KG, the protein A-based FYWHCLDE and the enriched peptide GSYWYNVWF [3,25\u201327]. The identification of these short peptides has been achieved using high-throughput screening methods, such as phage display libraries or synthetic solid-phase libraries (Figure 3) [3,28]. As the importance of computational methods in drug discovery and research is growing, due to their fast workflow, the areas of their applications expand. One such field is peptide\u2013protein interactions which form the key component of all protein\u2013protein interactions (PPI) present in living cells [29]. The initial step in elucidating the important biological processes mediated by peptide segments and ranking them is often achieved using molecular docking [30]. Molecular docking can provide the binding pose of a given peptide, and an assessment of its binding affinity via a scoring function [31]. All in all, peptide docking possesses inherent challenges such as: shallow and solvent-exposed binding sites, larger degrees of freedom compared to small organic molecules of comparable size, binding specificity dependent on key amino-acid residues and secondary structure formation (folding) of peptides [32]. The combination of these factors significantly increases the sampling difficulty for a given docking method and affects the quality of the obtained protein\u2013peptide complexes [32]. Dedicated peptide protocols in docking software such as SP Peptide in the Glide software by Schr\u00f6dinger are found in manuals [33]. In general, there are also peptide-targeted docking solutions with two prevalent approaches, namely template-based docking and template-free docking, with the former being limited for general applications due to the lack of known templates.

The general consensus is that docking algorithms designed specifically for protein\u2013 peptide docking outperform protein\u2013protein and small molecule-docking algorithms. owever, their performance is heavily dependent on the length of the peptide. For example, typical Glide 2013-2 limits the use to around 11 amino-acid residues or less; the BioLuminate Peptide Docking protocol by Schr\u00f6dinger to 16 amino-acid residues; Glide 2015-1 and higher can handle up to 100 rotatable bonds and is, therefore, suitable for most peptide cases. As an alternative with regards to the sampling problematics, peptide conformations can be pre-generated using dedicated software and the calculated structures used in rigid docking experiments [30]. In this work we, applied a widely parametrized (protein and nucleic acid systems) and an in house developed docking software CmDock that has a feature of extended sampling for the enrichment of a combinatorial tetrapeptide library on the antibody Fc region receptor to develop a useful peptide library docking pipeline that can identify experimentally supported hits. The study performed and the protocol developed may help in vitro researchers in faster discovery of peptide ligands, especially those used in purification processes, potentially realizing the need for a purification peptide with better properties than protein A. As a proof of concept for the in silico protocol, we focused on the smallest peptides showing affinity and selectivity; furthermore, tetrapeptides displayed a manageable sampling problem where the complete combinatorial library of 160,000 tetrapeptides displayed an average of 14.3 \u00b1 2.4 rotatable bonds [25]. The approach of targeting the larger Fc region using small tetrapeptides can also act as a model study for the development of peptides that bind to alternative targets. A small peptide can act as a model ligand, as it has been shown that, despite the involvement of large surfaces\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 5 of 22\nin protein\u2013protein interactions, the majority of the energetic contributions for binding comes from key amino-acid residues [34,35]. In this manner, the protein\u2013protein or peptide\u2013 protein aspect of the human interactome can be assayed for future drug development as an inverse screening paradigm [36]."

residues from the Fc region of the IgG antibody that showed the highest number of interactions with tetrapeptide ligand are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting information) and include hydrogen bond acceptor residues: THR250, LEU251, GLU430, LEU432 and HIS435; hydrogen bond donor residues: ILE253 and ASN434; hydrophobic residues: MET252, ILE253 and LEU314; and a charged residue GLU430. According to ligand binding modes and frequency of amino-acid residues occurrence, small differences in binding mode can be observed within the cluster. Amino-acid residues most frequent at peptide position 1 can be placed into two groups. The first group contains amino-acid residues with uncharged side chains (SER, THR, ASN, GLN, CYS) that donate hydrogen atoms into a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of GLU430 main chain (Figure 5A). In this conformation, the N-end forms H-bonds with carbonyl of GLU430 main chain and imidazole nitrogen of HIS435 side chain and in certain cases also with carbonyl of LEU432 main chain. In the second group are the smallest residues, GLY and ALA, in which the N-end is shifted slightly toward the GLU430 side chain, which facilitates additional interaction, namely with GLU430 carboxylate (Figure 5B). Amino-acid residues having uncharged side chains, such as SER, THR or ASN, are present at peptide position 2 that engage in H-bond interaction with carbonyls of GLU430 or LEU432 main chains or amine/amide of ASN434. Amino-acid residues at peptide position 3 include residues able to donate hydrogen, such as positively charged HIS, uncharged ASN, THR, and CYS, as well as residues with aromatic hydrophobic side chains (PHE, TRP). The pattern that was observed was that if residues with aromatic cyclic side chain (HIS, PHE or TRP) and ASN are present at position 3, they are oriented toward the binding pocket formed by the Fc residues LEU251, MET252, ILE253, GLN311, and LEU315, where they interact through H-bonding with a carbonyl of the THR250 main chain and aromatic cycle containing residues HIS, TRP, and PHE form \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with HIS435 (Figure 5A). Due to the high hydrophobicity of side chains at this position, the largest share of ligand hydrophobic interactions was observed with residues MET252, ILE253 and LEU314 as seen from Figure S2 (Supporting\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 8 of 22\ninformation). In cases when amino-acid residues with smaller side chains as THR or CYS and in some cases also ASN are at position 3, they are oriented toward ASN434 and form an H-bond with its main or side chain. Similarly, amino-acid residues with hydrogen bond-donating side chains, such as positively charged ARG and HIS, uncharged ASN, HIS and SER, as well as residues with aromatic hydrophobic side chains (PHE, TYR, and TRP), are the most common residues at position 4. When residues with smaller side chains (THR, CYS, GLY and in some cases also ASN) are present at position 3, that cannot occupy the binding pocket formed by the Fc residues LEU251, MET252, ILE253, GLN311, and LEU315, then it is noticeable that this binding pocket is occupied with the most optimal residues ASN, HIS, PHE, and TRP at position 4, which form an H-bond with carbonyl of the THR250 main chain and aromatic cycle containing residues HIS and TRP, which form \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with HIS435 (Figure 5B). When the pocket is occupied with residues at position 3, the amino-acid residues found at position 4 are the ones with smaller side chains (Figure 5A). The main interaction at the C-end represent H-bonding with the amine of the ILE253 main chain. The ligand backbone forms an H-bond mainly with imidazole nitrogen of HIS435 side chain, amine of ASN434, carbonyl of LEU251 and carbonyl of GLU430 main chains. Although the amino-acid residues binding at the first two positions were similar for all the ligands, some deviated from the presented binding pattern at residues 3 and 4. These include ligands SRKS, CNYA, TNSY, ANKK, AWQN, CCKR and QTNC. Cluster 2 contains 16 tetrapeptides and their general binding mode is presented in Figure 6 by the highest-ranked ligand WKAP.

Residues with a smaller, OH-containing side chain at position 1, such as THR, form an H-bond with main and side chains of ASN434. Residues with H-bond donating side chains, such as positively charged HIS, ARG, and LYS, as well as hydrophobic, aromatic cycle containing TRP at position 2, form an H-bond with the carbonyl of the THR250 main chain in the binding pocket formed by Fc residues LEU251, MET252, ILE253, GLN311, and LEU315. These ligand side chains are also involved in hydrophobic interactions with residues MET252, ILE253 and LEU314. These are the same residues as identified in the binding pocket of cluster 1. Prominent interactions of residues at position 3 (such as LYS and HIS) are \u03c0-\u03c0 or \u03c0-cation interactions with TYR436. Otherwise, positions 3 and 4 contain residues GLY, PRO, and ALA. The N-end forms an H-bond with the amide of the ASN434 side chain and \u03c0-cation interaction with the imidazole of the HIS435 side chain.

Th ligand is shown in dark green ball-stick representation, while the Fc region of the antibody is epicted by a light brown cartoo\nisplaying the major interaction residues in ball-and-stick representation. H-bonds are denoted with yellow dashes.\nAmino-acid residues from the Fc region of IgG antibody that showed the highest number of interactions with the tetrapeptide ligand are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting information) and include hydrogen bond acceptor residues: LEU251, GLN311, ASN434 and HIS435; hydrogen bond donor residues: ILE253, and ASN434; as well as hydrophobic residues: MET252, ILE253, and LEU314. Amino-acid residues that are the most favorable at peptide position 1 contain OH side chains (THR and SER), which form H-bonds with the carbonyl of the LEU251 main chain and/or the amine of the ILE253 side chain. Residues at peptide position 2 (CYS, LYS, a d HIS with uncharged and charged side chains, respectively) donate H into an H-bond with the carbonyl of the THR250 main chain. Thes r sidues are in hydrophobic contact with Fc amino-acid residues MET252, ILE253 and LEU314. The most common residues at position 3 represent residues LYS and GLU with\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 10 of 22\ncharged side chains and SER with an uncharged side chain, while the most common residue at position 4 is TYR with a hydrophobic side chain. Common to all these residues is their ability to donate a hydrogen atom into an H-bond with Fc residues GLN311, ASN315 or GLU430. The N-end forms an H-bond with carbonyls of the LEU251 and/or ASN434 main chains. The C-end conformation is very variable, but most interactions could be identified with the amine of ASN434 main chain. The ligand backbone mainly engages in H-bonding with the carbonyl of the LEU251 main chain and/or the imidazole nitrogen of the HIS435 side chain.

THR250, LEU251, GLU430, LEU432 and ASN434; hydrogen bond donor residues: ASN315, and ASN434; as well as hydrophobic residues: MET252, ILE253, and LEU314. According to ligand-binding modes, residues at position 1 contain smaller side chains with the OH group (SER and THR) that donate hydrogens into H-bonds with the carbonyl of the ASN434 backbone. Hydrogen-donating residues with polar uncharged side chains (SER, THR, ASN) are also present at position 2 and form H-bonding interactions with the carbonyl of the THR250 side chain. Simultaneously, they are in hydrophobic contact with the Fc amino-acid residues MET252, ILE253 and LEU314. When ARG is present at position 2, it rotates and occupies the binding pocket of residues at position 3 in which it forms an H-bond with the carbonyl of the GLU430 main chain. Amino-acid residues at position 3 contain an aromatic system R-group (TYR and HIS) that forms H-bonds with the carbonyl of LEU432 or the amine of the ASN434 main chain. The N-end forms an H-bond with the carbonyls of LEU251 and/or the ASN434 main chain. The C-end interacts with the amide of the ASN315 side chain."

Using\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 12 of 22\nin-house KNIME workflows, we classified AAs according to their side-chain properties. The selected groups were positive (R,H,K), negative (D,E), polar uncharged (S,T,N,Q), hydrophobic (A, V, I, L, M, F, Y, W), cysteine (C), glycine (G) and proline (P). Each of the four positions in the tetrapeptide was examined individually. The results are visualized in Figure 10.

AAs present in less than two ligands were summed and represent the rest group of the pie chart.\nMean descriptor values of the top 100 ranked peptides are similar to the initial combinatorial library reflecting the variety of amino acids in top-scoring peptides; however, histogram skewness hints at a higher representation of larger logP and generally hydrophobic tetrapeptides in the identified enrichment set. In order t elabor te on this observation, an additional set of basic small-molecule descri t rs is depicted in Figure 14. The means of top scorers do not differ significantly from the generated combinatorial library within the examined descriptor set. The major observed difference is the larger number of rings (rings present in histidine, proline, tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine) and the expected lowering of polar surface area due to the positions 2 and 4. As di cussed before, position 1 is predominantly occupied by uncharged residues with the ability to donate hydrogen bonds. A slight trend of lower molecular weight and number of heavy atoms is also present with the top 10 scorers pointing to lower molecular weights and a larger number of hydrogen atoms relative to heavy atoms present for these ligands. This allows the atoms to form a greater number of hydrogen bonds, a fact backed up by the larger number of hydrogen donors found for both the top 100 and top 10.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 15 of 22 Pharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 16\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a013.\u00a0Histograms\u00a0of\u00a0net\u00a0charge\u00a0(the\u00a0average\u00a0of\u00a00.313;\u00a0net\u00a0charge\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0pka\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0 amino\u00a0acid\u00a0at\u00a0pH\u00a0=\u00a07),\u00a0molecular\u00a0weight\u00a0(the\u00a0average\u00a0of\u00a0481.7\u00a0g/mol),\u00a0Crippen\u00a0logP\u00a0(average\u00a0\u22122.120;\u00a0 estimation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0octanol/water\u00a0partition\u00a0coefficient\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0Ghose/Crippen\u00a0approach\u00a0available\u00a0in\u00a0 the\u00a0RDKit\u00a0project)\u00a0and\u00a0Eisenberg\u2019s\u00a0hydrophobicity\u00a0(the\u00a0average\u00a0of\u00a0\u22120.311;\u00a0calculated\u00a0by\u00a0averaging\u00a0 the\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0amino\u00a0acid\u00a0hydrophobicity\u00a0value\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Eisenberg\u00a0scale)\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0100\u00a0ranked\u00a0 tetrapeptides.\u00a0\nMean\u00a0descriptor\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0100\u00a0ranked\u00a0peptides\u00a0are\u00a0similar\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0initial\u00a0combinatorial\u00a0library\u00a0reflecting\u00a0the\u00a0variety\u00a0of\u00a0amino\u00a0acids\u00a0in\u00a0top-scoring\u00a0peptides;\u00a0however,\u00a0 histogram\u00a0skewness\u00a0hints\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0higher\u00a0representation\u00a0of\u00a0larger\u00a0logP\u00a0and\u00a0generally\u00a0hydrophobic\u00a0tetrapeptides\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0identified\u00a0enrichment\u00a0set.\u00a0In\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0elaborate\u00a0on\u00a0this\u00a0observation,\u00a0an\u00a0additional\u00a0set\u00a0of\u00a0basic\u00a0small-molecule\u00a0descriptors\u00a0is\u00a0depicted\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a014.\u00a0The\u00a0 means\u00a0of\u00a0top\u00a0scorers\u00a0do\u00a0not\u00a0differ\u00a0significantly\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0generated\u00a0combinatorial\u00a0library\u00a0 within\u00a0the\u00a0examined\u00a0descriptor\u00a0set.\u00a0The\u00a0major\u00a0observed\u00a0difference\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0larger\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0 rings\u00a0(rings\u00a0present\u00a0in\u00a0histidine,\u00a0proline,\u00a0tyrosine,\u00a0tryptophan\u00a0and\u00a0phenylalanine)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 expected\u00a0lowering\u00a0of\u00a0polar\u00a0surface\u00a0area\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0positions\u00a02\u00a0and\u00a04.\u00a0As\u00a0discussed\u00a0before,\u00a0 position\u00a01\u00a0 is\u00a0predominantly\u00a0occupied\u00a0by\u00a0uncharged\u00a0residues\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ability\u00a0to\u00a0donate\u00a0 hydrogen\u00a0bonds.\u00a0A\u00a0slight\u00a0trend\u00a0of\u00a0lower\u00a0molecular\u00a0weight\u00a0and\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0heavy\u00a0atoms\u00a0is\u00a0 also\u00a0present\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a010\u00a0scorers\u00a0pointing\u00a0to\u00a0lower\u00a0molecular\u00a0weights\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0larger\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0atoms\u00a0relative\u00a0to\u00a0heavy\u00a0atoms\u00a0present\u00a0for\u00a0these\u00a0ligands.\u00a0This\u00a0allows\u00a0the\u00a0 atoms\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0a\u00a0greater\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0bonds,\u00a0a\u00a0fact\u00a0backed\u00a0up\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0larger\u00a0number\u00a0 of\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0donors\u00a0found\u00a0for\u00a0both\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0100\u00a0and\u00a0top\u00a010.\u00a0\ni r . ist r s f t r (t r e f . ; t r s l s f a ino acid at pH = 7), molecular weight (the average of 481.7 g/mol), Crippen logP (average \u22122.120; estimation of the octanol/water partition coefficient using the Ghose/Crippen approach available in the RDKit project) and Eisenberg\u2019s hydrophobicity (the average of \u22120.311; calculated by averaging the values of each amino acid hydrophobicity value from the Eisenberg scale) for the top 100 ranked tetrapeptides.\nThe general descriptor set mean similarities point to the fact that the spatial orientation or the unique sequence position of amino acids within the tetrapeptide are more important than general physio-chemical properties when it comes to binding affinity. This observation could help in developing future peptide drug design knowledge-based molecular filters, where one should employ a peptide-specific and position-oriented filtering pipeline instead of employing general a small-molecule-oriented filtering pipeline as is often seen in the scientific literature [56]. The CmDock identified preferred amino-acid positions of the top-scoring tetrapeptides are in accordance with the ones reported by the work of Bratkovic\u030c et al. and observations made by DeLano et al. [3,61]. The peptide ligand GSYWYQVWF identified from a combinatorial phage-display library screen possesses glycine at the first position, an amino-acid residue with an uncharged side chain that can donate hydrogen atoms into a hydrogen bond. Serine at the second position acts as a small uncharged amino-acid residue capable of engaging in hydrogen-bond interactions. Tyrosine and tryptophan at the third and fourth position, both aromatic amino acids, are also present in cluster 1 and responsible for forming interactions with the described Fc region binding pocket. Our identified cluster 1 incorporates similar motifs to the identified peptides by Bratkovic\u030c et al. and the cluster contains some of the highest-scoring tetrapeptides [3]. In an additional comparison of our results with the tetrapeptide docking study performed by Fang et al. [62], we again observe the presence of larger hydrophobic residues at multiple positions (identified tetrapeptide YEHF); however, comparison cannot be fully made due to selection of AAs from six \u201ccritical\u201d residues made by Fang et al. (Phe, Tyr, Leu, Glu, Ile, Lys) with one additional histidine incorporated for experimental peptide purification. The similarity of our top tetrapeptide hit GSVW and common amino-acid motifs in top 10 scorers is presented in Figure 15.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 16 of 22r e ti l \u00a0 ,\u00a0 ,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 17\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a014.\u00a0Comparison\u00a0of\u00a0basic\u00a0descriptors\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0entire\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0library\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0100\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0 as\u00a0top\u00a010\u00a0scoring\u00a0ligands.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Total\u00a0polar\u00a0surface\u00a0area;\u00a0(B)\u00a0Molecular\u00a0weight\u00a0reference;\u00a0(C)\u00a0Number\u00a0 of\u00a0 rings\u00a0 (rings\u00a0present\u00a0 in\u00a0proline,\u00a0histidine,\u00a0phenylalanine,\u00a0 tyrosine,\u00a0 tryptophan);\u00a0 (D)\u00a0Hydrogen\u00a0 bond\u00a0donors;\u00a0(E)\u00a0Hydrogen\u00a0bond\u00a0acceptors;\u00a0(F)\u00a0Number\u00a0of\u00a0heavy\u00a0atoms.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0general\u00a0descriptor\u00a0set\u00a0mean\u00a0similarities\u00a0point\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0fact\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0spatial\u00a0orientation\u00a0or\u00a0the\u00a0unique\u00a0sequence\u00a0position\u00a0of\u00a0amino\u00a0acids\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0are\u00a0more\u00a0important\u00a0than\u00a0general\u00a0physio-chemical\u00a0properties\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0to\u00a0binding\u00a0affinity.\u00a0This\u00a0 observation\u00a0could\u00a0help\u00a0in\u00a0developing\u00a0future\u00a0peptide\u00a0drug\u00a0design\u00a0knowledge-based\u00a0molecular\u00a0filters,\u00a0where\u00a0one\u00a0should\u00a0employ\u00a0a\u00a0peptide-specific\u00a0and\u00a0position-oriented\u00a0filtering\u00a0 pipeline\u00a0 instead\u00a0of\u00a0employing\u00a0general\u00a0a\u00a0small-molecule-oriented\u00a0filtering\u00a0pipeline\u00a0as\u00a0 is\u00a0 often\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0scientific\u00a0literature\u00a0[56].\u00a0 The\u00a0CmDock\u00a0identified\u00a0preferred\u00a0amino-acid\u00a0positions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0top-scoring\u00a0tetrapeptides\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ones\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0work\u00a0of\u00a0Bratkovi\u010d\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0and\u00a0observations\u00a0made\u00a0by\u00a0DeLano\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0[3,61].\u00a0The\u00a0peptide\u00a0ligand\u00a0GSYWYQVWF\u00a0identified\u00a0from\u00a0 a\u00a0combinatorial\u00a0phage-display\u00a0 library\u00a0 screen\u00a0possesses\u00a0glycine\u00a0at\u00a0 the\u00a0first\u00a0position,\u00a0an\u00a0 amino-acid\u00a0residue\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0uncharged\u00a0side\u00a0chain\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0donate\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0atoms\u00a0into\u00a0a\u00a0 hydrogen\u00a0bond.\u00a0Serine\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0second\u00a0position\u00a0acts\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0small\u00a0uncharged\u00a0amino-acid\u00a0residue\u00a0capable\u00a0of\u00a0engaging\u00a0in\u00a0hydrogen-bond\u00a0interactions.\u00a0Tyrosine\u00a0and\u00a0tryptophan\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0 third\u00a0and\u00a0 fourth\u00a0position,\u00a0both\u00a0aromatic\u00a0amino\u00a0acids,\u00a0are\u00a0also\u00a0present\u00a0 in\u00a0cluster\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a0 responsible\u00a0 for\u00a0 forming\u00a0 interactions\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0described\u00a0Fc\u00a0 region\u00a0binding\u00a0pocket.\u00a0Our\u00a0 identified\u00a0cluster\u00a01\u00a0incorporates\u00a0similar\u00a0motifs\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0identified\u00a0peptides\u00a0by\u00a0Bratkovi\u010d\u00a0et\u00a0 al.\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0cluster\u00a0contains\u00a0some\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0highest-scoring\u00a0tetrapeptides\u00a0[3].\u00a0In\u00a0an\u00a0additional\u00a0 comparison\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0results\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0docking\u00a0study\u00a0performed\u00a0by\u00a0Fang\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0\ni re 14.

We can observe that our identified top hit peptides can effectively mimic the binding of the protein A mini Z domain to the Fc reg on of the antibody. In Figure 16, th topscoring tetrapeptid GSVW can be seen with its N-end at the His residue of the protein A mini Z domain, S effe tiv ly supplementing the Tyr OH group and a two-amino-acid hydrophobic end with analogous positioning of tetrapeptide Trp 4 into the bi ding pocket for the protein A mini Z domain Phe 14 residue (position 9 of the mini Z domain sequence: FNMQCQRRFYEALH DPNL NEEQRNAKIKSIRDDC with helix-turn-helix secondary structure). We observed that our peptide compounds can extend toward TYR436 and form mainly hydrophobic interactions, therefore prolonging the tetrapeptide into a pentapeptide, which could also lead us to target TYR436 and elaborate all subsequent positions. Attaching aromatic (PHE, TYR, TRP) or charged (ARG, HIS, LYS) residues at position 5 could be beneficial for the formation of \u03c0-\u03c0 and cation-\u03c0 interactions, respectively, which effectively corresponds to the experimentally observed structures and validates our protocol for potential applications on alternative targets.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 17 of 22\nPharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 18\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\n[62],\u00a0we\u00a0again\u00a0observe\u00a0the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0larger\u00a0hydrophobic\u00a0residues\u00a0at\u00a0multiple\u00a0positions\u00a0 (identified\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0YEHF);\u00a0however,\u00a0comparison\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0fully\u00a0made\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0selection\u00a0of\u00a0AAs\u00a0from\u00a0six\u00a0\u201ccritical\u201d\u00a0residues\u00a0made\u00a0by\u00a0Fang\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0(Phe,\u00a0Tyr,\u00a0Leu,\u00a0Glu,\u00a0Ile,\u00a0Lys)\u00a0 with\u00a0one\u00a0additional\u00a0histidine\u00a0incorporated\u00a0for\u00a0experimental\u00a0peptide\u00a0purification.\u00a0The\u00a0similarity\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0top\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0hit\u00a0GSVW\u00a0and\u00a0common\u00a0amino-acid\u00a0motifs\u00a0in\u00a0top\u00a010\u00a0scorers\u00a0 is\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a015.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a015.\u00a0Amino-acid\u00a0sidechain\u00a0property\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0top-scoring\u00a0tetrapeptides\u00a0[3,61].\u00a0\nPharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 19\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 18 of 22\nPharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 19\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a016.\u00a0(A):\u00a0Binding\u00a0mode\u00a0of\u00a0protein\u00a0A.\u00a0The\u00a0protein\u00a0A\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0orange\u00a0ball-and-stick\u00a0repre-\nsentation,\u00a0while\u00a0 the\u00a0Fc\u00a0region\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0antibody\u00a0 is\u00a0denoted\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0 light\u00a0brown\u00a0cartoon\u00a0depicting\u00a0 the\u00a0\nmajor\u00a0 interaction\u00a0 residues\u00a0 in\u00a0 ball-and-stick\u00a0 representation.\u00a0H-bonds\u00a0 are\u00a0delineated\u00a0with\u00a0 yellow\u00a0\ndashes.\u00a0(B):\u00a0Superposition\u00a0of\u00a0protein\u00a0A\u00a0mini\u00a0Z\u00a0domain\u00a0binding\u00a0mode\u00a0is\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0yellow\u00a0cartoon\u00a0\nand\u00a0emphasizes\u00a0the\u00a0binding\u00a0of\u00a0amino-acid\u00a0residues\u00a0in\u00a0ball-and-stick\u00a0representation\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0top-\nscoring\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0GSVW\u00a0in\u00a0green\u00a0stick\u00a0representation.\u00a0An\u00a0analogous\u00a0positioning\u00a0of\u00a0peptide\u00a0Trp4\u00a0\nto\u00a0the\u00a0mini\u00a0Z\u00a0domain\u00a0Phe14\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0observed.\u00a0\nWe\u00a0can\u00a0observe\u00a0that\u00a0our\u00a0identified\u00a0top\u00a0hit\u00a0peptides\u00a0can\u00a0effectively\u00a0mimic\u00a0the\u00a0binding\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0protein\u00a0A\u00a0mini\u00a0Z\u00a0domain\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Fc\u00a0region\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0antibody.\u00a0In\u00a0Figure\u00a016,\u00a0the\u00a0topscoring\u00a0tetrapeptide\u00a0GSVW\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0seen\u00a0with\u00a0its\u00a0N\u2010end\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0His\u00a0residue\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0protein\u00a0A\u00a0"

The goal was to prioritize tetrapeptides and enrich the generated library towards tetrapeptides capable of forming meaningful interactions with the Fc region of the antibody. CmDock is an in-house developed opensource docking software fitted for extended sampling (via number of GA runs parameter) and its current CPU implementation is ideally suitable for parallel deployment on HPC resources [60]. We used the experimental crystallized antibody IgG1 Fc system (PDB ID: 5U52; excellent resolution of 1.94 \u00c5) with co-crystallized 2 helix minimized version of the B-domain from protein A ligand (Mini Z domain; KD value of mini Z domain was determined at 25 nM using surface plasmon resonance) and prepared the system applying chains A and E (according to temperature factors) with Yasara Structure software [55]. We defined the docking grid of 4 \u00c5 around the large reference ligand heavy atoms using following parameters: RbtLigandSiteMapper, radius 4.0, small_sphere 1.0, min_volume 100, max_cavities 1, vol_incr 0.0, and gridstep 0.5. Explicit water molecules were not considered during molecular docking. With 100 runs utilizing DOCK.prm settings, we applied a sample technique that included three stages of genetic algorithm search, lowtemperature Monte Carlo, and simplex minimization phases, as well as scoring using the rDOCK (SF3) scoring function [31]. We employed 100 runs as a comprehensive sampling parameter where suitable docking calculation times can be achieved with converging average docking scores. However, upon average INTER.SCORE convergence analysis on random 0.001 samples, we also advocate the use of larger-run ensembles, especially if longer calculation times per peptide are feasible and larger peptides are being studied. The sampling and scoring were validated against protein [31,63] and RNA [31,64] targets, and their performance was superior to similar open-source software [32]. We applied the receptor flexibility parameter (RECEPTOR_FLEX 3.0) to activate sampling of terminal OH and NH3+ groups in the 3 \u00c5 vicinity of the docking site. The docking results were investigated using PyMOL, in-house developed scripts, and Konstanz information miner (KNIME) software [65].\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1170 19 of 22"

            "text": "We performed a high-throughput virtual screening campaign on the Fc region of an IgG antibody using CmDock and an unbiased combinatorial tetrapeptide library. We compared the consensus of obtained data with the experimental results of Bratkovic\u030c et al. [14]. We were able to validate the proposed protocol and identify similar amino-acid motifs as beforehand reported experimentally. Our top-scored tetrapeptide GSVW motif can be clearly identified in the GSYWYQVWF peptide by Bratkovic\u030c et al. and further peptide evolution using docking studies with even greater sampling populations in CmDock should be able to address the design of larger peptides where additional protein-folding problems occur. We firmly believe that this approach represents a useful tool for future peptide elongation studies. Specifically, we aim at employing enriched hit-libraries of smaller peptides to be evolved, rather than employing outright combinatorial libraries of final-length peptides as demonstrated by this work. Research on small peptides can afford valuable probes and/or leads to design peptide mimetics, or one can use their pharmacophoric profiles to identify novel drug-like moieties that can utilize identified interactions [66]. In addition, their synthesizability potential places them firmly as affinity research tools to explore novel binding sites or modes of action.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16081170/s1, Figure S1: Showing a representative compound with its binding pose for each of 5 clusters.
