    "abstractText": "Background Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an under-recognized complication of several chemotherapy agents used as part of curative-intent therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). In the absence of validated selfor proxy-report measures for children and adolescents, CIPN reporting has relied on clinician rating, with grading scales often restricted to severe manifestations. In a proof-of-concept study, we assessed the feasibility and psychometric performance of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-Ntx), a unidimensional CIPN symptom scale widely used adults with CIPN, in pediatric HL at risk for CIPN. Methods Youth (11+ years) and parents of all children (5\u201317.9 years) with newly diagnosed high-risk HL enrolled on Children\u2019s Oncology Group AHOD1331 (NCT02166463) were invited to complete the FACT-GOG-Ntx and a healthrelated quality of life (HRQL) measure at pre-treatment (Time 1), and during cycles 2 (Time 2) and 5 (Time 3) of chemotherapy during the first half of study accrual. Clinical grading of CIPN by providers was also assessed using the Balis Pediatric Neuropathy Scale. We evaluated Cronbach\u2019s alpha, construct validity, and agreement between raters. Change in FACT-GOG-Ntx scores over time was assessed using a repeated measures model. Results 306 patients had at least one completed FACT-GOG-Ntx with time-specific completion rates of > 90% for both raters. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was > 0.7 for youth and parent-proxy report at all time points. Correlations between FACT-GOG-Ntx and HRQL scores were moderate (0.41\u20130.48) for youth and parent-proxy raters across all times. Youth and parent-proxy raters both reported worse FACT-GOG-Ntx scores at Time 3 for those who had clinically-reported CIPN compared to those who did not. Agreement between raters was moderate to high. Compared to baseline scores, those at Time 3 were significantly lower for youth (\u03b2 = \u2212 2.83, p < 0.001) and parent-proxy raters (\u03b2 = \u2212 1.99, p < 0.001). Co-first author: Susan K.

Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes (2023) 7:113 Conclusions High completion rates at all time points indicated feasibility of eliciting youth and parent report. Psychometric performance of the FACT-GOG-Ntx revealed acceptable reliability, evidence of validity, and strong inter-rater agreement, supporting the use of this selfor proxy-reported measure of CIPN in youth with high-risk HL exposed to tubulin inhibitors, as part of a Phase 3 clinical trial.

Clinical grading of CIPN by providers was also assessed using the Balis Pediatric Neuropathy Scale. We evaluated Cronbach\u2019s alpha, construct validity, and agreement between raters. Change in FACT-GOG-Ntx scores over time was assessed using a repeated measures model.\nResults 306 patients had at least one completed FACT-GOG-Ntx with time-specific completion rates of > 90% for both raters. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was > 0.7 for youth and parent-proxy report at all time points. Correlations between FACT-GOG-Ntx and HRQL scores were moderate (0.41\u20130.48) for youth and parent-proxy raters across all times. Youth and parent-proxy raters both reported worse FACT-GOG-Ntx scores at Time 3 for those who had clinically-reported CIPN compared to those who did not. Agreement between raters was moderate to high. Compared to baseline scores, those at Time 3 were significantly lower for youth (\u03b2 = \u2212 2.83, p < 0.001) and parent-proxy raters (\u03b2 = \u2212 1.99, p < 0.001).\n\u2020Co-first author: Susan K.

            "text": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has been associated with several widely used chemotherapy regimens and is often under-recognized [1]. CIPN involves three principal manifestations: sensory; motor; and autonomic [2]. Manifestations vary by drug class, cumulative exposure, and genetic predisposition [3, 4]. CIPN has been shown to have negative effects on healthrelated quality of life (HRQL) in several disease populations. [5\u20137]\nCIPN reporting in children and adolescents with cancer has historically relied on provider report using clinical toxicity grading scales, including the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [8]. More recently, trials have also used the Balis Pediatric Scale of neuropathy [9], which is similar to CTCAE; both rely on clinician appraisal of the patient by examination and/or history. These approaches have been found to have variable degrees of inter-rater reliability, a narrow grading range, limited responsiveness to change, and substantial floor effects [2, 9]. To date there have been no validated pediatric patient-reported measures of CIPN. In contrast, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity symptom scale (FACT-GOG-Ntx), a validated 11-item self-report measure of CIPN, has been used to measure patient self-reported CIPN in several adult cancers [10, 11]. It has been shown to have strong psychometric properties, including responsiveness to change over time [12\u201316].\nDespite the use of vinca alkaloids in many pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) regimens, the incidence, prevalence and trajectory of CIPN has not been extensively studied in children with HL [17]. In recent studies in adult HL patients, CIPN was recognized as a side effect of both vinblastine and Brentuximab vedotin (BV), a novel anti-CD30 antibody linked to the anti-microtubular agent, monomethyl auristatin-E (MMAE). MMAE binds to tubulin and prevents microtubule assembly, leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death. Both vinca alkaloids and BV interfere with axonal polymerization. In the 2013 report of a Phase 1 dose escalation study of BV in adult patients with newly diagnosed HL, 75% of patients\ndeveloped CIPN, although most of these events were Grade 1 or 2 and manageable by dose modification [18]. This compares to rates of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy of 35\u201345% across all grades [19]. In the recent AHOD0831 and AHOD0031 protocols from the Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG), < 5% of pediatric/ adolescent patients developed Grade 3 or higher vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy, based on clinical grading scales. Rates of mild to moderate CIPN (\u2264 Grade 2) were not routinely collected [20, 21], and validated tools to measure patient report of CIPN have been lacking [22] in younger patients. While younger children may not possess the vocabulary with which to describe their symptoms, we posit that older children and adolescents are likely to be capable of providing self-report, using existing validated measures.\nIn a proof-of-concept study using youth and parentproxy report, we assessed the psychometric properties of the FACT-GOG-Ntx in a Phase 3 clinical trial of pediatric patients with previously untreated high-risk HL, in which tubulin inhibitors were used as part of multi-agent therapy for high-risk HL; we compared rates of CIPN to those obtained from serial clinician grading as well as between raters (youth vs. parent)."

Eligibility included newly diagnosed high-risk classic HL, defined as Ann Arbor stages IIB with bulk, IIIB or IV (A or B). Patients were not eligible if they had nodular lymphocyte predominant HL, were pregnant, had a known immunodeficiency, or had received systemic corticosteroids within 28\u00a0 days of enrollment. Patients 11\u00a0years of age and older at enrollment and parents of children 5\u201317.9 were also invited to participate in a patient-reported outcomes (PRO) prespecified secondary study aim, which included the serial completion of study measures. PRO collection was not an eligibility criterion for the trial participation. The planned enrollment on the PRO study, completed by September 8,\n2017, was restricted to the first half of the trial accrual. Of note, the trial originally was designed for patients up to 18.9\u00a0 years of age, but in August 2017, the upper age limit was amended to 21.9\u00a0 years. Based on closure of recruitment to the PRO study in September 2017, only a small number of participants over 18\u00a0years were eligible."

Vincristine was administered at 1.4\u00a0mg/m2/dose (max 2.4\u00a0mg/dose) on days 1 and 8 on Arm 1, and only on day 8 of each treatment cycle in the experimental arm. BV was given at 1.8\u00a0mg/kg (maximum dose 180\u00a0mg) on day 1 of each cycle only on Arm 2. The protocol contained specific guidelines for dose modification for each of the tubulin toxins in the setting of emergent CIPN, described elsewhere [24].\nThe protocol was reviewed and approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Pediatric Central Institutional Review Board (cIRB) and the local IRBs per institutional policies of participating sites.

Of note, parent proxies were not asked to project how they thought their child would rate CIPN symptoms, but rather, based their ratings on their own observations. Results collected at baseline and the two on-treatment assessments are summarized in this report. Given the exploratory use of the measure in younger children, patients aged 5\u201310.9\u00a0 years were assessed only by their parent proxy raters, while patients aged 18\u201321.9 were only assessed by the youth themselves. The demographics assessment was completed at baseline by the participating parent. For each measure where dual rating was collected, there was a \u2018youth\u2019 version and a parentproxy version. Instruments were available in English and in Spanish.\nAll measures were completed on paper, primarily at the time of regularly scheduled clinic visits. Completed measures were de-identified by the site clinical research assistant and then scanned into the Medidata Rave data\nmanagement system, used by COG. The questionnaire was then downloaded by a study-specific research assistant, who entered responses directly into a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [25, 26] database for further analysis."

The rationale for assessment at two on-treatment time points was to capture early onset CIPN (Time 2) and the pattern of change or worsening over time at the peak cumulative dose for the tubulin inhibitors by cycle 5. The Time 3 assessment was designed to capture the anticipated peak of CIPN temporally associated with the dose density peak exposure of both BV and vincristine.\nThe voice of the measure (\u201cI\u201d to \u201cmy child\u201d) was modified for parent-proxy reporting in collaboration with instrument author (DC). Item wording was not otherwise changed to allow for comparisons with other studies. The preferred timing of assessment was coincident with an in-person clinic visit to enable concurrent reporting of clinical grading of neuropathy by the clinician. The measure\u2019s item content is presented in Appendix Table\u00a06.\nThe FACT-GOG-Ntx utilizes a 5-point, Likert-style response scale for each item with a one-week reference period. The FACT-GOG-Ntx is a unidimensional scale, yielding a total symptom score [12, 27], ranging from 0 to 44 in which higher scores indicated better functioning (less impairment). In practice, several investigators have also used a \u201cshort form\u201d version of the measure, restricted to four items about sensory neuropathy [27]; sensory subscale scores ranged from 0 to 16. At least half of the items in the scale needed to be completed for it to be scored (50% rule). Previous studies have demonstrated that a change of 1/3 standard deviations (SD) on the total score [28] and a 1-point change on the sensory subscale score was clinically significant. [27]"

We described the full study population of AHOD1331 and then separately introduced those enrolled and not enrolled in the PRO cohort. Chi-square tests were used to compare the characteristics between the two groups. Mean scale scores and SDs were calculated for the 11-item FACT-GOG-Ntx, 4-item FACT-GOG-Ntx sensory subscale (FACT-GOG-Ntx-4), and CHRIsGlobal by time point and rater, using established scoring algorithms.\nThe psychometric performance of the FACT-GOGNtx and FACT-GOG-Ntx-4 scales was evaluated among youth and proxy raters at the three time points (unless otherwise specified). Internal consistency reliability was calculated as Cronbach\u2019s alpha. The minimum acceptable criterion for Cronbach\u2019s alpha is 0.70 [30]. To assess construct validity, we calculated correlations between the FACT-GOG-Ntx, FACT-GOG-Ntx-4, and CHRIsGlobal. Correlations < 0.29 were considered small, 0.3\u2013 0.59 moderate, and > 0.6 strong. Construct validity was also assessed by comparing FACT-GOG-Ntx and FACTGOG-Ntx-4 at Time 3 by whether or not the patient had any clinically-reported CIPN (defined as > 0 score on Balis) by Time 3; two-sample t-tests were used to determine statistical significance.\nAgreement between youth and parent-proxy report of the FACT-GOG-Ntx at all time periods was calculated using established methods [31]. Between-subject variation assessed the agreement between the youth and parent-proxy assessment of the patient compared to the group average. Strong correlations of between-subject variation indicate both observers consistently identified the patient as having higher or lower scores than the average patient. Within-subject variation assessed the agreement between youth and parent-proxy assessment of the patient over time. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to measure the correlation of scores within observer within time. These correlations were estimated using mixed effect models; 95% confidence intervals were estimated using 500 bootstrap samples. This analysis was restricted to patients who were eligible to have both youth and parent-proxy report (youth aged 11 to 17.9\u00a0years). Agreement between youth and parent-proxy report was also calculated separately\nfor patients with any clinician-graded CIPN by Time 3 on the Balis scale.\nTo assess change in FACT-GOG-Ntx scores over time, we fit a repeated measures model (proc mixed). This analysis was restricted to patients who were eligible to have both youth and parent-proxy report (youth aged 11\u201317.9\u00a0 years). The model included assessment time, which was treated as categorical to allow for non-linearity, rater (youth or parent-proxy), continuous youth age in years, and gender (male or female). These baseline demographic variables were selected based on their hypothesized relationship with PROs. Interactions between rater and time and rater and youth age were also assessed and included in the model if p < 0.1. This model assumes that data are missing at random. Unstructured, autoregressive, and compound symmetry covariance structures were considered and selected based on convergence and the lowest Akaike Information Criteria; unstructured had the best fit. Model assumptions, including normality of residuals and linearity of continuous variables, were assessed with plots of residuals.\nAnalyses were done using SAS software Version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA) and a two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used."

Participation at study entry was high (97%), as was retention of participants in the PRO measurement cohort throughout treatment (> 90%). We observed the lowest FACT-GOG-Ntx scores, reflecting the highest patient burden of neuropathy by Time 3, hypothesized to be the peak effect time based on the cumulative dose of tubulin inhibitor therapy.\nThe FACT-GOG-Ntx total scale demonstrated adequate reliability, as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha, construct validity based on correlations with the CHRIsGlobal measure of HRQL, and meaningful differences in scores by evidence of clinically-reported CIPN. Our findings on the psychometric performance of these scales are similar to that in adult populations [12, 27].\nIn the pediatric oncology setting, both youth selfreport and parent-proxy report provide complementary information about the patient\u2019s experience [31], heretofore often absent from clinical trials [32]. Among youth who are able to complete PROs on their own behalf, the parent-proxy report may be confirmatory or divergent, depending on access to information and how it is evaluated by the proxy (information or criterion variance). Our study found no statistically significant differences in FACT-GOG-Ntx scores by rater, and we found moderate to strong agreement between raters. Therefore, in future studies, collecting information from only the youth selfreport may be adequate to characterize the patient experience of CIPN while limiting additional burden on the parent. Among younger children who may be unable to complete PROs on their own behalf, the parent-proxy provides the only source of information, which should be reported to the provider and thereby inform clinical grading of CIPN.\nFACT-GOG-Ntx scores range from 0-44, while the FACT-GOG-Ntx-4 Sensory Subscale Score range from 0-16. Higher scores on both scales indicates less symptoms. Youth report is for patients aged 11-21.9 years; parent proxy report is for youth 5 to 17.9 years"

We found statistically significant and clinically significant differences in scores as reported by both raters. For example, youth without clinical evidence of CIPN had a mean FACT-GOG-Ntx score of 39.3 compared to a mean of 33.0 among youth with clinically-reported reported CIPN. The difference of six points corresponds to > 1 standard deviation difference, which far exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of 1/3 SD previously reported for this scale [28]. In addition, FACT-GOG-Ntx scores worsened throughout the course of therapy, as the cumulative incidence of CIPN increased.\nThe strengths of the study include the use of an established and well-validated measure of CIPN in adults applied in an at-risk pediatric population. Serial completion rates of the PROs were high, despite initial high-risk disease and intensity of treatment, and the opt-in nature of participation. Further, the PRO cohort did not differ from the non-PRO cohort on patient- or disease-level characteristics, suggesting that study findings could be generalized to the entire study population and demonstrated the pre-determined statistical capacity to limit this sub-study to half the trial enrollment cohort.\nWe also acknowledge study limitations. Given the adolescent age of the study population and the measure\u2019s simplicity of language, we elected not to conduct cognitive interviewing or replicate the underlying factor structure of the FACT-GOG-Ntx in this trial. Previous psychometric evaluation of the measure over the past 20\u00a0years supports its total score through strong item-total correlations [13, 33]. In this study, our goal was to demonstrate that it would be possible to collect patient-reported CIPN symptoms in the trial setting, setting the stage for future comparisons across age groups, such as in the recently accrued SWOG-led S1826 trial of adolescents, young adults, and older adults with newly diagnosed advanced stage HL (NCT03907488). In the S1826 study, tubulin toxins were again used; participant-reported CIPN using the FACT-GOG-Ntx was successfully collected from all participants 12\u00a0years of age and older over time. In future studies involving younger patients, however, we would encourage investigators to utilize cognitive interviewing to ensure meaning of individual items.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the FACT-GOG-Ntx in assessing CIPN in older youth with high-risk HL, exposed to tubulin toxins. The strength of its performance suggests that this measure should be considered in future trials to characterize CIPN and its functional consequences, the latter measured by the parallel collection of HRQL. Given the lack of apparent participant burden, as evinced by high\ncompletion rates, we would recommend the use of the 11-item FACT-GOG-Ntx measure, rather than just the use of the 4-item subscale score, providing greater reliability and construct validity of CIPN among at-risk patients."
