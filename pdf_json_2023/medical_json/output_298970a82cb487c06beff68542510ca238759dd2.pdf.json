We examined how inequalities in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death related to COVID-19 by country of birth have evolved over the course of the pandemic, while considering the contribution of social conditions and vaccination uptake. A population-based cohort study was conducted including adults living in Sweden betweenMarch 1, 2020 and June 1, 2022 (n = 7,870,441). Poisson regressions found that migrants from Africa, Middle East, Asia and European countries without EU28/EEA, UK and Switzerland had higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and ICU admission than Swedish-born. High risks of COVID-19 ICU admission was also found in migrants from South America. Inequalities were generally reduced through subsequent waves of the pandemic. In many migrant groups socioeconomic status and living conditions contributed to the disparities while vaccination campaigns were decisive when such became available.",

Ju\u00e1rez1,2\nMigrants have been more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether this has varied over the course of the pandemic remains unknown. We examined how inequalities in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death related to COVID-19 by country of birth have evolved over the course of the pandemic, while considering the contribution of social conditions and vaccination uptake. A population-based cohort study was conducted including adults living in Sweden betweenMarch 1, 2020 and June 1, 2022 (n = 7,870,441). Poisson regressions found that migrants from Africa, Middle East, Asia and European countries without EU28/EEA, UK and Switzerland had higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and ICU admission than Swedish-born. High risks of COVID-19 ICU admission was also found in migrants from South America. Inequalities were generally reduced through subsequent waves of the pandemic. In many migrant groups socioeconomic status and living conditions contributed to the disparities while vaccination campaigns were decisive when such became available.\nThe risk of COVID-19 infection, disease and death has not been equally distributed across ethnic, racial and migrant groups during the pandemic. A number of studies have found higher risks of COVID-19 infection, mortality and severe morbidity in ethnic minorities and migrants in Sweden1\u20133 and elsewhere4\u201311. Most of the previous evidence has so far covered specific phases of the pandemic, predominantly the initial one1,2. Few studies have been able to provide evidence that encompasses\u2014and differentiates between\u2014major phases of the pandemic. This is relevant because the pandemic has been characterized by different waves, dominated by variants of the virus such as Delta or Omicron. COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths have varied markedly within and across waves12,13.\nIt has been argued that migrants could be at higher risk of exposure to the virus due to adverse social and living environments1,2,14. Indeed, studies have shown that socioeconomic status and living conditions can at least partially account for the disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality by country of birth1,2,9,11,15. In later waves, studies have recorded lower vaccination uptake among migrants16. While\nvaccinations have been decisive for overall rates of severe illness and death, the contribution of the vaccination uptake in relation to the migrant-Swedish born inequalities remain unexplored.\nImproving knowledge on the determinants contributing to COVID-19 disparities in infections, mortality and severe disease by country of birth is essential for designing preventive measures to reduce such disparities in future pandemics or health crisis. The aim of this paper is to examine how inequalities in hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death related to COVID-19 between migrants and Swedish born have evolved over the course of the pandemic, while also considering the contribution of vaccination uptake to these differences."

When adjusted for age and sex the rates for ICU admissions are still highest for individuals born in the Middle East (177.8), but individuals from Africa (166.7) and Asia (157.2) have the next highest, while the highest age and sex standardized rates for COVID-19 mortality is now also found for individuals born in the Middle East (265.4) and Africa (220.9). Table 2 shows the distribution of the adult population across sociodemographic variables including living conditions and vaccination status at the end of follow-up. Here one can see that many migrant groups have lower socioeconomic status, live in crowded apartments, in more densely populated neighborhoods, and have lower vaccination uptake than the Swedish born. Individuals from Africa and the Middle East have lower levels of education (31.1% and 26.2% have primary school education compared to Sweden 14.7%), lower incomes (42.1% and 37.4% in the lowest, 0\u201324 income quartile compared to Sweden 23.1%), and more often work in broad skill level 1-Elementary occupations (12.3% and 7% compared to Sweden 2.7%). The majority live in apartments (83.7% and 72% compared to Sweden 39.0%), in crowded conditions (59.3% and 50.1% in the lowest quartile of living area per person compared to Sweden 13.4%) and in densely populated neighborhoods (42.9% and 35.2% in the highest quintile compared to Sweden 18.3%). The proportionate differences are similar in many of the other migrant groups with some variations. In terms of vaccination uptake, these are lower in all migrant groups compared to Swedish born (90.9%) such as Africa (70.5%), Middle East (74.8%), and Europe without EU28/EEA (69.3%).\nFigure 1 shows the relative risks of COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality dependent on region of birth for the population across the entire risk period. All migrant groups except for individuals from North America have higher relative risk of ICU admission due to COVID-19 than the Swedish born population after adjustment for sex and age. Especially large excess risks in ICU admission can be seen for individuals born in Africa (RR = 4.1, 95% CI: 3.7, 4.6), the Middle East (RR= 4.3, 95% CI: 4.0, 4.6), Asia (RR = 3.7, 95% CI: 3.3, 4.1), South America (RR = 3.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 4.1) and Europe without EU28/EEA (RR= 3.5, 95% CI: 3.2, 3.8). These increased risks for ICU admission are partially explained by socioeconomic status, living conditions, as well as vaccination status, with relative risks attenuating by 54.8% for individuals born in Africa (RR = 2.5, 95% CI: 2.2, 2.8), by 43.7% in the Middle East (RR = 3.0, 95% CI: 2.7, 3.2), by 36.6% in Asia (RR = 2.7, 95% CI: 2.4, 3.0), and by 40.3% in South America (RR = 2.5, 95% CI: 2.2, 3.0).\nSimilar patterns are seen in COVID-19 related mortality, e.g., individuals born in Africa (RR = 3.1, 95% CI: 2.7, 3.6), the Middle East (RR= 2.7, 95% CI: 2.5, 2.9), Europe without EU28/EEA (RR= 2.3, 95% CI: 2.1, 2.5) and Asia (RR = 2.3, 95% CI: 2.0, 2.6) have substantially higher relative risk than Swedish born. The excess risks are reduced in the adjusted model by 64.6% for individuals born in Africa (RR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.0), by 63.9% in the Middle East (RR= 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5, 1.8), by 51.9% in Europe without EU28/EEA (RR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5, 1.8) and by 58.8% in Asia (RR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3, 1.8). Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Information includes the complete set of results for all available models, and Supplementary Table 3 gives the percentages of excess risk explained by the four additionally adjusted models. It shows that the contribution of socioeconomic status, living conditions and vaccination status for COVID-19 ICU admission and mortality varies substantially between region of origin groups, explaining only a small amount of the higher ICU admission and mortality risk of the migrant groups from the Nordics and EU/EEA, alongside a much more substantial amount for migrants from the Middle East, Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe outside the EU/EEA.\nIn Fig. 2, we see how the relative risks for COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality evolve over the four waves for models

In terms of COVID-19 related ICU admissions, the highest relative risks were observed in the first wave for most migrant groups. Individuals from Africa (RR = 8.2, 95% CI: 6.7, 10.2), the Middle East (RR = 6.2, 95% CI: 5.2, 7.4), and South America (RR = 5.8, 95% CI: 4.6, 7.3) had the greatest excess risks of ICU admission compared to those born in Sweden, risks which were attenuated after adjusting for socioeconomic and living conditions. However, as subsequent waves occurred, the relative risks gradually declined formostmigrant groups and by the fourth wave no disparities in ICU admission rates were evident after adjusting for SES, living conditions, and vaccination status.\nThe pattern is somewhat different for COVID-19 mortality where formostmigrant groups thedisparities are highest in thefirst and third wave and the gradual decline across waves is not observed, although by the fourth wave there are no disparities left after adjusting for SES, living conditions, and vaccination status. Any excess risks in the second wave can be accounted for by SES and living conditions, since vaccinations had only begun to be administered at the end of the second wave.\nIn order to fully examine the role of vaccinations in the fourth wave, we compared the relative risks for COVID-19 related ICU admission andmortality in the fourth wave with and without adjusting for vaccinations. The results can be seen in Fig. 3. Most of the disparities could be accounted for by differential vaccine uptake in the country/region of origin groups. For example, the relative risks of ICU admission related to COVID-19 in individuals born in Europe excluding EU28/EEA reduces from 2.8 (1.9,3.9) to 1.5 (1.0,2.2) once accounting for differences in vaccination uptake. In some cases, such as for individuals born in EU28/EEA without the Nordics, Africa, Asia, and South America their RR are no longer significantly different from 1 compared to people born in Sweden when accounting for vaccination."

First, our follow-up (which ends in June 1, 2022) encompasses the entire pandemic to the point where COVID-19was no longer considered a public health priority in Sweden. Second, wewere able to demonstrate how disparities in COVID-19 related ICU admission andmortality by region/country of birth varied across the various waves of the pandemic. Third, wewere able to explore how variation in vaccination uptake by region/country of birth influenced disparities in COVID-19.\nWe found that disparities in COVID-19 related ICU admission were profound in the first wave and tended to decrease during subsequent waves of the pandemic and were immaterial during the fourth wave after adjusting for SES, living conditions, and vaccination status. These findings indicate that migrants were more vulnerable to the virus during the initial stages of the pandemic when no vaccinations were available, the burden on the health care system was profound, and mitigation and treatment strategies were less developed. It has also been argued that public health messages and guidelines were insufficient for migrants during the initial phase of the pandemic14 which could account for higher risk of infection.\nFurthermore, high levels of exposure to COVID-19 in the migrant community during the first waves of the pandemicmay have led to the deaths of many of the most vulnerable individuals and infected many others who developed immunity. The introduction of vaccinations in wave 3 could contribute to increasing inequalities in COVID-19 relatedT ab le\n2 (c o n ti n ue\nd ) |D\nis tr ib ut io n o f th e st ud\ny p o p ul at io n ac\nro ss\nso ci o d em\no g ra p h ic\nva ri ab\nle s in cl ud\nin g S ES\n,l iv in g co\nn d it io n s an\nd va\ncc in at io n st at us\nS w ed\nen N o rd\nic s w /o\nS w ed\nen EU\n28 /E EA\nw /o\nN o rd\nic Eu\nro p e w /o\nEU 28\n/E EA\nM id d le\nEa st\nA fr ic a\nA si a\nN o rt h A m er ic a\nS o u th\nA m er ic a\nD eS\nO p o p u la ti o n d en\nsi ty\nq ui n ti le s\nQ 1\n1, 23\n8 ,0 27\n(2 0 .1 )\n37 ,4 6 5 (1 7. 5)\n4 6 ,7 9 0 (1 4 .3 )\n8 6 9 9 (3 .5 )\n8 9 6 8 (2 .3 )\n4 0 6 9 (2 .3 )\n14 ,8 0 8 (5 .8 )\n27 73\n(1 1. 2)\n39 36\n(5 .1 )\nQ 2\n1, 23\n6 ,6 6 7 (2 0 .1 )\n4 1, 9 75\n(1 9 .6 )\n4 7, 57\n9 (1 4 .5 )\n28 ,6 6 3 (1 1. 5)\n4 3, 9 12\n(1 1. 3)\n17 ,1 33\n(9 .8 )\n31 ,1 0 9 (1 2. 3)\n30 9 1 (1 2. 4 )\n72 9 7 (9 .4 )\nQ 3\n1, 31 2, 20\n7 (2 1. 3)\n4 4 ,5 32\n(2 0 .8 )\n59 ,0 55\n(1 8 .0 )\n57 ,0 4 4 (2 2. 9 )\n8 3, 70\n0 (2 1. 5)\n32 ,8 4 0 (1 8 .9 )\n50 ,2 22\n(1 9 .8 )\n4 26\n5 (1 7. 2)\n13 ,5 0 9 (1 7. 4 )\nQ 4\n1, 23\n8 ,8 4 3 (2 0 .2 )\n4 5, 54\n9 (2 1. 3)\n75 ,0 18\n(2 2. 9 )\n6 8 ,3 76\n(2 7. 5)\n11 5, 73\n0 (2 9 .7 )\n4 5, 35\n8 (2 6 .1 )\n6 7, 8 9 8 (2 6 .8 )\n56 4 5 (2 2. 7)\n19 ,9 9 2 (2 5. 7)\nQ 5\n1, 12 2, 11 6 (1 8 .3 )\n4 4 ,1 0 2 (2 0 .6 )\n9 8 ,7 8 8 (3 0 .2 )\n8 6 ,0 0 4 (3 4 .6 )\n13 7, 0 17\n(3 5. 2)\n74 ,6 8 0 (4 2. 9 )\n8 9 ,6 6 8 (3 5. 3)\n9 0 58\n(3 6 .5 )\n32 ,9 79\n(4 2. 4 )\nR eg\nio n\nEa st\n1, 6 4 8 ,7 9 7 (2 6 .8 )\n74 ,6 8 3 (3 5. 0 )\n13 1, 25\n9 (4 0 .1 )\n75 ,7 6 4 (3 0 .5 )\n13 9 ,2 10\n(3 5. 8 )\n74 ,7 25\n(4 2. 9 )\n10 3, 19 4 (4 0 .7 )\n11 ,4 70\n(4 6 .2 )\n4 2, 0 58\n(5 4 .1 )\nM id -w\nes t\n8 3 4 ,7 19\n(1 3. 6 )\n16 ,9 23\n(7 .9 )\n35 ,1 4 4 (1 0 .7 )\n33 ,2 8 3 (1 3. 4 )\n4 8 ,6 9 7 (1 2. 5)\n16 ,3 11\n(9 .4 )\n26 ,1 27\n(1 0 .3 )\n19 16\n(7 .7 )\n59 9 2 (7 .7 )\nN or th\n8 0 7, 6 78\n(1 3. 1)\n23 ,9 4 9 (1 1. 2)\n14 ,6 9 5 (4 .5 )\n77 6 7 (3 .1 )\n19 ,5 9 7 (5 .0 )\n18 ,7 27\n(1 0 .8 )\n20 ,9 73\n(8 .3 )\n15 54\n(6 .3 )\n4 0 36\n(5 .2 )\nS ou\nth 8 8 2, 57\n2 (1 4 .4 )\n28 ,9 6 3 (1 3. 6 )\n6 4 ,8 29\n(1 9 .8 )\n57 ,2 70\n(2 3. 0 )\n6 6 ,0 8 7 (1 7. 0 )\n14 ,4 24\n(8 .3 )\n37 ,3 24\n(1 4 .7 )\n39 6 1 (1 6 .0 )\n8 56\n6 (1 1. 0 )\nS ou\nth -E as t\n73 2, 0 58\n(1 1. 9 )\n29 ,8 0 3 (1 4 .0 )\n21 ,1 18\n(6 .5 )\n17 ,8 23\n(7 .2 )\n38 ,0 0 6 (9 .8 )\n19 ,5 14\n(1 1. 2)\n20 ,0 10\n(7 .9 )\n16 4 3 (6 .6 )\n4 6 27\n(6 .0 )\nW es\nt 1, 24\n2, 0 36\n(2 0 .2 )\n39 ,3 0 2 (1 8 .4 )\n6 0 ,1 8 5 (1 8 .4 )\n56 ,8 79\n(2 2. 9 )\n77 ,7 30\n(2 0 .0 )\n30 ,3 79\n(1 7. 5)\n4 6 ,0 77\n(1 8 .2 )\n4 28\n8 (1 7. 3)\n12 ,4 34\n(1 6 .0 )\nV ac\nci n at ed\nYe s\n5, 58\n9 ,7 32\n(9 0 .9 )\n18 4 ,6 0 5 (8 6 .4 )\n21 0 ,5 76\n(6 4 .4 )\n17 2, 30\n5 (6 9 .3 )\n29 1, 25\n3 (7 4 .8 )\n12 2, 78\n5 (7 0 .5 )\n20 8 ,9 4 8 (8 2. 4 )\n19 ,0 9 8 (7 6 .9 )\n6 3, 23\n8 (8 1. 4 )\nN o\n55 8 ,1 22\n(9 .1 )\n29 ,0 18\n(1 3. 6 )\n11 6 ,6 4 4 (3 5. 6 )\n76 ,4 72\n(3 0 .7 )\n9 8 ,0 58\n(2 5. 2)\n51 ,2 8 2 (2 9 .5 )\n4 4 ,7 4 3 (1 7. 6 )\n57 27\n(2 3. 1)\n14 ,4 72\n(1 8 .6 )\na 3 ,4 :M\nan ag\ner s,\np ro fe ss io na\nls ,t ec\nhn ic ia ns\nan d as so\nci at e p ro fe ss io na\nls ;2\n:C le ri ca\nl, se\nrv ic e,\nan d sa le s w or ke\nrs ,s\nki lle\nd ag\nri cu\nlt ur al ,f or es\ntr y an\nd fi sh\ner y w or ke\nr, cr af t an\nd re la te d tr ad\ne w or ke\nrs ,a\nnd p la nt\nan d m ac\nhi ne\nop er at or s,\nan d as se\nm b le rs ;1 :E\nle m en\nta ry\noc cu\np at io ns\n;A F:\nA rm\ned Fo\nrc es\n;X :N\not el se\nw he\nre cl as si fi ed\n.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4919 4\nmortality between migrants and Swedish born. The vaccination campaign reached the older population and certain risk groups first (overrepresented by Swedish born) while covering the middle-aged migrant population to a lesser extent. Also, restrictions on movement and social interactions decreased as vaccinationswere administered to the most vulnerable groups which could lead to higher rates of infections and community spread of the virus. These circumstances could have contributed to a lower protection in migrants who were then more exposed to the virus. Another potential, although yet unexplored, mechanism is that migrants suffer discrimination that could influence health care access and quality of care and thereby contributes to a higher COVID-19mortality and ICU. These inequalities decreasedduring the lastwavewhenmost of thepopulation aged 18or older had been offered a vaccine for COVID-19. The remaining differences between groups during the last wave could to a large extent be explained by differential vaccination uptake, which has been lower among migrant groups.\nOur results show that differences in socio-economic status and living conditions contributed in part to the higher risk for COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality in migrants, but other factors such as contact patterns could not be accounted for in our models. Socioeconomic conditions are strongly associated with several diseases andhealth risk behaviors that could increase the riskof COVID-19 death inmigrants10,17. Thus, socioeconomic adjustments could account for some underlying co-morbidities, explaining the higher COVID-19 ICU admission andmortality in foreign-born1. Migrants are more likely to live in shared and overcrowded accommodations, neighborhoods with high population density and multigenerational housing with implications for increased infection rates inmigrants and transmission of the virus between younger and older members of the household1,17. They are also disproportionately represented in front-line public-\nfacing jobs such as health care and the service industry that can place them at increased exposure of COVID-19 infection1,13,17. Healthcare seeking and barriers to care due to cultural and language barriers could also contribute to adverse COVID-19 outcomes in migrants17 although a previous study indicated that language proficiency played a minor role for higher COVID-19 mortality in migrants18.\nWe found that vaccinationuptake did contribute to the disparities in COVID-19 mortality and morbidity by country of birth during the fourth wave, where vaccination status accounts for much or all of the excess risk. Our findings therefore indicate that preventive action focused onmigrants social and living conditions could be important in future pandemics when no vaccine is yet available. Such action however requires longer-term investments and are difficult to achieve during an acute health crisis. When vaccinations do become available, providing equal access anduse of vaccines quickly is themost effective tool to mitigate disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality according to our findings. This is especially important when considering the lower vaccination uptake among migrants when compared to Swedish-born individuals19."

Some limitations of this study should be noted. The remaining excess risk of COVID-19 ICU admission and mortality found in foreign-born persons could indicate a higher prevalence of underlying adverse health conditions (e.g., diabetes, coronary health problems) and health risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol problems) found in the previous literature20\u201324. Although SES could be considered a proxy for some of\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4919 5\nconfidence intervals.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4919 6\nthese risk factors, we could not directly study underlying comorbidities for COVID-19 and how they vary across migrant groups in our registry data. Additional information on social interaction patterns, language proficiency, adherence to guidelines and information, and cultural and religious attitudes and norms regarding virus transmission could contribute to the understanding of disparities inCOVID19 by country of birth. Unfortunately, our data did not include such information. The data also lack accurate information about infections to evaluate the contribution of differential exposure. Previous findings have also found that the incomplete ascertainment of COVID-19 related deaths contributes to an underestimation of the mortality risk25. This might impact overall COVID-19 mortality rates although it is unlikely that it explains the disparities in COVID-19 mortality by country of birth. Finally, ICU admission does not necessarily reflect disease severity and could depend on factors such as the availability and effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, there is a risk of confounding by time period and selection bias in our analyses although it seems less likely that these factors impact ICU admission disparities by country of birth.\nAdditionally, the use of traditional regression models such as Poisson have limitations in the modeling of infectious diseases26 since events are not independent. However, the analyses are meant to be descriptive in terms of relative risks between groups and provide indications of the possible mechanisms. The estimates should not be interpreted as causal pathways since patterns of interaction and contact between individuals in different groups cannot be accounted for in the models. Moreover, the moderating effects of socioeconomic status and living conditions are not included in these models.\nMuch higher risks of COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality were found in most migrant groups, especially in the initial phase, although disparities were reduced throughout the pandemic.\nDisadvantaged socioeconomic status and living conditions partially explain the inequalities in severe COVID-19 disease and mortality by country of birth. The availability of a vaccine did play a decisive role when it became available. While preventive policies should focus on the social and living conditions ofmigrants in the absenceof a vaccine, supporting equitable resourcing and access to vaccine at a scale and intensity according to the degree of needs of specific migrant populations would have been the most important preventive strategy in order to mitigate disparities on COVID-19 related health outcomes."

For mortality, follow-up started fromMarch 1 2020 and ended on June 1 2021. On and between these two dates, individuals could experience the event (i.e., death from COVID-19) or be censored due to (1) death from a cause other thanCOVID-19or (2) reaching the endof the follow-upperiodalive. For ICU admission, follow-up started from March 1 2020 and ended on June 1 2021. On and between these two dates, individuals could experience the event (i.e., admission to ICU) or be censored due to (1) death from COVID-19 (having not been admitted to the ICU), (2) death from a cause other than COVID-19, or through reaching the end of the follow-up period alive having not been admitted to the ICU. The log of the follow-up was included as an offset in the models and incidence rate ratios (RR) were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Fivemodels were run, the firstminimally adjusted (M1) for sex and age, then another model adjusted for sex, age, and the sociodemographic factors education, income, occupation, and household type (M2). A third model included sex, age, and living conditions which include the housing and neighborhood characteristics, type of accommodation, living area per person, neighborhood populationdensity and regionof residence (M3). The fourth models adjusted for sex, age and vaccination status (M4), while the fifthmodel included all of the individual and residential level factors including vaccinations (M5). The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is calculated for each model in order to compare and test which of themodels best fits the data. The follow-up was split on the date for the first vaccination if applicable, and vaccination was recorded as a time-varying variable. In order to evaluate how the risks evolved over the waves, the data was further split into seven calendar time periods, with breaks at 2020-03-01, 2020-07-07, 2020-10-25, 2021-02-01, 2021-06-01, 2021-12-01, 2022-05-01, 2022-06- 01, and an interactionbetween region/country ofbirth and timeperiod\nwas estimated. The first wave was between 2020-03-01 and 2020-07- 07 (Wave 1), the second between 2020-10-25 and 2021-02-01 (Wave 2), and the third wave begins immediately after that and ends in 2021-06- 01 (Wave 3). It is a matter of definition whether wave 2 and wave 3 are actually distinct waves given that neither ICU admissions or deaths actually decreased to the levels seen in the summer of 2020. However, because of the drastic decrease of COVID-19 related mortality in the winter and springof 2021 and the fact that vaccinations hadbegunon a large scale, we chose to define these as separate waves. The fourth \u201comicron\u201dwave is between 2021-12-01 and 2022-05-01 (Wave 4), which saw a sharp increase in confirmed cases while ICU admission and deaths related to COVID-19 were lower than in previous waves due to vaccinations and amilder variant of the virus. Thewaves are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Information for COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality, and were derived by finding when mortality cases per day goes under 10, and ICU admissionunder 3. The cutoff date between wave 2 and 3 is when ICU admission reaches a local minimum. The statistical analyses were performed using R 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2022; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."
