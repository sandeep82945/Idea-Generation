    "abstractText": "In the radial displacement measurement of a small-sized cylindrical target, coupling interference between eddy current sensors reduces the accuracy of the measurement. In this study, finite element method (FEM) simulation based on ANSYS Maxwell was adopted to investigate the relationships between the coupling coefficient of the sensors and different parameters including the lift-off, cylinder diameter, axis angle, material, and excitation frequency. The experimental results were consistent with the simulation results. The coupling interference between the sensors increased with the decrease in the lift-off and cylinder diameter. The coupling effect decreased significantly when the probe axis angle increased to 120\u25e6, and the decrease in the sensor sensitivity was acceptable. A polynomial fitting function fitted the output signal well. A compensation method was given based on the compensation necessity evaluation. The results showed that the error of the rotor motion track was significantly decreased after compensation.",

Introduction\nDuring the operation process of an eddy current sensor (ECS), the strength of the eddy current effect is influenced by the permeability, conductivity, shape, and distance of the measured target [1,2]. Based on these characteristics, different kinds of ECSs have been developed for different functions, such as defect detection [3,4], measurement of displacement [5,6], vibration [7], conductivity [8], and thickness [9]. Although ECSs have been widely applied in various industrial fields, further research has been devoted to the promotion of the accuracy and adaptability of sensors to satisfy higher requirements. Probes with different shapes, such as planar [10], rosette-like [11], butterfly-shaped [12], and flexible array [13,14] probes, have been developed to adapt to different situations. Planar coils allow increased sensitivity in the detection of micro-size defects, especially along the welded joints. Rosette-like and butterfly-shaped coils enable the detections of defects around bolt holes and screw threads with high sensitivity and low error rates. Flexible array sensors are used to inspect complex structures such as steel balls and welded structures, showing good sensitivity and adaptability to environmental variation. Multifrequency [9,15] and pulsed [16] sensors are used to resist noise. Eddy current displacement sensors with self-temperature compensation have demonstrated ultra-stability [17,18]. The influence of heat treatment on the output of the sensor has been investigated based on analyses of the electromagnetic properties [19], and a new type of sensor independent of the sample electromagnetic properties was proposed [20]. The error produced by the tilt angle has been observed and eliminated by compensation [21]. Although all of these achievements have expanded the application fields of ECSs, there are still many limitations in the measurement of cylindrical targets. With the development\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22124375 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375 2 of 20\nof high-speed rotors, the clearances of bearings have become extremely narrow, and the maximum motion amplitude of a rotor can be less than 5 \u00b5m [22,23], bringing about much higher precision requirements in displacement measurements. In order to promote accuracy, the influences of the curvature, eccentricity, and interference should be considered. Ding et al. developed curved flexible coils for the measurement of gaps between curved surfaces and investigated their characteristics [24,25]. To eliminate the influence of the curvature on crack detection, Zhang et al. studied the lift-off noise of probe coils on curved specimens with small radii of curvature and presented a phase rotation and signal enhancement technique to eliminate the noise [26]. Zhan et al. studied the influence of eccentricity on cylindrical specimens and introduced a compensation method to reduce the error [27]. Sheng et al. studied the interference between arrayed ECSs [28]; however, the interference between sensors for radial displacement measurement has not been studied sufficiently. Consequently, during the operation of ECSs, the diameter of the cylindrical target is restricted to be much higher than the diameter of the sensing probe [29]. The minimum shaft diameter is 50.8 mm, and the recommended minimum diameter is 76.2 mm for Bently Nevada 3300 5 mm probes to reduce cross-talk interactions between probes. Researchers have sometimes had to employ other methods, such as the use of capacitance [30], laser [31], and electrostatic [32] devices, to measure the displacement and vibration of shafts. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the actual influence of the coupling interference between two ECSs for radial displacement measurement, based on which a compensation method could be given, and the application field of ECSs can be enlarged as a result. The regular pattern of the interference between the ECSs were investigated by finite element method (FEM) simulation analyses in this study. Experiments were employed to verify the simulation results and reveal the actual influence on the output signals. A compensation method based on application scenarios was presented to reduce the error.\n2. Basic Principle\nThe operating principle of an ECS is based on Faraday\u2019s law of electromagnetic induction. As shown in Figure 1a, when a coil is supplied with an alternating current (AC) I1, an alternating magnetic field H1 is generated, which induces an eddy current I2 in the detected target. The eddy current generates a magnetic field H2 in the opposite direction from H1. The principle of the eddy effect can be expressed by an equivalent circuit model, which is shown in Figure 1b. The inherent resistance and inductance of the coil are R1 and L1, respectively. Similarly, the resistance and inductance of the conductor are R2 and L2, respectively. Mutual inductance between the coil and the conductor is M, which can be expressed as\nM = k \u221a\nL1L2, (1)\nwhere k represents the coupling coefficient. Based on Kirchhoff\u2019s law, when the coil is driven by a current I1 with an angular frequency \u03c9, the equivalent resistance Rs and inductance Ls of the coil can be derived as Rs = R1 + \u03c92 M2 R22+(\u03c9L2) 2 R2\nLs = L1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 M2\nR22+(\u03c9L2) 2 L2\n(2)\nM can be influenced by the lift-off x; therefore, when the electrical conductivity \u03c3 and permeability \u00b5 of the conductor and the excitation frequency f of the coil are constant, where f = \u03c9/2\u03c0, the equivalent impedance Zs of the coil is a function of x. With a circuit transforming Zs to an output signal Uout, the displacement x is detected by measuring Uout. When several sensors operate simultaneously, the coupling interference should be taken into consideration. For a test system using two sensors, as shown in Figure 1c, the equivalent circuit is presented in Figure 1d. In this model, in addition to the mutual inductance between the coils and the detected object, which are expressed as M13 and M23,\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375 3 of 20\nrespectively, the mutual inductance of two coils, M12, adds extra impedance to the coils. Therefore, the coupling effect between two sensors can be represented by the values of M12 and k12.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 20\nwhere f = \u03c9/2\u03c0, the equivalent impedance Zs of the coil is a function of x.

Therefore, for two coils with certain structures, as shown in Figure 1c, the lift-off\nvalues of the ECSs, which can be expressed as x and y, the diameter D of the cylindrical\ntarget, the axis angle \u03b1 of the coils, and the permeability \u03bc of the target have influences on\nthe value of M12.\nThe simplified model described in Figure 2 is based on many assumptions.

Therefore, for two coils with certain structures, as shown in Figure 1c, the liftoff values of the ECSs, which can be expressed as x and y, the diameter D of the cylindrical target, the axis angle \u03b1 of the coils, and he permeability \u00b5 of the target have influences on the value of M12.

The eddy current field generated in the target, which is relevant to the excitation frequency f of the coils and the conductivity \u03c3 of the target, as shown in Figure 1c, will affect the mutual inductance by changing the magnetic field. Therefore, the mutual inductance M12 and coupling coefficient k12 of the coils in Figure 1c should be described by the following equations:\nM12 = M(x, y, D, \u03b1, \u03c3, \u00b5, f ), (7)\nk12 = k(x, y, D, \u03b1, \u03c3, \u00b5, f ) (8)\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375 5 of 20\nThe expressions of Equations (7) and (8) are too difficult to be obtained by theoretical calculations. Therefore, it is necessary for this study to discover the relationships between the parameters by FEM simulation and experimental analyses and construct fitting functions to describe the relationships.\n3.2. FEM Simulation Modeling\nTheoretical solutions to actual eddy current fields and mutual inductances are excessively complicated; therefore, FEM simulation through software is optimal for most application scenarios because of its high accuracy, which has been proven by theoretical analyses [35] and experiments [36], and the low complexity of modeling. Two-dimensional (2D) models are recommended for axisymmetric objects [37,38] to reduce complexity and improve solving efficiency. As the locations of the ECSs for the radial displacement measurement of a cylindrical target change the axial symmetry, 2D models are no longer applicable. Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) simulation models were established in ANSYS Maxwell, which is a commonly used software [21,27,28], as shown in Figure 3a.

The excitation frequency of a coil has a significant influence on the\npenetration depth \u03b4 of the eddy current. The relationship is described by Equation (9).\n1 =\n\u03c0f   (9)\nThe outer diameter Dout, inner diameter Din, and height h, of each coil were 5, 3, and\n2 mm, respectively, as shown in Figure 1c. The diameter of the coil is represented by the\nouter diameter; thus, Dcoil = Dout.\nDifferent cylinder diameters D were given to analyze the influence of the cylinder\ndiameter on the coupling effect. The length of the cylindrical target L was set to 12 times\nDcoil, aiming to reduce boundary errors. Coils 1 and 2 were located along X and Y direc-\ntions, respectively. The lift-off values were x and y, respectively, and were adjustable.\nThe meshing operation of the coils was set as \u201cinside selection\u201d and \u201clength based,\u201d\nwhere the element sizes were limited to within 0.5 mm. Regarding the skin effect of the\neddy current, the meshing operation of the cylindrical target was set as \u201con selection\u201d and\n\u201cskin depth based.\u201d The penetration depth was calculated based on Equation (9), and\neight layers of elements were given on the skin to ensure sufficient accuracy. The maxi-\nmum element sizes of the cylindrical target were limited to 3 mm. Moreover, the elements\nof the surface corresponding to the coils, where the eddy current was mainly generated,\nwere refined. The solution region was set to \u201c300%\u201d in each direction. The solution type\nwas set as \u201ceddy current,\u201d and skin effects were considered.\n3.3. Influence of Lift-Off on Coupling Effect\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, for two coils in a vacuum environment, the relative posi-\ntions have a significant influence on their mutual inductance. As for the ECSs in a cylin-\ndrical target displacement measurement, the directions of the two sensors are always ver-\ntical. The primary variable is the lift-off, representing the gap between the sensor and the\ntarget. The lift-off of coil 1 was kept constant (x = 1 mm). The lift-off of coil 2 varied from\n50 mm to 0.5 mm. When the lift-off was sufficiently large (y > 50 mm), the influence could\nbe ignored. The diameter of the cylindrical target was 20 mm, which was four times the\ndiameter of the coil.\nFigure 4a shows the variations in the distribution of the eddy current field with the\nlift-off of coil 2. When y > 10 mm, the eddy current generated by coil 2 was weak. With the\ndecrease in y from 10 mm to 0.5 mm, the eddy current generated by coil 2 increased sig-\nnificantly. The increasing eddy current field covered an overlapping area with the field\ngenerated by coil 1.

(a) Three-dimensional configuration of the simulation model; (b) B\u2013H (magnetic flux density\u2013magnetic field intensity) curve of steel 1008 in ANSYS Maxwell material library.\nThe materials of the coils, target, and atmosphere were set in the simulation model. The typical material of a coil is copper, whereas the materials of the detected conductors differ widely. Conductors are always classified as ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials according to their electromagnetic characteristics [39]. In this study, the properties of a ferromagnetic material, steel 1008, and a non-ferromagnetic material, aluminum, were both observed as detection targets. The main parameters of the above materials and the vacuum are listed in Table 1, which are included in the material library of ANSYS Maxwell. The magnetization process of a ferromagnetic material is nonlinear, resulting in the permeability being non-constant. Therefore, the permeability is reflected by the B\u2013H curve, as shown in Figure 3b, where B is the magnetic flux density, and H is the magnetic field intensity. The coil is influenced by both the eddy effect and the magnetoresistance effect when detecting a ferromagnetic target, and the output is sensitive to the composition distribution [39]. The magnetization process of a ferromagnetic material is complex an unstable; therefore, the material of the detected target was aluminum unless noted otherwise.

The relationship is described by Equation (9).\n\u03b4 = 1\u221a\n\u03c0 f \u00b5\u03c3 (9)\nThe outer diameter Dout, inner diameter Din, and height h, of each coil were 5, 3, and 2 mm, respectively, as shown in Figure 1c. The diameter of the coil is represented by the outer diameter; thus, Dcoil = Dout. Different cylinder diameters D were given to analyze the influence of the cylinder diameter on the coupling effect. The length of the cylindrical target L was set to 12 times Dcoil, aiming to reduce boundary errors. Coils 1 and 2 were located along X and Y directions, respectively. The lift-off values were x and y, respectively, and were adjustable. The meshing operation of the coils was set as \u201cinside selection\u201d and \u201clength based,\u201d where the element sizes were limited to within 0.5 mm. Regarding the skin effect of the eddy current, the meshing operation of the cylindrical target was set as \u201con selection\u201d and \u201cskin depth based.\u201d The penetration depth was calculated based on Equation (9), and eight layers of elements were given on the skin to ensure sufficient accuracy. The maximum element sizes of the cylindrical target were limited to 3 mm. Moreover, the elements of the surface corresponding to the coils, where the eddy current was mainly generated, were refined. The solution region was set to \u201c300%\u201d in each direction. The solution type was set as \u201ceddy current,\u201d and skin effects were considered.\n3.3. Influence of Lift-Off on Coupling Effect\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, for two coils in a vacuum environment, the relative positions have a significant influence on their mutual inductance. As for the ECSs in a cylindrical target displacement measurement, the directions of the two sensors are always vertical. The primary variable is the lift-off, representing the gap between the sensor and the target. The lift-off of coil 1 was kept constant (x = 1 mm). The lift-off of coil 2 varied from 50 mm to 0.5 mm. When the lift-off was sufficiently large (y > 50 mm), the influence could be ignored. The diameter of the cylindrical target was 20 mm, which was four times the diameter of the coil. Figure 4a shows the variations in the distribution of the eddy current field with the lift-off of coil 2. When y > 10 mm, the eddy current generated by coil 2 was weak. With the decrease in y from 10 mm to 0.5 mm, the eddy current generated by coil 2 increased significantly. The increasing eddy current field covered an overlapping area with the field generated by coil 1. Figure 4b shows the change in the magnetic field intensity H along the circumferential direction with different values of the lift-off y, where the angle was measured from the X axis along the counterclockwise direction. H decreased with the increase in y. Figure 4c shows the change in H with different values of the excitation frequency f. With the increase in f, H was more concentrated at the surface area of the target facing the coils.\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375 7 of 20\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20\nthe circumferential direction with different values of the lift-off y, where the angle was measured from the X axis along the counterclockwise direction.

The trend in k12 was consistent with the trend in M12. k12 was dimensionless; therefore, this paper mainly discusses the change in k12. As shown in Figure 5b, different curves had similar trends, k12 reached the peak when y was around 3 mm. With the decrease in the lift-off, the distance between the two coils decreased and the eddy current density generated by coil 2 increased. The changes resulted in the increase in the coupling coefficient. The magnetic field intensity was more concentrated when y was small, as shown in Figure 4b. This may have resulted in the decrease in the coupling coefficient when y was less than 3 mm. k12 decreased with the increase in f, which corresponded well with the trend in the two parallel sensors [28]. The excitation frequency influenced the distribution of the induced magnetic field. A higher frequency resulted in a stronger skin effect, and the generated magnetic field became more concentrated, as shown in Figure 4c. Therefore, increasing the excitation frequency of the ECS was beneficial for reducing interference for the cylindrical aluminum target. The promotion became weak when the excitation frequency exceeded 100 kHz, however. Proper lift-off of the ECS has the potential to reduce interference, and it is recommended to keep the lift-off as far as possible from the value where the coupling coefficient reaches its peak.\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n-45 -30 -15 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105120135\nM ag\nne tic\nfi el\nd in\nte ns\nity (k\nA /m\n)\nAngle (\u00b0)\ny=0.5mm y=1mm y=2mm y=3mm y=5mm\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n-45 -30 -15 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 120 135 M\nag ne\ntic fi\nel d\nin te\nns ity\n(k A\n/m )\nAngle (\u00b0)\nf=1kHz f=10kHz f=100kHz f=1000kHz\nFigure 4.

Influence of Material on Coupling Effect\nAluminum is mainly applied in non-rotational structures, while rotational structures primarily adopt steel materials to obtain better comprehensive performances. Due to the significant differences in the conductivity and permeability of these materials, which are both essential to the eddy current field distribution, cylindrical targets of different materials might have significantly different coupling effects. Thus, aluminum and steel cylindrical targets were compared with a vacuum environment. Steel 1008 was selected as typical steel. The parameters of these materials are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3b. Figure 10a shows the change in the coupling coefficient with the cylinder diameter using different materials. Compared with the coils in a vacuum, the existence of a metal cylindrical target reduced the coupling coefficient of the coils. k12 decreased with the increase in the diameter of the steel cylindrical target, which was similar to the trend in the aluminum cylindrical target. The descending slope was much smaller, however. There was difference between the two materials in terms of the change with the excitation frequency. When the cylinder diameter D < 20 mm, the coupling coefficient k12 of the steel material increased with the increase in the excitation frequency f. When D > 25 mm, k12 did not change significantly with the change in f. Moreover, the k12 curves showed little difference at 100 and 1,000 kHz. As shown in Figure 10b, the variation characteristics of the coupling coefficient k12 with the lift-off y of coil 2 when using steel material was different from those when using aluminum. The coupling coefficient of the steel material decreased with the increase in the lift-off in the whole range, while the coupling coefficient of the aluminum material reached the peak when y was around 3 mm.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20\nTherefore, the angle between the coil axes had a significant influence on the coupling\neffect. Increasing the angle was beneficial for reducing the mutual interference. When\nD/Dcoil = 4, the angle is recommended to be 120\u00b0 to reduce the coupling coefficient to about\n27%. If the sensor is not located along the vertical direction, the output y\u2032 should be trans-\nformed to y through the following equation based on their geometric relationship:\n   tan 90 cos 90\ny y x \n\n   \n (10)\nThe sensitivity of y\u2032 is around \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.866 of y when \u03b1 = 120\u00b0, which is acceptable in\nmost situations.\n3.6.

This indicated that compensation is commonly necessary for steel material to obtain high accuracy. When detecting an aluminum material, the coupling coefficient can be reduced by both increasing and reducing the lift-off, while the coupling coefficient can only be reduced by increasing the lift-off when detecting a steel material.\n4. Experiments and Discussions\nAs determined via the FEM simulation, the lift-off, cylinder diameter, axis angle, and material were essential for the coupling effect of the ECSs for the radial displacement measurement of a cylindrical target, which was revealed by the changes in the coupling coefficient. The variation characteristics are the bases of sensor design and selection. In order to eliminate the errors, the actual influence on the output signal should be observed.\n4.1. Experiment Design and Instruments\nAs shown in Figure 11, a test platform was developed by the authors to measure the signal outputs of two sensors located along X and Y directions. A cylindrical target was placed on a moving platform. The lift-off was measured by a micrometer gauge. Probes of the sensors were placed along the X and Y directions of a cross section at a certain height. Probes were fixed on two supports, which could be moved on X and Y directions. Their displacements were measured by scales. Additional tools were used to fix the probes with certain deflection angles.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 20\ncies to reduce the interference.

The value of the displacement can be calculated based on the value of output voltage and the sensitivity obtained in Figure 12.\nIn order to calculate the value of |\u2206U1| by y in a continuous range, there are two methods, linear interpolation and polynomial fitting, which are mainly used by researchers. Linear interpolation is commonly used to express unknown functions in a continuous\nSensors 2022, 22, 4375 17 of 20\nrange based on the statistics of limited quantities. The requirement for the accuracy of the statistics is high. It is preferred in fields where the function is hard to express directly. Therefore, polynomial fitting is more commonly adopted in most fields. The function |\u2206U1|\u2013y when D = 10 for the steel material was obtained through the polynomial fitting method. |\u2206U1| was very low when y exceeded 10 mm; therefore, the range of y was [0.5,10]. The fitting function is shown as follows:\n|\u2206U1| = k3y3 + k2y2 + k1y + k0, (11)\nwhere the coefficients ki (i = 0,1,2,3) were obtained by the least squares method. The values were as follows: k0 = 5.52 \u00d7 10\u22122, k1 = \u20131.71 \u00d7 10\u22122, k2 = 2.04 \u00d7 10\u22123, k3 = \u22128.71 \u00d7 10\u22125. The units of |\u2206U1| and y were V and mm, respectively. A comparison of the experimental results and fitting function is shown in Figure 16a. The fitting function fitted well with the experimental results. The corresponding |\u2206U1| could be obtained by substituting y into Equation (11).\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 20\nIn order to calculate the value of |\u0394U1| by y in a continuous range, there are two\nmethods, linear interpolation and polynomial fitting, which are mainly used by research-\ners.

Motion Tracks of a Cylindrical Target with and without Compensation\nIn order to demonstrate the effect of the compensation, a simulation was performed\nto compare the motion tracks of a rotor center with and without compensation. For a rotor\nsupported by aero-foil bearings, because the surface of the foil bearing is soft, it is difficult\nto detect the geometric center of the bearing. Therefore, the measured track of the rotor\ncenter is typically based on relative positions, and the absolute positions are commonly\nuncertain [42]. One possible method to obtain the absolute positions of the rotor center is\nto measure the absolute displacement of the shaft to the ECSs. For a rotor with a diameter\nof 10 mm and a motion track, as shown in Figure 17, its output voltages were measured.\nTwo methods were taken to transfer the voltages to motion tracks.
