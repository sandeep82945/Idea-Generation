 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this review paper on PEO-PCL based nanocarriers:

1. Investigate new methods of synthesizing PEO-PCL copolymers with different architectures (e.g. graft copolymers, star copolymers) and evaluate their self-assembly and drug loading/release capabilities.

2. Develop PEO-PCL based nanocarriers with stimuli-responsive properties (pH, temperature, enzyme etc.) for targeted drug delivery applications.

3. Design multi-functional PEO-PCL nanocarriers for combination therapy (e.g. chemo-gene therapy) using multiple drugs/genes.

4. Explore new bioconjugation strategies to functionalize PEO-PCL nanocarriers with targeting ligands, cell penetrating peptides, imaging agents etc. 

5. Conduct more in vivo studies in animal models to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of promising PEO-PCL nanoformulations.
