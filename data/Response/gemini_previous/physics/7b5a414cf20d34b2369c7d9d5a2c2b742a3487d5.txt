1. **Investigate the effect of different linker lengths and compositions on the binding affinity, internalization, and biodistribution of PSMA-targeting agents.** This could be done by synthesizing a series of compounds with different linker lengths and compositions and evaluating their properties in vitro and in vivo. This information could be used to design PSMA-targeting agents with optimal properties for specific applications.


2. **Explore the use of different chelators for radiolabeling PSMA-targeting agents.** In this study, the authors used a DOTA-GA chelator to radiolabel In-22 and In-30. However, there are a variety of other chelators that could be used for this purpose. Investigating the use of different chelators could lead to the development of PSMA-targeting agents with improved radiochemical properties.


3. **Evaluate the efficacy of PSMA-targeting agents in combination with other therapeutic modalities.** In this study, the authors only evaluated the efficacy of In-22 and In-30 as single agents. However, PSMA-targeting agents could also be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy. Evaluating the efficacy of PSMA-targeting agents in combination with other therapeutic modalities could lead to the development of more effective treatments for prostate cancer.


4. **Investigate the use of PSMA-targeting agents for the early detection of prostate cancer.** In this study, the authors only evaluated the use of PSMA-targeting agents for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, PSMA-targeting agents could also be used for the early detection of prostate cancer. This could be done by using PSMA-targeting agents to image the prostate gland and identify tumors at an early stage, when they are more likely to be curable.


5. **Develop PSMA-targeting agents for the treatment of other types of cancer.** PSMA is not only expressed in prostate cancer cells, but also in cells from other types of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This suggests that PSMA-targeting agents could also be used for the treatment of these other types of cancer. Investigating the use of PSMA-targeting agents for the treatment of other types of cancer could lead to the development of new treatments for these diseases.
