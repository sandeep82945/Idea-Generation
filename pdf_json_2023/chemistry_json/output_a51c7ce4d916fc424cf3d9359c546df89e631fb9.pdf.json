    "abstractText": "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study the molecular structure of four mediumand low-temperature heat-treated medium-rank coals. The FTIR spectral parameters, which consist of CH2/CH3, aromaticity (fa), aromatic carbon rate (fC), aromatic hydrogen rate (fH), oxygen-containing (C\u2013O) rate (IR), organic matter maturity (M), and the degree of aromatic condensation (Dc), indicate different characteristics, including changes in the aromatic hydrocarbon structure, fatty hydrocarbon structure, hydroxyl structure, and oxygen-containing functional groups of medium-rank coal. The results show that with the increase in heat treatment temperature, the sulfur content in coal gradually decreases, but the C/H ratio gradually increases. Meanwhile, the content of kaolinite and pyrite in coal gradually decreases, whereas the content of dolomite and hematite gradually increases. With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the relative content of ether oxygen hydroxyl groups in the hydroxyl structure significantly decreases, but the relative content of self-associated hydroxyl groups increases. The relative content of alkyl ether (C\u2013O) in oxygen-containing functional groups gradually increases, whereas the relative content of aromatic nucleus C=C vibration presents a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. In addition, \u2013CH2\u2013 is the majority in the structure of fatty hydrocarbons, and the absorption peak intensity of asymmetric \u2013CH3 stretching vibration increases with the increase in heat-treated temperature. The structure of aromatic hydrocarbons mainly consists of four substituted benzene rings (except for R-303.15 K), in which the relative content of the trisubstituted benzene ring decreases with the increase in heat treatment temperature. With the increase in the heat-treated temperature of medium-rank coal, Dc, fH, fC, and fa show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, M and IR reveal a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, and CH2/CH3 present a gradually decreasing trend. In conclusion, during the increase in the heat treatment temperature of medium-rank coal, the length of the fatty side chains in the fatty hydrocarbon structure becomes shorter, the number of branch chains continuously increases, and the maturity and condensation degree of organic matter first increases and then decreases. On this basis, further research on the effect of coal gasification suggests combining various technologies such as 13C NMR, XRD, and TG-MS to obtain semi-quantitative structural information of molecules in coal from different perspectives.",

            "text": "Coal is an uneven aggregate mainly formed by cross-linked molecular networks of organic components [1], and its molecular structure undergoes rapid changes during heating [2\u20134]. However, research on the molecular structure and functional group characteristics\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6746. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16206746 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6746 2 of 17\nof coal has always been a focus of attention due to its complex microstructure [5\u20137]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as a non-destructive structural characterization technique, is usually suitable for studying the degree of coalification, functional groups, material composition, and genetic types of coal [8\u201315]. This technology has the advantages of simple operation, low cost, and effective recognition of cross-linked molecular information of organic substances [4,16,17]. Moreover, the study of molecular structure in coal has always been a subject of fierce debate, including the attribution and distribution characteristics of aromatic, aliphatic, hydroxyl, and oxygen-containing functional groups in coal [18\u201320], as well as the impact of pyrolysis temperature on functional groups of different coal types [21,22]. In addition, the molecular structure parameters of low-rank coal are determined by factors such as depositional environments, microbial abundance, coal-forming plants, mineral composition, and coalification [4,20,23\u201327]. The high-temperature pyrolysis reaction of coal is used to extract tar, CO, CO2, and other products, which can effectively expand the comprehensive utilization value of lowgrade coal resources [28]. Notably, the pyrolysis characteristics of lignite between 293.15 K and 923.15 K were studied using FTIR. It was found that the aromaticity increased with increasing temperature [29]. Moreover, FTIR analysis on coal with different degrees of coal carbonization was conducted. It was found that with the increase in coal carbonization degree, the aromaticity and aromatic core structure content of coal increased, while the content of fatty structure and C=O type structure (found at 1710 cm\u22121) decreased [10]. In addition, FTIR was used to study the changes in active groups in coal from 303.15 K to 483.15 K. It was found that carbon and oxygen-containing groups in aliphatic groups were affected to varying degrees [30]. Then, FTIR spectroscopy was used to study the changes in aromatic ring structure (900\u2013700 cm\u22121) and oxygen-containing functional groups (1800\u2013 1000 cm\u22121) of low-rank coal during slow heat treatment [31]. Moreover, FTIR was used to analyze the molecular structure changes in six types of coal chars at 723.15 K\u2013973.15 K. It was found that the aromaticity of coal chars increased with increasing coalification degree while fatty hydrogen decreased with the increase in temperature [17]. In addition, FTIR analysis was adopted to indicate that the degree of aromatization of coal increased with the increase in coal rank while aliphatic and oxygen-containing functional groups decreased [32]. Lignite was found to have a high content of CH2, indicating that there are fewer side chains of fatty hydrocarbons in coal, and most of them appear in the form of long chains [33]. Currently, FTIR research on the molecular structures of different coal ranks is mainly focused on high-temperature pyrolysis [34,35], but the low-temperature pyrolysis of mediumrank coal is rarely researched [32,36\u201338]. Meanwhile, exploring the evolution of pyrolysis molecular structure can be helpful in optimizing the comprehensive utilization direction of coal, such as dry distillation, gasification, and liquefaction [39,40]. Taking the mediumrank coal from Renjiazhuang Coal Mine in Ningxia as the research object, this paper used 303.15 K, 523.15 K, 623.15 K, and 723.15 K heat-treated coal samples. Through FTIR experiments and peak fitting techniques, the relative content of functional groups of different heat-treated coal samples was calculated. In combination with seven infrared spectral molecular structure parameters, the molecular structure characteristics of low-order coal with different heat treatments were comprehensively analyzed."

            "text": "The KBr compression method was used to determine the infrared spectrum analysis of different heat-treated coal samples. To be specific, 0.005 g of the sample was mixed with 0.500 g of alkali metal halide KBr and ground in an agate mortar to 75 \u00b5m (grinding for 10 min). Then, it was put into a tablet-forming machine, pressed into pieces, and placed on the sample rack of an infrared spectroscopy testing instrument for measurement. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (NICOLET 5700), developed by Thermo Nicolet in the United States, was adopted to measure the spectral characteristics of the sample before and after treatment. The instrument testing conditions include a wavenumber measurement range from 400 cm\u22121 to 4000 cm\u22121, a resolution of 4 cm\u22121, a total of 32 scans, and scanning with a blank KBr film as the background to eliminate the influence of the background on spectral quality. Due to the large particle size of different heat-treated coal samples, infrared light scattering is prone to occur, triggering a tilted baseline of the infrared spectra of different heat-treated medium-rank coals. Therefore, OPUS 8.0 software and Rubberband method should be used for baseline correction. In the original spectra of different heat-treated coal samples, the absorption bands of many functional groups in the coal contribute to the infrared spectrum, and the band is wide, which can easily lead to the phenomenon of overlapping spectral peaks. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the position of the absorption peak and the absorption intensity of functional groups within a certain region. To have a deeper understanding of the molecular structure differences of different heattreated coals, Origin 2021 should be used to decompose the superimposed peaks and fit the original spectra. In order to achieve better fitting results, the fitting process determined the approximate position and number of initial stacked peaks based on the second-order derivatives of each spectrogram. Through selection of an appropriate peak shape function (Lorentzian or Gaussian), the least squares method was used to iteratively solve for the position, peak width, peak area, and other related parameters of each single peak [46]."

The absorption peaks of the infrared spectra of different heat-treated coal samples were distributed in four large intervals: the C-H segment of substituted aromatics ranging from 700 to 900 cm\u22121, the absorption vibration of oxygen-containing functional groups ranging from 1000 to 1800 cm\u22121, the C-H segment of fatty acids ranging from 2800 to 3000 cm\u22121, and the stretching vibration of hydroxyl and aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from 3100 to 3600 cm\u22121 [12,20,47].

As shown in Figure 4A,B, the R-303.15 K and R-523.15 K samples exhibit a large and wide absorption peak near 3410 cm\u22121, representing self-associating hydroxyl groups. As revealed in Figure 4C,D, there is a small and narrow absorption peak near 3305 cm\u22121, which represents ether oxyhydroxyl groups [19]. Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 19\nFigure 4.

Peak Fitting and Analysis of C-Hal Structure There are three types of fatty substances in different heat-treated coals: \u2013CH3, \u2013CH2\u2013 , and C\u2013H, with wave numbers ranging from 2800 cm\u22121 to 3000 cm\u22121. The spectra of different heat-treated medium-rank coal samples in this band were fitted using the five subpeaks [62], and the determination coefficient R2 ranges from 99.17% to 99.95%. As shown in Figure 5A,B, strong absorption peaks appear near 2850 cm\u22121 and 2920 cm\u22121, representing symmetric \u2013CH2\u2013 stretching vibration and asymmetric \u2013CH2\u2013 stretching vibration, respectively. Strong absorption peaks appear near 2895 cm\u22121 and 2950 cm\u22121, representing methane C-H stretching vibration and asymmetric -CH3 stretching vibration, respectively [39]. The vicinity of 2870 cm\u22121 represents the symmetric \u2013CH3 stretching vibration (Figure 5C,D). Overall, R-623.15 K exhibits stronger asymmetric \u2013CH2\u2013 and \u2013CH3 stretching vibration in comparison to other medium-rank coals. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 4, in the structure of fatty hydrocarbons, R-303.15K has the highest relative content of \u2013CH2\u2013, while the relative content of \u2013CH3 and C\u2013H is relatively low. With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the relative content of asymmetric \u2013CH3 vibration gradually increases, and the relative content of \u2013CH2\u2013 and \u2013 CH3 presents irregular changes [52,62]. This is because the temperature causes the continuous fracture of long chains in fatty hydrocarbons, inducing a gradual reduction in long chains and an increase in branched chains [4,63].\nFigure 4.

Peak Fitting and Analysis of Oxygen Functional Groups\nIn this study, nine sub-peaks were used to fit the absorption vibration of oxygencontaining functional groups (1000\u20131800 cm\u22121) in different heat-treated coals [64], with a fitting coefficient R2 ranging from 97.12% to 99.04%. As shown in Figure 6A, due to the cross-influence and overlap between functional groups, there are three peaks in the 1030\u20131350 cm\u22121 range, namely 1034 cm\u22121, 1117 cm\u22121, and 1265 cm\u22121, belonging to the C\u2013O stretching vibration of oxygen-containing functional groups such as alcohols, phenols, ethers, phenoxy groups, acids, and lipids. Apart from that, there is a symmetric deformation \u2013CH3 vibration at 1385 cm\u22121 and an aliphatic chain (\u2013CH3, \u2013CH2\u2013) asymmetric vibration at 1435 cm\u22121. In Figure 6B, the ash content is present at 1012 cm\u22121, the conjugated C=O vibration is present at 1659 cm\u22121, and the stretching vibration of carboxyl C=O is present at 1699 cm\u22121. Obviously, there is alkyl ether at 1035 cm\u22121 and aryl ether stretching vibration at 1101 cm\u22121 (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 6D, alkyl ether is present at 1043 cm\u22121, and the C=C stretching vibration of aromatic hydrocarbons is present at 1598 cm\u22121. Through comparison, it could be found that with the increase in the temperature, the oxygen content in coal char first increases and then decreases, and the absorption frequency gradually moves towards the low wavenumber range [65]. There are many peak positions in the range of 1000\u20131800 cm\u22121, with the majority of oxygen-containing functional groups, but there is also a small amount of ash (Figure 6 and Table 5). In addition, R-303.15 K coal has many peak positions in the range of 1000\u20131800 cm\u22121, including phenol, alcohol, ether, phenolic deformation C\u2013O (stretching), symmetric deformation \u2013CH3 (bending), aliphatic chains (\u2013CH3, \u2013CH2\u2013), and aromatic nucleus C=C vibration, with a relatively high content of conjugated C=O, aliphatic chains (\u2013CH3, \u2013CH2\u2013), and aromatic carboxyl C=O. In other coal chars, the relative contents of aryl ether, alkyl ether, aromatic nucleus C=C vibration, and aromatic carboxyl C=O are higher. With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the content of the aromatic carboxyl C=O and aromatic nucleus C=C in coal first increases and then decreases. The reason is that the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes during the heating process of coal enhances the degree of coal aromatization, triggering an increase in the aromatic nucleus C=C. However, during the metamorphism process, the accumulation of heat due to oxidation and heating enhances the pyrolysis effect, inducing a decrease in the aromatic nucleus C=C. This also reduces the stretching vibration content of phenols, alcohols, ethers, and esters C\u2013O [66].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 6746 11 of 17 Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 19\nFigure 6.

Within this range, different heat-treated coal\nchars exhibit different results, as shown in Figure 7. In order to achieve better fitting results, the five sub-peaks are used for fitting, and the coefficient of determination R2 reaches over 95%. The position of the absorption peak is related to the number of adjacent H on the benzene ring, and the type of substitution of aromatic rings in the general coal molecular structure can be inferred from the distribution of adjacent H [67]. In general, there are four substitution methods for coal aromatic hydrocarbon structures: disubstituted benzene ring in the wave number range of 730\u2013750 cm\u22121, trisubstituted benzene ring in the wave number range of 750\u2013810 cm\u22121, four substituted benzene rings in the wave number range of 810\u2013850 cm\u22121, and pentasubstituted benzene ring in the wave number range of 850\u2013900 cm\u22121 [67,68]. Based on the peak area in the wave number range of 700\u2013900 cm\u22121 for the absorption vibration of aromatic hydrocarbon structures, two obvious absorption peaks are located near 774 cm\u22121 and 837 cm\u22121, representing three adjacent H deformations and two adjacent H deformations, accounting for approximately 39.22% and 37.21%, respectively (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B, there is a wide and large absorption peak near 832 cm\u22121, accounting for approximately 68.42%, which is two adjacent H deformations (aromatic nucleus, C\u2013H).

As the temperature increases with different heat treatments, the structural components of aromatic hydrocarbons first increase and then decrease, while the number of trisubstituted benzene ring compounds gradually decreases, indicating that the absorption intensity changes with the increase in the temperature [69].

Variation of Molecular Structure Parameters of Coal The fa, fH, and fc present a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the temperature increase in different heat treatments (Table 7).

This further indicates that temperature is crucial for the aromatization of coal. Subsequently, With the continuous increase in temperature, the activation energy of the coal sample combustion reaction decreases, leading to a decrease in aromaticity [48,70]. The CH2/CH3 value gradually decreases with the temperature increase in different heat treatments (Table 7), indicating that the length of the fat side chain becomes shorter and the number of branch chains increases [66]. As for the heating process of coal, it exhibits the process of continuously breaking the fatty chain, decreasing the number of methylene groups, and increasing the number of methyl groups to form more shortbranched chains [12,71]. With the increase in temperature of the heat-treated coal sample, the IR presents a trend of first decreasing and then increasing (Table 7). This is because the coal removes the C-O oxygen-containing functional groups, and the aromatics are destroyed in the later stage during the heating process [66]. The maturity of organic matter (M) presents a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the temperature increase in heat-treated coal (Table 7), indicating that the maturity of organic matter in coal gradually matures.

With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the disubstituted benzene ring presents an upward trend (except for R-303.15 K), while the trisubstituted benzene ring presents a downward trend.

            "text": "The conventional gases in coal pyrolysis mainly include CH4, C2H2, H2O, H2, CO2, and CO. However, there are some differences in the content of total sulfur and form sulfur in the raw coal, triggering significant variations in the escape of different sulfur elements during the pyrolysis process of the coal sample [74]. In order to reasonably utilize highsulfur coal resources, reduce the sulfur content in coal, and meet the production needs of blast furnaces, the sulfur conversion process should be controlled through coal washing and specific pyrolysis process conditions [75]. Based on FTIR technology, the molecular structure of coal samples after different heat treatments was studied, and the quality of coal was preliminarily evaluated, indicating the differences in basic properties and elemental composition of coal. Through the approximate analysis and limit analysis of some empirical equations, some parameters representing molecular structural characteristics, such as f H, f C, f a, IR, and Dc, were calculated. These parameters indicate that with the increase in heat treatment temperature, organic components in coal are gasified and precipitated, such as dehydrogenation and aromatization of cycloalkanes in coal, shortening of fatty chains, and reduction in oxygen-containing functional group content. Overall, FTIR achieved certain results in studying the molecular structure of coal samples under different heat treatments. It is noteworthy that due to the inherent complexity of coal gasification products with different coal qualities and metamorphic degrees, detailed, accurate, and precise analysis of macromolecular structures is quite challenging. Therefore, in the analysis of highly heterogeneous coal gasification samples, it is recommended to combine various techniques such as 13C NMR, XRD, and TG-MS to acquire semi-quantitative structural information of molecules in coal samples from different perspectives."

The relative content of ether oxygen hydroxyl groups in medium-rank coal with high heat treatment temperature significantly decreases, while the relative content of selfassociated hydroxyl groups and cyclic hydroxyl groups increases. In addition, the relative content of methylene in the fatty hydrocarbon structure is relatively high, and the intensity of the absorption peak of asymmetric stretching vibration of methyl groups is enhanced. (3) With the increase in heat-treated temperature, the infrared spectral area of oxygencontaining functional groups presents a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Among them, the peak area of aromatic nucleus C=C vibration is the largest (except for R-303.15 K), and its relative content presents a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the oxygen-containing functional groups of heat-treated coal samples basically do not contain phenolic deformation C\u2013O (stretching). With the increase in heat treatment temperature, the relative concentrations of alkyl ether (C\u2013O) increase. The structure of aromatic hydrocarbons mainly consists of four substituted benzene rings (except for R303.15 K). With the increase in the temperature, the relative content of the trisubstituted benzene ring decreases.
