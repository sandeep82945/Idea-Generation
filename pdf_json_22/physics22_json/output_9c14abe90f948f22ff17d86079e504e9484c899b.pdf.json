We determine the critical dynamical exponent of the model and reveal the existence of logarithmic corrections at special points.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThere is a class of one-dimensional quantum lattice models which have in common that the excitation energies are given by the eigenvalues of certain tridiagonal matrices. The most prominent example is the transverse-field Ising chain (TFIC), which can be mapped to a fermion chain with quadratic terms by the wellknown Jordan-Wigner transformation1. A closely related model is the spin- 12 XY chain 2, which can be mapped to two independent TFIC-s3\u20135. Another representatives of this class are the fermionic hopping models on a one-dimensional lattice. In this paper, we focus on the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of TFIC. The relevance of studying the gap is given by the existence of a continuous phase transition of the model from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic phase when the the strength of the transverse field is decreased. In the ferromagnetic phase, the energy gap closes exponentially with the system size L and the ground state and first excited state become asymptotically degenerate, showing the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the infinite system. In the critical point, the gap closing is slower than exponential, in general a power law, \u01eb \u223c L\u2212z, where z is the critical dynamical exponent, except of the TFIC with uncorrelated random6 or certain aperiodically modulated7,8 couplings, in which the gap vanishes according to a stretched exponential law \u01eb \u223c e\u2212const\u00b7L\u03a8 with \u03a8 < 1. The paramagnetic phase is gapped in general, but the uncorrelated random model is an exception also in this respect: in the Griffiths-McCoy phase, the gap vanishes algebraically with a non-universal dynamical exponent depending on the control parameter9\u201312. Recently, the interest in the scaling of energy gap has increased from the side of adiabatic quantum computing13,14. Due to its solvability in polynomial time, the TFIC is an ideal testing ground for different quantum annealing protocols in which the TFIC is slowly driven from a large initial transverse field\nthrough the critical point to a classical target Hamiltonian with a zero transverse field15\u201321. A crucial difficulty of quantum annealing is the breaking of adiabaticity at finite annealing rates, i.e. the system will be excited from the instantaneous ground state to higher-lying states during the procedure so that the end state may contain defects with some probability22\u201325. The rate of formation of defects which are to be avoided from the point of view of adiabatic quantum computing is more enhanced at small instantaneous gaps: according to the adiabatic theorem13,26, the necessary computation time is the maximum of the transition matrix element of the time derivative of the instantaneous Hamiltonian divided by the square of the instantaneous gap. The knowledge of the gap of the static TFIC, especially the minimal gap experienced during the annealing procedure is thus important for estimating the efficiency of the protocol or for devising an optimal protocol which minimizes the probability of defect formation. We note here that, due to the parity symmetry of the TFIC, the gap which is relevant for quantum annealing is the gap between the ground state and the first excited state within the ground-state sector, the other sector being unavailable for the dynamics. Nevertheless, the finite-size scaling of this energy difference at the critical point is in general similar to that of the lowest gap.\nApart from the homogeneous chain, the eigenvalue problem of which is analytically solvable1,2,27, there does not exist a closed form of the lowest gap for a general set of couplings and transverse fields. Therefore various numerical methods and analytic approximations have been developed to estimate the gap. For the TFIC with uncorrelated random parameters, the known results on the energy gap are obtained mainly by the strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method6,28\u201331 and by numerical diagonalization32. In addition to this, there exists an approximative formula for the gap of the open chain obtained in Refs.33,34, which is accurate in the ferromagnetic phase and yields the correct finite-size scaling\n2 of the gap even at the critical point. This formula is similar to that obtained perturbatively for the periodic chain in Ref.7. In Ref.35, the terms of the characteristic polynomial beyond the second order one were neglected and the resulting quadratic equation was solved to estimate the scaling of the gap of the random TFIC to the second excited state. Ref.36 went further in this direction and used the truncated characteristic polynomial of much higher order to obtain very accurate numerical estimates of the lowest gap at the critical point and in the ferromagnetic phase. Furthermore, in Ref.36 the Laguerre bound for the smallest root of the characteristic polynomial, which can be calculated from the first three coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, was studied and found to correctly reproduce the finite-size scaling of the exact gap at the critical point and in gapless phases. In this paper, we extend the results concerning the gap of the open TFIC by providing exact lower and upper bounds which are generally valid for any set of possibly random couplings and fields, and are explicit in the parameters of the model. Due to this latter property, they are promising starting points of possible analytic treatments toward the determination of the finite-size scaling of the gap. We will demonstrate the power of these bounds by obtaining the finite-size scaling of the gap of the random TFIC with coupling-field correlations, which is relevant in the context of adiabatic quantum computing and has been studied by several authors35,37\u201341. The derivation rests on an exact relationship between the open TFIC and continuous-time random walks with an absorbing boundary. Some elements of this relationship were discovered in Ref.11 but, in the most complete form, it was formulated by Iglo\u0301i, Turban, and Rieger in Ref.42. In addition to this, the derivation uses properties of the quasistationary distribution of Markov processes and known expressions of the mean time to absorption. The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we recapitulate the bases of the derivation of the bounds: the calculation of excitation spectrum of the TFIC, the mapping to a Markov process, and the relation of the spectral gap to the mean time to absorption. The lower and upper bounds are derived in sections III and IV. Next, these bounds are applied to the homogeneous chain and the random chain with correlated and uncorrelated randomness. Finally, results are discussed in section VI. Some of calculations are presented in the Appendix."

To see this, we use well-known properties of irreducible continuous-time Markov chains with a finite number of states45,46. In this case, the top eigenvalue\u2212\u03bb1 is unique, simple and, due to the similarity to a symmetric matrix, it is real. Moreover, the associated left eigenvector of T can be chosen to be componentwise positive. A distribution q = (q1, q2, . . . , qL) is called quasistationary if it remains constant under the condition of nonabsorption when q is the initial distribution. Finite, irreducible Markov chains are known to have a unique quasistationary distribution which is the (unique) left eigenvector of T associated with eigenvalue \u03bb1: qT = \u2212\u03bb1q, normalized as\n\u2211L n=1 qi = 1.

Obviously, the mean times to absorption monotonically increase with decreasing indices n (being farther from the absorbing site):\n\u03c4m < \u03c4n if m > n. (16)\nSince \u03c4qs = \u2211L\nn=1 qn\u03c4m, qn denoting the quasistationary distribution as before, we obtain immediately that\n\u03c4qs < \u03c41. (17)\nThus, by Eq.

The constant term is C0 = det(MM T ) = [det(M)]2 = h21h 2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7h2L, where we used Eq. (7). The coefficient of the linear term, as it is described in Appendix A, can be shown to be\nC1 = \u2212\u03c41C0. (19)\nOn the other hand, from the factorized form of the characteristic polynomial P (\u03bb) = \u220fL\nn=1(\u03bbn\u2212\u03bb) it is clear that C1 = \u2212C0 \u2211L n=1 \u03bb \u22121 n (which is one of Vie\u0300te\u2019s formulae), therefore \u03c41 is simply the sum of reciprocal eigenvalues:\n\u03c41 =\nL \u2211\nn=1\n\u03bb\u22121n =\nL \u2211\nn=1\n\u01eb\u22122n . (20)\nNow we compare this bound to Laguerre\u2019s lower bound \u03bbLb of all roots used in Ref.\n36, which is composed of the first three coefficients of the characteristic polynomial as\n1 \u03bbLb = \u2212 1 L C1 C0 + \u221a L\u2212 1 L \u221a (L\u2212 1) ( C1 C0 )2 \u2212 2LC2 C0 .\n(21) One can notice, that formally substituting C2 = 0 in the Eq. (21) leads to 1/\u03bbLb(C2 = 0) = \u03c41. Since, according to Vie\u0300te\u2019s formulae C2C0 = \u2211 i<j 1 \u03bbi\u03bbj , which is positive, the lower bound obtained by the random-walk mapping is less sharp than Laguerre\u2019s lower bound:\n1 \u03c41 < \u03bbLb < \u03bb1. (22)\nNevertheless, we will see later that even this weaker bound which, on the other hand, has the advantage of\nbeing simpler than Laguerre\u2019s bound, is sufficient to infer the finite-size scaling of the gap at the critical point. We close this section with the comparison of the approximate formula for the gap derived in Refs.33,34 to our lower bound. As it is shown in Appendix B, the approximate gap is below the lower bound, \u01ebapp <\n1\u221a \u03c41 < \u01eb1, so\nthe latter is a better approximation of the exact gap."

(23)\nOne can improve this bound by noting that using MTM rather than MMT leads to a different bound \u03c4L, which is related to \u03c4L through the inversion in Eq. (9). Then \u01eb1 < 1/\u03c4 max L , where \u03c4 max L = max{\u03c4L, \u03c4L}. Yet, this upper bound is not sufficiently sharp to have the same finite-size scaling as the exact gap at the critical point in general. Nevertheless, this requirement can be fulfilled with a sharper bound constructed by the help of the stationary distribution of a modified Markov chain. Let us consider the Markov process as before but with the restriction to sites 1, 2, . . . , L and with hL = 0. The corresponding rate matrix, which is obtained from T by setting hL = 0, will be denoted by T \u2032. This process has a non-trivial stationary state (p1, p2, . . . , pL), which is the left eigenvector of T \u2032 associated with the zero eigenvalue. By recursion, we obtain this distribution in the form\npn =\n\u220fn\u22121 i=1 h2i J2 i\n\u2211L n=1 \u220fn\u22121 i=1 h2 i\nJ2 i\n, n = 1, 2, . . . , L. (24)\nComparing the quasistationary distribution to this one, one has the intuition that the steady loss of probability at site L in the former case leads to a depletion of probabilities near the absorbing site in favor of those near the opposite end of the chain (keep in mind that q is a normalized distribution). Indeed, as it is proved in Appendix C, there exists an index 1 < n\u2217 < L such that\nqn > pn if n < n \u2217,\nqn\u2217 \u2265 pn\u2217 , and qn < pn if n > n \u2217.

The lower bound is\nvanishing with L as 1\u221a\u03c41 \u2243 \u221a h2\u2212J2\u221a L , thus it is not useful here, whereas the upper bound is asymptotically constant: limL\u2192\u221e\n1\u221a \u03c4s = (h\u2212 J)(1 + Jh ). At the critical point, J = h = 1, the gap vanishes with\nthe system size as1 \u01eb1 = 2 sin( \u03c0 2 1 2L+1 ) = \u03c0 2 1 L + O(L \u22122). For the lower and upper bounds we find here in leading order:\n1\u221a \u03c41\n\u2243 \u221a 2\nL ,\n1\u221a \u03c4s\n\u2243 \u221a 3\nL . (33)\nThus, at the critical point both bounds show the same finite-size scaling, and the scaled gap in the large-L limit limL\u2192\u221e \u01eb1L = \u03c0 2 = 1.57 . . . is bounded relatively tightly\nby \u221a 2 = 1.41 . . . and \u221a 3 = 1.73 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Finally, it is interesting to note that, for J = h = 1, \u03c41 is the sum of natural numbers up to L , whereas \u03c4s is the sum of the squares of natural numbers up to L, divided by L."

            "text": "Next, we apply the bounds obtained in the previous sections to infer the finite-size scaling of the gap of the random TFIC in which the fields are correlated with neighboring couplings. We consider a general form of such correlations used in Ref.41: the couplings are independent, identically distributed random variables, while the fields are fixed by neighboring couplings as\nh1 = J 1\u2212s 1 , hn = J s n\u22121J 1\u2212s n , 1 < n < L hL = J s L\u22121. (34)\nHere, the parameter s is in the range 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1. The special case s = 0 was studied in Refs.37\u201340, while the symmetric case s = 12 was considered in Ref.\n35. By the choice of the fields as given in Eq. (34), the model is critical, and the fluctuations of the sample-dependent control parameter uL = \u2211L\u22121\nn=1 ln(Jn/hn), which follow the central limit theorem for uncorrelated randomness, become independent of L. The relevance of this for adiabatic quantum computing is that, for such a choice of fields (multiplied by a global driving field), the minimal gap during the annealing process, which closes stretched exponentially for uniform fields, will be less tiny, closing only algebraically with L. According to numerical results38,39 obtained with a power-law distribution of couplings\n\u03c1(J) = 1\nD J\u22121+ 1 D , (35)\nwith the support 0 < J < 1 and the parameter D > 0 which controls the strength of disorder, the critical dynamical exponent is z = 1 for weak enough disorder D < Dc, and z > 1 otherwise. Later it was confirmed by an exact lower bound on the dynamical exponent41.\n6 We will now show that the lower and the upper bound derived in this paper show the same typical finite-size dependence and determine thereby the dynamical exponent of the model. Expressing the fields with the couplings as given in Eq. (34), we obtain for the sums relevant for the lower and upper bounds:\n\u03c41 = L \u2211\nl=1\nl \u2211\nm=1\nJ \u22122(1\u2212s) l J \u22122s m\u22121 (36)\nand\n\u03c4s =\n[\nL \u2211\nn=1\nJ\u22122sn\n]\u22121 L \u2211\nn=1\nL \u2211\nl=n\nl \u2211\nm=1\nJ\u22122sn\u22121J \u22122(1\u2212s) l J \u22122s m\u22121,\n(37) with the convention J0 = JL = 1. To shorten the notation we introduce xn \u2261 J\u22122n . Extending the upper limit of the second sum in Eq. (36) to L, we have\n\u03c41 < \u03c4 \u2032 1 =\n[\nL \u2211\nm=1\nxsm\n] [\nL \u2211\nl=1\nx1\u2212sl\n]\n, (38)\nand we obtain thereby another lower bound 1/ \u221a \u03c4 \u20321 < \u01eb1, which is less sharp than the original one but more appropriate for our purposes. Considering the upper bound, we rewrite Eq. (37) as \u03c4s = [ \u2211L n=1 x s n ]\u22121 \u2211L l=1 \u2211l n=1 \u2211l m=1 x 1\u2212s l x s n\u22121x s m\u22121. By restricting the lower limit of the first sum and the upper limits of the remaining two sums of the triple sum to [L/2]+1, where [L/2] denotes the integer part of L/2, we have\n\u03c4s > \u03c4 \u2032 s =\n[\nL \u2211\nn=1\nxsn\n]\u22121 \n\nL \u2211\nl=[L/2]+1\nx1\u2212sl\n\n\n\n\n[L/2] \u2211\nn=0\nxsn\n\n\n2\n,\n(39)\nand we obtain the upper bound \u01eb1 < 1/ \u221a \u03c4 \u2032s. We can see that both \u03c4 \u20321 and \u03c4 \u2032 s are expressed in terms of sums of independent random variables of the form\nS\u03c3 = \u2211\nn\nx\u03c3n, (40)\nwith N = O(L) terms and \u03c3 is either s or 1 \u2212 s. The large-N behavior of such a sum is well known49,50 to depend on the exponent \u00b5 characterizing the large-y tail of the distribution of y \u2261 x\u03c3, \u03c1(y) \u223c y\u22121\u2212\u00b5. Using the distribution of couplings in Eq. (35), this exponent is expressed as\n\u00b5 = 1\n2D\u03c3 . (41)\nFor 0 < \u00b5 < 1, the expected value y is infinite, and the typical value of S\u03c3, defined as [S\u03c3]typ = exp lnS\u03c3, is in leading order proportional to N1/\u00b5: [S\u03c3]typ \u223c N1/\u00b5. For \u00b5 = 1, y is still infinite, and [S\u03c3]typ \u223c N lnN . For\n\u00b5 > 1, y is finite, and both the typical and mean values are proportional to N : [S\u03c3]typ \u223c N , S\u03c3 = yN . We can see from Eq. (38) and Eq. (39) that the typical values of \u03c4 \u20321 and \u03c4 \u2032 s are in leading order proportional to a product of typical sums\n[\u03c4 \u20321]typ \u223c [\u03c4 \u2032s]typ \u223c [Ss(L)]typ[S1\u2212s(L)]typ. (42)\nAs a consequence, the leading order L-dependence of the typical gap must be the same as that of the following combination of typical sums:\n[\u01eb1]typ \u223c 1 \u221a\n[Ss(L)]typ[S1\u2212s(L)]typ . (43)\nUsing this relation, Eq. (41), and the known Ldependence of typical sums, we find for the L-dependence of the typical gap:\n[\u01eb1]typ(L) \u223c L\u2212zfs(L)f1\u2212s(L), (44)\nwith the dynamical exponent\nz = max{Ds, 1 2 }+max{D(1\u2212 s), 1 2 } (45)\nand logarithmic factors for special points:\nf\u03c3(L) =\n{\n1\u221a lnL if 2D\u03c3 = 1\n1 otherwise. (46)\nThe lower bound for the dynamical exponent obtained in Ref.41 from an upper bound on the average gap coincides with z in Eq. (45), but that treatment does not account for the logarithmic factors. For the asymmetric case s = 0, there is a special pointD = Dc = 1/2, at which the logarithmic correction appears as [\u01eb1]typ \u223c 1L\u221alnL and this explains why the numerically estimated dynamical exponents presented in Ref.38 deviate from the asymptotic value around this point. In Ref.41, similar deviations of numerically estimated dynamical exponents appear in the case D = 1 at the symmetric point s = 12 , where according to our results [\u01eb1]typ \u223c 1L lnL ."

            "text": "Finally, we consider the TFIC with independent, identically distributed random couplings and fields and compare the upper and lower bounds with the gap obtained by the SDRG approximation. First, we write \u03c4n in terms of the cumulative control parameter defined in Eq. (B1) as\n\u03c4n =\nL \u2211\nl=n\nl \u2211\nm=1\n1\nh2l e2(ul\u2212um). (47)\nFor uncorrelated disorder, un is a random walk in discrete time n and its mean value behaves as un \u223c n in the\n7 ferromagnetic phase, un \u223c \u2212n in the paramagnetic phase and un = 0 at the critical point. The fluctuations around the average are O( \u221a n). The energy gap obtained by the\nSDRG method6 is \u01ebRG = min1\u2264m<l<L\n{\nJmJm+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Jl\u22121 hmhm+1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7hl\n}\n= [\nmax1\u2264m<l<L{ 1hl e ul\u2212um}\n]\u22121 . Thus the SDRG gap is\nessentially determined by the maximal difference in un, umax = max1\u2264m<l<L{ul \u2212 um}, as \u01ebRG \u223c e\u2212umax . In the ferromagnetic phase umax \u2248 ln(J/h)L, which yields an exponentially closing gap. At the critical point, the maximal difference scales as umax \u223c \u221a L, resulting in the stretched exponential scaling \u01ebRG \u223c e\u2212C \u221a L, where C is an O(1) random variable29. In the paramagnetic Griffiths-McCoy phase umax \u223c lnL, leading to an algebraic decay \u01ebRG \u223c L\u2212z with a non-universal dynamical exponent9,10,30. Beyond the Griffiths-McCoy phase, in the conventional paramagnetic phase, umax is bounded from above and a finite gap opens. We can see in Eq. (47), that the dominant term in \u03c41 is max1\u2264m<l<L{ 1h2 l\ne2(ul\u2212um)} = \u01eb\u22122RG. Therefore the lower bound is expected to scale with L in the same way as \u01ebRG. Furthermore, we can establish that 1/ \u221a \u03c41 is a\nlower bound also for the SDRG gap: 1/ \u221a \u03c41 < \u01ebRG. In fact, numerical results of Ref.36 indicate that \u01ebRG exceeds the exact value of the gap. Next, let us consider the upper bound 1/ \u221a \u03c4s. The stationary distribution in Eq. (24) can be written in terms of un as\npn = N exp[2(unmin \u2212 un)], (48)\nwhere nmin denotes the global minimum of un, unmin = minn{un}. Due to the rapid decrease of pn with unmin \u2212 un, pn is typically localized around site nmin and, consequently, the normalization is N = O(1). Then \u03c4s can be written as\n\u03c4s = N L \u2211\nl=1\nl \u2211\nn=1\nl \u2211\nm=1\n1\nh2l exp[2(unmin+ul\u2212un\u2212um)]. (49)\nThe dominant term of this expression is determined by max{ul \u2212 un \u2212 um} under the conditions 1 \u2264 l \u2264 L and 1 \u2264 n,m \u2264 L. Obviously, the optimal indices n and m must coincide, therefore we look for the following maximum\nmax 1\u2264n\u2264l\u2264L\n{ul \u2212 2un}. (50)\nDenoting the indices which optimize Eq. (50) by l\u2217 and n\u2217, the dominant term of \u03c4s is then\n\u03c4s \u223c exp[2(unmin + ul\u2217 \u2212 2un\u2217)]. (51)\nIn the ferromagnetic phase, nmin \u223c 1, l\u2217 \u223c L, and n\u2217 \u223c 1. The dominant term is thus \u03c4s \u223c e2uL , which leads to the same exponential decrease of the upper bound 1/ \u221a \u03c4s \u223c e\u2212uL (apart from the prefactor) as that of the lower bound. At the critical point, the dominant term in Eq. (51) is in general different from the\nterm related to the SDRG gap. It coincides with 1/\u01eb2RG only if n\u2217 = nmin, otherwise they are different. Nevertheless, due to the O( \u221a n) fluctuations of un, the upper bound shows the same type of stretched exponential scaling as the lower bound: 1/ \u221a \u03c4s \u223c e\u2212C \u2032 \u221a L. Finally, in the Griffiths-McCoy phase and in the conventional paramagnetic phase nmin \u223c L, l\u2217 \u223c L, and n\u2217 \u223c L. Here, \u03c4s \u223c O(1), yielding an L-independent upper bound, which fails to correctly reproduce the algebraic decrease of the gap in the Griffiths-McCoy phase."

            "text": "Based on an exact relationship with the spectrum of a Markov process, we have formulated lower and upper bounds on the lowest energy gap of open transverse-field Ising chains, which are explicit in the parameters of the model and are valid for arbitrary sets of (non-zero) couplings and fields. In the ferromagnetic phase and at the critical point, both bounds show the same leading finite-size dependence (with different prefactors). In the homogeneous chain, the upper bound reproduces the correct prefactor in ferromagnetic phase, while at the critical point, the prefactor of the lower bound is slightly closer to the exact one. In the gapped paramagnetic phase, both bounds tend to constants in the limit L \u2192 \u221e (the lower bound to zero), and the upper bound becomes more and more accurate farther from the critical point. In the random TFIC with coupling-field correlations, which is critical and which is a relevant model for adiabatic quantum computing, we showed by the help of the bounds that the finite-size scaling of the gap is related to that of sums of independent random variables. Besides the algebraic closing of the typical (as well as the average) gap we revealed the existence of logarithmic corrections at certain special points. The relation of the gap to sums of independent random variables also indicates that, in the anomalous region z > 1, the gap is essentially determined by the smallest coupling present in the sample, the corresponding term dominating either of or both the sums. In the case of uncorrelated disorder, both bounds show the same finite-size scaling in the ferromagnetic phase and at the critical point. Furthermore the lower bound accounts for the algebraically vanishing gap in the Griffiths-McCoy phase, while the upper bound fails to reproduce this (giving a non-vanishing limit). We found that the lower bound outperformed the upper bound also at the critical point. The former is dominated by the term provided by the SDRG approximation whenever the gap vanishes, including the GriffithsMcCoy phase. In the upper bound, which contains the sum \u03c4s \u223c \u2211 n e \u22122un\u03c4n, the effect of the weighting by e\u22122un is to enhance the term \u03c4nmin at the minimum of the cumulative control parameter. Therefore the dominant term in the upper bound coincides with the SDRG term (related to the maximal increase of un) only if the\n8 starting index of the SDRG term is the same as the global minimum position of un. Otherwise the upper bound is dominated by some subleading increasing segment of un, which nonetheless, has the same stretched exponential scaling as the leading one.\nThe lower bound used in this paper, although it is less sharp than Laguerre\u2019s bound, still shows the same finitesize scaling at the critical point as the exact gap and, due to its simplicity may be more appropriate for analytic treatments, as it was demonstrated for the random TFIC with coupling-field correlations.\nAlthough we formulated the bounds for the transversefield Ising chain, they apply also to the closely related XY spin chains and free-fermion hopping models on an open chain. Moreover, the bounds are generally valid for the lowest eigenvalue of tridiagonal matrices of the form T = BBT , where B is a bidiagonal matrix with real and non-zero diagonal and subdiagonal elements."
