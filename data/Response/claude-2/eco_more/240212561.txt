 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop algorithms to solve the general robust appointment scheduling problem with waiting time guarantees (RASWTG) more efficiently for larger numbers of patients. The paper shows the problem is NP-hard, but more scalable solution methods could expand applicability.

2. Extend the model to consider sequence-dependent setup times between patients. This would more realistically capture operations in healthcare settings. Optimal sequencing rules and algorithms would need to account for setups. 

3. Incorporate patient preferences for appointment times into the model. This could involve allowing patients to specify time windows for their appointments. The scheduling algorithm would then need to balance preferences with waiting time guarantees.

4. Develop online or dynamic scheduling policies that set appointment times as patients call to request appointments. This would require adapting the robust optimization model and algorithms to an online setting.

5. Conduct more extensive computational testing on real patient data from diverse healthcare settings. This could provide further insights into the cost and waiting time improvements possible with the robust optimization approach in practice.
