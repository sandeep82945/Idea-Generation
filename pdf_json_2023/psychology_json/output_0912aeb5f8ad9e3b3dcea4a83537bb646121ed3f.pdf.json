    "abstractText": "Endocytosis is one of the major ways cells communicate with their environment. This process is frequently hijacked by pathogens. Endocytosis also participates in the oncogenic transformation. Here, we review the approaches to inhibit endocytosis, discuss chemical inhibitors of this process, and discuss potential clinical applications of the endocytosis inhibitors.",

            "text": "Endocytosis is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the regulation of numerous intracellular signaling cascades, cell migration, and antigen presentation, among others. Cell sensitivity to certain ligands is modified by the endocytosis of receptors from the membrane surface [1]. Endocytosis results in the formation of membrane vesicles, which transport a variety of cargo molecules from the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells to the cytoplasm. The cargo consisting of transmembrane proteins and their ligands are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including cell signaling, nutrient uptake, developmental regulation, and cell adhesion [2]. The most well-recognized endocytosis pathway is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Figure 1). Clathrin forms a framework for vesicles with cargoes attached to specific receptors; it mediates a large proportion of endocytosis events. However, some cells are capable of clathrin-independent endocytosis [3]. Depending on the involvement of specific proteins or lipids and the ability to internalize specific cargoes, we can divide clathrin-independent endocytosis into several types that we will discuss below [4]. Pathogens can also enter the cell by endocytosis. For infection to occur, viruses must first bind to the outer membrane. This interaction might be nonspecific or occur via viral receptors; it promotes the pathogen entry by initiating conformational changes in the virus itself, activating signaling pathways, and inducing endocytosis [5\u20137]. Endocytosis is also affected in different human pathologies, including cancer, where the deregulation of multiple endocytic proteins and pathways favors metastasis (reviewed in [7]). Endocytosis dysfunction occurs in other pathological conditions, such as heart diseases [8], lipid disorders [9], and atherosclerosis [10], which are undeniably the main contributors to human mortality worldwide. Endocytosis disturbances are also observed in lung diseases characterized by increased contractility, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary\nCells 2023, 12, 2312. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12182312 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 2 of 32\ndisease (COPD) [11].

When cargo is engulfed, a tight-fitting membrane encircles it and continues to\nwrap around it until scission from the plasma membrane Actin filaments start to depoly-\nmerize from the phagocytic cup\u2019s base once the particle has been absorbed; this causes the\ncup to form a membrane-bound vacuole known as the phagosome. Dynamin 2 is required\nfor the phagocytic cup expansion. The maturation of the phagosome involves the acquisi-\ntion of Rab GTPases, microtubule-dependent trafficking through dynein/dynactin, re-\ncruitment of components of the autophagosomal machinery, and selective retrieval of\nmembrane-associated components. The mature phagosome fuses with the lysosomes and\nforms a phagolysosome [43,44]. This process depends on small G proteins in the clathrin-\nindependent internalization of opsonized particles. After binding of Fc receptors by anti-\nbody constant regions, extensions around the particle are produced in a Cdc42-dependent\nmanner, and subsequent internalization is Rac1-dependent [45] (Figure 7).\nFigure 6.

Cav-1, which is extensively expressed in endothelial cells, is necessary for the development and upkeep of caveolae in non-muscle cells. This protein controls vascular development and remodeling, calcium concentration, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and nitric oxide (NO) levels [56]. G-protein-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinases, and signaling enzymes are all caveolinassociated proteins. Consequently, Cav-1 may mediate a variety of cellular consequences [57,58]. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) plays an important role in the cardiovascular system. eNOS, which catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO, generates the constitutive vasodilator NO [59\u201362]. In contrast, the Cav-1 CSD peptide had no effect on animals lacking eNOS, suggesting that CSD peptides may control vascular disease by way of other proteins [58,63]. Cav1 peptide injection preserved left ventricular function after reperfusion in isolated rat hearts [64]. Increased NO production and decreased immune cell adhesion were noted, and this was related to the suppression of PKC, a Cav-1-regulated protein that blocks eNOS action [65,66]. Cav-1-deficient animals with hyperactivated ERK 1/2 signaling displayed cardiac hypertrophy [67]. Cav-1-deficient mice also display right ventricular hypertrophy and dilated left ventricles [68]."

New factors limiting the intracellular trafficking of LDL and the LDL receptor continue to be discovered as targets for drugs such as Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) [70], IDOL [71], and COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) [72]. Endocytosis of LDL and residual lipoproteins, as well as the subsequent intracellular accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages, is a key step in the genesis of atherosclerosis [73]. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can migrate from the arterial center\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 9 of 32\nwith trapped lipoproteins [74,75]. Moreover, VSMCs contribute to as much as 50% of foam cells in intermediate atherosclerotic lesions of coronary arteries. Experiments in mice have revealed that about 30% of all cells in atherosclerotic plaques are derived from VSMCs [76\u201378]. The acquisition of the macrophage phenotype [78\u201381] and subsequent transformation into foam cells represents an important early step in the development of the disease. An important stage in the development of atherosclerotic plaque, perhaps even before the formation of monocyte-derived foam cells [82], may be induced by cholesterol loading [83,84] and is probably dependent on lipoprotein endocytosis in vivo. Foam cells express several markers that are also characteristic of macrophage-derived foam cells [76]."

Caveolin-2 immunoreactivity showed a similar distribution pattern [85]. Mice lacking caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 have severe lung abnormalities [86\u201388], and abnormal caveolin-1/2 expression is involved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and pulmonary hypertension [89\u201391]. Obstructive airway diseases, like asthma or COPD, are characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled and endogenous bronchoconstrictors [11], accompanied in part by abnormalities in airway smooth muscle spasms [92\u201395]. In vitro, caveolin-1 expression increases when airway smooth muscle cells mature to a contractile phenotype [96]. Moreover, the number of caveolae on smooth muscle cells is highest in mature myocytes [97,98]. These observations suggest an important role for caveolin in regulating contractile function. Caveolins play important roles in mesenchymal cell proliferation. Reducing or silencing Cav-1 expression induces spontaneous proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells [96,99,100]. Conversely, overexpression of Cav-1 induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits growth-factor-induced proliferation of smooth muscle cells [101\u2013103]. In addition, airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts that are in the G0/G1 phase increase endogenous expression of Cav-1 [96,99,100].

This is indicated by the discovery of complex biological mechanisms by which endocytosis may be involved in cell proliferation [104]. Among these is the presence of genetic mutations that involve endocytic proteins in leukemia [105]. The final effect of endocytosis is the posttranslational ubiquitination of endocytic proteins and receptors from the membrane surface as a sorting signal in this pathway [106]. During ubiquitination, a small peptide called ubiquitin is attached to selected proteins by ubiquitin ligases or E3 enzymes. When the ubiquitin in the substrate forms the appropriate chain length, the protein is targeted for proteasomal degradation [107]. However, a single ubiquitin molecule attached to the substrate can perform a signaling function by interaction with ubiquitin-binding domains [106]. Receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGFR, have single ubiquitin molecules at multiple sites, which is sufficient for endocytosis and receptor degradation to occur [108]. RTK becomes monoubiquitinated using the E3 ligase Cbl, which acts as an adaptor protein. Interestingly, Cbl transformation and modulation of endocytosis induced by this protein might be involved in oncogenesis [109]. The connection between tumor progression and clathrin-mediated endocytosis was demonstrated by Bao and Yarden, who revealed that active Src, which is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase [110], promotes Cbl destruction. Proteasomal degradation of Cbl was promoted through its tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, resulting in increased\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 10 of 32\nEGFR expression.

However, they can promote membrane passage using endogenous cellular responses. At the molecular level, activation of endogenous cellular responses helps viruses to cross membranes and other barriers and deliver their genes to the cytosol or the nucleus. To initiate the entry, viruses first need to bind to the surface of the host cell. This can occur non-specifically through various adhesion factors (heparan sulfate or other carbohydrate structures) [120]. The use of receptors that actively promote entry is an alternative pathway. This can be accomplished by altering the viral particle\u2019s shape through signaling pathways, encouraging endocytosis, or both. Receptors are essential in defining which cell types can be infected because their interactions with viruses are quite selective [5]. Viruses are able to utilize more than one kind of receptor; e.g., HIV-1 uses both CD4 and chemokine receptors [121]. Interestingly, HIV-1 can also bind to heparan sulfate, which may promote the initial recruitment of the virus onto vulnerable cells [120,122]. CME is the most common pathway used by viruses. It transports incoming viruses along with their receptors to early and late endosomes. This process is usually rapid and efficient [123]. Most viruses enter through coated pits, which accumulate under the membrane-bound virus particles. For virus endocytosis to occur via a CME, induction of transmembrane signaling between the virus and the receptor is required [124]. However, it is unclear whether this process is initiated by the recruitment of clathrin coat components to the clustered cytoplasmic domains of viral receptor proteins or by a more complex signaling cascade leading to clathrin recruitment. Entering virions are exposed to the acidic environment of endosomes within minutes after internalization, and changes in pH can lead to viral penetration. However, in some cases, such as Ebola virus and SARS-CoV [125], acidic pH alone is not sufficient to induce fusion, and proteolytic cleavage of viral proteins, particularly via cathepsin L and B, is necessary [126\u2013128]. Capsids of SV40 and related polyomaviruses consist of 72 homopentamers, which are similar to the pentamers of the B chain of cholera toxin [129,130]. Both cholera toxin and these polyomaviruses enter cells through caveolar pathways dependent on cholesterol and activation of signaling cascades [131\u2013134]. Dynamin 2, actin, caveolin-1, and Rho GTPases are involved in the activation of this pathway, depending on the virus and cell type [135]. SV40 internalization by caveolin-dependent endocytosis is regulated by at least five different kinases [136]. Inhibiting them, especially tyrosine kinases, results in a significant reduction in cell infection [135]. A pathway by which a virus can enter into a cell can differ depending on the cell type. Pathways depend on host cell kinases, dynamin, Rac, Rab, and Arf family GTPases, actin\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 12 of 32\nand tubulin, and cholesterol [137]. Thus, viruses such as SV40 and influenza can use several different pathways, allowing them to infect a wide range of cells under different conditions."

Proteins, peptides, siRNAs, and plasmid DNA can all be successfully delivered into cells using CPPs [138]. Typically, these peptides include 5 to 30 amino acids [139]. Depending on the physicochemical characteristics of both the CPP and its cargo, different pathways can be used for CPP uptake [138]. Most of the time, endocytosis takes place in physiological settings and at low peptide concentrations. CPPs can directly cross the cellular membrane at greater concentrations [140]. Full-size and unconjugated HIV-1 Tat peptide, oligo-arginines, as well as anionic CPPs (i.e., MPG\u03b1/siRNA complexes, NickFect1 stearylated transportan 10 (TP10) analog), use CME [138]. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is used by Tat fusion proteins [141], proline-rich CPPs [142], stearylated transportan analogs [143], amphipathic azurin fragments p18 and p28 [138], and N-terminus of VP1 from chicken anemia virus (CVP1) [144]. Octa-arginine (R8) and Tat provoke actin rearrangement in the initial moments of interaction with cell membranes. Macropinocytosis participates in the transport of arginine-rich CPPs such as R8 [145], nona-arginine (R9), dodeca-arginine (R12), Tat peptides and Flock House Virus-derived peptide [146\u2013149].

The uptake of nanoparticles into the cell depends on a number of physical parameters [152]. Particle size is clearly one of the critical parameters in endocytosis. Caveolin-based vesicles generally are smaller (average 60 nm) compared to clathrin-based vesicles (average 120 nm); therefore, larger NPs are taken up by cells via the clathrin-dependent pathway. Particles larger than 4500 nm enter cells only by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis, while other endocytosis mechanisms are limited in cargo size, with a maximum of ~200\u2013300 nm [153]. Nanoparticle shape also affects its uptake by the cell. Differences in cell membrane curvature, reduction of available receptor binding sites, uneven protein coverage, and lack of multivalent binding to receptors are involved [154]. The surface charge of NPs affects their behavior in biological environments. The surface charge of NPs may depend on biomolecules adsorbed on the surface or on the pH of the environment. The internalization of cationic NPs is more efficient compared to neutral and anionic NPs [155,156]. Further information on the endocytosis of nanoparticles can be found elsewhere [157,158]."

When intracellular K+ levels fall below a threshold of 40% of the physiological values, the surface binding of LDL and EGF is not altered, but the internalization of ligands is severely inhibited. The arrest of endocytosis, in this case, is associated with a significant reduction in the number of coated pits and an apparent decrease in the presence of clathrin on the cell membrane. Subsequent addition of KCl to the culture medium restores intracellular K+ levels and endocytosis and leads to clathrin apparition in CCPs [159].\n7.1.2.

Cells in a hypertonic environment do not accumulate the peptide; however, cells still form and process endosomes containing liquid phase markers. This inhibition is independent of the solvent: sodium chloride, sucrose, and lactose inhibit uptake to a similar degree. The hypertonic medium had little effect on saturated peptide binding; however, it prevented the clustering of surface molecules [160].\n7.1.3.

However, acidification of the cytoplasm below pH 6.8 blocks the uptake of fluid phase markers, as well as the internalization and recycling of transferrin. Both macropinocytosis and receptor-induced endocytosis restart when the pH of the cytoplasm returns to physiological values. Low cytoplasmic pH also inhibits the rate of intracellular transport from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. Acidification of the cytosol to pH < 6.8 reversibly inhibits membrane transport of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by both endocytic and exocytic pathways.

Monodansylcadaverine (MDC)\nMonodansylcadaverine (MDC) is an in vivo marker for autophagic vacuoles and a relatively specific blocker of CME. The inhibitory activity of MDC has been attributed to the stabilization of clathrin-coated pits. However, evidence for this mechanism has only been obtained in cell-free systems using purified clathrin and very high concentrations of MDC. It remains to be investigated whether similar stabilization of clathrin-coated pits can be achieved at lower (100\u2013300 \u00b5M) concentrations of MDC, which impair endocytosis in living cells [173]."

Seven sheets are joined\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 15 of 32\nto form the propeller-like CTD [175]. Small helical segments are located in the prolonged gap between blades 1\u20137 and 3\u20134 of the rotor. In order to connect with adaptor proteins and enable direct cargo attachment, the terminal domain expands inward. Short linear peptide sequences are used by adaptors to bind to the terminal domain [176]. A brief helical linker, followed by an ankle region, connects the CTD to the distal leg [177]. ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein (GGA1) and the beta chains of AP-1 and AP-2 have sites in the ankle. Important C682 and G710 residues can be found in this binding site [178]. Several more clathrin-binding sites exist. The rest of the essential residues for binding (Q89, F91, K96, and K98) are situated between the blades of the first structure, known as the clathrin box, which corresponds to the propeller\u2019s blades 1 and 2 [175,176]. The W-Box, which binds proteins with the sequence PWXXW, where X is any amino acid, is the second binding site. I154, F27, Q152, and I170 are the important residues at this position [176,179]. Arrestin 2L binding occurs at another position. Indicated by T235, V190, Q192, W164, L183, E232, R188, 231, I194 and K245, it is located between blades 4 and 5. A binding motif is present in the AP-2 -2 subunit, perhaps making it possible to attach to both site 1 and site 3 [180]. The final suggested location has the following residues: N175, G179, R221, F252, Q23, and F260 between blades 5 and 6. A molecular dynamics investigation of putative bolinaquinone binding sites led to the suggestion of this location [181,182].\nPitstop Family\nPitstops were designed as inhibitors of the terminal domain of clathrin, binding to the clathrin-box motif site (Figure 10). The effect of rhodanine-based pitstop 2 on clathrindependent endocytosis is observed within minutes of cell exposure to the compound. [183]. Treatment of human cultured cells (BEAS-2b, COS-7, HeLa) with Pitstop2 at a concentration of 20 mM resulted in blocking the internalization of transferrin and MHCI, although MHCI still could bind to the cell surface. Endocytosis of CIE-translocated proteins was verified in the presence of pitstop2, CD59 protein (which has the same translocation pathway as MHCI) anchored to GPI was blocked by this substance. Other proteins (CD44, CD98, and CD147) that have a different translocation pathway than CD59 also had their internalization inhibited, and in the control sample, these proteins were observed in recycling endosomes. Inhibition of endocytosis by pitstop 2 occurs after 10 min of exposure and is reversible. In COS-7 and BEAS-2B cells, the same effect was observed on the two types of endocytosis by blocking the n-terminal domain of clathrin. Inhibition of transferrin and MHCI endocytosis was also observed in cells lacking the \u00b52 subunit of AP2 or the heavy chain, suggesting that pitstop blocks CIE independently of clathrin [184]."

            "heading": "7.4. Inhibition of Dynamin",
            "text": "The superfamily of dynamin-like proteins, which are GTPase-type proteins, includes dynamin [185]. Both humans and more basic species like bacteria include the existence of dynamin [186]. Dynamins set themselves apart from normal GTPases by having a larger GTPase domain (~300 amino acid residues), a more developed capacity for selforganization [187\u2013189], and stronger activity to degrade GTP [190,191]. Dynamin is recruited during the creation of clathrin-coated vesicles to separate them from the extracellular membrane, and it has a size of 100 kDa [192]. Mammals have three different forms of dynamin, known as classical dynamins (I, II, and III) [193,194]. Both share the same domain organization and are 80% homologous; however, their expression differs. Vesicle splitting occurs during specialized neuronal function and involves all three dynamins. The pleckstrin homology domain (PH), middle domain (MD), GTPase effector domain (GED), and proline-rich carboxyterminal domain (PR) are the five domains that make up the expanded structure of classical dynamin [191,195,196]. Ras GTPases require guanine exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins, whereas the GTPase domain is activated by nucleotide-dependent dimerization [188,197]. The GTPase domain contains four GTPase binding motifs: G1, or P-loop, binds phosphate; G2, where threonine coordinates the Mg2+ ion, allows GTP hydrolysis; G3, where aspartate coordinates the Mg2+ ion and glycine\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 16 of 32\nbinds phosphate; and G4, where nucleotide base is bound [198,199]. Pleckstrin and the PH domain are highly homologous [191]. Three loops show the most variety. Each of them exhibits an area that is primarily hydrophobic and has a positive charge within the binding site to encourage membrane contacts, dynamin polymerization, and membrane curvature [200]. Dynamin\u2019s PH domain binds to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) with a preference over other lipids [201,202]. CME is inhibited by phosphoinositide (PI(4,5)P2) binding defects in dynamin mutations with a PH domain [203]. A PRD is unique to classical dynamin. It is a protein\u2013protein interaction domain for many signaling and cytoskeletal proteins, consisting of a number of BAR and SH3 domain binding sites specified by the PXXP motif [186,204]. It functions to bring dynamin to endocytotic locations and coordinate dynamin activity with these other components. The primary role of PRD is to guide dynamin to the cell\u2019s site of action [205\u2013207]. In vivo, dynamin I is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where it mediates synaptic vesicle endocytosis, particularly in response to depolarizing stimulation [208]. Dynamin I has also been found in non-neuronal cell line cultures, even though it typically is not expressed in tissues outside of the CNS [209]. In synapses, dynamin I phosphorylation occurs both at rest and during nerve stimulation. In order to facilitate the interaction of dynamin with endocytic proteins to promote endocytosis, it is quickly dephosphorylated at S774 and S778 by calcium-dependent phosphatase and calcineurin [210]. More specifically, this dephosphorylation is thought to play a role in triggering activity-dependent endocytosis [205]. Dynamin is also brought to the membrane via dephosphorylation, and GTPase activity inhibition may give time for binding to the neck of the developing vesicle before GTPase hydrolyzes to speed up cleavage [191]. All tissues express dynamin II, which plays a significant role in CME. Dynamin II also participates in caveolae budding [211], phagocytosis [212], and cellular functions independent of endocytosis, such as cytokinesis [213] and mitosis [214]. A postsynaptic function of dynamin III is thought to include the formation of specific endocytic sites that recycle AMPA (amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionic acid) receptors found in the protrusions of dendritic spines locally [215].\n7.4.1. Long-Chain Amines and Long-Chain Ammonium Salts\nSmall-molecule inhibitors, long-chain amines, and long-chain ammonium salts were among the first dynamin and CME inhibitors. The compounds in the series myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MiTMAB) and OcTMAB (Octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) are surface active and are predicted to alter protein\u2013lipid interactions (Figure 11). MiTMAB is the most active of these compounds, with an IC50 = 3.15 \u00b1 0.64 \u00b5M [216]. The suggested mechanism of action of MiTMAB is dynamin\u2013phospholipid inhibition. In nonneuronal cells, MiTMAB inhibits endocytosis of transferrin and EGF on various cell lines. MiTMAB inhibits the GTPase activities of dynamin I or dynamin II. At high concentrations, MiTMAB is a cationic surfactant, as observed with other pharmacologically active cationic amphiphilic compounds, such as chlorpromazine or imipramine [217].\n7.4.2. Antipsychotic Drugs (APD)\u2014Phenothiazines\nThe central ring of phenothiazines contains heteroatoms of nitrogen and sulfur and has a tricyclic heterocyclic structure. APD phenothiazine drugs inhibit GTPases DynI DynII and CME in cells in vitro. It is likely that these compounds work by interfering with the PH domain of dynamin, which is responsible for dynamin detachment. In addition, chlorpromazine did not interfere with AP-2 or clathrin recruitment and did not inhibit CCV formation. These effects are similar for the entire class of APDs. Compounds that inhibited dynamin also showed inhibitory effects on CME. The IC50 of trifluoperazine and its non-APD derivative against DynI was in the region of 2 \u00b5M.

Room-temperature Ionic Liquid (RTIL)\nRoom-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) is a substance derived from the Spanish fly aphrodisiac cantharidin. RTILs are imidazole or pyridine salts with a melting point below 150 \u25e6C (Figure 12). A group of these compounds showed an inhibitory effect on dynamin by blocking the PH domain. Lengthening the alkyl chain from C4 to C18 increased the inhibitory effect of the compounds. The most active against dynamin GTPase activity was RTIL 13, with 15% inhibition at 300 \u00b5M drug concentration and IC50 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M [221].\n7.4.5. Dimeric Tyrphostins (Bis-T)\nDimeric tyrphostins (Bis-T) exhibit activity against the enzyme dynamin I but have a weak inhibitory effect on CME. The most active dynamin I inhibitor is compound Bis-T-22, with an IC50 of 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M. The mechanism of action of this compound is unclear; it neither affects GTP nor competes with GTP or lipids. The inhibitory potency of this class of compounds requires a dimers with two aromatic rings, where the rings contain two -OH groups at the -3,-4 positions; the presence of two free amide -NH or ester -O groups in the linker arm, and the presence of -CN is also of great importance [222]. A new Bis-T-22 prodrug created by adding propionic acid ester has an enhanced ability to pass through membranes; it is rapidly hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm to the parent compound. Despite its strong activity against dynamin, it had a weak effect on CME inhibition. The new prodrug of Bis-T-22 inhibits CME with an IC50 of 8.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b5M [223].\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 18 of 32\nCells 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 34"

The inhibitory activity f Dynasore is observed 1\u20132 min after the start of treatment, presumed to be limited by diffusion to the molecular target. This effect is reversible about 20 min after the inhibitor is removed. Dynasore is a non-competitive inhibitor of GTP hydrolysis, with no effect on GTP binding affinity or dynamin self-organization. In addition, testing for DynI inhibition has shown that the compound exhibits inhibitory activity against transferrin endocytosis and the LDL receptor. Unfortunately, this compound has side effects. It binds to serum proteins, which reduces its target inhibitory effect, and to detergents, which may prevent analytic manipulations with this compound in vitro [224].\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 19 of 32\n7.4.7. Dynoles\nDynoles are the first generation of indole-based dynamin inhibitors of DynI GTPase. Dynole 34-2 is the best one with an IC50 of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M (15x more potent than dynasore). This compound is characterized by high lipophilicity and, thus, permeability through cell membranes, which indicates a high level of inhibition of endocytosis. Furthermore, it is not toxic to normal fibroblast cells after exposure to the compound for seven days in culture. The inhibition mechanism involves incompetent binding between dynamin and GTP; dynamin probably binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a different site than the active site [225].\n7.4.8. Iminodines\nIminodines (iminochrome scaffold) are the first nanomolar-range inhibitors of DynI and DynII synthesized on the basis of compounds with the Bis-T pharmacophore. The most potent compounds, Iminodin-17, Iminodin-22, and Iminodin-23, have an IC50 of 330 \u00b1 70 nM, 450 \u00b1 50 nM, and 260 \u00b1 80 nM, respectively. Compared to the earlier class of dynole compounds, new derivatives exhibit five-fold higher activity than Dynole 34-2 or 400-fold that of Dynasore. These compounds incompetently bind the GTPase domain. Iminodyn-22 is the best, exhibiting activity as a broad-spectrum inhibitor against both DynI and DynII [226].\n7.4.9. Pthaladyns\nPthaladyns have an inhibitory effect against the GTPase dynamin and SVE (synaptic vesicle endocytosis). These substances are the first class to exhibit competitive inhibitory activity. Pthaladyn-23 was found to be competitive with GTP in cells, and Pthaladyn29, whose IC50 against dynamins was 4.58 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M, were the two most promising compounds. With an IC50 of 12.9 \u00b1 5.9 \u00b5M, only Pthaladyn-23 proved a potent inhibitor of SVE in brain synaptosomes [227].\n7.4.10. Rhodanines\nRhodanine (2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one) skeleton is widely used in medicine, and an attempt was made to use this framework to inhibit CME [228]. Rhodanine derivatives containing N-ethyl (C) and N-acetic acid (E) showed the strongest activity (Rhodadyn-C8 IC50 = 3.0\u00b1 0.9 \u00b5M, Rhodadyn-E9 IC50 = 3.4\u00b1 0.49 \u00b5M), while no inhibition of clathrin was observed at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Interestingly, not all compounds showed activity against endocytosis inhibition due to insufficient lipophilicity. N-ethyl Rhodadyn-C10 and N-allyl Rhodadyn-D10 were identified as the most potent endocytosis blockers, with IC50 values of 7.0 \u00b1 2.2 and 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b5M, respectively [229].\n7.4.11. Dynoles 2\nThe second generation of indole-based dynamin inhibitors was developed from a series of bisindolylmaleimides (BIMs). They showed a potential inhibitory activity against purified DynI GTPase, with Dynole 2-24 showing the strongest activity with an IC50 of 0.56 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5M. This compound exhibited enhanced DynII inhibition, as well as a slight improvement in DynI vs. DynII selectivity over the first-generation Dynole 34-2. Dynole 2-24 strongly inhibits CME in U2OS cells with an IC50 of 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M. In addition, it has a reduced toxicity profile despite the fact that the incorporation of straight alkyl chains can cause off-target membrane activity [230].\n7.4.12. Pyrimidines\nPyrimidine derivatives are the first dual-action inhibitors of CME, targeting both dynamin\u2019s interaction with GTP and phospholipids. Pyrimidines also showed effects on CME by examining the uptake of transferrin (Tf) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in COS7 cells. Both Pyrimidine 6 and 7 at a concentration of 30 \u00b5M caused a strong reduction in the internalization of EGF-A488 and Tf-TXR. When evaluated, the IC50 of CME inhibition\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 20 of 32\nin non-neuronal cells (by semiautomated CME assay) by the new compounds Pyrimidine 7 in COS-7 cells was 12.1 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5M, and Pyrimidine 6 was 19.6 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b5M; similar results were obtained for U2OS cells.

Dyngo\nDyngo is a development of Dynasore with the aim to eliminate the side effects of the latter, such as binding to serum proteins, detergents, and relatively high cytotoxicity. Dyngo group was obtained by condensation of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid hydrazide with various substituents. Dyngo-4a and Dyngo-6a showed excellent inhibitory activity against DynI (177 and 90 times stronger than the previous generation compound, respectively) both in the presence and in the absence of Tween-80 (T-80) (IC50 2.7 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5M and 0.38 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5M for 4a, and IC50 5.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M and 3.2 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M for Dyngo-6a, with and without T-80, respectively). In comparison, Dynasore had a much weaker inhibitory effect on DynI in the presence of surfactants (IC50 479 \u00b1 49\u00b5M vs. 12.4 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5M in the control). The number and position of hydroxyl groups in the phenyl ring determines both dynamin inhibition activity and detergent sensitivity. Compounds containing at least one -OH at the C3\u2032 or C4\u2032 position are the most sensitive, while removal of this group from C4\u2032 or inclusion at C5\u2032 reduces sensitivity to T-80. Dyngo-6a containing -OH at C2\u2032 and lacking at C4\u2032 is the most detergent-resistant and, at the same time, the most potent DynI inhibitor. The most active compound, Dyngo-4a, inhibits both CME with the IC50 of 5.7 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M and SVE at presynaptic nerve terminals. New Dyngo compounds exhibit a preference for inhibiting dynamin in a helical conformation and also bind to detergents stoichiometrically [232].\n7.4.14. Naphthaladyn Series\n1,8-naphthalamide derivatives were predicted by molecular docking experiments to target the amino-terminal G region of dynamin, which binds and hydrolyzes GTP. Naphtaladyn23 and Naphthaladyn-29 inhibit DynI activity with the IC50 of 19.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M and 18.5 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b5M, respectively. Both compounds inhibit CME with the IC50 of 115 \u00b5M and 66 \u00b5M, respectively. The lower activity of Naphthaladyn-23 may be due to its lower lipophilicity and, thus, its lower ability to pass through membranes as compared to Naphthaladyn-29 [233].\n7.4.15. Quinones\nA search in the databases of compounds against DynI activity followed by in silico optimization led to the synthesis of 54 benzoquinone/naphthoquinone-based compounds. Extensive molecular docking analysis suggested several preferential hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions with the binding site. Among these compounds, p-hydroxy and p-carboxy derivatives of aniline called 45 and 49 were the most potent inhibitors of CME with DynI inhibition IC50 of 11.1 \u00b1 3.6 and 10.6 \u00b1 1.6 mM, respectively [234].\n7.4.16. Dynazos\nDynazos, the first photosensitive inhibitor of CME, is a derivative of Dynasore with an addition of a photochromic p-azobenzene group. The presence of the azobenzene group does not inhibit the structure\u2019s activity, and Dynazo-3 and Dynazo-4 derivatives inhibit CME in a dose-dependent manner; their activity can be controlled by light [235].\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 21 of 32"

For example, Genistein inhibits the uptake by clathrin-coated pits of receptors such as EGF, which require tyrosine phosphorylation for accumulation [237,238].\n7.5.3. Phenylarsine Oxide\nPhenylarsine oxide (PAO) has an arsenic atom in connection with a phenyl group and an oxygen atom. It inhibits both clathrin pathways, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis. PAO cross-links sulfhydryl groups; therefore, it can inhibit many intracellular targets such as Rho family GTPases [173]. PAO also inhibits oxygen consumption and reduces ATP concentration in cells. The effects of PAO on labeled cargo internalization, ATP content, oxygen consumption, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) latency in isolated rat hepatocytes were determined. Treatment with 10 \u00b5mol/L PAO for 20 min blocks cargo internalization without affecting ATP concentration [239]. PAO also induces dramatic disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [204]."

            "text": "An important issue with endocytosis inhibitors is their selectivity against a pathway of interest [173]. For example, both Dynasore and Dyngo-4a exert an inhibitory effect on fluid-phase endocytosis in knock-out cells where their target, dynamin, was eliminated, indicating that this activity also represents an off-target effect. In addition, both Dynasore and Dyngo-4a have a strong blocking effect on membrane ruffling [240]. Despite inhibiting clathrin-dependent endocytosis of VEGFR2, Dynasore, Dynole, and Dyngo exert opposite effects on receptor signaling. Dynasore and Dynole have additional activity on VEGFR2 phosphorylation, unlike Dyngo. This suggests additional inhibitory effects on cell signaling beyond the inhibition of endocytosis [241]. Inhibitors of dynamin and endocytosis are also potent suppressors of mTORC1 activation independently of dynamin. Dynasore inhibits RagA by binding to Raptor, reduces mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosome, and inhibits Akt activation and TSC2-S939 phosphorylation, thus reducing mTORC1 activity [242]. Dynasore also reduces cellular cholesterol and disrupts plasma membrane lipid rafts. Due to this ability, it had a protective effect on cells by preserving them from pyolysin from Trueperella pyogenes [243]. The absence of absolute specificity does not mean that they cannot be used for research and potential clinical applications. Future research is needed to produce more selective inhibitors of endocytosis."

            "text": "As endocytosis is linked to several pathological conditions and pathogen entry into cells, it is tempting to block this process. Endocytosis inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials for various conditions and diseases. They are summarized in Table 2. Probably the most famous was the attempt to use hydroxychloroquine (NCT04437693, NCT04318444, NCT04315896, NCT04318015, NCT04308668), chlorpromazine (NCT04366739), and chloroquine phosphate (NCT04344951) during the COVID-19 epidemics. Although these attempts\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 22 of 32\ndid not produce the expected results, they demonstrated a good tolerance to these endocytosis blockers. Ruxolitinib and simvastatin have been investigated in a Phase 2 trial (NCT04348695) for their potential to block the entry process used by COVID-19, targeting clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Another Phase 2 trial (NCT04033159) focused on dynamin2 and the antisense oligonucleotide DYN101, which targets dynamin2 pre-mRNA, for the treatment of Centronuclear Myopathy. In a Phase 4 trial (NCT01064284), a chaperone molecule for procoagulant factor VIII (FVIII) was used to block endocytosis in human dendritic cells, thereby protecting FVIII from being endocytosed and subsequently presented to FVIII-specific T cells in patients with Hemophilia A. These clinical trials provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of endocytosis inhibitors for various conditions and diseases, including coronavirus infections, Centronuclear Myopathy, Hemophilia A, and pneumonia."

Inhibiting endocytosis also inhibits cargo entry into a cell, so one can protect cells from viruses or secreted/circulating proteins, including viral ones. Overcoming resistance and cellular adaptation, which can arise through alternative routes or compensatory mechanisms, is a critical challenge. In these conditions, inhibition of dynamin, which connects most pathways of endocytosis, is probably the best option. Achieving selective targeting and specificity toward desired molecular targets or pathways while minimizing off-target\nCells 2023, 12, 2312 23 of 32\neffects is crucial. A rigorous assessment of safety and toxicity is essential to minimize risks. By addressing these challenges, the clinical potential of endocytosis inhibitors can be maximized, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions. The field of endocytosis inhibitors holds great promise for the development of novel therapeutics. Addressing the emerging questions and challenges highlighted in this review will provide crucial insights into the optimal design, development, and clinical translation of these inhibitors.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.V., A.S., A.B., K.B. and R.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, O.K.S.-R., P.R., N.F. and S.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.V., A.S., A.B., K.B. and R.L.; visualization, O.K.S.-R. and P.R. supervision, Y.V., A.B., K.B. and R.L.; project administration, Y.V., A.B. and K.B.; funding acquisition, Y.V., A.B. and K.B.
