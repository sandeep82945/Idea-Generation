Few studies have examined the emotional problems and the family environment of multi-child adolescents. This study aims to explore the role of only-child status in the impact of childhood trauma and parental rearing style on depressive symptoms of adolescents in Shanghai, China.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 4,576 adolescents (M = 13.42 years, SD = 1.21) from seven middle schools in Shanghai, China. Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form, the Short Egna Minnen Betr\u00e4ffande Uppfostran, and Children\u2019s Depression Inventory were used to evaluate childhood trauma, perceived parental rearing style, and depressive symptoms of adolescents, respectively.\nResults: Results showed that girls and non-only children reported more depressive symptoms, while boys and non-only children perceived more childhood trauma and negative rearing styles. Emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and father\u2019s emotional warmth significantly predicted depressive symptoms in both only children and non-only children. Father\u2019s rejection and mother\u2019s overprotection were related to adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms in only-child families, but not non-only child families.\nDiscussion: Therefore, depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, and perceived negative rearing styles were more prevalent among adolescents in non-only child families, while negative rearing styles were especially associated with depressive symptoms in only children. These findings suggest that parents pay attention to their impacts on only children and give more emotional care to non-only children.\nKEYWORDS\nonly-child status, depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, parental rearing style, emotional abuse, rejection\n1. Introduction\nResearches in China and other countries have shown that depressive symptoms were increasing in adolescents (1\u20133).

Previous studies showed that low family support (7, 8), negative parenting styles (9), and distant parentalchild relationships (10) were associated with high levels of adolescent depressive symptoms. Parental rearing style is a constellation of stable attitudes expressed by parents through specific, goal-directed behaviors (such as parenting practices) and non-goal-directed behaviors (such as emotional expression) to communicate and interact with their children (11), which is a significant predictor of adolescent mental health problems (12). It includes three dimensions (rejection, emotional warmth, and overprotection) according to the Short Egna Minnen Betr\u00e4ffande Uppfostran which was widely used in research (13). Negative parental rearing styles like parental rejection positively predicted depressive symptoms in adolescents (14\u201316). However, parental warmth was a protective factor for adolescent depression, which predicted a lower degree of depression (17).\nMoreover, negative parental rearing styles were related to cause childhood trauma in adolescents (14). According to the literature on clinical psychology (18, 19), childhood trauma refers to a scary, dangerous, violent, or life-threatening event that happens to a child, which leads to lots of mental health problems in adolescents such as depression and anxiety. Bernstein and colleagues divided childhood trauma into five categories: emotional abuse (EA), physical abuse (PA), sexual abuse (SA), emotional neglect (EN), and physical neglect (PN) (20). All these types of childhood trauma were related to adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms (21). Notably, as emotional trauma was more subtle, imperceptible, and lasting, emotional types of traumas had the strongest associations with depressive symptoms (22, 23). Parental emotional neglect and abuse in childhood were associated with the formation of insecure attachments and emotional regulation strategies, which develop more depressive symptoms (24).\nFollowing China\u2019s relaxation of its over three-decade-long family planning policy and adoption of the universal two-child policy in 2016, the family structure has transformed from one-child families into two-child or multi-child families. The differences in family atmosphere and parenting styles have caught the attention of researchers in both types of families (25, 26). Only-child families had a more positive family atmosphere and the members expressed their emotions more directly to each other which was reflected in the fact that the intimacy between only children and their parents was higher than that of non-only children (25). In only-child families, parents tended to adopt positive parenting styles and provide more emotional care and love to their children (26). The mental health of only children was more susceptible to negative parenting styles (27, 28). In contrast, non-only children had more traumatic childhood experiences and exhibited more depressive symptoms (29). However, previous studies mostly assessed parental rearing styles in general (9, 14), but it was proved that fathers and mothers had different emotional effects on their children (12). Moreover, most studies on adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms did not take the only-child status into consideration. More researches are needed to explore the emotional problems and family factors of adolescents in multi-child families.\nTo further explore parental influences on adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms, this study investigated all five forms of childhood trauma and three dimensions of parental rearing styles in the father and mother separately. We\u00a0hypothesize that (1) non-only children exhibit more depressive symptoms than only children. (2) Emotional types of childhood trauma (emotional abuse and neglect) are greater predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents. (3) Negative parental rearing styles have greater impacts on depressive symptoms of only children than non-only children."

Participants from seven different junior high schools (grades 6\u20139) participated in the survey. The questionnaires were uniformly sent by \u201cQuestionnaire Star\u201d online (Questionnaire Star: an online questionnaire platform). School psychologists and head teachers guided adolescents to complete the questionnaires. Before the survey, adolescents were informed that all the content filled in was confidential. Parents were also informed about the nature of the survey and their consent was obtained. After completing the questionnaire, feedback on research findings was provided for the school psychologists. Additionally, researchers are committed to assisting them in implementing necessary interventions for adolescents within relevant psychology courses. The research was officially approved by the IRB of Shanghai Mental Health Center (Ethics Approval Number: 2021\u201311).\nIn total, 4,888 questionnaires were collected. After excluding the invalid questionnaires (repeatedly filled questionnaires, filling times were beyond three standard deviations of the average, and those ages exceeded the required standard of the survey), the number of remaining valid questionnaires was 4,576. After obtaining valid questionnaires, personal information including name and school was anonymized. A unique sequence number was assigned to each student, and a numerical code was generated for each school to ensure confidentiality and protect the participants\u2019 privacy. The sample was aged from 9 to 17 years (M = 13.42 years, SD = 1.21). Approximately half of them were boys (2,325, 50.81%) and half were girls (2,251, 49.19%). A total of 3,236 (70.72%) adolescents were only-child. Among all adolescents, 1,378 (30.11%) were sixth-grade students, 1,453 (31.75%) were seventh-grade students, 1,107 (24.19%) were eighth-grade students and 638 (13.94%) were ninth-grade students."

            "text": "The main finding of this research was that in Chinese adolescents, girls and non-only children reported more depressive symptoms, while boys and non-only children perceived more childhood trauma and negative rearing styles. All types of childhood trauma and parental rearing styles were related to adolescents\u2019 depressive symptoms. In particular, emotional abuse and neglect significantly predicted depressive symptoms in both only-child and non-only-child families. Father\u2019s rejection and mother\u2019s overprotection were positive predictors of depressive symptoms in only children. Father\u2019s emotional warmth\nwas the protective factor against depressive symptoms in both only children and non-only children.\nThe survey revealed that girls reported more depressive symptoms than boys, which was in line with a prior study (2). Results showed that girls reported more emotional abuse, while boys experienced more physical abuse and sexual abuse. Moreover, boys reported more fathers\u2019 rejection and overprotection. As a previous study showed, the gender of parents and children both had an impact on parental rearing styles (34). Fathers pay more attention to the cultivation of children\u2019s autonomy, while mothers provide more emotional care and warmth. For boys, parents may be\u00a0sterner, more refuse and ignore, and fathers are more willing to participate in the upbringing of boys (35). However, parents prefer to be\u00a0tolerant of girls. From the perspective of adolescents, girls are more sensitive to emotional change than boys, which may lead to emotional overreaction and increase the risk of depressive symptoms (36).\nSimilar to prior researches (37, 38), this study found that only children reported fewer depressive symptoms than non-only children. Moreover, the results showed that only children perceived more emotional warmth from parents, while non-only children perceived more childhood trauma and parents\u2019 rejection. Being the only children in the family allows he/she to receive more emotional support and attention from his/her parents, which helps he/she develop a stronger sense of confidence and consequently develop less depressive symptoms (37, 39). On the contrary, in multi-child families, parents face the challenge of allocating their limited resources such as money, time, and energy among their children, which makes it difficult to meet the different physical and emotional needs of each child. Thus, non-only children may experience more childhood trauma and negative rearing styles, especially emotional abuse (40). Parents\u2019 negative rearing styles were related to adolescents\u2019 early maladaptive schemas. Adolescents are more likely to form unsafe attachment styles and are easy to have a sense of self worthless, resulting in depressive symptoms (41).\nThe results also indicated that emotional abuse and neglect of childhood and parental rearing were significant predictors of\nTABLE\u00a02 Gender and only-child/non-only-child differences in childhood trauma, parental rearing style, and depressive symptoms.\nTotal (n = 4,576)\nOnly-child boys\n(n = 1,696)\nOnly-child girls\n(n = 1,540)\nNon-onlychild boys\n(n = 629)\nNon-onlychild girls\n(n = 711)\nF p\nEA 6.70 \u00b1 2.48 6.58 \u00b1 2.35 6.73 \u00b1 2.47 6.66 \u00b1 2.49 6.98 \u00b1 2.77 4.38 0.00**\nPA 5.54 \u00b1 1.56 5.64 \u00b1 1.70 5.36 \u00b1 1.21 5.71 \u00b1 1.80 5.56 \u00b1 1.65 11.80 0.00**\nSA 5.11 \u00b1 0.87 5.14 \u00b1 1.00 5.07 \u00b1 0.55 5.17 \u00b1 1.18 5.11 \u00b1 0.81 2.86 0.04*\nEN 8.93 \u00b1 3.66 8.78 \u00b1 3.59 8.65 \u00b1 3.58 9.48 \u00b1 3.82 9.42 \u00b1 3.74 13.27 0.00**\nPN 6.86 \u00b1 2.37 6.82 \u00b1 2.34 6.69 \u00b1 2.27 7.09 \u00b1 2.45 7.09 \u00b1 2.56 6.98 0.00**\nRejection (F) 7.99 \u00b1 2.68 8.11 \u00b1 2.71 7.75 \u00b1 2.51 8.35 \u00b1 2.92 7.94 \u00b1 2.68 9.31 0.00**\nRejection (M) 8.03 \u00b1 2.65 8.03 \u00b1 2.62 7.88 \u00b1 2.57 8.15 \u00b1 2.66 8.24 \u00b1 2.90 3.72 0.01*\nEmotional warmth (F) 22.15 \u00b1 4.90 22.50 \u00b1 4.70 22.40 \u00b1 4.82 21.48 \u00b1 5.18 21.39 \u00b1 5.14 13.95 0.00**\nEmotional warmth (M) 22.74 \u00b1 4.54 23.09 \u00b1 4.40 22.98 \u00b1 4.32 22.21 \u00b1 4.82 21.87 \u00b1 4.92 16.67 0.00**\nOverprotection (F) 15.72 \u00b1 4.05 15.91 \u00b1 3.90 15.50 \u00b1 4.17 15.82 \u00b1 4.09 15.64 \u00b1 4.08 3.03 0.03*\nOverprotection (M) 16.37 \u00b1 4.22 16.52 \u00b1 3.94 16.21 \u00b1 4.45 16.25 \u00b1 4.18 16.42 \u00b1 4.39 1.65 0.18\nDepressive symptoms 10.41 \u00b1 7.44 9.66 \u00b1 6.78 10.48 \u00b1 7.79 10.67 \u00b1 6.99 11.86 \u00b1 8.30 15.22 0.00**\nEA, emotional abuse; PA, physical abuse; SA, sexual abuse; EN, emotional neglect; PN, physical neglect; F, father; M, mother. *p < 0.05. **p < 0.01.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\ndepressive symptoms in only children and non-only children, which is following previous studies (42, 43). These findings highlight the protective role of the father\u2019s emotional warmth and the negative impacts of the father\u2019s rejection and the mother\u2019s overprotection on only-child depressive symptoms. On the one hand, the interaction between parents and only children is more frequent than with non-only children. The only child is the center of the family and intra-family relationships would revolve around him/her (26). In this case, unbalanced family function directly affected the development of the only child (39). On the other hand, only children tend to rely on their parents, while adolescents in the traditional multi-child family prefer to spend time with their siblings and peers (26). Due to the increased interaction with and dependence on parents, only children may suffer from higher depressive symptoms when they experienced negative parental rearing styles such as rejection and overprotection. In most cultures, fathers tend to be\u00a0 strict and authoritarian with their children, which could result in more rejections. This parental rejection might affect their children\u2019s depressive symptoms by lowering their self-esteem and making them more psychologically inflexible (44). Furthermore, father\u2019s rather\nthan mother\u2019s emotional warmth was a significant protective factor for depressive symptoms in both only and non-only children, which was slightly different from some previous researches that indicated both father\u2019s and mother\u2019s emotional warmth would protect children from depression (45, 46). Nevertheless, other researches highlighted that more father\u2019s emotional warmth was related to less depressive symptoms in adolescents, especially in boys (47, 48). However, in the real context of external stressors, adolescents tend to view the quality of their relationship with fathers in a more negative way than with mothers (49).\nA key strength of the present study is the comprehensive and systematic measurements of childhood trauma and parental rearing style in adolescents. They were asked to evaluate the rearing styles of their father and mother separately. Furthermore, when exploring the predictive effect of parental factors on adolescent depressive symptoms, the only-child/non-only-child family infrastructure is more important than other family factors. The results also suggest that under the multi-child policy in China, counselors and educators may have a positive impact on the mental health of adolescents by promoting fathers to express warmth and acceptance toward their children.\nThere were several limitations in this study. Firstly, this was a cross-sectional study, which means it could only observe associations or correlations between variables at a specific point in time. It could not establish any causal relationships based on these observations. Secondly, the data were collected only in Shanghai, a Chinese metropolis. The results may not be\u00a0extrapolated nationwide. Thirdly, this study did not take into account some demographic variables such as family socio-economic status. Previous studies found that lower social classes reported more overprotection and rejection (50). These factors might affect the study results and could be\u00a0further explored in the future. Fourthly, stressful life events, the birth order of children, the age of other children at birth, and the gender of other children in non-only-child families were not taken into consideration, which may also have impacts on depressive symptoms in non-only children (51) and be\u00a0worth exploring in the future."

Moreover, the father\u2019s rejection and the mother\u2019s overprotection were related to onlychild depressive symptoms. These findings call on parents to pay attention to their impacts on only children and attach great importance to non-only children\u2019s mental health, as well as to devote more emotional care and support."
