We examined whether gender could be verified from such an electrocardiogram and, if possible, how accurate it would be. Results Ten dimensional statistics were extracted from the heart rate data of more than 420,000 people, and gender identification was performed by various major identification methods. Lasso, linear regression, SVM, random forest, logistic regression, k-means, Elastic Net were compared, for Age < 50 and Age \u2265 50. The best Accuracy was 0.681927 for Random Forest for Age < 50. There are no consistent difference between Age < 50 and Age \u2265 50. Although the discrimination results based on these statistics are statistically significant, it was confirmed that they are not accurate enough to determine the gender of an individual.",

If it is possible to accurately identify gender using fluctuations in heart rate as a clue, this can be major privacy concern of the volunteering subjects those provides heart rate variability data for the medical and scientific database. However, we believe that there have not yet been reliable results on how much gender can be determined from fluctuations in heart rate. There are various studies on gender identification. Methods to discriminate male-female voices [2\u20135], facial and brain images [6, 7], discriminate from dynamic features such as gait and handwriting [8, 9], discriminate from text data such as names [10, 11], and discriminate from heartbeats sounds [11]. Those methods for gender identification based on physical characteristics have also been applied to transgender identification [12]. In this study, we confirmed how much gender can be identified using Holter ECG database."

The number of subjects was 429,308, including 861 subjects who measured ECG twice. In experiments with 71,264 samples for subjects under the age of 50, the number of subjects was 71,126, which included 138 subjects who measured ECG twice. No subject measured ECG more than two times.\nStatistical features used in the analysis. HR is the 24-h mean value of the R-R interval of continuous sinus rhythm, SDNN is the standard deviation, and rMSSD is the rms (root mean square) of the difference of R-R intervals. The changes in the R-R interval are frequency-analyzed as a sample series, and the components are extracted for each ULF (ultra-low frequency, 0 to 0.0033\u00a0Hz), VLF (very low frequency, 0.0033 to 0.04\u00a0Hz), LF (low frequency, 0.04 to 0.15\u00a0 Hz) and HF (high frequency, 0.15 to 0.4\u00a0 Hz). Furthermore, DFA1 (Detrended fluctuation analysis 1) and DFA2 (Detrended fluctuation analysis 2) are calculated by detrended fluctuation analysis. In this time, we conducted a gender identification experiment based on these statistical indicators as 10-dimensional indicators.\nEvaluation method used for comparison. In this time, we compared 4 types of classification identification methods. As classification method, we verified three types of classification methods: k-means and identification methods: random forest and SVM. Using all 428,302 data as a\nsample, test data was set to 60%, and it was obtained using the library of scikit-lab. Fourfold cross validation was performed to four different divisions, and the average was calculated. We had already confirmed this setting gives reliable result in our previous studies. K-fold cross validation is commonly used method to increase the statistical precision from given limited of dataset to be used for training and testing data. We had simply used widely used scikit-learn based API (Application Interface) to perform it. We had chosen 60% test data. This is to balance the ratio of training data and test data for our evaluation for our purpose. For number of folds, we had confirmed fourfold gives the best result for our purpose which means larger k won\u2019t give any major statistical precision. As regression analysis, Elastic net, Lasso, linear regression, and SVR (Support Vector Regression) were performed."

Regarding the estimation of gender from heart rate variability, we were able to perform an estimation experiment using more data than in previous studies [24].\nIt was not so clear whether there is a gender difference in heart rate variability data. But it is a new finding that it was confirmed that there was a certain difference and revealed reliable performance index.\nThe presence or absence of age-related differences in classification ability may be due to sex hormone effects.\nZiegler et\u00a0al. [25] discusses the normal range and reproducibility of statistical, geometric, frequency-domain, and nonlinear measurements of 24-h heart rate variability. Results show that, in healthy subjects, measurements of 24-h HRV are independent of sex and BMI, but strongly dependent on age and heart rate, and geometric parameters of HRV show high intra-individual reproducibility [25]. Voss et\u00a0 al. [26] found significant changes in indices according to gender in the frequency domain and correlation analysis, suggesting that the effects of gender and age should be considered when conducting HRV studies [26]. However, in our classification method, it was shown that it is difficult to classify gender from HRV.\nAlthough previous studies have shown that gender labels are important for heart rate variability analysis, it is the first study to demonstrate the difficulty of accurately identifying gender in a short period of time using unlabeled data. As a future work, the effects of sex hormones on the autonomic nervous system, the effects of differences in behavioral characteristics between male/ female on the autonomic nervous system, and the differences in health levels of subjects due to differences in medical examination behavior (medical examination thresholds) of gender would be beneficial if gender could be estimated."
