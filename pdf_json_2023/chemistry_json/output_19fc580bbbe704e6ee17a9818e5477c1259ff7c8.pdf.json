    "abstractText": "Excessive levels of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as peroxynitrite, promote nitrosative stress, which is an important cause of impaired sperm function. The metalloporphyrin FeTPPS is highly effective in catalyzing the decomposition of peroxynitrite, reducing its toxic effects in vivo and in vitro. FeTPPS has significant therapeutic potential in peroxynitrite-related diseases; however, its effects on human spermatozoa under nitrosative stress have not been described. This work aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of FeTPPS against peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress in human spermatozoa. For this purpose, spermatozoa from normozoospermic donors were exposed to 3-morpholinosydnonimine, a molecule that generates peroxynitrite. First, the FeTPPS-mediated peroxynitrite decomposition catalysis was analyzed. Then, its individual effect on sperm quality parameters was evaluated. Finally, the effect of FeTPPS on ATP levels, motility, mitochondrial membrane potential, thiol oxidation, viability, and DNA fragmentation was analyzed in spermatozoa under nitrosative stress conditions. The results showed that FeTPPS effectively catalyzes the decomposition of peroxynitrite without affecting sperm viability at concentrations up to 50 \u03bcmol/L. Furthermore, FeTPPS mitigates the deleterious effects of nitrosative stress on all sperm parameters analyzed. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of FeTPPS in reducing the negative impact of nitrosative stress in semen samples with high RNS levels.",

            "text": "Nitrosative stress is caused by excessive levels of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which include nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212) [1]. Peroxynitrite anion is a short-lived oxidant species formed by the spontaneous and diffusionlimited reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide anion [2]. Peroxynitrite is a particularly cytotoxic RNS, which affects several biomolecules, including tyrosine residues, thiols, DNA, and phospholipids [3]. These negative effects are mediated by reactions of oxidation and/or nitration either directly by peroxynitrite or by peroxynitrite-derived radicals [4]. Peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress contributes to the pathophysiological processes of several clinical conditions, and, accordingly, pharmacological agents that successfully prevent peroxynitrite-mediated cellular damage may have important, wide-ranging clinical applications [2].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1272. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12061272 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1272 2 of 13\nThe negative impact of peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress is also associated with male reproductive problems [5]. Peroxynitrite overproduction is observed in infertile patients [6] and negatively correlates with sperm motility [7,8], morphology [9], enzymatic activity, and intracellular calcium concentration [10]. The negative effects of peroxynitrite on human spermatozoa have recently been characterized, and this kind of cellular stress has emerged as an important cause of decreased sperm function. Excessive peroxynitrite levels cause the impairment of several sperm quality parameters, including a decrease in motility [11,12] and ATP levels by impairing both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation [13]. Mitochondrial membrane potential is also affected [12], and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) process is triggered after exposure to peroxynitrite [14]. Peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress is associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation [11], DNA oxidation and fragmentation [14], as well as post-translational protein modifications, including thiol oxidation [15] and tyrosine nitration [14]. All these cellular alterations lead to the regulated variant of cell death known as MPT-driven necrosis in human spermatozoa [14]. Thus, it is clear that nitrosative stress is detrimental to sperm quality and contributes to the etiology of male infertility, highlighting the need to develop strategies to counteract the harmful effects of this type of stress on sperm cells. Among the possible strategies for reducing peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress are the metalloporphyrin compounds. These molecules are characterized by having a porphyrin structure coordinated with a redox-active transition metal (Mn or Fe), and depending on their side chain, these compounds exhibit different properties, acting either as superoxide dismutase mimics or as peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts, allowing them to mitigate oxidative/nitrosative stress in biological systems [16]. The metallophorphyrin FeTPPS (5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinate iron (III) chloride) is a synthetic, heme-derived molecule, which is highly effective in catalyzing the conversion of peroxynitrite into less toxic subproducts, attenuating the harmful effects of peroxynitrite in vivo and in vitro [17]. Thus, the peroxynitrite scavenger FeTPPS has shown promising results and is currently being proposed as a therapeutic agent for various clinical conditions [2,18,19]. Considering the negative impact of peroxynitrite on sperm function, the possible beneficial effects of FeTPPS in preserving sperm quality under nitrosative stress conditions are clear; however, although some reports have evaluated the effect of this compound as a supplement of cryopreservation media for stallion spermatozoa [20,21], the effect of the metalloporphyrin FeTPPS on human spermatozoa subjected to nitrosative stress has not been described. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the effect of FeTPPS against peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress in human sperm cells."

Discussion FeTPPS is a metalloporphyrin that belongs to a group of compounds known as peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts, whose therapeutic potential is currently being developed to be applied to different clinical conditions [2,16,18,19,26]. Here, we demonstrate the beneficial effects of FeTPPS in antagonizing the adverse effects of peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress in sperm cells, evidenced by an improvement of ATP, motility, MMP, thiol status, viability, and DNA fragmentation. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of FeTPPS in preserving viability in different cell types, envisioning its application to different clinical conditions. When the potential therapeutic use of FeTPPS in type 2 diabetes to improve the pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction was explored, this metalloporphyrin significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity induced by human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) in a dose-dependent mode [19]. Similar to our results, FeTPPS antagonized the dissipation of MMP and cell death induced by SIN-1 in cardiomyocyte cells, via a mechanism probably related to the prevention of mitochondrial protein nitration [27]. FeTPPS significantly inhibited peroxynitrite generation, tyrosine nitration, the dissipation of MMP, and the activation of caspases 3 and 9 in response to interferon-gamma, and the reduction in cell viability was markedly rescued by FeTPPS in interferon-gamma-treated cancer cell lines of hepatoma and fibrosarcoma [28]. FeTPPS also has cardioprotective effects, evidenced by the prevention of myocardial dysfunction in an in vitro model of inflammatory heart failure [29]. In a model of sepsis, FeTPPS prevented the accumulation of peroxynitrite and heart nitrotyrosine staining and improved endotoxin-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction, which was associated with the reduced degradation of nuclear factor kappa B inhibitory protein I-kappa-B, plasma TNF-alpha levels, and microvascular endothelial cell-leukocyte activation [30]. It has been proposed that FeTPPS may be a valuable tool in counteracting the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of angiotensin II-induced hypertension, since FeTPPS abolished angiotensin II-induced tyrosine nitration and prevented the deleterious effects of angiotensin II [31]. In line with this, in a rat model of chronic neonatal pulmonary hypertension, treatment with FeTPPS (30 mg/kg/day, ip) prevented apoptosis and completely normalized right-ventricular output in animals exposed to inhaled nitric oxide [32]. In other lines of research, FeTPPS has also demonstrated a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity. Peroxynitrite synthesis is increased in insulin-resistant animals and humans\nFigure 6.

In a model of sepsis, FeTPPS prevented the accumulation of peroxynitrite and heart nitrotyrosine staining and improved endotoxin-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction, which was associated with the reduced degradation of nuclear factor kappa B inhibitory protein I-kappa-B, plasma TNF-alpha levels, and microvascular endothelial cell-leukocyte activation [30]. It has been proposed that FeTPPS may be a valuable tool in counteracting the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of angiotensin II-induced hypertension, since FeTPPS abolished angiotensin II-induced tyrosine nitration and prevented the deleterious effects of angiotensin II [31]. In line with this, in a rat model of chronic neonatal pulmonary hypertension, treatment with FeTPPS (30 mg/kg/day, ip) prevented apoptosis and completely normalized right-ventricular output in animals exposed to inhaled nitric oxide [32]. In other lines of research, FeTPPS has also demonstrated a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity. Peroxynitrite synthesis is increased in insulin-resistant animals and humans and induces the nitration of insulin signaling proteins, impairing insulin action [33]. Treatment with FeTPPS normalized the fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, attenuated the hyperglycaemic response to an intraperitoneal glucose challenge, and improved the insulininduced decrease in plasma glucose levels in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, FeTPPS restored insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated skeletal muscle in vitro [33]. Thus, the stimulation of peroxynitrite catalysis attenuates HFDinduced insulin resistance in mice by restoring insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue [33,34]. In line with the previous literature, the results presented here demonstrated that the metalloporphyrin FeTPPS effectively protects several sperm parameters from peroxynitritemediated nitrosative stress, highlighting some related to mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are essential organelles that support several processes of sperm physiology. In human spermatozoa, 50\u201375 mitochondria are helically arranged, exclusively located in the middle piece, and play a crucial role in sperm functions, including the ATP production for supporting sperm motility, and the generation of physiological levels of reactive oxygen\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1272 10 of 13\nspecies, which are required for sperm maturation, capacitation, and acrosome reaction [35]. Mitochondria also play a role in calcium signaling cascades by acting as a storage of intracellular Ca2+, as well as in the regulation of apoptosis-like phenomena [36] and other cell death modalities [14]. According to this, MMP is a sensitive parameter for assessing sperm quality since it is correlated with standard semen parameters [37] and, in some cases, is the most sensitive parameter for analyzing sperm quality [38]. MMP is also correlated with fertilizing capacity due to spermatozoa with high MMP being able to undergo acrosome reactions [39], and it may contribute to identifying the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient during assisted reproduction techniques [40]. According to this variety of functions supported by sperm mitochondria, any structural or functional dysfunction of these organelles results in the increased production of reactive oxygen species, which promotes a state of oxidative stress, associated with decreased energy production, sperm DNA damage, impaired sperm motility, and reduced male fertility [35]. Mitochondria are vulnerable to attack by free radicals, and specifically, peroxynitrite causes a decrease in mitochondrial activity in sperm cells by affecting MMP and ATP production, which is associated with a decrease in sperm motility [12,13]. The impairment of sperm motility caused by peroxynitrite can be mediated by different mechanisms, including lipid peroxidation [11] and post-translational protein modifications, including thiol oxidation and tyrosine nitration, which damage the structure or function of contractile proteins responsible for the movement [14], the dissipation of MMP [12], and the alteration of ATP production, affecting both the glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways [13]. Here, we report a protective effect of FeTPPS in preventing the negative impact of peroxynitrite in MMP, ATP production, and motility in human sperm cells. Considering the crucial role of motility, MMP, and the production of ATP in accomplishing the final goal of spermatozoa, which is to fertilize the oocyte and to transmit the paternal genome to offspring, any strategy for minimizing the impairment of these parameters would be a valuable tool to be applied to laboratory sperm handling or to assisted reproductive techniques. Additionally, FeTPPS demonstrated beneficial effects by protecting thiol groups from oxidation mediated by peroxynitrite. Thiol groups in sperm are mainly found in enzymes, antioxidant molecules, and structural proteins in the axoneme [15]. An appropriate level of thiol oxidation in proteins is necessary for sperm motility; however, the proteins involved in motility are very sensitive to oxidation [41] and overoxidation in thiol groups in mature spermatozoa, modifying progressive motility [15,42]. Peroxynitrite impairs the thiol oxidation status by reacting with thiol groups of cysteine residues, forming sulfenic acid (RSOH), which in turn reacts with another thiol group to form disulfide groups (RSSR). Thiol groups may also be oxidized by peroxynitrite-derived radicals, generating thiyl radicals (RS\u2022), and once these react with oxygen, they can increase free radical reactions, leading to oxidative stress [3]. In human sperm cells, peroxynitrite-mediated nitrosative stress increases thiol oxidation, mainly affecting the sperm axoneme, and might be another way by which peroxynitrite reduces sperm motility [15]. Thus, the beneficial effects demonstrated by FeTPPS in sperm cells under nitrosative stress conditions highlight its potential as a strategy for better preserving the sperm quality. Finally, sperm DNA was also protected from fragmentation induced by peroxynitrite. Sperm DNA is highly vulnerable to oxidative modifications, and oxidative DNA damage in sperm could have important clinical consequences for male fertilizing potential, optimal embryonic development, and the health and well-being of the offspring [43]. Thus, oxidative damage to the spermatozoa genome is an important issue and a cause of male infertility, usually associated with single- or double-strand paternal DNA breaks [44]. Due to the lack of a spermatozoa DNA repair system and the possibility that the egg is unable to correct the sperm oxidized bases, there is a risk of de novo mutation transmission to the embryo and its progeny [44]. Peroxynitrite causes DNA damage in sperm cells, including oxidation and fragmentation [14]. Considering that sperm DNA damage has an important clinical impact associated with reduced male fertility as well as with birth defects and several forms of morbidity in the offspring [45], the protection conferred by FeTPPS, which\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1272 11 of 13\nincludes the maintenance of a higher DNA integrity in conditions of nitrosative stress, could have important clinical applications aimed at protecting the sperm genome, mainly is semen samples with high RNS levels. According to this background, the application of FeTPPS to reduce the negative impact of nitrosative stress in andrology could allow for the use of this compound in the semen samples of patients affected by high levels of peroxynitrite in semen. FeTPPS could be used for the in vitro improvement of sperm quality during assisted reproductive techniques or, alternatively, as a supplement of media during sperm cryopreservation, a process that has been shown to induce an increase in reactive nitrogen species [24,46,47]."
