Among the results, we highlight a few which have led to the measurement of one small-separation binary star and of two stellar angular diameters. We conclude with a brief outlook on further possible instrumental developments and an estimate of the scientific return. In particular, we find that the LO technique can detect sources down to K\u2248 9mag with SNR=1 on the DOT telescope. Angular diameters larger than \u2248 1milliarcsecond (mas) could be measured with SNR above 10, or K\u2248 6mag. These numbers are only an indication and will depend strongly on observing conditions such as lunar phase and rate of lunar limb motion. Based on statistics alone, there are several thousands LO events observable in principle with the given telescope and instrument every year.\nKeywords: Instrumentation; detectors; methods; observational; occultations; stars: individual"

            "text": "Recently, the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) started operations as the largest facility of its kind in India (Kumar et al., 2018). It is located at 2450m elevation, longitude of 79.7 E, latitude of 29.4 N, and managed by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES; Nainital). The telescope has a 3.6-m active-control primary mirror, Ritchey-Chretien optics, an alt-azimuth mount and a corrected science field of view (FoV) of 30\u2032 at the Cassegrain focus. It is equipped with various Imager and spectrographs operating from the visual to the near-infrared (NIR) range (Baug et al., 2018; Ojha et al., 2018; Omar et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2022). The site is operated for eight months which are not affected by the monsoon rainfall, i.e., October to May, in two observational cycles. The median seeing at Devasthal is around 1.\u2032\u20321 (at ground level in optical bands), although best values can approach 0.\u2032\u20326 at the 3.6-m DOT height (Stalin et al., 2001).\nIn this paper, we focus on the instrumental requirements and scientific aspects relative to the observation of Lunar Occultation (LO) events at DOT in the NIR. The LO technique consists in recording and analyzing the diffraction pattern generated when the lunar limb moves over a background source, and it is especially attractive since it achieves angular resolution far exceeding the diffraction limit of the telescope. Given the typical angular rate of the limb, it generally requires time resolutions of few ms. A strong tradition already started in India at the 1.2-m Mount Abu telescope three decades ago (Chandrasekhar et al., 1993) with a single-pixel InSb detector and later continued with a NIR focal plane array (FPA) detector (e.g. Chandrasekhar & Baug, 2010). More recently, observations have continued at ARIES using a frame\n1Saurabh Sharma\n1\ntransfer Andor iXon EMCCD on the 1.3-m telescope also located at Devasthal (e.g. Richichi et al., 2017, 2020). This is however the first time that a considerably larger telescope is employed for fast photometric observations in India. A mention of two initial LO events recorded with the TIRCAM2 (TIFR Near Infrared Imaging Camera-II, the only instrument on 3.6m DOT which is capable in doing millisecond sampling) instrument at the 3.6-m DOT was given in Richichi et al. (2020). In the present paper we provide full details of this operational mode in Sect. 2, and present the complete commissioning results. We will briefly describe the method and the associated data analysis in Sect. 3. A total of 12 LO events have been successfully recorded at DOT using TIRCAM2 to date, of which one has led to the measurement of two binary stars and two resolved stellar diameter. We will discuss these results in Sect. 4, while in Sect. 5 we will outline how we intend to further improve the instrumental aspects in order to achieve higher temporal resolution, and the scientific strategy for this specialized mode of observation at DOT.\n1.1. 103 Tau"

            "text": "TIRCAM2 is a closed\u2013cycle cooled Imager that has been developed by the Infrared Astronomy Group at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research for observations in the NIR range (Naik et al., 2012). TIRCAM2 is sensitive between 1 and 5\u00b5m and includes both the standard NIR broad-band filters J, H, K, as well as several narrow-band filters, namely Kcont, Brackett-Gamma, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) and L-narrow. TIRCAM2 uses a 512\u00d7 512 InSb Aladdin III Quadrant focal plane array, which corresponds to 86.\u2032\u20325\u00d7 86.\u2032\u20325 FoV on 3.6m DOT with a plate scale of 0.\u2032\u2032169/pixel. It is cooled to an operating temperature of 35 K by a closed cycle Helium cryo-cooler. A schematic picture of TIRCAM2 showing its different components is presented in Fig. 1. More details on TIRCAM2 can be found in Ghosh et al. (2022) and Baug et al. (2018). TIRCAM2 is currently the only NIR imaging camera in India which can observe up to L band in the NIR. Therefore, this camera could be a good complementary instrument to observe the\nbright nbL-band sources that are saturated in the Spitzer-Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) Ch1-band ([3.6] . 7.92 mag) and the WISE W1-band ([3.4] . 8.1 mag). Sources with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 3.3 micron are also observable with TIRCAM2 (Baug et al., 2018). In our initial LO commissioning observations reported here, we have used only the broad-band K filter but any of the other available filters could be used too, depending on the trade-off between sensitivity and sky background for the given science case. The dark current measured is \u2248 12 e\u2212/s and the readout noise \u2248 30 e\u2212. The median gain of the detector is \u2248 10 e\u2212/ADU.\nDue to the elevated sky background in the NIR, typical exposure times per frame with TIRCAM2 for conventional imaging are already considerably shorter than for visual range instrumentation and of order \u2248 10 s. In fact, individual exposures of the full focal plane array (FPA) can be captured in as short as 256ms. However, this is far too slow for our LO application which requires individual exposures in the ms range. Thus, we developed a fast photometry mode, in which the data are captured in 32\u00d7 32 pixels subarray, corresponding to about 5.\u2032\u20324\u00d75.\u2032\u20324 on the sky. As the full width at half-maximum of the stellar images at the 3.6-m DOT is typically \u223c 0.\u2032\u20327 in the NIR, this is sufficient for photometry including a reasonable sampling of the surrounding sky background. The sub-array is positioned around the target by providing its x & y FPA coordinates to the TIRCAM2 software.\nThe read-out software of TIRCAM2 comprises three individual programs residing in the computer, in the PCI board DSP (Digital Signal Processor), and in the controller DSP, respectively. To achieve a faster readout, the sub-array mode required modifications in both the computer JAVA code and the controller DSP assembly code. With the current version of the software, the sampling time is \u223c10 ms for sub-array mode of TIRCAM2. After the sub-array is programmed and initialized in the controller, it captures the required frames and the data are stored in a single FITS file on the computer. In case of the capture box (32\u00d732 pixels) being at the center of FPA, after the FPA is reset, it integrates light for \u223c1.7 ms until capture box digitization is started. Digitization continues for another \u223c3.2 ms and then it continues skipping the remaining rows for another \u223c1.7 ms. The dead time between each frame is around 3.2 ms. So, the total exposure time for the capture box is \u223c4.9 ms and the total time between the consecutive frames is \u223c9.8 ms. As it takes \u223c0.007 ms to skip a row of FPA, the exposure time depends on where the star is located on FPA and can range from 3.2 ms to 6.6 ms. It is possible to reduce the integration time by placing the capture box close to the start row of the FPA. This was not done for the present commissioning work. For LO observation, we generally take 4000 frames requiring \u223c 40 s detector illumination, and about 2 min in total including overheads."

            "text": "LO represented the method of choice to achieve milli-arcsecond (mas) resolution mainly in the 1970-90\u2019s. We mention briefly that the technique consists in recording the Fresnel diffraction pattern generated when the lunar limb moves over a distant background source. The limb rate is typically \u2248 0.7m/ms, the event lasts a small fraction of a second, and detection rates of few ms are required to adequately sample the fringes. The principles of data reduction were first formulated by Nather & McCants (1970), while more details and advanced procedures can be found e.g. in Richichi et al. (1996).\nAlbeit significantly limited in the choice of targets by the orbit of the Moon and by being fixed-time events, LO offer several advantages including a very efficient use of telescope time, a fast and simple data reduction coupled with the ability to derive model-independent results, and an angular resolution which is rather independent of seeing and telescope diameter.\nRecently, more sophisticated methods like long-baseline interferometry and to some extent adaptiveoptics and speckle interferometry are now available for similar studies at selected large facilities, but they are typically more time consuming and limited by the need of suitable reference stars. LO still occupy an attractive niche and offer a favorable combination of angular resolution and sensitivity especially at relatively small telescopes where other methods are not an option.\nFollowing a large program of routine LO observations at the ESO VLT in the NIR which yielded over 1,000 recorded events about a decade ago with a corresponding large number of new angular diameters and binary stars (Richichi et al., 2014, and references therein), several observatories have now implemented\nthis technique. Examples include the Russian 6-m telescope, and several other facilities such as the 1.3-m telescope also at Devasthal, the 1.2-m and 1.8-m telescopes at Asiago in Italy, the 2.4-m Thai National telescope, the 1.2-m MAO telescope in Trebur, Germany, and the 3.5-m Telescope Nazionale Galileo (TNG) in La Palma, Spain.\nLO are essentially a 1-D technique, along the direction of the lunar limb motion. Therefore, only the combined observation from different sites offers the opportunity to obtain a 2-D view (see e.g. Richichi et al., 2017). Coordinated observations also provide the opportunity for multi-wavelength coverage. In this respect, we stress that TIRCAM2 at DOT is ideally positioned to complement similar observations from East Asia to Europe, and that it is the only facility at present offering NIR coverage.\nWe remark that while LO observations are possible at any wavelength and there are examples in the literature spanning from ultraviolet to mid-infrared, the NIR range is often considered an ideal range. This is due to the combination of various non-linear effects: the sky background (mainly scattering of the reflected solar light from the Moon), the thermal background from the lunar surface, the fringe speed decrease with wavelength (which translates to better fringe sampling for a fixed detector cycle), the spectral energy distribution of the occulted source which is often rising towards longer wavelengths for evolved stars and object with dust envelopes.\nLO data reduction is considerably less intensive than all other high angular resolution techniques both in terms of data volumes and in required computing power. It is also unique in the sense of being rather insensitive to seeing conditions and without the need for a reference star. Two different approaches are possible. Firstly, a model-dependent least-square method that includes the estimation of several parameters, including the lunar limb rate which translates to the position angle of the 1-D scan, and the angular diameter of the occulted source. It is described e.g. in Richichi et al. (1992), while Richichi et al. (1996) describe a method to put an upper limit on the diameter of unresolved sources depending on the noise in the data. With a completely different approach based on an iterative deconvolution technique, Richichi (1989) introduced a method (dubbed composite algorithm) to achieve a model-independent reconstruction of the brightness profile in the maximum-likelihood sense. Examples of the use of these methods are provided in Sect. 4."

            "text": "We report here the initial commissioning observations of the fast photometric mode of TIRCAM2 at the 3.6- m DOT. They were all carried out using a broad-band K filter centered at 2.2 \u00b5m. The list of observations is provided in Table 1, where the columns are largely self-explanatory. The predicted time is listed rounded down to the nearest minute, while El and Ill are the Moon\u2019s elevation above the horizon and the illuminated fraction. A negative or positive Ill value denotes reappearance or disappearance, respectively. The entries in the next columns are from the SIMBAD database, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio for the best possible fit using, depending on the case, models of a point-source, of a resolved stellar diameter, or of a binary star. Some comments are given under Notes, where UR stands for unresolved. We clarify that in case of good SNR, it is possible to put an upper limit on the angular size even if it remains unresolved, as is the case for SAO 77838.\nIt can be seen that a first run on October 7, 2017 did not produce usable data also given the difficulty of blind pointing due to the events being reappearances, but it allowed us to fine tune the electronics parameters and read-out process. Since the window size of 32\u00d732 pixels on 3.6-m DOT corresponds to only \u223c 5.\u2032\u20323 \u00d7 5.\u2032\u20323 on sky, the blind pointing is not advised in the case of the re-appearance events (the telescope usually have more \u223c2 arcsec rms pointing errors). What we can do is to calculate the pointing offsets from a pre-identified nearby star and apply those to the target star during the event. The same procedure was adopted while carrying our re-appearances events from the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) (Richichi et al., 2020). We also note that some of the events in Table 1 occurred with a very high lunar phase. This resulted in a higher than usual background due to proximity of sunlight reflected off the lunar surface, and more photon noise in the data as a consequence. We expect that under average conditions the SNR for similar magnitudes might be better than reported in Table 1. We emphasize that the few selected results that we discuss in the following are affected by relatively large uncertainties, as\nis to be expected given the slower than ideal time sampling, and in general by the commissioning nature of the observations. They are mainly intended to verify the feasibility of LO with TIRCAM2, and to encourage future users of this method. We are also striving to improve the SNR performance in the near future, as discussed in Sect. 5.\n4.1. IRC +10032\nOur data for IRC +10032 are shown on the left side of Fig. 2, together with a best fit by a uniform disk (UD) angular diameter of 2.22 \u00b1 0.25mas. Interestingly, the first high angular resolution measurement of this M giant was also a LO in the K-band reported by Tej & Chandrasekhar (2000), who found it unresolved with an upper limit of 2mas. Recently, Robbe-Dubois et al. (2022) accurately measured the UD diameter of IRC +10032 (HD 17973) to be 1.93 \u00b1 0.015mas in the L band. Our measurement is roughly consistent with this value.\n4.2. 103 Tau\nThe data and fit for 103 Tau are shown in Fig. 3, together with a model-independent reconstruction of the brightness profile obtained with the CAL method mention in Sect. 3. The reduced contrast of the main fringe is highly suggestive of the presence of a companion, which is clearly revealed in the modelindependent analysis, see Fig. 3. From the binary fit we find a projected separation of 16.8\u00b10.4mas along position angle PA=165\u25e6, and a brightness difference from the primary of 2.31\u00b1 0.04mag.\nThe companion to 103 Tau had already been detected from a number of investigations using speckle interferometry, e.g. among the most recent ones Horch et al. (2015), Guerrero et al. (2020), This is however the first time that it is detected in the NIR, and our flux ratio determination of 1:8.3(\u00b10.3) well agrees with the spectral classification of primary and secondary being both B dwarfs with a few sub-classes difference, see e.g. Tarasov (2016) using spectroscopic investigations."

IRC +20101\nFor this source, we find that a fit by a resolved uniform stellar diameter of 2.39 \u00b1 0.28mas is significantly better then the fit by a point-like source (SNR= 39.2 and 27.0 for the two cases, respectively). The relatively large error is mainly due to the slow time sampling, but the value is approximately consistent with the estimate of the angular diameter for this M0 giant which is 1.9mas using the empirical calibration by van Belle (1999).\nThere are no previous direct determinations of the angular diameter of IRC +20101 in the literature, and no observations by high angular resolution methods including no other LO observations.\n4.4. SAO 77838\nThe data and best fit by a point-source for SAO 77838 are shown on the right side of Fig. 2. The SNR ratio for this data set is one of the highest obtained during commissioning, and we have used the method\nreferenced in Sect. 3 to put an upper limit on the angular size of SAO 77838 of 1.45 \u00b1 0.65mas. This can be satisfactorily compared with an empirical estimate of 1.1mas for the angular diameter of this K7 giant, located at \u2248 138 pc, using the calibration by van Belle (1999). It reinforces the validity of using TIRCAM2 and the LO method to measure angular diameters in the mas range.\nAs was the case for IRC +20101, also for SAO 77838 there are no previous LO observations reported and no relevant literature entries with direct measurements."

            "text": "Using those data from Table 1 for which a fit could be made, we plot in Fig. 4 the SNR as a function of the K magnitude. The scatter is significant, as expected given that LO events occur under a large range of sky background (strongly dependent in turn on the illumination fraction and the distance to the terminator) and other parameters. Nevertheless, a trend is clearly visible already in these preliminary commissioning data, with SAO 98770 being an outlier in virtue of the sampling and integration time being 4 times longer than for the rest. We can thus conclude that under the standard sub-array configuration (32 \u00d7 32 pixels at \u223c 10ms) the fast photometry mode of TIRCAM2 can be sensitive to about K=9mag, to detect the occultation of a single unresolved sources, i.e. with SNR\u2248 1. As a rough guideline, the detection of 1:1 binary would require a SNR' 3, while angular diameter determination would require a SNR' 10, or K/ 6mag.\nThis opens the possibility of using LO to investigate angular diameters and binaries with targets available essentially any night that the Moon is up and the phase 2 days away from full Moon. To put this in context, we have used the 2MASS catalog truncated to the limit K\u2264 8.5mag to compute occultations for the whole year of 2023 visible from the Devasthal site. Within acceptable limits of lunar phase and elevation, a total of 18460 LO events would be observable in principle over the year, of which 8766 disappearances. As each LO event takes less than an half hour of telescope time (including overheads, initial settings etc), this program is ideal to fill the gaps in the telescope schedule and to utilize the less demanded bright moon period. However, due to non availability of an automated observational sequencer at the telescope, this program demands availability of dedicated and trained manpower at the site. In order to efficiently conduct this LO program from the telescope, development of both the observing sequencer and data reduction pipeline is required.\nThe current main limitation is the sampling time, which at 10ms is 2 or 3 times longer than optimal\nfor LO events (see e.g. Richichi et al., 1996). We have been considering solutions, at both the software and the hardware level. A software approach with the current FPA controller may be limited due to the limitations of the current TIRCAM2 hardware. A more promising approach would be the installation of a new faster commercial controller, or the in-house design of a new one. These possibilities are currently under exploration."

The minimum full frame read-out time is 256ms. Having in mind the requirements for LO observations, we have developed a fast photometry mode which makes use of a 32\u00d732 sub-array with read-out time just under 10ms.\nThis mode has been commissioned by observing 18 LO events, of which 12 were successful in recording the characteristic diffraction patterns. Among them, we could measure two stellar angular diameters and two binary stars. The rest of the data were consistent with unresolved point sources. The sensitivity is established to be close to K\u223c 9mag. This in turn translates to several thousands of LO events observable in principle from the Devasthal site each year.\nThe observation procedures and the data flow, resulting in 3-D standard FITS cubes, have been thoroughly tested and the mode is now publicly offered to interested users. Improvements are being considered to bring the sampling time down to very few milliseconds."
