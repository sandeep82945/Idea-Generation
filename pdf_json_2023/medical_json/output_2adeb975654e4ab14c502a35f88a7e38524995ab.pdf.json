            "text": "Infectious diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of childhood death worldwide, and death rates are especially high in low- and middle-income countries.1 On average, diarrhea kills 2,195 children every day\u2014more than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined.2 Out of the 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrheal disease that occur globally, approximately 500,000 cases result in death.3 Furthermore, diarrhea also has a detrimental impact on growth and cognitive development due to the disruption of both intestinal absorptive and barrier functions. These problems bestow great urgency to the development of new and improved approaches to combat enteric infections.4 The complement system comprises more than 50 secreted proteins and membrane receptors that function in a highly coordinated fashion to form one of the first lines of innate immune defense against invasion of host tissues by microbes. Complement is classically considered a chiefly hepatocyte-derived and serum-resident system, acting in the blood and interstitial fluids.5 Complement can be activated through the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways, which converge at complement component 3 (C3), the central element of the complement cascade. Deposition of a fragment of C3 (C3b) on the surface of bacterial cells is essential for direct lysis of many gram-negative bacteria by driving formation of the membraneattack complex (MAC) or by promoting phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils and macrophages.6 Surprisingly little is known about the function, if any, of the complement system on the apical side of epithelial barriers (e.g., in mucosal secretions of the respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts), where some of the earliest encounters with potentially invading bacterial pathogens take place. During the COVID-19 pandemic, studies found that the complement system is one of the most highly induced pathways in lung epithelial cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection.7 Complement cascade genes are also enriched among differentially upregulated genes in rectal biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) relative to healthy controls.8 However, the scale and function of the complement system in the gastrointestinal tract is unclear, despite the gut representing the primary reservoir of host-associated microbes. The gut microbiota (the community of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and viruses that inhabit the intestine) plays a critical role in many aspects of human health and may modulate susceptibility to a wide spectrum of diseases such as IBD, obesity, diabetes, neurologic disease, malnutrition, and diarrheal infections.8\u201312 However, the role of the intestinal microbiota in modulating complement activity in the gut mucosa is poorly understood. In this study, we show that complement C3 is synthesized in the gut by three key types of cells and secreted into the intestinal lumen, and that the luminal C3 level is determined by the composition of the host\u2019s gut microbiota both in humans and mice.

We identified stromal cells as the primary source of gut complement C3 during homeostasis, and that these cellular populations potently upregulated C3 expression during infection. This microbiota-dependent complement C3 production in the gut underpins a relationship between specific gut microbes and the pathogenesis of infectious diarrhea in children and adults. Further understanding of these interactions may provide crucial insight into the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diarrhea, one of the most significant and serious health problems in children.\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "To investigate the role of the commensal gut microbiota in host complement production, we measured C3 in feces and serum of age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice by ELISA (Figure 1A). We found that SPF mice have significantly higher levels of intestinal C3 than GF animals (Figure 1B) while the C3 levels in the serum of GF mice were comparable to that of SPF control mice (Figure 1C). This result suggested that there are microbiota-dependent C3 differences in the gut lumen, and these differences were not due to systemic changes in serum complement levels. Gut C3 production and/or secretion are different in GF and SPF mice perhaps because of a process occurring within the intestinal mucosa. To further test whether the production of C3 in the lumen could be triggered by exposure to microbes post-weaning or is programmed during early development, we colonized 4-weekold GF mice with SPF microbiota (Figure 1A). Two weeks after introducing an SPF mouse fecal slurry into GF mice (generating GFSPF mice), there were comparable levels of C3 in fecal specimens from the GFSPF mice as in fecal samples of SPF animals. We examined whether removing members of the gut microbiota reduced fecal C3 levels to those observed in GF mice. After two weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment in the drinking water, antibiotic-treated SPF mice (SPFABX) had no detectable live bacteria in their feces by culturing, and fecal C3 levels were like those of GF mice (Figure 1B). We investigated whether luminal C3 levels were affected by the composition of the microbiota or simply reflected a generic response to colonization with any microbe. We measured C3 levels in WT 8-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice from three commercial breeders: Jackson Laboratory (JAX), Taconic (Tac), and Charles River (CR). We found that inbred animals of the same strain from each vendor harbored a distinct microbiota (Figure 1D, E; Figure S1A-C) and had significantly different concentrations of fecal C3 (Figure 1F). We then transplanted the gut microbiota from each of these three mouse vendors into GF mice and observed that colonization and C3 levels recapitulated donor signatures (Figure 1G). Oral gavage of FITC-dextran in CR mice showed similar barrier permeability compared to JAX mice (Figure S1D). Blind histology check scored both JAX and CR mice at zero with no histologic sign of disease (Figure S1E). These data suggest that the composition of the microbiota regulates levels of gut C3 production and secretion. We subsequently investigated if our findings were germane to humans. We measured fecal C3 levels from a cohort of healthy human donors without chronic gut inflammation12 and found substantial individual variation in C3 levels in these fecal samples (range of 33\u2013710 ng/g of feces) (Figure 1H, I). We transplanted the fecal microbial communities from either a high C3-\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Importantly, gnotobiotic mice colonized with donor 1 fecal slurry had low fecal C3 levels while mice colonized with donor 8 microbiota had high fecal C3 levels (Figure 1J). These findings suggest that microbiota from different humans can induce different levels of fecal C3 in the mouse gut and that specific microbes are a factor modulating C3 levels in the gut.\nPrevotella spp. are one of the drivers of high-C3 production in the gut To identify which specific bacterial species contribute to the induction of high C3 levels in SPF animals, we examined the C57BL/6 mouse microbiota of JAX and CR as representative of low-C3 and high-C3 communities, respectively. We co-housed 4-week-old JAX and CR mice for 2 weeks and found that the co-housed JAX mice had increased fecal C3 levels to that of CR mice, while the co-housed CR mice retained their original baseline C3 production (Figure 2A). 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples showed that co-housed JAX mice acquired a microbiota very similar to the CR microbiota (Figure 2B, Figure S2A-D), which suggested the presence of CRspecific strains that could induce high C3 production. To identify possible candidate strains, we employed a method we previously established known as \u201ctriangulation of microbe-phenotype relationships.\u201d13 In brief, we co-housed different groups of 4-week-old JAX and CR mice for one or three days to allow for microbiota transfer between mice from these two vendors. Two weeks after separation of the co-housed animals, we measured fecal C3 levels. We found that co-housing JAX mice with CR mice for either one or three days resulted in C3 levels similar to those seen in mice gavaged with CR feces (Figure 2C). To determine microbiota composition following cohousing, fecal samples were collected from these mice and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall, co-housing JAX and CR mice for one day resulted in CR-like signatures in\nrecipient JAX mice (JAXcoh_1d) both in terms of the presence of bacterial taxa (a-diversity) as well\nas the relative abundance of taxa (b-diversity) (Figure 2B and Figure S2A-D). Differential abundance analysis of the microbiota composition of JAX and JAXcoh_1d mice identified Prevotella spp., Rikenellaceae spp. and Lactobacillus salivarius as significantly more abundant in the microbiota of JAXcoh_1d compared with JAX mice (Figure 2D, E, S2E, F, Table S1). This suggested that these bacteria could be associated with high fecal C3 levels and be potential high-C3 inducers. To identify commensal strains that could also correlate with C3 production in humans, we compared C3 levels of individual human fecal samples with commensal taxa identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Due to the extensive individual variation of bacterial species, we performed a genus-level analysis. We found that the genus Prevotella also positively correlated with fecal C3 levels across the cohort (Spearman r=0.5487, p-value=0.029), while the genus\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Given the positive correlation between the abundance of genus Prevotella and high fecal C3 levels in both humans and mice, we sought to further examine its role in C3 production. We first isolated a Prevotella spp. (strain CR1) from CR mouse feces using selective growth conditions14 and colonized (by gavage) 4-week-old SPF JAX mice with CR1 (Figure 2F). We used Proteus mirabilis (strain CR2) isolated from CR mice as a control because it was only present in the CR microbiota; the presence of CR2 showed no significant positive correlation with C3 induction in our analysis. We found that in contrast to mice colonized with P. mirabilis CR2, JAX mice colonized with Prevotella strain CR1 showed a significant increase of fecal C3 production compared to untreated SPF JAX control mice (Figure 2G). Nevertheless, colonization with Prevotella CR1 did not entirely recapitulate the effect of a CR-microbiota gavage, suggesting that there are additional bacterial strains in CR mice which could induce high C3 production (Figure 2G). These data are consistent with our finding that multiple bacterial strains were identified as significantly positively associated with high fecal C3 levels in JAXcoh_1d mice (Figure 2D). Together, these data demonstrate that Prevotella strain CR1 from the CR microbiota can induce high levels of luminal C3 production in a complex microbiota environment.\nStromal cells are the major intestinal cell population transcribing complement protein C3 during homeostasis Although complement proteins in serum are primarily produced and secreted by the liver15\u201317, recent studies have also shown extrahepatic C3 production by various immune and nonimmune cell types.18\u201321 While intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have been suggested to produce C3 under experimental and inflammatory conditions22\u201324, the cellular source(s) for intestinal C3 at homeostasis remain unclear. To identify which intestinal cell types express C3 under homeostasis, we used single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) to perform a transcriptional survey of C3 expression across intestinal populations. We used a C3-tdTomato reporter mouse line (C3IRES-tdTomato C57BL/6)25 to isolate all colonic C3-expressing cells. Flow-cytometry analysis on colonic cells from the reporter mice found the subepithelial compartment, which includes both the lamina propria and the muscularis of the colon, as the dominant source of C3-expressing cells, compared to the epithelium (Figure 3A, Figure S3A). Therefore, we focused on the subepithelial compartment for our scRNASeq analysis. We isolated C3-expressing cells (tdTomato-positive) from the subepithelial compartment of both male and female C3IRES-tdTomato C57BL/6 mice and performed scRNASeq on these cells (Figure 3B). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis revealed three major cell populations clustered by gene expression profile (Figure 3C).

We then confirmed our observations by flow cytometric analysis of C3-expressing cells (tdTomato positive) from the subepithelial compartment of C3IRES-tdTomato mice (Figure S3B). We confirmed that stromal cells (EpCAM-CD45-CD31-PDPN+ cells) formed the major C3-transcribing population in the subepithelial compartment under homeostatic conditions, representing 80% of the C3-expressing population. As expected from the scRNASeq data, CD45+ cells (~15%) and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (~5%) were the populations with the second and third highest C3 expression, respectively (Figure S3C). To validate our reporter mouse results, we examined the indigenous C3 transcriptional levels of these three colonic cell populations using WT C57BL/6 mice. We used fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate stromal (EpCAM-CD45-CD31-PDPN+ cells), CD45+, and IEC (EpCAM+) populations from the subepithelial compartment of the colon of WT C57BL/6 mice (Figure 3E). Using bulk RNA-seq analysis, we found C3 transcriptional levels in stromal cells were significantly higher than in IECs and CD45+ cells (Figure 3F). These results were consistent with our scRNASeq and flow-cytometry findings using C3IRES-tdTomato reporter mice. Taken together, these data suggested that under homeostasis, intestinal C3 is largely expressed by stromal cells located in the subepithelial compartment of the intestine. To identify human intestinal cellular sources for C3, we analyzed scRNASeq data from the Human Gut Cell Survey26, which included 79,929 intestinal cells from five anatomical sites in healthy adult human donors. B-, T-, endothelial, epithelial, mesenchymal, myeloid, neuronal, and plasma cells were identified based on their unique gene expression profiles. After retrieving the expression profile of C3 from the 79,929 intestinal cells in healthy adult human donors, we identified mesenchymal cells as the highest C3-transcribing population. Dot plot of C3 expression across cell types showed that mesenchymal cells have the largest percentage of cells expressing C3, as well as the highest average expression levels (Figure 3G). Our observations in mice are consistent with the findings using human datasets. Complement system gene expression profile in the intestine during homeostasis Since complement proteins in serum usually function together in groups acting in sequence, we analyzed the intestinal transcriptional expression of complement proteins other than C3 in both mice and humans. We evaluated several major complement components at the\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Based on normalized read counts for respective genes within each population, we defined transcript expression levels as low (<10/million reads), medium (10-100/million reads), or high (>100/million reads) (Figure 3F). The analysis showed that the classical-pathway component C1q (including C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc) is highly expressed in CD45+ cells, consistent with a recent report that macrophages form the predominant source of C1q in the murine intestine.27 Interestingly, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway proteins showed very low expression levels in all three populations with the exception of Masp1 (mannose-associated serine protease 1), which was expressed at a medium level in stromal cells. The alternative pathway component Cfp was highly transcriptionally expressed in CD45+ cells and expressed at low levels in epithelial and stromal cells. C2 and C4a exhibited very low transcriptional expression in all three cell types, while C4b was highly expressed in stromal cells and moderately expressed in CD45+ cells. The genes for proteins downstream of C3, including complement membrane attack complex (MAC) components C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9, showed very low or undetectable levels of transcriptional expression (Figure 3F). Overall, this analysis suggested that in the murine colon, C1q, Cfp and C4b are the only other major complement components (other than C3) with high transcriptional expression in a homeostatic environment. Similarly to murine intestinal cells, human intestinal samples analyzed by scRNASeq also possessed high expression of classical-pathway components C1qa, C1qb, and C1qc in the CD45+ myeloid compartment. Human MBL pathway expression also remained equivalent to that of mice. Interestingly, alternative pathway components Cfd and Cfh were highly expressed in mesenchymal cells, and Cfp and Cfd were highly expressed in myeloid cells. While MAC member C7 was detected in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, none of the other MAC components (e.g., C5, C6, C8 or C9) were observed at detectable levels (Figure 3G). Based on these results, we conclude that mice and humans share similar expression of C3 and other main components of the gut complement system.\nC3-expressing stromal cells are primarily located in colonic lymphoid follicles and produce C3 upon bacterial stimulation To locate C3-expressing cells in the colon, we performed RNAscope analysis using C3specific anti-sense probes on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from the colon of WT C57BL/6 mice and found that the majority of C3-expressing cells were located in the isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) (Figure 4A). ILFs are tertiary lymphoid organs which consist of collections of B-, T-, myeloid, and stromal cells, and their development has been suggested to be linked to microbial exposure.28 Morphologically, the majority of C3-expressing cells in ILFs are stromal cells. We confirmed this using immunofluorescent antibodies against tdTomato\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Our staining showed co-localization of C3 and PDPN transcripts (Figure 4B) and confirmed that stromal cells in ILFs are the major cell population expressing C3. To further test if stromal cells can produce and secrete C3 protein, we isolated colonic stromal cells from C3IRES-tdTomato C57BL/6 mice by FACS and measured C3 gene expression and protein levels before and after bacterial stimulation (Figure 4C). For this, we formalin-fixed bacterial cells obtained from the feces of CR mice and used these to stimulate cultured primary stromal cells. We found increased tdTomato signal (indicating C3 transcript expression) upon bacterial exposure compared to unstimulated controls (Figure 4D). We also observed higher C3 protein levels in the extracellular medium of stromal cells 24 hours after bacterial stimulation (Figure 4E). The expression levels of tdTomato significantly correlated with protein levels of C3 in the medium (Figure 4H), confirming that this reporter system was a robust measure of C3 protein production. To further dissect the ability of bacterial strains in stimulating C3 production, we picked four representative bacterial strains: two gram-negative species, Bacteroides fragilis 9343 and Prevotella isolate CR1, the latter we reported above to increase C3 production in vivo, and two gram-positive species, Enterococcus faecalis TX0104 and Enterococcus faecium TX1330. We cultured them individually in their respective culture media, and then formalin-fixed them separately to stimulate stromal cell C3 production. We found both of the gram-negative bacterial strains upregulated C3 expression (Figure 4F) and C3 protein production (Figure 4G), while the grampositive bacterial strains failed to upregulate either C3 transcript expression (Figure 4F) or protein production (Figure 4G). To identify specific bacterial molecules participating in the induction of C3 in stromal cells, we examined expression levels of several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in colonic C3expressing cells using our scRNASeq data (Figure S4D). We found that intestinal C3-expressing stromal cells express Tlr4, but almost no-detectable levels of Nod2 (Figure 4I, J). Therefore, we chose two microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) to test their ability to induce C3 expression in stromal cells: lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known TLR4 ligand from gram-negative bacteria, and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a known NOD2 ligand from gram-positive bacteria. As expected, LPS upregulated the transcription and secretion of C3 in primary colonic stromal cells while MDP did not (Figure 4F, G). To identify innate cellular signaling pathways used by colonic stromal cells to detect LPS and trigger C3 production, we isolated stromal cells from TLR4-/-, MyD88-/-, and WT BL6 mice by FACS. Compared to WT control cells, LPS stimulation induced\nless C3 in both TLR4- and MyD88-knockout stromal cells indicating that the TLR4-MyD88 pathway is critical for LPS sensing and triggering of C3 production in intestinal stromal cells (Figure 4K).\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

This pathogen is the mouse counterpart to model human pathogen enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).29 We orally infected weaning-age C3-deficient mice and used age-matched WT mice as controls. C3-deficient mice were more sensitive to C. rodentium infection, with only a 50% survival rate, while all WT mice survived the pathogen challenge (p<0.05, Figure 5A). Adult C3-deficient adult mice also showed significantly more symptoms such as weight loss than WT mice (Figure 5B). Symptom onset occurred one week after infection and peaked five days later. We found significantly higher levels of C. rodentium shed in the feces of C3-deficient mice compared to WT mice at day eleven post-infection (Figure 5C). Since C. rodentium is known for the formation of \u2018attaching and effacing\u2019 (A/E) lesions in the colonic epithelium during infection, we examined the location of C. rodentium using specific rRNA FISH probes seven days after infection. There were significantly higher numbers of C. rodentium invasion in the epithelium of C3-deficient mice (Figure 5D) compared to WT mice (Figure 5E, 5F, p<0.005). To determine whether mucosal C3 was deposited on bacterial cells during infection, we infected mice with C. rodentium LB1, a strain which constitutively expresses GFP,30 and performed flow-cytometric analysis on bacterial cells in fecal samples from infected WT and C3deficient mice. Immunostaining of GFP+ C. rodentium cells with fluorescent anti-C3 antibody showed that the microbes were coated with C3 at day seven post-infection (Figure 5G). To rule out whether the classical or lectin pathways are required for this phenotype, we infected C1qaand MBL-deficient mice with GFP+ C. rodentium, we found similar levels of fecal C3 and C3coated GFP+ C. rodentium cells (Figure S5A-C), suggesting that the deposition of C3 does not rely on the classical or lectin pathway. This was consistent with the report that C1q is not essential for protection against C. rodentium infection.27 To confirm the role of luminal C3, as opposed to serum C3, in C. rodentium infection, we treated SPF mice with cobra venom factor (CVF) to specifically deplete plasma-circulating C3 without depleting gut luminal C3 (Figure S5D, E). Subsequently, mice were challenged with C. rodentium and monitored for symptoms. We found CVF treatment did not compromise the resistance to C. rodentium infection displayed by WT mice. There was no significant difference in weight loss (Figure 5B) or bacterial burden in CVF treated compared to non-CVF treated WT controls (Figure 5C). These results indicate that mucosal complement C3 is sufficient to confer resistance to this enteric pathogen independently of C3 production at non-mucosal sites.\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We colonized GF mice with JAX or CR microbiota resulting in GFJAX with low luminal C3 level or GFCR with high luminal C3 level, respectively (Figure 5H). When mice were challenged with a high dose of C. rodentium (2X1010 CFU/mouse), we found that GFJAX mice lost significantly more weight during the infection compared GFCR mice (Figure 5I). GFJAX mice also shed significantly higher numbers of C. rodentium in their feces compared to GFCR mice on the 11th day after infection (Figure 5J). These results demonstrated that the level of luminal C3 driven by the unique compositions of the host gut microbiota modulated the degree of susceptibility to enteric infection by C. rodentium. Our results with the murine enteric pathogen C. rodentium suggest that mucosal C3 can opsonize select enteric pathogens during enteric infections and that this can occur independently of the classical or lectin pathways. Variations in luminal C3 levels due to the host commensal microbiota can impact the host\u2019s susceptibility to enteric pathogen infection. Luminal C3 production increases significantly during enteric infection We reasoned that if luminal C3 levels play a major role in controlling enteric infections, C. rodentium infection may lead to up-regulation of mucosal C3 at the transcriptional and protein levels. To test this hypothesis, C3IRES-tdTomato reporter mice were infected with C. rodentium; transcriptional levels of C3 were measured by flow cytometry and fecal C3 protein levels were measured by ELISA (Figure 6A). We found that fecal C3 protein levels increased significantly during infection (Figure 6B), which correlated with C3 gene transcriptional expression as measured by the total tdTomato signal in cells from the colonic subepithelial compartment (Figure 6C). Gating on tdTomato-positive cells and following select genetic markers for various cell types, we found that stromal cells, CD45+ cells, and IECs are also major sources of C3 production during infection (Figure S6A, B). Compared to uninfected controls, mice infected with C. rodentium had an increased proportion of stromal cells transcriptionally expressing C3 in the total colonic stromal cell population (30% versus 12%), which coincided with the early phase of infection as C. rodentium begins to attach to enterocytes.31 The percentage of stromal cells transcribing C3 was maintained at ~30% throughout the infection. CD45+ cells transcribing C3 increased from 5% to ~30% of total CD45+ cells by day five post-infection and reached a level of ~40% by day eight. This level of expression was maintained in CD45+ cells through day 14. IECs transcribing C3 increased from ~0.5% to 5% of total IECs by day five and reached a level of ~10% by day eight which continued to rise to ~15% through day 14 (Figure 6D). In terms of cell numbers, due to the large number of total IECs in the colon, IEC hyperplasia, and the infiltration of CD45+ cells into the gut during infection, the composition of the C3-transcribing population changed from predominantly\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We next performed bulk RNA-Seq on sorted IECs, CD45+, and stromal cells from uninfected and infected C57BL/6 mice to confirm our ELISA and reporter assay results (Figure 6F). We found significant increases in C3 gene expression in all three populations at day seven and fourteen post-infection (Figure 6G), suggesting all contributed to C3 transcriptional expression. Nonetheless, stromal cells still showed the highest C3 mRNA expression levels during infection when compared to other host cell populations (Figure 6G), consistent with the results in reporter mice. We also looked for increased transcript expression of other complement system proteins using bulk RNA-Seq and compared infected and non-infected controls of the same three cell populations in WT C57BL/6 mice. We found that in addition to C3, both Cfb and C4b are significantly upregulated in stromal and CD45+ cells. However, the majority of genes encoding MAC components (C5-C9) were not expressed at detectable levels by RNA-Seq in any of the three sorted populations (Figure 6H), which is consistent with low C5 protein levels in WT fecal specimens from day eleven post-infection (Figure S6C). Pendse et al. reported that gut transit time was unaltered in C3-deficient mice27, which suggested that the differences between WT and C3-deficient mice were not due to changes in intestinal motility. C3-dependent neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is critical for protection against C. rodentium infection We reported above (Figure 5C) that C3-deficient mice had significantly greater organism loads during infection than C3-sufficient mice. Thus, we wanted to determine the major mechanisms used by the gut immune system to limit organism load. Since components of the MAC (C5-C9) are not upregulated or secreted by C3-producing cells in the colon during infection, we examined the role of opsonophagocytosis in controlling C. rodentium infection. Flow cytometric analysis of intestinal cells isolated from C3IRES-tdTomato reporter mice showed a population within CD45+ cells that incrementally upregulated C3 expression throughout the course of infection (Figure 7A). While in a homeostatic environment only ~4% of C3-expressing CD45+ cells express high C3 levels, this population rose to ~50% 14 days post-infection (Figure 7B). Further analysis of this high-C3-expressing population revealed they were myeloid cells (CD11b+), with the majority being neutrophils, followed by macrophages and monocytes (Figure 7C, Figure S7A, B). We then analyzed C3 expression dynamics in these three myeloid populations during infection. While only a subset of macrophages and monocytes expressed C3 (Figure S7C-E), neutrophils uniformly expressed high levels of C3 (Figure 7D, E).

We found that neutrophils were robustly recruited to the colonic lamina propria and epithelial layer during infection (Figure 7F, G) where they became the major source of high-C3-expressing CD45+ cells (Figure 7C, Figure S7B). The dominant presence and activity of neutrophils is consistent with the concept that phagocytosis of microbes is imperative for C3-dependent bacterial clearance. To explore the hypothesis that mucosal C3 was acting as an opsonin to enhance bacterial phagocytosis, we measured the magnitude of bacterial uptake by neutrophils in the mucosal environment. WT mice were infected with GFP+ C. rodentium, and neutrophils from the mucosal epithelial and lamina propria layers were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry seven days after infection. We found a significant fraction of GFP+ neutrophils in both layers (Figure 7H, I),\nsuggesting that neutrophils had phagocytosed GFP+ C. rodentium within the host mucosal environment. Finally, we wanted to determine whether gut complement was important to the clearance of other enteric pathogens. Therefore, we tested the human pathogen EHEC in a murine environment. We infected 6-week-old C3-deficient or WT C57BL/6 mice with GFP+ EHEC strain EDL931 via the oral gastric route. We found that adult C3-deficient mice were highly susceptible to EHEC infection, showing only a 16% survival rate. In contrast, WT mice were substantially more resistant to EHEC infection with only one out of eleven mice succumbing to the infection (Figure S7G). We collected fecal samples from WT and C3-deficicent mice at four days postinfection and performed flow cytometric analysis using an anti-C3 antibody to assess C3 opsonization of EHEC. C3 was detected on fecal GFP+ EHEC EDL931, demonstrating that EHEC\ncan also be significantly opsonized by C3 in the lumen of WT mice (Figure S7H)."

            "text": "The complement cascade is an evolutionarily conserved part of our immune system. For decades, complement has been considered primarily a hepatocyte-derived and serum-effective system responsible for defending against the invasion of microbes into host tissues. However, initial host-pathogen interactions often occur at the apical side of epithelial barriers, and the role of complement in these surfaces has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we found that local colonic cell populations can sense gut commensal microbes and produce a substantial quantity of complement C3 in the gut lumen during homeostasis. The level of luminal C3 is regulated by the composition of the microbiota, which confers individualized luminal C3 levels. Furthermore, luminal C3 increases significantly during enteric infection with the murine pathogen C. rodentium, where C3 is required for protection against this and EHEC strain EDL931,\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Even though pathogenic E. coli infections are a major worldwide cause of diarrheal disease, especially in children, the mechanisms for host defense are not well understood. C. rodentium is considered a murine A/E pathogen and serves as a mouse model for EPEC and EHEC infections, while EHEC also produce Shiga-like toxins.32 Our study expands our understanding of the role of the microbiota in shaping variability in host infection susceptibility and severity and reinforces the important concept that the microbiota can indirectly influence a host\u2019s response to infection by priming immune defense mechanisms before a pathogen is encountered. Diet is a major factor that shapes the composition of the gut microbiota. In low- and middle-income countries, malnutrition and undernutrition are major public health concerns.33 Malnourished children exhibit delayed maturation of the microbiome and have greater susceptibility to enteric pathogens.34,35 Malnutrition and enteric disease susceptibility may be both a cause and a consequence of each other. Pathogenic E. coli (including EHEC and EPEC) are thought to be the most common enteric pathogens found to be associated with diarrheal disease in low- and middle-income countries. Our findings may directly relate disease susceptibility and severity to alterations in the microbiota resulting from undernutrition. Fecal C3 was previously connected to non-infectious diseases. Local gut complement C3 deposition was observed on the surface of the colonic epithelium in biopsies or resection specimens from IBD patients.36 However, due to inflammation in IBD patients and increased vascular permeability causing unpredictable extravasation of serum proteins, it could not be determined whether C3 was synthesized locally in the gut or secreted into the lumen during homeostasis. Here, we provide direct evidence that C3 can be locally transcribed by three different cell populations in the steady-state using C3-reporter mice, scRNASeq, flow cytometry, and validation by ultra-low input RNA-Seq on sorted cell populations. We found that C3 protein exists in the lumen of healthy mice and humans and is regulated by the gut microbiota. There was a local increase in C3 transcription levels in stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cells and an increase in C3 protein levels in the lumen during enteropathogenic infection. Together, these data revealed the dynamic local complement C3 response in the gut. The finding that stromal cells, (fibroblasts in particular) are the major source of C3 in both mice and humans during homeostasis is an unexpected finding. Traditionally, fibroblasts are non-hematopoietic (CD45-), non-epithelial (Epcam-), and non-endothelial (CD31-) structural cells that provide essential connective tissue (stroma).37 They define the architecture of the tissue microenvironment by depositing and remodeling extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Recent studies have uncovered important functions for these cells in initiating, supporting, or suppressing innate and adaptive immune responses in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues.38 One such example is the role of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

C3-expressing fibroblasts are primarily located in colonic LFs, which are comprised of B-, T-, myeloid, and supporting cells including fibroblasts. We have demonstrated that these fibroblasts can directly sense bacterial signals in vitro and respond to these cues by producing C3. Our study on intestinal C3 opens a new avenue of research for local complement systems beyond synthesis in the liver and activity in blood. We explored transcriptional profiles of central components of the complement system using scRNASeq and ultra-low input RNA-Seq on sorted cell populations, as well as C3 and C5 protein levels during homeostasis and infection. Two dominant cell types were involved in gut complement production: stromal cells were the dominant source of intestinal C3, while myeloid cells were the dominant source of gut C1q. These findings were validated by scRNASeq data from healthy human gut tissues.26 The difference in cellular sources for C1q and C3 is notable as the complement cascade is currently viewed as an integrated, interdependent system. In our study, we found gut luminal C3 recognizes and binds to pathogens and is required for phagocyte-mediated killing of these microbes; this is consistent with the classical understanding of complement. Other research groups have explored the effects of local complement systems in assessments relevant to our study. C1q is not required for immune defense in the intestine but rather plays a critical role in regulating gut motility by interacting with the enteric nervous system.27 Additional studies also show that the complement system plays an important role in the ocular mucosa. During infection with ocular pathogens such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), C3d is deposited intracellularly in the corneal epithelium of vaccinated animals to confer protection, which is absent in C3-deficient mice and associated with a delay in viral clearance in vaccinated C3-deficient animals.44 Together, our study and others\u2019 show complement system components may play different roles locally than they do systemically. While the functions of these components will need to be further clarified, our study raises questions about the role of complement components in other mucosal surfaces of the body including the respiratory and urinary tracts.\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Data were then analyzed using the Seurat R toolkit (https://satijalab.org/seurat/). Briefly, cells were first filtered based on the UMI count and mitochondrial gene percentage. Cells with < 500 UMIs or > 10 % mitochondrial genes were excluded from further analysis. Gene expression values for each cell were then normalized by the total expression, multiplied by an arbitrary scale factor of 10,000, and log- transformed. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 200 most variable genes that were expressed in > 1% of the cells. The number of statistically significant PCs was determined by comparison with PCA over a randomized matrix as described previously48. The data were then visualized using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction algorithm49 based on the significant PCs. Clustering was done on selected PCs using the FindNeighbors followed by the FindClusters functions, and the identity of the main clusters was determined based on the expression of common identifiers: Stromal (pdpn), epithelial (Epcam), myeloid (lyz2).\nGene expression profiling by population RNAseq A thousand live epithelial (EpCAM+), CD45+,and stromal cells (EpCAM-CD45-CD31-PDPN+) were doubly sorted from colons of WT SPF mice by BD FACS Aria II. Sorted cells were directly lysed with 5mL of TCL buffer (Qiagen, 1031576) containing 1% 2-mercaptoenthanol (Sigma-\nAldrich, M6250), then flash frozen using dry-ice and stored at -80\u00b0C. Smart-Seq2 libraries for lowinput RNA-seq were prepared by the Broad Technology Labs and were subsequently sequenced through the Broad Genomics Platform according to the Immgen protocol (https://www.immgen.org/img/Protocols/ImmGenULI_RNAseq_methods.pdf). The GCT and CLS files generated and used for downstream analysis. After normalization and filtered low count reads by DESeq2, fragments/counts per million were calculated for all the genes in the complement systems. Histogram and heatmaps with main components in complement system were depicted in Figure 3F, 6 G and H. Analysis of published single-cell data For the dotplot gene expression profiles of complement system genes in human colonic cells, a full scRNASeq dataset of 428,000 intestinal cells26 was downloaded from https://www.gutcellatlas.org/, and then filtered as to keep cells with more than 500 genes, less than 25% mitochondrial reads, and genes with expression in more than three cells. A Scrublet (v.0.2.1) score cut-off of 0.25 was applied to exclude doublet.

Adult (8-12 weeks) WT and C3-/- C57BL/6 mice were used to evaluate the roles of complement C3 in infection using C. rodentium doses between 5X108-1X1010 CFU as indicated. Animal survival, weight, and disease symptoms were monitored daily for 3 weeks. Fecal burden represented by CFU/g of feces were monitored from day 7 to day 14. For C3 deposition analysis, age matched WT and C3-/- mice were oral infected with 5X108 CFU of GFP+ C. rodentium LB1. At day 7, fecal\npellets were collected and resuspended in PBS containing a Roche proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Cat. No. 04693159001). Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 50X g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in order to pellet large particulate material. The supernatant fluids were filtered through a 40\u03bcm filter and the flow-through was then centrifuged to collect the bacterial cell pellet. Fecal bacteria were then 'washed' by resuspending the pellet in PBS, centrifuging, and resuspending with a proteinase inhibitor twice. The washed bacteria cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% BSA and incubated for 30 minutes at 4oC before adding 1/10 volume of rabbit anti-mouse C3 antibody (sc-20137). After incubating the bacterial cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour, cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS containing 1:10,000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG-647 antibody (Invitrogen).

Two, 30-nt eubacterial FISH probes were designed by extending the standard Eub388 probe sequence to a total length of 30-nt, and concatenating different 20-nt \u2018readout\u2019 sequences. One Eub388 FISH probe carries a 5\u2019 acrydite moiety, which served to anchor all eubacterial 16S rRNA during the tissue clearing process. As the sequence of the eubacterial probes do not overlap that of the C. rodentium-specific probe, we anticipated C. rodentium would be labeled by both. Bacterial imaging and data analysis To prepare the sample for imaging, the sample was stained with two fluorescently-labeled readout probes complementary to the readout sequences on each of the C. rodentium-specific and Eub338 probes, as well as DAPI. The samples were imaged using buffers and protocols described previously51. Briefly, the samples were imaged on a home-built epi-fluorescence microscope\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Illumination was reflected to the sample via a penta-band dichroic (Semrock FF421/491/567/659/776-Di01-25x36) and emitted light filtered with a penta-notch filter (Semrock FF01-391/477/549/639/741-25; FF01-441/511/593/684/817-25). Samples were imaged with a \u00d760 CFI PlanApo oil objective (Nikon) and two high-performance CMOS cameras (Hamamatsu, Flash 4.0). The mosaic for the cross-section colon slides was generated by stitching single field-of-views together. The epithelial boundaries were identified based on the 405-channel using Fiji. The C. rodentium signals were measured inside the epithelial boundaries by thresholding the C. rodentium-specific channel on intensity and summing the number of pixels above the threshold in Fiji. As different cross-sections had different sizes, the measured C. rodentium signals were normalized by the measured length of the epithelial-lumen boundary in each slice."
