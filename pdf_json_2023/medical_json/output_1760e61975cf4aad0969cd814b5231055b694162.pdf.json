The documentation reads as follows:\n\u2022 CC: New spot on left cheek that seems to be growing and changing shape rapidly.\n\u2022 History: No family history of skin cancer; concerned about scarring, no blood thinner.\n\u2022 Examination: Irregular tan to brown to black 8-mm macule. No lymphadenopathy.\n\u2022 Impression: rule out melanoma. \u2022 Plan: Consent, biopsy via shave technique. Lidocaine hydrochloride 1% with epinephrine, 1 cc, prepare and drape, hemostasis obtained, ointment and bandage applied, and care instructions provided.\nAs was the case before 2021, you still need a CC, along with a medically (and medicolegally) appropriate history and physical examination. A diagnostic impression and treatment plan also should be included.\nIn this situation, reporting is straightforward. There is no separate E/M visit; only the CPT code 11102 for tangential biopsy is reported. An International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code of D48.5 (neoplasm of uncertain behavior of skin) will be included.\nWhy no E/M code? This is because the biopsy includes preservice and postservice time and work that would be double reported with the E/M. Remember that the preservice work would include any history and physical examination related to the area to be biopsied.\nSpecifically, preservice work includes:\nInspect and palpate lesion to assess surface size, subcutaneous depth and extension, and whether fixed to underlying structures. Select the most representative and appropriate site to obtain specimen. Examine draining lymph node basins. Discuss need for skin biopsy and biopsy technique options. Describe the tangential biopsy procedure method and expected result and the potential for inconclusive pathology result. Review procedural risks, including bleeding, pain, edema, infection, delayed healing, scarring, and hyper- or hypopigmentation.5\nPostservice work includes:\nInstruct patient and family on postoperative wound care and dressing changes, as well as problems such as bleeding or pain and restrictions on activities, and follow-up care. Provide prescriptions for pain and antibiotics as necessary. Advise patient and family when results will be available and how they will be communicated. The pathology request form is filled out and signed by the physician. Complete medical record and communicate procedure/results to referring physician as appropriate.5\nThe Takeaway\u2014Procedure codes include preservice and postservice work. If additional work for the procedure is not documented beyond that, an E/M cannot be included in the encounter.\nScenario 2: What If We Don\u2019t Biopsy? A 34-year-old presents with a new spot on the left cheek that seems to be growing and changing shape rapidly. You examine the patient and discuss treatment options. The documentation reads as follows:\n\u2022 CC: New spot on left cheek that seems to be growing and changing shape rapidly.\n\u2022 History: No family history of skin cancer; concerned about scarring, no blood thinner.\n\u2022 Examination: Irregular tan to brown to black 8-mm macule. No lymphadenopathy.\n\u2022 Impression: rule out melanoma. \u2022 Plan: Review risk, benefits, and alternative options. Schedule biopsy. Discuss unique risk factor of sebaceous peau d\u2019orange skin more prone to contour defects after biopsy.\nWhen determining the coding level for this scenario by MDM, 3 components must be considered: number and complexity of problems addressed at the encounter (column 1), amount and/or complexity of data to be reviewed and analyzed (column 2), and risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality of patient management (column 3).1 There are no data that are reviewed, so the auditor will assume minimal data to be reviewed and/or analyzed (level 2, row 2 in the MDM table). However, there may be a lot of variation in how an auditor would address the number and complexity of problems (level 1). Consider that you must explicitly state what you are thinking, as an auditor may not know melanoma is a life-threatening diagnosis. From the perspective of the auditor, could this be a:\n\u2022 Self-limited or minor problem (level 2, or minimal problem in the MDM table)?1\n\u2022 Stable chronic illness (level 3, or low-level problem)?1\n\u2022 Undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis (level 4, or moderate level problem)?1\n\u2022 Acute illness with systemic symptoms (level 4, or moderate level problem)?1\n\u2022 Acute or chronic illness or injury that poses a threat to life or bodily function (level 5, or high-level problem)?1\n\u2022 All of the above? Similarly, there may be variation in how the risk (column 3) would be interpreted in this scenario. The treatment gives no guidance, so the auditor may assume this has a minimal risk of morbidity (level 2) or possibly a low risk of morbidity from additional diagnostic testing or treatment (level 3), as opposed to a moderate risk of morbidity (level 4).1\nThe Takeaway\u2014In the auditor\u2019s mind, this could be a straightforward (CPT codes 99202/99212) or lowlevel (99203/99213) visit as opposed to a moderate-level (99204/99214) visit.

That is not their job. So, let us clarify by explicitly stating what you are thinking in the context of the MDM grid."

            "text": "Below are modifications to the documentation for scenario 2 to guide an auditor:\n\u2022 CC: New spot on left cheek that seems to be growing and changing shape rapidly.\n\u2022 History: No family history of skin cancer; concerned about scarring, no blood thinner.\n\u2022 Examination: Irregular tan to brown to black 8-mm macule. No lymphadenopathy.\n\u2022 Impression: rule out melanoma (undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis).\n\u2022 Plan: Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives, including biopsy (decision regarding minor surgery with identified patient or procedure risk factors) vs a noninvasive gene expression profiling melanoma rule-out test. Patient prefers the latter.\nIn this scenario, the level of MDM is much more clearly documented (as bolded above).\nThe number and complexity of problems would be an undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis, which would be moderate complexity (column 1, level 4).1 There are no data that are reviewed or analyzed, which would be straightforward (column 2, level 2). For risk, the discussion of the biopsy as part of the diagnostic choices should include discussion of possible scarring, bleeding, pain, and infection, which would be considered best described as a decision regarding minor surgery with identified patient or procedure risk factors, which would make this of moderate complexity (column 3, level 4).1\nImportantly, even if the procedure is not chosen as the final treatment plan, the discussion regarding the surgery, including the risks, benefits, and alternatives, can still count toward this category in the MDM table. Therefore, in this scenario with the updated and clarified documentation, this would be reported as CPT code 99204 for a new patient, while an established patient would be 99214.\nScenario 1 Revisited: A Funny-Looking New Spot Below is scenario 1 with enhanced documentation, now applied to our procedure-only visit.\n\u2022 CC: New spot on left cheek that seems to be growing and changing shape rapidly.\n\u2022 History: No family history of skin cancer; concerned about scarring, no blood thinner.\n\u2022 Examination: Irregular tan to brown to black 8-mm macule.

Patient wants biopsy. Consent, biopsy via shave technique. Lidocaine hydrochloride 1% with epinephrine, 1 cc, prepare and drape, hemostasis obtained, ointment and bandage applied, and care instructions provided.\nThis documentation would only allow reporting the biopsy as in Scenario 1, as the decision to perform a 0- or 10-day global procedure is bundled with the procedure if performed on the same date of service."
