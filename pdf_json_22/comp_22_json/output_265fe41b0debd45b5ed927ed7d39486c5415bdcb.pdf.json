    "abstractText": "In recent years, the worldwide temperature increase has resulted in rapid deglaciation and a higher risk of glacier-related natural hazards such as flooding and debris flow. Due to the severity of these hazards, continuous observation and detailed analysis of glacier fluctuations are crucial. Many such analyses require an accurately delineated glacier boundary. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of glaciers, particularly debris-covered glaciers (DCGs), poses a challenge for glacier mapping when using conventional remote sensing or machine-learning techniques. Some examples exist about small-scale automated glacier mapping, but large or regional-scale mapping is challenging. Previously, a deep-learning-based approach named GlacierNet2 had been developed to accurately delineate the complete DCG outlines on the regional scope via taking advantage of multiple models. This paper uses a modified version of GlacierNet2 to study the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale glacier mapping in Nepal Himalaya, Karakoram, and parts of western Himalaya. Also, we propose a large-scale mapping strategy to progressively enhance the network familiarity to varied types of glaciers via systematically repeating the training process. This strategy allows the network to delineate a large number of glaciers while only requiring a small proportion of initial training data. Thus, resulting in a significant drop in labor and expert intervention, which are required for selecting and labeling the training data. Our results show a successful and accurate generation of glacier boundaries with an intersection over union (IOU) score of 0.8115 in the Karakoram and parts of western Himalaya and an IOU of 0.7525 in the Nepal Himalaya. Our work outlines how future efforts of large and global scale mapping can be developed to monitor and analyze glacier dynamics.

INTRODUCTION In recent decades, mountain glaciers have been significantly impacted by climate change [1]\u2013[3]. The responses of different glaciers, even when located nearby, can vary because of the heterogeneous and complex glacier systems and topographic regimes as well as local climates [4]\u2013[12]. The High Mountain Asia region contains the largest number of glaciers outside the polar region and is generally called\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Weimin Huang .\nthe third pole [13], [14]. These glaciers originate and sustain the upper reaches of several great river systems in Asia [1], such as the Yellow, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus. Rapid deglaciation in the region increases the potential risk of glacier-related hazards (e.g., debris flow and glacial lake outburst flood), threatening the security of the mountainous and downstream community [15], [16]. Therefore, continuous mapping at different time scales and using them to analyze glacier fluctuations are critical.\nPrevious mapping efforts include many regional or global glacier boundary inventories, such as Global Land Ice\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 72615\nMeasurements fromSpace (GLIMS, https://www.glims.org/), Glacier Area Mapping for Discharge from the Asian Mountains [17], World Glacier Monitoring Service (https://wgms.ch/), and Randolph Glacier Inventory [18]. These boundaries are mainly generated using manual onscreen digitization or the semi-automatic technique that requires manual post-processing. As valuable as these inventories are, there are some obvious challenges. For example, 1) they need to be reviewed and updated timely; 2) require experts to digitize and annotate complex glacier facies (e.g., debris, ice, water, snow), which is timeconsuming, tedious, and error-prone. Errors are primarily due to a subjective approach to identifying different classes and levels of difference in analysts\u2019 expertise in identifying such objects. Glacier delineation via semi-automated or automated algorithms (e.g., pixel-, object-, and statisticalbased) utilizing the satellite imagery, digital elevation model (DEM), and land surface parameter (i.e., geomorphometric parameters) [19]\u2013[27] requires familiarity with high data properties (surface features), understanding limitations of parametric settings defining glacier characteristics and empirically fine-tuning algorithm. Thus, these approaches are challenging to be universally employed for regional or large-scale glacier mapping because of their high spatial and morphological complexity.\nConsequently, the more recommendable solution of regional glacier mapping is to utilize the machinelearning [28]\u2013[32] and deep-learning algorithms [33]\u2013[37]. The generally implemented machine-learning algorithms for glacier mapping involve support vector machines, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Among these algorithms, the RF classifier has shown comparatively superior performance in evaluating machinelearning algorithms for glacier mapping [30]. The major difference/superiority of the machine-learning algorithm over the aforementioned conventional approaches is the parameter training strategy [34]. The machine-learning algorithm automatically, iteratively, and objectively updates the randomly initialized parameters via learning the training data. Hence, without requiring users\u2019 deep understanding and analysis of the utilized data, the machine-learningbased approaches can handle multiple characteristic data (e.g., indices, textural feature data, and geomorphometric parameters) extracted from the satellite images and DEM.\nThe deep-learning algorithm that has been effectively utilized for glacier mapping is the convolutional neural network (CNN) [38]\u2013[42], which is a type of ANNs designed for visual imagery processing, such as classification [38]\u2013[40], object detection [43]\u2013[45], and segmentation [46]\u2013[50]. Also, CNN-based remote sensing data analysis was applied to many applications, such as landcover classification [51], estimating sea ice concentration [52], [53], and wetland classification [54]. CNN optimizes the fully-connection strategy in classical ANN to the locally connected one that shares the neural parameters, thus lowering the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, the CNN superimposes\nthe reception field of convolutional kernels to establish the \u2018\u2018communication bridge\u2019\u2019 for the distant data pixels [34]. Thus, CNN differs from the machine-learning classifiers, possesses capabilities for processing the larger amount of data and extracting data features, and therefore is recommended for regional and large-scale glacier mapping.\nCurrently, a few CNN-based approaches have been developed and implemented for the glacier mapping, 1) the CNN segmentation model with automatic postprocessing [33]\u2013[36]; and 2) the RF classifier with CNN as the feature extractor [36], [37]. The representation of the first type of approach is the GlacierNet [33], which contains a segmentation model that has the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder extracts outstanding features (e.g., debris-free ice, debris-cover ice, etc.) from the input data and therefore also reduces the data size, whereas the decoder restores the data size and assigns each input data pixel to a specific category. The second type of approach differs primarily because the final classification function is provided by the RF classifier [36], [37], and plays the role of the last neural network layer of the original CNN model.\nMultiple CNN models have been applied and evaluated for glacier mapping [34], containing the GlacierNet [33], R2UNet [55], FCDenseNet [56], [57], Res-UNet [41], [46], Mobile-UNet [46], [58], and DeepLabV3+ [59]. According to our previous evaluation [34], the DeepLabV3+ and GlacierNet provide relatively superior performance and, therefore, were modified and utilized to construct the second generation of GlacierNet approach \u2013 GlacierNet2 [60]. The GlacierNet2 is a hybrid multi-model learning approach that incorporates CNNs, machine-learning classifier, basinlevel hydrological flow estimation, possessing the ability to regionally map the complete glacier, including ablation and accumulation zones.\nOne of the difficulties of large-scale glacier mapping using a CNN classification is the training data labeling (i.e., annotation). CNN memorizes the feature of the training data via updating its parameters that can be learned and thereby compares the similarity of new data (those that CNN has not learned) features to the memorized ones to achieve classification. Therefore, ideally, the training samples should contain large spatio-temporal glacier variability and glaciers mapped by different experts. The performance of CNN is highly dependent on the quantity of training data; generally, the larger the amount of data used for the training better the performance becomes. The GlacierNet2 was used to map the central Karakoram glaciers with \u223c15% area as training data. Even though GlacierNet2 only requires a small percentage of data for training, the training sample amount, selection, and annotation are still challenging issues that need to be addressed for large-scale glacier mapping. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of large-scale glacier mapping via the deeplearning-based approach. Specifically, we 1) developed an effective large-scale mapping strategy; 2) adjusted the GlacierNet2 approach to fit more land surface features;\n72616 VOLUME 10, 2022\n3) trained the adjusted GlacierNet2 approach using the new mapping strategy, and 4) evaluated the performance of the adjusted GlacierNet2 approach to map the glaciers in study areas.\nWe assessed our objective in two primary areas (Figure 1) that includes 1) most of the Karakoram (KK) and part of the Western Himalaya (WH), referred to here as the Karakoram and Western Himalaya (KWH), and 2) Eastern Himalayan glaciers in Nepal and some from Tibet of China referred to here as Nepal and China Himalaya (NCH).\nII. METHODOLOGY A. DATA Since GlacierNet2 is the primary algorithm used in this study, the data input channels are the same 1) all eleven Landsat 8 bands, 2) advanced land observing satellite DEM, and 3) five geomorphometric parameters, including the slope angle, tangential curvature, profile curvature, unsphericity curvature, and slope-azimuth divergence index. The majority of selected Landsat 8 satellite data were the cloud-free end of the ablation period scenes acquired between 2014-2020 (Table 1). Notably, satellite data acquired in\nSeptember/October time period is the most relevant data for glacier mapping since most of the seasonal snow has melted out by that time. However, large-scale glaciermapping\nVOLUME 10, 2022 72617\nrequires multiple scenes, which do not always exist for this time period because of the cloud cover and other data acquisition challenges. Therefore, we also utilized the scene collected around this time. The training data label was created using the modified Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) boundaries to produce the pixel-wise annotations. For details, see Ref. [34] and Ref. [60]. Notably, the input raster data were uniformly resampled (using nearest-neighbor interpolation) to the 30-meter resolution instead of the 15-meter resolution used in Ref. [34] and Ref. [60] to reduce the computing quantity in large-scale glacier mapping.\nB. GLACIERNET2 AND MODIFICATIONS The GlacierNet2 approach was constructed by four ordered modules, including data subsampling, CNN processing, terminus estimation improvement, and snow-covered accumulation zone (SCAZ) estimation (Figure 2). The GlacierNet2 outputs two types of estimations: 1) the one only covering the glacier ablation zone, and 2) the one containing both the ablation zone and SCAZ of the glacier (i.e., the entire glacier).\nThe data subsampling module was to divide the original large-size satellite image using a sliding window to the sub-image sets (Figure 2a), thus meeting the input\nrequirement of the CNN model. The CNN processing module (Figure 2b) modified and utilized two CNN models comprising GlacierNet and DeepLabV3+. This module fused these two networks\u2019 feature maps and produced the classification results considering both networks\u2019 decisions. Also, the original GlacierNet output was kept as the reference for the subsequent processes. Therefore, two types of CNN results, both in the form of binary images for representing the glacier (i.e., positive category) and non-glacier (i.e., negative category or background) pixels, were outputted from the CNN processing modules. In the terminus estimation improvement module (Figure 2c), these two binary image sets were separately assembled to two large binary images covering the original satellite image. This module then orderly and parallelly applied the region size thresholding, hole removing, and water removing to the two large binary images. The water pixel removing process had been developed and employed in the GlacierNet since one of the study areas of GlacierNet was the Nepal Himalayan glacier region containing many proglacial lakes that occasionally get misclassified. However, this process exclusively utilizes the water index and cannot thoroughly consider the various types of glacier lakes appearing in a large-scale mapping. Consequently, the improved water removing process is designed and then added to the GlacierNet2 approach tomake it more universally applicable. The improved water removing algorithm is executed as follows: Step A. The surface reflectance water index of Landsat 8 is\ncomputed to identify the water pixels:\nWater index = Band6SWIR \u2212 Band3Green Band6SWIR + Band3Green , (1)\nStep B. Based on the computed water index, the Otsu method [61] is applied to preliminarily identify the water pixels, including the proglacial lakes and the other water bodies (e.g., supraglacial lakes). Step C. All the internal holes of each independent water region are filled. Step D. The glacier lake is classified based on the following glacier lake conditions (GLCs): GLC 1: low regional standard deviation based on\nwater index pixels. GLC 2: high temperature (according to band 10 of Landsat8). GLC 3: located around the terminus (detect the\nterminus region based on the DEM since the terminus is the lowest altitude zone of a glacier). This is primarily referring to proglacial lakes.\nGLC 4: does not fully surround by glacier pixels, which reduces the chance of eliminating supraglacial lakes. The water region is classified as a proglacial lake if it meets the requirement of (GLC1\u222a (GLC2\u2229GLC3)) \u2229 GLC4. Then, the proglacial lakes are removed.\n72618 VOLUME 10, 2022\nStep E. If anywater pixel has been removed from a terminus, the image closing operation is applied to smooth its edge.\nThe GLC 1 is designed by considering the smooth surface property of the glacier lake. The smooth surface, in the digital image, behaves as the low fluctuation frequency and amplitude of intensity and therefore has a low regional standard deviation of intensity. However, icebergs in proglacial lakes can have larger intensity differences; thus, the regional standard deviation is computed based on the water index that enhances the intensity of water pixels against the others. The GLC 2 and 3 that consider the high temperature and location information are incorporated to more comprehensively find the proglacial lake pixels. The GLC 4, the last condition, is to exclude the internal water region misidentified as the glacier lake by previous GLCs.\nLater, based on the two large binary images handled via the above processes, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and vegetation zone removing (VZR) processes were executed to improve the terminus estimation. After that, the snow identification process (i.e., finding the potential unassigned SCAZ), in the final module (Figure 2d), firstly classified the snowy regions based on the water index and then filtered out the snow regions that were not adjacent to the ablation zone. However, the snow identification in the large-scale glacier mapping needs to account for the effects of shadow and glacier lake. Therefore, five snow identification conditions (SICs) utilized in the improved snow identification strategy are: SIC 1: the pixel has a high-intensity value of water index. SIC 2: the pixel has a median intensity value of the water index. SIC 3: the pixel has a low temperature based on band 10 of Landsat8. SIC 4: the pixel\u2019s region directly touches the ablation zone. SIC 5: the pixel\u2019s region does not touch any terminus.\nThe pixel is classified to belong to a snowy region if it meets the requirement of (SIC1 \u222a (SIC2 \u2229 SIC3)) \u2229 (SIC4 \u2229 SIC5). The SIC 1 preliminarily identifies the snow pixels based on the water index. SIC 2 and 3 consider the lower reflectance and temperature properties to recognize the snowy region under the shadow. SIC 4 filters out the isolated snowy regions unconnected with any ablation zone estimations produced by previous modules. Finally, the SIC 5 rules out glacier lakes misclassified as the snowy region in SIC 1-3.\nNext, the drainage basin estimation process utilized the TopoToolbox [62] and considered the object relevance (confirming the object\u2019s category via accounting for its location and relationship to its neighbor) to assign the SCAZ segments to each ablation zone, hence producing the complete glacier estimation.\nC. LARGE-SCALE MAPPING STRATEGY Accounting for CNN and glaciers\u2019 properties, and the difficulty of large-scale mapping, we developed a progressively\nlearning strategy inspired by semi-supervised learning that involves a low proportion of annotated samples and a high proportion of unannotated ones [63]. Since GlacierNet2\u2019s CNN processing module that focuses on the ablation estimation must be trained, this strategy is only used to map the ablation zone in this study. Starting from a small training region, the GlacierNet2 is repeatedly and systematically retrained utilizing the selected testing outputs from itself after the previous training process. Specifically, the large-scale mapping strategy step includes (Figure 3): Step A. Select and annotate a small proportion of data as the initial training data. Step B. GlacierNet2 is trained by the initial training data. Step C. The trained GlacierNet2 is applied to the entire\nor partial study areas. However, due to the high spatial complexity and heterogeneity of glaciers, some glaciers are not familiar to the network after initial training, particularly those that are far away from the training region. Hence, the preliminary testing outputs are generally shown as three cases: Case 1: Highly accurate glacier estimation with only minor errors. Case 2: Low-accuracy glacier estimation with large\nerrors, especially in the glacier terminus region.\nCase 3: Unperceived glacier (totally misclassified as non-glacier).\nStep D. Here, cases 1 and 3 are not processed by any operation. Covering polygons are manually drawn to case 2 to approximately cover the larger suspected misclassification area (including glacier pixel clusters classified as non-glacier and non-glacier pixel clusters recognized as glacier) to avoid the network learning the larger suspected misclassification area during retraining. Step E. Case 1 and 2 are expanded according to the set pixel length (e.g., 15 pixels length) to cover the neighboring zone pixels (e.g., glacier vs. no glacier) and then are clipped and pasted to an empty background (zero value). Step F. The values within the covering polygons created in step D are also set to zero. Step G. Fill the empty background by the environment background segments in the same satellite scene. The segments can be collected near the glacier region but do not cover any glacier. Also, offset values are added to the DEM layer of the filled background, thereby equaling the average altitude of the filled background to that of clipped glacier segments. This created pseudo data is then added to the training dataset. The original case 1 and 2 glacier estimations (without expansion) are used as labels of the pseudo data. Step H. GlacierNet2 is retrained using the training dataset.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 72619\nStep I. The additional training data creation and network retraining processes are repeated until the glaciers in the study area are accurately mapped.\nIn this strategy, even though case 1 is already accurately estimated by GlacierNet2, learning these samples is still exceptionally significant. The retraining can enhance the networks\u2019 familiarity with these types of glaciers, thereby expanding the network\u2019s familiarity with spatially variable glaciers. Although case 2 can be corrected before being used, the corrections are labor-consuming and need expert intervention and subjective calls to identify specific pixels. Therefore, the suspected large misclassifications of case 2 are uncorrected and unlearned by GlacierNet2 in retraining, leaving to be re-speculated via the retrained GlacierNet2. Steps E to G is to avoid case 3 being learned as background. Also, step E keeps these backgrounds pixels (i.e., negative cases) that are around the glaciers (i.e., positive cases) samples since the essence of binary classification is the comparison between positive and negative cases.\nD. EVALUATION METHOD We select 10 glaciers (Table 2) for each study area to evaluate the performance of glacier mapping using the GlacierNet2 approach under the large-scalemapping strategy. The selected glaciers include different types of glaciers that are widely distributed throughout the study area and are outside the initialized training region. Also, the majority of these selected glaciers are far away from the initial training\nregion. The evaluation references are generated from the slightly modified GLIMS glacier outlines. The evaluation indexes used in this study include the intersection over union (IOU), recall (RC), precision (PC), specificity (SP),\n72620 VOLUME 10, 2022\nF-measure (FM), Kappa (KP), and accuracy (ACC) [33], [34]:\nIOU = TP\nTP+ FP+ FN , (2)\nRC = TP\nTP+ FN , (3)\nSP = TN\nTN + FP , (4)\nPC = TP\nTP+ FP , (5)\nFM = 2\u00d7 PC \u00d7 RC PC + RC , (6)\nKP = TP+ TN \u2212 TPexpected \u2212 TNexpected\nTP+TN+FN+FP\u2212TPexpected \u2212 TNexpected\nTPexpected = (TP+ FP)\u00d7 (TP+ FN ) TP+ TN + FN + FP , (7) TNexpected = (TN + FN )\u00d7 (TN + FP) TP+ TN + FN + FP\nACC = TP+ TN\nTP+ TN + FN + FP , (8)\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The GlacierNet2 is initially trained in the Karakoram and Western Himalaya (KWH) region (three times of repeating the training process including the initial training and retraining) and later transferred to the Nepal and China Himalaya (NCH) region (two times of repeating the training process including the initial training and retraining). It is clear from the glacier mapping samples that the GlacierNet2 accurately delineated boundaries of the mountain ridge, accumulation zone, lateral moraine and ablation zone, and termini (Figure 4a-d). Also, the problems brought by glacier lake (Figure 4c1) and snowy region under cast shadows (Figure 4b1) were respectively addressed via introducing several glacier lake conditions (GLCs) and snow identification conditions (SICs) to GlacierNet2. Themajor issue contributing to the lower evaluation scores is the differences in snow-covered accumulation zone (SCAZ) estimations between GlacierNet2 and reference (Table 3). Some differences are caused by the inconsistency of the SCAZs since the reference boundaries were produced utilizing satellite imagery acquired at different times in comparison to the satellite imagery used in this study. Moreover, as discussed in our previous study Ref. [60], the differences can also be caused by the nearby non-snow areas merging and small non-snow regions removing processes in the SCAZ estimation module.\nA. THE LARGE-SCALE MAPPING STRATEGY EFFECTIVENESS The proposed large-scale mapping strategy exclusively demands a small amount of data for initial training, thereby lowering labor-intensive expert verification and training data annotations for large-scale glacier mapping. Although the ablation zone estimations still contain some errors, they were improved via retraining in the proposed strategy (Figures 5 and 6).\nIdeally, as aforementioned, more types of glacier samples, including varied elevations, aspects, surface characteristics such as varying shapes and sizes of debris, supraglacial lakes and streams, ice, ice cliffs, wet and dry snow, etc., selected for training are recommended [33]. However, it also brings a problem of effectively selecting these samples for large-scale glacier mapping. Our analysis suggests that it is best to allow the network to decide. Certainly, we still recommend paying attention to the training sample selection in the initial training stage because the better selections (i.e., more types of glaciers used for training) lead to the more usable, highquality initial glacier estimations for later retraining. Notably, with repeating the additional training samples creation and retraining process, there may exist a few glacier cases that are still unperceived by networks. Some of these cases can be annotated and then introduced into the training sample to address the issue.\nFurthermore, the time consumption for training networks was illustrated in Ref. [34]. As mentioned earlier, the NCH study area requires fewer numbers of repeating the training process since the networks that have learned the KWH glaciers now do not need to start the learning process from scratch. In the future, the glacier mapping efficiency can be further improved by introducing multiple glacial types and other key glacial characteristics to the \u2018\u2018knowledge\u2019\u2019 bank of the network.\nB. ISSUES AND IMPROVEMENTS Error in glacier mapping can occur in any region of the glacier. Although GlacierNet2 improves the terminus and ablation estimation over the GlacierNet [60], there still is a space to enhance it by including different mapping strategies, data, network structure, and post-processing algorithms. The network structure can be enhanced by experimenting with multiple structures and optimizing the structure parameters to improve the overall mapping performance, especially in estimating the terminus and ablation zone. However, correcting location-specific mapping issues is challenging because the deep-learning network structures are commonly referred to as the \u2018\u2018black box problem\u2019\u2019 [34], [64], [65], where eliminating them without causing another issue somewhere else in the study area is not straightforward. In these cases, the training data is a more effective way to guide the \u2018\u2018black box\u2019\u2019 to address the specific issues by itself. Post-processing can also be used for solving particular problems based on the output of the \u2018\u2018black box\u2019\u2019. The network structure adjustment\nVOLUME 10, 2022 72621\nhas been discussed in Ref. [34] and Ref. [60], so this section mainly focuses on the specific issues in the real-world largescale glacier mapping application."

            "text": "The proportion of the ice and snow of the ablation zone varies on different glaciers. The convolutional neural network (CNN) models were initially trained using\nthe debris-covered glacier (DCG) ablation zone samples containing significant debris proportions and only light snow and ice coverage. Thus, they cannot perceive some glacier ablation zones with relatively higher snow and ice coverage. Learning the additional sample (learned in retraining) with slightly higher snow and ice coverage can guide the networks to identify these snow-covered glaciers (Figure 7). However, this also distorts the network sensing\n72622 VOLUME 10, 2022\ncapacity of snowlines and ends up overestimating them. Since the overestimated area is a part belonging to SCAZ, it is not a considerable problem if the needed output is only the entire glacier estimation. However, if the objective is to accurately and separately map ablation and accumulation zones, the possible solution is to subdivide the object types in network classification or apply post-processing. The possible subdivision can 1) define different categories of land cover materials or 2) the snow and ice coverage. Moreover, the corresponding post-processing can be exploited to fix the snowline estimation if needed.\nApart from the ablation zone, the definition of SCAZ is also suggested to be improved. The SCAZ estimation module of GlacierNet2 accounts for all snowy regions that directly flow into the ablation as the SCAZ. This type of definition tends to overestimate the SCAZ and\ncannot meet the requirements of all nowadays used glacier analysis. A more systematic definition of SCAZ is required for varied glacier analysis. Accordingly, the corresponding post-processing algorithm can be exploited to adjust the outputs of GlacierNet2 to meet the user requirements."

The CNN, by our observation, received fewer adverse consequences from the shadow area since the surface gradients are not vanishing under the low illumination. Nevertheless, viewing the results from the early training stage, the shadow can possibly cause misclassifications as fewer such samples are learned by networks (Figure 5d). However, such misclassifications can be addressed after enhancing the network familiarity with the pixels from the same and the other glaciers (Figure 5d). Against the CNN models, the conventional algorithm receives more considerable adverse influences from the shadow; therefore, SICs were introduced into the post-processing of GlacierNet2. Also, to fully get rid of the effect from the shadow, the snowy region can be identified via machine-learning or deep-learning if corresponding labeled training data are provided."

            "text": "The vegetation zone removing algorithm embedded in the GlacierNet2 removes vegetation pixels located close to the termini and edges. This algorithm is not comprehensive enough to address the vegetation issues. Because vegetations that are growing on true glacier pixels can be randomly and loosely distributed on the surface of the glacier near the termini, impacting the glacier mapping performance (Figure 4d3 and Figure 8).\nIdeally, the differences between the vegetations belonging to glaciers and the background should be able to be figured out via the well-trained CNN. However, as vegetation is an uncommon glacier material, we do not have sufficient samples to train the CNN model. By only introducing a few special samples into the training data, the network may be misled to treat the nearby vegetation (belonging to the background) as the glacier. We recommend three steps in improving this issue 1) consider more vegetation pixel properties in the post-processing algorithm, 2) collect and annotate enough special cases for training if possible, and 3) develop an effective data augmentation algorithm [66].\nC. UNCERTAINTY Measuring the uncertainty of a machine learning algorithm or output is not straightforward. It is considered a \u2018\u2018black box problem\u2019\u2019 [34], [64], [65]. Deep-learning, an evolution of machine learning, comprises more hidden layers and therefore possesses massive trainable parameters that pose a higher difficulty in uncertainty estimation. Even thoughmany studies aimed at measuring the uncertainty of deep-learning,\nVOLUME 10, 2022 72623\nuncertainty measurement remains a challenge for many deeplearning applications [67]. For true uncertainty estimation in this study, we need error-free glacier boundaries for training and testing, which is a challenge since most of them are produced manually by different experts and rarely ever match.\nD. EXTENSION This study is the first step in using a deep-learningbased algorithm for large-scale glacier mapping. Such an approach and mapping strategy can be further improved where delineating glacier boundaries in multiple time periods and extending it globally can one day become a reality.\n72624 VOLUME 10, 2022\nThe large-scale mapping strategy shown here is intentionally not designed specifically for GlacierNet2. It fits most CNN segmentation models; thus, it can be applied differently. However, it is believed that there are many benefits in using GlacierNet2 because it can accurately estimate the ablation zone based on a small amount of training data. It also provides more useful data to the early repeat retraining stage, eventually reducing the times of repeat retraining. GlacierNet2 does not pose the high precision requirement of annotating lateral boundaries of training data as in Ref. [60].\nFurthermore, the deep-learning-based algorithm and the mapping strategy can also be adjusted and transferred to estimate other cryosphere objects, such as the glacier lake, if the appropriate initial training data are provided.\nIV. CONCLUSION This study is a preliminary exploration of the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale glacier mapping via a deep-learning-based approach. We modified the GlacierNet2 algorithm to fit the various glacier environments and proposed a large-scale mapping strategy based on semisupervised learning. The GlacierNet2 reaches the IOU of 0.7525 and 0.8115 for mapping the glaciers in the study area Nepal and China Himalaya (NCH) and Karakoram and\nWestern Himalaya (KWH), respectively. The GlacierNet2 was effectively utilized by the large-scale mapping strategy to extend the training dataset, and reduce the labor consumption and requirement of experts\u2019 experience for delineating glacier boundaries. The large-scale glacier mapping strategy is developed to take advantage of 1) the error tolerance property of convolutional neural network segmentation model, 2) GlacierNet2 that offers the capacity of producing highly accurate glacier estimation under a small amount of training data, 3) semi-supervised learning, and 4) the target object (i.e., glacier) properties. However, there is an opportunity to further improve the model and mapping strategy. The former can be improved in the scopes of network structure experiments and the post-processing algorithm, whereas the latter requires more comprehensive and unified glacier components definition and data augmentation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT Umesh K.
