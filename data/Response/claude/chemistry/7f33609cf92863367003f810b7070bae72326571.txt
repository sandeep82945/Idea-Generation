 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and identify other minor lutein cis-isomers like 6'-epilutein and 3',6'-diepilutein from natural sources. The paper identified and characterized two major mono-cis isomers, but other minor isomers likely exist in nature. Further isolation and NMR analysis could elucidate their structures. 

2. Study the biological activities of lutein cis-isomers, especially their bioavailability, antioxidant properties, and health benefits compared to all-trans-lutein. The paper mentions the lack of data in this area and the need for more research. 

3. Explore methods to selectively produce specific lutein cis-isomers through enzymatic or chemical isomerization. This could allow producing isomers with enhanced properties. The paper used iodine-catalyzed isomerization to generate a mix of isomers.

4. Identify genes and enzymes responsible for cis-isomer formation in plants like Anthemis tinctoria and Helichrysum italicum that accumulate high levels of specific isomers. This could uncover the biosynthetic mechanisms for selective cis-isomer production. 

5. Analyze more flower species for carotenoid content and lutein isomer distribution. The paper studied 20 species across 8 families, but many more exist. Expanded analysis could uncover additional natural sources of specific isomers like zeaxanthin-free lutein.
