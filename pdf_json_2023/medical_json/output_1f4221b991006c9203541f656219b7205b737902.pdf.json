    "abstractText": "Beauvericin (BEA) is an emerging mycotoxin produced by some species of Fusarium genera that widely contaminates food and feed. Gentiana lutea is a protected medicinal plant known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are attributed to its rich content of bioactive compounds. In order to evaluate the beneficial effects of G. lutea flower against BEA cytotoxicity, the aim of this study is to evaluate changes in protein expression after Jurkat cell exposure through a proteomics approach. To carry out the experiment, cells were exposed to intestinally digested G. lutea flower alone or in combination with the BEA standard (100 nM) over 7 days. Differentially expressed proteins were statistically evaluated (p < 0.05), revealing a total of 172 proteins with respect to the control in cells exposed to the BEA standard, 145 proteins for G. lutea alone, and 139 proteins when exposing the cells to the combined exposure. Bioinformatic analysis revealed processes implicated in mitochondria, ATP-related activity, and RNA binding. After careful analysis of differentially expressed proteins, it was evident that G. lutea attenuated, in most cases, the negative effects of BEA. Furthermore, it decreased the presence of major oncoproteins involved in the modulation of",

            "text": "The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) describes mycotoxins as toxic compounds produced by different types of fungi. They are food safety hazards that enter the food chain as a result of infection of harvests before or after collection and are typically found in foods such as cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and spices. A few have been legislated, but the vast majority have not [1]. In 2022, the EFSA launched a call for continuous collection of chemical contaminant occurrence data for food and feed, specifying some non-legislated mycotoxins, among them beauvericin (BEA) [2]. BEA is a cyclodepsipeptide mycotoxin, often found in high concentrations in raw and processed cereals, vegetables, fruits, and eggs because of fungal infection by Fusarium species [3]. In a review of total diet studies carried out in different countries focusing on mycotoxin determination, BEA was found in tomato products, nuts, and dried fruits in a concentration of approximately 2 \u00b5g/kg food [4]. In Europe, a study quantified BEA in a variety of ready-to-eat foods prepared with cereal products, vegetables, and meat [5]. Regarding its toxicity, BEA exposure in rodents induces immunotoxicity, reproductive disorders, and genotoxicity [6]. In order to reduce mycotoxin exposure damage in humans\nToxins 2023, 15, 538. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15090538 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxins\nToxins 2023, 15, 538 2 of 14\nand animals, dietary antioxidant concomitant intake is a possible recommendation that has been explored recently [7,8]. In this sense, plants such as Gentiana lutea may be interesting candidates to be included as ingredients in foods vulnerable to mycotoxin contamination. G. lutea, known as \u201cGreat Yellow Gentian\u201d, is a protected medical plant commonly found in mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe and Western Asia. It grows on rich, relatively acidic soils on grassy alpine and subalpine continents. It shows antioxidant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, stomachic, appetizer, and immunomodulatory properties. The plant can be used as a gallbladder and liver stimulant by affecting the efficiency of their function, as a remedy for digestive disorders, for mental and physical depression, and for exhaustion [9]. \u0160avikin et al. [10] discovered that extracts from leaves and flowers inhibited the growth of 15 out of 16 pathogenic microorganisms tested. They showed that the concentration of isogenistin was 10 times higher in flowers compared to leaves. Regarding the individual extract components, each tested compound did not possess a dominant role in the antimicrobial activity of raw extracts. Consequently, synergistic activity may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of the extracts. Bioactive compounds are widely present at high concentrations in the flowers of G. lutea. A high concentration of phenolic acids was recorded in water extracts of flowers, with caffeic acid being the most abundant. Also, naringenin and hesperidin were both quantified as heteropolycyclic, aromatic bioflavonoids, antioxidants, and chemopreventive agents. The capacity of G. lutea for scavenging superoxide radicals is essentially due to the possibility of their occurrence through enzyme- or metal-catalyzed processes. Therefore, the flowers of G. lutea can be used in the food industry, as they are rich sources of natural preservatives and antimicrobial agents [11]. In fact, one important strategy to prevent mycotoxigenic fungal growth on food and feed is the addition of plant extracts rich in bioactive compounds with antifungal properties [12\u201315]. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the beneficial role of digested Gentiana lutea flower against BEA toxicity in a Jurkat lymphoblastoid cell line through a proteomic approach. For this purpose, cells were exposed to BEA (100 nM) alone or in combination with G. lutea (2%) for 7 days. More specifically, proteins were identified by using LC-MS/MS-QTOF, and the ones with different abundances with respect to the control were statistically filtered. Moreover, categorization of biological processes, molecular functions, and metabolic pathways where these proteins were involved was performed using the online Database for Gene and Protein Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)."

            "text": "According to the EFSA\u2019s latest scientific opinion on risks to human and animal health related to the presence of emerging mycotoxins in food and feed, chronic exposure to BEA might represent a potential concern for human and animal health [16]. Focusing on the al-\nToxins 2023, 15, 538 8 of 14\nterations induced by this emerging mycotoxin on the immune system, it has been observed in studies in vivo to be concentrated in terms of the number and functional activity of T cells [17]. On the other hand, Gentiana lutea is a medicinal plant rich in several secondary metabolites that possess various therapeutic effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and especially immunomodulatory activities [18,19]. In particular, studies in vivo have demonstrated that this plant at different concentrations could prime the immune system and support the immune response against chronic diseases [20,21]. Moreover, it has been shown that its bitter compound, amarogentin, reduces chronic inflammation progression by reducing the secretion of cytokines by T cells [22]. As for doses employed, concentrations of 0.01 mg of plant extract were linked to the inhibition of enzymes involved in immune system toxicity [23]. Herein, this research combines the assessment of BEA\u2019s ability to modulate lymphoblastic T-cell proteomes after 7 days of exposure with an investigation of the beneficial contribution of G. lutea bioactive compounds to ameliorate this negative progression. Starting with BEA, it is a secondary metabolite that is capable of integrating into diverse mammalian cells through the formation of complex structures with cations in the mitochondrial phospholipidic membrane [24]. In this sense, it has been previously demonstrated to induce an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in leukemia cells, stimulating K+ channels and leading to cell shrinkage and death [25,26]. In particular, the inhibition of these channels, which provide the electrical force of divalent cations, negatively regulates T-cell activation [27]. Likewise, BEA altered the expression of genes coding for proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) in vivo [28,29]. In this work, the expression of proteins with significant differences based on BP, MF, and related pathways after BEA exposure in Jurkat T-cells confirmed the modification of mitochondrial processes, such as the ETC and activated K+ channels (Figure 2, Table 1). As for ETC, four proteins were modified in abundance levels in complex I (NDUFV1, NDUFA9, NDUFS6, and MTND2), whereas only one belonged to complex IV (COX6C). Moreover, five features of K+ channels were upregulated up to three fold, including HCN4, KCNMB1, KCNN3, KCNJ3, and KCNC4. Remarkably, when adding G. lutea, the expression was not altered, but, on the contrary, in the combined exposure, a strong downregulation (LogFC = \u22124) of complex I proteins was observed (Figure 4A). A fair number of significant proteins also belonged to the ATPase family (n = 11) and ATP binding (n = 24) in all conditions investigated (Figures 2 and 3). ATPase proteins are a fundamental group of cellular catalyzers that transduce the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into transmembrane ionic electrochemical potential differences. This process, in turn, requires an ATP binding site that allows ATP molecules to interact and make enzymes catalytically active [30]. The activity of integral membrane transporter P-type ATPases, which maintain chemical gradients across membranes, was modified by the presence of the mycotoxin, highlighting the upregulation of ATP13A5 (LogFC = 1.82135) and ATP2A1 (LogFC = 1.24134). Likewise, members of the ATPase family, such as MCM9, YTHDC2, NAV3, and SNRNP200, increased their expression up to fourfold (Figure 4A). In both groups, in the presence of G. lutea, genes were downregulated. As for ATP binding, 8 proteins out of 13 (CSK, EPRS1, TTL9, AK5, DCLK, DYNC2H1, SMCHD1, and TTN) revealed a similar trend of being upregulated with BEA but not with DG (Figure 4A). Focusing on both conditions, including BEA, another common MF in which a considerable number of features (n = 19) participated was RNA binding (Figures 2 and 3). RBPs control all post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and are fundamental for the development, homeostasis, and functioning of the immune system [31]. A dysregulation in its activity entails the aberrant activation of immune responses, leading to the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [32]. In this case, almost all entities were affected by BEA exposure when compared to the controls (Figure 4D), but, in contrast, such a condition was ameliorated once again by the addition of G. lutea. DEPs related to cellular processes were modified in cell cycle regulation (n = 7), mitotic cytokinesis (n = 2), endocytosis (n = 6), and cell morphology (n = 4) in Jurkat cells exposed\nToxins 2023, 15, 538 9 of 14\nto G. lutea individually or in combination with BEA. Recently, healing properties linked to the biological activities of this plant were reviewed by Ponticelli et al. [33], indicating how its bioactive molecules attenuate cell activity and prevent several human illnesses. More specifically, its bitter compounds, such as amarogentin and gentiopicroside, were able to modulate cell cycle impairments at different stages and cellular homeostasis mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. In particular, a root extract of this plant blocked platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB)-induced proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells [34]. According to these findings, important oncoproteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as murine double minute 2 (MDM2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 12 (MAPK12), zinc finger protein (ZNF268), and DNA-binding inhibitor (ID2), decreased in their expression down to \u22123.30-fold in both conditions (Figure 4B). On the contrary, they were slightly upregulated with BEA (log2FC > 0.0709), suggesting negative matching. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the overexpression of the above-mentioned enzymes is associated with the onset of several tumors [35\u201338]. Lastly, the results highlight the activity of the RHO GTPase protein cycle, and, in this case, with the DG (Table 1). These proteins are a major group of molecular activators that regulate several complex cellular processes by using a simple biochemical reaction. More specifically, they hydrolyze the GTP molecule to GDP by switching between the active state linked to GTP and the inactive one bound to GDP [39]. In the individual exposure, a total of 23 proteins were indicated in the RHO GTPase cycle, whereas a total of 11 were indicated in the combined one (Table 1). Among them, after DG exposure, standouts include the strong downregulation (logFC = \u22124) of GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1) and Rho GTPase activating protein 35 (ARHGAP35), which are putative oncoproteins whose overexpression is linked with different tumor types [40,41]. Furthermore, dedicator of cytokinesis 6 (DOCK6) followed the same trend with G. lutea (logFC = \u22124) but not with the mycotoxin (logFC = \u22120.53). In fact, according to these findings, these proteins play a fundamental role in the immune surveillance mechanisms of human cells and act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in various biological systems [42]. Likewise, the expression of C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) involved in modulation of immune function was strongly decreased in the combined exposure (logFC = \u22124) but not with BEA (logFC = 0.38) [43]."

            "text": "The exposure to BEA in vitro over 7 days showed a negative correlation with mitochondrial processes of complex I and IV, as well as ATP-linked activities and RNA binding, as previously described in in vivo models. On the contrary, G. lutea flower, in most cases, ameliorated these alterations induced by the mycotoxin. Moreover, its bioactive compounds attenuated cell cycle impairments through the downregulation of major oncoproteins such as MDM2, MAPK12, ZNF268, and ID2. Likewise, the RHO GTPase cycle stands out throughout the positive modification of immune surveillance mechanisms. Based on the current results, G. lutea flowers could be a possible candidate for the realization of food enriched with natural extracts to mitigate mycotoxin activity. However, further investigations are needed to better explore the use of such functional food ingredients in vivo as active agents against BEA toxicity."
