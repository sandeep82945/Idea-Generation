In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel peptide-based magnetogel obtained through the encapsulation of γ-Fe2O3-polyacrylic acid (PAA) nanoparticles (γ-Fe2O3NPs) into a hydrogel matrix, used for enhancing the ability of the hydrogel to remove Cr(III), Co(II), and Ni(II) pollutants from water. Fmoc-Phe (Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-Phenylalanine) and diphenylalanine (Phe2) were used as starting reagents for the hydrogelator (Fmoc-Phe3) synthesis via an enzymatic method. The PAA-coated magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized in a separate step, using the co-precipitation method, and encapsulated into the peptide-based hydrogel. The resulting organic/inorganic hybrid system (γ-Fe2O3NPs-peptide) was characterized with different techniques, including FT-IR, Raman, UV-Vis, DLS, ζ-potential, XPS, FESEM-EDS, swelling ability tests, and rheology. Regarding the application in heavy metals removal from aqueous solutions, the behavior of the obtained magnetogel was compared to its precursors and the effect of the magnetic field was assessed. Four different systems were studied for the separation of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions, including (1) γ-Fe2O3NPs stabilized with PAA, (γ-Fe2O3NPs); (2) Fmoc-Phe3 hydrogel (HG); (3) γ-Fe2O3NPs embedded in peptide magnetogel (γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG); and (4) γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG in the presence of an external magnetic field. To quantify the removal efficiency of these four model systems, the UV-Vis technique was employed as a fast, cheap, and versatile method. The results demonstrate that both Fmoc-Phe3 hydrogel and γ-Fe2O3NPs peptide magnetogel can efficiently remove all the tested pollutants from water. Interestingly, due to the presence of magnetic γ-Fe2O3NPs inside the hydrogel, the removal efficiency can be enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. The proposed magnetogel represents a smart multifunctional nanosystem with improved absorption efficiency and synergic effect upon applying an external magnetic field. These results are promising for potential environmental applications of γ-Fe2O3NPs-peptide magnetogels to the removal of pollutants from aqueous media. 1. conclusions The goal of this work was to direct attention to emerging and novel research involving magnetogel nanohybrid materials that might be relevant in future applications for the treatment of wastewater, as well as in other fields. Generally, composite hydrogels are promising adsorbents with tunable features, and we demonstrated that the addition of effective functional groups in nanohybrid materials. In fact, the results achieved pointed out that the presence of γFe2O3NPs provides magnetic properties to the resulting nanohybrids, which can be applied for magnetic-based removal applications of contaminants, such as heavy metal ions, from aqueous phases. The results of the removal studies demonstrate that the presence of γFe2O3NPs in combination with the application of an external magnetic field increases the adsorption efficiency of the hydrogel matrix for all the metal ions tested in this study; in particular, the γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG + magnet was effective to absorb up to 2111 ± 72 mg/g for Co(II), 1758 ± 39 mg/g for Ni(II), and 142 ± 5 mg/g for Cr(III). The kinetic models showed the chemisorption of these cations onto the γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG (with and without the magnetic field). Regarding the native HG, Co(II) and Ni(II) showed chemisorption, but for the Cr(III), the results were fitted with a physical adsorption mechanism. This work showed that the peptide-based magnetogels can be introduced as promising adsorbing materials for wastewater treatment to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. 4. materials and methods  4.1. materials L-Phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine (H-Phe-Phe-OH, 98%, 312.36 g/mol) and N-(9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-L-phenylalanine (Fmoc-L-phenylalanine: Fmoc-Phe-OH, 99%, 387.44 g/mol) were purchased from Bachem GmbH (Weil am Rhein, Germany) and used as received. FeCl2·4H2O (198.75 g/mol) and FeCl3 (162.20 g/mol) were purchased from Fluka. NaOH (39.99 g/mol) and CrCl3·6H2O (158.36 g/mol) were purchased from Carlo Erba Reagents (Cornaredo (MI), Italy). NiCl2·6H2O (129.59 g/mol) and CoCl2·6H2O (129.83 g/mol) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFL ≥ 20,000 U/mg) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy) and used as received. Ultra-pure water (H2Oup) was obtained using a Zeneer Power I Scholar-UV (Full Tech Instruments, Rome, Italy) apparatus. In this study, the external magnetic field was provided by a commercial neodymium-based magnet possessing 39.270 cm3 volume, magnetization quality of N5, and 1.42–1.47 T of magnetic strength. 4.2. synthesis of γ-fe2o3nps@hg magnetogels γ-Fe2O3NPs were synthesized via the co-precipitation method in which 40 mg of FeCl3 and 25 mg of FeCl2·4H2O were dissolved in 25 mL of an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and degassed with Ar(g) for 15 min, followed by increasing the temperature to 80 ◦C [87]. Then, pH of this solution was increased to 11 by a fast addition of NaOH (10 M). The mixture was stirred at 80 ◦C for 1 h (with constant monitoring of the pH) and then cooled down to room temperature. The dark-brown colloidal solution of MNPs was collected by a strong magnet (1.42–1.47 T) and washed three times with a total volume of 150 mL of ultra-pure water to remove the excess amount of NaOH and other non-magnetic species. The resultant NPs were freeze-dried and stored at room temperature. Regarding PAA, it was synthesized by radical polymerization of acrylic acid (2 mL) in the presence of the initiator potassium persulfate (50 mg) in a total volume of 25 mL of water at 80 ◦C for 5 h. FmocPhe3 hydrogel synthesis was performed according to our previous work [44]. In brief, Phe2 and FmocPhe peptides were added in equimolar amounts to a colloidal solution containing 2 mL aqueous solution of the as-synthesized MNPs-PAA (10–30 mg/mL) and 420 µL of 0.5 M NaOH, stirring magnetically for 10 min. Then pH was adjusted to 7 by adding 1.5 mL of 0.1 M HCl, followed by the addition of 100 µL lipase aqueous solution (50 mg/mL), leaving the resultant mixture at 30 ◦C for 30 min. 4.3. uv-vis, ft-ir/atr and raman spectroscopies and dynamic light scattering (dls) All UV-Vis spectra of the MNPs and Fe2+/Fe3+ ions were recorded in 1.00 cm optical path quartz cells using a Cary 100 Varian spectrophotometer.

we used the plastic PMMA cells. FTIR-ATR data were collected with a Bruker Vertex 70 instrument (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany) using KRS-5 cells in the 4000−400 cm−1 range or in ATR mode on a diamond crystal in the 4000−600 cm−1 spectral region. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer with a minimum of 10 replicates. All measurements were carried out at least three times with reporting the average value ± standard deviation. Raman spectra were run at room temperature in backscattering geometry with an inVia Renishaw micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with an air-cooled CCD detector and super-Notch filters. An Ar+ ion laser (λlaser = 514 nm) was used, coupled to a Leica DLML microscope with a 20× objective. The resolution was 2 cm−1, and spectra were calibrated using the 520.5 cm−1 line of a silicon wafer [105]. 4.4. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) The XPS analysis was conducted using a modified Omicron NanoTechnology MXPS system. (Scienta Omicron GmbH, Taunusstein, Germany) Samples were excited by achromatic AlKα photons (hν = 1486.6 eV), operating the anode at 14–15 kV and 10–20 mA. The take-off angle and pass energy were fixed at 21◦ and 20 eV, respectively. Samples were prepared by casting onto a hydrogenated Si(100) wafer a 20 µL drop of MNPs-PAA, and the obtained Si-supported sample was left to dry overnight and then mounted on a stainless steel sample holder for measurement [106]. 4.5. electron microscopy studies FESEM images were performed using an Auriga Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope supported by an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (FESEM-EDS) instrument (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Samples were deposited onto conducting silicon stubs without the need of a conductive coating and analyzed at an accelerating voltage that avoided radiation damage. 4.6. rheology measurements The rheological properties of three magnetogels containing different concentration of NPs and of the native hydrogel were studied by using an Anton Paar MCR 302 rotational rheometer in frequency sweep experiments, (Anton Paar, Turin, Italy) as reported previously [44]. 4.7. swelling test Swelling tests of the hydrogel samples were conducted as reported previously [44]. The swelling degree (q) was calculated by using the following equation:
q = (Ws −Wd)/Wd (6)
where Ws is the weight of the hydrogel after removing the swelling solution and Wd is the weight of the freeze-dried sample. 4.8. adsorption experiments Magnetogel samples were prepared in cuvettes, and 2 mL of the target solutions (Co(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III)) were cast on top of them, using different concentrations of the cations (see Figure S7). We only used the 10 mg type γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG magnetogel because of its higher mechanical strength, evidenced by the rheological characterization. The removal studies were performed using UV-Vis spectroscopy, and the results are presented in Figures 7, 8 and S2–S4. For all the tested pollutants, we used three main hydrogel-based absorbents including (1) HG, (2) γ-Fe2O3NPs@HG magnetogel, and (3) γFe2O3NPs@HG + magnet). We also studied the removal efficiency of γ-Fe2O3NPs alone (10 mg/mL), and no significant change was observed in the UV-Vis of solutions. The UV-

Vis absorbances of the solutions were monitored over time with 15 min intervals, and the removal efficiency (RE) was estimated by absorption spectra using Equation (7) as follows:
RE (%) = (C0 − Cf)/C0 × 100 (7)
where C0 is the initial concentration of pollutant and Cf is the concentration of pollutant in the eluted solution. The calibration curves were obtained and used for the calculations. Also, the adsorption capacities were estimated using the stock solutions of the pollutants (Co(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III)) prepared at pH 7, and their concentrations remaining in solutions after specific time intervals were determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The adsorption capacity (qe, mg g−1) of the adsorbents was calculated using Equation (8) [107–109]:
qe = (C0 − Ce)/m × V (8)
where m (g) is the dried hydrogel mass, C0 and Ce (mg L−1) are the initial and equilibrium pollutant concentrations, and V (L) is the solution volume, respectively. Kinetic behavior was studied using non-linear pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models (Equations (9) and (10)) [108,110]. log(qe − qt) = logqe − k1t/2.303 (9)
t/qt = 1/k2qe2 + t/qe (10)
