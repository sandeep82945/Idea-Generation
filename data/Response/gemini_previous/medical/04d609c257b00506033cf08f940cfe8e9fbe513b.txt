1. **Investigate the impact of the ACH model on patient satisfaction and quality of life.** How does the ACH model compare to traditional inpatient care in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of life? Do patients in the ACH model experience less anxiety, depression, and pain? Are they more likely to report feeling in control of their care and to have a positive overall experience?


2. **Examine the cost-effectiveness of the ACH model.** Is the ACH model more cost-effective than traditional inpatient care? What are the cost savings associated with the ACH model, and how do they compare to the costs of traditional inpatient care?


3. **Explore the potential of the ACH model to reduce disparities in access to care.** Can the ACH model help to reduce disparities in access to care for underserved populations, such as rural residents, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities? How can the ACH model be adapted to meet the needs of these populations?


4. **Investigate the feasibility of using the ACH model to provide care for patients with chronic conditions.** Can the ACH model be used to provide ongoing care for patients with chronic conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, and COPD? How can the ACH model be adapted to meet the needs of these patients?


5. **Examine the potential of the ACH model to improve care coordination and communication between providers.** How does the ACH model improve care coordination and communication between providers? Do providers in the ACH model have better access to patient information and are they more likely to communicate with each other about patient care? How can the ACH model be used to further improve care coordination and communication?
