    "abstractText": "The presence of antibiotic residues in water is linked to the emergence of antibiotic resistance globally and necessitates novel decontamination strategies to minimize antibiotic residue exposure in both the environment and food. A holistic assessment of cold atmospheric pressure plasma technology (CAPP) for \u03b2-lactam antibiotic residue removal is described in this study. CAPP operating parameters including plasma jet voltage, gas composition and treatment time were optimized, with highest \u03b2-lactam degradation efficiencies obtained for a helium jet operated at 6 kV. Main by-products detected indicate pH-driven peroxidation as a main mechanism of CAPP-induced decomposition of \u03b2-lactams. No in vitro hepatocytotoxicity was observed in HepG2 cells following exposure to treated samples, and E. coli exposed to CAPP-degraded \u03b2-lactams did not exhibit resistance development. In surface water, over 50% decrease in antibiotic levels was achieved after only 5 min of treatment. However, high dependence of treatment efficiency on residue concentration, pH and presence of polar macromolecules was observed.",

            "text": "Climate change and increasing human global population, expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2030, contribute to significant concerns regarding both food safety and security [1]. Thus, increased efforts are directed towards improving agricultural productivity and more efficient management of current resources [2,3] while assuring consumers\u2019 safety via continuous monitoring of a variety of man-made and natural chemical residues in food commodities and the environment itself [4,5]. In the past four decades, there has been an increase in the use of a number of pharmaceuticals in animal husbandry to improve growth performance, including anabolic steroids and antimicrobials [6]. The excessive use of antibiotics in clinical, agricultural and veterinary settings has led to the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Accordingly, the incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections are rising annually and current projections estimate as many as 10 million deaths annually by 2050 with substantial associated costs of treating such infections of USD 20 billion per year in the US alone [7]. Recent analysis of the global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) predicted that 1.27 million deaths were attributable to bacterial AMR in 2019 [8]. The World Health Organization (WHO) have highlighted AMR as one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development [9]. Antibiotic-resistance hotspots were identified in medical settings but also in the environment, where exposure to anthropogenic use of antibiotics is a feature, including agricultural and aquaculture facilities, municipal and wastewater systems and\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1115. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12071115 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1115 2 of 16\npharmaceutical manufacturing effluents [10]. The release of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including antibiotics, into the natural environment occurs during manufacture, use and disposal (including in sewage and animal waste), leading to disruption of natural ecosystems, and is considered a global threat to human and environmental health [11,12], with low- to middle-income countries worst affected by API pollution. Antibiotics are ubiquitous contaminants and contribute to antibiotic-resistance gene (ARG) reservoirs in the environment [13], with antibiotic concentrations in many rivers contaminated by sewage thought to be sufficient to drive the emergence of ARGs [12]. Broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins make up 55% of total antibiotic consumption globally [14]. Consequently, a large proportion of EU fresh waterways have been reported to be contaminated with sub-\u00b5g/L concentrations of antibiotics, with \u03b2-lactams being one of the most frequently detected residues [15] resulting in detection of resistance towards \u03b2-lactam antibiotics detected in high frequencies in treated wastewater microbial populations [16]. The European Union enforces stringent regulations on the presence of pharmaceutical residues in animal-derived food, where samples are considered non-compliant if they contain 1% or more of such residues [17,18]. However, there have been recent reports of samples that not only exceed this limit but contain considerably high percentages of antibiotic residues [19\u201321]. These findings are particularly concerning as such residues could potentially contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [22]. To limit environmental exposure to antibiotic residues in hospital and industrial wastewater effluents, and limit food wastage through rejection of non-compliant produce, novel technologies enabling fast and efficient detoxification are being currently explored. A number of approaches have been assessed in the literature including photolysis, peroxidation, ozonation or chlorination [23\u201326]. Nevertheless, municipal wastewater-treatment systems are not designed to and are unable to fully remove antibiotic (and other API) residues [27]; modifications of conventional wastewater treatment are still being explored including membrane bioreactors [28] or hybrid carbon membranes [29]. Plasma is classified as a unique state of matter, of wholly or partially ionized gases, comprised of various reactive atomic and molecular species, including neutral atoms and molecules, ions, radicals, excited state electrons and photons [30]. The ability to generate plasmas at or near room temperature, and production of such a diverse mixture of reactive species, has led to nascent fields of research in plasma chemistry, plasma medicine, material engineering, as well as emerging environmental and agricultural applications [31], including wastewater decontamination from surfactants, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, dyes or disinfectants [32\u201334]. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, with a limited number of compounds assessed [35\u201337]. The present study evaluates the efficiency of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) technology in the degradation/removal of a panel of \u03b2-lactam antibiotic residues in both surface water and milk, contributing to the efforts to tackle antibiotic resistance and food safety and security issues through modulation of aqueous antibiotic residues. A complex assessment of residue degradation, by-product formation, their toxicological characteristics and ability to induce resistance in E. coli, alongside examination of the influence of matrix constituents on degradation efficiency, are described, employing high- and low-resolution mass spectrometry as well as in vitro bioassays."

However, at higher concentrations the degradation kinetics of certain compounds shift towards a zero-order reaction (Figure 1), especially visible for amoxicillin. The gradual accumulation of reactive species does not seem to influence the decomposition rate; hence, the fitted equations explain the dynamics in a worse manner, yielding higher prediction errors.

In agreement with previous reports, lower reactive species concentrations and so decomposition efficiencies can be expected at lower operating voltages and oxygen presence in the gas mixture [38]. Statistically, there is no difference between He, 5 kV jet and He/O2, 6 kV jet decomposition rates, which indicates that introduction of only 0.5% of oxygen into feed gas has a similar effect, that is, a decrease in applied potential difference of 1 kV. In the mixed gas jets, oxygen concentration is associated with the decrease in the total current and so plasma density, resulting in a decrease in OH radical, NO and H\u03b1 concentrations at the expense of an increase in ozone and O radical formation due to higher electronegativity of oxygen [39]. A similar response was noted and described in the system employed herein [40]. During our experiments, we observed a significant influence in the buffering capacity and pH on the decomposition rates. A notable pH drop was witnessed during the plasma treatment in water, from 7 to 4.5 over the course of a 10 min treatment. Conversely, the pH in PBS remained constant at 7.5 throughout the treatment. The differential pH conditions between water and PBS influenced the reaction rates and decontamination efficiency, with a marked decrease in rates by 56% on average. This effect was more pronounced for cephalosporins (65 \u00b1 8%) than penicillins (46 \u00b1 11%) [41,42]. One of the main reactive species present in water during plasma treatment was shown to be hydrogen peroxide and an increase in peroxidation efficiency was previously correlated with pH decrease [43]. We attribute the pH-dependent efficiency to enhanced peroxidation at lower pH values, which is considered the main mechanism for the degradation of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in our setup. Hence, the influence of pH and buffering capacity plays a crucial role in the plasma treatment\u2019s overall effectiveness and needs to be considered when designing and interpreting such decontamination processes. Consequently, additional modeling was performed to correlate energies on the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with obtained reaction rates in water. Performed regression (Figure 3) revealed moderate (R2 = 0.76) dependence on the HOMO energies, similar to previous report on \u03b2-lactams oxidation by peracetic acid [19], offering some indication of oxidation potential within the \u03b2-lactam compounds group, which could be employed as a predictor of treatment efficiency for other compounds within the group.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 16\nThe fastest degradation was achieved for He jet operated at 6 kV with reaction rates ranging from 0.0121/s to 0.0061/s, translating to half lives between 0.95 min and 1.93 min, with most and least sensitive antibiotics being cefquinome and amoxicillin, respectively.

Argon was employed as a collision gas, with a flow of 0.24 mL/min, yielding a collision cell pressure of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 mBar. Inter-scan and -channel delays were both set to 3 ms, while dwell times ranged from 30 to 200 ms. Inter-scan delay and inter-channel delay were set to 0.003 s. The cone voltage and collision energy were optimized for each analyte and a minimum of two product ions were selected so that a minimum of four identification points were obtained for all the analytes, as required by Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. In order to investigate antibiotics-decomposition by-products as well as plasmatreatment influence on the milk matrix components, both antibiotics solution in solvent and milk extracts exposed to plasma were analyzed, employing high-resolution mass spectrometry. The chromatographic separation was performed on Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC (Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an Acquity Cortecs T3 column (100 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m), maintained at 45 \u25e6C. The pump was operated at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with mobile phases (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in methanol with injection volume at 5 \u00b5L. A linear gradient was set as follows: 1.50 min of 99% (A) to 99% (B) over 18 min with final 2 min at initial conditions for column equilibration. Mass spectral data were attained using Waters Xevo G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) with an electrospray ionization source operating in positive mode over the range 50\u20131200 m/z with a lock\u2013spray interface for real-time accurate dual-point mass correction with Lecuine-Enkephalin. The UPLC-MS/MS and HRMS systems were controlled via MassLynx software (V4.1) with targeted method results processed with TargetLynx software (V4.1), while untargeted data were extracted, deconvoluted and normalized with Progenesis QI, including subsequent statistical analysis employing UV-scaled data analyzed via principal component analysis (PCA)."

Deuterium-labeled standards were dissolved in D2O/MeCN-d4 to avoid isotope exchange. Each standard solution was divided into aliquots and stored in amber vials at \u221280 \u25e6C for single use only. Fresh stocks were prepared every 3 months due to reported low stability of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [42,47]. Working standards were prepared and stored in a similar matter.

Additionally, blank solvent as well as the solvent equivalent of CL2 were injected every five samples to monitor the performance of the equipment during the run. For the analysis of solvent solutions, a calibration curve with a minimum of five points was injected on the day of the analysis to ensure the linearity within 100% to 1% of the tested concentration(s). For the untargeted UPLC-HRMS analysis, a pooled milk extract sample was injected every five samples to monitor for possible instrumental drifts with randomized sample order."

The linearity of the curves was considered satisfactory if R2 \u2265 0.99 and if individual residuals did not deviate by more than \u00b115% from the calibration curve with the lowest point not deviating more than \u00b120%. The accuracy of the analytical method was assessed via analysis of 20 different blank samples, which for the MRL substances were assessed at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 times the MRLs established by current legislation, except for DAC and DCCD, which were validated at 60 and 50 ng/g, respectively. The WLR study was performed on three separate days with 18 different negative samples randomized before fortification at each validation level. The available labeled compounds were used in the quantification of their corresponding analytes. Additionally, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin and oxacillin were all corrected using nafcillin-D5; cefacetrile was corrected using cefazolin-13C215N; cefalonium was corrected using cephalexin-D5. No internal standards were used for the other analytes, as the available labeled compounds were found to be unsuitable in their quantification. For the MRL substances, CC\u03b1 and CC\u03b2 were calculated from the within-laboratory reproducibility data, while matrix effects were evaluated by spiking 20 different blank samples post-extraction at the MRL level and the signal obtained from those samples was compared to the signal obtained from a standard solution at the same concentration."

Multiple parameters including cell number (CN), nuclear area (NA), nuclear intensity (NI), mitochondrial mass (MM) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) that are indicators of cell health were simultaneously evaluated. The cells were maintained in media in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37 \u25e6C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere (v/v). Cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 1% pen/strep (v/v), 1 mM sodium pyruvate\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1115 13 of 16\nand 2 mM L-glutamine. TrypLE\u2122 Express was used to dissociate the adherent HepG2 cells from the flask prior to staining with trypan blue for cell counting and viability check using a Countess\u00ae automated cell counter. Cells were seeded into Corning\u00ae BioCoat\u2122 Collagen I, 96 well, clear flat-bottom microtitre plates (Corning Life Sciences, New York, NY, USA) at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were exposed to the test compounds prepared in the media described above for 48 h. Negative controls of 0.1% DMSO/0.4% MeOH (v/v) in media and 0.1% DMSO/media (v/v) and a positive control, valinomycin (final concentration of 60 \u00b5M), in media were prepared and included in the exposure study. Hoechst nuclear stain was used to identify cells (label DNA) and thus allowed measurement of cell number (CN), nuclear area (NA) and nuclear intensity (NI), while MitoTracker\u00ae Orange CMTMRos was used to evaluate mitochondrial function such as any changes in mitochondrial mass (MM) or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). To study the influence of CAPP exposure on the toxicity of AMX, an untreated solution at 256 \u00b5g/mL in water (final solution in media 1.2 \u00b5g/mL) was compared with the aliquot of the same solution exposed to plasma for 20 min, resulting in 50% decomposition.

E. coli is a frequently used representative for a Gram-negative organism, a common bacterial species present in the human gut microbiome, and often the target of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Given its well-characterized genomic, the selection of E. coli offers an initial look at the potential resistance development under the treatment conditions. E. coli was stored at \u221280 \u25e6C in MicrobankTM vials (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Cheshire, UK) and sub-cultured onto M\u00fcller Hinton agar (MHA) at 37 \u25e6C. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were used for AMX antimicrobial assessment and were performed based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M07-A10 \u201cMethods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that grow aerobically\u201d. For the resistance-evolution study, identical colonies of E. coli were used to create three bacterial suspensions in M\u00fcller Hinton Broth (MHB) (lineages A, B and C). For each lineage, bacterial suspension with either no AMX, 0.25 \u00d7 MIC value of AMX (0.5 \u00b5g/mL), 0.5 \u00b5g/mL of 20 min CAPP minute-treated AMX and the equivalent AMX concentration of 20 min plasma-treated AMX (20 min CAPP treatment of a 256 \u00b5g/mL, 1 mL AMX solution in water resulted in an 80% reduction in AMX) were prepared and incubated for 16 h at 37 \u25e6C. New bacterial suspensions for each condition were propagated daily for 13 days from overnight suspension for each condition. Following overnight growth, the optical density (OD550 nm) of each suspension was checked to ensure adequate growth of all bacterial suspensions. Inoculation of new suspensions from the previous day\u2019s culture was normalized to an OD550 nm 0.15 and diluted 1 in 200 into fresh MHB for each condition. MIC assessment was completed every two days and on the 13th day. Daily subculturing on MHA was performed on each overnight suspension to confirm the absence of contamination."

High removal efficiencies were achieved in surface water, with no toxicity or contribution to the evolution of bacterial resistance detected in\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1115 14 of 16\nCAPP-treated antibiotic solutions in vitro. The results also underline the high sensitivity of CAPP-treatment efficiency to residue concentration, pH and the presence of polar macromolecules. Further research is required to fully model the CAPP-induced decontamination process taking into consideration all factors mentioned. Accordingly, implementation of CAPP may prove challenging due to the need for real-time monitoring of the influent composition as well as operational flexibility of the plasma system employed but could provide a scalable and efficient process for removal of antibiotic residues from wastewater.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antibiotics12071115/s1.
