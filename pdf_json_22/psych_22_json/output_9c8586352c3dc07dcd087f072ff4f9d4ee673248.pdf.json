More than half the workers with MSDs are absent at work due to their complaints.1\u00a0 The economic consequences are substantial for employees, employers, and society.1\u00a0 The healthcare sector is one of the occupational settings that is frequently confronted with MSDs.1\u00a0 The one- year prevalence of MSDs among nurses ranges between 33% and 88%, with the lower back, neck, shoulders, and knees being the most commonly affected areas.2 Similar prevalence rates have been found for other healthcare professionals.3\nHealthcare workers are exposed to high physical job demands.2,4\u00a0 They must transfer patients, handle heavy objects, stand for a prolonged period, repeatedly execute movements, and adopt uncomfortable postures.2,4\u00a0These tasks have been related to MSDs in the lower back, knees, shoulders, and wrists or hands.2,3,5- 10 In addition, psychosocial stressors at work could be involved in the occurrence and persistence of MSDs in healthcare workers.2,4 Research suggests that high demands (e.g., high workload, time pressure, mental and emotional stress), low job control, and a lack of social support are associated with pain in different regions of the body.2,3,5,7- 11 However, evidence on physical and psychosocial stressors at work remains inconclusive.\nWith respect to MSDs, pain- related cognitions and perceptions such as fear of movement (FOM), which is the belief that certain movements or activities will cause damage to the body, must also be taken into account.12- 15\u00a0 Multiple underlying mechanisms have been proposed to explain how FOM contributes to MSDs.12- 15 First, FOM may lead to overestimation of perceived sensations and amplification of the cognitive response to pain.14 Due to this altered functioning of the central nervous system, normal bodily sensations are perceived as painful and the pain experience is amplified.14 Second, cognitions about pain can alter behavior and thereby influence the risk of MSDs.15 An individual might develop FOM if an activity has caused pain, or even if the individual believes that certain movements can harm the body.15 In this situation, it seems logical to avoid specific activities. Although short- term avoidance may prevent or decrease MSDs, long- term avoidance interferes with valuable work activities and puts the individual at risk of disuse, disability, and prolonged pain.13,15\nTo date, only a few studies have evaluated the role of FOM in healthy individuals. Research indicates that FOM is related to MSDs in different body regions, both in healthcare workers and the general population.6,7,16,17 Specifically, FOM is related to new as well as ongoing MSDs.6 However, there is little knowledge on the\ninteraction between FOM and work- related physical and psychosocial factors in the development and persistence of MSDs. Only Jensen et al. evaluated whether the relationship between physical job demands and lower back pain depends on FOM.6\u00a0 They were not able to demonstrate a significant effect. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that high FOM levels lead to an increased risk of MSDs in combination with specific work- related factors is worth exploring. Such interactions might contribute to the literature on the role of work- related physical and psychosocial factors in MSDs.\nTherefore, this study aimed to investigate (1) the association between work- related physical and psychosocial factors, FOM, and MSDs in different body regions among healthcare workers, and (2) the moderating role of FOM on the association between work- related factors and MSDs."

The body parts were grouped as follows: neck\u2013 shoulder (neck, shoulders, and upper back), lower back, upper extremities (elbows, wrists, and hands), and lower extremities (hips, knees, ankles, and feet). Previous studies have used the same subdivision.17\u00a0The participants were categorized as having musculoskeletal complaints when they answered \u201cYes, on a regular basis,\u201d or \u201cYes, long- lasting\u201d on at least one part of the body in one region.\n13489585, 2022, 1, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/1348-9585.12314 by V rije U niversiteit B russel (V U B ), W iley O nline L ibrary on [24/07/2023].

The scores range from 13 to 52, with high scores indicating high FOM levels. Previous studies have shown support for the validity and reliability of the TSK.20 Several authors preferred removing the four reverse- scored items from the original 17- items scale since this improved the psychometric parameters.21\u00a0Therefore, the 13- items Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK- 13) was used in this study; it showed good reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.85).\nThe work- related factors assessed in this study were physical job demands, workload, autonomy at work, and social support. Physical job demands were measured using five items from the Dutch Musculoskeletal Questionnaire.18\u00a0 The participants rated the extent to which they performed each of several tasks at work. Originally, this scale consisted of 11 items. The five selected items have high factor loadings on the first factor, and the scale had good reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.82). High scores represented physically demanding jobs. The scales for workload (three items) and social support from colleagues and direct supervisor (four items) were derived from the Short Inventory to Monitor Psychosocial Hazards (SIMPH).22\u00a0 The SIMPH is a validated and reliable questionnaire that surveys major psychosocial hazards at work through 11 different scales.22 Both scales for workload (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.88) and social support (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.75) had good to acceptable reliabilities. Autonomy at work was measured using four items from the Questionnaire on the Experience and Evaluation of Work, a validated Dutch questionnaire measuring psychosocial well- being and work- related stress.23\u00a0The scale for autonomy had acceptable reliability (Cronbach's\n\u03b1\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.77). High scores indicated unfavorable outcomes on the scale for workload and favorable outcomes on the scales for social support and autonomy."

Interactions between FOM and each of the other independent variables (resulting in four interaction terms for each type of MSD) were also included in the model. First, the entire model was tested.

Fear of movement had a negative interaction effect on the relationship between autonomy at work and MSD in the lower extremities (see Figure\u00a04A). Healthcare workers with higher FOM levels but lower levels of autonomy at work were at higher risk of MSD in the lower extremities than those with higher levels of autonomy at work. For healthcare workers with lower FOM levels, they were more likely to experience MSD in the lower extremities when they had higher levels of autonomy at work compared to lower levels of autonomy at work. Additionally, workers with higher FOM levels reported MSD in the lower extremities more frequently than workers with lower FOM levels. This difference in risk between healthcare workers with higher and lower levels of FOM was especially true in the case of lower levels of autonomy at work, but decreased when healthcare workers experienced more autonomy. Further, FOM negatively interacted with workload in the prediction of lower back pain (see Figure\u00a0 4B). Healthcare workers with higher FOM levels but lower workloads were at higher risk of MSD in the lower back than those with higher workloads. Fear of movement was associated with lower odds of pain in the lower back among healthcare workers with higher workloads and higher odds of pain in the lower back among healthcare workers with lower workloads.\nT A B L E 1 Descriptive characteristics of the study population\nn (%)\nOccupation n\u00a0=\u00a0305\nNurse 102 (33.4%)\nNursing assistant 146 (47.9%)\nParamedic 57 (18.7%)\nAge n\u00a0=\u00a0298\nYounger than 25\u00a0years 50 (16.8%)\n25\u2013 34\u00a0years 78 (26.2%)\n35\u2013 44\u00a0years 78 (26.2%)\n45\u00a0years or older 92 (30.9%)\nGender n\u00a0=\u00a0300\nWomen 264 (88%)\nMen 36 (12%)\nWork regime n\u00a0=\u00a0288\nFull- time 90 (31.3%)\nBetween full- time and half- time 133 (46.2%)\nHalf- time (or less) 65 (22.5%)\nEducation n\u00a0=\u00a0301\nLower secondary school 33 (10.9%)\nHigher secondary school 127 (42.2%)\nCollege of higher education or university 141 (46.9%)\nTenure in function n\u00a0=\u00a0264\n0\u2013 4\u00a0years 91 (34.5%)\n5\u2013 9\u00a0years 61 (23.1%)\n10\u2013 14\u00a0years 32 (12.1%)\n(+) 15\u00a0years 80 (30.3%)\nMusculoskeletal disorders over the past year\nNeck and shoulders 225/283 (79.5%)\nLower back 202/279 (72.4%)\nUpper extremities 112/261 (42.9%)\nLower extremities 170/266 (63.9%)\nMinimum one region with complaints 271/290 (93.4%)\n13489585, 2022, 1, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/1348-9585.12314 by V rije U niversiteit B russel (V U B ), W iley O nline L ibrary on [24/07/2023].

Healthcare workers frequently lift and perform recurrent movements engaging the elbows, wrists, and fingers, which might contribute to this risk.2 Previous research found similar results but linked transferring patients, lifting heavy objects, and standing in uncomfortable positions to MSDs in other regions such as the lower back.2,3,5- 10 For psychosocial factors, social support is a protective factor for pain in the lower back, and similar trends were noted for other regions. Good collaboration and support at work can prevent MSDs.2,7- 11 A supportive environment might help with physical job demands and reduce distress by dividing the work or completing difficult tasks together.9 Furthermore, a strong team might cope better with a suddenly increased workload (e.g., when a colleague is on sick leave). In the case of poor social support, workers might be afraid to ask colleagues for help. Consequently, they force themselves to work in suboptimal conditions. Our results show\nthat autonomy at work contributes to lower back pain. The positive association between autonomy at work and work engagement could support these findings.29 It is possible that healthcare workers with autonomy at work put in extra effort to perform their jobs. Therefore, they could be exposed to higher physical and mental demands. However, previous studies have shown a protective role of job control and autonomy at work on the occurrence of MSDs.2,3,7,9- 11 Finally, workload did not predict MSDs in the current study. It seems that personal and contextual factors play a role in the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs. A study in Europe showed that nurses who are dissatisfied with their physical job demands are at a higher risk of MSDs than those who are satisfied.8\u00a0The lack of ergonomic devices to assist with physical job demands has been linked to MSDs as well.8,9 Another study reported that nurses who participate in regular recreational physical activity are at low risk\nF I G U R E 4 Interaction effects between FOM and work- related factors in the prediction of MSDs in healthcare workers.

Finally, research has shown an improvement in perceived stress at work due to stress management interventions.31 Healthcare workers with adequate stress management skills might cope better with psychosocial stressors, such as high workloads. Future studies should consider personal and contextual factors when evaluating the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs in healthcare workers.\nFurther, this study demonstrates that the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs in healthcare workers depends on FOM. First, FOM moderates the association between autonomy at work and pain in the lower extremities. FOM was associated with higher odds of MSDs among the healthcare workers with lower levels of autonomy at work. These workers might be fearful when performing certain activities and lack influence in the planning or execution of their tasks. Consequently, they may experience increased muscle tone or engage in altered movement patterns and focus on sensory input related to pain, all of which increase the risk of MSDs.12,14 On the other hand, healthcare workers with higher FOM levels and higher levels of autonomy at work were less at risk of MSDs than those with lower levels of autonomy at work. Autonomy at work might create opportunities to avoid fearful activities and, hence, reduce painful experiences.15 In the case of high levels of autonomy at work, the difference in risk of MSDs in the lower extremities decreased substantially between healthcare workers with higher and lower levels of FOM. Due to the association between autonomy and work engagement, healthcare workers with lower levels of FOM might be more willing to expose themselves to physically demanding tasks to provide better care for their patients.29 This would probably not be the case for healthcare workers with higher levels of FOM. Due to long- lasting avoidance, these workers might have decreased physical capacity and be less prepared (e.g., suboptimal movement patterns or exaggerated bracing) when confronted with physically demanding tasks, still placing them at risk of MSDs.13,15 Second, the relationship between workload and MSD of the lower back depends on FOM. Healthcare workers with lower FOM levels but higher workloads were at higher risk of MSD in the lower back than those with lower workloads. High workloads might be associated with high physical job demands (e.g., increased number and hasty execution of tasks and long time in uncomfortable positions).32 Surprisingly, FOM was associated with lower odds of pain in the lower back among healthcare workers with higher workloads. The underlying mechanism is unclear in this situation. Finally, and contrary to our expectations, there was no\nsignificant effect of FOM on the relationship between physical job demands and MSDs. Although these results are in agreement with those of Jensen and colleagues, we believe that suboptimal movement patterns and overestimation of bodily sensations place healthcare workers with high physical demands at a high risk of developing MSDs.6,12,14 Possibly, this group was already on sick leave and, therefore, not included in this study.27,28\u00a0This is the second study to evaluate the moderating role of FOM on the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs, so further research is needed.6\u00a0Nevertheless, our results suggest that FOM should be considered when evaluating the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs.\nThis study adds value to the current literature and has important strengths. First, the results show that FOM as well as physical and psychosocial factors at work are related to MSDs in different body regions among healthcare workers. We suggest that the occupational assessment for the risk of MSDs should include pain- related cognitions besides work- related physical and psychosocial factors. Consequently, a personalized and multifactorial intervention trajectory can be implemented. A review by Van Hoof and colleagues showed insufficient evidence for interventions that focus on isolated work- related factors.33\u00a0Most of the included studies focused on stress management and ergonomic training, where interventions such as exercise and advice to stay active showed promising results. The curative sector uses, for example, pain education and graded activity to target FOM and improve physical functioning.34- 36 It might be worthwhile to provide pain education in the management of MSDs at work to employees who struggle with FOM as well as to gradually increase their work activities. Next, our results show that FOM can influence the relationship between work- related physical and psychosocial factors and MSDs. This interaction might explain the inconclusive results in the literature on the role of work- related physical and psychosocial factors in MSDs and should be considered in future studies along with other personal and contextual factors. Based on the interactions between FOM and work- related factors, it appears to be more beneficial to prioritize FOM optimization. For example: increasing autonomy at work in healthcare workers with higher FOM levels might lead to opportunities to avoid fearful activities, which could deteriorate the condition of the healthcare worker in the long run.13,15 Studies have shown that maladaptive painrelated cognitions must be targeted before activity- based interventions.36 People who are convinced that certain activities are truly harmful to the body could be less eager to engage in treatments focusing on exercise, physical activity, or ergonomic advice than those who are not.

First, this was a cross- sectional study, which made it impossible to demonstrate causal relationships. Since the impact of FOM on MSDs in employees is a relatively new research focus, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the causal relationship between FOM and work- related MSDs. Next, only healthcare workers who had their periodical health examination were recruited in this study, and the assessment of risk factors was based on self- report. This may have caused selection bias and reporting bias due to selective recall, social desirability, or negative affectivity. However, every healthcare worker, independent of health status, undergoes periodical health examinations, and the questionnaires to measure work- related physical and psychosocial risk factors, FOM, and MSDs have been validated in epidemiological studies.18- 20,22,23 Finally, this study only evaluated fear avoidance as a maladaptive response to pain. There has been increasing interest in other responses such as an endurance response.37- 40 Avoidance is characterized by fear of pain, fear of movement, and catastrophizing, while an endurance- based response is characterized by thought suppression, distraction from pain and pain minimization. These individuals will persist in executing their daily activities despite pain. Without paying the necessary attention to recovery, they might put themselves at increased risk of overloading and, consequently, increased and prolonged pain. An endurancebased pain response is also associated with disability and a depressive mood.38 Future research should evaluate the interaction between other pain coping strategies and factors at work in the development and persistence of MSDs as this might have consequences for treatment."

The occupational evaluation of healthcare workers should consider work- related physical and psychosocial factors as well as FOM. Consequently, a personalized intervention that targets all factors contributing to MSDs can be implemented. Based on the interaction between FOM and work- related physical and psychosocial factors, it might be worthwhile to prioritize FOM optimization. Future studies are needed\nto corroborate our findings and evaluate if the relation between factors at work and MSDs is influenced by other pain response strategies. Furthermore, it is needed to explore the additional benefits of including modalities that target FOM in workplace interventions to prevent or address MSDs in healthcare workers."
