    "abstractText": "In this paper, we put forward a multi-party quantum private comparison (MQPC) protocol with two semi-honest third parties (TPs) by adopting d -dimensional Bell states, which can judge the size relationship of private integers from more than two users within one execution of protocol. Each TP is permitted to misbehave on her own but cannot collude with others. In the proposed MQPC protocol, TPs are only required to apply d dimensional single-particle measurements rather than d -dimensional Bell state measurements. There are no quantum entanglement swapping and unitary operations required in the proposed MQPC protocol. The security analysis validates that the proposed MQPC protocol can resist both the outside attacks and the participant attacks. The proposed MQPC protocol is adaptive for the case that n users want to compare the size relationship of their private integers under the control of two supervisors. Furthermore, the proposed MQPC protocol can be used in the strange user environment, because there are not any communication and pre-shared key between each pair of users.",

            "text": "Classical private comparison is one of the most important branches of classical secure\nmultiparty computation (SMC). In 1982, the first classical private comparison protocol, called as\nthe millionaire problem, was proposed by Yao [1], which aims to determine who is the richer one\nwithin the mentioned two millionaires without leaking their actual wealth. However, the security of\nclassical private comparison relies on the computation complexity, which means that the\ncorresponding protocol cannot guarantee the security as long as the computer has enough ability to\ndeal with extremely complex data. In order to overcome this problem, quantum private comparison\n(QPC) was put forward in 2009 by combining quantum mechanics and classical private comparison\n[2]. Subsequently, lots of two-party QPC protocols of equality, which can compare the equality of\nprivate inputs from two users, have been proposed [3-19]. In 2013, the first multi-party quantum\nprivate comparison (MQPC) protocol of equality, which can compare the equality of private inputs\nfrom more than two users within one execution of protocol, was put forward by Chang et al. [20].\nLater, numerous MQPC protocols of equality have been constructed with different quantum\ntechnologies [21-26]. However, none of the QPC protocols in Refs.[2-26] have the function of\njudging the size relationship (i.e., greater than, equal to or smaller than) of private inputs from more\nthan two users within one execution of protocol, which restricts their applications in practice.\nIn 2013, the first QPC protocol of size relationship was put forward by Lin et al. [27] by using\nd -dimensional Bell states, which can compare the size relationship of private inputs from two users.\nThen, Yu et al. [28] designed a two-party QPC protocol of size relationship with d - dimensional single-particle states in 2013; Guo et al. [29] proposed a two-party QPC protocol of size relationship based on entanglement swapping of d - dimensional Bell states in 2014; Chen et al. [30] put forward a two-party QPC protocol of size relationship via quantum walks on circle in 2021. However, the\nQPC protocols of size relationship in Refs.[27-30] are not feasible for the multi-user circumstance.\nFortunately, in 2014, Luo et al. [31] put forward the first MQPC protocol of size relationship by using d -dimensional entangled states, which can judge the size relationship of private inputs from more than two users within one execution of protocol. Since then, a series of MQPC protocols of\nsize relationship have been proposed, such as the ones with single-particle states [32-33], the one with d -dimensional GHZ states [34] and the one with d -dimensional Bell states [35]. At present, the number of MQPC protocols of size relationship is still few. Moreover, the first protocol of\nRef.[32] is the only MQPC protocol of size relationship which has two supervisors.\nBased on the above analysis, in this paper, we are devoted to considering the case that n\nstrange users want to compare the size relationship of their private integers under the control of two supervisors. We use d -dimensional Bell states to design a novel MQPC protocol of size relationship with two semi-honest third parties (TPs). Two TPs only need to perform d -dimensional singleparticle measurements rather than d -dimensional Bell state measurements. The proposed MQPC protocol requires neither quantum entanglement swapping nor unitary operations. The proposed\nMQPC protocol can be adaptive for the strange user environment."

It is apparent that, when the two qudits of the d -dimensional Bell state in Eq.(1)\nare measured with the 1T basis, they are collapsed into j and j v , respectively. As a result, we\nhave j v \u229d j v= , where \u229d denotes the modulo d subtraction. We will use this property of the d -\ndimensional Bell state in Eq.(1) to design the proposed MQPC protocol.\nSuppose that there are n strange users, 1 1, , , nP P P , whose private integers can be represented\nby nppp ,,, 21  , respectively; 1TP and 2TP are two TPs, each of whom is permitted to misbehave on\nher own but cannot collude with others. Here,  0,1, ,ip h and 1, 2, ,i n= . When ( ), 2 0mod d = ,\nwe set 2\nd h = ; otherwise, we set\n1\n2\nd h \u2212 = . iP and 2TP pre-share the private key ik through a secure\nquantum key distribution (QKD) protocol,  0,1, , 1ik d \u2212 and 1, 2, ,i n= . 1 1, , , nP P P want to\ncompare the size relationship of their private integers under the control of 1TP and 2TP on the condition that there are not any communication and pre-shared key between any two of them, which implies that only when both 1TP and 2TP agree can 1 1, , , nP P P obtain the size relationship of their private integers. In the following, we put forward a novel MQPC protocol suitable for the strange user\nenvironment to accomplish this goal. Here, the quantum channels are assumed to be noiseless, while\nthe classical channels are supposed to be authenticated.\nStep 1: 1TP prepares n d -dimensional Bell states in Eq.(1), and picks out all of the first and the\nsecond particles of these n Bell states to form sequences 1S and 2S , respectively. Here, 1S and 2S can be represented by\n1 2 1 1 1 1, ,..., nS m m m =  \n(4)\nand\n1 2 2 2 2 2, ,..., nS m m m =\n  , (5)\nrespectively. Then, 1TP records the second label of the i th d -dimensional Bell state as iv . Here,\n 1 2, 0,1, , 1 i im m d \u2212 and 1, 2, ,i n= .\nStep 2: 1TP prepares L decoy photons which are randomly selected from the sets 1T and 2T . Then\nshe inserts them into 1S to form a new sequence ' 1S and sends it to 2TP via a quantum channel. After all particles of ' 1S are received by 2TP , 1TP and 2TP start the security check on the quantum channel between them. To be specific, 1TP announces the positions and the preparation bases of all decoy photons in\n'\n1S to 2TP ; then, 2TP acquires the measurement results of these decoy photons by measuring them with the correct measuring bases and returns these measurement results to 1TP ; afterward, 1TP judges whether there is an eavesdropper or not by comparing the received measurement results with decoy\nphotons\u2019 initial prepared states. If there is an eavesdropper, the protocol will be aborted; otherwise,\nthe protocol will be proceeded.\nStep 3: 1TP prepares n groups of L decoy photons which are randomly selected from the sets 1T\nand 2T . Then, 1TP inserts the particle 2 im into the i th decoy photon group at random position to\nconstruct a new sequence iG , where 1, 2, ,i n= . Finally, 1TP sends iG to iP .\nStep 4: 1TP announces the positions and the preparation bases of all decoy photons to iP , where\n1, 2, ,i n= . Based on published positions, iP measures the decoy photons with the correct\nmeasuring bases and publishes the corresponding measurement results to 1TP . Afterward, 1TP judges whether the quantum channel is secure or not by comparing the received measurement results with\nthe original states of decoy photons. If the quantum channel is secure, the protocol will be proceeded;\notherwise, the protocol will be terminated.\nStep 5: iP measures the particle 2 im with the 1T basis and records the value im2 , where\n1, 2, ,i n= . Then, iP calculates\n2 2\ni i\ni ir m p k=   . (6)\nAfter that, iP sends ir2 to 2TP via an authenticated classical channel.\nStep 6: 2TP measures the n particles 1 2 1 1 1, , , nm m m with the 1T basis and records the values\n1 2 1 1 1, , , nm m m . Then, 2TP generates a private integer q ,where  , 1, , 1q h h d + \u2212 . Afterward, 2TP\ncomputes\n1 1\ni i\nir m q k=   , (7)\nwhere 1, 2, ,i n= . After that, 2TP makes\n1\ni ir r= \u229d 2 ir . (8)\nFinally, 2TP sends R to 1TP via an authenticated classical channel, where  1 2, , , nR r r r= .\nStep 7: 1TP calculates\n( 1) ( )i i iM d r v= \u2212 \u2212  , (9)\nwhere 1, 2, ,i n= . Here, the size relationship of different iM s is same to that of different ip s. Finally,\n1TP announces the size relationship of different ip s to 1 1, , , nP P P through an authenticated classical channel.\nIn addition, in order to make the process of the proposed MQPC protocol easier to understand,\nwe draw it in Fig.1 after ignoring the procedures of security check."

Unfortunately, Eve\u2019s fake particles are not necessarily the same as the genuine ones, which makes her attack behavior\nundoubtedly discovered. Concretely speaking, for one decoy photon, the probability that Eve\u2019s attack on it can be detected is 1d\nd\n\u2212 ; for L decoy photons, the probability that Eve\u2019s attacks on them\ncan be detected is 1 1 1 1 1\nL L d\nd d \u2212    \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212        , which converges to 1 when L is large enough.\n(2) The measure-resend attack In order to acquire some useful information, Eve may intercept the particles of '1S ( iG ) sent out\nfrom 1TP in Step 2 (3), measure them randomly with the 1T basis or the 2T basis and sends the resulted states to 2TP ( iP ). Because Eve\u2019s measuring basis on decoy photons are not always consistent with their prepared basis, she inevitably leaves her trace on decoy photons.

Suppose that Eve imposes her unitary operation EU on the particle of ' 1S from 1TP to\n2TP and her probe particle  . For inducing no error in Step 2, the final state of Eve\u2019s probe should\nbe independent from the particle of ' 1S from 1TP to 2TP . Consequently, Eve gets nothing useful.\nProof. Firstly, consider the case that the particle of ' 1S is produced by 1TP in the 1T basis. We use\nt to represent the particle of '1S in the 1T basis. After Eve performs EU on t and  , the global\ncomposite quantum system is turned into\n( ) ' ' '\n1 ' 0 d E tt tt t U t t   \u2212 = = , (14)\nwhere 'tt ( ', 0,1, , 1t t d= \u2212 ) are Eve\u2019s probe states dependent on EU , and\n1\n1\n0\n2\n'\n' = \u2212\n=\nd\nt\ntt  . (15)\nIn order for Eve to escape the eavesdropping detection in Step 2, it should satisfy that 0' =tt for\n'tt  . As a result, Eq.(14) is changed into\n( )E tt ttU t t  = (16)\nfor 0,1, , 1t d= \u2212 .\nSecondly, consider the case that the particle of '1S is generated by 1TP in the 2T basis. For\nsimplicity, we use  \n\n \u2212\n=\n==\n1\n0\n2 1 d\nd\nti\nt e d tFJ to represent the particle of '1S in the 2T basis, where\n0,1, , 1t d= \u2212 .

            "text": "(1) The participant attack from one dishonest user\nIn the proposed MQPC protocol, n users essentially play the equal roles. Without loss of\ngenerality, suppose that 1P is the only dishonest user who tries to steal the private integers from other users.\nIn order to obtain something useful about bp , where nb ,,3,2 = , 1P may launch the outside\nattacks on the particles of '1S sent out from 1TP to 2TP in Step 2 or the particles of bG sent out from 1TP\nto bP in Step 3. Actually, 1P essentially plays the same role as Eve. As a result, just as previously analyzed in Sect.4.1, 1P cannot obtain something useful about bp without being detected.\nBesides, 1P may hear of br2 from bP in Step 5. According to Eq.(6), 1P cannot get bp since she has\nno way to acquire bm2 and bk . In addition, 1P may hear of br from 2TP in Step 6. According to Eq.(7)\nand Eq.(8), it is apparent that 1P still has no way to obtain bp . Finally, 1P receives the size relationship of different ip s from 1TP in Step 7, where 1, 2, ,i n= . However, she still has no chance to acquire\nbp .\nIn conclusion, one dishonest user has no chance to acquire other users\u2019 private integers.\n(2) The participant attack from two or more dishonest users\nWe analyze the worst situation that the number of dishonest users is 1\u2212n . Without loss of\ngenerality, assume that the dishonest users are 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + , who try to steal the private integer ap , where 2,3, , 1a n= \u2212 . 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + may launch their attacks on the particles\nof '1S sent out from 1TP to 2TP in Step 2 or the particles of aG sent out from 1TP to aP in Step 3. As\ndescribed in Sect.4.1, 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + are inevitably detected as an outside eavesdropper.\nBesides, 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + may hear of ar2 from aP in Step 5. According to Eq.(6), due to\nlack of 2 am and ak , 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + still cannot decode out ap . In addition,\n1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + may hear of ar from 2TP in Step 6. However, it is useless for 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + to get ap . Finally, 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + obtain the size relationship of\ndifferent ip s from 1TP in Step 7, where 1, 2, ,i n= . Unfortunately, 1 2 1 1, ,..., , , ,a a nP P P P P\u2212 + still has no access to ap .\n(3) The participant attack from semi-honest 1TP In the proposed MQPC protocol, 1TP is assumed to be semi-honest in the sense that she can\nmisbehave at her own willing but is not allowed to conspire with anyone else including 2TP . When\niP sends ir2 to 2TP in Step 5, 1TP may hear of ir2 , where 1, 2, ,i n= . However, 1TP has no idea about\nim2 and ik so that she still has no way to infer ip from ir2 according to Eq.(6). In addition, 1TP knows\nir from 2TP in Step 6, but it is helpless for her to get ip in this Step. Finally, although 1TP can calculate out iM in Step 7, she still has no way to obtain ip .\n(4) The participant attack from semi-honest 2TP In the proposed MQPC protocol, 2TP is supposed to be semi-honest, so she cannot conspire with\n1TP . 2TP gets ir2 from iP in Step 5, where 1, 2, ,i n= . In order to infer ip from ir2 , according to Eq.(6),\n2TP should know im2 ahead. In order to achieve this goal, 2TP may launch her attacks on iG during its\ntransmission from 1TP to iP in Step 3. However, 2TP essentially acts as an outside attacker and is\ninevitably detected according to the analysis of Sect.4.1. As a result, 2TP cannot get im2 without being\ndetected when launching her attacks. On the other hand, although 2TP can know 1 im , she still cannot\nget im2 by virtue of Eq.(10), due to lack of iv . In conclusion, 2TP has no chance to obtain ip based on\nir2 and ik .\nIn addition, 2TP may hear of the size relationship of different ip s from 1TP in Step 7, but it is still\nhelpless for her to acquire ip ."

In the following, we calculate the qudit\nefficiency of Eq.(26) for the proposed MQPC protocol. It needs to be declared that both the\nresources consumed for eavesdropping detection processes and the resources used for producing the pre-shared key ik are ignored, where 1, 2, ,i n= .\nIn the proposed MQPC protocol, iP owns the private integer ip , where 1, 2, ,i n= , hence we\nhave 1z = ; 1TP needs to prepare n d -dimensional Bell states in Eq.(1), so we obtain nx 2= ; besides,\niP needs to send ir2 to 2TP , where 1, 2, ,i n= , while 2TP needs to send R to 1TP , hence we acquire\nnnny 2=+= . In short, the qudit efficiency of the proposed MQPC protocol is nnn 4\n1\n22\n1 =\n+ = .\nIn addition, we compare the proposed MQPC protocol with previous MQPC protocols of size\nrelationship in Refs.[31-35] in detail after ignoring the eavesdropping detection processes, and\nsummarize the specific comparison outcomes in Table 1. According to Table 1, it can be concluded: \u2460 As for quantum resources, the proposed MQPC protocol exceeds the protocols of Ref.[31] and Ref.[34], as d -dimensional Bell states are much easier to prepare than d -dimensional n -particle\nentangled states and d -dimensional GHZ states; \u2461As for the usage of unitary operation, the\nproposed MQPC protocol defeats the protocols of Refs.[32-34], as it doesn\u2019t need unitary operation; \u2462 the proposed MQPC protocol and the first protocol of Ref.[32] are the only two MQPC protocols\nof size relationship which require two TPs.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, in order to determine the size relationship of private integers from more than two\nusers within one execution of protocol, we propose a novel MQPC protocol of size relationship with two semi-honest TPs by using d -dimensional Bell states, where two TPs are allowed to misbehave\non their owns but cannot conspire with anyone else. The proposed MQPC protocol is proven to be\nsecure against both the outside attacks and the participant attacks. The great merits of the proposed\nMQPC protocol lie in the following points:\n(1) Two TPs only employ d -dimensional single-particle measurements rather than d -\ndimensional Bell state measurements;\n(2) The proposed MQPC protocol needs neither quantum entanglement swapping nor unitary\noperations;\n(3) The proposed MQPC protocol is feasible for the situation that n users want to judge the size\nrelationship of their private integers under the control of two supervisors;\n(4) The proposed MQPC protocol can be used in the strange user environment, as there are not\nany communication and pre-shared key between each pair of users.\nRecently, by introducing the concept of semiquantumness [37-39] into QPC, semiquantum\nprivate comparison (SQPC) [36,40-46] has gained considerable developments. However, few of the\nexisting SQPC protocols can be used to determine the size relationship for private inputs from more\nthan two classical users through being implemented one round. In the future, we will concentrate\non studying this kind of SQPC.\nsecond\nprotocol\nof\nRef.[32]\ndimensional\nsingle-particle\nstates\ndimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nThe\nprotocol\nof\nRef.[33]\n2-dimensional\nsingle-particle\nstates\nn 1 2-dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nNo Yes Yes Yes No\nThe\nprotocol\nof\nRef.[34]\nd -\ndimensional\nGHZ states\nn 1 d -dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nNo Yes No Yes No\nThe\nprotocol\nof\nRef.[35]\nd -\ndimensional\nBell states\nn 1 d -dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nd -dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nYes Yes No No\nOur\nprotocol\nd -\ndimensional\nBell states\nn 2 d -dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nd -dimensional\nsingle-particle\nmeasurements\nYes Yes No No"
