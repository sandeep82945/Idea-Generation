    "abstractText": "The evolution of nutrition patterns in Zambia has resulted in the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition in the same population, the double burden of malnutrition. While Zambia has strong policies addressing undernutrition and stunting, these do not adequately address food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition and the adolescent age group and hence the need for nutrition policy reforms. We conducted a theory-based qualitative prospective policy analysis involving in-depth interviews with nutrition policy stakeholders and policy document review to examine the feasibility of introducing nutrition policy options that address the double burden of malnutrition among adolescents to identify barriers and facilitators to such policy reforms. Using the multiple streams theory, we categorized the barriers and facilitators to prospective policy reforms into those related to the problem, policy solutions and politics stream. The use of a life-course approach in nutrition programming could facilitate policy reforms, as adolescence is one of the critical invention points in a person\u2019s lifecycle. Another key facilitator of policy reform was the availability of institutional infrastructure that could be leveraged to deliver adolescent-focused policies. However, the lack of evidence on the burden and long-term impacts of adolescent nutrition problems, the food industry\u2019s strong influence over governments\u2019 policy agenda setting and the lack of public awareness to demand better nutrition were perceived as critical barriers to policy reforms. In addition, the use of the individual responsibility framing for nutrition problems was dominant among stakeholders. As a result, stakeholders did not perceive legislative nutrition policy options that effectively address food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition to be feasible for the Zambian context. Policy entrepreneurs are required to broker policy reforms that will get legislative policy options on the government\u2019s agenda as they can help raise public support and re-engineer the framing of nutrition problems and their solutions in Zambia.",

This coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition in the same population is termed the double burden of malnutrition (Popkin et al., 2019). Latest estimates indicate that 35% of children under 2 years are stunted, while 5% of children under 5 years are overweight or obese (Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Health and ICF, 2019). In the adult population, 24% are overweight, while 90% do not meet the dietary requirement of consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables daily (Mutale and Chilengi, 2018). Recent studies in the adolescent age group show that the snacking dietary pattern characterized by consuming processed food high in sugar, salt and fats is prevalent among urban school-going adolescents (Mukanu et al., 2022). However, Zambia\u2019s nutrition policies need to change more rapidly to address the development of new challenges associated with the nutrition transition.\nThe nutrition transition and the associated double burden of malnutrition being experienced in Zambia have food\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

The undernutrition component has been linked to agriculture policies that perpetuate the Zambian diet\u2019s lack of diversity (Mwanamwenge and Harris, 2017). Liberalized economic systems and globalization have contributed to the increased availability and affordability of processed, energy-dense foods (Harris, 2019). Nutrition problems are predominately framed as related to behavioural factors, and legislative interventions addressing food environment divers are lacking (Mukanu et al., 2020). In addition, although the adolescent age group has been identified as a \u2018second window of opportunity\u2019 for preventing adverse nutrition-related problems later in life (Patton et al., 2022), little attention is paid to this population group in Zambia, despite being exposed to unhealthy food environments that foster unhealthy diets (Mukanu et al., 2022). While Zambia has strong policies addressing undernutrition and stunting (National Food and Nutrition Commission, 2018), these do not adequately tackle food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition and hence the need for nutrition policy reforms.\nPolicy reform is an inherently political process that aims to change \u2018the rules of the game\u2019 by challenging the status quo, often aiming to improve the status of vulnerable groups by redistributing access to finite resources to address a problem or achieve a goal (Reich, 1995). Thus, policy reforms attract the interest of stakeholders who will likely benefit from maintaining the status quo or the change promised by reforms. The reforming policy involves using persuasive tactics to re-engineer how stakeholders perceive problems and their solutions to facilitate (or block) a status quo change. Evidence characterizing the extent and intensity of a problem and its associated outcomes is one of the tools used to push for policy reforms However, while important, evidence is not the only determinant of policy reform. Political science theories explain how social and political factors also influence policy reforms. For instance, institutions (government structures, policy networks and policy legacies) and interests (agendas of societal groups, elected officials, civil servants, researchers and policy entrepreneurs) can shape the ideas (what is known about the problem) about a policy issue and influence the policy options considered legitimate to address that particular issue (Shearer et al., 2016).\nPolicy actors (participants who impact and are impacted by policy processes) are central to policy reforms (Buse et al., 2012). Actor interests are reflected in frames they adopt to understand and communicate a policy \u2018problem\u2019 (policy narratives), influencing the solutions they likely support (Koduah et al., 2016). Frames are \u2018distinct and coherent interpretations of an issue containing a problem definition, casual attributions and recommended prescriptions\u2019 (Van Hulst and Yanow, 2016). Policy actors also carry power often associated with institutions and policy networks they are part of. Scholars have shown that with this power, actors can garner support and build policy networks with like-minded actors to influence policy direction in ways that protect and favour their interests as a group (Shearer et al., 2016).\nNutrition policy reforms attract the interests of various actors as nutrition problems are complex and have political, economic and health dimensions (Balarajan and Reich, 2016). For example, food industry actors have emerged as powerful and highly interested in nutrition policy development across the globe, with the growing recognition of the role\nof \u2018commercial determinants of health\u2019 in poor nutrition (Kickbusch et al., 2016; Mialon, 2020). The financial resources and enabling liberalized economic systems give the food industry power to influence policy development and protect their interests through corporate political activities such as lobbying and corporate social responsibility (Mialon et al., 2015). Policy actors from economic government sectors are also highly interested in nutrition policy reforms. In developing countries, for instance, most governments have prioritized economic growth often by encouraging foreign direct investments, which results in the proliferation of industries for unhealthy commodities like food and alcohol (Schram et al., 2015; Baker et al., 2016; Friel and Jamieson, 2019).\nZambia requires nutrition policy reforms where, among others, effective legislative policy options for addressing food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition will be prioritized. This study aimed to examine stakeholder perspectives on how nutrition policy in Zambia can be strengthened, with a particular focus on assessing the feasibility of developing and implementing nutrition policy options that address food environment drivers for the double burden of malnutrition among adolescents in Zambia. In so doing, we aim to identify the existing barriers and facilitators to policy change, which can inform advocacy efforts targeting."

According to the multiple streams theory, policy change depends on factors in three parallel \u2018streams\u2019: the problem stream, which considers how stakeholders understand problems and their solutions; the policy solutions stream, which considers solutions proposed by actors; and the politics stream, which considers the contextual factors including interests and influence of different policy actors. The policy change has been shown to occur when the three streams converge, usually in response to an open window of opportunity. Focusing events that facilitate the coupling of the streams, such as changes in political office or the presence of policy champions or entrepreneurs, are essential to opening windows of opportunity.\nThe multiple streams theory has been widely used to \u2018retrospectively\u2019 understand why some policy issues get on the government\u2019s policy agenda while others do not (B\u00e9land and Howlett, 2016).

The first section was structured to collect information on how stakeholders perceive nutrition problems and the solutions required, corresponding to the problem and policy solution streams. In the second section, we aimed to understand the feasibility of policy options by exploring, facilitating and inhibiting factors and the power and influence of policy actors, corresponding to the politics stream of the multiple streams theory. We further included questions to explore what would be required to develop and implement two policy options recommended for healthy food environments: regulating the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children and healthy food provisioning in schools. These two policy options were chosen based on our previous research on Zambia\u2019s adolescent nutrition policy environment (Mukanu et al., 2020) and global recommendations (WHO, 2017). Key findings from these studies showed that poor dietary habits among school-going adolescents were attributed to the wide availability of unhealthy food in and around schools and indiscriminate marketing of these food types to vulnerable groups like children and adolescents. The interview guide was piloted with three stakeholders from the health and education sectors before data collection.\nWe used purposive sampling to identify and recruit relevant stakeholders to participate. Respondents were identified through networks developed by the authors from previous nutrition-related research in Zambia (Mukanu et al., 2020). We used experience from previous studies to identify respondents, and snowballing was used to identify additional\nrespondents. Potential participants were invited to participate via phone calls or email. An official letter requesting permission to interview the relevant staff experienced in nutrition policymaking was written for government institutions. Interviews were conducted virtually and in person by the lead author. Data were collected between March and July 2022. Interviews took an average of 40 minutes and were recorded with consent from the participants.\nAn initial 30 respondents were identified and invited to participate in the study. Of these, 25 responded, and 13 were interviewed in the first round of data collection. Seven additional stakeholders were identified through snowballing during the first round of interviews; four agreed to be interviewed in the second round. After the two rounds of interviews, the range of respondents reflected critical perspectives regarding Zambia\u2019s food environment nutrition policy, indicating theoretical saturation. The 17 respondents interviewed were drawn from government and related agencies (n = 7), civil society (n = 3), multilateral organizations (n = 4), academia (n = 1) and industry (n = 1), as shown in Table 1.

We used thematic analysis to systematically organize and identify patterns of meaning (themes) across the dataset to generate new knowledge (Braun and Clarke, 2012).\nThe first step of the analysis involved broad deductive coding of data from stakeholder interviews and documents to three predetermined codes: problem, policy and politics derived from the multiple streams theory. The coding was followed by further subanalysis of the data under each stream to inductively derive subthemes and patterns. Under the problem stream, we applied a framing analysis to documentary and interview data to examine the \u2018frames\u2019 used by stakeholders to make meaning of nutrition problems. This is important in prospective policy research as the frames chosen by policy actors to problematize an issue often determine the attention it receives, the actions chosen to address it and who is seen as responsible for acting (Shiffman, 2009; McIntyre, 2020). Data coded to the policy solutions stream was further analysed to identify perceived policy solutions and facilitators and barriers to developing and implementing the policy options for fostering healthy food environments. Under the politics stream, data were analysed to identify policy actors\u2019 perceived power and influence over nutrition policy development and implementation.

The findings are categorized according to the three domains of the multiple streams theory (Kingdon, 1984), the overarching framework applied in the study. Under the problem stream, nutrition problems in adolescents were not perceived as a priority. However, there was a general acknowledgement that this age group requires to be prioritized. Under the policy solutions stream, regulating the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children as a policy option was perceived as not for the Zambian context. In contrast, healthy food provisioning in schools was perceived as feasible. Under the political stream, manufacturing companies were perceived as having strong influence and interest in challenging legislative policy reforms.\nProblem stream: evidence and perceptions of the policy problem Nutrition is a recognized policy problem The perception of nutrition as an important national policy issue is an opportunity for nutrition policy reforms. From documentary data, poor nutrition in the vulnerable age groups was linked to negative long-term consequences such as poor cognitive development due to childhood stunting and increased risk of obesity and its related chronic conditions\n(National Food and Nutrition Commission, 2018), while the \u2018well-nourished and healthy population\u2019 were identified as critical to national economic development (Republic of Zambia, 2006). Furthermore, women, children and, to a certain extent, adolescents were perceived as key populations vulnerable to nutrition-related problems (Ministry of Finance and National Planning, 2022).\nThere is limited prioritization of adolescents in nutrition policy Some stakeholders acknowledged the need to address adolescents in nutrition programming better as they are a critical age group (Gov-Hea-1, Gov-Ed-1, CSO-1, UN-1, UN-2 and Bil-2). Stakeholders noted that adolescents needed to be protected to ensure they develop good nutrition habits that would prevent the development of chronic conditions in adult life (Gov-Hea-2 and Gov-Ed-1). While some stakeholders highlighted that the government was using a life-course approach to address nutrition (Acad-1), policy documents showed that the focus of nutrition programming and policies was on women of reproductive age and children under 2 years and did not explicitly include adolescents despite being identified as vulnerable to nutrition problems in other government policy documents (National Food and Nutrition Commission, 2018). Stakeholders also noted a dearth of \u2018formal\u2019 evidence on the nutrition status of adolescents. This lack of evidence rendered adolescents invisible and not part of the high risk group to be prioritized for nutrition policy investments (UN2). Data were only available on nutrition-related outcomes like the prevalence of anaemia and body mass index among adolescent girls targeted because of the high risk for pregnancy. Anecdotally, stakeholders noted that presently undernutrition was more of a problem in rural adolescents, while obesity was rising, especially among urban adolescents. This rise in obesity was associated with increased consumption of processed foods high in sugar, fats and salt (Gov-Cdev-1, Govt-Lgov-1 and Acad-1).\nThere is a concern but a lack of clarity regarding adolescent nutrition Identifying food environment factors as influencers of adolescents\u2019 dietary choices by stakeholders and in policy documents is an opportunity to introduce policy options that address food environment drivers. Stakeholders noted that the availability of junk food around schools, prevalent advertisements of junk food usually combined with false claims about the nutritional value of food and attractiveness and convenience of acquiring and consuming fast foods made unhealthy a popular choice among adolescents. There was a need to urgently address this in Zambia (CSO-1, CSO-2, UN-2, Acad1, Gov-Lgov-1 and Bil-1). However, the entrenched beliefs on the drivers of adolescent nutrition problems might present barriers to policy reform. Nutrition problems in documentary data were framed as arising due to \u2018lifestyle choices\u2019 and \u2018risky behaviour\u2019 or \u2018personal preferences\u2019 (Ministry of Health, 2013; Ministry of Youth, Sport and Child Development, 2015). Some stakeholders also perceived that the lack of information on what healthy eating consists of or the consequences of unhealthy eating were the biggest drivers of poor nutrition choices (Gov-Cdev-1, Bil-2 and Gov-Hea-1). This framing of nutrition problems might limit the extent to which food environment policy solutions are considered.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /heapol/article/38/8/895/7224618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nTable 2.

So, you really need to take into consideration of all these things so you need to balance as well\u2019 (Govt-Cdev-1) \u2018School children are the biggest market for snacks and sugary drinks, so anything to do with any issue that will brings down their profit they will oppose\u2019(Govt-Hea-1)\nFree market economy \u2018We need to be careful, the additional policies for school environment should not stifle the business environment remember we are in a free market economy\u2019 (Govt-com-1)\n\u2018This approach of regulations is difficult, we are a free market economy so it would be very difficult to draw the line at who can advertise and how they can advertise\u2019 (Govt-Cdev-1) \u2018In a liberal market system, everybody can sell something that has not been proven to be toxic so people engage in strategies to optimize their profits, celebrities are hired to increase coverage and acceptability by the general population, you can\u2019t stop that\u2019 (Acad-1)\nFraming of the problem using evidence\n\u2018We need to show that unhealthy dietary patterns in adolescents has big impact on the economy and health of the population, we should say that by intervening and providing a healthy food environment in schools, we are going to save not only the children\u2019s health but also the nation from having unnecessary expenditures\u2019 (Acad-1)\nPolicy/solutions stream: proposed policy solutions and barriers There was a clear preference for education-based policy approaches Perceptions about the causes of nutrition problems influenced perceptions about the feasibility of policy reforms. All the stakeholders acknowledged that additional policy measures are required to match the spectrum of nutrition problems in different population groups. However, because of the perception that a lack of knowledge caused poor nutrition habits, stakeholders proposed that education and information-based policy measures were required to raise awareness of the negative impacts of unhealthy diets and foster behaviour change in the entire population. Stakeholders proposed that government should lead efforts to foster behaviour change through public campaigns and the expansion of the nutrition component in the school curriculum. The Eat Well campaign implemented by the government through the National Food and Nutrition Commission (NFNC) with support from the World Food Programme was cited as an example of the government\u2019s efforts to educate the public (UN-1, Gov-Hea-1 and Acad-1). The campaign uses local celebrities to promote healthy diets on the radio and social media. The availability of national\nfood-based dietary guidelines would further guide the content of the educational interventions (Gov-Agric-1 and Acad-1).\nFirst, we need to start with education, as I have said. We need to sensitize our communities to the health benefits of some of these foods. Without that knowledge, it becomes challenging. I can have a lot of money, but if I do not know what is healthy for me is probably there on the market, I might buy a very sugary drink when I am supposed to be getting a fruit. So, sensitization is very key. (Gov-Agric-1)\nLegislative policy options that are effective for addressing food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition were generally perceived as challenging to develop and implement and not yet feasible for Zambia (CSO-2, GovCdev and Acad-1). Few stakeholders noted that policy options like taxation on unhealthy foods are helpful in improving the quality of food environments. Stakeholders noted that the country lacks the technology, capacity and resources to implement such policies (Gov-Com-1, Com-1, Gov-Lgov-1 and Gov-Cdev-1). Such perceptions might be rooted in the policy legacy of implementation of a similar legislation policy, such as the statutory instrument restricting the promotion\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /heapol/article/38/8/895/7224618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nof breastmilk supplements. Stakeholders noted that the government has struggled to enforce this law due to the lack of capacity. In addition, manufacturers have reportedly found loopholes in other supporting laws, such as the lack of advertising standards (Gov-Com and Gov-Hea-1). Stakeholders noted that legislative policy options also have the potential to infringe on persons\u2019 rights, which might make them unpopular to the public and policymakers. Concerning the rights of individuals, stakeholders felt individuals should retain the right to choose what food they want (Gov-Lgov-1). Protecting the rights of individuals as well as ensuring that vulnerable groups like women traders are not disempowered was seen as cardinal for securing public support for legislative policy measures.\nFeasibility of regulating the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children Despite acknowledging the influence of advertisements on adolescent food choices, the introduction of marketing regulations was perceived as not feasible for Zambia. The government currently has no regulation targeted at the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children. Perceived barriers to the introduction of this policy option include the difficulty of tailoring the policy to the different types of media such as radio and internet (Bil-1), lack of government capacity and resources for enforcement (Govt-Lgov-1 and Govt-Hea-2) and negative impact on small businesses (Govt-Cdev-1).\nStakeholders identified some existing structures that could be leveraged to implement legislative nutrition policy options. Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Zambia Bureau of Standards were seen as government institutions that could be key in enforcing marketing regulations. It was proposed that Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, with its mandate to address misrepresentation by business owners, could help enforce regulation on false claims in advertisements. At the same time, the Zambia Bureau of Standards could develop food standards required to verify claims about food quality.\nFeasibility of healthy food provisioning in the school environment Restricting the availability of unhealthy food within the school environment was perceived by stakeholders as relatively feasible in the Zambian context. The NFNC, Ministry of Education, with support from the United Nations Children Emergency Fund, has plans to introduce nutrition-friendly schools in some pilot districts across the country (Gov-Hea-1 and Gov-Ed-1). The school environment was seen as easy to access and implement policies instead of targeting the general population. The Parent Teacher Committees were perceived as key stakeholders in the success of this policy option as they would garner the support required for implementation from stakeholders, including food vendors, learners and their guardians (Gov-Ed-1, Acad-1 and Gov-Com-1). The availability of national food-based guidelines and the school health and nutrition policy were also critical for facilitating the development of standards to guide the types of food that should be permitted in schools (Gov-Agric-1 and Gov-Hea-2). The local government stakeholders added that using their city planning mandate, they could restrict the issuing of trading licences\nto regulate the types of businesses that can operate within a particular radius around school premises, thus contributing to healthy environments. Additional policy options that would further support the affordability of healthy food, such as subsidies, were also called for (Acad-1).\nPolitics stream: influence and power of policy actors NFNC has the power to influence policy reform, but it needs to be further strengthened Stakeholders indicated that stronger coordination and policy networks among nutrition policy actors would be required for policy reforms. From documentary data, the NFNC is mandated to coordinate nutrition in Zambia (Government of the Republic of Zambia, 2019). All government stakeholders perceived this mandate as providing power influence to the NFNC to drive nutrition policy change. For instance, stakeholders from the health sector stated that the NFNC was powerful because they convene the committee of permanent nutrition secretaries, an essential decision-making body for nutrition in Zambia. Stakeholders added that the NFNC\u2019s influence is shown through its coordination of the Most Critical Days Program, which guides the scaling up of nutrition activities of different government sectors, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, education and community development. While government stakeholders were confident in the NFNC\u2019s coordination role, some nongovernmental stakeholders perceived that the NFNC being under the Ministry of Health made nutrition seem like a problem of the health sector and weakened the commission\u2019s influence over non-health sectors (Bil-1 and UN-1). These stakeholders proposed that the NFNC sitting under a \u2018neutral\u2019 organ of the government like the Office of the Vice President would be a better alternative. They added that the lack of an enforcement wing in the NFNC weakens the commission\u2019s power to influence the implementation of policies.\nManufacturing companies likely to block policy reforms All the stakeholders perceived manufacturing companies as having high interest and strong influence over nutrition policymaking in Zambia. The power of the manufacturing industry to influence the government\u2019s policy agenda was primarily linked to the financial support that big manufacturers render to government ministries under the guise of corporate social responsibility (UN-2) and the free market economic system, which was perceived to favour the business interests of companies (Acad-1, Gov-Lgov-1 and Com-1). Stakeholders from the industry further added that the affiliation of manufacturers, represented by the Zambia Association of Manufacturers with the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry, was a valuable network for pushing back on policies that negatively impact manufacturers. Stakeholders from the health sector seemed resigned to the fact that manufacturers would always oppose and find a way around policies that interfere with profits, such as restricting the marketing or taxation of unhealthy food. However, other stakeholders saw this interest as an opportunity for the government to proactively engage with manufacturers and incentivize their adoption of policy reforms by reducing their business costs (Gov-Cdev-1, GovLgov-1 and Gov-Agric-1). For instance, small business owners\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /heapol/article/38/8/895/7224618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\noperating in the school food environment could be incentivized to provide healthy food options like fresh fruits by giving access to loan facilities that will help procure refrigeration equipment required to prolong the shelf life of perishable fruits (Gov-Agric-1). Some stakeholders added that the uptake of existing initiatives like the good food logo, a voluntary front-of-pack label spearheaded by the NFNC and Scaling Up Nutrition Business Network would be increased if it was coupled with an incentive like tax exemption on importation of equipment or ingredients required for the reformulation of unhealthy food (Man-1 and Gov-Com-1).\nPublic support is required for policy reforms but currently lacking Stakeholders perceived that generating strong public support is critical for nutrition policy reforms in Zambia. Stakeholders felt that the public and policymakers could not relate to adolescent nutrition problems as evidence showing the burden or impact of diet-related problems like obesity in this age group is lacking (CSO-3, Acad-1 and UN-1). Some stakeholders proposed educating the general population on the causes of poor nutrition to appreciate and support legislative policy measures (Gov-Hea-1, Gov-Cdev-1 and Bil-2). All stakeholders perceived civil society organizations as having great potential to influence public demand for nutrition policy reforms in Zambia because of the ability to mobilize public support through advocacy activities. Civil society organizations can help tailor the framing of nutrition problems to show both short-term and long-term impacts on health and the economy so that everyone, including the government, the private sector, and the general public, can begin to realize how big of an issue poor nutrition is (Acad-1 and CSO-2).\nIn our efforts as researchers and civil society, we want to show that eating very badly in adolescents has a big impact on the economy and a big impact on the health of the population. If that is the case, then you could say that by intervening and providing a healthy food environment in schools, we are going to save not only the children\u2019s health but also the nation from having unnecessary bills that are coming.

            "text": "This study examined the feasibility of introducing nutrition policy options that address the double burden of malnutrition among adolescents to identify barriers and facilitators to such policy reforms. Of the two focus policies, healthy food provisioning in schools was perceived as feasible, while regulating unhealthy food marketing to children was seen as not feasible. Based on the multiple streams theory, we categorized the barriers and facilitators into those related to the problem stream (perception of the problem), policy stream (existing and proposed policy solutions) and politics stream (political and institutional contexts). The study indicated that leveraging the life-course approach in nutrition programming where women and children are currently prioritized could facilitate policy reforms as the adolescence period is also among the critical intervention points in a person\u2019s lifecycle. Another key facilitator of policy reform was the availability of institutional infrastructure that could be leveraged to deliver adolescent-focused policies. However, the lack of evidence\non the burden and long-term impacts of adolescent nutrition problems was identified as a potential barrier. Although nutrition is a priority for the Government of Zambia, the food industry\u2019s strong influence over the government\u2019s policy agenda setting, economic ideologies and lack of public awareness to demand better nutrition were perceived as key barriers to policy reforms.\nThe power and influence of policy actors are essential in brokering nutrition policy reforms (Knagg\u00e5rd, 2015; Cullerton et al., 2017). This study identified industry, the NFNC and civil society working through the public as the three main policy actors (potentially) influential in nutrition policy reforms in Zambia. Food manufacturers were perceived to have the most power to block more effective nutrition policies that they framed as \u2018unfavourable\u2019 for their business interests. The literature has numerous examples of tactics used by the food industry to steer the policy process in their favour (Dorfman et al., 2012; Ronit and Jensen, 2014; Mialon et al., 2015; Nixon et al., 2015; Freudenberg, 2018). A key tactic used by industry, especially in developing countries, is funding government programmes through public\u2013private partnerships (Mialon et al., 2015). In Zambia, the government relies on such partnerships to help finance programmes in the social sectors, including health (Ministry of Finance and National Planning, 2022). For instance, a food manufacturer\u2013 affiliated foundation provided 28 million kwacha (approximately USD1.4 million) to the Ministry of Health to support the fight against Covid-19 (Chanda, 2020). This food manufacturer financing the foundation is among the producers of sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed corn snacks. Partnerships between a government- and private-sector entity that produces health-harming commodities are discouraged as they present an inherent conflict of interest on the side of the government, which might weaken their ability to exercise their regulatory functions (Parker et al., 2019). Similarly, healthsector respondents in this study felt that the government receiving support from big players in the food manufacturing industry is a serious conflict of interest. Through such large donations and other corporate social responsibility activities, the food industry in Zambia has bought its seat at the nutrition policy table, making the introduction and implementation of effective policy options like regulating marketing very unlikely.\nInformation-based policy solutions were perceived as very feasible for the Zambian context. This could be because most respondents framed unhealthy dietary patterns as resulting from a lack of knowledge, especially in adolescents. The choice of frames used for nutrition problems can influence policy reforms as it determines the support the problem receives from stakeholders and solutions proposed to address it, determining whether these problems get prioritized on the policy agenda (Jenkin et al., 2011). Globally, information-based nutrition policy interventions are popular owing to their relative ease of implementation and lack of contention from policy actors like the food industry (Gorski and Roberto, 2015). Frames in nutrition health promotion messaging often allude to individual responsibility for healthy eating (Orste et al., 2021). The individual-centric framing can, however, be a barrier to policy reform as it perpetuates the idea that diet-related problems are driven by poor lifestyle choices and should be addressed by the health sector, negating the role of other determinants. Incorporating frames that include food environment drivers of nutrition problems\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /heapol/article/38/8/895/7224618 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nin information-based interventions might help build public awareness, increasing demand for healthy food and fostering behaviour change. Public awareness campaigns coupled with strong advocacy by civil society can transform the public into powerful actors who, in some settings, were instrumental in passing effective nutrition policies like sugar taxes (Lee, 2010; Busse et al., 2020). The weak advocacy and lack of public pressure remain the barriers to more effective policies to address the nutrition problem in Zambia.\nThis study shows that perceptions about free market systems strongly determined what policy solutions were perceived as feasible for the Zambian context by respondents. Legislative policy options such as restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children and taxation of unhealthy commodities were perceived as not feasible and difficult to implement because respondents felt such policies might infringe upon the liberties of businesses in a free market system. This perspective inhibits policy reforms as it entrenches the alternative narrative that behavioural factors are the key drivers of nutrition problems and relegates the role of the government to that of educating the population. Neoliberal political ideologies have been shown to facilitate diet-related nutrition problems (Glasgow and Schrecker, 2016). The main pathways include providing a conducive environment for the unhealthy food industry expansion (Lee and Crosbie, 2019; Lencucha and Thow, 2019) and limiting the policy space for governments to undertake their regulatory functions (Tienhaara, 2010; Kelsey, 2017).\nThe lack of prioritization of adolescents in nutrition policies was linked with a lack of evidence on the burden and impact of nutrition problems in this age group. It indicates that respondents in this study might hold a simplistic view of policy reform as occurring in a rational system where the availability of evidence is enough to result in policy reform (Walt, 1994). However, this might not be the case, as previous research found that policy networks and advocacy coalitions strongly influence nutrition policy reforms in Zambia. For instance, despite the availability of evidence on the potential public impact of a sugar tax on the Zambian population (Hangoma et al., 2020), strong opposition from industryand economic-sector policy networks was a barrier during the agenda-setting process, and the evidence-informed recommended rate was not adopted (Mukanu et al., 2020). Harris (2019) also found that advocacy coalitions and health-sector policy networks helped transfer the global prioritization of stunting into Zambia\u2019s policy agenda.\nGuided by the multiple streams theory, this study identified factors within the problem, policy and political streams that can facilitate or impede nutrition policy reforms for addressing food environment drivers of the double burden of malnutrition in adolescents. Fostering nutrition policy reforms will require addressing the barriers in each stream so that once a window of opportunity opens, there will be a higher chance of the stream\u2019s coupling resulting in policy reform. It also calls for a realignment of the existing ideology among policymakers that generating evidence on nutrition problems will be enough to bring about changes, as strong political factors need to be accounted for. Policy entrepreneurs and advocacy coalitions will be vital in overcoming the barriers and leveraging the opportunities identified in this study. Policy entrepreneurs, \u2018the powerful political and social actors\u2019 (B\u00e9land and Katapally, 2018), will be required to help reframe the dominant narrative of nutrition problems and promote policy solutions\nthat are suited for the economic and social context and that leverage the existing institutions in Zambia. In the past, political figures in Zambia have contributed to public health policy reforms such as banning smoking in public places. However, the influence and power of political champions are tied to their political office. The influence might not be sustained after the change of political regimes, as has been the case with an antismoking campaign, which is no longer enforced in Zambia. Therefore, advocacy coalitions\u2014the collection of people from different institutions with similar beliefs and aspirations about a policy issue who work overtime to influence policymakers to achieve their aspirations (Sabatier, 1988)\u2014will be required for sustained support for developing and implementing policy reforms. Evidence shows that the activities of the advocacy coalition for stunting within the nutrition policy subsystem in Zambia have, over time, contributed to the prioritization and implementation of interventions for reducing stunting (Harris, 2019). Policy entrepreneurs and advocacy coalitions can also use the policy packaging approach to change stakeholder perceptions about the feasibility of more effective policy options for the double burden of malnutrition. Policy packaging is an approach where a combination of policy measures is used to offset the potential conflict between political feasibility and problem-solving effectiveness, which often arises for contested issues like nutrition policies (Fesenfeld et al., 2020). In the case of Zambia, legislative and regulatory policy options like taxations unhealthy food could be bundled with a social protection policy such as the provision of healthy school meals, which is driven by the revenue from the taxes. Earmarking revenues from \u2018sin\u2019 taxes for health promotion interventions improved public support during the policy development processes for sugar-sweetened beverage tax in South Africa (Bosire et al., 2020) and the Pacific countries (Thow et al., 2011).\nA strength of the current study is the good representation of stakeholders from key sectors involved in nutrition policymaking in Zambia, meaning that the different perspectives important in considering Zambia\u2019s food environment policies were captured. The documentary and interview data triangulation also comprehensively understood the problem. One limitation of our findings is that the stakeholders interviewed provided perspectives based on their experiences, and it is unclear how representative these perspectives are of the sectors they represented."

While legislative policies were deemed not feasible, identifying existing infrastructure that can be leveraged to enforce nutrition policy regulation is a bright spot as it implies recognition of intersectoral linkages in nutrition.
