    "abstractText": "Ultrasounds are already broadly exploited in clinical diagnostics and are now becoming a powerful and not harmful tool in antitumoral therapies, as they are able to produce damages towards cancer cells, thank to inertial cavitation and temperature increase. The use of US alone or combined to molecular compounds, microbubbles or solid-state nanoparticles is the focus of current research and clinical trials, like thermoablation, drug sonoporation or sonodynamic therapies. In the present work, we discuss on the non-thermal effects of ultrasound and the conditions which enable oxygen radical production and which role they can have in provoking the death of different cancer cell lines. In this perspective, we set a mathematical model to predict the pressure spatial distribution in a defined water sample volume and thus obtain a map of acoustic pressures and acoustic intensities of the applied ultrasound at different input powers. We then validate and verify these numerical results with direct acoustic measurements and by detecting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by means of sonochemiluminescence (SCL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, applied to the same water sample volume and using the same US input parameters adopted in the simulation. Finally, the various US conditions are applied to two different set of cancer cell lines, a cervical adenocarcinoma and a hematological cancer, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma. We hypothesize how the ROS generation can influence the recorded cell death. In a second set of experiments, the role of semiconductor metal oxide nanocrystals, i.e. zinc oxide, is also evaluated by adding them to the water and biological systems. In particular, the role of ZnO in enhancing the ROS production is verified. Furthermore, the interplay among US and ZnO nanocrystals is evaluated in provoking cancer cell death at specific conditions. This study demonstrates a useful correlation between numerical simulation and experimental acoustic validation as well as with ROS measurement at both qualitative and quantitative levels during US irradiation of simple water solution. It further tries to translate the obtained results to justify one of the possible mechanisms responsible of cancer cell death. It thus aims to pave the way for the use of US in cancer therapy and a better understanding on the non-thermal effect that a specific set of US parameters can have on cancer cells cultured in vitro.",

            "text": "Ultrasound (US) is a mechanical pressure wave propagating longitudinally in a continuous medium and characterized by frequencies higher than the upper audible limit\n(approximately 20\u00a0kHz) (Shibagichi et\u00a0al. 2011). It is usually generated by an ultrasonic transducer, typically made of piezoelectric material, which is excited at the proper frequency by a generator and it is able to transform electric signal into mechanical displacement (Canavese et\u00a0al. 2018). Transmission of ultrasound wave in fluids can lead to thermal effects, mainly an increase in temperature, but also to non-thermal ones, which can be considered a complex set of processes, including microstreaming, radiation forces and acoustic cavitation (Canavese et\u00a0al. 2018). Acoustic cavitation is a phenomenon that involves formation and growth of gas bubbles (Shibagichi et\u00a0al. 2011), caused by the time-varying sinusoidal pressure cycles Giulia Tamboia, Michele Campanini and Veronica Vighetto contributed equally to this work. * Valentina Cauda valentina.cauda@polito.it 1 Department of\u00a0Applied Science and\u00a0Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129\u00a0Turin, Italy\n1 3\napplied to the liquid, corresponding to expansion and contraction phases. Two possible conditions can be distinguished: stable cavitation, which is characterized by permanent bubbles that oscillate for many cycles of pressure variation, and transient or inertial cavitation. In this last condition, the gas bubbles expand enormously with respect to their original size and then violently collapse releasing a large amount of energy (Neppiras\u00a01980). During such collapse, very high temperatures (above 5000\u00a0K) and pressures (above 800\u00a0atm) are generated locally causing the ionization of gas, microjet streaming, and thermal dissociation of water molecules into hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b7) and hydrogen atoms (H\u00b7), the cleavage of dissolved oxygen, O2, leading to the formation of several reactive oxygen species (ROS) (McMurray and Wilson\u00a01999). If inertial cavitation happens in a biological environment, the result, depending on the amount of generated ROS, can lead to a highly oxidative stress environment, that is fatal for cells, including cancer ones (Shibagichi et\u00a0al. 2011). Within the different radicals, the hydroxyl one is considered one of the strongest, due to its highest reduction potential and its capability to react with several biomolecules (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2019). It is therefore highly desired to effectively apply US inducing the ROS generation, specifically towards cancer cells, with the final aim to maximize their death and achieve an efficient cancer therapy. The sonodynamic therapy has indeed the above-mentioned aim and is typically assisted by organic molecules, called sonosensitizers, allowing to maximize the effect of US (Shibagichi et\u00a0al. 2011; Canavese et\u00a0al. 2018). Although already used in some clinical asset to treat cancer, molecular sonosensitizers are typically hydrophobic molecules and non-specific to cancer tissues.\nThe recent advancement in research has proposed the use of various types of nanoparticles, which can be better dispersed in water-based media and can be efficiently targeted to cancer cells (Racca and Cauda\u00a02020). The mechanism of interaction among ultrasound and organic or inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) in water solution exposed to such acoustic irradiation can lead to different effects. Depending on their nature, NPs of organic polydopamine or inorganic one like cerium oxide can scavenge the produced ROS from water, reducing the oxidative stress (Carmignani et\u00a0al. 2022; Battaglini et\u00a0al. 2020). On the other hand, semiconductor nanoparticles like zinc oxide or titania (Matos et\u00a0al. 2020) can support the ROS generation, typically lowering the inertial cavitation threshold. In particular, it is supposed that their surface roughness and porosity, as well as the presence of organic functional groups imparting a hydrophobic milieu to their surface, can immobilize nanosized gas bubbles and provide nucleation sites for their cavitation (Ancona et\u00a0al. 2020; Lops et\u00a0al. 2019). Furthermore, the emission of photon in the\nultraviolet\u2013visible region during inertial cavitation is supposed to photoexcite large band gap semiconductor NPs, such as ZnO and TiO2 (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2022). This light excitation produces an electron\u2013hole separation in their band structure and both electrons and holes can react with oxygen and water molecules adsorbed at the semiconductor surface, transforming them in free radicals.\nSeveral groups have applied different types of NPs as sonosensitizer or, more in general, as acoustically-activated nanomaterials under ultrasound stimulation at low intensity, towards a therapy called sonodynamic (SDT) (Racca and Cauda\u00a02020; Canaparo et\u00a0al. 2020). The use of SDT with solid-state NPs is still under study, due to the poor comprehension of the mechanisms under which NPs and ultrasound synergistically cooperate to induce cell death or spare healthy tissues and to possible side effect on the NPs use. The possible mechanisms of cell death induced by ultrasound and in particular by NP-assisted ultrasound are manifold and depends on the US figures of merit and on the type and nature of the nanomaterial used (Racca and Cauda\u00a02020). Very generally, both thermal and non-thermal effects of US can induce toxicity and even death on the cancer cell. The presence of NPs can then increase temperature and ROS production, while the sonoluminescence can activate NPs to produce radicals and other toxic species. Furthermore, NPs motion in the US field can create mechanical injury to cells, and also ion release should be considered, as well as electric or even piezoelectric stimulations with consequent nanomaterial polarization and cell charge imbalance (Racca and Cauda\u00a02020).\nIn the present study, we aim to advance the knowledge about low-intensity ultrasound triggering ROS production and non-thermal effects, simplifying the problem to a cylindrical water volume contained in a well. In particular, we hypothesize that it is possible to simulate the acoustic field in a well-defined and controlled set-up and validate such model with direct acoustic measurements and with the detection of indirect effects, like the production of ROS induced by inertial cavitation.\nWe first simulated the acoustic field of the water to properly estimate the US field intensity and pressure across the water solution, with spatial resolution throughout the sample volume. For this purpose, simulations were implemented in COMSOL\u00ae Multiphysics, as previously reported in the literature (Hasnul Hadi et\u00a0al. 2019) and by some of us (Spigarelli et\u00a0al. 2020).\nSecondly, we carried out experimental\u00a0studies to validate the numerical simulations, directly measuring the acoustic pressure inside the sample well, and we detected through\u00a0sonochemiluminescence\u00a0(SCL) (Tiong et\u00a0al. 2017) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy the production of ROS in water solution at the previously simulated conditions. Clearly, the simulation set-up was\n1 3\nmaintained as much close as possible to the experimental one, so that a clear comparison can be made. Previous studies were reported in the literature trying to compare the simulated pressure field with experimental data obtained from US transducers in a low frequency range. More in details, these works proposed to compare either the simulated pressure field with acoustic pressure measurements (Wei and Weavers\u00a02016; Fontana et\u00a0al. 2021) or with indirect effect caused by US, like the SCL emission (Hasnul Hadi et\u00a0al. 2019).\nIn the present paper, the obtained simulation and experimental measurements of acoustic pressure and ROS were then combined with biological data, i.e. the measurement of cell viability of two different cancer cell lines, treated with the same ultrasound irradiation parameters. In particular, a cervical adenocarcinoma (KB cell line) and a Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (Daudi cell line) were used to investigate the effect of US on two different biological cell systems and more in details to verify the cytotoxic role of the generated ROS under the application of\u00a0specific US parameters.\nAs previously reported (Alassaf et\u00a0al. 2013; Leskinen and Hynynen 2012; Snehota et\u00a0al. 2020), the US exposure of an in vitro cell culture system has many parameters which have to be controlled in order to render the experiments reproducible and also comparable to other literature results. For example, US can be easily altered by varying the coupling medium, the cell culture vessel and medium, as well as by sample rotation, movement, and reflection of US from the vessel wall. In our study, we have maintained the same experimental conditions applied in the above-mentioned acoustic measurement and ROS generation experiments, as well as used in the simulation set-up. In this way, we assume it should be possible to compare the data obtained from these different experiments and drive uniform conclusions.\nTo further advance the knowledge in the field of nanomedicine, semiconductor zinc oxide nanocrystals (ZnO NCs) stabilized with amino-propyl functional groups were considered in the presented system, in view also of the previous literature results (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2019, 2022; Ancona et\u00a0al. 2020; Racca et\u00a0al. 2020; Garino et\u00a0al. 2019). A possible enhancement in ROS production was evaluated from these NCs in combination with US at various power densities and treatment times. Furthermore, ZnO-NH2 NCs were also administered to cell in a sub-toxic concentration, in order to investigate their possible synergistic effects related cell death.\nThe proposed evaluations aim thus to shed light on the effect of ultrasound in a living system in vitro and increase the level of knowledge on the different key parameters to help the advancement in the field of physical therapies and nanotherapeutics against cancer."

            "text": "The acoustic field was induced in 2\u00a0mL of a water solution contained in a well and simulated with COMSOL\u00ae Multiphysics (version 5.5, COMSOL Inc.), using the Pressure Acoustic Frequency domain interface. By means of this interface, the linearly approximated form of the acoustic wave equation for a time-harmonic pressure wave was solved for the specific frequency (f) of 1\u00a0MHz, the same applied with the transducer in the experiments.\nAs done in previous works (Spigarelli et\u00a0al. 2020; Tiong et\u00a0al. 2017; Lei et\u00a0al. 2013), some assumptions were implemented: (1) all the\u00a0thermoviscous\u00a0effects were neglected: the simulated system was adiabatic, with an equilibrium temperature equal to the standard ambient one (298.15 \u00b0K); (2) the fluid (water) was homogeneous, isotropic, in quiescence and unperturbed from any background pressure field; (3) the US wave propagated linearly through the fluid; (4) the presence and the generation of cavitation bubbles in the fluid was not simulated; (5) the system was simulated by using the COMSOL\u00ae Viscous Fluid model.\nTherefore, the acoustic wave equation solved by the software for the acoustic pressure field p had the following form (Eq.\u00a01) (Lei et\u00a0al. 2013):\nwhere keq = cc is the wave number, equal to the ratio between the wave angular frequency \u2375 = 2\u03c0f and the complex speed of sound in water cc = c(1 + i c2 ) 0.5\n, whose real part is represented by c = 1497\u00a0m/s (Snehota et\u00a0al. 2020), while the imaginary part, which takes into account the damping of the US wave due to viscous losses, contains the sound diffusivity = 1 ( 4\n3 + b) , where is the water density, \u03bc is the\nwater dynamic viscosity and \u03bcb is the water bulk viscosity. Then, c = c2\nc2 c is the complex water density, qd and Qm are the dipole and the monopole domain source respectively, both of them set to 0 since no kind of source was assumed to be present inside the system, and p is the acoustic pressure, computed by the software at each point of the domain.\nSince only the fluidic domain was included in the simulations, the polystyrene walls of the well were modeled by implementing at the lateral surface of the domain the Impedance boundary condition (Comsol\u00a02020) (Eq.\u00a02), where the value of the polystyrene acoustic impedance ( Zps = ps \u22c5 cps) was set in the right-hand side of the equation; the same kind of boundary condition, this time using the air acoustic impedance ( Zair = air \u22c5 cair) , was imposed at the domain top surface (Eq.\u00a03), in order to model the contact of the upper surface of\n(1)\u2207 \u22c5 ( \u2212 1\nc (\u2207p \u2212 qd)\n) \u2212 k2 eq p\nc = Qm\n1 3\nthe solution with the air. The sinusoidal displacement generated by the oscillating US transducer at the bottom basis of the fluid was modeled by adding the Normal Displacement boundary condition (Comsol\u00a02020) (Eq.\u00a04) at the domain bottom surface: the displacement amplitude (LD), inserted on the right-hand side of the equation, was determined from the intensity value of the incident wave to the system ( I0 ), defined according to Eq.\u00a05 (The Acoustic Bubble\u00a0n.d.). This value was calculated by considering the exponential reduction of the US intensity caused by the wave propagation from the transducer (generating its acoustic intensity Iinput) through the 1.3\u00a0mm thick polystyrene basis (t) of the well, characterized by its attenuation coefficient \u03b1 (Eq.\u00a06) (The Acoustic Bubble\u00a0n.d.), considered at 298.15\u00a0K and US frequency of 1\u00a0MHz.\nwhere n is the outward normal vector to the domain surface. The domain was discretized with the COMSOL model of Mapped quadrilateral mesh in the boundaries, which was reproduced even at each point of the bulk by applying\n(2)\u2212n \u22c5 ( \u2212 1\nc\n( \u2207p \u2212 qd )\n)\n= \u2212 pi\nZps on the lateral surface,\n(3)\u2212n \u22c5 ( \u2212 1\nc\n( \u2207p \u2212 qd )\n)\n= \u2212 pi\nZair on the top surface,\n(4) \u2212n \u22c5\n(\n\u2212 1\nc\n( \u2207p \u2212 qd )\n)\n= (i )2LD on the bottom surface,\n(5)I0 = 1\u22152 c 2LD2 \u2192 LD =\n\u221a\n2I0\nc 2\n(6)I0 = Iinpute\u22122 t\nthe Swept discretization method. The maximum mesh element size was imposed equal to 1/8 of the wavelength of the applied US, and the minimum one to 1/10, since 8\u201310 mesh elements within the wavelength are enough to simulate acoustic fields (Lei et\u00a0al. 2013), providing a sufficiently accurate solution of the acoustic wave equation.\nThe simulation parameters whose values have not already been expressed are listed in Table\u00a01 and the geometrical features of the well containing the water volume as well as the position of the US transducer are depicted in Fig.\u00a01."

(1999),\u00a0SCL is the emission of blue light (\u03bb = 430\u00a0nm) by Luminol molecules in an alkaline solution caused by their interaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH\u00b7), generated by acoustic cavitation. This oxidative chemiluminescence of Luminol develops through a complex reaction pathway of the molecule, which undergoes many intermediate reaction steps before emitting the blue light. For a given concentration of luminol\u00a0molecules in the solution, the light intensity emitted (and then detected) by SCL, denoted as ISCL , is proportional to the amount of cavitation-generated hydroxyl radicals in water.\nTo ensure a proper activation of the SCL process, a solution composed of 80\u00a0mM luminol (97% by Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1\u00a0M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.5\u00a0mM hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 , from a stock solution of 0.02\u00a0M) in a total volume of 2\u00a0mL of bd water was placed in a well of the 24\u00a0well plate.

The prepared solutions were treated within 4\u00a0h from their preparation.\nThe SCL intensity emitted by each solution during the sonication was detected by using a Nikon D80 digital camera, set with ISO = 1250, f-stop = f/4 and with an exposure time that, for the shorter sonication times (as 5\u00a0s, 10\u00a0s, 15\u00a0s) is at least of 30\u00a0s, while, for the longer sonication times (as 30\u00a0s, 1\u00a0min, 2\u00a0min), it is set equal to the sonication time.

After the experiments, the obtained images were\u00a0analyzed\u00a0and processed with the open-source software\u00a0ImageJ: firstly, the background was subtracted to the acquired images in a pixel-by-pixel approach; then, the area of the images showing blue light pixels (Fig.\u00a02A) was selected as\u00a0Region Of Interest (ROI, Fig.\u00a02B) and spatial average blue intensity was calculated over all the intensity values of the pixels inside the ROI.

            "text": "The simulations allowed to model the acoustic pressure field and the acoustic density distribution inside the well due to the propagation of the US wave through the solution. In Fig.\u00a03 both entities are computed at Iinput = 0.45\u00a0W/ cm2 of the US transducer input density (i.e. acoustic density generated by the transducer), while other power densities are considered in the S.I.\nThe acoustic pressure field and the acoustic density distribution inside the well are visualized along three vertical planes (Y\u2013Z planes, Fig.\u00a03A and C), selected at x = 0 (well central section), x = 3.98\u00a0mm (half of the well basis radius along the X axis) and x = 7.9499 (0.0001\u00a0mm from the well wall along the X axis). These vertical planes allowed to study the US behaviour along the wave propagation direction (i.e. the vertical axis, Z) and when moving radially (X and Y axes). A second set of planes was selected\nhorizontally (X\u2013Y planes, Fig.\u00a03B and D), chosen at z = 0 (well bottom surface), z = 2.5\u00a0mm (one quarter of the well height), z = 7.5\u00a0mm (three quarters of the well height) and z = 10.7\u00a0mm (well top surface).\nThe acoustic pressure field on the vertical planes (Fig.\u00a03A) highlights the alternation of compression and rarefaction cycles along the Z axis, according to the propagation direction of US. This trend is sinusoidal, characterized by highly varying and pronounced peaks around the vertical central axis, in particular at the well center, and then tend to decrease and to assume a more regular and homogeneous shape when moving radially towards the walls. Also from the acoustic pressure field on the horizontal planes (Fig.\u00a03B), it can be observed that the peaks around the central vertical axis gradually decrease along the radial direction, following an oscillatory trend of symmetrical pressure phases. This behavior may be caused by the scattering of the propagating US wave inside the fluid and by its interaction (transmission and reflection phenomena) with the cylindrical lateral surfaces of polystyrene walls and with the air at the top surface, generating specific interference effects. In fact, Fig.\u00a03A demonstrates that the region around the central vertical axis appears to be subjected to strong constructive and destructive interference effects, originating diversified local maxima and minima pressure peaks which decrease along the radial direction. Moreover, it can be supposed that the particular axis-symmetric geometry of the well favors the formation of a symmetric and tapered focus along the central vertical axis, composed by the highest pressure amplitude values.\nFurther information about the behavior of the US field inside the well can be gained from the acoustic density distribution on the vertical (Fig.\u00a03C) and horizontal planes (Fig.\u00a03D): as previously noticed, a symmetric and tapered focus along the central vertical axis is clearly visible, showing the highest acoustic density values (at about 4.5\u00a0W/cm2) around the center of the well. From this region, the intensity slowly decreases moving towards the top and bottom surfaces, while it sharply reduces radially. Moreover, interference effects can be distinctly observed, represented by a pattern of concentric fringes, whose variations are strong around the vertical central axis and attenuate along the radial direction.\nThe same trends of the acoustic pressure field and the acoustic density distribution on the vertical and the horizontal planes were obtained also for Iinput equal to 0.60\u00a0W/ cm2 and 0.30\u00a0W/cm2 (reported in S.I. Figs.\u00a0S.1 and S.2), even if they were characterized by different values, as expected by the different US input powers densities used and thus of the different bottom wall displacements of the well.\nFinally, a comprehensive analysis was carried out by computing the average acoustic pressure amplitude and\n1 3\nacoustic density on each of the three vertical planes, for all the three US input power densities (0.3, 0.45 and 0.6\u00a0W/ cm2 in Table\u00a02). The obtained data show that for each US power density in input, both obtained acoustic pressure and density decrease along the radial direction, in agreement with the previous color maps of Fig.\u00a03. A higher reduction is achieved by approaching the well lateral surface. At the same time, for each vertical plane, the average acoustic pressure amplitude and acoustic intensity increase proportionally to the transducer power density, as expected. It is worth to note that the average acoustic density calculated in the central plane of the well is higher than the power density of the transducer. This local value provides the highest contribution to the average density over the whole domain, However, it is counterbalanced by the much lower acoustic densities calculated at the well boundaries. As a result, the average density over the whole solution volume is actually lower than the transducer input power one. This outcome\ncan be attributed both to the viscous losses of the fluid (which are taken into account in the used Viscous Fluid model) and to the acoustic pressure and density trends described above.\nFig. 3 Acoustic pressure field (top panels) and acoustic density distributions (bottom panels) within the well simulated with COMSOL\u00ae Multiphysics for Iinput = 0.45\u00a0 W/cm2, along vertical (A and C) and horizontal (B and D) planes of the sample well containing water. The darkest red and blue colors in panels A and B indicate the maximum\nand the minimum values, respectively, that the acoustic pressure can assume, equal to + 0.52\u00a0 MPa and\u20140.55\u00a0 MPa. The darkest blue and red colors of the acoustic density (panels C and D) correspond to 0\u00a0W/cm2 and 4.96\u00a0W/cm2, respectively\n1 3"

            "text": "With the aim to validate the acoustic pressure and density simulations with experimental data, the central average acoustic pressure was evaluated in the center of the 24-well at each US input power densities, as used for the mathematical simulations, by hydrophone measurements. The collected data are reported in the S.I, Fig.\u00a02.4 showing that the same values of acoustic pressure inside the well are achieved with both simulation and experimental tests, and thus perfectly validating the output results and the correctness of the used mathematical model.\nFurthermore, the ROS production was investigated in the well volume under US irradiation at the selected input conditions and measured through the SCL and EPR methods (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2019; Podbev\u0161ek et\u00a0al. 2022). Initially, the ROS measurements were conducted in pure water, as previously considered for the simulations, and afterwards the same US input power densities and times were applied to living cancer cells, i.e. KB and Daudi cell lines, both in suspension in their culture media. The effect of ROS in living cell is multifaced, due to their role in the cell signaling system (Fu et\u00a0al. 2014). An imbalance, i.e. an overproduction, of ROS levels in cells can result in the activation of apoptotic pathways, which in turns lead to cell deaths (D\u0105browski\u00a02017). On the other hand, the mechanical stress generated by acoustic cavitation (Mathias et\u00a0al. 1991), responsible for ROS production, and occurring close to cells membrane, can damage the integrity of the cell, being responsible for necrotic cell death. Therefore, it is very interesting to complete the above-reported simulation and the experimental ROS measurements with data of cell viability in the same US exposure conditions. On the other way round, the evaluation of cell viability can be a meaningful tool to indirectly assess the absence or the presence of abnormal ROS production in an US irradiated cell culture solution, further supporting the EPR and SCL measurements and the simulation results.\nIn a second set of experiments, the role played by ZnONH2 NCs dispersed in water was evaluated in terms of ROS generation and thus on the possible amplification of US effects. Ultimately, the analysis of the KB cancer cells viability after 24\u00a0h of incubation with NCs and consequent US treatment was examined, trying to propose a correlation among ROS generation and the cell viability, also depending on the presence of nanoparticles. It is worth to mention that the selected US power densities used to run both simulations and experiments are dictated mainly by the cell viability: actually, preliminary experiments showed that US input densities higher than 0.6\u00a0W/cm2 relied on a rapid increase of the temperature of the water media and on a high percentage of cell death, even without the presence of NCs, as reported in S.I., Fig.\u00a0S.5. Since these effects prevented to evaluate the non-thermal effects of US on the cell fate, higher US powers than 0.6\u00a0W/cm2 were not considered in the present study."

            "text": "Figure\u00a04 compares the production of ROS, evaluated by SCL of Luminol and EPR measurements of DMPO-OH molar concentrations, with the cell viability essays on two different cancer cell lines (KB cells, a cervical adenocarcinoma and Daudi cells, a Burkitt lymphoma) at different US input power densities and irradiation times. Studying the effect of US on two so different cancer cell lines, allow us to test also the biological variability, enabling us to verify the hypothesis of a potential therapeutic system.\nBoth the spatial average SCL blue intensity detected from the well (Fig.\u00a04A) and the molar concentration of DMPO-OH spin adducts found through EPR measurements (Fig.\u00a04B) globally show an increasing trend proportional to longer sonication times and higher US power densities in input. Considering firstly the lowest US power density (0.3\u00a0W/cm2), the related SCL intensity assumes negligible values for all the sonication times, in agreement with the null molar concentration of DMPO-OH obtained by EPR. This result corresponds to a negligible production of ROS during sonication. At the same power density, a high cells viability is obtained for both cell lines. In particular, at the lowest applied US power of 0.3\u00a0W/cm2, KB cells are not affected by the US treatment (Fig.\u00a04C), even for the longest sonication times (up to 2\u00a0min). Daudi cells also report a viability close to 100% for 30\u00a0s and 1\u00a0min, and a slight decrease of their metabolic activity is exhibited for 2\u00a0min sonication condition (Fig.\u00a04D). The unvaried cell viability for almost all the tested conditions supports the EPR and SCL measurements in which ROS production is negligible.\nConcerning the results obtained by applying the intermediate US power, 0.45\u00a0W/cm2, a negligible Luminol intensity is observed for 30\u00a0s sonication time (Fig.\u00a04A), while it gradually increases from 1 to 2\u00a0min. In particular, at 0.45\u00a0W/ cm2, a treatment of 1\u00a0min represents the shortest sonication time able to produce a detectable SCL blue light, even if its value is relatively very low. This result is consistent with the EPR results (Fig.\u00a04B), showing a similar increasing trend of ROS production as the sonication time increases, i.e. from 30\u00a0s to 1\u00a0min and to 2\u00a0min of sonication time.\nConcerning the cells viability, the first signs of modest cytotoxicity are obtained at 0.45\u00a0W/cm2 in KB cells at 2\u00a0min of sonication (around 78% cell viability in Fig.\u00a04C), while are already visible at the shortest sonication time of 30\u00a0s in Daudi cell line (Fig.\u00a04D). We hypothesize that the applied power density of 0.45\u00a0W/cm2 may impact on the cell viability, even slightly, while the dose of this treatment, which depends also on the application time, may vary depending on the cell type. More in general, the cell viability trend (Fig.\u00a04C and D) appears to be globally lower at 0.45\u00a0W/cm2 than at 0.3\u00a0W/cm2 power density,\n1 3\nand seems to be in line with the higher ROS production, increasingly proportional to the applied US power densities and times.\nA remarkable behavior is presented by the measurements at 0.60\u00a0W/cm2 of applied US power density. Both the SCL intensity histogram (dark blue bars in Fig.\u00a04A) and the molar concentration of DMPO-OH adducts (dark blue bars in Fig.\u00a04B) show non-negligible and increasing values of ROS production as a function of the treatment time. This behavior is reflected by the average cell viability values below 30% (see dark blue bars in Fig.\u00a04C and D) in both cancer cell lines, indicating an evident cytotoxic effect of 0.60\u00a0W/ cm2 power density at any sonication time. In particular, the recorded cell viability of Daudi cell line is null at the highest tested time, i.e. 2\u00a0min.\nConsidering that both\u00a0the cell lines are dispersed homogeneously inside the solution volume, it can be hypothesized that they are continuously moved by the convective forces generated by US during the irradiation time. It can be supposed that during the treatment, the majority of cells are exposed one or\nmore times to the strongest sonication activities occurring in the central region of the well, as highlighted by the simulation results. Actually, the simulation revealed the presence of a central tapered region in the well with the highest values of acoustic pressure and intensity. From the experimental data of SCL intensity and DMPO-OH molar concentration, a consistent ROS production can be also noticed. All the above considerations can be used to possibly motivate the reduced cell viability recorded at the highest US power density used, i.e. 0.6\u00a0W/cm2."

            "text": "The previous measurements allowed to set a base of understanding about the possible interaction among acoustic irradiation and living cell systems. Further comprehension of this mechanism can be done by challenging the overall system with the addition of inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles in the water solution, providing a direct evidence of the effect of solid-state inorganic nanoparticles compared to\n1 3\nthe pure water solutions. Furthermore, the ZnO-NH2 NCs were exploited in the cell culture media, allowing their internalization in KB cancer cells and providing a base of understanding in synergy with US irradiation. In these experiments, the lowest US powers, equal to 0.3 and 0.45\u00a0W/cm2, were applied since they have per se a non-toxic behavior towards cells, as demonstrated in Fig.\u00a04C. For similar reasons, the ZnO-NH2 NCs concentration of 10\u00a0\u00b5g/mL was incubated with the KB living cancer cells, as it resulted from a previous study (Racca et\u00a0al. 2020) to do not cause any cytotoxicity to the cells (in absence of US), and to provide a sufficiently high amount of NCs internalized into the cells (Racca et\u00a0al. 2020). However, for the sake of completeness, also the results associated to an input power of 0.60\u00a0W/cm2 are reported in this study.\nFigure\u00a05 shows an overview among the effect of US irradiation combined with the presence of NCs leading to the\ngeneration of ROS in water-based media (red bars), and a possible comparison with the cell viability, by analyzing the influence of different sonication times and input power densities. Control measurements in the absence of ZnO-NH2 NCs (blue bars) are also inserted for reference and refer to experiments already reported in Fig.\u00a04.\nAn initial consideration can be done in absence of US irradiation, where the sole presence of ZnO-NH2 NCs is not sufficient for generating ROS, thus neither blue light emission in SCL (Fig.\u00a05A), nor DMPO-OH adducts in EPR spectroscopy (Fig.\u00a05B) are measured. These results are consistent with high cell viability of the NCs-incubated cells in absence of US (red dotted bar in Fig.\u00a05C) very similar to the untreated cell control (black bar).\nSCL measurements at 0.3\u00a0 W/cm2 and 0.45\u00a0 W/cm2 (Fig.\u00a05A) show a slight increased spatial average blue intensity in presence of ZnO-NH2 NCs, in accordance with the\nFig. 5 Overview of the ROS generation and related cell viability in a system comprising inorganic metal oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NH2 NCs) and ultrasound irradiation in a well from a 24-multiwell plate. (A) Luminol blue intensity from SCL measurements with 200\u00a0 \u03bcg/ ml of ZnO-NH2 NCs; (B) DMPO-OH adduct concentration measurements from EPR spectroscopy to evaluate ROS production (with\n200\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml of ZnO-NH2 NCs), and (C) KB cancer cell viability according to different US power densities and sonication times (with 24\u00a0 h preincubation of cell with 10\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml of ZnO-NH2 NCs); black bar and red dotted bar correspond respectively to untreated KB cell and cells incubated with NCs without US exposure\n1 3\naugmented amount of free radicals detected, i.e. EPR measurements (Fig.\u00a05B), when NCs are in solution. A different behavior is displaced in SCL at 0.6\u00a0W/cm2. The presence of NCs reduces the detected light compared to pure water under identical US irradiation conditions. As reported in literature (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2022; \u00d6zg\u00fcr et\u00a0al. 2005), ZnO NCs are characterized by an absorption spectrum (Fig.\u00a0S-3) which partially overlap with blue light emission by SCL. It is possible to state that for 0.6\u00a0W/cm2, even though there is an increased ROS production with NCs (Fig.\u00a05B) attributable to an increased inertial cavitation, the absorption by ZnO NCs of the photon produced by SCL become a dominant phenomenon and it is responsible for the diminished blue signal detected due to the close proximity between the NC and point of photon generation (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2022; Kwan et\u00a0al. 2015; Suslick and Flannigan\u00a02008).\nEPR measurements (Fig.\u00a05B) show a monotonic increase of DMPO-OH concentration values in presence of ZnO NCs(red bars in Fig. B) with respect to the values from pure water at the same conditions (blue bars in Fig.\u00a05B). Therefore, a clear trend of the ROS generation as function of the sonication time and the US input power density can be observed and is enhanced by ZnO-NH2 nanocrystals. The trend of radical production, visible for all the power densities tested, suggests a constructive interaction between US and NCs, which possibly facilitated inertial cavitation in water, responsible for ROS production, and lowers the cavitation threshold, as also previously reported (Vighetto et\u00a0al. 2019; Ancona et\u00a0al. 2020).\nIn accordance with the results presented above, the US powers at lowest input densities, i.e. 0.3 and 0.45\u00a0W/cm2, did not impact significantly on the cancer cell viability in either presence or absence of NCs. While the presence of ZnO NCs resulted to increase the ROS production, this effect was not sufficient enough to induce cytotoxicity. Specifically, nor the used US power densities and times, neither the ZnO-NH2 NCs co-incubation, were sufficient to generate an irreversible damage to cells, (including the generated ROS or any mechanical effects) to cause a consistent cell death. Cell viability actually remained well above 90%.\nDifferent considerations can be done for the highest US input power density, 0.6\u00a0W/cm2: at increasing irradiation times from few seconds (5\u201310\u00a0s) up to 30\u00a0s, a negative effect on cell viability is recorded, decreasing the cell viability down to 25\u201330% at 0.6\u00a0W/cm2 for 30\u00a0s, both in presence and absence of ZnO-NH2 NCs. The contribution of the NCs remains however unclear and the responsibility of the observed cell death mechanism can be mainly reconducted to the US input power density used and to a specific time of US application. Both can lead to ROS production, however, as mentioned above, ROS are not the only responsible for cell death, as far as also mechanical damages can be obtained and are here not measured.\nThe obtained finding however highlights the adequacy of the mathematical modelling and of both SCL and EPR experiments in pure water, all useful to quantify a certain \u201cdose\u201d of US given to a system and to hypothetically predict the possible biological consequences. In particular we highlight that the measurement of the luminol sonochemiluminescence, although not quantitative, may represent a useful qualitative method to rapidly and directly estimate the presence of ROS produced in an US irradiated solution and screen out conditions which could be applied to living cancer cell aiming at killing them. Clearly, the final proof of the identification and quantification of the produced ROS has to be achieved with a more robust technique, like the EPR spectroscopy, mandatory in presence of optically responsive materials, which is however much more time consuming and laborious, and the biological results proofed by robust cell viability tests."

            "text": "In the present study we aimed to deepen the physical knowledge low-intensity ultrasound irradiating a simple water volume, producing reactive oxygen species and further evaluate a possible therapeutic activity against cancer cell.\nWe explored different US input power densities at low frequency (1\u00a0MHz) and we set a mathematical model able to predict the acoustic pressure field and acoustic density distribution in the analyzed water volume. Despite the used US were non-focused, we observed the formation of a symmetric and tapered focus along the central vertical axis of the water sample volume, having the highest pressure amplitude values and acoustic densities.\nWe then validated the simulated data with experimental measurements, detecting the reactive oxygen species generation with two different techniques, sonochemiluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both methods indicated a negligible value of produced ROS once US input power density are low enough, i.e. at 0.3\u00a0W/cm2, for any of the application time studied. An increasing trend of produced ROS is consistently observed once US power densities in input are increased and at increasing values of irradiation times. A parallel evaluation of two different cancer cell line viability was also performed. High cell viability was indeed accounted at the lowest US power densities in input, while a decrease in cell viability was recorded at higher power densities and increasing application times. In these conditions, the 0.6\u00a0W/cm2 US power density resulted to produce the highest amount of ROS and the strongest cytotoxic effect, especially for the longest treatment time of 2\u00a0min.\nTo further challenge the use of US in combination with nanoparticles, towards the direction of US-assisted\n1 3\nnanomedicines, the interplay among US and amine-functionalized ZnO NCs was analyzed for any of the US power densities and times considered. Interestingly, the amount of ROS generated in presence of NCs is higher than the respective amount produced in\u00a0pure water. This result suggested a constructive interaction between US and NC, which possibly facilitated inertial cavitation in water, responsible for ROS production, and lowers the cavitation threshold. The cell viability measurements were conducted first internalizing the nanoparticles for 24\u00a0h in KB adenocarcinoma cell line and then exposing the cells to US. Since the ZnO-NH2 NCs were adopted with cells in a sub-toxic concentration, a very good cell viability was observed both in absence of US irradiation and at the lowest US input power density, 0.3\u00a0W/ cm2, irrespectively to the applied sonication time. In contrast at increasing US input densities of 0.45 and 0.6\u00a0W/cm2 and related increasing application times, more evident signs of cytotoxicity were observed, however the presence of ZnONH2 NCs did not give a clear contribution improving the cell cytotoxicity. These results evidence that the interplay among US and NPs in biological living system is more complex than in pure water and more conditions have to be explored prior to achieve a univocal answer. In our contest, it seems that US power densities and application times on a biological system plays the major role in dictating the cell viability.\nAs a whole, the obtained results fairly show that mathematical simulation of an acoustically treated water system can be also experimentally validated with simple measurements, like ROS production. In particular, the qualitative SCL measurements are confirmed in pure water by more robust and quantitative EPR technique and allow to estimate the amount of produced ROS in the system. In a further step, the amount of produced ROS can fairly correlate to the cancer cell viability measurements.\nParticular attention should be paid when optically responsive materials, as ZnO NCs, are involved in the studied system. The interactions between all the elements become complex, involving multiple physical and chemical processes, and the mathematical model here proposed should be implemented. Further work will be done in this direction, moving towards a mathematical model able to predict the outcome of a complex system in which a large number of agents plays different roles, anticipating the biological behaviors of different cell lines.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10544- 022- 00635-x.\nAcknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge the work of Roberto Ruffinello, MD Eng for paving the way on preliminary SCL measurements and the work of Marco Carofiglio, MD Eng for the fruitful discussion and the UV-vis measurements.\nAuthor Contributions All authors have given approval to the final version of the manuscript.\nFunding Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.
