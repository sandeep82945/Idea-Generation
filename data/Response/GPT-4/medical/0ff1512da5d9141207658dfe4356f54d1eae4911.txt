Comparative Studies Across Different Regions and Cultures: Conduct similar studies in other regions and countries to compare environmental risk perceptions and awareness levels. This could include both developed and developing countries to identify cultural, socioeconomic, and educational factors that influence environmental risk awareness. Such comparative analyses could provide insights into global patterns and unique regional challenges in environmental health education and policy-making.

Longitudinal Studies on the Impact of Environmental Awareness Programs: Design and implement longitudinal studies to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental awareness programs over time. These studies could track changes in awareness, attitudes, and behaviors concerning environmental risks among mothers and other influential community members. The focus could be on assessing how education and proactive communication strategies alter perceptions and lead to tangible improvements in environmental health outcomes.

Research on the Role of Digital Media in Enhancing Environmental Risk Awareness: Investigate the impact of digital media and technology in educating and engaging populations about environmental risks. This could include evaluating the effectiveness of social media campaigns, mobile apps, interactive websites, and virtual reality experiences in raising awareness and promoting environmentally responsible behaviors. The study could also explore the challenges and opportunities in leveraging digital platforms for public health education.

Studies on Environmental Risk Perception and Decision-making in Crisis Situations: Explore how environmental risk perceptions influence decision-making and protective behaviors during environmental crises, such as chemical spills, air pollution spikes, or natural disasters. Research could focus on understanding the psychological and social factors that drive action or inaction and how timely and accurate information can mitigate adverse outcomes.

Evaluation of Policy Interventions and Community-based Approaches to Reduce Environmental Exposures: Conduct research on the effectiveness of policy interventions and community-based initiatives aimed at reducing exposure to environmental risks, especially in vulnerable populations. This could include studies on the impact of zoning laws, pollution control measures, green urban planning, and community-led environmental monitoring on reducing health risks associated with environmental hazards.
