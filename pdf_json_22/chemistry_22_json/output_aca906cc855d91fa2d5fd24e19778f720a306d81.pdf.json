Paul Attfieldb,*, Xianran Xinga,*\nChemical pressure, a strange but familiar concept, is a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications and arouses\ngreat interest due to its diversity and efficiency to synthesize new compounds and tune functional materials. Different from\nphysical pressure loaded by external force that is positive, chemical pressure can be either positive or negative (contract a\nlattice or expand it), often through flexible and mild chemical synthesis strategies, which are particularly important as a\ndegree of freedom to manipulate material behaviors. In this tutorial review, we summarize the features of chemical pressure\nas a methodology and demonstrate its role in synthesizing and discovering some typical magnetic, electric, and thermal\nresponsive functional materials. The measure of chemical pressure using experimental lattice strain and elastic modulus was\nproposed, which can be used for quantitative descriptions of the correlation between lattice distortion and property. From\na lattice strain point of view, we classify chemical pressure into different categories: (i) chemical substitution, (ii) chemical\nintercalation/de-intercalation, (iii) size effect, and (iv) interface constraint, etc. Chemical pressure, combining chemical\nbonding, lattice symmetry, local structure, electron structure and phonon structure effects etc., is a general and effective\nmethod for synthesizing new compounds and tuning functional materials.\n1.

            "text": "Although unfamiliar to many people, the terminology of\n\u201cchemical pressure\u201d emerged as a physical quantify nearly one\nhundred years ago. The story can be traced back to the early\ntwentieth century when the volume of an atom was found to be\ncompressive. T. W. Richards et al. claimed that there must be a\n\u201cintrinsic distending pressure\u201d, i.e., chemical pressure, to resist\nexternal pressure and chemical affinity in matter:\np +  = p + P (1)\nwhere p presents external physical pressure,  presents\nchemical affinity, p presents intrinsic distending or repulsive pressure (chemical pressure), and P present thermal pressure\u2014 the force of lattice strain induced by thermal expansion.1, 2 That is, chemical pressure is a passive interatomic\nforce exerted to balance the internal and external forces in\nsolids. One of the most useful feature of chemical pressure is\nthat it can be modified by elemental substitutions, which\nfacilely controls atomic distance in solids like physical pressure does.3, 4 Studies to correlate chemical pressure with physical\npressure have been carried out, e.g. Nowik et al. reported that\nthe valence-phase-transition temperature (T\u03bd) in Yb0.41n0.6Cu2 intermetallic compound decreases with both physical pressure\n(hydrostatic pressure) and chemical pressure (via substitution of Yb3+ with La3+).3 The \u201cchemical pressure\u201d concept became\npopular for explaining variations in the critical temperature of\nsuperconductor families such as the copper oxides first\ndiscovered in the 1980\u2019s and the iron-based superconductors in the 2000\u2019s.5-7 Since then, chemical pressure has been widely\nused as a counterpoint strategy to physical pressure in the\ndesign and synthesis of solids, notably magnetic, electric, and\nthermal responsive functional materials where properties are\nvery sensitive to lattice strain.\nThe key point of chemical pressure method is the generation\nof lattice strain, which is realized by a chemical way instead of a\nphysical one. It changes transitions such as the spin, orbital, and\ncharge orderings of atoms in the lattice, and thus has important\ninfluence on material properties. The scope of the chemical\npressure method has grown with the chemistry diversity of\nmanipulating the lattice in solids. The employment of chemical\npressure has been increasing recognized as a diverse and\neffective strategy to control material structures at multiple a) Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Materials Genome Engineering, Institute of Solid State Chemistry, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, 100083, China.

In this tutorial\nreview, we discussed the nature of chemical pressure and its\nfeatures in comparison with physical pressure, and we redefine\nit as a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications.\nChemical pressure can be introduced by the following four chemical routes: (i) elemental substitution8-12, (ii) small molecules intercalation/de-intercalation13-16, (iii) size effect17-21, and (iv) chemical interfaces22-26. An experimental method to\nquantify chemical pressure is proposed. Furthermore, the\ncritical role of chemical pressure in modulating materials\nproperties are exampled in a series of magnetic, electric, and\nthermal responsive functional materials.

Alternatively, the lattice can be changed by a\nchemical route at ambient pressure, i.e., by chemical pressure.\nThe critical role of physical pressure in synthesizing new\ncompounds and revealing new physics in solids is evident;\nnevertheless, high pressure synthesis and characterizations are generally complex and expensive27, 29. Besides, some solid\nmaterials, based on radioactive actinides for instance, are not convenient for characterization under physical pressure30. By\ncomparison, chemical pressure is a gentle and convenient way\nto change the size of a lattice, which facilitates both material\nsynthesis and property characterizations.\nThe importance of chemical pressure can be well exampled\nin the studies of 1111-type LnFeAsO-based superconductors (Ln\n= Rare earths). LnFeAsO-based compounds generally adopt\ntetragonal P4/nmm symmetry, constituted by edge-sharing\nFeAs4 and (O,F)Ln4 tetrahedra layers stacking alternatively along the [001] axis (Fig. 1a). Hosono et al. discovered the appearance\nof superconductivity in LaFeAs(O1-xFx) (x = 0.05-0.12) with Tc of 26 K.31 Immediately, it was found that increasing the pressure\nenables a rapid increase in the Tc of LaFeAs(O1-xFx). The onset Tc reaches a maximum of 43 K, well above the McMillan limit,32 at 4 GPa and then decreases with further increasing pressure.33\nInterestingly, the emergent high-temperature\nsuperconductivity can be realized by chemical pressure method at ambient pressure. Replacing La3+ with smaller rare earth\ncations in LnFeAs(O1-xFx) (x \u2248 0.10), the Tc increases from 26 K for La3+ to 41 K for Ce3+, to 52 K for Pr3+, and to a maximum of 55 K for Sm3+,34 which further decreases to 51 K for Tb3+, to 41 K for Dy3+, and to 33 K for Ho3+.35 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1b-\n1c, chemical pressure and physical pressure have rather similar\nsuperconducting phase diagrams for the LnFeAsO-based\ncompounds. Fig. 1c shows the pnictogen height (the distance of\nthe As to the Fe plane in the FeAs layers) dependence of Tc for the typical Fe-based superconductors. There exists a generally\nsymmetric curve with a peak around a critical pnictogen height of 1.38 \u00c5 that is in favor of superconducting state.36, 37 The\nuniversal mechanism for both physical pressure and chemical\npressure can be understood by the regulation of pnictogen\nheight in Fe-based superconductors. This also illustrates the\nmore general point that chemical pressure effects in complex\nmaterials can be positive or negative. This arises when some\nstructural geometry is optimum for the property of interest\n(represented by the pnictogen height in the LnFeAs(O1-xFx) series). Starting from the largest Ln = La, increasing chemical pressure (decreasing Ln3+ radius) initially increases Tc until geometry is optimum for Ln = Sm, but then decreases it for the\nsmaller Ln cations as shown in Fig. 1c. Another example of\noptimal structure geometry is in perovskites with tolerance\nfactor t =1 as described later in the Chemical Substitution\nsection. The first superconductor with Tc higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, YBa2Cu3O7, was also designed by a chemical pressure method (replacing La3+ in La2-xBaxCuO4 with Y3+) although this led to an unexpected change in structure type.7, 34\nXianran Xing\n4 | J.

Red diamonds (marked by arrow) indicate physical pressure on LaFeAs(O1-xFx).\nPhysical pressure changes the lattice in solids without\nintroducing other variables. However, chemical pressure\nusually brings new variables to the parent material, such as new\natoms, molecules, or interfaces. These new variables alter the\nstructure of the host lattice at multiple levels, and can modify\nmaterial properties as well. To isolate the \u201cpressure\u201d effect of\nchemical pressure, elements with similar chemical properties\nbut different sizes, i.e., possessing the same charges and similar\nelectronic structures, are ideal. Common examples are lanthanide (rare earth) Ln3+ cations and M2+ alkaline earth (M =\nCa, Sr, Ba) cations, as illustrated in studies of chemical pressure\neffects on LnFeAs(O1-xFx) superconductors above and thermoelectric performance in LnSb2O2 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Ho, and Er),11 and on phonon vibration in Ba1\u2212xSrxFCl (0 \u2264 x \u2264 3)38.\nA great advantage of chemical pressure is that both positive pressure and negative pressure can be realized.18, 21, 39-41\nPhysical pressure presses a material down and diminishes its\nvolume, which is usually defined as positive pressure. By\ncontrast, chemical pressure can either diminish the volume or expand it, see Fig. 2.42-44 The latter is usually defined as negative\n(chemical) pressure. Negative pressure provides an important\ndegree of freedom for materials design in solids, making it a\npowerful method to synthesize new solids and to discover unusual properties.18, 21, 40, 41 In freestanding PbTiO3 nanowires, for example, negative pressure produces a lower-density \u201cPX\u201d\nphase to a higher-density perovskite phase transformation,\nwhich enhances the tetragonality, Curie temperature and spontaneous polarization.18 In CuO and MnF2 nanoparticles, the negative pressure induced by size effect greatly prompts the\nmagneto-lattice effect and transforms the thermal expansion\nbehavior from positive to negative below the magnetic ordering temperature.17\nDue to structural anisotropy, chemical pressure can possess\ndifferent signs along different directions, i.e., it can be negative\nalong one crystallographic direction while being positive along\nanother. Semimetal bismuth has the rhombohedral A7-type\nstructure built up by corrugated layers parallel to the (111) planes.19 Inside the plane, each atom is bonded to three\nnearest-neighbor atoms at 3.072 \u00c5 by a so-called metal-metal\ncovalent bond, while the shortest distance between the atoms\nin adjacent layers is 3.529 \u00c5. This gives rise to strong anisotropy\nin Young\u2019s modulus of 21 GPa and 31 GPa respectively along the a and c axis45. When the particle size reduces to the nanoscale, size effect-induced chemical pressure are strongly anisotropic.19\nWhen average particles sizes reduced to 28.5nm and 13.1 nm,\nthe a axis contracts by 0.42% and 0.54%, corresponding to\npositive chemical pressure of 0.13 GPa and 0.17 GPa; while the\nc axis expands by 0.24% and 0.67%, corresponding to negative\nchemical pressure of -0.05 GPa and -0.14 GPa (Fig. 3a). The\nanisotropic chemical pressure increases the bond angle that\nrelaxes under the thermal activation with rising temperature,\nand induces a transition of coefficient of thermal expansion\nfrom positive to negative along the c axis in nanosized bismuth. 19 By compassion, the size effect-induced chemical pressure in\ncubic ScF3 has the same sign (P>0 here) due to its isotropic character (Fig. 3b)46."

Instead, the degree\nof lattice strain was often used to describe chemical pressure in\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J.

However, using lattice strain to evaluate chemical pressure\nis indirect and inadequate. This is because the comparison of\nchemical pressures by a lattice strain method is limited to the\nspecific materials in a study, as different materials types differ greatly in compressibility or elastic modulus1. We can assert that a 2% lattice strain in Ba1-xSrxTiO3 by Sr2+ substitution for Ba2+ produces a larger chemical pressure than a 1% strain does,\nbut we cannot simply assert that a 2% strain in Fe1-xNix produces a larger chemical pressure than a 1% strain in Ba1-xSrxTiO3. Furthermore, chemical pressure should have the same\nforce/area units as external pressure (Pa, bar, torr, etc.). So,\nhow to quantify the chemical pressure?\nFredrickson et al. have developed a density functional\ntheory-chemical pressure (DFT-CP) analysis based on electronic interaction in intermetallic compounds50, 51:\n\ud835\udc43 = \u2212 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc38\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49 = \u2212\u2211 \u2211\n\ud835\udf15\n\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\n2 + (\u2211 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc56 \u2217 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b,\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b )\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) =\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56\n1\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f \u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56 (2)\nwhere E is the total energy expressed as a sum of onsite and pairwise interaction terms52, V is cell volume, Hij is the Hamiltonian matrix elements of (Hij), on is the occupancy of that crystal orbital, cn,j is the coefficient of atomic orbital j in crystal orbital n, Norb is the number of orbitals in the crystal, and pij is the pressure arising from the interaction between atomic\norbitals i and j (i = j terms are zero). The DFT-CP method can be\nemployed to calculate and interpret the chemical pressure distributions inside the crystal structures based on DFT results.9, 50, 51, 53 For example, they calculated the 2-Huckel chemical pressure of SrAg5 and a hypothetical CaAg5 phase (Fig. 4). The Sr atom has a net negative chemical pressure of -8.2 GPa, which\nis balanced by the positive chemical pressure values of the Ag\natoms of 1.7 GPa. Replacing Sr with the smaller Ca, the net\nchemical pressure at the Ca atom increases to -10.2 GPa; such a\nstrong chemical pressure drives a transition to the Ca2Ag7 structure with chemical pressure reduced to -1.2 GPa. The DFT-\nCP method is a useful tool to calculate the chemical pressure at\natomic level, and provides visual prediction of the structural\nstability and phase transformation.\nBesides the above theoretical analysis, here we propose two\nexperimental ways to quantify chemical pressure in solids. The\nfirst one is to apply both physical pressure and chemical\npressure to a material; the magnitude of chemical pressure\nshould equal to that of physical pressure that (if it can) causes\nthe same lattice strain (or volume change, in the parent\nmaterial), see Fig. 5. In other words, if the chemical pressure\nand the physical pressure generate the same lattice (or volume)\nchange in a material, we propose that they are equivalent in\nmagnitude. This idea is analogue to an ancient Chinese idiom\nstory \u201cCao Chong weighs an elephant\u201d: the mass of an elephant\nis determined by weighing many stones that generate the same\ndraught (water-displacement) of a boat, instead of weighing the\nelephant itself.\nThe second experiment method introduced below is more\nconvenient and straightforward and so we highly recommend it.\nIn material science, the relationship between strain and stress\nin a material follows the Hooke\u2019s law during elastic deformation\n\u03c3 = E e, where \u03c3 is the stress, e is the strain along loading\ndirection, and E is the Young\u2019s modulus. Since the nature of\nchemical pressure can also be considered as elastic lattice strain,\nin a chemical way instead of a physical one, we can describe chemical pressure by applying Eq. (1-2):54\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 = \u2212\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc650 (3)\nwhere dP is chemical pressure, dx is the change in lattice size\n(by chemical pressure), x0 is initial lattice size, and E is Young\u2019s modulus. All parameters, dx, x0 and E, are measurable (dx and a0 can be determined by X-ray diffraction, E can be measured by velocity measurement and is known or can be calculated for\nmost compounds). The negative sign defines compressive stress\nto be positive and tensile stress to be negative, to keep in\naccordance with physical pressure. Alternatively, we can use\nthe volumetric change to describe chemical pressure by:\n6 | J. Name. , 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx\nPlease do not adjust margins\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43 = \u2212\ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49\n\ud835\udc490 (4)\nwhere dV is the change in cell volume, V0 is initial cell volume, and K is bulk modulus (K = E/[3(1-2)],  is Poisson's ratio). In\nfact, Eq. (4) is most often used to describe the compressibility\nof material under uniform hydrostatic pressure. Note that the\nmodulus of E and K vary with composition, but the change is\nrelatively small when the structure-type and chemical\ncomposition do not change much (e.g., K is 97 GPa, 93 GPa and 103 GPa respectively for YFe2, TbFe2 and ErFe255).\nEq. (3) describes the chemical pressure along a certain\ndirection in solids, which is especially useful for thin films and\nlow symmetry structures where the lattice strain is highly\nanisotropic. Orientation dependence is unique to chemical\npressure. It plays a key role in many remarkable physical\nproperties that are inaccessible by isotropic hydrostatic physical\npressure, such as the emergent polar vortices in ferroelectric thin films.18, 22, 24, 49, 56 Eq. (4) is more suitable for isotropic\nchemical pressure, like size effect in nanoparticles, and\nchemical substitution in high symmetry structures. We note\nthat from Eq. (3) and (4), the magnitude of chemical pressure is\na relative value. Its value should be based on a given reference\nstate that is defined as the unstrained state. For a given\nreference state, the chemical pressure is proportional to the\nrigidity of the structure and the degree of deformation it\nundergoes. The magnitude of chemical pressure obtained from\nEq. (3) and (4) can be used for quantitative comparison among\nsolids in different types. Some examples of chemical pressure\nvalues in solids based on experimental lattice strain and elastic\nmodulus are shown in Table 1.\nDiverse routes for chemical pressure\nChemical substitution The most used chemical pressure\nmethod is chemical substitution by introducing different atoms\ninto the lattice. (This is most simply done by using cations of the\nsame valence as noted above, as introduction of aliovalent\nspecies can lead to further effects such as electronic doping or\nvacancy or interstitial formation.) Up to some limit of structural\ntolerance, an atom in the host lattice can be replaced by a new\none of different size. If replaced by a larger one, the lattice\nexpands and vice versa, known as Vegard\u2019s law if the lattice\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J. Name ., 2013, 00 , 1-3 | 7\nPlease do not adjust margins\nparameters change linearly76. The substitution produces a\nstereochemical interaction at the substitution site and a local\nstrain gradient propagating from it (Fig. 6a). This brings negative\nor positive pressure to the host lattice, breaks the ideal 3D\ntranslational periodicity, and changes the properties in solids.\nNegative thermal expansion (NTE) in open-framework\nstructure is driven by low-frequency phonon modes, which is\ncoupled to structural symmetry and can be well-controlled by chemical pressure77, 78. For example, ScF3 has a cubic ReO3-type structure (Pm-3m) built up by corner sharing ScF6 octahedra and displays unusual NTE covering a broad temperature range of 10- 1100 K79. The NTE is correlated to the rotary coupling of the ScF6 octahedra rigid units with the average Sc-F-Sc angle to be 180\u00b0 (Fig. 6b)79, 80, generating phonon modes with negative Gru\u0308neisen parameters46, 81. Slight chemical substitution by\nisovalent but smaller cations, i.e., (Sc0.85Ga0.05Fe0.1)F3, introduces positive chemical pressure to the structure (Fe3+: 0.645 \u00c5, Ga3+: 0.62 \u00c5, Sc3+: 0.745 \u00c5)8. X-ray pair distribution\nfunction (PDF) analysis indicates that the symmetry of\n(Sc0.85Ga0.05Fe0.1)F3 transforms to rhombohedral in the shortrange (R-3c, r < 20 \u00c5). Such a chemical pressure induced\nstructure distortion changes the Sc-F-Sc bond angle to be 173.3\u00b0,\nwhich hinders the transverse thermal vibration of fluorine\natoms. As a result, the NTE is suppressed to zero thermal expansion (Fig. 6c)8. The short-range structure of ScF3 can be further modulated by chemical pressure method in the MZrF6 series (M = Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn). It was found that the\nflexibility of the metal\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F atomic linkage driven by size misfit at\nthe M site governs the phonon modes and thus controls the\nthermal expansion. A flexible metal\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F atomic linkage induces\nNTE for M = Ca, Mn, Fe; while the stiff ones bring positive\nthermal expansion (PTE) for M = Ni, Co. Thus, thermal expansion\ncould be tuned from negative, to zero, and to positive by the chemical substitution method (Fig. 6d)82.\nThe piezoelectric effect arises from net movement of\npositive and negative ions with respect to each other under\nstress, resulting in an electric dipole or polarization. The\nmobility and flexibility of cations are sensitive to their local\ncoordination environments and are liable to variation by\nchemical pressure. Li et al. conducted chemical substitution using traces of small Sm3+ cations (1.24 \u00c5) for Pb2+ (1.49 \u00c5)\ncations in Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3\u2013PbTiO3 (PMN\u2013PT) solid solutions and introduced positive chemical pressure. A combined atomic-\nlever scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and\nfirst-principles calculations demonstrated that the substitution\ninduces significant local structural heterogeneity, which\nperturbs the local order parameters of polarization, and leads\nto heterogeneous polar regions and additional interfacial energies10 (Fig. 7a,7b). As a result, an extraordinarily large piezoelectric constant (d33 > 1,500 pC N\u20131) was observed in 2.5 mol% Sm-modified into 0.71Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3\u20130.29PbTiO3 (2.5Sm-71PMN\u201329PT) ceramic, in large contrast to the undoped counterpart (~500 pC N\u20131)83 (Fig. 7c,7d). In 1 mol% Sm-modified\n70PMN-30PT single crystal, they achieved an even larger piezoelectric constant (d33 > 3400 pC N\u20131)10 Similarly, Ranjan et al. reported an extraordinarily large electrostrain up to 1.3% in\nLa-doped 0.55Bi1\u2013yLayFeO3\u20130.45PbTiO3 (y = 0.3) solid solution ceramics84. Such a large electrostrain behavior is related to the\nchemical pressure induced structure disorder due to size misfit among Pb2+, Bi2+ and La3+ cations, which leads to a low-\nsymmetry ferroelectric phase, a large spontaneous lattice strain,\ndomain miniaturization, and an appropriate ferroelectric domain switching84.\n8 | J. Name. , 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx\nPlease do not adjust margins\nGenerally, the extent of chemical substitution has an upper\nlimit. It depends mainly on the size, charge, and\nelectronegativity of the atoms\u2014 the more similar the atoms,\nthe higher degree of the substitution. In simple structure types,\nthe range of sizes can be quantified based on geometric\nrelations. This is much studied in the ABX3-type perovskite structure where the limit of chemical substitution can be evaluated by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t 85:\n\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34+\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4b\n\u221a2(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35+\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4b) (5)\nwhere rA, rB, and rX are the average ionic radii of A, B and X site species respectively. For an ideal cubic perovskite structure t =\n1, indicating that the structure is perfectly matched among A, B\nand X cations. In BaMO3 (M = transition metal) perovskites, for example, the tolerance factor t is largely within the range of 0.93\u20131.0586. Transition temperatures for electronic or magnetic\norders typically have a maximum value at t = 1 and decrease rapidly as t falls away from this value.87 The same is also true in\nprinciple for t >1, but in practice this often leads to changes in\nstructure to other hexagonal-type perovskites. High (physical)\npressure has been used to stabilize some cubic-type BaMO3 perovskites, e.g. cubic-BaRuO3 (t = 1.06) has ferromagnetic TC = 60 K whereas SrRuO3 (t = 1.02) has TC = 160 K.88\nChemical intercalation/de-intercalation. Chemical\nintercalation (or de-intercalation) reaction introduces (or\nremoves) new chemical entities into (or from) a host lattice,\nsuch as molecular water, carbon dioxide, etc. The intercalation\n(or de-intercalation) of these guests expands (or shrinks) the\nhost lattice and hence induces chemical pressure. This kind of\nchemical pressure is usually introduced in metal\u2013organic\nframeworks (MOFs) or other inorganic structures with significant void space13, 15, 89, 90.\nThe MOF compound [{Ru2(F3PhCO2)4}2TCNQ(OEt)2] (1) crystallizes in a triclinic D2A-layered structure and displays ferromagnetic ordering at ground state (Fig. 8a) (30). Viewing\ndown the a\u2019 axis, the four CN groups of TCNQ(OEt)2 are coordinated with the [Ru2] units to form a wavy layered twodimensional network (D2A layer) that lies on the (020) plane with an interlayer distance of 8.07 \u00c5 (Fig. 8b). This compound\nabsorbs CO2 into the center of the hexagonal fishnet with an amount of 113 ml STP g\u22121 (10.6 molecules per formula unit) at\n99 kPa (1\u2283CO2). Accordingly, the cell volume increases sharply from 1763.0(2) \u00c53 for 1 to 2172.3(3) \u00c53 for 1\u2283CO2 by a rate of 23%, and induces significant negative chemical pressure of -3.05\nGPa (B = 13.3 GPa by our calculations) to the lattice (Fig. 8c). As\na result, the TCNQ(OEt)2 and Ru\u2212N \u2212 C bending angle reduces accordingly in 1\u2283CO2, flattening the D2A layer and expanding interlayer distance to 8.93 \u00c5 (Fig. 8d). Due to the sensitivity of\nmagnetism to the distance between magnetic atoms, this\nswitches the electronic state from a one-electron-transferred\nstate into the neutral state, and transforms the magnetic\nproperty from ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic (Fig. 8e-8g). Such\na magnetic phase change is reversable by the guest CO2 molecules intercalation/de-intercalation in the framework16.\nIn open-framework structures, the NTE originates from\ntransverse thermal vibrations of atoms where the \u201ctrue\u201d bond\nlengths are longer than \u201capparent\u201d bond length, as schemed in\nFig. 9a. Such transverse thermal vibrations should be hindered\nor reduced by additional chemical pressure from guest ions or molecules in the empty space of framework.14, 77 For YFe(CN)6based Prussian blue analogues, the NTE is dominated by the\ntransverse motion of N and C atoms. In YFe(CN)6, Fe atoms coordinates to six C atoms to form regular octahedra (FeC6) and Y atoms coordinates to six N atoms to give a bicapped distorted\ntrigonal prism (YN6). The FeC6 and YN6 groups are bridged through CN units in the entire structure with nearly linear Y-NFe linkage (176.01(1)\u00b0). After intercalation, K+ and H2O are located in the pores near the YN6 trigonal prism of YFe(CN)6, see Fig. 9c,9f. and the cell volume and atomic positions change due\nto electrostatic interactions. The cell volume of KYFe(CN)6 dramatically contracts by 18.3% compared with that of YFe(CN)6 accompanied by a reduction of Y-N-Fe angle (140.54(5)\u00b0). These\nguest ions or molecules act as barriers to block the transverse\nthermal vibrations. As shown in Fig. 9d,9e, the transverse vibrational mode of NTE in YFe(CN)6 at 44 cm-1 shows the\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J.

However, for KYFe(CN)6, the low-frequency contribution of N and C atoms is much weakened due to the presence of K+ ions. The lowest energy mode of KYFe(CN)6 at 49.6 cm-1 has a small negative value of Gr\u00fcneisen parameter\n(Fig. 9g,9h). In this way, the thermal expansion of YFe(CN)6 can be substantially switched from strong negative (\u03b1V = -33.6710- 6 K-1) to positive by chemical pressure induced by the addition of guest H2O molecules or K+ ions (\u03b1V = 20.3  10-6 K-1 for KYFe(CN)6, \u03b1V = 27.7110-6 K-1 for YFe(CN)6\u20274H2O, \u03b1V= 42.72 10- 6 K-1 for KYFe(CN)6\u20273H2O (Fig. 9b).14\nSize effect. Surface atoms have unique electronic states and\ncoordination environments compared with those in the interior.\nThe lattice at the surface of solids usually undergoes a strained state20. When particle size decreases to nanoscale, such a lattice\nstrain could penetrate throughout the whole (or most of the)\nparticle. As the size of nanoparticles can be well-controlled by\nchemical synthesis, we categorize the size effect-induced lattice\nstrain as another type of chemical pressure. Besides lattice\nstrain, the chemical pressure from size effect can even change\nthe structural symmetry, spin state, and phonon vibration when the particle size reduces below a critical value91, 92.\nSun et al. synthesized ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) with sizes of 12 nm, 36 nm, and 1 \u00b5m through a two-phase solvothermal method21. It was found that there exists a\nnegative chemical pressure in PbTiO3 NPs which strengthens with reducing of particle size with \u0394V/Vbulk = 0%, 0.4%, and 2.2% for 1 \u00b5m (bulk), 36 nm, and 12 nm, corresponding to chemical\npressure values of 0 MPa, -558 MPa, and -3.0 GPa (the bulk modulus K of PbTiO3 is 141 GPa75), see Fig. 10. The structural origin of the size effect was investigated by X-ray PDF and XAFS\nanalysis. It shows that the nearest Pb-OII bonds (equatorial)\nshortens with reduced NP size while the nearest Pb-OI bonds\n(vertex) elongates, accompanied by an enhanced off-centering\nof Ti ions in the octahedra. Further aberration-corrected STEM\nimages indicate that the as-prepared PbTiO3 NPs surfaces are dominated by PbO-terminal layers. These PbO-terminals are\nproduced by the confined synthesis of the two-phase\nsolvothermal route (Fig. 10b). With particle size decreases to\nnanoscale, the number of surface ions of nanomaterials\nincreases geometrically: the overall atomic ratio Pb/Ti increases\nfrom 1.00 for 1 \u00b5m to 1.13 for 12 nm. This significantly alters\nthe average coordination environment of Pb atom and\nenhances the size effect. Further theoretical calculation shows\n10 | J. Name. , 2012, 00, 1-3 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx\nPlease do not adjust margins\nthat the electronic structure origin of chemical pressure is\nrelated to the hybridizations between Pb 6s and O 2pz orbitals of PbO-terminated surface and between Ti 3dz2 and O 2pz orbitals of TiO6 octahedra, which yield raised tetragonality and large spontaneous polarization in PbTiO3 NPs (Fig. 10).21\nAntiperovskite manganese nitrides (Mn3AN, A = Cu, Zn, Sn, etc.) are well-studied for their interesting NTE behaviors driven\nby magnetism. Song et al. prepared three different\nmicrostructures of antiperovskite manganese nitrides\nMn3Cu0.5Ge0.5N: coarse-grained polycrystalline (mean grain size \u2248 2.0 \u03bcm), nanocrystalline (mean grain size \u2248 30 nm), and ultrananocrystalline (mean grain size \u2248 12 nm), see Fig. 11.93 All these\nthree materials adopt cubic Pm-3m symmetry. Neutron\ndiffraction shows that the Mn occupancy decreases from 100%\nin the coarse-grained (Mn1000) to \u2248 87.8% in the\nnanocrystalline (Mn878) and to \u2248 78.7% in the ultra-\nnanocrystalline (Mn787) material. The cell parameters reduce\nfrom 3.91211(9) \u00c5 (Mn1000) to 3.89799(7) \u00c5 (Mn878) and to\n3.89332(7) \u00c5 (Mn787). This produces chemical pressures of 0\nGPa, 2.7 GPa and 3.6 GPa, respectively. Such size effect weakens\nthe magnetic ordering of Mn sublattice with site 3c Mn moment\nreducing from ~3.0 B to 2.6 B and 2.2 B, TC decreasing from 340 K to 260 K and 230 K, for Mn1000, Mn878 and Mn787,\nrespectively. As a result, the CTE changes from strongly negative (\u03b1 = -17.1\u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121, 260-340 K) to moderately negative (\u03b1 = - 3.89\u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121, 160-260 K) and to ZTE (0.118 \u00d710-7 K-1, 12-230 K), see Fig. 11.93\nInterface constraint. In epitaxial thin films, the lattice of the\nfilm is constrained and modulated by the substrate via the\n\u201cbiaxial strain\u201d (binding in-plane but free in the out-of-plane\ndirection), which is another form of chemical pressure24, 26, 94.\nThis method is widely used to favour metastable phases over\nthe equilibrium phase (epitaxial stabilization). Especially for\nbrittle oxides, the lattice strain in the film can reach as large as\nseveral %, one order of magnitude larger than that in bulk (~ 0.1%)94. As shown in Fig. 12a,12b, through screening substrates\nwith different in-plane lattice constant (changes either\nsubstrate type or its orientation), both positive and negative\nchemical pressure can be achieved, prominently expanding\nmaterial functions such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, band gap, and superconductivity22, 24, 48. When lattice misfit is large,\ndislocations can arise, which tends to relax the large lattice\nstrain. To avoid these dislocations, the thickness of the film should be below a critical thickness94, 95.\nXu et al. grew 100 nm \u03b1-formamidinium lead iodide (\u03b1-\nFAPbI3) epitaxial films on a series of mixed methylammonium lead chloride/bromide (MAPbClxBr3\u2212x, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1.5) single crystalline substrates, Fig. 12c,12d26. In their freestanding form,\nboth \u03b1-FAPbI3 and MAPbClxBr3\u2212x are cubic with Pm3m space group. The lattice constants are 6.35 \u00c5 for freestanding \u03b1-\nFAPbI3 and 5.83\u20135.95 \u00c5 for MAPbClxBr3-x substrates, indicating that a positive in-plane chemical pressure was imposed on the\n\u03b1-FAPbI3 film. As x increases from 0 to 1.5, the lattice parameter a of the substrate reduces, which causes a strain of 2.4% and a\nbiaxial chemical pressure of 1.32 GPa, see Fig. 12e (The chemical\npressure is calculated by P = C12  c/c, where C12 is the transverse elastic constant of FAPbI3 (= -5.5\u00b12.2 GPa)96). Such a strain effectively changes the crystal structure, reduces the\nbandgap, increases the hole mobility of \u03b1-FAPbI3, and hence increases the external quantum efficiency (Fig. 12f)26.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 20xx J. Name ., 2013, 00 , 1-3 | 11\nPlease do not adjust margins\nAlternative to biaxial strain imposed by 2D substrate, a new\ninterfacial chemical pressure method\u2013 \u201cinterphase strain\u201d method, was proposed recently25. Two materials with similar\ncrystal structures, but different lattice parameters, are used to\ngrow in a single composite with coherent lattice matching. In\nthis way, an isotropic and 3D compression or tensile strain can\nbe introduced into the material that originally had the larger or\nsmaller lattice parameters, respectively. For example, PbTiO3 adopts a tetragonal perovskite structure with lattice constants\na = 3.899 \u00c5, c =4.154 \u00c5, and c/a = 1.065 (Fig. 13a); PbO adopts a\nplate-like tetragonal structure but with a large c/a ratio (a =\n3.973 \u00c5, c =5.022 \u00c5, and c/a = 1.264), see Fig. 13b. In the\nPbTiO3/PbO composite fabricated by \u201cinterphase strain\u201d method, PbTiO3 and PbO share the same c lattice constant (4.840 \u00c5) (Fig. 13c-13d). As a result, a super-strong negative\nchemical pressure of -24 GPa was generated with a super-\ntetragonal distortion (c/a = 1.238) in PbTiO3 (\u0394V/Vbulk = 17.1%), which induces a state-of-art remanent polarization of 236.3 C/cm2 25.\nThe \u201cinterphase strain\u201d method can also be extended to other materials (111).54 For BaTiO3/BaO, the negative chemical pressure (~ -5.7 GPa) was imposed by the coherent lattice strain\nfrom large cubic BaO to small tetragonal BaTiO3, generating high tetragonality (c/a = 1.12) and facilitating large\ndisplacements of Ti. This leads to the record remanent polarization Pr (100 \u03bcC/cm2) in any forms of BaTiO3 to date with\na high Curie temperature Tc (above 1000 \u00b0C), see Fig. 13f,13g. It was reported that such negative pressure alters the bonding\nstates, i.e. inducing bonding of Ba 5p-O 2p hybridization (which\nis ionic bonding in bulk), and strong-bonding of Ti eg and O 2p, which contribute to the tremendously enhanced polarization\n(111). The interphase strain method has the advantage of\nproviding not only isotropic negative chemical pressure but also\nisotropic positive chemical pressure, through selective phase\nmatches, and the magnitude of chemical pressure can be modulated by adjusting the composition.54"

            "text": "This review summarizes the development of chemical\npressure and defines the concept as a methodology for material\ndesign: a lattice internal force caused by chemical modifications.\nThe main feature of chemical pressure is that the lattice strain\nis caused by a chemical way, instead of physical one, and hence\nis diverse and does not require extreme conditions. As shown in\nFig. 14, applying chemical pressure not only changes the lattice\nsize itself, but can also change the spin, orbital, and charge\norderings of the relevant atoms. These changes alter material structures at various levels, including lattice symmetry53, 97, local structure8, 9, 82, electronic structure98, 99, and phonon structure38, 46, and hence influences material properties by\nvirtue of structure-property relationship (Fig. 14). By proposing\ntwo equations for quantification, we can see that the limit of\nchemical pressure is generally within several GPa, around two\norders of magnitude smaller than that of the highest achievable\nphysical pressures. The largest value, -24 GPa to our best\nknowledge, was realized via a newly proposed \u201cinterphase\nstrain\u201d method in a PbTiO3/PbO coherent lattice, and is accompanied by an unusual ferroelectric response25. More\nnovel methods enabling stronger chemical pressures would be\nhighly attractive to realize striking or unusual properties in the\nfuture. More details, such as local strain gradient and its\npropagation from substitution site, and the electronic and\nphonon structures induced by the breaking of ideal 3D\ntranslational periodicity, remain for further exploration of new\nphenomena in solids by chemical pressure methods.\n12 | J.
