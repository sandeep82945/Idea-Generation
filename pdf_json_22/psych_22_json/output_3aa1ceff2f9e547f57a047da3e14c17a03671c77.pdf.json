COVID19 is a flu-like infection that is spread by coughing, sneezing, or droplets from rhinorrhea2. Fever, cough, malaise, sputum and / or shortness of breath are symptoms of COVID 19 respiratory infections3. According to the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, 110,671 cases have occurred in western Saudi Arabia by February 15, 20214. Exposure to COVID-19 may result in psychological disorders such as depression, phobia disorders and anxiety5,6. Healthcare providers are at a greater risk of developing these psychological disorders because they are on the front lines of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic5. Such as physiotherapists who have a crucial role in the respiratory and physical rehabilitation of patients with COVID-193. So, providing psychological support to healthcare providers has been identified as essential for their long-term capacity7. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of psychological impact among physical therapist during COVID-19 in western KSA."

They were between the ages of 21 and 42 at the time of the COVID19 outbreak and worked in a variety of public health facilities in western Saudi Arabia, including (Makkah-Jeddah-Medina-Yanbu-Taif). Participants were recruited through an online survey. In the case of COVID 19, 110 physiotherapists provided direct care to patients in 18 public and health facilities in Saudi Arabia's western area. Sixty-eight (68) Physiotherapists were from Makkah public and health hospitals, (19) Physiotherapists were from Jeda public and health hospitals, (15) Physiotherapists were from Medina public and health hospitals, (5) Physiotherapists were from Taif municipal Health Hospitals, and (3) Physiotherapists were from Yanbu Municipal Public Health Hospitals. Data Collection: From January 26, 2021 to March 2, 2021, all data was collected using an online questionnaire with 31 questions. The questionnaire had three sections: personal, occupational, and psychological. The researchers asked the\nparticipants to confirm their willingness to participate in the study. The survey's personal part featured questions about age, height, and weight8. The occupational component of the survey asked if the participant was a specialist or an intern, as well as their practice area and patient contact hours8. The last section asked about the psychological impact during COVID-19 outbreak. The researchers asked about the participants personal experience related to COVID-19. The researchers then included three sliding scales about the subject\u2019s level of general anxiety / distress associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, and the last question was an open-ended question asking to include any additional information or clarification related to the subject\u2019s emotional responses to COVID-19 9. Statistical analysis: To display the individuals' characteristics and study data, descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, frequencies, and percentages were used. The mean and standard deviation were used to represent quantitative variables, whereas frequencies and percentages were used to represent categorical variables. The relationship between psychological injuries and subject characteristics was assessed using Chi-square statistics. All statistical tests had a significance level of less than 0.05. The statistical program for social studies (SPSS) version 25 for Windows was used for all statistical analysis."

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the psychological impact of COVID-19 among physiotherapists in western KSA. The results revealed that there was bad impact on psychological aspects. The prevalence of anxiety/distress increased by 50% with a significant association with sex. According to this, male physiotherapists had a higher frequency of injuries than female physiotherapists. The results of the current study showed that there is a high prevalence of anxiety/distress associated with the COVID-19 outbreak among physiotherapists. The estimated prevalence was 50%. These results are in line with other studies that illustrated the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the time of COVID-19 among physical therapists. One study was performed in the early months of COVID-19 to study the psychological impact of the epidemic on physiotherapists showed that a significant percentage of physical therapists had symptoms of anxiety and depression. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 32.3 and 18.5% respectively and those percentages are higher than the national prevalence of anxiety and depression which are 9.3% and 5.0%, respectively10. One qualitative study among physical therapists in Spain that involved 30 individuals showed that the COVID-19 outbreak was described by them as an unexpected war. It was common to identify them as the call of duty and working in wartime. The study reached a conclusion that the healthcare system was not prepared for such an epidemic. This led to a significantly\nstressful effect on all frontline health care professionals that needed well-planned and organized support 11. Our results are in line with other studies that showed a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in the time of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. The negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among healthcare personnel was confirmed in a systematic review that focused on Asia. The study showed that COVID-19 was associated with having mental exhaustion, burnout, fear, depression, and anxiety among healthcare workers. Moreover, it showed that those psychological impacts might have affected patient safety12. The high prevalence of anxiety among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed by a systematic review with metaanalysis performed by Santab\u00e1rbara et al. (2021)13 and included 71 studies. They estimated the prevalence of anxiety among healthcare workers to be 25%. The highest prevalence was among frontline healthcare workers, 34% while that among nurses was 27% and among doctors was 17%. This study emphasized the importance of providing psychological support to healthcare workers during epidemics especially the frontline workers. Other numerous studies confirmed the significant psychological effect of COVID-19 on health care workers as in a rapid review of the published literature regarding the mental health of health care workers during this pandemic including 87 papers showed variability of the prevalence of different mental problems. The prevalence ranged between 7.0-97.3% for anxiety, 10.6-62.1% for depression, 2.2-93.8% for stress, and 3.8-56.6% for post-traumatic stress. Based on the high prevalence of different psychological illnesses14. In contrary to what was observed in the current study that the occurrence of psychological injury in the form of anxiety and distress was higher in the males than the females, Batra et al., showed higher level of anxiety and depression for females, nurses, and frontline responders. They recommended adopting an intervention to provide psychological support and increased resilience of healthcare workers15. Also, the higher level of anxiety among female healthcare workers was also reported in a study in Turkey by Yildirim et al.16 and in a meta- analysis including 13 studies with total of 33,062 participants17. Our study showed that much physical therapist thought that anxiety/distress related to COVID-19 affected their ability to provide services to patients at different degrees. In line with that, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physiotherapists, their patients, and physiotherapy services has been illustrated by Muhammad and Musa18 who showed that the pandemic affected the physiotherapists mentally, physically, and caused a reduction in the efficiency of treatment. The same effect was also observed\nP J M H S Vol. 16, No. 04, APR 2022 783\nin other countries as 73% of physiotherapists had their work activities interrupted in one study in Portugal19. This effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physiotherapy services led to thinking about solutions to provide the services20. Recommendations: Based on the observed results of the psychological impact during the pandemic, we recommend that each hospital or physiotherapy unit should arrange the workload so that each physical therapist should have a specific number of cases per work shift. We also recommend that work shifts include specified resting times to ensure that the practitioners do not suffer from burnout. During critical situations as pandemics, each hospital should have a psychological support unit that monitors the psychological wellbeing of the healthcare workers and provides the suitable support whenever needed. Limitations: Although important results have been achieved, our research still has some sensitive limitations. The sample does not include all physical therapists working in western Saudi Arabia. More than half of the samples come from Mecca."
