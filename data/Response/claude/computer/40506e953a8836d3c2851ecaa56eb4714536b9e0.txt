 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on semi-supervised 3D object detection:

1. Explore different teacher-student frameworks and consistency regularization methods. The paper uses a simple EMA teacher with PV-RCNN, but more advanced teacher-student frameworks like Mean Teacher could be explored. Different consistency losses like KL divergence on output distributions could also be tested.

2. Investigate more advanced dense pseudo-label generation techniques. The paper uses a simple strategy of keeping all teacher detections, but more selective and smarter dense generation methods could help improve pseudo-label quality. 

3. Try combining with external data or modalities. The method relies only on LiDAR point clouds, but combining with RGB images or leveraging external datasets could provide useful additional signals.

4. Apply to other 3D perception tasks like segmentation or motion forecasting. The overall framework of dense pseudo-labels and dynamic thresholds could potentially benefit other self-driving perception tasks beyond just object detection.

5. Deploy and evaluate on real self-driving systems. While results are shown on KITTI, testing the approach on a real autonomous vehicle stack and evaluating performance gains on real road driving could better demonstrate real-world impact.
