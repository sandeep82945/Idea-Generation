    "abstractText": "We theoretically investigate asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher Josephson harmonics. Our main focus is on the \u201cminimal model\u201d with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the other one featuring additional second harmonic. The current-voltage characteristic (CVC) turns out to be asymmetric, I(\u2212V ) \u0338= \u2212I(V ). The asymmetry is due to the presence of the second harmonic and depends on the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop, vanishing only at special values of the flux such as integer or half-integer in the units of the flux quantum. The system thus demonstrates the flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (JDE), the simplest manifestations of which is the direction dependence of the critical current. We analyze asymmetry of the overall I(V ) shape both in the absence and in the presence of external ac irradiation. In the voltage-source case of external signal, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro spikes. The integer spikes are asymmetric (manifestation of the JDE) while the half-integer spikes remain symmetric. In the current-source case, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro steps. The JDE manifests itself in asymmetry of the overall CVC shape, including integer and half-integer steps.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe diode effect in electronic charge transport is fundamentally important from the scientific point of view, and finds numerous applications in devices like rectifiers, filters, and current converters [1]. At present, its superconducting version, the superconducting diode effect (SDE) is being actively studied both theoretically and experimentally. This topic is particularly interesting because the SDE (nonreciprocity of supercurrent) can arise in various physical systems due to different mechanisms.\nFirst, the SDE can arise in bulk (extended) superconducting systems [2\u201310]. The necessary ingredients are\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n10 85\n6v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nup r-\nco n]\n9 D\nec 2\n02 3\n2 usually broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, which can be realized, e.g., due to magnetic field (or exchange field in ferromagnets) and spin-orbit coupling. Topological materials and materials without a center of inversion can be advantageous for achieving the necessary requirements; breaking of the inversion symmetry can also be achieved due to artificial structuring [11, 12]. The SDE can also be realized due to vortices pinned or controlled by various types of asymmetric forces (asymmetric configurations of magnetic field, asymmetric traps, or asymmetric surface barriers) [13\u201318]; in the context of vortex motion the SDE is often referred to as the ratchet effect. (At the same time, to avoid misunderstanding, we note that the physics we are discussing now is different from the stochastic ratchet effect that arises in nonequi-\nlibrium dynamics of nonlinear systems with asymmetric potential [19, 20]. In those systems, a directed transport can arise due to noise even in the absence of a bias. We do not consider noise effects in this paper.)\nSecond, similar physical mechanisms [21\u201328] or certain charging effects [29\u201331] can lead to the SDE in Josephson junctions (JJs); in this context it can be called the Josephson diode effect (JDE). This bring the rich physics of the Josephson effect [32, 33] into play. Asymmetry of the Josephson effect with respect to the current direction implies realization of the JDE.\nAdditional versatility arises in SQUIDs, the Josephson systems of interferometer type [32, 33]. A system of this type is shown in Fig. 1(a); the interferometer loop contains two JJs and is threaded by magnetic flux \u03a6. The up-down asymmetry of such a system (asymmetry between junctions a and b) in the presence of magnetic flux may lead to the left-right asymmetry for the current (the JDE). This is exemplified by SQUIDs with asymmetry of effective inductances included into the two interferometer arms [32, 34, 35] or with an additional JJ included into one of the arms [36].\nAlternatively, the up-down asymmetry of the SQUID may be caused by higher Josephson harmonics in the (super)current-phase relation (CPR) of the JJs constituting the SQUID [37\u201339]. In this paper, we develop analytical methods allowing us to describe the current-voltage characteristic (CVC) of asymmetric SQUIDs both in the absence and in the presence of external irradiation. We analytically prove and characterize the JDE in asymmetric SQUIDs with higher Josephson harmonics, supporting our analytical results by numerical calculations.\nThe higher Josephson harmonics (contributions to the supercurrent of the form sinn\u03c6 with n > 1, where \u03c6 is the superconducting phase difference across a JJ) naturally arise in various types of JJs with not too low transparencies of their weak-link regions [33, 40]. Even if the two JJs in a SQUID are of the same type, they can have different CPRs due to variations of parameters if the weak link is represented by, e.g., a constriction (point contact) or a normal metal. Additional versatility is provided by JJs with ferromagnetic weak links, in which the first harmonic can be suppressed due to vicinity of\nIa(\u03c6)\nIb(\u03c6)\n(a)\n\u03a6\n-\u03c0 0 \u03c0-Ic0\nIc +\n\u03c6\nI s (b) Ic +\nIc -\n0 0.5 10\n1\n2\n\u03a6/\u03a60\nI c /I a1\n(c)\nFIG. 1. (a) Asymmetric SQUID with different (generally nonsinusoidal) CPRs Ia(\u03c6) and Ib(\u03c6) in the two JJs. The \u201cminimal model\u201d demonstrating the JDE is defined by Eqs. (15) and (20). (b) CPR for the \u201cminimal model\u201d of an asymmetric\nhigher-harmonic SQUID, see Eq. (21), at A = 0.5, \u03d5\u0303 = 0.4\u03c0. Note that I+c \u0338= I\u2212c , which is a manifestation of the JDE. (c) Magnetic interference pattern in the case of Ib1/Ia1 = 0.8, Ib2/Ia1 = 0.5. The JDE is absent only at such values of the flux \u03a6 that sin \u03d5\u0303 = 0 (see Sec. VIII for discussion of relation\nbetween the phase shift \u03d5\u0303 and the normalized flux \u03d5); those values correspond to crossings between the I+c and I \u2212 c curves. At all other values of \u03a6, we find I+c \u0338= I\u2212c , which is a manifestation of the JDE. The magnetic field influences the diode efficiency (determined by |I+c \u2212I\u2212c |) and switches the polarity of the JDE (between positive one with I+c > I \u2212 c and negative one with I+c < I \u2212 c ).\nthe 0-\u03c0 transition [41\u201345]. Recently, SQUIDs with hightransparency JJs have been realized and the presence of higher harmonics in their CPR has been experimentally demonstrated [46]. This certifies that the system that we study can be realized in experiment. Importantly, realization of asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUIDs does not require exotic materials. At the same time, alternatively, such SQUIDs can effectively be realized with the help of topological materials due to asymmetry between the current-carrying edge states [22]. In this case, the role of the two JJs in the SQUID is played by the two edge channels.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we formulate general equations of the RSJ model suitable for describing the SQUIDs with higher Josephson harmonics. In Sec. III, we formulate the minimal model of an asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID demonstrating the JDE. The model is characterized by sinusoidal contributions to the CPRs in both the JJs and, additionally, the second-harmonic contribution in one of them. In Sec. IV, we analyze the CVC of our minimal model in the limit of large current. In Sec. V, we analyze the CVC in the limit of small second harmonic. In Secs. VI and VII, we consider the Shapiro spikes and Shapiro steps, respectively, in the presence of external irradiation. In Sec. VIII, we discuss the obtained results. In Sec. IX, we present our\n3 conclusions. Finally, some details of calculations are presented in the Appendices."

The time dependence is assumed to enter only through \u03c6(t), which implies adiabatic approximation [48].\nThe natural unit of frequency in this model is\n\u03c90 = 2eI1R/\u210f, (1)\nand we define dimensionless time, total current, and voltage bias as\n\u03c4 = \u03c90t, j = I/I1, v = V/I1R, (2)\nrespectively. The second Josephson relation (between voltage and phase) and the RSJ equation (for the phase) then take the form\nv = \u03c6\u0307, (3)\n\u03c6\u0307+ sin\u03c6 = j (4)\n(dot here stands for d/d\u03c4). In the regime of fixed current, at |j| < 1, we have the stationary Josephson effect, with time-independent phase determined from relation sin\u03c6 = j. At |j| > 1, the Josephson effect is nonstationary (corresponding to the time-dependent \u03c6), and Eq. (4) can be integrated, which results in [49]\n\u03c6(\u03c4) = 2 arctan [ 1 + \u03bd tan(\u03bd\u03c4/2)\u221a\n\u03bd2 + 1\n] + 2\u03c0n, (5)\nv(\u03c4) = j2 \u2212 1\nj + cos(\u03bd\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b1) , (6)\nwhere \u03bd = \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1, cos\u03b1 = 1/j, sin\u03b1 = \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1/j. (7)\nHere, we have used our freedom to choose the integration constant, fixing the initial time (or, equivalently, fixing the phase of the Josephson oscillations). In Eq. (7), we have used notation\n\u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 \u2261 sgn(j) \u221a j2 \u2212 1, (8)\nwhere \u221a . . . is a positive quantity. This sign convention\nallows us to consider the CVC [49\u201351]\nv = \u03bd (9)\n[where the overline stands for time-averaging of v(\u03c4)] as an odd function defined both at positive and negative j. Note that while Eq. (9) can be obtained directly as a result of time averaging of Eq. (6), this relation is actually a general relation for periodic processes. Indeed, if we have a periodic variation of v with period T and frequency \u03bd = 2\u03c0/T (so that after time T the bias v returns to its initial value, while \u03c6 changes by 2\u03c0), then from the general Josephson relation (3) we find\nv = 1\nT \u222b T 0 vd\u03c4 = 1 T \u03c6(\u03c4) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223T 0 = \u03bd. (10)\nIn Eq. (5), the arctangent is 2\u03c0/\u03bd-periodic while the overall growth of \u03c6(\u03c4) with time is described by the staircase function\nn(\u03c4) = \u230a\u03bd\u03c4/2\u03c0\u2309 , (11)\nwhere \u230a. . .\u2309 denotes rounding to the nearest integer."

At the same time, in a SQUID, at \u03d5 \u0338= 0 mod \u03c0, the two critical currents are different in the general case. A system with I+c \u0338= I\u2212c can be called a superconducting Josephson diode as this implies nonreciprocal properties of the supercurrent.\nActually, in a SQUID, I+c = I \u2212 c only in certain special cases, e.g., (a) in a symmetric SQUID with Ia(\u03c6) = Ib(\u03c6) (at arbitrary number and amplitudes of the harmonics), (b) in the case when Ia(\u03c6) and Ib(\u03c6) are both described by the same single harmonic (with arbitrary amplitudes in the two junctions).\nThe most practical example of case (b) is when Ia(\u03c6) and Ib(\u03c6) are both sinusoidal. The SQUID can then be asymmetric, so that the critical currents of the two JJ are different; the SQUID is anyway characterized by I+c = I \u2212 c in this case. In order to consider nonreciprocal effect with direction-dependent critical current, we consider the simplest asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID with\nIa(\u03c6) = Ia1 sin\u03c6, Ib(\u03c6) = Ib1 sin\u03c6+ Ib2 sin 2\u03c6. (20)\nDifferent harmonic content of the two CPRs is already sufficient for the JDE. So, inclusion of the higher (second) harmonic in addition to the first one in only one of the junctions can be considered as a \u201cminimal model\u201d of the SQUID diode [37\u201339], see Fig. 1.\n-3 -2 -1 1 2 3 v 1\n2\n3\nj\n-1 -2 -3\nA =\n0 0.5 1\nFIG. 2. CVC of the \u201cminimal model\u201d, see Eq. (21), of the asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID at \u03d5\u0303 = \u03c0/2 and at different amplitudes A of the second harmonic. The dashed line corresponds to the ohmic law j = v. The asymmetry of the CVC curves, j(\u2212v) \u0338= \u2212j(v), is a manifestation of the JDE.\nWe normalize the CPR of the SQUID, Eq. (15), by the amplitude of the first harmonic, Eq. (18). We also shift the phase \u03c6 by \u03b3, so that the sum of the first harmonics produces sin\u03c6 after normalization, see Eq. (17) (the shift can be considered as a redefinition of the phase, which is anyway not important in a dynamical problem in the presence of voltage bias). As a result, we obtain the RSJ equation in the form of Eq. (13) with\nJ(\u03c6) = sin\u03c6+A sin(2\u03c6\u2212 \u03d5\u0303), (21)\nwhere\nA(\u03d5) = Ib2/I1(\u03d5), \u03d5\u0303 = \u03d5+ 2\u03b3(\u03d5). (22)\nHere, \u03d5\u0303 plays the role of effective phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics. The diode effect is present if \u03d5\u0303 \u0338= 0 mod \u03c0, i.e., if \u03d5\u0303 is not an integer multiple of \u03c0, see Fig. 1(c). In particular, this implies \u03d5 \u0338= 0 mod \u03c0. In the case of equal first harmonics, Ia1 = Ib1, the effective phase shift coincides with the normalized flux, \u03d5\u0303 = \u03d5.\nOur model thus requires solving Eqs. (3), (9), (13), and (21). Various quantities entering those equations are, in turn, defined in Eqs. (1), (2), (14), (18), (19), and (22).\nInterestingly, the same form of the CPR, Eq. (21), effectively arises in different physical systems such as combined 0-\u03c0 JJs in magnetic field [55], JJs between exotic superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry [56], and SQUIDs with three sinusoidal JJs in the loop [36]. The asymmetry between I+c and I \u2212 c , and also asymmetry of the magnetic diffraction pattern have been discussed in those contexts.\nThe CVC of our minimal model can be calculated numerically, see Fig. 2. In the next two sections, we develop analytical theory that provides results in the limits cases of either large j or small A.\n5"

In this case, we can search for approximate solutions in certain limiting cases. One important limiting case is when the current is large, |j| \u226b 1. In order to formulate the method capable of treating this limiting case, we first consider the sinusoidaljunction case, and then switch to the general case. Of course, in the sinusoidal case, the exact solution is known at any j [see Eqs. (5)\u2013(8)], so we consider this case simply as a testing ground for our method.\nNote that our model of asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID, see Eq. (21), reduces to the sinusoidal case of Eq. (4) at A = 0. Straightforward perturbation theories often do not work for this type of equations. The problem is that besides oscillations, the solution contains a contribution linearly growing with time; this contribution corresponds to the average voltage bias, see Eq. (3). Any inaccuracy in finding the slope of this linear part immediately leads to linear growth of corrections (calculated in the framework of a straightforward perturbation theory and assumed to be small). We therefore have to develop a perturbation theory which is applicable to Eq. (4) at |j| \u226b 1. Our approach is a development of the idea proposed by Volkov and Nad\u2019 [57] (a similar idea has also been used in the context of the sine-Gordon equation [58])."

Their height is 2J|n|(vac/\u2126), and the spikes are symmetric (their centers lie on the ohmic line j = vdc). In the general case, due to the \u03a6k phase shifts, the spikes become asymmetric (their centers are shifted from the ohmic line). Moreover, asymmetry of the pairs of spikes corresponding to \u00b1vdc appears, which implies that the overall j(vdc) plot (with Shapiro spikes) is not an odd function, which is a manifestation of the JDE.\nThe above consideration is general and does not require smallness of the higher Josephson harmonics. In order to illustrate it in a simpler case, we consider the case of Eq. (21) corresponding to two harmonics (the amplitude A of the second harmonic can be arbitrary). Due to the presence of the second harmonic, the fractional half-integer Shapiro spikes (with k = 2) appear. They are symmetric with respect to the ohmic line, and the maximum and minimum points for the spike at vdc = (n/2)\u2126 (with odd n) are given by\njmax(min) = vdc \u00b1 |AJn(2vac/\u2126)| . (50)\nNote that this result does not depend on the effective phase shift \u03d5\u0303 and, hence, on the magnetic flux \u03d5. At the same time, the integer Shapiro spikes at vdc = n\u2126 are contributed to by two pairs of (k, n) corresponding to the two harmonics, (1, n) and (2, 2n):\njmax(min) = vdc +max(min) \u03c60\n[ J|n|(vac/\u2126) sin\u03c60\n+AJ|2n|(2vac/\u2126) sin(2\u03c60 \u2212 \u03d5\u0303) ] . (51)\nAt \u03d5\u0303 \u0338= 0 mod \u03c0, the absolute values of the maximum and minimum operation in the right-hand side (rhs) of this expression do not coincide, which implies asymmetric vertical shift of the integer spikes (with respect to the ohmic line).

It was shown that the CVC near the Shapiro step had the same form as the CVC at V = 0 in the absence of irradiation. A perturbative approach capable of treating the resonances was proposed by Thompson [59] in the case of the\n8 sinusoidal JJ with J(\u03c6) = sin\u03c6. At the same time, the method is actually rather general and can be applied to any CPR J(\u03c6). Below, we describe such generalization."

Now we apply the same ideas in the situation very close to the original formulation, i.e., in the presence of external driving, see Eq. (52). The difference from the work by Thompson [59] is that we assume arbitrary CPR J(\u03c6) instead of the sinusoidal one.\nWe represent \u03c6(\u03c4) and jdc as series with respect to small jac:\n\u03c6(\u03c4) = \u03c60(\u03c4) + \u03c61(\u03c4) + \u03c62(\u03c4) + . . . , (53)\njdc = j0 + j1 + j2 + . . .

(58)\nIt is important that Fn and hence Dn contain only those \u03c6k that have k < n, which are already known from previous orders of the perturbation theory.\nOur expansion assumes that \u03c6n(\u03c4) with n = 1, 2, . . . are small.

            "text": "In Sec. VIIA, we have developed the perturbation theory with respect to the ac external field (jac). In Eq. (64), \u03c60(\u03c4) is the zeroth order of this perturbation theory (i.e, the solution in the absence of external field). In the case of our asymmetric SQUID model, \u03c60(\u03c4) itself has been studied in Sec. VA by the perturbation theory with respect to small second harmonic (A). Now we combine the two perturbation theories, writing \u03c60(\u03c4) in the first order with respect to A as a sum of the sinusoidal-case solution and the correction of Eq. (40):\n\u03c60(\u03c4) = f0(\u03c4) +Af1(\u03c4). (65)\nIn this order with respect to A, Eq. (64) in the case of n = 1 takes the form\nj1 + jac cos(\u2126\u03c4 + \u03b2)\nf\u03070(\u03c4)\n[ 1\u2212Af\u03071(\u03c4)\nf\u03070(\u03c4)\n] = 0. (66)\nThe average voltage bias given by Eq. (59) is expressed in notation of Sec. VA as v = \u03bd0 = \u00b1 \u221a\ni20 \u2212 1. Considering the sinusoidal-junction case (A = 0) as a\nreference point, we obtain\n[j1 + jac cos(\u2126\u03c4 + \u03b2)][i0 + cos(\u03bd0\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b10)] = 0. (67)\nExcept for the constant part j1i0, nonzero contributions to the left-hand side (lhs) arise only at \u03bd0 = \u00b1\u2126 (phase locking of the oscillating cosines), which corresponds to the first Shapiro steps (positive and negative). In these cases, we obtain\nj1 = \u2212(jac/2i0) cos(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2). (68)\nThe argument of the cosine is the phase difference between the internal Josephson oscillations and the external field. Since this relative phase can be arbitrary, the obtained result corresponds to the vertical segment of the jdc(v) curve of total height jstep = jac/ \u221a \u21262 + 1. This first Shapiro step originates from the first order (n = 1) of the perturbation theory of Sec. VIIA. Next, we take into account the A correction (the second Josephson harmonic) in Eq. (66). The corresponding contribution originates from the f1 function given by Eq. (40). It turns out that for our discussion of the first Shapiro steps in the first order with respect to A,\n9 only the f1s term of f1 is essential [see Eqs. (40)\u2013(44)]. It produces two contributions to Eq. (68) with the order of magnitude Aj1 and Ajac cos(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2), while the f1c and f\u03c41 terms produce contributions of the order of Ajac sin(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2). Determining the height of the Shapiro step, we take cos(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2) = \u00b11 in the main order with respect to A, see Eq. (68). The Ajac sin(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2) corrections in the rhs of Eq. (68) slightly shift the extremal points [such that sin(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2) \u223c A] but this only gives a A2 correction to the height of the Shapiro step. Since we work in the first order with respect to A, we disregard this correction. So, the first-order correction is only produced by the f1s term of f1. Performing the corresponding calculation, we obtain Eq. (68) with corrections of the order of Aj1 and Ajac cos(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2). Determining j1 in the first order with respect to A from the resulting equation, we find\nj1 = \u2212(jac/2i0) cos(\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2) \u00d7 { 1+A sin \u03d5\u0303 [ (2i20\u22121+2i\u221220 ) \u00b1 \u221a i20 \u2212 1\u22122i0(i20\u22121) ]} .\n(69)\nFinally, the height of the first Shapiro steps in the jdc(v) dependence at v = \u00b1\u2126 is\nj (\u00b11) step = jac\u221a \u21262 + 1\n\u00d7 ( 1\u00b1A\u21262\u2126 4 + 3(\u21262 + 1)\u2212 2\u2126(\u21262 + 1)3/2\n\u21262 + 1 sin \u03d5\u0303\n) .\n(70)\nThe heights of the two first Shapiro steps (positive and\nnegative) are different, j (+1) step \u0338= j (\u22121) step . This is a manifestation of the JDE. The asymmetry appears due to the second harmonic of the CPR (A \u0338= 0) and nontrivial phase shift (sin \u03d5\u0303 \u0338= 0). Due to the \u00b1 sign in Eq. (70), one of the steps is higher while the other one is lower than in the absence of the second Josephson harmonic.\nC. The 1/2 Shapiro steps\nDue to the presence of the second harmonic in the CPR, fractional half-integer Shapiro steps [32, 60, 62, 63] should appear in the CVC (note that fractional Shapiro steps can also arise in the case of purely sinusoidal CPR due to chaotic regimes [64]; we do not consider such effects here). The approach of Sec. VIIB can be applied for calculating the first of them, the 1/2 Shapiro steps at \u03bd0 = \u00b1\u2126/2. This calculation takes into account the first orders with respect to jac and A, so Eqs. (65) and (66) are still applicable.\nThe main Josephson harmonic does not produce phase locking in the case of fractional steps, so averaging in Eq. (67) now only yields the trivial contribution j1i0. Next, we take into account the A correction (the second Josephson harmonic) in Eq. (66). The corresponding\ncontribution originates from the f1 function given by Eq. (40). In the case of subharmonic locking that we now discuss, the f1s and f1c terms of f1 [see Eqs. (40)\u2013(44)] are essential while the contribution from f\u03c41 vanishes as a result of averaging. The f1s term produces two contributions to Eq. (66) with the order of magnitude Aj1 and Ajac cos(2\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2), while the f1c term only produces a contribution of the order of Ajac sin(2\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2). Determining j1 in the first order with respect to A from the resulting equation, we find\nj1 = 2Ajac 3\n[ (2i20 \u2212 3) \u00b1 \u221a i20 \u2212 1\u2212 2(i20 \u2212 1)2\ni0 ] \u00d7 sin(\u03d5\u0303+ 2\u03b10 \u00b1 \u03b2). (71)\nFinally, the height of the 1/2 Shapiro steps in the jdc(v) dependence at v = \u00b1\u2126/2 is\nj (\u00b11/2) step = 2Ajac 3 \u2126\n[ 1\u2212 \u2126 2\n2 +\n\u21263\n2 \u221a \u21262 + 4\n] . (72)\nIn the main approximation we thus find steps of equal\nheight, j (+1/2) step = j (\u22121/2) step , which does not depend on \u03d5\u0303 (this resembles the symmetry and flux-independence of the half-integer Shapiro spikes, see Sec. VI). However, since the underlying CVC (in the absence of the ac drive, i.e., at jac = 0) is asymmetric (see Sec. V), it is natural to expect that the Shapiro steps are also generally asymmetric. This effect should take place in higher orders of the perturbation theory."

Both integer and half-integer Shapiro steps (at integer and half-integer v, respectively) are asymmetric due to the presence of the second harmonic of the CPR and nontrivial phase shift \u03d5\u0303 between the two harmonics. The asymmetry jdc(\u2212v) \u0338= \u2212jdc(v) illustrates the JDE.\nSQUID flux \u03d5. At the same time, the \u03d5\u0303(\u03d5) dependence is nontrivial, see Eq. (22). This dependence qualitatively depends on the ratio between the first Josephson harmonics of the two junctions in the SQUID, Ib1/Ia1 [note that in our minimal model, b labels the junction with the second Josephson harmonic, see Eq. (20)].\nThe dependence of sin \u03d5\u0303 on \u03d5 is illustrated in Fig. 5. As long as Ib1/Ia1 < 1, the sine varies between \u22121 and 1 crossing zero at \u201csymmetric\u201d points \u03d5 = 0 mod \u03c0 and also at one additional (\u201caccidental\u201d) point between each two neighboring symmetric points. At Ib1/Ia1 = 1, we obtain \u03d5\u0303 = \u03d5, and the accidental zeros disappear. Then, at Ib1/Ia1 > 1, the form of sin \u03d5\u0303 is like a distorted sin\u03d5 but with suppressed amplitude. The suppression is stronger at larger Ib1/Ia1.\nThe case of Ib1/Ia1 > 1 is therefore less favorable from the point of view of observability of the diode effect. Experimentally, SQUIDs with Ib1/Ia1 \u2a7d 1 are preferable. Then why do we take into account the second Josephson harmonic Ib2 if Ib1 is not large? This may be justified if Ib1 is suppressed not due to interface transparency but due to additional physical mechanisms, e.g., near the 0- \u03c0 transition [41\u201345]. Note that the 0-\u03c0 transition itself\n(sign change of Ib1) only gradually changes the \u03d5\u0303(\u03d5) dependence, and so does not lead to qualitative changes in the diode effect."

            "text": "In the framework of the RSJ model, we have theoretically investigated asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different CPRs in the two JJs, involving higher Josephson harmonics (sinn\u03c6 with n > 1). We focused on the \u201cminimal model\u201d with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing purely sinusoidal current-phase relation (with n = 1) and the other one featuring additional second harmonic (with n = 2), see Eq. (20). The (normalized) CPR of the SQUID then takes the form of Eq. (21). The\neffective phase shift \u03d5\u0303 between the Josephson harmonics depends on the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop. Due to the presence of the second Josephson harmonic (A \u0338= 0), the CVC turns out to be asymmetric, I(\u2212V ) \u0338= \u2212I(V ), in the cases when sin \u03d5\u0303 \u0338= 0. The system thus demonstrates the JDE, the simplest manifestations of which is the direction dependence of the critical current, I+c \u0338= I\u2212c . We employ a combination of perturbative methods to analytically describe asymmetry of the CVC, and then confirm our findings by numerical calculations in more general cases. Efficiency of the JDE and its polarity are determined by \u03d5\u0303 and thus depend on the external magnetic flux. We analytically demonstrate asymmetry of the overall I(V ) dependence in the limit of large current or small second harmonic in the absence of external ac irradiation. In the presence of external irradiation of frequency \u03c9, phase locking of the external signal and the internal Josephson oscillations leads to peculiarities of the CVC at V = (n/k)\u210f\u03c9/2e. In the voltage-source case of external signal, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro spikes [on the background of the linear ohmic I(V ) dependence]. The integer spikes (with integer n/k) are asymmetric, which is a manifestation of the JDE. The half-integer spikes (with half-integer n/k) remain symmetric. In the current-source case, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro steps. This case is more complicated for analytical consideration, and we consider it perturbatively with respect to the amplitude of the ac drive and of the second Josephson harmonic, and also numerically. Both integer and half-integer Shapiro steps are asymmetric, which is a manifestation of the JDE.\n11\nAt present, systems of the considered type can be experimentally realized. We hope that our results will stimulate experimental research in this direction."

Third order\nIn the third order, taking into account that some lower-order coefficients are already found to be zero, we can write \u03c3 = ( a (0) 1 + a (2) 1 ) C1 + b (2) 1 S1 + a (1) 2 C2 + ( b (0) 2 + b (1) 2 ) S2 + a (0) 3 C3 + b (0) 3 S3, (A18)\nand the lhs of Eq.

(A19)\nNow, in Eq. (A15), in cos\u03c3 and sin\u03c3 we must retain only the second-order contributions:\n(cos\u03c3) (2) = \u2212 ( \u03c32 )(2) /2 = \u2212 ( a (0) 1 C1 )2 /2, (A20) (sin\u03c3) (2)\n= \u03c3(2) = b (0) 2 S2. (A21)\nFrom Eq. (A15) we then obtain\nrhs(3) = (S1 + S3)/4j 3. (A22)\nComparing the coefficients in front of Sn and Cn in Eqs. (A19) and (A22), we find\n\u03bd\u2032(3) = 0, a (2) 1 = 1/4j 3, a (0) 3 = \u22121/12j3, b (2) 1 = a (1) 2 = b (1) 2 = b (0) 3 = 0. (A23)\n4.

(A27)\nFrom Eq. (A15) we then obtain\nrhs(4) = \u2212(1\u2212 C4)/8j4. (A28)\nComparing the coefficients in front of Sn and Cn in Eqs.

Summary\nThe algorithm formulated above can be continued up to any order. What we have obtained considering the four orders, may be summarized in terms of frequency \u03bd\u2032 = \u03bd\u2032(0) + \u03bd\u2032(2) + \u03bd\u2032(4). Rescaling back to the dimensionless frequency \u03bd [see Eq. (A1)], we obtain Eq. (24).\nAppendix B: Asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID: details of the harmonic perturbation theory\nThe CPR for our model of asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUID is given by Eq. (21). The RSJ equation (13) then takes the form\n\u03c6\u0307 = j \u2212 sin\u03c6\u2212A sin(2\u03c6\u2212 \u03d5\u0303). (B1) We rescale time and frequency according to Eq. (A1), so that\nd\u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032)/d\u03c4 \u2032 = 1\u2212 [ sin\u03c6+A sin(2\u03c6\u2212 \u03d5\u0303) ] /j. (B2)\nWe consider |j| \u226b 1 and do not make any assumptions about A. In the case of Eq. (B2), the first and second harmonics in Eq. (A5) should then be considered as being of the same order with respect to 1/j (since the second harmonics of solution are directly generated by the second Josephson harmonic in the CPR). The zeroth order is \u03bd\u2032(0) = 1.\n1. First order\nIn the first order (with respect to 1/j), we have\n\u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032) = \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 + \u03c3(1), \u03c3(1) = a (0) 1 C1 + b (0) 1 S1 + a (\u22121) 2 C2 + b (\u22121) 2 S2, (B3)\nwhere negative indices in the coefficients of the second harmonic are introduced in order to comply with the ordercounting rules (A7)\u2013(A8).\nThe lhs of Eq. (B2) in this order takes the form\nd\u03c6(1)/d\u03c4 \u2032 = \u03bd\u2032(1) \u2212 a(0)1 S1 + b (0) 1 C1 \u2212 2a (\u22121) 2 S2 + 2b (\u22121) 2 C2. (B4)\nWriting the rhs of Eq. (B2) in the same order, we obtain simply rhs(1) = \u2212 [ sin \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 +A sin(2\u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03d5\u0303) ] /j = \u2212 ( S1 +AS2 cos \u03d5\u0303\u2212AC2 sin \u03d5\u0303 ) /j. (B5)\nComparing the coefficients in front of Sn and Cn in Eqs. (B4) and (B5), we find\n\u03bd\u2032(1) = 0, a (0) 1 = 1/j, b (0) 1 = 0, a (\u22121) 2 = A cos(\u03d5\u0303)/2j, b (\u22121) 2 = A sin(\u03d5\u0303)/2j. (B6)\n2. Second order\nNow we consider the second order taking into account the third and the fourth harmonics in Eq. (A5) as well as contributions of the same order to the coefficients of the first and the second harmonics:\n\u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032) = \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 + \u03c3(1) + \u03c3(2), \u03c3(2) = a (1) 1 C1 + b (1) 1 S1 + a (0) 2 C2 + b (0) 2 S2 + a (\u22121) 3 C3 + b (\u22121) 3 S3 + a (\u22122) 4 C4 + b (\u22122) 4 S4,\n(B7)\nd\u03c6(2)/d\u03c4 \u2032 = \u03bd\u2032(2) \u2212 a(1)1 S1 + b (1) 1 C1 \u2212 2a (0) 2 S2 + 2b (0) 2 C2 \u2212 3a (\u22121) 3 S3 + 3b (\u22121) 3 C3 \u2212 4a (\u22122) 4 S4 + 4b (\u22122) 4 C4. (B8)\nWriting the rhs of Eq. (B2) in the same order, we obtain rhs(2) = \u2212 [ \u03c3(1) cos \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 + 2A\u03c3(1) cos(2\u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03d5\u0303) ] /j\n= \u2212 [ (1 +A2) + C2 + (5A/2) ( C1 cos \u03d5\u0303+ S1 sin \u03d5\u0303+ C3 cos \u03d5\u0303+ S3 sin \u03d5\u0303 ) +A2 ( C4 cos 2\u03d5\u0303+ S4 sin 2\u03d5\u0303 )] /2j2. (B9)\nComparing the coefficients in front of Sn and Cn in Eqs. (B8) and (B9), we find\n\u03bd\u2032(2) = \u2212(1 +A2)/2j2, a(1)1 = 5A sin(\u03d5\u0303)/4j2, b (1) 1 = \u22125A cos(\u03d5\u0303)/4j2, a (0) 2 = 0, b (0) 2 = \u22121/4j2,\na (\u22121) 3 = 5A sin(\u03d5\u0303)/12j 2, b (\u22121) 3 = \u22125A cos(\u03d5\u0303)/12j2, a (\u22122) 4 = A 2 sin(2\u03d5\u0303)/8j2, b (\u22122) 4 = \u2212A2 cos(2\u03d5\u0303)/8j2. (B10)\n14\n3. Third order\nThe third order leads to longer expressions, but we will be interested in finding \u03bd\u2032(3) only. This quantity originates from the lhs of Eq. (B2), while in the rhs of Eq. (B2) it is sufficient to keep \u03c3(1) and \u03c3(2) only. Indeed,\nrhs(3) = [( \u03c3(1) )2 sin \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 2\u03c3(2) cos \u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 + 4A ( \u03c3(1) )2 sin(2\u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03d5\u0303)\u2212 4A\u03c3(2) cos(2\u03bd\u2032\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 \u03d5\u0303) ] /2j. (B11)\nThe constant (not containing Sn and Cn) part of rhs (3) is then easily found from this expression, and the result is \u03bd\u2032(3) = \u22123A sin(\u03d5\u0303)/4j3."

            "text": "In the case of zero effective phase shift (\u03d5\u0303 = 0), we rewrite Eq. (C1) as\n\u03c4 = 2L/j, L =\n\u222b x2 + 1\nP (x) dx, (C2) P (x) = (x2 + 1) ( x2 + 1\u2212 2x/j ) + 4Ax(x2 \u2212 1)/j.\nThe fourth-order polynomial P (x) has two pairs of complex-conjugate roots: a, a\u2217, b, and b\u2217. At A = 0, the two upper-half-plane roots are\na0 = i, b0 = ( 1 + i \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 ) /j. (C3)\nSo, a in the limit A \u2192 0 becomes a \u201ctrivial\u201d root, it is actually eliminated in this limit [due to the numerator under the integral in Eq. (C2)], and the behavior of the sinusoidal junction is fully governed by the nontrivial b root. At nonzero A, we have\nL =\n\u222b x2 + 1\n(x\u2212 a)(x\u2212 a\u2217)(x\u2212 b)(x\u2212 b\u2217) dx. (C4)\nExpanding the integrand into elementary fractions, we find L = Lab + Lba, where\nLab = 1\nIm a Im [ (a2 + 1) ln(x\u2212 a) (a\u2212 b)(a\u2212 b\u2217) ] , (C5)\nand Lba is obtained from Lab after interchanging a \u2194 b. Our variable x = tan(\u03c6/2) sweeps the whole real axis when \u03c6 changes from \u2212\u03c0 to \u03c0. Further increase of \u03c6must be accompanied by a branch switching of the logarithm [that enters Eq. (C5)], so that the L(\u03c6) function grows on average. In order to establish the correct branch choice, we can make a step back to the purely sinusoidal case (A = 0). In this case, Lab (which corresponds to the a0 poles) vanishes, and only the Lba contributes to L, which then takes the form\nL0 = Im [ln(x\u2212 b0)] / Im b0. (C6)\nConsidering the logarithm in the complex plane with the (\u2212\u221e, 0] cut, so that\narg z = \u2212 arctan(Re z/ Im z) + (\u03c0/2) sgn(Im z), (C7)\nwe find\nL0 = 1\nIm b0\n( arctan\nx\u2212 Re b0 Im b0 \u2212 \u03c0 2\n) , (C8)\nwhich finally yields\n\u03c4 = 2 \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1\n( \u03c0n\u03c6 + arctan\nj tan\u03c6/2\u2212 1 \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1\n) , (C9)\nwith n\u03c6 = \u230a\u03c6/2\u03c0\u2309 [note that we have eliminated the last \u03c0/2 term in Eq. (C8) since it can be absorbed into the integration constant \u03c40]. Of course, this result reproduces Eq. (5).\n15\nReturning to the case of nonzero A, we calculate L taking into account the branch switching of the arg function. As a result, instead of Eq. (C9) we now find\n\u03c4 = Aab ( \u03c0n\u03c6 + arctan\ntan\u03c6/2\u2212 Re a Im a ) +Aba ( \u03c0n\u03c6 + arctan\ntan\u03c6/2\u2212 Re b Im b\n) +B ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 tan\u03c6/2\u2212 atan\u03c6/2\u2212 b \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223,\n(C10)\nwhere\nAab = ReC, B = ImC, C = 2(a2 + 1)\nj Im(a)(a\u2212 b)(a\u2212 b\u2217) ,\n(C11) and Aba is obtained from Aab after interchanging a \u2194 b.\nAt n \u2192 \u221e, we thus have the asymptotic behavior \u03c6 \u2243 2\u03c0n\u03c6 (by definition of n\u03c6) and \u03c4 \u2243 (Aab+Aba)\u03c0n\u03c6 [from Eq. (C10)], hence we find the average voltage bias\nv = lim \u03c4\u2192\u221e \u03c6(\u03c4)/\u03c4 = 2/(Aab +Aba). (C12)\nThe results of Eqs. (C10) and (C12) are general in the sense that the second-harmonic amplitude A can be arbitrary. We have expressed the result in terms of the roots of the P (x) polynomial. Now, we consider the case of small A. Up to the second order with respect to A, the roots of P (x) are\na = i+ 2iA+A2(2i\u2212 4j), (C13) b = (1\u2212 2A) ( 1 + i \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 ) /j +A2j ( 4\u2212 2i/ \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 ) ,\nhence\nAab = 24jA 2, B = \u22124A, (C14) Aba = 2/ \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1\u2212 4(6j4 \u2212 9j2 + 2)A2/ \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 3 .\nEquation (C12) then yields\nv = \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1 \u2212 2A2 [ 6j(j2 \u2212 1) \u2212 6j\n4 \u2212 9j2 + 2 \u00b1 \u221a j2 \u2212 1\n] .\n(C15)\nTo test this result, we can consider the limit |j| \u226b 1, in which case Eq. (C15) reproduces the \u03d5\u0303 = 0 limit of Eq. (26) in the order 1/j2 (up to which the comparison is possible).\n2. \u03c6(\u03c4)\nAs we have seen in the previous subsection, knowledge of the (inverse) \u03c4(\u03c6) dependence is sufficient for studying the CVC in the case of fixed current. At the same time, inverting the dependence given by Eq. (C10) in order to obtain the direct \u03c6(\u03c4) function (which is required, e.g., for calculating the Shapiro steps) cannot be performed in the general case.\nNevertheless, this inverting can be done perturbatively in the case of small A. Below we illustrate this procedure in the first order with respect to A. We write Eq. (C10) as an expansion with respect to A:\n\u03c4 = g0(\u03c6) +Ag1(\u03c6). (C16)\nWe want to invert Eq. (C16) as\n\u03c6 = f0(\u03c4) +Af1(\u03c4). (C17)\nIn the zeroth order, g0(\u03c6) is given by Eq. (C9), and its inverse f0(\u03c4) is given by Eq. (5). Substituting Eq. (C17) into Eq. (C16) and expanding up to the first order, we obtain\n\u03c4 = g0(f0(\u03c4)) + g \u2032 0(f0(\u03c4))Af1(\u03c4) +Ag1(f0(\u03c4)). (C18)\nConsidering the terms of the first order, we find\nf1(\u03c4) = \u2212g1/g\u20320, (C19)\nwhere the derivative is taken with respect to \u03c6, and finally f0(\u03c4) is substituted as the argument in the rhs. Since g\u20320(\u03c6) = 1/(j \u2212 sin\u03c6), we find\ng\u20320(f0(\u03c4)) = (1 + cos\u03b1 cos \u03b8(\u03c4)) cos\u03b1/ sin 2 \u03b1, (C20)\nwhere \u03b8(\u03c4) = \u03bd\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b1. From Eq. (C10), we find\ng1(\u03c6) = \u22122 [ln(jg\u20320) + 1\u2212 jg\u20320] , (C21)\nand Eq. (C19) finally leads to the following explicit result of the inversion procedure:\nf1(\u03c4) = 2\n1 + cos\u03b1 cos \u03b8(\u03c4)\n[ \u2212 cos\u03b1\u2212 cos \u03b8(\u03c4)\n+ sin2 \u03b1\ncos\u03b1 ln\n( 1 + cos\u03b1 cos \u03b8(\u03c4)\nsin2 \u03b1\n)] . (C22)\nNote that this result reproduces Eq. (40) in the case of\n\u03d5\u0303 = 0 if we choose the free constant \u03c41 in Eq. (40) according to cos \u03b8(\u03c41) = \u2212 cos\u03b1."

(D1) by eia\n16\nand taking the imaginary part (in the case of real a and z), we find\nsin(a+ z sin\u03c6) = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e Jn(z) sin(a+ n\u03c6)\n= \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e (\u22121)nJn(z) sin(a\u2212 n\u03c6). (D2)\nThis leads to Eq. (48).\n[1] A. Malvino, D. Bates, and P. Hoppe, Electronic Principles (McGraw Hill, New York, 2020). [2] M. A. Silaev, A. Yu. Aladyshkin, M. V. Silaeva, and A. S.
