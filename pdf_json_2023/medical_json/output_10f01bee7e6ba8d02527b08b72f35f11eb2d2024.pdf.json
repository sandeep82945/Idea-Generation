As a result, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) becomes a common form of micronutrient deficiency [4].\nGood vitamin A consumption refers to the intake of foods rich in vitamin A at least one\nfood item among the main type of food items while VAD is the result of two primary factors, high frequency of infections, and poverty-related problems [5]. Moreover, socio-cultural limitations and poor absorption leading to impoverished vitamin A stores in the body have been regarded as potential determinants of the prevalence of VAD [6].\nA deficiency of vitamin A in the mother leads to low levels of vitamin A in breast milk,\ninadequate dietary intake of vitamin A during and after weaning, and prevalent illness causes of vitamin A deficiency in young children [7]. The quality and variety of foods reflect the adequacy of vitamin A. The quality of the diet and vitamin A levels are declining in mothers and young children. This is likely the result of changing diets to include foods of animal origin with lower levels of vitamin A and, to a lesser extent, vegetables and fruits [8].\nChildren and their mothers are most susceptible to its consequences, which include a range of VADD [7,9]. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 124 million children require vitamin A [10]. Children require extra vitamin A because they are not consuming enough in their normal diet. Whereas, food items with inadequate vitamin A lead to depletion of serum vitamin A levels which affects tissue development, metabolism, and resistance to infections [6]. Also, lack of vitamin A is a risk factor for blindness and mortality from measles and diarrhea in children aged 6 to 59 months [5,10\u201313]. One study found that a significantly greater proportion of subjects who had VAD were hospitalized, compared to those who were not deficient. The only person who died was with impaired vitamin A [14].\nA deficiency can be effectively prevented in a complementary manner through approaches\nthat include supplementation, fortification, biofortification, and improving dietary diversity, with the choice of approaches guided by urgency, epidemiological patterns, and local resources [6,9,13,15].\nThe prevalence of VAD has declined worldwide, possibly due to widespread vitamin A supple-\nmentation in combination with measles vaccination in at-risk populations [3]. While Vitamin A deficiency affects the poorest segments of the population, particularly those in low- and middleincome countries [9,13,16\u201318]. Therefore, in low- and middle-income countries, routine vitamin\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281681 February 16, 2023 2 / 15\nA supplementation (VAS) is a key strategy to reduce vitamin A deficiency, mortality, and morbidity in preschool children [19]. VAS is an effective strategy for preventing vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) but does not sustainably improve the vitamin A status of a population, does not address underlying causes, and does not reach women of reproductive age [9].\nEstimates indicate that the new supplementation regimen will permit a typical child in a developing country setting to attain minimally adequate vitamin A stores during the first 2 years of life [7]. Furthermore, Improved vitamin A nurture alone could prevent 1.3\u20132.5 million of the nearly 8 million late infancy and preschool-age child deaths that occur each year in the highest-risk developing countries [20]. Effective and long-term control of vitamin A deficiency may be among the most cost-effective and effective interventions for child survival [12].\nControlling vitamin A deficiency is a public health imperative [21]. To deal with vitamin A\ninsufficiency, policymakers view dietary modification that leads to the consumption of vitamin A-rich foods as the safest and most appropriate long-term measure to control vitamin A deficiency [22].\nHowever, some cultural beliefs limit good consumption of vitamin A-rich foods, and ade-\nquate consumption of vitamin A-rich foods is also compromised by the cost of these foods, as well as by local cooking, storage, preservation techniques, and seasonality of these foods [23]. The availability of foods with high levels of vitamin A is often seasonal. For example, in some regions, the rainy season is marked by abundant wild leafy vegetables. When liver retinol reserves are low or vitamin A status is compromised by illness, seasonal fluctuations may cause periods of higher risk of deficiency of vitamin A [24].\nVAD is a major global public health problem that makes a significant contribution to the\nglobal burden of disease [3]. Moreover, it remains a major public health issue in underserved and undernourished areas of the world [9].\nVitamin A deficiency is very common in the African continent. Vitamin A deficiency affects\nmore than 30 million children, most of whom are younger than five years of age [25]. Among the many challenges Africa will have to face in the next few years, vitamin A deficiency can be overcome considering that the need is urgent and that solutions are known, effective, and affordable [12]. In 2013, the prevalence of deficiency was highest in sub-Saharan Africa [10].\nIn many Eastern and Southern African countries, between one-third and half of the chil-\ndren suffer from VAD [15]. VAD is a major nutritional public health problem in children under the age of five in developing countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa [26,27]. Whereas, VAD is a serious health problem in East Africa. The main reason for the high rate of vitamin A deficiency is an inadequate diet. Much of the population does not consume enough food to meet its calorie requirements, and the variety and nutritional quality of the food are often poor. In addition, the high frequency of infectious diseases raises the risk of vitamin A deficiency [15]. While 62% of children aged 6\u201323 months had poor vitamin A food intake in Ethiopia [17,28,29].\nEven though good Vitamin A consumption has a significant contribution to the reduction\nof morbidity and mortality of infants and children, as far as our knowledge is concerned, there is no study regarding the magnitude and determinants of good Vitamin A consumption in East African countries. Thus, this study is conducted to determine the magnitude and determinants of good Vitamin A consumption in twelve East African countries."

Of these 20,304(62.91%) with a 95% confidence interval, 62.37% to 63.43% consumed good vitamin A in the 12 East Africa Countries. The largest number of children age 6 to 23 months 5,576 (17.28%) were from Kenya and the smallest number of children aged 6 to 23 months 870 (2.70%) were from Comoros. The majority of the 24,765 (76.73%) respondents were rural residents. The median age group of study respondents was 28 years with an interquartile range of 24 to 34 years with almost half of them 14,976 (46.40%) under the category of the age group of 25 to 34. The majority of study participants 23,436 (72.61%) were married. Almost half of the study participants 16,162 (50.08%) had a primary\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281681 February 16, 2023 5 / 15\nlevel of education. The higher proportion of good vitamin A consumption 80.84% was recorded in Burundi and the smallest good vitamin A consumption recorded at 34.12% was recorded in Kenya (Table 1, Figs 1 and 2).\nMultilevel logistic regression analysis\nThe random-effects analysis result. Fixed effects and random interceptions for good\nvitamin A intake are shown in Table 1. The results of the null model (Model I) showed statistically significant variability in the odds of vitamin A intake with community variance (t = 0.417, p-value = p< 0.001). Likewise, the ICC in the null model implied that 11.27% of the total variance of good vitamin A intake was due to differences between communities. While community variance was expressed as the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and the median odds ratio (MOR). The MOR was also 2.11 (95% CI 1.98.2.26). This suggests that the likelihood of having a child with good vitamin A intake was 2.11 times higher when respondents moved from low-risk to high-risk communities. This has shown a significant heterogeneity in vitamin A consumption between different communities. In the full model (adjusted for individual and community factors), the community variance (community variance = 0.082; SE = 0.012; P-value, 0.001) remained significant but decreased. Approximately 2.45% of the total variance of good vitamin A intake that can be attributed to contextual factors remained significant even after accounting for some contextual risk factors. The proportional change in variance (PCV) in this model was 80.33 percent, indicating that 80.33 percent of the community variance observed in the null model was explained by the community as well as individual variables.\nThe fixed effects analysis result. The model with smaller deviance (model IV) best fits the data and the interpretation of the fixed effects was based on this model. Model four was adjusted for both individual and community-level factors. Consequently, respondents\u2019 age group, marital status, educational status, literacy level, respondent occupation, wealth index, media exposure, children\u2019s age in the month, parity, and living Country have been significantly associated with good vitamin A consumption in East Africa Countries.\nThe odds of good vitamin A consumption among women aged 25\u201334 and 35\u201349 were\nincreased by 22% and 41% as compared to the age group 15\u201324 (AOR = 1.22;95% CI:1.13,1.32), and (AOR = 1.41;95%CI:1.27,1.57) respectively. The odds of good vitamin A consumption increase by 20% among married as compared to a single (AOR = 1.20; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.28). Education has a significant effect on the consumption of vitamin A consumption. The odds of good vitamin A consumption among secondary education level mothers increase by 15% as compared to non-educated mothers (AOR = 1.15; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.28). The odds of good vitamin A consumption among literate mothers increased by 18% as compared to illiterate (AOR = 1.18; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.27). The odds of good vitamin A consumption among mothers who had occupation increased by 41% as compared to mothers with no occupation (AOR = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.33, 1.50). The odds of good vitamin A consumption among women in the middle and rich wealth category increase by 23% and 38% as compared to women with poor wealth status (AOR = 1.23;95%CI:1.14,1.33) and (AOR = 1.38;95%CI:1.26,1.47) respectively. Children\u2019s age in moth had a significant effect on the good consumption of vitamin A.

From the multilevel logistic regression model women\u2019s age, marital status, maternal education, wealth index, maternal occupation, children\u2019s age in a month, media exposure, literacy rate, and parity were significantly associated with good vitamin A-rich foods consumption in East Africa.\nThe magnitude of good vitamin A consumption was 62.91% with a 95% CI of 62.37 to\n63.43. This finding is higher than from a study done at Mali DHS and Ethiopia [1,17,28]. The difference in results can be explained by the effect of sample size, differences in the study population, tools used to measure the outcome variables across the studies, and study settings differences.\nIn this study, good vitamin A consumption among women aged 25\u201334 and 35\u201349 was\nhigher than among the age group 15\u201324. This might be due to the higher age group might give them more chances to receive a lot of pertinent information about vitamin A and that might lead them to consume better than their counterparts. Furthermore, the higher age group is more likely to be employed while studies showed that being employed was found to increase the chance of good vitamin A consumption as than non-employed ones [34,35]. This might be explained as the information needed to consume vitamin A adequately can be easily obtained from their colleagues; In addition, the employed women were mostly educated, and it improves the use of health information like advantages and sources of vitamin A-rich foods.\nGood vitamin A consumption is higher among married respondents as compared to single ones. This might be attributed to the additional chance of getting support from their husband and if the husband is educated, better consumption of vitamin A-rich foods is likely to occur in that household whereas studies showed that the presence of an educated husband in the household was associated with better consumption of vitamin A [35\u201337]. Moreover, living with a husband may give a chance to earn a better income and strengthen the financial capability of that family and that will in turn improves the capability of consuming vitamin A-rich foods, which are expensive to be consumed for people with low income [23].\nThis study indicates that good vitamin A consumption was higher among literate mothers\nincluding primary education level mothers increase as compared to illiterate mothers.

Thus, mothers who are educated are more likely to get more information about vitamin A food sources than illiterate ones.\nFurthermore, good vitamin A consumption was higher among mothers who had occupa-\ntions than mothers with no occupation and this is consistent with a study finding [34]. This might be due to the information needed to consume vitamin A-rich foods being easily obtained from their colleagues and mothers who had occupations are more educated than mothers who had no occupation.\nThis study showed that good vitamin A consumption was higher among women in the mid-\ndle and rich wealth category compared to women with poor wealth status. This finding is supported by studies; [11,13,17,19,28] and this might be due to the higher chance of consumption of Vitamin A rich foods among those higher wealth status than poor wealth status as they may not be afford to buy vitamin A-rich foods which are expensive for people with low income [23].\nChildren aged greater than 9 months had a significant effect on the good consumption of\nvitamin A than children of age in months 6\u20138. This is similar to a study finding a study in Bangladesh [36]. This result is probably due to the numerous carrying attitudes of parents regarding what types of foods they usually have to feed their children in different age groups.\nTable 2.

This was supported by studies that showed that there was a positive relationship between media exposure and vitamin A consumption [34,37]. This is because the information needed to consume vitamin A-rich foods can be obtained easily through the utilization of media.\nThis study showed that good vitamin A consumption was lower among parity of greater\nthan two as compared to parity of one. This was similar to a study done in Ethiopia that indicated a significant association between smaller family sizes and good vitamin A-rich foods [28]. The possible explanation for this finding is due to a challenge a mother face to feed vitamin-rich foods to a larger family than a smaller family size due to the expense of vitamin Arich foods. Whereas feeding vitamin-rich foods to large family sizes is more challenging due to the inflation of the cost of living.\nGood vitamin A consumption among children of age 6 to 23 months in Ethiopia decreased\nby 88% as compared to children live Burundi. The difference might be attributed due to the difference in socioeconomic and study settings."

            "text": "The magnitude of good vitamin A consumption in twelve East African countries is low. The respondents with an age group of 25\u201334 and 35\u201349, married, literate, had occupation, middle and higher wealth index, have media exposure, children aged nine-month to 2 years, 2\u20134 and 5+ parity and different living Country was significantly associated with good vitamin A consumption in the East Africa Counties. Therefore, policymakers should give due attention to the age group 15\u201324, single, illiterate, jobless, poor wealth status, children of age in months 6\u20138, media non-exposed mothers, and parity one to improve good consumption of foods rich in vitamin A in East Africa countries."
