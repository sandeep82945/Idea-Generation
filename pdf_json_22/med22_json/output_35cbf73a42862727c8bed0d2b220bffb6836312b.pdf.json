            "text": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men [1], with 1,276,106 incident cases reported globally during 2018 [2]. There is high geographical heterogeneity of PCa incidence, which is reflected in a 40-fold difference in the age-adjusted incidence rates across the globe [3]. Several studies have argued that this could be attributed to the increased number of diagnoses in countries where the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is prevalent. Nevertheless, the basis for this heterogeneity remains poorly understood [1].\nGiven that PCa is also clinically heterogeneous, risk factors identified to date differ by dis-\nease aggressiveness [4]. In particular, established risk factors for total PCa are mainly nonmodifiable, including older age, African descent, and genetics [5], whereas some potential risk factors for aggressive PCa include smoking, obesity [6], lower vitamin D, and higher blood lipid levels [4], which are modifiable. Lipid-lowering therapies are cheap and well established for lowering cardiovascular risk. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence that repurposed lipidlowering drugs are effective for the prevention of PCa. It is therefore important to determine whether blood lipids increase PCa risk, especially lethal disease [7]. A meta-analysis of 14 prospective studies published in 2015 [8] did not observe significant associations between triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations and risk of total or high-grade PCa, but high between-study heterogeneity was evident for most associations. Two meta-analyses have examined the role of statin use in PCa risk, and both observed inverse associations of statins and advanced PCa risk [9,10]. Nonetheless, whether these associations can be attributed to lower cholesterol itself or some other mechanism is unknown.\nObservational studies may suffer from unobserved confounding and reverse causation [11],\nwhich could explain inconsistent findings among studies. Mendelian randomisation (MR) uses genetic variants as proxies for the exposures of interest and, if carefully conducted, can complement observational research [12] and support triangulation of evidence. That is because genetic variants are randomly allocated to offspring by parents and independently assorted during meiosis, which minimise issues with reverse causation and confounding [11,13]. In addition, most studies on lipids and PCa measure lipid levels only once, which can lead to measurement error in the findings, whereas genetically predicted lipid levels capture lifelong expected levels. Previous MR research is limited to 2 studies that examined the role of HDL, LDL, and TG in PCa risk overall and by disease stage and grade, and both reported null associations [14,15]. However, neither study adjusted for multiple lipid traits, which may have limited their findings, given that different lipids are correlated and pleiotropic [16]. In this paper, we aim to identify whether genetically predicted lipid traits are associated with overall PCa risk\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003859 January 27, 2022 3 / 19\nand, in particular, advanced and early age onset disease. We incorporated a summary-level two-sample univariable and multivariable MR (MVMR) framework to adjust for pleiotropic lipid effects and examined the role of HDL, LDL, and TG, as well as additional lipid traits that have been underexamined to date, such as lipoprotein A (Lp(a)), apolipoprotein A (apoA), and apolipoprotein B (apoB)."

Due to the availability of exposure (blood lipids) and outcome (PCa) data from 2 different sources, we used a two-sample MR study design. In the univariable MR, SNPs that satisfied genome-wide significance (P< 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) were selected for each trait. As we combined summary-level data from 2 sources, we removed inconsistencies in cases where neither the effect nor the noneffect alleles matched for a single SNP between the 2 datasets. Such cases can occur for a biallelic SNP when one dataset reports the effect of an SNP using a pair of alleles on the positive strand, whereas the other dataset reports the pair for the same SNP on the negative strand [22]. Upon removing these inconsistencies, we harmonised the data so that the exposure and outcome datasets would have the same effect allele. We used the TwoSampleMR package version 0.5.4 to clump the data using a threshold of r2< 0.001 to identify and remove any SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD). All SNPs left after clumping were considered as the instrumental variables (IVs). We firstly ran the univariable analysis on all blood lipids for both total and advanced PCa. Following peer review comments, this analysis was also performed for all blood lipids and early age onset PCa. For the main estimation methods of the univariable analyses, we performed the inverse variance weighting (IVW) [23,24] and weighed median [11] approaches, and we additionally applied the MR-Egger [25] approach, using the MendelianRandomization package version 0.4.2.\nTo adjust for different lipid traits in our models, we performed an MVMR analysis. We\nchose to exclude apoA and apoB to avoid multicollinearity issues due to their high correlation with HDL and LDL, respectively (rapoA,HDL = 0.978; P value (P)< 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126/rapoB,LDL = 0.984; P< 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126). The minimum P across the remaining lipids was computed, and selection of SNPs was based on those that satisfied genome-wide significance through the minimum P (P< 5 \u00d7 10\u22128). After harmonisation was performed, we clumped the data based on a threshold of r2< 0.001. The main estimation method performed was the IVW, while we additionally implemented the MR-Egger estimate [26] to control for any remaining unmeasured pleiotropy."

Of the 43 IVs used in the paper, 35 IVs were available in both the exposure and outcome dataset. In order to avoid weak instrument bias, we included only 28 genetic variants, which were genome-wide significant for Lp(a). The univariable models were refitted based on these 28 IVs.\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003859 January 27, 2022 5 / 19\n3. Sensitivity analysis 3: As the LPA gene (chromosome 6: 160,531,482\u2013160,664,275) is the main gene associated with Lp(a) concentrations and explains about 70% to 90% of its vari-\nability [28], we selected variants located in the LPA gene based on a clumping threshold of r2< 0.001 to represent strong biological instruments and potentially support the effect of Lp(a). Four such variants were identified and subsequently utilised as IVs.\n4. Sensitivity analysis 4: Additional robust estimation methods were utilised as part of our\nsensitivity analyses to control and/or test for horizontal pleiotropy. These included the MR-PRESSO [29] and contamination mixture [30].\nAs obesity may be considered a probable confounder for lipids and PCa [14], we also performed an additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) in all the MVMR models, using genetic association data for BMI from UK Biobank [17]. Lp(a) is assembled in the liver [31], whereas liver function/disease has been proposed to influence PCa detection and outcomes [32,33]. Genetic associations for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were thereby adjusted in a MVMR model including Lp(a) and total PCa. In addition, as kidney disease has been suggested to affect Lp(a) concentrations [34], and creatinine was previously associated with PCa risk [35], we performed another MVMR analysis using Lp (a), creatinine, and total PCa to control for kidney function. All genetic associations for AST, ALT, and creatinine were acquired from UK Biobank [17]. We reviewed the Phenoscanner database [36,37] (P threshold = 10\u22125) for secondary traits associations of the 10 IVs included in the main univariable analyses for Lp(a) and found 2 that had secondary associations relevant to inflammation and, specifically, aspirin use. We thereby excluded these 2 SNPs from the main univariable Lp(a) analysis on total, advanced, and early age onset PCa. Finally, we performed a post hoc power calculation for our MR analysis [38], where we set the heritability of the exposures to 24% (as reported for Lp(a) by Sinnott-Armstrong and colleagues [18]). Throughout our analyses, we considered significant estimates based on the 95% confidence level. We additionally estimated a Bonferroni and a Holm-Bonferroni corrected P for the main univariable analyses on total, advanced, and early age onset PCa, to adjust for the multiple tests performed on each outcome. The total number of tests is reflected upon the number of different lipids we considered for each PCa outcome. Throughout the results section, nominally significant results are reported."

There was little evidence that any of the other lipids (i.e., LDL, HDL, TG, apoA, and apoB) were associated with PCa outcomes. Specifically, IVs located in the LPA gene supported the strongest and most significant Lp(a) associations for total, advanced, and early age onset PCa. Given the strong regulation of Lp(a) levels by the LPA gene region [28], the latter findings are based on strong instruments with a clear biological function. Adjustment for multiple lipid traits and BMI in the MVMR models further supported a significant association of genetically predicted Lp(a) on total, advanced, and early age onset PCa.\nThe null associations observed for genetically predicted HDL on total PCa agree with find-\nings from 2 previous MR analyses [14,15], and the null findings for TG are also supported in the Bull and colleagues [14] paper. In our analysis, there was some evidence for a significant LDL association with total PCa risk, though this was likely a false indication due to pleiotropy, as suggested by the MVMR model, which indicated no association with LDL. As Lp(a) includes an LDL component [40], the attenuation of LDL to the null in the MVMR could be attributed to independent actions of Lp(a) itself, as we did not observe any association between other Lp(a) components and PCa risk. Alternative explanations are that Lp(a) concentrations are less affected by statins compared to LDL [41], thus genetically predicted Lp(a) may be more accurate for current actual levels than genetically predicted LDL, or that the association for Lp(a) dominates over LDL due to the high between-person variability of Lp(a) [18]. The\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003859.g001\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003859 January 27, 2022 10 / 19\nauthors of the Bull and colleagues paper [14] suggested a potential role of LDL and TG in advanced/high-grade PCa; our findings for LDL and TG in advanced PCa risk are not in agreement. Our analyses included adjustment for multiple lipid traits in contrast with the previously mentioned papers, which we believe plays a vital role in MR analysis modelling blood lipids, given the high correlation between them. As far as we are aware, no previous MR study has investigated the role of apoA and apoB in PCa risk. Our null results are nonetheless in agreement with observational studies by Katzke and colleagues [42], which involved the prospective EPIC\u2013Heidelberg cohort and Borgquist and colleagues [43], which was based on the prospective Malmo\u0308 Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS).\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous MR study has examined the role of Lp(a) in PCa\nrisk. The positive association observed for Lp(a) in total PCa was supported by the observational study of Katzke and colleagues [42]. Results showed that top versus bottom quartile levels of Lp(a) were associated with a 47% higher risk of PCa (OR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.04). Wang and colleagues [44], another observational study, examined the role of Lp(a) in highrisk PCa via a multivariable regression adjusted for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and lipid-lowering drugs. They observed that high Lp(a) levels were positively associated (ORQ4 vs. Q1 = 2.687; 95% CI = 1.113 to 6.491; P = 0.028) with high-risk PCa, which agrees with our findings for advanced PCa in the MVMR analysis. In addition, a recent large prospective cohort among 211,754 men in UK Biobank [45] observed a suggestive positive association between Lp(a) and PCa risk (hazard ratioper SD = 1.02; 95% CI: [0.99,1.06]). Our literature review did not reveal any studies investigating the role of Lp(a) in early age onset PCa.\nA range of different biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain pro-cancer\neffects of cholesterol at the cellular level, including cell proliferation, inflammation, membrane organisation, and steroidogenesis [46]. It is unclear whether total cholesterol or any lipoprotein particle is the causal factor, and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of Lp(a) have not been well studied. However, emerging evidence from the cardiovascular literature supports pleiotropic functions of Lp(a) and complex mediation pathways with other lipid particles [47]. Lp(a) is highly heritable (heritability = 24%) [18], with the majority of individuals having low Lp(a) levels. However, African Americans, which are known to have the highest risk for PCa, tend to also have higher circulating Lp(a) levels [28]. It has been previously observed that mean Lp(a) concentrations for African Americans are 106 (60 to 180) nmol/l, whereas Caucasians such as non-Hispanic whites have mean Lp(a) concentrations of 24 (7.2 to 79.2) nmol/l [48]. Although the exact explanation behind ethnic discrepancies in PCa is currently unknown, it has been hypothesised that access to healthcare may play a partial role in this. Yet, given that disparities in PCa risk are apparent regardless of cancer detection issues, it is likely that biological factors are key drivers of this phenomenon [49]. Two recent papers have further provided evidence of a different immune response [50] and inflammatory signalling [51] for African Americans versus Caucasians, which can be linked to their poorer PCa prognosis. Considering Lp(a) as a modifier of the immune/inflammatory response [52], the increased Lp(a) concentrations in African Americans and our observed association between genetically elevated Lp(a) and PCa, we hypothesise that Lp(a) may partially account for some of the observed discrepancies in PCa risk by ethnicity. Future large-scale genomic studies in African ancestry populations [53] would be required to evaluate the hypothesis that Lp(a) can explain discrepancies in PCa risk by race.\nWe note several limitations to our research. There is no direct way to prove that the second\nand third MR assumptions hold and as such, violations would result in biased MR estimates. A large number of robust methods and sensitivity analyses were used to probe into potential violations mainly due to horizontal pleiotropy, but its presence cannot be excluded. The samples analysed for our main MR analyses were restricted to Europeans to avoid issues with\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003859 January 27, 2022 11 / 19\nheterogeneity, which is required for a two-sample MR [54]. However, this may affect generalisability of the results, which are restricted to those of European ancestry. The number of variants associated with Lp(a) was limited in comparison to other lipids. Initially, 5,894 variants were identified to be associated with Lp(a) at GWAS significance, whereas all other lipids had more than 10,000 associated variants. This then resulted in a final sample size of 10 variants due to LD clumping in the main univariable analysis, which may have decreased our statistical power. However, after relaxing the LD clumping threshold in our sensitivity analyses, we included more variants, the findings of which corroborated the main results. In addition, some previous observational studies have suggested potential threshold effects for cholesterol concentrations and PCa [55,56], which cannot be studied in two-sample MR with summarylevel data, and future one-sample MR studies are warranted.\nApart from the caveats in our study, there are also several strengths that should be noted.\nWe used an MR study design, in which the outcome of interest is compared between genotypes, analogous to that between treatment and placebo groups in a randomised controlled trial. However, inference should be made with great caution as alterations of genetically predicted risk factors are not identical to those due to a drug or dietary intervention [57]. Secondly, as lipids are dependent on each other for their main functionalities [16], it is important to control for pleiotropic pathways that may arise from these dependencies. One method to do so is via the use of MVMR, which allows to include genetic information on exposures that may correlate with each other into a joint multivariable model [58], and our study forms the first such MVMR conducted to investigate the relationship between various lipid traits and PCa risk. Thirdly, the use of UK Biobank data allowed us to include information on underexamined lipid traits such as Lp(a), apoA, and apoB, in comparison to previous PCa studies, which mainly considered HDL, LDL, and TG. In addition, we have sex-specific genetic associations, and this allowed us to work with male-specific data, which are relevant to PCa. Finally, our analyses are based on large sample sizes, which were acquired from UK Biobank [17] and the PRACTICAL consortium [20].\nIn summary, findings from this study point towards a positive association between geneti-\ncally predicted Lp(a) concentrations and risk of total, advanced, and early age onset PCa. Screening for high Lp(a) concentrations could possibly be investigated in the future to identify high-risk groups for PCa. Given that Lp(a) concentrations depend significantly on genetics [59], modification of Lp(a) levels may be achieved by developing Lp(a)-lowering drugs [60] that might be on the horizon. A personalised approach in repurposing lipid drugs that target Lp(a) directly for high-risk individuals could consequently be considered, upon replication of our findings, to study their effectiveness against PCa prevention. The mechanisms behind the observed association remain, however, unclear given the uncertainty underlining the pleiotropic physiological functions of the LPA gene itself, which controls about 70% to 90% of the Lp (a) variability [40,59]. Further research into this complex gene such as colocalization analysis would be required to understand more of its functionality and consequently its role in PCa risk."
