    "abstractText": "When we go for a walk with friends, we can observe an interesting effect: From step lengths to arm movements our movements unconsciously align; they synchronize. Prior research found that this synchronization is a crucial aspect of human relations that strengthens social cohesion and trust. Generalizing from these findings in synchronization theory, we propose a dynamical approach that can be applied in the design of non-humanoid robots to increase CHI \u201923, April 23\u201328, 2023, Hamburg, Germany \u00a9 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 51 participants exploring our concept in a between-subjects design. For this, we built a prototype of a simple non-humanoid robot that can bend to follow human movements and vary the movement synchronization patterns. We found that synchronized movements lead to significantly higher ratings in an established questionnaire on trust between people and automation but did not influence the willingness to spend money in a trust game.",

            "text": "From entertainment [1, 60] or health care [59, 87] to sex [19, 65, 84, 86]: with robots evolving from the assembly line to social robots, they are increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives. Thus, the question of how people perceive robots and what attitudes they have toward robots becomes crucial to define our relationships with them [51]. Research has shown that trust is one of the key factors influencing the quality of interactions of humans with robots [6], including a user\u2019s willingness to interact with a robot, take its advice into account [43], and delegate tasks to robots [29, 71]. Lack of trust, hence, strains our relationship with social robots and may thus hinder or impede their future proliferation as ubiquitous everyday helpers.\nIn recent years, research has explored strategies by which robots can gain and maintain the trust of human users. This research concentrates mostly on robots\u2019 features that influence how they interact with human users, pointing out such features as the capacity to reason [39], the realistic facial expression of emotions [71], or personalization [43]. Kirkpatrick et al. [37] found that trust toward robots requires that the robot is perceived as having core human features such as agency and intention. Therefore, the more human a robot appears to be, the more trustworthy it can appear. If a robot displays human characteristics, it is likely to be perceived in interaction, in an anthropomorphic way, as a human [23, 43]. Building on this, research proposed a variety of human-like robot systems that can, for example, accurately express emotions through facial expressions or make eye-contact. The strategy of maximally anthropomorphizing robots, however, has its limitations. First, it raises unrealistic expectations that the robot will behave in a fully human way, which ultimately leads to frustration [90]. Second, it leaves aside the question of trust toward robots that do not have a humanoid appearance and advanced capacities for interaction with humans (e.g., reasoning). We refer to such kind of robot as an Simple Non-Humanoid Robot (SNHR). Simple as not having advanced capacities for interaction, and non-humanoid as not having a humanoid appearance.\nTo overcome these limitations, in this work, we go beyond stateof-the-art and add to the body of research in human-robot interaction by exploring a novel strategy to establish trust between humans and SNHRs. Drawing on recent findings in social psychology and neuropsychology, we propose to leverage the effect of synchronization: When we go for a walk with friends, we can observe that our movements - from stride length to arm movements - unconsciously align; they synchronize. This synchronization is a critical feature of positive social relations [56, 57, 77] and trust [14].\nGeneralizing the findings in social psychology, we hypothesize that the synchronization of an SNHR with the human user increases the trust toward the SNHR. Because synchronization is a basic dynamical feature of interaction, it does not assume a humanoid shape of a robot and advanced capacities for interaction. As a first step to evaluate the feasibility of establishing such a physical synchronization between humans and robots, we explore our idea using an intentionally abstract object looking more like an art installation than a robot to exclude possible confounding factors. For conducting the study, we built a prototype implementation of such an object, which tracks the upper body movements of people in its vicinity and can synchronize its movements with their movements (see fig 1).\nThe contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we illustrate the design process and technical implementation of a robot prototype that allows physical synchronization with human users. Second, we contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 51 participants assessing the influence of synchronized movement compared to simple or random movement patterns of a robot on the perceived trust of users and propose a set of guidelines for the future use of such interfaces."

            "text": "Trust is the primary factor shaping social interactions [85], from intimate relations [70], through work relations [9] and consumer behavior [25] to conflict [46]. Most definitions of trust rely on the notion that trust describes a relation between a trustor (subject) and a trustee (object) that are interdependent in the sense that the action of one has some consequences for the other in a situation containing risks for the trustor [63]. Further, trust can be understood as a form of reliance that is based on the judgment that the partner has the relevant competence, motivation, and opportunity [22].\nFollowing the pivotal role of trust in interpersonal relationships, trust has also emerged as an increasingly relevant area of research in human-robot interaction [3, 28\u201330, 62]. In this field, many studies explored the antecedents of trust toward robots. They found that trust toward robots depends on human personality factors, features of the situation, history of interactions with robots, and characteristics of the robots [29, 39, 51]. Further, the research found that previous interactions with robots result in higher trust [18, 73]. However, these effects of prior experience with robots depend on how the robot behaves in the interaction. In a meta-analysis of trust in HRI, Hancock et al. [29] found that robot performance-based factors (e.g., reliability, false-alarm rate, failure rate) had the greatest influence on developing trust in the robot. As another perspective on trust toward robots, Gompei and Umemuro [28] explored cognitive and affective trust as two dimensions of trust toward robots. Cognitive trust is semi-rational and strongly influenced by the perception of the reliability of the robot, its intention, and its goals. On the other hand, affective trust is emotional in nature and less affected by the robot\u2019s mistakes than cognitive trust but by the\nrobot\u2019s appearance (human-like appearance leads to more trust). As an example of such affective trust, it recently demonstrated that robots with music-driven emotional prosody and gestures were perceived as more trustworthy than robots without such features Savery et al. [74].\nRecently, we have seen a shift in focus of the research on trust in robotics, from studying the causes and effects of trust in robots to the strategies for robots to actively gain and maintain the trust of humans. Most of this work concentrates on two domains, making robots more humanoid with increased social characteristics such as emotional facial expression [11] or increasing their reasoning capacity [16, 51, 71]. These directions, however, have important limitations as they do not transfer to non-humanoid and simple robots, which do not resemble humans and are not capable of verbal communication and high reasoning capacity. Therefore, this work focuses on strategies to establish trust toward Simple NonHumanoid Robots."

            "heading": "2.2 Synchronization in Humans and",
            "text": "Human-Robot Interaction\nIn physics, synchronization is the alignment of the rhythms of two or more oscillators due to mostly weak interactions [61] and, therefore, the coordination in time among the states or dynamics of the elements comprising the system [75]. Beyond physics, the notion of synchronization has been adapted for other systems, such as periodic dynamics in cardiac [69] or nervous systems [45]. Pikovsky et al. [61] provide a description of specific types of synchronization. The most prominent type of synchronization is mimicry [13], also known as the chameleon effect [12]. In mimicry, one interaction partner mimics with some time delay and possibly some variation, movements, postures, rate of speech, or the tone of voice of the other interaction partner.\nSimilarly to the usage in other domains, synchronization plays a key role in social interactions [56, 57, 92]. In such social interactions, synchronization of behavior binds individuals into higher-level functional units, such as dyads or social groups [56, 57], that can perform a common action aimed at the achievement of a common goal, for example, moving a piece of furniture, servicing a car in a race, prepare a meal in a picnic or singing a song together. For the interaction between two individuals to proceed smoothly, the overt behavior and internal states (e.g., activation level, emotions, goals) of the individuals must achieve synchronization [27, 53]. This synchronization needs to occur at various levels, including motor behavior, but it also involves cognitive and emotional dynamics [54]. Synchronization does not need to be the same in all modalities. Two individuals involved in a conversation, for example, in an antiphase manner, synchronize their speech while they synchronize their facial expressions and body movements in-phase manner [82]. In this context, antiphase means that when the former speaks, the latter is silent, and vice versa. In-phase means that the former\u2019s body movements and facial expressions are in unison with the latter\u2019s body movements and facial expressions. The synchronization on the emotional level is related to the synchronization on the behavioral level because facial expressions tend to induce the corresponding emotional state in each partner of the conversation\n[41, 83]. Interpersonal synchronization protects against the antisocial consequences of frustration [26]. Further, synchronization has important consequences on social relations [4, 47, 48, 53, 55]. Synchronization other leads to the formation of social ties and promotes a feeling of connectedness and liking [12, 24, 35, 42], while the failure to achieve synchronization evokes feelings of separateness [91]. Highly related, Launay et al. [44] found that synchronization increases trust toward others [44]. Further, recent works indicated that synchronization of group decisions resulted in higher trust [21], and synchronization on the brain level in a trust game is correlated with higher investment and, thus, higher trust [14].\nFurther, there is a large body of work in the area of HCI on human interaction mediated by technology, exploring mediated trust and mediated synchronization. For example, Bos et al. [7] found trust formation was slower, and the trust achieved was more fragile in mediated conditions. Riegelsberger et al. [66] propose a methodological foundation to assess mediated trust. Slov\u00e1k et al. [80] suggest that even subtle differences in video-conference design may significantly impact mediated trust. Brave et al. [8] explore the physical synchronization of states of distant, identical objects to create the illusion of shared physical objects across distance. Rinott and Tractinsky [67] indicate the potential of using interpersonal motor synchronization in HCI thanks to its pro-social consequences. Slov\u00e1k et al. [81] connect changes in skin conductance synchrony to changes in emotional engagement. Scissors et al. [76] demonstrated that forms of linguistic mimicry are associated with establishing trust between strangers in a text-chat environment. In this following, we specifically focus on HRI and the relationship between synchronization and trust.\nIn recent years, research started to explore synchronization in human-robot interaction. For example, Hofree et al. [34] found that humans will mimic the facial expressions of a robot, even if they are fully aware that their interaction partner is non-human. Shen et al. [78] found that the motor coordination mechanism improved humans\u2019 overall perception of the humanoid robot. Other work has explored robotic drumming, rhythmic HRI, and human-robot musical synchronization [20, 33, 89]. M\u00f6rtl et al. [49] developed the concept of goal-directed synchronization behavior for robotic agents in repetitive joint action tasks and implemented it in an anthropomorphic robot. Further, Hashimoto et al. [31] explored emotional synchronization and found that human feelings became comfortable when the robot made the synchronized facial expression with human emotions. Further works, again involving humanoid robots, found that the presence of a physical, embodied robot enabled more interaction, better drumming, and turn-taking, as well as enjoyment, especially when the robot used gestures [40]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work exploring synchronization as a means to increase trust between humans and SNHRs."

            "text": "The question which motivates our research is how to design SNHRs so humans will trust them. The answer to this question is relatively straightforward with respect to the cognitive dimension \u2013 the robot should look reliable and should not make errors. However, this\nquestion is much more interesting with respect to the affective dimension of trust, which arguably is even more important because affective trust increases the willingness to cooperate and forgive errors. Research on trust in humans suggests that the ability to synchronize with the human partner may be an important factor in perceiving the robot as trustworthy.\nBased on the above motivation and a review of related work, in this paper, we explore synchronization as a means of establishing trust between humans and SNHRs. While the literature highlights various types of body movements and body signals that could be used to establish such synchronization, in our work, we explore synchronization with upper body movements as an example. This way, we wanted to avoid complex movements on the participant\u2019s side, such as gesticulating or nodding. We wanted to obtain the simplest possible patterns leading to synchronization at the level\nof whole-body movement. For this, we designed a prototype that can mimic the participant\u2019s upper body movements by bending the prototype\u2019s upper part. Besides synchronized movements, it can also generate randomor simplemovement patterns. In the following section, we present the design goals and the implementation of the prototype."

In particular, we wanted to avoid anthropomorphizing the form of the robot. We also tried to prevent associations with all animate forms, which could be associated with expectations of preserving the prototype or carrying specific attitudes or emotions. We also avoided association with known machines, particularly\nwith all kinds of robots, including industrial robots. For this reason, we chose to construct a 3-tendon single-segment continuum robot [68] that has no rigid joints associated with a stereotypical robot. Additionally, in the participant\u2019s instructions, we used the word installation instead of a machine or robot to direct associations toward an abstract art object rather than a practical device."

In pilot studies, we noticed that this form of object and this type of movement made study participants tend to imitate the prototype\u2019s movement by flexing the upper body and flexing the spine. With increasing intensity of body movement, participants started to move their hips and shoulders.\nWe prepared a GitHub repository1 containing the prototype\u2019s technical documentation, mechanical parts, 3D models for printing, electronic schematics, software source code, and a complete list of required components from external vendors. We hope it helps the HCI community, e.g., replicate the experiment or build the robot for other purposes.\n3.2.1 Construction, mechanics, materials, actuation, and safety. We opted to use a cable/tendon actuation, the most common method of driving continuum robots. As depicted in fig. 3a, our cable-driven continuum robot has multiple spacer structures connected in series by a backbone located at the center axis. The three cables are spaced 120 degrees around the center backbone. Cables pass through a series of spacer structures that keep the cables in the correct position relative to the backbone. The end of the cables is fixed to the end structure on the top and to the actuators on the other end. As actuators pull the cable, the cable length inside the structure of the continuum robot is decreased, thus forcing the robot\u2019s structure to bend toward the side of the pulled cable. Through the coordinated displacement of each driving cable, the continuum robot can bend toward any specified direction \ud835\udf03 with a defined bending angle \ud835\udf19 . As actuators , we used two-phase stepper motors 17HS4401 controlled by TRINAMIC\u2019s TMC2209, an ultra-silent motor driver. Using this setup, we managed to achieve a smooth and noiseless movement, thus eliminating additional factors that may affect the perception of the study participant.\nFor safety reasons, we have limited the bending angle to 20 degrees to prevent the robot\u2019s tip from hitting the participant if they got too close. Because some delay is needed in mimicry, we also have limited acceleration to 62.8\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc602 and a maximum speed of\ncable pulling to 25.12\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc60 . We built two iterations of the prototype based on different materials. The first prototype uses a backbone made of a densely wound spring steel spring with a diameter of 12mm. Pilot studies indicated that participants perceived this as heavy and dangerous. Additionally, some participants were concerned about being accidentally hit by the robot. A sense of insecurity or an unfriendly appearance eliminated the possibility of establishing trust. Therefore, in the second iteration, we used a 3mm diameter fiberglass backbone also\n1GitHub repository: https://github.com/wbartkowski/In-Sync-Robot-Prototype\nused to construct kites. The participants perceived this structure as light, airy, and non-threatening.\nOther crucial parts of the prototype\u2019s structure were designed in CAD software Fusion 360, and 3D printed using PET-G filament, having excellent mechanical properties.\n3.2.2 Electronic, connectivity, and software. We use Espressif Systems ESP32 chip with Xtensa\u00ae 32-bit LX6 microprocessors to compute the robot movement formula and control the actuator drivers. We chose ESP32 because it supports the ESP-NOW protocol developed by Espressif, which enables multiple devices to communicate with one another using ESP32\u2019s Wi-Fi hardware without needing a Wi-Fi router, reducing the complexity of the hardware setup. Moreover, ESP-NOW is connectionless with no handshake required (as required for, e.g., Bluetooth pairing), so this solution was very convenient for our research setting, where three devices (robot prototype, orientation sensor device, and data recorder) have to communicate constantly with low latency and the possibility of instant reconnection in case of accidental power loss and during research hardware setup.\nAdditionally, in the prototype, we use a separate microcontroller based on ATmega328P to control experiment conditions and coin acceptor. ATmega328P is communicating with ESP32 over the USART interface.\nSoftware for the prototype and other devices is written in C language and developed using Visual Studio Code environment with PlatformIO extension for easy management of different electronics development platforms."

We varied the movement pattern of the robot in a between-subjects design with three levels (two unsynchronized and one synchronized movement pattern). We explained to the participants that we were working on a prototype for human-machine interaction. To avoid biasing the participants, we did not give any further information about the purpose and goal of the prototype. We chose not to give our participants any specific tasks to perform or goals to achieve. Instead, we asked them to interact with the robot in a natural and spontaneous way without any constraints or instructions. For this, participants were allowed to move around the room at will for 3 minutes (the pilot studies showed that interest in the task lasted for about 3 minutes). We opted for this approach to assess the effects of synchronization on trust in a more natural and realistic setting without the potential confounds that would arise from using a specific task or context. More specifically, a taskoriented scenario would allow measuring the confidence in the\nmachine (cognitive dimension, e.g., reliability, efficiency) but would not allow measuring the relationship with the machine (affective dimension, e.g., feelings, emotions). Moreover, a task-oriented scenario would make it difficult to manipulate the synchronization so that it does not affect the quality of the execution of the task.\nAfter this, we asked participants to fill out a questionnaire and handed them their compensation of about 3$ (in local currency) as five coins. As the last step, we gave our participants the option to optionally play a version of the trust game [5] with the prototype: Participants could deposit any portion of the coins they received (from 0 to 5 coins) into the prototype (if someone refused to participate in the game, we counted it as depositing 0 coins). We informed the participants that the prototype would be credited with the tripled amount of their deposit and subsequently, at will, would pay a share (i.e., between 0% and 300% of the inserted money) of this sum back.\nFollowing the results of our literature review and informal pretests, we expected that the type of movement performed by the prototype during the interaction would affect the participants\u2019 sense of trust in interacting with the SNHR. Therefore, we varied the movement as an independent variable with three levels, namely:\nsynchronized as a prototype with movements synchronized to the participant\u2019s movements. The participant\u2019s movements are mimicked to achieve a specific form of synchronization - delayed in time and possibly spatially transformed. So participant movements are transformed into movements\nof the prototype using a formula for the robot\u2019s kinematics (see fig. 3c) with added movement delay by limiting maximum speed and acceleration as described in section 3.2 and adding a rotational transformation (by 10 degrees) of the bending direction \ud835\udf03 . random as a prototype with random movements using Brownian motion [32] to program it. We chose the parameters of the Brownian motion in a way that the amplitude and frequency of the motions were comparable to the motions emitted by the prototype in synchronization mode. simple as a simple, recurring pattern of movement. We program it as sinusoidal, waving sideways in one plane.\nWe varied the independent variable in a between-subjects design by assigning each participant to one of the three conditions. For each condition, we measured the following dependent variables:\nTrust between People and Automation (TPA) To further gain insight into the trust relationship between the prototype and the participant, we employed the widely used TPA checklist as proposed by Jian et al. [36]. The TPA consists of twelve items with 7-point Likert scales each. It measures trust and distrust as polar opposites along a single dimension. Therefore, the output may be a single all-encompassing trust value or separate values for the trust and distrust dimensions Kohn et al. [38]. money given to the prototype Similar to previouswork in assessing trust in robots [2, 50, 58, 93], we used the amount of money staked in the trust game [5] as a measure of the trust participants placed in the prototype.\nBased on the study design, we obtained ethics approval from our institution before the experiment, which had no objections."

For this, we built a typical coin acceptor into the prototype, which, as expected, turned out to be a good affordance for the action of inserting coins into it. The coin acceptor also counted the number of inserted coins. The operation of the coin acceptor was coordinated with the operation of the coin returner made by us, which, 10 seconds after the participant had thrown in the last coin, started the process of returning an adequate number of coins by the prototype (see fig. 2D-E).\nFurther, we used a data recorder placed on the technical table in a far-away corner of the room (see fig. 4b). We developed a data recorder device to ensure the quality of data collected on paper by the investigator. We recorded the following data: movement tracking data, number of inserted coins, research condition number, timestamp, and time of every experiment stage. For the construction, we used the same chip ESP32 (see section 3) with added microSD card driver. For communication with the prototype, we used the ESP-NOW communication protocol (see section 3).\nBesides this, we also used Sony digital camera model no. DSCHX5V for video recording captures general situation and participant movements for further analysis (see fig. 4). In the same room, we also prepared a table for filing a consent form before the study and a questionnaire and compensation confirmation form after the\nstudy. We decided to have this table in the same room because after giving compensation, the moderator proposes a trust game with the prototype, so we want to have the prototype in close range all the time (see fig. 4b).\nWe decided to put the prototype in the corner of the room, with the front rotated 45 degrees to the wall. This arrangement emphasizes the position of the front of the prototype while allowing the participant to walk around the prototype freely. We left space of 120 cm between the sides of the prototype and the side walls to make it possible. The initial position of the participant for each study is the same, i.e., 130 cm from the front of the prototype.

We further instructed the participants that we would measure their physiological body signals and informed them that we would need to attach a recording device to their bodies for this purpose. In fact, we attached the orientation sensor device (see fig. 2J) as described in the previous section. We did not give the participants further instructions about their actions and let them freely explore the prototype in their chosen way. The investigator asked the participant to stand approximately 1.3 meters in front of the prototype (see fig. 4b) and started video recording.

We informed them about the trust game by reading the following instructions: \u201cHere is your compensation for participating in the study. You have the option to play with the installation. You can give the installation any part of the compensation, and the installation will decide whether to multiply your compensation.

We could not find any significant differences between simple and random conditions. We attribute similar performance to them belonging to the same underlying category, i.e., unsynchronized movements. To gain a deeper understanding, we analyzed how individual subscales of the TPA questionnaire contributed to the result. We found significantly higher ratings for synchronized movements on the perceived dependability, integrity, and familiarity, as well as lower ratings for the wariness and expected underhanded behavior of the prototype.We hypothesize that this is caused by participants feeling bonded with the robot through synchronisation and perceiving a smoother interaction [82].\nOur results demonstrate a distinct influence of the motion patterns on the perceived trust toward the prototype. We collected these results using an abstract prototype to rule out the influence of a possible anthropomorphization, which has been suggested in previous work [23, 43, 71]. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis (i.e., the absence of an influence of synchronized motion on perceived trust). These results are in line with previous work investigating the influence of motion synchronization between people on perceived trust (see section 2).\nTherefore, in this paper, we have demonstrated a new strategy based on synchronization to establish a trusting relationship between humans and robots. In contrast to solutions proposed by previous work [11, 16, 51, 72], our approach does not depend on the robot\u2019s external form or complex behavior. It is thus also suitable for SNHRs. We consider our research to present a significant contribution as, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work exploring synchronization as a way to increase trust between humans and SNHRs."

Still, we could not find a significant influence of the movement of the prototype on the number of coins inserted. Also, we found no significant correlations between the TPA and the money given to the prototype.\nWe attribute this lack of a significant effect on the money given to the prototype to several factors. First, our observations and informal interviews showed that people treated the game as gambling. We assume that this is explained by the fact that the amount of compensation for participation was not high enough. Thus, the risk was low, so participants did not differentiate the amounts they wagered on the game. This is in line with findings from prior work indicating that people\u2019s averse to gambling can influence the results of the trust game [15].\nSecond, we speculate that the time between interacting with the prototype and the trust game was too long because participants had to complete the TPA in between. During the research procedure design process, we considered making the trust game a part of the interaction phase. We dismissed this idea later, however, as the gambling results would potentially override the subtle effect of synchronization on trust and influence the result of TPA. As a result, participants would assess not so much trust as satisfaction with the number of coins returned by the robot. Further, from our observation, we conclude that the participants were surprised by the proposal to insert coins into the prototype. The situation was strange and incomprehensible to them. Finally, the investigator was present in the room, so we may have measured confidence toward the investigator rather than the prototype.\nIn future studies, we recommend leaving the participant alone with the prototype during this study phase. We also recommend conducting the trust game directly after interacting with the prototype or making it a part of the free interaction phase if the trust game is the only measure."

We also avoided association with all kinds of popular robots. We are confident that the results enable a broad range of real-world application areas because everywhere where the form or complex behavior of the robot is limited, we can use dynamic, in this case, synchronization, as a means to design a trustworthy robot. However, it is an open question on how the results translate to other robot forms. For example, a robotic arm associated with an industrial robot will not eliminate the synchronization effect. Future work is necessary to conclude these challenges.\nFurther, while reviewing video recordings, we found that in the synchronized condition, at the moment when the participant discovered that the robot synchronizes with their movements, most of them had a strong positive reaction (broad and long smile) and started exploring the prototype more actively. But over time, there was boredom with the lack of new prototype behavior. This is in line with the works of Ravreby et al. [64], who found that novelty or more complex behavior, even at the cost of losing or having more difficulty in achieving synchronization, produces much better results than keeping synchronization. It would be interesting to investigate whether this effect can be reproduced in interaction with the SNHR.\nConsidering a broad body of works in HCI on human interactions mediated by technology, especially those through physical objects [8], it is an intriguing open research question of how our prototype would be perceived in such interactions. The basic idea is that the participant\u2019s moves will be mimicked by a remote prototype in front of another person and vice versa. In such a setup, we could, for example, manipulate the coupling parameter of synchronization of two humans remotely interacting, looking at their perception of the relation between them [88]."

We chose this path to provide a solid baseline and exclude influencing factors from an actual task of the system. Therefore, we analyzed synchronization as a tool for shaping the attitude toward the robot. However, it is still an open challenge how our results apply to collaborative scenarios where we as humans are working together with a system in a collaborative task.\nHere we see interesting questions in many areas. For example, for speakers with voice assistants, synchronization could increase the confidence in the assistant by giving them significant physical properties through the dynamics of movement. In such a scenario, the assistant synchronizes with the dynamics of human movements to increase affective trust. Compared to prior work, the goal is not to provide fitting gesticulation in harmony with her voice but to establish synchronization with the user. Further, with autonomous cars on the horizon, synchronization of movements of visual and physical elements of the car cockpit and other interfaces could help establish a relationship of trust, increasing the sense of comfort with unfamiliar situations and understanding the intentions of the car.\nFurther, we did not enforce or restrict any movements of the participants and, thus, deliberately left it up to the participants how and if they wanted to interact with the system. We chose this approach to avoid biasing the provided baseline in any direction by external influences and to recreate a situation in which people interact freely with a system without a specific goal. While we did not collect the movement quantities, we hypothesise, based on our observations, that the amount of movement could have an influence on the perception of trust and - vice versa - the strength of trust could have an influence on the movement of the participants.\nLastly, in some safety-critical areas, it could also be valuable to decrease trust. It may be interesting to research if the user unconsciously wants to do potentially harmful actions to himself or the machine. Then breaking synchronization can signal the user to focus attention and revise the action and, as a further consequence, decrease trust in a potentially dangerous machine. Future work is needed to conclude these challenges."

            "text": "We explored synchronization only with upper-body movements. We opted for this approach to explore the simplest possible patterns leading to synchronization at the level of body movement.\nThus, it remains an open question how other body movements, such as head nodding, gesturing with the hands, or leg movements, can bemapped to induce synchronization. Beyond bodymovements, there are different body signals like breathing rate or heartbeat, which could also be used to establish synchronization.\nOn the robot side, we have only investigated a direct mapping of the participant\u2019s movement, i.e., a chameleon-like rendering. It is an additional open question whether we can transfer synchronization patterns to other output modalities by keeping their dynamics, for example, mapping body movements to the brightness of a lamp. Further work is needed to answer these questions."

            "text": "In HRI, trust plays a crucial role and is strongly linked to persuasiveness. Under-trust or over-trust may have severe or even dangerous consequences [71]. Our results indicate that the synchronization of SNHRs to the movement patterns of human users can induce a sense of trust in people. These results can, on the one hand, provide the basis for developing systems that use this finding to more easily and quickly establish a relationship of trust with users. On the other hand, however, like different approaches to gaining and maintaining trust in robots, such as anthropomorphization, this effect can be exploited by malicious actors and lead people to trust untrustworthy entities. We consider the investigation of ethical aspects and assessing the possible dangers a vital field of research. Our work, by highlighting the role of synchronization, provides useful starting points for future work in these fields.\nAs a possible solution, certification and regulation by independent entities [79] could increase the trustworthiness of interacting with such systems. Even though synchronization can influence the relationship with the machine on an affective level (e.g., feelings, emotions), such regulation could help to ensure that robots are regarded more as tools that we use to improve our own skills and accelerate progress along our own paths [10]."

            "text": "In this paper, we explored movement synchronization as a dynamical approach that can be applied in the design of SNHRs to increase trust. We contributed by design and implementation of a prototype system and the results of a controlled experiment with 51 participants exploring our concept in a between-subjects design. We found significantly higher ratings on trust between people and automation in an established questionnaire. However, we could\nnot find an influence on the willingness to spend money in a trust game. Taken together, our results strongly suggest a positive effect of synchronized movement on the participants\u2019 feeling of trust toward an SNHR. The presented result is also important for designers because it points to dynamics as a design strategy and shows synchronization as a tool for designing trustworthy SNHRs."
