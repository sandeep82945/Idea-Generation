    "abstractText": "Wind profile radar systems require antennas with multiple radiation beams for detecting wind velocity, as well as with a low sidelobe and dual polarization for enhancing the sensitivity for the weak signal reflected from the turbulence. This paper proposes a lens antenna operating at 24 GHz with four reconfigurable beams for wind profile radars. This lens antenna includes 2 \u00d7 2 corrugated horn antennas for radiating 24 GHz waves in two polarizations, and the dielectric lens for modulating four radiation beams with a high gain and low sidelobe. Experiments demonstrate that this lens antenna can realize reconfigurable beams with deflections of \u00b115\u25e6 in dual polarizations, meanwhile with the gain of 30.58 dBi and the sidelobe of \u221220 dB. This proposed lens antenna can be applied to mmWave wind profile radars of wind turbines for enhancing wind power efficiency.",

            "text": "In recent years, climate change or global warming has been one of the upcoming focal issues, and green technology for curbing carbon dioxide emissions is in high demand [1]. Wind profile radar utilizing microwave antennas with multiple radiation beams to detect wind turbulence can be one of the green technology candidates applied to wind turbines for wind power [2,3]. Similar technology of wind profiles has been explored for forecasting weather [4\u20136]. In the WPR (Wind Profile Radar), magnitudes and directions of the wind speed are both detected via the antenna with multiple radiation beams pointing to different spatial directions [7\u20139]; thus, DBS (Doppler Beam Steering) antenna [10,11], which requires large-scale phased array antennas, and the Spaced Antenna (SA) antenna [12,13], which resembles MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) with setting up several transmitting and receiving antennas, are the typical two types of antenna. In terms of DBS antennas, as shown in [14,15], scanning beams are available but with a mechanical method or multiple antennas. In other references [16\u201319], active phase array with electrical beam scanning and operating at around 1280 MHz, 205 MHz, 449 MHz, and 2 GHz have been proposed. In these pioneer works, due to the detected wind turbulence at an altitude as high as 10,000 m, the radar antennas need to work in long wavelengths for mitigating high loss, and low frequency bands around 1 GHz are preferred. Moreover, the WPRs are usually large sizes, up to several or even 10 m; thus, these antennas employing Yagi-Uda and patch design are large and bulky. However, regarding WPR for altitudes lower than 300 m, which can be applied to wind turbines and wind sites, radars with small sizes are essential; thus, radars with low frequency have the disadvantage of large size, while mmWave can be a good candidate due to its small wavelength, compact size, and high resolution. In [20,21], mmWave phase array antennas operating in the 24\u201328 GHz band with a compact size have been proposed, but these are for mmWave communications, in which the gains are lower than 30 dBi; otherwise,\nSensors 2022, 22, 3148. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093148 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3148 2 of 11\nthe array size needs to be very large with plenty of RF chips, resulting in expensive cost and complex manufacturing. Lens antenna is another candidate to realize beam deflection by offsetting focus of the feed as in [22\u201327], which takes the advantages of spherical lens or Luneburg lens to obtain beam steering in 77 or 28 GHz bands. Moreover, a dielectric lens can be shaped to reduce cubic phase errors, thereby realizing low sidelobes, reducing the volume and weight as well [28]. Nevertheless, these lens antennas mentioned above emphasize the antenna properties of beam scanning in large angles, which are suitable for application to short-range detecting for strong signals, while for weak signals such as detecting wind turbulence, the antenna is concerned more on high gains, two polarizations, and low sidelobes. In this paper, particularly for the WPR for weak signal detecting in the altitude lower than 300 m, a mmWave lens antenna consisting of 2 \u00d7 2 corrugated horn antennas operating at 24 GHz, the dielectric lens, and reconfigurable switching control circuit are investigated. Experiments illustrate that the mmWave lens antenna combining dielectric lens and switchable horn array can obtain reconfigurable beams with high gain of 30.58 dBi, low sidelobe of \u221220 dB, and dual polarizations. It offers a good choice for applying mmWave antenna to the WPR that detects the weak signal of wind turbulence in an altitude lower than 300 m."
