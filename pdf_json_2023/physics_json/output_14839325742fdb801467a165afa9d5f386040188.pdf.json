Several strategies are being researched/\ntested for making low-cost transition metal complexes with controlled electron-density and\ncoordination flexibility around the metal center to enhance their catalytic activity. Herein, we report\na novel lutidine coordinated cobalt(II) acetate complex [(3,5-lutidine)2Co(OAc)2(H2O)2] (1) as a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Complex 1 was characterized by FT-IR, elemental\nanalysis, and single crystal X-ray diffraction data. The structure optimization of complex 1 was also done\nusing DFT calculation and the obtained geometrical parameters were found to be in good agreement\nwith the parameters obtained from the solid state structure obtained through single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction data. Further, the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps analysis of complex 1 observed\nelectron rich centers that were found to be in agreement with the solid-state structure. It was\nunderstood that the coordination of lutidine as a Lewis base and acetate moiety as a flexible ligand will\nprovide more coordination flexibility around the metal center to facilitate the catalytic reaction. Further,\nthe electron rich centers around metal center will also support the enhancement of their catalytic\nactivity. Complex 1 shows impressive OER activity, even better than the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst, in terms of turnover frequency (TOF: 0.05) and onset potential (1.50 V vs. RHE). The TOF for complex 1 is\ntwo and half times higher, while the onset potential is ca. 20 mV lower, than the benchmark IrO2 catalyst studied under identical conditions."

Initially, precious metals (Pt, Ir and Ru) based catalysts were focused due to their robust nature and high activity.6\u201310 In the recent past, the demand for cost-effective earth-abundant transition metal based electrocatalysts has accelerated to overcome the high cost and lower abundance of precious metals.11\u201314 However, the OER activity of these transitionmetalbased catalysts has not been comparable to the Pt-group metals. Hence, the foremost challenge for chemists is to design and develop novel cost-effective, earth abundant and highly efficient catalysts as well as strategies to boost their activity for OER.\nCobalt-based catalysts have been signicantly studied to facilitate the OER.15,16 For instance, cobalt oxides,17\u201320 hydroxides,21,22 suldes,23\u201325 selenides,26,27 phosphates/phosphides,28,29 and nitrides30,31 have been established as advanced electrocatalyst for OER. Beside these materials, several molecular cobalt complexes have also been found as efficient electrocatalyst for OER in recent times.32\u201338 D. G.

T. Groves et al. reported a cationic cobalt\u2013porphyrin complex as an efficient homogeneous electrocatalyst for water oxidation to study the role of buffer on the reactivity.33 C. N. Verani et al. designed a novel phenolate rich cobalt(III) complex which acts as an excellent water oxidation catalyst at moderate overpotential of 0.5 V.34 L. Sun et al. used cobalt porphyrin complexes as OER catalysts and found that the in situ generation of cobalt oxides thin lm acts as a real catalyst.35 Recently, M. Nath et al. reported a cobalt complex bearing selelno-based ligand as OER electrocatalyst with very low overpotential of 320 mV.37 Zhen-Tao Yu et al. reported a cobalt(IV) diacetato complex bearing a substituted bipyridine dianionic ligand as highly active electrocatalyst for OER at an overpotential of only 360 mV at pH = 6.38 In case of molecular cobalt catalyst, many research groups reported that the in situ formation of Co(OH)2/cobalt oxide are the true catalyst.19,35,39\nHowever, the nature of in situ generated catalyst depends upon the molecular nature of parent catalyst and hence the efficacy of the catalyst solely depends on role of parent complex. Overall, these representative examples of Co-complex based OER catalysts highlights the chemistry of ligands towards controlling the electron-density around the Co-metal center or an ability to partially oxidize the complex to make thin lms of cobalt oxide. Hence, it was thought that the Lewis base ligand can control the electron-density aroundmetal center to enhance their catalytic activity. Further, the coordination of Lewis base and acetate moiety will provide more coordination exibility around metal center which supports the substrate coordination/removal during catalysis to facilitate the reaction cycle.38,40 In this view, we report a novel cost-effective lutidine coordinated cobalt(II) acetate complex [(3,5-lutidine)2Co(OAc)2(H2O)2] (1) as promising electrocatalytic activator for OER. The obtained data aer OER electrocatalytic analysis indicates that complex 1 is better performer than the state-ofthe-art IrO2 catalyst."

Larger the HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gap, greater the stability and lower is the chemical reactivity of the molecule and vice versa.50,51 From the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) diagram, it has been observed that the electron density is densely accumulated around the metal ion and oxygen atoms in HOMO, while it is dispersed on and around the pyridine rings in LUMO. A slightly more gathered electronic density at the metal center is observed in HOMO\u22121.

The scale having different colors here indicates varied electrostatic potentials within a molecular system.52 The order of potentials from low to high goes as red < orange < yellow < green < blue. On one end of the scale, the blue color suggests the presence of electropositive potential, while on the other end, the red color indicates the electronegative potentials, and the green color species zero potential. In this way, we can understand the relative polarity of a particular system.53,54 In the present case, we observe a deep red color at the oxygen centers of acetate ligand while a positive potential around the substituted pyridine ring.

The reduced gradient of density (RDG) plots reveals information about weak, intramolecular, and intermolecular interactions.55,56 E. R. Johnson rst introduced the RDG function, which is density and its rst derivative together, representing the divergence from homogeneous electronic distribution.57 It is a dimensionless quantity.

In a certain system, l3 differs along the internuclear direction, whereas the other two components (viz. l1 and l2) describe the variation of density in the plane normal to that of l3 eigenvector. The value of eigenvector l2 mainly suggests the type of interaction present in a system. For bonding interactions, such as H-bond, the value of l2 < 0, while for non-bonding interactions l2 is greater than zero. The value of l2 is nearly zero for weak van der Waals interactions.57,58 The colors in RDG plot also suggest these interactions visually.

The current density normalized with ECSA was also shown in Fig. 7d, indicating the good electrocatalytic activity of Co-complex 1 in terms of high\nr OER\nFig. 7 The CVs (cyclic voltammograms) at different scan rates in the capacitive region for (a) IrO2 and (b) complex 1, (c) the plot of current vs. scan rates for Cdl calculation, (d) the comparison of LSV curves normalized by ECSA for complex 1 and IrO2.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The post catalytic FTIR (Fig. SI-3a in ESI\u2020) shows the peak at 3431 cm\u22121 corresponding to the \u2013OH vibration, 2921 cm\u22121 for Co\u2013OH stretching. The peak present at 1633 cm\u22121 corresponds to Co\u2013O.62,63 These peaks in the post OER FTIR suggests that the formation of Co(OH)2/CoOOH could act as the main active sites for the OER. However, along with these, some peaks matching with the initial spectra at 1038 and 1153 cm\u22121 indicate that the complex 1 is not totally degraded/decomposed aer catalysis. The spectra suggests that the oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III) occurs at high oxidation\nFig. 9 XPS core level spectra comparison of (a) Co 2p, (b) O 1s, (c) C 1s\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The EDX spectra as shown in Fig. SI-4a in ESI\u2020) indicates the presence of C, N, Co and O in the Cocomplex (1). Aer catalysis (Fig. SI-4b in ESI\u2020), the EDX of the sample displays an increase in the O content as well as presence of Co, C, N and K (due to KOH as electrolyte) indicating the presence of Co(OH)2 at the surface of the catalyst. The elemental mapping (Fig. SI-5 in ESI\u2020) shows the uniform distribution of the elements on the surface before and aer catalysis which indicates that the complex is not totally changed to hydroxide species. This suggests that formation of thin layer of Co(OH)2/CoOOH can be the reason for high activity of Co-complex (1) towards OER.\nThe X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed to further understand the chemical composition and oxidation state in the pre and post catalytic OER samples as shown in Fig. 9. The Co 2p core level spectra of Co-complex (1) (Fig. 9a) shows two peak at 780.85 eV (Co2+ 2p3/2) and 796.49 eV (Co 2+ 2p1/2) and two strong satellite peaks conrming the presence of Co2+ in the sample. Aer OER analysis, the slight shi of the Co2+ peak to 780.19 eV and the appearance of Co3+ peak at 782.18 eV is in accordance with the FTIR analysis, conrming that the formation of Co(OH)2 and CoOOH at the surface.64 The M\u2013O and M\u2013OH peak intensity increases in the post catalytic O 1s spectra (Fig. 9b) also showing the formation of Co(OH)2 at the surface. The C 1s XPS spectra shows the presence of C\u2013C\nand (d) N 1s before and after catalysis of Co-complex (1).\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 24450\u201324459 | 24457\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Aer catalysis, the relative composition of C\u2013C decreases and C\u2013O increases. This indicates the oxidation of C due to the oxidative environment provided by OER. Similarly the occurance of N\u2013O peak in N 1s spectra is also due to oxidation. Thus, the post catalytic XPS, FTIR and EDX analysis conrmed the retention of the electrocatalyst in terms of bulk composition, and formation of Co2+ (Co(OH)2) and Co\n3+ (CoOOH) plays a crucial role during OER.\nThe high OER performance of the Co-complex (1) may have been resulted due to its highly porous connected network, high accessible Co active centres and high surface area. The interconnected network arising from the OH/O hydrogen bonding leads to a 3-D structure with hexagonal vacant pores which helped inenhancing mass transfer and ion transport at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface leading to high electrocatalytic performance of the Co-complex 1."

            "text": "We have the novel lutidine coordinated cobalt(II) acetate complex [(3,5-lutidine)2Co(OAc)2(H2O)2] (1) by simplest condensation reaction. The structure of complex 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction data and found distorted octahedral geometry around the metal center. The noncovalent interaction found in complex 1 resulted in O\u2013H/O hydrogen-bonding network that grown in a three-dimensional structure with various hexagonal vacant pore which could be useful for enhancing their catalytic activity. The comparative study of geometrical parameters obtained from the XRD data and DFT calculations was found in good agreement. The MEP maps analysis depicted the electron rich centers in the complex 1 are also found well in agreement with the solid-state structure. It was thought that the coordination exibility and electron rich centers around metal center will also support in the enhancement of their catalytic activity. The Co-complex 1 showed excellent electrocatalytic OER activity better than state-of-the-art IrO2, which may be due to the 3D porous structure, rapid transport of ions and high accessible Co active sites, higher electron density, and coordination exibility around metal center. Further, the post catalytic XPS, FTIR and EDX analysis also conrmed the retention of the electrocatalyst in terms of bulk composition, and formation of Co2+ (Co(OH)2) and Co 3+ (CoOOH) OER."
