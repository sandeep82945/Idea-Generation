The sample consisted of 959 adolescents aged 10\u201317 (49.5% boys). Participants completed the Chinese version VIA Youth-96, along with the Perceived Parental Autonomy Support Scale, and questionnaires assessing life satisfaction and self-e cacy online. The Chinese version VIA Youth-96 showed a good fit for the original four-factor structure, and CS scores were significantly correlated with life satisfaction and self-e cacy indicating a good criterion validity of the scale. The internal consistency was 0.54\u20130.86 for subscales. Moreover, this study revealed significant age-related changes in CSs among adolescents, eight CSs significantly linearly declined by age. These results suggested that the Chinese version VIA Youth-96 is a valid tool for assessing CSs in adolescents and that CSs are declined linearly by age during adolescence.\nKEYWORDS\ncharacter strength, VIA Youth-96, age-related changes, adolescent, parental autonomy support, parental psychological control\nIntroduction\nIdentifying individual strengths of character and fostering them is crucial to positive youth development (Park, 2004). Character strengths (CSs) are a set of morally valued character traits that are critical to a good life (Peterson and Seligman, 2004) and mental health (Peterson and Seligman, 2004; McGrath, 2015). Consistent evidence showed that higher CSs are associated with a higher level of life satisfaction [a distinct construct\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nrepresenting a cognitive and global evaluation of the quality of one\u2019s life as a whole (Pavot and Diener, 2008)] (Park and Peterson, 2006; Ruch et al., 2014; Bruna et al., 2019; Mart\u00ednezMart\u00ed et al., 2020) as well as self-efficacy [an individual\u2019s belief in their capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments (Bandura, 1977)] (Ruch et al., 2014; Casali et al., 2021). Adolescents with a higher level of CSs are happier, do better at school, are more popular among peers, and have fewer psychological and behavioral problems (Park, 2009). For example, several studies showed that the love of learning and perseverance were particularly beneficial to a series of educational outcomes (Wagner and Ruch, 2015; Weber et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2020). In addition, CSs were protective factors that allow for better resilience to stress and likely prevent depression (Padilla-Walker et al., 2020). Intervention programs that aimed at encouraging recognition and use of one\u2019s CSs increased life satisfaction, positive affect, classroom engagement, and even academic performance (Lavy, 2019).\nThe Values in Action (VIA) classification (Peterson and Seligman, 2004) defined 24 CSs, i.e., appreciation of beauty and excellence, bravery, creativity, curiosity, fairness, forgiveness, gratitude, honesty, hope, humility, humor, judgment, kindness, leadership, love, love of learning, perseverance, perspective, prudence, self-regulation, social intelligence, spirituality, teamwork, and zest. These CSs were organized into six core virtues, namely wisdom and knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. Based on the VIA classification, the VIA Inventory for Youth (VIA-Youth) has been developed to measure individual CSs for adolescents (Park and Peterson, 2006). The short version VIA-Youth (VIA Youth-96), used in this study, was developed based on the original 198-item VIA-Youth by selecting four items per scale with the highest corrected item-total correlations. The internal consistency of the English version VIA Youth-96 was 0.69\u20130.93 across scales. The VIA Institute also provides a Chinese version VIA Youth-96, but it is still considered \u201cin development\u201d as the reliability and validity of this translation were unclear.\nThe original article of Park and Peterson (2006) revealed a four-factor model of the VIA-Youth. Subsequent studies mostly revealed similar, but not identical, solutions to the original article, generating either a four (McGrath and Walker, 2016) or five-factor (Gillham et al., 2011; Toner et al., 2012; Ruch et al., 2014) solution [see Wagner and Ruch (2022) for a review]. Recently, Jabbari et al. (2021) replicated the original four-factor model using the Farsi version VIA-Youth. Yet, Van Eeden et al. (2008) found that the South African version VIAYouth is more unidimensional than multi-dimensional. The structure of the Chinese version VIA Youth-96 was unknown. One possible reason for the discrepancy in the literature is that the high-order structure of CSs, like other characters, is still evolving from unity to differentiation throughout adolescence and therefore is not stable enough (Shubert et al., 2019). From this perspective, a factor analysis of the Chinese version VIA\nYouth-96 could shed some light on the possible commonality of CSs during adolescence.\nSimilar to other personality traits, CSs were proposed to be relatively stable but flexible enough to allow for further development (Peterson and Seligman, 2004). Research on the six-month temporal stability of the VIA-Youth has obtained significant test-retest correlations of around 0.60 (Park and Peterson, 2006). The relational developmental system (RDS) theory posits that development results from interactive, relational processes between individuals and their contexts that unfold over time and individuals (Overton, 2015). Shubert et al. (2019) applied RDS and the orthogenetic principle to character development and found character structure proceeded from being largely diffuse, which was global in late childhood and more differentiated across adolescence. Specifically, in elementary school, children often have overly positive views of their competencies, while when they enter middle school; the youth will explore a multitude of possible selves and characteristics, which could appear to be a dip in self-evaluation (Harter, 2015). From this sense, a better understanding of the lifespan developmental trajectory of CSs could shed some light on the ongoing efforts of promoting positive youth development (Park, 2004).\nGenerally, CSs were proposed to be slowly increasing by age, but with a dip during adolescence. A recent meta-analysis on cross-sectional studies revealed a significant age difference in 23 of the 24 CSs across the lifespan (from 10 to 65+ years), with 91% of the effects indicating higher levels of the CSs with age, but two CSs (creativity and zest) showed a dip from young (10\u2013 12 years) to middle (13\u201315 years) adolescence (Heintz and Ruch, 2021). During adulthood, several cross-sectional studies showed that the trajectory of CSs was generally slowly increasing by age, especially after the age of 18 (Linley et al., 2007; Baumann et al., 2020). One longitudinal study investigated changes in CSs of adulthood (mostly middle-aged participants, 27\u201357 years old) in two samples from German-speaking countries across 3.5 years and found that CSs remained stable during the follow-up period (Gander et al., 2020). During adolescence, two studies noted a dip during late childhood and adolescence (age 10\u201317), where CSs were negatively associated with age (Ruch et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2020). Studies looking at a narrower age range (e.g., age 12\u201314), however, revealed mixed results (Park and Peterson, 2003, 2006; Ferragut et al., 2014; Kabakci et al., 2019). Only one longitudinal study, as we know, examined the development of CSs across 3 years during adolescence (from age 12 to 14), and found that CSs remained stable during that period (Ferragut et al., 2014).\nMost previous studies of CSs were carried out with samples from Western societies. Although the CSs were proposed to be universal among cultures (Peterson and Seligman, 2004), it is unclear if there are cultural differences development trajectory of CSs. Given that CSs can be influenced by contextual factors like culture and parenting (Park and Peterson, 2003; Peterson\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nand Seligman, 2004), it is interesting to ask if the same pattern would be evident in Eastern countries like China. Another issue is that it is unclear if the age-CSs relationship during adolescence is linear or non-linear. Especially, if the \u201cdip\u201d during adolescence end before 17 years old, a u-shape curve (i.e., a quadratic function) would fit the data better than a straight line.\nParenting plays a crucial role in fostering good character in youths (Park, 2004). Among factors related to parenting, parental autonomy support and psychological control have been documented as two of the most important factors that influence youths\u2019 development and functioning (Deci and Ryan, 2000). According to the self-determination theory, autonomy is one of the three basic psychological needs (the other two being competence and relatedness) that is essential and universal nutrient for psychological growth and adjustment (Deci and Ryan, 2000). Parental autonomy support refers to parenting behavior of respect and satisfaction for children\u2019s need for autonomy, e.g., parents\u2019 empathy and respect for children\u2019s ideas and feelings, and to supporting the children\u2019s independent expression and decision (Grolnick et al., 1997). Parental psychological control is essentially an autonomy-thwarting parenting dimension, referred to as parents\u2019 regulation of children\u2019s feelings and thoughts (Barber et al., 2005). Parental autonomy support was related to many psychological and educational benefits such as better emotional wellbeing, lower depression, and fewer problem behaviors (e.g., depression, anxiety, delinquent, and aggressive behavior) (Grolnick et al., 1991; Pomerantz and Wang, 2009; Griffith and Grolnick, 2014; Vrolijk et al., 2020). Moreover, perceived parental psychological control was related to maladjustment and even psychopathology in adolescents, including depressive and anxiety symptoms, anxiety, and low self-esteem (Barber, 1996; Pettit et al., 2001; Soenens et al., 2005). One recent study found that parental autonomy support was associated with greater grit (a personality trait involving perseverance and passion for long-term goals in the face of adversity) in emerging adults (Lan et al., 2019). However, it is unclear if and how parental autonomy support and psychological control would affect the changes of CSs in adolescents.\nThis study aimed to preliminary examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese version VIA Youth-96, and examine the age-related changes in CSs among adolescents. We also assessed the impact of parental autonomy support and psychological control on age-related changes. Based on previous studies, we propose the following hypotheses: (1) all CSs would associate with higher life satisfaction and self-efficacy. (2) CSs would generally decrease during adolescence, the ageCSs association could either be linear or non-linear. (3) Parental autonomy support would slow down the slope of decreasing, while parental psychological control may accelerate it. These hypotheses were not preregistered."

The scale consists of 96 items, each rated on a Likert scale of five points (from 1 = not like me at all to 5= very much like me). These items questionnaire assesses 24 CSs among youth. The internal consistency of the Chinese VIA Youth-96 subscales was 0.54\u20130.86 in this study (Table 1).\nSatisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). SWLS is a five-item scale where people judge whether their life is satisfying (Diener et al., 1985). It uses a seven-point scale (from 1= strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The internal consistency of the scale was 0.81 for this research.\nGeneral Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE). GSE consists of 10 items using a four-point Likert-style format (from 1 = strongly disagree to 4= strongly agree) (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995). The internal consistency of GSE in this study was 0.88.\nPerceived Parental Autonomy Support Scale (PPASS). P-PASS is a 24-item self-report scale that assesses precepted parental autonomy support and psychological control (Mageau et al., 2015). Twelve items measure the perceptions of autonomy-supportive behaviors. The remaining 12 items measure the perception of psychological control behaviors. Participants rated items in terms of how applicable each statement was to their relationship with their parents (mother and father were rated separately) on a Likert-type scale from 1 (do not agree at all) to 7 (very strongly agree). In this study, the internal consistency for parental autonomy support and psychological control was both 0.95.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org"

For item analysis, we calculated corrected item-total correlations of each item with its corresponding subscales. Then, to examine the internal consistency of the Chinese version VIA Youth-96, we calculated Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 and McDonald\u2019s omega for each subscale (McDonald, 1999). Following previous literature on CFA (e.g., Little et al., 2002), the unidimensionality of each subscale (based on the items) was examined, using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012), before aggregating the items in terms of CS scores.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nTo assess if the original four-factor model (Park and Peterson, 2006) applies to the Chinese VIA Youth-96, confirmative factor analysis (CFA) was carried out using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). A bifactor model, with four specific factors according to the four-factor model (i.e., temperance strengths, intellectual strengths, theological strengths, and other-directed strengths) and a general factor that was hypothesized to account for the commonality of items, was specified and tested. To justify the inclusion of a general factor, we also specified another four-factor model without the general factor and compared these two models. We considered acceptable model fit as the Tucker\u2013Lewis index (TLI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.90 (Bentler, 1990), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.10 (MacCallum et al., 1996). The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were considered to compare the models, and the lowest value was considered the most appropriate. In the bifactor model, internal consistency is affected by both specific and general variance (Rodriguez et al., 2016); thus, to aid the interpretation of the total and subscale scores, we calculated omega hierarchical (\u03c9h) and hierarchical subscale (\u03c9hs). Coefficient\u03c9h indicates the variance attributed to the single general factor, while \u03c9hs reflects the reliability of a subscale score after controlling for the variance due to the general factor (Reise et al., 2013).\nMoreover, to examine the criterion validity of the Chinese VIAYouth-96, correlations between CSs and life satisfaction and general self-efficacy were calculated using Pearson\u2019s correlation. The statistical threshold was set at p < 0.002 (0.05/24 Bonferroni corrected)."

Similarly, scores of gratitude (\u03b2 = \u22120.30, 95%CI = [\u22120.45, \u22120.16], p < 0.001) and love (\u03b2 = \u22120.52, 95%CI = [\u22120.69, \u22120.34], p < 0.001) significantly decreased by age in participants with higher parental psychological control,\nbut not in those with lower parental psychological control (Figure 3)."

            "text": "This study provided reliability and validity of the Chinese version VIA Youth-96 and tested age-related changes in CSs. The Chinese version VIA Youth-96 showed a good fit for the original four-factor structure, and CS scores were significantly correlated with life satisfaction and self-efficacy, indicating a good structural and criterion validity of the scale. The internal consistency was 0.54\u20130.86 for subscales. Moreover, this study revealed significant age-related changes in CSs among adolescents, eight CSs significantly linearly declined by age.\nOur CFA confirmed a good fit of the original four-factor model for the Chinese version VIA Youth-96. This result was in line with the study of English (Park and Peterson, 2006) and Farsi version VIA Youth-96 (Jabbari et al., 2021), suggesting that the four-factor model may be applicable in multiple cultures, including the Chinese context. Further reliability analysis,\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nhowever, revealed high \u03c9h (0.83) but low \u03c9hs (0.05\u20130.22) of the four-factor structure, indicating that the vast majority of reliable variance is attributable to a single common source, rather than the specific factors. The existence of a general factor highlights the commonality of items and indicates that there could be a common basis for all CSs and the four specific factors are not reliable enough. This explanation also reflects the unity-to-differentiation pattern of character development across adolescence (Shubert et al., 2019). In short, given the low reliability of specific factors, applying the four-factor model to this scale requires extra caution.\nIn the second part of this study, we examined the relationship between age and CSs in the present sample (covering an age range from 10 to 17 years) and found that eight of the CSs were linearly decreased across age. Our curve\nestimation showed that almost all (23/24) CSs were decreasing linearly by age till 17 years old. This result was in line with the findings of Ruch et al. (2014) and Brown et al. (2020), where CSs scores were linearly decreased with age during adolescence. Additionally, the sample of these two studies was composed of adolescents from many cultures [125 countries for Brown et al. (2020) and two countries for Ruch et al. (2014)]; our results together with these findings suggest that the linear decline of CSs during adolescents could be identical cross-cultures (Ruch et al., 2014). Importantly, the specific CSs (i.e., bravery, curiosity, fairness, honesty, love, love of learning, perseverance, and zest) showing a linear decrease in our results were identical to the findings of Brown et al. (2020). Just as RDS theory suggests that development is the result of an interactive relational process that unfolds over time and personally between\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nan individual and their environment, character constructs proceed from a global state to become increasingly differentiated with age (Werner, 1957; Overton, 2015). For adolescents, their surroundings become more complex with age, and adolescents may feel uncertain about their ability to navigate mature social environments and therefore perceive themselves as incapable of demonstrating these strengths. In addition, the declining pattern of CSs in the current results also agreed with the disruption hypothesis of personality development which proposes that the biological, social, and psychological transitions during adolescence were accompanied by a temporary decline in some aspects of personality maturity (Soto and Tackett, 2015). Our findings may shed some light on the development of interventions to enhance CSs in adolescents.\nThis study revealed a close association between CSs and parental autonomy support and psychological control. Particularly, autonomy support was positively correlated with CSs, while psychological control showed the opposite effect. These results in the present study largely correspond with previous findings that autonomy support is related to the superior psychological development of youth, while psychological control does the opposite (Grolnick et al., 1991; Barber, 1996; Pettit et al., 2001; Soenens et al., 2005; Pomerantz and Wang, 2009; Griffith and Grolnick, 2014; Vrolijk et al., 2020), particularly the findings of autonomy support associated with a greater level of character among late adolescents and early adults (Lan et al., 2019). Note that, the correlation between autonomy support and CSs (median r = 0.36, range = [0.22, 0.49]) was higher than between CSs and age (median r =\u22120.08, range = [\u22120.14, 0.02]), suggesting that perceived parental autonomy support has the potential to alter the effect of age on CSs. According to the self-determination theory, the need for autonomymust be satisfied for individuals to experience healthy growth and development, and parents are the main socializing agents in youth life (Lekes et al., 2010). Parental autonomy support is, therefore, an important factor in the development of children and adolescents. Our results hence highlight that parental autonomy support (and maybe lower psychological control) could provide a basis for encouraging personal CSs to grow (Lavy, 2019).\nOur moderation analyses revealed a significant impact of parental autonomy support and psychological control on the association between age and CSs. The moderation effects indicated that particular CSs (namely fairness, gratitude, and love) were decreased by age only in the case of high autonomy support or high psychological control; otherwise, they would remain relatively stable across adolescence. High autonomy support and high psychological control hence seem necessary to maintain the \u201cnormal\u201d (declining) trajectory of changes in CSs. The result that high parental psychological control seems necessary for youth to exhibit a \u201cnormal\u201d developmental trajectory of CSs may seem counterintuitive, as parental\npsychological control was usually related to \u201cbad\u201d psychological consequences (Barber, 1996; Pettit et al., 2001; Soenens et al., 2005). These results may be accounted for by the East\u2013West culture differences in the attitude toward parental control. There was evidence that a certain degree of parental control could be tolerable and beneficial for Chinese youth, but not for Western youth (Grusec et al., 1997). Note that, although the moderator effects were significant after correction, our samples were relatively small for an analysis considering statistical interactions (Gelman et al., 2020). Therefore, these effects need to be interpreted with caution, and replication of this finding is necessary.\nThe research has some limitations. First, this study was a cross-sectional study, a longitudinal design is needed to examine the stability of CSs in future studies. Second, the sample size of this study is relatively small, which could limit the generalizability of our conclusions. Third, the test\u2013retest reliability of the Chinese version VIA Youth96 was not assessed; further studies on the temporal reliability of the scale are warranted. Finally, only the VIA Youth-96 was tested in this study, our results thus should not be applied to the full version (the 198-item version) VIA-Youth."

The finding supports the use of the Chinese version VIA Youth-96 for the assessment of CSs among Chinese youth. This study also provided clear evidence for a pattern of declining CSs by age from 10 to 17, and that parental autonomy support and psychological control significantly moderated the association between age and CSs. These findings should contribute meaningfully to further research and provide critical information for parents and those who are interested in the intervention of adolescents\u2019 CS."
