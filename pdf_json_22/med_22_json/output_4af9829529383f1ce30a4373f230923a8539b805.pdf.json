            "text": "An adolescent boy was brought by his parents with an 8- year history of increased elasticity of skin and flexibility of multiple joints. He also had associated bilateral knee joint pain for the last 6 months. The child\u2019s grandfather also had similar abnormal joint hypermobility. The medical history revealed a malunion of supracondylar fracture of the right humerus, which led to a gun- stock deformity. Cutaneous examination showed hyperelastic skin with a congenital melanocytic nevus over the right forearm. The joints were hypermobile with a Beighton score (BS) of 8 (figure 1, video 1). Hyperextension of the right elbow was not performed due to the gunstock deformity. There was no scoliosis or joint dislocation. Routine haematological and urine investigations did not reveal any abnormality. Neurological, cardiac and ophthalmological evaluation was found to be normal. A diagnosis of hypermobile EhlersDanlos Syndrome (hEDS) was established as the child satisfied the 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers- Danlos Syndromes criteria. Oral analgesics were prescribed for chronic knee joint pain along with knee stabilising braces. Health education regarding proper posture maintenance and mild strengthening exercise was provided to the patient.\nEDS is a rare autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder affecting the skin and joints. There is a defect in the collagen metabolism that leads to the deposition of disordered collagen. Depending on the type of collagen affected, it has been classified into various phenotypes. Hypermobile EDS is one of the subtypes characterised by generalised hypermobility of joints, recurrent joint dislocations, chronic joint pain and osteoarthritic changes. Skin is usually soft, mildly hyperextensible with easy\nFigure 1 (A\u2013H) performance of various manoeuvres of Beighton scoring system in our patient.\nVideo 1 A video demonstration of Beighton score in a hypermobile Ehlers- Danlos syndrome patient.\nP atna (IIT P atna).

Patients may also have autonomic dysfunction with orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal symptoms.1\nBS is an internationally recognised screening tool introduced in 1973 for the assessment of generalised joint hypermobility\n(GJH). This nine- point scoring system requires the performance of five manoeuvres, which include four bilateral passive and one active performance (table 1). According to Beighton, the original cut-offvalueforGJHwas\u22655,1\u20133 However, since the mobility of joints decreases with age, the International Consortium on the Ehlers- Danlos Syndrome Committee proposed the following criterionofBSforGJHinhEDSas(1)BS\u22656foradolescents and prepubertal children, (2) \u22655 for men and women from pubertyto50yearsofageand(3)\u22654above50yearsofage.The limitations of this scoring system are as follows: (1) Examination of only a few joints and (2) \u2018All or none\u2019 nature, that is, cannot assess the degree of joint hypermobility. This case reiterates the importance of the BS in the diagnosis of joint hypermobility disorders.1\nContributors AS: preparation of the manuscript. VP: preparation of the video.
