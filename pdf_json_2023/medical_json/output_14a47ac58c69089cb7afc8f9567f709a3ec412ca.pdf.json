    "abstractText": "During interphase, the newly duplicated pairs of centrosomes are held together by a centrosome linker, and the centrosome separation needs the disruption of this linker to induce the duplicated centrosomes separating into two distinct microtubule organization centers. The mechanism of regulating centrosome separation is however poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of PHF5A at Y36 by the TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade plays a critical role in regulating centrosome separation. PHF5A, a well-characterized spliceosome component, is enriched in the centrosome. The pY36-PHF5A promotes the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A in a spliceosomal-independent manner, which leads to premature centrosome separation. Furthermore, the unmatured centrosome remodels the microtubule and subsequently regulates cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation cascade of TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1-PHF5A is hyper-regulated in medulloblastoma. The inhibition of this cascade can induce senescence and restrict the proliferation of medulloblastoma. Our findings on this phosphorylation cascade in regulating centrosome separation could provide a series of potential targets for restricting the progress of medulloblastoma.",

The mechanism of regulating centrosome separation is however poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of PHF5A at Y36 by the TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade plays a critical role in regulating centrosome separation. PHF5A, a well-characterized spliceosome component, is enriched in the centrosome. The pY36-PHF5A promotes the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A in a spliceosomal-independent manner, which leads to premature centrosome separation. Furthermore, the unmatured centrosome remodels the microtubule and subsequently regulates cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, we found that the phosphorylation cascade of TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1-PHF5A is hyper-regulated in medulloblastoma. The inhibition of this cascade can induce senescence and restrict the proliferation of medulloblastoma. Our findings on this phosphorylation cascade in regulating centrosome separation could provide a series of potential targets for restricting the progress of medulloblastoma.\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:98 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-023-05561-1"

            "text": "The centrosome is the most important microtubule organization center in mammalian cells, which regulates spindle formation and cell division in the mitotic cell cycle and influents cell migration, motility, and cellular organelles organization [1]. During the cell cycle, the older centrosome disengages in the G1 phase and duplicates in the S phase to form a pair of new centrosomes once per cell cycle and moves apart to form the opposing mitotic poles [2]. During the centrosome maturation, the pericentriolar materials are recruited and surrounded by the centrosome [3]. The duplicated mature centrosomes anchor and nucleate microtubule via the gamma-tubulin ring complex in the pericentriolar materials [4]. The opposing centrosomes and the parallel microtubule bundles function as the mitotic spindle and help to align the sister chromatid paired for accurate chromosome segregation [5]. The structure, function, and number of the centrosome are strictly controlled in cells to ensure the cellular process [6]. The numerical centrosome abnormality is the most common dysfunction of the centrosome [6]. The overduplication, mitosis failure, or improper centrosome separation cause the increase of centrosome number which may result in multipolar mitosis and generate chromosomal instability [7, 8]. During the G1 phase, the mother and daughter centrioles are held together by a proteinaceous linker between the proximal ends of the centrioles. To form the mitotic spindle, the\ncentrosome linker is disassembled to facilitate the new pair of centrosome disjunctions [1]. Two important components of centrosome linker are CEP250 and rootletin. CEP250 is located at the proximal ends of the centrioles, and functions as the docking site for rootletin [9]. Rootletin assembles into filaments with other proteins, like CEP68 and LRRC45, which binds to CEP250 for centriole attachment [10, 11]. During the late G2 phase and early M phase, CEP250 and rootletin are phosphorylated by NIMA-related kinase 2 (Nek2), which is activated by the CDK1 cascade or growth factor cascade [10]. After phosphorylation, CEP250 is disassembled from the centrosome which causes centrosome disjunction [12]. The disassembled centrosomes move to the opposing mitotic poles with the force of microtubule at the onset of mitosis [13]. CEP250-Nek2A phosphorylation cascade plays a critical role in the regulation of centrosome separation and the cell cycle process. The kinasedead Nek2A causes the accumulation of multiple centrosomes due to the centrosome separation failure, which increases the degree of aneuploidy and chromosomal instability [14, 15]. Depletion of CEP250 or overexpression of Nek2 also induces premature centrosome separation independent of the cell cycle phase, which leads to the formation of multipolar mitosis with disengaged centrioles [16\u201318]. Multipolar mitosis causes cell asymmetric divisions and chromosomal instability [19]. As the microtubule organization center, the centrosome also regulates\nReceived: 3 August 2022 Revised: 22 December 2022 Accepted: 5 January 2023\n1Department of Medical Genetics, Center for Medical Genetics, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China. 2Department of Pathology, Peking University School of Basic Medical Science; Peking University Third Hospital, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China. 3Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Beijing Key Laboratory of Protein Posttranslational Modifications and Cell Function, Center for Medical Genetics, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China. 4Present address: Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA. \u2709email: qingchang@bjmu.edu.cn; luojianyuan@bjmu.edu.cn Edited by Professor Nickolai Barlev\nwww.nature.com/cddis\nOfficial journal of CDDpress\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nmicrotubule nucleation and stabilization in mammalian cells [20]. The abnormal centrosome, especially numerical abnormality, affects microtubule density [21]. The proper density of the microtubule network and microtubule-dependent peri-centrosomal assembly ensure the correct location and morphology of the Golgi complex which determines the cell-polarized migration [21, 22]. Due to the importance of the centrosome, the precise timing of centrosome separation and the correct structure of the mitotic spindle ensure the process of mitosis and microtubule organization. During pre-mRNA maturation, the spliceosome recognizes and removes intron. PHF5A is a crucial scaffolding component presenting in the spliceosome U2 snRNP complex, and forms the branch point pocket with SF3B1 [23]. The mutation of PHF5A could cause resistance to splicing inhibitors [24]. PHF5A can promote colorectal cancer progression by regulating alternative splicing [25, 26]. Besides functions in splicing, PHF5A also has been found that it could play spliceosome-independent functions. It stabilizes the Paf1 transcriptional complex in pluripotent embryonic stem cells' self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency [27]. Also, PHF5A stabilized the p400 histone chaperone complex and was involved in DNA repair [16]. TrkA, as a canonical receptor tyrosine kinase, is activated by its ligand NGF and transduces the phosphorylation cascade in regulating neurogenesis, cell differentiation, and proliferation [28]. ABL1 showed a pericentriolar matrix location in a growth factor-dependent signaling mechanism [29]. The crosstalk between NGF-TrkA and ABL1 in the centrosome has not been reported. Medulloblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in children over the age of 3\u20135 years. Medulloblastoma has been categorized into four subgroups named Wnt, Shh, Goup3, and Group4 [30]. In Shh-medulloblastoma, the highly conserved Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is abnormally activated which causes the primary cilium abundance [31]. There are several regulators involved in the Hh pathway, including the Suppressor of fused (Sufu) [32]. Sufu localizes to the centrosome and plays an important role in centrosome duplication, suggesting the correlation between Shh-medulloblastoma and centrosome [33]. Since the metastasis of medulloblastoma remains the major cause of mortality in children, an improved understanding of the molecular events driving metastasis represents a major priority for medulloblastoma research [34]. In this study, we found that the phosphorylated PHF5A at site Y36 locates in the centrosome, and regulates centrosome separation by promoting the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A. The phosphorylation of PHF5A-Y36 is regulated by the TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade with the centrosome translocation of ABL1. The hyperphosphorylation of PHF5A-Y36 is observed in the Shh- medulloblastoma with the upregulation of the TrkA-ABL1 cascade and promotes the proliferation and migration of medulloblastoma cells. The TrkA-ABL1-PHF5A cascade could be a series of potential targets to restrict medulloblastoma progress.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Transgenic mice and cell lines NeuroD2:SmoA1 mice (#008831) were purchased from Jackson Labs.

On their interaction interface, there are two important contact sides in PHF5A, Y36, and Y51/ Y54 [39]. Since the regulation of the interaction between PHF5A and SF3B1 is important for alternative splicing, we speculated that Y36 and Y51/Y54 of PHF5A could be phosphorylated to regulate the interaction of PHF5A and SF3B1. To confirm this hypothesis, we first used the PhosphositePlus software to predict the potential phosphorylation of these sites. We found that Y36 and Y51 could be phosphorylated (Fig. S1A). To find the kinases for these sites, we used GPS 5.0 software for the prediction and found that TrkA could be the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates PHF5A at Y36/Y51 (Fig. 1A) [40]. Phosphorylation assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) showed that TrkA phosphorylates PHF5A at the evolutionally conserved residue Y36 (Fig. 1B\u2013D). We mutated all five tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (F), which mimicked the dephosphorylated state of PHF5A, and clarified that Y36 was the major phosphorylation site of PHF5A mediated by TrkA (Fig. 1E). We further examined the Y36F and Y36E (hyperphosphorylated mimic), and verified that both Y36F and Y36E mutants abolished phosphorylation of PHF5A (Fig. 1F). To further investigate the role of PHF5A phosphorylation at Y36, we generated Y36 phosphorylation specific antibody (labeled as \u201cpY36\u201d in figures) to detect the phosphorylation of PHF5A at Y36. Dot blotting and immunoprecipitated PHF5A-Y36F or Y51F were performed to ensure the pY36 antibody specificity (Fig. S1B and Fig. 1G). Treatment of NGF, the ligand of TrkA, rapidly induced the phosphorylation of PHF5A-Y36 WT, not the Y36F and Y36E mutants (Fig. 1H and Fig. S1C).

Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed no interaction between TrkA and PHF5A (Fig. 1I and Fig. S1D). These results suggested that TrkA phosphorylates PHF5A at Y36 indirectly.\nTrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade phosphorylates PHF5A TrkA has been reported to transduce two major downstream signal pathways canonically: PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK. To determine the pathway that TrkA phosphorylates PHF5A, we inhibited the signaling pathway downstream of TrkA. We found that treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor, magnolin, blocked the phosphorylation\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:98\nof PHF5A (Fig. 2A). In contrast, MK2206, the inhibitor of AKT, had no effect on the phosphorylation level of PHF5A (Fig. S2A). The treatment of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) reduced the phosphorylation levels of both ERK1/2 and PHF5A induced by TrkA (Fig. 2B). Among the prediction of GPS 5.0 software, srcfamily kinase could also be the kinase that phosphorylates the PHF5A. ABL1 is a member of the src-family tyrosine kinase which can be translocated into the nucleus [41]. Treating cells with dasatinib, an inhibitor of ABL1, reduced the phosphorylation level of PHF5A mediated by TrkA (Fig. 2C). In vivo and in vitro phosphorylation assays showed that ABL1 phosphorylates PHF5A directly (Fig. 2D, E). ABL1-K290R (kinase-inactive mutant) or PHF5A-Y36E abolished the phosphorylation of PHF5A (Fig. 2E, F). Also, overexpression of ABL1 phosphorylated PHF5A which could be dephosphorylated by CIP (Fig. 2G). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction between ABL1 and PHF5A (Fig. 2H, I). Indeed, immunofluorescent staining showed that ABL1 translocated into the nucleus when co-expressed with TrkA, which promoted pY36-PHF5A exporting out of the nucleus (Fig. 2J). Treating cells with magnolin and taletrecitinib, the inhibitor of TrkA, can abolish the phosphorylation of both ABL1 and PHF5A, while MK2206 has no effect (Fig. 2K and Fig. S2C, D). These results demonstrated that TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade phosphorylated PHF5A (Fig. 2L).\nABL1 is translocated into the centrosome to phosphorylate PHF5A To investigate whether phosphorylated PHF5A could regulate the alternative splicing, we performed the RNA-seq in cells with PHF5A knocked down and rescued with PHF5A-WT or PHF5AY36E. The results showed that the genes that PHF5A-Y36E regulated were clustered mainly in proteolysis (Fig. S3A, B). And the alternative splicing was not the major event regulated by PHF5A-Y36E (Table S1). Therefore, we speculated that pY36-PHF5A may perform spliceosome-independent functions. To investigate the spliceosome-independent function of PHF5A, we first examined the location of pY36-PHF5A, the pY36-specific antibody was used for immunofluorescent staining. Surprisingly, the result showed that the majority of pY36PHF5A appeared as puncta outside the nucleus, and co-localized with \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. 3A). With high-resolution microscopy, we further found that pY36-PHF5A located in the plus-end of the centrosome during the interphase, then expanded in the whole centrosome during the metaphase (Fig. 3B, C). To confirm the centrosome localization of PHF5A, we purified the centrosome by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and found that PHF5A copurified with \u03b3-tubulin. Overexpression of TrkA, PHF5A centrosome localization levels was increased (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, Overexpression of TrkA, ABL1 was also copurified with \u03b3tubulin (Fig. 3D), suggesting that ABL1 was also translocated into the centrosome. In addition, we found that knockdown ABL1 abolished the pY36 phosphorylation in the centrosome (Fig. 3E). These data suggested that ABL1 was translocated into the centrosome to phosphorylate PHF5A (Fig. 3F). To investigate the pre-mRNA splicing process at the centrosome, we performed sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation to purify\nthe centrosome. The results showed that SF3B1, the core component of U2 snRNP, was not copurified with \u03b3-tubulin (Fig. S3C). Importantly, mRNA was also shown low abundance in centrosome (Fig. S3D). These data suggested that there was a low possibility to proceed pre-mRNA splicing at the centrosome and pY36-PHF5A is very likely to play spliceosome-independent function at the centrosome.\npY36-PHF5A downregulates CEP250 by promoting the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A To gain insight into the function of PHF5A at the centrosome, we identified the interaction partners of PHF5A using in vitro and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4A). We found that a fraction of 30 centrosomal proteins interacted with PHF5A, including CEP250, a well-characterized centrosomal linker (Fig. 4B, C) [42]. We confirmed the colocalization of PHF5A and CEP250, which were located in the proximal end of the centrosome and contributed to centrosome engagement (Fig. 4D). To investigate whether the centrosomal colocalization of PHF5A and CEP250 was interdependent, we performed siRNA assay that targeted either protein or used drugs to destabilize cytoskeletons. The results showed that only the depletion of CEP250 but not cytoskeleton destabilizing decreased the signal of both PHF5A and pY36-PHF5A in the centrosome (Fig. 4E and Fig. S4A, B). In contrast, the knockdown of PHF5A had little effect in abolishing the centrosomal signal of CEP250 (Fig. 4F). We investigated whether pY36-PHF5A was recruited and involved in the dissociation of CEP250 from the centrosome. We found an increasing signal of pY36-PHF5A during the S phase to the G2 phase accompanied by a decreasing signal of CEP250 (Fig. 4G). To investigate the correlation between CEP250 and pY36-PHF5A, we constructed a conditional expression system in the HeLa cells and synchronized them in the S phase and late G2 phase. The overexpression of PHF5A-Y36F rescued the decreasing signal of CEP250 at the late G2 phase (Fig. 4H). The processing of CEP250 is regulated by Nek2A-mediated phosphorylation [43]. We further investigated the role of pY36-PHF5A in affecting CEP250 processing. The co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that PHF5AY36E but not PHF5A-Y36F could promote the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A (Fig. 4I, J). The immunofluorescent staining assay showed that PHF5A-Y36E but not PHF5A-Y36F could downregulate the protein levels of CEP250 (Fig. 4K). All the above data demonstrated that pY36-PHF5A downregulates CEP250 during the S phase to the G2 phase by promoting the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A.\npY36-PHF5A promotes centrosome separation and microtubule remodeling We further investigated the role of PHF5A in regulating centrosome separation. The cells rescued by PHF5A-Y36E resulted in a significant increase in centrosome separation (Fig. 5A). After synchronizing to the late G2 phase and inactivating Eg5 with monastrol, cells rescued by PHF5A-Y36E showed longer intercentrosome distances, same as the depletion of CEP250 (Fig. 5B, C and Fig. S5A). In contrast, PHF5A-Y36F rescued cells showed shorter inter-centrosome distances, the same as the depletion of\nFig. 4 pY36-PHF5A downregulates CEP250 by promoting the interaction between CEP250 with Nek2A.

The above results showed that PHF5A-Y36E promotes centrosome separation (Fig. 5D). Given that the centrosome is the most important microtubule organization center which contributes to cell migration, we examined whether PHF5A-Y36E or PHF5A-Y36F could affect microtubule attachment. The immunofluorescent staining showed that cells rescued by PHF5A-Y36F and the cells depleted with Nek2A or treatment with dasatinib contained a loosened microtubule and F-actin (Fig. 5E, F and Fig. S5B). In contrast, the cells rescued by PHF5A-Y36E and the cells depleted with CEP250 both showed a dense microtubule (Fig. 5E and Fig. S5B). The wound-healing assay showed that the treatment of dasatinib inhibited cell migration (Fig. S5C). All these data demonstrated that pY36-PHF5A promotes centrosome separation and microtubule remodeling."

Because the TrkA is activated by NGF, we focused on the tumors from the nervous system. The database showed that ABL1 is overexpressed in large-scale medulloblastoma (Fig. 6A) (Oncomine [44, 45]). Meanwhile, TrkA\nis overexpressed in the Shh-subtype and Wnt-subtype of medulloblastoma (GSE85217) (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, in Shhsubtype medulloblastoma, the TrkA high expression patient group corresponded to a lower overall survival rate in comparison with the low expression patient group (GSE85217 [46]) (Fig. 6C). We examined several cancer cell lines for TrkA expression levels and found that Daoy cell line, a human Shh-type medulloblastoma cell line, had the highest expression levels of TrkA (Fig. 6D). We also observed the high pY36-PHF5A levels in the tumor tissues of the medulloblastoma mouse model (Fig. 6E). We also verified the activation of TrkA-ABL1 cascade and the hyperphosphorylation of PHF5A at Y36 in the Shh-type medulloblastoma mouse model (Fig. 6F).

Additionally, we observed the loosened microtubule arrangement in PHF5A-Y36F rescued cells (Fig. S6G) or treatment with low-dose of dasatinib (Fig. S6H). The migration assay showed that low-dose of dasatinib inhibited the\nCell Death and Disease (2023) 14:98\nmigration speed (Fig. 7B, C) and displacement (Fig. 7D) of Daoy cells, however, PHF5A-Y36E could rescue the inhibitory phenomenon of dasatinib (Fig. 7B\u2013D). The wound-healing assay showed that the treatment of dasatinib inhibited the cell migration (Fig. S6I), in contrast, PHF5A-Y36E also could recuse this inhibitory phenomenon of dasatinib (Fig. 7E). Indeed, the video showed that the treatment of both low-dose of dasatinib and taletrectinib could inhibit the migration of medulloblastoma cells with little effect on their proliferation (Supplemental Movies S1\u2013S4 and Fig. S6J). All these data demonstrated that pY36-PHF5A promotes medulloblastoma migration by regulating centrosome separation and microtubule remodeling. In mitotic cells, the centrosome plays a critical role in spindle formation to ensure the correct cell division. To investigate the function of pY36-PHF5A during mitosis, we used time-lapse microscopy to record the mitotic process of the cells that knockdown PHF5A without or with the rescue. The result showed that the cells that knockdown of PHF5A displayed triple polarity cell division and cytokinesis failure (Fig. 7F), while the rescue of PHF5A-WT or PHF5A-Y36E can reverse this phenotype (Fig. 7F). However, the cells rescued of PHF5A-Y36F still displayed cell cycle arrest (Fig. 7F). Also, the cells rescued by either PHF5A-Y36F or PHF5A-Y36E couldn\u2019t avoid the irreversible cell death induced by PHF5A knockdown in a long period of cell culture (Fig. S6K). To investigate if the cell cycle arrest in PHF5A-Y36F rescued cells induced cellular senescence, SA-\u03b2-Gal staining was performed in cells which overexpressed PHF5A mimics. The results showed that the cellular senescence was indeed induced by the treatment of high-dose of dasatinib or overexpression of PHF5A-Y36F (Fig. 7G, H). To determine whether PHF5A-pY36 affects cell proliferation, colony formation assay and cell number counting assay were performed in cells overexpressing PHF5A with or without the treatment of high-dose of dasatinib. The results showed that the treatment of high-dose of dasatinib inhibited the proliferation of control and PHF5A-Y36F rescued cells but the cells rescued by PHF5A-WT and PHF5A-Y36E can resume cell proliferation (Fig. 7I, J). All these data demonstrated that pY36-PHF5A promotes medulloblastoma proliferation and rescues cellular senescence induced by dasatinib by regulating the cell cycle process."

            "text": "It is well-established that the TrkA pathway functions in neurogenesis, cell differentiation, and proliferation. Also, TrkA, as well as ABL1, could be a pro-oncogene function in tumorigenesis [47, 48]. According to recent reports, with the stimulation of nerve growth factor, TrkA was activated and induced downstream phosphorylation cascade to promote cell proliferation [49]. In the canonical growth factor phosphorylation cascade, the activated Mst2 can phosphorylate and active Nek2A, which directly induces the centrosome separation [50]. In the present study, we provided evidence that ABL1 was recruited to the centrosome when the TrkA-ERK1/2-ABL1 cascade was activated. Activated ABL1 phosphorylated PHF5A at site Y36 in the centrosome. The hyperphosphorylated PHF5A-Y36 was observed in medulloblastoma with the activation of the TrkA-ABL1 cascade which subsequently promoted cell migration. The treatment of inhibitors of both TrkA and ABL1 could inhibit the migration of medulloblastoma cells. In contrast, the cells rescued by PHF5A-Y36E could abolish the migration inhibitory phenomenon induced by dasatinib. Our results demonstrated that phosphorylation of PHF5A by TrkAERK1/2-ABL1 cascade plays an important role in regulating centrosome function. PHF5A is well characterized as a component of spliceosome U2 snRNPs. During pre-mRNA splicing, PHF5A interacts with SF3B1 for branch point recognition. However, increasing evidence suggests that PHF5A also could play spliceosome-independent functions. It stabilizes the Paf1 transcriptional complex in\npluripotent embryonic stem cells' self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency [27]. It stabilizes the p400 histone chaperone complex and functions in DNA repair [16]. Our findings on PHF5A regulating centrosome function by affecting the interaction of CEP250 and Nek2A supported the notion that it plays a spliceosome-independent function. The other components of spliceosomes have been reported to regulate cellular events. PQBP1, a splicing regulator protein, interacts with Dynamin 2 to orchestrate neuronal ciliary morphogenesis in the brain [51]. Pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPF6, PRPF8, and PRPF31) mutated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and were identified as regulators during ciliogenesis [52]. In the current study, we identified a previously unrecognized centrosomal localization and function of PHF5A during centrosome separation. Our study further confirmed that the spliceosome components regulate functions in various cellular processes. During interphase, a newly duplicated pair of centrosomes are connected by a centrosome linker composed of CEP250, rootletin, CEP68 et al. At the onset of mitosis, the centrosome linker CEP250 is phosphorylated by the activated Nek2 and leads to its displacement, which initiates the centrosome separation. The precise timing of centrosome separation plays an important role in mitotic spindle formation and cell division, and correct segregation of chromosomes requires timely centrosome separation. Premature centrosome separation causes multipolar mitotic spindle formation and induces chromosome instability. Delay or unaccomplished centrosome separation will lead to multiple centrosomes or centrosome structure destruction which induces abnormal cell division and aneuploid. Importantly, the centrosome is the major microtubule organizing center in mammalian cells. The unstructured centrosome causes disassembling of microtubules which leads to the decrease of cellular substrate transportation, misplacing of organelles, and affecting cell migration. However, centrosome separation involves a sequence of events and regulation cascades that remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that pY36-PHF5A is located in the centrosome and mediated centrosome separation by promoting the interaction between CEP250 and Nek2A. These results increased our understanding of the regulation of centrosome separation. However, the regulation of CEP250 stability remains elusive, whether pY36-PHF5A participates in this regulation is worth further investigation. In summary, our study revealed that phosphorylation of PHF5AY36 in the centrosome promotes centrosome linker displacement. The unmatured centrosome separation leads to a remodeling of the microtubule, subsequently regulating cell migration. In medulloblastoma, the hyperphosphorylation of the TrkA-ABL1PHF5A cascade could regulate cancer proliferation and migration, which provides potential targets for cancer therapy."
