The weak interaction part proceeds through the charm quark decay process: c\u00f0s\u0304\u00de \u2192 \u00f0s\u00fe d\u0304\u00fe u\u00de\u00f0s\u0304\u00de, while the hadronization part takes place in two mechanisms, differing in how the quarks from the weak decay combine into \u03c0K with a quark-antiquark pair qq\u0304 with the vacuum quantum numbers. In addition to the contribution from the tree diagram of the K \u00fe \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0S, we have also considered the K K\u0304 final-state interactions within the chiral unitary approach to generate the intermediate state a0\u00f01710\u00de, then it decays into the final statesK0SK0S. We find that the recent experimental measurements on the K0SK 0 S and \u03c0\n\u00feK0S invariant mass distributions can be well reproduced, and the proposed mechanism can provide valuable information on the nature of scalar f0\u00f01710\u00de and its isovector partner a0\u00f01710\u00de. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.105.116010\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThough the scalar f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance with IG\u00f0JPC\u00de \u00bc 0\u00fe\u00f00\u00fe\u00fe\u00de is a well-established state quoted in the Review of Particle Physics (RPP) [1], it has attracted a lot of discussions and debates on its structure. The main decay channels of the f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance are KK\u0304 and \u03b7\u03b7, while the \u03c0\u03c0 decay branching ratio of the f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance is very small [1]. This indicates that f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance has a large ss\u0304 component in its wave function. This is indeed what was found in Ref. [2]. It has also been suggested as a scalar glueball candidate [3\u20135]. Furthermore, the scalar mesons f0\u00f01370\u00de, f0\u00f01500\u00de, and f0\u00f01710\u00de cannot be simultaneously accommodated in the quark model, thus they were widely investigated by different mixing schemes [6\u201312].\nOn the other hand, the f0\u00f01710\u00de was proposed to be a state dynamically generated from the vector meson-vector meson interactions [13\u201315], which remains valid even after the vector meson-pseudoscalar meson and pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions are included in the coupled channel approach [16\u201318]. Within this picture, the f0\u00f01710\u00de couples mostly to the K K\u0304 channel and most properties of f0\u00f01710\u00de can be well reproduced [18\u201327]. In fact, in Refs. [13,14], an isospin one partner a0\u00f01710\u00de of the f0\u00f01710\u00de state is also obtained, with its mass around 1780 MeV and negative G-parity. The a0\u00f01710\u00de also couples mostly to the K K\u0304 channel, but the \u03c1\u03c9 and \u03c1\u03d5 channels are also important. Very similar conclusions are also found in Ref. [28], where these pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar coupled channels were taken into account, while the obtained mass of a0\u00f01710\u00de of Ref. [28] is smaller than those predicted in Refs. [13,14]. The properties of the a0\u00f01710\u00de of Refs. [13,15,28] are collected in Table I, where the results of Ref. [28] are obtained with a cutoff qmax \u00bc 1000 MeV. Within the ranges of the model parameters of Ref. [14], the a0\u00f01710\u00de mass is predicted in the range of 1750\u20131790 MeV. In addition, one isovector scalar resonance with a mass of 1744 MeV is also predicted within the Regge trajectories [29]. *lidm@zzu.edu.cn \u2020wangen@zzu.edu.cn \u2021lisheng.geng@buaa.edu.cn \u00a7xiejujun@impcas.ac.cn Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

It is found that there is an enhancement in the K0SK 0 S invariant mass spectrum around 1.7 GeV, which was not seen in the BESIII earlier measurements ofD\u00fes \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe [31]. This indicates the existence of the isospin one partner of the f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance, i.e., a0\u00f01710\u00de. In addition, the a0\u00f01710\u00de state was also observed in the \u03c0\u03b7 invariant mass spectrum of the \u03b7c \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 decay by the BABAR Collaboration [32]. The Breit-Wigner mass and width of the a0\u00f01710\u00de state1 are determined as,\nMa0\u00f01710\u00de \u00bc 1723 11 2 MeV; \u00f01\u00de\n\u0393a0\u00f01710\u00de \u00bc 140 14 4 MeV; \u00f02\u00de\nby BESIII [30], and\nMa0\u00f01710\u00de \u00bc 1704 5 2 MeV; \u00f03\u00de\n\u0393a0\u00f01710\u00de \u00bc 110 15 11 MeV; \u00f04\u00de\nby BABAR [32]. Based on the new measurement of BESIII [30], Ref. [33] has investigated the process D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S, where D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK \u00feK \u2212, \u03c0\u00feK 0K\u0304 0 firstly happen, then undergo the K K\u0304 final-state interaction to give rise to the final states KK\u0304. Accordingly, the a0\u00f01710\u00de and f0\u00f01710\u00de resonances are dynamically generated from the K K\u0304 final-state interaction. The production of a0\u00f01710\u00de and f0\u00f01710\u00de states in the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK0S and D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212 reactions can be explained [33]. In this work, following Ref. [33], we will revisit the process D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S. In addition to the contributions of the a0\u00f01710\u00de and f0\u00f01710\u00de states from the intermediate processD\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK K\u0304 , we will also study the contribution of K , which could play a role in the intermediate process D\u00fes \u2192 K \u00feK\u03040 \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0K\u03040. We wish to go beyond the work\nof Ref. [33] and study the whole K0SK 0 S and \u03c0 \u00feK0S invariant mass spectra, where we will focus on the roles played by a0\u00f01710\u00de and K \u00fe to describe the line shapes of K0SK0S and \u03c0\u00feK0S, rather than just the f0\u00f01710\u00de and a0\u00f01710\u00de contributions extracted from the experimental data, which was well described in Ref. [33]. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the theoretical formalism of the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S decay, and in Sec. III, we show our numerical results and discussions, followed by a short summary in Sec. IV."

[33\u201336], a way for the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S to proceed is the following: (1) the charm quark in D\u00fes turns into a strange quark with a ud\u0304 pair by the weak decay shown in Fig. 1; (2) the sd\u0304 [Fig. 1(a)] or us\u0304 [Fig. 1(b)] pair, together with the q\u0304q\u00f0\u00bc u\u0304u\u00fe d\u0304d\u00fe s\u0304s\u00de pair with the vacuum quantum numbers created from vacuum, hadronizes into \u00f0\u03c0K \u00de0 or \u00f0\u03c0K\u0304 \u00de\u00fe, and the other us\u0304 and sd\u0304 will hadronize to K \u00fe and K\u0304 0, respectively;\n1It should be stressed that in Ref.

This seems to be a reasonable choice given the reasonable description of the invariant K0SK 0 S and \u03c0\n\u00feK0S mass distributions as shown below. After the production of the K K\u0304 pair, the final-state\ninteraction in S-wave between K and K\u0304 takes place, in which the a0\u00f01710\u00de is produced, and then it decays toK0SK0S in the final state.2 In Fig. 2, we show the rescattering diagram for the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK K\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0\u00fea0\u00f01710\u00de \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK0S decay.\n2Note that the parameters V1 and V2 are assumed to be independent of the final-state interactions.\nTHEORETICAL STUDY OF THE PROCESS D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S \u2026 PHYS.

The G\u0303K K\u0304 is the loop function for the K\nK\u0304 pair, which depends on MK0SK0S . Since the K\nand K\u0304 have large total decay widths, they should be taken into account.

We take \u03bc \u00bc 1000 MeV and a\u03bc \u00bc \u22121.726 as in Ref. [13]. It is worth mentioning that the only parameter dependent part of G\u0303 is a\u03bc \u00fe ln\u00f0m21=\u03bc2\u00de. Any change in \u03bc is reabsorbed by a change in a\u03bc through a\u03bc0 \u2212 a\u03bc \u00bc ln\u00f0\u03bc02=\u03bc2\u00de, so that the loop function G\u0303 is scale independent. It should be noted that the loop function G\u0303 can be also regularized with the cutoff method as in Refs. [17,18,28,42\u201344]. The so obtained real (solid curves) and imaginary\n(dashed curves) parts of the loop function GK K as a function of the K0SK 0 S invariant mass are shown in Fig. 3. The results considering the K width are obtained with the dimensional regularization method as in Ref.

REV. D 105, 116010 (2022)\n116010-4\nIn addition, the gKK\u0304 in Eq. (17) is the coupling constant of a0\u00f01710\u00de to the KK\u0304 channel, and it can be determined from the partial decay width of a0\u00f01710\u00de \u2192 KK\u0304, which is given by\n\u0393KK\u0304 \u00bc g2KK\u0304 8\u03c0 pK M2a0\u00f01710\u00de ; \u00f025\u00de\nwhere pK is the three momentum of the K or K\u0304 meson in the a0\u00f01710\u00de rest frame. With these \u0393KK\u0304 values of Refs. [13,15] and Ref. [28] shown in Table I, we obtain gKK\u0304 \u00bc 1966 MeV and 2797 MeV for Set I and Set II, respectively. Note that from the partial decay width, one can only obtain the absolute value of the coupling constant, but not the phase. In this work, we assume that gKK\u0304 is real and positive.\nB. The mechanism ofD +s \u2192 K\u03040K + \u2192 \u03c0 +K0SK 0 S reaction\nIn this section, we will present the formalism for the decay D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S via the intermediate meson K\n\u00fe. According to the RPP [1], the absolute branching fraction of the decay modeD\u00fes \u2192 K\u03040K \u00fe is \u00f05.4 1.2\u00de%, which is comparable to the absolute branching fraction of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03b7\u03c1\u00fe that is \u00f08.9 0.8\u00de%. As a result, the D\u00fes \u2192 K0SK \u00fe is\nimportant to produce \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S in the final state through K \u00fe \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0S in P-wave, as shown in Fig. 4. The decay amplitude for D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S from the process shown in Fig. 4 can be obtained as\nMb \u00bc gDsK\u0304K gK K\u03c0\n2\n1\nq2 \u2212m2K \u00fe \u00fe imK \u00fe\u0393K \u00fe\n\u00d7 \u00f0m2K0S \u2212m 2 \u03c0\u00fe\u00de 1 \u2212\nq2\nm2K \u00fe\n\u00fe 2p1 \u00b7 p3 m2\u03c0\u00fe \u2212m 2 K0S \u2212m2K \u00fe\nm2K \u00fe\n\u00fe 2p2 \u00b7 p3 m2\u03c0\u00fe \u2212m 2 K0S \u00fem2K \u00fe m2K \u00fe \u00fe \u00f0exchange term withp2 \u2194 p3\u00de; \u00f026\u00de\nwhere q2 \u00bc \u00f0p1 \u00fe p2\u00de2 \u00bc M2\u03c0K0S is the invariant mass squared of the \u03c0\u00feK0S system. The gDsK\u0304K and gK K\u03c0 denote the coupling constants of D\u00fes \u2192 K\u03040K \u00fe and K \u00fe \u2192 K0\u03c0\u00fe, respectively. With the masses of these particles given in Table II, the branching fraction of Br\u00f0D\u00fes \u2192 K\u03040K \u00fe\u00de \u00bc \u00f05.4 1.2\u00de% and the partial decay width K \u00fe \u2192 K0\u03c0\u00fe quoted in the RPP [1], we obtain gDsK\u0304K \u00bc \u00f01.05 0.12\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126 and gK K\u03c0 \u00bc 3.26. Again, we assume that gDsK\u0304K and gK K\u03c0 are real and positive [45]. The uncertainty of gDsK\u0304K originates from the uncertainty of the branching fraction Br\u00f0D\u00fes \u2192 K\u03040K \u00fe\u00de, while the uncertainty of gK K\u03c0 is ignored, since it is very small.\nC.

In Ref.

Finally, one can easily obtain d\u0393=dMK0SK0S and d\u0393=dM\u03c0K0S , by integrating Eq. (28) over each of the invariant mass variables with the limits of the Dalitz plot given in the RPP [1].

One can see that the K \u00fe energy region overlaps largely with the a0\u00f01710\u00de state in the K0SK0S channel.

To compare the theoretical invariant mass distributions with the experimental measurements, we introduce an extra global normalization factor C, which will be fitted to the experimental data. In Fig. 6, we show our theoretical results for the K0SK 0 S invariant mass distribution. The red-solid curve stands for the total contributions from the a0\u00f01710\u00de state and the vector K \u00fe meson,\nZHU, LI, WANG, GENG, and XIE PHYS. REV. D 105, 116010 (2022)\n116010-6\nwhile the blue-dashed and green-dot-dashed curves correspond to the contribution from only the a0\u00f01710\u00de and K \u00fe, respectively. The red-solid curve has been adjusted to the strength of the experimental data of BESIII [30] at its peak by taking C \u00bc 2.3 \u00d7 107 for both Set I and Set II. One can see that the model results obtained with the parameters of both Set I and Set II can reproduce the experimental data reasonably well, and the K plays an important role around the peak of the a0\u00f01710\u00de state. It is clearly seen that the shape of a0\u00f01710\u00de in Fig. 6(b) is wider than that in Fig. 6(a). One reason is that, as shown in Table I, the a0\u00f01710\u00de width of Set II is larger than the one of Set I. The other reason is that the loop function GK K\u0304 obtained with the cutoff regularization of Ref. [28] is smoother than the one of Ref. [13], which can be seen in Fig. 3. In Ref. [33], the vector-vector intermediate states were\nproduced at the first step with both the external and internal W-emission mechanisms, and then the final-state interaction of vector-vector produces f0\u00f01710\u00de and a0\u00f01710\u00de and then they decay into K0SK 0 S and K\n\u00feK\u2212. By adjusting the effective parameters between these production processes, the ratio of the branching fractions Br\u00f0D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK0S\u00de and Br\u00f0D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212\u00de from the f0\u00f01710\u00de and a0\u00f01710\u00de contribution can be reproduced [33]. Clearly, this work and Ref. [33] share the same mechanism for the final-state interactions. As a result, both can describe the main feature of the K0SK 0 S line shapes. In principle, both the external and internalW-emission mechanisms can play a role. However, a quantitative consideration of both mechanisms inevitably introduces additional free parameters for the weak interaction (more details can be found in Ref. [33]), which cannot yet be well determined. Hence, we will leave a simultaneous consideration of both mechanisms to a future study when more precise experimental data become available. It should be noted that the contribution of the f0\u00f01710\u00de state is not considered in our calculation, while the data on on the other hand contain the contributions of both states. This implies that the peaks of f0\u00f01710\u00de and a0\u00f01710\u00de overlap strongly. Otherwise, the sole contribution from a0\u00f01710\u00de cannot describe the experimental data. The f0\u00f01710\u00de and a0\u00f01710\u00de mixing can also be studied in the J=\u03c8 decays [20] when more experimental data are available, just as the a0\u00f0980\u00de and f0\u00f0980\u00de mixing [47\u201349] for the case of KK\u0304 molecules. In fact, the a0\u00f0980\u00de and f0\u00f0980\u00demixing was investigated in the decayD\u00fes \u2192 \u03b7\u03c00\u03c0\u00fe in Ref. [50] with the formalism built in a earlier work of Ref. [51], where the mixing of a0\u00f0980\u00de and f0\u00f0980\u00de resonances that breaks the isospin invariance due to the K\u00fe and K0 meson mass difference. In our model, the final K0SK 0 S pair is produced from the K K\u0304 interaction, and the loop functionGK K\u0304 is very small around the a0\u00f0980\u00de [f0\u00f0980\u00de] pole region (see Fig. 3) and the coupling of a0\u00f0980\u00de [f0\u00f0980\u00de] to the K K\u0304 channel\n[16] is also small compared with the one of a0\u00f01710\u00de to the K K\u0304 channel. Hence, there are no a0\u00f0980\u00de and f0\u00f0980\u00de signal in the K0SK 0 S mass spectrum of the D \u00fe s \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S decay. On the other hand, from Eq. (16), we find that the two phases in the a0\u00f01710\u00de and f0\u00f01710\u00de productions have an opposite sign. If the production of a0\u00f01710\u00de is constructive as shown in the new BESIII data [30], one can expect no contribution from the mechanism shown in Fig. 1 to produce the f0\u00f01710\u00de resonance in the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212 decay [31,36,52]. However, the f0\u00f01710\u00de could be produced via the external W emission mechanism, and its signal is expected in the process D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212. Next, we turn to the \u03c0\u00feK0S invariant mass distributions. In Fig. 7, we show the theoretical results for the invariant \u03c0\u00feK0S mass distributions of the D \u00fe s \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S decay. To compare with the experimental results, we have multiplied a factor of two to d\u0393=dM\u03c0K0S , since the experimental distribution of \u03c0\u00feK0S contains two entries of events, one for each K0S (see more details in Ref. [30]). The peak of the K \u00fe can be well described. The contribution from a0\u00f01710\u00de\nTHEORETICAL STUDY OF THE PROCESS D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 105, 116010 (2022)\n116010-7\nis very small to the peak, while its contribution to the threshold enhancement of the invariant \u03c0\u00feK0S mass distribution is significant. In addition, with the model parameters as obtained above for the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S decay, we study the process of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212, where the contributions from a0\u00f01710\u00de and K \u00f0892\u00de are taken into account by assuming that the mechanism of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212 is the same as the one of the process of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S. The numerical results for the K\u00feK\u2212 and \u03c0\u00feK\u2212 invariant mass distributions are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The experimental data are taken from Ref. [31]. If the a0\u00f01710\u00de plays the dominant role for the structure around M2K\u00feK\u2212 \u00bc 3 GeV2, the \u03c0\u00feK\u2212 invariant mass distribution in the low energy region cannot be well described because of the reflection effect of a0\u00f01710\u00de. In Fig. 8, the K \u00f0892\u00de contribution is\nscaled by a factor of 4.3, as shown by the pink-dash-dashed curve, and one can see that the K \u00f0892\u00de contribution is already enough to reasonably describe both the K\u00feK\u2212 and \u03c0\u00feK\u2212 invariant mass distributions in the energy region considered. which is also consistent with the Dalitz plot of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212, as shown in Fig. 6 of Ref. [31]. As discussed above, to describe well both D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S and D \u00fe s \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK\u00feK\u2212 reactions, one needs to consider other mechanisms, especially the contribution from f0\u00f01710\u00de. In this case, we will have more free parameters, which needs more constraints from both theoretical and experimental sides. In the present work, we focus on the role played by the a0\u00f01710\u00de in the D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S decay, and it is found that the new measurements of theD\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S reaction can be well reproduced, and the contribution of the K \u00f0892\u00de around the a0\u00f01710\u00de= f0\u00f01710\u00de peak is important. Finally, it is interesting to note that one can study the a\u00fe0 \u00f01710\u00de state in the K\u00feK0S channel of theD\u00fes \u2192 \u03c00K\u00feK0S decay by including the contribution of the final-state interaction of K \u00feK\u0304 0, which can be easily obtained by summing the second term of Eqs. (12) and (13). If the very small mass difference of charged and neutral K meson is neglected, it is expected that the branching fraction of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c00K\u00feK0S should be the same as the one of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0SK 0 S, and hence a charged a \u00fe 0 \u00f01710\u00de will be visible in the invariant K\u00feK0S mass spectrum. Indeed, the a\u00fe0 \u00f01710\u00de was recently observed in the decay of D\u00fes \u2192 \u03c00K\u00feK0S by the BESIII Collaboration [53]."

By considering the decay mechanism of internal W\u00fe emission, and hadronization of the sd\u0304 or us\u0304 with qq\u0304 with the vacuum quantum numbers, we obtain \u03c0\u00feK K\u0304 in the first step, then the transition of K K\u0304 \u2192 K0SK 0 S proceeds following final-state interactions of the K K\u0304 pair in the chiral unitary approach where the a0\u00f01710\u00de state is dynamically generated. In addition, the tree diagram of K \u00fe \u2192 \u03c0\u00feK0S is also taken into account. We have calculated the K0SK 0 S and \u03c0\n\u00feK0S invariant mass distributions, which are in good agreement with the experimental measurements of BESIII [30]. We have found that the K plays an important role in the a0\u00f01710\u00de peak region. Our study shows that the BESIII measurements support the K K\u0304 molecular nature of the a0\u00f01710\u00de and f0\u00f01710\u00de states and they overlap strongly in the data. For the reproduction of the a0\u00f01710\u00de peak, it is found that the contributions from both the tree diagram as shown in Fig. 4 and the K K\u0304 final-state interaction as shown in Fig. 2 are crucial. In addition, within the proposed mechanism, it is expected that the charged a\u00fe0 \u00f01710\u00de signal can show up in the K\u00feK0S invariant mass distribution of the\nZHU, LI, WANG, GENG, and XIE PHYS.
