In our local stellar neighbourhood, UCDs are plentiful (Chabrier 2003 ; Henry 2004 ) and predicted to host large numbers of planets (Cantrell, Henry & White 2013 ; Dressing & Charbonneau 2015 ; Ballard & Johnson 2016 ). Moreo v er, their small sizes and low temperatures make it easier to detect Earthsized, habitable-zone planets around these objects, and to probe those planets\u2019 atmospheres for biosignatures (Kaltenegger & Traub 2009 ; Seager, Deming & Valenti 2009 ; de Wit & Seager 2013 ), than for any other type of star.\nE-mail: cam217@cam.ac.uk (CAM); dq212@cam.ac.uk (DQ) \u2020 Juan Carlos Torres Fellow \u2021 51 Pegasi b Fellow\nDespite their promise, serious questions remain about the habitability of planets around red dwarfs. Several authors find it unlikely that these extremely cool, red stars would provide their planets with enough UV photons to initiate specific pre-biotic chemistry pathways (Rimmer et al. 2018 ) or enough visible light for photosynthesis to occur (Lehmer et al. 2018 ; Mullan & Bais 2018 ; Covone et al. 2021 ). UCDs are also especially active objects (West et al. 2015 ; Williams et al. 2015 ; Gizis et al. 2017 ; Paudel et al. 2018 ; G \u0308unther et al. 2020 ), producing energetic stellar flares and large-scale photometric variability, which results in treacherously variable conditions for their planets. The dynamic relationship between a planet and its host is a major factor in e v aluating ho w conduci ve a planet\u2019s environment is for life. For UCDs, ho we ver, this relationship is poorly understood.\nStellar flares may be a major determinant in whether a planet can initiate and sustain life. Flares are e xplosiv e ev ents caused by magnetic recombination in the upper atmosphere of a star (Benz &\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nM\nG a p r ( w w s ( 2 s e i R p a a s o t u\ns a t s s r ( M b a a T m fi\nl ( m r p e o f N a t\nh t ( i 2 o t R a S a T f\n( i b J\nd t a fl s 2 a h m s s\n( e s s p W l o a a S i C i m e ( o i o i\nt S g a d e fl p a a p\n2\nF t t b t D p fi\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\n \u0308udel 2010 ). This sudden eruption of magnetic energy usually occurs round activ e re gions, such as stellar spots, and causes bursts of articles and electromagnetic radiation. The spectra of this radiation esembles a blackbody with an ef fecti ve temperature of 9000 K Shibayama et al. 2013 ). Often, though not al w ays, powerful flares ill come accompanied with a coronal mass ejection (CME) event, here clouds of charged particles are directionally ejected from the tar. While flares can be destructive through atmospheric erosion Lammer et al. 2007 ), ozone depletion (Segura et al. 2010 ; Tilley et al. 019 ), and ev en e xtinction ev ents, the y can also be an essential power ource for life. It is possible that flares could provide the missing nergy at the bluer end of the spectrum needed for cool, red dwarfs to nitiate pre-biotic chemistry (Buccino, Lemarchand & Mauas 2007 ; anjan, Wordsworth & Sasselov 2017 ; Rimmer et al. 2018 ) and for hotosynthesis (Mullan & Bais 2018 ; Lingam & Loeb 2019a ). The dditional UV energy may also affect the evolution of a planet\u2019s tmospheric chemistry (Segura et al. 2010 ; Vida et al. 2017 ). In ummary, stellar flares hav e e xtreme and far-reaching consequences n the planets hosted by cool stars. Therefore, it is essential to study hese stars\u2019 flaring activity, and assess how applicable our current nderstanding of stellar activity is to the ultra-cool regime. Stellar activity and rotation are also closely connected. Magnetized tellar winds dictate the loss of angular momentum, which slows star\u2019s rotation o v er time. These stellar winds are dependent on he structure and properties of the magnetic field. As the rotation lows, this decreases the magnetic activity in a process known as pin-down (Skumanich 1972 ; Noyes et al. 1984 ). Due to this effect, apidly rotating stars flare much more frequently than slow rotators Skumanich 1986 ; Davenport et al. 2019 ; Mondrik et al. 2018 ;\nedina et al. 2020 ). Spots and faculae on the surface of stars and rown dwarfs cause periodic photometric variations as they come in nd out of view, on the same time-scale as the object\u2019s rotation. This llows the rotation period to be deduced directly from the photometry. herefore, the rotation of a star can provide valuable insights into the agnetic dynamo, the mechanism that generates a star\u2019s magnetic eld. This magnetic dynamo is poorly constrained for fully conv ectiv e ow-mass objects [with masses \u22640.35 M ; Chabrier & Baraffe 1997 )], where it is believed to differ significantly from the solar odel. Despite this predicted difference, recent work has shown that elationships between activity and rotation remain consistent from artially to fully conv ectiv e stars (Wright & Drake 2016 ; Newton t al. 2017 ; Wright et al. 2018 ). Spin do wn is, ho we ver, belie ved to ccur on slower time-scales for fully conv ectiv e stars, which accounts or the enhanced activity of mid-to-late M dwarfs (West et al. 2008 ; ewton et al. 2017 ; Jackman et al. 2021 ). Therefore, rotation, activity, nd the relationship between the two, are extremely useful probes of he underlying magnetic activity of UCDs.\nDue to the promising nature of M dwarfs as planetary hosts, there av e been sev eral detailed studies of their flaring activity within he past decade. Space telescopes, such as the Kepler/K2 missions Borucki et al. 2010 ; Howell et al. 2014 ), allowed the first insights nto the flares of bright M dwarfs (Davenport et al. 2014 ; Hawley et al. 014 ; Lurie et al. 2015 ; Silverberg et al. 2016 ) and of (small numbers f) UCDs (Gizis et al. 2013 , 2017 ; Paudel et al. 2018 ). Additionally, he recently launched Transiting Exoplanet Surv e y Satellite [TESS; icker et al. ( 2015 )] has facilitated studies of the flaring and rotating ctivity of cool stars (G \u0308unther et al. 2020 ; Medina et al. 2020 ; eli et al. 2021 ). Several ground-based photometric surveys, such s MEarth (Nutzman & Charbonneau 2008 ), the Next Generation ransit Surv e y (Wheatle y et al. 2018 ), the All-Sk y Automated Surv e y or Supernovae [ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. ( 2014 )], and Evryscope\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nLa w et al. 2015 ), hav e also carried out detailed flare studies that nclude M dwarfs (West et al. 2015 ; Howard et al. 2019 , 2020a , ; Mondrik et al. 2018 ; Mart \u0301\u0131nez et al. 2019 ; Schmidt et al. 2019 ; ackman et al. 2021 ).\nThe most frequent stellar flares are small, fast, and difficult to etect abo v e photometric scatter (Lacy, Moffett & Evans 1976 ). Due o the intrinsic faintness of UCDs in the visible, it is difficult to chieve the high photometric precisions necessary to constrain their aring acti vity. Ho we ver, it is possible to perform small, dedicated tudies of the much rarer, high-energy flares on UCDs (Gizis et al. 013 ; Paudel et al. 2018 ; Jackman et al. 2019 ). Therefore, to obtain sufficient sample size, previous large flare studies have focused on otter stars, up to mid-M dwarfs, where photometric precisions are uch higher. This has resulted in limited flare statistics for the coolest tars, for which we would require a large, high-cadence photometric urv e y optimized for UCDs.\nThe Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars SPECULOOS) project (Gillon 2018 ; Burdanov et al. 2018 ; Delrez t al. 2018 ; Jehin et al. 2018 ; Sebastian et al. 2021 ) aims to earch for transiting planets around the nearest (within 40 pc) UCD tars. SPECULOOS\u2019s moti v ation is to provide temperate, terrestrial lanets for detailed atmospheric characterization with the James ebb Space Telescope (Gardner et al. 2006 ) and future extremely ar ge telescopes. The SPECULOOS tar get catalogue of ultra-cool bjects is defined in Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ). SPECULOOS comprises network of 1-m class telescopes spread across the Northern nd Southern Hemispheres. The largest facility, the SPECULOOSouthern Observatory (SSO) in Cerro Paranal, Chile, consists of four dentical, robotic telescopes. These telescopes are named Io, Europa, allisto, and Ganymede. Each telescope operates independently and n a robotic mode, following plans written by SPECULOOS\u2019s autoatic scheduler, SPeculoos Observatory sChedule maKer (Sebastian t al. 2021 ). Additionally, the SPECULOOS-Northern Observatory Niraula et al. 2020 ) in Tenerife and the Search And characterIsatioN f Transiting EXoplanets (SAINT-EX) facility (Demory et al. 2020 ) n San Pedro M \u0301artir each have one 1-m telescope. The SSO began fficial scientific operations in 2019 January, followed by SAINT-EX n 2019 March and the SNO in 2019 June.\nIn this paper, we present a study of flares and rotation of SSO argets, observ ed o v er a span of almost 2 yr. Section 2 defines the SO data sample. Section 3 outlines how we generate and clean our lobal light curves, and how we combine an automated flare detection lgorithm with manual vetting to obtain our final flare sample. We escribe modelling the flares, calculating the flare energies, and stimating flare rates. This section also includes an assessment of the are sample\u2019s completeness. In Section 4 , we measure the rotation eriods in our sample. The results of our flare and rotation analyses re presented in Section 5 and discussed in Section 6 , which includes contextualization of the impact of flares on the potential for life on lanets around UCDs.\nSPECULOOS-SOUTH DATA SAMPLE\nor this study, we defined a data set spanning from 2018 June 1 o 2020 March 23, using observations from all four telescopes in he SSO. While this start date is before official scientific operations egan, it marks a point of stability in the commissioning phase. After his date, we performed no major maintenance to the observatory; ONUTS (McCormac et al. 2013 ), our auto-guiding software for recise pointing, was in use; and our operating strategy had been nalized [see Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ) for details]. The end of the\nd s\na i t 2 l o h T m t\na t w o w t t s p\nu m s \u2018 t t t o t i c b p r t s t e t m e d i\n2 w d n l S t o t 0 n d\nf\nFigure 1.

Ganymede, the final telescope nstalled in the SSO, started commissioning on 2018 September 30, herefore, between the four telescopes there is a cumulative total of 523 nights. Ho we ver, primarily due to weather loss, the SSO has ost 23\u201324 per cent of observing time, resulting in 1931 nights of bservation. Over the 1931 (combined) nights in this sample, we av e observ ed 176 unique photometric targets for at least one night. hese observations have typical exposure times of 20\u201360 s. The ajority, though not all, of this data sample are in the SPECULOOS arget list (86 per cent), as defined in Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ). This target list is divided into three main scientific programs, which re described in more detail in Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ). The objects in he SSO sample that are not in the target list are e xclusiv ely objects ith spectral types around or earlier than M6. It is likely that these bjects were part of the commissioning phase of the telescopes or ere remo v ed from the target list (due to reclassifying their spectral ype) before official scientific operations be gan. F or the objects in he target list, we extract radii, masses, ef fecti ve temperatures, and pectral type classifications from Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ). The stellar arameters for non-target-list objects are calculated in the same way. We remo v e an y objects that are not part of SPECULOOS\u2019s sual \u2018surv e y mode\u2019, such as targets observed for follow-up and onitoring of TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telecope (TRAPPIST)-1\u2019s transits. We note that, in SPECULOOS\u2019s surv e y mode\u2019, there are no simultaneous observations with multiple elescopes during the course of a night. During this time period, he operational temperature of the CCD was increased from \u221270 o \u221260 \u25e6C in 2018 October. The choice to raise the temperature f the CCD was due to the effect on the quantum efficiency of he detector, improving our sensitivity at the red limit, while the ncrease in dark current was found to be negligible. This temperature hange introduces an offset in the differential flux between the nights efore and after. While this offset has no consequence on our flare rogram, it affects long-term photometric trends. Therefore, when eco v ering rotation periods (in Section 4 ), we split the light curves hat straddle this temperature change and analyse the before and after ections independently. As this temperature change happens during he first few months of our data set, the majority of targets were ither observed entirely before or after it. Therefore, we only need o split a handful of our light curves. If a target has been observed by\nultiple telescopes, we do not combine their light curves, as each will xperience slightly different instrumental systematics. However, we o check that the rotation periods estimated in Section 4 are present n observations from all telescopes.\nIf we choose only the objects that have been observed more than 0 h with one telescope, this provides us instead with 154 targets (of hich 134, or \u223c87 per cent, are in the SPECULOOS target list). We efine the observation time as the sum of the span of all observation ights (start of night to end of night), where we exclude any gap onger than 15 min. These 154 objects define the SPECULOOSouth data sample. This sample co v ers a range of M dwarfs in spectral ype, extending from M4 into the early L dwarf regime (with masses f 0.07\u20130.2 M ), as shown in Fig. 1 . All objects in this sample will herefore be fully conv ectiv e, as the convection limit occurs around .35 M (Chabrier & Baraffe 1997 ). While M4 and M5 objects are ot considered UCDs, we include them in this sample to explore any ifferences between mid-M, late-M, and L dwarfs. In this sample, 80 per cent of the objects have been observed or less than 77 h (Fig. 2 ), and 50 per cent have been observed\nor less than 51 h. The short observation times in this sample will nevitably bias us towards detecting flares on targets with high flare ates in Section 3.3 and detecting the clearest rotation periods for fast otators in Section 4 .\nFrom Sebastian et al. ( 2021 ), we confirm that none of the target list bjects in the SSO data sample are known binaries. We could not find ny record in the literature of binarity for any of the 20 non-target list bjects, except from the M4 star, Gaia DR2 4450376396936878336 L \u0301epine & Bongiorno 2007 ). We flag this object, ho we ver, we find no vidence that this object behaves anomalously. This star is flaring, o we ver, it only flares twice, therefore, it is not included in our nalysis in Section 5.3 . We also do not find a rotation period for this bject, therefore it does not impact our results in Section 4 .\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\n3 F\n3\nT i e p i a a e s b t e e c o w P\np W e d c r\nc A t i a ( b t c l I b s\n3\n3\nI t n s\ni p t s a t D s R\nm s i c a\ne l 2 f s\nd b d r l t H f d o\n3\nA p n a p fl t i t S i p\n3\nF t ( d e t i d\na\n2\nw a t s e fl a o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nG E N E R AT I N G T H E SPECULOOS-SOUTH L ARE SAMPLE\n.1 Global light cur v es\no search for flares, we extract global light curves for all targets n the data sample, using the SSO Pipeline described in Murray t al. ( 2020 ). The SSO Pipeline performs automated differential hotometry by generating an \u2018artificial light curve\u2019 from a normalzed, weighted average of reference stars in the field. Only objects bo v e a brightness threshold (optimized for each field) are chosen s reference stars. Reference stars whose differential light curves xhibit photometric variability, or that are far in spatial distance onky from the target, are then weighted down in an iterative algorithm, ased on Broeg, Fern \u0301andez & Neuh \u030aauser ( 2005 ). It is worth noting hat the target star is remo v ed from this process. This means that, xcept for the distance weighting, this \u2018artificial light curve\u2019 is ntirely independent of the target star\u2019s light curve. This pipeline then orrects for the second-order effects of atmospheric water absorption n our differential photometry, using measurements of precipitable ater vapour from the ground-based Low Humidity and Temperature ROfiling radiometer instrument (Kerber et al. 2012 ). To generate global light curves, we perform our differential hotometry process on the entire time series of a target at once. e obtain differential light curves for 13 different aperture sizes. For ach aperture, the aperture size, comparison stars, and weightings o not change o v er the time span of observations. Using global light urves allows us to study their long-term photometric variability, but estricts our ability to optimize the photometry night by night.\nTo mitigate any systematics caused by changing atmospheric onditions, we carefully select the \u2018best\u2019 aperture for each target. s we only use one aperture size across all nights, it is important o take time at this step. Choosing the best aperture for a target nvolves a fine balance between an aperture that is large enough to v oid losing flux for nights with sub-optimal observing conditions e.g. a larger seeing), and an aperture that is small enough to prevent lending from nearby stars and extra white-noise contamination from he background. We select the aperture by eye that minimizes the orrelation between the light-curve flux and the seeing for the whole ight curve, and has no clear contamination from neighbouring stars. n addition, we implement a bad weather flag and thresholds for the ackground sky level, airmass, and seeing (above which the data are everely impacted), described in more detail below.\n.2 Cleaning the light cur v es\n.2.1 Removing \u2018bad\u2019 observations\nn the context of this paper, \u2018bad\u2019 observations are defined as those hat are significantly affected by the observing conditions of the ight, where distinguishing real stellar variability from ground-based ystematics would be extremely difficult.\nTo reduce the impact of these observations on our flare study, we mplement a bad weather flag, as defined in Murray et al. ( 2020 ). As reviously mentioned, the artificial light curve has no relation to the arget\u2019s light curve, therefore it is not impacted by flares on the target tar. This distinction means that we can use the artificial light curve s an independent reflection of the photometric conditions at that ime to identify where the quality of our light curves deteriorates. ata points in our light curves are flagged based on the RMS of the ection of the artificial light curve surrounding that data point (local MS). We define the length of the local section to be \u00b10.01 d. We\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nake the assumption here that there is a threshold for photometric catter in the artificial light curve (which therefore must be present n the highly weighted reference stars\u2019 light curves) above which we annot obtain good photometric precision. We define this threshold s a local RMS of 8 per cent, as defined in Murray et al. ( 2020 ).\nWe also include strict cuts on specific observation parameters. We xclude data points in our light curves where the sky background evel is greater than 4000 counts per pixel, the airmass is greater than .5, or the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread unction is greater than 2.6 arcsec (the SSO cameras have a pixel cale of 0.35 arcsec pixel \u22121 ).\nFrom 2019 May 1 to June 19, we experienced an issue with moving ust on the CCD window of Ganymede. While stationary dust can e easily corrected by flat images taken at the start of each night, if ust mo v es across the CCD window during the night, this leads to esiduals in the flat correction and structures in the final differential ight curves. These structures can mimic planetary transits, though he frames affected by dust are easy to identify from the raw images. o we ver, as we do not currently have a robust correction technique or moving dust, we removed all observations taken by Ganymede uring this period. This amounts to less than 2 per cent of total bservations, therefore the impact is marginal.\n.3 Flare detection\ns the SSO data sample is constrained to only 154 targets, it is ossible to identify flares manually. Therefore, we did not find it ecessary to implement a fully automated, complex flare-detection lgorithm. Instead, we decided to perform flare detection in two arts: a simple, automated flare-detection algorithm to extract all the are candidates, followed by a manual vetting process to confirm hem. Both stages of this flare detection process are demonstrated n Fig. 3 for target Gaia DR2 3200303384927512960. We note that his target is one of the most frequently flaring objects studied by eli et al. ( 2021 ). This object is a particularly challenging case due to ts rapid variability, where flare decays are difficult to separate from hotometric modulations.\n.3.1 Automatically searching for flares using light-curve gradients\nor the first part of our flare detection process, we chose to implement he automatic flare detection method set out in Lienhard et al. 2020 ), due to its simplicity, speed, and robustness. This method was eveloped on light curves from the TRAPPIST telescopes (Gillon t al. 2011 ; Jehin et al. 2011 ). Lienhard et al. ( 2020 ) capitalize on he changing gradients in the asymmetric structure of a flare, which nvolves a sharp increase to a peak followed by a slower exponential ecay (Moffett 1974 ). They evaluate the following two criteria:\n2 f j \u2212 f j\u22122 \u2212 f j+ 3 \u03c3j \u00d7 | f j \u2212 f j\u22122 | \u2212 | f j+ 1 \u2212 f j | \u03c3j > A thresh (1)\nnd\nf j \u2212 f j\u22122 \u2212 f j+ 3 > 0 , (2) here f j is the flux of the j th data point in the target\u2019s light curve,\nnd \u03c3 j is the RMS of the section of the light curve comprised of he nearest 60 data points. By only considering small neighbouring ections of the light curve in our RMS, and the flux for a few points ither side of the flare in our criteria, we are able to detect small ares on rapidly rotating or frequently flaring objects. Equation ( 1 ) ssesses the quality of the flare\u2019s shape. If we assume that the peak f the flare is at j then the first half of equation ( 1 ) confirms that\nFigure 3. Demonstration of the flare detection process on six nights of observations of an M7 object ( J = 10.7 mag), which exhibits both frequent flaring and short-period rotation. The four rows show different views of the same global light curve, zoomed in to individual nights on the second row, and only the fiv e manually v erified flares on the bottom two rows. The grey points are the unbinned data, while the black points are binned every 5 min. We do a simple least-squares fit of a sine wave with a period of 0.33 d, shown in light blue. It is clear from this fit that the rotation pattern is not perfectly sinusoidal; however, it provides a way to visualize the periodicity. The medium-blue data points are those initial flare regions flagged by the automatic flare detection algorithm described in Section 3.3.1 . The vertical, medium-blue lines are the flare candidates that have also been confirmed manually. During visual inspection of this light curv e, we remo v e two flares (one in the first plot on the second row and the first flare in the second plot on the second row), due to their small amplitude, which were found too difficult to detach from the photometric scatter. The best-fitting Davenport et al. ( 2014 ) models for each flare are shown in orange. The case where we have a poor fit to the template is shown in the bottom-left plot.\nw a t h a p\ns a t w r t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\ne are at a peak by ensuring the flux at j is greater than the flux few exposures before and after. The steeper the peak, or larger he flux difference between the peak and surrounding points, the igher its value. The second half of equation ( 1 ) hinges on the symmetry of the flare by requiring that the gradient before the eak, the fast rise, is larger than the gradient after the peak, the\nlow decay. For this second half of the equation, the greater the symmetry, the higher its v alue. By di viding by the local RMS, he aim is to remo v e flare structures caused by photometric scatter, hich is especially problematic for ground-based observing with apidly changing weather conditions. Equation ( 2 ) simply prevents he case where both halves of equation ( 1 ) are negative.\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\ns r r w o o t t f c a\nb h t t s I fi p v t\nfl m s s s o w v\n3\nT m s fl d l d m i b l d o e\n3\nO s ( t\na s d f\nfl d l W w i\nc fl\n3\nO d fl o o s e a a\ni t ( n f fl s fl fl i n t t\n3\nI s u\nd g \u2018 i i d a c m\ni fl b a fl o e t v\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nIt is possible to have significant time gaps within the light-curve ections of 60 points due to bad weather, ho we ver, this scenario is are. Including data points that are far apart in time would lower the eliability of the RMS in this section of the light curve, ho we ver, hen weather conditions are adverse enough to close the telescope, r seriously affect photometric precision, the RMS directly before r after is likely to be enhanced (due to poor observing conditions hat do not quite meet the threshold to be remo v ed). We note that he \u2018nearest 60 points\u2019 are only used for this flare detection method, ollowing Lienhard et al. ( 2020 ), whereas time boxes are used for alculating the running median and RMS in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 nd the rest of this work.\nIn their paper, Lienhard et al. ( 2020 ) determine A thresh = 12 y inspection of the smallest flares that they intended to remo v e; o we ver, this v alue is specific for the photometric precision and ypical exposure times of TRAPPIST light curves. We would expect he precisions obtained by TRAPPIST\u2019s 60-cm telescopes to differ ignificantly from those achieved by SPECULOOS\u2019s 1-m telescopes. nstead, for the SSO light curves, we derived a value of A thresh = 5. We nd a lo wer v alue for A thresh partly due to the increased photometric recision of the SSO and partly because we are choosing to manually erify the flare candidates that this algorithm detects, so we can afford o o v erdetect at this stage.\nBy choosing a flare detection method based on the shape of a are, and not outlier detection, this may limit the diversity of flare orphologies that we will detect. Since there have been few largecale studies done to date on UCD flares, such as those in our SSO ample, any difference in flare structure between earlier- and laterpectral-type objects is still unknown. Therefore, we decided to focus n the flares most resembling the standard flare shape (Moffett 1974 ), hile flagging more unusual light-curve behaviour in the manual etting stage (see Section 3.3.4 ).\n.3.2 Small versus large flares\no both maximize the detection of small flares and optimize the odelling of high-amplitude flares with slow reco v ery times, we\nplit the flare candidate sample into two categories: small and large ares. We classify large flare candidates as those with at least two ata points in the flare region more than seven times the running ocal standard deviation (standard deviation of the surrounding 80 ata points) abo v e the running local median (defined similarly as the edian of the surrounding 80 data points); otherwise, we classified t as a small flare candidate. The flare region starts at least two points efore the peak. We approximate the end of the flare region by using east-squares to fit the flare decline with a sum of a fast and a slowecaying exponential, as in Davenport et al. ( 2014 ). The decay time f the slower exponential decay is used to estimate the time of the nd of the flare region.\n.3.3 Validating and vetting flares\nnce a flare candidate is classified as large , then we use the urrounding 320 points (defined as global), instead of 80 points local), to calculate the running median and standard deviation for he next step of validation.\nIf the criteria in Section 3.3.2 is met, we then run several additional utomatic quality checks to separate flare candidates from flare-like ignals replicated by noise. By ensuring that there is more than one ata point in the flare region after the peak, we remove cosmic rays rom the flare candidates. Additionally, at least two points in the\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nare region must be more than two times the running local standard eviation abo v e the running local median of the light curv e. The ocal standard deviation and median are as defined in Section 3.3.2 .\nhen calculating the running local median and standard deviation, e mask all potential flare candidates in the light curve, and then nterpolate o v er the flare re gion. This automated algorithm provides us with a collection of flare andidates to follow up with manual vetting to then obtain our final are sample.\n.3.4 Manual vetting\nnce we have a collection of flare candidates from the method etailed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 , then the second part of our are detection process is to manually inspect these candidates and btain our final flare sample. We consider each flare candidate and nly confirm those which can be clearly identified as matching the tandard flare shape of a sharp flux increase followed by a slower, xponential flux decay (Moffett 1974 ; Davenport et al. 2014 ). We lso ensure that the flares cannot be attributed to rapid changes in tmospheric conditions.\nAs a final validation step, we check through the global light curves n the SSO sample. The only flare-like structures remaining are due o the following events: a flare occurs before the start of the night where we catch the tail end of the flare) or at the very end of a ight, the structures are low-amplitude and so cannot be distinguished rom noise, the structure diverges significantly from the standard are model, or they are correlated with systematics. Examples of tructures identified in the SSO data set that deviate from the standard are model, and are not clearly o v erlapping flares, are symmetric ares (with similar rise and decay times) and flares with a sudden ncrease and linear decline. During this manual vetting stage, we do ot add any of these potential missed flares into the flare sample, as hey do not meet the criteria to be clearly identified as a flare with he standard flare shape.\n.4 Modelling flares\nn order to model each flare, we coarsely flatten the light-curve urrounding that flare by dividing the light-curve by a median filtre, sing the local or global criteria as in Section 3.3.2 . We chose to model our flares by fitting the empirical flare template escribed in Davenport et al. ( 2014 ). In this paper, the authors enerate a median flare template from Kepler observations of 885 classical\u2019 flares on the M4 star GJ 1243. They found a sharp flux ncrease, modelled with a fourth-order polynomial, followed by an nitial fast exponential decay and subsequent slower exponential ecay. This model requires a time for the peak of the flare, a relative mplitude on the normalized light curve, and an FWHM flare , which orresponds to the flare\u2019s decay time. We demonstrate fitting this flare odel to flares of differing amplitudes and decay times in Fig. 3 . While this model works well for the more classically shaped flares, t struggles to represent complex flares that do not fit the standard are morphology (Davenport et al. 2014 ). This template is yet to e tested on a statistically large number of low-mass objects, such s UCDs, whose flare profiles may differ significantly. Complex ares include those with multiple peaks (Davenport et al. 2014 ), scillations (Anfinogentov et al. 2013 ), and those that are closely ntangled with variability. The o v erlapping of multiple flares is likely he culprit of more unusual light-curve structure. During this manual etting, we divide flare regions containing clear multiple peaks into\ns fl fi fl e i\n3\nT S e a l fi\nL\nL\nH t C B t A t S n c\nA\nT r b a\nL\nw e\nE\nU w\nE\nw t t\nE\nT u a t E C C\ni c\n( S t p p r s t t T p v r c i p f c b fl c a m t t t 2\n3\nA d c o r o\np t t fl\n3\nT e s U a i t l F e o l\n( a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\neparate flares and each of the new separated flares are added to the are list. We also flag (but do not remo v e) 27 flares that either do not t the standard flare model, or are not easily separable into multiple ares. This corresponds to 11 per cent of the total flare sample. An xample of a possible flare overlap is shown in the bottom-left plot n Fig. 3 .\n.5 Extracting flare energies\no measure the flare energies, we follow the technique described in hibayama et al. ( 2013 ). We model the flare as blackbody with an f fecti ve temperature, T flare , of 9000 \u00b1 500 K (Kowalski et al. 2013 ), nd we assume this temperature remains constant. We calculate the uminosity of each star and flare, as seen through the SSO\u2019s I + z\u2019 ltre, accounting for the o v erall system efficiency, as follows:\n\u2032 \u2217 = \u03c0R 2 \u2217 \u222b I+ z \u2032 R \u03bbB \u03bb( T eff ) d \u03bb (3)\n\u2032 flare = A flare ( t) \u222b I+ z \u2032 R \u03bbB \u03bb( T flare ) d \u03bb. (4)\nere, R \u03bb is the total SSO response function, which is the product of he transmission in the I + z \u2032 filter, quantum efficiency of the CCD, CD windo w, and reflecti vity of the mirror coatings. B \u03bb( T eff ) and \u03bb( T flare ) are the Planck functions e v aluated for the star\u2019s ef fecti ve emperature, T eff , and the flare temperature, respectively . Finally , flare ( t ) is the area of the flare. We do not include atmospheric ransmission in our response function due to its rapid variability. ince the relative flare amplitude can be found directly from the ormalized light curve, F ( t) = ( F /F mean )( t) = L \u2032 flare ( t) /L \u2032 \u2217, we an solve for A flare as follows:\nflare ( t) = F ( t) \u03c0R 2 \u2217 \u222b\nI+ z \u2032 R \u03bbB \u03bb( T eff ) d \u03bb\u222b I+ z \u2032 R \u03bbB \u03bb( T flare ) d \u03bb . (5)\no best estimate the flare amplitude, we use the local or global unning median for F mean , as defined at the end of Section 3.3.2 . The olometric flare luminosity, L flare , can then be calculated with the ssumption that the star radiates as a blackbody:\nflare = \u03c3SB T 4 flare A flare , (6) here \u03c3 SB is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant. The total bolometric\nnergy of a flare ( E ) is then the integral of L flare over the flare duration:\n= \u222b\nflare L flare d t . (7)\nsing equation ( 6 ), and assuming the flare temperature is constant, e can separate the time-dependent and independent components:\n= C \u222b\nflare A flare d t , (8)\nhere C = \u03c3SB T 4 flare . Using equation ( 5 ), we can further separate out he time-independent components that depend on the properties of he star and the flare, and the time-dependent integral:\n= C star ( T eff , R \u2217) C flare ( T flare ) \u222b\nflare F ( t) d t . (9)\nhe moti v ation for calculating the energy in this way is that it allows s to calculate these three components separately. When generating large pool of synthetic flares for injection-reco v ery tests, as in he following section, this drastically reduces the processing time. very object in our SSO data sample will have a constant value for star , which only needs to be calculated once per star. The value for flare also becomes constant with our assumptions. It is then only the\nntegral of the flare in the normalized light curve that remains to be alculated.\nFor this integral, we decided to use the normalized light curve corrected with the same local or global median filter described in ection 3.4 ) directly for the energy calculation, rather than using he flare model. In doing so, we note that the energies we calculate rovide a lower bound on the flare energy, as we may miss the flare\u2019s eak. It is also possible that if there was a large flare on a rapidly otating star, the underlying F mean may \u2018smooth out\u2019 photometric tructure, leading to the flare energy being o v erestimated. Ho we ver, o be classed a \u2018large\u2019 flare, a flare needs to be more than seven times he running global standard deviation (as defined in Section 3.3.2 ). his standard deviation would be highly inflated from the periodic hotometric modulations, and therefore this flare would have to be ery high energy for this to become an issue. As high energy flares are are (Gershberg 1972 ; Lacy et al. 1976 ), this scenario is not a major oncern. We chose not to use the flare model because the flares n our light curves are well-sampled, and when there is increased hotometric noise in the light curve, or more complex flare shapes rom o v erlapping flares (see Section 3.4 ), the fit to the flare model an be unreliable. Integrating the light curve directly means that ursts of flares occurring in short succession are counted as one are of increased energy. While this simplification may affect the alculation of our flare rates and energies, it should not significantly ffect our results as we only detect 27 unusually shaped flares that ay be a blend of multiple flares. We note that while flares are ypically approximated as blackbodies with temperatures from 9000 o 10 000 K, the flare temperature has been observed to vary outside his range, both between and within flare events (Howard et al. 020b ).\n.6 Calculating flare rates\ns flares are stochastic events, the gaps in observations due to the ay-night cycle or bad weather loss do not hinder our ability to alculate flaring rates, which are only dependent on the total time n-sky. It is likely that we underestimate flaring rates for the several easons flares are not found by our automatic detection algorithm, utlined in Section 3.3.4 . We calculate our flare rates as the number of flares detected er target divided by the observation time (summed across all elescopes). Almost all of our targets have been observed for less han 200 h, therefore we have a lower limit on individual stars\u2019 aring rates of \u223c0.12 d \u22121 .\n.7 Completeness of the flare sample\no e v aluate the completeness of our flare sample (the minimum nergy flares reco v erable by our flare detection process for different pectral types), we perform artificial flare injection-reco v ery tests. sing the global light curves from the 154 different targets with t least 20 h of observation, we mask all of the flares detected n Section 3.3 . We use the Davenport et al. ( 2014 ) flare model o generate 100 000 artificial flares with amplitudes drawn from a ognormal distribution between relative fluxes of 0.001 and 5, and WHM flare drawn from a uniform distribution between 30 s (typical xposure time for SPECULOOS) and 1 h. We calculate the energy f the resulting flares for each star, and divide into six energy bins in og 10 space from 10 28 to 10 34 erg.\nWe note that here we have followed the work of Davenport et al. 2014 ), Davenport ( 2016 ), G \u0308unther et al. ( 2020 ), among others, nd decided not to consider any relationship between amplitude\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\na a fl a f b c H r m t s r d m H i f fl\ns a s T o a o o r\nd r t fl t l fl fl b b s\nf T m o t l\no s t o < fl t b t t t c e\nFigure 4.

While we may be injecting \u2018unphysical\u2019 flares, this pproach allows us to explore a larger parameter space of different are morphologies. The amplitude\u2013duration relationship for flare has lso not been well-studied for the case of UCDs, where it may differ rom that seen in earlier M dwarfs. We do not see a clear relationship etween fitted amplitude and duration in our sample (and so cannot onfirm any other observed amplitude\u2013duration relationships, e.g. a wle y et al. 2014 ), though our estimates of amplitude and duration ely on a good fit to the Davenport template, which is significantly ore challenging with messy ground-based data. Our purpose with hese tests is to examine the decay time, amplitude, energy, and pectral type limits of our flare detection method, not to reproduce a ealistic flare frequency distribution (FFD). To model a realistic flare istribution, we would need to consider that low energy flares are ore common than high energy flares, as discussed in Section 5.3 . o we ver, then we would have significantly more low energy flares njected and reco v ered, making our sensitivity results more robust or small amplitudes/decay times, and less robust for high energy ares. For each energy bin, treated independently, we then randomly elect five flares and inject them into our differential light curves at random observed time, taking care to ensure the \u00b15 data points urrounding the time of the flare\u2019s peak are within 0.01 d (14.4 min). his prevents those five flares from occurring too close to the start r end of night or during gaps in our observations, which we would l w ays miss. We allow flares to o v erlap to reflect the scenario we see ften in real light curves, ho we ver as there are only ever a maximum f five flares in a light curve at once, the impact on our reco v ery esults is limited.\nWe then run the automatic part of our flare detection method, escribed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.3 , on all injected light curves and ecord the reco v ered flares. We consider a flare to be reco v ered if he reco v ered time for its peak flux is within 1 FWHM flare (of that are) of the injection time. We allow for a more flexible recovery ime because of the decision to allow flares to o v erlap, which can ead to more complex structures with multiple peaks. If two or more ares o v erlap within 1 FWHM flare , the y may be detected as only one are. We assume if they occur further apart in time then they should e easily separable. This process is then repeated for each energy in five times, making sure to use different flares from our artificial ample in each iteration.\nThe manual vetting step of our flare detection technique was not easible for checking the approximately 23 000 flares we injected. his may introduce a bias into our results. It is more likely during anual vetting that we would conflate low-amplitude flares or flares n high photometric scatter targets with noise, therefore by removing his stage, we have potentially inflated our recovery rates for the owest energy flares, or for the faintest target stars.\nFig. 4 shows the results of the injection-reco v ery tests, carried ut for approximately 23 000 artificial flares. We are able to detect a ignificant proportion of flares with amplitudes abo v e 1 per cent. Due o the short exposure times of SPECULOOS, we have the advantage f being very sensitive to flares with a short duration (with FWHM flare 5 min). Ho we ver, we are more limited in detecting longer duration ares (with FWHM flare \u2265 60 min) due to the day-night cycle, with ypical uninterrupted observation windows of 4\u20138 h. There will also e some stars which have nights of observation less than 4 h, due o weather, or limited visibility, and these will be the most difficult argets on which to detect slowly decaying flares. Ho we ver, we note hat during the manual vetting (Section 3.3.4 ), we inspect the light urves with flares removed and we do not find any undetected high nergy flares remaining in our sample. We also assess our limitations\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nith the photometric RMS of our light curves. When the RMS of global light curve exceeds \u223c0.7 per cent (for 5-min binning), we egin to see a drop in detection efficiency, resulting in an increase in he minimum detectable amplitude. Only three targets in our data set xceed this RMS.\nFor a given flare amplitude and FWHM flare , the flare energy will ary depending on the ef fecti ve temperature and radius of the star equation 9 ). The reco v ery fraction for different flare energies across ll stars is shown in Fig. 5 . However, the minimum detectable nergy of reco v ered flares varies with spectral type, as shown in ig. 6 , which facilitates the detection of lower energy flares on our oolest dwarfs. For low-energy flares, we have two competing biases. he light curves for the later, and fainter, M and L dwarfs have igher photometric scatter, which makes it difficult to detect smallmplitude (and therefore lower energy) flares. However, as flares ave a strong white light component (Namekata et al. 2017 ), there s an increased contrast between flares and the stellar spectra of red warfs, which should make lower energy flares easier to identify in ur coolest stars (Allred, Kowalski & Carlsson 2015 ; Schmidt et al. 019 ). SPECULOOS is also optimized to observe ultra-cool objects, nd due to this specificity, we only see a very minimal increase in MS with later spectral types. The results from our artificial flare injection-reco v ery tests allow s to calculate the reco v ery fraction of our flare detection method,\nFigure 6. Fraction of injected flares reco v ered as a function of flare energy and the object\u2019s spectral type. We find that as we mo v e to cooler stars we are able to detect lower energy flares. The upper and lower flare energy limits, determined by the amplitude and FWHM flare limits of the artificial flare sample and the radius and T eff of each star, are shown in orange. We are only impacted by the sample limits for spectral types earlier than M5 and later than L0.\nR a d t t e r o (\n4\nW w t a e w f s i\ns c e o w h i l i o w a\ne\na t s q\np\nm\no\nt\na\nn\nI w a e f d i t i p e c w i l i t m p\n5\nT a\n5\nF W T 3 d S s M ( T i b a b t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\n( E ), which reflects the low reco v ery rates of low energy flares. The verage R ( E ) for all stars is shown in Fig. 5 , as well as its spectral ependence in Fig. 6 . As our sample is already small, we are unable o reduce detection-sensitivity effects by simply limiting our sample o flares with energies abo v e a minimum reco v erable energy (Paudel t al. 2018 ), or energies where a sufficient fraction of flares are eco v ered (Dav enport 2016 ). Instead, we decided to calculate flare ccurrence rates in Section 5.4 using the method in Jackman et al. 2021 ), which models the decline in sensitivity for low energy flares. IDENTIFYING ROTAT I O N P E R I O D S ith the previously identified flares and bad observations masked, e search for rotation periods in the 154 low-mass objects with more han 20 h of observation. We apply the Lomb\u2013Scargle periodogram nalysis (Lomb 1976 ; Scargle 1982 ) to our global light curves, binned very 20 min. The SSO light curves are not uniformly sampled, as e have gaps in our data, not only from the day/night cycle, but also rom bad weather, masked flares, and changes to our observation trategy. Therefore, careful treatment of the resulting periodograms s essential to remo v e aliases.\nWe searched for periods between the Nyquist limit (twice the bin ize) and the entire observation window. While we cannot be fully onfident in periods greater than half their observ ation windo w, by xpanding the period range we search, we can estimate a lower bound n long-period rotation. We then remo v e all peaks in the periodogram ith a false alarm probability below 3 \u03c3 (0.0027). Any target which as at least one significant Lomb\u2013Scargle peak undergoes visual nspection of their periodogram and the corresponding phase-folded ight curves for all possible rotation periods (all significant peaks n the periodogram). In addition, by comparing with periodograms f the time stamps, airmass, and FWHM, we can eliminate signals hich arise from the non-uniform sampling or ground-based systemtics. We decided to apply a similar classification system as Newton t al. ( 2016 ) to our rotating objects. Classifying our rotators helps\nccount for the difficulties in observing from the ground, both hrough atmospheric systematics, and through irregular, non-uniform ampling. When examining each light curve, we ask ourselves several uestions:\n(i) Is the period clearly visible in the phase-folded light curve? (ii) Was the object observed for long enough to span multiple eriods? (iii) Is the frequency an alias of the \u2018day signal\u2019, seen as integer ultiples in frequency space (periods of 1, 0.5, 0.33 d, etc.)? (iv) Is there a correlation with systematics (as seen in the airmass r FWHM periodograms)? (v) Can the period be seen by eye in the un-phased light curve? (vi) If we observed this object with more than one telescope, does his period fit them all? (vii) Can we easily disentangle the \u2018real\u2019 period from its one day liases? (viii) Is the amplitude of the periodic signal abo v e the level of oise in the light curve?\nIf a rotator passes all the abo v e criteria, then we class it as \u2018A\u2019. f it fails any of the above, but the rotation still seems likely, then e class it as a \u2018B\u2019 grade rotator. Most commonly, the \u2018B\u2019 rotators re convincing, but we do not observe multiple cycles, or we cannot asily choose between the period and its 1-d aliases. Any light curves or which we see some periodic structure, but we cannot easily etermine a period, we class as \u2018U\u2019. This can result from broad peaks n the Lomb\u2013Scargle periodogram, or multiple possible periods due o lack of observations, or a very low amplitude periodic signal that s comparable to the noise level. Because of these ambiguities in the eriod measurements, we do not attempt to place errors on our period stimates. If we do not detect any periodic signal or we cannot remo v e orrelations with systematics (such as for very crowded fields), then e class the object as \u2018N\u2019. Finally, in addition to the classes defined n Newton et al. ( 2016 ), we add an extra \u2018L\u2019 grade. This is for the ight curves where we see clear long-period rotation, but the period s similar or longer than the time window observ ed. F or these objects he best we can do is to estimate the lowest possible period we\neasure, and acknowledge that there are large uncertainties on these eriod values.\nRESULTS\nhe SSO data sample, along with the results of the flare and rotation nalyses, are presented as supplementary material.\n.1 SPECULOOS-South flare sample\nrom the SSO data set described in Section 2 , we identify 234 flares. e find that of our 154 unique targets, 78 are flaring (50 per cent). hese flaring stars span the spectral type range from M4 ( T eff = 160 K) to L0 ( T eff = 2313 K). Fig. 7 shows the spectral type istribution and proportions of the flaring objects identified in the SO sample. From this figure, we see the proportion of flaring stars tays consistently abo v e 60 per cent for objects of spectral type M5\u2013\n7. We see that the rate of flaring stars begins to decline around M8 \u223c30 per cent), with no detected flares for any object beyond L0. he coolest flaring star we detect is a 2313 K, M9.6V object (which s rounded to L0 in Fig. 7 ). Ho we ver, for the L dwarfs, we are limited y the small sample size, and therefore cannot make any conclusions bout whether the fraction of flaring objects continues to decrease eyond late M dw arfs. Lik ewise, we do not have any objects earlier han M4; ho we v er, these earlier M dwarfs hav e been well-studied by\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\nFigure 7.

The abiogenesis zones (Rimmer et al. 2018 ) are also shown for each star as the regions shaded in green (similarly to G \u0308unther et al. 2020 ), and the photosynthesis thresholds (Lingam & Loeb 2019a ) are shown in orange.\ns m b t l\n5\nF T 1\nd\nw \u03b1\nw l C 1 e t\na m s h t fl p a t s o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nESS , Kepler , and MEarth . Despite our small sample of M4 dwarfs, e see an apparent reduction in activity for stars earlier than M5 hat agrees with the previous results [ \u223c30 per cent for M4 with ESS, G \u0308unther et al. ( 2020 ), 25 per cent for M5 with ASAS-SN, art \u0301\u0131nez et al. ( 2019 )]. Several authors find a steep rise in flaring ractions around spectral type M4 (West et al. 2004 ; Yang et al. 017 ; Mart \u0301\u0131nez et al. 2019 ; G \u0308unther et al. 2020 ). Specifically, West t al. ( 2004 ) analysed the H \u03b1 emission of cool stars (which roughly orrelates with flaring activity, Yang et al. 2017 ; Mart \u0301\u0131nez et al. 2019 ) nd determined that the fraction of active stars rose monotonically rom spectral type M0 to M8, peaked at M8 ( \u223c80 per cent active) nd then declined to L4. Our results show an increase from M4 to a road peak from M5\u2013M7, followed by a decrease from M8 to L2. We probe the parameter space of high-flare-rate stars with low-toid energy flares. Due to the relatively short baselines of SPECUOOS observations, if a target does not flare frequently, then it is nlikely we would identify it as flaring. This also means we are less ikely to detect the rarer, high-energy flares (Gershberg 1972 ; Lacy t al. 1976 ). In conjunction with the difficulties arising from the dayight cycle (typical night observations are 4\u20138 h), which complicates ur detection of very slowly decaying flares (see Fig. 4 ), it is unlikely hat superflares with energies > 10 33 erg (Shibayama et al. 2013 ) will e detected by our surv e y. From studying the completeness of our are sample, we also conclude it is unlikely that we will detect any ares below 10 29.5 erg for any spectral type.\n.2 Flare energies\nn this flare sample, we reco v er flares ranging in energy from 10 29.2 o 10 32.7 erg, with a median of 10 30.6 erg. We do not detect any uperflares, with energies between 10 33 and 10 38 erg (Shibayama t al. 2013 ).\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nFrom our flare injection-reco v ery analysis, we see that we have a pectral dependence in the flares we can retrieve. This dependence eans that we will struggle to reco v er flares on the earliest M dwarfs elow an energy of \u223c10 31 erg. As we mo v e towards later spectral ype objects, we are able to reco v er significantly higher fractions of ower energy flares, as shown in Fig. 6 .\n.3 Flar e fr equency distribution\nFDs explore how often a star will flare with at least a certain energy. he FFD assumes that the following power law applies (Gershberg 972 ; Lacy et al. 1976 ; Hawley et al. 2014 )):"

This can also be represented as:\nlog ( \u03bd) = C + \u03b2 log ( E) , (11) here \u03bd is the cumulative frequency of flares of energies \u2265E , C = og ( k 1 \u2212\u03b1 ) and \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b1. We linearly fit for the two coefficients, and \u03b2, using a least-squares optimization.

There are 31 objects in the SSO flaring ample (of 78 objects) that have at least three flares (the 31 objects ave between 3 and 19 flares, with an average of 5 flares). We bin he energies per 0.1 erg and calculate the cumulativ e frequenc y of ares greater than that energy. In Fig. 8 , we present the best-fitting ower laws from equation ( 11 ).

We note that these results are not corrected for the detection fficiency as in Section 5.4 due to the complexity of applying it to the umulative flare rates for low numbers of flares. Instead, we correct or the reco v ery rate in the next section, where we combine flares rom multiple stars to yield a much larger data set.\nBy extrapolating the relationship between the flare energy and umulativ e frequenc y for each star, we can predict the amount f energy that flares would deliver to the planets orbiting those tars. Ho we v er, e xtrapolating the power\u2013la w relationship from our arameter space into the high-energy-flare regime is dangerously nreliable, as it is common to see breaks in these power\u2013law elationships (Silverberg et al. 2016 ; Paudel et al. 2018 ). If we instead reat these linear fits as upper limits, then we can give estimates for he maximum frequency of high-energy flares. We note that the ower laws also vary with the energy binning and ranges chosen for tting. We see a tentative trend that as the stars get cooler, the flares we etect become less energetic and less frequent. Ho we ver, we see a arge diversity of FFD profiles even within the same spectral type. his could be due to variation in stellar age or metallicity. Since we re biased towards detecting lower energy flares for cooler stars, it s possible we more significantly underestimate the rates of lower nergy flares for our earlier M stars. This effect may result in steeper ower-law slopes, further separating the mid-M dwarfs from the lateand L dwarfs. Ho we v er, we only hav e one M4, M9, and L0 object ith at least three flares, and within the larger sample of M5\u2013M7 stars, e see little distinction. The decline in flare rates for cooler spectral ypes could be partially explained by our decreased sensitivity for arly-M stars. If only the infrequent, high energy flares are within each, we only pick up the objects that flare more often. Conversely, ince we are more sensitive to detecting lower energy flares on lateand L dwarfs, we are able to identify stars with lower flaring requencies. This effect explains the lack of low frequency flaring tars of early spectral types, but not the lack of high frequency flaring tars of later spectral types. As we have a small sample of flaring ltra-cool stars (see Fig. 7 ), we cannot confirm whether they, as a hole, flare less frequently. Paudel et al. ( 2018 ) similarly find that the are rates for low-energy flares decrease as they move towards later pectral types, with L0 and L1 dwarfs having the lowest flaring rates. ritically, ho we v er, the y find shallower slopes for cool stars [also n agreement with Gizis et al. ( 2013 ) and Mullan & Bais ( 2018 )], mplying that they have higher occurrence rates for the high-energy ares that are inaccessible to us. High frequency of these flares could e sufficient for a star to enter the abiogenesis zone. Ho we ver, we re unable to confirm this trend, due to our small parameter space nd the large uncertainties on our individual power-law slopes.\nIf we take a more conserv ati ve threshold of at least five flares o fit the power law, then we extract FFDs for only M5-M7 tars (for which we have a much larger flare sample). For this ub-sample, we find values for \u03b1 in the range 1.2\u20132, roughly in greement with Paudel et al. ( 2018 ), who measure 1.3\u20132 with their ample of 10 UCDs (for a smaller sample, but a similar spectral ype range). Paudel et al. ( 2018 ) discuss various reasons for the ariations in FFD slopes that are not dependent on age or spectral ype, such as rotation, stellar spot co v erage, and magnetic field opology.\n.3.1 Converting bolometric flare energies to U-band\ne calculate the energy in the U band, E U , by integrating the flux ensity in the U -band spectral response function, as in G \u0308unther et al.\n2020 ). Similarly to Section 3.5 , we calculate:\nU = \u222b\nflare A flare d t \u222b U R \u03bbB \u03bb( T flare ) d \u03bb. (12)\nherefore,\nU = E 1 \u03c3SB T 4 flare \u222b U R \u03bbB \u03bb( T flare ) d \u03bb, (13)\nhere R \u03bb is now the Johnson U -band response function. The ormalization of the response function is of greater importance here han when calculating the bolometric energies, as it does not cancel ut. From this, we estimate that 7.6 per cent of the flare\u2019s bolometric nergy falls in the U band.\n.3.2 Prebiotic chemistry\nere, we consider the laboratory work of Rimmer et al. ( 2018 ) in efining \u2018abiogenesis zones\u2019 around each of our potential planet osts, outside of which it is unlikely a planet would receive enough nergy for the following pre-biotic photochemistry scenario to occur. pecifically, the pathway considered in this work is the synthesis of ibonucteotides, as a precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA; Patel et al. 015 ; Sutherland 2017 ; Xu et al. 2018 ). By considering stellar flares s a mechanism for providing this UV energy, we can calculate the biogenesis zones around the stars in our sample from their FFDs. hether or not this chemistry is possible on a planet does not tell s if life has originated there, but instead, whether this mechanism an allow that planet to generate this first building block for RNA. onversely, if a planet does not receive the necessary energy for this eaction, it does not rule out alternate pre-biotic pathways for the rigins of life. G \u0308unther et al. ( 2020 ) determine the necessary flare frequency to ower pre-biotic chemistry for a planet receiving the same amount f flux from its host as the Earth, by adapting the abiogenesis zone quations from Rimmer et al. ( 2018 ) as follows:\n\u2265 25 . 5 day \u22121 ( 10 34 erg\nE U\n)( R \u2217 R )2 ( T \u2217 T )4 . (14)\nrom Section 5.3 , we calculate the flare energies in the U -band from ach flare\u2019s bolometric energy, using E U = 0.076 E .\nIf we extrapolate the FFD power laws to E = 10 34 ergs, we ave only one star that provides the necessary UV flux to reach he abiogenesis zone (see Fig. 8 ). This star is an M6 object. If we xtrapolate the FFD power laws instead to E = 10 36 ergs, then we ave 13 objects that reach the abiogenesis zone (with spectral types onsisting of 1 M4, 1M8, 8 M6, and 3 M7). Ho we ver, as our sample s confined to probing the low energy flare regime, we have to be areful to not o v er-e xtrapolate to high energies. Therefore, we do not xtend the power-law predictions further than E = 10 34 ergs. Almost ll the FFDs will eventually reach the abiogenesis zone, but at very igh energy the uncertainties in our power-law fit would be too large o draw any conclusions.\n.3.3 Photosynthesis\ningam & Loeb ( 2019a ) define a threshold for sustaining a biosphere n an Earth-like planet using flare-driven photosynthesis. By conidering \u2018photosynthetically active radiation\u2019 in the region of 400\u2013 50 nm, they find a similar functional form to equation ( 14 ) for the inimum flare rates necessary to receive the same photon flux on a\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\nTable 1.

(15) his threshold is a significantly greater inhibitor than that for preiotic chemistry. We plot this threshold for each star with our FFDs n Fig. 8 . None of our stars exceed this threshold when extrapolating o E = 10 34 erg. Because the condition for oxygenic photosynthesis s more strict than equation ( 14 ), if this object satisfies equation ( 15 ), t must also meet the requirements for the abiogenesis zone. .4 Applying our sensitivity to the flare sample o compare the average flare occurrence rates for different spectral ypes, we must account for the incompleteness of our sample. Due to he difficulty of detecting small amplitude flares abo v e photometric catter, we likely underestimate the frequency of low energy flares. his is often seen as a non-linear \u2018tail-off\u2019 from the expected power aw in log-log space (equation 11 ). Jackman et al. ( 2021 ) derive the following equation (equi v alent to heir equation 3) for the number of flares, N , with energies, E , greater han E flare : ( E \u2265 E flare ) = k \u03b1 \u2212 1 ( R ( E flare ) E \u2212\u03b1+ 1 flare + \u222b E max E flare R \u2032 ( E ) E \u2212\u03b1+ 1 d E ) , (16) here k and \u03b1 are the same constants in equation ( 10 ), R ( E ) is the flare eco v ery fraction, R \u2032 ( E ) is the differentiated flare reco v ery fraction, nd E max is the energy at which the reco v ery fraction saturates. F or igh energy flares, where R = 1, equation ( 16 ) reduces to the power aw in equation ( 10 ), whereas for low energy flares, where R = 0, t will reduce to the constant value of the integral (equi v alent to the tail-of f\u2019 ef fect).\nDue to the small population of flares on the earliest and latest tars in our sample, we build up flare numbers by combining spectral ypes into the following five bins: M4\u20135, M6, M7, M8, and M9\u2013 0. We calculate every star\u2019s unique recovery fraction, R ( E ), based n the results of the injection-reco v ery tests. We bin flare energies nto 12 logarithmically spaced bins from 10 28 to 10 34 ergs. For every tar, we find a value for the reco v ery fraction in each energy bin by alculating the fraction of flares with energies in that bin that were eco v ered. We smooth the reco v ery fraction using a Wiener filter of hree bins. We average the recovery fractions within each spectral ype bin to get the reco v ery fraction of an \u2018average\u2019 star.\nWe then extract the observed flare occurrence rates from our flare ample. First, we isolate only the stars in each spectral type bin. We\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nnclude all flaring and non-flaring stars in the SSO sample to a v oid v erestimating our flaring rates. For every energy bin, E , we sum the otal number of flares with energies \u2265E . Then we divide the total umber of flares by the sum of the stars\u2019 total observation times to roduce flaring rates. In doing so, we make the assumption that 10 tars observed for 10 h is equi v alent to 1 star observed for 100 h.\nWe fit equation ( 16 ) to our observed flare occurrence rates and nergies using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter ptimization procedure. To implement MCMC, we use the EMCEE ython package (F oreman-Macke y et al. 2013 ). We used 32 w alk ers or 10 000 steps and the last 2000 steps to sample the posterior istribution. As in Ilin et al.

FFDs with similar gradients, but offset different y-intercepts), implies that these spectral types produce imilar relative proportions of high and low energy flares, but the oolest stars have lower rates of flares of all energies.\nOur results are consistent with three similar studies of the relation etween flaring rate and energy for cool stars. As previously entioned, Paudel et al. ( 2018 ) measured a range of \u03b1 from 1.3 to .0 for 10 UCDs from K2 light curves. Raetz et al. ( 2020 ) compiled 2 light curves and derived a value for \u03b1 of 1.83 \u00b1 0.05 for FFDs of he coolest stars in their sample (with spectral types M5\u2013M6). Gizis t al. ( 2017 ) found \u03b1 = 1.8 for three UCDs. Ho we v er, our results hav e oticeably lo wer v alues of \u03b1 than se veral other works on mid-to-late -dwarfs. From Kepler light curves, Yang et al. ( 2017 ) and Yang & iu ( 2019 ) generated flare catalogues and found on average M dwarfs ad power-law indices of \u03b1 = 2.09 \u00b1 0.10 (for fully conv ectiv e tars) and \u03b1 = 2.07 \u00b1 0.35, respectiv ely. F or a sample of cool dwarfs bserved by TESS , Medina et al. ( 2020 ) found \u03b1 = 1.98 \u00b1 0.02. eli et al. ( 2021 ) specifically isolated TESS\u2019s observations of stars imilar in spectral type to TRAPPIST-1, for which they found \u03b1 = .11. This work also modified the FFD for TRAPPIST-1 generated y Vida et al. ( 2017 ) to include reco v ery rate, updating their value f \u03b1 from 1.59 to 2.03 \u00b1 0.02. Lin et al. ( 2021 ) used EDEN and 2 light curves to analyse the flaring activity of the nearby active M warf Wolf 359, for which they found \u03b1 = 2.13 \u00b1 0.14. We could nd a lower value of \u03b1 if the incompleteness of the sample is not fully escribed by equation ( 16 ). We see a slightly earlier tail-off at low nergies compared to the Jackman et al. ( 2021 ) model for all spectral ypes, which may be evidence of this. Alternatively, previous works ay find higher values for \u03b1 than this work as the y hav e studied igher energy flares on UCD targets using space-based observations. e are limited in this study to only frequent, low energy flares due o our observing strategy. Therefore, it is possible that power laws ay steepen at higher flaring energies. This analysis agrees with the results of Section 5.3 , which show hat there is a decline in flaring rates as we mo v e to the coolest stars. he injection-reco v ery tests demonstrate that if flares were present n the lowest-mass stars we would be able to detect them; therefore, hese flares must occur too infrequently to be detected with our surv e y trategy.\n.5 Flares and rotation\nrom the SSO data sample, we reco v er 69 (24 A, 22 B, and 23 L) otators, with periods ranging from 2.2 h to 65 d, as shown in Fig. 10 .\ne also find 29 U and 60 N class objects. From here on, we refer to rotators\u2019 as only grades A, B, and L.\nWe find 41 targets for which we can detect both flares and rotation. herefore, of the 78 flaring objects described abo v e, 53 per cent ave clear rotation. Alternatively, we detect flares on 59 per cent of ur rotators. It appears that while the fraction of rotators across all pectral types stays consistently between 20\u201350 per cent, there are ncreasing proportions of slow rotators for the later M9 and L0 stars.\nWe see clearly that the very fast rotators are much more likely to are than slow rotators. By comparing the rotation period in steps f 0.25 d, P , with the proportion of stars with rotation periods \u2264P hat flare (see Fig. 11 ), we demonstrate that the likelihood that we etect a star as flaring decreases as the rotation slows. In Fig. 11 we nly include our 46 \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 grade rotators, as the periods of the L\u2019 (long period) grade rotators have very large uncertainties. In this ample, at least 74 per cent of fast-rotating stars, with P \u2264 2 d, flare.\nomparatively, 59 per cent of all rotators flare, 63 per cent of \u2018A\u2019 and B\u2019 rotators flare, 42 per cent of stars with no detected rotation flare, nd 50 per cent of all stars flare. We note that the majority (33/46) of A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 rotators have periods \u22642 d.\n.5.1 Comparison with MEarth\nithin the SSO Sample, 20 targets also appear in the Newton t al.

F or the eight objects in agreement: two ave long period rotation measured by MEarth, with periods too long o be measured by SPECULOOS (for which we find no rotation); our have no detected rotation with either surv e y; and two hav e a imilar measured period by both surv e ys (though one has only a entative detection with the SSO). For the remaining 12 objects, v e hav e clear, short periods detected by SPECULOOS but not by Earth, and two have long-period, low-amplitude estimates given y SPECULOOS with no detection in MEarth. We discount the emaining five objects classified as U/N in both surv e ys, with missing r disagreeing periods. All of the rotation periods measured by the wo surv e ys are shown in Fig. 12 , and their o v erlapping observations re reported in Table 3 .\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nThe difference in rotation periods measured by the two surv e ys s likely a result of their different observing strategies. While PECULOOS performs continuous monitoring of every target for \u20138 h each night o v er sev eral weeks, MEarth c ycles through multiple argets during a night, returning to each at 20\u201330 min cadences. This dvantages SPECULOOS to observ e v ery short, < 5 h period rotators, nd MEarth to measure very long, > 50 d rotation periods. We also erive a long-period rotation estimate with SPECULOOS for two bjects with small amplitudes that may not be evident in the MEarth ata, due to limitations on the lowest mass stars. MEarth experiences drop-off in reco v ery rate for stars with M < 0.2 M (which includes ll of the objects in our sample) likely due to systematics and the recipitable water effect (Newton et al. 2018 ). The Newton et al. ( 2018 ) sample shows a clear dichotomy of fast otators, with periods less than 10 d, and slow rotators, with periods reater than 70 d. We are unable to confirm this, as the majority of ur sample have been observed for less than a 10-d span. For the clear low rotators, which we observe for less than a full phase, we can nly assign a long-period estimate (L). The apparent gap in rotation eriods from our sample between 1 and 2 d is likely a bias from the ifficulty in disentangling real rotation from 1-d aliases.\n.5.2 Comparison with TESS\neli et al. ( 2021 ) study the relationships between age, activity, and otation for a sample of 248 \u2018TRAPPIST-1 analogues\u2019 from 30-min ESS Full Frame Image (FFI) observations. They detect a total of 4 flare events on 21 stars. We compare their target catalogue to the SO data sample and find 35 objects that appear in both. Of these 35 bjects, we detect 19 as flaring, including five of the seven targets that eli et al. ( 2021 ) identify as flaring. The five objects that both surveys dentify as flaring stars are Gaia DR2 2331849006126794880, 349207644734247808, 3200303384927512960 (as shown in ig. 3 ), 4825880783419986432, and 5055805741577757824.

For 14 of the targets in this o v erlapping ample of 35 objects neither surv e y detects an y flares. The 21 v erlapping objects (excluding the 14 that have no flares detected y either study) are presented in Table 4 . For 42 stars in their sample, Seli et al. ( 2021 ) detect rotation eriods. Out of the stars that appear in both UCD samples, Seli et al. 2021 ) find rotation periods for four objects that appear in our cataogue. We find rotation periods for 16 of the 35 objects (with rotation lasses A, B, or L). Therefore, we can also compare both our flaring nd rotation results for this handful of targets. For three of these bjects, we detect an alias of the period extracted from TESS 30-min FIs. For each of these three objects, we inspected the SSO light urves and periodograms. In each case, the rotation period measured y Seli et al. ( 2021 ) is the second most promising period, ho we ver, he peaks in the periodogram are very close in power, and the chosen eriod usually gives a better phase coverage. This is the reason for the B\u2019 grade we assign to rotators Gaia DR2 2349207644734247808 nd 4967628688601251200. Gaia DR2 3200303384927512960 is ssigned a grade of \u2018A\u2019, ho we ver, it is a unique case. For this target, e detect a rotation period of 0.334 d, while Seli et al. ( 2021 ) measure period of 0.500 62 d. Rotation periods of 0.33, 0.5, or 1 d are special cenarios for ground-based observations where, o v er short baselines, e only see the same part of the phase on e very observ ation night. herefore, due to the limit imposed by the day-night cycle, we are nable to distinguish between these periods. The target for which we o not detect any rotation period, Gaia DR2 4971892010576979840, as an amplitude for periodic photometric variation of 2.1 mmag measured by Seli et al. ( 2021 )]. Upon inspection of this object\u2019s SO light curve, this periodicity is too small to detect abo v e the level f photometric scatter, and residual systematics. Since TESS is a space-based mission that does not contend\nith the day-night cycle or ground-based systematics, and they erform 27-d continuous monitoring, this provides a large number of hases for fast-rotating stars, which can counteract lower photometric recisions for red dwarfs. Therefore, we would expect rotation eriods derived from TESS light curves to be more accurate than hose from ground-based observations.\nFor their catalogue of stars, Seli et al. ( 2021 ) find that \u223c8 per ent are flaring. This flaring fraction contrasts this work, where we etect flares on 28 of the 57 M7\u2013M9 objects within the SSO sample 49 per cent). There may be several reasons for this discrepancy. irst, Seli et al. ( 2021 ) detect flares from light curves with a low ime resolution of 30 min. TESS is also not optimized for very red bjects such as UCDs, therefore the photometric precision is lower han for SPECULOOS. Both of these factors inhibit a flare surv e y n TESS data from detecting low energy flares (which have small mplitudes and short durations) on UCDs. Instead, continuous 27-d onitoring of each TESS field allows Seli et al. ( 2021 ) to probe the arer, high energy (even superflare) flare regime. This is demonstrated y their reco v ery fraction, which is less than 20 per cent for flares ith energies below 10 31.5 ergs, compared to SSO reco v ery fractions f 50\u201370 per cent (depending on spectral type) for the same energy. dditionally, in this paper, we demonstrate that cooler stars flare less requently at all energies, therefore it is likely that a surv e y focused n high energy flares on cool stars would detect significantly fewer ares. Finally, space-based data are less impacted than ground-based ata by time-varying systematics due to the Earth\u2019s rapidly changing tmosphere, therefore the risk of false positives is presumably lower.\nDI SCUSSI ON\n.1 Extension into the ultra-cool regime\nhe breadth of the SSO flare sample allows us to compare the flaring nd rotating behaviour of mid-M stars with UCDs. We predominantly etect flares on M5\u2013M7 stars ( \u223c60\u201370 per cent flare), and decreasing roportions of flaring stars for both earlier and later M dwarfs. Since here is a spectral dependency to our flare detection (Fig. 6 ), it is ikely that we are missing the lower energy flares on mid-M dwarfs, nd therefore underestimating the proportion of flaring stars. On the ther hand, these higher mass objects do produce rarer, high-energy ares more frequently than late-M dwarfs (Lacy et al. 1976 ). These igh-energy flares should be easier to detect. Our results also agree\nMNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\nM\nw i s t\nm e r s w f h t f l\ne p s t a t t m t a l o s a c t o w w S t m e 2 c ( fl \u223c c\nt ( S a d t h a t o w v e b t n\n2 T t h f s o i t h a s c c a a c d p s\n6\nO e ( o r d a c s d t o\n6\nF e t b t t c l l S o w p f o d a i M e t\ns\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nith other surv e ys, with around \u223c30 per cent of M4 stars flaring. It s possible that these surv e ys are limited in different ways for mid-M tars, which exist at the redder end of their samples, rather than at he bluer end of ours.\nLacy et al. ( 1976 ) showed that the flares on mid-M dwarfs were ore frequent and lower energy than on early-M dwarfs. Hilton\nt al. ( 2010 ) found that this trend continued into the late-M dwarf egime (M6\u2013M8). From our findings, we see little difference between pectral types up to M7. Ho we v er, our results e xtend be yond M8, here we find that flares of all energies appear to become less requent. From our injection-reco v ery tests, we conclude that if igher energy flares were present on the reddest stars in our sample, hen we would detect them; therefore, the lack of high-energy flares or late-M and L dwarfs on the sampled time-scales of 0.8 to 8.7 d is ikely real.\nWe see a relationship between flaring activity and rotation, specially for our very fastest rotators. The stars with rapid rotation eriods of < 5 d, are much more likely to flare than the rest of the SSO ample. At least 74 per cent of the stars with rotation periods faster han 2 d flare, compared to around 59 per cent of all rotating stars nd 42 per cent of non-rotating stars. Therefore, we are more likely o detect flares on stars where we can determine a rotation period han stars we cannot. Possible explanations are that fast rotators flare\nuch more frequently, more energetically, or are more likely to flare han stars with no detectable rotation period. Being unable to detect rotation period may be a symptom that a star has a period too ong to be measured by our surv e y, or the photometric variations n the rotation time-scale are too small to be seen, possibly due to mall spot co v ering fractions, a low spot-photosphere contrast, or particular orientation of spots (e.g. distributed at the poles). This ontrast between rotators and non-rotators is further enhanced for he very fastest periods ( P \u2264 2 d). Assessing the spectral distribution f our fastest rotators shows that almost all of the M4\u2013M7 stars ith periods less than 2 d flare. Comparativ ely, v ery few objects ith spectral types later than M8 flare, fast-rotating or otherwise. tars with fast rotation will have more magnetic energy available; herefore, these results are consistent with faster rotators exhibiting ore active behaviours (Allred et al. 2015 ; Davenport 2016 ; Newton t al. 2017 ; Mart \u0301\u0131nez et al. 2019 ; Yang & Liu 2019 ; G \u0308unther et al. 020 ). Specific activity-rotation studies on cool stars, such as those arried out by West et al. ( 2015 ), Stelzer et al. ( 2016 ), Medina et al. 2020 ), and Raetz et al. ( 2020 ), have also found that fast rotating stars are more frequently than slow rotators. Seli et al. ( 2021 ) found that 50 per cent of their fast-rotating ( P < 5 d) late-M stars flared, ompared to \u223c70 per cent of our sample with the same periods. In this work, we have compared results for SPECULOOS targets hat also appear in the rotation study performed by Newton et al. 2018 ) on MEarth data, and in the activity-rotation study from eli et al. ( 2021 ) on TESS observations. SPECULOOS and MEarth re two ground-based surv e ys focused on cool stars, but with very ifferent observing strategies. SPECULOOS is a fast-cadence survey hat targets UCDs for relatively short baselines of 4\u20138 d. MEarth, o we ver, re visits its M dwarf targets only every 20\u201330 min, over period of several months. With SPECULOOS\u2019s light curves, herefore, we are able to study the short-term photometric variability f an object, such as its flaring and fast rotation ( < 10 d), whereas ith MEarth\u2019s light curves, we can monitor an object\u2019s long-term ariability, such as any slow rotation ( > 50 d) and stellar surface volution. SPECULOOS and MEarth, ho we ver, are both groundased surv e ys that hav e to contest with the challenges of observing hrough the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the loss of data from the dayight cycle. TESS , a space telescope, is able to perform continuous\nNRAS 513, 2615\u20132634 (2022)\n7 d monitoring of each field, ho we ver UCDs are not its ideal targets. herefore, TESS light curves of UCDs are mostly only available from he 30-min FFIs, and have generally lower precisions. SPECULOOS as the short exposure times and high precisions necessary to identify requent low energy flares, however for rotation, the irregular data ampling and large gaps (limited by weather conditions and the bserving cycle) make it difficult to identify the correct period abo v e ts aliases. For this reason, we recommend caution when interpreting he rotation results from this surv e y, and pro vide \u2018rotation classes\u2019 to elp identify targets with rotation period uncertainties. TESS is only ble to detect the rarer high-energy flares (with large amplitudes and lo w decay times), ho we v er, its ability to pro vide continuous phase o v erage of fast-rotating objects, and to observe up to hundreds of ycles, make it well suited for rotation studies. Comparisons such s these, between ground and space-based surv e ys, and between fast nd slow-cadence observing strategies highlight that they are highly omplementary. Le veraging the dif ferences and the o v erlaps between ifferent surv e ys allows us to fully explore the photometric activity arameter space of UCDs, and unearth more information about the ubsequent impact on any potential planets they might host.\n.2 Planetary impact\nften used to put stellar flares into context, the largest solar flare ver directly observed on Earth was the \u2018Carrington Event\u2019 in 1859 Carrington 1859 ; Hodgson 1859 ). This flare released an energy f 10 32 erg and the associated CME hit the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, esulting in the largest geomagnetic storm on record. This storm isrupted telegraph systems and produced auroras reaching almost s far as the Equator. While our flare sample is relatively low-energy ompared to the wealth of recorded flares on other stellar types, in our ample we detect 14 flares with energies greater than 10 32 erg on 10 ifferent stars. Characterizing these interactions between planets and heir host stars, especially those which have the capability to initiate r destroy life, is vital to our understanding of planetary habitability.\n.2.1 Habitability of Earth-sized planets around UCDs\nrom calculating FFDs for the stars in our sample, we can place nergetic bounds on whether flares can drive photosynthesis (Secion 5.3.3 ) or provide their planets with enough UV flux for the preiotic chemistry described in Section 5.3 to occur. If we extrapolate he FFD power laws to E = 10 34 erg, we have only one M6 star hat provides this necessary UV flux. Ho we ver, there are se veral aveats to these results. As we see a non-linear \u2018tail-off\u2019 effect for ow energy flares due to our detection limits, we likely underestimate ow energy flares rates, resulting in shallower FFD power laws in ection 5.3 . Therefore, without accounting for the completeness of ur flare sample, this work only places upper bounds on the stars hose planets can reach the abiogenesis zone, or which can sustain hotosynthesis. As we mo v e towards cooler stars, we see that the requency of flaring decreases (see Fig. 8 ). Ho we ver, there are only ne of each of the M4, M9, and L0 stars, with at least three flares etected. Due to our low detection efficiency for mid-M dwarfs, we re biased to detect only the most frequently flaring stars; therefore, t is likely that we would see an artificial increase in flare rate for\n4 objects. In contrast, we should be more sensitive to flares of all nergies on our late-M and L dwarf stars, so this bias does not explain he decrease in flare frequency for these stars.\nBy including our detection sensitivity in Section 5.4 and conidering an \u2018average\u2019 star for each spectral type, we can conclude\nm W s l m l o e 2\nt i a s e K r l a U M a t ( b\n( t e b r c h\na fl f t r\ni n o l t p\n7\nB L a u a p c d t l fl\nfl\nt s c i a o d fl c s \u2013 w\nA\nT E g z n c f r n f a ( f A a S 1 g t\nD\nT S F F h\nR\nA A\nB B B B B B B\nC C C C C C\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/2/2615/6570707 by U niversitaetsbibliothek Bern user on 29 M arch 2023\nore general relationships between flare frequency and spectral type. hile there is a wide diversity of flare frequencies for individual tars\u2019 within a given spectral type, on average cooler stars have ower flaring rates. If this trend holds for a larger sample of UCDs, it\nay have severe consequences on the search for life around the very owest mass objects. Similar conclusions have been reached by work n the flaring activity of TRAPPIST-1 (Ducrot et al. 2020 ; Glazier t al. 2020 ; Seli et al. 2021 ) and \u2018TRAPPIST-1 analogues\u2019 (Seli et al. 021 ). If the majority of late-M and L dwarfs have flaring rates too low o initiate the synthesis of ribonucleotides, then for life to originate t must happen through a different mechanism. Possible alternatives re surface hydrothermal vents (Rimmer & Shorttle 2019 ), aerial biopheres (Lingam & Loeb 2019b ), impact-shock synthesis (Furukawa t al. 2015 ), or extraterrestrial delivery (Rimmer & Shorttle 2019 ; rijt et al. 2017 ). We also find that none of our sample meets the equirement set out by Lingam & Loeb ( 2019a ) to sustain an Earthike biosphere, due to the significantly lower photosynthetically ctive radiation (with wavelengths of 400\u2013750 nm) incident within CD habitable zones. These results are consistent with the work of ullan & Bais ( 2018 ) and Lingam & Loeb ( 2019a ). Ho we ver, we re considering an Earth-centric viewpoint, and it has been suggested hat photosynthesis could proceed using deep-sea hydrothermal vents Beatty et al. 2005 ) or at infrared wavelengths, where UCDs are rightest (Scalo et al. 2007 ; Takizawa et al. 2017 ; Claudi et al. 2021 ). The activity of M dwarfs is predicted to decrease as they age West et al. 2008 , 2015 ; Paudel et al. 2019 ). Therefore, it is possible hat earlier in these stars\u2019 life cycles they would produce more nergetic and frequent flares, with enough UV flux to trigger preiotic chemistry on their planets, or even for photosynthesis. The esults in this paper only represent a snapshot of each object at its urrent point in time. We do not consider age in this work due to the uge uncertainties on stellar age estimates for these objects. Modelling of the impact of stellar flares on modern Earth-like nalogues by Tilley et al. ( 2019 ) shows that stars with at least 0.1 are per day with energies abo v e 10 34 erg will strip the ozone layers rom any terrestrial planets they host. We do not extend our FFDs o energies abo v e 10 34 erg as we are probing the low-energy flare egime; therefore, we do not consider ozone depletion in our analysis.\nHere, we have only discussed two aspects of how flares could mpact the habitability of planets around UCDs. In reality, we would eed to apply a more holistic approach. There are a multitude f other factors (such as orbit dynamics, stellar variability, tidal ocking, atmospheric composition, stellar age, etc.) that influence he environments on planets hosted by UCDs, and other possible athways for life that have not been considered here.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ny analysing the high-precision photometry produced by SPECUOOS, we can monitor the activity of late-M and UCDs. This llows us to probe further into the ultra-cool re gime, e xpanding our nderstanding of the relationships between activity and rotation into new parameter space. This work can be used in conjunction with revious and ongoing flare studies on earlier M dwarfs, such as those arried out on TESS, K2, and MEarth observations, to assess the iversity of M dwarfs and how well we can extrapolate the results of hese studies to lower mass objects. We demonstrate the benefit of a arge-scale flare study of UCDs, such as this, to extending existing are catalogues. Using our flare sample to make more general predictions about\naring activity as we mo v e to very low-mass stars, we address\nwo different scenarios in which flares may assist the origin and ustenance of life on planets they host. First, the quiescent UV flux of ool stars is too low for the synthesis of ribonucleotides, a major step n pre-biotic chemistry . Secondly , the visible light incident on planets round cool stars is also found to be too low for photosynthesis to ccur. In both cases, while we find it is possible that flares on active M warfs could provide the necessary extra radiation, the frequency of ares of all energies appears to decrease with spectral type. These two onsiderations alone suggest UCD systems may not be fa v ourable ites for abiogenesis, though other factors \u2013 known and unknown certainly impact the likelihood of finding life in these systems as ell.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe research leading to these results has received funding from the uropean Research Council (ERC) under the FP/2007\u20132013 ERC rant agreement no. 336480, and under the European Union\u2019s Horion 2020 research and innovation programme (grants agreements o. 679030 & 803193/BEBOP); from an Actions de Recherche Conert \u0301ee (ARC) grant, financed by the Wallonia\u2013Brussels Federation, rom the Balzan Prize Foundation, from the BELSPO/BRAIN2.0 esearch program (PORTAL project), from the Science and Techology Facilities Council (STFC; grant no.
