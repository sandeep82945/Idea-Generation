 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop more sophisticated planning algorithms for FlexRDZ beyond HTNs. The paper mentions deep reinforcement learning as an alternative approach. Exploring how different planning algorithms compare in managing RDZs could be interesting future work.

2. Generalize the digital twin model to new environments. The paper mentions their RF propagation model is specialized to the Salt Lake City environment. Research into developing more flexible digital twin models that can generalize across environments could improve applicability. 

3. Explore stochastic planning methods. The results showed stochastic HTN planners outperformed the deterministic version in some cases. Further research into stochastic planning for RDZs could improve performance.

4. Incorporate predictive modeling into FlexRDZ. The system currently reacts to RDZ violations. Adding predictive capabilities to anticipate future violations could further improve management.

5. Evaluate FlexRDZ in real-world deployments. The paper evaluated FlexRDZ via simulation. Testing the system in a live RDZ environment would provide valuable validation and feedback for further improvement.
