    "abstractText": "Objectives: To describe and validate a reference measurement procedure (RMP) for gabapentin, employing quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy to determine the absolute content of the standard materials in combination with isotope dilution-liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) to accurately measure serum and plasma concentrations. Methods: A sample preparation protocol based on protein precipitation in combinationwith LC-MS/MS analysis using a C8 column for chromatographic separation was established for the quantification of gabapentin. Assay validation and determination of measurement uncertainty were performed according to guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the International Conference on Harmonization, and the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. ID-LC-MS/MS parameters evaluated included selectivity, specificity, matrix effects, precision and accuracy, inter-laboratory equivalence, and uncertainty of measurement. Results: The use of qNMR provided traceability to International System (SI) units. The chromatographic assay was highly selective, allowing baseline separation of gabapentin and the gabapentin-lactam impurity, without observable matrix effects. Variability between injections, preparations, calibrations, and days (intermediate precision) was <2.3%, independent of the matrix, while the coefficient of variation for repeatability was 0.9\u20132.0% across all concentration levels. The relative mean bias ranged from \u22120.8\u20131.0% for serum and plasma samples. Passing-Bablok regression analysis indicated very good inter-laboratory agreement; the slope was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 1.03) and the intercept was \u22120.05 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.03). Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was \u22650.996. Expanded measurement uncertainties for single measurements were found to be \u22645.0% (k=2). Conclusions: This analytical protocol for gabapentin, utilizing traceable and selective qNMR and ID-LC-MS/MS techniques, allows for the standardization of routine tests and the reliable evaluation of clinical samples.",

Methods: A sample preparation protocol based on protein precipitation in combinationwith LC-MS/MS analysis using a C8 column for chromatographic separation was established for the quantification of gabapentin. Assay validation and determination of measurement uncertainty were performed according to guidance from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the International Conference on Harmonization, and the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. ID-LC-MS/MS parameters evaluated included selectivity, specificity, matrix effects, precision and accuracy, inter-laboratory equivalence, and uncertainty of measurement. Results: The use of qNMR provided traceability to International System (SI) units. The chromatographic assay was highly selective, allowing baseline separation of gabapentin and the gabapentin-lactam impurity, without observable\nmatrix effects. Variability between injections, preparations, calibrations, and days (intermediate precision) was <2.3%, independent of the matrix, while the coefficient of variation for repeatability was 0.9\u20132.0% across all concentration levels. The relative mean bias ranged from \u22120.8\u20131.0% for serum and plasma samples. Passing-Bablok regression analysis indicated very good inter-laboratory agreement; the slope was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 1.03) and the intercept was \u22120.05 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.03). Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was \u22650.996. Expanded measurement uncertainties for single measurements were found to be \u22645.0% (k=2). Conclusions: This analytical protocol for gabapentin, utilizing traceable and selective qNMR and ID-LC-MS/MS techniques, allows for the standardization of routine tests and the reliable evaluation of clinical samples.\nKeywords: gabapentin; ID-LC-MS/MS; qNMR; reference measurement procedure; standardization; traceability."

In the field of therapeutic drug level measurements (TDM), currently only a few of several hundred utilized medications have been made traceable to higher order references. To expand methodological traceability in TDM, the authors founded an establishment initiative that has developed candidate reference measurement procedures (RMPs) in accordance with ISO 15193 for several drugs.

It acts through binding to voltage-gated calcium channels. It is a widely recognized and commonly used drug with a medical history stretching back almost three decades [1]. First approved as an antiepileptic treatment, gabapentin is currently indicated for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset epileptic seizures and for the management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults [1, 2]. In addition, gabapentin is prescribed off-label for a variety of conditions including pain syndromes [3\u20135], movement disorders [6], alcohol use disorder [7], and neuropsychiatric disorders [8\u201310].\nThe generally accepted therapeutic range for gabapentin in epilepsy is between 2.00 and 20.0 \u03bcg/mL (steady state serum trough value), and values exceeding 25.0 \u03bcg/mL are associated with toxic side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia and viral infections [11, 12]. There is considerable inter-individual variability in the dose required to achieve an optimal response, possibly influenced by dose-related saturable drug absorption [13, 14]. Although therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended for gabapentin, it is only routinely implemented for epilepsy [12, 14\u201316]. However, the optimal therapeutic range in other conditionsmay differ from that of epilepsy [14, 17], and there are also recent concerns about drug misuse and mortality associated with gabapentin overdose or combination with opioids [11, 18, 19]. Rapid and reliable quantitative determination of gabapentin in human serum or plasma is therefore necessary to ensure appropriate therapeutic doses and to monitor usage, across individuals and indications.\nAn ongoing challenge for analytical laboratories is to ensure the accuracy of their results for any given measurand, given the variation inmethodology, instruments, and reagents used across different sites [20]. Thus, the gold standard for accurate measurement and minimum inter-laboratory variability requires the use of an RMP and higher order reference materials [21]. Liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedures have, for many years, provided the cornerstone for RMPs in laboratory medicine. However, while multiple LC-MS/MS methods to quantitate gabapentin in human blood have been reported in the literature [22\u201327] no effort was undertaken to provide an RMP for gabapentin until now.\nHerein, we report a novel method for the measurement of gabapentin, using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy to determine the purity of the standard materials plus isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS (ID-LC-MS/MS) to accurately measure serum and plasma\ngabapentin concentrations. ID-LC-MS/MS is considered as gold standard and has been proposed by the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine and the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine as the key methodology to improve clinical assay standardization [28].\nWhen establishing a reference method, the associated measurement uncertainty must be significantly lower than the allowable uncertainty in routine operation. Thisfigure of merit can be estimated either from the therapeutic range to be monitored or pharmacokinetic consideration-based calculations. Following estimation protocols by Glick, Burnett, or Fraser as outlined in 2001 by Steele and colleagues [29] for several drugs, gabapentin routine TDM measurement uncertainties should not exceed 9% with the therapeutic range derived goals and should stay below approximately 13% if the pharmacokinetic model by Fraser is considered. A recent investigation into the inter-laboratory measurement uncertainty in proficiency testing did show that gabapentin routine services exhibited inter-laboratory uncertainties between 8 and 20% [30]. Correcting for the inter-laboratory expansion factor by applying the average inter-laboratory/intra-laboratory variance component factor of 0.8 [31], this range translates into an intra-laboratory uncertainty range of approximately 6.4\u201316.0%. This is in good agreement with the data derived from the theoretical therapeutic range or pharmacokinetic modelling approaches.\nTo allow for error propagation along the traceability chain, Braga and Panteghini recently suggested that an RMP is granted only one third of the measurement uncertainty of the routine method [32]. For gabapentin, this means that a measurement uncertainty below 3% equalling an expanded uncertainty of 6% is a major design goal. Regarding systematic errors, it is a paradigmatic must that the bias associated with a reference measurement procedure must be nil [33]. This can be achieved by thorough and transparent reference material characterization e.g., either by the mass balance approach or by qNMR.\nThe established non-destructive, primary ratio method of qNMR spectroscopy provides a linear response to the amount of analyte and allows direct traceability to International System (SI) units via qNMR internal standards (ISTDs), which are directly traceable to primary reference material (e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] benzoic acid 350b or NIST PS1 primary standard for qNMR [34]) and can be used to determine the mass fraction (absolute content; g/g) of a calibration standard in a single experiment [35, 36]. Since there is no primary reference material for gabapentin, we developed an in-house qNMR protocol for target value assignment. As such, the\ncombination of qNMR and ID-LC-MS/MS is ideally suited for application as an RMP for themeasurement of gabapentin in human blood samples.\nWithin the following paragraphs we will therefore describe a novel candidate RMP for gabapentin that meets the requirements of the guidelines ISO 15193. To ease the reproduction of the RMP candidate by other laboratories, it is \u2013 in addition to the main body of the paper \u2013 described in detail in supplement documents focusing on the technical implementation of the procedure (Supplemental Material 1), the qNMR-based reference material characterization (Supplemental Material 2), and the calculation of measurement uncertainty (Supplemental Material 3)."

The minimum sample weight for the microbalance used (XPR2, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) was determined according to the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) guidelines (USP Chapters 41 and\n1251). Direct displacement pipettes were used to measure organic solvents and serum. For the preparation of stock and spike solutions, volumetric glassware (Class A volumetric flasks) that fulfilled the requirements of ISO 1042 and USP was used.\nqNMR determination of the purity of the standard material\nqNMR measurements were performed on a JEOL 600 MHz NMR with a He-cooled Cryoprobe. Single-pulse-1H{13C}NMR (Supplemental Figure 1) was utilized for the quantitation (NH2CH2; \u03b4= 2.39 ppm, 2H). Additional details about NMR acquisition and processing parameters can be found in Supplemental Material 2.\nPreparation of calibrators and quality control (QC) samples\nThe preparation of calibrator and QC levels, as well as the estimation of calibrator level uncertainties (type B uncertainty), was executed based on Taibon et al. [37]. A detailed description of the methods used to calculate calibrator level uncertainty can be found in Supplemental Material 3.\nIn brief, two individual calibrator stock solutions were prepared and further used for the preparation of working and spike solutions. For each stock solution, 50mg of gabapentinwasweighed in tin boats on a microbalance (XPR2, Mettler Toledo) and dissolved in 5 mL 50% methanol in Milli-Q water (v/v) using a volumetric flask to achieve concentrations of 10 mg/mL. The exact concentration of the stock solutions was calculated based on the purity of the reference material (99.6% \u00b1 0.3%, determined by qNMR) and the exact amount weighed.\nThese primary stock solutions were further diluted with 50% methanol to obtain working solutions with a concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL. Stock and working solutions were used (separately) for further preparation of the eight calibrator spike solutions in 50% methanol (v/v). Final matrix-based calibrators, uniformly distributed from 0.300\u201348.0 \u03bcg/mL (see Figure 1), were prepared with a 1 + 99 dilution (v/v) in human serum matrix.\nFour levels of matrix-based QC samples (QC levels) were prepared in the same way as described for the calibrator levels using a third independent stock solution and resulting spike solutions. The concentrations for the QC levels were set at four critical control points: above the limit of quantification (0.500 \u03bcg/mL), below (1.50 \u03bcg/mL) and within (6.00 \u03bcg/mL) the therapeutic reference range, and at the laboratory alert level (25.0\u03bcg/mL) [12] (Figure 1).

The baseline separation of gabapentin and gabapentin-lactam (154.1 m/z \u2192 95.1 m/z) was evaluated. To examine possible interfering matrix signals for the analyte quantifier and qualifier transition, an analyte-free human serumpoolwas checked at the expected retention time. In addition, analyte-free human serum was spiked with deuterated ISTD to evaluate a possible amount of residual unlabeled analyte within the stable isotope labelled ISTD.\nMatrix effects: In order to determine possiblematrix effects, qualitative post-column infusion, a comparison of standard line slopes [41], and a comparison of absolute areas of analyte and ISTD were performed [42].\nIn the post-column infusion setting, a neat solution of the analyte (10 ng/mL gabapentin inmobile phase A) was infusedwith a flow rate of 7 \u03bcL/min via a T-piece into the HPLC column effluent prior to entering the MS/MS system to generate a stable analyte background signal. A processedmatrix samplewas injected and the change in the background signal was measured. Different matrices, such as neat solution (mobile phase A), native human serum, surrogate serum, and plasma (Li-Hep, K2-EDTA, and K3-EDTA) (all matrix pools made up from five individual donors), were analyzed. Any decrease or increase of the MRM analyte signal at the expected retention time would indicate a matrix component-mediated effect on the ionization yield of the gabapentin transitions.\nA comparison of standard line slopes was performed comparing the following matrices: neat solution (mobile phase A), native human serum pool, TDM-free human serum, and Li-Hep plasma. Calibrator levels were prepared as described in the \u2018Preparation of calibrators and quality control (QC) samples\u2019 section.\nSlopes and coefficients of determination were compared. In addition, the calibrator samples in surrogate matrix, native serum, and plasma were evaluated as controls by applying the neat calibration as standard. Recoveries were reported as the percentage of recovery of the measured concentration relative to the nominal concentration.\nA comparison of absolute areas of analyte and ISTD slopes was also performed. Analyte and ISTD solution were spiked in the four abovementioned matrices after protein precipitation for three levels spread over theworking range (1.50\u03bcg/mL, 6.00\u03bcg/mL, and 25.0 \u03bcg/mL). The ion enhancement or suppression was evaluated by comparing the peak areas of analyte and ISTD of the matrix samples against the neat samples. All samples were prepared in five replicates.\nLinearity: For determination of linearity, calibration curves were prepared in sixfold as described in the \u2018Preparation of calibrators and quality control (QC) samples\u2019 section. Two additional spike solutions were prepared to obtain spiked serum samples for an extended calibration range of \u00b120%, with final concentrations of 0.240 \u03bcg/mL and 60.0\u03bcg/mL. The peak area ratio of analyte to the corresponding ISTDwas plotted against the respective analyte concentration (\u00b5g/mL). Correlation coefficients and residuals for each curve were determined and the regression model was chosen accordingly. In addition, the linearity of the method was proven on the basis of the recovery of serially diluted samples using the preferred regression model for calculation. Sample levels were prepared as follows: calibrator level 1 was sample 1 and calibrator level 8 was sample 11. Using these two samples, ninemixtures were diluted as follows: 9 + 1 v/v, 8 + 2 v/v, 7 + 3 v/v, 6 + 4 v/v, 5 + 5 v/v, 4 + 6 v/v, 3 + 7 v/v, 2 + 8 v/v, and 1 + 9 v/v. Measurement results were required to show a linear dependency. Recovery was reported as the percentage of recovery of the measured concentration relative to the nominal concentration of the sample pools.\nLower limit ofmeasuring interval (LLMI): Precision and accuracy at the quantitation limit (QL) were determined by measuring spiked serum matrix samples in the expected concentration range of the QL. The QL matches with the lowest calibrator level (0.602 \u03bcg/mL). Samples were prepared infive replicates and recovery, bias and precision determined.\nPrecision and accuracy: A 5-day validation experiment as described in Taibon et al. [37] was performed to evaluate precision and accuracy of the developed method. Total method variability was estimated using an ANOVA-based variance component analysis including components such as between-injection variability, between-preparation variability, between-calibration variability, and between-day variability. On each day, four spiked serum and Li-Hep plasma samples covering the measuring range (0.500, 1.50, 6.00, and 25.0 \u03bcg/mL), as well as two native patient serum samples that were close to the medical decision point (approximately 0.700 and 9.00 \u03bcg/mL), were prepared in triplicate for part A and B and injected twice (n=12 measurements per day over 5 days). For each part, an independent calibration curve was generated and used for quantitative analysis. Data evaluation was done with an internal statistic program based on variance component analysis of the VCA Roche Open-Source software package in R [43].\nAccuracywas assessed using four spiked human serumandplasma samples (levels 1\u20134) with the following concentrations: 0.500, 1.50, 6.00, and 25.0 \u03bcg/mL. Dilution integrity was performed using two spiked serum samples (gabapentin-free human serum) at concentration levels of 54.0 \u03bcg/mL and 60.0 \u03bcg/mL (dilution 1 and 2). All samples were prepared in triplicate for part A and part B (n=6measurements) on one day. Accuracy was reported as the percentage of recovery of the measured concentration relative to the spiked concentration.\nSample stability: The stability of the processed samples on the autosamplerwas investigated at 7 \u00b0C after 7 days. For this purpose, calibrator and QC levels from the precision and accuracy assessment described in the \u2018Precision and accuracy\u2019 section were used. Recoveries were calculated by comparing with the measured value of the sample freshly prepared.\nStability of thematrix-based calibrator and control material stored at \u221220 \u00b0C was evaluated after 4 weeks. Recoveries were calculated by comparing with the measured value of the sample freshly prepared.\nEquivalence of results between independent laboratories: The agreement of the RMP between two independent laboratories (Laboratory 1: Dr. Risch, Buchs SG; and Laboratory 2: Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg)was assessed by amethod comparison study including 122 native samples provided by Laboratory 2. Samples consisted of native, anonymized serum and plasma patient samples, sample pools, and spiked samples to cover the whole measuring range. A three-day precision experiment was also performed at Laboratory 2 based on the experimental design described in the \u2018Precision and accuracy\u2019 section. Spiked samples were provided by Laboratory 1.\nThe RMP was transferred to Laboratory 2 and system setup was applied as described in the Supplemental Material 1 with following adaptions: an ultra-microbalance XP6U/M (Mettler Toledo) and aluminium weighing boats were used for the preparation of stock solutions. For the preparation of spike solutions an Eppendorf Multipette\u00ae E3/E3x was used.\nUncertainty of measurements: Measurement uncertainty was determined according to the GUM [40] and Taibon et al. [37]; the following parameters were evaluated (I) uncertainty estimation of qNMR target value assignment of primary reference material (II) uncertainty estimation of the preparation of calibratormaterials, and (III) estimation of uncertainty of the LC-MS/MS method. A detailed description is given within the Supplemental Material 3."

Since there are currently no primary reference materials for gabapentin available, traceability was established by using qNMR ISTDs that are directly traceable to primary standards. Therefore, six individual experiments (Supplemental Figure 2 in Supplemental Material 2), involving six individual weightings of the analyte and DSS-d6 were performed yielding a final content value of 99.6 \u00b1 0.3% (coverage factor k=1).\nSelectivity/specificity\nAll elements of the novel method were carefully evaluated during the design phase of the project, and a prototype method was evaluated prior to method validation. The optimization of the LC-MS/MS setup included mobile phase composition and gradient, stationary phase selection, and ion source optimization during the setup of the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) experiment.\nBaseline separation of gabapentin and the known interfering compound gabapentin-lactam (see Figure 2) was ensured by the developed gradient combined with the\nreversed-phase column (Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8). The chromatographic resolution (R) was \u22658.5 for all tested matrices, calculated as follows: R=2 * (tR2\u2013tR1)/(wb1+wb2), where tR1 and tR2 was the retention time of peaks 1 and 2, respectively, and wb was the peak width at baseline.\nThe selectivity was further determined by analyzing sample pools of analyte-free native human serum, surrogate serum, and human plasma (Li-Hep). No signals were detected at the expected retention time. Furthermore, no residual unlabeled analyte was observed in the ISTD [2H6]-gabapentin."

Slopes (n=6 sample preparations) were found to be 0.253 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.251 to 0.256) for the native serummatrix, 0.251 (95% CI 0.248 to 0.255) for the neat solution, 0.253 (95% CI 0.251 to 0.256) for the surrogate serum matrix and 0.255 (95% CI 0.251 to 0.258) for the plasma matrix. The CIs of the slopes are overlapping, which leads to the assumption that they are not significantly different from each other, supporting the absence of matrix effects. Moreover, mean r2 values were \u22650.999 independent of the matrix used for calibration.\nMatrix samples (n=6 sample preparations), when calibrated against neat, showed a relative bias for all matrices and levels ranging from\u22121.2 to 4.2%with CVs of less than 4.4%.\nAdditionally, matrix effects were evaluated based on Matuszewski et al. [42]. Analyte peak areas, ISTD peak areas, and area ratios from spiked matrix samples were compared with spiked neat samples. Matrix effect values of >100% indicate an ionization enhancement and values <100% indicate an ionization suppression. No matrix effect was observed, with values ranging from 99 to 104% for the\nanalyte and from 103 to 105% for the ISTD in all tested matrices (Table 2). The area ratios were between 96 and 101%. Thus, the compensating effect of the present labelled ISTD is confirmed."

            "text": "The presented ID-LC-MS/MS-based candidate RMP enables the quantification of gabapentin in human serum and plasma. Its design was derived from considerations for routine measurement of gabapentin by LC-MS/MS. Therefore, tandem mass spectrometry with ionization via electrospray (ESI) and reversed-phase chromatography were chosen. Since gabapentin has a relatively high concentration in serum or plasma, protein precipitation followed by dilution was considered advantageous over liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction.\nThe presented validation study showed that the developed method meets the requirements for a reference method for gabapentin in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility. The transfer of the method to a second independent laboratory proved that such a transfer is possible without significant increase in bias between laboratories. This demonstrates that both the established multiple point calibration approach, measured in bracketing mode within the analytical series, and the sample preparation protocols are robustly designed and allow themeasurement of low sample volume complaint samples as well as large method comparison studies in a reasonable time frame in addition to the intended use of target value assignment.\nConsequently, the method thus fulfills both the requirement to take a leading role in the traceability chain and the requirement to be able to perform method comparison studies and check problematic routine samples.\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Aline Hoffmeister, Monika Kriner, Alexandra Herbik, Marion Deuster\nand Michael Dedio for their support in selecting and providing samples.
