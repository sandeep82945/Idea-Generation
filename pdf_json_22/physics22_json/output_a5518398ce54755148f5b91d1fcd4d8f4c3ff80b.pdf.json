    "abstractText": "Numerical methods in spin-foam models have significantly advanced in the last few years, yet challenges remain in efficiently extracting results for amplitudes with many quantum degrees of freedom. In this paper we sketch a proposal for a \u201chybrid algorithm\u201d that would use both the full quantum amplitude and its asymptotic approximation in the relevant regimes. As a first step towards the algorithm, we derive a new representation of the partition function where each spin-foam vertex possesses its own coherent data, such that it can be individually asymptotically approximated. We do this through the implementation of gluing constraints between vertices, which we study numerically. We further derive an asymptotic expression for the constraints for arbitrary boundary data, including data for which there are no critical points. From this new representation we conjecture an intermediate quasigeometric spin-foam regime describing a superposition of semi-classical vertices glued in a non-matching way via the gluing constraints.",

In this paper we sketch a proposal for a \u201chybrid algorithm\u201d that would use both the full quantum amplitude and its asymptotic approximation in the relevant regimes. As a first step towards the algorithm, we derive a new representation of the partition function where each spin-foam vertex possesses its own coherent data, such that it can be individually asymptotically approximated. We do this through the implementation of gluing constraints between vertices, which we study numerically. We further derive an asymptotic expression for the constraints for arbitrary boundary data, including data for which there are no critical points. From this new representation we conjecture an intermediate quasigeometric spin-foam regime describing a superposition of semi-classical vertices glued in a non-matching way via the gluing constraints.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAmong the multitude of existing approaches to the problem that is constructing a quantum theory of gravity, spin-foam models [1, 2] stand out as a non-perturbative and background independent path integral formulation closely related to canonical loop quantum gravity [3, 4]. Over recent years the field has seen a resurgence in interest particularly directed towards the numerical aspects of its models [5\u201313], having as main motivation the need to elevate the abstract theory to a computationally viable framework capable of making consistent and physically meaningful predictions. This objective is substantially more challenging than one might expect at first sight, and the difficulty is rooted in the intrinsic computational complexity of the spin-foam state-sum. The present work intends to contribute to the effort of making spin-foams computationally more viable in different regimes of the models.\nAs previously mentioned, spin-foam models constitute a class of theories for quantum gravity based on a path-integral approach. While the different theories differ in a number of key technical aspects [1], they all share a number of common features: spin-foams are formulated over a 2- dimensional cell-complex (thought of as a dual object to discrete space-time), to which one assigns group-theoretic data, usually related to unitary and irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the underlying classical gravity theory. The cell complex is commonly taken to be the Poincare\u0301 dual of a triangulation of the classical spacetime manifold, but generalizations to other types of cell-complexes exist [14]. One can then assign a state-sum to this combinatorial and group-theoretic construction, and that state-sum defines the spin-foam amplitude characterizing the system.\nCurrently, one of the most studied and best understood 4d spin-foam model is perhaps the EnglePereira-Rovelli-Livine/Freidel-Krasnov (EPRL/FK) simplicial model [15\u201318], both in Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures. Its particularity resides in the type of group-theoretic data assigned to the cell-complex, which forms a subset of unitary irreducible representations of either Spin(4)\n\u2217 seth.asante@uni-jena.de \u2020 j.d.simao@uni-jena.de \u2021 sebastian.steinhaus@uni-jena.de\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n13 54\n0v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 7\nJu n\n20 22\n2 or SL(2,C), respectively, obtained via the so-called \u201csimplicity constraints\u201d. Heuristically, in the Lorentzian case these constraints are imposed by choosing a time-like normal for each tetrahedron, rendering it space-like, which singles out a subgroup isomorphic to SU(2). This construction has the additional advantage of recovering, at the boundary of the spin-foam, similar states to the ones characterizing the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity.\nThe fundamental amplitudes of the EPRL/FK model, and in particular the vertex amplitude assigned to a dual 4-simplex, is well understood in different regimes. In the case of small representation labels, which we frequently refer to as the deep quantum regime, this amplitude is generically defined as a contraction of invariant tensors, i.e. intertwiners, which can only be efficiently computed numerically. There has recently been a concentrated effort to systematically improve and optimize such numerical algorithms [5], with a main focus on the Lorentzian SL(2,C) EPRL model [6, 7, 19]. These developments culminated in the creation of the efficient sl2cfoam-next package [7], which e.g. unlocked GPUs as computational resources, allowed for a comparison of the full vertex amplitude with its asymptotic formula [5\u20137] and facilitated numerical studies of 2-complexes with multiple simplices, further clarifying the so-called \u201cflatness problem\u201d [20].\nIn addition to these numerical studies, our understanding of the spin-foam vertex amplitude is complemented analytically through an asymptotic approximation for sufficiently large spins. It was shown for a multitude of different spin-foam models and space-time signatures that the vertex amplitude possesses critical points, expressed in terms of coherent boundary data, which dominate in the limit of large representations [21\u201330]. Among other cases, these critical points correspond to geometric 4-simplices, for which the amplitude oscillates with a Regge-type action - a discrete action of general relativity [31]. This robust result is a strong indication that (discrete) gravity might be recovered from spin-foams in an appropriate limit, and it crucially provides a much more tractable analytical expression for the vertex amplitude. These results were used in different contexts, e.g. 2-complexes with multiple simplices, where all variables of the spin-foam - including bulk representations - were treated using asymptotic expansions [32, 33]. This regime is considered to be semi-classical as it is dominated by the solutions to the critical point equations of all variables, up to small deviations away from these points1.\nAt this stage it is not clear how wide the gap is between the quantum regime and the semiclassical one beyond a single vertex amplitude, i.e. when it is that the semi-classical regime becomes a valid approximation for large 2-complexes. A few years ago, effective spin-foam models [8, 34\u201337] were proposed in the hope that they could serve as a tool that would help bridge that gap. The key idea is to consider each vertex as semi-classical, taking the shape of a 4-simplex. Since spin-foams are defined with area degrees of freedom and not edge lengths, neighbouring 4-simplices might not glue properly along tetrahedra, which is understood as a consequence of metric discontinuities or torsion [37, 38]. Shape matching is enforced weakly by so-called gluing constraints, assumed to be Gaussians peaked on equal shape of tetrahedra formulated in terms of dihedral angles, ultimately deriving from to the weak implementation of simplicity constraints. The authors of such models studied triangulations of several simplices and identified regimes in which they recover the classical solution of (length) Regge calculus [34].\nThis paper concerns itself with probing the intermediate regime between the full spin-foam quantum amplitude and the semi-classical one, with a special focus on SU(2) BF theory and on the Lorentzian EPRL/FK model. We term this interpolating regime quasi-geometric (in contrast with the quantum pre-geometric and the semi-classical geometric regimes), since it is dominated not only by critical points, but also by neighbourhoods of those points - where the usual geometric\n1 Such deviations have been called complex critical points in some of the literature [10].\n3 interpretation does not strictly apply. We shall provide throughout the paper numerical evidence supporting the existence and importance of this domain.\nHaving argued for the relevance of the quasi-geometric regime, the problem arises of how to correctly take it into account when performing spin-foam calculations. To this end we sketch a proposal for a hybrid algorithm which, when evaluating spin-foam amplitudes, would use the full quantum amplitude at sufficiently small spins, and transition to an asymptotic approximation at larger spins whenever possible. In order to make use of the usual single-vertex asymptotic amplitude in the context of a general 2-complex, we moreover restructure the spin-foam partition function via the inclusion of gluing constraints, analogous objects to their aforementioned namesakes from effective spin-foams; such constraints benefit the analysis by disentangling the boundary data of each individual vertex.\nThe main focus of this article, as a first step towards the eventual construction of the hybrid algorithm, is the study of the gluing constraints we introduce. Our analysis is both numerical and analytical: we provide a numerical characterization of the gluing constraints for both the Lorentzian EPRL/FK and SU(2) BF models, and, in order to understand the structure of the constraints, we extend the usual methods of asymptotic analysis of spin-foams to provide also an asymptotic expression of the gluing constraints away from the critical points - thus obtaining a function of general boundary data. We conjecture that such an analysis can perhaps be extended to the vertex amplitude itself, and we leave the study of this possibility for the future.\nThe text is organized as follows: in section II we begin with a brief introduction of spin-foam models and discuss the coherent state representation of their partition function. From its structure we argue that the amplitude is not immediately suitable for efficient numerical methods and we propose to slightly rearrange it, explaining the notion of gluing constraints and sketching the idea of the hybrid algorithm. We define the gluing constraints for SU(2) BF theory and for the Euclidean and Lorentzian EPRL models in section III. In section IV we compute their asymptotic expansion on and away from critical points, which we compare to the full numerical results in section V. We close with a general discussion in section VI. Technical details and conventions, like the parametrization of Euclidean tetrahedra in terms of areas and angles, are relegated to the appendix A."

            "text": "In the following we give a broad and rather conceptual overview of spin-foam models [1] in a model-agnostic manner, as we will consider different theories throughout this paper. spin-foam models define a transition amplitude for gravity using representation labels of a gauge group G, which color a 2-dimensional cell-complex \u2206\u2217 dual to a triangulation \u2206 of the underlying space-time manifold M. See table I for a dictionary between the 2-complex and its dual triangulation. In four dimensions one assigns to every face dual to a triangle a label \u03c7t of the unitary irreducible representation D\u03c7t of G. One also considers holonomies from one vertex to another via assignments\nof group elements g\u03c4 \u2208 G to edges dual to tetrahedra. Each of these edges is shared by four faces,\n4 corresponding to the four triangles of a tetrahedron in \u2206. Therefore each edge in \u2206\u2217 is associated with a tensor product of four representation spaces on which the single holonomy g\u03c4 acts. Since we are considering a path integral, we integrate over all possible holonomies per edge, such that to each edge the following object is assigned:\nP{\u03c7t} = \u222b G d\u00b5(g\u03c4 ) 4\u2297 t=1 D\u03c7t(g\u03c4 ) . (2.1)\nHere d\u00b5(g\u03c4 ) denotes the Haar measure of G. The map P constitutes a projector onto the gaugeinvariant subspace of the tensor product of representation spaces. We represent this object pictorially by four wires and a box over the wires: the wires stand for group representations, while the box denotes the group integration, as in the diagram . The explicit form of these projectors\ndiffers depending on the model in question. At the vertices of the spin-foam, which are dual to 4-simplices, five edges meet. When represented pictorially as wires, we connect up the wires at the vertex according to the same combinatorial structure of tetrahedra at the boundary of a 4-simplex; wires corresponding to the same triangle get connected. Here connecting means identification and summation over indices of representation spaces. The group integrations associated to edges of \u2206\u2217 can be explicitly performed, giving rise to a sum over orthonormal invariant tensors and their duals, the intertwiners \u03b9\u03c4 , which are then split and associated to the vertices. Hence, for a given choice of representations and intertwiner labels, we assign a particular contraction of intertwiners to a vertex, resulting in a vertex amplitude. In the intertwiner basis, frequently called the spin-network basis, the partition function is then given by\nZ = \u2211\n{\u03c7t},{\u03b9\u03c4}\n\u220f t d\u03c7t \u220f \u03c3 A\u03c3 , (2.2)\nwhere A\u03c3 denotes the vertex amplitude dual to the simplex \u03c3 and d\u03c7t denotes the dimension of the representation \u03c7t (or some appropriate notion of dimension in case the representation space is infinite-dimensional)."

A specially useful basis for these identities is the coherent state one, which, for the class of spin-foam models considered here, is constructed via SU(2) states. In the vector space Hj associated to the unitary and irreducible representation of SU(2), one has the relation\n1j = dj \u222b SU(2)/U(1) dh |j, h\u3009\u3008j, h| \u2261 j , (2.3)\nwhere dj = 2j + 1 is the dimension of Hj and |j, h\u3009 are coherent states, i.e. states of the form\n|j, h\u3009 = Dj(h) |refj\u3009 \u2261 j,h , h \u2208 SU(2)/U(1) . (2.4)\nIt is common to take the reference state |refj\u3009 to be either a maximal weight state |j, j\u3009 or a lowest one |j,\u2212j\u3009, though the identity holds generally. Although such coherent states form a basis only\n5 of the representation spaces of SU(2), they turn out to induce bases for all spaces relevant for the spin-foam models studied in this article, where the gauge group is either SL(2,C) or SU(2). The construction for the special linear group is reviewed in section III C.\nChoosing to expand the spin-foam amplitudes in terms of SU(2) coherent states, the partition function generally reads\nZ = \u2211 {\u03c7t} \u222b \u220f t \u220f t,\u03c4 d\u03c7tdht,\u03c4 \u220f \u03c3 A\u03c3 , (2.5)\nwhere there is a coherent state label per pair of triangle t and tetrahedron \u03c4 . The coherent vertex amplitude A\u03c3 is in turn given by\nA\u03c3 = \u222b G \u220f \u03c4 d\u00b5(g\u03c4 ) \u220f \u03c4,\u03c4 \u2032 \u3008J .\u03c7t, ht,\u03c4 |D\u03c7t(g\u22121\u03c4 g\u03c4 \u2032)|\u03c7t, ht,\u03c4 \u2032\u3009 \u2261 . (2.6)\nOn the right hand side stands the standard graphical representation (ignoring orientations) of the coherent vertex amplitude. The lines with dots at the ends represent inner products of coherent states connecting different faces. Solid rectangles represent group integrations over the group representations, as mentioned previously. We remind the reader that the above expression is only schematic, as a number of technical details must be observed depending on the model at hand (e.g. one needs to regulate the SL(2,C) model by removing one of the group integrations).\nThe coherent state parametrization is useful for studying the asymptotics of vertex amplitudes [23\u201325, 27\u201329, 39], often also referred to as the semi-classical limit or \u201clarge j / large representation limit\u201d. There one considers the partition function (2.5) for a single vertex and fixed boundary and computes the stationary phase approximation of the integral over (several copies of) the group G. To this end the inner product of coherent states is exponentiated to an action, whose critical and stationary points dominate if all representations \u03c7t are large. It is a robust and frequently derived result that these critical points correspond to the boundary data of geometric 4-simplices (among other solutions called vector geometries [5, 24]), where the associated vertex amplitude oscillates with the Regge action of this 4-simplex [31]. This is an encouraging finding and an indication that continuum gravity might be recovered from spin-foams in a suitable limit.\nWe now comment on the practical matter of evaluating the coherent amplitude for multiple vertices. Each integration over the coherent state variables dht in the partition function (2.5) is performed over a pair of vertex amplitudes, since for two vertices \u03c3, \u03c3\u2032 sharing a common edge \u03c4 both vertex amplitudes A\u03c3 and A\u03c3\u2032 carry the same label ht,\u03c4 . Computing these integrals is challenging for two reasons: the primary reason are the integrals themselves, which are multidimensional and highly oscillatory, in particular for large representations; for SU(2) the labels h\u03c4 are normalized vectors ~h \u2208 S2 [40], and hence there is an eight-dimensional integral per bulk edge. Clearly this gets quickly overwhelming. The second reason has to do with the non-locality of coherent data integrations, which makes it difficult to study the asymptotic regime of the full spin-foam amplitude for more than one vertex. As an example, consider an equilateral vertex amplitude, i.e. all the spins are equal. One dominant contribution is an Euclidean equilateral 4-simplex [5], whose five tetrahedra are also equilateral. Consider gluing this vertex to another vertex, whose remaining representations are not the same, potentially giving rise to a critical point in which the shared tetrahedron is not equilateral. In the coherent state representation the coherent data of glued vertex amplitudes must be equal, such that the dominant contribution from the integral over coherent data is determined by the overlap of both vertex amplitudes. This contribution might well come from a configuration which agrees with neither critical point of the vertex amplitudes.\n6 While accounting for this is not impossible, it requires one to compute the overlap of glued coherent vertex amplitudes, which in turn must be known sufficiently away from their critical points, and to repeat this procedure for all remaining neighbouring vertex amplitudes - but, as far as we are aware, a general asymptotic formula for the coherent vertex amplitude away from its critical points is currently not known. One could alternatively study the asymptotic amplitude of the full 2-complex, but this is only possible in a case-by-case basis. On the other hand, the insights from the asymptotic analysis of single vertex amplitudes, i.e. the dominance of critical points, suggest that it should be possible to optimize these integrations, e.g. identify regions of coherent data that more significantly contribute. In this article we present a proposal for such a method, which might eventually lead to an efficient numerical hybrid algorithm. We discuss its idea in the following.\nB. Idea of a hybrid algorithm\nTo disentangle the coherent data of neighbouring vertices, we adopt the concept of gluing constraints from effective spin-foam models [8, 34\u201336], and derive these constraints directly from the actual models. Starting from the coherent state representation, we again insert a resolution of identity on each edge. This procedure doubles the coherent data (and integrations) per edge, such that each vertex amplitude carries its own set of data n\u03c4 . In this manner every pair of vertices in the bulk is connected by an object which encodes how well their respective boundary data fit together: the gluing constraints. Such a pair of vertices would then schematically take the form\n, (2.7)\nwith the middle diagram representing the constraints. In section III we will clarify the diagram above by explicitly defining different variants of these constraints, specifically gauge-variant and gauge-invariant types (equivalent at the level of the partition function), for different symmetry groups and spin-foam models.\nHaving each vertex amplitude equipped with its own set of coherent data, one can apply the wellstudied asymptotic analysis per vertex : for sufficiently large spins - a condition the precise meaning of which must be carefully studied - the integral over coherent data should only receive contributions from (small regions around) the critical points of the vertex amplitudes, which can furthermore be approximated by the semi-classical formula on the critical points. In general, the critical points of vertices will not match, and this is accounted for in the gluing constraints. Hence we conjecture the existence of an additional regime in spin-foams models, where the vertices exhibit semi-classical, geometric features, but the overall geometry still fluctuates and shape matching of glued vertices is not strongly enforced. We thus expect that the landscape of spin-foam configurations can be split roughly into three domains:\n\u2022 Pre-geometric regime - superposition of quantum geometric building blocks;\nFor the smallest representations, spin-foam amplitudes describe genuine quantum geometric objects best understood in the orthonormal spin network basis. The vertex amplitudes must be numerically computed for all representation and intertwiner labels and summed over. This process gets more costly with increasing representation labels.\n\u2022 Quasi-geometric regime - superposition of semi-classical geometries;\nFor large enough spins, the vertex amplitudes can be approximated by their asymptotic expansion and only small regions around critical points contribute. Therefore, we have a\n7 superposition of local critical point configurations, corresponding to degenerate, vector and Regge geometries, glued in a non-matching way. For an appropriate domain of representation labels, non-matching vertices corresponding to small neighbourhoods around critical points are non-negligible in the amplitude.\n\u2022 Geometric regime - globally semi-classical geometries;\nIncreasing representation labels further eventually results in only shape-matching configurations contributing to the path integral substantially. The amplitude of the full 2-complex is dominated by the global critical points, i.e. those of the entire 2-complex. As before, for finite representations small regions around these global critical points might still be non-negligible.\nPartial evidence for the existence of a quasi-geometric regime already exist in the literature. The convergence of the semi-classical approximation of the vertex amplitude to the full coherent amplitude was shown in recent years [5, 7] for different models, as was numerically proven the exponential suppression of amplitudes without a critical point. In section II C we expand on this by considering configurations around critical points, finding they are progressively less suppressed the closer they are to criticality. While more evidence is required to determine when quasi-geometry arises, we hope to use this regime to help bridge the gap between quantum and semi-classical physics and augment existing numerical algorithms. Our proposal is to develop a \u201chybrid algorithm\u201d, following the idea of the \u201cChimera\u201d algorithm in loop quantum cosmology [41], which uses the full quantum dynamics when necessary and switches over to semi-classical, less costly, algorithms as soon as those provide a good approximation. In this regime, the hybrid algorithm would compute the semi-classical amplitudes vertex-wise, and then pair-wise match them using the gluing constraints."

            "text": "At the level of a single vertex amplitude, little is known about an analytical formula away from the critical points. Interestingly, such an analsys was done for bulk representations in spinfoams consisting of multiple vertices in the context of the so-called \u201cflatness problem\u201d [42\u201348]. In [10] the authors show in case of the \u22063-triangulation (where three 4-simplices share one bulk triangle and all edges are part of the boundary) that for large but finite representations there are non-negligible contributions from configurations away from critical points, interpreted as complex critical points. In contrast to real critical points, which enforce a vanishing deficit angle in the associated triangulation, the complex ones allow for small but non-vanishing angles and contribute significantly to the path integral in an appropriate regime. This is in line with numerical results in [7, 20], where exponential suppression was shown for boundary data with a non-vanishing deficit angle in the bulk. We stress however that these complex critical points are sub-leading relative to the actual critical configurations, and they must eventually become negligible as the representations are further increased.\nIn order to explore the amplitudes around critical points, deviations from criticality are understood as follows: starting from a critical configuration, e.g. an equilateral Euclidean 4-simplex or an isosceles Lorentzian 4-simplex, we modify the boundary data in two different ways. The first variant introduces a violation of the closure condition in the normal vectors associated to a tetrahedron. These violations get more and more severe, leading to a stronger exponential suppression. In the second case we demand closure for all tetrahedra, but change their dihedral angles away from the critical point3. Thus the shapes of triangles of glued tetrahedra do not match, resulting in an exponential suppression. Again, we expect a more severe violation to result in a stronger exponential suppression compared to the critical point. The parameters used for non-closing data are collected in table II, and the ones used for non-matching data can be found in table III.\n3 To be precise, non-closing data also violate non-matching; thus we expect non-closing data to show more suppression, but both cases cannot be readily compared.\n2.a. In SU(2) BF theory\nAs a first example, consider an equilateral Euclidean 4-simplex, in which all tetrahedra deviate from equilateral tetrahedra, either by non-closure or non-matching. While the deviations are rather small, we expect a significant decline of the amplitude, since all five tetrahedra deviate. The results for non-closing tetrahedra are shown in fig. 2, and those for non-matching ones can be found in fig. 3. As expected, the exponential suppression is clear for non-closing data: the two larger deviations suffer a very strong suppression, such that the amplitudes are roughly an order of magnitude smaller compared to the equilateral case already at j = 10. Moreover, the oscillations cease in these cases. For the smallest non-closing deviation studied, however, we see a much weaker exponential suppression compared to the rescaled critical amplitude and persisting oscillations, which will probably only seize at even larger spins.\nFor non-matching data we observe a similar behaviour, but overall with less exponential suppression. Indeed, for the smallest deviation studied, barely any decay is visible even though we deviate all tetrahedra and study the amplitude up to spins j > 30. These numerical results thus suggest that for a single vertex amplitude and large but finite representations we can always find a\n10\n(sufficiently) small region around the critical points in which the exponential suppression is (still) negligible, which is in line with the results found in [10] for the bulk deficit angle of the \u22063 triangulation. As we increase the spins the region around the critical point shrinks, since stronger deviations get more and more suppressed. Note that in particular the cases we studied in fig. 2 are still close to equilateral tetrahedra, and the exponential suppression for strongly violating data is more severe.\nThe final case we consider is an unusual one. In [6], the authors study the SL(2,C) EPRL coherent vertex amplitude for a Lorentzian isosceles 4-simplex, whose tetrahedra are all space-like. The boundary data corresponding to this 4-simplex is a critical point for Lorentzian EPRL, and below we will recover some of the authors\u2019 results. Before doing so, we consider the same boundary data in the context of SU(2) BF theory, where it does not correspond to a critical point and is exponentially suppressed. Still, this data is interesting for a different reason: a key ingredient in efficiently computing the SL(2,C) EPRL vertex amplitude is to express it as a sum of SU(2) {15j} symbols for auxiliary labels contracted with matrices encoding the action of boosts [49]. The infinite sum over the auxiliary labels starts at the label j of the boundary spins. Therefore, a SU(2) {15j} symbol evaluated for Lorentzian boundary data is related to the first term appearing in the expansion the full SL(2,C) vertex amplitude.\nIn fig. 4 we plot the coherent SU(2) vertex amplitude evaluated for the isosceles Lorentzian 4-simplex, labeled by a set of ten spins {5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}. The first four spins correspond to an equilateral tetrahedron, while the remaining spins label four isosceles tetrahedra with spins\n11\n{5, 2, 2, 2}. We have additionally considered two configurations, in which we replace the equilateral tetrahedron either by the largest non-closing or non-matching configurations used before. Since none of these configurations correspond to a critical point of SU(2) BF theory, none of them oscillate and they all decay exponentially. Still this Lorentzian 4-simplex is singled out even in SU(2) BF theory; deviating away from it results in an even stronger exponential decay, in particular for the non-closing configuration. From this we can draw several conclusions. The first term in the infinite sum over auxiliary SU(2) spins of the SL(2,C) EPRL vertex amplitudes contributes significantly. While it decays exponentially, its suppression is less than one might have naively expected. However, it is also clear that this single term is not sufficient to recover the oscillatory nature of Lorentzian EPRL vertex amplitudes, as observed in [6], and additional terms are necessary to get the correct polynomial scaling behavior. It would be interesting to better understand how the full SL(2,C) amplitude emerges as a sum over SU(2) {15j} symbols, e.g. to learn whether the infinite sum can be truncated with little error.\n2.b. In Lorentzian EPRL\nWe study the coherent vertex amplitudes for both an equilateral Euclidean 4-simplex and the aforementioned isosceles Lorentzian 4-simplex in the SL(2,C) EPRL model using the sl2cfoam-next package. We ran the code on a consumer laptop, such that we were not able to probe large values of \u03bb or shells s (encoding the truncation of the infinite sum over virtual spins), but we believe the domain we considered is sufficient to clearly show the exponential suppression away from the critical points of the vertex amplitude. For both sets of boundary data we modify only a single tetrahedron by the same deviations as above. Both simulations were run for a Barbero-Immirzi parameter of \u03b3 = 0.5. Regarding the shell number, we chose s = 1 for the Euclidean simplex and s = 4 for the Lorentzian one. Due to the similarity of results, we only plot the non-closing deviations; qualitatively, the non-matching cases are similar to the previous SU(2) ones and simply show less exponential decay.\nIn figure 5 we plot the coherent vertex amplitude for an equilateral Euclidean 4-simplex, where we can recognize an exponential decay away from the critical point at already fairly small representations. For the smallest non-closing deviation, increasing \u03bb further would be necessary to capture more half periods and clearly see the exponential suppression. Note that, since we only deviate a single tetrahedron rather than all five of them, the suppression is less accentuated than in the SU(2) case.\n12\nIn figure 6 we plot the amplitude for boundary data corresponding to an isosceles Lorentzian 4-simplex, now also for non-closing boundary data for a single tetrahedron. We find a far stronger suppression compared to the Euclidean case, yet this is due to the different boundary data. At \u03bb = 10 we are computing the vertex amplitude for representations (\u03c1, n) = (50, 20) (see section III C for the necessary representation theory), which is significantly larger than 10 for the same \u03bb in the equilateral case. Again, for the smallest non-closing deviation, this small \u03bb is not sufficient to observe an exponential decay. Still, these results confirm again our expectation that for increasing spins all vertex amplitudes that significantly contribute to the path integral are located in a small but non-singular region around the critical points.\nAll the above results support the heuristic expectation that spin-foam models should possess a regime in which only small regions around the critical points of each vertex amplitude contribute to the path integral. At the same time, it is clear that more thorough investigations are necessary to make qualitative statements more quantitatively precise, e.g. by identifying for which representations this statement is valid. We leave this for future research."

            "text": "In this section we shall formally introduce and define the gluing constraints for the SU(2) BF and Lorentzian EPRL-FK spin-foam models. As mentioned in section II B, the gluing constraints appear through the process of fully disentangling the coherent vertex amplitudes assigned to vertices of a 2-complex via insertions of identities expressed in terms of the coherent states. We shall consider the case where the 2-complex is dual to a triangulation by simplices; the vertex amplitudes are thus associated to 4-simplices of the dual triangulation.\nIn the coherent state representation, the partition function associated to a 2-complex can be expressed as a product of the vertex amplitudes after doubling the gauge group integration and inserting resolutions of the identity on the representation spaces of that group, expressed in terms of coherent states. The partition function would then take the schematic form\nZ = \u2211 {\u03c7t} \u222b \u220f (\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032) \u220f t d\u03c7t dht ht . (3.1)\nAs one may see, the resulting vertex amplitudes are not all independent, as the same coherent data\n13\nassociated to a common edge is shared between a pair of vertices. There is however a straightforward way to gain better control over the mutual dependence of the vertices. We can isolate the vertex amplitudes by inserting at the common edge an extra identity (2.3) in terms of coherent states,\nZ = \u2211 {\u03c7t} \u222b \u220f (\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032) \u220f t d2\u03c7t dht dkt ht kt (3.2)\nsuch that now every vertex amplitude carries its own coherent data at the boundary. In this manner we get for every (bulk) edge shared by a pair of vertices a term which is represented by the four lines in-between the amplitudes in (3.2). It is a tensor product of inner products between coherent states associated to the edges belonging to the pair of vertices. We refer to the extra terms as gluing constraints as they specify how pairs of vertices glue or fit together.\nAs it stands, the gluing constraints do not share any of the symmetry properties of the vertex amplitude. Since these are ultimately derived from the symmetries of the Haar measure, we may remedy this by proposing a definition of the gluing constraints which involves an integration over the gauge group of the theory. We chose to do so, and define the gluing constraints to generally be given by\nG\u03c4 = \u222b G d\u00b5(g) 4\u2297 t=1 \u3008J .\u03c7t, ht|D\u03c7t(g\u03c4 )|\u03c7t, kt\u3009 = ht kt . (3.3)\nWe would like to remark that the particular symmetry properties of G\u03c4 depend on what one considers to be its domain of definition. Indeed, if one takes the boundary data of the constraints to be general group elements ht, kt \u2208 SU(2), then the constraints are invariant under the action of g, g\u2032 \u2208 SU(2) by virtue of the bi-invariance of the Haar measure, i.e. G\u03c4 (ght, g\u2032kt) = G\u03c4 (ht, kt). On the other hand, if one considers the boundary data to be given by coherent states (which, we remind the reader, are constructed from a reference state as |\u03c7, h\u3009 = h |ref\u03c7\u3009 , D\u03c7(h) \u2208 SU(2)/U(1)), then the gluing constraints are only invariant up to a phase factor (a property which extends to the coherent vertex amplitude), and this has been termed covariance in the literature [5] for the case of the vertex amplitude. The reason is that the group action on a coherent state results in a second coherent state up to a phase, as SU(2)/U(1) is not closed under multiplication. Thus it holds only that |G\u03c4 (g . ~ht, g\u2032 . ~kt)| = |G\u03c4 (~ht,~kt)|. In order to avoid having to deal with multiplicative phase factors we will, for the rest of the paper, take G\u03c4 = G\u03c4 (ht, kt).\nAlthough including a group integration in the definition of the constraints can be argued to increase its computational complexity, it has the advantage of allowing the constraints to more closely resemble the structure of a vertex amplitude. The gluing constraints may then serve as a testing ground for properties of the actual vertex (we shall see in section 4.1 that these objects share the same qualitative behaviour in the asymptotic limit), and we further speculate that the gauge invariance afforded by the group integration may be potentially useful in the construction of the hybrid algorithm.\nBefore moving on towards the explicit definition of the gluing constraints for different classes of models, we would like to point out that such objects have already made an appearance in the literature to some extent. The gluing constraint of equation (3.3) involves two coherent intertwiners (not necessarily the same) associated to every bulk edge. In the special case when the two coherent intertwiners are the same, the gluing constraint becomes the norm of that coherent intertwiner. The asymptotics of the norm of coherent intertwiners has been studied in [40] for G = SU(2). The gluing constraints appear also in [50] as a special case of general invariants of SL(2,C), and\n14\nthe authors have studied some of its asymptotic properties. In the remainder of this paper we complement these previous results by studying the constraints in detail for different spin-foam models."

The symmetrizers of ji and j \u2212 i can be absorbed into that of j + i . Following the construction in [24], the gluing constraints can be defined by insertions of identity over SU(2) coherent states.\n\u2022 FK model\nFor the FK spin-foam model [18], SO(4) coherent states are given in terms of SU(2) coherent states through |j+, h+\u3009 \u2297 |j\u2212, h\u2212\u3009 and |j+, h+\u3009 \u2297 |j\u2212, h\u2212\u3009 for \u03b3 < 1 and \u03b3 > 1, respectively, where h+ = h\u2212. For \u03b3 < 1, this leads to the same gluing constraints (3.13) as for the \u03b3 < 1 EPRL model. If one takes \u03b3 > 1, the FK gluing constraints take the form\nGFK\u03b3>1 = \u222b Spin(4) d\u00b5(g) 4\u220f i=1 \u3008hiJ |g+|ki\u30092j + i \u3008hiJ |g\u2212|ki\u30092j \u2212 i . (3.14)"

The role of the gluing constraints would then be to restrict the dominant configurations at each neighbouring vertex so as to enforce consistent gluing among simplices. Heuristically [8] this is expected to be implemented via a localized (presumably Gaussian-like) distribution over the boundary data. We dedicate this section to the asymptotic study of the gluing constraints for the most ubiquitous spin-foam models, and we shall show that they indeed reduce to Gaussian functions, peaked at gluing tetrahedra."

To this end we shall make thorough use of Ho\u0308rmander\u2019s theorem [53] (Theorem 7.7.12) on the asymptotic evaluation of integrals subject to free parameters, which we reproduce here for the reader\u2019s convenience.\nTheorem IV.1 (Ho\u0308rmander). Let S(x, y) be smooth and complex-valued in a neighbourhood K of (0, 0) \u2208 Rn+m, such that =S \u2265 0, =S(0, 0) = 0, S\u2032x(0, 0) = 0 and detS\u2032\u2032xx(0, 0) 6= 0.

Thus the possible f 0(y)\nare defined by expansions of the type\nf(x, y) = f0(y) + \u2202S\n\u2202xi (x, y)qi(x, y) , (4.2)\nfor n smooth functions qi(x, y). f0 is not unique, but another choice of representative will induce a correction of the same order as the error term in equation (4.1). That f(x, y) can be brought into this form near the origin is a consequence of the Malgrange preparation theorem [53], which can be thought of as a division theorem with remainder f0(y). As it stands, however, the explicit form of the coefficients in equation (4.2) are difficult to obtain. We remedy this by resorting to a second theorem of [53].\nTheorem IV.2. Let bj(x, y), j + 1, ..., n, be smooth and complex-valued in a neighbourhood K of (0, 0) \u2208 Rn+m, such that bj(0, 0) = 0 and det \u2202xibj 6= 0.

Note that \u03b1 = (\u03b11, ..., \u03b1n) stands for a multi-index set, and |\u03b1| = \u2211 j \u03b1j . Note furthermore that the |\u03b1| = 1 term is an element of IN , and thus it can be omitted from equation (4.4). This x-polynomial representation of f(x, y) will be useful in what follows, as it allows a direct comparison with the function\u2019s Taylor series.\nB. Asymptotics of SU(2) gluing constraints\nThe SU(2) case is the simplest among the ones we will study, so we shall start by deriving its asymptotic behaviour first. As a function of the boundary data for a certain choice of spins, the gluing constraint of equation (3.6) may be brought into the form,\nGji(hi, ki) = \u222b SU(2) d\u00b5(g) exp { 4\u2211 i=1 ln \u3008J . hi, ji |Dji(g) | ki, ji\u3009 } , (4.5)\nwhere |k, j\u3009 stands for a coherent state Dj(k) |j, j\u3009 in the Hilbert space Hj associated to the unitary and irreducible SU(2) representation of spin j."

Haar measure and coordinates in SU(2)\nPerforming the Haar integral in equation (4.5), as well as computing the derivatives appearing in (4.8), requires one to choose coordinates \u03c6i : Ui \u2208 G \u2192 R3 on the group manifold G = SU(2). However, since we are interested in making use of theorem IV.1 rather than analytically evaluating the integral, we can substantially simplify the discussion by implicitly picking useful coordinates and explicitly specifying only the values of the derivatives in those coordinates.\nWith a slight abuse of notation (we omit the dependence on \u03c6i), let dg be the exterior derivative of the preimage of a chart,\ndg : R3 \u2192 TgG . (4.9)\nThe differential and right-multiplication Rg for matrix groups satisfies dR \u22121 g X = Xg \u22121 for X \u2208 TG, g \u2208 G, and hence the map dgg\u22121 must take values in the Lie algebra g ' TeG. One may think of this object as a 1-form7 in R3 with values in g, such that it admits an expansion in terms of \u03c3I (Pauli matrices) generators\ndgg\u22121 = i\n2 \u03c3J\u2126\nJ , \u2126J \u2208 T \u2217R3 ' R3 . (4.10)\nGenerally, then one sees that coordinate derivatives of g \u2208 G may always be written as \u2202Ig = i 2\u2126 J I\u03c3Jg, for \u2126 J I a matrix of coefficients dependant on the choice of charts \u03c6i. A particular simple choice of coordinates is that in which the matrix of coefficients reduces to the identity,\n\u2202Ig = i\n2 \u03c3Ig , (4.11)\nand this is the choice we make for coordinates gI on SU(2) throughout our analysis. Besides derivative terms, the only object in theorem IV.1 which depends on the choice of charts is the Haar measure. But this too can be identified without explicitly defining the map g = g(gI). Indeed, note that the 1-form of equation (4.10) is right-invariant. We may thus construct a measure on G by taking the trace of its third exterior power, which is bi-invariant by virtue of the cyclicity property of the trace operator,\nd\u00b5(g) = Ntr [ (dgg\u22121)\u22273 ] = N 3\n2 \u21261 \u2227 \u21262 \u2227 \u21263 . (4.12)\nGiven that for compact groups the normalized bi-invariant Haar measure is unique, one can determine N by computing (4.12) in both the gI coordinates and some other standard coordinates for which the measure is known, e.g. Euler angle coordinates [51]. Doing so fixes N = 23(4\u03c0)\n\u22122, and the normalized measure for SU(2) in adapted coordinates reads\nd\u00b5(g) = (4\u03c0)\u22122dg1 \u2227 dg2 \u2227 dg3 . (4.13)"

We consider only the SU(2) BF and Lorentzian EPRL constraints, given in (3.6) and (3.24) respectively. Note that the Lorentzian EPRL gluing constraint depends additionally on the Immirzi parameter \u03b3.\nOur choice of parametrization for SU(2) is as follows:\ng \u2261 g(\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8) = e\u2212i\u03c6 \u03c33 2 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03c32 2 e\u2212i\u03c8 \u03c33\n2 , \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0, \u2212\u03c02 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 2 , \u22122\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 2\u03c0 , (5.1)\nwith a corresponding Haar measure is d\u00b5(g) = (4\u03c0)\u22122 sin \u03b8 d\u03c6 d\u03b8 d\u03c8. A coherent state |j, k\u3009 can be parametrized by a spin j and two Euler angles, such that k \u2261 k(\u03c6, \u03b8) := k(\u03c6, \u03b8,\u2212\u03c6). The group element k maps to a unit vector ~k \u2208 S2 directly through the Euler angles, and generally via the inner product ~k = \u3008k|~\u03c3|k\u3009, as in section IV. A coherent intertwiner of a four-valent node can be described by the spins and angles associated to each leg. Coherent intertwiners associated to a classical tetrahedron satisfy the closure constraint C := \u22114 i ji ~ki = 0, and hence not all the parameters are independent. We refer the reader to appendix A for the choice of parametrization of coherent intertwiners used here. We term coherent intertwiners satisfying the closure condition closing intertwiners, and otherwise we call them non-closing.\nWe consider as a first example a closing coherent intertwiner with all spins equal, i.e. ji = \u03bb, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 4. Besides four spins, it is characterized by two dihedral angles {\u03a61,\u03a62} which parametrize the shape of the associated tetrahedron8. The choice \u03a61 = \u03a62 = arccos ( \u221213 )\nyields an an equilateral tetrahedron. The unit-norm vectors orthogonal to the faces of such a tetrahderon can be determined from the spins and angles (see Appendix A) up to a global rotation. Here we pick them to be\n~k1 = (0, 0, 1) , ~k2 = ( 0, 2 \u221a 2\n3 ,\u22121 3\n) , ~k3 = (\u221a 2 3 ,\u2212 \u221a 2 3 ,\u22121 3 ) , ~k4 = ( \u2212 \u221a 2 3 ,\u2212 \u221a 2 3 ,\u22121 3 ) .\n(5.2) A second interesting case is the one of a closing intertwiner corresponding to a non-regular tetrahedron with equal areas, which can be obtained from the angles \u03a61 = arccos(\u221213), \u03a62 = \u03c0 2 . Again, the corresponding normal vectors can be computed using the formula (A4) in Appendix A. The third and last example is that of a non-closing intertwiner with equal spins, obtained from the first example by changing one of the normal vectors. We rotate the polar angle \u03b81 of the first normal vector in (5.2) by an angle \u03b4\u03b81. The new orthogonal vectors are thus\n~k\u20321 = (sin(\u03b4\u03b81), 0, cos(\u03b4\u03b81)) ~k\u2032i = ~ki , i = 2, 3, 4 , (5.3)\nfor which the closure constraint evaluates to\nC = j1(~k\u20321 \u2212 ~k1) = j1 (sin(\u03b4\u03b81), 0, cos(\u03b4\u03b81)\u2212 1) . (5.4)\nThese three examples of boundary data, which we will use in the subsequent numerical analysis, are summarized in table IV. In the next subsection, we shall study the gluing constraint between different pairings of these data.\n8 The range of values of \u03a61,\u03a62 are restricted by simplex inequalities or generalized triangle inequalities.\n27"

As mentioned previously, when two boundary intertwiners coincide the gluing constraint amounts to the norm of the intertwiner.

Here we find such a suppression also for the overlap between a closing intertwiner \u03baA and a non-closing intertwiner \u03baC .

We observe a curious phenomenon where the asymptotic formula seems to slightly overestimate the suppression of the constraint, at a rate which is increasingly higher for larger deviations. We noticed these discrepancies become worse with larger values of the Immirzi parameter \u03b3. After carefully checking our code, we believe that the source of this discrepancy is rooted in a numerical instability: the inverse of the Hessian matrix, which enters in the exponential function, depends substantially on very small changes of the matrix coefficients. We are therefore forced to take our results away from the critical points with a grain of salt, until a better understanding of these instabilities is achieved.\n31"

            "text": "In this article we have presented a new representation of the spin-foam partition function in terms of coherent states. By using resolutions of the identity we equipped each edge of the spin-foam with two sets of coherent data, one for each vertex. Each vertex thus carries its own independent set of data, and vertices are glued to their neighbours via gluing constraints. These constraints enforce shape matching weakly and are named after the gluing constraints defined in effective spinfoams [8]. In this way, for large enough representations, one can apply the asymptotic formula of the vertex amplitude directly at each vertex, each of which is dominated only by its own critical points. From this we have conjectured a new quasi-geometric regime of spin-foams, which describes a superposition of semi-classical vertices glued in a non-matching way. Our future goal is to characterize this regime and use it to augment existing numerical algorithms by building a \u201chybrid algorithm\u201d, which switches to less costly semi-classical methods as soon as these provide a good approximation.\nFor now we focused mainly on the properties of gauge-invariant gluing constraints, which we defined for SU(2) BF theory and the Lorentzian EPRL model. We computed these constraints numerically and analytically for different sets of boundary data, e.g. corresponding to non-closing tetrahedra and tetrahedra of different shapes. From both we found that they are (almost) Gaussian peaked on shape matching and closure of the coherent data on both ends, the critical points of the gluing constraints. Crucially, we employed Ho\u0308rmander\u2019s theorem to calculate the gluing constraints beyond those critical points, confirming their Gaussian shapes and peak locations. Indeed, the asymptotic formula provides an excellent approximation for the SU(2) gluing constraints around spin j \u223c 10, whereas the EPRL one is well approximated beyond spins j \u223c 50. The fact that we can analytically compute the gluing constraints (far) away from their critical points is an encouraging sign for future numerical simulations, and it might be possible to use this to significantly speed up calculations. Furthermore, our analysis away from critical points may perhaps in the future be applied to more complicated objects such as the coherent vertex amplitude itself.\nAt this stage we would like to comment on the different types of gluing constraints derived in this article, i.e. the SU(2) type and the Lorentzian EPRL type, and on which role they might play in the Lorentzian EPRL model. From our perspective, both types can in principle be applied to split vertices in the model. Indeed, the SU(2) gluing constraints are in agreement with the EPRL construction, since the particular states entering the vertex amplitude all stem from SU(2) representations embedded into SL(2,C) ones. Vertex amplitudes in the Lorentzian EPRL model can be split at the level of SU(2) states, e.g. SU(2) intertwiners in the spin network basis [19], such that one could straightforwardly apply the SU(2) gluing constraints, which are independent of the Immirzi parameter \u03b3. On the other hand, one can argue for the SL(2,C) gluing constraints as we defined them. Given that SL(2,C) is the underlying symmetry group of the theory, the SL(2,C) constraints would directly project onto the relevant gauge-invariant subspace. They moreover have the added benefit of structurally resembling the actual vertex amplitude, such that they can be used as a more tractable toy model. Still, opting for SU(2) gluing constraints might be numerically more efficient, and it might correctly capture the relevant physics.\nThere exists another reason that drove our study of the Lorentzian EPRL gluing constraints. In effective spin-foam models [8, 34], the postulated gluing constraints are motivated from commutation relations of 3d dihedral angles in tetrahedra, and they are related to the weak imposition of simplicity constraints in spin-foams. This imposition should be connected to the Immirzi parameter \u03b3. One of our goals was therefore to define gluing constraints for the EPRL model with an explicit \u03b3-dependence, and to compare them to this previous proposal. To this end we have studied the constraints for boundary data corresponding to geometric tetrahedra that differ in their two angles that parametrize them. As mentioned above, we find the EPRL gluing constraints to be\n33\nalmost Gaussian shaped (with slightly too long tails), peaked on shape matching and showing little \u03b3-dependence. What this implies regarding the weak imposition of constrains in the model, and whether the constraints restrict strongly the allowed geometries, are two interesting questions to investigate in the future.\nWith the definition of the gluing constraints and their accurate asymptotic formula on and away from critical points, an important first step towards building the hybrid algorithm is done. However, many open conceptual and technical questions must be addressed. One of the most pressing ones is the regime in which such an algorithm is valid; in this work we have presented some first evidence, but more thorough investigations are needed. Work on the coherent vertex amplitude for higher valent spin-foam vertices [13] suggests that the transition between the quantum and semi-classical vertex regimes might be more intricate, e.g. if some spins are large yet others remain small. Moreover, it is vital to generate all critical vertex configurations for a given set of ten representations, which can correspond to degenerate, vector or Regge geometries. Previous work in this direction exists as part of the sl2cfoam-next package [6, 7], as does an algorithm that translates from areas to lengths configurations in the framework of effective spin-foams for different signatures [34, 36]. We moreover hope that our algorithm will help shed light on the question of what role configurations other than Regge geometries play in the spin-foam path integral, e.g. whether gluing degenerate or vector geometries to Regge geometries is (strongly) suppressed. This might help us identify the most relevant geometries of multiple vertices in the path integral. Eventually, we must develop the hybrid algorithm in detail and demonstrate that we can faithfully approximate the full quantum amplitudes by non-matching semi-classical vertices glued together via gluing constraints."

            "text": "It is well known that the geometry of a classical tetrahedron can be determined from its six edge lengths or equivalently from its four triangle areas and two (non-opposite) dihedral angles up to SO(3) rotations. A unit normal vector k\u0302i associated to a face fi of a tetrahedron is a vector in the unit two-sphere S2. Such a unit normal vector can be parametrized by the spherical angles as\nk\u0302i(\u03b8i, \u03c6i) = \u00b1 (sin \u03b8i cos\u03c6i, sin \u03b8i sin\u03c6i, cos \u03b8i) . (A1)\nThe form of the normal vectors follows from the particular parametrization of SU(2) in (5.1). Let ki, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 4 be the outward pointing normal vectors (not normalized) belonging to the face of the tetrahedron \u03c4 . Without loss of generality, we can use the freedom under SO(3) rotations to take one of the normal vectors to be along the z-axis, and to take a second vector to be in the y-z plane. That is, we choose the normal vectors (not normalized) to be of the form\n~k1 = (0, 0, c1) , ~k2 = (0, b2, c2) , ~k3 = (a3, b3, c3) , ~k4 = (a4, b4, c4) . (A2)\n34\nThe normal vectors are chosen such that the norm of each vector gives the corresponding area of the triangle face. For a closed tetrahedron the normal vectors satisfy the closure condition\nC := 4\u2211 i=1 ~ki = ~0 , (A3)\nand hence ~k4 = \u2212(~k1 + ~k2 + ~k3). These normal vectors determine the geometry of a tetrahedron up to SO(3) rotations. Note that the squared volume of the tetrahedron in terms of the normal vectors is V 2\u03c4 = \u2212~k1 \u00b7 (~k2 \u00d7 ~k3).\nAs an example, consider four area square terms pii = ~ki \u00b7 ~ki = A2i , i = 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 4 and two inner product terms p1j = ~k1 \u00b7 ~kj for j = 2, 3 (non-opposite edges). We can easily solve for the variables ai, bi, ci in terms of the pii and p1j . This results in vectors of the form\n~k1 = (0, 0, \u221a p11) , ~k2 = 1 \u221a p11 ( 0, \u221a p11p22 \u2212 p212, p12 ) , (A4)\n~k3 = ( V 2\u03c4\u221a\np11p22 \u2212 p212 , (2p12p13 + p11(p11 + p22 + p33 \u2212 p44 + 2p12 + 2p13) 2 \u221a p11(p11p22 \u2212 p212) , p13\u221a p11\n) ,\n~k4 = \u2212(~k1 + ~k2 + ~k3) ,\nwhere the squared volume is\nV 2\u03c4 = ( \u2212 p12p13 (p11 + p22 + p33 \u2212 p44 + 2p12 + 2p13)\u2212\np11 4 (p11 + p22 + p33 \u2212 p44 + 2p12 + 2p13)2\n+ p33(p11p22 \u2212 p212)\u2212 p213p22 ) 1 2 . (A5)\nEach normal vector is of the form ~ki = \u221a pii k\u0302i for all i, and hence the inner products can be given in terms of Euler angles associated to the unit normal vectors (see (A1)). For the vectors in (A4), we get the inner products\np12 = \u221a p11 \u221a p22 cos \u03b82 , p13 = \u221a p11 \u221a p33 cos \u03b83 . (A6)\nThe Euler angles \u03b82, \u03b83 are exactly the dihedral angles of the associated edges e12, e13. In general, the four spins ji = \u221a pii together with two (non-opposite) 3d dihedral angles \u03a6i, i = 1, 2 parametrize a closing intertwiner with normal vectors given in (A4). The variables \u03a61,\u03a62 are related to the Euler angles by \u03a61 = \u03b82 and \u03a62 = \u03b83.\nFor a non-closing intertwiner, the closure constraint is violated, that is\nC = \u03b5 = (\u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53), (A7)\nwith \u03b5 6= 0. The four normal vectors are therefore unconstrained. Such non-closing intertwiners can also be constructed starting from a closed intertwiner and performing SO(3) rotations of some or all of the face unit normal vectors k\u0302i while keeping their norms fixed. A rotation of a unit normal vector k\u0302i(\u03b8i, \u03c6i) by Euler angles (\u03b4\u03b8i, \u03b4\u03c6i) will result in a general vector k\u0302(\u03b8i+\u03b4\u03b8i, \u03c6i+\u03b4\u03c6i) 11. Thus\n11 Certain combinations of (\u03b4\u03b8i, \u03b4\u03c6i) for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 4 can result in a closing intertwiner.\n35\nrotating one or more normal vectors of a closing intertwiner will result in a non-closing intertwiner as long as the closure constraint is violated.\n[1] Alejandro Perez, \u201cThe Spin Foam Approach to Quantum Gravity,\u201d Living Rev.
