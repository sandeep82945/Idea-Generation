    "abstractText": "Transport coefficients are typically divergent for quantum integrable systems in one dimension, such as a Bose gas with a two-body contact interaction. However, when a one-dimensional system is realized by confining bosons into a tight matter waveguide, an effective three-body interaction inevitably arises as leading perturbation to break the integrability. This fact motivates us to study the thermal conductivity of a Bose gas in one dimension with both two-body and three-body interactions. In particular, we evaluate the Kubo formula exactly to the lowest order in perturbation by summing up all contributions that are naively higher orders in perturbation but become comparable in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity. Consequently, a self-consistent equation for a vertex function is derived, showing that the thermal conductivity in quasi-one-dimension is dominated by the three-body interaction rather than the two-body interaction. Furthermore, the resulting thermal conductivity in the weak-coupling limit proves to be identical to that computed based on the quantum Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is numerically determined.",

However, when a one-dimensional system is realized by confining bosons into a tight matter waveguide, an effective three-body interaction inevitably arises as leading perturbation to break the integrability. This fact motivates us to study the thermal conductivity of a Bose gas in one dimension with both two-body and three-body interactions. In particular, we evaluate the Kubo formula exactly to the lowest order in perturbation by summing up all contributions that are naively higher orders in perturbation but become comparable in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity. Consequently, a self-consistent equation for a vertex function is derived, showing that the thermal conductivity in quasi-one-dimension is dominated by the three-body interaction rather than the two-body interaction. Furthermore, the resulting thermal conductivity in the weak-coupling limit proves to be identical to that computed based on the quantum Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is numerically determined.\nCONTENTS\nI.

INTRODUCTION\nA nonvanishing Drude weight indicates a divergent transport coefficient at zero frequency and serves as diagnostics of whether the transport is ballistic or diffusive [1]. As far as fluids with translational invariance are concerned, the Drude weight for mass transport is always nonvanishing because the mass current (i.e., momentum) is conserved [2], whereas that for energy transport typically vanishes if particles are interacting. However, quantum integrable systems in one dimension have\nbeen found so exceptional that their Drude weights remain nonvanishing due to a macroscopic number of conservation laws [3, 4]. One such system is a Bose gas with a two-body contact interaction known as the Lieb-Liniger model [5, 6], whose Drude weight was derived with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz [7].\nAn ideal platform for experimental study of the LiebLiniger model has been provided by ultracold atoms [8, 9], where anomalous nonequilibrium dynamics rooted in the integrability was observed [10]. However, when a onedimensional system is realized by confining bosons into a tight matter waveguide, effective multibody interactions inevitably arise from virtual transverse excitations in spite of their interaction being purely pairwise in free space [11\u201313]. Although such multibody interactions are usually neglected in a dilute gas, the three-body interaction may cause significant consequences for transport properties because it is the leading perturbation to break the integrability.\nThe purpose of our work is to elucidate possible consequences of the three-body interaction for an energy transport of a Bose gas in one dimension by studying its thermal conductivity in the weak-coupling limit. To this end, we first formulate our system in Sec. II as well as present its basic properties necessary for later analyses. Then, the thermal conductivity is evaluated microscopically with the Kubo formula in Sec. III and also based on the quantum Boltzmann equation in Sec. IV. We will find that these two approaches lead to the identical result, where the thermal conductivity is dominated by the three-body interaction rather than the two-body interaction. Finally, its temperature dependence is numerically determined in Sec. V and our findings are summarized in Sec. VI. Appendix A presents complementary information regarding the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity and the approximate resummation scheme.\nOur work partly follows the analysis described in Ref. [14] by adapting it for a Bose gas in one dimension with weak two-body and three-body interactions but at\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n04 93\n6v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 5\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 arbitrary temperature.

Therefore, it is necessary and sufficient for our purpose to keep up to the three-body coupling and regard g2 \u223c g3 \u223c O(g) as small perturbations.\nThe particle number, momentum, and energy are conserved in our system.

            "text": "In summary, we studied the thermal conductivity of a weakly interacting Bose gas in one dimension with both two-body and three-body interactions. Our work is motivated by the fact that an effective three-body interaction inevitably arises as the leading perturbation to break the integrability. To elucidate its consequences for an energy transport, the Kubo formula was evaluated exactly to the lowest order in perturbation by summing up all contributions that are naively higher orders in perturbation but become comparable in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity. Consequently, a self-consistent equation for a vertex function was derived [Eq. (47)], which proved to be identical to the linearized version of the quantum Boltzmann equation [Eq. (59)]. The resulting thermal conductivity was found to be finite, indicating that the energy transport turns diffusive due to the threebody interaction rather than the two-body interaction.\nIn particular, when our system in quasi-one-dimension is realized by confining weakly interacting bosons with a two-dimensional harmonic potential, the thermal conductivity for 0 < a3D l\u22a5 1/N , 1/ \u221a mT is predicted to be\n\u03ba = (l\u22a5/a3D) 4N [12 ln(4/3)]2m \u03ba\u0303(T\u0303 ). (66)\nHere, Eq. (3) is employed and \u03ba\u0303(T\u0303 ) is the dimensionless function obtained numerically in Fig. 6, which exhibits the power-law scalings distinct at low and high temperatures. Our findings are directly relevant to ultracold atom experiments where the thermal conductivity is measurable [37\u201340], and may be useful for better understanding of their nonequilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the bulk viscosity of a one-dimensional Bose gas can be studied along the lines of analyses developed recently in Refs. [41\u201346] for Fermi gases in higher dimensions, which will be reported elsewhere [47, 48]."

(A9)\nAlthough both two-body and three-body contributions are naively O(\u03c9\u22122) at low frequency, we find that\n\u03ba(\u03c9)|O(g22) = \u03b22\n\u03c92 \u222b p,p\u2032,q,q\u2032 W2(p, p \u2032|q, q\u2032)fpfp\u2032(1 + fq)(1 + fq\u2032)Qp(Qp +Qp\u2032 \u2212Qq \u2212Qq\u2032) +O(\u03c90) (A10)\ncancels out due to the energy and momentum conservations in W2(p, p \u2032|q, q\u2032) but\n\u03ba(\u03c9)|O(g23) = \u03b22\n\u03c92 \u222b p,p\u2032,p\u2032\u2032,q,q\u2032,q\u2032\u2032 W3(p, p \u2032, p\u2032\u2032|q, q\u2032, q\u2032\u2032)fpfp\u2032fp\u2032\u2032(1 + fq)(1 + fq\u2032)(1 + fq\u2032\u2032)\n\u00d7Qp(Qp +Qp\u2032 +Qp\u2032\u2032 \u2212Qq \u2212Qq\u2032 \u2212Qq\u2032\u2032) +O(\u03c90) (A11)\nremains at the leading order.\nBecause \u03ba(\u03c9)|O(g23) is formally divergent at zero frequency, obtaining the thermal conductivity in Eq. (24) requires the resummation. To this end, we express Eq. (A7) by Im[\u2212D/(\u03c9+ i0+)] and regard Im[iD/(\u03c92\u03c4)] from Eq. (A11) as a leading correction in a simple geometric series [42, 44, 49, 50]. Consequently, the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity is brought into the Drude form of\n\u03ba(\u03c9) \u2248 Im ( \u2212D\n\u03c9 + i/\u03c4\n) =\nD\u03c4\n(\u03c9\u03c4)2 + 1 , (A12)\nwhere D is the Drude weight in the noninteracting limit and \u03c4 is the relaxation time introduced in Eq. (65). Because the thermal conductivity is found to be lim\u03c9\u21920 \u03ba(\u03c9) = D\u03c4 , the approximate resummation scheme adopted herein is equivalent to solving the linearized Boltzmann equation with the relaxation-time approximation as described in Sec. V. In particular, the\nthermal conductivity diverges as \u03ba(\u03c9) = D\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9) in the limit of vanishing three-body interaction, \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, because the two-body interaction does not contribute to the finite relaxation time in one dimension.\nFinally, we note that the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity of nonintegrable but momentum-conserving systems is considered to be divergent as \u03ba(\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\u22121/3 at sufficiently low frequency \u03c9 1/\u03c4hydro due to enhanced hydrodynamic fluctuations in one dimension [51\u201353]. If this is the case, our finite thermal conductivity \u223c D\u03c4 is valid only at 1/\u03c4hydro \u03c9 1/\u03c4 \u223c O(g23) assuming the existence of such a frequency window. Because all leading-order divergences up to O(g2) are resumed into Eq. (A12), hydrodynamic fluctuations should be subleading or higher-order effects in perturbation. Whether and how such divergence resulting from hydrodynamic fluctuations arises in our microscopic approach remains an important problem to be resolved in future work.\n[1] W.
