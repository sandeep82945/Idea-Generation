That said, we will be in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for a long time, working on dozens or even thousands of qubits quantum computing systems. An outstanding challenge, then, is to come up with an application that can reliably carry out a nontrivial task of interest on the near-term quantum devices with non-negligible quantum noise. To address this challenge, several near-term quantum computing techniques, including variational quantum algorithms, error mitigation, quantum circuit compilation and benchmarking protocols, have been proposed to characterize and mitigate errors, and to implement algorithms with a certain resistance to noise, so as to enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum devices and explore the boundaries of their ability to realize useful applications. Besides, the development of near-term quantum devices is inseparable from the efficient classical simulation, which plays a vital role in quantum algorithm design and verification, error-tolerant verification and other applications. This review will provide a thorough introduction of these near-term quantum computing techniques, report on their progress, and finally discuss the future prospect of these techniques, which we hope will motivate researchers to undertake additional studies in this field.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum computing is a rapidly emerging new-generation computing paradigm that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics, offering the potential of exponential speedup over classical computation for certain problems [1\u20134]. Over the last decade, quantum computing technologies have advanced by leaps and bounds into the NISQ era [5, 6], an important sign of which is the significant achievement of quantum computational advantage on quantum sampling problems has been realized in practice [7\u201312]. The near-term quantum processors, including superconducting qubits [5, 13, 14], trapped ions [15, 16], and photons [17\u201319], etc., produced during this period contain only a few dozen or even a few thousand qubits, falling well short of the specifications for fault-tolerant quantum computing [20\u201324] (see TABLE. I for system parameters of some prototypes). They do, however, serve as fantastic testing grounds for investigating a variety of applications, including machine learning [25], secure cloud quantum computing [26\u201330], computational science, and complicated quantum chemistry [31] and many-body quantum systems [32] that are not feasible to be simulated with the state-of-the-art supercomputers.\nTo fully exploit the potential of near-term quantum devices,\n* quanhhl@ustc.edu.cn \u2020 sunxiaoming@ict.ac.cn \u2021 bws@qiclab.cn \u00a7 gllong@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn # These four authors contributed equally.\nalgorithms/protocols have to be tailored to the constraint of present quantum hardware, especially a modest of qubits with non-negligible errors and limited qubit connectivity. To mitigate quantum errors and achieve valid computational results, several prominent classes of algorithms and tools have been developed specifically for near-term quantum computers, including:\n\u2022 Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) [33, 34]. VQAs have emerged as one of the leading candidates to achieve application-oriented quantum computational advantage on NISQ devices, owing to their hybrid quantum-classical approach which has potential noise resilience.\n\u2022 Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) [35]. QEM refers to a series of techniques that allow us to reduce the computational errors and then evaluate accurate results from noisy quantum circuits, although we still lack practical quantum error-correction technique.\n\u2022 Quantum Circuit Compilation (QCC) [36\u201338]. QCC is a key technique to transform the nonconforming quantum circuit to an executable circuit on the target quantum platform according to its constraints, including the native gateset, connectivity and so on.\n\u2022 Benchmarking Protocols [39, 40]. Quantum benchmarking helps to evaluate the basic performance of a quantum computer and even the capacity to solve realworld problems.\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n08 73\n7v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 7\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 \u2022 Classical Simulation [41\u201345]. Classical simulation of quantum circuits is one of the core tools for designing quantum algorithms and validating quantum devices.\nThese techniques work together to accomplish computational tasks rather than independently of each other (see a rough relationship provided in Fig. 1). For instance, variational quantum algorithms, quantum error mitigation, quantum circuit compilation, and quantum benchmarking may all require the help of classical simulation for verification or algorithm design. These near-term quantum computing techniques offer the opportunity to attain practical quantum advantages that can be applied to significant applications such as chemistry [46, 47] and machine learning [48\u201361], and they also provide a continuous path for the advancement of quantum computing from today\u2019s near-term quantum hardware to tomorrow\u2019s fault-tolerant quantum computers.\nThis review aims to present an overview of these crucial techniques, part of which may serve as a supplement and update to related published review works [33\u201335, 39], and some algorithms and protocols are step-by-step taught to help the reader rapidly understand the specifics. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities, and offer some insights on potential future advances.\nII. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM ALGORITHMS\nAlthough some quantum algorithms, such as Shor\u2019s algorithm [3] and Grover\u2019s search algorithm [4], promise to be much faster than classical algorithms, these algorithms are unattainable in the NISQ era due to the lack of error correction capability. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been shown to be naturally resistant [62] to, and even benefit from, noise, making them particularly suitable for nearterm quantum devices, and are therefore considered the most promising route to quantum advantage on practical problems in the NISQ era [33]. In this section, we will first introduce the basic concepts, architectures and applications of VQAs, and then discuss the opportunities and challenges for future industrial applications or scientific research."

            "text": "The cost function (sometimes referred to as the loss or objective function) is an integral part of VQAs for encoding problems, and serves essentially the same role as the cost function in classical machine learning. During the training process, the cost function can be considered as a measure of the performance of a VQA with respect to the given training samples and the expected output, which helps to find the global minima. Without loss of generality, the cost function can be expressed as\nC(\u03b8) = f(O(U(\u03b8), \u03c1in)) (1)\nwhere O are a set of observables on the output state obtained by the input state \u03c1in under the action of the PQC U(\u03b8) with tunable parameters \u03b8, and f is some function, which is designed according to the specific problem. For example, the cost function of variational quantum eigensolver is often set as\n\u3008H\u3009O(U(\u03b8),\u03c1in), (2)\nwhich is expectation value of qubit Hamiltonian H . In addition, for quantum machine learning tasks, one can usually follow the cost functions commonly used in classical community, such as using mean squared error (MSE) or cross entropy as the cost function for the classification task.\nThe choice of cost function could affect the trainability of VQAs. Cerezo et al. proved that barren plateaus are costfunction-dependent in shallow PQCs [63]. Specifically, the cost function with global observables leads to an exponentially vanishing gradient (i.e., barren plateau), while the gradient vanishes polynomially when the cost function is defined\nin terms of local observables. Recently, Liu et al. found a similar phenomenon in tensor-network based machine learning [64]."

            "heading": "2. Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs)",
            "text": "PQCs are the main part that differentiates VQAs from classical neural networks. A PQC consists of a number of fixed quantum gates and trainable quantum gates, and may even includes some measurement and feedback operations. The trainable quantum gate is usually a single-qubit rotation, Rx(\u03b8), Ry(\u03b8), and Rz(\u03b8) rotations, and the trainable parameter is its rotation angle \u03b8. These trainable parameters are trained to minimize the cost function.\nThe structure of the variational ansatz plays an essential role in the performance of VQA, including the convergence speed and the closeness of the output to the optimal solution of the problem. The design of an effective structure is a challenge for VQAs, which requires optimization in many aspects, such as strong expressibility, shallow circuit depth, and small number of parameters. In the following, we will present some common ansatzes.\nProblem-inspired ansatzes. The problem-inspired ansatz is constructed by using knowledge about a specific problem.\nA typical example is the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) [65], whose ansatz is set as\nU(\u03b3,\u03b2) = \u220fp\nl=1 e\u2212i\u03b2lHM e\u2212i\u03b3lHC , (3)\nwhere HC is the problem Hamiltonian, HM = n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3ix is the mixing Hamiltonian, and \u03c3ix denotes the PauliX operator acting on qubit i. This ansatz is inspired by quantum annealing to map the initial state to the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian HC , by optimizing the parameters \u03b3 = (\u03b31, \u03b32, ..., \u03b3p) and \u03b2 = (\u03b21, \u03b22, ..., \u03b2p).\nThe problem-inspired ansatz is also widely used in quantum chemistry problems. The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) [66] ansatz is a commonly used structure for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). And historically, the first VQE experiment by Peruzzo et al. [67] utilized the UCC with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz. Subsequently, some improved ansatzes enable shallower depths and higher accuracy. Lee et al. proposed the unitary pair coupled cluster with generalized singles and doubles (k-UpCCGSD) method to reduce circuit depth [68]. The orbital optimized UCC (OO-UCC) ansatz [69] is another variant of UCC to reduce the number of parameters and circuit depth, while maintains a similar level of accuracy to that of UCCSD. Besides reducing circuit depth,\n4 Metcalf et al. employed the double unitary coupled-cluster (DUCC) method to effectively reduce the required number of qubits [70]. Here we only make a list of these ansatzes, more detailed introduction can be found in the Ref. [71].\nIn general, the problem-inspired ansatz is designed according to the characteristics of the problem, so that the output has a high accuracy. However, limited by the connectivity of quantum processors, implementing problem-inspired ansatz on real quantum devices may necessitate a relatively deep PQC, which might be a challenge.\nHardware-efficient ansatzes. Unlike the problem-inspired ansatz, the hardware-efficient ansatz [46] is designed around properties of quantum hardware, such as the qubit connectivity and restricted gate sets, to ensure efficient implementation on near-term quantum devices.\nThe trainable unitary operator U(\u03b8), represented by the PQC of this anstz, is composed of L layers and each layer merges trainable single-qubit gates with a entangling block. Mathematically, we have U(\u03b8) := \u220fL l=1(UEUl(\u03b8)), where Ul(\u03b8) is the l-th trainable layer and UE is the entanglement layer. In particular, we have Ul(\u03b8) = \u2297N i=1(US(\u03b8\n(i,l))), where \u03b8(i,l) represents the (i, l)-th entry of \u03b8 \u2208 RN\u00d7L, US is the trainable unitary with US \u2208 SU(2), e.g., the rotation single qubit gates Rx, Ry , and Rz . The entangle layer UE is constructed from the entanglement operations that the hardware can provide, such as CNOT, CZ gates, iSWAP gate, and even many-body quantum evolution. These entanglement operations should follow the connectivity of quantum hardware, such as one-dimensional chains, lattices, etc.\nVariable-structure ansatzes. Unlike the problem-inspired ansatz and hardware-efficient ansatz, which take a fixed structure, the circuit structure in the variable-structure ansatz is no longer fixed and trained as a parameter with the aim of further reducing the circuit depth and the number of gates. A typical example is ADAPT-VQE [72] and qubit-ADAPT-VQE [73], which are proposed to optimize the circuit structure of the ansatz to reduce the circuit depth in quantum chemistry applications. Zhu et al. also developed an adaptive QAOA for solving combinatorial problems [74]. Interested readers can refer to the Refs. [75\u201381] for other variants or optimizations, and we will not introduce them one by one."

            "text": "The procedure of parameter optimization is implemented after the cost function and ansatz are determined, to minimize the cost function. An appropriate optimizer should be determined by considering the requirements of the application. There are mainly two classes of optimization methods, gradient-based and gradient-free methods, which we will introduce below.\nGradient descent methods. Gradient descent is a generalpurpose optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of the given cost function. For this purpose, the gradient of a cost function C(\u03b8) with respect to its parameters \u03b8, i.e., \u2207\u03b8C(\u03b8), is calculated to obtain the direction of steepest descent. Then a small updates to the parameters is implemented\naccording to\n\u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7\u2207\u03b8C(\u03b8), (4)\nwhere \u03b7 is the step size, to iteratively approach the minimum value of the cost function.\nThe most commonly used gradient descent method for VQAs is parameter-shift rule [82\u201385]. As shown in Eq. 1, the cost functions are usually phrased in terms of expectation values of some observables O, evaluated on a output quantum state \u03c1out of the PQC U(\u03b8). In the case that \u03c1out depends on a parameter \u03b8i that parametrizes a Pauli-rotation gate e\u2212i\u03b8iP/2, where P is a Pauli operator, we can compute the derivative with respect to \u03b8i as\n\u2207\u03b8i\u3008O\u3009(\u03b8i) = 1\n2\n( \u3008O\u3009(\u03b8i + \u03c0\n2 )\u2212 \u3008O\u3009(\u03b8i \u2212\n\u03c0 2 ) ) . (5)\nThe original parameter-shift rule is design for singleparameter gates. Wierichs et al. then extended this method to be applicable to multi-parameter quantum gates [86].\nThe gradient descent methods can also be transformed into the quantum version [87\u201392]. The quantum versions of the gradient descent was firstly proposed by Rebentrost et al. for high-dimensional optimization problems [93]. The gradient algorithm in Ref. [93] involves phase estimation, which requires substantial circuit depth and is difficult to implement with current quantum hardwares. Instead of using phase estimation, Li et al. proposed an experimental friendly quantum gradient algorithm [87] using the linear combination of unitaries (LCU).\nIn addition to above methods, some other gradient descent methods have been proposed, such as quantum analytic descent [94] and stochastic gradient descent [85, 95, 96], etc.\nGradient-free methods. Similar to the classical machine learning, gradient-free optimization methods can also be used to optimize PQCs. The Nelder-Mead method is one of commonly used gradient-free optimization for finding a local minimum of a function of several variables, and thus is naturally suitable for VQAs as well. Besides, evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning can be also used to train VQAs [97\u2013101]. These optimization methods are standard in the classical machine learning community and we will not go into detail in this review."

This type of algorithms allows one to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian H , which may be used\n5 for simulating molecules and chemical reactions. According to the Rayliegh-Ritz variational principle [102\u2013104], the ground state energy E0 associated with this Hamiltonian H is bounded by\nE0 \u2264 \u3008\u03c8|H|\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8|\u03c8\u3009 , (6)\nwhere |\u03c8\u3009 is a trial quantum state. The original VQE is to find a quantum state approximating the ground state by training a PQC, such that the expected value of the Hamiltonian is constantly approaching the minimum. In addition to its original purpose, VQE has been widely extended to other objectives, such as finding excited states or the spectrum of Hamiltonian [105\u2013111], nonequilibrium steady state [112\u2013114], and calculating energy derivatives [115\u2013117]. Recently, Wei et al. propose a full quantum eigensolver (FQE) [118] which treats the gradient descent part in a full quantum mechanical manner.\nVQE has been demonstrated on various quantum architectures such as superconducting qubits [46, 47, 119\u2013125], photonic system [67, 126], and trapped ions [127\u2013129]. These experiments are still boil down to proof-of-principle demonstrations on small-molecule systems, and thus further experimental efforts are required to scale up this approach to larger molecular systems of chemical interest. Meanwhile, the algorithmic approaches also needs to be further developed to relax the hardware limitation, such as reducing the number of qubits [69, 73, 105, 130\u2013135] and circuit depth [73, 136\u2013140], error-mitigation techniques [141\u2013143], accelerated VQE [144], measurement-based VQE [145] and so on."

            "text": "Combinatorial optimization is a promising path to demonstrating practical quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices, most notably the QAOA [65, 146] for solving the combinatorial optimization problem MaxCut. Max-Cut is the NP-complete problem, which is defined to partition the nodes of a graph into two distinct sets A and B that maximizes the number of edges connecting nodes in opposite sets. It has been shown that to achieve an approximation ratio of r \u2265 16/17 \u2248 0.9412 for Max-Cut on all graphs is NPHard [147].\nMathematically, consider a graph with m edges and n vertices, we can use bitstring z = z1 . . . zn to represent the assignment of vertices to the two sets, where zi = 0 if i-th vertex is belongs to set A and zi = 1 if it belongs to the other set B. The objective is to maximize the number of edges cut, denoted as C(z). When implementing the QAOA to find approximate solutions to the MaxCut problem, we denote the bitstring using computational basis states |z\u3009, and define the objective function to maximize as\nC(z) = m\u2211 \u03b1=1 C\u03b1(z) = m\u2211 edge(j,k) 1 2 (1\u2212 \u03c3jz\u03c3kz )|z\u3009, (7)\nwhere (j, k) vertices connect the \u03b1 edge. C\u03b1 has the value 1 only if the j-th and k-th qubits have different measurement results on the Z basis, representing separate partitions. The p-layer QAOA parametered circuit is usually governed by the\nproblem Hamiltonian HC = m\u2211\nedge(j,k)\n1 2 (1\u2212 \u03c3 j z\u03c3 k z ) and a mix-\ning Hamiltonian HM = n\u2211 i=1 \u03c3ix alternatively in each layer, as\nU(\u03b3,\u03b2) = \u220fp\nl=1 e\u2212i\u03b2lHM e\u2212i\u03b3lHC , (8)\nwhere \u03b3 = (\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3p) and \u03b2 = (\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2p) are variational parameters. The input state of QAOA circuit is set as an n-qubit uniform superposition state |+\u3009n, and the final state \u03d5(\u03b3,\u03b2) = U(\u03b3,\u03b2)|+\u3009n is measured to output the bitstring z. We train the QAOA parametered circuit to evolve from the initial state into the bitstring z with the maximum partition.\nThere has been a lot of theoretical works discussing the performance of QAOA and evaluating the resources needed to achieve quantum computational supremacy [57, 148\u2013154]. In Ref. [149], Streif et al. presented a comparison between the QAOA with competing methods, quantum annealing and simulated annealing. Guerreschi et al. claimed that at least several hundreds of qubits are required for QAOA to achieve quantum speed-up [150]. Dalzell et al. concluded that 420 qubits QAOA would be sufficient for quantum computational supremacy [152]. Furthermore, it was proven that classical Goemans-Williamson algorithm outperforms the QAOA for certain instances of MaxCut at any constant level [155]. However, Bravyi et al. [153] and Egger et al. [154] suggested that higher-level Recursive-QAOA is competitive (and often better than) to best known generic classical algorithm based on rounding an SDP relaxation. Overall, whether QAOA has advantages over classical algorithms, and in which issues, is still a controversial issue that needs more research. Besides, to improve the performance of the QAOA, great efforts have been made, such as finding a good classical optimizer [151, 156\u2013159], ansatz design [74, 160\u2013162], reducing circuit depth [163, 164] and number of qubits [165, 166], and so on.\nIn terms of experimental progress, QAOA has been experimentally implemented in superconducting [56, 167], trappedion [168], and Rydberg atom [55] platform. In particular, in 2021, Harrigan et al. realized the QAOA with up to 23 qubits on the Google\u2019s Sycamore superconducting quantum processor [56]. Ebadi et al. experimentally investigated quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions [55]."

As quantum computing promises to enhance our capacity to do some crucial computational tasks, it is natural to look for linkages between\n6 these two cutting-edge techniques in the goal of gaining a variety of advantages. In fact, VQAs can be seen as quantum analogs of classical neural networks, and thus can easily be used for various machine learning tasks, such as classification and generative models.\nQCNN. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stand out from other neural networks for their outstanding capabilities in computer vision [169\u2013172], and natural language processing [173\u2013178]. A CNN usually consists of three main types of layers: 1) convolutional layer, 2) pooling layer, and 3) fully-connected layer, where convolutional layers use filters that perform convolution operations on the input, and pooling layers are a type of downsampling operation.\nInspired by CNNs, Cong et al. proposed a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), and showed its ability to solve quantum many-body problems [48]. In the QCNN architecture, the convolutional and pooling layers, as well as the fully-connected layer, are designed as quantum circuits, although their actual functions do not correspond exactly to the classical ones. The analysis by Pesah et al. implied that QCNNs do not exhibit barren plateaus [179], which are important for trainability as the system scales. The QCNN has been realized on a 7-qubit superconducting quantum processor to identify symmetry-protected topological phases of a spin model [180]. QCNN is more suitable for quantum problems, in contrast, the hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCCNN) [50] is specially proposed for realworld problems. The central idea of QCCNN is to implement the feature map in the convolutional layer with a PQC, while other layers remain the classical operation. Such a design not only introduces a quantum-enhanced feature map, but also preserves important features of classical CNN, such as nonlinearity and scalability. Numerical experiments on the Tetris dataset show that QCCNN can accomplish classification tasks with learning accuracy surpassing that of classical CNN with the same structure. Besides, Wei et al. proposed a QCNN framework based on LCU [181, 182] that can transform CNN to QCNN directly [183].\nQuantum GAN. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are at the forefront of the generative learning and have been widely used for image processing, video processing, and molecule development [184]. GANs exploit a two-player minimax game between a generator and a discriminator, where generator aims to output the generated data to fool discriminator, and meanwhile, discriminator tries to distinguish the true example from generator.\nRecently, theoretical works show that quantum generative models may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical counterparts [52, 185, 186], arousing extensive research interest in the theory and experiment of quantum GANs [54, 187\u2013 195]. In particular, Huang et al. developed a resource-efficient quantum GAN, and for the first time accomplished the generative task of real-world handwritten digit image on a superconducting quantum processor [53]. Being able to handle real-world data generation tasks is an exciting thing for an \u201cinfant\u201d quantum computer. Subsequently, Rudolph et al. provided an experimental implementation of generating more high-resolution images of handwritten digits with quan-\ntum GAN on an ion-trap quantum computer [54]. Niu et al. showed that by learning a shallow quantum circuit to generate a superposition of classical data, their proposed entangling quantum GAN can be used to create an approximate quantum random access memory (QRAM) [193].\nQuantum kernel estimation. Quantum Kernel estimation is a common method for supervised learning classification task on the NISQ device. In Ref. [196], Schuld et al. interpreted the process of encoding classical information into a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map which assigns data to the Hilbert space of the quantum system, and then proposed to use a variational quantum circuit to process the feature vectors. Havl\u0131\u0301c\u030cek et al. proposed and experimentally implemented binary classifiers that use the quantum state space as feature space on a superconducting processor [49], providing a possible path to quantum advantage.\nQuantum auto-encoder. Quantum auto-encoder (QAE) is an efficient VQA for quantum data compression. QAE starts from a large-scale quantum state \u03c1AB , utilizes a PQC U(\u03b8) to encode \u03c1AB into the A subsystem (latent space), and then recovers the initial state \u03c1AB from this compressed state with high fidelity via a decoder constructed by another PQC V (\u03b8\u2032). Usually V is set as V (\u03b8\u2032) = U(\u03b8)\u2020. QAE has recently attracted great attentions [197\u2013202], and its experimental implementations have been carried out on linear optical systems [203, 204] and superconducting systems [205]."

It works by reducing the factoring problem to the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, which can then be found using VQA.

Besides, the performance and resource analysis of VQF are presented in Refs. [208, 209].\nIn addition to the factoring task, VQAs can also be used to attack advanced encryption standard (AES)-like symmetric cryptography [210]. In their simulation results, sometimes the variational quantum attack algorithm is even faster than Grover\u2019s algorithm. Moreover, Coyle et al. proposed cryptanalysis algorithm based on variational quantum cloning (VarQlone), which allows an adversary to obtain optimal approximate cloning strategies for unknown quantum states with shallow quantum circuits [211].\n7"

Several classical-quantum hybrid algorithms derived from VQAs make it possible for near-term quantum devices to solve large-scale numerical problems without the use of fault-tolerant quantum computing.\nVariational quantum linear solver. Solving systems of linear equations is a fundamental computational problem, and the vast majority of numerical problems in science and engineering boil down to solving systems of linear equations. Unlike the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm [212], the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) proposed by BravoPrieto et al. can run on near-term quantum computers [213]. By employing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the goal of VQLS is to variationally prepare |x\u3009 such that A|x\u3009 \u221d |b\u3009. The numerical simulations give the evidence that the run time of VQLS has linear scaling in \u03ba, logarithmic scaling in 1/\u03b5, and polylogarithmic scaling in N , where \u03ba is the condition number of a N \u00d7 N matrix A, and \u03b5 is the precision of the solution.

Over the past few years, VQAs have received unprecedented attention, and papers related to VQAs appear on the arXiv website almost every day. The following points deserve our attention in advancing VQAs into future industrial applications or truly meaningful scientific research.\nWhere is the main advantage? Although VQAs have been hotly researched for several years, this core question has never been well answered. Perhaps using VQAs to handle quantum problems is a natural advantage [58], since either simulating quantum systems or measuring quantum systems using classical methods would be exponentially resourceintensive. However, for real-world problems, it becomes very tricky to answer why we need VQAs. Does it offer speed or accuracy advantages over classical neural networks? Maybe we can try to answer this question in two ways: 1) Find the provable advantages of VQAs theoretically. This should be difficult, since today\u2019s machine learning algorithms are still theoretically difficult to study; 2) Experimentally achieve milestones that beat current state-of-the-art classical machine learning in terms of speed or accuracy on large-scale practical datasets (rather than toy models). Either way, it will take a huge effort.\nI/O problems for real-world data. To fully exploit the superposition properties of quantum systems, we actually want the classical data to be encoded into the amplitude of quantum system. However, this is extremely resourceintensive, whether using QRAM [230] or pure quantum circuits [231, 232]. Thus, for real-world applications, perhaps we need to find some specfic classical problems suitable for quantum computing. For example, the input to this classical problem has a certain sparsity or symmetry, which is conducive to being encoded as a quantum state. For the output, in general we need to avoid the exponential consumption caused by a large number of measurements, which requires us to extract and analyze only part of the information of the output quantum state, such as the expected value of observables, principal component analysis [233], etc.\nTrainability and training efficiency. Avoiding barren plateaus is now an important area of research, as barren plateaus in training landscapes will appear if care is not taken enough. Some results suggest that the exponential parameter space, the noise and decoherence, and even entanglement can induce barren plateaus [234\u2013237]. At present, some methods have discussed how to mitigate barren plateaus [63, 238\u2013241], and more research is still needed.\nOne of the weaknesses of quantum computers compared to classical computers is quantum noise, which also greatly affects the training performance. Generally, the resillience of VQAs exists for a wide class of noise, as analyzed in Refs. [62, 242, 243]. Yet such noise resillience is highly limited as the noise level rising. As suggested in Refs. [235, 244\u2013 247], large noise may leads to problems such as performance degradation or barren plateaus. Some special noises, such as\n8 leakage error, also have a bad effect on the performance of VQAs [248]. Thus, the analysis of iteration complexity and behaviour with noise is necessary [237], and efficient error mitigation schemes for VQAs need to be developed [249\u2013 252].\nBesides, the training process of VQA is very timeconsuming, due to the incompatibility with backpropagation and the cost of a large number of measurements, posing a great challenge to the large-scale development of VQAs. Some approaches try to use multiple QPUs for parallel training to alleviate this deficiency, such as data parallelism [253] or parameter parallelism [254]. However, more fundamental solutions are urgently needed.\nHardware development. For practical NISQ applications, high-quality quantum processors with more qubits, longer coherence times and lower error rates are prerequisites. For VQAs, iterative training requires frequent interaction between classical and quantum computers, which imposes some new demands on the quantum hardware. The cryogenic electronic control architecture is a hardware-level solution for accelerating classical-quantum interactions [255\u2013259], and also an advanced technique required for the future development of quantum computing."

Instead of active error-correction, QEM methods usually estimate the error-free expectation value by classical post-processing of the noisy measurement results.

Since the inverse noise channel E\u22121 may be unphysical, we need a set of basis operations {Bk}k to decompose it as\nE\u22121 = \u2211 k qkBk, (9)\nwhere qk is the the combination coefficients, i.e., quasiprobabilities. So we can estimate the noiseless expectation value of the observableO using a linear combination of results obtained from circuits applied by different basis operations\n\u3008O\u3009PEC = \u2211 k qkTr[Bk \u25e6 E \u25e6 U(\u03c1)]\n=QE \u2211 k sgn(qk) |qk| QE Tr[Bk \u25e6 E \u25e6 U(\u03c1)], (10)\nwhere QE = \u2211 k |qk|.

Then we multiply the measurement outcome by the corresponding sgn(qk) and weight the Monte Carlo average by QE .

Verification methods are designed for systems with certain symmetries and combined with classical post-processing. Quantum subspace expansion also uses post-processing to mitigate errors for some VQE algorithms. Other mitigation methods for certain noise types, such as measurement error mitigation (for measurement errors) are also widely applied.\nSampling overhead. Note that the total resource overhead for PEC involves both the characterization cost of the noise channel, and the sampling overhead to estimate the linear combinations in Eq 10. Considering that the gate noise characterization is usually performed during the device calibration stage [268], we here focus on the sampling overhead for the implementation of PEC.\nAs for the factor QE multiplied with the averaged expectation value, the variance is increased by Q2E = ( \u220fN n=1Qn)\n2. Therefore, it needs Q2E times more samples to achieve the same measurement accuracy as the unmitigated case. The square of the multiplier Q2E can be regarded as the sampling overhead \u03a5PEC for PEC, which grows exponentially with the overall gate error \u03b5N if we assume Qn = 1 + O(\u03b5) for stochastic noise process [141]. This sets limitations on the\nefficiency of PEC schemes to \u03b5N = O(1). Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the sample complexity for implementing PEC has been explored [269, 270] and it has been shown the optimality of PEC among all strategies in mitigating a certain type of noise [270].\nApproaches to extract error parameters. To implement the PEC in practice, we need to accurately characterize the noise model E and obtain the analytical decomposition of the inverse noise map as Eq. 9 shown.\nGate set tomography. Endo et al. [141] has introduced gate set tomography (GST) [271, 272] to PEC, which is free from the SPAM errors. Although GST can reconstruct arbitrary noise process, the number of samples required for its reconstruction grows exponentially with the size of the system Nq and is quite costly. If only specific types of noise are considered, there are some more efficient characterization proto-\n10\ncols [273\u2013275]. Cycle error reconstruction for Pauli noise. Cycle error reconstruction (CER) is an efficient approach to identify the Pauli noise in circuits [276, 277]. It utilizes Cycle Benchmarking [278] to characterize the Pauli noise channel and extract the Pauli error rates after post-processing. The implementation of PEC with CER has been shown on a 4-qubit superconducting processor [279]. Under the Pauli noise assumption, the quasi-probability decomposition can be further simplified using sparse Pauli-Lindblad models [280]. The sparse Pauli noise model considers Pauli operators with only one or two non-trivial terms, but is sufficient to capture the correlated errors. Moreover, the number of noise parameters in the sparse model scales polynomially with the system size, so it remains efficient in large-scale quantum systems. This approach has been experimentally demonstrated to learn the noise model on a superconducting quantum processor of up to 20 qubits [280]."

The chosen fitting method is essential to the performance of ZNE. A basic fitting method is the Richardson extrapolation, which utilizes the polynomial relationship between noisy and ideal expectation values yielded by Tailor expansion when the error rate is low. This estimation is slightly coarse. More refined models, such as exponential and poly-exponential fitting functions, can be introduced in the extrapolation method to improve the actual mitigation performance in specific cases. We discuss these fitting methods in detail.\nRichardson extrapolation. Richardson extrapolation was the first introduced extrapolation method [263, 264] and later experimentally demonstrated using superconducting qubits [120].\nSuppose the quantum circuit outputs a noisy Nq-qubit quantum state \u03c1\u03b5, where \u03b5 denotes the noise parameter which characterizes the error rate in the circuit. Then the expectation value of the target observable O under error rate \u03b5 can be regarded as a function towards \u03b5: \u3008O\u3009(\u03b5) = Tr(\u03c1\u03b5O). In order to evaluate the error-free expectation value \u3008O\u3009(0), we choose a set of error rates {\u03bb0\u03b5, ..., \u03bbn\u03b5} with n + 1 different coefficients {\u03bbi}i=0,...,n(\u03bb0 = 1) , and then run circuits under these error rates to obtain the set of n + 1 expectation values {\u3008O\u3009(\u03bbi\u03b5)}i. It is known to be difficult to reduce the error rate in the circuit, we thus usually boost it with amplified coefficients 1 = \u03bb0 < \u03bb1 < ... < \u03bbn using some noise scaling methods. Linear spacing of the amplified coefficients (e.g. {\u03bbi = i + 1}i=0,...,n) is commonly used [264, 268] and some specific spacing methods have been explored for better performance [286].\nThe expectation value for \u03bb = 0 (the error-free case) can be estimated using\n\u3008O\u3009Rid = n\u2211 i=0 \u03b3i\u3008O\u3009(\u03bbi\u03b5), (16)\nwhere the fitting coefficients {\u03b3i} are chosen to satisfy both\u2211n i=0 \u03b3i = 1 and \u2211n i=0 \u03b3i\u03bb j i = 0 for j = 1, ..., n, and the\n11\nsolution gives\n\u03b3i = \u220f i 6=j \u03bbj \u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbi .

However, the assumption of a valid Taylor expansion for low error rate may be inaccurate in the large circuit limit, and the lack of specific information on the noise channel sets limitation to the efficacy of Richardson extrapolation.\nAs for the sampling overhead of Richardson extrapolation, we need to take into account the variance increase introduced in Eq. 16, which reads [142]\nVar(\u3008O\u3009Rid) = n\u2211 i=0 \u03b32i Var(\u3008O\u3009\u03bbi\u03b5). (19)\nThe variance of estimating \u3008O\u3009Rid is about \u2211n i=0 \u03b3 2 i larger than evaluating \u3008O\u3009 without error mitigation, so it requires around \u03a5Rid = \u2211n i=0 \u03b3 2 i more samples as the sampling overhead of Richardson extrapolation. Besides, an optimized protocol [286] for the implementation of Richardson extrapolation has been proposed to further explore the relevant parameters of Richardson extrapolation.\nExponential Extrapolation. The error rate \u03b5 used in Richardson extrapolation quantifies the local noise strength, but in the context of NISQ error mitigation, it is more natural to consider the mean circuit error count [262] \u00b5, where \u00b5 \u2248 N\u03b5 and N denotes the number of gates in the circuit. In the large circuit limit when N 1, the number of errors happened in the circuit (denoted by k) follows the Poisson distribution with probability [262]\npk = e \u2212\u00b5\u00b5\nk\nk! . (20)\nDenoting the expectation value with k errors occurred as \u3008Ok\u3009, the expectation value with mean circuit error count \u00b5 is\n\u3008O\u00b5\u3009 = \u221e\u2211 k=0 pk\u3008Ok\u3009 = e\u2212\u00b5 \u221e\u2211 k=0 \u00b5k k! \u3008Ok\u3009, (21)\nwhere the factor e\u2212\u00b5 implies an exponential decay with \u00b5 of the expectation value. By simply assuming an exponential function\n\u3008O\u3009(\u00b5) = e\u2212f\u00b5\u3008O\u3009(0) (22)\nwith a parameter f which denotes the observable decay rate, we can then obtain an two-points exponential extrapolation result with mean circuit error count \u00b5 and \u03bb\u00b5 (\u03bb > 1)\n\u3008O\u3009exp = ( \u3008O\u3009\u03bb(\u00b5) \u3008O\u3009(\u03bb\u00b5) ) 1 \u03bb\u22121 , (23)\nEndo et al. [141] first considered the exponential decay curve for error extrapolation, where the advantage of exponential extrapolation over Richardson extrapolation has been numerically demonstrated [141, 284]. And Cai [262] provided a general multi-exponential extrapolation framework\n\u3008O\u3009(\u00b5) = \u2211 i=1 Ai(e \u2212fi)\u00b5, and \u2211 i=1 Ai = \u3008O\u3009(0), (24)\nwhich achieves a much lower estimation bias in numerical simulation.\nPoly-exponential extrapolation. The poly-exponential extrapolation [284, 287] assumes a more general model that the exponential decay with the mean circuit error count \u00b5 has a polynomial expansion which can be fitted to the function\n\u3008O\u3009(\u00b5) = e \u2211 i=0 fi\u00b5 i \u3008O\u3009(0). (25)\nThen the single-exponential extrapolation modeled by Eq. 22 is a particular case of the more general poly-exponential extrapolation.\nNoise scaling methods. The implementation of ZNE, especially Richardson extrapolation, depends non-trivially on the ability to boost the error rate \u03b5 in the circuit by different amplified coefficients{\u03bbi}i [286]. Next we will introduce a variety of methods to amplify the error rate in a controlled manner.\nIdentity insertion [141, 288] is a hardware-agnostic approach which replaces a particular gate or layer C by C{C\u2020C}n for non-negative integer n. The circuit after insertion is logically equivalent to the original circuit but the error rate is amplified by a factor 2n + 1 as the circuit depth increases. There are many variant identity insertion methods proposed [289, 290] for ZNE, which explore the trade-off between the inserted gate number and the required measurement to achieve the same (or higher) accuracy. And more general approaches using unitary folding can obtain an arbitrary real scaling factor [284]. The limitation of identify insertion method is that the amplified error rate may arbitrarily deviate from the desired one [291]. Given a self-adjoint noisy gate U\u0303 = E \u25e6 U , after identity insertion of U\u0303\u2020U\u0303 = U\u0303 U\u0303 we have U\u0303 U\u0303\u2020U\u0303 = E(UEU)E \u25e6U = E\u0303 \u25e6U . The actually amplified noise E\u0303 = E(UEU)E is gate-dependent for general noise channel E , leading to an unpredictable amplified error rate in the circuit.\nStretching the control pulses in time [120, 264, 291] is also used to implement circuits under different error rate. Given an\n12\nopen quantum system described by the time-dependent multiqubit Hamiltonian H(t), the time evolution is\n\u2202 \u2202t \u03c1\u03b5(t) = \u2212i[H(t), \u03c1\u03b5(t)] + \u03b5L(\u03c1\u03b5(t)), (26)\nwhere \u03b5 refers to the error rate in the system, and the noise term L is a Lindblad operator. Then we rescale the Hamiltonian H(t) to 1\u03bbH( t \u03bb ) with a stretched factor \u03bb > 1 and obtain a new state \u03c1\u2032\u03b5(t). Under the assumption that the generator L is invariant after time rescaling, and also independent from the way the Hamiltonian H(t) is encoded, we can increase the evolution time by a factor \u03bb. Then the error rate is boosted from \u03b5 to \u03bb\u03b5 according to \u03c1\u2032\u03b5(ct) = \u03c1\u03bb\u03b5(t). This method has been experimentally demonstrated on superconducting processors [120, 291] using up to 26 qubits [291].\nNote that two methods above do not require the exact form of the noise channel, and there are some approaches that utilize the specific structure of certain noise models. Parameter noise scaling [284] is designed for the pulse error caused by imperfect control or finite precision of the physical parameters in the parametric quantum gates. Considering a quantum gate G(~\u03b8) = exp(\u2212i \u2211k j=1 \u03b8jHj) which is parameterized by k classical control parameters ~\u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82, ..., \u03b8k) with Hamiltonian operators H1, H2, ...,Hk, the actually implemented gate suffered from pulse error is modeled by G(~\u03b8\u2032) with\n\u03b8 \u2032\nj = \u03b8j + \u03b5\u0302j , for j = 1, 2, ..., k, (27)\nwhere \u03b5\u0302 is a random variable following Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance \u03c32j which denotes the effect of the stochastic calibration noise. Given the value of variance \u03c32j , we can rescale the noise by a factor \u03bb > 1 using\n\u03b8rej = \u03b8j + \u03b4\u0302j , (28)\nhere the \u03b4\u0302j is sampled from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance (\u03bb \u2212 1)\u03c32j . Therefore, the effective parameter after rescaling is\n\u03b8 \u2032 j = \u03b8j + \u221a \u03bb\u03b5\u0302j , for j = 1, 2, ..., k, (29)\nwhich achieves a noise rescaling by a factor \u03bb without knowledge of the Hamiltonian operators Hj .\nPauli twirling techniques [292, 293] focus on the cases that error rates of single-qubit gates are much lower than those of two-qubit gates and measurement. By applying randomly chosen Pauli gates before and after the Clifford two-qubit gates, arbitrary noise channel can be converted into an effective stochastic Pauli channel [276, 277]. Then we can use additional Pauli gates to tune the practical error rate to any target value [263], but it requires the full knowledge of the exact Pauli noise channel. We can also combine efficient Pauli error reconstruction methods such as Cycle Error Reconstruction [277, 278] to amplify the error rate for ZNE [279].\nGate Trotterization [294] is a local noise scaling technique acting at the level of individual gates. We can replace each gate U of the circuit with the product of \u03bb equal gates using the gate Trotterization technique\nU \u2192 (U 1\u03bb )\u03bb, \u03bb = 0, 1, 2... . (30)\nHowever, the way the U 1 \u03bb is compiled by the hardware depends on \u03bb, so the circuit depth may not increase by the expected factor.\nLeveraging other error mitigation schemes as a noise scaling tool has also been explored for ZNE [262, 295]. Different from above tuning approaches which produces boosted error rate, we can also utilize other error mitigation methods such as PEC to reduce the error rate [262]."

Specifically, the learningbased error mitigation methods estimate the observable\u2019s expectation value of the targeted circuit using an ansatz that typically describes the relationship between the noisy and noiseless case of the expectation value. The training set fed into the\n13\nansatz comes from classically simulable quantum circuits, or measurement results from relevant quantum circuits.\nClifford data regression [297] generates training data set {Onoisyi , Oideali }i composed of the noisy expectation value Onoisyi from real quantum devices and the noiseless expectation value Oideali simulated on the classical computers. To enable efficient classical simulation, the quantum circuits for generating training set are replaced with near-Clifford circuits generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method. We can fit the training data set to a linear ansatz\nOideal = f(Onoisy, ~\u03b8) = \u03b81O noisy + \u03b82, (33)\nwhere the parameters ~\u03b8 = (\u03b81, \u03b82) are optimized by minimizing the cost function\nC = \u2211 i ( Oideali \u2212 (\u03b81O noisy i + \u03b82) )2 . (34)\nCDR has been experimentally demonstrated on a 16- qubit IBMQ quantum computer and can achieve an orderof-magnitude improvement for a ground state energy problem [297], and it also been shown to has the potential to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches [283]. CDR can be further improved by more efficient training set construction methods and by applying symmetries in certain quantum systems [305].\nLearning-based probabilistic error cancellation [298] does not depend on the full tomography of the noise channel as the original PEC does. For a L-layer quantum circuit consisting of single-qubit unitary gates R = (R1, R2..., RNq(L+1)) and multi-qubits Clifford gate layers U = (U1, U2, ..., UL), the learning-based PEC applies the Pauli gates P = (P1, P2, ..., P2Nq(L+1)) as the error mitigating gates before and after each single-qubit unitary gates. It can then establish a circuit configuration where the multiqubit Clifford gates are fixed, the other gates (R and P) are served as variables, and P = I indicates that all error mitigating gates are identity gates. Here we denote the noisy and error-free expectation value by f(R,P) and f ef(R,P). According to the PEC, the error-mitigated expectation value f em(R, I) is\nf em(R, I) = \u2211 R q(P)f(R,P), (35)\nwhere q(P) is the the combination coefficients, i.e., quasiprobabilities. By minimizing the cost function,\nC(R) = 1 |S| \u2211 R\u2208S |f em(R, I)\u2212 f ef(R, I)|2, (36)\nwhere a subset of single-qubit Clifford gates S is chosen as the training set so that the error-free expectation value f ef(R, I) can be efficiently simulated, we can obtain a optimal distribution q(P) for the training set S which can also be applied for the non-Clifford single-qubit gates. This scheme requires that all the single-qubit gates in the configuration are error-free and\ndo not rely on the exact error model of the multi-qubit Clifford gates. For practical reasons, since the spaces of R and P grow exponentially with the system size Nq , we need to truncate the spaces of the training set and error mitigating gates, or resort to variational optimization approaches [298].\nDeep learning method [299, 300, 306] trains a deep neural network to model a noise channel utilizing the \u201dblack box\u201d nature of the neural network. The training of the neural network requires the measurement results with both noise and ideal cases. However, since classical simulations may not be possible for large-scale non-Clifford quantum circuits, the training set can only consist of measurement results of specific quantum circuits whose ideal measurement outcomes are known [299, 306]."

            "text": "Under the assumption of a classical noise model, MEM is usually applied via classical post-processing, where measurement error is modeled by a stochastic and invertible response matrix \u039b [307\u2013309].\nClassical noise models. The ideal quantum measurement in the computational basis can be written in terms of positive operator valued measurement (POVM). For a n-qubit system \u03c1, suppose the POVM operator is \u03a0x = |x\u3009\u3008x| satisfying \u03a0x \u2265 0 for \u2200x and \u2211 x\u03a0x = I, where x \u2208 Z Nq 2 refers to the POVM outcome. The probability distribution of the measurement outcome is represented by a vector ~p, where the x term of ~p is the probability of obtaining the outcome x, given by p(x|\u03c1) = Tr(\u03c1\u03a0x) according to the Born\u2019s rule.\nIf the POVM elements have no non-trivial off-diagonal terms, we can treat the measurement noise channel as a classical noise channel, where the transformation between ideal and noisy measurement probability distributions can be written using a response matrix \u039b:\n~pideal = \u039b \u22121~pnoisy. (37)\nHere we use ~pideal and ~pnoisy to represent the ideal and noisy probability distributions. And the element \u039bx,y of the response matrix \u039b is defined as\n\u039bx,y = \u3008x|\u03c1|y\u3009, x,y \u2208 Z Nq 2 , (38)\nwhich can be estimated directly by preparing the computational state and measuring it in the computational bases, or by using some tomographic means, such as quantum detector tomography (QDT) [307, 310, 311]. The main idea of QDT is to estimate an unknown set of fixed noisy POVM operators {\u03a0\u0302x}x with a set of well-known states {\u03c1i}i. Once the\n14\nnoisy POVM operators are reconstructed, we can extract the response matrix elements using\n\u03a0\u0302x = \u2211 y \u039bx,y\u03a0y, \u2200x, (39)\nwhere \u03a0y denotes the error-free POVM operator. In practice, however, for non-classical noise, the estimated measurement probability distribution obtained from ~pest = \u039b\u22121~pnoisy may be unphysical due to the negative terms of the vector ~pest. Moreover, the statistical uncertainties in the response matirx can be amplified through simply inversion, similar to the challenges faced in high-energy physics. Unfolding methods are thus introduced to readout error mitigation [312, 313], which show robustness to some failure cases of matrix inversion and least-squares.\nSimplified classical models. Dealing with the full response matrix of size 2Nq \u00d7 2Nq is not scalable beyond hundreds of qubits. Therefore, in order to avoid the exponential consumption of measurements, many scalable approaches [308, 314\u2013 316] have been proposed to simplify the response matrix model.\nTensor Product Noise (TPN) model. The simplest model assumes that the noise acts independently on each qubit and is called the Tensor Product Noise (TPN) model [308, 317, 318]. After such a simplification, the response matrix can be described in terms of the tensor product of Nq single-qubit response matrix as\n\u039bTPN = Nq\u220f i=1 ( 1\u2212 pi qi pi 1\u2212 qi ) , (40)\nwhere pi and qi denote the single-qubit readout error probability of 1 \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 1, respectively. We can see that the number of measurements required to construct the TPN response matrix is reduced fromO(2Nq ) toO(Nq). However, in the TPN model, the multi-qubit readout error correlations are neglected.\nContinuous Time Markov Processes (CPTP) noise model. Bravyi et al. [308] have extended the TPN model to the CTMP noise model, which takes the correlated errors into account. It defines a matrix exponential \u039b = eG to describe the response\nmatrix, and the generatorG = \u22112N2q i=1 riGi models the readout error. Here ri \u2265 0 refers to error rate and Gi represents the single-qubit or two-qubit readout error. For example, the generator describing falsely measuring |00\u3009 to |11\u3009 on two qubits is |11\u3009\u300800| \u2212 |00\u3009\u300800|. The MEM with the CPTP model has been experimentally demonstrated on the superconducting device [308].\nSubspace Reduction. When the measured probability distribution only contains a few principal bit strings with high probability, we can mitigate readout errors in a renormalized subspace defined by the observed probability distribution [314, 318]. The subspace reduction of the full 2Nq dimensional response matrix efficiently circumvents the original exponential overhead and avoids matrix inversion by using the matrix-free iterative methods [314].\nReadout symmetrizing. Due to the observation that mismeasuring |1\u3009 to |0\u3009 is more frequent than |0\u3009 to |1\u3009, Several\nstudies symmetrizing the readout with targeted Pauli X\u0302 gates are proposed [56, 319\u2013321].\nReadout balancing. We can exploit the readout asymmetry in the practical cases, which aims to rebalance the measurement outcomes by minimizing the expected number of qubits in the |1\u3009 state [319].\nBit-flip averaging. Bit-flip averaging [320] reduces the calibration overhead by an exponential factor without making any specific assumptions about the classical noise model for MEM. It applies Pauli X\u0302 gates on the randomly chosen qubits before measurements and offsets the effect of X\u0302 gates using classical post-processing. This leads to a symmetrized effective response matrix \u039b\u0302 which contains only O(2Nq ) free parameters compared toO(22Nq ) in the full matrix. Another independent work [321] utilizes the same bit-flipping protocol. It transforms the bias between the ideal and noisy expectation value to a multiplicative factor, and eliminates it by deviding the noisy expectation by an estimated factor obtained in the calibration procedure."

Fitting the difference between two specific measurement statistics to the Fourier series can effectively detect the presence of quantum noise [322].

(45)\nHere we denote the probability of measuring the ancilla qubit in the |0\u3009 state by P0.\nThe VD (or ESD) scheme is subject to some limitations. First, the coherent dismatch between the target pure state |\u03c80\u3009\u3008\u03c80| and the dominant eigenvector |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8| of the noisy state contributes to a noise floor regardless of the increasing of M . Second, the increased overhead of qubits and controlled gates with large M is hard to afford for the NISQ devices. Taking these limitations into account, many alternative protocols have been explored."

The QSE effectively mitigates coherent errors due to the imperfect variational optimization. Given a noisy ground state \u03c1 prepared on the quantum device and the target Hamiltonian H , we consider a variational subspace spanned by \u03c1, as\n{\u03c1sub = M\u2211\ni,j=1\ncic \u2217 jPi\u03c1Pj |ci \u2208 C, Pi \u2208 {I,X, Y, Z}\u2297Nq\nand Tr(\u03c1sub) = 1}, (48)\nwhere the parameters ~c = (c1, ..., cM ) denote the expansion coefficients and M refers to the number of expansion terms.

(51)\nNote that the efficiency of the QSE method depends on the number of expansion terms M , thus it may not effective in suppressing stochastic errors due to the requirement on exponential expansion terms to project the noisy state to the errorfree subspace [105, 142, 337]. While when combined with certain properties of the target state such as symmetry [340], the QSE can handle stochastic errors more efficiently because\nthe complexity of constructing the projection subspace is reduced. Beside, a generalised framework of QSE [337] has extended the expansion operators from Pauli operators to more general operators relevant to the noisy state.\nF. Verification methods\nVerification methods [338, 340, 341] exploit the knowledge of inherent symmetry within the quantum system, such as the spin symmetry in quantum many-body physics. This methods focus on the errors that place state outside the symmetry-preserving subspace.\nThe symmetry commonly used is Pauli symmetry S\u0302, which can be effectively estimated. Suppose the Pauli symmetry of\nthe system with size n is S\u0302 = M\u220f i=1 S\u0302i, S\u0302i \u2208 P\u2297Nq , where M is the number of non-trivial terms in S\u0302, and Pn refers to the n-qubit Pauli group. The verification of the symmetry can be achieved by dropping the circuit runs which fail the verification or by using the post-processing appraoches, as we will discuss below.\n1. Symmetry verification\nSymmetry verification [338, 340] discards the circuit runs failed to pass the verification, which costs additional measurement overhead. It utilizes an ancilla qubit interacting with each qubit in the system register, which is of the form shown in Fig. 5(a). The gates {Bi}i=1,2 are the basis transformation gates that map the eigenstate of symmetry S\u0302 with eigenvalue s to |0\u3009 state. If the ancilla qubit reads 1, we discard this circuit run. Note that the circuit can only detect odd number of error(s). In the low-cost version [340] of symmetry verification shown in Fig. 5(b), it shuffles the ancilla qubit along the system register, which needs only local CNOT and SWAP two-qubits gates.\nBoth cases require O(M) circuit depth to ensure the entanglement between the ancilla qubit and each register qubit individually, which is general intractable in quantum circuit. Moreover, the verification circuit applied on the noisy state may introduce extra errors, which reduces the reliability of verification. An alternative way to perform symmetry verification will be detailed below.\n17"

The code space projection method [329, 351] decodes errors on logical qubits via postprocessing, without additional qubits and operations for syndrome measurements.

Similarly, in the field of quantum computation, quantum circuit compilation (QCC) is used to transform a quantum algorithm always in a mathematical form into its corresponding quantum circuit which can be executed on a real quantum device.\nUsually, QCC includes three stages as follows (see Fig. 6).\n1. Decomposion (also referred to as the synthesis). Usually, a mathematically designed quantum algorithm can be represented by several n-qubit unitary operators, such as the Grover iteration in Grover\u2019s algorithm, the controlled exponentiation in Shor\u2019s algorithm, the Hamiltonian simulation in HHL algorithm and so on. However, real quantum devices, especially NISQ devices, usually provide only some elementary quantum gates, such as single-qubit gates and CNOT gates. Thus, it is one of the most fundamental problems that how to decompose a specific quantum algorithm or unitary operator into as few the provided elementary quantum gates as possible for implementation.\n2. Optimization. Despite the rapid development of quantum hardware, the qubit lifetime of some quantum systems is still not satisfactory and the quantum noise is also inevitable [7, 364]. The optimization aims to further reduce the depth and size of quantum circuits with the help of auxiliary qubits after the decomposition process to alleviate the problem of short qubit lifetime. Thus, the optimization seems like a kind of spacetime trade-off, i.e., using ancillary qubits (space) to efficiently reduce circuit size or depth (time).\n3. Mapping (also referred to as the qubit routing, qubit allocation, quantum circuit transformation). The final stage is to transform the logical quantum circuit to the physical quantum circuit which can be operated on a real quantum device. Actually after decomposition and optimization, there are only elementary quantum gates in the logical circuit, and the size and depth of which are sufficiently optimized. For the quantum hardware with fully-connected architecture, any logical circuit can be\ndirectly implemented. However, for the quantum hardware with limited connectivity architecture [7, 364], we should find the correspondence between logical qubits and physical qubits to complete the transformation.\nAlthough QCC has been separated into the above three stages, sometimes there is no exact order or boundaries. Alternatively, one can perform all the three stages simultaneously to complete the QCC, such as the works in Refs. [365\u2013367]. QCC is extremely important as a bridge between quantum algorithms and quantum hardware devices, especially for NISQ devices.

Soon, this upper bound was lowered to O(n4n) by Knill [369]. Nine years later, the upper bound for the exact decomposition of n-qubit unitary operator has been improved to O(4n) [370], which coincides with the theoretical lower bound [371]. In 2004, Mo\u0308tto\u0308nen et al. came up with Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD), i.e.,\nF ln(Ra) =  Ra(\u03b11) . . . Ra(\u03b12n\u22121)  .

In 2004 Shende et al. raised the lower bound to 14 (4\nn\u22123n\u22121) by the technique of parameter counting [371], which also implies a depth lower bound of \u2126(4n/n).\nWe can see that there is a gap on the optimal depth within the range of [\u2126(4n/n), O(4n)] for general n-qubit circuit optimization without ancillary qubits. Most recently, based on Gray code and unary encoding [376], Sun et al. have proved a fact that any n-qubit unitary operator can be implemented by a quantum circuit of size\nO(4n) (63)\n20\nand depth\nO ( n2n + 4n\nm+ n\n) (64)\nwith m \u2264 2n ancillary qubits [377].

Namely, they presented that any n-qubit unitary operator U can be decomposed as U = V nn (0) \u00b7 \u220f2n\u22121\u22121 i=1 V n n\u2212\u03b6(i)(i) \u00b7 V n n (2 n\u22121), where \u03b6(n)\n21\nis the Ruler function defined as \u03b6(n) = max{k : 2k\u22121|n}, V nk denotes an n-qubit uniformly controlled gate whose index of target qubit is k, and different i in V nk (i) denote different forms of n-qubit uniformly controlled gates despite the same target qubit k. Combined with their implementation of any n-qubit uniformly controlled gate, i.e., any n-qubit V nk (i) can be implemented by a circuit of size O(2n) and depth O ( n+ 2 n\nn+m\n) , they derived the above result. What we should\nnote is that their size and depth are simultaneously optimized to asymptotically optimal based on the lower bound in [371]. In specific without any ancillary qubits, the depth can be optimized to O(4n/n), which is exactly the lower bound.\nBesides the most general decomposition on n-qubit unitary, there have already been some results about the special cases. When the elements of unitary belong to the ring Z[ 1\u221a\n2 , i], the\nsingle-qubit unitary can be constructed using H and T gates only [378], in which the similar n-qubit case was conjectured to be implemented by the Clifford and T gates. This conjecture has been proved soon afterwards. An n-qubit unitary operator has an exact representation over the Clifford+T gate set assisted by only one ancilla if and only if its entries are in the ring Z[ 1\u221a\n2 , i], and the total gate count is O(32nnk), where k\nis the denominator exponent of the unitary [379]. Besides the above results on exact decomposition of unitary, there have already been some works on approximate decomposition. Based on Solovay-Kitaev theorem, Dawson and Nielsen designed an approximate algorithm, which runs in O(log2.71 1 ) time and produces as output a sequence ofO(log3.97 1 ) quantum gates including only Hadamard, controlled-not, and \u03c0/8 gates [380]."

            "text": "As seen in the rapid development of quantum hardware, the number of physical qubits may increase much faster than the qubit lifetime. Thus, when optimizing quantum circuits, we can consider how to reduce the circuit depth using auxiliary qubits.\nIn 2000, Cleve showed the quantum Fourier transform can be approximated to the depth of O(log n+ log log(1/ )) with sufficient ancillary qubits [381]. Next in 2001, Moore et al. proved that a circuit of any size on n qubits composed entirely of CNOT gates (CNOT circuit) can be parallelized to O(log n) depth with O(n2) ancilla qubits [382]. Similarly for the circuit of controlled-Pauli and H gate, they derived the same result. And for the Clifford+T circuit, Selinger in 2013 made use of four ancillary qubits to represent Toffoli gate with a T-depth of 1 and a total depth of 7 [383]. Amy et al. described an algorithm to reduce the T -depth for Clifford+T circuit [384], and it has worst case runtime of cubic in the number of T gates, qubits and Hadamard gates. Next let us turn our eyes back to the optimization of CNOT circuit because of its significance in quantum computation [368, 410]. In 2020, Jiang et al. established an asymptotically optimal space-depth tradeoff for the design of CNOT circuits, that is,\nany n-qubit CNOT circuit can be parallelized to\nO(max{log n, n 2\n(n+m) log(n+m) })\ndepth with m ancillary qubits, where m being any natural number [385]. Firstly, any n-qubit CNOT circuit can be regarded as an invertible matrix M over the finite field Fn\u00d7n2 . Take a three-qubit CNOT circuit shown in Fig. 7 as an example, the left circuit can be represented as the right matrix. Based on the above representation, the CNOT circuit opti-\nmization problem will be transformed into a corresponding parallel Gaussian elimination problem mathematically. Combined with a standard technique in reversible computation, they firstly constructed two CNOT circuits C1, C2 with 2n and 3sn qubits respectively, where 1 \u2264 s \u2264 O(n/ log2 n). Specifically, for x, j \u2208 Fn2 ,\nC1|x\u3009|j\u3009|0\u3009\u22973sn = |x\u3009|j\u2295Mx\u3009|0\u3009\u22973sn,\nC2|x\u3009|j\u3009|0\u3009\u22973sn = |x\u3009|j\u2295M\u22121x\u3009|0\u3009\u22973sn.\nThen they applied C1, C2 to transform the initial state |x\u3009|0\u3009\u2297n|0\u3009\u22973sn to the final state |Mx\u3009 after permuting the first and second n qubits. This boun d is tight and this algorithm can be directly extended to stabilizer circuits with the reason that any stabilizer circuit has a canonical form \u201cH-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C\u201d, where H and P are one layer of Hadamard gates and Phase gates respectively [411].\nNear-term quantum devices are limited not only by the qubit lifetime, but also by the connectivity between qubits. All the above optimization results focus on the optimal depth, without considering the constraints on connectivity. Thus, it is necessary to consider the quantum circuit optimization problem for the quantum processors with sparsely connected structure. We should note that the optimization here usually refers to reducing the circuit depth with the help of ancillary qubits, which is quite different from the mapping introduced in the next section, which focuses on reducing the number of SWAP gates added to realize the logical circuit physically and keeping the number of qubits constant.\nActually there have already existed some results on reducing the circuit size under the limited connectivity architecture [365\u2013367, 386]. In 2019, based on Gaussian elimination, Kissinger and Griend presented an algorithm which can extract any n-qubit CNOT circuit to 2n2-size equivalent CNOT\n22\ncircuit if the architecture contains a Hamiltonian path [365]. But if there is no Hamiltonian in the architecture, their optimized size is O(n3). Next in Ref. [366], Nash et al. studied the CNOT circuit optimization on any connected graph, and they proposed an algorithm which gives a 4n2-size equivalent CNOT circuit for any n-qubit CNOT circuit. This bound has been reduced to 2n2 [367]. Furthermore for size optimization, Wu et al. came up with an algorithm, inspired by the result in [412], which can reduce the size of any n-qubit CNOT circuit to\nO(n2/ log \u03b4)\non any connected graph with \u03b4 being the minimum degree, and this bound is optimal when the limited connectivity architecture is a regular graph [367]. In addition, they also optimized the depth of CNOT circuit with the assistance of ancillary qubits. Specifically, their algorithm can reduce the depth of any given n-qubit CNOT circuit to\nO(n2/min{m1,m2}),\nwith 3n \u2264 m1m2 \u2264 n2 ancillary qubits and the limited connectivity architecture is m1 \u00d7m2 grid graph [367]. And this bound is asymptotically optimal when m1 \u00d7 m2 = n. Also this result can be similarly generalized to any constant dimensional grid graph. Most recently, Maslov and Yang considered the optimization of Hadamard-free Clifford circuit on Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) [387] qubit connectivity architectures, and derived this circuit can be implemented over LNN in depth 5n."

            "heading": "C. Mapping",
            "text": "The study of mapping problem firstly focused on its complexity. In 2009, it has been conjectured that mapping a nonLNN (Linear Nearest Neighbor) circuit into an LNN circuit is NP-complete [388], because the number of possible combinations of all permutations for all two-qubit gates in circuit is ((n \u2212 1)!)k, where n is the number of qubits and k is the number of two-qubit gates. Obviously, the number ((n\u22121)!)k will become huge with n and k increasing. In 2014, Shafaei et al. modeled the logical quantum circuit as an interaction graph and the structure of quantum device as a connectivity graph. Thus the mapping problem is a standard graph embedding problem with connectivity and interaction graphs as the host and guest graphs, respectively. And the objective is then to minimize the total distance between adjacent nodes of the interaction graph. For a 2D grid connectivity graph, the mapping problem is NP-complete [389]. In 2018, Siraichi et al. proved the mapping problem, similar to the classical register allocation, is NP-complete in general [373], which is also derived in [390, 391]. Due to the NP-completeness of mapping problem, researchers have taken more attention on how to reduce the SWAP gates needed approximately. We will introduce and analyze the relevant results in three aspects based on different approaches to solve the mapping problem.\nMathematical programming. It is a most natural idea to reformulate the mapping problem on some specific physical\narchitectures into a corresponding optimisation problem and to solve it with state-of-the-art tools and solvers [389, 392\u2013 396]. In 2009, Hirata et al. considered a sorting of the initial qubit order according to a function they defined at first, then sorted this qubit order to the final one. Thus the objective is to minimize the sum of SWAP gates of the first and second step [388]. Next in 2013, Shafaei et al. regarded the mapping problem as improving locality of a given quantum circuit, i.e., the minimum linear arrangement (MinLA) problem in graph theory, and they showed the effectiveness of this approach for quantum Fourier transformation and reversible benchmarks through experimental results [393]. Also they focused on 2D grid architecture [389] and refactored the mapping problem to Mixed Integer Programming problem. In 2015, Lye et al. formulated the mapping problem on multi-dimensional quantum architectures as Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) problem, and used a state-of-the-art PBO solver [397] to achieve a minimal number of SWAP gates [392]. In 2019, Wille et al. formulated the mapping problem as a symbolic optimization problem that is solved using reasoning engines like Boolean satisfiability solvers, and they provided a method that maps small-size logical circuits to IBM\u2019s QX architectures with a minimal number of SWAP and H gates [394].\nHeuristic algorithms. To adapt real quantum devices with complex connectivity architectures, a series of heuristic algorithms [364, 398\u2013404] on the mapping problem were developed. Actually for mapping problem, the most important thing is to determine how to insert the SWAP gate effectively and efficiently. Here \u201ceffectively\u201d means mapping the logical quantum circuit to physical quantum circuit and running that circuit on a quantum hardware device successfully, while \u201cefficently\u201d means adding as few SWAP gates as possible during the mapping procedure. These two aspects correspond to the two steps in the heuristic algorithm design. The first step is to determine the candidate SWAP-gate sets at present, and the second step is to design the evaluation function that can evaluate the effectiveness of the present SWAP gate.\nIn 2011, Saeedi et al. proposed two heuristic methods to determine which qubits should be reordered, a template matching optimization and an exact synthesis approach [405], which, from experimental results, improved the quantum cost by more than 50% on average compared to the naive method. In 2016, Wille et al. considered the effect of inserting SWAP gate on the following two-qubit gates and came up with a look-ahead scheme, which reduced the number of SWAP gates of 56% in the best experimental evaluation [406]. This look-ahead scheme also leads to the improvement for 2D architectures. In 2019, Zulehner, the first-place winner of IBM Q Award, devised a much better algorithm in which quantum gates firstly would be partitioned into layers such that each layer contains only gates acted on distinct sets of qubit. Then they employed the A\u2217 algorithm [413] to search and determine how to insert the SWAP gate for the current layer, which can help to decrease the circuit depth simultaneously. But this algorithm is not suitable to large-scale logical circuit because of the space and time cost of A\u2217 algorithm. In order to improve the efficiency of the searching algorithm, in 2019, Li et al. proposed a SWAP-based BidiREctional heuris-\n23\ntic search algorithm [398]. Instead of searching for a mapping in the full space, they only searched for SWAPs associated with the qubits and designed a heuristic cost function to help find the SWAP that can reduce the sum of distances between each qubit pairs in the front layer. Based on this idea, in 2020, Zhou et al. calculated the costs of SWAP gates on all front layers heuristically and chose the one with the minimum cost [399], which would further reduce the complexity in time polynomial in all parameters. Most recently, they proposed a Monte Carlo Tree Search framework to tackle the mapping problem [400], which enabled the search process to go much deeper.\nMachine learning techniques. Machine learning techniques have also been exploited to provide a more precise evaluation tool for mapping problem [402\u2013404], as they can provide a more precise assessment of the effects of the present SWAP gate. In 2020, Pozzi et al. framed the mapping problem as a reinforcement learning problem, then applied the combinatorial optimization techniques to search for the action leading to the highest-quality under their defined quality function, and finally scheduled SWAP gates [401]. In Ref. [402], graph neural networks were used as an improved architecture to help guide the tree search used to find an optimal set of SWAP gates, then they used an array of mutex locks to represent the current parallelization state to help to reduce the depth of the output circuits. In Ref. [403], Zhou et al. took both short- and long-term rewards into consideration to design a scoring mechanism, and proposed a search algorithm which is polynomial in all relevant parameters."

Typically, RB is executed with gates from the Clifford group, which is referred to Clifford randomized benchmarking (CRB) [40, 415, 418, 419]. A CRB protocol consists of the following steps:\nStep 1: Generate RB sequences. First randomly sample a sequence of gates of a fixed length m from the Clifford group G on n-qubits, and then a global inversion gate is added to return the qubits to the initial state in the ideal case without noise. For each length m, we choose Km RB sequences.\nStep 2: Execute the RB sequences on the noisy quantum devices. Measure the output state to estimate its overlap with the initial state, which is named as survival probability \u03b1m. Repeat Km sequences to obtain the a single average survival probability \u03b1m.\nStep 3: Fit the results.

For each length m, we choose Km XEB sequences.\nStep 2: Execute the XEB sequences on the noisy quantum devices. By comparing the measured state probabilities with the ideal ones, we can calculate the relative cross-entropy differences between probability distributions [434],\n\u03b1= Huniform,ideal \u2212Hexperiment,ideal\nHuniform,ideal \u2212Hideal (67)\nwhere H = \u2212 \u2211 i pi log(qi) is the cross entropy between two probability distributions {pi} and {qi}, and Huniform,ideal is the cross-entropy between the uniform and ideal distributions, Hexperiment,ideal is the cross-entropy between the experimentally measured and ideal distributions, and Hideal is the self-entropy of the ideal distribution.

Specifically, each cycle of the XEB circuit consisting of a layer of random single-qubit gates and the two-qubit gate, with a final round of random single-qubit gates appended at the end, where singlequbit gate set is still\u00b1X ,\u00b1Y , and\u00b1(X\u00b1Y ). Finally, divide the Pauli fidelity of the cycle by the Pauli fidelity of the two single-qubit gates to obtain the Pauli fidelity of the two twoqubit gates.\n25\nXEB is a powerful calibration tool for near-term quantum devices. Some works have attempted to analyze how to spoof linear XEB, an important topic related to the quantum computational advantage experiments [436, 437]. In addition, Chen et al. proposed the Clifford XEB [438], which replaces the random circuits with Clifford circuits, to enable the characterization of large-scale quantum systems, since Clifford circuits can be simulated in polynomial time."

On the other hand, the classical simulators also provide an alternative platform for running quantum algorithms without resorting to an actual quantum computer, which could be very helpful, for example, for exploring near-term quantum algorithms such as VQE, or for testing quantum noise models or quantum error mitigation schemes.\nIn this section we will first review several important classical algorithms used to implement classical simulators for both noiseless and noisy quantum circuits, and then we will briefly review different ways to compute the gradients of parametric quantum circuits on classical computers."

            "text": "Here we introduce some definitions and notations which will be used throughout this section. Mathematically, an nqubit pure quantum state |\u03c6\u3009 can be written as\n|\u03c6\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n\nc\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n |\u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3n\u3009, (78)\nwhere |\u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3n\u3009 represents a specific computational basis and c\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n is the coefficient (amplitude) for it. All the coefficients constitute a rank-n tensor, which contains 2n complex numbers since each \u03c3l can be 0 or 1. The coefficient tensor is usually equivalently viewed as a long state vector of length 2n.\nGenerally, a quantum algorithm starts by initializing the nqubit quantum register in a particular state |0\u2297n\u3009 where all the qubits are set to state |0\u3009. Then one applies a series of quantum gate operations onto the initial state to obtain the final quantum state |\u03c8\u3009:\n|\u03c8\u3009 = C\u0302|0\u2297n\u3009 = Q\u0302m \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Q\u03021|0\u2297n\u3009, (79)\nwhere Q\u0302j denotes the j-th quantum gate operation, m is the total number of gates and C\u0302 is an abbreviation for all the gate operations. We will also use Q to denote the tensor which corresponds to the quantum operator Q\u0302. Finally, a quantum algorithm usually ends by measuring the final quantum state |\u03c8\u3009 to obtain the measurement outcomes in the form of bitstrings, which are either used as the final outputs or used to further compute the expectation values of some quantum observables depending on the specific quantum algorithms. We note that a general quantum algorithm could also allow quantum measurements to be performed in between the quantum gate operations, which however adds no difficulty for classical simulators as long as each elementary quantum operation could be simulated.\nFor classical simulators, one could usually perform more flexible \u201cmeasurements\u201d compared to quantum computers since the quantum state is often stored in a certain data structure on classical computers which can be easily copied and reused. We will primarily focus on the following three types of measurements that can be performed using classical simulators: 1) computing the amplitude of a given bitstring ~b = {b1, b2, . . . , bn}, which is useful to verify the fidelity of the measured bitstrings by noisy quantum computers (the XEB test is one such example); 2) simulating the sampling process, namely generating a number of samples (bitstrings), this could be done as long as one can compute amplitudes for any given bitstrings, for example one could first generate a number of random bitstrings and then perform a rejective sampling to select a subset of them as samples according to their\n27\nSchrodinger Algorithm\u00a8 Tensor Network Algorithm\namplitudes [450]; and 3) computing the expectation values of some quantum observables (Pauli strings for example). We note that although expectation values could be computed in a similar way to quantum computers as long as one can generate samples, for classical simulators there often exist shortcuts in which they can be directly computed without sampling errors, and these exact expectation values could be used as perfect references for noisy quantum computers."

            "heading": "1. Schro\u0308dinger simulator",
            "text": "The most straightforward approach to simulate quantum circuits is the so-called Schro\u0308dinger algorithm, which stores a quantum state |\u03c6\u3009 on a classical computer by directly storing its coefficient tensor c\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n as a state vector [451\u2013 454]. As a result the amount of memory required to store an n-qubit quantum state grows exponentially with n. To given some explicit numbers of the memory complexity using the Schro\u0308dinger simulator (we assume that single precision complex numbers are used), it takes around 1 GB memory for n = 27, around 0.5 TB memory for n = 36, and around 2 PB memory for n = 48 which is already beyond the reach of most of the existing supercomputers in the world! In fact till\nnow the largest classical simulation based on the Schro\u0308dinger simulator has only reached 45 qubits which uses about 0.5 PB memory [453].\nFor the Schro\u0308dinger simulator, the initialization is straightforward since the full quantum state is stored in memory. One can simply set the amplitude corresponding to the computational basis |0, . . . , 0\u3009 to 1 and the amplitudes for the rest to be 0. The quantum gate operations on the state vector can be simulated by following their mathematical definitions. For example a single-qubit gate operation acting on the i-th qubit, denoted as Q\u03c3 \u2032 i \u03c3i , can be simulated as\nc\u03c31,...,\u03c3\u2032i,...,\u03c3n = \u2211 \u03c3i Q \u03c3\u2032i \u03c3ic\u03c31,...,\u03c3i,...,\u03c3n , (80)\nand a two-qubit gate operation acting on the two qubits i and j (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n), denoted as Q\u03c3i\u2032 ,\u03c3j\u2032\u03c3i,\u03c3j , can be simulated as\nc\u03c31,...,\u03c3\u2032i,...,\u03c3\u2032j ,...,\u03c3n = \u2211 \u03c3i,\u03c3j Q \u03c3\u2032i,\u03c3 \u2032 j \u03c3i,\u03c3jc\u03c31,...,\u03c3i,...,\u03c3j ,...,\u03c3n . (81)\nEqs.(80,81) are simply tensor contractions. However, directly implementing them as tensor contractions on classical computers would be extremely slow for large n since tensor contraction would generally involve copies of the tensors (a standard implementation for tensor contraction is to first permute\n28\nthe tensor indices of each tensors and then do matrix multiplication, where the tensors will be copied during the tensor index permutation). Additionally, in actual implementation one usually prefers to implement the gate operations in an inplace fashion to reduce the memory usage, namely one directly uses the result to overwrite the input tensor for the quantum state instead of generating a new one.\nThe memory-efficient way to implement Eqs.(80,81) is to directly follow the definition of tensor contraction, that is, iterating over all the uncontracted indices and performing inplace operations for the contracted indices inside each iteration. Taking the two-qubit gate operation in Eq.(81) as a concrete example, one could first group all the uncontracted indices into three contiguous sets to reduce the number of for loops, which results in a rank-5 tensor denoted as c\u0303:\nc\u0303(\u03c31,...,\u03c3i\u22121),\u03c3i,(\u03c3i+1,...,\u03c3j\u22121),\u03c3j ,(\u03c3j+1,...,\u03c3n) = c\u03c31,...,\u03c3n ,\n(82)\nwhere the set of indices insider the parentheses mean that they are treated together as a single index. We note that in real coding nothing needs to be done in Eq.(82), it is just an equivalent way to view the same state vector. The tensor c\u0303 have a shape 2i\u22121 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2j\u2212i\u22121 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2n\u2212j , and Q\u03c3i\u2032 ,\u03c3j\u2032\u03c3i,\u03c3j can be applied onto c\u0303 using three for loops as shown in Algorithm. 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Implementation of a two-qubit gate operation Q \u03c3i\u2032 ,\u03c3j\u2032 \u03c3i,\u03c3j on an n-qubit quantum state stored as a state vector. Column-major storage and zero-based indexing are assumed for all the tensors.\n1: for s3 = 0 : 2n\u2212j \u2212 1 do 2: for s2 = 0 : 2j\u2212i\u22121 \u2212 1 do 3: for s1 = 0 : 2i\u22121 \u2212 1 do 4: c\u0303[s1, \u03c3 \u2032 i, s2, \u03c3 \u2032 j , s3] =\n\u2211 \u03c3i,\u03c3j Q \u03c3i\u2032 ,\u03c3j\u2032 \u03c3i,\u03c3j \u00d7\nc\u0303[s1, \u03c3i, s2, \u03c3j , s3] 5: end for 6: end for 7: end for\nWe note that the operation inside the for loops of Algorithm. 1 is simply a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix times a vector of size 4. The overall floating number operations in Algorithm. 1 is thus O(4 \u00d7 2n). At the same time one needs to fetch all the elements of the state vector from the main memory into the CPU cache and then send the results back after the computation for at least once, namely the amount of memory access is O(2 \u00d7 2n). As a result the number of memory access compared to the number of floating point arithmetic is roughly 1/2, while for modern classical computing hardware the memory bandwidth is usually much lower compared to the Flops efficiency. For example the V100 GPU has a memory bandwidth of 1.9 TB/s but has a single-precision performance of 19.5 TFlops (the former is only about 10% of the latter). Therefore the efficiency of the Schro\u0308dinger simulator is essentially bounded by the memory bandwidth. Nevertheless, one could slightly increase the compute density by unrolling the inner most for loop such that several vectors of size 4 are processed simultaneously, that is, several matrix-vector multiplications are grouped together into a single matrix-matrix mul-\ntiplication to optimize the usage the CPU cache (one would also make sure that the sizes of the matrices exactly fit into the CPU cache size for the best performance). The loop unrolling will also have an another advantage that one could fetch a bunch of numbers which are contiguous in memory simultaneously, which is an operation that is vectorized by most modern computing hardware. Additionally, the two outer for loops in Algorithm. 1 can be parallelized straightforwardly on a shared-memory architecture. The sparsity of gate operations could also be explored to further speed up the calculation, for example, the control-control-Z gate would only have a single non-trivial operation for its inner matrix-vector multiplication, which means that applying such a three-qubit gate would have a complexity which is only 1/8 of the complexity of a dense single-qubit gate operation.\nAfter all the gate operations have been performed, one obtains the final state |\u03c8\u3009 in the form of a state vector. No additional computations need to be done to obtain the amplitudes since they have been directly stored. The expectation value of a local observable O\u0302i on the i-th qubit, whose corresponding tensor is O\u03c3 \u2032 i \u03c3i , can be computed as\n\u3008\u03c8|O\u0302i|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c31,...,\u03c3i\u22121,\u03c3i,\u03c3\u2032i,\u03c3i+1,...,\u03c3n\nc\u03c31,...,\u03c3i,...,\u03c3n\n\u00d7O\u03c3 \u2032 i \u03c3ic \u2217 \u03c31,...,\u03c3\u2032i,...,\u03c3n . (83)\nOne way to implement Eq.(83) is to treat O\u0302i as a single-qubit operator and apply it onto |\u03c8\u3009 to obtain O\u0302i|\u03c8\u3009, and then compute the dot product between |\u03c8\u3009 and O\u0302i|\u03c8\u3009. The advantage of this approach is that it could easily be generalized to more general observables such as a general Pauli string written as\nP\u0302 = M1 \u2297M2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297Mn, (84)\nwhere each M j \u2208 {X,Y, Z, I2} (X , Y , Z are Pauli matrices and I2 is the 2\u00d7 2 identity matrix) is a local matrix, for which one can simply applyM j sequentially onto |\u03c8\u3009 to obtain P\u0302 |\u03c8\u3009 and then compute the dot product between |\u03c8\u3009 and P\u0302 |\u03c8\u3009. The disadvantage is that one has to use an additional copy of the quantum state to store the intermediate state O\u0302i|\u03c8\u3009 or P\u0302 |\u03c8\u3009. A better approach to take is to directly evaluate Eq.(83) using several for loops similar to Algorithm. 1, for which no copy of the quantum state is required, however for a general Pauli string this approach would require n for loops which is likely to be less efficient.\nAs long as one can compute the expectation of a local observable and can apply gate operations onto the quantum state for some classical simulator, one is able to faithfully simulate the quantum measurement process (the following procedures to simulate quantum measurement are valid for all classical simulators which support those operations). Assuming that one wants to simulate a local quantum measurement on the ith qubit, one can first compute the expectation value of the local operator |1i\u3009\u30081i|which is the probability that the i-th qubit is in state 1, then one generates a random number p according to the uniform distribution and outputs 1 if p < \u3008\u03c8|1i\u3009\u30081i|\u03c8\u3009\n29\nand outputs 0 otherwise. The \u201ccollapse\u201d the quantum state after measurement can be simulated by applying a local operator |1i\u3009\u30081i| onto |\u03c8\u3009 if 1 is obtained from the measurement, or applying |0i\u3009\u30080i| if 0 is obtained (the resulting quantum state should also be normalized by the corresponding probability).\nAn important advantage of the Schro\u0308dinger simulator is that its computational time scales strictly linearly against the number of gate operations (therefore it would also be beneficial to perform gate fusion at the beginning to absorb smaller gates into larger ones to reduce the total number of gate operations). There already exists several excellent libraries which are based on the Schro\u0308dinger simulator, such as ProjectQ [455], Yao [456], Qiskit [360], Quest [457], Qulacs [458]."

            "text": "In the Schro\u0308dinger algorithm the whole quantum state is directly stored in memory. There is another extreme, the pathintegral (Feynman) algorithm, which does not store any quantum state at all. In the Feynman algorithm, the amplitude of a specific bitstring~b is computed as\n\u3008~b|\u03c8\u3009 = \u3008~b|Q\u0302m . . .

To evaluate Eq.(85), all one needs are terms \u3008xj |Q\u0302j |xj\u22121\u3009 which are simply the entries of the tensor Qj . Therefore the quantum state is never explicitly stored in the Feynman algorithm. Each combination {~x1, . . . , ~xm\u22121} specifies a particular path and the total number of different paths (thus the time complexity) scales exponentially with the number of gate operations m, while in the meantime the memory complexity is negligible. The Feynman algorithm is of course impractical for any quantum circuit containing a few hundreds of gate operations due to its scaring time complexity.\nThe Schro\u0308dinger-Feynman algorithm aims to take advantages of both the Schro\u0308dinger algorithm and the Feynman algorithm [450]. Concretely, it divides the whole system into two subsystems and stores two quantum states corresponding to the two subsystems instead of storing the global quantum state. For the Sycamore quantum processor with 53 qubits, one only needs to store two quantum states of 26 and 27 qubits respectively (one could of source increase the number of subsystems if there is not enough memory on the classical computer to store the quantum states of the subsystems). Once the partition is fixed, the gate operations acting on qubits which belong to one subsystem can be simply applied onto the quantum state corresponding to this subsystem. For gate operations which act on qubits from both subsystems, denoted as Q\u0302gl (1 \u2264 l \u2264 mc with mc the total number of such cross gates), one could first decompose it into the following tensor product form (the details of the decomposition will be shown\nlater)\nQ\u0302gl = \u2211 sl U\u0302glsl \u2297 V\u0302 gl sl , (86)\nwhere the operators U\u0302glsl and V\u0302 gl sl act on the two subsystems respectively for each sl, then the amplitude in Eq.(85) can be computed as\n\u3008~b|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\ns1,...,smc\n\u3008~b| . . . U\u0302g2s2 V\u0302 g2 s2 (Q\u0302 g2\u22121 . . . Q\u0302g1+1)\u00d7\n\u00d7 U\u0302g1s1 V\u0302 g1 s1 (Q\u0302 g1\u22121 . . . Q\u03021)|0\u2297n\u3009. (87)\nThe operators in the summand of Eq.(87) act either on one subsystem or the other subsystem, therefore one only needs to store the two quantum states of the two subsystems. Compared to Eq.(85), the total number of paths in Eq.(87) will only grow exponentially against the total number of cross gates, namely mc, instead of m. One could also evaluate the expectation values of observables (local operators or Pauli strings) similar to Eq.(87), however the number of possible paths will generally be squared.\nFrom Eq.(87), the different paths specified by {s1, . . . , smc} can be computed in parallel with no data communication, therefore the Schro\u0308dinger-Feynman algorithm is extremely friendly for large-scale parallelization on distributed architectures. Moreover, one could easily use the Schro\u0308dinger-Feynman algorithm to simulate the simplified quantum circuits by removing a number of cross gates from the original quantum circuit. For these reasons it is used as the first classical benchmarking baseline to characterize quantum supremacy for the Sycamore quantum processor [7]."

            "text": "Tensor network states based algorithms belong to an important class of algorithms which could often leverage the exponential memory requirement when simulating quantum algorithms. Generally, in tensor network states based simulators one represents the underlying quantum state as a tensor network which only consists of low-rank tensors, then the gate operations are simulated by updating the local tensors of the tensor network been acted on and quantum measurements could be simulated by contracting some tensor network.\nTensor network states are originally introduced to solve quantum many-body problems, which are mostly used to approximate the low-energy states of quantum many-body Hamiltonians [459]. Depending on the structure of the physical problem, various tensor network ansatz have been used to represent the underlying quantum state, such as matrix product states (MPS) [460\u2013462], projected entangled pair states (PEPS) [463], tree tensor network (TTN) [464], multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) [465]. In particular, MPS and PEPS are designed for one-dimensional and two-dimensional quantum many-body systems respectively [459, 466], and have achieved great success therein for the past thirty years.\n30\nOut of all tensor network states, MPS is a very special and important one, mostly because that the errors in MPS based algorithms can be often well controlled and that it allows very efficient and stable ground state searching [467, 468] and time evolution algorithms [460\u2013462]. Therefore although MPS is mostly designed to represent the ground states of onedimensional quantum many-body systems, it could also be used as a general-purpose ansatz similar to the state vector for arbitrary quantum states (in the general case the cost of MPS could also grow exponentially) [469]. MPS based simulator has been used to simulate Shor\u2019s algorithm up to 60 qubits [470, 471], to simulate (noisy) optical quantum circuits [472], to simulate the Sycamore RQCs [473], and to simulate VQE algorithms for quantum chemistry problems with up to 100 qubits [474]. Some typical simulations of VQE using the Schro\u0308dinger simulator and the MPS based simulator are listed in TABLE. II.\nTo simulate quantum circuits based on the MPS representation of the quantum state, one could directly use an MPS based time evolution algorithm such as time evolving block decimation (TEBD) [461]. In the following we will introduce a variant of TEBD to enhance the stability of the algorithm. MPS rewrites the rank-n coefficient tensor c\u03c31,...,\u03c3n in Eq.(78) as the product of a chain of rank-3 tensors as\nc\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n = \u2211\na0,...,an\nB\u03c31a0,a1B \u03c32 a1,a2 . . . B \u03c3n an\u22121,an , (88)\nwhere \u03c3j \u2208 {0, 1} is the \u201cphysical\u201d index and aj the \u201cauxiliary\u201d index. The indices a0 and an at the boundaries are trivial indices added for notational convenience. The size of an MPS can be conveniently characterized by the largest size of the auxiliary indices\nD = max 1\u2264j\u2264n\u22121 (dim(aj)) , (89)\nwhich is usually referred to as the bond dimension of MPS. In principle, Eq.(88) is able to represent any quantum states exactly if D increases exponentially. A quantum state is said to be efficiently representable as an MPS if D is nearly a constant as n grows. Generally, for MPS based algorithms the memory complexity scales as O(nD2) and the computational complexity scales as O(nD3).\nSlightly different from the TEBD algorithm, we assume that the MPS is prepared in a right-canonical form, where each site tensor satisfies the right-canonical condition\u2211\n\u03c3j ,aj\n(B \u03c3j a\u2032j\u22121,aj )\u2217B\u03c3jaj\u22121,aj = \u03b4aj\u22121,a\u2032j\u22121 . (90)\nWe also assume that the bipartition singular vectors, denoted as \u03bbaj , which are the Schmidt numbers when splitting the system into two subsystems from qubits 1 to j and from qubits j+1 to n, are also stored. The initial state |0\u2297n\u3009 can be easily written as an MPS with D = 1, for which each site tensor satisfies\nB \u03c3j=0 aj\u22121=0,aj=0 = 1, B \u03c3j=1 aj\u22121=0,aj=0 = 0, (91)\n(In fact any separable state can be written as an MPS with D = 1 similarly). The corresponding singular vectors are simply initialized as \u03bbaj=0 = 1. It is straightforward to verify that the site tensors initialized in this way satisfy Eq.(90) and that the singular vectors are the correct Schmidt numbers. The gate operations are then applied sequentially onto the MPS. A single-qubit gate operation acting on the j-th qubit, denoted as Q \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3j , changes the j-th site tensor of the MPS as\nB\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj = \u2211 \u03c3j Q \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3jB \u03c3j aj\u22121,aj . (92)\nSince Q \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3j is unitary, it is straightforward to verify that B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj will satisfy Eq.(90) as long as B \u03c3j aj\u22121,aj does. For a nearest-neighbour two-qubit gate Q \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1\n\u03c3j ,\u03c3j+1 acting on two qubits j and j+1 (the j-th bond), it will change the both the j and j + 1-th site tensors of the MPS. To simulate a two-qubit gate operation while preserving the right canonical property of the underlying MPS, we use the technique first introduced in Ref. [486], which is shown as follows. First we contract the two site tensors B\u03c3jaj\u22121,aj and B \u03c3j+1 aj ,aj+1 with Q \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1\n\u03c3j ,\u03c3j+1 to get a two-site tensor\nC \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1 aj\u22121,aj+1 = \u2211\naj ,\u03c3j ,\u03c3j+1\nQ \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1\n\u03c3j ,\u03c3j+1B \u03c3j aj\u22121,ajB \u03c3j+1 aj ,aj+1 .

(94)\nNow we perform singular value decomposition (SVD) on the tensor C\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1\naj\u22121,aj+1 and get\nSVD(C\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1 aj\u22121,aj+1) = \u2211 aj U \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj \u03bb\u0303ajV \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 , (95)\n31\nduring which we will also truncate the small singular values below a certain threshold or simply reserve the D largest singular values if the singular values larger than is more than D. Here we note that this truncation step is the only step that would introduce errors in the algorithm, and such errors could be made arbitrarily small in principle if one sets to be very small and D to be very large (the actual size of D required is of course problem-dependent). After the SVD, the updated site tensors B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj and B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 can be obtained as\nB\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj = \u2211 \u03c3\u2032j+1,aj+1 C \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1 aj\u22121,aj+1 ( V \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 )\u2217 ; (96) B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 = V \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 . (97)\nTo verify that B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj and B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 are indeed the solu-\ntions, we can see that \u2211 aj B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 = C \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1 aj\u22121,aj+1 up to truncation errors. The reason that one does not directly do SVD on C \u03c3\u2032j ,\u03c3 \u2032 j+1\naj\u22121,aj+1 to get the updated site tensors is to preserve the right canonical properties of the solutions, in fact it could be verified that B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj and B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 both satisfy Eq.(90) (B\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j+1 aj ,aj+1 is right canonical by construction from Eq.(95)). The new singular vector \u03bb\u0303\u03b1j contains the correct Schmidt numbers on bond j of the updated MPS and is used to replace the old \u03bb\u03b1j . Similar to the Schro\u0308dinger simulator, one can also absorb the single-qubit gate operations into twoqubit gate operations before hand, but the speedup will not be as significant since the complexity of a single-qubit gate operations is negligible compared to a two-qubit gate for MPS based simulator. A three-qubit gate which acts on three contiguous qubits could also be simulated similarly, where the three site tensors as well as the two singular vectors in between will be updated. A non-nearest-neighbour gate operation could be simulated by decomposing it into a series of nearest-neighbour gate operations using the SWAP gate.\nWith a right-canonical MPS, there is a very efficient way to compute the expectation of a local operator or a Pauli string. For example, the expectation value of a single-qubit observable O\u0302j on the j-th qubit can be simply computed as\n\u3008\u03c8|O\u0302j |\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\naj\u22121,aj ,\u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j\n\u03bb2aj\u22121O \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3jB \u03c3\u2032j aj\u22121,aj (B \u03c3j aj\u22121,aj ) \u2217,\n(98)\nand the expectation value of a generic two-qubit observable O\u0302i,j on the i and j-th qubits (i < j) can be computed as \u3008\u03c8|O\u0302i,j |\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\naj:i\u22121,\u03c3j:i,\u03c3\u2032j:i\n\u03bb2ai\u22121O \u03c3\u2032i,\u03c3 \u2032 j \u03c3i,\u03c3jB \u03c3\u2032i ai\u22121,ai(B \u03c3i ai\u22121,ai) \u2217\u00d7\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7B\u03c3 \u2032 j aj\u22121,aj (B \u03c3j aj\u22121,aj ) \u2217,\n(99)\nwhere we have used xj:i = {xi, xi+1, . . . , xj} as an abbreviation for a list of indices. The expectation value of a general\nn-qubit Pauli string could be computed similarly, with a complexity that scales as O(nD3).\nAfter one obtains the quantum state |\u03c8\u3009 in MPS form, the amplitude of a given bitstring~b can be computed as\n\u3008~b|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\na0,...,an\nB\u03c31=b1a0,a1 B \u03c32=b2 a1,a2 . . . B \u03c3n=bn an\u22121,an , (100)\nfor which only O(n) matrix-vector multiplications need to be performed. Given the ability to efficiently compute the amplitude, one could also simulate the sampling problem by further using a sampling algorithm. However, sampling an MPS can be done exactly and more efficiently [487]. Given an MPS in the right-canonical form as in Eq.(88), the reduced density matrix for qubits from 1 to j can be simply computed as\n\u03c1 \u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3 \u2032 j \u03c31,...,\u03c3j = \u2211\naj\u22121:0,a\u2032j\u22121:0,aj\n(B \u03c3\u20321 a\u20320,a \u2032 1 )\u2217B\u03c31a0,a1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00d7 (B\u03c3 \u2032 j\u22121 a\u2032j\u22122,a \u2032 j\u22121 )\u2217B\u03c3j\u22121aj\u22122,aj\u22121(B \u03c3\u2032j a\u2032j\u22121,aj )\u2217B\u03c3jaj\u22121,aj .\n(101)\nTo generate a single sample (bitstring), one could first compute the reduced density matrix of the first qubit, \u03c1\u03c3 \u2032 1 \u03c31 , using Eq.(101), and then one could perform a local sampling on \u03c1\u03c3 \u2032 1 \u03c31 to get the sampling output for the first qubit, denoted as \u03bd1. After that, the reduced density matrix of the second qubit conditioned on the sampling outcome of the first qubit, denoted as \u03c1\u03c3 \u2032 2 \u03c32 |\u03bd1 , can be computed as\n\u03c1 \u03c3\u20322 \u03c32 |\u03bd1 = 1\np(\u03bd1) \u2211 a1:0,a\u20321:0,a2 (B \u03c3\u20321=\u03bd1 a\u20320,a \u2032 1 )\u2217B\u03c31=\u03bd1a0,a1 (B \u03c3\u20322 a\u20321,a2 )\u2217B\u03c32a1,a2 ,\n(102)\nwhere p(\u03bd1) = \u03c1 \u03c3\u20321=\u03bd1 \u03c31=\u03bd1 is the probability to get \u03bd1 when measuring the first qubit. By a local sampling on \u03c1\u0302\u03c3 \u2032 2 \u03c32 |\u03bd1 on could obtain the sampling outcome of the second qubit, denoted as \u03bd2. Repeating this process from left to right, one can obtain one sample ~\u03bd = {\u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdn}. The complexities of computing one amplitude and generating one sample both scale as O(nD2)."

            "text": "PEPS is a natural extension of MPS to two-dimensional systems [463]. Currently, the mainstream quantum processors all have a two-dimensional geometry, therefore PEPS could be a natural tensor network ansatz to represent quantum states generated on those quantum processors. A PEPS on a square lattice can be written as\n|\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c31,\u03c32,...,\u03c3n\nF(A\u03c311 A \u03c32 2 . . . A \u03c3n n )|\u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3n\u3009,\n(103)\nwhere each A\u03c3jj is a short hand for the rank-5 site tensor A \u03c3j l,r,u,d with a physical index \u03c3j and 4 auxiliary indices\n32\nl, r, u, d representing the connecting of this tensor with the ones on the left, right, upper and lower respectively. F(. . . ) means to contract the pairs of connected auxiliary indices. Similar to MPS, the size of a PEPS can also be characterized by its bond dimension defined as the largest size of its auxiliary indices, which we will still denote as D. The memory complexity to store a PEPS scales as O(nD4).\nThe initial state |0\u2297n\u3009 can be easily constructed as a PEPS with D = 1, with site tensors satisfying\nA \u03c3j=0 l=0,r=0,u=0,d=0 = 1, A \u03c3j=1 l=0,r=0,u=0,d=0 = 0. (104)\nTo simulate the gate operations on a PEPS, one needs to properly update the site tensors of the PEPS. However for a PEPS the updating is much less straightforward than for an MPS. In the context of quantum many-body physics, many sophisticated methods have been proposed to approximately update the site tensors of a PEPS after a gate operation has been applied on the PEPS, such that the bond dimension of the updated PEPS is bounded by a given bond dimension D [488\u2013 491]. Here we will only present the method used in Ref. [41] to simulate RQCs, which allows D to grow after each gate operation and is essentially exact.\nFor single-qubit gate operationQ \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3j acting on the j-th qubit,\nit only updates the j-th site tensor of the PEPS as\nA\u0303 \u03c3j l,r,u,d = \u2211 \u03c3\u2032j Q \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3jA \u03c3\u2032j l,r,u,d. (105)\nFor a two-qubit gate operation Q \u03c3\u2032i,\u03c3 \u2032 j\n\u03c3i,\u03c3j , one first splits it into the product of two rank-3 tensors using SVD as in Eq.(86). Concretely, this can be done by first decomposing it as\nSVD(Q \u03c3\u2032i,\u03c3 \u2032 j \u03c3i,\u03c3j ) = \u2211 s U\u0303 \u03c3\u2032i \u03c3i,s\u03bbsV\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j s,\u03c3j , (106)\nthen Eq.(86) can be satisfied by choosing the tensors U and V as\nU \u03c3\u2032i \u03c3i,s = \u2211 s U\u0303 \u03c3\u2032i \u03c3i,s \u221a \u03bbs; (107) V \u03c3\u2032j s,\u03c3j =\n\u2211 s \u221a \u03bbsV\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j s,\u03c3j . (108)\nAssuming that the qubits i and j are a pair of nearestneighbour qubits in the horizontal direction, then the site tensors A\u03c3ii and A \u03c3j j can be updated as\nA\u0303 \u03c3\u2032i l,r\u2032,u,d = \u2211 \u03c3i U \u03c3\u2032i \u03c3i,sA \u03c3i l,r,u,d; (109) A\u0303 \u03c3\u2032j l\u2032,r,u,d =\n\u2211 \u03c3j V \u03c3\u2032j s,\u03c3jA \u03c3j l,r,u,d, (110)\nwhere we have used r\u2032 = (r, s) and l\u2032 = (s, l). We note that the size of the right auxiliary index of the site tensor A\u03c3ii (and the left auxiliary index of the site tensor A\u03c3jj ) will be enlarged by \u03c7 times after updating where \u03c7 is the number of nonzero\nSchmidt number in Eq.(106). A two-qubit gate operation on a vertical pair of qubits can be done similarly by updating the auxiliary indices in the vertical directions (d and u) instead.\nAfter one obtains the final quantum state |\u03c8\u3009 as a PEPS, the amplitude of a specific bitstring~b can be computed as\n\u3008~b|\u03c8\u3009 = F(A\u03c31=b11 A \u03c31=b2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7A\u03c3n=bnn ), (111)\nwhich amounts to contracting a two-dimensional tensor network with no output indices. For an arbitrary PEPS, the contraction of Eq.(111) is a hard problem. Nevertheless in the context of quantum many-body physics there has been quite a few approximate methods to contract a two-dimensional tensor network similar to Eq.(111), which are fairly efficient and accurate [490, 492\u2013497]. However the two dimensional tensor networks formed in quantum many-body problems usually has a much clear physical origin, such as resulting from computing a local observable on a PEPS which represents the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. When applied to computing amplitudes of RQCs, the physical context is not as clear, and the approximate methods to contract Eq.(111) could easily result in significant errors. Therefore in Ref. [41] Eq.(111) is contracted exactly. For a rectangular lattice with size nh \u00d7 nv , it is estimated that the time complexity Ct of directly contracting Eq.(111) is\nCt = (nh \u2212 2)(nv \u2212 2)Dmin(nh,nv)+3. (112)\nOne could also compute local observables similar to Eq.(111), however the resulting two-dimensional tensor network will have a bond dimension D2 instead, for which one may have to resort to those approximate methods. The PEPS simulator could also be easily adapted for other two-dimensional geometries [42]. Additionally, the algorithms used in Ref. [498, 499] are essentially equivalent to the PEPS algorithm presented here, although they are not presented using the PEPS language.\nCurrently, PEPS based simulator has only been applied to simulate the RQC sampling problem. For RQC on a square lattice, the largest simulation scale till now is reached by using the PEPS based simulator, where one amplitude of a 10 \u00d7 10 RQC with depth 40 is computed within 60 hours [43].\nBesides the RQC sampling problem, PEPS based simulator is also promising for simulating other quantum algorithms which are designed for two-dimensional architectures, such as VQE which uses a physically motivated ansatz. In such situations one may also explore those approximate PEPS updating and contraction algorithms to significantly speedup the calculations."

            "text": "Instead of representing the quantum state as a tensor network state and then applying the gate operations sequentially onto it, the quantum circuit itself, as in Eq.(79), can be naturally viewed as a large tensor network, in which the initial state |0\u2297n\u3009 is simply the tensor product of n vectors\n33\n|0\u3009 = [1, 0], each single-qubit gate operation is a rank-2 tensor and each two-qubit gate operation is a rank-4 tensor [500]. There are n uncontracted (output) indices in the end of the tensor network which correspond to the final quantum state. Contracting this tensor network one would directly obtain the final quantum state |\u03c8\u3009 as a state vector, which is of source only feasible for very small problems. Depending on the specific task to do, the tensor network could be simplified. For example for computing the amplitude of a bitstring, one would project each output index into a particular qubit state of the bitstring, resulting in a new tensor network with no output indices. For computing a local observables, one needs to contract a new tensor network where the observable is sandwiched between the two tensor networks formed by |\u03c8\u3009 and its conjugate \u3008\u03c8|. In either case, the solution of the problem could be obtained by contracting a large tensor network with no or very few output indices.\nOnce the problem has been equivalently transformed into a tensor network contraction (TNC) problem, the key for the performance is to identify a near optimal tensor network contraction order (TNCO). Here we note that there is an important difference between the TNC algorithm and the tensor network states based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits, although in both cases the target problem will eventually be converted into the problem of contracting a tensor network. Taking the task of computing one amplitude as an example, for a quantum circuit which only contains single-qubit and two-qubit gate operations, the total number of tensors of the tensor network formed in the TNC algorithm will be approximately equal to the number of two-qubit gates, while for MPS or PEPS algorithms the number of tensors in the final tensor network is strictly equal to the total number of qubits (but in the latter case each tensor could be very large). In fact, the PEPS algorithm can also be viewed as a specialized instance of the TNC algorithm by choosing a particular TNCO: one first contracts all the tensors in the time direction, which results in a two-dimensional tensor network in the spatial directions (assuming that the quantum processor has a two-dimensional geometry), and then contracts the resulting two-dimensional tensor network. For PEPS based simulator since the resulting two-dimensional tensor network has a much smaller number of tensors and also has a very regular structure, one could easily identify an optimal TNCO. Therefore when the tensor network is contracted exactly, the TNC based simulator has the maximum flexibility to choose an optimal TNCO which can result in lower computational complexity compared to the PEPS based simulator in principle.\nThe TNC algorithm is powered by the highly efficient heuristic methods to search for near optimal TNCOs developed in recent years [44, 501, 502]. When applied to RQCs on Sycamore(-like) quantum processors, the TNC algorithm gives much lower computational complexity than PEPS. The central idea of those heuristic methods is to use existing graph partitioning methods to first divide the large tensor network with hundreds of tensors (corresponding to a graph with hundreds of nodes) into many smaller tensor networks such that one could easily compute the TNCO for each smaller tensor network and then assembly then together into a large TNCO\nfor the original tensor network [501]. For very large tensor networks, slicing is also an indispensable technique which \u201ccuts\u201d a number of edges in the original tensor network such that the original tensor network is transformed into the sum of many smaller tensor networks with fewer edges. The slicing technique could significantly reduce the memory usage since only simpler tensor networks are being contracted, and if used properly, it could only result in moderate computational overhead compared to directly contracting the original tensor network [502]. By understanding the mechanism for the computational overhead induced by slicing, a lifetime based heuristic method is proposed to systematically find a near optimal slicing scheme [503].\nFor the task of computing one amplitude or a correlated batch of amplitudes for the hardest Sycamore RQC (with a circuit depth 20), various works have all given a computational complexity of the order O(1018). While such a complexity scale can be accomplished on a exascale supercomputer within seconds in principle, the fastest record till now takes around 150 seconds to compute a batch of correlated amplitudes [503]. For computing a number of uncorrelated amplitudes (or generating uncorrelated samples), a recent work develops a multiple-amplitude TNC algorithm which caches intermediate computations to reduce the overall complexity, and based on this method millions of uncorrelated amplitudes for the Sycamore RQCs with depths up to 16 are successfully computed [504]. A sparse-state method is also proposed to compute a large number of amplitudes with a limited fidelity, which is used to generate one million uncorrelated samples for the hardest Sycamore RQC using 512 GPUs for 15 hours, with a higher fidelity than in the quantum supremacy experiment [45]. For RQC on a square lattice the largest reported simulation scale using the TNC algorithm reaches 9\u00d79 qubits with a circuit depth 40 [505]. Typical large-scale classical simulations of RQCs have also been summarized in TABLE. III."

            "text": "In certain situations it is also important to simulate noisy quantum circuits, for example, to understand the behaviors of quantum algorithms under certain level of noises, to test quantum noise models for quantum computers or to test quantum error mitigations schemes.\nIn a noisy quantum circuit, the underlying quantum state should be represented as a mixed state (density operator), and the quantum gate operations should be generalized to quantum channels which are super operators acting on the density operator. To simulate a noisy quantum circuit classically, two very different but in principle equivalent approaches can be used. In the first approach, one simply inserts random Pauli errors into the original noiseless quantum circuit with certain probabilities [1]. By averaging the results over a large number of error realizations, one could reproduce the result of a noisy quantum circuit. Since for each noise realization one only needs to deal with a quantum circuit which only contains unitary quantum gate operations, the classical simulators for\n34\nnoiseless quantum circuits can be directly used. In the second approach, one directly simulates the noisy quantum circuit by representing the quantum state as a density operator, then one applies the quantum channels onto the density operator and performs quantum measurements based on the density operator in the end. Compared to the first approach, the second approach is free of the errors resulting from a finite number of noise realizations. However, the memory cost of the second approach could be significantly larger since the size of a density operator is the square of a pure state in general. Although a noisy quantum circuit seems very different from a noiseless one mathematically, one can equivalently map it into a problem which is very similar to the noiseless case, after which one could directly make use of all the classical algorithms used for simulating noiseless quantum circuits. This mapping is demonstrated as follows, which is described mostly based on the state vector representation of the quantum state but is completely general for all the classical simulators we have mentioned.\nFirst we map the density operator into an enlarged \u201cpure state\u201d. Mathematically, a density operator \u03c1\u0302 for an n-qubit quantum system can be denoted as\n\u03c1\u0302 = \u2211\n\u03c3n:1,\u03c3\u2032n:1\n\u03c1 \u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3 \u2032 n\n\u03c31,...,\u03c3n |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3n\u3009\u3008\u03c3\u20321, . . . , \u03c3\u2032n|, (113)\nwhere \u03c1\u03c3 \u2032 1,...,\u03c3 \u2032 n\n\u03c31,...,\u03c3n is the rank-2n coefficient tensor (density matrix). One can equivalently view the density operator \u03c1\u0302 as a pure state with 2n qubits as\n|\u03c1\u0302\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c3n:1,\u03c3\u2032n:1\n\u03c1\u0303\u03c31,...,\u03c3n,\u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3\u2032n |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3n, \u03c3 \u2032 1, . . . , \u03c3 \u2032 n\u3009,\n(114)\nwhere \u03c1\u0303\u03c31,...,\u03c3n,\u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3\u2032n is similar to c\u03c31,...,\u03c3n in the noiseless case. Again in the mapping of the coefficient tensor from \u03c1 to \u03c1\u0303, nothing needs to be done actually, it is just a different way to view the same tensor. We will also refer to \u03c1\u0303 as the squashed state vector.\nThe quantum channel is defined as a super operator acting on the density operator \u03c1\u0302. In the squashed state vector representation, the quantum channel will be a normal quantum\noperator acting on |\u03c1\u0302\u3009 instead. Taking the case of a singlequbit quantum channel for example, which is denoted as K and acts on the j-th qubit, we assume that it is written in the standard Sudarshan-Kraus-Choi form as [508\u2013510]\nK(\u03c1) = \u2211\ns,\u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j\nKs\u03c4 \u2032j ,\u03c3\u2032j\u03c1 \u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3 \u2032 n \u03c31,...,\u03c3n(K s \u03c4j ,\u03c3j ) \u2217. (115)\nIn the squashed state vector representation, the quantum channel K will be mapped into a normal operator acting on \u03c1\u0303, denoted as K\u0303, which can be writen as\nK\u0303(\u03c1\u0303) = \u2211\ns,\u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j\nKs\u03c4 \u2032j ,\u03c3\u2032j (K s \u03c4j ,\u03c3j ) \u2217\u03c1\u0303\u03c31,...,\u03c3n,\u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3\u2032n\n= M \u03c4j ,\u03c4\n\u2032 j\n\u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j \u03c1\u0303\u03c31,...,\u03c3n,\u03c3\u20321,...,\u03c3\u2032n , (116)\nwhere in the second line we have defined\nM \u03c4j ,\u03c4\n\u2032 j \u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j = \u2211 s Ks\u03c4 \u2032j ,\u03c3\u2032j (K s \u03c4j ,\u03c3j ) \u2217. (117)\nWe can see from Eq.(116) that the effect of a single-qubit quantum channel acting on \u03c1\u0302 is exactly equivalent to a twoqubit \u201cgate operation\u201d acting on |\u03c1\u0302\u3009. Similarly any the l-qubit quantum channel acting on \u03c1\u0302 can be mapped to a 2l-qubit gate operation on |\u03c1\u0302\u3009. Thus all the quantum channels can be applied onto the squashed state vector using the same algorithm which applies unitary quantum gate operations onto a state vector.\nFor a density operator, the amplitude of a given bitstring ~b is not well defined, but one can compute the probability of ~b instead, which is\n\u3008~b|\u03c1\u0302|~b\u3009 = \u03c1\u03c3 \u2032 1=b1,...,\u03c3 \u2032 n=bn\n\u03c31=b1,...,\u03c3n=bn\n= \u03c1\u0303\u03c31=b1,...,\u03c3n=bn,\u03c3\u20321=b1,...,\u03c3\u2032n=bn . (118)\nTherefore the probability \u3008~b|\u03c1\u0302|~b\u3009 can be computed by computing the \u201camplitude\u201d of the squashed state vector |\u03c1\u0302\u3009 on an enlarged bitstring {b1, . . . , bn, b1, . . . , bn}. A local observable\n35\nO\u0302j acting on the j-th qubit is by definition\ntr(O\u0302j \u03c1\u0302) = \u2211\n\u03c3j\u22121:1,\u03c3n:j+1,\u03c3j ,\u03c3\u2032j\nO \u03c3\u2032j \u03c3j \u03c1 \u03c31,...,\u03c3 \u2032 j ,...,\u03c3n \u03c31,...,\u03c3j ,...,\u03c3n , (119)\nwhich can be computed by applying a two-qubit gate operation on |\u03c1\u0302\u3009, and then view |\u03c1\u0302\u3009 as a density operator again and take the trace of it (instead of taking the dot product between two state vectors as in the noiseless case).\nTherefore we can see that the second approach to simulate a noisy quantum circuit could be equivalently mapped into simulating a noiseless quantum circuit, with some minor differences that the effective number of qubits is doubled and that one may need to slightly adapt the algorithms used to simulate quantum measurements. There is another subtle difference that in case of noisy quantum circuits the \u201cgate operations\u201d on the squashed state vector are no longer unitary, which would affect the classical simulators which explicitly make use of this property. For the classical simulators that we have introduced, only the MPS based simulator has explicitly used the unitary property to preserve the right canonical form of MPS. In the noisy case, the gate operation algorithms based on MPS can still be used for |\u03c1\u0302\u3009 in principle if the truncation error is set to be very small. However it could be less accurate and less stable compared to the unitary case since the singular values being truncated no longer correspond to the correct Schmidt numbers. The non-unitarity of noisy quantum circuits could also affect the stability of the PEPS based simulator if the gate operation and the tensor network contraction are not performed exactly. The density operator based approach for noisy quantum circuits has been implemented in Qiskit [360], Quest [457], Qulacs [458], TensorCircuit [511], which mostly uses the Schro\u0308dinger algorithm."

            "heading": "C. Computing gradients for parametric quantum circuits",
            "text": "In the VQE algorithm, the quantum circuit often contains a number of tunable parameters, and the solution is approached by iteratively updating those parameters. To accelerate convergence, a gradient-based optimization algorithm is usually preferred, especially when there is a large number of parameters. To simulate VQE on a classical computer, it would also be helpful to efficiently compute the gradients on classical computers. Compared to quantum computers, computing gradients on classical computers is much more flexible. In the following we will show several different approaches to compute the gradients of parametric quantum circuits, which could be useful in different situations.\nWe assume that the quantum circuit which is parameterized by a list of parameters ~\u03b8 = {\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8m}, denoted as C\u0302(~\u03b8). We also assume that C\u0302(~\u03b8) can be written as\nC\u0302(~\u03b8) = Q\u0302(\u03b8m) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Q\u0302(\u03b82)Q\u0302(\u03b81) (120)\nwhere each parametric gate Q\u0302(\u03b8j) contains a single parameter \u03b8j (the case that there exists several parameters in one gate could be analyzed similarly). A quite generic task to do using\nparametric quantum circuits is to minimize some loss function in the form\nL(~\u03b8) = \u30080\u2297n|C\u0302\u2020(~\u03b8)H\u0302 C\u0302(~\u03b8)|0\u2297n\u3009, (121)\nwhere H\u0302 is a Hermitian quantum operator (which does not have to be local).\nThe most straightforward approach to compute the gradient of the loss function in Eq.(121) is the finite difference method, in which the gradient with respect to one parameter \u03b8j is evaluated as\n\u2202L(~\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j \u2248 L(. . . , \u03b8j + \u03b4, . . . )\u2212 L( ~\u03b8) \u03b4 , (122)\nwith \u03b4 a small positive number. Denoting the complexity of evaluating Eq.(121) as S, we can see that the complexity of evaluating the gradients with respect to all the parameters using Eq.(122) is O(mS) with m the total number of parameters. Eq.(122) evaluates the first-order derivative against \u03b4, which can be slightly modified to be second-order:\n\u2202L(~\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j \u2248 L(. . . , \u03b8j + \u03b4, . . . )\u2212 L(. . . , \u03b8j \u2212 \u03b4, . . . ) 2\u03b4 . (123)\nThe complexity of evaluating Eq.(123) isO(2mS). One could also use a higher-order finite-difference method for computing the gradients, which would in general be more accurate by also incur higher computational cost.\nFor gradient-based algorithms one often wants to obtain gradients which are numerically exact. For those parametric quantum circuits whose parameters are all encoded in the single-qubit rotational gates Rx, Ry , Rz defined as\nRx(\u03b8) =\n[ cos( \u03b82 ) \u2212i sin( \u03b8 2 )\n\u2212i sin( \u03b82 ) cos( \u03b8 2 )\n] ; (124)\nRy(\u03b8) =\n[ cos( \u03b82 ) \u2212 sin( \u03b8 2 )\nsin( \u03b82 ) cos( \u03b8 2 )\n] ; (125)\nRz(\u03b8) =\n[ e\u2212i \u03b8 2 0\n0 ei \u03b8 2\n] , (126)\nthe exact gradients can be computed using the parameter shift rule as [83]\n\u2202L(~\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j = L(. . . , \u03b8j + \u03c0 2 , . . . )\u2212 L(. . . , \u03b8j \u2212 \u03c0 2 , . . . ).\n(127)\nWe can see that the complexity of evaluating Eq.(127) is the same to Eq.(123). For more general parametric quantum gate operations Eq.(127) may not hold, nevertheless more sophisticated methods have been proposed evaluate the gradients exactly [84]. Importantly, Eqs.(122,123,127) can all be evaluated on quantum computers, since they only require the ability for forward evaluation of the loss function in Eq.(121).\nSimilar to computing the expectation values, for classical simulators there often exists shortcuts to evaluate the gradients. In fact the key for the success of classical deep learning is the automatic differentiation algorithm which allows to\n36\ncompute the gradients very efficiently as evaluating the loss function itself [512]. Since for classical simulators the loss function only runs on a classical computer, in principle one can also benefit from the automatic differentiation algorithm by generalizing it to complex numbers [513]. However, if one directly applies the automatic differentiation algorithm in the classical simulator, then the intermediate outputs after applying each Q\u0302(\u03b8j) onto the quantum state have to be cached so as to enable efficient back propagation, namely one has to store at leastm copies of the quantum state. This would be impossible (or highly inefficient) even for moderate values ofm. Nevertheless, by exploring the reversibility of the quantum circuit, one could use a memory efficient back propagation algorithm for parametric quantum circuits where only two copies of the quantum state have to be used at least. The algorithm is shown in the following based on the Schro\u0308dinger simulator.\nTaking the partial derivative of Eq.(121) with respect to one of the parameters, \u03b8j , we get\n\u2202L(~\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j = \u3008\u03c8(~\u03b8)|H\u0302 C\u0302m:j+1 dQ\u0302(\u03b8j) d\u03b8j C\u0302j\u22121:1|0\u2297n\u3009+ H.c.,\n(128)\nwhere we have used |\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009 = C\u0302(~\u03b8)|0\u2297n\u3009 and C\u0302b:a = Q\u0302(\u03b8b)Q\u0302(\u03b8b\u22121) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Q\u0302(\u03b8a). Now we define\n|\u03a6j\u3009 = C\u0302j:1|0\u2297n\u3009; (129)\n|\u03a8j\u3009 = C\u0302\u2020m:j+1H\u0302|\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009, (130)\nthen Eq.(128) can be rewritten as\n\u2202L(~\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8j = \u3008\u03a8j | dQ\u0302(\u03b8j) d\u03b8j |\u03a6j\u22121\u3009+ H.c.. (131)\nNow the memory efficient back propagation algorithm to compute all the partial derivatives runs as follows. First we run a forward evaluation of Eq.(121), during which the two intermediate states |\u03a6m\u3009 = |\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009 and |\u03a8m\u3009 = H\u0302|\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009 are both saved. Then we do a backward evolution of the two states |\u03a6m\u3009 and |\u03a8m\u3009 by applying each of the gate operations in C\u0302\u2020(~\u03b8) onto them. The details of the backward evolution algorithm is shown in Algorithm. 2.\nAlgorithm 2 Memory-efficient back propagation algorithm for computing the gradient of a parametric quantum circuit, where |\u03a6m\u3009 and |\u03a8m\u3009 are produced during the forward evaluation.\n1: grads = zeros(m) 2: for j = m\u2212 1 : \u22121 : 0 do 3: |\u03a6j\u3009 = Q\u0302(\u03b8j+1)\u2020|\u03a6j+1\u3009 4: grads[j] = 2Re(\u3008\u03a8j+1| dQ\u0302(\u03b8j)d\u03b8j |\u03a6j\u3009) 5: |\u03a8j\u3009 = Q\u0302(\u03b8j+1)\u2020|\u03a8j+1\u3009 6: end for 7: Return grads\nWe can see that in Algorithm. 2 no additional memory needs to be allocated in principle, since the gate operations\ncan be done in an inplace fashion, and the \u201cexpectation value\u201d on two different states as in Eq.(131) can also be implemented without allocating new memory. Therefore only two copies of the quantum states are required. We can also see that the time complexity of Algorithm. 2 is approximately two times the complexity of the forward evaluation, namely O(2S), since one needs to (backward) evolve the two states |\u03a6m\u3009 and |\u03a8m\u3009 .\nTo this end we stress that the O(2S) scaling for Algorithm. 2 is only an ideal estimation, in which we have implicitly assumed that the complexity of the state |\u03a8j\u3009 is equal to |\u03a6m\u3009 (|\u03a8j\u3009 is not a proper quantum state since H\u0302 may not be unitary in general), which is true for the Schro\u0308dinger simulator but may not be true for other classical simulators. Taking the MPS based simulator for example, the state |\u03a8m\u3009 requires to apply H\u0302 onto |\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009, however, since H\u0302 could be a complex summation of a large number of Pauli strings, the |\u03a8m\u3009would have a much larger bond dimension than |\u03c8(~\u03b8)\u3009 if this operation is performed accurately and the gate operations on |\u03a8m\u3009 has to be simulated with higher complexity. The integration of the MPS based simulator into the automatic differentiation framework has been proposed and implemented in Ref. [485], referred to as the differentiable MPS. It is also possible to generalize Algorithm. 2 to compute the gradients of noisy parametric quantum circuits (but the details of the algorithm have to be significantly modified), as long as the quantum channels are reversible."

To develop a practical near-term quantum computing system, a high level of interaction and collaboration between quantum hardware and these near-term quantum computing techniques is required. Over the last years, crucial theoretical and experimental advancements have been made. To realize the leap from the quantum computational advantage for the sampling task without too much practical use to the application-oriented quantum computational advantage, however, greater efforts are required.\nFirst, more profound research are required to fully grasp the potential of NISQ devices and what is the right goal for the NISQ era. Fortunately, we have seen a shift in the focus of research from an initial blind pursuit to serious consideration of these issues [514]. We need to find the \u201ckiller apps\u201d for NISQ, evaluate the resources they consume, and determine whether they can provide us with speed, accuracy or other advantages (especially whether it will be de quantized [515\u2013 517]), to fully unleash the power of the near-term quantum computing systems.\nSecond, to continually enhance the capabilities quantum computing hardware, and make it grow massively, a large number of cutting-edge experimental techniques should be conquered. For example, advanced processes, materials and\n37\ndesigns are required for the fabrication of quantum computing processors; Dilution refrigerators with larger space and higher cooling power; Cryogenic electronic control techniques; and so on. We believe that the influx of more companies will be of great help to the benign development of the quantum computing industry. Besides, the deep integration of classical and quantum computing is also a preferable way to further enhance the computational power, such as the circuit-cutting method [518, 519].\nThe future quantum computers may shape our daily lives and science and technology in ways that we cannot currently foresee. Near-term quantum computing techniques are crucial to the entire development stage of quantum computing, serving as an enabler from proof-of-principle demonstrations to engineering scaling. In addition, the available NISQ era cloud-based platforms provide great convenience for exploring and developing practical quantum computing algorithms and methods [28, 520]. We expect more young, bright, energetic people entering this field to accelerate the pace of realizing the full promise of quantum computing."
