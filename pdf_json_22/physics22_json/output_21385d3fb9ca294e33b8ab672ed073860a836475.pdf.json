    "abstractText": "The development of the low dislocation density of the Si-based GaAs buffer is considered the key technical route for realizing InAs/GaAs quantum dot lasers for photonic integrated circuits. To prepare the high-quality GaAs layer on the Si substrate, we employed an engineered Ge-buffer on Si, used thermal cycle annealing, and introduced filtering layers, e.g., strained-layer superlattices, to control/reduce the threading dislocation density in the active part of the laser. In this way, a low defect density of 2.9 \u00d7 107 cm\u22122 could be achieved in the GaAs layer with a surface roughness of 1.01 nm. Transmission electron microscopy has been applied to study the effect of cycling, annealing, and filtering layers for blocking or bending threading-dislocation into the InAs QDs active region of the laser. In addition, the dependence of optical properties of InAs QDs on the growth temperature was also investigated. The results show that a density of 3.4 \u00d7 1010 InAs quantum dots could be grown at 450 \u25e6C, and the photoluminescence exhibits emission wavelengths of 1274 nm with a fullwidth at half-maximum (FWHM) equal to 32 nm at room temperature. The laser structure demonstrates a peak at 1.27 \u03bcm with an FWHM equal to 2.6 nm under a continuous-wave operation with a threshold current density of \u223c158 A/cm2 for a 4-\u03bcm narrow-ridge width InAs QD device. This work, therefore, paves the path for a monolithic solution for photonic integrated circuits when III\u2212V light sources (which is required for Si photonics) are grown on a Ge-platform (engineered Ge-buffer on Si) for the integration of the CMOS part with other photonic devices on the same chip in near future.",

            "text": "The Si-based optoelectronic integration chip (OEIC) plays a promising role in cloudbased applications and data centers due to its potential prospects for integrating photonic devices with the mature CMOS technology [1\u20135]. The OEIC systems mainly consist of numerous independent devices, such as: lasers [6,7], modulators [8,9], detectors [10,11], and waveguides [12], etc. From a practical perspective, Si\u2013based, efficient, and reliable light-emitting sources have long been considered as the \u201choly grail\u201d of Si photonics due to the many challenges [13]. Unfortunately, Group-IV semiconductors, such as Si [14], Ge [15,16], and GeSi [17,18], which are widely used in integrated circuits, are inefficient light-emitting materials due to their indirect bandgap. Recently, GeSn materials have\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13101579 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579 2 of 14\ndemonstrated a direct bandgap property, but lasing efficiency at room temperature has still not been demonstrated [19\u201321]. Therefore, low-cost, high-yield, and reliable integrated silicon-based on-chip lasers with emission wavelengths at both 1300 nm (O-band) and 1550 nm (C/L-band) are strongly recommended for realizing the large-scale optoelectronic integration. In contrast, the direct band-gap structure of III\u2013V QD lasers are believed to be the optimal solution for the on-chip integration due to their superior efficiency as a light source [22\u201324]. In particular, self-assembled InAs/GaAs QDs exhibit low-threshold current density, insensitivity to defects, and higher temperature stability, and is widely used as an active optical region for the 1300 nm (O-band) emission spectrum [25,26]. Early studies have reported that direct epitaxial-growth III\u2013V lasers on Si substrates are a promising approach for the cost-effective and high-volume integration of OEICs [27,28]. Nevertheless, the direct epitaxial growth of GaAs materials on Si substrates encounters three major challenges [29]: large lattice mismatch, polarity difference, and thermal expansion mismatch. These problems lead to the formation of threading dislocations (TDs) and antiphase boundaries (APBs), respectively. The TDs that propagate into the active region act as non-radiative carrier recombination centers, reducing minority-carrier lifetimes and, hence, degrade the properties of the photonic device [30,31]. Historically, several attempts were made to avoid APBs, such as using a special offcut substrate [32,33], V-grooved trenches in Si [26,34], and annealing to form double-atom steps on the Si surface. However, even though these methods can eliminate the APB problem, the complexity of the process and the roughness of the GaAs surface cannot meet the requirement for device fabrication and further integration. To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDDs), dislocation filter structures [13,35], a Ge/GeSi buffer layer [36,37], and thermal annealing [38] have been used. Recently, the combined strategy of AlAs nucleation has been demonstrated to grow low TDDs of the GaAs layer on the Si substrate. For instance, Yong-Ho Ko [39] directly grew a low TDD of 2.5 \u00d7 107/cm2 of the GaAs layer on the silicon (001) substrate using a hybrid model comprising of AlAs nucleation and thermal cycle annealing. Siming Chen [24] grew a low TDD of the 105 cm\u22122 order in the III\u2013V epilayers by combining an AlAs-nucleation layer and In0.18Ga0.82As/GaAs-dislocation filter layers with in situ thermal annealing, which realized a low-threshold current density of 62.5 A cm\u22122 s for an InAs/GaAs QD laser. Nevertheless, further progress in lowering the TDD (<107 cm\u22122) of high-crystalline quality GaAs/Si substrates to improve the performance of InAs/GaAs QD lasers is urgently needed. In addition, the integration of III-V lasers with other Ge devices, such as Ge modulators [9] and Ge detectors [10], on a single chip is the core goal of the future silicon-based optoelectronic integration. In this work, we demonstrated a high-quality APB-Free GaAs layer (300 nm) on a Ge buffer grown on 8-inch 6\u25e6off-cut Si (001) substrates using reduced-pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) and metal\u2013organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) tools. The detailed information about the growth has been reported in our previous work [33]. Three sets of strained-layer superlattices (SLSs) were grown as dislocation filter layers (DFLs), and two thermal cycle annealing (TCA) processes were designed to reduce the TDD. Finally, a typical O-band structure with a seven-layer InAs/GaAs dot-in-a-well (DWELL) structure was grown at 420\u2013480 \u25e6C. The effect of the growth temperature on the topography and optical properties of InAs QDs was investigated. The structural integrity, defect formation, lattice distortion, surface roughness, and optical performance were characterized using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), High-resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), and Photoluminescence (PL). This study introduces novel strained-superlattice structures to filter threading dislocations in the InAs/GaAs QD structure as an active part for the O-band emission. A systematic, optimized GaAs-growth and thermal-cycling annealing of the structure reduced the TDD in the GaAs layer to a low level of ~2.9 \u00d7 107 cm\u22122 with a surface roughness of 1 nm. The whole III-V laser structure was grown on an engineered Ge buffer grown on Si. The evolution of the TDD decreased at each stage of the laser structure and was characterized by\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579 3 of 14\nmicroscopic HRTEM and ECCL techniques. The laser structures in this work were grown on a Ge buffer/Si substrate, which may provide a monolithic solution for integrating III\u2013V lasers with Si-based photonics and electronics on a single chip in near future."

Seven layers of InAs/GaAs QDs were monolithically grown on three sets of strained-layer superlattices (SLSs) formed on the engineered Ge buffer on 6\u25e6 off-cut (001) Si substrates. First, a standard cleaning procedure for Si substrates prior to epitaxy were published in [40,41]. Initially, a Ge buffer layer of 1400 nm was grown on 6\u25e6 off-cut Si (001) 200 mm wafers in an RPCVD ASM Epsilon 2000 reactor (ASM Inc., Almere, The Netherlands). The Ge buffer growth was performed at a low temperature of 450 \u25e6C followed by a high temperature of 650 \u25e6C. The first layer had a high defect density due to the nucleation of Ge on Si, while the second layer had a remarkably lower TDD. The Ge buffer underwent thermal annealing at 850 \u25e6C to improve the epitaxial quality. A Chemical Mechanical Polish (CMP) was applied to ensure the surface roughness remained below 1 nm. Later, a 300 nm-GaAs layer was grown, followed by three types of superlattices (Al0.6Ga0.4As/GaAs, In0.1Ga0.9As/GaAs, and In0.13Al0.87As/GaAs) and 7 periods of InAs/GaAs DWELLs, each separated by a 40-nm GaAs spacer layer structure, shown in Figure 1a. The GaAs growth was performed In three steps in a commercial, low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition Reactor (AIXTRON 701900 MOCVD equipment, Germany). The GaAs layer consisted of an 18 nm GaAs nucleation layer at 460 \u25e6C, a 120 nm middle-temperature GaAs buffer layer at 600 \u25e6C, and a 160 nm high-temperature GaAs layer at 680 \u25e6C. To reduce the dislocation density of the GaAs layer, the structures were subjected to cyclic annealing. One annealing cycle involved a period of 750 \u25e6C-hightemperature annealing for 5 min following the 160 nm high-temperature GaAs layer, then reducing the temperature to 350 \u25e6C, after which this TCA process was repeated five times. The second annealing process involved the growth of the HT-GaAs layer to 80 nm at 680 \u25e6C, followed by the one-step five-cycle TCA; then the second group of HT GaAs was grown to another 80 nm at 680 \u25e6C, followed by a second round of the TCA. Each set of the TCA was performed between 350 \u25e6C and 750 \u25e6C under an arsine and hydrogen ambient. Three sets of dislocation filter layers (DFLs) were deposited on the GaAs/Ge/Si (001) substrate using a solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). To suppress the propagation of TDs, a 300 nm thick GaAs main layer and ten periods of Al0.6Ga0.4As (2 nm)/GaAs (2 nm) superlattices (SLs) were both first grown at 580 \u25e6C. In order to further reduce the TDD and flatten the surface, one-repeat In0.1Ga0.9As/GaAs and two-repeat In0.13Al0.87As/GaAs SLs structures were deposited at 470 \u25e6C as DFLs. All the DFLs consisted of ten periods of 10 nm InGa(Al)As strained layers and 10 nm GaAs layers, which were separated by the 200 nm GaAs main layers. Finally, another 100 nm thick GaAs layer was grown at 580 \u25e6C with a growth rate of 0.6 \u00c5/s to further smoothen the surface of the sample. The active InAs/GaAs QD layers were subsequently grown on such GaAs/Ge/Si (001) substrates. First, a standard seven-layer InAs/GaAs DWELL structure was deposited on the GaAs/Ge/Si substrate at 420\u2013480 \u25e6C. Each of the DWELL layers included a 3 ML InAs QD layer, which was sandwiched by a 1.5 nm In0.16Ga0.84As wetting layer and a 4 nm In0.16Ga0.84As capping layer, all grown at 450 \u25e6C. All the DWELLs were separated by 40 nm GaAs spacer layers. Moreover, to increase the quantum efficiency, two layers of 50 nm Al0.35Ga0.65As film were grown above and below the DWELL active region as the carrier confinement layers. Lastly, surface InAs QDs were deposited on the structure with the same growth conditions as the buried ones, for AFM characterization.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579 4 of 14\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x 4 of 14\nAl0.35Ga0.65As film were grown above and below the DWELL active region as the carrier\nconfinement layers.

Figure 3a illustrates the schematic of the growth structure, along with three sets of SLSs. To compare the efficiency of different dislocation filtering approaches, we terminated the GaAs-buffered growth at various stages (labeled A, B, C, D, and E) and subjected the samples to an ECCI analysis. Compared with the etch pits density (EPD) method to measure TD density, the ECCI has been reported to be a more effective technique for estimating the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579 6 of 14\nTDD in GaAs since it is a non-destructive measurement. The ECCI images were shown in Figure 3b where the dislocations were visualized as brightly contrasting marks in the ECCI image. According to the quantitative ECCI scans in Figure 3b, the dislocation density was decreased by 38% after TCA (from 8.4 \u00d7 108 in the labeled A area to 5.2 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 in the labeled B area). First, we identified the ten-period 2 nm Al0.6Ga0.4As/2nm GaAs SLSs as DFLs to block the propagation of threading dislocations from the bottom GaAs layer. As seen from Figure 3b, the labeled C area has a TDD of 1.6 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122, which is significantly lower than that of the labeled B area. Then, the next ten-period 10 nm In0.1Ga0.9As/10 nm GaAs superlattices were inserted to further filter the dislocations labeled D. A remarkable reduction of dislocations to a 107 cm\u22122 magnitude was observed. However, it should be noted that, although a considerable number of TDs were effectively blocked, some small pits still existed at the topmost layer of the GaAs surface. Meanwhile, with the additional growth of two cycles of the ten-period of the 10 nm In0.13Al0.87As/10 nm GaAs SLs structures, a smooth GaAs surface was observed, as shown in Figure 3b, in the labeled E area. A TDD of 2.9 \u00d7 107 cm\u22122 was measured via the ECCI method, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the previous case of inserted DFLs. In conclusion, inserting a superlattice dislocation filter layer is effective at reducing the Si-based GaAs dislocation density.

In Figure 4b\u2013d, the pits on the GaAs surface were decreased to almost none. The mechanism behind the successive improvement is attributable to the SLS dislocation filter layers.

It was also noted that the uniformity was greatly affected and the QD size became larger at a higher temperature. This result\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1579 10 of 14\nis mainly attributed to the low migration and diffusion length of an In adatom at a low growth temperature. A PL analysis at room temperature was performed to evaluate the optical properties of QDs grown at different temperatures, as shown in Figure 8d. In these measurements, a laser (HORIBA iHR550) with a 532 nm wavelength for continuous-wave optical pumping and a liquid nitrogen-cooled InGaAs linear array detector was applied. The results showed that when the growth temperature was increased from 420 \u25e6C to 450 \u25e6C, the wavelength and the intensity of PL spectra are increased; meanwhile, for the sample grown at 480 \u25e6C, the PL intensity strongly decreased. We observed that InAs/GaAs QDs grown at 450 \u25e6C had the best PL intensities among the samples, exhibiting a 1274 nm emission wavelength with a narrower PL emission bandwidth of only 32 nm, which is attributable to the high quality of InAs QDs. Theoretically, the high density of quantum dots grown at a low temperature have a stronger PL peak intensity, but in reality, In atoms deposited at low temperatures are more likely to form giant quantum dots containing defects, which can also offset the material optical quality leading the PL intensity reduction. In addition, the numeral peak of PL spectra also verifies the performance of InAs QDs. For InAs/GaAs QDs grown at 450 \u25e6C, two peak positions were set at 1125 nm and 1274 nm, which were associated with the ground-state and excited-state emissions in the O-band of the telecommunication window. However, a multiple-peak PL spectrum was observed for the samples grown at 420 \u25e6C and 480 \u25e6C, which could be attributed to the non-uniformity of QD sizes. The mechanism behind this could be explained by the optical properties of InAs QDs predominately depending on the formation of strain-induced defects with increasing QD sizes. The S-K growth model of 3D InAs QDs grown on the GaAs substrate was dominant, and it takes advantage of the strain energy generated by the lattice mismatch between materials. The growth temperature had a great influence on the strain relaxation of 3D InAs quantum dots, which affect the bandgap of InAs QDs, showing the red-shift of the wave peak in the PL spectrum. This conclusion also relates to Varshni\u2019s law [46].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x 10 of 14\nattributed to the low migration and diffusion length of an In adatom at a low growth\ntemperature.\nA PL analysis at room temperature was performed to evaluate the optical properties\nof QDs grown at different temperatures, as shown in Figure 8d.

The reduced TDD of the GaAs buffer and t e high quality InAs QD region led to a threshold curr t density of \u223c146A/cm2 and an output power of 12 mW for a 4 \u00b5 \u00d7 1 mm ridge laser under an RT-CW model operation. This work demonstrated highly efficient light sources for photonics, but also offers the possibility of the integration of Si-based optoelectronic with advanced Ge-CMOS devices.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.D.
