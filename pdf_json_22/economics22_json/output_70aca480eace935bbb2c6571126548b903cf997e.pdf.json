    "abstractText": "The association between multi-dimensional deprivation and public health is well established, and many area-based indices have been developed to measure or account for socioeconomic status in health surveillance. The Yost Index, developed in 2001, has been adopted in the US for cancer surveillance and is based on the combination of two heavily weighted (household income, poverty) and five lightly weighted (rent, home value, employment, education and working class) indicator variables. Our objectives were to 1) update indicators and find a more parsimonious version of the Yost Index by examining potential models that included indicators with more balanced weights/influence and reduced redundancy and 2) test the statistical consistency of the factor upon which the Yost Index is based. Despite the usefulness of the Yost Index, a one-factor structure including all seven Yost indicator variables is not statistically reliable and should be replaced with a three-factor model to include the true variability of all seven indicator variables. To find a one-dimensional alternative, we conducted maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis on a subset of all possible combinations of fourteen indicator variables to find well-fitted one-dimensional factor models and completed confirmatory factor analysis on the resulting models. One indicator combination (poverty, education, employment, public assistance) emerged as the most stable unidimensional model. This model is more robust to extremes in local cost of living conditions, is comprised of ACS variables that rarely require imputation by the enduser and is a more parsimonious solution than the Yost index with a true one-factor structure. .

It has been long established in the literature that social determinants of health and multi-dimensional deprivation are strongly associated with health outcomes (Gilbert et al. 2003, Braveman et al. 2010, Phillips et al. 2016, Glassman 2019, Singu et al. 2020). Area based deprivation indices are a common method used to approximate affluence, particularly for the purpose of allocating funding or determining relationships in public health. They are especially valuable when individual level data are not available. The intent of these indices is to estimate relative deprivation for a given geography using a multidimensional approach to approximate social position and material access (Schuurman et al. 2007, Boscoe et al. 2021). The multidimensional nature ensures that the indices capture sources of deprivation beyond income and are less sensitive to measurement bias than univariate measures of affluence (Bryere et al. 2017, Glassman 2019). Indicators surrounding economic status (e.g., income, poverty), housing (home value, rent/mortgage, crowding, technology), social network (e.g., marital status, citizenship), employment, education and mobility are typically included in an index, although the number of indicators varies widely (Glassman 2021). The Yost Index was introduced in 2001 (Yost et al. 2001) and has since been adopted in the US for cancer surveillance (Boscoe et al. 2021). It employs seven indicators: median household income, median house value, median gross rent, percent below 150% poverty, working class and percent unemployed, all of which are derived from US Census or American Community Survey data (National Cancer Institute 2021). It is most strongly influenced by measures of wealth (i.e. median household income, poverty, Table 1, Yu et al. 2014, Boscoe et al. 2021). The Yost Index was developed twenty years ago. Indices and their indicator variables can stale as conditions change; updates to indices should consider new indicators that may be more relevant considering evolving technologies and economics. For example, working class may be redundant to income and education, and the occupation classification system is susceptible to changes in career classification rules and diverse earning potentials within each class. Housing cost/value is temporally volatile, spatially autocorrelated, and may bias index values for areas with very high or very low cost of living. Instead, income disparity measures such as the Gini Index or housing cost burden (% of income dedicated to housing) might be indicative of disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) under various neighborhood and census tract economic and developmental conditions (Liao and De Maio 2021). Citizenship, nativity, and language proficiency, which are included in some deprivation indices (Guillaume et al. 2016), all influence access to resources and social networks and might be considered a source or covariate of affluence or deprivation. Access to plumbing and home telephone are components of some deprivation indices (Guillaume et al. 2016, Glassman 2019, Berg et al. 2021) and are likely relevant in many developing situations; these may be analogous to owning a laptop/desktop computer in the United States. Poor health is a form of deprivation; access to health insurance might be used as a proxy for health since health measures are not included in the ACS data (Glassman 2021). The need for public assistance/government benefits should also be considered (Deas et al. 2003, Phillips et al. 2016); application for public assistance is a nuanced process that might better inform an index than simple household income or poverty. The weights applied to the indicators when calculating the index are just as important as the indicators themselves. If the weights are incorrectly calculated, the resulting index may not be measuring what it purports to measure. Weights for composite indices can be determined through a variety of techniques including \u201csubjective/arbitrary\u201d weighting based on expert opinion or survey or empirical weighting wherein analysts use multivariate regression or factor analysis to model a latent variable of interest (e.g. .

            "text": "The association between multi-dimensional deprivation and public health is well established, and many area-based indices have been developed to measure or account for socioeconomic status in health surveillance. The Yost Index, developed in 2001, has been adopted in the US for cancer surveillance and is based on the combination of two heavily weighted (household income, poverty) and five lightly weighted (rent, home value, employment, education and working class) indicator variables. Our objectives were to 1) update indicators and find a more parsimonious version of the Yost Index by examining potential models that included indicators with more balanced weights/influence and reduced redundancy and 2) test the statistical consistency of the factor upon which the Yost Index is based. Despite the usefulness of the Yost Index, a one-factor structure including all seven Yost indicator variables is not statistically reliable and should be replaced with a three-factor model to include the true variability of all seven indicator variables. To find a one-dimensional alternative, we conducted maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis on a subset of all possible combinations of fourteen indicator variables to find well-fitted one-dimensional factor models and completed confirmatory factor analysis on the resulting models. One indicator combination (poverty, education, employment, public assistance) emerged as the most stable unidimensional model. This model is more robust to extremes in local cost of living conditions, is comprised of ACS variables that rarely require imputation by the enduser and is a more parsimonious solution than the Yost index with a true one-factor structure.\nNOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nIt has been long established in the literature that social determinants of health and multi-dimensional deprivation are strongly associated with health outcomes (Gilbert et al. 2003, Braveman et al. 2010, Phillips et al. 2016, Glassman 2019, Singu et al. 2020). Area based deprivation indices are a common method used to approximate affluence, particularly for the purpose of allocating funding or determining relationships in public health. They are especially valuable when individual level data are not available. The intent of these indices is to estimate relative deprivation for a given geography using a multidimensional approach to approximate social position and material access (Schuurman et al. 2007, Boscoe et al. 2021). The multidimensional nature ensures that the indices capture sources of deprivation beyond income and are less sensitive to measurement bias than univariate measures of affluence (Bryere et al. 2017, Glassman 2019). Indicators surrounding economic status (e.g., income, poverty), housing (home value, rent/mortgage, crowding, technology), social network (e.g., marital status, citizenship), employment, education and mobility are typically included in an index, although the number of indicators varies widely (Glassman 2021).\nThe Yost Index was introduced in 2001 (Yost et al. 2001) and has since been adopted in the US for cancer surveillance (Boscoe et al. 2021). It employs seven indicators: median household income, median house value, median gross rent, percent below 150% poverty, working class and percent unemployed, all of which are derived from US Census or American Community Survey data (National Cancer Institute 2021). It is most strongly influenced by measures of wealth (i.e. median household income, poverty, Table 1, Yu et al. 2014, Boscoe et al. 2021).\nThe Yost Index was developed twenty years ago. Indices and their indicator variables can stale as conditions change; updates to indices should consider new indicators that may be more relevant considering evolving technologies and economics. For example, working class may be redundant to income and education, and the occupation classification system is susceptible to changes in career classification rules and diverse earning potentials within each class. Housing cost/value is temporally volatile, spatially autocorrelated, and may bias index values for areas with very high or very low cost of living. Instead, income disparity measures such as the Gini Index or housing cost burden (% of income dedicated to housing) might be indicative of disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) under various neighborhood and census tract economic and developmental conditions (Liao and De Maio 2021). Citizenship, nativity, and language proficiency, which are included in some deprivation indices (Guillaume et al. 2016), all influence access to resources and social networks and might be considered a source or covariate of affluence or deprivation. Access to plumbing and home telephone are components of some deprivation indices (Guillaume et al. 2016, Glassman 2019, Berg et al. 2021) and are likely relevant in many developing situations; these may be analogous to owning a laptop/desktop computer in the United States. Poor health is a form of deprivation; access to health insurance might be used as a proxy for health since health measures are not included in the ACS data (Glassman 2021). The need for public assistance/government benefits should also be considered (Deas et al. 2003, Phillips et al. 2016); application for public assistance is a nuanced process that might better inform an index than simple household income or poverty.\nThe weights applied to the indicators when calculating the index are just as important as the indicators themselves. If the weights are incorrectly calculated, the resulting index may not be measuring what it purports to measure. Weights for composite indices can be determined through a variety of techniques including \u201csubjective/arbitrary\u201d weighting based on expert opinion or survey or empirical weighting wherein analysts use multivariate regression or factor analysis to model a latent variable of interest (e.g.\ndeprivation, SES) using various indicators/measured variables (Cowan et al. 2012, Mazziotta and Pareto 2013). The Yost Index uses indicator weights based on beta weights/factor loadings resulting from onecomponent principal components analysis or one-factor factor analysis (Yost et al. 2001, Yu et al. 2014). The fact that the Yost Index is dominated by monetary indicators (poverty, household income, Table 1) may indicate that the indicators included in the Yost index are not unidimensional and may require more than one factor to describe their overall variance. That is, a one-factor model may not be internally consistent/have a statistically reliable fit. This would not be unprecedented- recently, Berg et al. (2021) reported that the Area Deprivation Index, originally based on a unidimensional structure, did not fit one dimension. They revised ADI to the ADI-3 to include three factors rather than one and achieved better internal consistency and fit in the model."

We calculated Yost variables according to the SEER Yost index guidelines on their variables webpage\nhttps://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/time-dependent.html and additional potential indicators as detailed in Table 2.\nWe further pre-processed the ACS data according to Boscoe et al. (2021). Briefly, tracts with greater than 1/3 of the population represented by group quarters, tracts with populations less than 100 or with less than 30 housing units (1988), and tracts with more than three missings (2) were removed with the resulting number of tracts equaling 71066. Of the tracts remaining, 1964 (~3%) had at least one missing value, a number of which were median home value, which, if removed in pair or row-wise calculations, would exclude census tracts comprised of public housing and primarily rentals. Thus, while 3% is a small number of missing values, we felt it critical to include all possible tracts by imputing missing data. Missing values were imputed five times using the classification and regression tree (\u201ccart\u201d) method in the mice package in R (Van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2021) and we pooled the completed datasets for further analysis. We chose not to perform analysis on all five separate datasets due to the computational expense of the grid search planned, complexity of combining within and between variances for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and the small percentage of tracts with missing values.\nWe subsampled the resulting data to provide two distinct datasets for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Ideally, a completely new sample on the same population would be obtained to provide separate datasets for EFA and CFA (Gerbing and Hamilton 1996, Hurley et al. 1997), however, the nature of ACS data did not allow this. A distinct five-year time frame was not available to us because the number of computers variable was not included in the ACS until 2013. As a compromise, we randomly sampled states rather than random tracts for inclusion in the EFA or CFA subsample, with the assumption that spatial autocorrelation within states would provide for some differentiation between the two subsamples. The EFA subsample included 25 states and the District of Columbia (34221 census tracts) and the CFA sampled included 25 states (36845 census tracts). All data were rank transformed within sample immediately prior to factor analysis to standardize across variable units and suppress the effects of potential outliers (Yu et al. 2014, Boscoe et al. 2021). Indicator variables that were negatively correlated with deprivation (household income, gross rent, home value and education) were reverse-coded (negated) to ensure positive factor loadings."

We removed combinations with less than four indicator variables to avoid non-identification by CFA later. We also limited the combinations to those that contained at least one measure of wealth (household income or poverty). We performed one-factor maximum likelihood EFA with oblique rotation on the remaining indicator combinations with the EFA states subsample data using the fa() function. Beta weights were determined using the regression method. We retained potential models based on a) good fit based on at least two fit indices (Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) > 0.90, fit > 0.85, corrected root mean square (CRMS) < 0.05) and RMSEA < 0.08 (Shi et al. 2019), b) balance across beta weights (all beta weights > .05 and < 0.5), and c) indicators for the factor included the three components of SES or highly correlated variables (income as household income or poverty, employment, and education as\neducation status or computer ownership). None of the models met the assumption of multivariate normality; however, with a sample size of greater than 30,000, we relied on the central limit theorem and used fit statistics that are robust to both large sample sizes and violation of the normality assumption (Shi et al. 2019, Revelle 2021)."

Because the \u03a72 statistic is overpowered with a sample size of just under 30,000, we also randomly sampled (without replacement) the training dataset 80 times and conducted the CFA analysis on each subsample to ensure that reliability statistics were stable on large and smaller (n ~ 335) samples. We then checked for factor loading consistency and correlation between the final index values for train and test data models. We calculated final index values according to Boscoe et al. (2021) by grouping the factor scores into percentile values. An index value (percentile) of 100 is the least affluent, 1 is the most affluent.\nWe further reduced models to those with consistent train/test loadings, the comparative fit index (CFI )> 0.95, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < 0.08, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08 (Schermelleh-Engel et al. 2003, Shi et al. 2019).

We chose these variables because they have been associated with socioeconomic status in the literature (Gilbert et al. 2003, Braveman et al. 2010, Seerig et al. 2015).

            "text": "To further check convergent external validity of Model One, we wanted to associate the index to a completely different, but related dataset (Hair et al. 2002). We included the Yost Index value associations for comparison. Using the modeled tract level human health data from the CDC PLACES dataset (Centers for Disease Control et al. 2020), we were able to relate Model One and Yost index values to public health measures at the tract level (Table 9). Relationships between Model One and mental health, physical health, teeth loss, and access to leisure time physical activity were quite strong; however, the relationships were usually slightly stronger with the Yost Index. Preventative measures, which tend to be less accessible to those of lower SES (Singu et al. 2020) were more strongly related to Model One; however, relationships between these health measures and our index and the Yost Index were a bit weak, apart from dental visits (Table 9).\nFinally, we compared the Model One and Yost index values (ACS 2015-2019) using ols regression and investigated outliers to better understand how the models differ. We considered a difference in index values of greater than 30 percentiles to be \u201cpoor agreement\u201d (Boscoe et al. 2021). The difference between Model One and Yost index values exceeded 30 percentiles in 500 census tracts (0.7%), 70.2% of which were tracts in California or New York. We randomly selected ten of these census tracts to investigate (Table 10). In general, census tracts estimated to be less affluent by the Yost index but a higher level of affluence by the Model One index were associated with areas with low cost of housing and/or low income, but with low poverty and/or low public assistance use, such as retirement communities. Census tracts with a more affluent Yost index than Model One index value were commonly located in primarily working-class neighborhoods with very high cost of living/home value/rent and high public assistance.\nDiscussion\nChanging technologies and economics require re-evaluation and potential revision of SES and other indices over time. Such index updates should be based on reliable and reproducible methods such as empirical analysis or \u201csubjective\u201d methods. Of the many methods one could use, we chose to include many ACS derived potential indicators that are related to SES in a grid search to find the best-fit singlefactor structure to describe the latent variable deprivation/SES/affluence. We limited ourselves to one factor in the interest of simplicity, parsimony, ease of replication, and utility for the public health communities. The Model One Index we developed is a spatially and temporally reliable index based on a statistically valid factor with poverty, education, public assistance, and unemployment as indicators. Both the Model One and Yost Indices correlate well with at least some health measures associated with affluence including tooth loss, self-assessed mental and physical health, access to leisure physical activity and diabetes.\nAs it is, the Yost index is a valuable covariate that improves model fit or helps to explain relationships between SES and healthcare and/or outcomes (Butler et al. 2020, Li et al. 2021, Liu et al. 2021); however, the Yost Index is based on a statistically unreliable one-factor structure with unbalanced weights. Inclusion of low weighted indicators (e.g., working class, unemployment, education) gives the impression that those indicators do little to predict the latent variable; however, if all relevant factors are considered, they are influential. To include the explanatory power of working class, unemployment and other low weighted indicators, the Yost Index should be based on a three-dimensional structure. Thus, while the Yost Index, as a black box model, has value, it is more valid to call the indicator weights subjective- based on expert opinion, than to call them factor analysis beta weights. Despite its statistical faults, the Yost Index seems to be well associated with deprivation and is also well correlated with SES related human health measures.\nThe index output of our proposed model (Model One) and the Yost Index are quite similar. When comparing poor agreement index values for tracts, the main differences are a function of housing cost, and possibly cost of living as a result. Working class neighborhoods in LA County, for example, have a higher affluence rating than they would on the Model One index due to the extremely high housing costs in that portion of California. Retirement communities in FL and AZ exemplify tracts where the Model One index indicates higher affluence than the Yost index; citizens may be living on fixed incomes, but they are differentiated from actual impoverished locations by the low poverty levels and low public assistance. The Yost index is sensitive to regional housing costs because it employs two housing cost variables, both of which are likely to influence local household incomes. The Model One index is likely sensitive to local politics due to its reliance on ACS survey participant disclosure of public assistance. While public assistance in the index seems to control for cost-of-living disparities, if participants do not request/disclose public assistance, the results will be skewed. Both indices may be better on a regional scale since home values and public opinion are generally spatially autocorrelated.\nWhile they are similar, overall, the Model One Index has advantages over the Yost Index on a large geographical scale. The Model One Index is more robust to extremes in local cost of living conditions, is comprised of ACS variables that rarely, if ever, require imputation by the end-user, and is a more parsimonious solution with a true one-factor structure. However, there are many deprivation indices in the literature; the choice of index will likely depend on the researcher\u2019s definition of socioeconomic status and deprivation.\nLimitations and Future Work\nBy forcing a one factor structure, we necessitated correlation among the indicators included in the final model. Although the simplicity of the final index enhances utility, this approach may have limited the potential descriptive ability of the index; many potential indicators of deprivation are not strongly correlated with wealth, employment, or education. Using structural equation modeling to allow for more than one factor may provide a more descriptive index of deprivation.\nRank transformation of the ACS data prior to scaling and modeling results in a loss of information, but a gain in outlier suppression. Rank transformed data do not correlate as well over time as do raw data, and we may have lost some temporal transferability by ranking the raw data while developing Model One. While Model One does seem to perform well over time, its performance may be even better if using raw data. An investigation into the effects of rank transformation would benefit the index and development of such indices in the future.\nThe US Census ACS data are not perfect and have inherent variability. We did not incorporate this potential source of uncertainty in our models. Boscoe et al. (in press) calculated confidence intervals around the Yost Index values using ACS variance replicate tables and reported that the index at the percentile level may be misleading due to uncertainty around the Yost Index values. The average tract index estimate precision was +/- eight percentiles, but some tracts, especially tracts near the median, had much larger confidence intervals. Future work on Model One should incorporate uncertainty in the data."
