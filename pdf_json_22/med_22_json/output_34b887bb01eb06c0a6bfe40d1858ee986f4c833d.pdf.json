    "abstractText": "Introduction: A physiological feedback system exists between hepatocytes and the alpha cells termed the liver-alpha cell axis and signifies the role between amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion and glucagon-stimulated amino acid catabolism. Several reports indicate that metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) disrupts this feedback system, because of impaired glucagon receptor (GCGR) signaling (glucagon resistance). However, no experimental test exists to assess glucagon resistance in humans. Objective: To develop and evaluate a test for measuring glucagon sensitivity towards amino acid and glucose metabolism in humans. Methods and analysis: The study protocol is based on several pilot studies presented in this paper. The study will include 65 participants including 20 individuals with a BMI 18.6-25 kg/m, 30 individuals with a BMI \u226525-40 kg/m, and 15 individuals with type 1 diabetes with a BMI between 18.6-40 kg/m. Participants will be grouped according to their percentage of hepatic steatosis measured by whole-liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary outcome measure will be differences in a novel \u2018glucagon sensitivity\u2019 index between individuals with and without hepatic steatosis (<5.6 % vs \u22655.6 %) without diabetes. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences regarding the glucagon-alanineindex, incremental and decremental area under the curve (AUC) and association analyses between hepatic steatosis and glucagon sensitivity. This report describes the design of the cross-sectional study currently taking place at Copenhagen University hospital Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg. Results: These data will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific conferences. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the scientific-ethical committee of the Capital region of Denmark (H-20023717) and registered with Danish Data protection Agency (P-2021-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04907721). Written and oral consent will be obtained from all participants, and the study will adhere to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

            "text": "Introduction: A physiological feedback system exists between hepatocytes and the alpha cells termed the liver-alpha cell axis and signifies the role between amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion and glucagon-stimulated amino acid catabolism. Several reports indicate that metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) disrupts this feedback system, because of impaired glucagon receptor (GCGR) signaling (glucagon resistance). However, no experimental test exists to assess glucagon resistance in humans.\nObjective: To develop and evaluate a test for measuring glucagon sensitivity towards amino acid and glucose metabolism in humans.\nMethods and analysis: The study protocol is based on several pilot studies presented in this paper. The study will include 65 participants including 20 individuals with a BMI 18.6-25 kg/m2, 30 individuals with a BMI \u226525-40 kg/m2, and 15 individuals with type 1 diabetes with a BMI between 18.6-40 kg/m2. Participants will be grouped according to their percentage of hepatic steatosis measured by whole-liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary outcome measure will be differences in a novel \u2018glucagon sensitivity\u2019 index between individuals with and without hepatic steatosis (<5.6 % vs \u22655.6 %) without diabetes. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences regarding the glucagon-alanineindex, incremental and decremental area under the curve (AUC) and association analyses between hepatic steatosis and glucagon sensitivity. This report describes the design of the cross-sectional study currently taking place at Copenhagen University hospital Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg.\nResults: These data will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific conferences.\nEthics and dissemination: The study was approved by the scientific-ethical committee of the Capital region of Denmark (H-20023717) and registered with Danish Data protection Agency (P-2021-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04907721). Written and oral consent will be obtained from all participants, and the study will adhere to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nStrengths and limitations of this study:\n\u2022 The glucagon sensitivity test is based on several pilot experiments \u2022 Liver fat is based on whole-liver imaging and not region of interest (ROI) \u2022 The glucagon sensitivity test may be limited to assess glucagon sensitivity towards\namino acid catabolism and glucose production\n\u2022 The glucagon sensitivity test does not use amino acid or glucose tracers which\nexpands the generalizability of such test but also may impair its accuracy\nKeywords: NAFLD; type 1 diabetes; metabolism; glucagon; amino acids; the liver-alpha cell axis; study protocol."

            "text": "Glucagon regulates amino acid turnover and amino acids may control glucagon secretion (1- 3) in a feedback loop recently termed the liver-alpha cell axis (4). Pharmacological disruption of glucagon receptor (GCGR) signaling leads to increased plasma concentrations of amino acids (hyperaminoacidemia) and glucagon (hyperglucagonemia) in animals (5-12). This phenotype is also evident in rodents with hepatic steatosis (7) and, importantly, in humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (13, 14). Hyperglucagonemia and hyperaminoacidemia are believed result from a disrupted liver-alpha cell axis by which glucagon-stimulated amino acid catabolism is reduced and leads to hyperaminoacidemia, which, via known and unknown mechanisms, stimulates glucagon secretion from the alpha cells. NAFLD may impair glucagon\u2019s effect on amino acid metabolism i.e., reduce glucagon sensitivity.\nOur study protocol includes two experimental days, designed to evaluate the impact of both exogenous and endogenous glucagon on amino acid metabolism. Glucagon sensitivity will be evaluated using the glucagon-alanine index and a novel glucagon sensitivity index, described here. We will apply this test in patients with and without NAFLD and in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The latter group will serve as a model to investigate the dependency of varying insulin concentrations on the results of the test. The duration and dose of the amino acid infusion and glucagon injection included in our study protocol are based on previous human studies (15-17) and pilot studies presented here. The pilot studies were conducted in healthy individuals, where amino acid infusion rates, doses of glucagon infusions and sampling time have been evaluated. Furthermore, effects of single bolus injections of glucagon given during both fasted and non-fasted conditions are presented in this paper."

Nine pilot studies were conducted (named pilot studies 1-9).\nIn the first two pilot studies, a low dose of mixed amino acids (Vamin 14 g/l Electrolyte Free, catalog no. B05ABA01; Fresenius Kabi, Copenhagen, Denmark, 292 mg/kg BW/hour) was administered intravenously for 30 min in pilot study 1 and for 45 min in pilot study 2. A bolus injection of glucagon (1 mg) was administered 30 min after the amino acid infusion was stopped in pilot study 1, while a bolus injection of glucagon (0.5 mg) was given immediately after the amino acid infusion was stopped at time 45 min in pilot study 2. Two healthy individuals underwent pilot study 1 and 2 with one person completing both pilot studies. The purpose of pilot study 1 and 2 was to determine whether exogenous glucagon could accelerate amino acids disappearance, to evaluate dosing of glucagon and to identify a steady state plateau for plasma amino acids.\nThe same three healthy individuals completed pilot studies 3-6 (overview shown in Figure 3). In pilot studies 3-5, subjects received a high rate amino acid infusion of 370 mg/kg bw/hour similar to a previous report (18) from time 0-90 min. A bolus injection of glucagon (0.2 mg) was given at time 60 min (during the amino acid infusion) in pilot study 3 and at time 90 min (immediately after the amino acid infusion was stopped) in pilot study 4. In pilot study 6, amino acids were infused at a lower rate (331 mg/kg BW/hour) from 0-90 min equivalent to the middle of the two amino acid infusions investigated in pilot study 1 and 3. Three individuals completed the final pilot studies 7-9 in different order. Pilot study 7 consisted of a bolus injection of glucagon (0.2 mg) following an overnight fast, while in pilot study 8 participants ingested a breakfast two hours prior to a bolus injection of glucagon (0.2 mg). Pilot study 9 consisted of a saline following an overnight fast. No statistical analysis has been made of the pilot studies due to low sample size (n = 2-3).\nFigure 1\nFigure 2\nFigure 3\nFigure 4\nFigure 5"

            "text": "Plasma amino acid levels were measured in pilot study 1 and 2 (Figure 1A-1B). When comparing the two pilot studies, it appeared that a bolus injection of glucagon accelerated the fall in plasma levels of amino acids following a state of high substrate availability (Figure 1C). Amino acid levels increased by 1.7 mmol/L to a peak value of 3.4 mmol/L, while endogenous glucagon levels increased by 12 pmol/L (from baseline to 16 pmol/L; data not shown). The increase in plasma levels of amino acids was comparable to those obtained in previous studies (19) following the ingestion of a protein-rich meal. This prompted us to explore the use of a higher amino acid infusion rate since between-group comparisons would become more apparent when evaluating larger responses. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin and C-peptide invariably increased in response to exogenous glucagon in pilot study 1 and 2 (Figure 2A-F), however, a larger increase was evident in pilot study 1 when plasma levels of amino acid levels were lowered (2.4 mmol/L vs 3.2 mmol/L in pilot study 2).\nIn pilot studies 3-6, we further explored glucagon in combination with an amino acid infusion and increased the amino acid infusion rate to a rate previously administered in humans (18)\nand lowered the bolus infusion of glucagon to 0.2 mg (Figure 4A-P) due to mild nausea. Exogenous glucagon administered during (time 60 min; Figure 4A), but also immediately after (time 90 min; Figure 4E) the amino acid infusion (infused from time 0-90 min), did not alter plasma levels of amino acids when compared to the amino acid infusion alone (Figure 4I).\nNext, we evaluated differences in metabolic parameters with the three amino acid infusion rates used in pilot studies 1, 2, 5 and 6 shown as baseline-subtracted (delta) values (Figure 5A-E). A low infusion rate of 292 mg/hour/kg bw was used in pilot studies 1 and 2, while a medium (331 mg/hour/kg bw) and high (370 mg/hour/kg bw) infusion rate was used in pilot studies 6 and 5. Plasma levels of amino acids increased dose-dependently, however, only a minor (if any) increase was observed when comparing the medium and high infusion rate (Figure 5A). Similarly, glucagon increased dose-dependently with the amino acid infusion rates, with little to no additional effect from the medium to high infusion rate (Figure 5C). A biphasic glucose response was observed for the medium and high amino acid infusion rates with an initial increase followed by a drop below baseline (Figure 5B). Finally, insulin and cpeptide increased dose-dependently with the amino acid infusion rates (Figure 5D-E).\nThe same three individuals completed (in different order) pilot studies 7-9, consisting of a bolus injection of saline or glucagon after an overnight fast or glucagon two hours after a breakfast meal. In pilot study 9 (breakfast + glucagon), subjects are considered to be in the fed state as indicated by increased plasma levels of insulin at baseline (248 pmol/L following breakfast vs 45 pmol/L after an overnight fast). Plasma levels of amino acids fell following exogenous glucagon independently of the fed and fasted state. Plasma glucose levels increased following exogenous glucagon (Figure 6C-D); however, this increase was almost abolished following the breakfast meal, presumably because of the increased plasma insulin levels at baseline (Figure 6E-F). Plasma levels of urea did not fall to the same extent following exogenous glucagon (Figure 6G).\nFigure 6"

            "text": "Plasma levels of amino acids decreased following a bolus injection of glucagon compared to saline (Figure 1).\nBolus injection of 0.2 mg glucagon caused a supra-physiological plasma glucagon level of 2000 pmol/L (Figure 4B and 4F) and maximum responses to glucagon are most likely reached at exogenous glucagon doses of 0.2 mg or lower.\nPlasma levels of glucose increased more in response to glucagon when plasma levels of amino acids were low (43-50%; in pilot study 1 and 7) compared to high (21-33%; in pilot study 2, 3 and 4), presumably due to the amino acid-stimulated increase in insulin levels and subsequent insulin-stimulated tissue uptake of glucose. An increased glucagon dose did not change this since pilot study 2 (0.5 mg glucagon) elicited a 21% increase in glucose, while pilot study 4 (0.2 mg glucagon) elicited a 43% increase in glucose.\nWhen evaluating changes in plasma amino acid levels with exogenous glucagon, amino acids only decreased when individuals had not been subjected to a very high amino acid infusion rate. Pilot study 3 and 4 show that exogenous glucagon had no effect on amino acid clearance both during and following a high amino acid infusion rate, while a reduction in plasma amino acid levels was evident in pilot study 2, 7 and 9 following a low amino acid infusion rate or no amino acid infusion at all. This difference may be the result of saturation of the GCGR, i.e., maximal stimulation of ureagenesis by the amino acid-stimulated secretion of endogenous glucagon rendering additional exogenous glucagon incapable of further increasing ureagenesis. Based on these observations, we decided that the GLUSENTIC protocol should consist of two experimental days with the aim of examining the effect of both exogenous and endogenous (amino acid-stimulated) glucagon in individuals with and without NAFLD. In prospective studies it may turn out that glucagon sensitivity may be adequately evaluated based on a single glucagon injection."

Increased concentrations of glucagon (hyperglucagonemia), as seen in some individuals with type 2 diabetes, contributes to hyperglycemia. A test to evaluate glucagon sensitivity could be important to predict the development of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity measurements have historically had significant impact on our way of interpreting metabolic dysfunction and diabetes, and a test for evaluating glucagon sensitivity may similarly prove to be an important tool. Based on the literature, we find that developing and evaluating a test for measuring hepatic glucagon sensitivity will be important for the understanding of glucagon biology and liver disease.\nDiscomfort and risk of complications are expected to be minimal. The study will not benefit the individual participant; however, the results could prove beneficial for future patients suspected of liver disease.
