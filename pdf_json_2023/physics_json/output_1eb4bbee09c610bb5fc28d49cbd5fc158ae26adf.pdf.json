    "abstractText": "Transition metal-catalyzed C\u2013H bond functionalization is an important method in organic synthesis, but the development of methods that are lower cost and have a less environmental impact is desirable. Here, a Cu-catalyzed asymmetric C(sp)\u2013H arylation is reported. With diaryliodonium salts as arylating reagents, a range of ortho-arylated P-chiral phosphonic diamides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee). Meanwhile, enantioselective C-3 arylation of diarylphosphine oxide indoles was also realized under similar conditions to construct axial chirality.",

            "text": "arylation for the synthesis of P- and axially chiral phosphorus compounds\nShao-Bai Yan1, Rui Wang1, Zha-Gen Li1, An-Na Li1, Chuanyong Wang1 & Wei-Liang Duan 1,2,3\nTransition metal-catalyzed C\u2013H bond functionalization is an important method in organic synthesis, but the development of methods that are lower cost and have a less environmental impact is desirable. Here, a Cu-catalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)\u2013H arylation is reported. With diaryliodonium salts as arylating reagents, a range of ortho-arylated P-chiral phosphonic diamides were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee). Meanwhile, enantioselective C-3 arylation of diarylphosphine oxide indoles was also realized under similar conditions to construct axial chirality.\nTransitionmetal-catalyzed C\u2013Hbond functionalization has become an important methodology for organic synthesis in terms of atom economy and step economy1\u20134. Over the past several decades, elegant and efficient palladium-, rhodium-, iridium-, and ruthenium-catalyzed transformations for the stereoselective construction of C\u2013C and/or C\u2013X bonds through C\u2013H activation have been well exploited5\u20138. In these well-established methodologies, two general strategies have been followed to achieve enantiocontrol: (1) enantio-determining activation of enantiotopic C\u2013H bonds by chiral transition metal complexes; (2) unbiased C\u2013H bond scission followed by stereochemistrygenerating incorporation of coupling partners. To realize those transformations, many chiral ligands and catalysts have been developed to achieve excellent selectivity9\u201313. On the other hand, a costeffective and environmentally benign method to selectively activate inert C\u2013H bonds is still desirable in this field.\nFirst-row metals are more earth-abundant and less toxic than precious 4d and 5dmetals. Recently, the utilization of these 3d metals to activate omnipresent C\u2013H bonds, especially enantioselectively, has gained increasing interest from chemists14\u201328. Hou and coworkers developed chiral cyclopentadienyl scandium complexes to catalyze enantioselective transformations, including C\u2013H addition of pyridines to olefins16, C\u2013H alkylation of imidazoles with 1,1-disubstituted alkenes17 and C\u2013H alkenylation of ferrocenes with alkynes18. In 2017, Butensch\u00f6n revealed an iron-catalyzed arylation of ferrocenamide with moderate enantioselectivities using (R,R)-chiraphos as the ligand19. Cramer and coworkers reported nickel-catalyzed asymmetric\ncyclization of pyridone derivatives with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as the chiral source20. Despite significant achievements in the literature, inexpensive 3d metal-catalyzed asymmetric C\u2013H activation is still in its infancy. Furthermore, alkenes and alkynes are the most commonly used coupling partners in reports to date, and examples of C\u2013H arylation are quite scarce. Palladium, rhodium, and iridium are commonly used transition metals in directed enantioselective C\u2013H arylation reactions (Fig. 1a).\nCopper, which constitutes approximately 0.01% of the Earth\u2019s crust, has three main oxidation states ranging from 0 to +3, making it more properly a 3dmetal in transformations involving radicals or twoelectron transfer29,30. Recently, Liu and others developed a Cucatalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)\u2013H functionalization involving radicals with impressive enantioselectivities (Fig. 1b)31,32. Cu-catalyzed C\u2013H arylation of heteroarenes with aryl iodides was first reported by Daugulis, Miura, and Ackermann33\u201336. Since then, Cu-catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization has made considerable progress in the construction of C\u2013C and C\u2013X bonds37\u201343. For example, Yu reported a Cu-catalyzed ortho-arylation of carboxamides directed by oxazoline-based bidentate groups in 201444. Although research on Cu-catalyzed C\u2013H functionalization, including arylation, alkylation, nitrogenation, halogenation, and so on, has surged in recent years, asymmetric transformations remain poorly developed. In 2016, Sawamura\u2019s group published their work on Cu-catalyzed asymmetric allyl phosphate substitution by azoles to construct all-carbon quaternary stereocenters (Fig. 1c)45. A designed chiral NHC ligand was used to generate\nReceived: 11 October 2022\nAccepted: 4 April 2023\nCheck for updates\n1College of Chemistry andChemical Engineering, Yangzhou University, 180 Siwangting Road, 225002 Yangzhou, China. 2College of Chemistry andChemical Engineering, Inner Mongolia University, 235West University Street, 010021 Hohhot, China. 3School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, 620 Xi Changan Street, 710119 Xi\u2019an, China. e-mail: duanwl@yzu.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2264 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nexcellent branch regioselectivity and enantiocontrol, but C\u2013H bond cleavage was not the enantio-determining step. Dai and Yu attempted Cu-mediated diastereoselective C\u2013H thiolation of ferrocenes utilizing a chiral oxazoline bidentate directing group in 201846.\nIn 2008, Gaunt found that diaryliodonium salts could serve as arylating reagents in the copper-catalyzed C\u2013H arylation of indoles, and an acetyl moiety on the N atom switched the regioselectivity from C3 to C247. The author proposed that a highly electrophilic aryl\u2013Cu(III) intermediate was essential to the reactivity. Several groups extended this methodology, and diaryliodonium salts were proven to be powerful arylating reagents for the C\u2013H bond functionalization of arenes48\u201355. While chiral bisoxazolines (BOXs) are common ligands in copper-catalyzed transformations56\u201358, we questioned whether asymmetric Cu-catalyzed C\u2013H bond arylation could be achieved by the combination of chiral bisoxazolines and diaryliodonium salts.\nIn this work, we develop a Cu/bisoxazoline-catalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)\u2013H arylation with diaryliodonium salts, and high stereoselectivities were obtained for P-chiral phosphonic diamides and axially chiral phosphorus-containing indoles (Fig. 1d)."

Initially, various bisoxazoline ligandswere screened, and commercially available chiral BOX L1 generated desired ortho-arylated product b1 in 50% yield with weak enantiocontrol (10% ee, Entry 1). Next, phenyl-substituted spiroBOXs L2\u2013L5 were examined (Entries 2\u20135). Cyclopropane- and cyclobutane-backboned ligands L2 and L3 yielded similar results,\nwith moderate ee values, while cyclopentane-backboned spiro-BOX L4 showed low reactivity. The enantioselectivity increased to 75% when the ring size was increased to a cyclohexane structure (Entry 5). A dramatic increase in enantioselectivity from75 to90%was observed when 2,3-dihydro-1H-phenalene-backboned BOX L6 was used, which may be attributed to the additional rigidity of the backbone compared to that of L5 (Entry 6). Unfortunately, modifications of the phenyl substituent of L6 did not result in positive effects on selectivity (Entries 7\u20139). In addition, ligand L10 with a seven-membered ring backbone was also tested and exhibited inferior enantioselectivity (69% ee, Entry 10). Under the same conditions, CuCl resulted in slightly better enantioselectivity than CuI (91%, Entry 11). 2,6-Di-tertbutylpyridine (DTBP) is a general acid side-product scavenger in Gaunt\u2019s works with diaryliodonium salts;47,51 hence, it was also applied in this reaction to improve the yield, but to our surprise, the reaction was severely suppressed (Entry 12).Wehypothesized thatDTBPmight abstract an anion, which facilitates H atom dissociation during C\u2013H bond activation, from the system, so NaOTf as an external anion source was added (Entries 13\u201315). After investigating the molar ratio ofNaOTf, 0.5mol%was determined to be the best value, affording the product in 97% yield and 91% ee (Entry 14). Thus, we established an optimal catalyst system: CuCl (10mol%)/L6 (15mol%) with 1.5 equiv. of DTBP and 0.5mol% NaOTf in dichloromethane."

These findings suggest that the reaction might be controlled by electronics, necessitating electron-donating groups (EDGs) on the substrate. Several phosphonic diamides with different EDGs were tested. Tert-butyl and dimethyl groups exhibited similar inferior enantioselectivities (85%, b2 and b3). A methoxy group at the meta-position reduced the ee value to 86% because of electronic effects (b4), while halogenation could alleviate the impact and lead to improved results (b5, b6). Substrate a7, with a strong electrondonating 3,4-methylenedioxy group, yielded much poorer results, which might be attributed to a faster background reaction. Replacing the butyl moiety on the P atom with a phenyl moiety resulted in only moderate enantioselectivity, which could be explained by the similar steric hindrance between phenyl and arylamine.\nNext, a series of diaryliodonium salts were synthesized and tested in this reaction (Fig. 3). Halogenation at the para andmeta positions of diaryliodonium salts has a negligible influence on the results, except para-fluorination resulted in slightly lower enantioselectivity due to the electron-withdrawing effect (b9-b14).Ortho-fluorodiaryliodonium\nsalt produced the corresponding ortho-arylated product in moderate yield because of steric repulsion but did not affect the selectivity (b15). Other functional groups, such as methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethoxycarbonyl, methoxy, trifluoromethoxy, and tert-butyl groups, exert notable electronic effects on enantioselectivity. Strong electrondonating and electron-withdrawing abilities were both detrimental to stereo-induction, but substituents in the para-position had a more remarkable negative impact than those in themeta-position (b16-b26). The absolute configuration of product b was assigned to be R according to the X-ray crystal diffraction analysis (XRD) of product b1859. Finally, heterocyclic diaryliodonium salts were also used in this reaction, and thiophenyl groups were successfully introduced at the ortho-position of a1 with moderate yields and enantioselectivities (b27-b28).\nAxially chiral biaryl monophosphines are an important class of ligands in asymmetric catalysis, and the development of the new synthetic protocol for these compounds has attracted much attention60. As phosphine oxides are common precursors of trivalent phosphines, we envisioned the developed phosphine oxide-directed\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2264 4\nC\u2013Harylation reaction couldbe extended to the construction of axially chiral biaryl monophosphine oxides61. We chose diphenylphosphine oxide indole c1 as the standard substrate under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 4, see SuppIementary Information for detailed condition optimization), and the C-3 phenylated product was obtained in 64% yield with 87% ee. XRD results of d1 indicate the configuration to be R around the axis62.\nThe scope of diphenylphosphine oxide indoles was also investigated, and the isopropyl on the N atom of the indole ring gave similar results to methyl (d2), while results varied with sites of methyl on the indole ring. 5- and 7-methylated substrates produced approximate results (d3 and d5), but methyl on the 6-position generates much poorer stereoselectivity (69% ee, d4). Such results could be explained as follows: EDGs para to C-3 increased the electron clouddensity at the reaction site and accelerated the background reaction. Substrate c8 with stronger EDG methoxy on the 5-position also validated this deduction (d9). Conversely, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like chloro and fluoro on the indole ring severely hampered the reaction rate with slight erosion on ee values of products (d6-d8). Next, different functional groups on diphenylphosphine oxide were also screened. Generally, EDGs on phenyl rings benefit the stereocontrol, giving product in 83\u201390% ee with moderate yields (d11-d16). Unexpectedly, chloro on para-position of phenyl rings has distinct corruption on the stereoselectivity, generating the product in 66% ee (d10).We think this could be ascribed to theweaker directing ability of the electron-deficient diphenylphosphine oxide group.\nFurthermore, the scope of diaryliodonium salts for asymmetric C-3 arylation of diphenylphosphine oxide indole c1 was examined under the same conditions (Fig. 5). Groups with different electronic\neffects, like bromo, chloro, fluoro, methyl, ethoxycarbonyl, methoxy, and tert-butyl, were well tolerated and gave corresponding arylated products in 70\u201387% eewithmoderate to good yields. As awhole,metaposition of substitutes on the phenyl ring of diaryliodonium salts renders low enantioselectivity than para-position, which is contrary to the tendency observed with phosphonic diamide a1 in Fig. 3. We speculated that the steric effect plays a more important role than the electronic effect during the construction of axial chirality, opposite to P-central chirality."

This\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2264 5\ndifferentiatingbehavior of the reaction system implies that the catalyst selectively interacts with the phenyl ring in an electrophilic activated manner. Additionally, this reaction represents a successful example of distinguishing between two similar phenyl rings with subtle differences in the electronic density, which is hard to achieve by other asymmetric catalytic systems.\nThe kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was evaluated under standard conditions, and a value of 1.0 indicated thatC\u2013Hbond abscission is not the rate-determining step in this reaction (Fig. 7b)63. Based on the observed results and literature reports47,48, we assumed that aryl\u2013Cu(III) intermediate II was involved in the transformation, and\nthis highly electrophilic complex, in a stereoselective and rate-limiting manner, activates an electron-rich phenyl ring with the aid of NaOTf to abstract H atoms and generate ortho-metalized intermediate IV, as depicted in Fig. 8. The whole C\u2013H bond activation event determined the configuration of the product; however, more meticulous investigations are needed to elucidate the exact process of C\u2013H bond activation and the origin of stereocontrol.\nIn summary, we have disclosed the Cu-catalyzed asymmetric arylation for the construction of P-chiral phosphonic diamines and axially chiral diarylphosphine oxide indoles with excellent enantioselectivities.

Electronic effects are fairly obvious in this reaction, and an electrophilic aryl\u2013Cu(III) intermediate was thereby assumed. The KIE experiment shows that C\u2013H bond abscission is not the rate-determining step in this Cu-catalyzed arylation process. The gram-scale reaction proceeded smoothly when the catalyst loading was reduced to 1mol%, implying potential industrial applications. Further investigations to fully understand the reaction and extension of this methodology to construct other optically active structures are underway in our lab."
