 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Synthesize and test additional metallodendrimer compounds with different metal cores (e.g. ruthenium, osmium) and ligand systems to optimize cytotoxicity.

2. Investigate the mechanism of action of the most potent dirhodium complexes (e.g. compound 5) through cell-based studies and binding assays with DNA and proteins. 

3. Modify the dendrimer scaffold to improve solubility, such as changing the core structure or adding solubilizing groups on the periphery. Test cytotoxicity of optimized dendrimers.

4. Evaluate the selectivity of the best performing complexes between cancerous and healthy cell lines. Also assess toxicity in animal models.

5. Formulate the most promising complexes into drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles or liposomes to potentially enhance efficacy through passive tumor targeting. Evaluate anticancer effects in vivo.
