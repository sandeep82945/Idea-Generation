    "abstractText": "A facile oxygen (O2) atmospheric plasma treatment is applied to a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to enhance its wettability and hydrophilicity. The optimal plasma treatment conditions are determined by varying the applied plasma power and plasma treatment time. A PVA matrix treated with a plasma power of 120 W for 5 s shows the most hydrophilicity owing to successful formation of carbonyl (\u2013CO, >C=O) functional groups without any structural degradation. The plasma-treated PVA matrix is used as the gel-polymer electrolyte of a solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) by immersing solid matrix into various liquid electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and potassium hydroxide (KOH). Compared with the pristine PVA-based device, PVA-120W5/Na2SO4-, PVA-120W5/H2SO4-, and PVA-120W5/KOH-based SSCs show 2.03, 2.05, and 2.14 times higher specific capacitances, respectively. The plasma-treated PVA matrix shows increased specific capacitance owing to the increased wettability, which in turn increases the ion transportation and reduces the electrical resistance. This study successfully demonstrates that the electrochemical performance of a SSC can be readily enhanced through plasma treatment for a short time (\u22645 s).",

            "text": "Energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries, are widely used in hybrid and electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and various electronic devices [1,2]. SCs provide several benefits over batteries, such as rapid charge/discharge rates, long-term cyclability, and high power density [3]. In particular, solid-state supercapacitors (SSCs) are expected to be used in future energy storage devices that are increasingly demanded for flexible, wearable, and portable devices [4]. An SC typically consists of two electrodes (one positive and one negative), a separator, and an electrolyte [5]. Various materials including carbon, transition metal oxides, and conductive polymers can be used as active materials for electrodes [6]. The electrolyte determines the interfacial resistance at the electrode interface, as well as the ionic conductivity, and thus, it is a key factor affecting the SC performance [7,8]. SSCs employ gel or solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones because\nGels 2023, 9, 351. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9040351 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 351 2 of 15\nthey offer superior mechanical durability, thermal stability, outstanding electrochemical performance, and a flexible form factor [9,10]. In SSCs, various materials such as polymers, ceramics, and composite materials have been used as gel electrolytes [11,12]. Among them, gel-polymer electrolytes, with their advantages over liquid electrolytes, such as mechanical stability, high ion conductivity, and safety, have received widespread attention as a key component in electrochemical energy storage devices, including SCs and batteries [13\u201315]. Polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyolefin, and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), are used most commonly, because of their chemical stability, ease of production, and low cost [16\u201319]. When dissolved in a water-soluble solvent, polymers can be gelated to form a gel-polymer electrolyte [20,21]. In particular, PVA is widely used for synthesizing gelpolymer electrolytes owing to its high ionic conductivity, flexibility, mechanical/thermal stability, and nontoxicity [22\u201324]. Moreover, PVA can be simply modified by introducing other functional groups, making it a versatile material for gel-polymer electrolyte applications [25]. The functional groups of PVA-based electrolytes can be conveniently adjusted using various physical and chemical techniques, including plasma treatment [26,27]. Plasma treatment is a simple process in which the surface properties of a material are modified using ionized gas without impacting the bulk properties [28,29]. By selecting appropriate gases, desired characteristics including wettability, adhesion, and biocompatibility can be conferred on the material surface [30,31]. Plasma treatment can be performed in a vacuum or using atmospheric plasma [32]. In a vacuum, the low pressure allows the plasma to be modified and functionalized more precisely by using various gases, such as oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F) [33\u201335]. Compared with vacuum plasma, atmospheric plasma affords advantages, such as ease of operation, quickness, safety, and mass production [36,37]. Furthermore, atmospheric plasma activates near atmospheric pressure, making the process more convenient and less expensive to operate [38]. In particular, O2 atmospheric plasma treatment has attracted much attention because it can effectively enhance the wettability and adhesion of a target material [39,40]. Inherently hydrophobic materials, such as polymers, can be made hydrophilic by introducing hydroxyl (\u2013OH) and carbonyl (\u2013CO and >C=O) functional groups generated by O2 atmospheric plasma treatment [41,42]. In electrochemistry, surface modification is considered highly important because low wettability or adhesion of the active material, electrode, electrolyte, and separator can cause a high electrical resistance that degrades the electrochemical performance [43]. Some studies have investigated the enhancement of separator adhesion to electrodes in secondary batteries via O2 plasma treatment. For instance, Li et al. successfully generated various electronegative oxygenic functional groups such as carbonyl and hydroxyl on the separator surface via O2 plasma treatment and thereby enhanced the electrochemical performance of a Li-S battery [44]. Jin et al. improved the adhesion between a polyethylene separator and an electrode via the surface modification of the separator by O2 plasma treatment and thereby enhanced the electrochemical performance of a Li battery [45]. Such treatment promotes the movement of ions and ensures stable adhesion with the electrode to lower the electrical resistance, thereby improving the overall battery performance [46,47]. However, most of plasma treatment employed electrochemical studies were focusing on the fields of secondary batteries. There were some studies regarding the enhancement of electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, but previous studies were concentrated in the treatment on active material and electrode [48\u201350]. In this regard, there is necessity for a better understanding of plasma effects and related electrochemical performance on gel or solid electrolytes. In this study, a PVA-based gel-polymer electrolyte (pristine PVA) was synthesized by the simple gelation of a PVA solution. To improve the electrochemical performance, the surface of the gel-polymer electrolyte was then functionalized through fast and effective O2 atmospheric plasma treatment (plasma-treated PVA). By controlling the intensity of the applied plasma power from 80 to 160 W (referred to as PVA-80W5, PVA-100W5, PVA-120W5, PVA-140W5, and PVA-160W5) and the treatment time from 5 to 25 s (referred to as PVA-120W5, PVA-120W10,\nGels 2023, 9, 351 3 of 15\nPVA-120W15, PVA-120W20, and PVA-120W25), an applied power of 120 W and treatment time of 5 s (PVA-120W5) were identified to be the most effective conditions for introducing oxygen functional groups without causing polymer decomposition. The SSCs were then assembled using C/MnO2 and C/Fe2O3 as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Next, 1.0 M Na2SO4 was applied to the plasma-treated PVA (PVA-120W5/Na2SO4). The PVA120W5/Na2SO4-based SSC showed a specific capacitance of ca. 7.89 mF cm\u22122 at 100 mV s\u22121; this was 2.03 times higher than that of a pristine PVA/Na2SO4-based device (i.e., 3.89 mF cm\u22122). The plasma-treated PVA matrix was further immersed into liquid electrolytes of 1.0 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH. The PVA-120W5/H2SO4- and PVA-120W5/KOH-based SSCs exhibited 2.05 and 2.14 times higher capacitances, respectively, than that of their corresponding pristine PVAbased devices. In this manner, hydrophilic functional groups were successfully introduced to the PVA-based gel-polymer electrolyte using facile O2 atmospheric plasma treatment within a short time (\u22645 s), and consequently, the electrochemical performance for SC applications was enhanced."

First, pristine and plasma-treated PVA with applied plasma powers of 80\u2013160 W for 5 s were examined, as shown in Figure 3a. In all cases, characteristic peaks corresponding to the O\u2013H, C=O, and C\u2013O stretching vibrations and C\u2013C stretching vibration were observed at 3290, 1730, 1086, and 842 cm\u22121, respectively [53\u2013 56]. Additionally, minor peaks with low intensities were detected for C\u2013H stretching, C\u2013 H bending, and O\u2013H bending at 2932, 1424, and 1325 cm\u22121, respectively [56\u201358]. As the applied plasma power was increased up to 120 W, the absorbance of hydrophilic groups such as O\u2013H, C=O, and C\u2013O increased whereas that of the C\u2013C group decreased [59,60]. As the applied plasma power was increased beyond 120 W, the absorbance of hydrophilic groups decreased, suggesting the structural deformation of the PVA matrix. Based on the FT-IR analysis, the optimal power for the surface modification of PVA through plasma treatment were determined to be 120 W. To further optimize the condition of most hydrophilic functional groups, the plasma treatment time was varied as 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 s (listed as PVA-120W#seconds), while maintaining the applied plasma power of 120 W (Figure 3b). The absorbance of O\u2013H, C=O, and C\u2013O groups was the highest when the plasma treatment time was 5 s. As the plasma treatment time was increased beyond 5 s, the absorbance of hydrophilic groups decreased, causing the structural deformation of PVA. Therefore, the optimal conditions to prepare the most hydrophilic plasma-treated PVA matrix were determined to be an applied plasma power of 120 W and treatment time of 5 s.\nFigure 2.

The measured CA for pristine PVA, PVA-120W5, PVA-120W10, PVA-120W15, PVA-120W20, and PVA-120W25 was approximately 61.4, 38.2, 39.8, 41.9, 45.7, and 48.9\u25e6, respectively. Relative to the pristine PVA, all plasma-treated PVAs showed a lower CA owing to the formation of hydrophilic functional groups. However, the CA values increased with an increase in the plasma treatment time. This increase in CA is caused by the thermal degradation of functional groups by plasma treatment [63]. Specifically, the plasma treatment functionalized the PVA surface; however, continuous plasma treatment can cause the degradation and dissociation of the carbonyl functional groups. Therefore, an applied plasma power of 120 W and treatment time of 5 s (PVA-120W5) were determined as the optimal conditions to prepare the most hydrophilic PVA matrix. In addition, swelling ratios of various plasma-treated PVAs were determined to further investigate the plasma effect on the wettability. Swelling ratios of pristine and plasma-treated PVAs were determined by immersing the sample into the solution for 10 s and determining the mass ratio between initial dry state and wetted state. Determined swelling ratio of Pristine PVA, PVA-120W5, PVA-120W10, PVA-120W15, PVA-120W20, and PVA-120W25 in aqueous solution were 2.3, 3.6, 3.3, 3.3, 3.2, and 2.7, respectively. It was confirmed that the swelling ratio of various plasma-treated PVAs were in accordance with the contact angle measurements. Additionally, the swelling ratios were measured for two organic solvents\nGels 2023, 9, 351 6 of 15\nEtOH and commercial EC/EMC 3:7 (1.0M LiPF6) electrolyte. In case of EtOH, the evaluated swelling ratios were determined as 1.7, 2.6, 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, and 1.9, showing similar trends to aqueous solution. For the commercial EC/EMC 3:7 electrolyte (1.0M LiPF6), determined swelling ratios were 1.6, 1.8, 1.6, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.1. Notably, swelling trends of various plasmatreated PVAs were similar in two organic solvents; this led to a maximized swelling ratio in PVA-120W5 condition, decreasing after the plasma treatment times of 5 s. Polarities of organic solvents were lower compared to water or aqueous solution, but the presence of functional groups of EtOH and EC/EMC provided a binding effect with the functional groups of pristine and plasma-treated PVA matrices [64,65]. In this regard, swelling ratios were different for each solvent, but overall trends were similar due to the functional groups. After the 5 s of plasma treatment decrement in swelling ratio was observed due to the degradation of carbonyl functional groups. Accordingly, organic solvent with polar atom or functional groups manifested a similar uptake trend to aqueous solution.

The SSC was assembled using C/MnO2 as the positive lectrode, C/Fe2O3 as the negative electrode, and plasma-treated P A matrix with added Na2SO4 as the gel-polymer electrolyte. MnO2 and Fe2O3 were mixed with the activat d carbon material, owing to their large work function difference, high lectrochemical perf mance, and\nydrophilicity [66,67]. Furthermore, the pristine and plasma- reated PVA were immersed in 1.0 M Na2SO4 and employed as gel-polymer electrolytes to verify the difference in their electrochemical performa ce without destroying the electrode during the charging and discharging process [68]. First, pristine and plasm -treated PVA with different plasma treatment powers were analyzed according to the CV curves at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121 i the potential window of 0\u20131.5 V, as shown in Figure 6a.

Notably, PVA-120W5 exhibited the highest areal specific capacitance, in keeping with the hydrophilicity results obtained through FT-IR analysis. When the applied power was increased beyond 140 W, the areal capacitance decreased, suggesting the structural decomposition of PVA. The introduction of hydrophilic groups using facile plasma treatment increased the wettability\nGels 2023, 9, 351 7 of 15\nof the gel-polymer electrolyte, which was capable of retaining its wettability and a large number of ions, resulting in the enhancement in electrochemical performance [69,70].\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 16 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to investigate the improvement in the electrochemical performance of plasma-treated PVA.

The introduction of hydrophilic groups using facile plasma treatment increased the wettability of the gel-polymer electrolyte, which was capable of retaining its wettability and a large number of ions, resulting in the enhancement in electrochemical performance [69,70].\nEIS analysis of the pristine and plasma-treated PVA matrices was used to compare the ion-transport capabilities of the as-assembled SSCs, as shown in Figure 6c. The corresponding equivalent circuit of the SSC is shown in Figure S2; the circuit consists of an equivalent circuit resistance (RESR), charge transfer resistance (RCT), Warburg impedance (ZW), and double-layer capacitance (CDL) [71]. Each EIS data was investigated by fitting the data into an equivalent circuit model and adding the fitted curve as an inset, as shown in Figure S5. RESR is the ionic resistance of the electrolyte and the interface resistance of the active material [72,73]. RCT is the resistance of the faradaic reaction at the electrolyte\u2013electrode interface [74]. For pristine PVA, PVA-80W5, PVA-100W5, PVA-120W5, PVA-140W5, and PVA-160W5, RESR values were measured to be 4.91, 4.59, 3.45, 2.12, 4.30, and 4.90 \u2126, respectively, and the corresponding RCT values were measured to be 1.46, 1.20, 0.84, 0.80, 1.06, and 1.32 \u2126, respectively. PVA-120W5 showed the lowest RCT and RESR values of 0.80 and 2.12 \u2126, respectively. MnO2 and Fe2O3 from each electrode are hydrophilic and therefore effectively activate ion transportation at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface more dynamically to reduce RCT [75,76]. Therefore, SSCs employing PVA-120W5 exhibited the highest capacitive behavior.\nFigure 6.

The RESR and RCT values increased with the plasma treatment time, confirming the increase in interface resistance between the electrode and electrolyte and decrease in ionic conductivity. Such phenomena occurred because the carbonyl group formed in PVA disintegrated as the plasma treatment time was increased beyond 5 s [77]. Therefore, PVA-120W5 showed improved hydrophilicity that effectively controlled the interface resistance and ionic conductivity, thus confirming its suitability as a gel-polymer electrolyte for the SSC device.\nFigure 7.

Compared with pristine PVA, plasma-treated PVA has more hydrophilic functional groups that can transport ions more conveniently. Figure 8b shows CV curves of the SSC using PVA-120W5/Na2SO4 at different scan rates of 10\u2013200 mV s\u22121. The CV curves of the SSC maintained a rectangular shape even at high scan rates, suggesting the excellent ion transportation and capacitive properties [78,79]. In addition, the areal specific capacitances of the SSC measured from the CV curves were 10.77, 9.68, 8.41, 7.89, and 7.27 mF cm\u22122 at 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV s\u22121, respectively (Figure 8c). Specifically, the capacitance retention was 67% as the scan rate was increased from 10 to 200 mV s\u22121, verifying the outstanding capacitive performance at even high scan rates [80,81]. Therefore, PVA-120W5 demonstrated improved performance as an SSC with ions and water being retained effectively by introducing hydrophilic groups using atmospheric plasma treatment. In addition, a cyclability test was conducted on the SSCs to compare the difference in retention rates between pristine PVA and PVA-120W5 at a current density of 5 mA cm\u22122 for 1000 cycles (Figure S7).

Figure 8a shows a plausible mechanism by which the ionic conductivity of SSCs using a plasma-treated PVA matrix increases, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. Compared with pristine PVA, plasma-treated PVA has more hydrophilic functional groups that can transport ions more conveniently. Figure 8b shows CV curves of the SSC using PVA-120W5/Na2SO4 at different scan rates of 10\u2013200 mV s\u22121. The CV curves of the SSC maintained a rectangular shape even at high scan rates, suggesting the excellent ion transportation and capacitive properties [78,79]. In addition, the areal specific capacitances of the SSC measured from the CV curves were 10.77, 9.68, 8.41, 7.89, and 7.27 mF cm\u22122 at 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV s\u22121, respectively (Figure 8c). Specifically, the capacitance retention was 67% as the scan rate was increased from 10 to 200 mV s\u22121, verifying the outstanding capacitive performance at even high scan rates [80,81]. Therefore, PVA-120W5 demonstrated improved performance as an SSC with ions and water being retained effectively by introducing hydrophilic groups using atmospheric plasma treatment. In addition, a cyclability test was conducted on the SSCs to compare the difference in retention rates between pristine PVA and PVA-120W5 at a current density of 5 mA cm\u22122 for 1000 cycles (Figure S7). The specific capacitances of the SSC devices employing pristine PVA and PVA-120W5 were evaluated as ca. 71.4 and 83.0% of their initial values, which verified the long-term stability of the SSC device. Furthermore, the CV curves of an SSC using PVA-120W5 with 1.0 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH were examined at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121 to investigate the performance improvement with other electrolytes; CV curves obtained with the application of pristine PVA are shown for comparison (Figure 8d,e). The SSCs using PVA-120W5/H2SO4 and PVA-120W5/KOH exhibited 2.05 and 2.14 times higher electrochemical performance, respectively, compared with that of the SSC using pristine PVA. These results confirmed that introducing plasma-treated PVA increased the ionic conductivity and thereby enhanced the performance of SSCs. The newly prepared PVA120W5/Na2SO4 was compared with other plasma-treated materials in SCs and summarized in Table 1 [48,82,83]. All other studies have reported on the enhancement of electrochemical performance by plasma treatment on active material and electrode. Accordingly, it was verified that the plasma treatment on various target or component including gel electrolyte can effectively enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.\nGels 2023, 9, 351 9 of 15\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16\nthe long-term stability of the SSC device.

Conclusions Pristine PVA was subjected to O2 atmospheric plasma treatment. SSCs using the plasma-treated PVA exhibited improved electrochemical performance. PVA offers high ionic conductivity, and, therefore, it was used as a gel-polymer electrolyte via a simple gelation method. O2 plasma treatment was performed to introduce hydrophilic groups like \u2013CO and >C=O (carbonyl) that enhanced the wettability of the pristine PVA. With an applied plasma power of 120 W, the most hydrophilic functional groups were detected.\nFigure 8.

To verify the capacitive improvement of plasma-treated PVA, an SSC was assembled using C/MnO2 as the positive electrode, C/Fe2O3 as the negative electrode, and PVA-120W5/Na2SO4 as the gel-polymer electrolyte. The areal specific capacitance of this SSC was 7.89 mF cm\u22122 at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121; this was 2.03 times higher than that of the SSC using pristine PVA/Na2SO4.

As a result, facile O2 plasma treatment functionalized the surface of pristine PVA to improve its wettability and thereby effectively enhanced the specific capacitance of the as-assembled SSC.\nGels 2023, 9, 351 10 of 15"
