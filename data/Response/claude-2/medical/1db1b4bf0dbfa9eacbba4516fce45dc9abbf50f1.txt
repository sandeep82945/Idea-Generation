 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of fiber orientation within the pellets on dispersion rate. The current study looked at perimeter and area but did not account for anisotropy of the fiber bundles. Bundles aligned perpendicular to flow may disperse faster than those aligned parallel.

2. Study the relationship between dispersion rate and final average fiber length. Higher dispersion rates may lead to more fiber breakage and shorter fibers. Identifying the optimal dispersion rate to balance dispersion and fiber length retention would be useful. 

3. Expand the dispersion model to account for interactions between pellets in a multi-pellet system. The current model focuses on single pellet behavior but pellet-pellet interactions likely influence dispersion. 

4. Examine the effect of different polymers, fiber types, and sizings/coatings on dispersion behavior. This study looked at polypropylene and E-glass fibers but other materials may have different dynamics.

5. Correlate dispersion measurements to mechanical properties of final parts. Better dispersed systems should improve mechanical performance but quantifying this relationship would be valuable for optimization.
