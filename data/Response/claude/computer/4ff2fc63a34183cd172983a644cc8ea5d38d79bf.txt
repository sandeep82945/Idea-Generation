 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Conduct empirical studies to evaluate the proposed framework in real-world distributed Scrum projects. This could involve case studies, surveys, or experiments to assess the effectiveness of the framework in practice.

2. Investigate how artificial intelligence and machine learning could help automate parts of the framework, such as automatically detecting challenges and recommending mitigation strategies. This could make the framework more adaptive and personalized.

3. Explore how the framework could be extended to support other agile methodologies besides Scrum that are used in distributed settings, such as Kanban or XP. 

4. Develop tools and plugins to integrate the framework into existing ALM/SDLC software and infrastructure used by distributed teams. This would make adoption and use of the framework more seamless.

5. Identify moderating factors not addressed in the framework that could impact its effectiveness, such as team size, system criticality, organizational culture etc. Then refine the framework to account for those contextual factors.
