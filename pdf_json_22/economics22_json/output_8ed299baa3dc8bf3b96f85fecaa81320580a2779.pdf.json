    "abstractText": "The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is a highly influential economic belt and an innovative 8 demonstration belt for the protection and restoration of ecological and environmental systems. The dynamic 9 coordination between economic development system (EDs) and water pollution control capability system (WPCCs) is a 10 critical issue to be solved for regional sustainable development. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed 11 in previous studies. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzed the spatiotemporal differentiation and obstacle factors 12 influencing the coupling coordination between EDs and WPCCs in the Chinese Five-Year Plan based on coupling 13 coordination degree model and obstacle degree model. The main results suggest that: (1) the comprehensive level of 14 the comprehensive level of water pollution control capability presents an upward trend with the increase of 15 economic development. A J-shaped relationship existed between the EDs and WPCCs. (2) the regions with rapid 16 economic growth are mainly distributed in the Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Chongqing, and Sichuan. Moreover, water 17 pollution control capability system shows this pattern, eastern regions > western regions> central regions. (3) the 18 coupling coordination level of each region in the YREB has improved from a moderately unbalanced development 19 level to a superiorly balanced development level from 2006 to 2019. (4) per capita gross domestic product, gross 20 product of tertiary industry, total volume of waste water treated, and per daily volume treated of sewage treatment 21 facilities are the major indexes influencing the coordinated development of the EDs and WPCCs. These finding are 22 conductive to formulating reasonable strategies for water environment protection and sustainable development and 23 providing a direction for urban planning. 24",

The dynamic 9 coordination between economic development system (EDs) and water pollution control capability system (WPCCs) is a 10 critical issue to be solved for regional sustainable development. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed 11 in previous studies. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzed the spatiotemporal differentiation and obstacle factors 12 influencing the coupling coordination between EDs and WPCCs in the Chinese Five-Year Plan based on coupling 13 coordination degree model and obstacle degree model. The main results suggest that: (1) the comprehensive level of 14 the comprehensive level of water pollution control capability presents an upward trend with the increase of 15 economic development. A J-shaped relationship existed between the EDs and WPCCs. (2) the regions with rapid 16 economic growth are mainly distributed in the Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Chongqing, and Sichuan. Moreover, water 17\npollution control capability system shows this pattern, eastern regions \uff1e western regions\uff1e central regions. (3) the 18\ncoupling coordination level of each region in the YREB has improved from a moderately unbalanced development 19 level to a superiorly balanced development level from 2006 to 2019. (4) per capita gross domestic product, gross 20 product of tertiary industry, total volume of waste water treated, and per daily volume treated of sewage treatment 21 facilities are the major indexes influencing the coordinated development of the EDs and WPCCs.

            "text": "A nice water environment is a crucial foundation for the sustainable development of cities (Li et al. 2019; Li et al. 28 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), as a watershed economy, involves water, 29 ports, biological, and environment aspects, which must be comprehensively controlled and planned (Cui et al. 30\n2021; Deng et al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2013). However, the rapid development of the YREB has brought great pressure 31 on the water shortage, water pollution and water ecosystem destruction (Jin et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018; Xu et al. 32 2020). These problems hinder the coordinated and sustainable development of economic development and water 33 ecology in the YREB. Therefore, the future of the YREB development lies in changing the predatory economic 34 development mode to the sustainable economic development mode. 35 Economic development of YREB is highly dependent on the water ecological environment (Shi et al. 2020; Zhang 36 and Jiao 2015). The water ecological environment is the material condition for economic development and the basis for 37 human survival, and it can either promote economic development or hinder it (Yang et al. 2020). To maintain the 38 coordinated development of the YREB, Chinese government has issued many policy documents to improve the water 39 pollution control capability of cities, such as, in 2016, the Outline of the Development plan for the Yangtze River 40 Economic Belt was released, emphasizing the establishment of the strictest ecological environment protection and water 41 resources management systems. In 2017, the Plan for ecological and environmental protection along the Yangtze 42 Economic Belt was issued, calling for prioritizing ecological and environmental protection. Overall, in long-term 43 practice and research, people realize the importance of the relationship economic development system (EDs) and water 44 pollution control capability system (WPCCs) in the YREB, and gradually form the coordinated development theory that 45 the two are opposites and unity. 46 Coupling theory can be used to express the influence degree of interactions between multiple systems (Han et al. 47 2019; Ai et al. 2016; Li et al. 2012). The coupling coordination degree obtained by calculation can not only clearly 48 reflect the coordination degree, but also judge whether the systems develop harmoniously between the EDs and 49 WPCCs (Yang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). In the economic development system and water pollution control 50 capability system, the rapid development of economy brings adverse impact on water resources environment. However, 51 the sustainable economic development also provides financial support and technical guarantee for the prevention and 52 management of water pollution (Liu et al. 2019). Conversely, the level of water pollution control capability will also 53 influence the effect of economic development (Zhang and Jiao 2015). Sufficient water resources and quality water 54 quality can ensure high-quality economic development. More importantly, with the deepening of the implementation of 55 the YREB strategy, the interconnectivity between regions is increasing. It has become the key of the sustainable 56 development of the YREB to realize the coordinated development of the EDs and WPCCs in the trans-regional process 57 while maintaining the improvement of water ecological environment. Therefore, exploring the coupling relationship 58 between the EDs and WPCCs has become a significance topic to implement the high-quality development of the 59 YREB. 60\nThe degree of coupling and coordination between the EDs and WPCCs is strongly linked the level of social and 61 economic sustainable development of a country or region. Therefore, in recent years, the focus of scholars has become 62 to improve the coupled and coordinated development, especially economic development system and ecological 63 environment system of the YREB. Peng et al. (2021) constructed the dynamic model of the economy-resource-64 environment of the YREB, and measured and compared the coordinated development levels of the YREB under 65 different resources and environment management and control intensities based on the coupling coordination degree 66 model. Zhang and Liu (2017) analyzed the coupling coordination degree of urbanization system and ecological 67 environment system in the YREB from two dimensions of time and space by using variation coefficient method and 68 coupling measure model. To correctly grasp the relationship between eco-environmental protection and economic 69 development, Long and Yang (2020) constructed an economic development index and carbon emission accounting 70 system to evaluate the economy-ecosystem system of the YREB, and analyzed the spatial differentiation of carbon 71 emissions through spatial autocorrelation. To sum up, only sustainable development of ecological environment 72 protection can continuously optimize the long-term development of YREB. Therefore, to explore the relation between 73 the EDs and WPCCs of the YREB, it is necessary to measure the coupling coordination level of the systems on the 74 spatiotemporal. 75 Despite these advances in the study of the interaction between economic development and ecological 76 environment, few studies have been conducted from the perspective of water pollution control capability and economic 77 development. Even if there is, it only explored the changes of a single system. In addition, in the previous model of 78 coupling coordination degree (CCD), the contribution coefficient is determined by subjective method (Cai et al. 2021; 79 Deng et al. 2021). Most importantly, previous studies did not explore the obstacles affecting the coordinated 80 development between economic development system and water pollution control capacity system. To fill these gaps, 81 this paper introduces an improved CCD model and obstacle degree model to analyze the spatiotemporal differentiation 82 and obstacle indicators influencing the coupling coordination between the EDs and WPCCs in the YREB. 83 This study has three main objectives: (1) develop indicator systems for coupling coordination analysis, including 84 economic development system and water pollution control capability system, (2) analyze the coupling coordination 85 level and spatiotemporal differentiation based on the coupling coordination model of the economic development and 86 water pollution control capability systems, and (3) diagnose the main obstacle factors in subsystem and indicator level 87 affecting the coordinated development of systems based on the obstacle degree model. 88"

The YREB is 92 an economic belt with the highest economic density in China, which has unique advantages and huge potential for 93 development. The rapid development of the YREB cannot be promoted without water resources in the region, and 94 water resources are essential elements for the construction of the green ecological of the YREB. However, the 95 development of the YREB is faced with many problems, mainly including the severe water ecological 96 environment situation, unbalanced regional development, and the incomplete regional cooperation mechanism 97 (Qian 2021; Tang et al. 2019). With the continuous development of urbanization, the YREB regions are also 98 constantly improving its ability to maintain water ecological balance, and assuming the responsibility of leading 99 the demonstration belt of ecological civilization construction. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the coordinated 100 development of economic development and water pollution control capability systems in the YREB. 101\n102\nFig. 1.

Evaluation Index of the EDs and WPCCs 113\nEconomic development and environment protection are opposites, unity, and coordination (Qian 2021; Yang et al. 114 2020). There are complex interactions and contradictions between the EDs and WPCCs. Therefore, the EDs and 115 WPCCs can be considered as a coupled system, and the degree of mutual relationship between the two systems can be 116 measured by coupling coordination degree (Fang and Liu 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Zhang and Liu 2017). In light of this, 117 based on the previous studies and the China Environmental Statistical Yearbook, the index systems of economic 118 development and water pollution control capacity were established. Specifically, the economic development system 119 was established from the three dimensions of economic product, economic aggregate, and residents living (Table 1). 120 The water pollution control capability system was established from the three dimensions of economic product, 121 economic aggregate, and residents living (Table 2). 122\nAnnual per capita disposable income of urban\nhouseholds (E12) Yuan +\nLiao et al. 2019; Peng et al. 2020;\nSun et al. 2018) Annual per capita net income of rural\nhouseholds (E13) Yuan +\nEngle\u2019s coefficient of urban households (E14) % - Engle\u2019s coefficient of rural households (E15) % -\nNote: \"+\" and \"-\" represent positive and negative indicators respectively. 125 2.2.2.

The analysis indicators in the economic development and water pollution control 130 capability systems include positive and negative indicators. In order to delete the differences in the data of various 131 indicators, this paper first needs to normalize the original data [55]. If it is a positive indicator, Eq.

The maximum value multiplied by 1.05 and the 135\nminimum value divided by 1.05 are to reduce the heterogeneity caused by boundary effect to interfere with the 136 calculation results (Wen and Wen 2019), 1,2, ,i m L , 1,2, ,j n L .. 137\n2.2.3. Comprehensive Assessment Combining AHP-Entropy Methods 138 In this study, AHP and entropy methods are combined to determine the weight of each index, and finally 139 calculate comprehensive level of the EDs and WPCCs. The detail process is as follows: 140 Step 1: Determine the subjective weight using AHP method. In this study, yaahp software is used to calculate 141\nthe objective weight sww results quickly and conveniently. 142\nStep 2: Determine the objective weight using entropy weight method. The entropy weight oww of indicators 143 at each level of economic development and water pollution control capability systems, which can be calculated by 144 Eqs. (3) and (4): 145\n  1\n1 ln\nln\nm\nj ij ij\ni G F F m \n   (3)\n    1\n1 1 m\now j j\nj w G G \n   (4)\nWhere 1\nm\nij ij ij\nj F r r \n  is the proportion of the indicator j in year i .  0 1j jG G  is the information entropy 146\nof the j th evaluation indicator. oww is the weight of the indicator. m is the number of years. 147 Step 3: Determine the weight based on AHP-Entropy methods. This study used the linear combination 148 method (Jiang et al. 2011; Nabavi-Kerizi et al. 2010) to obtain the combined weight of economic development 149 and water pollution control capability systems indexes. In order to eliminate the interference of large fluctuation 150\ndata and make the difference between sww and oww consistent with the difference between  and  , the concept 151 of distance function is introduced (Zhang et al. 2011). The combined weight can be expressed as follows: 152\nAE sw ow w w w   (5)\nWhere  and  are the distribution coefficients of weights, 1   . 153\nThe distance function of subjective weight and objective weight can be expressed as: 154\n    1 22\n1\n1 ,\n2\nn\nsw ow sw ow\ni d w w w w         (6)\nThe difference between the partition coefficients of weights can be expressed as: 155\nD    (7)\nTherefore, according to the Eqs. (6) and (7), the simultaneous equations are constructed as follows: 156\n   2 2, 1 sw ow d w w           (8)\nThen, the partition coefficients  ,  of weights can be obtained, and substitute the distribution coefficients 157\ninto Eq. (5). Finally, the combined weight AEw of indicators at each level of water pollution control capability 158 system and economic development system can be obtained. 159 Step 4: Calculate comprehensive level of the EDs and WPCCs. According to the normalized value and 160 weight of each indicator, the comprehensive level of the EDs and WPCCs were calculated by weighted 161 summation. Therefore, comprehensive level of the EDs and WPCCs in i year can be expressed as follows: 162\n  e eij AE j ijf ED w r  (9)\n  w wij AE j ijf WPCC w r  (10)\nWhere  if ED and  if WPCC represent the comprehensive level of economic development and water 163\npollution control capability systems in i years, respectively. e\nAE j w  and\ne\nij r represent the weight and the 164\nnormalized value of the economic development system, respectively. w\nAE j w  and\nw\nij r represent the weight and the 165 normalized value of the water pollution control capability system, respectively. In addition, n is the number of 166 indicators. 167 2.2.4. Improved Coupling Coordination Degree Model 168 The contribution coefficient of CCD model is determined by subjective method in the previous studies (Ding et al. 169 2015; Liu et al. 2018). In order to calculate the coupling coordination degree more accurately and objectively, this 170 study proposes an improved CCD model based on the synergy theory (Brereton 1978). The calculation steps are shown 171 as follows: 172\n      f ED f WPCC f ED    (11)\n      f WPCC f WPCC f ED    (12)\nWhere  and  are the improved contribution coefficients of water pollution control capability system and 173\neconomic development system, respectively. 174\n         2 f WPCC f ED C f WPCC f ED    (1)\n   T f WPCC f ED   (2)\nD C T  (15)\nWhere C is the coupling degree between the EDs and WPCCs, which reflects the strength of the 175 connections between the EDs and WPCCs. T is the coupling coordination index between the EDs and WPCCs. 176 D is the coupling coordination degree the EDs and WPCCs. 177 To clearly describe the CCD level between water pollution control capability system and economic 178 development system, this study classified the coupling coordination degree grade. According to the results of 179  f WPCC and  f ED , the CCD values are divided into 3 categories and 6 levels in this paper with reference 180\n(Zhang and Li 2020). The coupling coordination states are shown in Table 3. 181\n2.2.5. Obstacle Degree Model 183 The obstacle degree model is introduced to analyze and diagnose the obstacle factors that influence the CCD 184 value between the water pollution control capability and economic development (Luo et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2015). 185 The analysis results of obstacle factors are helpful for the government to adjust the direction of water pollution 186 control and formulate new prevention measures and policies. The model includes three basic variables: factor 187 contribution degree, factor skewness, and factor obstacle degree. The obstacle degree model can be expressed as 188 follows: 189\n    1 1 1 ij AE j n ij AE j r w O r w    \n(16)\nIn this study, factor contribution degree is the index weight AEw . Factor skewness is replaced by the 190\ndifference between 1 and the normalized value ijr . Factor obstacle degree jO denotes the effect degree of 191\nsubsystems or indicators on CCD value between the economic development and water pollution control capability 192 systems. 193 3. Results 194 3.1. Comprehensive levels of economic development and water pollution control capability systems 195 The variation trend in the comprehensive levels of economic development system for YREB regions from 196 2006 to 2019 are shown in Fig. 3. The comprehensive levels of economic development system can be obtained 197 through Eq.(9) and the collected data of 11 YREB regions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the comprehensive levels of 198 economic development system were gradually increasing trend in the 11 YREB regions. Specifically, the 199 comprehensive economic development levels of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Chongqing were higher than that of 200 other regions. This is because the three provinces are coastal regions or municipality (Jiang et al. 2019). Fig. 3b 201 revealed the evolution path of economic development for entire YREB from 2006 to 2019 by the three subsystems 202 that constitute the system. Overall, the comprehensive levels of three subsystems have shown a significantly 203 upward trend, which indicated that economic development level of YREB has continued to increase. 204\n205 (a) trend in economic development system for each region (b) trend in three subsystems for entire YREB 206\nFig. 3. Comprehensive levels of economic development system for YREB regions from 2006 to 2019. 207 Fig. 4 illustrated the dynamic changes of water pollution control capability and the level of their subsystem 208 from 2006 to 2019. The comprehensive levels of water pollution control capability system can be obtained 209 through Eq.(10) and the collected data of 11 YREB regions. The comprehensive levels of water pollution control 210 capability system showed a trend of fluctuating growth in Fig. 4a. Obviously, Shanghai province has the fastest 211\ngrowth from 0.25 in 2006 to 0.76 in 2019, and Yunnan province has the smallest growth trend from 0.46 in 2006 212 to 0.68 in 2019. Moreover, except for the obvious fluctuation of Anhui, Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces, the 213 growth level of water pollution control capability in other regions is relatively consistent. Fig. 4b depicted the 214 changing trend of water pollution control capability for entire YREB from 2006 to 2019 by the three subsystems 215 that constitute the system. The three subsystems of water pollution control capability showed different trends. The 216 comprehensive level of waste water treatment capacity increased from 0.40 in 2006 to 5.11 in 2019. However, the 217 comprehensive level of non-point source pollution control capability and water conservation capacity subsystems 218 changed from downward trend to upward trend. Overall, the comprehensive levels of the water pollution control 219 capability in YREB have shown an upward trend but fluctuated in different degrees during the period. 220\n230 (a) Shanghai (b) Jiangsu (c) Zhejiang 231\n232 (d) Anhui (e) Jiangxi (f) Hubei 233\n234 (g)Hunan (h) Chongqing (i)Sichuan 235\n236 (j) Guizhou (k) Yunnan 237\nFig. 5.

Spatiotemporal differentiation of Coupling Coordination Degree 239 The CCD values are obtained according to the comprehensive level of economic development and water 240 pollution control capacity systems and the improved coupling coordination degree model. Fig. 6 showed variation 241 trend in CCD values between economic development and water pollution control capability systems in 2006\u20132019. 242 Obviously, CCD values in 11 regions of the YREB increased year by year during the 14 years. 243\n244\nFig. 6. Variation trend in CCD values between economic development and water pollution control capability 245 systems in 2006\u20132019. 246 According to the Chinese Five-Year Plan, the 14 years from 2006 to 2019 are divided into three periods: 247 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2019 in this study. Then, this study conducted a spatial-temporal coupling 248 analysis on CCD values of the 11 regions of the YREB in these three periods. Based on the classification standard 249 of CCD values between water pollution control capability and economic development systems in Table 3, this 250 study classified the CCD values into 3 categories and 6 levels. In order to depict the changes more visually in 251 spatial distribution of CCD values in various regions, ArcGIS software is used for spatial-temporal analysis in this 252 paper. The variation trend of the CCD values in the three Five-Year Plan is as follows: 253 The Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2006-2010): Fig. 7(a)-(b) showed variation trend in spatial distributions 254 of CCD values in years 2006 and 2010. In 2006, only Anhui province experienced moderately unbalanced 255 development state, while the coordination level in the other 10 regions of the YREB were in the barely 256 unbalanced development state. In 2010, most of the CCD classes of the two systems were at a transitional 257 development. The coordination levels of Yunnan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang provinces were 258 in a slightly balanced development state. Moreover, the coordination levels of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Guizhou, 259 and Chongqing provinces increased rapidly and were in a favorably balanced development state. Overall, the 260 CCD classes of economic development and water pollution control capability systems started at an unbalanced 261 development level, but then gradually increased in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. 262 The Twelfth Five-Year Plan period (2011-2015): Fig. 7(c)-(d) showed variation trend in spatial distributions 263 of CCD values in years 2011 and 2015. In 2011, the coordination levels of eight provinces were in a favorably 264 balanced development state. Moreover, the provinces with slightly balanced development state between the EDs 265\nand WPCCs were mainly distributed in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. In 2015, it is 266 obvious that the coordination levels of all regions were in a favorably balanced development state. Overall, 267 compared with the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the link between the economic development and water pollution 268 control capability systems showed a significant improvement, and the coordination levels between the two 269 systems improved steadily. 270 The thirteenth Five-Year Plan period (2016-2019): Fig. 7(e)-(f) showed variation trend in spatial distributions 271 of CCD values in years 2016 and 2019. In 2016, obviously, there is no change in other regions except Chongqing 272 and Shanghai provinces, where the coordination levels turned the favorably balanced development state into the 273 superiorly balanced development state. In 2019, the coordination levels of all regions were in a superiorly 274 balanced development state. During the thirteenth Five-Year Plan period, the performance levels of both the EDs 275 and WPCCs gradually increased, and the coordination state of the two systems changed from transitional 276 development to balanced development. 277\n278 (a) 2006 year (b) 2010 year 279\n280 (c) 2011 year (d) 2015 year 281\n282 (e) 2016 year (f) 2019 year 283\nFig. 7. Variation trend in spatiotemporal differentiation of CCD values during the Eleventh, Twelfth, and 284 Thirteenth Five-Year Plan 285 3.3. Major Obstacle Factors of Coupling Coordination Degree 286 3.3.1. Subsystem Obstacle Factors 287 The variation trend in factor obstacle degree of economic development subsystems for 11 regions during the 288 three Five-Year Plan period was shown in Fig. 8. The economic development system includes three subsystems: 289 economic product, economic aggregate, and residents living. Overall, in these three periods, the economic product 290 subsystem has the largest obstacle degree, and the resident living subsystem has the smallest obstacle degree, and 291 the two subsystems have little fluctuation (except Shanghai). The subsystem of economic aggregate fluctuated 292 greatly. Moreover, during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the obstacle degree of economic aggregate subsystem in 293 Jiangsu and Guizhou provinces is lower than that of resident living subsystem. To sum up, in the economic 294 development system, economic product is the key subsystem that affects the coordination level of the 11 regions. 295 Fig. 9 showed the variation trend in factor obstacle degree of water pollution control capability subsystems 296 for 11 regions during the Five-Year Plan. The water pollution control capability system includes three subsystems: 297 waste water treatment capacity, non-point source pollution control capability, and water conservation capacity. 298 There are significant differences in the obstacle degree changes of the three subsystems on the comprehensive 299 level of water pollution control capability in the 11 regions. Specifically, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the 300 waste water treatment capacity subsystem and the water conservation capacity subsystem has the largest and the 301 smallest obstacle degree for all regions, respectively. During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the obstacle degree of 302 the wastewater treatment capacity subsystem decreased greatly but non-point source pollution control capability 303 subsystem increased greatly in all regions, especially in Anhui and Yunnan provinces. During the Thirteenth Five-304 Year Plan, the obstacle degree of the three subsystems fluctuated greatly in each region. Compared to the 305 Eleventh and Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the biggest change is that the biggest obstacle affecting the coordination 306\nlevel of the system has changed from waste water treatment capacity subsystems to non-point source pollution 307 control capability subsystems. 308\n309 (a) 2006-2010 (b) 2011-2015 (c) 2016-2019 310 Fig.8.

Variation in factor obstacle degree of water pollution control capability subsystems for YREB regions 315 during the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Five-Year Plan 316 3.3.2. Indicator Level Obstacle Factors 317 According to the obstacle degree of each indicator, this study only listed the top five main obstacle indicators 318 of economic development and water pollution control capability systems for analysis. During the calculation 319 process, it is found that the obstacle degree factors of the top five in each region in each Five-Year Plan changed 320 slightly. Therefore, this study is not divided into three periods for analysis here. Tables 4 and 5 list the major 321 obstacle indicators (OI) and contribution degree (CD) to economic development and water pollution control 322 capability systems respectively. 323 As shown in Table 4, in the economic development system, obstacle degree of the gross product of tertiary 324 industry (E3), per capita gross domestic product (E4), annual per capita disposable income of urban households 325 (E12) in the 11 regions have always been in the top three, and the CD of these three indicators is close to 35%. 326 Total general public budget expenditure (E5), total investment in fixed assets (E7), total foreign capital actually 327 utilized (E8), annual per capita net income of rural households (E13), and Engle\u2019s coefficient of urban households 328 (E14) appeared in the fourth or fifth place in turn. From the frequency of occurrence, E7 have a greater impact on 329\neconomic development performance. Moreover, two indicators of economic product subsystem ranked in the top 330 five, which also indicated that this subsystem is one of the main obstacle systems affecting land use performance 331 in these regions, and it is basically consistent with the analysis of each subsystem obstacle degree in Fig. 8. 332 As shown in Table 5, compared with the economic development system, the top five obstacle indicators in 333 the water pollution control capability system have a greater variation. However, in general the OI of top five 334 ranked are mainly concentrated in the two subsystems of waste water treatment capacity and non-point source 335 pollution control capability, and the CD of these indicators is close to 50%. Specifically, obstacle degree of per 336 daily volume treated of sewage treatment facilities (W5) in the 11 regions have always been in the top one. 337 Meanwhile, it can be found that the top five obstacle factors in each region all have total volume of waste water 338 treated (W4). From the frequency of occurrence, waste water treatment rate (W1), length of drainage pipes (W2), 339 and increased soil erosion control area (W10) also have great influence on water pollution control capability 340 performance. Overall, indicators in these two subsystems have the greatest impact on the water pollution control 341 capability system of the YREB regions, which is basically consistent with the analysis of the obstacle degree of 342 each subsystem in Fig. 9. 343\n4. Discussion 346 4.1. Comprehensive Level Characteristics Analysis 347 Due to the unique regional characteristics of the YREB, this study divided the 11 regions of the YREB into 348 eastern (SH, ZJ, and JS), western (CQ, SC, GZ, and YN), and central (HB, HN, JX, and AH) regions for in-depth 349 discussion according to the natural geographical location (Tang et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2020). The YREB has 350 made remarkable achievements and its economic status in China has been rising (Li et al. 2020). According to the 351 analysis for the comprehensive level of economic development system in 11 regions of the YREB, it is obvious 352 that the comprehensive level showed a gradually increasing trend. Specifically, the economic development of the 353 11 regions showed the pattern of emphasis to the east (Yao 2018). The regions with faster comprehensive level 354 growth of the YREB are mainly distributed in the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu), the central 355 cities (Chongqing) and the provinces where important cities are located (Sichuan). In terms of geographical 356 location, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu are located at the intersection of the rivers and the seas, and there are 357 many coastal ports along the river, so the economy started faster than other regions (Miao and Sun 2020; Zhao et 358 al. 2013). Chongqing and Chengdu in Sichuan province are the Chengdu-Chongqing Area Twin-City Economic 359 Circle in China, adjacent to the Three Gorges Reservoir area in the east. Factors of production such as labor and 360 capital are more advantageous, so the economic development is growing faster than other regions (Pan et al. 2021; 361 Pan et al. 2021; Sun and Luo 2021). On the whole, the overall difference in economic development of different 362 regions of the YREB is gradually decreasing (Wu et al. 2017). 363 While maintaining sustained economic growth, it is necessary to prevent and avoid water pollution and 364 achieve efficient use of water resources. This is an objective requirement for the YREB to solve the water 365 resource crisis and realize the sustainable development (Yang and Xu 2020; Yang et al. 2015). Based on the 366 analysis of the comprehensive level of water pollution control capacity system in 11 regions of the YREB, the 367 comprehensive level of water pollution control capability system presented a trend of fluctuating growth. The 368 results showed that the water pollution control capability in the YREB had significant spatial variability and 369 regional imbalance. From 2006 to 2019, the water pollution control capability showed this pattern, eastern regions 370\n(6.93) \uff1e western regions (6.57) \uff1e central regions (6.51). In addition, this paper finds that although the water 371\npollution control capability of the YREB is increasing year by year, non-point source pollution control capability 372 and water conservation capacity is relatively low and unstable (Fig. 4b). This means that the prevention and 373 treatment of water pollution in each region of the YREB mainly focuses on industrial pollution, while agricultural 374 non-point source pollution and water conservation are less involved (Sun and Cheng 2019). In recent years, 375\nagricultural non-point source pollution has become a major challenge with the development of rural economy 376 (Xiao et al. 2019). Based on these findings, the government should focus on non-point source pollution and water 377 conservation when drafting any ecological protection plans. 378 4.2. Spatial-temporal Characteristics Analysis 379 The improved CCD model was employed to explore the coordination levels between economic development 380 and water pollution control capability systems in the YREB. In the spatial characteristics aspect, in the eleventh 381 Five-Year Plan, the CCD values of the two systems in the eastern region was higher than that in the central and 382 western regions, and this finding was similar to previous studies by Jiang et al. (2019). In this stage, the CCD 383 values in the central and western regions are in the unbalanced development and transitional development state 384 mainly because of their lagging economic development. Then, with the continuous development of the western 385 regional development strategy, the spatial differences of the 11 regions are gradually narrowing. 386 From the perspective of temporal evolution trends, the coordination level between the two systems was 387 initially moderately unbalanced development and barely unbalanced development, but this improved rapidly 388 during the eleventh Five-Year Plan. This was followed by a period of favorably balanced development state with 389 steady growth during the twelfth Five-Year Plan, and finally a period of superiorly balanced development with 390 slow growth during the thirteenth Five-Year Plan. From 2006 to 2019, the coupling coordination level between 391 the two systems in all regions of the YREB experienced three stages: unbalanced development, transitional 392 development, and balanced development. This revealed that the coordination between economic development and 393 water pollution control capability systems in the YREB is constantly improving and the spatial difference is 394 gradually narrowing. The important reason is that China has implemented many ways to promote coordinated 395 economic and environmental development in the YREB during the twelfth and thirteenth Five-Year Plan period, 396 such as (i) Issuing policy documents Guidelines of The State Council on Promoting the Development of the 397 Yangtze River Economic Belt by relying on Golden Waterways, (ii) promulgating the programmatic document 398 Outline of the Development Plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt on the major national strategy for 399 promoting the development of the YREB, and (iii) publishing the notification Ecological and Environmental 400 Protection Plan for the Yangtze River Economic Belt. These documents provided corresponding water 401 environment treatment measures and economic development direction to improve the comprehensive level of the 402 two systems (Huang et al. 2021). Overall, as the YREB has been identified as one of the three national 403 development strategies, the relationship between the two systems has been strengthened, and the coordination 404 levels of systems showed a trend of continuous optimization. 405 4.3. Major Obstacle Indicator Analysis 406\nAccording to the result analysis of subsystem obstacle factors of economic development and water pollution 407 control capability, this study found that economic product and waste water treatment capacity, and non-point 408 source pollution control capability is the three main obstacle subsystems. Residents living subsystem and water 409 conservation capacity subsystem have the least impact on CCD of the two systems. In addition, the top five 410 obstacle factors in the two system indicators are basically in the three main obstacle subsystems. Therefore, this 411 study mainly focused on the top-ranking obstacle indicators of each system for in-depth discussion. 412 In the economic development system, this study mainly discussed these major obstacle indicators, gross 413 product of tertiary industry (E3), per capita gross domestic product (E4), total investment in fixed assets (E7), and 414 annual per capita disposable income of urban households (E12). The increase of E3 is the most significant factor 415 promoting the overall economic development of the YREB, and the promotion effect is the most significant (Cai 416 et al. 2019). In addition, E3 has a significant positive role in promoting urban environmental innovation capacity 417 in the YREB, which can reduce the emission level of various industrial pollution (Bai et al. 2018; Duan et al. 2021; 418 Sun and Cheng 2019). Therefore, the YREB should vigorously develop the tertiary industry (Liang and Wang 419 2019; Lu et al. 2020). E7 has a great correlation with economic development (Xu 2015). It is precisely because of 420 the continuously increasing proportion of investment in fixed assets that Chinese economy has realized rapid 421 development to a certain extent. Also, E7 has an important impact on the environmental quality of a region (Liu et 422 al. 2017). E4 and E12 are both a standard to measure the living standards of people and important indicators to 423 reflect the overall economic activity in this region (Zhong et al. 2021). Therefore, the formulation of economic 424 development policies should pay special attention to the improve of indicators E3, E4, E7, and E12. 425 In the water pollution control capability system, these major obstacle indicators were discussed in this study, 426 waste water treatment rate (W1), length of drainage pipes (W2), total volume of waste water treated (W4), and per 427 daily volume treated of sewage treatment facilities (W5). Drainage pipes is an important engineering facility for 428 water pollution control and environment protection (Cheng et al. 2012). Industrial wastewater, domestic 429 wastewater and municipal wastewater must be collected and treated reasonably before being discharged into the 430 natural environment, so that the water environment can be properly treated from the root and people\u2019s quality of 431 life can be improved. Drainage pipes is the indispensable material basic to guarantee people\u2019s life and social 432 production for modernization, and has become one of the constraints of economic development (Qiu et al. 2011; 433 Wan et al. 2012). W2 is also the key to the efficient operation of sewage treatment facilities. In addition, higher 434 W5 can quickly treat sewage and recycle it, reducing the consumption of water resources for China\u2019s production. 435 Accordingly, Higher W1 and W4 mean that most of the production and domestic sewage in the region will be 436 treated, which can basically recover the deterioration of river and lake water ecology (Li et al. 2020). A green, 437\nsafe, and pleasant water ecological environment can be preliminarily realized. Therefore, improving W1, W2, W4, 438 and W5 indicators is the key way to improve water pollution control capability. 439 5. Conclusions and Policy Implication 440 The YREB is a highly influential economic belt and an innovative demonstration belt for the protection and 441 restoration of ecological and environmental systems. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the coupling 442 coordination levels of YREB regions between economic development and water pollution control capability. 443 Firstly, this study constructed comprehensive index systems of economic development and water pollution control 444 capability. Secondly, this study examined the CCD values and spatiotemporal differentiation between the two 445 systems in the 11 regions of the YREB from 2006 to 2019. Thirdly, the obstacle degree model was used to 446 diagnose the major obstacle subsystems and indicators. The four main conclusions are as follows: 447 (1) Through the nonlinear fitting of economic development and water pollution control capability systems in 448 the YREB, this paper found the J-shaped relationship between the two systems. These results showed that the 449 fitting accuracy is good. That is, the comprehensive level of water pollution control capability presented an 450 upward trend with the rapid development of economy. 451 (2) Due to the geographical advantages and the Chengdu-Chongqing Area Twin-City Economic Circle in 452 China, the regions with rapid growth in the comprehensive level of economic development are mainly distributed 453 in the Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu), the central cities (Chongqing) and the regions where 454 important cities are located (Sichuan). Moreover, for water pollution control capability system, it showed this 455\npattern, eastern regions \uff1e western regions\uff1e central regions. 456\n(3) The spatiotemporal differentiation between systems were analyzed based on the improved coupling 457 coordination degree model. In the spatial characteristics aspect, the CCD values between economic development 458 and water pollution control capability system in eastern China is higher than that in central and western China 459 during the eleventh Five-Year Plan, and then the difference becomes smaller. In term of temporal evolution trend, 460 the coupling coordination level in each region of the YREB experienced three stages of unbalanced development, 461 transitional, and balanced development from the eleventh to the thirteenth Five-Year Plan period. 462 (4) It is found that economic product and waste water treatment capacity, and non-point source pollution 463 control capability are the main subsystems of the obstacles. Residents living subsystem and water conservation 464 capacity subsystem have the least impact. In the indicator level, gross product of tertiary industry (E3), per capita 465 gross domestic product (E4), total investment in fixed assets (E7), annual per capita disposable income of urban 466 households (E12), waste water treatment rate (W1), length of drainage pipes (W2), total volume of waste water 467\ntreated (W4), and per daily volume treated of sewage treatment facilities (W5) were the major factors influencing 468 the coordinated development of economic development and water pollution control capability systems. 469 The results of the empirical analysis showed that the YREB is on a benign path of coupling coordination 470 development. Based on its development status and the development strategy of the YREB, this paper provided 471 several policy suggestions to promote the sustainable development of the YREB. Firstly, accelerating 472 infrastructure construction in the YREB can shorten economic distances, reduce transportation costs, and promote 473 economic development. At the same time, it can also deepen economic ties between cities and promote the 474 coupled and coordinated development of the YREB. The main measures include promoting systematic 475 management of mainline waterways and improving the function of golden waterways. Also, the government 476 should rationally arrange layout of ports and promote the construction of shipping centers and regional shipping 477 logistics center along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, so as to develop river-sea combined transport 478 services.Secondly, all regions should seize the moment of development and put the restoration of the water 479 ecological environment of the Yangtze River in a significant position. The government can clarify the spatial 480 management units of optimized development, key development, restricted development and prohibited 481 development in accordance with the positioning of main functional areas. The control of water ecological 482 environment in the YREB needs to break the boundary of administrative divisions and form joint prevention and 483 control of water ecological environment. Finally, with the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, 484 agricultural non-point source pollution will become a major challenge. Therefore, policymakers should focus on 485 the non-point source pollution and water conservation when formulating ecological protection plans. 486 The main contributions of the paper are: (1) based on the characteristics of sustainable development of the 487 YREB, this study constructed a two-coupling analysis indicator system including economic development and 488 water pollution control capability, (2) the spatiotemporal differentiation between the two systems was explored in 489 the 11 regions of the YREB during the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Five-year Plan, respectively, and (3) the 490 major factors affecting the coordinated development of economic development and water pollution prevention and 491 control capacity system have been accurately diagnosed, which provided a direction for the sustainable planning 492 of the YREB. Future studies can investigate more research and exploration of cities with distinctive development 493 models. 494\nDeclarations 495 The manuscript has not been published before and is not being considered for publication elsewhere.
