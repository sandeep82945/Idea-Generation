    "abstractText": "In this work, we describe the crazy-clock phenomenon involving the state I (low iodide and iodine concentration) to state II (high iodide and iodine concentration with new iodine phase) transition after a Briggs\u2013Rauscher (BR) oscillatory process. While the BR crazy-clock phenomenon is known, this is the first time that crazy-clock behavior is linked and explained with the symmetrybreaking phenomenon, highlighting the entire process in a novel way. The presented phenomenon has been thoroughly investigated by running more than 60 experiments, and evaluated by using statistical cluster K-means analysis. The mixing rate, as well as the magnetic bar shape and dimensions, have a strong influence on the transition appearance. Although the transition for both mixing and nomixing conditions are taking place completely randomly, by using statistical cluster analysis we obtain different numbers of clusters (showing the time-domains where the transition is more likely to occur). In the case of stirring, clusters are more compact and separated, revealed new hidden details regarding the chemical dynamics of nonlinear processes. The significance of the presented results is beyond oscillatory reaction kinetics since the described example belongs to the small class of chemical systems that shows intrinsic randomness in their response and it might be considered as a real example of a classical liquid random number generator.",

The applications of spontaneously broken symmetries cover a wide range of condensed matter science topics, such as superconductivity, super-fluidity, Bose\u2013Einstein condensation, nucleation physics, self-assembly processes, morphogenesis, and chemical kinetics.

The Briggs\u2013Rauscher (BR) [3] reaction is a hybrid oscillating reaction formed by coupling two chemical oscillators, Bray\u2013Liebhafsky [4,5] and Belousov\u2013Zhabotinskii [6]. Since its discovery in 1973, the Briggs\u2013Rauscher oscillating reaction has been one of the most investigated oscillatory systems. It is probably due to its simplicity and exciting colour alternation caused by changes in reaction kinetics (when starch is used as an indicator) [7]. BR reaction typically occurs within mixtures of H2O2, H2SO4, and KIO3. Additionally, Mn(II) ions are added as a metal catalyst and malonic acid (H2MA) as an organic substrate. Substitutions of chemicals are possible; different acids, organic substrates, and ions, such as Ce(III) instead of Mn(II) catalyst, can be used to generate BR oscillations [7\u201310]. However, the oscillatory behavior is not the only one that attracted the attention of non-linear scientists in the Briggs\u2013Rauscher reaction [11\u201315]. Indeed, as described elsewhere [16], after the well-controlled initial oscillatory behavior, the reaction becomes chaotic. Depending on the initial conditions, particularly on the ratio [H2MA]0/[IO3\u2212]0 [16,17], the reaction exhibits a sudden and unpredictable phase transition. This transition, from state I (low concentration of iodide and iodine) to state II (high concentration of iodide and iodine), happens randomly in practice, as the time spent by the system in the state I is irreproducible (see Figure 1). The transition is characterized by a \u201csharp and sudden\u201d increase of iodine and iodide concentration, followed by the formation of solid iodine. The observed stochastic feature, called a crazy clock (due to the unpredictable time needed to provoke the transition), is linked to imperfect mixing that affects convection and diffusion dynamics. The imperfect mixing results in extremely complicated phenomena, which occur on multiple length and time scales [18]. Possible kinetical consequences are the appearance of bifurcation, chaos, intermittent behavior, and symmetry-breaking [18,19]. In the experiments of our previous paper [16], the mixing was stopped after an intensive homogenization (stirring at 900 rpm) of the Briggs\u2013Rauscher solution in the oscillatory period. Herein, the experiments carried out with or without specific mixing were maintained all the time. Additionally, we apply the statistical cluster K-means analysis for the first time, by processing more than 60 experiments. Therefore, this paper further studies the mixing effects in connection to the crazy-clock phenomenon in the Briggs\u2013Rauscher oscillatory reaction. It compares and processes statistically more than #60 experiments obtained under identical initial concentrations of all reactants. Although the BR crazy-clock phenomenon was previously detected [16], this behavior is linked for the first time to symmetry-breaking, highlighting the entire process in a novel way. Furthermore, the investigated crazy clock exhibits a truly random behavior that might be considered as an example of a classical, liquid random number generator. Additionally, the investigated system also belongs to the particular class of classical systems that shows intrinsic randomness in their response (as also observed in colloid particles placed on an oscillating surface) [20,21].\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 413 3 of 13 Symmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13\n2.

            "text": "Is there a connection between the time that the system spends in the oscillatory regime (\u03c4osc) and the time when the state I to state II transition occurs (\u03c4*)? Or, in other words, are the minor differences in oscillatory period duration responsible for a significant deviation in transition appearance? The detailed exploration of the relation between BR oscillatory time, \u03c4osc, and the time \u03c4* of the occurrence of the state I\u2192state II transition (Figure 1), with and without stirring of the solutions, was performed by statistical cluster analysis (CA). Cluster analysis performs subdivision of datasets based on the relationships among their members (in our case datasets of \u03c4osc and \u03c4*). The application of CA allows the separation of data in clusters (namely, in groups) based on mutual distances, which reflect a degree of similarity among data [25]. The greater the similarity in the cluster, the higher the distance between the clusters, and hence the better the clustering. Our results combine a total of 60 experiments, obtained with no-mixing conditions (30 experiments) and with a mixing rate of 100 rpm (30 experiments). They were analyzed in the open-source statistic software \u201cR\u201d using \u201chclust\u201d algorithm for the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) [22,23]. The HCA divided the ratios \u03c4osc/\u03c4* into three clusters for both mixing and no-mixing measurements (Figure 4a,b). It can be noticed that the number of members of a particular cluster slightly changes upon alteration of experimental conditions (Table 1). It appears that the stirring effect causes an increase in the members of Cluster 1 and Cluster 3, as well as decreasing in members in Cluster 2. The increase of members in Cluster 3 suggested that stirring has prolonged time for the state I\u2192state II transition taking place (Figure 4b.). It can be also seen from the \u03c4* mean value for no-mixing \u03c4*no mix = (12 \u00b1 4) min and mixing conditions, \u03c4*mix = (17 \u00b1 5) min. Furthermore, all clusters are more compact and separated, in the case of stirring (if compared with those obtained without stirring). The results presented in Table 1 clearly indicate that the investigated crazy-clock exhibits a truly random behavior. The shift (Figure 4a,b, Table 1) in the position of the cluster centroids towards higher \u03c4* values (i.e., a delaying time to transition to happen) can be observed for the case of applied stirring conditions. Due to a small number of members, the centroid of Cluster 3, in both cases, was not calculated. Furthermore, there is no significant change in the cluster\u2019s centroid position regarding \u03c4osc oscillatory coordinate for clusters. That leads to the conclusion that the transition from state I to state II is independent of oscillatory time duration or, in other words, that the minor differences in oscillatory period duration are not responsible for a significant deviation in transition appearance. Therefore, we calculated the optimal number of clusters by a one parameter (by parameter \u03c4*) K-means analysis, for no-mixing and mixing conditions (Figure 5a,b, respectively). The determination of optimal numbers of clusters was performed using gap method in fviz_nbclust alghoritm [26]. In brief, the gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximizes the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic) [27]. As it can be seen from the Figure 5 the optimal number of clusters obtained by using one parameter K-means analysis is changed.

The State I\u2192State II Phenomenon and Its Relation to (Spontaneous) Symmetry Breaking The appearance of clusters indicates the existence of time domains where the state I to state II transition is more likely to occur. The stirring of the reaction mixture has a strong indirect influence on the state I\u2192state II transition, delaying the crazy-clock behavior, shifting cluster centroids toward higher \u03c4* values, and increasing the cluster separation (i.e., time domain separation), as well. The existence of clusters could be connected to different nucleation and growth mechanisms of iodine crystals in the case of mixing [28], and further examination of solid iodine products would be the subject of future work.\nHowever, if we assumed that state I (low iodide and iodine concentration) is the symmetric state, which under some conditions becomes absolutely unstable, then, reaching the state II (high iodide and iodine concentration, with a new I2 solid phase) could be considered as spontaneous symmetry breaking [29], see Figure 7. Such an observation of state I to state II transition could also explain the persistence of the BR system \u201cindefinitely\u201d in the state I, as obtained for strong mixing condition (see Figure 3).\nNamely, in the case of the symmetry-breaking process, the system must overcome a sufficiently large energy barrier (as s own in Figure 7). Therefore, the system\u2019s state (state I, low iodide and iodine concentration) will remain unchanged until a sufficiently large perturbation throws it over the energy barrier, \u2206V, which separates the states. We assume that \u2206V corresponds to the energy threshold of the formation of solid iodine from chemical reactions that principally occur in the BR solution after the oscillatory period. It is well-known that the post-oscillatory period could be excitable [30,31], meaning that a nonlinear system can be shifted (perturbed) from one state to another. It is usually achieved by the addition of some stable intermediate or reactants, playing the role of an external perturbation, to the reaction mixture [32]. Since, in our case, there is no external perturbants/stimulus (all experiments are conducted under identical conditions, and the system remained under constant te perature), the BR system should find an internal stimulus to overcome the energy barrier. The mixing itself should not influence activation energies of chemical reactions responsible for state I to state II transition. In other words, the energy threshold (\u2206V) should be identical for mixing and no-mixing condition. However, the system has behaved differently, and the state I to state II transition strongly depends on the mixing conditions. Therefore, some phenomena related to mixing are accountable for the obtained behavior. Figure 7 is a cartoon view that links thermodynamics (far from equilibrium) with kinetic processes driven by the gradient of diffusion/concentration. The changes in time of these local gradients are probably a source of fluctuations. When fluctuations reach a certain threshold (such as a critical number of interacted dissipative structures), a new order/phase spontaneously appears. Cluster analysis (Figures 4\u20136) allows us to group different dissipation architectures as a function of time.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 413 10 of 13Symmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 13\nFigure 7.

The mixing itself should not influence activation energies of chemical reactions responsible for state I to state II transition. In other words, the energy threshold (\u2206V) should be identical for mixing and no-mixing condition. However, the system has behaved differently, and the state I to state II transition strongly depends on the mixing conditions. Therefore, some phenomena related to mixing are accountable for the obtained behavior. Figure 7 is a cartoon view that links thermodynamics (far from equilibrium) with kinetic processes driven by the gradient of diffusion/concentration. The changes in time of these local gradients are probably a source of fluctuations. When fluctuations reach a certain threshold (such as a critical number of interacted dissipative structures), a new order/phase spontaneously appears. Cluster analysis (Figures 4\u20136) allows us to group different dissipation architectures as a function of time. The diffusion-driven instability combined with nonlinear chemical reactions (with autocatalytic steps and radical reactions) is a broad concept and it could be responsible for the \u201cinternal stimulus\u201d necessary for passing the energy barrier. The diffusion-driven instability is intensified by gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide, which are released in the BR solution during the oscillatory period [33]. Additionally, the pos-\nFigure 7.

The diffusion-driven instability is intensified by gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide, which are released in the BR solution during the oscillatory period [33]. Additionally, the possible energetic coupling between physical and chemical processes, such as the nucleation of gaseous phase (O2 and/or CO2), nucleation of solid iodine and particular chemical reactions, could also be considered as an \u201cinternal stimulus\u201d necessary for overcoming the energy barrier and breaking symmetry [34\u201336]. This proposal is actually a reformulated original idea of Turing [37], where the interplay of chemical reactions and diffusion are responsible for pattern formation in living systems. As suggested by Prigogine, the spontaneous appearance of a spatial organization via diffusion-driv n instability can be considered as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition [38]. In the pr sented work, we d al with a bulk solution and there is no visible spatial organ zation, but the spatial rganization (spati temporal pat erns) of the dentical process (state I\u2192state II transition in Briggs\u2013Rauscher reaction) in a thi layer, is very recently found by Li and coworkers [15]. Therefore, this work indirectly links spontaneous symmetry breaking and crazy-clock behavior (stochastic nature) in the bulk. The stochastic nature of state I to state II transition and its relation to symmetry breaking (and pattern formation), introduced a new approach in the investigation of crazy-clock behavior. On the other hand, the investigation of chemical systems with stochastic nature and symmetry breaking could improve our understanding of more complex phenomena in living organisms, such as morphogenesis. Additionally, this paper nominates state I\u2192state II transition as an easily available chemical system for intrinsic random number generator and thus, expands the potential application of this crazy-clock reaction.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 413 11 of 13"

            "text": "In this work, we further investigated the crazy-clock phenomenon (state I to state II transition) which occurs after a strongly reproducible Briggs\u2013Rauscher oscillatory reaction. The mixing rate, as well as the magnetic bar shape and dimensions, have a strong influence on the transition appearance. In order to better understand the stochasticity of the mentioned process, we ran more than 60 experiments (30 experiments with mixing and 30 experiments with no-mixing conditions), and we applied the statistical cluster K-means analysis. Although the transition for both mixing and no-mixing conditions are taking place completely randomly, by using statistical cluster analysis, we obtained different number of clusters pointing to different time-domains where the transition is more likely to occur. Two-parameter analysis (by oscillatory time duration, \u03c4osc and by the moment when the transition occurs, \u03c4*) suggests that the state I\u2192state II is independent of the oscillatory time duration. Therefore, we performed a one parameter analysis (by \u03c4*). In the case of no-mixing, we found one cluster, while the statistical analysis of the results for mixing conditions revealed two compact and well-separated clusters. The clustering method reveals new hidden details regarding the chemical dynamics of nonlinear processes. The state I to state II transition could be explained through a symmetry breaking approach, and the necessity of the BR system to overcome a sufficiently large energy barrier. This is the first link of the crazy-clock behavior to the symmetry breaking phenomenon. The investigation of chemical systems with stochastic nature and symmetry breaking could improve our understanding of more complex phenomena in living organisms and therefore the scope of the presented results goes beyond oscillatory reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the described example belongs to the small class of chemical systems that shows intrinsic randomness in their response and it might be considered as a real example of a classical liquid random number generator.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/sym14020413/s1, Table S1: The Briggs-Rauscher oscillogram duration (\u03c4osc), the numbers of oscillations, and state I to state II transition time (\u03c4*) when no-mixing conditions is applied: [Malonic acid]0 = 0.0789 M, [MnSO4]0 = 0.00752 M, [HClO4]0 = 0.03 M, [KIO3]0 = 0.0752 M, [H2O2]0 = 1.176 M, T= 37.0 \u25e6C, reaction volume 25 mL, Table S2: The BriggsRauscher oscillogram duration (\u03c4osc), the numbers of oscillations, and state I to state II transition time (\u03c4*) when 100 rpm mixing conditions is applied: [Malonic acid]0 = 0.0789 M, [MnSO4]0 = 0.00752 M, [HClO4]0 = 0.03 M, [KIO3]0 = 0.0752 M, [H2O2]0 = 1.176 M, T= 37.0 \u25e6C, reaction volume 25 mL.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.C.P. and B.K.; methodology, M.C.P., J.P.M., Y.C., and B.K.; statistical K-means analysis M.D.; investigation, M.C.P. and J.P.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.C.P. and B.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.C.P., B.K., Y.C., S.R.M. and T.V.; visualization, J.P.M. and B.B.
