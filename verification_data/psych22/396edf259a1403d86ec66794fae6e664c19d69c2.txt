"The broad reach of digital technologies serves as the impetus for future interventions to not only acknowledge an individualâ€™s profession but perhaps other critical factors such as their ethnicity, gender, culture, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. [...] future research needs to consider how the other demographic factors impact the different facets of care." 

"While the relationship between gender and mental health has been somewhat outlined in CWs and other PSP, future research needs to consider how the other demographic factors impact the different facets of care. A systematic review included in this review highlighted the importance of examining gender, racial, and cultural factors when designing digital mental health interventions for PSP since they may result in differential outcomes, preferences, and needs."

"Future research should also consider how the interplay between different stakeholders and organizations can impact the effectiveness of online therapies and programs. [...] Future research is needed to determine how relationships with and the perceived credibility of the stakeholders and organizations offering online evidence-based programs can impact treatment outcomes."

"Closer relationships and systematic trust within the community and PSP organizations can also generate a platform where users can provide constructive feedback on improving these evidence-based programs."
