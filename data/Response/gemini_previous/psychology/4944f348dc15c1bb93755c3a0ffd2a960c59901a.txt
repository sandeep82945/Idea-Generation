1. **Investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in MS using longitudinal imaging studies.** This could involve tracking changes in oxidative stress markers over time in people with MS, and correlating these changes with measures of neurodegeneration, such as brain atrophy or cognitive decline.


2. **Develop and validate new imaging techniques for assessing oxidative stress in MS.** This could involve exploring the use of novel MRI sequences, PET tracers, or other imaging modalities to measure oxidative stress markers in the brain.


3. **Investigate the effects of antioxidant therapies on oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in MS.** This could involve conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant supplements or drugs in reducing oxidative stress and slowing neurodegeneration in people with MS.


4. **Explore the role of oxidative stress in the development of new MS therapies.** This could involve investigating the potential of antioxidant therapies to prevent or slow the progression of MS, or the use of imaging techniques to identify people with MS who are most likely to benefit from antioxidant therapy.


5. **Investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and other risk factors for MS.** This could involve studying the role of oxidative stress in the development of MS in people with other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or exposure to environmental toxins.
