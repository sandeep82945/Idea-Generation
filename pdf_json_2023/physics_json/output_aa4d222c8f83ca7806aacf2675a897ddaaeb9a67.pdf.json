    "abstractText": "Suppressing the oxidation of active-Ir(III) in IrOx catalysts is highly desirable to realize an efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction inwater electrolysis. Although charge replenishment from supports can be effective in preventing the oxidation of IrOx catalysts, most supports have inherently limited charge transfer capability. Here, we demonstrate that an excess electron reservoir, which is a charged oxygen species, incorporated in antimony-doped tin oxide supports can effectively control the Ir oxidation states by boosting the charge donations to IrOx catalysts. Both computational and experimental analyses reveal that the promoted charge transfer driven by excess electron reservoir is the key parameter for stabilizing the active-Ir(III) in IrOx catalysts. When used in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer, Ir catalyst on excess electron reservoir incorporated support exhibited 75 times higher mass activity than commercial nanoparticle-based catalysts and outstanding longterm stability for 250 h with a marginal degradation under a water-splitting current of 1 A cm. Moreover, Ir-specific power (74.8 kWg) indicates its remarkable potential for realizing gigawatt-scale H2 production for the first time.",

Although charge replenishment from supports can be effective in preventing the oxidation of IrOx catalysts, most supports have inherently limited charge transfer capability. Here, we demonstrate that an excess electron reservoir, which is a charged oxygen species, incorporated in antimony-doped tin oxide supports can effectively control the Ir oxidation states by boosting the charge donations to IrOx catalysts. Both computational and experimental analyses reveal that the promoted charge transfer driven by excess electron reservoir is the key parameter for stabilizing the active-Ir(III) in IrOx catalysts. When used in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer, Ir catalyst on excess electron reservoir incorporated support exhibited 75 times higher mass activity than commercial nanoparticle-based catalysts and outstanding longterm stability for 250 h with a marginal degradation under a water-splitting current of 1 A cm\u22122. Moreover, Ir-specific power (74.8 kWg\u22121) indicates its remarkable potential for realizing gigawatt-scale H2 production for the first time.\nSince hydrogen energy has emerged as a viable alternative under the global environmental crisis due to its zero-emission nature1,2, researchers have devoted extensive efforts over the past several decades toward realizing carbon-free production of hydrogen3. More recently, economical and scalable hydrogen production using surplus electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been attempted4\u20136. In particular, polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) has been explored as a promising candidate for this due to its superior energy efficiency, purity of the generated hydrogen, and ability to operate at high current densities7. However, the commercialization of PEMWE is being hampered by the large overpotential and inevitable use of a substantial amount of high-cost noble metals, which are deeply associated with the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions8. Furthermore, in order to meet the high standards of industrial applications, a large loading amount (usually over at least 0.5 mg cm\u22122) of Ir is required, greatly increasing the total cost4,9. To address these issues, extensive studies have been\nReceived: 2 March 2023\nAccepted: 18 August 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Department ofMaterials Science andEngineering,KoreaAdvanced Institute of Science andTechnology, 291Daehak-ro, Yuseong-guDaejeon34141, Republic of Korea. 2Hydrogen\u00b7Fuel Cell Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, 14-gil 5, Hwarang-ro, Seongbuk-gu Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea. 3Computational Science Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, 14-gil 5, Hwarang-ro, Seongbuk-gu Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea. 4Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA02139, USA. 5Department of Environment and Energy Engineering, Sungshin Women\u2019s University, 55, Dobong-ro 76ga-gil, Gangbuk-gu Seoul 01133, Republic of Korea. 6Materials Architecturing Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), 14-gil 5, Hwarang-ro, Seongbuk-gu Seoul 02792, Republic of Korea. 7These authors contributed equally: Gyu Rac Lee, Jun Kim, Doosun Hong. e-mail: donghun@kist.re.kr; jinykim@kist.re.kr; ysjung@kaist.ac.kr\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5402 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nconducted to enhance both the activity and stability of Ir-based catalysts while minimizing the use of Ir10\u201314.\nIrOx, which is typically formed during initial activation cycling of Ir catalysts, is known to exhibit higher activity toward the OER compared tometallic Ir or IrO2 due to its multiple valence states\n15\u201317. In particular, a linear correlation was observed between the catalytic activity of IrOx and the fraction of Ir(III) species\n15,18. However, due to the electrochemical nature of the OER, Ir(III) tends to be oxidized to Ir(IV) or Ir(V) as the reaction proceeds. During the oxidation of Ir(III), the formation of soluble intermediates leads to gradual Ir dissolution and degradation of the catalytic performance over time15,19,20. The previous approaches to develop Ir-based electrocatalysts have mainly been focused on enhancing activity, without sufficiently reflecting catalyst deterioration and the durability issue21. Alternatively, sustainably retaining active-Ir(III) species is considered one of the most desired strategies to overcome the fundamental trade-off relationship between activity and durability22,23, but remains a difficult challenge to realize under the harsh electrochemical conditions of OER.\nWith these motivations, efforts were recently directed to identifying suitable metal oxide supports that could offer stronger interactions with catalysts and, as a result, enhanced charge transfer17,24\u201326. Charge transfer from the metal oxide supports to Ir catalysts can be associated with improvements in both OER activity and durability because a higher fraction of Ir(III) species would be maintained by the constant replenishment of charge from the supports during the reaction27. Indeed, attempts to control metal-support interactions to enhance OER performance were reported in only a few studies, and they were based on complicated compositions or complex metal oxides composites such as TiON, Nb0.05Ti0.95O2, and TiO2-MoOx\n28\u201330. This is because common metal oxides have difficulty in overcoming the limited charge transfer capability due to their innate electronic structure31,32. Moreover, unfortunately, enhanced charge transfer capability of these convoluted materials is observed only for very restricted complex compositions. Recently, an additional defect engineering approach for metal oxide supports was also reported, where the formation of oxygen vacancies (VO) was effective in reinforcing the charge transfer capability by increasing the number of electrons in the entire system33. However, cation leaching, which occurs mainly due to the slow compensation rate of VO, leads to structural collapse34\u201336. Overall, these previous studies suggest the need to develop a more universal catalyst support design that can more sustainably boost the charge transfer frommetal oxide supports to IrOx and, as a result, stabilize Ir(III) species without structural deformation.\nIn this study, we introduce a unique support modification strategy, namely, an excess electron reservoir (EER), which serves as an electron-donating layer, formed on a metal oxide support to preserve Ir(III) states via charge replenishment. Using a model system composed of an IrOx catalyst and antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) as a base support material, we identified charged-oxygen groups (O- and O2\n-) as an optimal EER material. They are thermodynamically stable and could potentially maximize charge donation to IrOx. O2\n- layers were experimentally in situ formed on ATO support under oxygen-rich evaporative deposition conditions of ATO. The Ir catalysts placed on EER-incorporated ATO demonstrated significantly enhanced mass activity, around 75 times higher than those of commercial Ir nanoparticle catalysts, and long-term stability over 250 h at 1.0 A cm\u22122 current density (0.624mV/h) in a PEMWE single cell. Our results clearly overcome the hitherto unresolved trade-off relationships between catalytic activity and durability in PEMWE. Employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and densityfunctional-theory (DFT) analyses, we reveal that these improvements are associatedwith stabilization of Ir(III) species due to the promoted charge transfer by the EER."

            "text": "Design and fabrication of EER-contained support material Figure 1a illustrates the proposed role of the EER by comparing cases with and without EER, which is located between the support and IrOx catalyst. The structure was designed to transfer more electrons to IrOx and boost the catalytic performance15,18. With the EER residing on top of the support, the electronic interaction between the catalyst and support can be reinforced to allow a high fraction of Ir(III) species in the IrOx catalyst. First, in order to identify promising candidate materials for the EER, DFT calculation-based screening was performed (Supplementary Fig. 1). We hypothesized that key requirements of the EER are structural stability and enhanced electron donation from the support to IrOx. In this regard, we used three criteria for the DFT screening processes, as depicted in Fig. 1b: EER processability, adsorption energy between EER and underlying ATO (Eads), and charge transfer capability between the support and IrOx. In the EER processability stage, we assumed that desirable candidates for the EER should reserve more electrons within, and preferably the constituent elements should be non-metals with high electron affinities. Therefore, nine nonmetallic atomicor diatomic species (B, N,O, F, P, S, N2, O2, and F2) and their appropriate oxidation charge states (between 0 and -3) were adopted for the subsequent DFTmodeling. In the next stage, the structural stability of the EER was evaluated. Adsorption energy (Eads) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 2) revealed that several extrinsic species including B, N, P, and S are thermodynamically unstable (Eads >0), and as a result not suitable for the EER (Fig. 1c). Lastly, the EERdriven charge transfer ability (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4) was also evaluated, and those with lower transfer values (<0.10 e-) were excluded (Fig. 1c). As a result, charged oxygen species (O- and O2 -) and Ffinally remained as promising EER candidates. In this work, charged oxygen species are selected because, in order to generate F- on the surface of ATO, additional processes such as reactive-ion plasma treatment must be accompanied. In contrast, charged-oxygen groups can be formed in situ during the process of ATO deposition37, and the detailed fabrication process will be described below.\nThe XPS depth profile of an e-beam deposited SnOx thin film with ~50 nm thickness on the Si substrate exhibited that the atomic ratio of O and Sn changes along the depth of the thin film (Fig. 1d). In particular, there is an oxygen-rich bottom surface with a thickness of about 5 nm, which indicates that the initially deposited SnOx thin film has a high O/Sn ratio. E-beam irradiation can reduce metal oxides37,38, which causes dissociation of the SnO2 source into two elemental species (O and Sn) with distinct volatilities and kinetics. Thus, high oxygen composition is attained at the initial stage of the film deposition until equilibrium is reached. Different from bulk SnO2, e-beam evaporationdeposited SnOx demonstrated a Raman peak emerging at around 1100\u20131200 cm\u22121, corresponding to O2\n- (Fig. 1e)39,40, which is one of the candidates for EER deduced from the DFT calculations. Moreover, the atomic ratio of O and Sn in deposited SnOx can be controlled by selecting an initiation point of e-beam deposition, as shown in Fig. 1d, enabling the fabrication of SnOxwith varied EER content. Based on this EER-incorporated SnOx, Sb was additionally added as an n-dopant to enhance electrical conductivity. XPS analysis was performed to quantify the oxygen contents and analyze their chemical states of ATOwith three different relative densities of EER (Supplementary Fig. 5): sparse, moderate, and dense EER ATO (S-ATO, M-ATO, and D-ATO). The O/Sn and SnSatellite/SnIV ratios can experimentally distinguish the S-ATO, MATO, and D-ATO samples. It can be seen that as more EER is incorporated, the intensity of the oxygen peak becomes higher compared to the Sn peak and the ratio of O2\n- to lattice oxygen is also higher, in comparison with the bulk sample. Indeed, D-ATO presents the highest O/Sn ratio of 0.94, which is larger than the values of 0.569 for M-ATO and 0.401 for S-ATO. In addition, it can be seen that as more EER is contained, the ratio of SnSatellite/SnIV obtained through deconvolution of the Sn 3d spectra is higher (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5402 2\nindicate that the O2 --based EER can be obtained with one-step deposition of SnOx without the need of an additional treatment or deposition process."

Successful doping of Sb in the SnO2 matrix was confirmed by the shift of Sb 3d peaks to higher binding energy (~542 eV (3d5/2)) after annealing (Supplementary Fig. 7)42.\nThe transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that Ir nanoparticles with a diameter of 2\u201310 nm are well distributed on the surface of the D-ATO support (Fig. 2c). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images also exhibit that all the elements such as Sn, Sb, and Ir are uniformly present throughout the whole nanowires (Supplementary Fig. 8). As shown in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (right lower inset image in Fig. 2c, d), the crystallinity of the Ir catalysts and D-ATO support improved after thermal annealing. In particular, most of the exposed crystal planes are mainly composed of Ir (111) andATO (110) planes. These results are consistentwith the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, as shown in Fig. 2e. In the XRD spectra, the sharp and narrow peaks at the thermally annealed Ir/ D-ATO exhibited enhanced crystallinity compared to the pristine sample. The peak positions of Ir and ATO in Ir/D-ATO are coincident with those of references such as bulk ATO, Ir/C, and Ir black powder, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9). A XPS analysis was carried out to\nidentify the chemical state of the Ir/D-ATO (Fig. 2f). By deconvoluting the Ir 4f peaks into metallic Ir, Ir(III), and Ir(IV), while considering factors such as the Functional Lorentzian (LF) lineshape and Ir 5p \u00bd peak, it was confirmed that the fractions of each component were 55.10%, 4.92%, and 39.28%, respectively43,44. Most of the Ir nanoparticles in the as-prepared Ir/D-ATO existed in the form of metallic Ir or Ir(IV), and the fraction of Ir(III) was significantly lower.\nThe final morphology of the basic building block\u2014Ir/D-ATO (width: 50 nm/pitch: 400nm)\u2014was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in the upper left inset of Fig. 2c.

The overallmorphology of Ir/CNW is similar to the Ir/D-ATO, except that the material constituting the support is graphite carbon (Supplementary Fig. 11). We measured the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Ir/D-ATO, Ir/CNW, Ir/C, and Ir black through a CO strippingmethod45 (Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 3c, Ir/ D-ATO exhibited the highest ECSA of \u2248132 m2 g\u22121, which is almost 2.7 times higher than that of Ir/C or Ir black (\u224849 m2 g\u22121). In addition, Ir/ CNW also showed an enhanced ECSA compared to the nanoparticletype commercial catalysts. This is because the small amount of Ir (Supplementary Table 1) is evenly dispersed on the entire 3Dnanostructured supports, which have a fully accessible large surface area due to the entirely connected channel structures. To compare the OER activities of each catalyst precisely, we measured the current density through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 3a) and calculated the mass activity by normalizing the current density values at 1.55 VRHE with the Ir loading amount and the specific activity by normalizing themass activity with the ECSA of the catalysts, respectively.

The Ir loading amount on Cu foil can accurately represent the amount of Ir loading on the glassy carbon electrode or Nafion membrane. This is due to the absence of damage during the etching of Cu foil and the subsequent transfer processes (Supplementary Fig. 13). The mass activity (5.975 A mgIr\n\u22121) of the Ir/DATO corresponds to a value almost 11 times higher than the performance (0.533A mgIr \u22121) of Ir black and (0.510 A mgIr \u22121) of Ir/C (Fig. 3g). Thesemass activity values of the commercial catalysts are comparable to values reported in recent studies16. Furthermore, 5.975 AmgIr\n\u22121 is the highest mass activity value ever reported for Ir-based catalysts using metal oxide supports (Supplementary Table 2).\nHowever, the large ECSA of Ir/D-ATO alone cannot explain the significant improvement of the mass activity. Therefore, the specific activity representing the intrinsic activity of catalysts should be considered. As shown in Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 2, Ir/D-ATO also presents superior specific activity compared to the other catalysts and Ir-based catalysts using metal oxide supports reported previously. In particular, the comparison with Ir/CNW using the same 3D nanostructure indicates that there is an additional factor leading to the enhancement of specific activity in addition to the promoted mass transport in our 3D woodpile electrocatalysts16,46. In general, it is well known that the interactionbetween the carbon support and catalysts is too weak to augment the intrinsic activity of catalysts17. The specific activity of the Ir/D-ATO was measured to be almost 273% larger than those of Ir/CNW, despite similar ECSA values. These features support that the presence of the EER on the support plays an important role in the superior OER activity of Ir/D-ATO. Moreover, a consistent trend was confirmed in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis at 1.55 VRHE (Supplementary Fig. 14). Both Ir/D-ATO and Ir/ CNW exhibited similar Ohmic resistance to that of Ir/C or Ir black, indicating comparable conductivity of the electrons and protons. However, the charge transfer resistance of the Ir/D-ATO is significantly improved compared to other catalysts. This also suggests that the EER on the support can accelerate the overall charge transfer of Ir/D-ATO during the OER process.\nWe also assessed the long-term stability of the Ir/D-ATO by measuring the potential to obtain constant current density together with the reference samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, degradation of the catalytic activity is indicated by a gradual increase in potential. During the stability test, the potential for carbon-supported Ir catalysts (Ir/C, Ir/CNW) sharply increased after 8 to 10 h, and for Ir black, the catalytic activity seriously degraded after 7 h. On the contrary, the estimated potential of Ir/D-ATO was maintained over 20 h, which means no degradation occurred during the test. Higher current density (10mA cm\u22122) was also applied to evaluate the durability of the catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 15). It is well known that the glassy carbon working electrode can also suffer damage at high current density, which affects the stability of catalysts47,48. To mitigate carbon corrosion and detachment of Ir catalysts from the backing electrode under harsh conditions, a Ti plate was used as a substrate. When such a high current density was applied to the catalysts, Ir/C degraded almost immediately, and Ir black also lost most of its catalytic activity in less than 3 h. However, Ir/D-ATO showed only a slight increase of potential andmaintained its activity for about 18 h. Mostly, degradation of catalysts is caused by dissolution and detachment during the oxidation of the Ir surface15,49,50. To quantify the absolute Ir dissolution after the stability measurement, wemeasured the potential for 15 h at 1 mA cm\u22122. The dissolved Ir in the electrolyte was evaluated using ICP-MS, which confirmed a low Ir mass loss of about 21.3% of the initial Ir loading. Charge transfer of the EER-contained support can prevent the oxidation of Ir catalysts and serves to maintain them, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Ir, leading to superior durability of Ir/DATO. Overall, the enhanced OER performance of Ir/D-ATO can be attributed to the intensified metal-support interaction by the EER.\nTo elucidate the effect of the EER on the OER performance, three different catalysts (Ir/ATOs) with varying density of EER (dense, moderate, and sparse EER) on the surfaceofATOwere fabricated: Ir/D-ATO, Ir/M-ATO, and Ir/S-ATO. We confirmed that these three catalysts formed on the different supports have no difference in physical and chemical characteristics. There was no significant dissimilarity in structuralmorphology, particle size distribution of Ir, and crystallinity, as confirmed through TEM and HRTEM images (Supplementary\nFig. 16). It was also confirmed through a XPS analysis (Supplementary\nFig. 18) that the chemical state of the as-synthesized catalysts was similar. Thismeans that only the specific activity, not the ECSA, affects the catalytic performance. According to the LSV curves in Fig. 3d, there is a positive correlation between the density of EER contained in the ATOsupport and the catalytic activity. Also, theTafel slopeof Ir/D-ATO (49.05mV dec\u22121, Fig. 3e) showed a lower value compared to Ir/M-ATO (51.40mVdec\u22121) and Ir/S-ATO (59.33mVdec\u22121), indicating that Ir/DATO is more suitable for boosting OER kinetics. The stability of the catalysts was also evaluated based on the content of the EER, and it is found that the trend for the stability is identical to that for the activity (Fig. 3f). These improvements in both the activity and stability with a higher density of EER in ATO strongly indicate a sustainable charge transfer effect between the EER-incorporated support and Ir. A more detailed fundamental analysis to elucidate the relationship between the EER and the OER performance is discussed in the next section.\nCharacterization of O2- anion-mediated electron transfer In order to further verify whether the enhanced electrocatalytic activity anddurability benefits from the intensified interactions caused by EER, a further XPS analysis was conducted. The Ir 4f spectra were deconvoluted to compare the ratio ofmetallic Ir, Ir(III), and Ir(IV) of the catalysts attained in each sample: as-synthesized, post-activation, and post-accelerated degradation test (ADT) with Ir/ATOs as well as the other catalysts (Supplementary Figs. 17, 18, and 19)43. First, from the comparison of the oxidation states of Ir/D-ATO and Ir/CNW summarized in Supplementary Fig. 20, it was confirmed that, despite that the same method is employed for forming the Ir catalysts, the catalystsupport interaction (CSI) effect significantly depends on the type of support materials. More electrons are supplied from the EERcontained ATO to the catalysts compared to graphite carbon, which leads to a high Ir(III) ratio across all stages of the samples.Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 4a, there is a small variation in the proportion of Ir(III) in the as-synthesized samples, and a relatively higher Ir(III) portion is exhibited for Ir/D-ATO. Furthermore, after the electrochemical activation, the ratio of Ir(III) species increasedwith the EER content, and Ir/ D-ATO exhibited the highest Ir(III) portion (20.69%). In particular, the Ir(III) to Ir(IV) ratio (RIII/IV) of the Ir/D-ATO was calculated to be 0.563, which corresponds to approximately 1.44 times and 1.77 times that of Ir/M-ATO and Ir/S-ATO, respectively. These results indicate that more electrons are supplied from the supports to the catalysts due to the intensified metal-support interaction induced by the EER, and the amount of charge transfer is proportional to the density of EER. The effects of the EER on the oxidation states of IrOx can be affirmedmore clearly after the ADT. For the case of Ir/D-ATO, not only did the overall portion of Ir(III) increase, but the ratio of Ir(III) to Ir(IV) also significantly rose to 0.757, which is 1.34 times higher than the value of the post-activation sample. On the other hand, the other catalysts with lower EER density exhibited a substantial decrease of Ir(III)/Ir(IV) after the ADT. Finally, Sn 3d and Sb 3d spectra were also analyzed to investigate any changes in the chemical composition of the support after the ADT, and it was verified that there was no noticeable difference, except for a slight shift (0.65 eV) of the Sn 3d peak compared to the initial status (Supplementary Fig. 21).\nBesides the XPS analysis, we additionally performed DFT calculations to understand the origin of electron transfer with varying O2 - concentrations in the EER (Fig. 4b\u2013e). The DFT model system is\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5402 6\ncomposed of an Ir4O8 cluster and an underlying EER-contained ATO slab. The ATO slabs are (110) surface-exposed and contain 8wt% antimony, which is close to the experimentally fabricated value (10wt%). Within the EER, O2\n- anion concentrations were controlled to simulate the differences among experimental Ir/D-ATO, Ir/M-ATO, and Ir/S-ATO. In Fig. 4c, d, where the electron transfer behaviors were visualized along the c-axis, the increase of O2- concentration in EER indeed boosts the electron transfer from the ATO slab to the Ir4O8 cluster. This validates our hypothesis that the support incorporating the EER can modulate the strength of support-catalyst interactions.\nNext, a Bader charge analysis in DFT modeling was performed to identify the charge states of Ir species in the catalysts (Ir4O8). The\ndonated electrons from the EER-contained ATO slabs would alter the charge states of each Ir andO atom, as shown in the population density plots in Fig. 4e. EER donates electrons to the Ir4O8 cluster, which results in decreases in the charge states of both Ir and O species. The increase of O2\n- anion concentration causes a decrease of Ir charge states (the peaks moving to the left), which adequately explains the experimental observation that the relatively lower charge states of Ir (metallic Ir and Ir(III)) were themost extensively found in the Ir/D-ATO sample, compared to Ir/M-ATO and Ir/S-ATO. These DFT analyses reveal that the larger amount of Ir(III) in Ir/D-ATO results from the increased O2\n- anion concentrations in the EER-contained ATO supports.

Despite the ultralow Ir loading (7.2 \u00b5gIr cm \u22122) of Ir/D-ATO, the catalytic performance of Ir/D-ATO far exceeded those of the Ir/TiO2 and Ir black samples (Fig. 5a), and the mass activity of Ir/D-ATO was 55 and 75 times higher than those of high-loaded Ir/TiO2 and Ir black at 1.6 V, respectively (Fig. 5b). In addition, the PEMWE single cell at Ir loading of 47.5 \u00b5gIr\ncm\u22122 operated for over 250h at 1 A cm\u22122 (Fig. 5e) and 500h at 0.5 A cm\u22122 (Supplementary Fig. 29) current densities without any significant degradation of cell voltage, with degradation rates of only 0.624mV/h and 0.184mV/h, respectively.\nIn particular, at low Ir loading, a uniformly connected 3D nanostructure of Ir/D-ATO (Supplementary Fig. 25) is desirable in that forming of a homogeneous and continuous catalyst layer is critical to good catalytic performance. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 26, the commercial Ir black and Ir/TiO2 are composed of relatively larger nanoparticles (>100nm), resulting in discontinuous and non-uniform catalyst layers at low Ir loadings (Supplementary Figs. 27a and 28a); it is highly likely that many small segments in the catalyst layer are not connected to theTi porous transport layer (PTL)with aporosity of60% (Supplementary Fig. 30). Consequently, the charge transfer resistance of the low-loaded Ir black and Ir/TiO2 is considerably higher than that of the Ir/D-ATO (Fig. 5c), resulting in inferior catalytic performance.

This is attributable to the reduced charge transfer resistance, as evidenced by the Nyquist plots of the highly-loaded catalyst layers, which are not notably different from that of Ir/D-ATO (Supplementary\nwhere i is the current density (A cm\u22122),HHV is the higher heating value of H2 (286 kJmol\n\u22121), F is the Faraday constant (96485Cmol\u22121), and l is the Ir loading (mg cm\u22122). The high Ir-specific power of Ir/D-ATO shows the potential to further extend its composition and patterned nanostructure in practical circumstances. In addition, the actual electrode size achievable with the nanotransfer printing technique that we used depends on the size of the master template wafer, and scalability up to 8 inches was already demonstrated in our previous study56. Overall, it may be promising in gigawatt-scale H2 production since the necessary Ir-specific power for such scalewaspredicted to be 50\u2013100 kWg\u22121 depending on several conditions57, which was unprecedented until the present work."

As a result, the highest values for both mass activity and Ir-specific power, which were estimated in a single-cell PEMWE, among Ir-based electrocatalysts reported to date were achieved. Moreover, the PEMWE incorporating the EER-supported Ir catalyst exhibited high durability over 250h at 1.0 A cm\u22122 condition despite remarkably low loading of Ir. We provided evidence that the degree of charge transfer of metal oxide supports, which is a key parameter in improving the OER performance, can be artificially controlled by engineering the density of EER, as revealed by our theoretical and experimental studies. More specifically, we confirmed that a higher density of EER contributes to the maintenance of a higher Ir(III) to Ir(IV) ratio during ADT. Our findings overcome the limited charge transfer properties of typical metal oxides by forming the EER at the surface as an excellent promotor of charge transfer, suggesting new design rules to develop metal oxide support materials for higher performance OER electrocatalysts. We believe that our strategy can be extended to various metal oxide applications where the overall performance is closely related to charge transfer capability, including fuel cells, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics."

A line-patterned master template pretreated by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Polymer Source Inc.) brush with a low surface energy was prepared. On top of the line-patterned master template, a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, Sigma-Aldrich\nInc.) solution was spin-coated to form a polymer replica. Polyimide adhesive tape (PI, 3M Inc.) was then attached to the surface of the polymer replica to peel off the polymer replica from the master template. Both metals (Ir, Sb, iTASCO) and metal oxide (SnO2, iTASCO) were deposited sequentially through oblique-angle deposition (tilt angle: 80\u00b0) to form a discrete nanowire array on the PMMA replica using an e-beam evaporator. The EER content of the deposited SnOx nanowires could be adjusted by controlling the start time of e-beam evaporation through the shutter. The start time was specified by the XPS depth profile (Fig. 1d) of the e-beam deposited SnOx thin film. For dense EER SnOx nanowires, the shutter was opened immediately after the e-beamwas turnedon. The shutterwasopened for sparseEERSnOx nanowires after 20 nm of SnO2 was deposited according to the thickness monitor. After deposition of all the components, the discrete nanowire array was transfer-printed onto a Cu foil and then the PMMA replica was removed by toluene immersion. By repeating the transferprinting of the deposited nanowire array in the perpendicular direction of the previous array sequentially, multilayer stacked 3-dimensional nanostructures were formed. Finally, the resulting product was annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 2 h in Ar conditions to form ATO and spherical shape Ir nanoparticles on the surface of ATO (Supplementary Fig. 10). To transfer the Ir/ATOs onto a glassy carbon working electrode for half-cell measurement or a Nafion membrane for singlecell measurement, the Cu foil was wet-etched with a 0.1M ammonium persulfate solution (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.). After etching theCu substrate, the Ir/ATOs floating in the ammonium persulfate solution were transferred to a specified substrate for electrochemical measurements. In the case of Ir/CNW, all the fabrication processes described above were equally applied except for depositing graphite carbon as a support material."

All of the potentials indicated in electrochemical data were converted to the RHE scale by equation below:\nERHE = EAg=AgCl + 0:059\u00d7pH+ E o Ag=AgCl \u00f02\u00de\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:5402 9\nwhere E\u00b0Ag/AgCl is 0.197 V at room temperature. 100% iR-correctionwas conducted to compensate for ohmic drop in the electrolyte. Amixture of 3.5mg of Ir black commercial catalyst (Premetek), 2.0mL of deionized (DI) water, 8.0mL of isopropyl alcohol, and 40\u03bcL of Nafion solution (5wt%, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) was prepared as a catalyst ink. After sonicationof the prepared ink solution for about 30min, 10\u03bcL of catalyst ink was dropped onto a working electrode, where the corresponding amount of Ir loading was about 17.8\u03bcg cm\u22122. The same processes were applied to the Ir/C (20wt%, Premetek) commercial catalysts.\nFirst, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted in a range of 0.05 V to 1.4 V at a scan rate of 200mVs\u22121 in Ar-saturated0.05MH2SO4 electrolyte until the entire surface of the Ir catalyst was oxidized to a hydrated Ir oxide. The formationofhydrated Ir oxide canbeconfirmed through the absenceof further change in theCVcurves or thedecrease of theHUPDpeak intensity. After activation, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were carried out between 1.2 V and 1.7 V at a scan rate of 5mV s\u22121 under a working electrode rotation of 1600 rpm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 1.55 VRHE from 1Hz to 100 kHz. The intercept with x-axis at a high frequency region in the Nyquist plot (34\u201337\u03a9) was used as electrolyte resistance for iR-correction. A long-term stability test of each catalyst was accomplished through chronopotentiometry (CP),where the potential value was measured to obtain constant current densities of 1 and 10mAcm\u22122 with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. At 1 and 10mAcm\u22122 conditions, a glassy carbon working electrode and Ti plate were used as substrates, respectively. In addition, an accelerated durability test (ADT) was conducted via potential-cycling between 1.2 V and 1.6 V at a scan rate of 50mV s\u22121. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of each catalyst was calculated by the CO stripping method. The current peak over the range of 0.7 V to 1.15 V corresponds to the desorption peak of CO molecules on the Ir surface. The peak area was calculated and normalized by the specific charge value (420 \u03bcC cm\u22122Ir) to give the ECSA."

            "text": "DFTcalculationswere carriedout using theplane-wave-basisVienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code with an energy cutoff of 400 eV58,59. The projector-augmented wave method was adopted to treat core and valence electrons60. The generalized gradient approximation was used to describe the exchange-correlational interactions with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional61. To calculate the simulation systemswith the several EER candidates in Fig. 1, wemodeled the (110) ATO surfaces of periodically repeated 2\u00d7 2 supercells with three trilayers and a vacuum width of 15 \u212b. Here, the Brillouin zone was sampledwith a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1Monkhorst\u2212Pack k-pointmesh. Todescribe the O2\n\u2212 anion as an EER in more detail, we modeled a larger system in the calculations of Fig. 4 than that those of Fig. 1. The ATO support was described as 2 \u00d74 supercell in the lateral direction and a five-trilayerthick ATO (110) surface with a vacuum width of 20 \u212b. The most preferred adsorption configuration of O2\n- anion on the ATO (110) surface is side-on adsorption between two Sn atoms (Supplementary Fig. 23). For the larger supercell, Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using Monkhorst\u2212Pack k-point samplings of 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. The geometry was fully relaxed until the maximum Hellmann\u2212Feynman forces were less than 0.02 eV/\u212b, and the electronic structures were relaxed with a convergence criterion of 10-5 eV. A Bader charge analysis was performed to investigate the charge states of Ir and O atoms in the Ir4O8 cluster62.\nMembrane electrode assembly (MEA) preparation and singlecell measurements The Ir/D-ATO catalyst was loaded on a Nafion 212 membrane (1 cm2 active area) as the anode catalyst, and a Pt/C catalyst (46.3 wt%, Tanaka) was used as the cathode catalyst. For comparison, Ir black\n(Premetek) and Ir/TiO2 (Elyst 75, Umicore) were used as the anode catalysts. Besides the Ir/D-ATO, a homogeneous catalyst ink was prepared by mixing each catalyst with 5wt% Nafion solution and isopropanol. A specific catalyst ink was sprayed directly onto the Nafion 212membrane (1 cm2 active area). For the cathode, 0.1mgPt cm\n\u22122 (Pt/C) was loaded with 25wt% Nafion content, and 39BB (Sigracet) was used as a gas diffusion layer. For the anode, 0.01 or 0.5 mgIr cm\n\u22122 (Ir black and Ir/TiO2) was loaded with 10wt% Nafion content, and Ti felt (Bekaert, 250 \u00b5m) was used as a porous transport layer. Single-cell measurements were conducted with a potentiostat (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT302N) equipped with a 10 A current booster. The cell was operated at 80 \u00b0C under ambient pressure, and deionized water was fed to the anode side at a flow rate of 15mLmin\u22121. The EIS was conducted at 1.5 V from 10\u22121 to 105 Hz with a potential amplitude of 10mV."
