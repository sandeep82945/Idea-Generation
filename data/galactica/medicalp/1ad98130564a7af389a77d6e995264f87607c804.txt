Brain tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is critical for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of therapeutic outcomes. Thus, this research introduces a novel hybrid approach that combines handcrafted features with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation. In this study, handcrafted features were extracted from MRI scans that included intensity-based, texture-based, and shape-based features. In parallel, a unique CNN architecture was developed and trained to detect the features from the data automatically. The proposed hybrid method was combined with the handcrafted features and the features identified by CNN in different pathways to a new CNN. In this study, the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge dataset was used to measure the performance using a variety of assessment measures, for instance, segmentation accuracy, dice score, sensitivity, and specificity. The achieved results showed that our proposed approach outperformed the traditional handcrafted feature-based and individual CNN-based methods used for brain tumor segmentation. In addition, the incorporation of handcrafted features enhanced the performance of CNN, yielding a more robust and generalizable solution. This research has significant potential for real-world clinical applications where precise and efficient brain tumor segmentation is essential. 1. conclusions In this research, a hybrid approach for brain tumor segmentation that combines handcrafted features and CNNs is presented. The methodology involved data acquisition and pre-processing, feature extraction, CNN architecture, and the integration of handcrafted features and CNNs. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrated a superior performance compared to individual handcrafted feature-based and CNN-based methods. The integration of handcrafted features and CNNs led to improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, as well as better generalization capabilities for unseen data. Despite the promising results, the proposed hybrid approach has some limitations. One limitation is the complexity of integrating handcrafted features and CNNs, which can require extensive tuning to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, the approach still relies on the availability of large, annotated datasets for training, which can be challenging to obtain in the medical
