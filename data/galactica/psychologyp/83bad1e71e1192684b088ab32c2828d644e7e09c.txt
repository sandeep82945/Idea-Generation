An epidermoid carcinoma is a form of non-melanoma skin cancer that originates from the outer layer of the skin’s squamous cells. Previous studies have shown that andrographis extract and andrographolide inhibit the growth and proliferation of epidermoid carcinoma cells while also inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The objective of this study was to improve the anticancer efficacy of the andrographolide-rich extract by delivering it in the form of nanoemulgel. During the formulation of emulgels, sonication, and homogenization were employed, and a 22-factorial design was used to optimize the formulations through the quality by design (QbD) approach. The optimized formulation (AEE8) was subjected to preliminary evaluations along with particle size, drug release, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. The potential of the optimized emulgel against A431 cell lines was also investigated using MTT assay followed by flow cytometric analysis. The SEM results reveal that the optimized emulgel had a well-defined spherical shape, with a droplet size of 226 ± 1.8 nm, a negative surface charge of −30.1 ± 1.6 mV, and a PDI of 0.157. The cellular data indicate that AEE8 reduced the viability of the A431 cells with an IC50 of 16.56 μg/mL, as determined by MTT assay when compared to cells treated with the extract alone. Furthermore, the flow cytometric analysis of the optimized emulgel formulation demonstrated a marked G2/M phase arrest. This finding further supports the effectiveness of the gel in disrupting the cell cycle at the critical G2 and M phases, which are pivotal for cell division and proliferation. This disruption in cell cycle progression can impede the growth and spread of cancer cells, making the gel a promising candidate for antiskin-cancer therapy. The safety of emulgels (AEE8) was validated through rigorous biocompatibility testing conducted on HDF (human dermal fibroblast) cell lines, ensuring their suitability for use. Considering the potential of the nanoemulgel, particularly AEE8, as demonstrated by its favorable properties and its ability to disrupt the cell cycle, it holds great promise as an innovative approach to treating skin cancer. 1. conclusions Currently, there is no phytotherapy available for the topical treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer. To address this gap, an attempt was made to topically administer andrographis extract using a nanoemulgel formulation, representing a novel method for delivering phytoactive therapy to patients with dermal cancer that may provide substantial benefits. The ethanolic fraction of Andrographis paniculata contains terpenoids, primarily andrographolide, which has been shown to exhibit anticancer activity in the current investigation.

The formulated na oemulgel AEE8 greater cytotoxic properties against A431 cell lines compared to the Extract. Additionally, it has shown a significant ability to induce cell cycle arrest, similar to andrographolide. The evaluation of safety and biocompatibility is crucial when considering the potential clinical applications of any new material or formulation. The results obtained from the study indicate that the prepared nanoemulgels, specifically AEE8, demonstrate a high level of safety and biocompatibility. Therefore, the emulgel formulation concept proves to be a valuable approach for enhancing the effectiveness of andrographis extract in topical applications. AEE8 has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of skin cancer. 4. m terials and methods  4.1. materials The leaves of Andrographis paniculata were gathered from the gardens of Tirupathi, authenticated with FRLHT (Bangalore), voucher no. 123919.

were procured from the National Centre for Cell Lines (Pune, India). Carbopol-934 and glycerin were acquired from Loba Chemicals (Mumbai, India. ), and propylene glycol, propylparaben, and methylparaben were obtained from Vasa Chemicals (Bangalore, India). Triethanolamine was received from Merck Chemicals (Mumbai, India), and EDTA and DMSO were acquired from Merck (Berlin, Germany). 4.2. preparation of andrographis paniculata extract The fresh leaves were collected and dried at 40 ◦C followed by pulverization. The resulting powder was subjected to the defatting process using petroleum ether. Following the defatting process, the plant material was subjected to Soxhlet extraction for 24 h using ethanol as the solvent. The obtained extract was placed for the Rota evaporation process, followed by labeling, and stored in the refrigerator followed by the phytochemical screening [25]. 4.3. hplc analysis: determination of andrographolide in the extract The samples were analyzed with an auto-sampler HPLC (Merck, Berlin, Germany) LichroCART, Lichrospher, and C18-C18-5µ column. The mobile phase used was buffer:0.01 N potassium dihydrogen phosphate in water +0.5 mL orthophosphoric acid and acetonitrile, with an injection volume of 1.5 mL/min, with UV detection at 223 nm. The filtration of the samples was conducted using a 0.45 µm syringe filter, where standard 0.5 mg/mL andrographolide in methanol and 5 mg/mL sample extract in methanol were injected. 4.4. in silico studies The process of molecular docking for the bioactive compound was performed using the Schrodinger docking software with automated capabilities. The ligand was imported from the PubChem portal, and the ligprep file was generated using the Maestro tool version 4.2 (Schrödinger, New York, NY, USA); PDB ID: 1SJ9 was retrieved from the rcsb.org portal, and the missing loops and missing amino acid residue were add and minimized. Further glide grids were generated, and finally the ligand was docked [26]. 4.5. compatibility studies To investigate the chemical interactions between the andrographis extract and the excipients in the emulgel formulations, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted. The analysis was carried out using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker-(Alpha), Ettlingen, Germany) via the KBr pellet technique in an inert atmospheric condition covering a wave range of 4000–400 cm−1. The samples analyzed comprised the andrographis extract, drug excipients, such as sesame oil and Carbopol, their physical mixture, and the emulgel formulation [27]. 4.6. preparation of emulgels The modified method of the process was employed for the formulation of emulgels [28]. The selection of the oil is an important parameter for the formation of a stable emulsion. Sesame oil was selected, based on the optimum solubility of the extract, which was the unique aspect of this formulation, instead of using synthetic oils, to reduce potential side effects. Sesame oil is known to be an effective topical protective agent [29] with good penetration capacity along with an anticancerous effect, making it a synergistic addition to the emulgel preparation along with triethanolamine for the release of bioactive agents. The gel base was prepared by combining the required amount of Carbopol-934 (0.5–1.5%) with water and mixing it until a homogenous gel was obtained. Triethanolamine was added to regulate the pH to a range of 5.85–6.35. To prepare the oil phase, span 80 (0.5%) was dissolved in the Sesame oil (3.75%) and the extract was added (0.04–0.12%). For the aqueous phase, Tween 80 (0.25%), propylene glycol (2.5%), glycerin (1.25%), and methylparaben (0.01%) were dispersed in the appropriate amounts of water. The oil and aqueous phases were heated to a temperature of 40–50 ◦C, and the oily phase was added dropwise to the

aqueous phase by stirring until the mixture reached room temperature, ensuring a uniform emulsion. To prepare the emulgel, the gel and emulsion were blended in equal parts using a homogenizer with suitable speed settings. Fixed concentrations for all ingredients were used. The concentrations of extract and Carbopol-934 varied as per the design obtained using Design Expert software (Table 6). 4.7. formulation design using design expert (central composite design) The 22 factorial approach was selected to optimize the formulation factors with the evaluation parameters statistically. A 2-level factorial design with 3 center points was constructed to explore the response surfaces using Design Expert software (Version 13). Extract, A 0.04 (−1, low level) and 0.12 (+1, high level), Carbopol, B 0.5 (−1, low level), and 2.5 (+1, high level) were taken. Factors and responses were provided in Table 7. 4.8. Evaluation Parameters 4.8.1. Physical Examination
The emulgel formulation underwent periodic evaluation to determine quality control parameters, such as color, odor, texture, consistency, stickiness, and phase separation. 4.8.2. pH
Measuring the pH of the emulgel formulation is a crucial step in determining its quality and efficacy. The pH measurement provides important information regarding the acidity, neutrality, or alkalinity of the formulation, which can impact its effectiveness and stability. To determine the pH of the emulgel formulations, a digital pH meter (RPB1000, India) was utilized after calibration at room temperature. A 1% solution of the emulgel formulation was placed into a glass beaker, and the pH was measured by inserting the electrode of the pH meter into the solution. To ensure accuracy, triplicate readings were taken, and the mean and standard deviations were calculated [30]. 4.8.3. Viscosity
Measuring viscosity is a critical step in assessing the emulgel formulations, as it can affect their application and efficacy. The Brookfield digital viscometer is widely used for viscosity measurements because of its accuracy and reliability. The use of Spindle 6 and a
Gels 2023, 9, 507 13 of 16
rotation speed of ten revolutions per minute is a standard method for determining viscosity. Additionally, using a container with a wide aperture allows for the proper insertion of the viscometer spindle into the emulgel sample, which can improve the accuracy of the measurements [31]. 4.8.4. Spreadability
To measure the spreadability of an agent, researchers employed a pulley-equipped wooden block, a pair of mirror-image glass slides, and some standard weights. Five minutes of pressure from a weight of 1000 g were used to evenly distribute the gel throughout the glass slides. The gel formulation was applied to the glass slide at a weight of 1 g, and the slide was then covered with a second glass slide. A lower glass slide was secured to a bracket, while an upper glass slide was suspended freely from a pulley loaded with 20 g weights. The spreadability by timing how long it took the top glass slide to glide downwards under load from a height of 7.50 inches was measured [32]. s = m × l/t (where S, M, L, and T are spreadability, the weight of the pan, distance moved by the glass slide, and time required to separate glass slides from one another, respectively). 4.8.5. Extrudability
The extrudability of emulgels refers to the ability of the product to be extruded from its packaging. It is determined by measuring the force required to extrude a 0.5 cm ribbon of the emulgel from a detachable lacquered aluminum tube within a ten-second time frame. This test is conducted multiple times to obtain accurate readings, and an average is calculated to determine the emulgel’s extrudability [33]. Extrudability = Weight subjected for the extrusion of the gel (g)/Area (cm)
4.8.6. In Vitro Diffusion Studies
Diffusion studies of emulgels typically involve investigating the rate and extent of drug release from emulgels, which are topical formulations consisting of both water and oil phases stabilized by an emulsifier. A drug release study was conducted using a Franz diffusion cell. The experimental emulgels were applied onto a dialysis membrane in a predetermined quantity and placed onto the Franz diffusion cell. To simulate medicament release, 25 mL of buffer (pH 7.4) was injected into the bottom compartment of the cell. The set-up was placed on a magnetic stirrer for continuous stirring at 37 ◦C. Blank readings were taken for comparison, and at regular intervals of 30 min, 1 mL of release media was withdrawn and replaced simultaneously with fresh medium to maintain sink conditions. The experiment was conducted for 8 h, and the collected samples were adequately diluted to measure the absorbance using UV-spectrophotometric analysis at 223 nm (Shimadzu 1900, Mumbai, India) by a standard plot followed by computation of cumulative percentage drug release values [28]. 4.9. Anticancer Studies 4.9.1. Cytotoxic Activity
To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effects of various concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) of andrographis extract emulgel formulations on A-431 cell lines, the MTT assay was utilized. A-431 cells (2 × 104) were seeded into each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate containing 100 µL of DMEM and incubated at 37 ◦C with 5% CO2 for one day. After the cells were treated with the emulgel formulations, 5 mg/mL MTT solution in PBS was added (20 µL) to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 ◦C. Subsequently, the formazan crystals formed were dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO, and the optical densities were measured at 570 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The experiment was repeated three times, and the average readings were recorded. The specific absorbance
Gels 2023, 9, 507 14 of 16
was calculated by subtracting the absorbance of the solvent from the overall absorbance to obtain accurate results [34]. 4.9.2. In Vitro Cell Cycle Assay
In order to quantify the distribution of cells in different phases of the cell cycle, including sub G1, G1, S, and G2/M, a cell cycle assay was performed. A431 cells were plated onto six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After allowing 24 h for adhesion, the cells were treated with IC50 concentrations of andrographolide, extract, and AEE8 for 24 h. Following the treatment, the cells were harvested and fixed. Subsequently, they were rinsed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide and RNase in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the samples were analyzed using flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). 5. in vitro biocompatibility analysis The optimized nanoemulgel, AEE8, containing andrographis extract, underwent cell viability testing using HDF (human dermal fibroblast) cell lines. The cells were cultured in DMEM and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well. After 24 h of incubation in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 ◦C, the emulgel with different concentrations diluted in culture media (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 µg/mL) was added to the wells. Following another 24 h incubation period, the spent media were removed, and the MTT reagent was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After removing the MTT reagent, 100 µL of solubilization solution (DMSO) was added and gently stirred on a gyratory shaker to enhance dissolution. Finally, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a spectrophotometer or an ELISA reader.
