"**FET biosensors are ready to proceed down the path of commercialization if several factors are achieved, such as sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, scalability, low-cost production, and continuous signal monitoring.**" 

"**Thus, during the sensor fabrication process, the defects and grain boundary should be considered in a microscopic regime, and a multi-sensor system study should be conducted at a macroscopic level to surpass these drawbacks.**"

"**(1) A screening procedure for electrode fabrication should be considered to design an FET biosensor for AD biomarker detection. (2) To detect a specific AD biomarker, the selection of the bioreceptor is crucial. (3) A combination of multiple approaches is necessary to achieve optimum performance. (4) The prediction of new circumstances by application of machine learning and deep learning should be conducted.**"
