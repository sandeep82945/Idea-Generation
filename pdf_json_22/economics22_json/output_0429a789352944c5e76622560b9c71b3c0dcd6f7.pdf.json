Methods: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a parallel, stratified individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing prognosis-matched care to usual care at sixand 12-month follow-up. Twenty-three general practices in three Australian Primary Health Networks recruited 1,671 adults (aged 18 \u2013 75 years), predicted by the DST to have minimal/mild or severe depressive or anxiety symptoms in three months. The minimal/mild prognostic group was referred to low intensity services. Participants screened in the severe prognostic group were offered high intensity care navigation, a model of care coordination. The outcome measures included in this evaluation were health sector costs (including development and delivery of the DST, care navigation and other healthcare services used) and societal costs (health sector costs plus lost productivity), psychological distress [Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)] and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EuroQol 5-dimension quality of life questionnaire with Australian general population preference weights applied. Costs were valued in 2018\u201319 Australian dollars (A$). Results: Across all participants, the health sector incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Link-me per point decrease in K10 at six months was estimated at $1,082 (95% CI $391 to $6,204) increasing to $2,371 (95% CI $191 to Dominated) at 12 months. From a societal perspective, the ICER was estimated at $1,257/K10 point decrease (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at six months, decreasing to $1,217 (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at 12 months. No significant differences in QALYs were detected between trial arms and the intervention was dominated (less effective, more costly) based on the cost/QALY ICER. Conclusions: The Link-me approach to stepped mental health care would not be considered cost-effective utilising a cost/QALY outcome metric commonly adopted by health technology assessment agencies. Rather, Link-me showed \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Primary Care (2022) 23:236 Background In Australia, common mental health problems are initially diagnosed and treated by general practitioners (GPs) [1]; however, underand over-treatment is common. Australian mental health reforms have promoted stepped care to improve the efficiency and quality of mental health care. Evidence suggests that stepped care can be effective for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders [2, 3]; few studies have explored the value for money credentials of stepped care approaches for the treatment of anxiety and depression in primary care settings [3]. The Link-me approach to stepped care comprises a patient-completed digital Decision Support Tool (DST) to predict the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in three months\u2019 time, support individuals to identify their mental health treatment priorities, and deliver prognosis-based treatment recommendations. In a pragmatic, stratified randomised controlled trial (RCT), the Link-me intervention resulted in greater reductions in psychological distress at six months over usual care[4]. This paper reports on the economic evaluation incorporated in the RCT [5]. Methods The Link-me RCT was conducted within 23 general practices in three Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland) across metropolitan, outer metropolitan and regional locations in collaboration with three Primary Health Networks (PHNs). PHNs are not-for-profit companies commissioning health services in 31 geographically defined areas throughout Australia [6]. The study protocol and analysis plan for clinical and economic outcomes are described in full elsewhere [4, 5]. Briefly, adults attending a participating general practice for any reason were invited to complete an eligibility screening tool and the DST (Supporting Information, section S1) on a tablet device in the waiting room. Eligible patients (ages 18\u201375  years; proficient in English; providing a phone number and email address; having a Medicare card; reporting current anxiety or depression symptoms or use of medication for mental health) were classified into three prognostic groups. Participants categorised into the minimal/mild and severe groups were individually randomised to the intervention or control group. Participants classified as minimal/mild and allocated to the intervention group were offered a selection of low intensity treatment options available through local in-person services, online, by telephone or mobile app. The recommended options were viewed on the tablet immediately after completing the DST and a copy was emailed to participants including links to the relevant services. The severe prognostic group allocated to the intervention were offered care navigation, a model of clinical care coordination informed by the principles of collaborative care and motivational interviewing. Participants could receive up to eight contacts with a trained care navigator to develop and implement a structured care plan to address priorities they identified in the DST. Participants could also access additional care package funding, through the participating PHNs, to support service access when cost was a barrier to care. Participants randomised to the control group for both minimal/mild and severe prognostic groups received advice to discuss any mental health concerns with their GP. The moderate group were excluded from the study based on the availability of mental health service offerings appropriate to this level of need [7]. Costs A health sector perspective was adopted as the primary perspective for the economic evaluation with a secondary analysis from a partial societal perspective. Health sector costs included the costs of implementing the Link-me intervention and of other health services used by participants during the trial. Partial societal costs included all health sector costs plus the cost of selfreported productivity losses (Supporting Information, Table S1). A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of the Link-me intervention and included the resources required for screening, the delivery of care navigation and care packages (Supporting Information, Table S2). Although the control group was screened as part of the study, screening costs were not assigned to this group as screening is not reflective of usual care. Information on health service use was captured through a self-report resource use questionnaire (RUQ) completed by all participants at six and 12-month followups. The RUQ incorporated questions about the number a trend toward cost-effectiveness by providing improvement in mental health symptoms, measured by the K10, at an additional cost.

Twenty-three general practices in three Australian Primary Health Networks recruited 1,671 adults (aged 18 \u2013 75 years), predicted by the DST to have minimal/mild or severe depressive or anxiety symptoms in three months. The minimal/mild prognostic group was referred to low intensity services. Participants screened in the severe prognostic group were offered high intensity care navigation, a model of care coordination. The outcome measures included in this evaluation were health sector costs (including development and delivery of the DST, care navigation and other healthcare services used) and societal costs (health sector costs plus lost productivity), psychological distress [Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)] and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EuroQol 5-dimension quality of life questionnaire with Australian general population preference weights applied. Costs were valued in 2018\u201319 Australian dollars (A$).\nResults: Across all participants, the health sector incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Link-me per point decrease in K10 at six months was estimated at $1,082 (95% CI $391 to $6,204) increasing to $2,371 (95% CI $191 to Dominated) at 12 months. From a societal perspective, the ICER was estimated at $1,257/K10 point decrease (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at six months, decreasing to $1,217 (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at 12 months. No significant differences in QALYs were detected between trial arms and the intervention was dominated (less effective, more costly) based on the cost/QALY ICER.\nConclusions: The Link-me approach to stepped mental health care would not be considered cost-effective utilising a cost/QALY outcome metric commonly adopted by health technology assessment agencies.

            "text": "In Australia, common mental health problems are initially diagnosed and treated by general practitioners (GPs) [1]; however, under- and over-treatment is common. Australian mental health reforms have promoted stepped care to improve the efficiency and quality of mental health care. Evidence suggests that stepped care can be effective for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders [2, 3]; few studies have explored the value for money credentials of stepped care approaches for the treatment of anxiety and depression in primary care settings [3].\nThe Link-me approach to stepped care comprises a patient-completed digital Decision Support Tool (DST) to predict the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms in three months\u2019 time, support individuals to identify their mental health treatment priorities, and deliver prognosis-based treatment recommendations.\nIn a pragmatic, stratified randomised controlled trial (RCT), the Link-me intervention resulted in greater reductions in psychological distress at six months over usual care[4]. This paper reports on the economic evaluation incorporated in the RCT [5]."

            "text": "The Link-me RCT was conducted within 23 general practices in three Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland) across metropolitan, outer metropolitan and regional locations in collaboration with three Primary Health Networks (PHNs). PHNs are not-for-profit companies commissioning health services in 31 geographically defined areas throughout Australia [6]. The study protocol and analysis plan for clinical and economic outcomes are described in full elsewhere [4, 5].\nBriefly, adults attending a participating general practice for any reason were invited to complete an eligibility screening tool and the DST (Supporting Information, section S1) on a tablet device in the waiting room. Eligible patients (ages 18\u201375\u00a0 years; proficient in English; providing a phone number and email address; having a Medicare card; reporting current anxiety or depression symptoms or use of medication for mental health) were classified into three prognostic groups. Participants categorised into the minimal/mild and severe groups were individually randomised to the intervention or control\ngroup. Participants classified as minimal/mild and allocated to the intervention group were offered a selection of low intensity treatment options available through local in-person services, online, by telephone or mobile app. The recommended options were viewed on the tablet immediately after completing the DST and a copy was emailed to participants including links to the relevant services. The severe prognostic group allocated to the intervention were offered care navigation, a model of clinical care coordination informed by the principles of collaborative care and motivational interviewing. Participants could receive up to eight contacts with a trained care navigator to develop and implement a structured care plan to address priorities they identified in the DST. Participants could also access additional care package funding, through the participating PHNs, to support service access when cost was a barrier to care. Participants randomised to the control group for both minimal/mild and severe prognostic groups received advice to discuss any mental health concerns with their GP. The moderate group were excluded from the study based on the availability of mental health service offerings appropriate to this level of need [7]."

Health sector costs included the costs of implementing the Link-me intervention and of other health services used by participants during the trial. Partial societal costs included all health sector costs plus the cost of selfreported productivity losses (Supporting Information, Table S1).\nA micro-costing approach was used to estimate the cost of the Link-me intervention and included the resources required for screening, the delivery of care navigation and care packages (Supporting Information, Table S2). Although the control group was screened as part of the study, screening costs were not assigned to this group as screening is not reflective of usual care.\nInformation on health service use was captured through a self-report resource use questionnaire (RUQ) completed by all participants at six and 12-month followups. The RUQ incorporated questions about the number\na trend toward cost-effectiveness by providing improvement in mental health symptoms, measured by the K10, at an additional cost.\nTrial registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTRN 12617001333303.

Standard Australian unit costs were applied (Supporting Information, section S3). Participants were also asked for consent for the study team to access their Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data.

            "text": "Self-report outcome measures were administered at baseline, six-month and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome measure was the Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) scale [8] at the six-month follow-up. The K10 was used as an outcome measure in economic analyses. Since lower K10 scores indicate less psychological distress (and a negative change score therefore represents a positive outcome), change in K10 was multiplied by -1 to aid interpretation. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item version (PHQ-9) [9], Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) [10] and EuroQol 5-dimension quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) [11] were secondary self-report outcome measures. The EQ-5D-5L was used to measure participants\u2019 preference-based health-related quality of life, and Australian general population preference weights were applied to calculate utility values at each time point [12]. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EQ-5D-5L utility values using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method [13]. QALYs are the preferred outcome metric in Australia, used by health technology assessment agencies such as the Medical Services Advisory Committee, due to their inherent value for money connotations. An implicit threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained has been used for an intervention to be considered cost-effective, and $28,033 per QALY gained is an additional threshold based on contemporary empirical results [14, 15]."

All enrolled participants who completed a baseline assessment were included; however, 63% of participants were missing cost data and 60% were missing QALYs over 12-month follow-up. To address this, missing cost and outcome data were generated using\n50 imputed datasets. Imputed values were estimated using variables for randomisation group, age, gender, baseline K10, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and stratified by prognostic group.\nThe mean difference in costs from both health sector and societal perspectives were estimated using generalised linear models (GLM) with the gamma family and log link. The mean difference between the intervention and control groups in the change in K10 scores from baseline to six and 12-month follow-ups were estimated using multiple linear regression. The difference in mean QALYs between trial arms was estimated using a GLM with the Gaussian family and identity link. All regression and GLM models were estimated with and without adjustment for several baseline covariates specified a priori (prognostic group and baseline K10 score) [5, 16]. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted across prognostic groups.\nIncremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the difference in mean costs between the intervention and control groups divided by the difference in mean outcome (change in K10 score, QALYs) by study perspective (health sector and societal). A nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 iterations from the multiple imputed data was undertaken to estimate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) around each ICER. The resulting iterations were also used to construct cost-effectiveness planes.\nA series of sensitivity analyses explored the effects of: analysing complete cases only, including general practice as a covariate, varying the cost of care navigation sessions to account for efficiencies that may be achieved over time; applying the United Kingdom value set for the EQ5D-5L [17], and using individual level MBS/PBS data to estimate resource use."

Our results suggest that Link-me was associated with additional health sector and societal costs but resulted in achieving additional improvement in mental health symptoms. Incremental costs were highest for the severe prognostic group which also achieved the largest\nincremental improvement in mental health symptom scores.\nGiven the time-limited nature of the trial, reported costs may be considered the upper estimate of the true costs associated with delivering care navigation (i.e., training and development) and would likely reduce over time once the intervention became established. The Link\u2010 me intervention was most likely not running at full economic efficiency because the rollout of the actual process of care navigation was being fine\u2010tuned with the cost of likely learning effects being incurred. If the learning effects were finalised and Link\u2010me was running at steady state, the throughput of participants would be increased, leading to reductions in average cost per person and contact.\nLink-me is a novel approach; therefore, published evaluations of directly comparable interventions are lacking. An economic evaluation of the precursor digital platform to Link-me used to manage the treatment of people with depression found it to be dominant (more effective\nFig. 1 Cost-effectiveness planes for health sector cost per point improvement in K10 score at six and 12 months. a Six months all participants (n = 1671). b Six months mild/moderate (n = 830). c Six months severe (n = 841). d 12 months all participants (n = 1671). e 12 months mild/ moderate (n = 830). f 12 months severe (n = 841). Notes: Each cost-effectiveness plane is comprised of 1000 incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (the difference in mean health sector costs divided by the difference in mean K10 scores) between the intervention and control groups estimated through the non-parametric bootstrapping of the multiple imputed data. The percentage of the 1000 cost-effectiveness ratios falling in each quadrant is reported. The upper right-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has both higher incremental costs and benefits (improvement in K10 score) compared to the control group. The upper left-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has higher incremental costs and lower incremental benefits compared to the control group, also referred to as dominated. The lower right-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has lower incremental costs and higher incremental benefits, referred to as dominant. The lower left-hand quadrant of the planes is where Link-me has both lower incremental costs and benefits compared to the control group\nand less costly) over usual care from both health sector and societal perspectives [18]. It utilised the Assessment of Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D) questionnaire [19] to measure utility values and calculate QALYs in contrast to the current evaluation using the EQ-5D-5L. Despite improvements in mental health symptom scores measured with the K10 in the current evaluation, no significant differences were found between groups on the EQ-5D-5L utility scores or QALYs. Economic analyses of collaborative care interventions for treating depression in primary care found mixed results for cost-utility analyses [20, 21]. Studies using the Short Form quality of life measure detected significant differences in QALYs, while those using the EQ-5D found negative or non-significant incremental QALYs [20]. This may reflect lower sensitivity of the EQ-5D to changes in quality of life resulting from improvement in mental health symptoms, despite previous studies indicating that most multi-attribute utility instruments can discriminate between differing levels of symptom severity for people with depression [22]. Link-me provided statistically significant improvement in K10 scores over existing care at six-month follow up, however the mean difference did not reach the prespecified minimal clinically relevant difference of 2.4 points (equivalent to a standardised mean difference of -0.3). However, half of the participants allocated to the Linkme intervention did not accept the offer to engage in care navigation. When a complier average causal effect analysis was undertaken to assess the magnitude of change in K10 scores associated with engagement in the different steps of care navigation, the intervention effect size increased and led to clinically meaningful differences [4]. This suggests that there is an opportunity to optimise the Link-me intervention to improve engagement potentially leading to improved clinical outcomes. Average health sector and societal costs across all participants for both the Link-me and control groups were higher than reported in previous economic evaluations of stepped and collaborative care interventions for people with depression [3, 20, 21]. The addition of anxiety symptoms to the prognostic model of the DST may have contributed to this result. Previous research found\nFig. 2 Cost-effectiveness planes for societal cost per point improvement in K10 score at 12 months. a Six months all participants (n = 1671). b Six months mild/moderate (n = 830). c Six months severe (n = 841). d 12 months all participants (n = 1671). e 12 months mild/moderate (n = 830). f 12 months severe (n = 841). Notes: Each cost-effectiveness plane is comprised of 1000 incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (the difference in mean societal costs divided by the difference in mean K10 scores) between the intervention and control group estimated through the non-parametric bootstrapping of the multiple imputed data. The upper right-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has both higher incremental costs and benefits (improvement in K10 score) compared to the control group. The upper left-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has higher incremental costs and lower incremental benefits compared to the control group, also referred to as dominated. The lower right-hand quadrant of the plane is where Link-me has lower incremental costs and higher incremental benefits, referred to as dominant. The lower left-hand quadrant of the planes is where Link-me has both lower incremental costs and benefits compared to the control group\nthat health sector and productivity costs for comorbid depression and anxiety were significantly higher than either diagnosis alone [23]. Another explanation is that there was increased time missed from work since study participants in both randomised groups were seeking additional treatment for their mental health concerns.\nThe Link-me intervention was hypothesised to be costeffective through triaging participants in the minimal/ mild prognostic group to low intensity services associated with lower costs and offsetting the increased costs of care in the severe prognostic group. However, participants in the minimal/mild prognostic group who were offered low intensity services had a significantly higher average mean health sector cost at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up than their usual care counterparts, in part due to their greater use of psychology services. This may be due to the pragmatic nature of this real-world trial since we could not limit access to more intensive forms of care. Participants in the Link-me group utilised psychological services at a similar rate to the comparison group among the minimal/ mild prognostic group (25% intervention; 19% comparison). The feedback and opportunity for reflection provided by the Link-me DST may have prompted increased help-seeking through psychologists, in preference to the suggested low-intensity options, partially accounting for the higher costs observed."

            "text": "The relatively large sample size and embedding of this economic evaluation in a pragmatic RCT engenders confidence in the results. The number and diversity of general practices recruiting study participants suggests that the results are generalisable to similar Australian practices.\nThis study is also subject to limitations. The use of a self-report measure of health care utilisation and lost productivity are subject to recall bias. However, this would affect both groups in the trial, and previous studies have demonstrated the validity of self-reported RUQs [24]. The sensitivity analyses conducted using accurate administrative data (MBS/PBS) produced results which differed from the primary analyses: namely smaller, non-significant mean differences in health sector costs between the Link-me and control groups. It is important to note that an additional consent was required to access participants\u2019 MBS/PBS data, and only 28% of participants provided this consent, thus limiting the usefulness of this sensitivity analysis.\nThere was also a high volume of missing data (63.2% control group, 56% Link-me at 12-month follow-up) which may affect the validity of the results. Efforts were made in the design and conduct of the trial to minimise the loss of data, and the analytic approach followed\npublished recommendations for managing missing data [25, 26]. The additional sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of imputed missing data did not alter the interpretation of the findings. However, it is unclear if the results would change if all participants completed every follow-up assessment."

            "text": "The Link-me approach to stepped mental health care would not be considered cost-effective utilising the cost/QALY outcome metric commonly used by health technology assessment agencies. Link-me could be viewed as trending toward cost-effectiveness by providing improvement in mental health symptoms, assessed by the K10, for additional cost. Given the Productivity Commission\u2019s recommendation for a national digital mental health platform to support a person-centred approach to mental health care in Australia [27],\u00a0Linkme should be appraised for this important function."
