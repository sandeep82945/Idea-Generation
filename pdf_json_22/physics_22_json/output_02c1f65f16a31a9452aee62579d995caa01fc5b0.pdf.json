INTRODUCTION\nIn contrast to conventional LIDAR, ghost imaging radar is a type of gaze imaging radar based on photon rise and fall properties, which has advantages such as high detection sensitivity, super-resolution and interference resistance [1-5]. However, the relative motion between the radar system and the target will lead to poor correlation between the reference arm speckle and the bucket detection observations, and poor or even unimaginable imaging quality. Common solutions include fast sampling with increased frame rate and scatter motion compensation schemes [6], the former of which is very demanding in terms of hardware requirements and therefore more research has been conducted based on the latter.\nResearch on correlated imaging and localisation of moving targets has focused on the tangential motion of the target relative to the system. The research process is generally based on the assumption of quasi-static estimation [7], i.e. the tangential motion process is studied in segments, where the target can be considered as stationary and within the field of view with respect to the imaging system during each segment. In [8-9], researchers obtained motion pattern estimates based on a motion state search conditioned on the optimal quality of the correlated reconstructed images, which required repeated image reconstruction to determine the correct motion parameters. In [10-12], some scholars used the method of solving the maximum value of the correlation function of two rough correlated images to obtain relative position pose estimates of the target, which could not recover the tracking of the target in case of transient recovery of tracking in case of loss. Reference [13] divided the scatter into different sub-scatters based on the variation of object arm barrel detection sampling data and the motion of the target throughout the illumination pattern, and determined the target position by finding the corresponding overlap between the target barrel detection value and some parts of\nthe scatter. Reference [14] used the barrel detector intensity rise and fall signal associated with object spatial information for blood cell counting, applying motion target ghost imaging to the biomedical field to achieve high throughput blood cell classification and counting. The literature [15] combines laser tracking with conventional four-quadrant detectors, replacing the barrel detector with a four-quadrant detector to achieve real-time localization of the Specklewhile correlating the four-quadrant light intensity summation with the reference arm scattering to obtain the target image, but the method cannot give a position estimate for small targets that lie entirely in one quadrant. Other papers [16-17] use structured light to illuminate the target area, exploit the natural optical convolution properties, and use barrel detection reception to detect and identify the relative offset of the target, but the nature of the imaging is not the same as random scatter-based correlation imaging.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for moving target localization and imaging of ghost imaging radar based on correlation intensity weighting, in which the target coordinate position is obtained by intensity weighting of individual pixel coordinates based on one undersampled rough image of the target in a simple background, and the speckles panned to reconstruct the target at the same position in the field of view by combining the obtained target position, and a high-quality target image is obtained by superimposing the reconstructed multiple rough images. This method is computationally simple and gives a high quality image of the target. It can obtain the absolute coordinates of the target under the detection field of view, avoid the disadvantage that the relative position offset detection cannot be retraced, and can achieve better localization and correlation imaging for a single target in the field of view.\nII.

According to (1), the intensity of each pixel (x,y) in the imaged space can be considered as the cumulative average of K correlation operations, and the intensity of the target region in the reconstructed rough image is significantly stronger than that of the non-target region. In other words, the scatter of the reference arm at the target region is associated with the barrel detection value with a significant correlation strength, while the non-target region has a weak correlation calculation, and the stronger the correlation strength the greater the probability that it will become a pixel in the target region. The intensity feature of a rough image is the target feature. In this paper, the coordinates of regions with strong association strength values are extracted and weighted normalized to their coordinates to obtain an estimate of the absolute coordinates of the target.\nBefore estimating the target centre coordinates, a pixel correlation intensity filter is required.

Using a rough image that requires only a small number of samples for moving target localisation, the effective information of the target area is gradually accumulated as the moving target moves, and a clear image is eventually obtained.\nIII. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed correlation intensity weighted localisation and imaging method, simulations of its localisation and imaging are carried out. The effect of the screening threshold t and the number of samples K of the generated rough image on the localisation and imaging is analysed in this paper. The simulation process of target motion follows the trajectory of the target-fitted trigonometric curve, with a reference arm speckle and reconstructed image field-of-view size of 64x64 pixels and a target size of 15x15 pixels, and a 2x2 pixels Bernoulli speckle used for the reference arm spot. The target moves once per K samples in the field of view. In this paper, the positioning accuracy and imaging quality are evaluated\nusing the position root-mean-square error (PRMSE) and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).\n \n r\nj jcjc\no jc yyxx\nr PRMSE\n1\n22 )()( 1 o\njc (7)\n2\n1 1 ),(),( 1     m x n y originalGInew yxOyxO mn MSE (8)\n)lg(20 max MSE\nO PSNR GInew (9)\nwhere, o jcx and o jcy are the original target centre position,\njcx and jcy are the calculated target centre position,\n),( yxOoriginal is the original target image, ),( yxOGInew is the\nreconstructed image, and MSE is the image signal-to-noise ratio.\nAt first, this paper simulates and analyzes the screening threshold, given the number of samples K=300, and takes the mean square error of target localization under different screening thresholds, and plots the relationship between the screening threshold t and localization accuracy in Fig.2 When larger the number of samples of strongly correlated points obtained by screening becomes smaller, the influence of a few mutated strongly correlated points becomes larger, and the centre of localisation deviates from the original target centre instead; when smaller more background noise points are selected as localisation weights, making the localisation error large.\nIn this paper, we also investigate the influence of the number of undersampling K on the localization of the generated rough image, and select the screening threshold t=0.7. The relationship between the number of samples and the positioning accuracy is plotted in Fig.3. As the number of samples increases, the positioning accuracy improves significantly, but too high a number of samples makes the time interval between each target positioning larger and the probability of the target flying out of the field of view increases, which is not conducive to tracking.\nThe target image reconstruction effect is shown in Figure 4 and the target trajectory is shown in Figure 5 for the case of setting K=300 and t=0.7. Fig.4a shows the original target image, Fig.4b shows the ghost image without speckle shift compensation, Fig.4c shows the rough image and Fig.4d shows the final superimposed high quality image. The PSNR of the final high quality image is 21.25 dB and the PSNR of\nthe rough image is 15.07 dB. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the target image obtained by the superimposed method is significantly improved.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper proposes a method to obtain the absolute position of a single target in the field of view by weighting the correlation intensity of a single frame of rough image, compensating the reference arm speckle translation according to the localization and tracking trajectory, and finally accumulating the rough image into a high quality image. This method is simple to calculate and can obtain the absolute coordinates of the target under the detection field of view, avoiding the disadvantage that the relative position detection cannot be retraced, and can achieve a good localization and ghost imaging of the moving single target in the field of view."
