Expansion to Other Heavy Metals and Contaminants: Investigate the use of SPE/NPC for the detection of other harmful heavy metals (e.g., mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr)) and organic contaminants (e.g., pesticides, hormones) in various food products, beyond just milk powder. This could help in creating a comprehensive monitoring system for food safety.

Improvement of Sensitivity and Selectivity: Develop and test new modifications of the NPC or the addition of other functional materials to the SPE to further improve the sensitivity and selectivity towards specific HMIs. This might involve the use of other nanomaterials, molecular imprinted polymers, or bio-receptors that have high affinity for particular heavy metals.

Portable and Integrated Detection Systems: Design and prototype a fully integrated portable device that incorporates the SPE/NPC sensor, a miniaturized electrochemical analyzer, and digital readout or smartphone integration for on-the-spot analysis. This device would be invaluable for field testing by non-specialists, providing immediate results without the need for laboratory facilities.

Long-Term Stability and Reusability Studies: Conduct long-term studies to assess the stability and reusability of the SPE/NPC sensors over extended periods and after multiple uses. This research could lead to the development of more durable sensors and would include the investigation of cleaning and regeneration protocols for repeated use.

In Vivo Monitoring and Health Impact Studies: Explore the potential for adapting the SPE/NPC technology for in vivo monitoring of HMIs in biological fluids (e.g., blood, urine) to study the bioaccumulation of metals in living organisms over time. This could provide valuable data on the exposure and health impacts of HMIs in humans, especially in infants and children who are more vulnerable to these contaminants.
