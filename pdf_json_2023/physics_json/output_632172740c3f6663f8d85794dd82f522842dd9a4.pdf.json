    "abstractText": "Geopropolis has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. In this study, the botanical origin, physicochemical profile, and biological activities of geopropolis from Melipona scutellaris harvested during rainy and dry seasons were investigated. Palynological analysis identified over 50 pollen types, with Schinus terebinthifolius and Cecropia being the predominant types. The analytical results were in line with those reported in the literature. Rainy-season geopropolis exhibited higher total phenol and flavonoid content (determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography\u201425.13% and 3.92%, respectively) compared to the dry season (19.30% and 2.09%); the major peaks (naringin, gallic acid, and catechin) were similar among samples. Antioxidant capacity was assessed via DPPH, reducing power, and \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid discoloration assays. Rainy-season samples displayed superior antioxidant activity across methods. Antimicrobial effects were determined using microdilution, while the impact on the cholinesterase enzyme was quantified using 5-thio2-nitrobenzoic acid accumulation. Anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic activities were assessed through hyaluronidase enzyme inhibition and by utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC-20113 cells. Both samples exhibited anti-inflammatory and antimutagenic properties. Moreover, a significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase was observed, with IC50 values of 0.35 \u03bcg/mL during the rainy season and 0.28 \u03bcg/mL during the dry season. Additionally, the geopropolis displayed antimicrobial activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of M. scutellaris geopropolis in the context of inflammatory, oxidative, and infectious diseases.",

            "text": "In Brazil, geopropolis has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries, being used to treat a variety of ailments including respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. Propolis and geopropolis are both resins collected by bees for hive construction and protection. While they share similarities, they are distinct in composition. Propolis, produced by honeybees from the Apis family, is a mixture of tree resins, wax, enzymes, salivary secretions, and other organic ingredients. On the other hand, geopropolis is created by stingless bees of the Melipona family, which mix propolis with clay or soil. As a result, geopropolis has a powdery texture, an earthy aroma, and a higher mineral content [1]. The chemical composition of propolis and geopropolis is highly complex and influenced by various factors, including geographic origin, the available plant sources for the bees, bee species,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 2779. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11112779 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nand soil type [1,2]. Brazil, being a megadiverse country with multiple geomorphological and climatic conditions, harbors more than 200 species, with around 20% of them being endemic [3]. According to Turco et al. [4], different Meliponinis species exhibit selective foraging behaviors, with M. quadrifasciata collecting resins from a wider range of plants and Tetragonisca angustula being more specific in their choice of vegetal sources. These variables contribute to the existence of numerous types of geopropolis and propolis, each with a chemical composition that is both qualitatively and quantitatively unique [4\u20136]. These substances typically contain phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, hydrolysable tannins, triterpenes, saponins, alkaloids, lipids, and other compounds [1,2,4,6\u20138], which are associated with biological activities such as antioxidant [6\u20139], anti-inflammatory [6,9], antimicrobial [6,9] and anticancer [6,10] activities. Geopropolis is undoubtedly a great source of molecules with different biological properties, being used in traditional medicine of different peoples, and there are possibilities for new discoveries, with the search for phenolic compounds being the most promising [11]. Despite the correlation between bioactive compounds and their plant sources, there is a lack of information regarding the specific plants used by bees for geopropolis production in Brazil. Furthermore, there has been no study on the effect of the season on the quality and bioactivity of geopropolis. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of climatic conditions on the pollen profile, physicochemical characteristics, phenolic profile, biological activities, and mutagenic activity."

Geopropolis was collected at different times of the year, as these temporal variations can exert an influence on its attributes, thereby impacting the therapeutic qualities of geopropolis. The chemical compounds of geopropolis depend on the plant sources, geographical zone, season, and bee species. As the amount of geopropolis produced by stingless bees is very small, for the realization of the work, two composite samples\u2014one consisting of the samples from the dry season and the other from the rainy season\u2014were made. The samples were obtained from the meliponary of Fazenda S\u00e3o Lucas (12\u25e601\u2032786\u2032\u2032 S and 38\u25e604\u2032366\u2032\u2032 W), located in a region with predominance of secondary Atlantic Forest, in the municipality of Entre Rios. This municipality is located on the BR-110 highway between Salvador and Alagoinhas in the state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil. The state of Bahia has about 564,733.081 km2, with 417 municipalities, occupying approximately 36.4% of the Northeast region [12]."

The determination of moisture was ascertained using the standard method (AOAC Official Method 934.01). Five grams of geopropolis were dried in a mechanical convection oven at 105\u25e6 for 1 h. After this time, it was removed and let to cool at room temperature and weight back. The water content was determined using an equation in which A1 = weigh of sample and A2 = weigh of sample dried: Moisture (%) = 100 \u00d7 (A1 \u2212 A2)/A1. The pH of geopropolis was measured with a combined pH glass electrode connected to pH-meter Basic 20 in a solution prepared with 10 g of geopropolis in 75 mL of methanol (NP 1309/1976), using methanol as control. Calibration was performed with three standard buffer solutions. Electrical conductivity of a geopropolis solution at 20% (w/v) (dry matter basis) in methanol was measured at 20 \u25e6C in a Crison 522 conductimeter. Results were expressed in milliSiemens per centimeter (mS/cm). The method used in the experiments to determine the mineral content and other inorganic matter in geopropolis consisted of the desiccation of an amount of 5 g, for each geopropolis sample, in a platinum dish (AOAC Official Method 920.181). To do so, they were kept in the thermostat at 80 \u25e6C for 4 h, after which the samples underwent calcination at 550 \u25e6C in an electric laboratory furnace, SNOL 8.2/1100-1 (AB \u201cUmega\u201d, Utena, Lithuania), to constant mass. Total ash content, expressed as the percentage of residue left after dry oxidation by weight (%), was calculated from the following equation, where m1 is the mass of dish and ash, m2 is the mass of platinum dish prior to calcination, and m0 is the mass of the propolis taken: Ash (%) = (m1 \u2212m2/m0) \u00d7 100.

Indeed, individual antioxidant compounds do not necessarily reflect the total antioxidant capacity of the product, as there may be synergistic or antagonistic interactions between the different compounds present. The methods often used to determine in vitro antioxidant capacity can be broadly divided into two categories: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction-based assays and electron transfer (ET) reaction-based assays. In our study we used three methodologies to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of geopropolis extracts, two based on TE (DPPH radical scavenging activity assay and reducing power) and one based on HAT (\u03b2-carotene decolorization inhibition assay) [17,19].\n(a) Scavenging of DPPH radicals\nIn the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity (RSA) assays, the methodology described by Moreira et al. [20] was followed. An aliquot of 0.3 mL of geopropolis extract (concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 175 \u00b5g/mL) was mixed with 2.7 mL of DPPH reagent (2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 M). The mixture was left to stand in the dark for 60 min. After this time, the absorbance of the solutions, read at 517 nm using ascorbic acid, was used as the standard to establish the calibration curve. The IC50 was calculated as the percentage of decolorization of the DPPH solution, according to the following equation:\n% IC50 = [(Abs517 \u2212 A517 S)/Abs517 DPPH] \u00d7 100\nHere, Abs517 S-corresponds to the absorbance of the DPPH solution in the presence of different concentrations of extract and Abs517 DPPH to the absorbance of the blank (DPPH solution plus extraction solvent instead of extract solution).\n(b) Reducing power\nThis methodology was based on the protocol reported by Moreira et al. [20] (slightly modified). A volume of 0.25 mL (1 mg/mL) of the sample extract was mixed with 1.25 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 1.25 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide. The mixture was placed in a bain Marie at 50 \u25e6C for 20 min. Then, after 1.25 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to this solution, it was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, from the supernatant, 1.25 mL was removed and added to 1.25 mL of deionised water and 0.25 mL of 0.1% FeCl3. The absorbance was read at 700 nm and the results were noted. The concentration of extract that induced a 50% inhibition percentage (EC50) was calculated\nfrom the plot of absorbance (700 nm) as a function of extract concentration in the solution. BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole) was used as a control.\n(c) Discoloration of \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid\nThis assay was performed according to the method described by Ahn et al. [21] with some modifications. Before starting the test, the chloroform solution of \u03b2-carotene was prepared (1 mg of \u03b2-carotene dissolved in 5 mL of chloroform). Then, 1 mL of this solution was mixed with 20 mg of linoleic acid and 200 mg of Tween 40. After extracting the chloroform using a rotary evaporator at 40 \u25e6C, 50 mL of oxygenated distilled water was slowly added to the mixture and the flask was shaken vigorously to form an emulsion. For this test, 250 \u00b5L of the emulsion was added to 30 \u00b5L of the geopropolis extract in a microplate. Absorbance measurements were taken at 492 nm immediately after adding the emulsion to the extract, as well as again after 120 min. The microplate was placed on a shaker at 50 \u25e6C. As a control, 30 \u00b5L of the solvent (80% ethanol) was incubated with 250 \u00b5L of the emulsion. Independent experiments were carried out in triplicate.\nThe inhibition of \u03b2-carotene decolorization was calculated using the following equation:\n% Discoloration = [(Abs470 after 2 h/Abs470 initial) \u00d7 100]"

Antioxidant Capacity\nRegarding antioxidant capacity, the observed values ranged from IC50 = 0.058 mg/mL (DPPH) to 89.52% (\u03b2-carotene). It should be noted that the higher the CI values50 were, the lower the antioxidant capacity was. The geopropolis collected in the rainy season showed a higher antioxidant capacity than the samples obtained in the dry season. The antioxidant capacity assessed using both the DPPH and reducing power methods was approximately three and a half times lower than that obtained for the standard (ascorbic acid). There were significant differences in antioxidant capacity between the samples when analyzed using the different methods, apart from DPPH. For both samples, the method used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity overall significantly influenced the results obtained.\n3.4.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity\nThe inhibition of hyaluronidase enzyme activity allows the indirect assessment of the effect of geopropolis extracts on anti-inflammatory activity. It was found that the anti-inflammatory activity induced by geopropolis collected in the dry season was lower (26.62 \u00b1 0.90%), with significant differences observed compared to that of the rainy season (30.95 \u00b1 1.28%).\n3.4.3. Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase\nThe link between acetylcholinesterase and Alzheimer\u2019s disease results from decreased levels of acetylcholine in the brain. In this study, we tested the effect of geopropolis extracts on this enzyme. The concentrations of extract required to cause a 50% inhibition of the activity of this enzyme were found to be 0.281 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.3542 \u00b1 0.0006 \u00b5g/mL for wet and dry season geopropolis, respectively, with statistically significant differences between the effects induced by the two samples. Compared to the geopropolis extract, eserine (control) had a more pronounced effect on the inhibition of this enzyme.\n3.4.4. Antimicrobial Activity\nFrom the analysis in Table 4, it was found that all the extracts of the samples analyzed showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts (Table 4). Overall, Staphylococcus aureus ESA 321, a clinical isolate from pus (MIC = 0.05 \u00b1 0.02 and MIC = 0.12 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL for the rainy and dry seasons, respectively), was the most sensitive microorganism to the action of both samples under study, and Candida albicans ESA115, isolated from a sputum (MIC = 2.5 \u00b1 0.11 and MIC = 5.00 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL for the rainy and dry seasons, respectively), was the most resistant. For Proteus mirabilis, MIC values were between 0.7 and 1.0 mg/mL [29].\nRegarding the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), the following values were obtained for S. aureus: rainy season\u20142.25 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL and 1.75 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL for the dry season. The values observed for this parameter in C. albicans were 5.20 \u00b1 0.02 mg/mL and 5.00 \u00b1 0.04 mg/mL for the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Overall, the inhibition induced on the various microorganisms under study by the samples collected in the rainy season was higher than that induced by the samples obtained in the dry season. The difference in the efficiency of propolis on the control of Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria may be due to the difference in the structure of the cell wall, wherein the Gram-negative ones are more complex, preventing the action of compounds with an antimicrobial effect. Note that this behavior was observed in both samples tested [11].\n3.4.5. Antimutagenic Activity\nTable 5 shows the results obtained for the antimutagenic activity induced by geopropolis extracts. All samples were found to have anti-genotoxic action, with values ranging from 23.01 \u00b1 2.05% to 88.59 \u00b1 1.71%; in fact, both extracts decreased gene conversion frequencies (Table 5). The percentage-of-survival results showed a significant interaction term between the dry/rainy geopropolis samples (factor 1) and geopropolis extract amount (factor 2) (p-value = 0.031) in the two-way ANOVA model (R2 = 0.914; p-value < 0.001; residual standard error = 4.70). Geopropolis extract, regardless of harvest time, was found to reduce the survival rate of S. cerevisiae D7 (ATCC 201137), an effect that became more pronounced as the concentration of extract added increased. When S. cerevisiae cells were incubated in the presence of geopropolis and EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate; mutagen), both samples were found to have anti-genotoxic action, causing a reduction in both mutant colonies and gene conversion. The dry geopropolis had higher gene-conversion and colony values compared to rainy geopropolis. Furthermore, the increase in geopropolis extract concentration from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/mL significantly decreased the colony values (two-way ANOVA; R2 = 0.893; p-value < 0.001; residual standard error = 3.14; interaction term p-value = 0.148). As for the mutant colony results, the interaction term was significant (p-value = 0.018) in the two-way ANOVA model (R2 = 0.960; p-value < 0.001; residual standard error = 9.45). The results\nshowed that as the geopropolis-extract concentration increased, the effects on mutant colonies appeared to converge for the two samples.\nDifferent letters (a, b, c, d, e, f) indicate significant differences (multiple comparisons using Tukey\u2019s HSD)."

            "text": "In this study, where two samples of geopropolis from the Atlantic biome were evaluated, 75 different pollen types were detected. This was much more than the number detected by other studies, for example, the study performed by Barros et al. [30], who analyzed 16 samples of geopropolis produced in a resting area in the state of Maranh\u00e3o and only identified 38 pollen types. These results reveal the diversity of plant taxa available in this region as sources for Mellipona scutellaris throughout the year. Among these various types, Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) emerges as particularly significant due to its widespread presence and distribution. A study conducted by Barth et al. [31] in Southeastern Brazil, focusing on geopropolis, classified the Eucalyptus type as the dominant pollen source, accounting for more than 45% of the analyzed samples. Notably, plant species associated with this type frequently appear in research related to propolis and other beekeeping/melipon products in Brazil. Despite not being a native species to the Brazilian flora, Eucalyptus has demonstrated remarkable adaptability to the country\u2019s climate and soil conditions. Since the 1990s, it has been actively utilized in an extractive manner across various regions of Brazil, as documented by Ara\u00fajo et al. [32]. Resin constitutes a noteworthy component of geopropolis, yet the factors influencing bees\u2019 preferences for specific resin sources remain a mystery, even though they exhibit discerning choices in this regard [30]. Stingless bee species exhibit regional variations in collecting resins from different plants, making the presence of their pollen in geopropolis a valuable clue for potential resin sources [33]. Notably, Schinus terebinthifolius (Anacardiaceae) and Cecropia (Urticaceae) species, as identified by [13], are potential resin providers for Apis mellifera propolis in the North Coast region of Bahia, coinciding with the study area. Pollen referring to these species was very frequent in the analyzed samples and may also be indicative of sources of resin used by M. scutellaris to produce geopropolis in this region."

            "text": "The composition of geopropolis is complex as it contains mineral particles or ash from the soil. These particles are incorporated into this product when bees encounter the soil during the collection of resins and other materials used in its production. Geopropolis is mainly known for its pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Despite the great multiplicity of bee species capable of producing this product, studies on its physical\u2013chemical characteristics and biological properties are recent, and some of them scarce or non-existent. In this context, delving into research concerning the chemical composition and biological activity of stingless bee geopropolis holds pivotal significance. Such investigations not only\naim to establish a quality benchmark but also seek to unravel the mechanisms of action inherent to this remarkable natural product. According to the literature, geopropolis is generally slightly acidic, with pH values ranging between 3.5 and 5.5. Phenolic acids and flavonoids, which are relevant in the chemical composition of geopropolis, are the main factors responsible for this characteristic [1]. However, it is important to note that pH can vary with the origin of geopropolis and even within the same bee colony. Although this parameter has not been contemplated in the legislation, the values obtained in our study corroborate those described by da Silva Cruz et al. [2]. According to this researcher, pH is one of the main factors responsible for the stability of this product, as it influences the multiplication of its microbiota. Specific studies on the electrical conductivity of geopropolis are insufficient or nonexistent. However, it is possible to infer that the conductivity is probably low, particularly due to the high content of waxes and resins that are part of its composition. Regarding ashes, Oliveira et al. [34] analyzed geopropolis from different stingless bee species, reporting values ranging from 75.40 \u00b1 0.23% to 85.43 \u00b1 0.53% (m/m), which corroborate the results obtained in this study. According to Pereira et al. [35], the high values of this parameter compared to those observed in other bee products are justified by the fact that geopropolis is a mixture of clay/earth and resin, and consequently, its content of minerals and trace elements is higher. However, it is important to note that the concentration and specific composition of minerals in ash can vary depending on the region and the plants used by bees [36]. Sawaya et al. [33] reported that high ash contents indicate that the product has not been adulterated. Concerning moisture, the values obtained in our study were identical to those reported by Ara\u00fajo et al. [37] for Melipona scutellaris and M. fasciculata species (1.40% to 1.76%), suggesting that the moisture content of stingless bees is low. Indeed, da Silva Cruz et al. [2] found that the moisture content of geopropolis was six and eleven times lower than those of honey and pollen produced by M. scutellaris, respectively. The waxes in geopropolis are important components of the structures of hives, also possessing therapeutic properties. The results obtained in this study are identical to those observed by Ara\u00fajo et al. [37] in geopropolis of M. scutellaris (4.33%). However, they are higher than those described by the same author in geopropolis of M. fasciculata (0.95%) and by Cardozo et al. [38] in geopropolis of M. Jata\u00ed, M. Manda\u00e7aia, and M. Mandur\u00ed. Ara\u00fajo et al. [39] evaluated propolis collected in the same apiary and obtained values for this parameter that ranged between 25.45 and 24.09%, demonstrating that the product produced by Apismellifera had higher values than the geopropolis of stingless bees. These differences can be justified by the fact that the chemical composition of geopropolis varies with the flora and the geographical region where it is collected [39]. Phenolic compounds are present in several natural products, namely geopropolis, and are responsible for many of the biological properties associated with these products. However, it is important to note that the quantities, qualities, and beneficial effects of these substances depend on the specific chemical composition of each sample and the concentration of compounds present [40,41]. In samples of geopropolis from Melipona fasciculata collected by Dutra et al. [42] in the savannah of Maranh\u00e3o state, the values of this parameter ranged from 14.14 to 67.46%. These values were higher than those observed by these authors in the geopropolis of M. scutellaris obtained in the state of Bahia (Brazil). According to Ara\u00fajo et al. [39], the flora of the region and the species of stingless bee can quantitatively influence the content of total phenols in this bee product. Regarding flavonoids, Cardozo et al. [38] obtained lower contents (0.66 to 0.02%) than those quantified in our study. This variation in flavonoid content between different geopropolis samples has already been reported by other researchers, for example, ref. [42], who evaluated the flavonoid content in geopropolis produced in Maranh\u00e3o and obtained values between 0.17 and 6.0%. Sawaya et al. [33] observed flavonoid contents in extracts of geopropolis of Melipona fasciculata from the same state ranging from 0.85% to 1.85%. According to these researchers, the variations in the content of flavonoid compounds in\nthe different studies may result from differences in the time and time of collection of the geopropolis, vegetation, or the type of soil collected by the bees, since the extraction methods and the extracting solvents used were the same."

In our study, we noted variations in phenolic compound levels between samples collected in different seasons. Naringin, the most abundant compound in both samples, was about 1.5 times lower in concentration during the dry season compared to the rainy season. Kasote et al. [44] found a similar phenolic compound profile in geopropolis from various Indian states, with naringin being the predominant compound. In contrast, gallic acid was a primary component in propolis samples from stingless bees collected in Brazilian states like Pernambuco, Parana, and S\u00e3o Paulo [45]. Santos et al. [6] also reported that the hydroalcoholic extracts of geopropolis from Melipona orbignyi stood out for presenting flavonoids, aromadendrin, and naringenin. Naringin is a glycosylated flavanone commonly found in citrus fruits and grapes. This compound possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and antimicrobial properties [46,47]."

Free radical scavenging is one of the methodologies frequently used to assess antioxidant capacity [20]. DPPH free radical scavenging measures the ability of the analyzed substances to donate hydrogen ions [49]. The reducing power of a given product indicates its antioxidant potential [20]. The \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid system measures the antioxidant potential of a substance as the ability to sequester the free radical generated by the peroxidation of linoleic acid [50]. Santos et al. [6], when analyzing the antioxidant activity of geopropolis from Melipona orbignyi using the DPPH method, obtained IC50 values of 18.3 \u00b5g/mL. These values were lower than those determined in our study, suggesting that this biological property is influenced by the local flora and bee species. However, Ara\u00fajo et al. [39], in their investigation of geopropolis from Melipona scutellaris collected in an area with vegetation identical to that in our study, reported IC50 values determined by the DPPH method that were remarkably similar to those observed in our work. The values obtained by Batista et al. [51] in hydro-ethanolic extracts of geopropolis produced by M. fasciculata in Maranh\u00e3o also corroborate our determinations.

Overall, Staphylococcus aureus ESA 321, a clinical isolate from pus, was the most sensitive microorganism to the action of both matrices under study, and Candida albicans ESA115, isolated from a sputum, was the most resistant. The geopropolis extract showed greater efficacy against Proteus mirabilis than previously reported by Campos et al. [29] in a study involving a geopropolis extract produced by stingless bees (Tetragonisca fiebrigi) in Grandes Dourados. These authors observed MIC values for this bacterium of between 2.25 and 3.08 mg/mL, i.e., higher than those obtained in our study. The fact that yeasts are eukaryotic organisms may justify their behavior towards bacteria. The higher resistance of Gram-negative bacteria can be explained by their more complex cell wall composition, which makes it more difficult for antimicrobials to enter. In all cases, the resistance of the reference microorganisms was higher than that of the clinical isolates, probably because the clinical isolates had already acquired antimicrobial resistance. Our results are identical to those reported by Santos et al. [6] in geopropolis produced in Grandes Dourados by Melipona orbignyi. Liberio et al. [52] found that geopropolis samples produced by M. fasciculata inhibited the growth of C. albicans. Da Cunha et al. [53] studied the antimicrobial effect of geopropolis samples of M. scutellaris, collected in the study area where the samples used in our study were from, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and found that the growth of S. aureus was inhibited for concentrations higher than 50 \u00b5g/mL while the MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was higher than 1600 \u00b5g/mL. These observations corroborate our results, indicating that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive than Gram-negative bacteria. Valcanaia et al. [54] reported that natural products showing antimicrobial activity with MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values below 100 \u00b5g/mL can be considered good antimicrobial agents. In this context, the results obtained in this work suggest that geopropolis can be used as an antibacterial agent, with its antifungal effect being more limited. According to what has been reported in the literature, phenolic compounds are said to be mainly responsible for the biological properties of hive products, particularly geopropolis. Polyphenol derivatives common in propolis have been shown to exert a wealth of therapeutic benefits [55], having antioxidant capacity (can interrupt the chain reactions caused by free radicals but can also inhibit their formation), antimicrobial (can induce the permeabilization of the microbial cytoplasmic membrane and inhibition of the synthesis of nucleic acids in Gram-negative/Gram-positive bacteria and synthesis of ATP and interruption of electron transport) and anti-inflammatory activity and pro-inflammatory enzymes [6] such as nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 [56]."

In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that the timing of harvest influences the chemical profile and bioactivity of M. scutellaris geopropolis. Antioxidant, antibacterial, antimutagenic, anti-cholinesterase, and inflammatory capabilities, particularly evident in the samples obtained during the rainy season, suggest the potential of this product for preventing inflammatory, oxidative, and infectious diseases. Although the meliponary under study is in an area where extractive agriculture is practiced, the maintenance of the vegetation ensures resource availability throughout the year. However, it is necessary to protect these species to ensure that the production of this natural product becomes a sustainable source of income. Additionally, these findings show the importance of studies that search for effective alternative therapies in facing the global increase in resistance to antibiotics currently used and point out the extracts as possible candidates for the development of new treatments against bacterial infections. On the other hand, the high variability of the chemical profile of geopropolis of Melipona species is a factor requiring strategies aiming at the standardization of the product.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11112779/s1, Figure S1: HPLC chromatogram obtained for the rainy geopropolis propolis sample at 280 nm; Figure S2: HPLC chromatogram obtained for the dry geopropolis sample at 280 nm; Table S1: Phenolic compounds analysed by HPLC.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.D., L.M.E., L.G.D. and F.d.A.R.S.; methodology, V.M., N.S., H.R., S.C., L.F. and V.B.P.; formal analysis, V.M. and L.G.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.D., V.M., N.S., H.R. and S.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.M.E., F.d.A.R.S. and L.G.D.
