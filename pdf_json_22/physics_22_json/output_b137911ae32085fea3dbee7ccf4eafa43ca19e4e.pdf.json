    "abstractText": "Diffractive Optical Elements (DOEs) are commonly used in the photonics community for several purposes, such as geometrical calibration of cameras, medical treatments, lithography, LIDAR applications. In the context of the optical alignment and integration of the RAman Spectrometer for MMX (RAX), a DOE was included in the test setup with the goal of providing a clear figure of merit to optimize the focusing of a dioptric lens objective on to the spectrometer detector. This Raman spectrometer will be integrated later this year in a small Rover on-board the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission led by JAXA, and will operate on Phobos\u2019 surface to characterize the different materials composing Phobos\u2019 soil. To achieve this, the optical design of RAX is very challenging in terms of performance to reach in very limited volume and mass. As described in Ref. 2, the optical alignment and integration of RAX was a very challenging exercise, requiring several optical setups and methods. The usage of a DOE was introduced to solve a classical problem during the integration of a camera: how to integrate both the optical objective (lens assembly) and the detector to ensure that both the optical focal plane and the detector sensitive plane are co-planar. When illuminated by a collimated laser beam, the implemented DOE generates a regular pattern of collimated beams with well-known deviation angles from the input beam. It acts as a 2D diffraction grating, and generates a pattern field which covers the entire field of view of our camera. Thanks to this property, the Camera Interface Objective of RAX could be successfully positioned and oriented with respect to the detector mechanical interface. It was achieved by acquiring successive images of the DOE pattern with controlled defocused laser beam illuminating it. We were then able to compute the equivalent mechanical defocus needed to maximize the image quality. This maximizes the overall instrument performance and will ensure best possible scientific measurement on Phobos.",

The first step in this process is generally to clearly define a merit function determining what is actually this best focus position. For a spectrometer, this merit function may be the spectral resolution achieved on the detector. For an extended scene imager, the measurement of the Modulation Transfer Function or the contrast of an image is another candidate, while for point source imagers or photometers, the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) characterization is the most common method. For example, for the PLATO exoplanet-hunting Mission, the best focus position for each Camera is determined by characterizing the PSF size of a point-source (simulating a star) at different field of view positions.3 The detailed merit function is this case is the Ensquared Energy Fraction (EEF) of each PSF within a given number of pixel size (e.g. a square of 3x3 pixels).\nSuch measurements have however the main drawback to be time-consuming and complex in terms of laboratory setup. Indeed, in order to reach several field of view positions, the camera (or the light source) needs to be rotated in a precise, controlled and repeatable manner. This includes generally the use of a gimbal or hexapod system.\nFurther author information: Send correspondence to martin.pertenais@dlr.de\nAdvances in Optical and Mechanical Technologies for Telescopes and Instrumentation V, edited by Ram\u00f3n Navarro, Roland Geyl, Proc. of SPIE Vol. 12188, 121883Z\n\u00a9 2022 SPIE \u00b7 0277-786X \u00b7 doi: 10.1117/12.2627673\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12188 121883Z-1 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nTo overcome this drawback, we propose the use of a Diffractive Optical Element (DOE), introduced in more details in section 1.2. This allows the illumination of the sensor with a pattern of points covering the complete field of view in a single snapshot without needing any rotation system. The setup required is the same as the one used to performed the geometric calibration of a camera with a DOE, as was for example done for MERTIS on BepiColombo and explained in Ref. 4."

            "text": "Diffractive optical elements can be used to perform an amplitude-division on an incoming monochromatic beam with wavelength \u03bb, creating a number of beams with well-known propagation directions. As the image on the sensor is a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, each projected image point represents a point at infinity, denoted in\n3D projective space P3 by the homogeneous coordinate d = [ X,Y, Z, 0 ]T with\nd = [ \u03bbfx, \u03bbfy, \u221a 1\u2212 \u03bb2(f2x + f2y ), 0 ]T (1)\nwhere f = [fx, fy] denotes a spatial frequency encoded in the DOE. With suitable computational algorithms 5 it is possible to encode spatially aperiodic DOEs with arbitrary spatial frequencies, choosing the propagation directions freely. As they are easier to design for the large aperture diameters needed, a spatially periodic DOE was used here. Its spatial frequency is given by fx,y = nx,y/gx,y, with grating constants [gx, gy] and [nx, ny] denoting the particular diffraction orders. The grating vectors are defining the x\u2212 and y\u2212axes of the DOE reference frame. However, eq. (1) is only valid if the incident light wave is a plane wave with uniform intensity distribution, perfectly perpendicular to the DOE surface. In a real setup, the beam is finite in extension and often has a non-uniform intensity profile, which is typically Gaussian. Moreover, a slight tilt of the DOE with respect to the incident beam is hard to avoid. As we will see later on, this tilt has however no significant impact on the size of the spots, which is what matters for this particular application.\nThe deviations of the real beam profile from a plane wave cause the diffraction spots in the far field to have a certain size, which can be estimated from the Convolution theorem of Fourier Optics.6 The consequent propagation directions are determined with the diffraction formula for non-perpendicular incidence to the DOE. For the following analysis, the DOE reference system will be used, in which the incident beam is given by\nr = [ sin(\u03b2),\u2212 sin(\u03b1) cos(\u03b2), cos(\u03b1) cos(\u03b2) ]T (2)\nwith the Euler angles \u03b1 and \u03b2 rotating the x\u2212 and y-axes of the DOE reference frame w.r.t. the collimator reference frame. The directions of the diffracted beams are now obtained as follows7\nd = [ \u03bbfx + rx, \u03bbfy + ry, ( 1\u2212 (\u03bbfx + rx)2 \u2212 (\u03bbfy + ry)2 )1/2 , 0 ]T . (3)\nAs seen with eq. (3), it is in principle no problem to use wavelengths on a DOE, that are different than the wavelength it has been optimised for. The directions of the diffracted beams will then be different, but will\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12188 121883Z-2 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nstill create a regular pattern of beams. It is straightforward to calculate the diffracted beam directions in the DOE reference frame by simple matrix operations. In order to transform the beam directions into the camera reference frame, the exterior orientation of the camera w.r.t. the DOE reference frame has to be considered with\nd\u2032 = [ R t 0 1 ] d, (4)\nwhere R is a 3\u00d73 rotation matrix defining the camera orientation and t the translation vector for the camera position. Equation (4) shows that the mapping of ideal points at infinity is invariant against translation."

The beam wavelength varies linearly with input angle so that the -10\u00b0 beam has a wavelength of 532nm and the +10\u00b0 beam a wavelength of 680nm. With these specifications, the\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12188 121883Z-3 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nobjective\u2019s focal length is 29.6 mm and the 532 nm \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 680 nm spectral range is mapped onto a line on the camera ranging over \u00b15.16 mm. Figure 3 shows the opto-mechanical design of the CIO, including 7 lenses and telecentric output beams on the left hand side.\nRAX focal plane assembly consists of the 3D-Plus 3DCM734-1 CMOS camera module. It contains both the 4 Megapixels CMOS detector itself and the digital processing unit. It is visible as the gold part of fig. 4. This was mounted onto a bracket in a way that provided lateral position adjustments of the detector sensitive surface as well as simple and repeatable integration in the RAX housing. The other adjustable degrees of freedom between the CIO and detector assembly were the axial position of the CIO and the tip/tilt orientation of the CIO. These were controlled by shimming in a \u201dMaxwell\u201d kinematic mount, consisting of three sphere-in-V-groove interfaces separated by 120 degrees about the optical axis. The spherical surfaces were attached to the CIO at the end of each radial \u201darm\u201d, while the grooves were machined into the rectangular bracket bearing the detector. The sphere/groove interfaces were pressed together by screws passing through the middle each sphere/groove interface. As the spherical washers are not monolithic with the CIO, mechanical tolerances were minimised to reduce clearance around the washer. Although separation of the CIO from the focal plane assembly was required to laterally adjust the detector sensitive surface, the repeatability of the designed kinematic mount allowed the same CIO position and orientation were achieved upon CIO re-integration. As seen in fig. 4, all optomechanical components in the RAX spectrometer were blackened with coatings, tested for ultra-low laser scattering and Fluorescence emission.12"

The 633 nm laser used was fed into the setup with a multimode fiber placed on the focal plane position of a microscope objective creating the collimated beam. The fiber output was placed on a translation stage allowing the operator to control the focus position of the laser with respect to the collimator. A Shack-Hartmann sensor was used after the collimator to properly place the fiber output in order to create the best collimated beam possible. The setup is presented in fig. 5.\nAfter the laser has been properly collimated, the next step is to align the optical axis of the Camera (CIO + detector) with the collimated laser beam. This is done by acquiring images of the collimated beam and minimizing the easily detectable coma of the spot (image of the fiber output) visible on the image.

Figure 6 shows an example of image acquired with the camera and the DOE placed in front of it. The 0th diffraction order is well aligned with the optical axis and is imaged in the center of the detector. A pattern of \u00b12 points around the 0th order is visible. Due to vignetting, the 4 points in the corners are not visible.\nIn this particular case, the DOE surface is much larger than the entrance pupil. Therefore the absolute X/Y position of the DOE with respect to the camera is irrelevant. The rotational position of the DOE with respect to the optical axis is also irrelevant for us as the size of the spots created by the diffraction effect is independent from the incident angle. The only downside of having the DOE not perfectly orthogonal to the optical axis is in term of radiometry with a decreased diffraction efficiency. In order to verify this, a repeatability test has been performed and is presented in the next section."

This is done by translating the output of the laser fiber at the entrance of the collimator. Using the Vernier scale of the translation stage, the physical defocus applied can be known very precisely. For each defocus step, the focus quality is estimated with a given merit function estimating the PSF size. Using the longitudinal magnification between the entrance of the collimator and the detector (square ratio of the focal lengths), the best focus position estimated can be converted into a physical defocus between the CIO and the detector. This gap can then be corrected by shims to bring the detector on the optical best focus position.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12188 121883Z-5 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 04 Oct 2022 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use"

            "text": "The definition for the best focus merit function in this study case was chosen to be the average Ensquared Energy Fraction (EEF) in 3x3 pixels. The image of each spot creates a PSF on the detector that spreads the light into several pixels. When the detector is at the best focus position of the optical objective, the PSF is the smallest possible and the fraction of light enclosed in a fixed number of pixels (in this case 3x3) is then maximized. In practise, an analyses script was developed to process the images acquired. The steps performed by the script are the following:\n\u2022 Open and read the signal image\n\u2022 Open and read the background images (with laser turned off)\n\u2022 Subtract the median background from the signal image\n\u2022 Identify the 20 spots of interests in the pre-processed image\n\u2022 Identify for each spot the 3x3 macro-pixel providing the highest flux\n\u2022 Compare this integrated flux to the reference, being the integrated flux of 12x12 pixels around each spot.\n\u2022 Plot a field of view map of this EEF in 3x3 pixels and save the average value across the field of view.\nIn order to verify the statement made earlier on the DOE position with respect to the Camera, and make sure that we don\u2019t need to create a setup positioning it with more precision, a repeatability test was performed. It also enabled us to have first estimate of the error bars of the measurement due to the setup itself and the processing script. For a fixed focus position, an image was acquired and the average EEF over all spots in 2x2 and in 3x3 pixels computed. The DOE was then physically removed from the setup and placed again by hand in a similar position. This was done in total 11 times.\nFigure 7 shows the result of the EEF in 2x2 pixels (blue points) and in 3x3 pixels (orange points). The result of this repeatability test shows a standard deviation of the 2x2 pixels measurement of 1.6% and 0.5% for 3x3 pixels.\nThis is excellent result confirming the very small, if not negligible, dependency of the measurement to the absolute position of the DOE with respect to the camera.

This is the main reason why the EEF in 3x3 pixels was used for the actual calibration and not 2x2 pixels."

After proper focusing of the collimator, this fine screw offered a range of \u00b12 rotations in each direction (ClockWise and AntiClockWise).\nThe first iteration of measurement provided an unexpected result: the PSF size field of view map showed very large PSF across the complete FoV with EEF in 3x3 pixels of around 15%, while more than 80% is expected around the best focus. This meant that we were very far for the best focus position. By defocusing the collimated laser beam in both direction, the merit function increased significantly after 2 fine rotations in the clock-wise direction and brought the average EEF in 3x3 pixels up to 20%. With a fine rotation being a displacement of 50 \u00b5m and a longitudinal magnitude of 4, these 2 rotations corresponded to a defocus between the CIO and the detector of 25 \u00b5m. The 20% being still very far away from the expected performance, we suspected the best focus position to be much further away and decided therefore the remove the 100 \u00b5m shims positioned at the mechanical interface between the CIO and the detector, and repeat the measurement. After removal of the shims, re-integration of the CIO to the detector and alignment of the setup, the test was repeated and provided the results shown in fig. 8.\nThis measurement was performed using the coarse screw of the translation stage instead of the fine one, which is less precise but with a much wider range. The results present a significant increase of our merit function and smallest PSF for a defocus between 0.8 and 1 coarse clock-wise rotation. A coarse rotation corresponds to a physical translation of 500 \u00b5m of the focus of the fiber collimator, or 125 \u00b5m between the CIO and the detector. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the field of view maps for the 4 focus points also plotted in fig. 8.\nThe conclusion from this test is that there still is a defocus of 100 to 125 \u00b5m between the detector and the CIO. As the defocus is in the negative direction, the CIO is 100 to 125 \u00b5m too far away from the detector sensitive area. The optomechanical design assumed 100 \u00b5m would be more than enough adjustment range to compensate manufacturing and assembly tolerances. So the defocus cannot be fully removed by removing shims.\nThe solution chosen was to remove approximately 150 \u00b5m from the three spherical washers in the kinematic mount, and then add corresponding shims if necessary."

Compared to more standard methods used for similar tests, and involving the use of an hexapod or gimbal, this method offers the possibility to reach similar results with a much simplified and robust setup. The only moving part needed is a translation stage to control the defocus of the incoming light. One limitation of this method is that is works only with monochromatic light. For very chromatic instruments working in broadband applications, the test would have to be repeated for several wavelength and the measurement recombined into an equivalent polychromatic PSF."
