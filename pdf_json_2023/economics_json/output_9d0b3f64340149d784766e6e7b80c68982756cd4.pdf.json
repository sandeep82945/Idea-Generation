    "abstractText": "The variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources pose several challenges for power systems operations, including energy curtailment and price volatility. In power systems with considerable renewable sources, co-variability in renewable energy supply and electricity load can intensify these outcomes. In this study, we examine the impacts of renewable co-variability across multiple spatial and temporal scales on the New York State power system, which is undergoing a major transition toward increased renewable generation. We characterize the spatiotemporal co-variability of renewable energy-generating resources and electricity load and investigate the impact of climatic variability on electricity price volatility. We use an accurate, reduced-form representation of the New York power system, which integrates additional wind, and solar power resources to meet the state\u2019s energy targets through 2030. Our results demonstrate that renewable energy resources can vary up to 17% from the annual average, though combining different resources reduces the overall variation to \u2248 8%. On an hourly basis, renewable volatility is substantially greater and may vary up to 100% above and below average. This results in a 9% variation in annual average electricity prices and up to a 56% variation in the frequency of price spikes. While yearly average price volatility is influenced mainly by hydropower availability, daily and hourly price volatility is influenced by solar and wind availability.",

Because the electricity sector is a major contributor to GHG emissions [2], power system decarbonization through the adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is a high priority. It also has the potential to facilitate the decarbonization of transportation and buildings, so it has progressed rapidly in recent years. The European Union aims for RES to provide at least 40% of their overall energy mix by 2030, while China has committed to generating 35% of its electricity from renewables by the same time. In 2021, the United States (U.S.) re-joined the Paris Agreement and set an ambitious plan to reduce net GHG emissions by around 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 [3], and to deliver net-zero emissions no later than 2050. Accordingly, the U.S. plans to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035 [3].\nek574@cornell.edu (E. Kabir); vs498@cornell.edu (V. Srikrishnan); ml2589@cornell.edu (M.V. Liu); ss3378@cornell.edu (S.

Renewable energy sources are highly variable and intermittent [4, 5, 6]. This includes variability in peak values and consistency of renewable energy generation, co-variability between renewable sources and load across timescales [4, 6], and the spatial complementarity of renewable sources across regions [5]. Even though the characterization of renewable energy variability has gained attention, much of the effort has concentrated on solar energy (e.g., [4, 5, 7]) and wind energy (e.g., [6, 8, 9]), in isolation or considering co-variability across wind and solar [10, 11]. Studies have, less commonly, included co-variability with hydropower (subsequently referred to as \"hydro\") and the drivers of electricity load (i.e., temperature), which can also vary over decadal time scales. Studies of renewable variability have often focused on certain regions (e.g., Europe [11, 10] and Western U.S. [12]) and less frequently on other regions undergoing energy transitions.\nIncreasing variable renewable energy penetration results in other challenges in the absence of sufficient storage and transmission capacity, such as increased energy curtailment, supply shortages, and transmission congestion. These challenges are exacerbated by difficulties in forecasting renewable energy production at intra-daily timescales [8] and operational strategies are needed to mitigate these additional uncertainties [7, 13]. Accurately quantifying these risks is instrumental for developing strategies to manage them, e.g., [14, 15]. There is a research gap in characterizing how operational constraints interact with substantial amounts of hydro, wind, and solar variability across various spatial and temporal scales.\nAnother critical challenge renewable energy variability introduces is increased electricity price volatility [9]. When price volatility rises, long-term investors may delay investment or increase risk management activities, raising electricity prices. Price volatility can be increased by changes in renewable energy curtailment, supply shortage, and transmission congestion, though stable regulatory policies can reduce these effects [16, 9]. The impacts of variable renewable energy and the above bottlenecks on price volatility are region-specific [17] and may differ across time. Therefore, studying the implications of the above constraints on the price distribution across space and time scales is needed.\nTo address the aforementioned research gaps, we explore the RES co-variability in a hybrid energy system with large-scale wind, solar, and hydropower deployment across a multi-decadal time period. We study the impacts of this co-variability and its interaction with the structure and operation of the New York State (NYS) power system, primarily renewable energy curtailment and electricity price volatility. We also identify the meteorological and climatic conditions associated with increases to these risks. We use a representation of the NYS power system [18], modified to meet the state\u2019s 2030 decarbonization target [19]. We develop a multi-period DC optimal power flow model which integrates RES and energy storage units into the system. Using a 40-year historical record of meteorological variables, we simulate hourly wind, solar, and hydropower across NYS and temperature-based electricity demand. Producing renewable energy and electricity load data for this long time horizon while preserving their spatiotemporal co-variability allows us to investigate renewable energy and electricity load co-variability and their consequent risks, including energy curtailment and price volatility, under a wide range of weather conditions. Finally, we do sensitivity analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of results to the central assumptions made in the model.\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 29\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the NYS power grid and the NYS Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) decarbonization plan as our case study. Section 3 describes the multi-period DC optimal power flow formulation used to model renewable resource integration in the power grid. It then summarizes the actual representation of the NYS power grid and the modifications made to meet the state\u2019s decarbonization targets. Section 4 explains how needed data is generated and integrated into the model, and section 5 represents all the numerical results. Section 6 discusses the sensitivity of results to model assumptions and possible improvements that can be made to the model and data. Finally, section 7 summarizes and concludes the paper."

            "text": "NYS has one of the most ambitious decarbonization targets among U.S. states [20]. These goals are codified in the Community Leadership and Climate Protection Act (CLCPA) [21]. The CLCPA promises to increase the RES share to 70% of total electricity load by 2030 and to have a zero-emission grid by 2040. NYS is also one of the country\u2019s largest hydropower producers, allowing the state to combine hydropower with wind and solar energy sources and have an accelerated transition toward its clean energy target. Having (i) an ambitious renewable target and (ii) a large source of hydropower makes the NYS power grid an appropriate case study to understand the potential challenges and benefits of this transition. .\nFollowing the state\u2019s power system transition plan, the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) commissioned several studies focusing on the state\u2019s long-term energy and peak load, power system reliability, and future capacity needs, establishing a framework for this paper\u2019s analysis. The study in [22]\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 3 of 29\ndeveloped a long-term energy and peak load forecast model for the state\u2019s load zones (see Figure 1), reflecting the potential impact of electrification of transportation and heating. Building on that study, the work in [23] simulated the potential impacts of climate change and climate policy on power system operations and provided updated energy and peak load forecasts. Every year, NYISO also releases a \u201cGold Book\" providing forecasted and realized peak demand and energy usage under different scenarios, including under the CLCPA. The 2021 Gold Book [24] estimates energy use and peak demand considering projections of weather trends under climate change, economic growth, energy efficiency, behind-the-meter (BTM) solar photovoltaic (PV) and non-solar generators, energy storage, and electrification.\nTo meet the CLCPA target for 2030, the Congestion Assessment and Resource Integration Study [25] developed a zonal-level renewable capacity build-out scenario (i.e., the 70\u00d730 scenario), whereby installed renewable energy equaled approximately 70% of the energy consumed in the state. A related effort [26] evaluated the reliability of the New York bulk electric grid through 2030 based on planned upgrades to the transmission system, and in the process developed the topology of the transmission system, interface limits between zones, and transfer limits between the New York control area and the external areas for 2030. The work presented in the current study builds on many of the system modeling assumptions used in these earlier analyses."

The land-based wind farms include all operational and under-development wind farms as indicated by [27] and [28], respectively. To locate additional wind generation which is not currently under development [28], we use the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit (WTK) [29], which provides a ranking of prospective locations for wind farms based on geography and wind resource statistics. From the 2859 wind farms determined for NYS, we randomly choose farms so that the overall capacity of wind farms in each zone satisfies the zonal capacity targets described in Table 1. The offshore wind farms include the five underdevelopment farms identified by [30], totaling 4300 (MW) in capacity. Finally, to provide the unplanned offshore wind power capacity that remains, we model four additional offshore wind farms according to the study done in [30]. To simulate the wind power generation, we use the 10m surface-level wind speed from the MERRA-2 reanalysis product between 1980 \u2212 2019. For each land-based and offshore wind farm, we interpolate the wind speed data to the 100m level and bias-correct it against the actual NREL WTK wind speed data, as in [31]. Then, we calculate wind power generation using the approach presented in [32]."

            "text": "Our analysis shows that on a long-term average and state-wide basis, dispatched power from renewable, nuclear, thermal, and imported sources account for 62%, 19%, 15%, and 4% of the state load, respectively. However, these sources of dispatched power are not distributed evenly across the state. For renewable\nsources, on-shore wind power is concentrated upstate in Zones A, C, D, and E, offshore wind is concentrated off the coast of the New York City metropolitan area in Zones J and K, and dispatched hydropower is predominantly generated upstate in Zones A and D (Figure 3-a). Dispatched solar power is more evenly distributed across zones, while nuclear power is concentrated mainly upstate in zones B and C. The consequence of this uneven distribution of generation is substantial reliance on power transfer across zones. For example, upstate Zones A, C, D, and E dispatch more power than required to meet their own load in order to address power deficiencies downstate in Zones F, G, H, I, J, and K. Imported power also plays an important role in meeting demand in high load zones downstate and primarily comes from PJM to the southwest.\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 11 of 29\nThe proportion of dispatched power used to meet load across the state also varies substantially over various timescales due to variability in climate, its impact on RES generation and energy demand, and their interaction with constraints in the power system. At an annual and state-wide scale, these interacting factors cause the dispatched renewables, including wind, solar, and hydropower, to range +/- 6.6% of the long-term average over the 40-year record (Figure 3-b). For load, this range is +/-4.8%. This degree of variability increases at shorter timescales and for different power sources. For instance, while the range of dispatched hydropower varies between +/- 13.6% of its long-term average at an annual scale, this range increases to +/- 44% at a monthly scale and +/- 89% at a daily scale (Table 5; also see Figure A4). Dispatched wind and solar power vary considerably at shorter timescales, with a range reaching +/- 469% for solar power and +/- 194% for wind power at an hourly scale. (Percentage greater than 100% represents the upper bound of the range.) Overall, dispatched hydropower is the most stable source at hourly, daily, and monthly scales, but is the most variable source at annual scales. Conversely, dispatched solar power is the most variable at hourly timescales but is the most stable renewable power source at an annual scale. This is because, in NYS, hydropower is primarily from great lakes, a big water source that does not change substantially in shorter time scales. Variability in the sum of dispatched power across all three renewable sources is lower across all timescales compared to any particular source, but still remains substantial across timescales.\nSome (though not all) of the variability in renewable dispatched power relates to variability in generation linked to weather, and this variability can exhibit different patterns across timescales depending on power source. This is visualized in Figure 4, which presents state-wide renewable generation over the 40-year record rather than dispatched power. Hydropower exhibits the most persistence in generation at an annual scale, with periods of above-average generation between years 1 \u2212 20 and again during years 35 \u2212 40, and periods of below-average generation between years 20 \u2212 35. This persistence is linked to slowly varying levels in the Great Lakes that drive generation at the Moses Niagara and Moses Saunders hydropower plants.\nWind and solar generation do not exhibit similar persistence at the annual scale, with anomalies from the long-term average occurring randomly from year to year. However, these two sources do exhibit more persistent seasonal behavior in their generation, with wind generation reaching its maximum (minimum) in the cold (warm) season and solar generation exhibiting the opposite pattern. At hourly scales, solar generation\nexhibits the expected diurnal cycle, while wind power shows greater generation in the first half of the day and lower values in the second half. Hydropower exhibits no hourly variability in generation by design (see Section 4.3)."

            "heading": "5.2. Renewable Power Curtailment and Congestion",
            "text": "While some of the variability in dispatched renewable power is due to weather-driven generation patterns, a substantial proportion results from curtailment caused by system constraints. A large fraction of generated renewable power is curtailed in the system, with some renewable power unused in 62% of hours in the 40- year record. However, curtailment varies widely by source and location (Figure 5-a). The most substantial curtailment occurs for hydropower in Zones A and D, accounting for 27% and 17% of total generation. This compares to just 1.8% of total wind power being curtailed and 2.2% of solar power.\nTwo factors primarily drive higher hydropower curtailments. First, hydropower is assumed to have slightly greater cost compared to wind and solar power (see Section 4), so hydropower may be curtailed when wind and solar generation are sufficient to meet demand (see Figure A5). Second, hydropower generation is concentrated in Zones A and D, and so is vulnerable to curtailment when congestion limits the transfer of power out of these zones. Interface flow limits account for 90% of all renewable curtailment cases, while the remaining curtailment events are due to ramping constraints, imports of cheaper power (i.e., with negative LMP) from neighboring ISOs, and system-wide oversupply of renewable power.\nWe explore the issue further in Figure 5-b, which shows congestion in various parts of the transmission system expressed as the fraction of time that flow reaches its limit at each interface. System congestion is mainly observed in three cases: (i) B\u2192C\u2192E\u2192G, (ii) K\u2192I, and (iii) at interfaces between NYISO and neighboring ISOs. The first case is due to high supply in zones A through E and high demand in zones F to K. This situation commonly arises when the combined dispatch of wind and solar power downstate is low and dispatched hydropower in Zones A and D is high, causing congestion and limiting transfer from upstate to downstate (see Figure A5). The second case arises because of zone K\u2019s large offshore wind generation and its limited transmission capacity to other zones. We note that curtailment in renewable generation is\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 13 of 29\nconsiderable despite the substantial capacity of batteries throughout the system (see Section 4.4). Batteries supply an average of 3.4% of the annual load and cut renewable energy curtailment by approximately 3%. However, the charging and discharging of batteries cause average losses of 0.6% of the total annual load. Batteries have a greater influence at higher temporal frequencies; at the hourly time scale, batteries provide up to 27% of load, and during peak load hours, they deliver 10% of load on average. Batteries in zones H, I, J, and D are cycled fully in more than 25% of hours in the 40-year record, implying that adding additional storage capacity beyond the CLCPA scenario employed here would be beneficial (Figure A6)."

            "text": "The variability in dispatched power from renewable sources with low (or zero) marginal cost, in combination with variations in load, require more expensive thermal generators to occasionally mitigate supply-demand imbalances in the system. This dynamic leads to variability in LMPs across the system, which we investigate here. At a state-wide and annual average scale, LMPs vary by +/-4.5% of their long-term average across the 40-year period of record (Figure 6-a). We note a period in years 20-40 that exhibit higher annual average LMPs corresponding to a period with concurrent negative anomalies in multiple renewable sources, especially annual hydropower and wind power (see Figure 4). However, variability in LMPs is greater when viewed at finer temporal scales. For instance, we define a price spike as an hourly price being above $33.5/MWh, which is the 95th percentile of all hourly LMPs during the 40-year study period. We find that the annual frequency of price spikes varies by +/-28% of the long-term average across the 40-year record (Figure 6-b). Interestingly, although annual average LMPs and annual price spike frequencies often occur in similar years, there is only a moderate correlation between these two variables. This suggests that the drivers leading to variability in these two price statistics differ across years. To better understand this result, we investigate the link between average LMPs at different timescales and the factors influencing price spikes,\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 14 of 29\nincluding dispatched renewable energy and load (Figure 7). Unsurprisingly, at all timescales, an increase in load leads to an increase in price. However, we find that the variability of prices at monthly and annual timescales is mainly driven by variability in wind and hydropower generation. Conversely, price spikes at daily (and hourly) timescales clearly are driven by multiple factors occurring simultaneously, including low dispatched wind and solar power and high levels of dispatched hydropower during periods of high load.\nFinally, for context, we compare the variability of state-level weighted LMPs from our modeled results with the variability of LMPs in the simulated model for 2019, when renewable sources constitute a far smaller share of total load (see Figure 8). Our results show that large-scale integration of renewable sources into the grid decreases zonal LMPs, particularly in upstate zones (i.e., A-F) where there are more RES. However, price variability increases, with the coefficient of variation of state-level LMPs increasing between 12% to 28%, with an average of 17%. This is especially true in zones with large amounts of renewable energy generation."

            "text": "This paper explores the potential outcomes associated with the increased build-out of renewable energy sources, such as those proposed in many countries and regions. While the approach is generalizable, our analysis uses the case of the NYS CLCPA to illustrate and explore performance over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Results of our analysis show that the spatial allocation of renewable resources will necessitate a considerable increase in the need for power transfer across zones. The curtailment of renewable power in about two-thirds of all hours in the 40-year simulated data shows that the resource availability does\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 15 of 29\nnot align with load patterns, and the system needs substantially more storage capacity to make efficient use of the planned renewable resource.\nIn addition to spatial variability, the power dispatch varies substantially over time due to variability in climate, driving RES generation and electricity demand, and the interaction of generation and demand with constraints in the power system. Different renewable power resources exhibit distinct temporal variability patterns; hydropower is the most stable energy source at shorter time scales and solar and wind power at longer time scales. Understanding the variability and uncertainty at a range of time scales is necessary to ensure the right mix of resources to mitigate potential issues of power system reliability.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the annual frequency of electricity price spikes depends on variability in renewable energy resources and load and their interactions with power system infrastructure limits, specifically transmission constraints. However, the drivers of increased volatility vary across different time scales. Also, the planned renewable resource mix causes heterogeneity in price changes across the space. Spatial electricity price heterogeneity can affect energy consumption patterns, the adoption of renewable energy sources , and\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 16 of 29\nthe electricity grid\u2019s stability, and create or exacerbate disparities in access to affordable energy. Therefore, the spatial patterns of impacts on electricity prices should be carefully considered by policymakers and energy regulators when designing renewable expansion policies. Increasing the grid\u2019s transmission capacity, promoting further energy storage, implementing demand response programs, and adopting more renewable energy sources, particularly in regions with higher electricity prices, are potential levers to reduce price heterogeneity through evenly balancing demand and supply across different regions, though the effectiveness of these measures depends on whether their implementation is responsive to the underlying spatial drivers of price volatility.\nAs we have seen, the impact of variability in RES on system reliability and electricity prices is sensitive to the structure of the power system. Specific outcomes, therefore, depend on differences between grid topologies, but are also influenced by model assumptions underlying the analysis. We analyzed the sensitivity of our findings to the underlying assumptions. Running the model for one sample year (i.e., year 32 with very large LMPs) demonstrates that the results are robust to our assumptions about the capacity and locations of wind, solar, and battery facilities. Under twelve alternative scenarios for this specific year, average LMP, price spike frequency, and total renewable generation, respectively, deviate up to 0.5%, 3%, and 1% from the base case scenario. The results, however, show higher sensitivity to assumptions made regarding the renewable capacity allocations across zones taken from [25], and also state-level capacity targets codified in the CLCPA. The reader is directed to the Appendix for more detail on the sensitivity analysis.\nWhile the results of this study highlight essential considerations and previously unreported risks to large-scale integration of renewable energy with a specific case study, this work has several caveats. First, even though we adopt an abstracted and validated representation of the power system, the model uses a relatively simplistic representation of market mechanisms, as well as excluding power losses due to transfers,\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 17 of 29\ndynamic transmission ratings, variability in solar panel efficiencies, and the impacts of renewable resource forecast uncertainty on battery operations, among other factors. Additionally, most of the assumptions made in our modeling framework were designed to be optimistic and are based on the assumption that the CLCPA targets would be reached. However, these goals are subject to critical challenges facing large-scale and rapid development and integration of renewable generation. The accuracy of the analysis could potentially be improved with the refinement of the developed load prediction model. The model can be further improved by (1) formulating auto-correlation between adjacent hourly loads and (2) adding the hour of the day as another feature vector. This may ignore the auto-correlation effect, but it may also avoid error propagation. Finally, we model power generation and price in neighboring ISOs based on their operation in 2019. Presumably, changes occurring in neighboring grids, including the addition of more renewable energy and the retirement of thermal generators, will affect the dynamics of transfers over these interfaces. Thus, the power flow and generation scheduling represented in this analysis may not capture the complex interactions of this evolution."

Using the historical record of meteorological variables over a 40-year time window, renewable generation and the electricity demand are simulated with the hourly resolution to maintain the co-variability between these inputs. The proposed modeling framework facilitates analysis of system operational performance under a wide range of weather conditions and with a comprehensive representation of renewable energy variability and electricity price volatility.\nOur results demonstrate that each renewable energy source can deviate up to 17% above and below average annually, while hybridization of wind, solar, and hydropower reduce the net variation to 8%. On an hourly basis, renewable volatility is substantially greater, and it may deviate 100% above and below average, creating challenges for infrastructure and operational reliability. The effects of renewable energy on prices are driven by different factors across time scales. For example, in this case study, renewable variability induces a 9% variation in annual average electricity prices and a 56% variation in the frequency of price spikes. While yearly average price volatility is mostly caused by differences in hydropower availability, daily and hourly price volatility is caused by fluctuations in solar and wind availability.\nUnderstanding the RES co-variability and its consequent risks at various temporal and spatial resolutions informs development and investment in power system infrastructure. It helps power system operators develop better regulation and dispatch policies to be well-prepared for changes in power production posed by extensive RES deployment. The results of this study provide additional insight into the necessity for further energy storage and transmission capacity. The proposed framework can be expanded to different years, for example 2040, to study the risks of 100% renewable scenario under potential shifts in the climate over time. Our framework can be extended to other power systems, particularly those with substantial contributions from hydroelectric generation, such as the eastern US.\nFirst Author et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 18 of 29"
