    "abstractText": "To address challenges associated with climate change, population growth and decline in international trade linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining whether national crop production can meet populations\u2019 requirements and contribute to socio-economic resilience is crucial. Three crop models and three global climate models were used in conjunction with predicted population changes. Compared with wheat production in 2000\u20132010, total production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020\u20132030, 2030\u20132040 and 2040\u20132050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. However, when considering population and climate changes, the predicted per capita production values were 125.3 \u00b1 0.3, 127.1 \u00b1 2.3 and 128.8 \u00b1 2.7 kg during the 2020\u20132030, 2030\u20132040, 2040\u20132050 periods under RCP4.5, or 126.2 \u00b1 0.7, 128.7 \u00b1 2.5, and 131.0 \u00b1 4.1 kg, respectively, under RCP8.5. These values do not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level (127.9 \u00b1 1.3 kg). The average per capita production in Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions declined. In contrast, per capita production in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and MiddleLower Yangtze Valleys subregions increased. The results suggest that climate change will increase total wheat production in China, but population change will partly offset the benefits to the grain market. In addition, domestic grain trade will be influenced by both climate and population changes. Wheat supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas. Further research is required to address effects of the changes on more crops and in more countries to obtain deeper understanding of the implications of climate change and population growth for global food production and assist formulation of robust policies to enhance food security.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, associated disruption of food supply chains and food production, together with accompanying reductions in incomes, have exacerbated food insecurity in many\u00a0countries (World Bank, 2020). Measures to control COVID-19 have included complete lockdown, international border closures, and transport restrictions that have heavily affected global food supply chains (Workie\net\u00a0al., 2020). The mobility restrictions have inevitably had negative effects on global food security (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). For example, in early stages of the pandemic, 21 countries imposed export restrictions, which reduced the volume of globally traded food by ca. 4% in terms of caloric value (Laborde et\u00a0al., 2020). These effects of the pandemic will lead to more people dying of hunger in developing countries, as ca. 40% of the population may lack staple food (Khan et\u00a0al., 2020), and impact food security through disruption of food supplies from developing countries in developed countries (Workie et\u00a0al., 2020). Hence, for example, the pandemic has raised food insecurity for low-income Americans (Fang et\u00a0al., 2021). According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2021), 690 million people (8.9% of the global population) were undernourished in 2019, and the pandemic likely increased this number. Therefore, ensuring self-sufficient food production is important for every country under conditions such as * Li Wang wangli5208@nwsuaf.edu.cn 1 College of\u00a0Natural Resources and\u00a0Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling\u00a0712100, China 2 State Key Laboratory of\u00a0Soil Erosion and\u00a0Dryland Farming on\u00a0the\u00a0Loess Plateau, Institute of\u00a0Soil and\u00a0Water Conservation, Northwest A&F University, Yangling\u00a0712100, China\n1 3\nthose associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including slowdowns in food imports.\nHowever, climate and population changes will influence food security and self-sufficient of food production in many countries. Since the industrial revolution, global climate has been significantly affected by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, with associated effects on the water cycle (Wu et\u00a0al., 2012; Yao et\u00a0al., 2020), river flows (Gudmundsson et\u00a0al., 2021), agricultural irrigation (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021), as well as many other ecologically, sociologically and economically important processes. As crops\u2019 growth, agricultural production is highly sensitive to climate change (Ikhuoso et\u00a0al., 2020; Ye et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2015). For example, Liu et\u00a0al. (2021) concluded that wheat yields will significantly change in at least half of the planting area in the world due to climate change, and on the North China Plain, climate change is predicted to increase wheat yields, but reduce maize yields (Xiao et\u00a0al., 2020). In West Africa, irrigated rice yields are expected to increase by about 25% due to changes in temperature and CO2 fertilization (van Oort & Zwart, 2017), and in India, climate change is predicted to increase potato production from about 24 million to 37 million tonnes between 2010 and 2030 (Scott et\u00a0al., 2019). Moreover, as the population grows, the need for food is increasing. For example, relative to 2005 levels, a 60\u2013110% increase in global food production may be needed to meet the growing demand by 2050 (Tilman et\u00a0al., 2011). Thus, there will increasing pressure on agriculture to produce enough food to meet people\u2019s needs (Khan et\u00a0al., 2020), and ensuring that their growing populations have sufficient food supplies will be highly important for all countries as the climate changes (Bowles et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, rigorous evaluation of the effects of likely climate and population changes on food supplies and security is crucial.\nAn important element of food security is per capita production of food (Funk & Brown, 2009), and to estimate this variable accurately, robust projections of crop production and population growth are required. Many methods have been applied to study effects of climate change on crop yields. These include FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments, warming experiments in OTCs (open-top chambers), statistical analyses of historical data, and use of crop models such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator), DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer), WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies), EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate), and WheatGrow (Rashid et\u00a0al., 2019; Schlenker & Lobell, 2010; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020b). Phenomena examined in FACE experiments and OTC experiments have included fertilization effects of CO2 concentrations, crops\u2019 nitrogen uptake, the effects of coelevation of CO2 and temperature (Lenka et\u00a0al., 2021; Pleijel & H\u00f6gy, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020b). Statistical models are widely applied in analyses at large temporal\nand spatial scales (Lobell & Burke, 2010). Combining crop models and statistical models, Lobell et\u00a0al. (2005) found that measured increases in wheat yield since 1980 in Mexico could be mainly attributed to climate change. Moreover, using statistical analyses, Lobell and Field (2007) estimated that increasing temperatures between 1980 and 2002 had caused a combined annual loss of global wheat, barley and maize yields of approximately 40 Mt.\nGenerally, the use of crop models in climate change research has gradually increased as they have developed. Their use is time-efficient and economical than other methods. In addition, their coupling with global climate models (GCMs) enables predictions of effects of climate change on crop yields (Feng et\u00a0al., 2019; Liu et\u00a0al., 2020b), nitrogen contribution efficiencies (Liu et\u00a0al., 2020a), suitable planting area changes (Yang et\u00a0al., 2015), and other factors. Many crop models have been used in climate change research, such as the APSIM (Bahri et\u00a0al., 2019; Saddique et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020c), DSSAT (Ngwira et\u00a0al., 2014; Phetheet et\u00a0al., 2021), WOFOST (Gilardelli et\u00a0al., 2018), EPIC (Feng & Hao, 2020; Niu et\u00a0al., 2009), and WheatGrow (Lv et\u00a0al., 2013) models. Different models have different structures, and the resulting simulations sometimes differ (Tao et\u00a0al., 2017a). Using an ensemble of crop models is an optimal way to overcome the shortcomings of different models and reflect the influence of climate change on crops (Asseng et\u00a0al., 2019; Martre et\u00a0al., 2015). For example, Ye et\u00a0al. (2020) used four crop models and four GCMs to quantify the change in total wheat production under climate change.\nFor population projections, Malthusian population growth and logistic population growth modeling are two classical approaches (Tong et\u00a0al., 2020). However, small population and abundant resources are required for Malthusian population growth, as it is assumed to have no limitation. This does not apply to logistic population growth modeling (Tong et\u00a0al., 2020), which has been applied (inter alia) to estimate population changes (Chen et\u00a0al., 2022), spread of the SARSCoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 (Almeshal et\u00a0al., 2020), and mortality rates of patients (Jaimes et\u00a0al., 2005). China has a very large population and limited resources. Thus, for country-scale population projections, logistic regression is much more suitable than Malthusian modeling.\nIn summary, research on effects of climate change on crop growth has been conducted using many methods, in many areas, and under many scenarios. However, as population increases, the demand for crop production is growing. Thus, to assist efforts to address challenges associated with climate change and population growth, determining whether crop production can meet populations\u2019 requirements and contribute to national socio-economic resilience is essential. Such research is especially crucial in the context of the COVID19 pandemic. The aim of the study presented here was to contribute to efforts to elucidate coupled effects of climate\nchange and population growth on food security, focusing on production of wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in China. Wheat is an important crop in the global grain market, and the third most highly produced crop in the world (Asseng et\u00a0al., 2011). Globally, 750 million tons of wheat was harvested in 2019 (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022), accounting for ca. 20% of the calories and proteins globally harvested (Shiferaw et\u00a0al., 2013). It is also the main food source for more than 40% of the global population (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2022). China has the largest wheat-producing area, accounting for 17.4% of total global wheat production (FAO, 2021), and had a population of 1.41 billion people in 2020 (National Bureau of Statistics of China), accounting for 18% of the global population (the largest population in the world). Thus, ensuring the food security of China is essential for robust global development and stability of global food security.\nIn this study, three crop models (APSIM, EPIC, and WheatGrow) and three GCMs (ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM11-M, and MRI-CGCM3) were used to predict potential wheat yield changes in China. In addition, population changes were predicted by logistic regression at country scale, as well as both logistic regression and unary linear regression at prefecture-level city scale. The study had three specific objectives. First, to predict potential wheat yield changes in China. Second, to determine the regional variations about the influence of climate and population changes on per capita potential production of wheat. Third, to determine whether per capita potential production will increase or decrease in the future at both country and prefecturelevel city scales. Such research is particularly important for maintaining national self-sufficiency in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, or another major disruptor of international trade (e.g. war)."

Data from 112 meteorological stations were included in this study. Moreover, as solar radiation is an essential parameter for crop models, sunshine hours were transformed into solar radiation values with the Angstrom formula (Jones, 1992). Soil data\u2013including the soil type, pH, organic carbon content, bulk density, particle size and other properties\u2013were obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database (https:// westdc. westg is. ac. cn/ data) and Soil Science Dataset (https:// vdb3. soil. csdb. cn/).

Future daily meteorological data were downscaled with inverse distanceweighted interpolation. Then NWAI-WG was used to generate daily climate data. This downscaled method and dataset, proposed by Liu and Zuo (2012), has been applied and described in detail in many studies (Ruan et\u00a0al., 2018; Wang et\u00a0al., 2015, 2019).

Population data from 2010\u20132020 was used for validation. One of the problems of logistic model is that long-term prediction error fluctuation is relatively large (Chen et\u00a0al., 2022). Therefore, the population projections were limited to 2021\u20132050. At the country scale, the logistic regression formula applied was:\nHere, X(t) denotes the population (108), and t is year (with 1980 treated as 1, 1981 as 2 and so on).\nLogistic regression is not sufficient to model population changes in the prefecture-level cities, so logistic regression and unary linear regression models were compared and used for the population projections. Data from 2000 to 2015 were used to estimate parameters, then data from 2016 to 2020 were used to validate the logistic regression and unary linear regression.

Therefore, these three GCMs were also applied in this study. The spatial resolution of ACCESS1-0, BCCCSM1-1-M, and MRI-CGCM3 are 1.875\u00b0 \u00d7 1.25\u00b0, 1.125\u00b0 \u00d7 1.12\u00b0, and 1.125\u00b0 \u00d7 1.1213\u00b0, respectively.\nHistorical and future periods were separated into four time periods: 2000\u20132010, 2020\u20132030, 2030\u20132040, and 2040\u20132050, designated baseline, 2030S, 2040S and 2050S, respectively. Two representative concentration pathways, RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways4.5) and RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways8.5), were considered. In the RCP4.5 scenario, radiative forcing reaches 4.5 W/m2, and the CO2 concentration reaches 538 ppm by 2100 with governmental efforts. In the RCP8.5 scenario, radiative forcing reaches 8.5 W/m2, and the CO2 concentration reaches 936 ppm by 2100 with no adaption to climate\n(6)X(t) = 14.26\n1 + 0.3476e\u22120.0672t\nchange (Vuuren et\u00a0al., 2011).

This is a widely used method for creating yield maps (Betzek et\u00a0al., 2019). Liu et\u00a0al. (2020b) used it to interpolate rice yields across the entire study region to generate a raster map. Yang et\u00a0al. (2013) used it to interpret spatial distribution of evapotranspiration, and Ye et\u00a0al. (2020) used it to research changes in wheat yields under 1.5 \u00b0C and 2.0 \u00b0C warming. Therefore, in this study, inverse distance weighted interpolation was applied, and Geostatistical Analyst of the ArcGIS was applied to estimate the associated errors of inverse distance weighted interpolation for cross-validation. For this, the relationship between observed and predicted values during the baseline period was calculated.\nThe yield and planting area grid resolutions in ArcGIS were 1.2 and 5 arcmin resolution, respectively. Subsequently, by coupling the potential yield and planting area data, the raster calculator in ArcGIS software was applied to obtain predicted total wheat production. Per capita potential production at country scale was predicted to estimate effects of climate and population changes on food security, using the following equation:\nHere, W is the per capita potential production (kg), ygrid,i is the value of each grid cell in the raster map of the yield (kg/ha), pgrid,i is the value of each grid cell in the raster map of the planting area (ha), n is the number of datapoints, and pop is the population.\nThe spatial variation in changes in per capita wheat production was also analyzed. Prefecture-level city scale populations during 2020\u20132050 were estimated using logistic regression and unary linear regression models. In addition, through coupling with the average total production during 2020\u20132050 under two RCP scenarios, the spatial variations in per capita wheat production in the future was calculated.

According to the random forest regression the relative importance of the considered factors for yield increased in the order TMAX > SAD > TMIN > CO2 in the LP and HH subregion, SAD > TMIN > TMAX > CO2 in the YV and SW subregion, and TMAX > TMIN > SAD > CO2 in the GX subregion."

            "text": "The results indicate that climate change will have different effects in the five studied subregions. The largest increases in total potential yield were in HH, the subregion with the largest planting area, accounting for 57.1 and 55.2% of the total production increases under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, during 2020\u20132050. This is consistent with conclusions of Ye et\u00a0al. (2020), that potential wheat yields in HH would increase by ca. 4.6 and 11.7 Mt with 1.5 and 2.0 \u00b0C warming, respectively. This clearly indicates that HH, the main wheat production area, will continue to be the most important wheat growing area and account for more wheat production than the other subregions in the future. The findings are also consistent with findings by Tao et\u00a0al. (2017b), that the wheat yield in the HH subregion benefited historically from increases in the minimum temperature.\nTo reduce the uncertainties in the results, three crop models and three GCMs were used to predict changes in the potential yield of wheat. Wang et\u00a0al. (2020a) found that the main sources of uncertainty in climate-crop modeling were crop models in China and GCMs in Australia. Coefficient of variation (CV) of the different crop models and different GCMs were calculated in this study. Using the same GCM with different crop models, the CV was 3.1%. Using the same crop model with different GCMs, the CV was 0.9%. This result was similar to the reported by Ye et\u00a0al. (2020), whose study demonstrated that wheat yields simulated under the same GCM by different crop models had a larger\nvariation than those simulated under the same crop model by different GCMs in China.\nWithout considering population growth, the annual per capita production amounts were significantly higher (p < 0.05), under both climate scenarios, than baseline levels. However, when considering population growth, the corresponding annual per capita production amounts did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level. Comparison of the changes in predicted per capita production with and without population growth indicates that the anticipated benefit of climate change for food security may be weakened by population change. However, the population change may not cause food crises, as no significant reduction in per capita production was predicted.\nPolicies of the Chinese government are intended to ensure that net carbon dioxide emissions peak by 2030 and fall to zero by 2060. Increases in soil organic carbon storage were observed in farmland soil in China during 1980\u20132000, and farmland soil may be able to absorb approximately 1.03 Pg carbon in the next 30\u201350 years (Yu et\u00a0al., 2021). Moreover, with increasing wheat yields under climate change, more carbon will be needed in the process of crop growth (Kimball & Idso, 1983; van der Kooi et\u00a0al., 2016). Thus, climate change may assist efforts to meet the target dates for peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality."

This is consistent with findings of this study, that increases in LP and HH (the cooler subregions) will be\nlarger than those in YV and SW (the warmer subregions). Ye et\u00a0al. (2020) found that the potential wheat yields in SW subregions would decrease while those in other subregions would increase under 1.5 \u00b0C and 2.0 \u00b0C warming. These\nfindings partly conflict with results of this study, which may be due to differences in the GCM models used and time periods considered. Moreover, according to Araya et\u00a0al. (2020), elevated CO2 concentrations have weaker effects on wheat yields in areas with relatively high temperatures. This may cause the increases in yield in the SW subregion to be smaller than those in other subregions (Ye et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAccording to the results of RFR (Table\u00a02), the influences of climatic variables on wheat yield had spatial differences. For the LP and HH subregions, the influence of TMAX was larger than that of SAD. For the SW and YV subregions of southern China, the influence of SAD was larger than that of TMIN. This may contribute to the differences in the solar radiation and temperature distributions in China. In southern China, sunshine duration of spring, summer, autumn, and winter were smaller than northern China (Xiong et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, in southern China, solar radiation is lower than northern China (Feng & Wang, 2021; Feng et\u00a0al., 2021). At the same time, temperature in southern China is warmer than those in northern China due to latitude. Therefore, for wheat growth in southern China, SAD is a more important limiting factor than temperature. The importance of SAD in southern China was larger than that of temperature in RFR analysis."

            "text": "A premise of this study was that the planting area would not change in the future, so in the upscaling process it was assumed that the planting area would remain the same as the area recorded during 2000\u20132010 in the future. However, previous studies indicate that suitable planting areas will change under climate change. Gao et\u00a0al. (2020) concluded that maize-wheat double-cropping systems will move toward the northeast and northwest of China in the future. In addition, Yang et\u00a0al. (2015) found that northern shifts in suitable planting areas under climate change will result in a 2.2% increase in the Chinese production of three major crops (maize, wheat and rice). Therefore, if the increase in suitable planting area is also taken into account, national wheat production will increase further.\nChanges in cultivar and sowing date can also significantly influence wheat yields. For example, Bai et\u00a0al. (2016) found that cultivar renewal improved wheat yields by 6.5\u201327.8%, and according to Sun et\u00a0al. (2018) it could increase wheat yields by 6.93, 17.69, 24.87, and 52.72% in Northern China, the Yellow and Huai River Valleys, the Middle and Lower Yangtze Valleys, and Southwestern China, respectively. Sun et\u00a0al. (2007) found that sowing delays significantly reduced winter wheat yields, by 0.5% per day. However, neither cultivar renewal nor adaptation management, both of which may be undertaken by farmers in the future, were considered in this study.\nThe other main uncertainties of this study are the population increases. Population changes are affected by many factors, especially government policy. Regression analysis provided satisfactory results for the historical data and predicted a slow increase in the Chinese population. However, prediction was limited to about 30 years. This is too short for long-term national and global policies. A more comprehensive approach, such as a machine learning method, with the ability to take the birth rate, death rate, and other factors into account would be more favorable. In addition, in this study only the national production of wheat in China was projected, and changes in production of other crops and crops in other countries were ignored. Clearly, more comprehensive evaluation of the production of major crops in both China and elsewhere is essential for rigorous determination of the relationship of food security and climate change."

Notably, the wheat production in most areas of the SW and LP subregions was too low to meet requirements of the local population, and the per capita wheat production in these subregions was lower than the Chinese average. Therefore, three types of regional food security and domestic grain trade were recognized in China. First, most areas in LP, HH, and GX subregions produced enough wheat to satisfy the local populations\u2019 food needs and excess grain to transport to other regions. Second, the SW and YV subregions produced wheat, but not enough to satisfy needs in these regions. Therefore, there was no excess grain to transport to other regions. Third, wheat was not planted in regions outside the study area, so wheat needs in them would have to be met by the grain trade.\nThere was also spatial variation in per capita wheat production under the population and climate change scenarios. It increased in some areas, mainly in northern parts of the study region, and decreased in others, mainly in southern parts. The per capita wheat production decreased in most areas of GX and LP under\n1 3\nboth RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. It also decreased in the northern part of HH. However, projected per capita wheat production in most areas of SW and YV increased, indicating that climate and population change will influence the self-sufficiency of different regions and domestic food trade. Briefly, the supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas, i.e., the first type mentioned above, but increase in the second type."

When considering population growth, the corresponding per capita potential production amounts did not significant differ (P > 0.05) from baseline levels. The projections indicate that the average per capita wheat production will decrease in the Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions, but increase in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys subregions. The results suggest that population growth will partly offset the benefits of climate change for the grain market, but there will be no food crisis due to climate change or population growth in China, although supply capacities of the main supply areas will decline. Finally, similar studies of more crops and crops in more countries are required to obtain more comprehensive evaluation of global food security under population and climate change.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12571- 023- 01351-x.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Professor Deli Liu of the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (Australia) for providing downscaled data.\nAuthor contribution Haowei Sun: conceptualization, methodology, software, formal analysis, writing \u2013original draft, visualization.
