            "text": "Standardized neuropsychological tests are sensitive to cognitive declines associated with older age and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Clinical characterization of cognitive impairments and the tracking of progressive declines requires repeated testing, but performance on repeated standardized tests is contaminated by practice effects (PE; Duff et al., 2001; Hawkins et al., 2004; Salthouse, 2010; Hoffman et al., 2011). This contamination arises due to the incidental retention of information from prior exposure to test format and content, which can enhance performance at subsequent reinstatement (Wilson et al., 2000; Heilbronner et al., 2010; Machulda et al., 2013). The potential of PE to mask true cognitive declines in healthy and pathological aging has motivated numerous attempts to remove PE from estimates of level or change in performance (Rabbitt et al., 2001; Salthouse and Tucker-Drob, 2008; Salthouse, 2010; Calamia et al., 2012). However, as a measure of the capacity to benefit from repetition, PE may represent an independent behavioral dimension sensitive to declines in older age and neurodegenerative disease (Yang, 2011; Duff et al., 2012). Thus, rather than treat PE as noise, approaches to integrate modeling of PE and cognition may provide novel clinical value in characterizing cognitive impairment and dementia.\nNotably, simulation study findings show PE are not easily distinguished from true changes associated with aging or cohort effects (Hoffman et al., 2011). Therefore, quantifying PE as the change dimension of interest may better serve short-term characterization of functional declines in MCI and dementia. This proposition is in accord with suggestions that variation in PE reflects individual differences in neurocognitive plasticity (Baltes and Raykov, 1996; Yang and Krampe, 2009; Yang, 2011). Others have reported PE as a marker of clinical declines in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (DAT; Duff et al., 2007, 2012; FernandezBallesteros et al., 2012; Sanchez-Benavides et al., 2016). Lower PE is also associated with performance decrements in\ncognitively intact adults with preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s pathology (Goldberg et al., 2015; Hassenstab et al., 2015). These findings highlight the intrinsic dependencies between the contributions of prior experience to cognitive performance and vulnerability to decline.\nVerbal learning tasks provide established clinical markers of neuropsychological deficits associated with diagnoses of MCI and DAT (Duff et al., 2001; Hawkins et al., 2004; Blasi et al., 2009; Lonie et al., 2010; Summers and Saunders, 2012). Standardized tests of verbal learning and memory typically involve serial auditory presentation of lists of verbal stimuli, immediately followed by instructions to freely recall all words remembered. Most standardized tasks then repeat this procedure for multiple trials with the same stimuli, followed by a delay and an additional free recall trial. Due to their repetitive nature, verbal learning tasks are particularly vulnerable to PE when content is repeated across longitudinal administrations (Duff et al., 2001; Heilbronner et al., 2010; Machulda et al., 2013; Campos-Magdaleno et al., 2017). Arguably, repeated free recall performance on multiple trials distributed over longitudinal occasions embodies the definition of a dynamic process \u2013 i.e., one that constantly changes and progresses (Zimprich et al., 2008). Moreover, serial recall represents retrieval-based learning, in which retrieval of a representation updates the representation itself (Karpicke et al., 2014). Furthermore, each repeated trial involves not just encoding and retrieval, but updating and retrieval monitoring, as well as potential metacognitive processes (Hertzog and Dunlosky, 2004; Bender and Raz, 2012). Thus, successful recall performance involves multiple interactive executive processes, which may also show decrements in the presence of phenotypic cognitive impairment. Yet, the extent that task summary scores reflect these dynamics is unclear.\nTo date, there is neither consistent operationalization nor definition of PE in the contexts of clinical and basic cognitive aging research. Studies report PE estimated both in variable time scales ranging from minutes to years and from a host of different behavioral tasks, conditions, and\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nstimuli. In addition, PE is largely quantified in extant studies of normative and pathological aging using difference scores or via linear modeling frameworks (Raykov et al., 2002; Salthouse et al., 2004; Duff et al., 2007; Bender et al., 2013, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2015; Hassenstab et al., 2015). However, linear modeling approaches may fail to capture the interactive, dynamic processes involved in longitudinal verbal learning task performance. Modern dynamic modeling methods that can quantify non-linear processes may provide novel markers of PE or cognitive decline. In the context of longitudinal changes in verbal recall, dynamic modeling can account for the current level of performance at each trial and occasion to help predict subsequent performance. Thus, within-occasion and longitudinal performance are modeled as interdependent processes that play out over time. Modeling performance on each verbal recall trial as an individual interactive process, manifest over multiple occasions, permits estimating PE as a change process independent of overall mean performance and trial-by-trial random effects.\nThe continuous time structural equation modeling (ctsem; Driver et al., 2017) framework applies a differential equations-based time series analysis for modeling ongoing dynamic processes, coupled with a measurement layer to delineate measurement noise from true change. While it resembles latent growth and latent change score models, ctsem permits treating time-in-study as a continuous variable, in addition to other key enhancements. Relevant to longitudinal verbal learning performance, the framework permits specifying a non-linear measurement model to account for factors such as differential measurement error across groups or levels of performance. It also allows modeling random effects to capture individual differences in all system parameters, as well as covariates that can predict such individual differences. Furthermore, these non-linear processes may also be sensitive to phenotypic cognitive impairment, possibly independent of level of performance or PE. Thus, dynamic modeling of longitudinal verbal learning data to decompose PE from trial-level performance may offer additional value for clinical aging populations previously reported to show a loss of PE.\nExtant findings show diagnoses of MCI and multi-domain amnestic dementia (DAT) are associated with reduced or non-existent PE on standardized verbal learning tasks (Duff et al., 2007, 2019; Calamia et al., 2012; Goldberg et al., 2015; Gavett et al., 2016). However, it is unclear whether differences in PE associated with MCI or dementia are also influenced by other factors known to influence verbal memory. For example, whereas older age is associated with performance decrements on episodic memory tasks, female sex is associated with better verbal episodic memory (Herlitz et al., 1997; Herlitz and Rehnman, 2008; Bender et al., 2010). Furthermore, greater educational attainment also confers a higher initial level of premorbid performance on memory tasks (Lovden et al., 2020). Still, it is unclear if such individual\ndifferences may modify the larger effects of MCI or DAT diagnosis on verbal recall or PE, particularly over less expansive periods of assessment.\nThe University of Michigan Memory and Aging Project (UM-MAP) includes older participants clinically characterized as cognitively unimpaired (CU) or diagnosed with MCI or DAT. The available data includes one to four occasions of annual neuropsychological assessment, including the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), which was administered using the same stimulus lists on each occasion of measurement. This provided an opportunity to apply ctsem for modeling longitudinal verbal recall performance and PE as dynamic processes in a clinical aging sample. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply dynamic modeling to quantify longitudinal changes in verbal learning, particularly in a clinical aging context. Critically, dynamically modeled estimates of PE in the present study served as the primary measure of longitudinal change in performance, rather than estimating change in ability and PE separately. We hypothesized that both older age and diagnosed MCI and DAT would be associated with poorer recall and lower PE. We also expected the effects of clinical diagnosis would be modified by individual differences in chronological age, sex, and educational attainment. Specifically, we hypothesized that higher education and female sex would be associated with better verbal recall; however, we had no clear expectations regarding how these would influence effects of MCI or DAT diagnosis on recall or PE."

            "text": "To analyze performance, change as a function of PE, and individual differences therein, we developed hierarchical Bayesian continuous time dynamic models (Driver et al., 2017) implemented in the ctsem software (Driver et al., 2017;Driver and Voelkle, 2021). A more detailed description of the model and corresponding mathematical apparatus follows below in the Supplementary Material.\nModeling practice effects and performance in ctsem\nTo account for varying observation timing and to allow for continuously interacting processes, ctsem estimates an underlying continuous-time model, which is translated into discrete time expectations and covariance matrices using matrix exponentiation (Voelkle et al., 2012; Voelkle and Oud, 2013). To account for the multiple timescales at play (i.e., within and between occasion), each of the immediate (i.e., Trials 1, 2, and 3) and delayed recall trials (Trial 4) were modeled as independent latent processes over four occasions of measurement, with correlated random disturbances. This means that although we may not have been able to predict every fluctuation in performance, when an unpredicted fluctuation occurs this contributes to predictions for the other trials within and (potentially) across occasion. We estimated the standard deviation and within-occasion correlations of the diffusion process, separately for each Trial (e.g., Diffusion T1). These parameters capture the extent of unpredictable random changes across measurement occasions, which are nevertheless useful for predicting performance on other trials within-occasion, or across-occasion \u2013 thus more likely representing some genuine aspect of performance. In contrast, the standard deviation of the measurement error (i.e., measurement error) captures unpredictable changes in observed performance that do not provide value for prediction on other trials. The model also contained a parameter reflecting Trial self-feedback (sf_Trial); this parameter describes the persistence of the random changes\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.org\nbetween measurement occasions for each trial. Put differently, sf_Trial represents the extent to which unpredicted shifts up or down (independent of measurement error) on performance for a specific trial, can be used to predict performance for the same trial number on the next occasion, i.e., acrossoccasion persistence. On top of this base structure allowing for correlated random processes, PE was modeled as a latent process that changed at the end of each occasion. As for the trial specific processes, we also specified a Practice selffeedback (sf_Practice) parameter to provide an estimate of total feedback on PE; this parameter serves as a measure of the decay or acceleration in the change to Practice effect process over the observed range of occasions. Like sf_Trial, the sf_Practice parameter reflects the extent that the current level of practice (i.e., at the end of each occasion) contributes to the Practice effect at the next occasion. Thus, a positive sf_Practice value would reflect an increase in gains due to practice on later occasions, whereas a negative sf_Practice value reflects a decay or deceleration of learning processes that reduce total PE and implies reducing gains due to further practice. Each model output includes estimates of population means for all modeled parameters, correlations between trial manifest means and the PE parameter, and estimates of time independent predictor effects and interactions.\nTime independent predictors and covariates Parameters of the system and measurement models also varied on an individual level as a function of clinical diagnosis, as well as random effects. The effects of other sources of individual differences were examined in separate sensitivity models to evaluate effect modification by individual linear covariates, including baseline age, sex, and educational attainment. This accounts for a broad range of phenomena, such as heterogeneity of measurement error variance with age and performance. Therefore, we first evaluated most recent clinical diagnosis of MCI or DAT as time independent predictors, in relation to CU participants. This was followed by independent subsidiary sensitivity models that evaluated covariate effects age, sex, and educational attainment (scaled and centered at the respective sample means) on model parameters and their interactions with diagnostic group. Last, independently for the three diagnostic groups we evaluated each of the time independent predictors age, sex, and education in separate models."

The plot depicts model expectations of recall performance, measured over four occasions, with each trial type (i.e., 1\u20134) depicted separately in the four panels. The y-axes represent the number of correctly recalled words on a trial, and the x-axis represents time; the dashed vertical lines depict the individual measurement occasions. The black plotted line depicts the expectation of change in the total sample, in the absence of any covariates. The level of the line on the y-axis represents the number of words recalled for a trial in the total sample and this expected value is incrementally increased before the next measurement occasion as a function of the estimated PE parameter. Starting at baseline (T0) the line is flat until just before the second occasion (T1) where PE is first relevant. The magnitude of the increase reflects PE at that occasion.

The new model estimated a parameter for Baseline performance as well as the deviations from Trial 1 for Trials 2, 3, and 4, rather than absolute performance, while otherwise maintaining the same model setup. Model results showed the population means (Supplementary Table 8) were consistent with the results from the original diagnostic groups model with one exception.

Whereas repeated performance conferred subsequent improvements in recall for unimpaired older adults, this was not consistently the case in those with diagnosed MCI; moreover, we observed ongoing decline in participants diagnosed with DAT, despite repeated testing, as evidenced by negatively estimated PE.

This modeling perspective contrasts with most prior efforts that model PE as a linear change within or between occasions (Duff et al., 2007; Bender et al., 2013, 2020; Goldberg et al., 2015; Gavett et al., 2016). In addition, the PE parameter does not delineate between true decline and gains due to practice, as these are not considered separable processes in a dynamic system. The sensitivity of dynamic estimates of PE and performance to clinical diagnosis demonstrates the value of dynamic modeling in longitudinal clinical aging data.\nSecond, the present findings revealed previously unreported relationships between clinical diagnosis and dynamic process estimates. As with PE, the sf_Practice parameter followed a gradient of positive to negative values that corresponded with diagnostic severity. Practice self-feedback provides a nonlinear measure of the extent level that practice (i.e., after\ncompleting all four trials for a given occasion) can boost or reduce estimated PE at the next occasion. The more positive estimates of sf_Practice in CU participants reflects an increase in practice-related gains on subsequent occasions. In contrast, both PE and sf_Practice were negatively estimated in participants with diagnosed dementia. Thus, while recall performance declined over time in these participants even with repeated testing (i.e., as indicated by negative PE estimates), dementia diagnosis was associated with less acceleration in decline. In other words, performance appears to stabilize at a lower level above floor in those diagnosed with dementia, despite both the absence of retest improvements and overall decline. In addition, both measurement error and diffusion processes (particularly on Trials 3 and 4), were sensitive to diagnostic group and other covariate effects. The standard\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 11 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Expectation plots for change in recall performance (black line) across four measurement occasions (e.g., T0: baseline, T1: 1 year) in the sensitivity model of participant age.

All covariate effects are in reference to 0 values of other covariates.\ndeviation of the diffusion processes reflects unpredictable variations in trial performance that are nevertheless useful in predicting performance on other trials. In tasks like the HVLT, recall performance on later immediate recall trials necessarily includes savings from the preceding recall trials. The reported findings suggest that meaningful variations in Trial 3 performance may provide a uniquely sensitive marker of clinical cognitive impairment and dementia. Although the interpretation of such unpredictable variations is not clear, one possibility is Trial 3 diffusion processes may partly reflect impaired executive or amnestic encoding abilities. For example, reduced mental flexibility and working memory in MCI and dementia may produce more inconsistent recall performance across study occasions. Alternatively, higher Trial 3 diffusion processes may capture increasing reliance on list recency due to impaired short-term verbal encoding ability. Nevertheless, multiple cognitive processes are potentially implicated, which are likely to be further complicated by diagnosis and etiology.\nTherefore, additional work relating differences in non-linear PE estimates to more fine-grained neuropsychological performance is needed to clarify the cognitive processes responsible for variations in Trial 3 diffusion or other parameter estimates.\nThird, evaluation of sensitivity and subgroup models revealed important sources of individual differences that modified multiple effects and qualified several interactions. For example, older age predicted worse mean recall on all Trials in the CU and diagnosed MCI subgroups, but better recall on trials 2 and 3 among those with dementia diagnoses (Table 6). This may suggest a survivor effect, as those who reach more advanced age before onset of dementia may maintain some residual abilities that enhance recall on these trials. Age also modified trial-specific diffusion processes for CU and MCI diagnosed participants, despite positive mean Diffusion estimates in both groups (Supplementary Tables 2, 3). Whereas older age predicted higher Diffusion on Trials 3 and 4 in the CU subgroup, the opposite effect was manifest for\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org\nthe MCI group. This shows that in unimpaired adults older age enhances the generation of unpredictable but meaningful variation in performance but exerts the opposite effect in those diagnosed with MCI.\nGreater education weakly predicted higher mean immediate recall abilities for CU and MCI. Higher educational attainment was also weakly associated with lower PE in the two subgroups with diagnoses of MCI or dementia (Table 6). Notably, estimated PE did not differ from zero in the MCI subgroup even though mean recall performance did not show a ceiling effect; furthermore, PE and recall were not significantly associated in this group. Thus, greater educational attainment in the presence of manifest cognitive impairment may predict greater loss of neurocognitive plasticity necessary to benefit from repetition. Critically, this finding should be interpreted in the context of recent reports showing education does not appear neuroprotective or to confer resilience to cognitive decline or neurodegeneration. Rather, more years of early-life education may increase premorbid level of ability and positively offset trajectories of decline (Wilson et al., 2019; Lovden et al., 2020; Nyberg et al., 2021). However, for those whose neurocognitive abilities have reached a functional threshold for impairment, higher education may be associated with accelerated declines. Here, PE appears to be a marker of such accelerated functional declines. Similarly, the advantage of female sex on tests of verbal memory (Herlitz et al., 1997; Herlitz and Rehnman, 2008; Bender et al., 2010) was largely negligible, with one notable exception. Whereas women in the MCI diagnosis subgroup\nhad better mean recall on Trial 3, this was reversed in the more impaired participants with dementia diagnoses. As with education, it is possible that this reflects a positive offset in trajectories of decline due to higher premorbid level of verbal memory abilities, resulting in steeper declines following onset of dementia.\nUnder the present dynamic modeling framework, performance on each occasion reflects ongoing processes that are inherently altered by prior testing exposure or experience. Here, PE reflects total intra-person change as the combination of maintenance or decline in addition to contributions of prior experience. Therefore, while the variable gains or losses following practice are not clearly dissociable from ongoing declines, separating level from change across trials captures multiple behavioral dimensions relevant to clinical diagnosis. For example, we note that the relationship between better recall performance and lower PE was only observed in the participants with CU or dementia diagnoses, but not in those with MCI. Unimpaired participants performing closer to ceiling had less room to improve and were more likely to show reduced subsequent gains. In contrast, the negative estimates of PE in the subgroup with dementia diagnoses captures longitudinal declines \u2013 those with higher overall performance also had the furthest to decline. However, the disconnection between PE and level of performance in MCI suggests these two dimensions may provide unique diagnostic or prognostic information. This aligns with prior findings showing PE differences are a meaningful indicator of progressive decline in older adults with\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 13 frontiersin.org\nMCI diagnoses who exhibit low-to-moderate levels of recall performance (Duff et al., 2007; Rabin et al., 2009; Hassenstab et al., 2015; Gavett et al., 2016).\nThe present findings point to greater inconsistencies in responses, across trials and occasions as additional markers of cognitive impairment and dementia. We found that mean recall performance was consistently correlated across trials in the CU and MCI subgroups, but not in those diagnosed with dementia. Furthermore, correlations among Trials for the dementia subgroup showed more variable patterns across sensitivity models. In addition to declines in PE and mean recall performance, it is possible that loss of neurocognitive plasticity may also manifest as less consistent responses. Although the models were specified to focus primarily on longitudinal practice effects, such inconsistency may reflect reduced withinoccasion improvement across trials. We also observed MCI and DAT diagnoses attenuated trial-by-trial improvements in the reparametrized model. Similarly, reduced short-term PE has previously been related to differences in clinical diagnosis, cognitive function, and brain structure (Duff et al., 2007, 2012; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2012; Bender et al., 2020). These findings support the view that dynamic estimates of PE within and across occasions provides meaningful proxies for cognitive plasticity associated with advanced age or pathology (Baltes and Raykov, 1996; Yang, 2011). Further work is needed to identify which aspects of PE provide the most sensitive behavioral markers of ongoing declines."

            "heading": "Limitations and future directions",
            "text": "The present findings provide important evidence regarding the value of dynamic modeling approaches in estimating longitudinal change in performance as a function of PE. The limitations in the present study methods and findings must be acknowledged, while also highlighting corresponding opportunities for further inquiry. The model treated clinical diagnosis as a time independent predictor, but this did not accurately represent the diagnostic variability manifest in 11% of the study sample across study occasions. Six participants with initial diagnoses of amnestic MCI converted to DAT, and an additional six participants originally characterized as CU later received diagnoses of MCI. In addition, 15 participants with baseline MCI diagnoses were characterized as CU at their most recent visit. Although the modeling approach used here did not attempt to account for such variation in diagnosis, further work is needed to evaluate dynamic modeling for more transient changes in cognitive status. One alteration from the present approach could be to model diagnosis as a time varying measure, provided sufficient variation is present. Similarly, data sampled more intensively or with more variable timing would also make better use of capacity for modeling time in ctsem. While it is possible that accounting for such variation in assessed cognitive status may affect the results,\nfuture work should examine how intra-individual variation in clinical diagnosis is manifest in HVLT recall performance and PE. Similarly, the dementia subgroup only included participants with Alzheimer\u2019s (including mixed dementia) and including participants with other forms of dementia associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, or posterior cortical atrophy may demonstrate further sensitivity of PE and dynamic performance estimates to underlying pathologies. Furthermore, the same stimulus lists were presented on each occasion in the present study; future work should compare the effects of repeated vs. non-repeated content.\nIn addition, the available data for participants with dementia diagnoses was limited to three observations, although these were distributed across the actual occasions of assessment. While most statistical methods typically focus only on observed data, prior findings show patients with moderate Alzheimer\u2019s dementia are more prone to non-response (Feng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). The HVLT is a challenging task for patients with mild to moderate dementia and patients may become quickly discouraged. The modeling of non-ignorable missingness for statistical inference is a daunting task in practice owing to its unknown nature and non-identifiable model parameters. Although challenging, additional research is needed on further implementation of methods for modeling informative missingness in the context of estimating PE in a Bayesian structural equation modeling framework.\nThe reported findings suggest that meaningful variations in Trial 3 performance may provide a uniquely sensitive marker of clinical cognitive impairment and dementia. This may show that certain trials are more important in HVLT performance and PE, which could be useful in clinical applications. More work is needed to shed light on differences in individual trials and their potential utility in clinical applications. However, this would require substantially more individual data to generate population-based normative estimates for direct comparison with individual patient cases. Similarly, for other potential applications of these methods, such as power estimation for dementia prevention trials, a larger number of normative data would help reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates (i.e., shrink confidence intervals) for such complex dynamic models. Notably, prevention trials tend to have rigorously standardized schedules of assessment, while ctsem benefits from more variable timing across assessments in order to reduce uncertainty. Thus, clinical trials may benefit from increased flexibility in timing to better leverage dynamic modeling approaches. New methods for intensive behavior sampling using smartphones provide a clear opportunity to bridge this divide, as they allow for considerably more dense measurement and greater variability in timing. Future work should evaluate dynamic models of PE in large, normative data sets from acquired with such methods.\nIn addition, the present study only evaluated HVLT task data with 12 words per recall trial; however, the use of longer lists of 15 or 16 words in other verbal learning tasks could\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 14 frontiersin.org\nconceivably modify effects where CU participants performed close to ceiling. Future work should evaluate the effect of differences in cognitive load as a function of varying lengths of study lists. Similarly, the verbal nature of the data may confound lexical fluency with memory and PE; future investigations applying dynamic modeling approaches to estimate PE in nonverbal tasks and response times.\nThe present study generated far more testable hypotheses than it directly addressed. Nevertheless, the findings reported here demonstrate the expanded potential for evaluating new measures of performance affected by aging, neurodegeneration, or clinical diagnosis afforded by modeling non-linear dynamic processes."

Moreover, applying dynamic modeling to longitudinal verbal learning data captures new behavioral dimensions reflecting intra-individual variations that are sensitive to cognitive impairment and dementia. Dynamic modeling using the ctsem framework provides a new perspective for modeling longitudinal changes in performance due to aging and dementia."
