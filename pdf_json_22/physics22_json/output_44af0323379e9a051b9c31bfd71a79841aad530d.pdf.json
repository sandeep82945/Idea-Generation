In particular, the following four reported deviations have incited great interest and if univocally proven correct they would necessitate the postulation of a New Physics (NP) sector.\n1. \ud835\udc83 \u2192 \ud835\udc84\ud835\udf49\ud835\udf42. A 3\ud835\udf0e enhancement of the charged-current transition in \ud835\udf0f vs. light leptons [1\u2013 5] with respect to the SM prediction [6\u20138] manifests in the ratios \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc37 (\u2217) = B(\ud835\udc35\u2192\ud835\udc37 (\u2217) \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf08) B (\ud835\udc35\u2192\ud835\udc37 (\u2217)\u2113\ud835\udf08) .\nThis and the next deviation constitute hints of Lepton Flavor Universality (LFU) violation in semi-leptonic \ud835\udc35-meson decays.\n2. \ud835\udc83 \u2192 \ud835\udc94\u2113\u2113. A deficit of the neutral-current transition in muons vs. electrons [9\u201313] is observed and encoded by the ratios \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3e (\u2217) = B(\ud835\udc35\u2192\ud835\udc3e (\u2217) \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07) B (\ud835\udc35\u2192\ud835\udc3e (\u2217)\ud835\udc52?\u0304?) . The SM prediction is very accurate and\nequal to 1 [14]. Including also additional deviations reported in this channel the global significance amounts to 4.3\ud835\udf0e [15].\n3. (\ud835\udc88 \u2212 2)\ud835\udf41 . The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udf07 = (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 2)\ud835\udf07/2 exhibits a longstanding deviation [16, 17] which currently stands at an overall 4.2\ud835\udf0e level [18].\n4. Cabibbo-Angle Anomaly (CAA). The values of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 extracted from \ud835\udc3e \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\u2113\ud835\udf08 decays, the ratio B(\ud835\udc3e \u2192 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08)/B(\ud835\udf0b \u2192 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf08) and CKM unitarity using the value of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 estimated by superallowed nuclear \ud835\udefd decays do not coincide. The tension amounts to 3.6\ud835\udf0e or 5.1\ud835\udf0e [19, 20] depending on the input from the nuclear \ud835\udefd decays (i.e. Ref. [21] or Ref. [22]).\nIn this proceedings, we give a brief overview of two models based on scalar mediators that establish a connection between the flavour anomalies under the same LFU violating interpretation. After presenting the setup, we give the main results of the phenomenological analysis and finally comment on the merits and drawbacks of each scenario as well as their future prospects."

The rest of the couplings are assumed to be negligible because they play no role in the fit of the anomalies, e.g. the leptoquark couplings to the first generation are set to zero because the observed deviations in \ud835\udc35-decays involve primarily the second and third generations and also due to the strong constraints on \ud835\udc60 \u2194 \ud835\udc51 transitions. It can be shown that this approximation is stable under renormalization group effects."

            "text": "We build a global likelihood \ud835\udf122 with all the relevant observables (see Table 2 and 3 in Ref. [25] and Table I in Ref. [28]) and find the best-fit point by minimizing the \ud835\udf122. For the \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udc463 model the fit prefers masses close to the current experimental bounds around 1 TeV, while for the \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udf19 the masses are larger, namely 5.5 TeV. This is due to the fact that the contributions from the two models to \ud835\udc4f \u2192 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 scale differently, since the one is a tree-level effect and the other a loop-level.\no S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 5 2\nFurthermore, in Fig. 2 we show the results of a numerical scan on the parameter space of each model. Evidently, the two models are able to address at the 1\ud835\udf0e level the discrepancies even after taking all the experimental constraints into consideration. They are among the very few models in the bibliography so far that can achieve this with less than two new particles introduced at the TeV scale. In fact, while most of the focus has been put on the \ud835\udc35-anomalies and the (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 2)\ud835\udf07, the \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udf19 model associates also the CAA with them and in that respect, it is the most minimal combined explanation. It is important to notice, that even though the scalar models are ultraviolet complete, we find that the couplings develop Landau poles at low scales, e.g. in the case of the \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udf19 around 20 TeV, and thus new degrees of freedom are expected to appear before those scales in order to regulate this effect. This is a generic issue of models trying to address the anomalies and employ rather sizeable Yukawa-type couplings 1 and may point towards a scenario of composite scalars (see e.g. Ref. [30]). Moreover, it is a non-trivial task to find a flavour symmetry rationale for the flavour textures assumed in Table 1. In the case of \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udc463, approximate \ud835\udc48 (2) flavour symmetries have been considered as a framework for accommodating the \ud835\udc35-anomalies [25]. However, the right-handed couplings required for (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 2)\ud835\udf07 are highly suppressed in this case. Most importantly, a recent analysis [27] has shown that in this case the bound of B(\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f \u2192 \ud835\udf07+\ud835\udf07\u2212) from NA62 [31] already puts the model in tension. We leave the investigation of a more encompassing and viable flavour hypothesis for future works. In the near future both models will be probed, since the LHCb and Belle-II experiments will reach a verdict on the nature of the \ud835\udc35-anomalies, while the Fermilab (\ud835\udc54\u22122)\ud835\udf07 experiment is expected to reduce further the experimental uncertainty. Regarding the CAA, experimental developments are expected in the existing precision observables used for the determination of the Cabibbo angle. Finally, among the most important model-specific signatures are for both models, sizeable effects in \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc60 mixing and \ud835\udc35 \u2192 \ud835\udc3e (\u2217) ?\u0304?\ud835\udf08; for \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udc463 the channels \ud835\udc4f \u2192 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf0f and \ud835\udc4f \u2192 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udf07; and for \ud835\udc461 + \ud835\udf19, the channel \ud835\udc4f \u2192 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc52 and various lepton-flavour violating \ud835\udf0f decays.\n1For this reason, the high-energy massless limit of the perturbativity analysis of Ref. [29] may not be a good approximation in the case where the mediator mass and the cut-off of the theory are separated by less than an order of magnitude.\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 0 5 2"
