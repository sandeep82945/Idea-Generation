Ab initio calculations are carried out to quantitatively characterize its potential energy surface as a function of the two large amplitude \u2220H1COH and \u2220H2COH dihedral angles. It is shown that the radical displays a large amplitude torsional-like motion of its CH2 group with respect to the OH group. The rotation-torsion levels computed with the help of a 4-D Hamiltonian accounting for this torsional-like motion and for the overall rotation exhibit a tunneling splitting, in agreement with recent experimental investigations, and a strong rotational dependence of this tunneling splitting on the rotational quantum number Ka due to the rotation-torsion Coriolis coupling. Based on an internal axis method approach, a fitting Hamiltonian accounting for tuneling effects and for the fine and hyperfine structure is built and applied to the fitting of the new (sub)-millimeter wave transitions measured in this work along with previously available highresolution data. 778 frequencies and wavenumbers are reproduced with an unitless standard deviation of 0.79 using 27 parameters. The N = 0 tunneling splitting, which could not be determined unambiguously in the previous high-resolution investigations, is determined based on its rotational dependence.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAlthough molecules displaying either a large amplitude motion or an unpaired electron have been the subject of numerous spectroscopic investigations, far fewer molecules displaying both features have been spectroscopically characterized. These include sodium trimer (Na3), exhibiting both a pseudorotation tunneling motion and an electron spin-pseudorotation coupling,1 the acetyl radical (CH3CO), in which the methyl group internal rotation is coupled to the fine structure,2 and the triatomic methylene (CH2) and amidogen (NH2) radicals in which an electron spin-rotation coupling takes place in addition to a large amplitude bending motion.3,4\nThe present paper deals with the hydroxymethyl radical (CH2OH) presenting both an unpaired electron and a large amplitude motion. This astrophysically relevant species has not been detected yet in the interstellar medium although its isomeric form CH3O has.\n5 The spectrum of the hydroxymethyl radical was first observed at low resolution using infrared (IR) matrix isolation spectroscopy.6,7 The assignment to the radical was confirmed by the satisfactory agreement between observed and calculated vibrational frequencies provided by an approximate valence force field. Although the hydroxymethyl radical is a short-lived, reactive species, difficult to observe in the lab, it has since been the subject of several infrared and microwave spectroscopic investigations. Its infrared spectrum was recorded, with a higher resolution than in the pioneering investigations,6,7 by Feng\na)Electronic mail: laurent.coudert@universite-paris-saclay.fr\net al.8 who observed several vibrational bands with a partially resolved rotational structure thanks to double resonant ionization detected IR spectroscopy. Nearly ten years later, a fully rotationally resolved absorption spectrum was reported by Roberts et al.9 for the symmetric CH stretch \u03bd3 fundamental band. The values of the rotational constants B and C could be determined for the ground and excited vibrational states along with an accurate band center. The first pure rotational spectrum of the radical was measured by Bermudez et al.10 who assigned nearly one hundred transitions with Ka = 0 and 1 in the millimeter wave domain and observed a tunneling splitting for the first time. In the subsequent investigation of Schuder et al.,11 tunneling and electron spinrotation splittings were observed for several rotational components of the \u03bd3 band. Since then, more than 150 new pure rotational transitions have been measured in the millimeter wave domain by Chitarra et al.12 also for Ka = 0 and 1. The high-resolution data\n10\u201312 were interpreted in terms of a slightly asymmetric top molecule with rotational levels split into several components due to the fine and hyperfine couplings and to the tunneling. The rotational dependence of the tunneling splitting was ignored and a constant tunneling splitting of about 150 MHz was assumed. For the fine and hyperfine couplings, the splittings were found to be on the order of 100 MHz.\nEarly ab initio calculations13\u201315 revealed that the hydroxymethyl radical is a non-rigid species exhibiting a complicated potential energy surface (PES) where 3 stationary points, shown in Fig. 1, were found: a C1 minimum (S), a planar local maximum (m) 300 cm\u22121 higher, and a pyramidal Cs saddle point (M) 1500 cm\n\u22121 above the minimum. The subsequent ab initio calculations of\n2 Schuder et al.11 were consistent with a large amplitude motion of the radical that can be pictured as an internal rotation of the CH2 group, exchanging its two hydrogen atoms and hindered by a two-fold symmetry potential. In this paper, the rotation-tunneling energy levels of the CH2OH radical are investigated and its highresolution spectrum is analyzed. New transitions measured in the (sub-)millimeter wave domain are reported which, compared to the previous millimeter-wave measurement,10,12 extend the frequency and Ka-value ranges and include the astrophysically relevant 110 \u2190 101 cold transition. Starting from an ab initio PES, the radical energy level diagram is first quantitatively described using a 4-D model in which the large amplitude torsional motion and the overall rotation of the molecule are treated simultaneously; the torsional motion and the hindering potential being determined from the ab initio\nPES. This preliminary calculation allowed us to assign the appropriate symmetry label to the rotation-tunneling levels and revealed that a strong rotational dependence of the tunneling splitting takes place.16 Using then an internal axis method (IAM) formalism,17,18 a fitting approach is build which accounts for the effects of the large amplitude motion and for the fine and hyperfine couplings. With this approach, a line position analysis of the already available10\u201312 microwave and infrared data and of the newly measured sub-millimeter wave transitions is carried out. A total of 778 transitions are reproduced with a unitless deviation of 0.79 using 27 parameters. These include the magnitude of the tunneling splitting which could be determined unambiguously exploiting its rotational dependence. The paper has four remaining sections. In Section II, the experimental setup used for the new measurements is described. In Section III, a qualitative description of the two-dimensional PES of the radical is given and rotationtunneling energies are deduced. The fitting approach is described in Section IV and the analysis results are given in Section V. Section VI is the discussion."

            "text": "In this work, the CH2OH radical was synthesized from methanol using an H abstraction technique where F atoms, produced by a microwave discharge, are injected into a reaction cell where they collide with the precursor.19 To record new pure rotational transitions of the radical, we used an upgraded version of the absorption experimental set-up described in Chitarra et al.12 The upgrade consists in three points: i) multiple injections of F atoms along the cell for increased radical production; ii) longer absorption path length by implementing double-pass; and iii) a fast identification of transitions belonging to open-shell species thanks to Zeeman modulation. The main aspects of the set-up and data acquisition are described in the following and a detailed description will be presented in a subsequent paper.\nFigure 1. Geometry of the stationary points displayed by the hydroxymethyl radical potential energy surface. The two methylenic hydrogen atoms, H1 and H2, are labeled 1 and 2, respectively. For the geometries in the left column, the COH atoms are contained in the figure plane. For the geometries in the middle column, the CO bond is perpendicular to this plane. The letters M, m, and S are shorthand notations for the stationary points.\nF atoms are produced by a 100 W microwave discharge in an F2/He mixture (5 % dilution) and injected into the reaction cell through three separate inlets distant by 30 cm. The reaction cell is a 2 m long Pyrex cell covered by a fluorinated wax to limit surface reactions and equipped with a Teflon window on one end. The optimization of CH2OH signal led to partial pressures of about 5 \u00b5bar of methanol and 25 \u00b5bar of F2/He. The (sub-)millimeter radiation is generated by a radiofrequency synthesizer (Rhodes & Schwarz), referenced to a Rubidium atomic clock, feeding a solid-state frequency multiplication chain (Virginia Diode Inc., VDI). It allows for a broad tunability, covering here the 140\u2013 900 GHz spectral range. A wire grid polarizer (5 \u00b5m diameter and 22 \u00b5m spacing wires, PureWavePolarizers Ltd.) and a roof-top mirror allow for a double pass of the collimated radiation into the absorption cell; an off-axis parabolic mirror focuses the output radiation onto the detector. Between 140 and 330 GHz, we used Schottky diode detectors (VDI) and, at higher frequencies, a liquid Helium cooled InSb hot electron bolometer detector (Infrared Labs) operating at 4 K. For all recordings, the frequency modulation of the (sub-)millimeter radiation was set to 48.157 kHz. Because of increasing values of the Doppler linewidths with increasing frequencies, both the modulation depth and frequency steps were adjusted based on the spectral range; they were set to values ranging from 500 to 1800 kHz and from 50 to 200 kHz, respectively. Relatively long acquisitions were required to achieve reasonable signal-to-noise ratio on CH2OH lines, typically from 4 to 16 s per frequency point. To perform Zeeman modulation, an alternating current\n3\n(at a 71 Hz frequency) circulates through an 800-spires coil, wrapped along approximately 1.3 m of the reaction cell length, resulting in an alternating magnetic field of \u223c 20 Gauss. The alternating current is generated by a waveform generator followed by an audio amplifier (Analogue Associated) and a diode. As evidenced by Fig. 2, the double modulation scheme essentially acts as a filter for both close-shell species contribution and baseline effect.\nTwo lock-in amplifiers (Ametek and Stanford Research), connected in series, perform the signal recovery. The first lock-in demodulates the signal at the second harmonic of the source frequency modulation while the second one demodulates the source-frequencydemodulated signal at the magnetic field modulation frequency. Both signals are retrieved by the acquisition computer.\nUsing this set-up, 464 pure rotational transitions of CH2OH have been measured with a line position accuracy ranging from 30 to 800 kHz. It should be stressed that the magnetic field modulation is key to the assignments carried out in this work. It allows us to discriminate the weak CH2OH lines from the numerous strong transitions of the precursor and of the reaction products, mainly H2CO."

            "text": "Ab initio calculations are carried out and show that the large amplitude torsional motions can be parameterized in terms of a single large amplitude angular-type coordinate. The corresponding hindering potential is also retrieved from these ab initio calculations. These results are used to compute rotation-torsion energy levels with the help of a 4-D model accounting for the large amplitude motion and the overall rotation. The spin of the unpaired electron is ignored in this preliminary energy levels calculation. In non-rigid molecules displaying internal rotation of a methyl group, the torsional motion can be pictured as a rigid methyl group undergoing internal rotation with respect to a rigid frame; the axis of internal rotation remaining parallel to the three fold symmetry axis of the methyl group and fixed with respect to this frame. Such a description is appropriate for methanol,20 which is a benchmark molecule for hindered rotation, but not for the CH2OH radical because its OCH2 group does not remain rigid during the large amplitude motion. As emphasized by the previous11,13\u201315 and present ab initio calculations, the geometry of this group changes and the line bisecting the HCH bond angle, which might be taken as the axis of internal rotation, does not remain parallel to the CO bond."

            "text": "Using the Gaussian 16 package,21 a two-dimensional ab initio PES was calculated in the two angles \u03be1 = \u2220H1COH and \u03be2 = \u2220H2COH, where the two dihedral angles are defined with the atom labeling of Fig. 1. The \u03c9B97X-D/cc-pVTZ level of theory was chosen and the remaining 7 internal coordinates were optimized. The two-dimensional surface was calculated for \u03be1 and \u03be2 such that \u03be1\u2212 \u03be2 \u2212 \u03c0 mod 2\u03c0 is in the range \u221240 to +40\u25e6 allowing us to explore energy values below 5000 cm\u22121. A contour plot of the surface is shown in Fig. 3 where the contours span energy values ranging from 0 to 1900 cm\u22121 only. The stationary points, described in the previous ab initio calculations11,13\u201315 and shown in Fig. 1, are indicated in Fig. 3. The lines of steepest descent, also shown in this figure, connect these stationary points. Along the line of steepest descent, \u03be1 and \u03be2 are expressed in terms of two functions \u03bes1(\u03b7) and \u03be s 2(\u03b7), depending on the variable \u03b7, such that the derivative vector with components \u03bes1 \u2032(\u03b7) and \u03bes2 \u2032(\u03b7) is parallel to the gradient of the potential energy function. Figure 3 emphasizes that following the line of steepest descent allows us to reach the non-equilibrium configurations of the radical that are important for the tunneling energy level calculation. This suggests that the harmonic approximation22\u201324 should be made and that the 9 internal coordinates of the radical should be replaced by the single angular-type large amplitude coordinate \u03b7 and 8\n4\nsmall amplitude coordinates. The coordinate \u03b7 is taken such that 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 2\u03c0. Symmetry considerations allow us to express \u03bes1(\u03b7) and \u03be s 2(\u03b7) in the following way:\n{\n\u03bes1(\u03b7) = \u03b7 + f(\u03b7), \u03bes2(\u03b7) = \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 f(\u03b7), (1)\nwhere f(\u03b7) is an odd function of \u03b7 with 2\u03c0 periodicity fulfilling f(\u03c0\u2212\u03b7) = f(\u03b7). Equations (1) allow us to write \u03b7 and f(\u03b7) as:\n{\n\u03b7 = [\u03bes1(\u03b7) + \u03be s 2(\u03b7) + \u03c0]/2, f(\u03b7) = [\u03bes1(\u03b7)\u2212 \u03bes2(\u03b7)\u2212 \u03c0]/2. (2)\nIn the case of a C2v rigid OCH2 group rotating about its CO bond, the relation \u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 \u2212 \u03c0 = 0 would hold, the function f(\u03b7) would be zero, and \u03b7 would be the angle of internal rotation of the CH2 group with respect to the hydroxyl group. The second of Eqs. (2) implies that f(\u03b7) is a measure of how much the OCH2 group departs from C2v symmetry. There is no analytical expression for f(\u03b7) which was retrieved from the ab initio calculations and its variations are depicted in Fig. S1, available in the supplementary material. As emphasized by this figure, f(\u03b7) displays strong variations near stationary point m corresponding to \u03b7 = 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0. Table I compares \u03b7, \u03be1, \u03be2 values and energies for the stationary points found in the previous11,13\u201315 and present ab initio calculations. For stationary point S, the smallest value of \u03b7 was found in this work. For stationary point m, the energy value retrieved in this work is in between those reported in the\nearly investigations13\u201315 and equal to that found more recently.11 For stationary point M, the energy obtained in this work is higher than those previously reported and the closest to that of Schuder et al.11"

For the r(CH1) and r(CH2) bond lengths, equations similar to Eqs. (3) arise. Finally, for both the r(CO) and r(OH) bond lengths, an equation similar to Eq. (4) can be used. The parameterization in Eqs. (1), (3), and (4) ensures that hydrogen atoms H1 and H2 are equivalent. The transformation \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u00b1\u03c0 interchanges the two hydrogen\n5 atoms as it leads to \u03be1 \u2194 \u03be2, \u2220H1CO \u2194 \u2220H2CO, and r(CH1) \u2194 r(CH2). The parameterization in Eqs. (1), (3), and (4) also ensures that molecular configurations characterized by \u03b7 and 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 are mirror images from each other. The expansion parameters in Eqs. (3) and (4) were fitted to the present ab initio results and are their values reported in Table S1 available in the supplementary material. The hindering potential V (\u03b7) was computed as the electronic energy retrieved in Section IIIA plus the zeropoint energy arising from the small amplitude modes. In addition to the contribution from the 7 modes corresponding to the three bond angles and four bond lengths, the contribution from \u03bd8, a mode corresponding to small variations \u03b4\u03be1 and \u03b4\u03be2 of the two dihedral angles, was\nalso taken into account. Describing \u03bd8 with the small amplitude coordinate \u03b4q8, the small variations of the two dihedral angles are then:\n{\n\u03b4\u03be1 = \u2212[1\u2212 f \u2032(\u03b7)]\u03b4q8, \u03b4\u03be2 = +[1 + f \u2032(\u03b7)]\u03b4q8. (5)\nThis equation ensures that the \u03bd8 mode is not redundant with that corresponding to small variations of \u03b7. Figure 4 depicts the variations of the hindering potential V (\u03b7). It displays two barriers at \u03b7 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2 characterized by a height of 1600 cm\u22121 and corresponding to stationary point M. At \u03b7 = 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0, there arise three local maxima corresponding to stationary point m with a barrier height of 60 cm\u22121. Near these local maxima, strong variations of the hindering potential are observed. The hindering potential V (\u03b7) retrieved in this work is quantitatively close to that of Schuder et al.11 plotted in their\nFig. 9. When comparing the two figures, it should be kept in mind that the relation \u03c6COH = \u03b7 + \u03c0/2 holds between the large amplitude coordinate used by these authors and that used in this work."

The G4 symmetry operation (12) has no effect on the torsional function \u03c6ANk,vt(\u03b7), but changes \u03c6BNk,vt(\u03b7) into its negative value because of the ei\u03c0 factor arising from the free internal rotation function. When using the results of Lauvergnat et al.,25 the next step is setting up the matrix of the rotation-torsion Hamiltonian. This requires evaluating torsional matrix elements of the potential energy function and of the generalized inverse inertia tensor components. For the potential energy function and for components which are an even function of \u03b7, Eq. (19) of Lauvergnat et al.25 can be used. For components which are an odd function of \u03b7, Eq. (24) of the same authors can be used. In these equations, the function F (\u03b1) should be replaced by F (\u03b7) displaying \u03c0-periodicity because of the higher symmetry of the CH2OH internal rotation problem compared to that of CH2DOH. As a result, the coefficients gp in Eqs. (19) and (25) of Lauvergnat et al.25 vanish when p is odd. Spinless rotation-torsion energies were calculated using the parameterization of the internal coordinates and the expansion potential retrieved in Section III B. Since the potential energy function displays two energetically equivalent minima, the calculation should lead to pairs of close lying levels split by the tunneling splitting. Calculated energies are listed up to N = 3 in Table III where rotation-torsion levels are labeled using the usual rotational quantum numbers NKaKc, the torsional quantum number vt \u2265 0, and their rotation-torsion G4 symmetry\nspecies. For N = 0 the maximum value of vt is 3 and there arise two pairs of levels separated by a vibrational energy of 6.029 THz (201 cm\u22121). For the lower and upper pairs, consisting of the vt = 0 and 1; and of the vt = 2 and 3 levels, respectively, the tunneling splittings are 88 and 974 MHz. The splitting found for the lower pair is about half that calculated by Schuder et al.,11 listed in their\nTable VII. For the vibrational energy, the value obtained in this work is closer to that of Marenich and Boggs,14,15 281 cm\u22121, than to that of Schuder et al.,11 329 cm\u22121. For N > 0, Table III only reports the vt = 0 and 1 lower pair of levels. A strong rotational dependence of the tunneling splitting with the rotational quantum number Ka can be seen. For Ka = 0, the tunneling splitting remains close to 88 MHz, with the vt = 0 sublevel below vt = 1. For Ka = 1, the tunneling splitting decreases down to 57 MHz, with the vt = 1 sublevel now below vt = 0. For Ka = 2, the tunneling sublevels are still inverted and the tunneling splitting is only 18 MHz. It should be pointed out that vt values are assigned to tunneling sublevels using symmetry considerations compatible with those in Section IVA. The way vt is defined differs from the way it is defined in the previous investigations10\u201312 where vt = 0 (1) is the lower (upper) tunneling sublevel. Figure 5 shows the variations with the large amplitude coordinate \u03b7 of the torsional functions for N = 0 and 0 \u2264 vt \u2264 3. The results in this figure and Table III emphasize that the CH2OH radical is well described in the high barrier limit. The torsional functions are consistent with tunneling through the potential barriers at \u03b7 = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2. The vt = 0 and 1 functions are respectively the sum and the difference of two functions localized at \u03b7 = 0 and \u03c0. This also applies for the the vt = 2 and 3 functions except that the localized functions display a node. The small potential barriers at \u03b7 = 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0 have little effects on the torsional functions since even the vt = 0 function, which should be the most affected by these small barriers, still displays a maximum for these values of \u03b7."

(1)\u2013(6) of this reference, the large amplitude coordinate \u03b3 should be replaced by \u03b7 and the small amplitude vibrational modes should be ignored. The vibrational reference functions defined in Eq. (2) of Coudert and Perrin27 will be written \u03c8n(\u03b7), with n = 1 and 2, and correspond to the two reference configura-\ntions depicted in Fig. 6 of the present paper. Although the S minimum of the two-dimensional PES has C1 symmetry, these reference configurations are assumed planar because the vt = 0 and 1 torsional levels have energies much higher than that of the local maximum m, as emphasized by Fig. 4. Also, as confirmed by Fig. 5, their torsional function is well centered around \u03b7 = 0, \u03c0, and 2\u03c0. Consequently, the vibrational wavefunction \u03c81(\u03b7) is taken even and localized about \u03b7 = 0. \u03c82(\u03b7) = \u03c81(\u03b7+\u03c0) is localized about \u03b7 = \u03c0. The actual form of these two vibrational wavefunctions is not important, but their symmetry transformation is.17,18 In agreement with Eq. (6) of Coudert and Perrin,27 these vibrational wavefunctions allow us to write the reference basis wavefunctions as:\n\u03a8NK\u03b1n = \u03c8n(\u03b7) \u00b7 |NK\u03b1\u3009, (8)\nwhere n = 1 and 2; and |NK\u03b1\u3009, with 0 \u2264 K \u2264 N and \u03b1 = \u00b11, are the Wang-type rotational wavefunctions defined in Eq. (1) of Coudert and Hougen.30 They belong to the Cs symmetry species A\n\u2032 and A\u2032\u2032 for \u03b1(\u22121)N+K = +1 and \u22121, respectively. The main results of the IAM approach17,18 are the tunneling matrix elements given in Eqs. (9) and (10) of Coudert and Perrin.27 They involve two Eulerian-type angles \u03b82 and \u03c62 describing the rotational dependence of the tunneling splitting. The tunneling matrix elements were derived adding the contribution of the two equivalent paths connecting reference Configurations 1 and 2. Between two reference basis wavefunctions of Eq. (8), the tunneling matrix elements assume the following expression:\nHNK\u2032\u03b1\u2032 1;NK\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032 2 = 2h2 (\u22121)K \u2032\n\u00d7 [cos(Kp\u03c62) d(N)(\u03b82)K\u2032,K\u2032\u2032 + \u03b1\u2032\u2032 cos(Km\u03c62) d (N)(\u03b82)K\u2032,\u2212K\u2032\u2032 ],\n(9)\nif both rotational wavefunctions belong to the same Cs symmetry species, and:\nHNK\u2032\u03b1\u2032 1;NK\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032 2 = 0, (10)\nif the two rotational wavefunctions belong to different Cs symmetry species. In Eq. (9), h2 is a constant corresponding to the tunneling splitting; Kp = K \u2032 +K \u2032\u2032 and Km = K \u2032 \u2212K \u2032\u2032; and d(N)(\u03b8)K,M is defined in Eq. (15.8) of Wigner.31 If either K \u2032 or K \u2032\u2032 is equal to zero, but not both, the term on the right of Eq. (9) must be divided by\u221a 2; if bothK \u2032 andK \u2032\u2032 are equal to zero, a division by 2 is required. Tunneling-rotation energy levels are obtained using the following27 symmetry-adapted linear combinations of the reference basis wavefunctions in Eq. (8):\n\u03a8vtNK\u03b1 = (\u03a8NK\u03b1 1 \u00b1\u03a8NK\u03b12)/ \u221a 2, (11)\nwhere vt = 0 and 1 for the upper and lower sign, respectively. When the rotational symmetry species is A\u2032 (A\u2032\u2032), the linear combination \u03a8vtNK\u03b1 belongs to the symmetry species A1 (A2) and B2 (B1) when vt = 0 and 1, respectively. The symmetry-adapted linear combinations\n8 of Eq. (11) allow us to block diagonalize the rotationtorsion Hamiltonian into four submatrices corresponding to the G4 symmetry species. For a given submatrix, we have the following matrix elements:\n\u3008\u03a8vtNK\u2032\u03b1\u2032 |Hr-t|\u03a8vtNK\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032\u3009 = \u3008NK \u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032|Hr|NK \u2032\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032\u3009 \u00b1HNK\u2032\u03b1\u2032 1;NK\u2032\u2032\u03b1\u2032\u2032 2,\n(12)\nwhere vt = 0 and 1 for the upper and lower sign, respectively; and Hr is the rotational Hamiltonian of either reference configurations written using the Ir representation.\nThe values of the angles \u03b82 and \u03c62 could be determined solving numerically Eqs. (49) of Hougen.17 However, they were obtained here fitting the rotation-torsion energies computed in Section III C with the present rotationtunneling approach. The analysis yielded \u03b82 = 2.1261\n\u25e6, \u03c62 = 205.18\n\u25e6, h2 = \u221224 MHz, A = 194 GHz, B = 29.8 GHz, and C = 27.1 GHz. It can be seen that 4|h2| is the N = 0 tunneling splitting. The small value of \u03b82 is consistent with the slow variation of the tunneling splitting with the rotational quantum number N . Conversely, the large value of \u03c62 is consistent with the strong variation of the tunneling splitting with the rotational quantum number Ka. The smallness of \u03b82 suggests that it should be set equal to zero in Eqs. (9) and (10) in order to approximate the expression of the tunneling-rotation energy Er-t(NKaKc, vt). This yields:\nEr-t(NKaKc, vt) =\nEr(NKaKc)\u00b1 2h2(\u22121)Ka cos 2Ka\u03c62, (13)\nwhere vt = 0 and 1 for the upper and lower sign, respectively; and Er(NKaKc) is the asymmetric top rotational energy. With this approximate expression, tunneling effects depend mainly on the rotational quantum number Ka. Since, as can be inferred from the symmetry species in Table III, the selection rule \u2206vt = 0 holds for \u2206Ka = 0 parallel a-type transitions, Eq. (13) means that their line position does not depend on h2. For \u2206Ka = 1 perpendicular b-type transitions, the selection rule \u2206vt = 0 also holds. As can be gathered from Eq. (13), the contribution from the tunneling splitting for such transitions will be:\n\u00b12h2(\u22121)K \u2032 a [cos 2K \u2032a\u03c62 + cos 2K \u2032\u2032 a\u03c62]. (14)\nSince \u03c62 is different from \u03c0/2, this equation means that the tunneling parameter h2 can be determined from the line position of perpendicular b-type transitions.\nIn order to account for distortion effects, the rotational Hamiltonian Hr in Eq. (12) is rewritten adding Watson\u2019s S-set of distortion parameters. Distortion terms are also added to the tunneling using, as in Christen et al.32 and Margule\u0300s et al.,33 a rotational operator D with matrix elements given by Eqs. (9) and (10) where h2 is set to 1. With this operator, the tunneling matrix element in\nFigure 6. The two planar reference configurations to be used with the IAM approach17,18 are drawn.

In this case, for symmetry reasons, we need only evaluate the matrix elements arising from Hshfs between rotationtorsion-spin levels characterized by the same value of vt. As shown by Eq.

A more accurate computation\nof the hyperfine energies could be carried out considering hyperfine wavefunctions with I = 0 and 1.

This triplet-singlet coupling depends on the value of the tunneling splitting and should be observed for rotation-spin levels with a small tunneling splitting. It should be kept in mind that the total rotation-torsionspin-hyperfine wavefunction should belong to the B1 or B2 symmetry species of G4 so as to obey the Pauli exclusion principle."

Transitions were given a weight equal to the inverse of their experimental uncertainty squared. For the infrared combination differences, an experimental uncertainty of 0.001 cm\u22121 was assumed. For the (sub-)millimeter wave transitions, symmetric hyperfine effects were considered in the calculation in addition to the tunneling and fine coupling effects. Unresolved multiplets consisting of several hyperfine components were treated as only one data point with a calculated frequency equal to the average value of the components frequency. For the infrared combination differences and for (sub-)millimeter wave transitions with an unresolved hyperfine pattern, hyperfine effects were ignored. The unitless standard deviation of the analysis is 0.79 varying 27 parameters. Table IV summarizes the analysis results for each data set.

Table V lists the 50 lowest frequency\n10\nand the 50 highest frequency newly measured transitions sorted with increasing frequency.

For the fitted tunneling parameters h2 and \u03c62, the values in Table VI are respectively less than twice and within 0.2\u25e6 from to those retrieved in Section IVA. For the tunneling parameter, the agreement is unexpectedly good since the value retrieved in Section IVA is based on low level ab initio calculations. A comparison between Table VI and Table 1 of Chitarra et al.12 shows that the rotational constant reported for vt = 0 by these authors are within 2 MHz from those determined in this work. For the electron spin-rotation constants, the agreement is even better since they differ by less than 1 MHz. For the same constants, there is also a convincing agreement with the values in Table V of Schuder et al.11 In order to compare the hyperfine coupling constants determined in this work with those reported by Chitarra et al.,12 it should be kept in mind\nthat they are not labeled in the same way. The hyperfine coupling constants of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom H are labeled aF , Tzz, Txx, and Txz in the present investigation and respectively aF (H1), Taa(H1), Tbb(H1), and Tab(H1) in Chitarra et al.\n12 Similarly the symmetric hyperfine coupling constants asF , T s zz, T s xx, and T s xz in the present investigation correspond respectively to aF (H), Taa(H), Tbb(H), and Tab(H) in Chitarra et al.\n12 For the hyperfine coupling constants varied by these authors, the agreement with the value obtained in the present investigation is satisfactory. More precisely, the values reported by Chitarra et al.12 for Txx, a s F , T s zz, and T s xx are within 0.5 MHz from those in Table VI. For the hyperfine coupling constants, not varied by Chitarra et al.,12 which were constrained to the ab initio values of Bermudez et al.,10 the agreement is much less satisfactory. For aF and Tzz, the hyperfine coupling constants obtained in this work are about 50% smaller than those of Chitarra et al.,12 for Txz, the values are opposite from each other, and T sxz was set to zero in the present analysis.

            "text": "This paper aims at accounting for the spectroscopy of the CH2OH radical which is among the few molecules displaying both a large amplitude motion and an unpaired electron studied so far under high-resolution. Starting from a two-dimensional PES depending on the two large amplitude dihedral angles \u2220H1COH and \u2220H2COH, it is found in Sections III A and III B that the non-equilbrium configurations of the radical can be described in terms of a large amplitude torsional-like motion. The hindering potential, retrieved in Section III B, displays \u03c0-periodicity, four minima corresponding to four C1 configurations, and barriers with a height of 1600 cm\u22121 at the pyramidal Cs configurations. In agreement with Schuder et al.,11 local maxima corresponding to small barriers with a height of 60 cm\u22121 are also found at the planar configurations. The spinless energy levels calculated in Section III C with this hindering potential display a torsional splitting of about 90 MHz for N = 0. This emphasizes that the high barrier limit is appropriate to describe the torsional motion of the CH2OH radical. For N > 0, a strong rotational dependence of the torsional splitting is found. The approach developed in Section IV is among the few approaches allowing us to treat a large amplitude motion in an open-shell molecule displaying electron spinrotation coupling. It is an effective approach to be used when the large amplitude motion is an internal rotation hindered by a two-fold symmetry potential. Provided the molecule is well described in the high barrier limit, the results derived in Section IV and given in Eq. (9) emphasize that tunneling effects can be accounted for using three parameters only; one of them corresponding to the\n11\n12\nmagnitude of the tunneling splitting for N = 0 and the remaining two describing its rotational dependence.\nThe main results of this investigation are presented in Section V where a line position analysis of a large body of high-resolution spectroscopic data is carried out. The data set includes previously measured millimeter wave transitions,10,12 infrared combination differences,11 and new sub-millimeter wave transitions measured in this work and presented in Section II. The unitless standard deviation of the analysis is 0.79 varying 27 parameters.\nThe value of the tunneling splitting is an important issue. In the previous millimeter wave investigations,10,12 where only transitions with Ka = 0 and 1 were fitted, it was assumed that the tunneling splitting is constant and that the selection rules for the tunneling components are \u2206vt = 1 in agreement with the way vt is defined in these investigations. In order to analyze their data, Bermudez et al.10 were led to use the same A rotational constant for both tunneling components and different B and C rotational constants for each tunneling components. The value retrieved by the authors for the tunneling splitting was 139 MHz. In their subsequent analysis of a larger data set, Chitarra et al.12 were led to use two sets of rotational constants, one for each tunneling components. The value they retrieved for the tunneling splitting was 20 MHz larger than that of Bermudez et al.10 For the limited data set considered in both analyses, the actual contribution from the A rotational constant and the tunneling is A \u2213 2h2[cos 2\u03c62 + 1] for Ka = 1 \u2190 0 b-type transitions as given by Eq. (14). This shows that\nthe contribution from the A rotational constant and the tunneling cannot be discriminated for the limited data set considered in the previous millimeter wave investigations. In the present analysis, in agreement with the symmetry species for the reference basis wavefunctions given in Eq. (11), the selection rules for the tunneling components are \u2206vt = 0. Also since the fitted transitions involve Ka values ranging from 0 to 2, we are able to discriminate the contribution from the A rotational constant and the tunneling. As evidenced by Table VI, only one set of rotational constants is used and this is because the developed fitting approach accurately models the rotational dependence of the tunneling splitting. It should be stressed that the tunneling splittings reported by Bermudez et al.,10 Schuder et al.,11 and Chitarra et al.12 are smaller than the N = 0 value derived in this work, which is 4|h2| = 170.4 MHz. Due to the improved experimental setup used in this work, the present re-investigation of the pure rotational spectrum of the CH2OH radical allowed us to measure at last several transitions expected to be intense under cold interstellar conditions. Three out the four components of the 110 \u2190 101 transition, not detected in the previous investigations,10,12 where thus reported in this work. As shown in Fig. 8, despite a very noisy signal due to the weakness of this transition at room temperature, unambiguous assignments and satisfactory modeling are possible. These new data, combined with the measurements published in Chitarra et al.,12 should allow for a confident search of the radical in cold to warm environment of the interstellar medium.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSee supplementary material for a figure showing the variations of the function f(\u03b7) introduced in Section III A and for two tables.
