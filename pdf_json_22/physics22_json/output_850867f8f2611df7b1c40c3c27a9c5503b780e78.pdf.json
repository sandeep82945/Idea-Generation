    "abstractText": "Nonisothermal liquid sloshing in partially filled reservoirs can significantly enhance heat and mass transfer between liquid and ullage gasses. This can result in large temperature and pressure fluctuations, producing thrust oscillations in spacecraft and challenging thermal management control systems. This work presents an experimental characterization of the thermodynamic evolution of a cylindrical reservoir undergoing sloshing-induced thermal de-stratification. We use a 0D model-based inverse method to retrieve the heat and mass transfer coefficients in planar and swirl sloshing conditions from the temperature and pressure measurements in the liquid and the ullage gas. The experiments were carried out in the SHAKESPEARE shaking table of the von Karman Institute in a cuboid quartz cell with a cylindrical cut-out of 80 mm diameter in the centre, filled up to 60mm with the cryogenic replacement fluid HFE-7200. A thermal stratification with \u2206T \u201c 25 K difference between the ullage gas and liquid was set as the initial conditions. A pressure drop of 90% in the ullage gas was documented in swirling conditions. Despite its simplicity, the model could predict the system\u2019s thermodynamic evolution once the proper transfer coefficients were derived.",

            "text": "Cryogenic fuels such as LH2, LCH4 and LNG are gaseous in ambient conditions but must often be transported and stored in the liquid state to have cost-competitive volumetric energy densities [1]. This requires challenging cryogenic conditions, especially for hydrogen, which can only exist as a liquid (LH2) under 33 K. While these fuels are already employed in aerospace propulsion [2], significant technological advances are still required to make them economically viable for other applications on a global scale [3, 4, 5].\nThe efficient storage of cryogenic liquids requires complex thermal management systems. Since no insulating system can entirely prevent heat exchange with the surrounding [6], it is impossible to prevent some of the fuel from boiling off and thus the tank pressure from rising over time [7, 8, 9]. The simplest way to control the tank pressure is venting, but this brings a high cost of energy and mass loss. Additional liquefaction steps can be used to recover the vented fuel, but this further increase the operational costs.\nThermal losses increase significantly in fuel tanks installed on vehicles, whether these travel on sea, land, air, or space because external accelerations induce sloshing. Besides challenging the vehicle\u2019s stability and manoeuvrability [10], sloshing can significantly increase heat and mass transfer rate between liquid and ullage gasses, leading to significant variations of the tank\u2019s pressure [11, 12, 13].\n\u02daCorresponding author. E-mail address: pedro.marques@vki.ac.be\nIn typical operating conditions, the ullage gasses tend to be warmer than the liquid. This is due to the pressurization, typically up to 2 \u00b4 12 bar [1, 14], and the heat fluxes with the environment [15, 16]. As a result, thermal stratification is produced in the tank if this is left in quiescent conditions. Sloshing produces a thermal mixing that can level the stratification and suddenly reduce the temperature at the gas-liquid interface [17]. Since the interface naturally sets the saturation condition of the tank, a decrease in its temperature produces a decrease in the saturation pressure, hence condensation [18]. This is known in the literature as the \u2018pressure drop effect\u2019 [17, 19].\nThe opposite mechanism can also occur when heat exchange across the wall increases the interface temperature near the contact line and thus enhances evaporation [20], increasing the tank\u2019s pressure [21]. The pressure fluctuations due to sloshinginduced evaporation or condensation can produce thrust oscillation in a spacecraft and force thermal management systems to react with venting or re-pressurization; both operations bring a cost that must be minimized.\nThe literature on the sloshing phenomenon is abundant and has been significantly fostered by the aerospace industry during the 1960s [22, 23, 24]. These works focused on the (isothermal) wave dynamics and the damping rates of several fluids under many excitation conditions and tank shapes. More recently, the interest in the pressure drop effect has shifted towards characterizing the non-isothermal consequences of sloshing [11, 17, 18, 21, 25, 26, 27]. These works have focused on the thermodynamic response of partially filled tanks under different sloshing regimes, pressurization techniques, pressurant gasses and tank designs (e.g. with or without baffles). The\nPreprint submitted to Applied Thermal Engineering December 26, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n12 24\n6v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 2\n3 D\nec 2\n02 2\ndata retrieved in these experiments allowed several authors to develop and validate simplified models to predict the thermodynamic changes in fuel tanks due to sloshing. The simplest and yet most popular approach is a quasi-dimensional (0D) formulation [1, 28, 29, 30] in which the fuel tank system is composed of three control volumes (CVs): the ullage gas, the liquid, and the solid walls. Under this lumped formulation, the model equations are derived from each volume\u2019s energy and mass balances, using mass-averaged thermodynamic properties for each volume. This results in a coupled system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) which can be solved for a given set of inputs and initial states to predict evaporation and condensation rate and hence the thermodynamic evolution of the fuel tank. Since these models are simple to derive and computationally inexpensive to evaluate, they can be easily integrated with other sub-models to perform system simulations [31] in real time.\nHowever, these models must rely on closure laws for heat and mass transfer coefficients to close the system of equations. While several empirical correlations have been proposed for stationary/long-term storage conditions [14, 28, 29], their estimation during sloshing events remains an open problem. Moreover, no established methodology has been proposed in the literature for driving these closure laws in dynamic conditions.\nA natural approach is to \u2018tune\u2019 these coefficients such that numerical prediction match well with experimental data (see [1] and [30]). This can provide useful orders of magnitude, but it can hardly account for the time variation of these coefficients. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, the only correlation currently available for modelling the sloshing-enhanced thermal mixing has been proposed by Ludwig & Dreyer [32]. These authors have proposed an empirical law for the sloshing-induced \u2018effective diffusivity\u2019, which depends on the system\u2019s initial condition and the maximum pressure variation measured in the tank. Their correlation, expressed in terms of a sloshing-based Nusselt number, proved valid for their experimental data and the experiments of Das & Hopfinger [33] and Moran et. al [11]. However, the agreement was limited to the initial stages of the sloshing excitation.\nThis work presents an experimental characterization of the sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer and proposes a modelbased inverse method to derive empirical correlations from the measurements of pressure and temperatures in the tank. The inverse method sets an optimization problem in which the closure terms are automatically tuned to minimize the discrepancy between experimental data and a model\u2019s prediction. This datadriven approach, common in data-assimilation literature [34], has been used in the calibration of constitutive laws [35], modelling of dynamic menisci [36], thermal turbulence closure [37], flow control [38] and modelling closure for stagnation line flow in hypersonic reentry [39].\nThis work gives a promising proof of concept on using such a model-based inverse method to derive empirical laws for sloshing-induced heat and mass transfer from pressure and temperature measurements in the tank. We consider a reduced-scale upright cylindrical tank using the non-cryogenic replacement fluid HFE-7200 [40]. The experiments were carried out under different lateral sloshing excitation in the presence of an axial\nthermal stratification. The underlying thermodynamic model is a classic 0D formulation of the energy and mass balance between three control volumes (liquid, ullage gas and solid), while the optimization was carried out with the Basinhopping algorithm, complemented with a Monte Carlo approach for estimating model uncertainties.\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the physical problem alongside all modelling assumptions and approximations. Section 3 summarizes the experimental test cases and the theoretical aspects used to reproduce different sloshing conditions in the laboratory. Section 4 reports on the methodology, including a detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and procedure, the 0D model, and the inverse method. The results are shown and discussed in Section 5. Conclusions and future outlook are presented in Section 6."

            "text": "The problem considered in this work is schematically illustrated Figure 1. A cylindrical tank of radius R and height H, with a flat top and bottom surfaces, is filled with liquid until a height Hl. The tank is closed and pressurized until the ullage gas is at a pressure pg. The ullage is composed of a mixture of two species: an inert gas at partial pressure pa and the liquid\u2019s vapour at partial pressure pv.\nThe tank walls are adiabatic with mass mw and specific heat capacity cw. Because of the tank\u2019s pressurization, the system tends towards a thermally stratified configuration in which the liquid is colder than the gas. More specifically, to a first approximation, one might expect an axisymmetric temperature field T pr, zq, with r the radial coordinate and z the vertical one, as sketched in the right-hand side of Figure 1. Subscripts l, g w denote variables linked to the liquid, the gas and the walls. The gas-liquid interface is at the saturation temperature Tsatppvq corresponding to the gas pressure, and a positive temperature gradient BzT develops at the interface (cf. Figure 1). No mass transfer occurs between liquid and gas if the ullage gas is saturated with the liquid vapour.\nIn this work, we focus on the perturbation of this state due to lateral sloshing of the tank. We consider an harmonic displacement along x with amplitude A0 and angular frequency \u2126:\nXptq \u201c A0 sinp\u2126tq. (1)\nSloshing induces the mixing of the liquid interface, thus a destratification of the thermal field. This reduces the (average) interface temperature Ti, which in turn leads to an increase in the heat transfer and mass transfer at the interface. Both mechanisms lead to a pressure drop. We here seek to analyze experimentally whether a simple 0D model of the heat and mass transfer can describe the thermodynamic evolution of the ullage gas after a sloshing event.

            "text": "This section describes the excitation conditions applied to the fuel tank to produce liquid sloshing. The system was excited in the vicinity of the natural frequency corresponding to the first asymmetrical lateral sloshing mode. The natural frequencies in a partly-filled upright cylindrical reservoir subject to these conditions are given by:\n\u03c92mn \u201c \u02c6 g\u03bemn R ` \u03c3 \u03c1l \u03be3mn R3 \u02d9 tanh \u02c6 \u03bemnHl R \u02d9 , (5)\nwhere m, n are the indices defining the sloshing mode, \u03bemn is the nth zero of the first derivative of the mth order Bessel function, \u03c3 is the surface tension and \u03c1l is the liquid\u2019s density [41]. The lowest wave mode that can be excited in these conditions is the first asymmetrical one m \u201c n \u201c 1. Investigations on several flights of the Arianespace launchers show that the p1, 1q mode is the primary excitation during the propelled phase [18, 42]. Therefore, this work focuses on excitations close to \u03c911.\nThree different wave responses may be observed in these conditions: (1) planar waves, (2) chaotic, and (3) swirl sloshing [43]. The planar wave regime is observed for low amplitudes and frequencies and is characterized by harmonic motion. The chaotic regime is observed for excitation frequencies near resonance conditions. In this regime, the sloshing dynamics quickly depart from a linear condition, leading to unpredictable interface dynamics. Finally, the swirling regime is observed for excitation frequencies slightly above resonance. Swirling waves can be classified as stable if the rotational velocity remains constant or unstable if it periodically changes direction.\nThe boundaries between these regimes have been analytically derived by Miles [43], and experimentally verified by Royon-Lebeaud [44], who proposed the following relation:\nA0 R \u201c 1 1.684\n\u02dc\np\u2126{\u03c911q2 \u00b4 1 Bi\n\u00b83{2\n, (6)\nwhere A0 and \u2126 were defined in Section 2 and Bi, is the frequency offset parameter that separates the sloshing regimes in the vicinity of \u03c911. These are B2 \u201c \u00b40.36, B3 \u201c \u00b41.55, and B4 \u201c 0.735.\nFigure 2 shows Mile\u2019s diagram together with boundaries between regimes according to (6) and the six conditions investigated in this work. These are further detailed in Table 2 and described in Section 4.2 together with the experimental procedure. To complement the aforementioned kinematic description, the\ndynamics of the sloshing regime and its mixing efficiency are linked to the sloshing Reynolds number Res proposed by Ludwig & Dreyer [32], defined as:\nRes \u201c \u2126\n\u03c911\n\u02c6\nb R\n\u02d92 ` gR3 \u02d81{2\n\u03bd\na\n\u03be11, (7)\nwhere b is an estimate of the wave amplitude expected during the sloshing motion.

According to these authors, the critical Reynolds number for the mixing is pResqc \u201c 4.0 \u00a8 103 \u02d8 20%. Below this value, sloshing does not significantly increase the heat or mass transfer in the tank."

The table has dimensions of 1.5 m \u02c6 1.5 m and allows to mount different experimental setups. This facility is composed of three sliding modules, one for each axis, which can recreate complex three-dimensional excitation with controlled amplitudes and frequencies. A schematic of the table\u2019s three sliding modules is shown in Figure 3. Since this work focuses on lateral sloshing, only excitation in the x direction was considered. The displacement of this sliding module was measured with an Optical Displacement Sensor (ODS30) [45]. This sensor measures displacements in the range of 28\u00b4 32 mm.\nThe sloshing cell used in this work is a quartz rectangular cuboid with dimensions 100 mm \u02c6 100 mm \u02c6 134 mm in which a cylindrical hole with diameter D \u201c 80 mm was drilled down to a depth of 124 mm. The top cover of the cell consisted of a 12 mm acrylic glass plate with a cylindrical extrusion in the centre with a 12mm thickness and a diameter slightly smaller\nthan 80 mm. This assembly was instrumented with thirteen 0.25 mm grounded mineral insulated type K thermocouples, a static pressure tap, and two heating elements. Figure 4 shows a top view of the cell, illustrating the position of the pressure tap and the thermocouples in radial and angular coordinates. The thermocouples are numbered counter-clockwise, and their location is given in Table 1 in a cylindrical reference system centred on the bottom wall, at the origin of axes in Figure 1. Eight thermocouples were placed in one half of the cell\u2019s cross-section along its periphery at a diameter D \u201c 75 mm, and five were located along the centerline. These thermocouples have a response time of 7.5 ms when plunged into boiling water from air at 20 \u02ddC, and their signals were acquired through two NI9212 8 Channel National Instruments cards with a sampling rate of 95 Hz per channel.\nThe top-mounted pressure tap was connected to a Validyne with an M38 diaphragm diameter and maximum admissible pressure of 0.55 bar. The Validyne CD15 carrier demodulator was used to convert the analogue pressure measurement into an output voltage between \u02d810 V. The response time of the pressure line was estimated to be around 156 ms.\nTwo Minco Polyimide Thermofoil HK6907 heaters [46] were selected to impose the thermally stratified field during the initialization stage. The heating was applied from the top to reproduce an axial thermal stratification similar to [17, 18, 32]. These heaters have dimensions of 25.4 mm \u02c6 50.8 mm \u02c6 1.14 mm, and minimum and maximum working temperatures of - 32 and 100 \u02ddC, respectively. Their maximum output power is 16.4 W. A 0.25 mm type K thermocouple was attached to one of these elements with thermal paste to monitor their temperature during the heating stage of the experiments. This thermocouple was then connected to a Tempatron PID330 controller to regulate the power provided by the TENMA 72-8700 [47] power supply, ensuring the maximum limit of 100\u02ddC was never crossed.\nThe facility was insulated with a 50 mm layer of Rockwool 850 material [48]. This minimized the environmental effect and improved the experiments\u2019 repeatability. Figure 5a shows a\ncut-out view of the experimental setup composed of the quartz tank, top-cover and bottom-cover assemblies, temperature sensing instrumentation, and insulation layer.\nThe facility was equipped for high speed visualization (HSV) in back-lighting conditions and for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Both were performed without insulation, which prevents optical access. Nevertheless, the importance of these tests was\ntwofold, as further described in Section 5.1. The HSV allowed a qualitative confirmation of the expected sloshing regime while the PIV was performed to analyze the flow field in the liquid phase before the sloshing event and thus ensure that each experiment started from the same (quiescent) conditions. For the PIV measurements, the liquid was seeded with fluorescent polymer microspheres with a density of 1300 kg/m3 and diameter 1-5 \u00b5m. The image acquisition was performed with a 12 bit Imager SX 4M camera [49] with a resolution of 2360 \u00d7 1776 pixels. The region of interest was illuminated by the Litron Bernoulli Laser [50]. This pulsed Nd:YAG laser has a maximum repetition rate of 15 Hz, an output power of 200 mJ per cavity, and a 3\u00b4 7 ns pulse duration at 532 nm. The laser beam was focused through the spherical lens and turned into a sheet with a cylindrical lens. This sheet was then deflected through a prism underneath the sloshing cell, thus illuminating its mid-plane from the bottom."

In the first phase, the quartz cell is filled with 302 \u02d8 2 ml of HFE-7200. This results in a liquid level of 60\u02d8 0.4 mm measured from the bottom of the cell. Then, the top cover is closed and screwed into position. Temperature-resistant grease is used to improve the connection between the O-rings, the aluminium interface plate, the quartz cell and the top cover. The setup remains closed for several hours until stable temperature and pressure readings are established inside the cell. This duration is long enough to allow the liquid\u2019s vapour to saturate the ullage gas.\nOnce this condition was met, the second phase begins with the acquisition of the pressure and temperature signals. During this second phase, the heating elements are switched on and produce a constant heat flux until the operating temperature of 100 \u02ddC is reached. Then, the third phase begins with the PID controller actively enforcing a constant temperature on the heater surface. During this third phase, the system is warmed at a slower rate from the constant temperature surface at the top of the cell.\nThe pressure evolution and temperature distribution in the cell were continuously measured throughout this initialization stage, which lasted one hour and generated an axial thermal stratification in the tank. Figure 6 shows a typical reading for the pressure sensor in the ullage gas and the thermocouples during the second, third and fourth phases. The fourth phase consists of the actual sloshing experiment: the heater was switched off, and the lateral excitation was initiated from the controller\nscreen of the SHAKESPEARE sloshing table. The time label t \u201c 0 is associated with the start of the sloshing, which is the focus of this work. Each excitation lasted 10 minutes, after which the data acquisition system was terminated, and the shaking table was turned off.\nFigure 6a shows the impact of the different phases on the\npressure. The heating during the preparatory phase leads to an increase in the ullage pressure. This rise is initially steeper both because of the warm-up and the evaporation of the liquid. The temperature profiles, shown in Figure 6a, clearly reveal the thermal stratification reached before sloshing. Sloshing mitigates the thermal stratification and reduces the temperature at the liquid interface by approximately 3 \u02ddC in the illustrated example. This drastically reduces the saturation pressure in the ullage gas and induces condensation. The resulting pressure drop is visible in Figure 6a for t \u0105 0s.\nThe initial thermodynamic conditions for each of the performed test cases are collected in Table 2. Case s0 was included as a reference condition to investigate the pressure and temperature evolution of the initialized system without sloshing. The positioning of these conditions in the Mile\u2019s diagram is shown in Figure 2. To compute the absolute pressure and spatially averaged temperatures required by the model, the measurement was complemented with a reading of the atmospheric pressure from the VKI\u2019s meteorological station while volume averaged temperatures were computed numerically at each time-instant through adaptive quadrature in Scipy [51] using the instantaneous readings in each thermocouple."

The net mass transfer due to the phase change is linked to the heat fluxes through the energy balance at the interface:\n9mi \u201c \u00b4 9Qgi ` 9Qli Lv .

Equations (16) - (18) were derived considering that dh \u00ab cpdT and du \u00ab cvdT in the ullage, whereas du \u00ab cpdT for the liquid region as proposed in [53].\nGiven the lack of real gas equations of state for the HFE7200 used in this work, the ideal gas law was used to model vapor\u2019s properties in the ullage. In a first approximation, this appears reasonable considering that the reduced pressure is in the range pR \u201c pv{pc \u201c 0.01\u00b40.02 and the reduced temperature is in the range TR \u201c T{Tc \u201c 0.60\u00b4 0.65, with critical conditions Tc \u201c 483.15 K, and pc \u201c 2.01 MPa [40]. At such low reduced\npressure, the compressibility factor Z \u201c pv{\u03c1vRvTg can be expected to be close to unity for most common fluids [52] and it this thus believed that the impact of this simplifying assumption is within the uncertainties of the inverse method.\nTherefore, the pressure evolution in the ullage can be determined by taking the time derivative of the ideal gas law and expanding it with the chain rule. This gives\ndpg dt \u201c maRa ` mvRv Vg\n\u02dc\ndT g dt \u00b4 dVg dt T g Vg\n\u00b8\n` RvT g\nVg\ndmg dt . (19)\nEquation (19) highlights the three fundamental mechanisms responsible for pressure variations in closed reservoirs. These are time variations in the (1) ullage gas temperature, (2) ullage volume, and (3) vapour mass. The rate-of-change of the ullage volume was derived from the volume variation on the liquid side. Since the liquid is treated as incompressible, its density is only a function of the temperature and thus\ndVl dt \u201c \u00b4 dVg dt \u201c 1 \u03c1l dml dt \u00b4 ml \u03c12l B\u03c1l BT\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7\np\ndT l dt\n(20)\nwhere B\u03c1l{BTl|p is the liquid\u2019s isobaric compressibility. Under the assumption that the vapour and the inert in the ullage gas are at the same temperature T g and the interface is always at saturation conditions (equation (14)), the thermal evolution of the problem must be constrained to the condition that T g \u0105 Ti. However, the energy balance underlying (16)-(18) does not guarantee this condition to be satisfied. To enforce this constraint, the system was complemented with the equations governing the evolution of the pressure and average temperatures of gas and liquid along the saturation line. These read:\ndpg dt \u201c Bpg B\u03c1\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7\nsat\n\u02dc\n1 Vg dmv dt \u00b4 mg V2g dVg dt\n\u00b8\n(21)\ndT g dt \u201c BT g B\u03c1\n\u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7\nsat\n\u02dc\n1 Vg dmv dt \u00b4 mg V2g dVg dt\n\u00b8\n(22)\ndT l dt \u201c\nQwg ` Qwl \u00b4 pmacv,a ` mvcv,vq dT g dt \u00b4 cv,vT g dmv dt\nmlcp,l , (23)\nwhere Bpg{B\u03c1|sat and BT g{B\u03c1 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7\nsat were obtained by differentiat-\ning the Clasius-Clapeyron relation coupled with the ideal gas law. These equations were solved in parallel to (16)-(18) but activated only at the limiting case T g \u201c Ti to prevent T g to drop below Ti.\nEquations (16)-(23) constitute a system of ordinary differential equations in which eight variables describe the state of the system. These are:\nx \u201c \u201c T g T l T w mv ml Vg Vl pg \u2030 . (24)\nThe evolution of this system from a set of initial conditions x0 depends on the fluid properties and tank geometry, as well as four heat transfer coefficients hli, hgi, hwl, hwg (see eq. (2)).\nSpecial treatment was given to the averaged wall temperature T w, because this was not measured during the experiments and cannot be linked to the other quantities unless its initial value T wpt \u201c 0q is given. Therefore, the model predictions were run considering three scenarios for T wpt \u201c 0q. These are: (1) T wp0q \u201c T gp0q, (2) T wp0q \u201c pT lp0q ` T gp0qq{2 and (3) T wp0q \u201c T lp0q. These cover the full range of possible wall temperatures and allow for analyzing the impact of this variable on the closure derivation.\nConcerning the heat transfer coefficients hli and hgi, experimental observation suggested that these could be modelled as decaying exponentials\nhgiptq \u201c h0gie \u00b4t{\u03c4 ` h8gi (25)\nhliptq \u201c h0lie \u00b4t{\u03c4 ` h8li , (26)\nwhich define h0gi, h 0 li, h 8 li , h 8 li and \u03c4. The time constant \u03c4 is related to the transient heat transfer due to the sloshing: within t ! \u03c4, the heat exchange is strongly dominated by the sloshinginduced thermal de-stratification, while at t \" \u03c4, the heat transfer is mostly due to conduction and hence less dependent on the sloshing regime.\nThe model prediction in the proposed inverse method thus depends on seven parameters\nh \u201c \u201c h0gi h 0 li h 8 gi h 8 li \u03c4 hwg hwl \u2030 , (27)\nwhich must be estimated from the available data. The global mass transfer coefficient defined in Equation (4) can be computed a posteriori to evaluate the evaporation/condensation rates at the interface.\nIn summary, the thermodynamic model described in this section can be cast in the form of a parametric initial value problem:\n#\n9x \u201c fpx,t; hq xp0q \u201c x0\n(28)\nin which 9x is the time-derivative of the state in (24), and fpx, t; hq collect the right-hand-side of the system of equations (16)-(23). In what follows, however, the problem set was further simplified by assuming that no heat exchange occurs between the gas and the wall (hence forcing hwg \u201c 0). This simplification was motivated a-posteriori because the optimization detailed in the following section systematically zeroed this term in all the investigated experimental conditions."

Here t P Rnt denotes a set of randomly sampled points in time and the tilde\ndenotes variable normalization. This scaling is necessary because the variables in x include different physical quantities with largely different numerical values and physical units. The scaling is performed by mean shifting and standardization (i.e. to unitary standard deviation).\nThe optimal parameters are thus those that minimize the objective function Jpx,hq with respect to h:\nargmin h\nJpxptq; hq \u201c ||x\u0303eptq \u00b4 x\u0303px0, t; hq||22 \u201c ||Rphq||22, (29)\nwhere || \u201a ||2 denotes the induced l2 norm of a matrix. For a given set of times t P Rnt, the residual are stored into a matrix Rphq P R8\u02c6nt .\nThe optimization was performed with the Basinhopping algorithm [54]. This alternates a quasi-Newton method with a random search for re-initialization. The random search is carried out using simulated annealing: a new candidate solution hnew is generated by perturbing the current guess, and this is accepted as a new solution with a piece-wise probability density of the form\nP \u201c\n$\n&\n%\n1 if Jphnewq \u0103 Jpholdq\nexp \u00b4 \u00b4Jph newq\u00b4Jpholdq\n\u03bb\n\u00af\nif Jphnewq \u011b Jpholdq (30)\nThe parameter \u03bb plays the role of the temperature in simulated annealing, where it is usually made iteration-dependent. In this work, this was taken as \u03bb \u201c 0.01. The new solution is then given as an initial guess for the quasi-Newton L-BFGSB algorithm (see [55]), which operates using finite differences for the gradient calculation. Once the stopping criterion for the BFGS is reached, the Basinhopping algorithm repeats the random search unless the optimization is terminated. The perturbation is made large enough to pick a new guess outside the basin of attraction of the identified local minima but small enough not to exceed the pre-defined boundaries of the parameter space. This was achieved by placing the new points halfway between the identified local minima. The termination occurs if the optimal solution does not change by more than 0.1% in the last 500 iterations.\nThe uncertainty in determining the optimal coefficients was estimated via a Monte Carlo method. Given that the measured signals contain noise, the input data in x\u0303eptqwas randomly sampled from the available experiments such that only half of the points were used for training the model. In each of these sampling, the first entry in time is used as the initial condition for the numerical simulation, and the model calibration was performed N \u201c 100 times.\nThe initial conditions x0 supplied to the model were given as the starting values of the training set x\u0303ep0q. Therefore, the model calibration was performed through N \u201c 100 optimizations by randomly selecting different training sets and initial conditions each time. This resulted in a matrix of optimal solutions H\u02da P R100\u02c65 in which the i-th row collects the optimized parameters at the i-th run. The variability in this matrix reflects\nthe uncertainties in the model\u2019s training; thus, the standard deviation in each column is associated with the uncertainty in each parameter. Finally, these uncertainties were propagated to the numerical predictions of pgptq, T gptq and T lptq by evaluating the model for each set of coefficients in H\u02da.\nIn each of these evaluations, the initial conditions were perturbed with Gaussian distributions with mean and standard deviation taken from the experimental data of pg, T g and T l in the quasi-stationary conditions before the sloshing."

These experiments analyzed the temperature profile of the empty cell (i.e. filled with air) after one heating cycle (i.e., heating up the cell for one hour and allowing it to cool down passively for another hour). The tests were repeated with the insulated and the non-insulated facilities (see Section 5b).\nDuring these tests, the thermal profile was analyzed with the available thermocouples (cf. Section 4.1 and Table 1). Under the assumption of fully adiabatic and axisymmetric conditions,\nand in the absence of buoyancy-driven flows, the conductiondominated thermal field in the tank should lead to a linear temperature profile along its z axis once steady-state conditions are reached. The results of this analysis are reported in Figure 7 for both the non-insulated and the insulated facilities. The linearity of the temperature profile proves that the assumption of adiabatic conditions is reasonable for the case of the insulated facility, which is the one analyzed in the following subsections.\nA second campaign was also carried out, with the aim of characterizing the velocity field in the liquid during the heating phase. In this phase, before sloshing, the liquid should be quiescent to ensure repeatability. However, the temperature gradients in the cell inevitably produce buoyant flows that could undermine this assumption. Therefore, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to analyze the potential impact of buoyancy in setting the initial conditions for the sloshing experiments. Although the thermal profiles are different in the absence of the insulation, Figure 7 shows that the \u2206T between the top and the bottom surfaces of the cell are comparable. Therefore, it is believed that the PIV analysis in non-insulated conditions is also representative for the insulated setup.\nThe cell was filled up to H \u201c 60mm, and the velocity field was captured at the start of the constant temperature phase (i.e. t P rtT , tS s, see Figure 6 and Section 4.2. The PIV was sampled at 10 Hz, and time-averaged velocity fields were captured every 500 images. The first (at t \u00ab tT ) and the last (at t \u00ab tS ) timeaveraged velocity fields are shown in Figure 8.\nAs shown in Figure 8 on the left, upward convective currents are observed at t \u00ab tT , with velocities of the order of \u00ab 1mm/s. However, these decrease during the course of the heating stage and nearly vanish at t \u201c tS as shown in Figure 8 on the right. In conclusion, these results show that the impact of buoyancy-driven currents on the liquid is negligible, and the assumption of quiescent initial conditions for the sloshing phase is reasonable."

            "text": "We here report on the response of the liquid interface for the experimental conditions detailed in Table 2. The observed\nresponses were in line with Mile\u2019s regime classification (Figure 2) except for test case s4, which was expected to be in the chaotic regime but produced a planar wave response like cases s2 and s3. This discrepancy might be explained by the proximity of the point to the boundaries between these two regimes (see Figure 2). However, as conditions s3 are equally close to this boundary but on the planar wave regime side, it appears that the frequency offset parameter B3 might be slightly underpredicted by the theory.\nConcerning the test cases in the planar waves regimes, case s1 is in subcritical conditions, Res \u0103 (Res)c in (7), while cases s2, s3, s4 are in supercritical conditions, Res \u0105 (Res)c in (7). Finally, case s5 is in the swirl wave regime as expected. The lack of points in the chaotic regime in the reported campaign stems from the difficulties in performing the measurements in this regime. Several conditions in chaotic sloshing conditions were reproduced during the campaign, but the violent response of the interface resulted in severe wetting/de-wetting of thermocouples and pressure taps, which led to unreliable measurements.\nFigure 9a illustrates a snapshot of the liquid interface in the three investigated conditions, namely planar subcritical slosh-\ning (s1), planar supercritical sloshing (s2) and swirl sloshing (s5). For each of these, the figures in the bottom reports on the time evolution of the vertical displacement \u03b7ptq at a point located in the mid-plane of the tank at a distance R{4 away from the lateral wall. This displacement is computed with respect to the original height of the interface at t \u201c 0. This measurement was obtained via image processing of the video sequence, by identifying regions of sharp changes in the image\u2019s intensity along each \u2018pixel-column\u2019. The edge detection approach is similar to the approaches in [56, 57].\nAs expected, the interface response for each of the sloshing modes in the planar test cases is the sum of the harmonic response to the perturbation and exponentially vanishing transients of the form expp\u00b4\u03b3n, j\u03c9n, jtq. The decay rates \u03b3n, j of the transients are linked to the viscous damping and can be computed analytically using the linear theory in [41], in which the flow velocity is assumed to be the sum of a potential contribution and a rotational one due to viscosity.\nFocusing on the first mode pn, jq \u201c p1, 1q, by far the most energetic, the decay rate \u03b31,1 is derived in [41] and reads\n\u03b31,1 \u201c \u03b41,1 b\n4\u03c02 ` \u03b421,1 (31)\nwhere the logarithmic decrement, \u03b41,1, is\n\u03b41,1 \u201c 2\u03c0K \u03bd\n1 2 ` 1` 2 ` 1\u00b4 hR \u02d8\u02d8\nR 3 4 g 1 4 tanh 1 4 ` \u03be1,1 h R \u02d8 sinh ` 2\u03be1,1 hR \u02d8\n(32)\nfor upright cylinders without baffles, where K \u00ab 0.59 is a parameter that accounts for the geometry of the tank [18]. This derivation, also verified experimentally in [58], considers that the frictional losses between the oscillating flow field and the solid walls are limited to the Stokes boundary layer [59].\nThe exponentially decaying envelope of the transient response using (31) is shown with dashed lines in Figure 9b for cases s1 and s3. As the transient vanishes, the interface motion tends towards its harmonic response. The agreement between experimental data and theory is remarkable. Moreover, the interface\u2019s response is also characterized by the \u2018beating phenomena\u2019 during the transient, as the excitation frequency (2.7 Hz in s1 and 2.83Hz in s3) is close to the natural frequency (3.375 Hz). This results in the periodic modulation at fb \u201c 0.67 Hz for s1 and fb \u201c 0.54 Hz for s3. Finally, concerning the swirling case (case s5), the linear theory illustrated for the previous test cases does not hold. The sloshing initially begins with lateral waves (at the associated beating) but gradually gains a rotational component until a stable swirl wave is produced at t \u0105 30s. The impact of these sloshing excitation on the thermodynamic state of the system is described in the following section."

The non-dimensional temperature on the gas and liquid side are defined, respectively, as:\n\u0398gptq \u201c T ptq \u00b4 Tsat,0 Tt,0 \u00b4 Tsat,0 , (33)\n\u0398lptq \u201c T ptq \u00b4 Tb,0 Tsat,0 \u00b4 Tb,0 , (34)\nwhere Tt,0 is the temperature measured at t \u201c 0 by the thermocouple closest to the top of the tank, Tb,0 is the temperature measured the same instant by the thermocouple closest to the bottom, and Tsat,0 is the corresponding saturation temperature.\nThe non-dimensional pressure is defined as the ratio between the instantaneous gauge pressure in the cell \u2206pgptq and its initial value \u2206pg,0:\n\u2206p\u0302g \u201c \u2206pgptq \u2206pg,0 . (35)\nWe focus on the gauge pressure instead of the absolute pressure because the objective was to assess the pressure change in the ullage due to sloshing.\nFigure 10 shows the normalized gauge pressure evolution in all test cases after the system pressurization (phase three in Section 4.2) is concluded and the heating is turned off, that is t P r0, 10s min. This figure should be analyzed together with Figure 11, which shows the temperature evolution in the five cases, as measured by the thermocouples in the ullage volume (top row of plots) and the ones immersed in the liquid (bottom row). The height of the thermocouple location (see Table 1) is recalled at the bottom of each line of plots.\nWe begin with case s0, which is the baseline test without sloshing. During the 10 minutes of observation, the gauge pressure decreased by roughly 45%. This is due to the cooling of the ullage to the lateral walls and the liquid under it, as visible from Fig 11b. Noteworthy is the continuous warm-up of the liquid due to the thermal energy stored in the thick quartz wall of the tank.\nMoving to case s1, which is in planar sloshing conditions, its pressure evolution in Figure 10 is nearly identical to the baseline in quiescent conditions. The analysis of the temperature evolution reveals a moderate heat exchange between liquid and gas. On the gas side, this is noticeable only in the thermocouple closest to the interface (at approximately 4 mm) near the interface. On the liquid side, a sloshing-induced temperature drop is observed down to the second thermocouple (about 40mm underneath the interface). However, soon after the sloshing event, the temperature evolution restores the linearly increasing trend observed for case s0. The moderate impact of sloshing on the pressure evolution in this test case is compatible with its low sloshing-based Reynolds number (see (7)), which is roughly 5.1e3 and thus within the \u02d820% range of the critical value pResqc below which no significant heat or mass transfer is expected [32].\nCases s2, s3, and s4 exhibited similar pressure and temperature evolutions. According to their sloshing-based Reynolds numbers, which were one order of magnitude higher than case s1, it was expected that these experiments should produce in-\ncreasingly larger sloshing-induced pressure drops (i.e., s2 \u0103 s3 \u0103 s4). However, case s4 produced a pressure evolution higher than s2, but lower than s3. This might be explained by slightly higher initial temperatures in the quartz walls and the liquid bulk (Table 2). Nevertheless, the normalized pressure evolutions are within the uncertainty bars of each other, which was expected given that the sloshing-based Reynolds number was in the same order of magnitude across all three tests (Table 2). Because of this similarity, only the temperature distribution measured in case s3 is shown in Figure 11b. These cases are characterized by a sharp drop in the ullage pressure at the sloshing onset, followed by a strong thermal mixing in the vicinity of the interface. The sloshing event does not influence the temperature at the bottom of the tank (at about 51 mm from the interface).\nFinally, case s5, in swirling conditions, results in a significant pressure drop and thermal destratification. The gauge pressure (see Figure 10) reduces by 90% within the first 70 seconds, and the temperature in the liquid (see Figure 11b) becomes nearly uniform at t \u00ab 100 s. The temperature drop in the gas is also significant and becomes nearly constant near the interface. At t \u0105 150s, after the mixing is complete, the temperature in the liquid increases again because of the exchanges with the wall. As this occurs, the pressure rises again, possibly due to evaporation as the interface warms up. This test case showcases the tremendous impact that sloshing-induced heat\nand mass transfer can have on the pressure and temperature of the ullage gas."

For each quantity, the table provides the mean value and the confidence interval, defined as twice the standard deviation, obtained from the columns of the H\u02da matrix in the Monte-Carlo evaluation (see Section 4.4).\nFigure 12 complements this analysis by showing the distribution of the optimal h0gi, h 0 li coefficients for test cases s1-s5. Case s0 was omitted because only h8gi , h 8 li and hwl were calibrated in the absence of sloshing. The results in Table 3 demonstrate that the different scenarios for T 0 w have minimal impact on the coefficients discovered through the inverse method, except for hwl. This parameter is maximum when T 0 w \u201c T 0 l , and minimum when T 0 w \u201c T 0 g. Interestingly, the inverse method adapts the optimal hwl to the wall temperature to provide the same heat exchange 9Qwlptq. This could be expected from the fact that hwl and T wptq appear in the system of ODEs through the 9Qwlptq term. This is confirmed in\nTable 4, which shows the time-averaged value of this heat flux for all experimental test cases and the three different wall temperature scenarios. The impact of the initial wall temperature on the predicted heat flux 9Qwl is within 2.8%, confirming its negligible influence on the regression of the other coefficients.\nFrom Table 3 and Figure 12, it is evident that h0li, h 0 gi, and hwl increase with the sloshing-based Reynolds number. This is consistent with the pressure and temperature evolutions reported in the previous section. As expected, the 0D model correlates the sudden pressure and the temperature drops observed in Figures 10-11 for cases s2-s5 with larger values of h0li and h 0 gi than those identified in cases s1 and s0. On the other hand, he identified h8gi is nearly the same in all cases s0-s4. This suggests that the heat exchanges between the gas and the interface, at large\ntimes, are independent of the sloshing conditions. These results agree with the experimental measurements presented in Section 5.3, which show that planar sloshing triggers the initial thermal destratification, but the long-term evolution is driven by conduction because the convective fluxes cannot reach the bulk fluid.\nThis result also aligns with the identified decay time \u03c4, reported in the last column, Table 3. As highlighted in Section 5.2, the transient sloshing dynamic is characterized by a decay rate \u03c91,1\u03b31,1 \u201c 48.7 ms\u00b41, which is comparable to the time scale \u03c4 for the cases s3-s5, where the pressure drop was particularly evident. This suggests that the time scale of the destratification is comparable to the time scale of the sloshing\u2019s transient dynamics. Moreover, it is possible that the derived coefficients are not only linked to the sloshing regime per se (planar or swirl), but also the transient sloshing dynamics.\nFigure 12 shows that the distribution of identified coefficients is narrow and unimodal for all cases except for case s5. This test case produced the steepest pressure drop, leading to homogeneous temperature fields in the liquid after 30 excitation periods. Accordingly, the inverse method derives the highest h0gi and h 0 li coefficients. Moreover, it predicts the largest amount of heat exchanged with the walls (see Table 4), which appears much larger than the one exchanged with the interface ( 9Qli ). Therefore, the model suggests that the rise in the liquid temperature in Figure 11b is primarily due to the heat transfer with the solid walls.\nThe results of the 0D model are compared against the experimental measurements for cases s0, s1, s3 and s5 in Figure\n13, which was generated for the scenario T 0 w \u201c pT 0 l ` T 0 gq{2. The dashed lines represent the pressure and temperature evolutions generated using the mean h\u0304\u02da coefficients from Table 3, and with the initial conditions of each test case X0. The shaded area represents the uncertainty of the prediction, estimated as described in Section 4.4.\nThe results of the calibrated model showed good agreement with the experimental data, which was generally within the uncertainty bands of the prediction. Figures 13a and 13b correspond to tests s0 and s1, respectively. While the pressure and gas temperature evolutions were nearly identical in these tests, steeper initial drops were registered for s1. This observation aligns with the much lower value of h0gi in case s0 compared to s1. This difference is likely due to to the sudden excitation applied to case s1, which reduced the response time of the system compared to s0. Since the optimal coefficients in s0 were determined without the transient terms on the interface, the temperature drop in the ullage is overpredicted by 11%, whereas the numerical pressure drop is 5% more than the experimental one. On the other hand, the matching of case s1 is remarkable, with the mean numerical evolutions overlapping the experimental ones. The supercritical planar sloshing tests are represented by case s3 in Figure 13c. This figure highlights the model\u2019s ability to capture the system\u2019s transient pressure and temperature variations. Similar to s1, there is nearly perfect agreement between the numerical and experimental curves, which is remarkable given the steep initial variation in pressure and temperature.\nFinally, Figure 13d concerns the swirl test case s5. While the transient evolution of the system was well captured by the model, the following pressure rise was not well reproduced.\nMoreover, the rise in liquid temperature was overestimated by nearly two degrees, while the decrease in ullage temperature was steeper in the simulations. Nevertheless, the model showed promising agreement with the experiments, especially given its simple formulation and negligible computational cost.\nLastly, the model was used to assess the relative importance of the different terms which drive the pressure evolution according to Equation (19). Figure 14 shows the different contributing terms in dpg{dt, computed with T 0 w \u201c pT 0 l ` T 0 gq{2, for t P r0, 200s s. Solid lines represent the overall pressure changerate, dotted lines correspond to the variation due to thermal expansion/contraction, dashed lines represent the term accounting for changes in volume, and dash-dotted lines indicate the contribution of adding or removing vapour mass due to phase change through the interface. This last term depends on dmv{dt, which depends on the mass transfer coefficient defined in Equation (4). These figures show that the volumetric term can be neglected in all test cases.\nOn the other hand, the relative weight of the other two terms changes significantly with the sloshing conditions. The pressure drop in cases s0 and s1 is dominated by the thermal (cooling) contribution. Mass transfer and cooling have comparable weight in case s3, while case s5 is largely dominated by the mass transfer (condensation) effect until t \u00ab 40s. Approximately 85% of the initial pressure drop in s5 is due to condensation. Afterwards, the pressure evolution is again driven by the thermal effect, and a change of sign is observed at t \u0105 60 s. In this last phase, the liquid\u2019s temperature homogenized (see Figure 11b) and started warming up because of heat exchanges with the walls. This triggers evaporation, hence a rise in the tank\u2019s pressure."

            "text": "We presented an experimental characterization of non-isothermal sloshing in an upright cylindrical tank under lateral har-\nmonic excitation and proposed a model-based inverse method to infer heat and mass transfer coefficients.\nThe experiments were carried out on the Karman Institute\u2019s SHAKESPEARE sloshing table in a reduced-scale quartz tank\nfilled with HFE-7200 and instrumented with an array of thermocouples and a pressure tap. In all sloshing experiments, the tank is first pressurized and thermally stratified using heating elements on the ullage gas side. Temperature distribution and pressure were monitored both in the preparatory phase and the sloshing experiments, and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to prove that buoyant flows have a negligible impact on the liquid. Hence, the initial conditions for the sloshing are those of a quiescent and thermally stratified. Four main scenarios were analyzed: (1) absence of sloshing, (2) subcritical planar waves (2) subcritical planar waves, (3) supercritical planar waves, and (4) swirl waves.\nThe temperature and pressure measurements were used to infer heat and mass transfer coefficients in the tank using a model-based inverse method. These are identified via an optimization, carried out with the Basinhopping algorithm, as the one that minimizes the discrepancy between data and model prediction. The model is a simple 0D formulation of heat and mass balance between liquid, gas and walls.\nIn line with previous experimental works, it was observed that the subcritical planar waves (Res \u0103 (Res)c) do not appreciably increase the heat and mass transfer from the quiescent conditions. Instead, supercritical planar waves promote thermal mixing in the vicinity of the gas-liquid interface and produce an appreciable pressure drop in the tank. The mixing and the associated pressure drop are considerably larger in swirling conditions, which destroy the thermal stratification.\nIn all cases of sloshing enhanced heat and mass transfer rate, the model predicts that the pressure drop is primarily due to condensation from the ullage gas due to a change in temperature of the gas-liquid interface.\nConsidering the important simplifications underpinning the 0D model used in the inverse method, the results are particularly promising. If correctly calibrated, the model could reproduce the experimental data accurately in all the investigated conditions at a negligible computational cost. These results thus open the path to using model-based inverse derivations of closure laws to describe the thermodynamic evolution of nonisothermal sloshing. The same approach could be extended to all critical phases of cryogenic fuel storage (tank filling, pressurization, and long-term storage). Besides allowing for finding correlations from real-time data (for example, by searching for a link between the closure coefficients and states of the system), these could also be used for model predictive control and anomaly detection in thermal management systems. Both applications are currently under investigation."
