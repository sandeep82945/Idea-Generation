Development of a Hybrid Model for MCQ Evaluation: Building on the strengths of both the rule-based and GPT-4 methods, future research could explore the development of a hybrid model that combines rule-based logic for criteria that are straightforward and interpretable, with machine learning approaches for more complex or nuanced criteria. This hybrid model could potentially improve accuracy and reliability in identifying IWFs across a wider range of subject areas and question types.

Extension to Other Assessment Types: While this study focused on multiple-choice questions, similar methodologies could be applied to evaluate other types of assessment items, such as short answer, matching, or true/false questions. Research could explore the application of the IWF rubric or a modified version thereof to these different formats, potentially developing automatic evaluation methods tailored to each type.

Adaptive Learning Systems Integration: Integrating the rule-based evaluation method into adaptive learning systems could provide real-time feedback to educators and students on the quality of generated MCQs. Future research could investigate the effectiveness of such integrations in improving the quality of student-generated questions and enhancing learning outcomes, as well as exploring how these systems could be used to support personalized learning paths.

Cross-Domain and Cross-Cultural Validation: The current study was limited to four subject areas. Future research could explore the applicability and accuracy of the rule-based and GPT-4 methods across a broader range of domains, including humanities and social sciences, as well as across different educational levels (e.g., high school, graduate studies). Additionally, considering cultural differences in education and assessment practices, cross-cultural studies could examine the effectiveness of these methods in diverse educational contexts.

Longitudinal Studies on Learning Outcomes: Conducting longitudinal studies to assess the impact of using high-quality MCQs, as evaluated by the rule-based or GPT-4 methods, on student learning outcomes would be valuable. This could include examining student retention, comprehension, and the ability to apply knowledge in different contexts over time. Such studies could provide deeper insights into how the quality of assessment questions influences learning processes and outcomes.
