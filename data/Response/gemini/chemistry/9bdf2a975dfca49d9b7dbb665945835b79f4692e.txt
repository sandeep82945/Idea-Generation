1. **Investigate the role of glutathione in the oxidation of other MIA40 substrates.** The study found that glutathione is required for the oxidation of COX19 by AtERV1, but it is not known if this is the case for other MIA40 substrates. Future research could investigate the role of glutathione in the oxidation of other MIA40 substrates, such as CCMH and MICU.
2. **Determine the redox potential of the MIA40 catalytic disulfide.** The study found that the redox potential of the AtERV1 shuttle disulfide is -290 mV, but the redox potential of the MIA40 catalytic disulfide is not known. Future research could determine the redox potential of the MIA40 catalytic disulfide and compare it to the redox potential of the AtERV1 shuttle disulfide.
3. **Investigate the interaction between AtMIA40 and ScErv1.** The study found that AtMIA40 can oxidize CCMH in the presence of ScErv1, but it is not known how these two proteins interact. Future research could investigate the interaction between AtMIA40 and ScErv1 and determine how this interaction affects the oxidation of CCMH.
4. **Determine the physiological role of AtMIA40.** The study found that AtMIA40 is not essential for the import and oxidative folding of IMS-located proteins in Arabidopsis, but its physiological role is not known. Future research could investigate the physiological role of AtMIA40 and determine if it plays a role in other cellular processes, such as apoptosis or stress response.
5. **Develop new therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by mutations in MIA40 or ERV1.** Mutations in MIA40 or ERV1 have been linked to several diseases, such as myopathy and neuronal cell degeneration. Future research could develop new therapeutic strategies for these diseases by targeting the MIA40â€“ERV1 pathway.
