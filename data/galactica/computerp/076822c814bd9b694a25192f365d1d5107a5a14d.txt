Background noise considerably reduces the accuracy and reliability of speaker verification (SV) systems. These challenges can be addressed using a speech enhancement system as a front-end module. Recently, diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have exhibited remarkable noisecompensation capabilities in the speech enhancement domain. Building on this success, we propose Diff-SV, a noise-robust SV framework that leverages DPM. Diff-SV unifies a DPM-based speech enhancement system with a speaker embedding extractor, and yields a discriminative and noise-tolerable speaker representation through a hierarchical structure. The proposed model was evaluated under both in-domain and out-of-domain noisy conditions using the VoxCeleb1 test set, an external noise source, and the VOiCES corpus. The obtained experimental results demonstrate that Diff-SV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recently proposed noise-robust SV systems. 1. conclusion Based on the impressive generative capabilities of DPM, we propose a unified noise-robust SV framework that uses a DPM-based speech enhancement system. Using the ODE solver of the score-based DPM, DiffSV generates denoised features from the enhancer’s output in an efficient and deterministic manner. Furthermore, the complementary hierarchical inputs improve the extractor’s ability to derive discriminative and noiserobust speaker embeddings. Our proposed model outperforms recently reported models, including baselines, under both in- and out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Diff-SV and the importance of each component through visualization and ablation analyses.
