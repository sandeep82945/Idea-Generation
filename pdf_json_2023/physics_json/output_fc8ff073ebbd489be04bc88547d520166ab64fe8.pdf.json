    "abstractText": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the commonly used delivery tools for messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy and play an indispensable role in the success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Ionizable cationic lipids are the most important component in LNPs. Herein, we developed a series of new ionizable lipids featuring bioreducible disulfide bonds, and constructed a library of lipids derived from dimercaprol. LNPs prepared from these ionizable lipids could be stored at 4 \u25e6C for a long term and are non-toxic toward HepG2 and 293T cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the best C4S18A formulations, which embody linoleoyl tails, show strong firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA expression in the liver and spleen via intravenous (IV) injection, or at the local injection site via intramuscular injection (IM). The newly designed ionizable lipids can be potentially safe and high-efficiency nanomaterials for mRNA therapy.",

            "text": "mRNA vaccines have recently gained increasing attention to treat various infectious diseases, which showed the highest efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [1\u20134]. Theoretically, protein replacement therapy [5,6], cancer immunotherapy [7\u20139] and gene editing can also be reached via mRNA therapy [10]. However, the large size, negative charge and high hydrophilicity of mRNA stop it from passing through the cell membranes. Besides, the mRNA is highly immunogenic and can be sensed by the pattern recognition receptors, such as the endosomal Toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, which reduce the mRNA stability [11,12]. Furthermore, the RNase in the serum and tissues can degrade the mRNA rapidly after in vivo administration [13\u201315]. These barriers limit the medical application of mRNA therapy, and it is in urgent need for mRNA vectors. The vectors can not only protect mRNA from nuclease degradation and increase mRNA stability in plasma, but also deliver it into the target cells and organs. Therefore, many efforts have been made to explore safe and efficient mRNA delivery systems, including viral and non-viral vectors. Despite the high efficacy in mRNA delivery, viral vectors are prone to induce harmful immune-mediated responses, unwanted incorporation and other toxic side effects [16]. Non-viral synthetic vectors avoid these risks and offer unique safety advantages over viral vectors. During the past decade, a variety of non-viral mRNA delivery vehicles have emerged, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [17], polymers [18] and inorganic nanoparticles [19]. Lipid nanoparticles are the most promising non-viral vectors, and all the clinically approved mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 utilized the LNPs\u2019 delivery platforms. LNPs are typically comprised of four components, ionizable cationic lipid, helper lipid, phospholipid and polyethylene glycol lipid. The structure of LNPs resembles the bilayer of the cell membrane and mRNA-loaded LNPs can be internalized into cells via the endocytosis pathway. Then mRNA-loaded LNPs accumulated in the endosome and gradually fused\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 477. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15020477 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 477 2 of 10\nwith the endosomal membrane, which enables the mRNA to escape from the endosomal compartments and be released into the cytoplasm to initiate the translation. Of the four components in LNPs formulation, ionizable cationic lipids play the most critical role. Ionizable cationic lipids interact with mRNA payloads by electrostatic complexation and are prone to be protonated, due to the low pH value in the endosome, destabilizing the membrane of LNPs and facilitating the endosomal escape of mRNA. Disulfide bonds have been widely used as biodegradable motifs for prodrugs and fluorescent probes [20,21], but this strategy seldom appeared in the development of lipids. Xu and coworkers have designed many lipid-like compounds containing disulfide bonds, but the synthetic route is complex [22\u201325]. Here, we design a library of disulfide bond-containing cationic lipids and use them to prepare LNPs with DSPC, Cholesterol and DMG-PEG 2000, following standard four-component formulation, which can serve as a high-efficiency mRNA delivery platform (Figure 1).\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 10\nare typically comprised of four components, ionizable cationic lipid, helper lipid, phos-\npholipid and polyethylene glycol lipid.

Normally, an ionizable lipid embodies three parts, the hydrophilic head, the hydrophobic tails and the joint group between them. Many chemical groups have been integrated into the lipid as a linkage, such as acetal, ester, amide and so on [17,18,27]. The disulfides are naturally occurring and have good biocompatibility. Therefore, it is promising to introduce disulfide bonds into lipids. Starting from the commercially available dimercaprol, we established a library of disulfide bond-containing lipids by employing a series of thiols with variable carbon chains as hydrophobic tails and different kinds of amines as heads. The pivotal intermediate 2 (Figure 2a) was obtained via the activation of the sulfhydryl group in the presence of 2,2\u2019-di-thiodipyridine (PySSPy) [28]. With enough common intermediate 2 in hand, it was attacked by an array of nucleophilic thiols (10, 12, 14, 16, 18 carbons alkyl chains) and the disulfide bond was formed to give 3; then, the desired disulfide lipid 1 was achieved through an esterification reaction with the aid of EDCI as a coupling reagent. All the lipids were prepared by employing these standard synthetic procedures. The hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails of the new lipids were shown in Figure 2b,c. The tails are termed as S and the numbers behind them are referred to the number of carbons. \u201cC\u201d stands for the ionizable head part of the lipid, the figure behind \u2018\u2019C\u201d meaning the number of carbons between the ester bond and the nearest nitrogen bond. The structures of the synthesized lipids were confirmed by NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy."

            "text": "After obtaining enough ionizable cationic lipids, we started to prepare the LNPs. The preliminary screening of the lipids was processed via the preparation of empty LNPs and the measurement of the physicochemical properties and stability. The four components (the disulfide ionizable lipid, cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and PEGylated lipids) were dissolved in ethanol in the molar ratios of 50:38.5:10:1.5, respectively, then, LNPs were prepared by using a microfluidic device as previously demonstrated [27]. The size of the LNPs was in the range of 50~130 nm (Table 1). LNPs obtained from saturated alkyl chain tails were liable to decompose and the storage life was less than 3 days at 4 \u25e6C (Entry 1\u20137), which is unsuitable for mRNA delivery. Linoleoyl tail is widely exploited in the development of excellent lipids, such as DLin-MC3-DMA, in which there are two double bonds [26]. The degree of unsaturation has been shown to influence mRNA delivery and stability. Next, we tried to use the unsaturated linoleic acid-derived lipid C4S18A (Entry 8) and oleic acid-derived lipid C4S18B (Entry 9) to produce LNPs, and they both showed better stability in comparison with the alkyl counterpart C4S18. C4S18A formulation shows evenly distributed, as identified by polydispersity index (PDI < 0.2); then, using the optimal\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 477 5 of 10\nS18A tail, we screened different hydrophilic heads to optimize the lipids. These LNPs (Entry 10\u201316) are stable for more than 3 days at 4 \u25e6C. Subsequently, five homogeneous LNP formulations (Entry 8, 10, 11, 14 and 16) were singled out to package the firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA with the N/P ratio of 7:1. The size of the resulting LNPs fluctuated between 80 nm and 120 nm, and PDI was usually less than 0.2 (Figure 3a), along with the zeta potential ranging from \u22121.5 to \u22126.0 mV (Figure 3b), which meets the requirement for the nano-drugs. Furthermore, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) was tested in the presence of Ribogreen, with all the EE over 85% (Figure 3c). For example, C4S18A-derived LNPs has a size of 115.0 nm and PDI of 0.133 (Figure 3d). A direct illustration of LNPs size of C4S18A was displayed by cryo-electron microscopy in Figure 3e. Next, we tried to confirm the Fluc-mRNA expression efficacy by incubating the mRNA-LNP in 293T cells in a 24-well plate. C3S18A, C3BS18A and C3DS18A gave lower luminance intensity compared with the commercial transfection reagent lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo), while the intensity of C4S18A and C4AS18A is higher than Lipo (Figure 3f). Subsequently, we prepared LNPs with different N/P ratios using C4S18A (Figure S1) and the highest luciferase protein expression (Figure 3g) was detected at an N/P ratio of 7/1. As shown in Figure 3h, the treatment of LNPs prepared by C4S18A with GSH in different concentrations ranging from 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 M to 32 \u00d7 10\u22123 M results in EE change, implicating different degree of mRNA release. No significant change of EE occurs when the GSH concentration is below 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 M, referring to that there exists a balance between the degradation and selfassembly. The balance indirectly verifies the good stability of our new LNPs. The speed of the mRNA release is dramatically accelerated as the GSH concentration over 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 M, until the next balance is formed with the GSH concentration over 16 \u00d7 10\u22123 M. In a word, EE experiments reveal that the intracellular reductive environment can trigger our LNPs degradation and facilitate intracellular mRNA release.

Next, we measured\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 477 6 of 10\nthe apparent pKa of C4S18A LNPs using the fluorescence intensity of 2-(p-toluidino)-6naphthalene sulfonic acid (TNS). The pKa of LNP is an important parameter for the cationic lipid and most of the efficient cationic lipids are characterized by apparent pKa values between 6 and 7 [29]. The pKa of C4S18A LNPs was determined to be 6.17 by a curve fit (Figure 4d). Moreover, we surveyed the toxicity of LNPs to cells and cell counting kit\u22128 (CCK8) assays were performed in 293T and HepG2 cells (Figure 4e). Cells were incubated with LNPs at a high concentration of 16 and 32 uM. We did not observe any toxicity, and cell viability was always more than 90%, compared to the PBS blank control, which confirmed the good biocompatibility and safety of our lipids.\nTable 1.
