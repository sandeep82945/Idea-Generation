 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Exploring different relation representations beyond strings, such as structured embeddings, to allow for more flexible matching between relations. This could improve handling of paraphrases. 

2. Incorporating more structured knowledge sources like ontologies or knowledge graphs to augment the commonsense knowledge. This could improve coverage of entities and relations.

3. Developing methods to handle higher-order relations beyond binary relations between entity pairs. This could allow capturing more complex analogies. 

4. Designing algorithms that can take even less restrictive input, such as only domain names or single entity pairs. This would make the approach more widely applicable.

5. Evaluating the approach on analogical reasoning in different domains such as science, engineering, business etc. This could demonstrate the versatility of the method.
