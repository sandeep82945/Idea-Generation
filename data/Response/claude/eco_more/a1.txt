 Here are 5 possible future research directions based on the paper:

1. Extend the results to multi-dimensional domains. The paper focuses on a one-dimensional domain, but many real-world facility location problems are multi-dimensional. It would be interesting to study how the scaling function affects strategyproofness and approximation ratios in higher dimensions.

2. Consider different objectives besides total cost and maximum cost. Other objectives like median cost or fairness constraints could lead to different insights. Approximation algorithms and lower bounds can be derived.

3. Explore randomized and non-deterministic mechanisms. The paper focuses on deterministic mechanisms. Randomization could help improve approximation ratios or achieve strategyproofness under broader conditions.

4. Characterize optimal mechanisms for general agent preferences induced by scaling functions. The paper provides some initial results, but further characterizing the space of strategyproof, anonymous, or optimal mechanisms is an open question. 

5. Apply the scaling function model to other facility location settings like obnoxious facilities or capacitated facilities. The scaling factor could represent how undesirable or constrained a facility is at different locations. This may require adapting existing characterizations and algorithms.
