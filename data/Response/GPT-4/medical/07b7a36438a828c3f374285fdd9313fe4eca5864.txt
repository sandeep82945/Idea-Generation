Comparative Studies Across Different Regions and Healthcare Systems: Investigate how LBP care seeking behaviors have been affected in different geographical regions with varying healthcare systems. This would involve conducting similar studies in countries with distinct socioeconomic statuses, healthcare infrastructure, and pandemic responses to understand the broader impacts on LBP care seeking and identify effective strategies for managing such crises globally.

Longitudinal Studies on the Long-term Effects of Pandemic Restrictions on LBP Outcomes: Conduct longitudinal research to assess the long-term effects of decreased care seeking for LBP during pandemic restrictions. This research would follow individuals over several years to understand the progression of LBP and related disabilities due to delayed or inadequate care, providing insights into the consequences of healthcare disruptions caused by pandemics or similar large-scale emergencies.

Intervention Studies on Telehealth and Digital Health Solutions: Given the observed decrease in care seeking due to pandemic restrictions, there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and digital health interventions for managing LBP. Future studies could focus on developing, implementing, and assessing remote care models, including virtual consultations and digital exercise programs, to understand their effectiveness, accessibility, and patient satisfaction compared to traditional in-person care.

Research on Public Health Campaigns and Education to Improve Care Seeking: Explore the impact of targeted public health campaigns and educational programs on improving LBP care seeking behavior, especially during times of healthcare system strain. Such studies could examine the role of information dissemination, pain management education, and the promotion of self-care practices in encouraging timely and appropriate care seeking among individuals suffering from LBP.

Studies on the Psychological and Socioeconomic Factors Influencing Care Seeking: Deepen the investigation into the role of psychological and socioeconomic factors on LBP care seeking behavior, particularly in the context of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research could aim to identify specific barriers and facilitators to care seeking, including mental health issues, financial constraints, and cultural beliefs about pain and healthcare, to develop tailored interventions that address these factors and promote better LBP management outcomes.
