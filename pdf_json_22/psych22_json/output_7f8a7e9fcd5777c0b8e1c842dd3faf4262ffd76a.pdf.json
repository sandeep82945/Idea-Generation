Most research on the topic is conducted in clinical populations, with few studies exploring this association across the general population.\nAims We investigated the association between specific domains of alcohol use and suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm in a general population sample.\nMethod A total of 14 949 adults who completed the 2007 or 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were included. We measured alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Domains of alcohol use relating to risk categories, weekly consumption, binge drinking, dependence symptoms, harmful effects and concern from others were derived from relevant AUDIT items. Self-reported past year suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm were measured with the Clinical Interview Schedule, Revised.\nResults We found a linear association between total AUDIT score and outcomes. Three of six specific domains of alcohol use (dependence symptoms, harmful effects of drinking and binge\ndrinking) were associated with increased odds of all three outcomes. There was no association of outcomes with the other domains of alcohol use.\nConclusions We found evidence of a linear association between total AUDIT score and suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm in a representative English general population sample. Our analyses suggest that where alcohol use significantly disrupts day-to-day functioning, this may underpin the relationship between alcohol use and suicide-related outcomes to a greater extent than higher alcohol consumption. Longitudinal research is needed to further understand these relationships.\nKeywords Suicide; alcohol disorders; epidemiology; self-harm; depressive disorders.\nCopyright and usage \u00a9 The Author(s), 2022.

Only one study12 to date looked at an association between increasingly harmful alcohol use and suicidal behaviour in an adult general population sample. This Korean-based population survey reported evidence that increasingly harmful alcohol use, as measured by categorised Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score, was associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in women, but not men. Others have inferred associations between harmful alcohol use, as measured by increasing alcohol consumption, and suicide, with mixed conclusions.13,14\nMany studies investigating alcohol use and suicidal behaviour in the general population use binary risk groups to describe alcohol use,15,16 but this line of enquiry does not clarify how levels of disor-\ndered or risky alcohol use and alcohol-related problems relate to suicidal and self-harming behaviour. Although some studies have adoptedmore nuancedmeasures of alcohol use and suicidal behaviour, they have relied on samples of older or middle-aged adults,13,14,17 or individuals presenting to hospital following suicidal behaviour,7,15 and are therefore prone to selection bias. Furthermore, many studies in the field fail to adjust for comorbid psychiatric conditions,13,14,17,18 which is an important potential confounder of the relationship between alcohol and suicidal behaviour.19"

These captured risk categories (low-/moderate-/high-risk alcohol use) and other aspects of harmful alcohol use behaviour: drinking quantity and frequency, binge drinking, dependence symptoms, harmful effects of drinking and concern from others about drinking.\nHarmful alcohol use was measured with scores on the ten-item AUDIT.23 The AUDIT assesses alcohol consumption, drinking behaviours and alcohol-related problems over the past year, and was designed as a screening tool to identify and describe a broader spectrum of problematic drinking than alcoholism or alcohol use disorder.23 A list of AUDIT items is provided in Supplementary Table 1 available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo. 2022.594. For our primary analyses, we used total AUDIT score as a continuous measure.\nRisk categories were captured by categorising AUDIT scores into clinically meaningful risk categories, as consistent with World Health Organization guidelines,24 such that a score of 0\u20137 was considered \u2018low-risk alcohol use\u2019, a score of 8\u201315 was considered \u2018moderate-risk alcohol use\u2019 and a score of \u226516 was considered \u2018high-risk alcohol use\u2019.\nDrinking quantity and frequency was derived from two AUDIT items relating to the frequency and quantity of drinking, both using range-based categories. Using these two variables, we derived a product that used mid-range values to estimate the average number of drinks consumed in a typical drinking week, in an approach suggested by Berlin et al.25 Estimated average drinks\nconsumed per week were then grouped such that zero to six drinks is categorised as \u2018light drinking\u2019, seven to 13 drinks is \u2018moderate drinking\u2019, 14\u201320 drinks is \u2018hazardous drinking\u2019, 21\u201330 drinks is \u2018harmful drinking\u2019 and >30 drinks is \u2018probable dependence\u2019.26\nBinge drinking was measured by a single AUDIT item: \u2018How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion?\u2019. Responses were grouped as an episode of binge drinking \u2018less than monthly or never\u2019, \u2018monthly\u2019, \u2018weekly\u2019 and \u2018daily or almost daily\u2019.\nDependence symptoms were measured by summing the scores of three AUDIT items that asked about inability to stop drinking, failure to meet normal expectations because of drinking and feeling a need for drink after a heavy session. Scores for dependence symptoms ranged from 0 to 12.\nHarmful effects of drinking were measured with three AUDIT items that captured drink-related guilt, drink-related memory loss and alcohol-related injury. The alcohol-related injury item score was coded as a binary measure, with lifetime or past year involvement in an alcohol-related injury both coded as one, and reporting no history of alcohol-related injury coded as zero. Scores for these three variables were summed to give a score for harmful effects of drinking, ranging from 0 to 10.\nConcern from others about drinking was measured by a single AUDIT item asking if anyone, professional or personal, had expressed concerns about drinking. Participants were coded positive for \u2018concern from others about drinking\u2019 if they reported ever having received expressions of concern from others."

For our main analysis, we used total AUDIT score (continuous) to investigate whether there is a linear association between AUDIT score and outcomes. To investigate associations of our three outcomes with other domains of alcohol use, we ran models with categorical measures of drinking risk category (low-/moderate-/high-risk alcohol use) and of five specific domains of alcohol use.

Missing data were imputed by using multiple imputation by chained equation.32 To impute, we used all variables from the final model, and included ethnicity as an auxiliary variable; ten data-sets were imputed. We ran an interaction test for the outcomes with survey year as the moderating variable, and no difference was detected, thus indicating no detectable difference in this relationship between the two samples and supporting their amalgamation. In a sensitivity analysis, we re-ran our main models on the complete-case sample. We ran a further post hoc sensitivity analysis to explore the confounding effect of self-reported mental health conditions as distinct from that of all other listed confounding variables.

This association was attenuated when sociodemographic and clinical covariates were added to the model, but strong evidence of an association remained (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.09).

Using the AUDIT score as a continuous measure, there was an association between total AUDIT score and non-suicidal selfharm in the unadjusted model (odds ratio 1.08, 95% CI 1.05\u2013 1.12), and this effect was weakened but remained after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.08).\nNeither gender nor age modified any of these associations (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, Supplementary Figs 1\u20133).\nAssociation between AUDIT score risk categories and suicidal behaviour\nResults for the univariable and multivariable analyses assessing the relationship between grouped AUDIT score and suicidal behaviour\n2007 collection 2014 collection\nAsked face to face?\nAsked in selfreport questionnaire?

Daily or almost daily binge drinking, dependence symptom score and harmful effects of alcohol use score were all associated with increased odds of suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm. The remaining alcohol use domains were inconsistently associated with suicidal behaviour. For drinking quantity and frequency, the highest consumption group had increased odds of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts, but no associations with non-suicidal self-harm were observed. Similarly, concern from others about drinking was associated with suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts, but not with non-suicidal selfharm.

We were also able to investigate whether risk categories and specific domains of alcohol use were differently associated with suicidal behaviour. These latter analyses revealed that, as anticipated, markers of extreme and harmful use of alcohol (dependence symptoms, harmful effects of alcohol, concern from others about drinking and daily or almost daily binge drinking) were all associated with suicidal behaviours. No other consistent patterns emerged between the outcomes and the other recorded domains of alcohol use. Upon adjustment for a range of a priori demographic, social and psychiatric confounders, we observed a noticeable attenuation of the strength of the association between alcohol use and suicidal behaviour, although independent effects remained even in the mutually adjusted model. This suggests that there are possible direct associations between harmful alcohol use and self-harm or suicidal behaviour, and between specific alcohol-related behaviours and these outcomes, which are not explained by these other observed factors.\nTable 2 Association between total Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores and suicidal behaviours\nUnadjusted model, odds ratio (95% CI)\nFully adjusted model,a\nodds ratio (95% CI)\nSuicide attempts 1.11 (1.08\u20131.14) 1.06 (1.03\u20131.09) Suicidal thoughts 1.07 (1.06\u20131.10) 1.05 (1.03\u20131.07) Non-suicidal self-harm 1.08 (1.05\u20131.12) 1.04 (1.01\u20131.08)\nN = 14 949. a.

            "text": "Previous research on linear associations between harmful alcohol use and suicidal behaviour has reported inconsistent findings, perhaps because of the heterogeneity of measures, drinking cultures and study populations. Most studies in this area report on suicidal thoughts and death by suicide as outcomes, with fewer reporting on the relationship between alcohol use and suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-harm. To our knowledge, only one previous study has looked at the linear relationship between alcohol use and suicidal behaviour in a general population adult sample.12 This cross-sectional study in a Korean adult sample reported no clear relationship between AUDIT scores (categorised by increasing risk groups) and suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in men, but evidence of a relationship in women.12 This is not wholly consistent with our findings, which did not reveal any clear gender interactions. Gender differences in the relationship between alcohol use and suicide have been reported,20 although this finding is not consistent, even at the level of alcohol dependence.33 In a UK-based psychiatric in-patient sample, higher AUDIT scores were associated with suicidal behaviour,7 as consistent with our findings, although this study compared differing cut-off points in a binary measure rather than our more nuanced use of different domains of the AUDIT tool.\nWe found no statistical evidence for an association between drinking quantity and frequency and suicide attempts, although when investigated categorically, the highest consumption group did show evidence of an increased odds of suicidal behaviour. This finding appears to be consistent with the few studies that have attempted to investigate quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption and risk of suicidal behaviour. A Korean study investigating the relationship between frequency of drinking and quantity consumed per drinking day and risk of suicidal behaviour found no association.12 A USA-based study that used a representative general population sample found no association between alcohol use frequency (measured as total number of drinking days in the past year) and suicidal ideation or attempt.34 Similarly, another USA-based study found no association between average drinks consumed and suicidal death among a sample of professional men aged 40\u201375 years.18 In a sample of elderly Australian adults, consuming alcohol less frequently, but in greater quantities (i.e. bingeing), increased risk of suicidal attempt.35 Binge drinking has been shown to be associated with suicidal behaviour.36 In our English sample, it appeared that weekly binge drinking did not increase the odds of either suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. This could be a reflection of the culture of heavy drinking in the UK, with one of the highest frequencies of binge drinking in Europe.37 Only one previous study has investigated the specific domains of alcohol use used in our analysis. In a Korean sample, increased frequency of drinking blackout was associated with\nsuicidal ideation and attempt in men,12 which corresponds with the increased odds of suicidal thoughts associated with harmful effects of drinking score seen in our sample. These domains of dependence behaviours and harmful effects of drinking alcohol are those that may be more meaningful to the general public, and could be identified as clinical targets when working with patients to reduce risky drinking behaviour. Our analyses suggest that dependence-related behaviours and harmful effects of alcohol use, rather than consumption patterns, may potentially be the key underlying factor in the relationship between alcohol use and suicidal behaviour."

We have been careful to limit the timeframe for outcomes by only considering past year suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-harm, which relate closely to the timeframe for the AUDIT questionnaire of the past year. However, a longitudinal analysis is needed to rule out any potential reverse causation for the associations observed. Although it is possible that samples from 2007 and 2014 might overlap, this is likely to be negligible, given random sampling for both.We acknowledge the possibility of residual confounding as we lacked variables that allowed us to identify and control for previous suicide attempt, one of the most recognised predictors of suicide attempt, which is also associated with harmful alcohol use. We recognise that mental health conditions could be considered as a confounder or a mediator in the association between alcohol use and suicidal behaviours. Because of the cross-sectional nature of this data-set, it was not possible to conduct a mediation analysis, and future research using an appropriate longitudinal data-set should investigate this in a population-based sample. We also acknowledge the potential for underascertainment of outcomes, as suicidal thoughts and attempt were both reported in the CIS-R face-to-face interviews. It is possible that some people, and particularly those from backgrounds with more stigmatising views toward suicidal behaviours, would choose not to disclose such sensitive information. Lastly, our use of specific domains of alcohol use as exposures deviates from the established subscales of the AUDIT questionnaire. Recent reviews of the composition of the AUDIT questionnaire challenge the two-factor structure,38,39 the conclusions of which support our breakdown of the AUDIT items into separate domains. We see this pragmatic breakdown of the AUDIT\n5 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.594 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nquestionnaire as a strength of this study, in that it creates a series of clinically useful components of alcohol use, which would be meaningful to members of the public. However, we acknowledge that using this set of outcomes and conductingmultiple testing increased the likelihood of reporting a type 1 error.\nImplications for policy, practice and future research\nAlcohol misuse is a compelling modifiable risk factor for both suicide and non-suicidal self-harm, and effective treatment for alcohol misuse and dependence exists.39,40,41 Our study provides further support that populations who are at increasing risk of alcohol misuse are also at a higher risk of suicidal behaviour. Although this study did not measure suicide as an outcome, attempted suicide and non-suicidal self-harm are established risk factors for future suicide attempts and suicidal death.8,42,43 Regular monitoring of alcohol use by clinicians, and inquiring about suicidal behaviour in anyone who reports harmful drinking or concerning changes in their drinking, could be an effective measure for identifying people at high risk of suicide, requiring selective suicide prevention. Furthermore, our analyses identified simple domains of alcohol misuse, such as others\u2019 concerns about drinking, which can be readily understood by the public and targeted, perhaps through motivational interviewing,40 to reduce risk of future suicidal behaviour.\nLongitudinal research is needed to further support these findings empirically and ascertain potential causal associations, in addition to gaining insights into which groups of alcohol users in the general population would be most at risk for suicidal behaviours. Shifting the research focus from binge drinking to other dimensions of alcohol use may be warranted, subject to the availability of sufficiently nuanced data. Qualitative research exploring drinking motives and contexts for alcohol consumption may further enhance our understanding of the role of alcohol use behaviours and links with suicidal and self-harming behaviour.\nSarah Ledden , Division of Psychiatry, University College London, UK; Paul Moran , Centre for Academic Mental Health, University of Bristol, UK; and National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and University of Bristol, UK; David Osborn , Division of Psychiatry, University College London, UK; and Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital, UK; Alexandra Pitman , Division of Psychiatry, University College London, UK; and Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital, UK\nCorrespondence: Sarah Ledden.
