    "abstractText": "Selaginella doederleinii Hieron. (S. doederleinii) is a traditional herb that is widely used in China to treat several ailments, but mainly cancer. Studies have been carried out to determine the phytochemicals ascribed to its pharmacological activity. However, both phytochemical and pharmacological profiles have not been fully explored as few compounds have been reported. This study evaluated the flavonoid content of the ethanol extract and its four fractions (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) together with their antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP assays). Further, the antiproliferative activity was evaluated. Two new secondary metabolites (1 and 3) were isolated from S. doederleinii, which comprised of an apigenin skeleton with a phenyl attached at C-8 of ring A and an acetyl group. Additionally, other known metabolites 2 and 4\u201316 were isolated, whereby compounds 2, 4, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 16 were reported for the first time in this species. These compounds were evaluated for their antioxidative potentials by both DPPH and FRAP assays, and for their antiproliferative activities by the MTT assay on three human cancer cell lines: colon cancer (HT-29), cervical cancer (HeLa), and lung cancer (A549). Compound 7 exhibited the best activity on the three cancer cell lines (HT-29, HeLa, A549) by inhibiting the rate of growth of the cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 27.97, 35.47, and 20.71 \u03bcM, respectively. The structure\u2013activity relationship of the pure compounds was highlighted in this study. Hence, the study enriched both the phytochemical and pharmacological profiles of S. doederleinii.",

            "text": "Cancer has persistently remained a global health concern by claiming many human lives [1]. In some developed countries, cancer incidences and the rate of mortality for many cancers have been reported to be decreasing. However, in developing countries, both morbidity and mortality rates are escalating at an alarming rate [2]. Screening and developing new anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs have remained an urgent approach in cancer management and mitigation [3]. Additionally, since a number of these phytochemicals\u2019 solubility in water is poor, studies on the administration of plant extracts and pure isolated compounds to the delivery system are imperative. This would amplify their oral bioavailability and control the release of the drug payloads [4]. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in detrimental body health. They are chemical molecules that enclose oxygen in the form of superoxide hydroxyl radicals, peroxides, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, which are generated by biological reactions in humans [5]. The production of ROS is usually in concentrations\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1189. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11061189 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1189 2 of 16\nof picomolar and, when produced in excess amounts, they are neutralized in the body by the antioxidant system [6]. However, sometimes an imbalance between the ROS production and antioxidant protection system happens, hence there is oxidative stress [5], which potentially causes diseases such as diabetes and cancers [7,8]. To mitigate this, the intake of antioxidants that directly scavenge the free radicals or turn on molecules and enzymes that stimulate redox homeostasis can protect body cells from ROS-induced damage [9,10]. Natural antioxidants have increasingly attracted research focus as synthetic antioxidants have been associated with adverse effects on humans [11]. Additionally, anticancer agents derived from natural resources have been developed and approved to treat various types of cancer [12]. Therefore, phytochemicals are plant-based chemical constituents that occur naturally [13]. More than ten thousand phytochemicals have been identified and found to be of health benefits to humans in treating and reducing the risk of infection from several diseases [14,15]. Therefore, many researchers are focusing on naturally occurring phytochemicals for cancer treatment and prevention [3]. Selaginella doederleinii Hieron., commonly referred to as \u201cda ye cai\u201d and \u201cshi shang bai\u201d [16] in China, belongs to the genus Selaginella and family Selaginellaceae [17,18]. In China, the herb is distributed in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces [19,20]. Traditionally, S. doederleinii has been used to treat cardiovascular disease [21], cancer [22,23], sore throat, and rheumatoid arthritis [24]. The decoction from this plant is normally prepared by boiling the whole plant in water. Owing to its traditional uses, studies evaluating its phytochemical and pharmacological properties have been carried out. The phytochemical studies of this species have revealed that it is composed of mainly biflavonoids [18,25], lignans [21], and alkaloids [26]; as well, Zou et al. [19] reported eight uncommon triflavonoids. Continued phytochemical research has led to the isolation of compounds with a unique apigenin skeleton structure and a phenyl attached at C-8 of ring A of the apigenin skeleton and flavonoids [27]. Pharmacological studies of S. doederleinii have revealed its antiproliferative [28\u201330], antioxidant [31,32], and antiAlzheimer [19] activities. However, both phytochemical and pharmacological profiles of S. doederleinii have not been fully explored. More studies on the isolation and identification of novel compounds with significant biological activities are regarded as necessary as only a few compounds have been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the phytochemical constituents of S. doederleinii and evaluate its antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. To this end, the antioxidant potential of the ethanol extract, its fractions, and isolated compounds were evaluated by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assays. The antiproliferative activities for both the ethanol extract, its fractions, and isolated compounds were evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay on three different human cancer cell lines: HT-29, Hela, and A549. Additionally, the study highlighted the structure\u2013activity relationship of the evaluated compounds."

Accordingly, for a better understanding and exploration of this species towards cancer, the DCM fraction was selected for isolation work to identify the responsible bioactive phytochemicals.\nFigure 3.

Besides the tri-substituted benzene ring (ring D), the remaining signals disclosed that Compound 1 had a flavonoid skeleton. The singlet proton at \u03b4H 6.60 (H-6) suggested that ring A could be substituted either at C-6 or C-8, and the HMBC studies have shown that the 1,2,5-trisubstituted benzene ring (ring D) was linked to C-8 by the correlation from \u03b4H 7.93 to \u03b4C 105.6 (C-8). It was concluded that compound 1 was an apigenin derivative and the chemical structure was determined as 3-(5-hydroxy-7methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl)-4-methoxybenzoic acid. Compound 3 was isolated as a yellow amorphous powder. Through HR-ESI-MS (positive ion mode) analysis, a molecular ion peak appeared at m/z 419.1121 [M + H]+ (calculated for [M+H]+ 419.1125) (Figure S10), indicating a molecular formula of C24H18O7 for 3, which was per the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 3, Figures S11 and S12). The 1H NMR data of 3 displayed the presence of a 1,2,5-trisubstituted benzene moiety (ring D) at \u03b4H 8.01 (1H, dd, J = 8.4, 2.3 Hz, H-4\u2032\u2032), 7.99 (1H, d, J = 2.2 Hz, H-6\u2032\u2032),\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1189 9 of 16\nand 7.08 (1H, d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-3\u2032\u2032), and was supported by the corresponding 13C NMR data (Table 3 and Figure S12). The singlet methyl group at \u03b4H 2.57 (3H, s, H-8\u2032\u2032), along with the carbonyl carbon at \u03b4C 199.6, revealed an acetyl group that, based on the HMBC correlation of H-4\u2032\u2032 and H-8\u2032\u2032 to C-7\u2032\u2032 (Figure 5), was attached to C-5\u2032\u2032 of ring D. Additionally, an AA\u2032XX\u2032 coupling system signal at \u03b4H 7.64 (2H, d, J = 8.9 Hz, H-2\u2032/6\u2032) and 6.94 (2H, d, J = 8.9 Hz, H-3\u2032/5\u2032) indicated the para-substitution of ring B, and the two aromatic singlets at \u03b4H 6.68 and 6.40 were assigned to H-3 and H-6, respectively. All 24 carbons were displayed in the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure S12), which included 15 carbons for the apigenin skeleton, 6 for the phenyl (ring D), 2 for the acetyl group at \u03b4C 199.6 and 26.9, and 1 for the methoxyl at \u03b4C 56.0. The HMBC spectrum (Figure S16) displayed the presence of a C-1\u2032\u2032-C-8 linkage in ring D and A by correlations from H-6\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 7.99) to C-8 (\u03b4C 105.4), which confirmed that C-8 was the point of attachment of ring D to the apigenin skeleton. A methoxyl group was attached at C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 164.3) in ring B of the apigenin skeleton as it displayed HMBC correlations from \u03b4H 3.84 (OMe) to C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 164.3). At C-2\u2032\u2032 in phenyl (ring D), a hydroxyl was attached as shown by HMBC correlations from H-4\u2032\u2032/6\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 8.01, 7.99) to C-2\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4C 163.3), as shown in Figure 5 as well as the downfield shift resonance of C-2\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4C 163.3) by 31.0 ppm.

Antioxidant Activities of Isolated Compounds from S. doederleinii The isolated compounds from S. doederleinii were evaluated for their antioxidant activity by DPPH and FRAP assays. All the examined compounds exhibited radical scavenging abilities at different concentrations with the lowest and highest concentrations of 6.25 and 100 \u00b5M, respectively, as shown in Figure 6. Compound 14 expressed the best antioxidant activity among the tested compounds with an IC50 value of 89.3 \u00b1 4.0 \u00b5M, while the positive control (Vitamin C) had an IC50 value of 20.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5M. The radical scavenging ability of the isolated compounds from S. doederleinii is attributed to the hydroxy groups in their structures, which donate a hydrogen atom to neutralize the free radicals, hence suppressing their oxidation potentials. The tested compounds expressed close free radical scavenging abilities even at the highest concentration of 100 \u00b5M, except compound 14 which had a higher value as compared to the rest. The FRAP assay results (Figure 7) also revealed that compound 14 exhibited the highest ferric reducing ability with a value of 1.4 \u00b1 0.03 mM Fe2+/g, followed by compound 4 with a value of 1.1 \u00b1 0.02 mmol Fe2+/g, which also exhibited the second highest DPPH radical scavenging rate at concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Vitamin C was used as the positive control on the FRAP assay and it exhibited an ion-reducing capacity with a value of 7.8 \u00b1 1.2 mM Fe2+/g. The antioxidant activity of the isolated compounds from S. doederleinii has not been reported before, hence our work reports this for the first time. Flavonoids derived from plants have been reported to be strong antioxidants [56]. Bedir et al. [44] evaluated the antioxidant activity of flavonoids and four biflavonoids (Amentoflavone, Bilobetin, Ginkgetin, and Sciadopitysin). The flavonoids exhibited noble antioxidant activity. However, none of the four biflavonoids evaluated exhibited strong antioxidant activity. Another study by Or\u010di\u0107 et al. [57] revealed low antioxidant activity of biflavonoids isolated from Hypericum perforatum species, whereas the monomer flavonoids exhibited strong antioxidant activities. Previous studies in the same species had reported low antioxidant activities of isolated biflavonoids. This is in support of our findings, whereby flavonoid compound 14 exhibited the strongest\nFigure 5. Main 1H-1H COSY and HMBC correlations of compounds 1, 3, 4 and 5.\nCompound 4 was obtained as a yellow amorphous powder and HR-ESI-MS exhibited a molecular peak at m/z 433.1276 [M + H]+ (calculated for 433.1282) with the molecular formula C25H20O7, which corresponded to the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 3). By comparing the 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of compound 3 to that of 4, it was observed that there was an additional methoxyl that was attached at C-2\u2032\u2032 of ring D, according to the HMBC correlations from \u03b4H 3.82 to C-2\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4C 163.3). The structure of compound 4 was thus determined as 8-(5-acetyl-2-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4methoxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one [43]. This is the first time its spectroscopic data and its isolation from natural resources have been reported. Compound 5 was isolated as a yellow powder. It shared the same skeleton structure with compounds 3 and 4 but with three methoxy groups. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data gave the molecular formula as C26H22O7. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic data (Table 3) of 5 closely resembled that of 4, except that the hydroxyl at C-7 of ring A was substituted by a methoxy group. The HMBC studies of this compound indicated that the three methoxy groups are attached at C-7, C-4\u2032, and C-2\u2032\u2032, as indicated in Figure 5. Hence, compound 5 was determined as 8-(5-acetyl-2-methoxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2-(4methoxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one [43]. The spectroscopic data of 5 is also being reported for the first time in this study, as well as its isolation from natural resources. The structures of 12 other known compounds, 2 and 6\u201316, were established by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature as 3-(5,7- dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl)-4-methoxy-benzoic acid (2) [44], Sequoiaflavone (6) [45], 7,7\u2032\u2032-dimethyl ether amentoflavone (7) [22], 2,3-dihydro-4\u2032 \u2032 \u2032-methyl ether amentoflavone (8) [46], 2,3-dihydro-7,4\u2032-dimethyl ether amentoflavone (9) [47], 2\u2032\u2032,3\u2032\u2032- Dihydroamentoflavone (10) [48], 4\u2032,4\u2032 \u2032 \u2032-dimethyl ether robustaflavone (11) [47], 2,3-dihydro4\u2032-methyl ether robustaflavone (12) [49], 5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (13) [50], thevetiaflavone (14) [51,52], 2\u2032\u2032,3\u2032\u2032-dihydrohinokiflavone (15) [53], and 7\u2032\u2032-methyl ether tetrahydrohinokiflavone (16) [54].\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1189 11 of 16\nBiflavonoids are the most common and characteristic compounds of the species S. doederleinii, with a few alkaloids [26], lignan [21], and triflavonoids [19] having been reported. In this study, we isolated five compounds with an apigenin skeleton and a phenyl (ring D) attached at C-8 of the apigenin and an acetyl attached at C-5\u2032\u2032 of ring D. In genus Selaginella, many biflavonoids with a C-C interflavonoid connection at C-8 of apigenin have been reported [55]. By keenly observing compounds 1\u20135, they resemble an amentoflavone (having C3\u2032-C8\u2032\u2032 interflavonoid linkage) derivative without the chromone part of the flavonoid I unit. Therefore, these five compounds could have been derived from these kinds of biflavonoids. Compounds with this kind of structure were first reported by Zou et al. [27] in this species. Four biflavonoids (8, 12, 15, and 16) are being reported for the first time in this species. Additionally, compounds 2, 13, and 14 are reported for the first time in this species too."

            "text": "All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferation activity against three human cancer cell lines: HT-29, HeLa, and A549 by the MTT method. All the compounds showed antiproliferation activity on the three tested cancer cell lines to different degrees. Interestingly, these compounds expressed some level of antiproliferation on cancer cell line A549, which could give an insight into its major traditional use for lung cancer treatment and management. Among the 16 compounds, three (8, 9, 16) expressed the best activity by inhibiting the rate of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner on the three cancer cell lines, and their IC50 values were shown in Table 4. Interestingly, the three were biflavonoids, which have continued to be of interest in the search for cancer drugs [28,58]. Compounds 8 and 16 exhibited noble activities on cancer cell line A549 as compared to their activities on the other cell lines. This affirmed the DCM fraction antiproliferative activity on cancer cell line A549, which exhibited the best activity compared to the other cell lines. Additionally, it supports the main use of this species, which is traditionally in the treatment and management of lung cancer.\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1189 13 of 16"

            "text": "The structure\u2013activity relationship study of our results was interesting, with all compounds exhibiting obvious cytotoxicity on the three cancer cell lines. The two amentoflavone derivatives (8 and 9) exhibited antiproliferation activity, with 8 having the best activity on the HeLa and A549 cancer cell lines and 9 having the best activity on the HT-29 cell line, as shown in Table 4. Compound 8 exhibited better activity than 9, this could be attributed to the OH at C-5,7 of ring A and C-4\u2032 of ring B of the first flavonoid unit as compared to 9, which had OCH3 at C-7,4\u2032. This confirms the importance of OH at C-5,7 of ring A and at C-3\u2032,4\u2032 of ring B [59\u201361]. When comparing the antiproliferation of the hinokiflavone derivatives, compound 16 exhibited more interesting activity than 15 with the best activity on the three human cancer cell lines among the tested compounds. The noble activity of 16 was enhanced by the methoxy group at C-7\u2032\u2032 of ring A of the second flavonoid unit. This was in accordance with Du et al. [62], who established that methylation at ring A enhances the antiproliferative activity of flavones."

            "text": "In this study, the TFC, antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP assays), and antiproliferative potentials of the ethanol extract and its fractions were evaluated. The DCM and EA fractions depicted good potency on the three bioassays. The phytochemical investigation was carried out to identify the phytochemicals responsible for its antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. This resulted in the isolation of 16 compounds, including two new compounds (1 and 3). The isolated compounds were then evaluated for their antioxidative and antiproliferative potentials. All the evaluated compounds exhibited some free radical scavenging ability. Compound 14 expressed the best antioxidant activity on the DPPH assay and the highest ferric reducing antioxidant ability on the FRAP assay. The antiproliferative activity was tested by MTT assay on three human cancer cell lines: HT-29, HeLa, and A549. Compound 16 (7\u2032\u2032-methyl ether Tetrahydrohinokiflavone) exhibited the strongest activity by inhibiting the rate of cell growth in a dose-dependent manner on the three cancer cell lines. Compounds 8 and 16 exhibited noble antiproliferative activities on the A549 cancer cell line, hence they could be promising lung cancer drug candidates. The study has therefore supported the traditional use of S. doederleinii in cancer treatment and identified the bioactive chemical constituents responsible for its pharmacological properties. Additionally, the study has enriched the phytochemical constitution of S. doederleinii as well as its pharmacological profile. However, we strongly suggest more isolation work to expand the phytochemical profile of this species with new compounds of different classes as it has been reported in other species of the genus Selaginella.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox11061189/s1.
