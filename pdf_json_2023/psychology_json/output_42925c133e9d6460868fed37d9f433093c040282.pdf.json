    "abstractText": "Phosphorylation of beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) at the Ser8 residue affects its neurotoxicity, metal-dependent oligomerisation, amyloidogenicity, and other pathogenic properties. Phosphorylated A\u03b2 (pS8-A\u03b2) was detected in vivo in AD model mice and in the brains of patients with AD. However, the pS8-A\u03b2 production and the regulation of its levels have not been previously studied in detail. In this paper, immunochemical methods together with radioactive labelling were used to study the A\u03b2 phosphorylation by intracellular and surface protein kinases of HEK293 cells and brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3). It was found that HEK293 robustly phosphorylated A\u03b2, likely with contribution from casein kinase 2 (CK2), whereas in bEnd.3, the activity of A\u03b2 phosphorylation was relatively low. Further, the study showed that both HEK293 and bEnd.3 could dephosphorylate pS8-A\u03b2, mainly due to the activity of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. The A\u03b2 dephosphorylation efficiency in bEnd.3 was three times higher than in HEK293, which correlated with the reduced abundance of pS8-A\u03b2 in vascular amyloid deposits of patients with AD compared to senile plaques. These data suggest an important role of CK2, PP1, and PP2A as regulators of A\u03b2 phosphorylation, and point to the involvement of the blood\u2013brain barrier in the control of A\u03b2 modification levels.",

            "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, resulting from neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The progression of AD represents a pathological cascade most likely starting with the accumulation and aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) [1,2]. A\u03b2 is produced by the proteolytic cleavage of APP protein, which occurs both at the outer side of the plasma membrane and inside the cell\u2014in the Golgi apparatus and vesicles [3]. A\u03b2 undergoes various post-translational modifications that affect its properties and can either provoke its aggregation and increase neurotoxicity or prevent the manifestation of its pathogenic properties [4,5]. Changes in the levels of different A\u03b2 modifications are associated with AD [6,7], and the study of the role of the modifications is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and develop new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. Phosphorylation of A\u03b2 at Ser8 is a modification found in the brains of patients with AD and Down syndrome [7,8]. In the brains of mice of model lines, early intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated A\u03b2 (pS8-A\u03b2) is observed, which precedes the formation of plaques, and pS8-A\u03b2 has increased direct neurotoxicity in vitro compared to the nonphosphorylated peptide [7,9]. On the other hand, subsequent studies have shown that A\u03b2 phosphorylation prevents its aggregation in the presence of zinc ions, and injections of pS8-A\u03b2 slow down cerebral amyloidogenesis in mouse models of AD [10]. It has been shown that A\u03b2 can be modified in vitro by neuronal surface kinases and by soluble kinases\nLife 2023, 13, 147. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13010147 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\nof the cerebrospinal fluid [11]. The properties of pS8-A\u03b2 make it an important form of the peptide for the pathogenesis of AD; however, the origin of pS8-A\u03b2 in the body and the regulation of its levels have not been studied enough. It is not known whether the formation of pS8-A\u03b2 occurs in the blood, in the brain tissue, or whether its modification occurs during the transport of A\u03b2 across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). When A\u03b2 becomes internalised in cells, it disrupts the functioning of proteasomes and mitochondria [12,13]; however, the A\u03b2 modification by intracellular enzymes remains undetermined. The level of phosphoproteins in the body is associated not only with the activity of kinases, but also with the intensity of dephosphorylation [14]. The possibility of A\u03b2 dephosphorylation by different cells and the key enzymes involved in this process are also unknown. In this work, the research team assessed the phosphorylation of 42 a.a. long A\u03b2 isoform (A\u03b2) under various conditions\u2014inside or on the surface of mouse brain endothelial cells bEnd.3 and the HEK293 cell line\u2014and also probed the possibility of the dephosphorylation of pS8-A\u03b2 by cell phosphatases."

A\u03b242 phosphorylated at Ser8 (pS8-A\u03b2) was purchased from Biopeptide (San Diego, CA, USA). Monomerised aliquots of peptides were prepared as described previously [15]. Before the experiment, a 2.5 mM peptide solution was prepared by adding 20\u00b5L of 100% anhydrous DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Loius, MO, USA) to 0.22 mg of the peptide and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, after which the peptide was diluted to the required concentration with a buffer solution or culture medium. In all experiments, only freshly prepared peptide solutions were used. As shown earlier, in such solutions, more than 80% of A\u03b2 is in the monomeric form [16]. The concentration of diluted aliquots was routinely checked with BCA assay and was insignificantly different between the experiments and between the A\u03b2 and pS8-A\u03b2 preparations."

As shown using specific antibodies to pS8-A\u03b2 (1E4E11) (Figure 1a) and the analysis of 32P inclusion in the corresponding band on SDS-PAGE (Figure 1b), A\u03b2 was indeed phosphorylated by HEK293 lysate. The phosphorylation was observed only in lysates of cells incubated at 37 \u25e6C in the presence of A\u03b2, but not in the absence of lysate, or in samples incubated on ice (Figure 1a,b).\nThe region of A\u03b2 peptide starting with Ser8 residue (Ser8-Gly9-Tyr10-Glu11) coincides with the consensus sequence of CK2 (Ser-X-X-Asp/Glu/pTyr/pTre) [18]. It was hypothesised that CK2 might be involved in the phosphorylation of A\u03b2 by HEK293 cell lysates. First, the research team tested the possibility of A\u03b2 phosphorylation by CK2 using a purified recombinant enzyme. Indeed, in the presence of CK2, A\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser8 residue was observed, which decreased in the presence of a specific inhibitor of CK2, TBBz (Figure 1c). Phosphorylation of A\u03b2 at Ser8 residue with HEK293 cell lysate in the presence of TBBz was decreased by 35% (Figure 1d). Taken together, these data suggest the involvement of CK2 in A\u03b2 phosphorylation at Ser8 residue in HEK293 cells."

            "text": "Extracellular A\u03b2 is able to enter cells through various mechanisms, and the process of its internalisation is important for A\u03b2 transport through the blood\u2013brain barrier, utilisation, and its intracellular effects [19\u201321]. However, the process of A\u03b2 metabolism and modification after the internalisation is not understood well. To study the phosphorylation of internalised A\u03b2, HEK293 cells were cultured for 24 h in phosphate-free Tyrode buffer in the presence of A\u03b2. Then, 32P-phosphoric acid was added to cell media for three hours\u2019 incuba-\ntion. The analysis with specific antibodies did not detect any pS8-A\u03b2 in IP-enriched cell lysates (Figure 2a). Autoradiography analysis of lysates showed the presence of phosphorylated proteins across a broad range of molecular weights; however, bands corresponding to the molecular weight of 125I-labeled A\u03b2 were not detected (Figure 2b). The profile of low-molecular-weight radioactive proteins in A\u03b2-treated and non-treated cell lysates also did not differ (Figure 2b). When cells were treated with synthetic pS8-A\u03b2, it was detected in IP-enriched lysates (Figure 2a), showing that HEK293 are able to internalise A\u03b2, but do not phosphorylate A\u03b2 in this experimental setting.\nDespite the absence of intracellular phosphorylation, exogenous A\u03b2 was modified by surface kinases of HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were incubated in a medium containing A\u03b2 and 32P-\u03b3-ATP for half an hour, after which the medium was collected and enriched by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to pSer8-A\u03b2 (1E4E11) or to the 17\u201324 A\u03b2 epitope (4G8) that did not contain phosphorylation sites. After enrichment for pS8-A\u03b2, the band corresponding to the phosphorylated A\u03b2 was observed both when stained with specific antibodies (Figure 2c) and on the autoradiographs (Figure 2d). If IP was performed with 4G8 antibodies, pS8-A\u03b2 phosphorylation was not detected with specific antibodies, but the incorporation of 32P into the corresponding band was still observed (Figure 2d). This observation implies the presence of A\u03b2 species phosphorylated at residues other than Ser8; hence, these species are not stained with 1E4E11, but the incorporation of 32P is visible. Phosphorylation of A\u03b2 at Ser8 was detected only in the presence of a cocktail of phosphatase inhibitors (Figure 2d). Thus, HEK293 cells are able not only to phosphorylate but also to dephosphorylate A\u03b2."

Dephosphorylation was assessed by incubating the membranes after Western blotting with antibodies 6E10 (Figure 3a). It was found that 6E10 antibodies bound to the 7\u201314 epitope of A\u03b2, with a 250-fold higher affinity for the nonphosphorylated beta-amyloid peptide compared to pS8-A\u03b2 (Figure 3b). In the samples without inhibitor, intense staining with 6E10 antibodies was observed, while in the presence of okadaic acid, the average intensity of the bands decreased by almost 90%. Dramatic suppression of A\u03b2 dephosphorylation by HEK293 cell lysate in the presence of okadaic acid indicates the key role of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases in this process."

However, the modifications that A\u03b2 undergoes when crossing the BBB are not studied sufficiently. The authors evaluated the ability of mouse brain endothelial cells bEnd.3 to modify A\u03b2 with intracellular kinases in lysate, with surface kinases, or after internalisation of exogenous A\u03b2 by intact cells. The specific antibodies for pS8-A\u03b2 detected no phosphorylation of A\u03b2 by the bEnd.3 lysate. However, the inclusion of radioactive 32P in the band corresponding to A\u03b2 showed phosphorylation of A\u03b2 by the lysate of bEnd3 cells, although lower than for HEK293 cells (Figure 4a). After the enrichment for pS8-A\u03b2 with IP, followed by autoradiography, the band corresponding to A\u03b2 was preserved for HEK293, but was not detected in the case of bEnd.3 (Figure 4b). Such difference in A\u03b2 phosphorylation in the lysates correlates\nwith drastically different expressions of CK2\u03b1 catalytic subunit in HEK293 and bEnd.3 cells (Figure 4c).\nAs with HEK293 cells, when live bEnd.3 cells were treated with exogenous A\u03b2, phosphorylated peptide was not detected in the cell lysate either when using specific 1E4E11 antibodies (Figure S2) or when the inclusion of radioactive phosphorus in the band corresponding to A\u03b2 was measured. The internalization of A\u03b2 by bEnd.3 cells was confirmed (Figure S3). Phosphorylation of A\u03b2 by bEnd.3 surface kinases was also not observed (Figure S4). Next, the ability of bEnd.3 cells lysate to dephosphorylate pS8-A\u03b2 was assessed. As in HEK293 cells, phosphatases PP1 and PP2A play a major role in pS8-A\u03b2 dephosphorylation in bEnd.3 cells (Figure 4d). To compare the ability of HEK293 and bEnd.3 cells to dephosphorylate A\u03b2, the research team determined the level of npA\u03b2 in samples incubated in the presence of (npA\u03b2inh, ng) and the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (npA\u03b2total, ng), as well\nas the amount of protein lysate in each sample (Qprot, \u00b5g). The ability to dephosphorylate A\u03b2 at the Ser8 residue (Idephosph, ng/\u00b5g) was calculated using the following formula:\nIdephosph = (npA\u03b2total \u2212 npA\u03b2inh)\nQprot , ng/\u00b5g\nThe Idephosph value for HEK293 was almost four times lower than for bEnd.3 (Figure 4e), which indicates a higher activity of phosphatases in brain endothelial cells and may be one of the reasons for the low A\u03b2 phosphorylation signal in bEnd.3."

            "text": "Phosphorylation of proteins is one of the most important regulators of cell metabolism, and its disruption leads to the development of various pathologies [22]. Thus, hyperphosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein tau is observed in AD due to the activation of GSK3 kinase [23,24], mutations in the insulin receptor kinase lead to the development of diabetes, and aberrant activation of tyrosine kinases is a common cause of cancer [25]. Phosphatases are another part of the system that controls protein phosphorylation, and a change in their activity also leads to morbid consequences: increased activity of cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase is associated with a poor prognosis in multiple cancers [26], and a mutation in the Lyp phosphatase gene is a common risk factor for a number of autoimmune diseases [27]. There is a lot of evidence that the activity of kinases and phosphatases may change with age, and this change may be the cause of various disorders associated with ageing [28\u201331]. Age-related brain function disorders can also be associated with impaired protein phosphorylation: in an ageing organism, the basal level of brain AMPK activity increases [32], CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus changes [33], and the level of GSK3\u03b2 in the cholinergic system increases [34]. Age is a major risk factor for AD; however, the mechanism linking ageing with the development of AD has not yet been established. It is possible that aberrant protein phosphorylation observed in AD [35] may be not only a consequence but also one of the causes of the disease. Thus, kinases and phosphatases are potential targets for AD therapy and/or prevention. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the pathogenic cascade of AD is initiated by the accumulation and oligomerisation of the beta-amyloid peptide. Beta-amyloid contains a number of residues potentially capable of phosphorylation\u2014these are the residues Ser8, Tyr10, and Ser26. The properties of A\u03b2 phosphorylated at the Tyr10 residue are practically unstudied, and the first evidence for its presence in vivo was obtained only recently [36]. A peptide modified at Ser8 and Ser26 residues was found in the brain tissues of AD model mice [8,37], and the properties of these peptides were studied in in vitro models [9,10]. Since A\u03b2 is formed at the outer side of the cell membrane [38] or is secreted after the formation in endosomes [39], the possibility of A\u03b2 phosphorylation was first assumed in the extracellular space [11]. However, it was found that pS8-A\u03b2 accumulated inside the brain neurons of AD model mice prior to the development of pronounced cerebral amyloidosis [7]. What is primary\u2014the internalisation of A\u03b2 or its phosphorylation\u2014remains unclear. It was found that A\u03b2 was able to be phosphorylated at the Ser8 residue by fresh HEK293 cell lysate and, to a lesser extent, by bEnd.3 brain endothelial cell lysate. On the other hand, if cells were treated with exogenous A\u03b2, intracellular phosphorylation of the peptide was not observed. It is possible that internalised A\u03b2 remains trapped in the endosomal compartment and cannot interact with cytoplasmic kinases. Such localisation of A\u03b2 is typical for brain endothelial cells that transport it across the BBB. For other cell lines, for example, human neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y, a high degree of cytoplasmic localisation of internalised A\u03b2 was shown [40]. Thus, intracellular A\u03b2 phosphorylation preceding its aggregation is not excluded. One of the candidate kinases for intracellular phosphorylation is CK2. The authors of this paper have shown that it is able to phosphorylate A\u03b2 in vitro and is likely involved in its phosphorylation in the cell lysate. Weaker phosphorylation of A\u03b2 by bEnd.3 cells\u2019 lysate compared to HEK293 correlates with much lower expression levels of CK2 in these cells. It has been previously shown that CK2 levels and activity are reduced in AD [41,42].\nIn addition to intracellular CK2, there are secreted forms of CK2 that modify extracellular proteins [17,43], including the extracellular sites in APP [44]. Since A\u03b2 phosphorylation at the Ser8 residue prevents the formation of metal-dependent oligomers, inhibition of ion transport, and reduces cerebral amyloidogenesis [10], a decrease in CK2 activity may contribute to the development of AD. In this work, it was shown for the first time that pS8-A\u03b2 was a substrate for protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, and they played a major role in A\u03b2 dephosphorylation. For this, a dinoflagellate toxin okadaic acid, [45], which inhibits these enzymes with high specificity, was used. bEnd.3 cells were shown to have three times\u2019 higher ability to dephosphorylate pS8-A\u03b2 than HEK293 cells. As reported previously, vascular deposits of pS8-A\u03b2 are observed in only 60% of cerebral amyloid angiopathy cases [46], while the deposits of the pyroglutamylated A\u03b2 form, independent of phosphatase activity, are found in more than 90% of vessel-associated A\u03b2 aggregates. Relatively weak intracellular phosphorylation, lack of A\u03b2 surface phosphorylation relative to HEK293, and high activity of phosphatases in bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells may constitute an explanation for this phenomenon. Thus, casein kinase 2 is involved in A\u03b2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells, while PP1 and PP2A phosphatases are key contributors to pS8-A\u03b2 dephosphorylation in HEK293 and bEnd.3. Compared to HEK293, bEnd.3 cells are less capable of A\u03b2 phosphorylation, but have a significantly more pronounced ability to dephosphorylate pS8-A\u03b2. The data obtained allow the proposing of casein kinase 2 as a new target for the regulation of pS8-A\u03b2 levels in the body and indicate a possible role of the BBB endothelium in controlling the status of A\u03b2 modification. Limitations: (1) The number of cells for both bEnd.3 and HEK293 samples represents that on T-25 flask at confluence; however, HEK293 cells grow more densely. Thus, the weak phosphorylation of bEnd.3 in the lysate and the absence of detectable surface phosphorylation may be due to the lower number of cells per sample than in HEK29. (2) The lysate was not separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions. Though the total protein content of cell membrane is orders of magnitude lower than that of cytoplasm, membrane kinases may account for some A\u03b2 phosphorylation detected in the cell lysate. (3) The TBBz and okadaic acid are usually perceived as specific inhibitors of CK2 and PP1/PP2A, respectively. However, several studies report that these compounds have additional targets. In the concentration used in the study, okadaic acid also inhibits PP4, PP5, and PP6 phosphatases [https://doi.org/10.2174/092986732566618050 8095242, https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59745-267-X:23], and TBBz would also have other targets such as PIM1/2, PKD1 and DYRK1a kinases [https://doi.org/10.1042/BJ20080309, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2012.09.017, https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M700559-MCP2 00]. Thus, the involvement of CK2 in A\u03b2 phosphorylation and of PP1 and PP2A in the dephosphorylation of A\u03b2 should be validated using complementary methods or alternative inhibitors, such as K64 and K66 for CK2 [https://doi.org/10.1042/BJ20080309] (all accessed on 30 June 2022).\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/life13010147/s1, Figure S1: The toxicity of 1, 10 and 25 \u00b5M TBBz inhibitor for HEK293.
