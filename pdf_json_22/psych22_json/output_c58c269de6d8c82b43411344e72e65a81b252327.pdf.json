This laboratory study aimed to assess relations between depression symptom level and smoking urges for reward and relief, cigarette withdrawal, and smoking reinstatement in people who smoke cigarettes daily during acute abstinence and while smoking as usual. Methods: Participants with low (n=51) or elevated (n=29) baseline depression symptoms underwent two counterbalanced laboratory sessions (i.e., abstinent, non-abstinent). At each session, they completed subjective measures of smoking urges for reward and relief, and withdrawal. They also completed a laboratory smoking reinstatement task measuring whether they would delay smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked. Results: The elevated depression symptom group reported significantly higher withdrawal (p=.01) and smoked more cigarettes than the low depression symptoms group during the smoking reinstatement task self-administration period at the abstinent session (p=.04). Smoking urges for reward and relief were not significantly different by depression symptom group. There were no significant interactions of depression and abstinence with any outcomes. Conclusions: As outcomes were measured at both an abstinent and non-abstinent session, findings identify factors for people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke which may drive smoking behavior and impede smoking cessation efforts. This study provides evidence that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke may need additional/more\n3 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY pharmacological or behavioral smoking cessation aids targeted at reducing withdrawal and number of cigarettes smoked. Keywords: cigarette smoking, depression symptoms, smoking urge, withdrawal symptoms, smoking reinstatement\n4 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY 1. Introduction\nIndividuals with elevated depression symptoms (e.g., sadness, irritability, low positive\naffect, decreased cognitive functioning) are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking, escalate from smoking to meeting criteria for nicotine dependence (Aubin et al., 1996; Weinberger et al., 2017), and to relapse after a quit attempt (Aubin et al., 1996; Cinciripini et al., 2003; Hitsman et al., 1999; Kinnunen et al., 1996; Niaura et al., 2001; Weinberger et al., 2017). As such, it is essential for studies to investigate smoking behavior and predictors of smoking maintenance and relapse (e.g., smoking urges, cigarette withdrawal) in individuals with elevated depression symptoms to inform the development of effective and individualized smoking cessation strategies for this at-risk population. Particularly, studying acute cigarette abstinence in the laboratory may serve as a model of the early phases of a cessation attempt and provide insight into factors that may maintain smoking behavior and prevent cessation success.\nSmoking urges\u2014desire and intentions to smoke for pleasure or to relieve negative affect\nand cigarette withdrawal\u2014are well-studied predictors of smoking maintenance and relapse during a smoking cessation attempt (al'Absi et al., 2004; Allen et al., 2008; H\u00e9bert et al., 2021; Killen and Fortmann, 1997). A smoking cessation study found that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke (vs. those with low depression symptoms) experienced more intense smoking urges at the early phases of a cessation attempt and throughout four weeks of smoking cessation treatment (Reid and Ledgerwood, 2016). However, an unassisted cessation study reported no association between depression symptoms and smoking urges at 3-month follow-up (Brodbeck et al., 2014). These prior studies demonstrated mixed results related to depression and smoking urges and they did not differentiate between urges related to positively reinforcing effects of smoking (reward) versus urges related to negatively reinforcing effects of\n5 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY smoking (relief) (Cox et al., 2001; Tiffany and Drobes, 1991). For example, a cross-sectional study in lung cancer patients reported that affective symptoms of depression were positively correlated with smoking urges for relief of negative affect and cigarette withdrawal, but there was no relationship between depression symptoms and smoking urges for reward (Walker et al., 2004). This finding suggests that smoking urges for relief of negative affect and cigarette withdrawal may be more relevant to people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, but it would be important to also understand how this relationship may differ by cigarette abstinence.\nDuring periods of abstinence, people who smoke experience cigarette withdrawal\nsymptoms (i.e., seven subjective items: dysphoria/sadness, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety/nervousness, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite), which are powerful motivators of smoking maintenance and relapse (al'Absi et al., 2004; Allen et al., 2008; Budney et al., 2008; Kenford et al., 2002; Piasecki, T. et al., 2003; Piasecki, T.M. et al., 2003) and may be particularly relevant to people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke. A cross-sectional study found that higher compared to lower baseline depression symptoms were positively associated with greater withdrawal symptoms at prior quit attempts reported retrospectively (Tsoh et al., 2003). However, other studies did not find significant associations of general baseline depression symptoms and cigarette withdrawal during a cessation attempt (Copeland et al., 2009; Schnoll et al., 2013). One laboratory-based study in people with elevated baseline depression symptoms who smoke, found that smoking research cigarettes with varying levels of nicotine following cigarette abstinence associated with greater cigarette withdrawal (Streck et al., 2020). However, this study did not report an effect of depression symptom level on withdrawal when participants smoked their usual brand cigarettes or during periods of non-abstinence (Streck et al., 2020) so these effects may be specific to\n6 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY smoking cigarettes with reduced nicotine levels during abstinence. Another laboratory-based study reported people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke (vs. low depression symptoms) experienced more intense cigarette withdrawal across 3 days of biochemically verified abstinence (Pomerleau et al., 2005), but did not assess withdrawal during nonabstinence.\nSmoking reinstatement has been largely investigated by measuring time from ceasing\nsmoking to smoking lapse (i.e., the first instance of smoking during cigarette abstinence) and likelihood of relapse (i.e., resuming regular smoking; Shiffman, 2006). Cessation studies have found that greater baseline depression symptoms significantly associate with earlier lapse and relapse (Fond et al., 2013; Zvolensky et al., 2009), greater number of lapses (Brodbeck et al., 2014), and increased likelihood of relapse after smoking a single cigarette (Muench et al., 2020). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies show that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, compared to those with low depression symptoms, may also be more sensitive to the effects of stress on smoking lapse risk (Minami et al., 2018). However, Muench and Juliano (2017) did not find a significant association of depression symptoms on smoking reinstatement during a smoking cessation attempt. To the best of our knowledge, no laboratorybased studies have investigated the differences in outcomes of a smoking reinstatement task for those with elevated versus low depression symptoms during experimentally induced abstinence compared to non-abstinence.\nPrior studies have found people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke,\ncompared to low depression symptoms, may experience greater smoking urges for relief and withdrawal, and may be at higher risk for lapse and relapse during a cessation attempt. Extant work on the role of depression symptoms on smoking urge, withdrawal, and smoking\n7 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY reinstatement have been mixed and sparse. Thus, utilizing experimental laboratory methodologies, such as those that allow comparisons of cigarette abstinence with nonabstinence, may be warranted. Additionally, as most smoking lapses tend to occur during early abstinence (Kenford et al., 1994; Shiffman et al., 1997) and specifically within the first few hours of abstinence from smoking (Brown et al., 2005; H\u00e9bert et al., 2021), controlled laboratory procedures allow for the investigation of smoking urges, withdrawal, and smoking reinstatement during early acute abstinence. Furthermore, as individuals with elevated depression symptoms may be at risk for poor cessation outcomes, it is important to understand how the relationship of abstinence and these smoking-related variables differ by depression symptom level to help identify abstinence barriers for individuals with elevated depression symptoms.\nIn this laboratory-based study, individuals who smoke cigarettes daily reported baseline\ndepression symptoms and then completed two counterbalanced experimental sessions (abstinent and non-abstinent). Aim 1 of the study was to investigate whether smoking-relevant factors (i.e., smoking urges, withdrawal, smoking reinstatement) differed by depression symptom level. We hypothesized that across both sessions, people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke would report greater smoking urges for reward and relief, cigarette withdrawal symptoms, and would be less likely to delay smoking and smoke more cigarettes in a laboratory analogue smoking reinstatement task compared to people with low depression symptoms who smoke. Aim 2 of the study was to investigate whether abstinence effects differed by depression symptom level (elevated vs. low). We hypothesized that cigarette abstinence effects on smoking relevant outcomes would be greater in those with elevated depression symptoms compared to those with low depression symptoms. 2. Methods\n8 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY 2.1 Participants\nNon-treatment seeking people who smoke cigarettes daily were recruited from the Los\nAngeles, California (United States, US) metropolitan area via online advertisements including automated advertisements disseminated by the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) and word of mouth. To be eligible for the study, participants had to (1) be \u226521 years of age; (2) report regular cigarette smoking for at least the past year; (3) currently smoke 5+ cigarettes/day; and (4) be fluent in English. Participants were excluded for (1) meeting diagnostic criteria for lifetime bipolar disorder, current posttraumatic stress disorder, or a current substance use disorder for substances other than nicotine assessed via a structured clinical interview\u2014the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan et al., 1998) by a research assistant; (2) an expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) level <8ppm at the baseline screening session (Benowitz et al., 2020); (3) current use of nicotine replacement or other medications implicated in smoking cessation (e.g., Chantix, Wellbutrin/Bupropion, Zyban); (4) daily use of non-cigarette tobacco and nicotine products (e.g., e-cigarettes/vaping devices, cigars); (5) current pregnancy or intent to get pregnant; and (6) current detailed plans to cut down or quit smoking.\nThe initial planned sample size was N=240, however, participant accrual was halted\nprematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and results of this study should be considered preliminary and exploratory. 2.2 Procedure"

Abstinent and non-abstinent experimental sessions were identical except that (1) participants were instructed to \u201cstop smoking\u201d for 16 hours prior to their abstinent session and to smoke normally prior to their non-abstinent session and (2) participants were administered one of their own cigarettes at the non-abstinent session to standardize for smoking recency.\nOn arrival at each session, a breath alcohol analysis was conducted to confirm abstinence\nfrom alcohol. Participants with a positive breath alcohol analysis were rescheduled (n=1). Participants then completed a CO assessment using a Vitalograph breath carbon monoxide monitor. Participants were required to have a CO level \u22649 ppm at the abstinent session, and all participants met this requirement. Participants then completed self-report assessments of affect and craving prior to and following smoking one of their own cigarettes (non-abstinent session) or a 5-minute break (abstinent session). In the non-abstinent session, participants also completed self-report measures of cigarette effects following smoking one of their own cigarettes. Participants then completed measures of positive and negative affect, craving and withdrawal, and saliva samples in repeated intervals. Participants then completed a randomized and counterbalanced film clip task (results not reported here) and a smoking reinstatement task. At the end of the second experimental session, participants were debriefed about the study.\n10 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY 2.2.3 Participant Compensation\nParticipants were paid at the completion of each session they attended and could earn a\ntotal of $225-$243 for completing the entire study (payment varied based on responses during the smoking reinstatement task).

The Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) is a widely used 6-item self-report measure of cigarette dependence severity with higher scores indicating greater dependence severity (Fagerstrom, 2012; Fagerstr\u00f6m, 2003). FTCD was included as a planned covariate due to the association between cigarette dependence and cigarette abstinence effects (Baker et al., 2012; Ben Taleb et al., 2016; Fagerstr\u00f6m, 2003; Koob, 2006; Piper et al., 2006; Shiffman et al., 2004).\n11 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY\nThe Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure\ndepression symptom levels (Radloff, 1977). This 20-item self-report scale measures the frequency of past week depression symptoms (e.g., dysphoric mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, loss of interest, psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbance) on 4-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 (Rarely or none of the time, 0-1 days) to 3 (Most or all of the time, 5-7 days), which are then summed to determine a total score ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater depression symptoms. Participants with a CES-D score \u226520 were classified as having an elevated level of depression symptoms (=1) and those with CES-D score <20 were classified as having a low level of depression symptoms (=0). In a meta-analysis that pooled studies which used the CES-D to screen for major depression, the best trade-off between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (78%) was evidenced by this particular cutoff score (Vilagut et al., 2016)."

Responses ranged from 0 (None) to 5 (Severe).\nThe smoking reinstatement task is a laboratory analogue of smoking lapse and relapse\n(McKee, 2009; McKee et al., 2015). Participants were presented the box of cigarettes they brought with them containing 8 of their own cigarettes and their lighter. Participants were monitored through a 1-way mirror and task timing was recorded (e.g., the time from the start of the self-administration period to when the participant smoked their first cigarette). The task began with the delay period, where participants were instructed that they can start smoking at any point over the next 50 minutes, but that for each 5 minutes they delay smoking, they will earn $0.50 (max: $5.00). The moment participants started to smoke (or at the end of 50 minutes for those who choose not to smoke), they begin the self-administration period. During the selfadministration period, they were told they have a $4.00 credit, and they can smoke as little or as much as they wish over the next 60 minutes, but each cigarette they light from the 8 in their cigarette box will cost them $0.50. The maximum amount earned was $9.00 for not smoking during either portion of the task. Monetary values were based on prior studies (Kahler et al., 2014; Oberleitner et al., 2018; Stevenson et al., 2017). At the end of the self-administration period, participants entered a rest period (i.e., no assessment or smoking). The rest period was 0- 60 minutes and was included to standardize the length of the smoking reinstatement task. To summarize, the outcome variables for the smoking reinstatement task were: 1) how long participants delay the opportunity to smoke (range: 0-50 min), and 2) the number of cigarettes smoked during the delay and self-administration period (range: 0-8).\n13 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY 2.4 Data Analysis"

There was not a significant depression symptom \u00d7 abstinence interaction for number of cigarettes smoked during the self-administration period (p=.20; Table 2). 4. Discussion\nThis controlled laboratory-based study investigated the relationship between depression\nsymptom level with smoking urges, cigarette withdrawal, and laboratory analogue smoking reinstatement in a non-treatment seeking sample of people who smoke daily. In accordance with\n16 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY our hypothesis, we found that cigarette withdrawal was significantly higher in people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke compared to those with low depression symptoms. Prior research has shown that elevated depression symptoms associated with greater cigarette withdrawal during a past quit attempt reported retrospectively (Tsoh et al., 2003), measured across 3 days of biochemically verified abstinence (Pomerleau et al., 2005), and in response to reduced nicotine cigarettes (Streck et al., 2020). The current study extends these findings by suggesting that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke may experience elevated withdrawal during periods of both abstinence and non-abstinence. It is possible that, for people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, cigarette withdrawal may be an important factor across the smoking behavior change continuum. For example, people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke may be less likely to make a quit attempt due to concern about experiencing withdrawal, and those that do make a smoking cessation attempt may experience intense withdrawal and subsequently, lapse and relapse. Behavioral and pharmacological treatments such as nicotine preloading that focus on reducing withdrawal symptoms (Hajek, 1989; Wadgave and Nagesh, 2016; West and Shiffman, 2001) may be particularly beneficial for people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke.\nWe did not find an association of depression symptom level nor an interaction of\ndepression symptom level and abstinence with the anticipated relief from negative affect and an urgent desire to smoke (i.e., the negatively reinforcing effects of smoking), nor a strong desire to smoke for pleasure with smoking perceived as rewarding (i.e., the positively reinforcing effects of smoking). This result is contrary to prior research that found depression symptoms associate with greater smoking urges for relief of negative affect (Brodbeck et al., 2014; Haas et al., 2004; Walker et al., 2004). There was a significant main effect of abstinence with smoking urge for\n17 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY relief and reward regardless of depression symptom group, which suggests that smoking urge may be an important abstinence target both for individuals with elevated depression symptoms and those with low depression symptoms.\nWhen given the opportunity to smoke, people with elevated depression symptoms who\nsmoke consumed more cigarettes compared to those with low depression symptoms. This finding suggests that during acute cigarette abstinence such as during the early stages of a cessation attempt, people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, compared to those with low depression symptoms, may be more likely to smoke more cigarettes when given the opportunity to resume smoking. This is somewhat aligned with prior research that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke experience quicker time to lapse and relapse (Fond et al., 2013; Muench et al., 2020; Zvolensky et al., 2009). However, as participants were smoking as usual, the current findings build on prior work by showing that the likelihood to resume normal smoking is not restricted to a cessation or quit attempt. Elevated depression symptoms may be driving smoking maintenance in naturalistic periods of cigarette abstinence (e.g., following overnight abstinence, prior to the first cigarette of the day).\nThe results of this study must be taken in context of its limitations. Firstly, the study\nutilized dichotomized CES-D scores with a cutoff score of 20 to classify elevated versus low baseline depression symptoms, as opposed to a clinical diagnosis. However, a review paper found that both diagnoses of depression and depression symptoms were related to higher prevalence of smoking and greater odds of smoking relapse (Weinberger et al., 2017). Thus, it is important to investigate associations of depression symptom levels in the absence of full diagnosis. Despite not utilizing a clinical diagnosis, these findings provide important information about how depression symptoms influence withdrawal and smoking reinstatement for those who\n18 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY have depression symptoms but do not meet criteria for a full diagnosis, and those that do not take medications. This study also utilized a non-treatment seeking sample of people who smoke, and tobacco abstinence was experimentally induced. However, the findings provide important information on depression symptoms and smoking patterns in those who may not be ready or willing to quit, and experimentally induced abstinence has been shown to predict smoking outcomes in a naturalistic quit attempt (Strong et al., 2011), suggesting that these findings may be generalizable outside of the laboratory. We also excluded people who reported daily use of non-cigarette tobacco products. As people with depression have been shown to be more likely to report dual/poly tobacco use than people without depression (Chido-Amajuoyi et al., 2021), the effects of depression on the relevant smoking-related variables in dual/poly users would be an important area for future research. Lastly, since participant accrual was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the sample size was smaller than originally planned. While confirmatory power analyses showed that were adequately powered to detect main effects, it is likely that we were underpowered to detect the planned interaction effects. Thus, results pertaining to the reported non-significant interactions should be considered preliminary and exploratory.\nDespite limitations, the study contributes to literature on the relationship between\ndepression symptom levels in relation to smoking urge, withdrawal, and smoking reinstatement in non-treatment seeking people who smoke daily. Strengths of the study include the controlled laboratory-based design and its ability to specifically isolate and compare smoking urges, withdrawal, and smoking reinstatement experienced during non-abstinent and abstinent sessions. The study provides evidence that cigarette withdrawal may be an important smoking-related variable in individuals with elevated depression symptoms who smoke during both abstinence\n19 DEPRESSION, SMOKING, LAB STUDY and non-abstinence. Thus, individuals with elevated depression symptoms who smoke may need behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation treatments targeted at reducing withdrawal. We also found that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, smoked more cigarettes than individuals with low depression symptoms who smoke, and that those with elevated depression symptoms who smoke showed significant abstinence effects on number of cigarettes smoked. The results show us that people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke, may smoke more cigarettes when given the opportunity to smoke following a period of non-smoking; aligning with previous work that elevated depression symptoms drive greater smoking behavior and those with low depression symptoms may attain better cessation outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of assessing how depression symptom level interacts with smoking maintenance and barriers for quitting in a particularly vulnerable population. The study provides insight into how behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation treatments may affect people with elevated depression symptoms who smoke and how more efficacious and effective treatments may be developed."
