    "abstractText": "Background: The treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a challenge, and the discovery of new antifungal compounds is crucial. The phenacylideneoxindoles exhibited promising antifungal activity against Paracoccidioides spp., but their mode of action remains unknown. Methods: Through proteomic analysis, we investigated the effects of (E)-3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethylidene)indolin-2one on P. brasiliensis. In addition, we investigated the metabolic alterations of P. brasiliensis in response to the compound. Furthermore, the effects of the compound on the membrane, ethanol production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were verified. Results: We identified differentially regulated proteins that revealed significant metabolic reorganization, including an increase in ethanol production, suggesting the activation of alcoholic fermentation and alterations in the rigidity of fungal cell membrane with an increase of the ergosterol content and formation of ROS. Conclusions: These findings enhance our understanding of the mode of action and response of P. brasiliensis to the investigated promising antifungal compound, emphasizing its potential as a candidate for the",

            "text": "Paracoccidioides is a genus of thermally dimorphic fungi that causes Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), an endemic and systemic mycosis in Latin America. PCM represents a public health problem with a significant impact on the quality of life of affected individuals. A higher incidence of PCM is associated with rural and agricultural areas or occupational exposure to environmental sources, such as soil and vegetation. Additionally, specific demographic groups are more commonly affected by PCM, such as adult males between 30 and 59 years old [1]. The PCM treatment aims to eradicate the Paracoccidioides fungus from the body, as well as to reduce symptoms, prevent recurrence, and improve the quality of life of patients. Although Paracoccidioides is sensitive to most antifungals, only a few are currently clinically employed [2]. Azole derivatives, such as itraconazole, have been widely used as firstchoice therapy for mild to moderate forms of the disease. These drugs act by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, leading to the death of the fungus [3,4]. The duration of the treatment varies from months to years, depending on the clinical form of PCM and the individual patient\u2019s response. In the\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 854. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9080854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 854 2 of 13\ntreatment of disseminated PCM, which affects vital organs, intravenous administration of amphotericin B, a broad-spectrum polyene antifungal, is employed. This antifungal drug acts by binding to the ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, causing its disruption and subsequent cell death [5,6]. However, it is important to note that amphotericin B can lead to severe side effects [7] and is typically reserved for cases in which other antifungal agents have demonstrated ineffectiveness or cannot be utilized due to contraindications. The combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, which inhibit multiple steps of folic acid synthesis, has been recommended for less severe cases of the disease, mainly for the chronic and non-disseminated forms [1]. The treatment of PCM has some limitations that affect the therapeutic efficacy and quality of life of patients. The prolonged duration of treatment, ranging from months to years depending on the clinical form of the disease and the individual patient\u2018s response, can impact adherence, resulting in interruptions in the therapeutic regimen, thereby compromising the treatment\u2019s effectiveness. Adverse effects of these antifungals, such as kidney and liver damage, have been reported [8], requiring monitoring during the treatment period. Antifungal resistance is another concern. Although resistance is still relatively uncommon in clinical settings, the possibility of developing resistance was reported by an in vitro approach [9]. Considering the need to identify new compounds with antifungal activity against PCM, we previously evaluated the activity of five phenacylideneoxindoles compounds against several Paracoccidioides species [10]. The phenacylideneoxyndoles are nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds with a chemical structure that includes an oxindole ring with a phenacylidene group attached to it. These compounds possess bioactive properties and have been studied due to their pharmacological potential, including antifungal [11,12], antioxidant [13], antiparasitic [14], and anticancer activities [15]. One of the main reasons for studies is the potential for modifying its structure by incorporating functional groups, which enables the optimization of pharmacological properties, including affinity for specific targets, selective biological activity, and reduced toxicity. Additionally, the presence of nitrogen in the heterocyclic structure can facilitate important chemical and biological interactions with proteins and enzymes in the body, allowing for the modulation of metabolic pathways and physiological processes [16]. In our study with phenacylideneoxindoles [10], the compound (E)-3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethylidene)indolin-2-one (OPI) exhibited promising antifungal activity, displaying fungicidal effects and synergistic activity with itraconazole. In addition to conducting in vitro experiments, we also performed in silico predictions of potential molecular targets for OPI. However, we recognize the need to further advance research on the molecular alterations underlying its antifungal effect. Therefore, through proteomic analyses, we aimed to elucidate the impact of OPI on metabolic pathways and cellular processes. This article will provide insights into the differential expression of proteins in Paracoccidioides after exposure to OPI and demonstrate its effects on the cell membrane, ethanol levels, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)."

Temporal Dynamics of the Viability of Paracoccidioides Exposed to OPI\nWe evaluated the antifungal efficacy of OPI by temporally monitoring the survival of P. brasiliensis after 72 h. The viability was significantly affected after 9 h. After 72 h, 97% cell death was observed (Figure 1). These results are important to determine the initial time of a tifungal action and define the time for proteomic analysis to obtain precise information on the prot ins differentially xpressed in r sponse to the treatment. Considering that for the time interval of 9 h we observed a cell viability of 94.7% in the treated condition (presence of OPI) and 97.6% in the control condition (absence of OPI), we chose this time to perform the proteomic analysis, since we observed a minimal decrease in cell viability in the treated condition in this period. This period represents a critical time when cells are responding to the stress caused by the treatment and may be activating adaptive metabolic pathways or remodeling their metabolism to adapt to new conditions.\nJ.

Discussion The data presented in the proteomic assays (Tables S1 and S2) indicate that cellular metabolic processes of the fungus P. brasiliensis underwent significant changes during exposure to OPI, suggesting a metabolic regulation in response to the antifungal. This regulation is strengthened by the upregulated proteins involved in pyruvate production, including hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, enzymes involved in the synthesis of threonine from aspartate (aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, threonine synthase, and L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase), degradation of glycine (glycine cleavage system T protein), degradation of methionine (S-adenosylmethionine synthase), and degradation of ornithine (ornithine aminotransferase and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase) were also identified with an increased abundance. These enzymes can indirectly generate pyruvate as an end product of their metabolic pathways. Proteins from other pathways, such as the glyoxylate and methylcitrate cycles, were also induced by P. brasiliensis in response to OPI. The glyoxylate cycle serves as an alternative route to the TCA cycle, which shares the enzymatic activities of malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and aconitase. However, replacing the two decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle, the major enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, malate synthase, and isocitrate lyase, convert isocitrate and acetyl-CoA into succinate and malate, which allows several microorganisms to grow using fatty acids and 2-carbon compounds as a carbon source [20].

Fungi 2023, 9, 854 9 of 13\npathogenicity of the fungus. Our proteomic results revealed that in the presence of OPI, P. brasiliensis upregulated isocitrate lyase (Table S2). The methylcitrate cycle is another alternative metabolic pathway that plays an important role in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA, a byproduct of amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and certain intermediate metabolites. Accumulation of propionyl-CoA can be highly toxic to cells and needs to be metabolized [23]. Furthermore, through the methylcitrate cycle, propionyl-CoA can be converted to pyruvate. We observed an upregulation of 2-methylcitrate synthase in our proteomic analyses. These findings suggest that other pathways are also induced and lead to pyruvate production. Pyruvate can be oxidized, resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA or conversion to ethanol and CO2 via alcoholic fermentation. Since dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase was induced, we believe that part of the pyruvate is being directed toward the production of acetyl-CoA. However, we observed that some proteins related to the TCA cycle, such as citrate synthase, the alpha subunit of succinyl-CoA ligase, and succinate dehydrogenase, were down-regulated. These proteins play a crucial role in the TCA cycle, which is responsible for energy production in the form of ATP. The negative regulation of these proteins suggests a reduction in TCA cycle activity. It is possible that acetyl-CoA is being channeled to other metabolic pathways as an adaptive response of the fungus to the compound. This redirection of metabolic resources could favor pathways that generate less energy but are more advantageous for the survival of the fungus under stress conditions. The upregulation of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase suggests that alcoholic fermentation is taking place to produce ethanol, which is associated with virulence in fungi. During metabolic processes such as fermentation, the CO2 molecule is released. CO2 fixation occurs through the interconversion of CO2 to HCO3 catalyzed by carbonic anhydrases. This process not only regulates the adequate carbon supply for cellular metabolism but also contributes to various signaling processes in fungi, including morphology and communication [24,25]. Carbonic anhydrases have been linked to the development and virulence of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [26]. In P. brasiliensis, carbonic anhydrases have been upregulated during the infectious process [22] and under iron starvation [27]. Thus, the upregulation of carbonic anhydrase in the presence of OPI (Table S2) suggests that this enzyme may play a significant role in the adaptive response of P. brasiliensis to the antifungal, potentially contributing to its survival and virulence. It is known that alcoholic fermentation is an important process for fungal virulence and survival [28,29]. In Paracoccidioides spp., ethanol production is regulated under different conditions, such as carbon deprivation [21] and in the presence of argentilactone, a natural antifungal that promotes oxidative stress [30]. Therefore, the ethanol production by Paracoccidioides in response to antifungal OPI may occur as an adaptative and survival strategy against the stress caused by the treatment. The proteomic analyses also revealed the upregulation of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, which is an important metabolite in ergosterol biosynthesis. These findings suggest that in the presence of OPI, P. brasiliensis induces metabolic pathways for the production of acetyl-CoA, directing this molecule toward the synthesis of ergosterol. A similar mechanism was proposed in P. lutzzii in the presence of itraconazole [31], which showed that P. lutzii upregulated the expression of genes involved in various metabolic pathways that converge on the production of acetyl-CoA, also utilizing this molecule in the synthesis of ergosterol. The sterol content is crucial for the fluidity and permeability of biological membranes, osmotic stress tolerance, and the development and survival of fungi [32]. Erg proteins are a large family of proteins involved in the biosynthesis pathway of ergosterol, which is necessary for maintaining cell membrane integrity. Consequently, erg proteins have been targeted by antifungal agents such as azoles [33]. Proteins associated with sterols biosynthesis, including protein Erg 28, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and fatty acid synthase subunits beta and alpha, were downregulated (Table S1). The ERG gene expression was also downregulated in C. albicans in response to farnesol, a compound that influences\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 854 10 of 13\nthe integrity of the plasmatic membrane [34]. Thus, the upregulation of these proteins can indicate a potential disruption in the biosynthetic pathway of sterols and, consequently, cell membrane integrity alteration. This hypothesis can be supported by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance, which demonstrated an increase in membrane rigidity in the membrane of P. brasiliensis. We observed an increase in the ergosterol content in cells exposed to the antifungal after 48 h, which can be explained by compensatory mechanisms or alternative regulatory pathways that occur in response to the interruption of the sterol synthesis pathway. However, we believe that this change was not sufficient for membrane restoration, as the viability of P. brasiliensis continued to decrease over time. The increase in ROS formation after exposure to OPI suggests that the compound may have direct or indirect effects on cellular redox balance. The compound itself may possess chemical properties that promote ROS generation, or alternatively, the increased ROS may be due to the activation of specific metabolic pathways leading to ROS production. The downregulation of catalase, an enzyme involved in hydrogen peroxide detoxification, and the upregulation of superoxide dismutase, responsible for converting superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, may indicate the existence of regulatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining redox balance within the fungal cells. Under conditions of oxidative stress, the regulation of these enzymes may be coordinated to activate antioxidant defense pathways and limit oxidative damage, as shown by Ara\u00fajo et al. [30]. That study also found that P. brasiliensis upregulates superoxide dismutase in the presence of argentilactone, an antifungal inducer of ROS.

Fungi 2023, 9, 854 11 of 13\nIn the context of drug discovery and the proposition of molecular targets for compounds, proteomics has been recognized as a valuable tool. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations associated with its application in this specific context. Many proteins remain unidentified or have undefined functions in proteomic databases, thereby limiting our ability to identify relevant molecular targets for specific compounds. For instance, in our proteome, several proteins lack defined functions in the databases, leading to their exclusion from the construction of the metabolic changes model. Additionally, the variation in protein expression across different biological contexts requires analysis under diverse conditions to identify more robust targets. Moreover, the interaction of proteins with cofactors and protein complexes may be overlooked in proteomic analysis, affecting the accuracy of target identification. One strategy to overcome these limitations is the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, interactomics, and metabolomics, which can provide a more comprehensive view of biological mechanisms. This integration has already been employed, as demonstrated in the case of the argentilactone compound [30,35,36]."
