    "abstractText": "Here we report the first observation of the concurrent breakdown of the strange metal (SM) normal state and superconductivity at a pressure-induced quantum critical point in Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5 superconductor. We find that, upon suppressing the superconducting state, the power exponent (\u03b1) changes from 1 to 2, and the slope of the temperature-linear resistivity per FeAs layer (A) gradually diminishes. At a critical pressure, A and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) go to zero concurrently, where a quantum phase transition from a superconducting state with a SM normal state to a non-superconducting Fermi liquid state occurs. Scaling analysis reveals that the change of A with Tc obeys the relation of Tc ~ (A), similar to what is seen in other chemically doped unconventional superconductors. These results suggest that there is a simple but powerful organizational principle of connecting the SM normal state with the high-Tc superconductivity.",

            "text": "The breakdown of both strange metal and superconducting states at a pressureinduced quantum critical point in ironpnictide superconductors\nShu Cai1, Jinyu Zhao 1,2, Ni Ni 3,4, Jing Guo 1,5, Run Yang1, Pengyu Wang1,2, Jinyu Han1,2, Sijin Long1,2, Yazhou Zhou1, Qi Wu1, Xianggang Qiu1,2,5, Tao Xiang 1,2, Robert J. Cava3 & Liling Sun 1,2,5\nHere we report the first observation of the concurrent breakdown of the strange metal (SM) normal state and superconductivity at a pressure-induced quantum critical point in Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5 superconductor. We find that, upon suppressing the superconducting state, the power exponent (\u03b1) changes from 1 to 2, and the slope of the temperature-linear resistivity per FeAs layer (A\u25a1) gradually diminishes. At a critical pressure, A\u25a1 and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) go to zero concurrently, where a quantum phase transition from a superconducting state with a SM normal state to a non-superconducting Fermi liquid state occurs. Scaling analysis reveals that the change of A\u25a1 with Tc obeys the relation of Tc ~ (A\u25a1)0.5, similar to what is seen in other chemically doped unconventional superconductors. These results suggest that there is a simple but powerful organizational principle of connecting the SM normal state with the high-Tc superconductivity.\nThe strange metal (SM) state is an extraordinary normal state of hightemperature superconductors in which the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature in the low-temperature limit. Such a unique state has been found in the doped cuprates, iron-pnictide superconductors1\u201310, organic materials8, heavy Fermion metals11\u201313, infinite-layer nickelates14 and twisted bilayer graphene15. Although many efforts have been made in past decades, the correlation of the SM state with the superconductivity still remains a subject of debate, which requires more experimental information from different experimental probes and materials. The central questions for this key issue are what is the intrinsic correlation between the SM normal state and the superconductivity, and what is the determining factor associated with the SM normal state for stabilizing high-Tc superconductivity. To find clues for solving these puzzles, a superconductor with a pure SM normal state featured by \u03b1 = 1 (in the form of \u03c1 = \u03c10 +AT\u03b1) is needed. And better, if a superconducting system only hosts as few as possible competing orders in the tuning parameter\u2014temperature phase diagram, then direct information to reveal the relationship between these two may be obtained. The iron-pnictide superconductor Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5 is such an ideal superconducting material for this kind of study. The ground state of this superconductor is well understood, without the complication from ordered states, such as pseudogap state or a nearby long-range AFM state, etc.16. More intriguingly, it shows a T-linear resistivity behavior in its normal state at ambient pressure16, providing us a unique platform for studying the correlation between the T-linear resistivity and the superconductivity. Pressure is one of the non-thermal control parameters for tuning superconductivity because this method can shorten the interatomic distances and correspondingly leads to the change of the crystal and\nReceived: 23 February 2023\nAccepted: 11 May 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100190 Beijing, China. 2University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100190 Beijing, China. 3Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA. 4Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. 5Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, 523808 Dongguan, Guangdong, China. e-mail: llsun@iphy.ac.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3116 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nelectronic structures without altering the chemistry.

Thus, high pressure, as a \u2018clean\u2019 way, has been widely adopted as an independent control parameter to explore new phenomena and the evolution from one state to another in correlated electron systems17\u201325.

            "text": "Structure information and transport properties The Ca10(Pt4As8)(Fe2As2)5 superconductor crystallizes in a tetragonal unit cell with -Ca-(Pt4As8)-Ca-(Fe2As2)-stacking\n16. Its structure can be described as a distorted CaFe2As2 structure with every other Fe2As2\nlayer replaced by a Pt4As8 layer, as shown in Fig. 1a. At ambient pressure, its resistivity versus temperature shows a linear behavior above the superconducting transition at 26 K (Fig. 1b), which closely resembles what is seen in optimally doped cuprate superconductors2,26,27. When pressure is applied on the samples (S#1 and S#2) surrounded by the pressure transmittingmedium (PTM) of NaCl, we find that Tc shifts to low temperature upon compression and is invisible at 13 GPa and above for the sample #1 (Fig. 1c, d), indicating that the application of pressure can suppress the superconductivity effectively.We repeat the measurements with new samples cut from different batches and obtain reproducible results (Fig. 1e, f)\u2014increasing pressure brings a monotonic reduction in Tc, and the superconductivity vanishes for the S#2 at 11.8GPa. These results demonstrate the reproducible evolution of the superconductivity of the 1048 superconductor with pressure.\nTo clarify the possibility that the suppression ofTc is related to the pressure inhomogeneity introduced by the solid pressure medium NaCl, weperform the high-pressuremeasurements on the S#4with the\nS#4 surrounded by the liquid PTM of glycerin in the measurements.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3116 2\nliquidPTMofglycerin, andfind the same results (Fig. 1g, h)\u2014Tcdeclines with increasing pressure and vanishes at 12.8 GPa. Moreover, it is seen that the superconducting transition of the sample in the liquid pressure environment appears to have a sharper drop and no lowtemperature tail at the foot of the transition at low pressures up to 4GPa (Fig. 1c, e and g). This indicates that the different PTMs have an appreciable effect on superconductivity.\nHigh-pressure resistance versus temperature and corresponding fits We plot the resistance versus temperature for the pressurized S#1 and the S#4 (Fig. 2) and make the actual fits to the temperature (T) dependence of the normal state resistance at low temperatures for the data obtained from the compressed samples based on the following equations:\nR\u00f0T\u00de=R00 +A0T +B0T2\nR\u00f0T\u00de=R0 +AT\u03b1\nWhere R0 and R\u20320 are the residual resistance, A\u2032, B\u2032, A and \u03b1 are the slope of the T-linear resistance, the coefficient of T-square resistance, the coefficient of power function and the power exponent of temperature, respectively.\nSince the determination of the resistivity as a function of temperature at each pressure investigated requires the pressure dependence of sample thickness, which is difficult to be obtained in the highpressure resistance measurements, we replace resistivity with resistance in thedatafitting soas to takenoaccount of the relationbetween the applied pressure and the sample thickness (see \u201cMethods\u201d). It has been known that high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates and iron pnictides have a layered crystal structure; their superconductivities display prominent two-dimensional characteristics28\u201331. To describe the correlation between the SM state and superconductivity reasonably, we employ A\u25a1, the T-linear resistivity coefficient normalized by the average distance between FeAs layers, to investigate this important correlation (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The fitting is in good consistence with the experiment results (see red lines in Fig. 2), giving a set of coefficient A\u25a1 that varies with pressure from 10.8 at 0.6GPa to 0 at ~13 GPa and above for the S#1 (Fig. 2a\u2013h), and from 12.8 at 1.1 GPa to 0 at ~12.8GPa and above for the S#4 (Fig. 2i\u2013p). The other fitting results can be found in Supplementary Information (SI). We extract the power exponent (\u03b1), based on the equation in the form of power law, as a function of pressure and find that pressure changes \u03b1 from 1 at ambient pressure to 2 at 13 GPa for the S#1 and 12.8 GPa for the S#4. When pressure is higher than ~13 GPa for S#1 and 12.8 GPa for S#4, the low-temperature resistance shows curvature (Fig. 2e\u2013h, m\u2013p) and approaches a T2 dependence in the higher pressure range, where the superconductivity is fully suppressed. These results indicate that the application of pressure gradually drives the 1048 superconductor from a superconducting ground state with a SM normal state to a nonsuperconducting Fermi-liquid (FL) state.\nTc, \u03b1 and A\u25a1 versus pressure We summarize the experimental results in the pressure\u2013temperature phase diagram in Fig. 3a. There are three distinct regions in the diagram: the superconducting (SC) state, the strangemetal (SM) state (or non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior) and the non-superconducting Fermi liquid (FL) state. It is seen that the ambient-pressure superconductivity of the sample develops from a pure SM normal state, featured by \u03b1 = 1 (Fig. 3b), and the sample holds the highest Tc value. Upon increasing pressure till the critical pressurePc, Tc decreasesmonotonously, with \u03b1 varying between 1 and 2 (here, we take the average value of the pressures that destroy the superconducting state, obtained from different\nexperimental runs, as Pc, see Fig. 3). At Pc (~12.5 GPa), the superconductivity is completely suppressed (Fig. 3a) and the power exponent \u03b1 approaches 2 (Fig. 3b), indicating that the ground state of the sample moves into a non-superconducting FL state. These results demonstrate that applying pressure renders the 1048 superconductor to undergo a quantum phase transition at ~12.5 GPa. Below the quantum critical point (QCP), the superconductor has a SC ground state with a SM normal state or NFL behavior, while above the QCP, the sample displays a non-superconducting FL state. The pressureinduced quantum phase transition observed in the 1048 superconductor is highly reminiscent of what has been seen in the overdoped cuprate superconductors2,3,5,6,26 and Fe-based superconductor32,33, which show the same evolution upon increasing doping level and gating voltage.\nWe track the change of the coefficientA\u25a1 as a function of pressure before reaching the QCP. As shown in Fig. 3c, the coefficient A\u25a1 versus pressure displays a similar trend with Tc versus pressure. As A\n\u25a1 holds the maximum, the 1048 superconductor displays the highest Tc value. Once A\u25a1 is decreased by pressure, Tc exhibits a decrease correspondingly. More significantly, we find that the values of the coefficient A\u25a1 and Tc reach zero together at the QCP. The observation of the synchronized decrease of A\u25a1 and Tc with applied pressure leads us to propose that the coefficient A\u25a1 is a key factor for determining the Tc value of the high-Tc superconductors.\nRelationship between superconductivity and strange metal To establish the correlation between the SM normal state and Tc for the 1048 superconductor and compare it with doped cuprate and other superconductors, we plot the Tc dependence of the coefficient A\u25a1 in Fig. 4a and find a positive correlation of A\u25a1 with Tc. Scaling analysis on the two quantities finds that Tc versus A\u25a1 basically obeys the relation of Tc ~ (A\u25a1)0.5 (see the inset of Fig. 4a). To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst quantitativedescriptionof the correlationbetweenTc andA\u25a1 for the iron-pnictide superconductors through the pressure tuningmethod. For the sake of investigating the possible universality of the concurrent breakdown of the SM normal state and superconducting state, we have also performed hydrostatic pressure studies on Sr0.74Na0.26Fe2As2 superconductor, whosenormal resistance versus temperaturedisplays a FL state at ambient pressure but turns into a SM state at 5.9GPa (see Supplementary Fig. S3). The results obtained also show the concurrent breakdownsofA\u25a1 andTc at the samepressure point (see Supplementary Fig. S3c). Further, we compare our results with the experimental data obtained from chemically doped cuprate6,26,34 and iron-based superconductors8,35,36 and find a similar relationship between Tc and A\u25a1 (Fig. 4b), demonstrating that the stability of the superconducting phase has an intimate connectionwith the contribution from the electron state of determining the T-linear resistivity.\nIt has been proposed that antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations are responsible for both the superconducting and SM normal states in the high-Tc superconductors34,37. If the AFM fluctuations are the fundamental principle, then a theory to explain the detailed physics related to the behavior of the SM state, as revealed in this study, is also needed.\nIn conclusion, our results reveal that the application of pressure induces a quantumphase transition (QPT) from a SC ground state with a SM normal state to a non-superconducting FL state in the Ca10(Pt4As8)((Fe0.97Pt0.03)2As2)5 superconductor. The observed pressure-tuned co-evolution of the strange metal (SM) and superconducting (SC) states, as well as the concurrent breakdown of the SM and SC states at the quantum critical pressure (~12.5GPa), demonstrates how the coefficient A\u25a1, the slope of the linear-in-temperature resistivity normalized by the average distance between FeAs layers, determines the stability of the superconductivity and the value of Tc. Below the QCP, the coefficient A\u25a1 is continuously suppressed from a finite value, and the power component \u03b1 varies between 1 and 2. Above\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3116 3\nthe QCP, the SC state is fully suppressed, while A\u25a1 =0 and \u03b1 = 2 simultaneously, a hallmark of a pure Fermi liquid (FL) state. We have also observed the same phenomenon in pressurized Sr0.74Na0.26Fe2As2 superconductor. The scaling analysis for the obtained Tc and coefficient A\u25a1 in the compressed 1048 superconductor finds that it basically obeys the relation of Tc ~ (A\u25a1)0.5, exhibiting the similarity with what is seen in other chemically doped unconventional superconductors and demonstrating for the first time that the high-Tc superconductors with a SM normal state obey the same relation in Tc(A\u25a1), regardless of the type of the tuning method (doping or pressurizing), the crystal structure, the bulk or film superconductors and the nature of dopant (electrons or holes). The analysis of the generic relation between the Tc and the SM state for the cuprate and iron-based high-Tc superconductors reveals that the same physics\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3116 4\ngoverns the emergence and the stability of the high-Tc superconductivity."

In the experiments, we employed platinum foil as electrodes, rheniumplate as gasket and cubic boron nitride as insulating material.

In practice, the resistivity \u03c1 is commonly derived by the formula: R = \u03c1l/wt, where R is the measured resistance, l is the distance between the electrodes for the voltage measurements,w and t are the width and the thickness of the sample. In our experiments, we use a method suitable for layered compounds to extract A\u25a1 by fitting the resistance R in the form of R(T) =R0 +AT +BT2 instead of resistivity \u03c1 in the form of \u03c1(T) = \u03c10 +AT+BT2. By adopting thismethod,weanalyzed the pressure effect on the variation of the sample thickness that can be neglected.\nWe start with the following equation:\n\u03c1\u00f0T\u00de=\u03c10 +AT +BT2 \u00f01\u00de\nIf the twosides of the equationaremultipliedby l/wt, the equation can be written as:\nR\u00f0T\u00de= \u00f0l=wt\u00de\u03c10 + \u00f0l=wt\u00deAT + \u00f0l=wt\u00deBT2 \u00f02\u00de\nWhen A is expressed by A\u25a1 (A =A\u25a1d, d is the average distance between FeAs layers), then the equation can be changed to:\nR T\u00f0 \u00de= l=wt \u03c10 + \u00f0A&l=w\u00de\u00f0d=t\u00deT + \u00f0l=wt\u00deBT2 \u00f03\u00de\nLet us consider the case of R\u20320 = (l/wt)\u03c10, A\u2032 = (A\u25a1l/w)(d/t) and B\u2032 = (l/wt) B, the Eq. (3) can be expressed as:\nR\u00f0T\u00de=R00 +A0T +B0T2 \u00f04\u00de\nIn this study, R(T) measured at different pressures are fitted by Eq. (4). Since R\u20320, A\u2032 and B\u2032 are all the fitting parameters that can be obtained directly from the fitting results of R(T), these values of R\u20320, A\u2032 and B\u2032 are known. Then, we can use Eq. (5) to extract the pressure dependence of A\u25a1 for the 1048 superconductor:\nA& = \u00f0w=l\u00de\u00f0t=d\u00deA0 \u00f05\u00de\nNext, we analyze the pressure effect on the quantities in Eq. (5). Considering that the 1048 superconductor possesses the tetragonal structure16\u2014its lattice parameter a = b, we propose that the width (w) and distance (l) between the electrodes for the voltage measurements of our ambient-pressure sample can be expressed as:\nw0 =Xa\nl0 = Ya\nwhere X and Y are the numbers of the unit cells, and a is the lattice parameter, respectively. The ratio ofw0/l0 equals X/Y. Sincew and l are the function of lattice parameter a, its ratio (wp/lp) at different pressures should be the same as that obtained at ambient pressure, i.e., w0/l0=wp/lp = X/Y. This allows us to employ the ratio of w0/l0 for the determination of A\u25a1 as a function of pressure. The values of w0 and l0 can be found in the section \u201cExperimental details for high-pressure measurements.\u201d\nSince the bulk 1048 superconductor is composed of a number of unit cells, sample thickness t can thus be expressed as t=Nc, where c is the lattice parameter perpendicular to the FeAs layer in the unit cell, and N is the number of the unit cells. It has been known that each unit cell of the 1048 superconductor contains only one FeAs layer (Fig. 1a); thus, the average distance between the FeAs layer, d, equals the lattice parameter c (d= c). At ambient pressure, the ratio of the thickness t0 and the\naverage distance between FeAs layer d0 should be in the form of:\nt0=d0 =N \u00f06\u00de\nBecause both values of t and d are the function of lattice parameter c, when pressure is applied, the ratio of tp/dp still equals N, i.e., tp/dp = t0/d0 =N. This allows us to use the ratio of t0/d0 to establish the pressure dependence of tp/dp. The t0/d0 can be found in our experimental details and ref. 16.\nBased on the above analysis, through the fitting R(T)measured at different pressures, the coefficient A\u25a1 can be extracted as:\nA&\u00f0P\u00de= \u00f0w0=l0\u00de\u00f0t0=d0\u00deA0 \u00f07\u00de"
