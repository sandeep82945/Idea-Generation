We compare the DM distribution of Parkes and FAST, taking advantage of the similarity between their multibeam receivers. Notwithstanding the limited sample size, we observe a paucity of events at low DM for all evolutionary models considered, resulting in a sharp rise in the observed cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the region of 1000 . DM . 2000 pc cm\u22123. These traits could be due to statistical fluctuations (0.12 \u2264 p \u2264 0.22), a complicated energy distribution or break in an energy distribution power law, spatial clustering, observational bias or outliers in the sample (e.g., an excessiveDMHost as recently found for FRB20190520B). The energy distribution in this regime is unlikely to be adequately constrained until further events are detected. Modelling suggests that FAST may be well placed to discriminate between redshift evolutionary models and to probe the helium ionisation signal of the IGM.",

            "text": "The FRB population has been established as being cosmological in nature, with dispersion measures (DMs) typically comprising dominant contributions attributable to propagation through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Under such circumstances, it is viable to use the measured FRB DM as a proxy for redshift (see Macquart et al. 2020, and references therein).\nIn a previous work (Arcus et al. 2020, hereinafter Paper I), we utilised the M&E 2018 model of Macquart & Ekers (2018b) to compare the FRB DM distributions, determined from Parkes and ASKAP radio telescope samples, to infer the common FRB population parameters of fluence spectral index, \ud835\udefc, and the energy function slope, \ud835\udefe, assuming a power law energy function. Therein we further assumed the telescopes observed the same FRB population and made use of the fact that the telescopes had different survey fluence limits, \ud835\udc390 (Arcus et al. 2020).We found: i) no evidence that the FRB population evolves faster than linearly with respect to the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) for the population sample analysed; ii) the spectral index and energy curve slope were degenerate; and iii) the modelled ASKAP and Parkes DM distributions were consistent with a range of source evolution models.\nIn this work, we utilise, a priori, these same fitted parameters to model the DM distribution predicted to be observed by FAST \u2013 the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (see, e.g.,\n\u2605 E-mail: wayne.arcus@icrar.org (WA)\nLi et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2020; Niu et al. 2021b). We admit FAST samples in order to introduce higher sensitivity readings, thereby probing deeper into the Universe and enhancing observational discrimination. Moreover, given that Parkes and FAST utilise a nearly identical multibeam receiver (19 versus 13 beams), this permits a similar analysis to be undertaken in order to reduce systematic errors.\nWe extend the approach described in Paper I by accounting for the telescope beam pattern, generalising the fitted sensitivity relation of the telescope\u2019s back-end and by accounting for temporal smearing following the approach of Cordes & McLaughlin (2003).\nFurthermore, we examine the FRB DM distribution predicted to be detected byFAST, and compare these resultswith the published FAST FRB event data, noting that, hitherto, only a very limited FRB event sample is available.\nIn \u00a72, we describe modifications made to the DM distribution model and we compare the resultant distributions with published FRB events. In \u00a73 and \u00a74 we discuss, respectively, the implications of our results (which may have relevance to SKA1-mid) and our conclusions."

For a detected burst of width,\ud835\udc64, the detection sensitivity varies as \ud835\udc64\u22121/2 (Cordes &McLaughlin 2003), resulting from the burst energy being spread over time. Here, we are primarily interested in DM-dependent effects, introduced by different spectral and temporal resolutions used for incoherent de-dispersion searches. The effects of scattering are included in the distribution of FRB widths modelled in Paper I, so that only differences in FRB widths (e.g. due to scattering) between Parkes and FAST will skew our model. There is, however, no evidence for a correlation between DM and scattering (see, e.g., Amiri et al. 2021, \u00a77.3) and it is unclear in which direction a correlation would trend (see e.g. discussion in James et al. 2021) and we do not expect a significant effect.

            "text": "The Parkes and FAST DM distributions are depicted in Figure 2, as both Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs), along with the corresponding CDFs from observed FRB events. The FAST sample is listed in Table 3 and the Parkes sample (depicted for reference purposes) is drawn from Arcus et al. (2020, Table 1).\nParkes DM distribution curves of Figure 2 were determined by simultaneously fitting multiple population parameters between Parkes and ASKAP as undertaken in Paper I. The three evolutionary models for Parkes in Figure 2 are therefore good fits as they use fitted variables. The modelled FAST distributions are, however, predicted, using the same fitted population parameters of Table 1 and the FAST telescope parameters of Table 2. The modelled DM distributions (solid curves) show a similar overall shape and suggest that FAST\u2019s higher sensitivity, compared to other FRB-finding instruments, gives it a superior ability to discriminate between redshift evolutionary models at DM & 1400 pc cm\u22123 .\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test of the FAST observational data, with respect to the modelled DM distributions for the three evolutionary models, yields p-values of: \ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 0) = 0.22; \ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 1) = 0.19; and \ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 2) = 0.12. This indicates there is only mild evidence that the observations are inconsistent with all of the evolutionary models, notwithstanding statistical robustness due to the limited sample size.\nThe observed FAST DM distribution suggests an apparent paucity of FRB events at low DM (i.e., DM . 1000 pc cm\u22123) in relation to the modelled scenarios, along with a potential sharp rise in the CDF between 1000 pc cm\u22123 . DM . 2000 pc cm\u22123. None of the evolutionary models predict a paucity of events at low DM, however. This could conceivably be due to a number of factors, including:\n(i) A complicated energy distribution or break in a single power law distribution function (e.g. a turn-over to a flatter power-law at low energies would reduce the number of near-Universe FRBs). (ii) Searches may be biased against either low or high DM events (e.g., a deficit of low-DM FRBs may result from a bias against lowDM events due to RFI discrimination, \u2013 see, e.g., Amiri et al. (2021) regarding bias against low DM events due to RFI). (iii) The area of sky surveyed with a high-sensitivity telescope may be sufficiently small such that the distribution of FRBs on the sky is non-uniform (i.e., the DM distribution is inhomogeneous due to cosmic variance; such an effect will likely remain untestable until sufficient deep surveys over large areas become available). (iv) The FRB sample may contain outliers (e.g., FRB 20190520B has recently been determined to have a large DMHost excess, DMHost = 903+72\u2212111 pc cm\n\u22123 Niu et al. (2021a)), which may explain the bulk of the paucity observed given the low number statistics involved4).\nEvent rates are more likely to be affected by evolution at higher look-back times \u2013 i.e., at higher redshifts or DMs. We do not consider the low DM paucity to be attributable to evolution in the sensitivity regime of FAST. This raises the interesting prospect of whether a break in the energy function exists. Further samples will be required to break the degeneracy between the evolution models and the energy curve slope: local FRBs with fluence and redshift measurements would be required.\nWhilst the CHIME collaboration recently published its first FRB catalogue (Amiri et al. 2021), we note that the CHIME telescope has a very different frequency range to FAST and it is unclear whether these results would be scalable for a comparative analysis. Furthermore, CHIME has a significantly different and complicated beam-pattern that would need to be treated in such an analysis. A new factor, however, is that CHIME provides some evidence for cross correlation between FRBs with large scale cosmic structure (Rafiei-Ravandi et al. 2021): a correlation between galaxies at lower redshift (i.e., 0.3 . \ud835\udc67 . 0.5). Additionally, a correlation of FRBs at higher DM \u223c 800 pc cm\u22123 are noted, which may indicate that FRBs are arriving with DMs higher than expected, potentially resulting in the observed FAST FRB paucity at low-DM and an excess of FRBs with higher DM.\nMacquart & Ekers (2018b) discussed at length the potential to detect the helium ionisation signal of the IGM in the redshift and DM distributions using the M&E 2018 model. We note that this signal is visible in the modelled FAST DM distribution of Figure 2 (top right panel), at DM \u223c 2660 pc cm\u22123 (assumed to occur at \ud835\udc67 = 2.5). We therefore expect FAST to be well placed to probe this signature should sufficient FRB events be detected spanning this region of DM-space.\nThe DM distributions modelled herein do not account for evolution of DMHost with redshift. The contributions to the DM of the IGM and host galaxy are inseparable and the problem is unconstrained. The host contribution is often treated as a non-redshift evolving parcel of plasma via the term DMHost/(1 + \ud835\udc67), where DMHost is interpreted as dispersion in the host galaxy\u2019s rest frame (see, e.g., Macquart et al. 2020). A detailed investigation of this aspect is out of scope for this paper, and we defer such work to a future paper, which may be explored via simulation.\n4 Presently we do not account for such outliers, neither in modelling nor data vetting, so as to not bias our analysis.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)"

            "text": "We extend and apply the M&E 2018 model along with the fitted multiple population parameters determined in Paper I to the published FAST FRB events in order to compare the predicted DM distributions of FAST with respect to Parkes. We model three redshift evolutionary scenarios and assume a log power law energy function.\nWhilst the published FAST sample size is limited, we observe a paucity of events at low DM relative to all evolutionary models, including a sharp rise in the observed CDF in the region of 1000 . DM . 2000 pc cm\u22123. (These two traits are not separate effects.) These observations are consistent with statistical fluctuations (\ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 0) = 0.22; \ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 1) = 0.19; and \ud835\udc5d\u2032(\ud835\udc5b = 2) = 0.12). Whilst these traits could be due to a number of factors including statistical fluctuations (\ud835\udc5d \u2264 0.22) due to the small sample size, it may point towards a break in the energy function at the low energy regime or to an energy function turn-over.\nThe energy distribution is unlikely to be able to be adequately determined until further events are detected in this high-sensitivity regime. To break the degeneracy between the energy distribution and redshift evolution, we would require FRBs with similar energy at different redshifts. Identifying rare high-energy FRBs at lower redshift will require large FoV survey telescopes.\nFASThas the greatest sensitivity to FRB source evolution in the region 2000 . DM . 3000 pc cm\u22123, as indicated by the relative separation of the CDFs for the different evolutionary models in Figure 2, suggesting this would be the best DM region to constrain evolution.\nThe cooled Parkes Phased Array Feed, currently under construction, will provide up to 88 beams; increasing the FoV by a factor of \u223c 5 with similar sensitivity as the original Parkes survey and with well-characterised beams. Future instruments such as MeerKAT and later SKA-mid telescopes are expected to approach the sensitivity of FAST with potentially a much larger FoV, should sufficient coherent beams be formed. These instruments should increase the high-redshift FRB sample size thus improving the statistics.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20139 (2022)"
