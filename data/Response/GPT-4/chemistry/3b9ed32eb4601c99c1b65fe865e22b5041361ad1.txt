Pharmacological Evaluation of Newly Identified Alkaloids: Given the identification of previously unreported alkaloids, such as vomicine, hirsuteine, alstonine, akuammidine, and tryptamine, future research could focus on evaluating the pharmacological properties of these compounds. Studies could investigate their potential anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, antimutagenic, antipsychotic, and other therapeutic effects in more detail, using both in vitro and in vivo models.

Comparative Metabolomics Across Different Mitragyna Species: The study highlights the rich alkaloid diversity within M. speciosa leaves. Expanding this approach to compare the metabolite profiles of other Mitragyna species could reveal new bioactive compounds and further understand the genus's pharmacological potential.

Impact of Environmental Factors on Metabolite Composition: Since metabolite composition can vary with environmental conditions, conducting studies to understand how factors such as soil type, climate, and geographical location affect the secondary metabolite profiles of M. speciosa would be valuable. This research could lead to optimized cultivation practices for enhancing the production of desired alkaloids.

Mechanistic Studies on Alkaloid Biosynthesis: The study suggests young leaves may have a different set of metabolically active compounds compared to mature leaves, with implications for alkaloid biosynthesis. Research focused on elucidating the biosynthetic pathways of the newly identified alkaloids in M. speciosa, including the role of young versus mature leaves in these pathways, would be valuable for understanding how these compounds are produced within the plant.

Safety and Toxicology Assessment of M. speciosa Extracts: Given the therapeutic potential of M. speciosa and the identification of a wide range of alkaloids with various biological activities, comprehensive safety and toxicology studies are necessary. This research should aim to assess the long-term effects, potential toxicity, and safe dosage ranges of M. speciosa extracts and their individual alkaloid components, especially considering the controversy surrounding its use and potential for abuse.
