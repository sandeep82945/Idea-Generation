Further, the purpose was as follows: (1) to develop a new adaptation of intensive ERP for SAD, based on B4DT; (2) study changes in SAD symptoms in an adolescent girl with severe SAD; and (3) to study the long- term treatment effect over a period of 28\u00a0months. We hypothesized that an adapted version of treatment protocol (B4DT) would be an accepted treatment and result in significant symptom reduction, equal to CBT,5 and that these effects would be maintained over time."

As the patient was a minor, informed consent was received from her parents before assessment and treatment. The patient was referred by her school counselor. She had severe anxiety, predominantly in social situations, negatively affecting her academics as well as her social life and general well- being. The problems were reported to have escalated due to her transfer from a smaller to a larger school. There was a history of performing academically well with high demands on her own performance. At the time of assessment, she described previous depressive mood, but not present at the time and no suicidal ideations or substance use.\nThe patient's goals were to increase her social skills at school and to be more socially active. Her long- term goal was to enroll in higher education after graduating high school. Overall, the patient described high motivation for treatment although expressing concerns about how treatment would interfere with school.\nPsychiatric assessment using MINI- KID was conducted confirming the DSM 5 diagnosis SAD (300.23).1 The patient also displayed symptoms of general anxiety and panic disorder."

For the subscale anxiety/fear, the rating is from 0 (no fear) to 3 (severe fear).

Cutoff values for the total score LSAS- SR are suggested to be 30 when used as a screening for SAD and where a score of 60 or higher indicates a generalized social anxiety.8\n2.3.2 | The children's global assessment scale The children's global assessment scale (C- GAS)9 is a clinician- rated scale, assessing areas of functioning in the child's life, spanning from family life, social relations, and school functioning during the month prior to the evaluation. The scoring is 0\u2013 100, with stepwise values of 10 points per step. A cutoff value of 70\u00a0clearly differentiates normal functioning from more severe problems.10 C- GAS has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument.11\n2.3.3 | Global assessment of functioning The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a reliable clinician- rated scale measuring the extent to how mental illness affects an individual's global functioning.12 GAF has a moderate interrater reliability.11 GAF is scored in stepwise values 0\u2013 100, 1\u2013 10 indicating the lowest level of functioning to 90\u2013 100\u00a0equally to very well.

Cognitive restructuring and identifying automatic thoughts and emotions were introduced in office, and applied in practice during the in vivo exposures.\nThe three days of intervention out of office are composed of continuous therapist- guided exposures based on the conceptualization described above. The exposure situations were performed in vivo, in the city center and in situations entailing social interactions. At the end of each day of exposure, the patient summed up her day by writing a letter to an imagined friend. The rationale for this was to ensure the patients apprehension of the interventions. The following week the patient was instructed to keep working on her exposure on her own.\nAt the one- week post- treatment follow- up, she reported her exposures and assessment of LSAS- SR and CGAS was carried out."

            "text": "This case study presented a treatment protocol for SAD including condensed CBT with intensive interventions with in vivo exposure based on an adaptation of the Norwegian B4DT. The treatment was highly accepted by the patient and required no more time than the conventional therapy. A standard treatment of CBT for SAD, according to the NICE guidelines, ranges between 12 and 20\u00a0h.5\nAt 28th month follow- up, the patient is classified as a treatment responder with >28% reduction of LSASSR- scores and the patient no longer met the criteria for SAD or any other DSM 5 diagnosis. She presented normal levels of functioning. We concluded that the response to treatment was good and persistent over time and that the treatment was well accepted by the patient.\nThis case study shows promising results that a concentrated format of CBT with an intensive exposure therapy for SAD, based on the B4DT, to be suitable for further exploration for treatment of adolescents. The protocol is more compatible for youth as a short- term adjunct to their everyday life with school and extracurricular activities.\nThe limitation of this study is that it is a single case study and further studies are needed to observe the replicability of these results on a group level. The patient in this study had severe SAD; however, she did not meet any other diagnostic criteria at the time of the study. SAD has a high level of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and further studies should take this into account and consider wider inclusion criteria."
