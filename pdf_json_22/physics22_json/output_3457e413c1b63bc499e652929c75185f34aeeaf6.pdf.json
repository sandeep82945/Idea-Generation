    "abstractText": "We present a novel and global three-dimensional reduction of a non-dimensionalised version of the four-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley equations [J. Rubin and M. Wechselberger, Giant squid\u2013hidden canard: the 3D geometry of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, Biological Cybernetics, 97 (2007), pp. 5\u201332] that is based on geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). We investigate the dynamics of the resulting three-dimensional system in two parameter regimes in which the flow evolves on three distinct timescales. Specifically, we demonstrate that the system exhibits bifurcations of oscillatory dynamics and complex mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), in accordance with the geometric mechanisms introduced in [P. Kaklamanos, N. Popovi\u0107, and K. U. Kristiansen, Bifurcations of mixed\u2013mode oscillations in three\u2013timescale systems: An extended prototypical example, Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 32 (2022), p. 013108], and we classify the various firing patterns in terms of the external applied current. While such patterns have been documented in [S. Doi, S. Nabetani, and S. Kumagai, Complex nonlinear dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations induced by time scale changes, Biological Cybernetics, 85 (2001), pp. 51\u201364] for the multiple-timescale Hodgkin-Huxley equations, we elucidate the geometry that underlies the transitions between them, which had not been previously emphasised.",

            "text": "The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations comprise a model that describes the generation of action potentials in the squid giant axon [11]. The particular importance of these equations is due to the fact that they constitute one of the most successful mathematical models for the quantitative description of biological phenomena, as the underlying formalism is directly applicable to many types of neurons and other cells [6, 13].\nThe three currents that the squid axon carries are the voltage-gated persistent potassium (K+) current, the voltage-gated transient sodium (Na+) current, and the Ohmic leak current, which are given by the expressions\nINa(V,m, h) = gNa (V \u2212 ENa)m3h, IK(V, n) = gK (V \u2212 EK)n4, and IL(V ) = gL (V \u2212 EL) , (1)\nrespectively; here, V denotes the membrane potential, in units of mV, andm and h are the activation and inactivation variables of the Na+ ion channel, respectively, while n is the activation variable of the K+ channel.

With these definitions, the original HH equations [11, 6, 13] read\nCV\u0307 = I \u2212 INa(V,m, h)\u2212 IK(V, n)\u2212 IL(V ),\nm\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4mt\u0302m (V ) (m\u221e (V )\u2212m) ,\nh\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4ht\u0302h (V ) (h\u221e (V )\u2212 h) ,\nn\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4nt\u0302n (V ) (n\u221e (V )\u2212 n) ,\n(2)\nwhere C denotes the capacitance density, in units of \u00b5F/cm2, and I is the applied current, in units of \u00b5A/cm2, while the constants \u03c4x and the voltage-dependent parameters t\u0302x(V ) (x = m,h, n) are associated with the characteristic timescales of the corresponding channel gates. Moreover,\nt\u0302x (V ) = 1\n\u03b1x (V ) + \u03b2x (V ) and x\u221e (V ) =\n\u03b1x (V )\n\u03b1x (V ) + \u03b2x (V ) , with x = m,h, n, (3)\nwhere the functions \u03b1x (V ) and \u03b2x (V ) are defined as\n\u03b1m (V ) = (25\u2212 V ) /10 e(25\u2212V )/10 \u2212 1 , \u03b1h (v) = 7 100 e\u2212V/20, \u03b1n (v) = (10\u2212 V ) /100 e(10\u2212V )/10 \u2212 1\n\u03b2m (V ) = 4e \u2212V/18, \u03b2h (v) =\n1\n1 + e(30\u2212V )/10 , and \u03b2n (v) =\n1 4 e\u2212V/80\nin the original form of (2). In [6], the parameters I, \u03c4m, \u03c4h, and \u03c4n are considered bifurcation parameters, while the values of the remaining parameters are fixed as\nC = 1 \u00b5F/cm2, gNa = 120 mS/cm, gK = 36 mS/cm, gL = 0.3 mS/cm,\nENa = 115 mV, EK = \u221212 mV, and EL = 10.599 mV.\nWhen either \u03c4h or \u03c4n is large, it is demonstrated in [6] that the equations in (2) evolve on multiple timescales, which gives rise to mixed-mode dynamics. Mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) are trajectories that consist of small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs) alternating with large-amplitude excursions (LAOs); see Fig. 1 for an illustration of the corresponding time series of v. In the twotimescale context, mixed-mode dynamics has been described via the so-called \u201cgeneralised canard mechanism\u201d which is based on a combination of Fenichel\u2019s geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) [7] and the desingularisation technique known as \u201cblow-up\u201d [18]. In that context, SAOs typically occur in the neighbourhood of folded singularities that are of folded node type [28, 1, 4]; trajectories that escape the vicinities of these folded singularities after undergoing SAOs are then reinjected by a suitable global return mechanism, giving rise to MMO trajectories. In the context of multiple-scale systems with more than two scales, mixed-mode dynamics frequently arises due to the presence of folded singularities of folded saddle-node type [17, 19, 21] which give rise to complex and irregular oscillatory behaviour, as is also the case here. Thus, for instance, the oscillatory trajectories illustrated in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 exhibit double epochs of slow dynamics. Here, we refer to time series with double epochs as featuring slow segments or SAOs which are centred around two distinct values of v and which we hence denote by slow dynamics \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d, respectively. By contrast, in panels (d) and (e), trajectories only exhibit epochs of slow dynamics \u201cbelow\u201d which are separated by large excursions (spikes); finally, the trajectory in panel (f) exhibits\n3 no epochs of slow dynamics. As will become apparent from our analysis, in that case only dynamics on the fastest and an additional, \u201cintermediate\u201d timescale occur. (Here, we note that the scaling of the t-axes in Fig. 1 differs by panel; correspondingly, the \u201cbelow\u201d segments in panel (f) are in fact steeper than the \u201cabove\u201d segments in panels (a), (b), and (c).).\nIn [16], geometric mechanisms were described that distinguish oscillatory trajectories with double epochs of slow dynamics \u2013 as shown in panels (a) and (b) \u2013 from those with single epochs thereof, as seen in panels (d) and (e), as well as from relaxation oscillation in a general family of three-timescale systems; see panel (f). A further distinction can be made between the trajectories with double epochs in panels (a) and (b) and the \u201ctransitional\u201d mixed-mode dynamics observed in panel (c) in which epochs of slow dynamics above and below are separated by LAOs; see Section 3 for details. While the above qualitative distinction was documented in [6], the mechanisms that are responsible for transitions between the various firing patterns were not emphasised.\nTo our knowledge, the first attempt at studying the multiple-timescale HH model, Equation (2), on the basis of GSPT was made by Rubin and Wechselberger [23, 24]. They applied the scaling\nv = V\nkv , \u03c4 =\nt\nkt , I\u0304 =\nI\nkvgNa ,\nE\u0304x = Ex kv , and g\u0304x = gx gNa\nfor x = Na,K,L,\n(4)\nwith kv = 100 mV and kt = 1 ms, and considered the following dimensionless version of Equation (2),\nv\u0307 = I\u0304 \u2212 ( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3h\u2212 g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304K ) n4 \u2212 g\u0304L ( v \u2212 E\u0304L ) ,\nm\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4mt\u0302m (v) (m\u221e (v)\u2212m) ,\nh\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4ht\u0302h (v) (h\u221e (v)\u2212 h) ,\nn\u0307 = 1\n\u03c4nt\u0302n (v) (n\u221e (v)\u2212 n) ,\n(5)\nwhere\n= C\nkt \u00b7 gNa ' 0.0083. (6)\nHere, the functions t\u0302x (v) and x\u221e (v) are defined as in (3), with\n\u03b1m (v) = (v + 40) /10\n1\u2212 e\u2212(v+40)/10 , \u03b1h (v) =\n7\n100 e\u2212(v+65)/20, \u03b1n (v) =\n(v + 55) /100\n1\u2212 e\u2212(v+55)/10 ,\n\u03b2m (v) = 4e \u2212(v+65)/18, \u03b2h (v) =\n1\n1 + e\u2212(v+35)/10 , and \u03b2n (v) =\n1 4 e\u2212(v+65)/80;\nin addition, the parameters in (5) now read\nI\u0304 = I\nkugNa , g\u0304K = 0.3, g\u0304L = 0.0025,\nE\u0304Na = 0.5, E\u0304K = \u22120.77, and E\u0304L = \u22120.544. (7)\nThe dimensionless Equation (5) captures the different firing patterns that emerge in Equation (2) as I is varied, whereas the remaining parameters are fixed, as documented in [6] and illustrated in Fig. 1.\n5 We note that, due to the non-dimensionalisation in (5) by Rubin and Wechselberger [23], the corresponding I-values differ from those in [6]; moreover, we remark that for ease of comparison and numerical convenience, Fig. 1 refers to I rather than to its rescaled counterpart I\u0304 in Equation (5).\nUnder the above assumptions, the parameter defined in (6) can be considered a small perturbation parameter. Moreover, the order of magnitude of the characteristic timescale [t\u0302m(v)]\n\u22121 is larger than those of [t\u0302h(v)] \u22121 and [t\u0302n(v)] \u22121, as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nFollowing [23], we consider the rescaling\nTx = max v\u2208(E\u0304K ,E\u0304Na)\n1\nt\u0302x(v) for x = m,h, n (8)\nand we define\ntx(v) := Txt\u0302x(v). (9)\nDenoting further V (v,m, h, n) := I\u0304 \u2212 ( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3h\u2212 g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304K ) n4 \u2212 g\u0304L ( v \u2212 E\u0304L ) , (10)\nM(v,m) := m\u221e (v)\u2212m\ntm (v) , (11)\nH(v, h) := h\u221e (v)\u2212 h th (v) , (12) N(v, n) := n\u221e (v)\u2212 n tn (v) , and (13)\n\u03b4x := Tx \u03c4x , with x = m,h, n, (14)\n6 one can write\nv\u0307 = V (v,m, h, n)\nm\u0307 = \u03b4mM(v,m),\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h),\nn\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n).\n(15)\nIn the following, we will suppress the dependence of the system in (15) on the parameter I\u0304, and will only remark on it as required.\nFrom Fig. 2, it is apparent that Tm ' 10, while Th ' Tn ' 1. Based on this observation, in [23] it was assumed that \u03b4\u22121m = O( ); thus, (15) was written as\nv\u0307 = V (v,m, h, n) ,\nm\u0307 = M(v,m),\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h),\nn\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n),\n(16)\nwhere (v,m) are the fast variables and (h, n) are the slow ones. On the basis of centre manifold theory, Rubin and Wechselberger [23] then derived the following three-dimensional reduction of (16),\nv\u0307 = I\u0304 \u2212 ( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3\u221e(v)h\u2212 g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304K ) n4 \u2212 g\u0304L ( v \u2212 E\u0304L ) = V (v,m\u221e, h, n) ,\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h),\nn\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n),\n(17)\nwhere the variable m has been eliminated. However, in their analysis, they considered 0 < 1 and \u03b4x = O(1) (x = h, n). As a consequence, only MMO trajectories with single epochs of SAOs were documented in previous works [23, 24], in contrast to [6, Figure 2]; cf. panels (d), (e), and (f) of Fig. 1. As argued in [4], in the two-timescale case \u2013 where SAOs arise due to the presence of a folded node singularity [28] \u2013 the parameter regimes in which MMOs with double SAO epochs are apparent seem very narrow. By contrast, such MMOs become more prominent in a three-timescale context, which further attests to our claim that the physiologically relevant mixed-mode dynamics of the HH model, Equation (5), cannot be fully understood via a standard two-timescale analysis.\nRemark 1. The timescale separation at all levels can be controlled by merely varying the parameters \u03c4x (x = m,h, n) in (5) or, equivalently, by variation of \u03b4x in (15).\nMain results\nIn this work, we incorporate the assumption that the variable m is slower than v, but faster than h and n, in accordance with [23, Remark 1], which we formulate as follows:\nAssumption 1. Let \u03b5 := \u03b4\u22121m , and define \u03b3 > 0 such that\n= \u03b3\u03b5.\nThen, we assume that\n0 < \u03b3, \u03b5 1\nin (15), with , \u03b3, and \u03b5 positive and sufficiently small.\n7 Our first main result is the following: for ' 0.0083 and \u03b4m ' 10, we have \u03b5 ' 0.1 and \u03b3 = 0.083. Then, Assumption 1 allows us to apply GSPT to derive a global three-dimensional reduction of Equation (5) of the form\n\u03b5v\u0307 = U(v, h, n; I\u0304 , \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h, \u03b4n), h\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h), n\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n); (18)\nsee Theorem 1 in Section 2 below. Motivated by [6], we then consider the two regimes where either h or n in Equation (18) is assumed to be evolving on the slowest timescale. In other words, we first take \u03b4h > 0 to be small, with \u03b4n = O(1); then, we consider the regime where \u03b4h = O(1), with \u03b4n > 0 small, and we show that these two regimes are not fundamentally different in terms of their singular geometry and of the resulting mixed-mode dynamics.\nUnder these additional assumptions, our second main result is that transitions from mixed-mode dynamics with double epochs of slow dynamics via single-epoch MMOs to relaxation oscillation in the three-timescale system, Equation (18), can be explained by the geometric mechanisms introduced in [16]. Specifically, we identify invariant manifolds in (18) and decompose the dynamics into segments evolving on fast, intermediate, and slow timescales. Then, qualitative properties of oscillatory trajectories of (18) can be deduced based on the geometric configuration of these manifolds and the reduced flows thereon; in particular, we show that these properties are determined by the relative positions of so-called folded singularities, which can be either \u201cconnected\u201d, \u201caligned\u201d, or \u201cremote\u201d, in accordance with the classification in [16]. The rescaled applied current I\u0304 will emerge as the relevant bifurcation parameter. We illustrate the underlying geometry schematically in Fig. 3; see the corresponding caption for details. In sum, we thus obtain a full description of the dynamics of (18) under the assumption of timescale separation between the three variables therein, which is motivated by the physiological properties of the particular system under consideration. We emphasise that, although the original HH equations in (2) have been studied extensively and are by now fairly well understood, the methodology presented here extends to a wide class of multiplescale systems that can be expressed in an HH-type formalism, such as models for calcium-induced calcium release, cardiac dynamics, circadian and homeostatic processes, and other physiological phenomena [2, 5, 8, 12, 20, 22, 27], to mention but a few.\nThe article is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present a novel, global geometric reduction of Equation (5) after elimination of the variable m. We relate the dynamics of the resulting, three-dimensional slow-fast system, Equation (18), to that of Equation (15), as well as to the local centre manifold reduction proposed by Rubin and Wechselberger [23], Equation (17). We then consider the scenario where Equation (18) exhibits dynamics on three timescales, in which case the full system in (5) \u2013 or, equivalently, in (15) \u2013 exhibits dynamics on four timescales. In Section 3 and Section 4, the variables h and n are taken to be slow, respectively; we demonstrate that the geometric mechanisms proposed in [16] can explain bifurcations of MMOs that have been previously documented, but not emphasised in the context of GSPT, in the literature [6]. We conclude the article in Section 5 with a summary, and an outlook to future work. Finally, in Appendix A, we give a brief overview of SAO-generating mechanisms in a three-timescale context."

The constraint that v \u2208 (E\u0304K , E\u0304Na) is a physiological one, set by the underlying Nernst potentials: when v = E\u0304K , respectively when v = E\u0304Na, the corresponding current, denoted by I\u0304K ,\n9 respectively by I\u0304Na, is zero; see [13] for details. A mathematical interpretation of this restriction is given in Remark 2 below.\nEquation (20) is singularly perturbed with respect to the small parameter \u03b3 and features three distinct timescales if \u03b4h, \u03b4n = O(1), with v the fast variable, m the intermediate one, and h and n the slow ones.

There exists \u03b30 sufficiently small such that, for every \u03b3 \u2208 (0, \u03b30), the HH equations in (20) admit a three-dimensional attracting slow manifoldM1\u03b3 that is diffeomorphic, and O (\u03b3)-close to, the compact manifold M1 in the Hausdorff distance. The manifold M1\u03b3 can be written as a graph m = \u00b5(v, h, n) +O(\u03b3) and is locally invariant under the flow of\nv\u2032 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h) \u2202h\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n) \u2202n\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) +O (\u03b3)\n=: U(v, h, n; \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h, \u03b4n),\nh\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h), n\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n).\n(25)\nProof. The existence ofM1\u03b3 and its diffeomorphic relation to, and distance from, M1 follow from Fenichel\u2019s First Theorem [7], since the critical manifold M1 is normally hyperbolic everywhere in D, by (22) and (23). In particular, M1\u03b3 is given as a graph of m over (v, h, n), with\nm = \u00b5(v, h, n) + \u03b3\u00b51(v, h, n; \u03b3, \u03b5), (26)\n10\nwhich is smooth jointly in v, h, n, \u03b3, and \u03b5. The attractivity ofM1\u03b3 follows from Fenichel\u2019s Second Theorem [7], since, by (23), the manifold M1 is attracting everywhere. (See also [10] for a concise discussion of Fenichel\u2019s First and Second Theorems.)\nFinally, Equation (25) for the flow on the slow manifoldM1\u03b3 is obtained as follows. The equations for h and n in (25) follow immediately from (20), as the dynamics of h and n is independent of m. To derive the v-equation in (25), we first differentiate (26) with respect to \u03c3. (Here, we reiterate that \u03c3 = t/ is the independent variable in (19) and (20).) Next, we substitute the right-hand sides of the equations for m, h, and n in (20) into the resulting expression and then solve for v\u2032, collecting terms.\nWe remark that, for \u03b3 = 0.083 and g\u0304L = 0.0025, the latter may be considered negligible with regard to the existence and hyperbolicity ofM\u03b3 ; for instance, the inequality in (23) would also hold for g\u0304L = 0 therein, by the definition of D. Theorem 1 implies that, for \u03b3 positive and sufficiently small, the dynamics of the full, four-dimensional HH model, Equation (20), is captured by the threedimensional reduction in (25), where we have eliminated the variable m via the graph representation in (26). We remark that (25) is a regular perturbation problem in \u03b3 in the slow formulation of GSPT; as the dynamics of (25) with \u03b3 > 0 sufficiently small is therefore qualitatively similar, and O(\u03b3)-close, to that of (25)\u03b3=0, we will restrict to considering the limit of \u03b3 = 0 for simplicity. In the language of GSPT, we will hence approximate the slow flow on M1\u03b3 by the reduced flow of (20) on M1, where the former is a regular perturbation of the latter [7]:\nv\u2032 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h) \u2202h\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n) \u2202n\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) , h\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h), n\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n).\n(27)\nOn the other hand, the systems in (25) and (27) are singular perturbation problems in standard form with respect to the parameter \u03b5; hence, their dynamics for \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small can be studied via GSPT. Moreover, the O(\u03b5)-terms on the right-hand side of (25) contribute to local qualitative phenomena, which in turn affect the resulting global mixed-mode dynamics. These terms can therefore not be neglected in our analysis; see Appendix A and [16] for details.\nIn the following, we will refer to the system in (27) as our three-dimensional reduction of the HH equations. That system is written in the fast formulation of GSPT; the corresponding layer problem is obtained by setting \u03b5 = 0 therein:\nv\u2032 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) , h\u2032 = 0, n\u2032 = 0.\n(28)\nThe set of equilibria of (28) defines the two-dimensional critical manifold M2 as\nm\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) = 0, (29)\nwhich is equivalent to requiring that\nV (v,m\u221e(v), h, n) = 0; (30)\nrecall (10) for the definition of V (v,m, h, n). We emphasise that Equation (27) and the centre manifold reduction in (17) that was introduced in [23] admit the same critical manifold M2 as\n11\nis defined by (29) \u2013 or, equivalently, by (30). In other words, the algebraic constraint in (29) corresponds to the v-nullcline in (17), recall (10); see [23] for details. However, although the factor of [\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n)]\n\u22121 in the v-equation of (27) is positive, there are qualitative differences in the dynamics of the two systems due to the O(\u03b5)-terms that occur in (27), as discussed in Appendix A.\nThe manifold M2 is normally hyperbolic everywhere except on FM2 , where\n\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] = 0. (31)\nFor future reference, we note that \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] = \u2212 ( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3\u221e(v) > 0 and\n\u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] = \u22124g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304k ) n3 < 0\n(32)\nfor v \u2208 (E\u0304K , E\u0304Na), and we define\n\u03bd(v, h) :=\n[ I\u0304 \u2212 ( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3\u221e(v)h\u2212 g\u0304L ( v \u2212 E\u0304L ) g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304K ) ] 14 and (33) \u03b7(v, n) := I\u0304 \u2212 g\u0304K ( v \u2212 E\u0304K ) n4 \u2212 g\u0304L ( v \u2212 E\u0304L\n)( v \u2212 E\u0304Na ) m3\u221e(v)\n(34)\nby solving (30) for n and h, respectively. (We note that (32) is consistent with the Na+ current being depolarising in the HH formalism, while the K+ current is hyperpolarising [13].) The manifold M2 can therefore be written globally either as a graph over (v, h), with\nn = \u03bd(v, h),\nor as a graph over (v, n), with\nh = \u03b7(v, n).\nFinally, a parametric expression for FM2 can be obtained from (33) or (34), by solving the system {(30),(31)}. Elementary calculation shows that FM2 is a U -shaped curve, which can be viewed as the tangential connection of two fold curves L\u2213; see Fig. 4. This tangential connection occurs at a point on FM2 where \u22022v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] = 0.\nIt follows that the manifold M2 is separated by FM2 into a normally attracting portion Sa, where \u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] < 0, and a normally repelling portion Sr, where \u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] > 0; cf. again Fig. 4. We denote the normally hyperbolic submanifold of M2 by S = Sa \u222a Sr.\nRemark 2. It is now also apparent that the restriction to v \u2208 ( E\u0304K , E\u0304Na ) mathematically stems from Equations (33) and (34), since the denominators in those expressions tend to zero when v \u2192 E\u0304Na or v \u2192 E\u0304K , respectively. It therefore follows that the planes { v = E\u0304K } and { v = E\u0304Na } are vertical asymptotes of M2. Strictly speaking, in order to be able to apply GSPT, we will in fact restrict our analysis to sufficiently large compact subsets of M2.\nRescaling time in the three-dimensional reduction in (27) as t = \u03b5\u03c3 gives the slow formulation\n\u03b5v\u0307 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h) \u2202h\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n) \u2202n\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) ,\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h),\nn\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n).\n(35)\n12\nThe reduced flow of (35) on M2 is obtained by setting \u03b5 = 0 in (35):\n0 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) ,\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h),\nn\u0307 = \u03b4nN(v, n);\n(36)\nthen, with regard to the reduced flow on Sa, we have the following result:\nProposition 1. The reduced flow of (35) on Sa is smoothly topologically equivalent to the flow of\nv\u0307 = \u03b4h\u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)H(v, h) + \u03b4n\u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)N(v, \u03bd(v, h)), h\u0307 = \u2212\u03b4h\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)H(v, h)\n(37)\nand to that of\nv\u0307 = \u03b4h\u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)H(v, \u03b7(v, n)) + \u03b4n\u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)N(v, n), n\u0307 = \u2212\u03b4n\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)N(v, n).\n(38)\nProof. Differentiating implicitly the algebraic constraint in (30) which defines M2, we obtain\n\u2212\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] v\u0307 = \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] h\u0307+ \u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] n\u0307.\nMaking use of the h- and n-equations of (25), together with (33), on M2 we obtain\n\u2212\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] v\u0307 = \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)H(v, h) + \u03b4n\u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)N(v, \u03bd(v, h)),\nh\u0307 = \u03b4hH(v, h).\nRescaling time in the above by a factor of \u2212 (\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)])\u22121, which preserves the direction of time on Sa, we find (37), as claimed. The equivalence to (38) can be shown in a similar fashion.\n13\nWe remark that, although (37) and (38) are equivalent on Sa, the regime where h is taken to be the slowest variable in (35) is naturally studied in the context of (37), which becomes a two-dimensional slow-fast system in the standard form of GSPT in that regime, as will become apparent in Section 3. Similarly, the n-slow regime is conveniently studied in (38); cf. Section 4. (By contrast, if n is taken to be the slow variable in (37), respectively if h is taken to be the slow variable in (38), then the corresponding two-dimensional system is a slow-fast system in the non-standard form of GSPT [29].)\nNaturally, and as is the case for (17) also, the slow-fast formulation in Equation (35) exhibits dynamics on two timescales when only \u03b5 is assumed to be small and \u03b4h, \u03b4n = O(1); correspondingly, there is then no separation of scales in the desingularised reduced flow on Sa in (37). In the following, we consider the two regimes where either \u03c4n = O(1) and \u03c4h is large in (5) and, hence, \u03b4h is small in (35); or \u03c4h = O(1) and \u03c4n is large and, hence, \u03b4n is small. The system in (35) then exhibits dynamics on three distinct timescales, with (37) corresponding to the formulation on the \u201cintermediate\u201d timescale. In the following, we will in turn investigate the resulting mixed-mode dynamics in those two regimes.\n3 The h-slow regime\nIn this section, we consider the regime where the variable h is the slowest variable in (20), which is realised for \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small and \u03b4n = 1, that is, when \u03c4h is large and \u03c4n = O(1) in the original HH model, Equation (2). In that regime, the three-dimensional reduction in (27) on M1\u03b3 is a slow-fast system in the standard form of GSPT which features similar geometric and dynamical properties to the extended prototypical example introduced in [16].\nIn particular, we will classify the mixed-mode dynamics of Equation (20) with \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4h > 0 small in terms of the (rescaled) applied current I\u0304, by applying the analysis outlined in [16] to the three-dimensional reduction in (27). We will show that, in the parameter regime defined in (7), there exist values 0 < I\u0304\u2212h < I\u0304 a h < I\u0304 r h < I\u0304 + h of I\u0304 that distinguish between the various types of oscillatory dynamics in (20) for \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4h positive and sufficiently small and \u03b4n = O(1). The resulting classification is illustrated in Fig. 5, with the corresponding mixed-mode oscillatory dynamics as shown in Fig. 1. While such dynamics was previously documented in [6], the underlying geometric mechanisms that generate these various firing patterns, and the transitions between them, were not emphasised in the context of GSPT. Correspondingly, the I\u0304-values for which these transitions occur were not identified.\nSpecifically, the values I\u0304\u2212h and I\u0304 + h distinguish between oscillatory dynamics and steady-state behaviour. The value I\u0304ah separates oscillatory trajectories with double epochs of slow dynamics from those with single epochs under the perturbed flow of (35), with \u03b5 and \u03b4h sufficiently small; see panels (a) and (b), as well as (d) and (e), of Fig. 1, respectively. We remark that complex mixed-mode patterns featuring double epochs of slow dynamics separated by LAOs are observed during the transition from double-epoch MMOs to those with single epochs, i.e., for I\u0304-values close to I\u0304ah ; see Fig. 1(c). Moreover, there exists an I\u0304-value I\u0304 r h which separates MMOs with single epochs of SAOs from relaxation oscillation; see panels (e) and (f) of Fig. 1, respectively.\n14"

Computations show that the points p\u2213h , when they exist, lie on S r. In terms of the desingularised flow in (39), the subsets H\u2213\u2229Sa\u2213 are characterised as stable, while the branches H\u2213\u2229Sr are characterised as unstable; see [16] for a detailed discussion in the context of a prototypical three-timescale system with similar geometric properties.\nIn the double singular limit of \u03b5 = 0 = \u03b4h, the folded singularities Qh = { q\u2212h , q + h } [25] of (25)\nare given by\nq\u2213h =Mh \u2229 L \u2213;\nsee Fig. 6. In the following, we will denote these singularities in coordinate form as q\u2213h = ( v \u2213 qh , h \u2213 qh , n \u2213 qh ) ;\nthe above coordinates are obtained by solving (29), (30), and (43).\nRemark 3. We emphasise that the properties of all geometric objects defined above \u2013 i.e., of Mh, FMh, and Qh \u2013 are dependent on the parameter I or, rather, on its rescaled counterpart I\u0304.\nRemark 4. We remark that consideration of the reduced flow of (35) on Sa in (38), instead of (37) with \u03b4h > 0 small, gives a slow-fast system in the non-standard form of GSPT; cf. Fig. 7 and see [14, 29] for details.\nNext, setting \u03b4h = 0 in the slow formulation, Equation (40), we obtain the one-dimensional flow on Mh:\n0 = \u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)N(v, \u03bd(v, h)), h\u0307 = \u2212\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |n=\u03bd(v,h)H(v, h).\n(46)\n16\nDifferentiating the algebraic constraint in (43) implicitly, via\n\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n\u221e(v)] v\u0307 = \u2212\u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n\u221e(v)] h\u0307,\nand using the h-equation of (46) and (34), we find the following expression for the flow on H\u2213:\nv\u0307 = \u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n\u221e(v))]\n\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n\u221e(v)]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 {h=\u03b7(v,n\u221e(v)),n=n\u221e(v)} H(v, \u03b7(v, n\u221e(v))).\n(47)\n17\nWhen a true equilibrium exists in Sr, the one-dimensional flow on H\u2213 is directed towards q\u2213h , respectively; cf. Fig. 6 and Fig. 8. The resulting singular geometry is summarised in Fig. 6. Combining orbit segments from the layer flow of Equation (28)\u03b5=0, the intermediate fibres of (41) onM2, and the one-dimensional dynamics of (47) onMh, one can construct singular or candidate trajectories; closed singular trajectories are called singular cycles.\nWe emphasise that, according to the above, the three-dimensional reduction in (27), with h the slow variable, has the following properties, in analogy to those of the (three-timescale) extended prototypical example introduced in [16] when no stable equilibrium of (36) exists on Sa, namely:\nP1. The critical manifold M2 is S-shaped away from the tangential connection of L\u2213, with two attracting sheets Sa\u2213 separated by a repelling sheet Sr.\nP2. The manifold Mh is S-shaped, with two attracting branches H\u2213 separated by a repelling branch Hr; moreover, the fold points of Mh lie on the repelling sheet Sr.\nP3. The one-dimensional flow on (47) H\u2213 is directed towards q\u2213h , respectively.\nCorrespondingly, we will conclude that the global mixed-mode dynamics of the three-timescale HH model, Equation (20), is fundamentally not very different to that of the three-timescale prototypical system studied in [16]; in the following, we will show how the various, qualitatively different firing patterns illustrated in Fig. 1 can be explained by the mechanisms described therein, resulting in the I\u0304-dependent classification of Fig. 5."

However, the configuration of the singular cycle illustrated therein is\n19\nnot the only possible one. Namely, depending on the location of the folded singularities q\u2213h relative to one another, singular cycles can pass through only one or through both of them, as shown in Fig. 9; by Remark 3, the corresponding geometry depends on the parameter I\u0304. We characterise the pair of folded singularities q\u2213h based on whether they are \u201cconnected\u201d by singular cycles or not, by slightly rephrasing the corresponding definition in [16], as follows.\nDefinition 1 ([16]). white text\n1. The folded singularities q\u2213h are \u201corbitally connected\u201d if they are contained in the same singular cycle, with the latter containing two slow segments, one on H\u2212 and one on H+, i.e., if h\u2212qh > h + qh ; cf.

Fig. 9(b).\nDue to the I\u0304-dependence of the location of q\u2213h , the classification in Definition 1 hence encodes the position of the folded singularities q\u2213h relative to one another in terms of the rescaled applied current I\u0304. It follows that, in the parameter regime given by (7), there exists a unique value I\u0304ah such that the singularities q\u2212h and q + h are orbitally aligned. Numerically, that value is approximately found to equal\nI\u0304ah ' 26.49\nkvgNa ;\nrecall (7).

By Theorem 1, there exists \u03b30 sufficiently small such that, for \u03b3 \u2208 (0, \u03b30), the dynamics of (20) near its attracting slow manifold M1\u03b3 is captured by the dynamics of the three-dimensional reduction in (27).

(Qualitatively, the statement follows from the fact that trajectories of (27) are attracted to the vicinity of both H\u2213 for \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, and that they therefore feature double epochs of slow dynamics; cf. Fig. 6 and panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1.)\nProposition 2 states that for every fixed I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304\u2212h , I\u0304 a h), there exist \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small such that the three-dimensional reduction in (27) \u2013 and, by extension, Equation (20) \u2013 exhibits MMOs with double epochs of slow dynamics.

By extension, for \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, the mixed-mode dynamics of the full fourdimensional system in (20) is characterised by double epochs of slow dynamics for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304\u2212q + O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h), I\u0304ah +O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h)); cf. panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1 and Fig. 10.\nBy numerical sweeping, we find that for \u03b3 = 0.083, \u03b5 = 0.1, and \u03b4h = 0.025, with the values of the remaining parameters as in (7), (20) features MMOs with double epochs of slow dynamics without LAOs between them, as illustrated in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1, until approximately I\u0304 ' 23.09/(kvgNa), which is close to I\u0304ah ."

In particular, during the transition from oscillation with double epochs of slow dynamics to single-epoch MMOs, i.e., for I\u0304-values close to the value I\u0304ah for which the folded singularities q \u2213 h are orbitally aligned, Equation (27) exhibits \u201cexotic\u201d mixed-mode dynamics upon variation of I\u0304 in which SAO epochs \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d are separated by LAOs, as illustrated in Fig. 1(c). We refer to those MMO trajectories as \u201ctransitional\u201d.\nCorrespondingly, in Fig. 10(c), a trajectory that leaves the vicinity of L+, jumping without having interacted with H+ on Sa+ , experiences delayed loss of stability along H\u2212 on Sa\u2212 before connecting to a segment which is attracted to H+ on Sa+ . After jumping from the vicinity of L+, the trajectory does not interact with H\u2212 on Sa\u2212 ; a jump occurs at L\u2212, and the cycle starts anew. As the exit points of trajectories from vicinities of H\u2213 vary with the corresponding entry points, cf. Appendix A, trajectories may or may not reach H\u2213 after jumping from L\u00b1 when the distance between the folded singularities q\u2213h in the h-direction is comparable to the displacement in the h-direction near Sa\u2213 in (35). We quantify that displacement more precisely in the following subsection, referring the reader to [16] for details.\nWe remark that the above is not surprising, as it is explicitly stated in [16] that for a fixed \u201cremote\u201d geometry in the three-dimensional reduction in (27), one can find \u03b5 and \u03b4h sufficiently small such that MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics occur.

We define the displacement function as\n\u2206h(h, I\u0304) = G\u2212h (h, I\u0304) + G + h (h, I\u0304).\nWhile the integrals in (50) cannot be solved analytically, calculations using computer algebra software show that\n\u2206h(h \u2212 qh , I\u0304)  < 0 if I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah , I\u0304rh), = 0 if I\u0304 = I\u0304rh,\n> 0 if I\u0304 > I\u0304rh,\n(51)\nwhere we numerically obtain\nI\u0304rh ' 29.705\nkvgNa .\nWe then have the following result for the \u201cfull\u201d, four-dimensional system in (20).\nProposition 3. Fix I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah , I\u0304rh) and let \u03b4n = 1. Then, there exist \u03b30, \u03b50, and \u03b40 positive and sufficiently small such that the HH equations in (20) feature MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics \u201cbelow\u201d for all (\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h) \u2208 (0, \u03b30)\u00d7 (0, \u03b50)\u00d7 (0, \u03b40).\nProof. By Theorem 1, there exists \u03b30 sufficiently small such that, for \u03b3 \u2208 (0, \u03b30), the dynamics of (20) near its attracting slow manifold M1\u03b3 is captured by the dynamics of (27). Moreover, if I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah , I\u0304rh) \u2013 i.e., if \u2206h(h\u2212q , I\u0304) < 0, by (51) \u2013 then trajectories of (27) with \u03b5 = 0 and \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small that leave L\u2212 at q\u2212h will return at a point on S\na\u2212 from which they will be attracted close to H\u2212, i.e., in the funnel of q\u2212h . As is well known [28, 1, 17, 21, 16], in that case SAOs occur in the vicinity of q\u2212h in (27) for \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 small. The above implies that, for fixed I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304 a h , I\u0304 r h), there exist \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small such that Equation (27) features MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics [16, Theorem 3].\nProposition 3 states that for every fixed I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah , I\u0304rh), there exist \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small such that the three-dimensional reduction in (27) \u2013 and, by extension, Equation (20) \u2013 exhibits MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics. Conversely, for fixed \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 small, the threedimensional system in (27) exhibits MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah + O(\u03b5, \u03b4h), I\u0304rh +O(\u03b4h, \u03b4h\u03b5 ln \u03b5)); see [26, 16] for details. It then follows that the full four-dimensional system in (20) exhibits single-epoch MMOs for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304ah + O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h), I\u0304rh + O(\u03b3, \u03b4h, \u03b4h\u03b5 ln \u03b5)). By numerical sweeping, we find that for \u03b3 = 0.083, \u03b5 = 0.1, and \u03b4h = 0.025, with the remaining parameters defined as in (7), Equation (20) features MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics until approximately I\u0304 ' 26.127/(kvgNa), which is consistent with the above error estimates.\nWe now proceed by showing the transition from mixed-mode dynamics to relaxation oscillation. To establish existence of the latter, we need to show that the assumptions of [26, Theorem 4] are satisfied; in the context of the HH equations, these assumptions are summarised in [23, Section 3.1] for the two-timescale case \u2013 we reiterate that the three-timescale case which we study here is not\n24\nconsidered therein. For a prototypical three-timescale system, the corresponding assumptions are outlined in [16, Theorem 2]. To that end, we rewrite (49) as\nh\u0302(h, I\u0304)\u2212 h = \u03b4h\u03a8(h, I\u0304, \u03b4h),\nwhere we define\n\u03a8(h, I\u0304, \u03b4h) = \u2206h(h, I\u0304) +O(\u03b4h);\nrecall (49). In particular, we then have that\n\u03a8(h\u2212qh , I\u0304, 0) = 0 = \u2206(h \u2212 qh , I\u0304), (52)\nby (51). Moreover, we use computer algebra software to evaluate the partial derivatives of \u03a8(h, I\u0304, \u03b4h) with respect to h and I\u0304: numerically, we calculate that\n\u2202\u03a8 \u2202h (h\u2212qh , I\u0304 r h, 0) ' \u221215.0377 < 0 (53)\nand\n\u2202\u03a8 \u2202I\u0304 (h\u2212qh , I\u0304 r h, 0) ' \u2212278.4470 < 0. (54)\nProposition 4. There exists I\u0304\u2217h > I\u0304 r h such that, for I\u0304 \u2208 (Irh, I\u0304\u2217h) and \u03b4n = 1, there exist \u03b30, \u03b50, and \u03b40 positive and sufficiently small such that the HH equations in (20) feature relaxation oscillation for all (\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h) \u2208 (0, \u03b30)\u00d7 (0, \u03b50)\u00d7 (0, \u03b40).\nProof. By Theorem 1, there exists \u03b30 > 0 sufficiently small such that, for \u03b3 \u2208 (0, \u03b30), the dynamics of (20) near its attracting slow manifoldM1\u03b3 is captured by the dynamics of (27). The existence of stable relaxation oscillation in (27) is established by showing that a set of assumptions introduced in [26, 23] is satisfied, similarly to the proof of [16, Theorem 2].\nSpecifically, the first set of assumptions states that M2 is S-shaped with two fold curves L\u2213, and that the reduced flow of (39) onM2 is transverse to both L\u2213 and P (L\u00b1). These assumptions are satisfied for Equation (27) away from q\u2213h and from the tangential connection of L\n\u2213, as was also shown in [23].\nThe other set of assumptions states that, in the singular limit of \u03b5 = 0 with \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, there exists a hyperbolic and stable singular cycle. To that end, one shows that in this limit there exists a one-dimensional map\n\u03c0\u2212 : L\u2212|h\u2208(h\u2212qh ,h+qh )\u2192 L \u2212|h\u2208(h\u2212qh ,h+qh ), h 7\u2192 h\u0302,\nwhich has a hyperbolic and stable fixed point. Here, the map \u03c0\u2212 is given by (49). From the implicit function theorem, it follows that there exist I\u0304\u2217h > I\u0304 r h and a function h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h), with h\u0303(I\u0304 r h, 0) = h \u2212 qh , such that \u03a8(h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h), I\u0304, \u03b4h) = 0, i.e., the map \u03c0 \u2212 has a fixed point for \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small and I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304rh, I\u0304\u2217h). The h-coordinate of this fixed point on L\u2212 is given by h = h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h); from (53) and (54), it follows that, for fixed \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h) is a decreasing function of I\u0304. Specifically, we find that \u2202h\u0303 \u2202I\u0304 (I\u0304rh, \u03b4h) ' \u2212 278.447 15.0377 , by (53) and (54). On the other hand, we calculate that \u2202h\u2212qh \u2202I\u0304 (v\u2212qh , I\u0304 r h) = \u2212279.416 < \u2202h\u0303 \u2202I\u0304 (I\u0304rh, \u03b4h) for the h-coordinate h \u2212 qh = \u03b7(v\u2212qh , n\u221e(v \u2212 qh )) of the folded singularity q\u2212h in a first approximation. It follows that h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h) > h \u2212 qh for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304rh, I\u0304\u2217h), i.e., that\n25\nthe trajectory of (27) corresponding to the fixed point of \u03c0\u2212 reaches the vicinity of L\u2212 outside the funnel of h\u2212qh ; see again Fig. 11 for an illustration of the underlying geometry.\nFinally, from (49), we have that\n\u2202h\u0302 \u2202h (h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h), I\u0304) = 1 + \u03b4h \u2202\u03a8 \u2202h (h\u0303(I\u0304 , \u03b4h), I\u0304, \u03b4h) \u2208 (0, 1)\nfor all \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small; therefore, the fixed point is attracting. It follows that, for \u03b5 = 0 and \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, (27) admits a stable singular cycle \u0393h, while for \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, the system in (27) exhibits stable relaxation oscillation [26, 23, 16].\nProposition 4 states that there exists I\u0304\u2217h > I\u0304 r h such that, if I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304rh, I\u0304\u2217h), then there exist \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small such that the three-dimensional reduction in (27) \u2013 and, by extension, Equation (20) \u2013 exhibits MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics. Conversely, for fixed \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 small, the three-dimensional system in (27) admits relaxation oscillation for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304rh+O(\u03b5, \u03b4h), I\u0304\u2217h+ O(\u03b5, \u03b4h)); see [17, 16] for details. It then follows that the full four-dimensional system in (20) exhibits relaxation oscillation for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304rh +O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h), I\u0304\u2217h +O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4h)).\nNumerically, we observe that the transition from relaxation oscillation to steady state, i.e., the cessation of oscillatory dynamics when I\u0304 is close to I\u0304+h \u2013 recall Equation (48) and the discussion that follows it \u2013 happens via stable small-amplitude oscillations that are a product of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation near I\u0304+h . We also remark that, in [6], chaotic MMOs were documented during the transition from MMOs with single SAO epochs to relaxation; cf. Fig. 1(e). The study of the underlying mechanisms in the three-timescale regime considered here is included in plans for future work.\nRemark 6. We note that the numerical values in (53) and (54) may seem large. However, we emphasise that the applied current I\u0304 is itself a very small quantity due to the scaling in (4) [23] which has been widely used in the study of the HH model, Equation (2). Therefore, the resulting variation in I\u0304 is also small, in relation, for instance, to (54). An investigation of potential alternative scalings of h and I\u0304 which might yield more moderate values for the quantities corresponding to (53) and (54) is left for future work.\n4 The n-slow regime\nIn this section, we consider the regime where the variable n is the slowest variable in (20), which is realised for \u03b4n > 0 sufficiently small and \u03b4h = 1, that is, when \u03c4n is large and \u03c4h = O(1) in the original HH model, Equation (2). In that regime, the three-dimensional reduction in (27) onM2 is a slow-fast system in the standard form of GSPT. As the analysis of this regime is fundamentally similar to that of the h-slow regime presented in Section 3, our exposition here is deliberately more condensed.\nAs was done in Section 3, we will again classify the mixed-mode dynamics of Equation (20) with \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4n > 0 small in terms of I\u0304, by applying results of [16] to the three-dimensional reduction in (27). We will show that, in the parameter regime defined in (7), there exist values 0 < I\u0304\u2212n < I\u0304 a n < I\u0304 + n of I\u0304 that distinguish between the various types of oscillatory dynamics in (20) for \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4n positive and sufficiently small and \u03b4h = O(1). The resulting classification is illustrated in Fig. 13, with the corresponding mixed-mode oscillatory dynamics as shown in Fig. 12. The geometric configuration in phase space for n slow is analogous to the one illustrated in Fig. 3 for the h-slow case.\n26\nThe values I\u0304\u2212n and I\u0304 + n again distinguish between oscillatory dynamics and steady-state behaviour. The value I\u0304an separates MMO trajectories with double epochs of slow dynamics from those with single epochs under the perturbed flow of the three-dimensional reduction in (27), with \u03b5 and \u03b4n sufficiently small; see panel (a), as well as panels (d) and (e), of Fig. 12, respectively."

In terms of the desingularised flow in (55), the subsets N\u2213 \u2229 Sa\u2213 are characterised as stable, while the branches N\u2213 \u2229 Sr are characterised as unstable; see [16] for details.\nIn the double singular limit of \u03b5 = 0 = \u03b4n, the folded singularities Qn = {q\u2212n , q+n } [25] of (25) are given by\nq\u2213n =Mn \u2229 L\u2213;\nsee again Fig. 14.

As in Section 3, the geometries of Mn, FMn , and Qn depend on the rescaled applied current I\u0304.\nNext, setting \u03b4n = 0 in the slow formulation, Equation (56), we obtain the one-dimensional flow on Mn:\n0 = \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)H(v, \u03b7(v, n)), n\u0307 = \u2212\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)N(v, n).\n(61)\n29\nDifferentiating the algebraic constraint in (59) implicitly, via\n\u2212\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h\u221e(v), n] v\u0307 = \u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h\u221e(v), n] n\u0307,\nand using the h-equation of (61) and (33), we find the following expression for the one-dimensional flow on N\u2213:\nv\u0307 = \u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] \u2202n [V (v,m\u221e(v), h\u221e(v), n)]\n\u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h\u221e(v), n]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 {h=h\u221e(v),n=\u03bd(v,h\u221e(v))} N(v, \u03bd(v, h\u221e(v))).\n(62)\nUsing computer algebra software, we can confirm that, when a true equilibrium exists in Sr, the one-dimensional flow on N\u2213 is directed towards q\u2213n , respectively; cf.

Combining orbit segments from the layer flow of Equation (28), the intermediate fibres of (57) onM2, and the one-dimensional dynamics of (62) on Mn, one can again construct singular cycles as in Section 3.\nWe emphasise that, according to the above, Equation (25), with n the slow variable, satisfies assumptions that are analogous to P1 through P3 in Section 3.\nRemark 7. We remark that considering the reduced flow of (35) on Sa in (37), instead of (38) with \u03b4n > 0 small, gives a slow-fast system in the non-standard form of GSPT, in analogy to the h-slow regime described in Remark 4."

The proof is analogous to the proof of Proposition 2 in Section 3.\nProposition 5 states that for every fixed I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304\u2212n , I\u0304an), there exist \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n > 0 sufficiently small such that the three-dimensional reduction in (27) \u2013 and, by extension, Equation (20) \u2013 exhibits MMOs with double epochs of slow dynamics. Conversely, for fixed \u03b5, \u03b4n > 0 sufficiently small, (27) admits MMOs with double epochs of slow dynamics for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304\u2212n + O(\u03b5, \u03b4n), I\u0304an + O(\u03b5, \u03b4m)); by extension, for \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03b4n > 0 sufficiently small, the mixed-mode dynamics of the full fourdimensional system in (20) is characterised by double epochs of slow dynamics for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304\u2212n + O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n), I\u0304an +O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n)); cf. panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 12 and Fig. 17. By numerical sweeping, we find that for \u03b3 = 0.083, \u03b5 = 0.1, and \u03b4n = 0.01, with the values of the remaining parameters as in (7), (20) features double-epoch MMOs until approximately I\u0304 ' 9.4/(kvgNa), which is consistent with the above error estimates.\n32\nIn contrast to the h-slow regime, we do not find an I\u0304-value for which MMOs with single epochs of slow dynamics turn into two-timescale relaxation oscillation. To that end, we consider Equation (55) with \u03b4n > 0 small. Eliminating time, away from N we can then approximate the flow on Sa \u2213 by\ndn dv = \u2212\u03b4n \u2202v [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)N(v, n) \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] |h=\u03b7(v,n)H(v, \u03b7(v, n)) , (64)\nwhere we have omitted O (\u03b4n)-terms in the denominator; recall that \u2202h [V (v,m\u221e(v), h, n)] < 0, by (32).\nWe recall that we denote by P (L\u2213) \u2208 Sa\u00b1 the projection of L\u2212 onto Sa\u00b1 along the fast fibres of (28), and we now define the points\n(vmin, hmin, n \u2212 qn) := P (L +) \u2229 { h = n\u2212qn } and (vmax, hmax, n \u2212 qn) := P (L \u2212) \u2229 { n = n\u2212qh } ,\nas illustrated in Fig. 11 for the h-slow regime.

Equation (65) encodes the displacement in the n-direction after a large excursion, i.e., after the trajectory has been attracted to Sa+ and then again repelled away therefrom in the vicinity of L+ before its return to Sa\u2212 near L\u2212; see [17, 16] for details. We define the displacement function as\n\u2206n(n, I\u0304) = G\u2212n (n, I\u0304) + G+n (n, I\u0304);\nthen, direct calculation shows that\n\u2206n(n \u2212 q , I\u0304) > 0 for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304an, I\u0304+n ),\nwhich implies that trajectories are attracted to N for I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304an, I\u0304+n ). We conclude that no twotimescale relaxation oscillation occurs in (27) for n slow; rather, for \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n > 0 sufficiently small, (20) features trajectories with single epochs of slow dynamics when I\u0304 \u2208 (I\u0304an + O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n), I\u0304+n + O(\u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b4n)), as is also evidenced numerically in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 17, where trajectories seem to be attracted to N\u2212 \u2013 or to the unique branch N if I\u0304 > I\u0304pn.\nWe remark that, for the I-values considered in [6], the equilibrium of (55) as depicted in Fig. 15 lies on N r, which is why in [6] the n-slow regime is found to be fundamentally different to the hslow one; moreover, it is postulated there that chaotic dynamics can be realised only in the h-slow regime. Here, we show that, for sufficiently large I\u0304-values, that equilibrium point lies on the unique branch N in Sr, recall (60) and (63). Motivated also by the time series in Fig. 12(b), we remark that it would be worth investigating whether chaotic dynamics can be realised in the corresponding I\u0304-regime. The search for such dynamics and the potential study of the corresponding generating mechanisms is included in plans for future work."

            "text": "In this work, we have proposed a novel and global three-dimensional reduction of the four-timescale Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations in (2) [6, 11] that is based on a scaled system, Equation (5), first proposed in [23]; cf. Theorem 1. Specifically, we have reduced (5) to a globally normally hyperbolic \u2013 and, in fact, normally attracting \u2013 slow manifold, instead of to a local centre manifold, as was done in [23, 24], and we have shown that the two reductions feature the same critical manifold M2. We have then concluded that, depending on the values of the parameters in the system relative to each other, our reduction is itself a three-timescale singular perturbation problem. We emphasise that this three-timescale structure is also apparent in the three-dimensional reduction of Equation (17) obtained in [23, 24] if either \u03b4h > 0 is assumed to be sufficiently small and \u03b4n = O(1), or if \u03b4n > 0 is sufficiently small and \u03b4h = O(1); however, those regimes were not considered in [23, 24].\nThe timescale separation achieved in our three-dimensional reduction, Equation (25), allows for a further iterative dimension reduction to a hierarchy of invariant manifolds via the systematic study of the associated layer problems and reduced flows. By decomposing the global dynamics of (25) into segments that evolve on different timescales, we are able to classify the resulting mixedmode dynamics \u2013 as well as the dynamics of the \u201cfull\u201d (transformed) HH model, Equation (20).\n34\nIn particular, we can explain transitions between oscillatory trajectories with different qualitative properties, in accordance with the geometric mechanisms proposed in [16].\nSpecifically, for the regimes where either h or n is taken to be the slowest variable in (20), we have classified the different firing patterns which are correspondingly illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 12, and we have described the transitions between them, in the framework of multiple-timescale GSPT; cf. Fig. 10 and Fig. 17, respectively. (We reiterate that these patterns had previously been documented in [6].) In both regimes, we have characterised mixed-mode dynamics with either double or single epochs of slow dynamics upon variation of the rescaled applied current I\u0304. For the parameter values considered here, we have observed (two-timescale) relaxation oscillation and \u201cexotic\u201d MMO trajectories for h slow only. We reiterate that the methodology presented here extends to a wide variety of multiple-scale models from mathematical physiology that can be expressed in an HH-type formalism [2, 5, 8, 12, 20, 22, 27]. In such models, the physiological properties of the particular system under consideration determine whether small parameters \u2013 and, hence, a separation of timescales \u2013 are present in the resulting, singularly perturbed system of differential equations.\nThe local mechanisms which generate small-amplitude (\u201csub-threshold\u201d) oscillations in (25) can also be analysed via the approach that is documented in [16] in our three-timescale context; cf. Appendix A for details. We remark that it would seem natural to attempt a normal form transformation in order to make the singular geometry of (27) independent of the external applied current I\u0304. However, we have found that such a transformation would encode transitions between MMO trajectories with different qualitative properties in the reduced flow on S, resulting in a slow-fast system in the non-standard form of GSPT [29]. Moreover, we have adopted the widely accepted scaling in (4) [23] throughout; an investigation of alternative scalings is left for future work; recall, in particular, the proof of Proposition 4 and Remark 6.\nFinally, in [6] it was demonstrated numerically that Equation (2) features chaotic dynamics in the h-slow regime; however, the underlying chaos-generating mechanisms were not explained. Moreover, no chaotic trajectories were found in the n-slow regime, and it was postulated that this difference is due to the fact that the unique equilibrium point of the system lies on H\u2212 \u2229 Sr (in our notation) for h slow, while in the n-slow regime it is located on N r for the values of I considered by them; cf. Fig. 8 and Fig. 15, respectively. Here, we have shown that by considering larger values of I, that equilibrium can equally be made to lie on the unique branch N in Sr in the n-slow regime; cf. Fig. 15(c) and recall (60) and (63). Hence, motivated by the time series in panel (c) of Fig. 12, where slow segments with and without SAOs alternate \u201cbelow\u201d, we suggest that it would be worth investigating whether chaotic dynamics is equally possible in that regime, since our analysis shows that, ultimately, the two regimes are not fundamentally different, as claimed in [6] \u2013 an observation which has also been made by Rubin and Wechselberger [23, 24]. A more systematic analysis of the mechanisms that are responsible for chaotic behaviour in (2), and the potential relation thereof to Shilnikov-type homoclinic phenomena or to period-doubling bifurcations of small-amplitude periodic orbits within the framework of three-timescale GSPT, for both h slow and n slow, is left for future work."

            "text": "The local mechanisms underlying the slow dynamics of the three-dimensional reduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model in (27) are similar to the ones described in [16] for the extended prototypical model introduced there, and are only discussed in brief here.\nWe reiterate the fast formulation in (27) for convenience,\nv\u2032 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h) \u2202h\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n) \u2202n\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) ,\n=: U(v, h, n; \u03b5, \u03b4h, \u03b4n)\nh\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4hH(v, h), n\u2032 = \u03b5\u03b4nN(v, n),\n(66)\nand we consider the regime where h is slow, with \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small and \u03b4n = O(1). In the singular limit of \u03b4h = 0 with \u03b5 > 0 and \u03b4n = 1, we obtain the system\nv\u2032 = m\u221e(v)\u2212 \u00b5(v, h, n) tm(v)\u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2212 \u03b5N(v, n)\u2202n\u00b5(v, h, n) \u2202v\u00b5(v, h, n) = U(v, h, n; \u03b5, 0, 1), h\u2032 = 0, n\u2032 = \u03b5N(v, n),\n(67)\nthe equilibria of which are located on Mh. Linearisation of (67) about Mh gives the Jacobian matrix\nAh =\n( \u2202vU(v, h, n; \u03b5, 0, 1) \u2202nU(v, h, n; \u03b5, 0, 1)\n\u03b5\u2202vN(v, n) \u03b5\u2202nN(v, n)\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Mh ; (68)\nthe eigenvalues of Ah determine the regimes where Mh is either focally or nodally attracting, respectively repelling, under the two-dimensional flow of (67). In particular, there exists a point on Mh at which (67) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation; whether this Hopf bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical depends on the value of I\u0304.\nIn the fully perturbed system, Equation (66), with \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small, trajectories entering the focally attracting regime on Mh give rise to bifurcation delay-type SAOs, while attraction to the nodally attracting regime implies the absence of SAOs \u2013 or the presence of only a few thereof that occur close to the jump point; cf. panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 1, respectively. In both cases, trajectories jump away from Mh not immediately after entering the repelling region thereon but, rather, after an O(1) delay. The corresponding jump-off point can \u2013 under the assumption of analyticity \u2013 be calculated via a way-in/way-out function, as is discussed in more detail in [9, 16, 19, 21]; cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 10. We note that this delay-type mechanism is a residual of the 2-fast/1-slow nature of Equation (66), as well as that a degenerate node where the stability of Mh turns from focal to nodal attraction lies O( \u221a \u03b5)-close to the Hopf bifurcation point of (67) on Mh.\nFinally, the small periodic orbits that emerge at the Hopf bifurcation in (67) cease to exist at a transverse intersection between Sa\u03b5\u03b4h and S r \u03b5\u03b4h\nthat occurs O(\u03b5)-close to the Hopf bifurcation point. These periodic trajectories of the partially perturbed system in (67) with \u03b5, \u03b4h > 0 sufficiently small are associated with secondary canards [28] and sector of rotations [17]; therefore, if trajectories of the fully perturbed system are attracted to the corresponding region onMh, canard-induced SAOs arise; see [17, 3, 4] for details. These are a residual of the 1-fast/2-slow nature of Equation (66).\nA detailed quantitative analysis of the above classification is beyond the scope of this work. However, we emphasise that, although the reduction in (17) proposed by Rubin and Wechselberger\n36\n[23] and (66) admit the same critical manifolds M2 and Mh, there are quantitative differences in terms of the regions where the stability of Mh changes; these are reflected in the \u03b5-dependence of the first row in Ah in (68), whereas that row would be independent of \u03b5 if one considered (17) instead.\nFinally, we remark that the analysis of the n-slow regime is analogous, with a corresponding Jacobian matrix\nAn =\n( \u2202vU(v, h, n; \u03b5, 1, 0) \u2202hU(v, h, n; \u03b5, 1, 0)\n\u03b5\u2202vH(v, h) \u03b5\u2202hH(v, h)\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Mn\nabout Mn, and where the function U(v, h, n; \u03b5, 1, 0) contains \u03b5H(v, h)-dependent terms instead of \u03b5N(v, n)-dependent ones."
