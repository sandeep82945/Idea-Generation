1. **Lower bounds for average case query complexity in the statistical query model for other distribution classes.** The authors of the paper focus on the class of output distributions of random quantum circuits. It would be interesting to investigate whether similar techniques can be used to obtain lower bounds for other distribution classes, such as the class of output distributions of classical probabilistic circuits or the class of output distributions of quantum circuits with a different architecture.
2. **Extension of the results to the randomized average case query complexity.** The authors of the paper focus on the deterministic average case query complexity. It would be interesting to investigate whether the results can be extended to the randomized average case query complexity, where the learner is allowed to use randomness.
3. **Applications of the results to cryptography.** The authors of the paper mention that their results have implications for quantum cryptography. It would be interesting to investigate these implications in more detail and to explore other potential applications of the results to cryptography.
4. **Development of new heuristic algorithms for distribution learning.** The authors of the paper show that learning the output distributions of random quantum circuits is hard in the statistical query model. It would be interesting to investigate whether this hardness result can be used to develop new heuristic algorithms for distribution learning that are more efficient than existing algorithms.
5. **Characterization of the average case complexity of learning quantum circuit output distributions for different circuit depths.** The authors of the paper provide bounds on the average case query complexity of learning quantum circuit output distributions for different circuit depths. It would be interesting to further characterize the average case complexity of learning quantum circuit output distributions for different circuit depths, and to investigate whether there are sharp thresholds at which the complexity changes.
