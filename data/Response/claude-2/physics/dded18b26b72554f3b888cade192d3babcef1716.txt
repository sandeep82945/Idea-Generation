 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different metal oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3) on the sensitivity and selectivity of PANI-based electrochemical pH sensors. The synergistic effect could be different with other oxides.

2. Optimize the composition ratio of PANI to metal oxide in the nanocomposites to achieve maximum sensitivity and linearity. Test different weight ratios to find the ideal balance.

3. Explore different methods of synthesizing and depositing the PANI-metal oxide nanocomposites, such as in-situ polymerization, layer-by-layer assembly, etc. The structure could impact sensor performance. 

4. Evaluate the nanocomposites for detecting other analytes beyond pH, such as heavy metals, biomarkers, etc. The sensitivity may translate to other target analytes.

5. Develop flexible or wearable electrochemical sensors using the PANI-metal oxide nanocomposites. Translating to flexible substrates could enable new applications.
