All participants provided electronic informed consent. Intern Health Study recruitment procedures and study design are detailed in a prior publication.5 Preinternship (June) and internship (September or December) depressive symptoms and impairment item data were obtained from the 2007to 2018 cohorts. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a validated self-report of depression symptoms corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) symptoms of clinical depression. Respondents reported symptom frequency over the previous 2 weeks (0 = never to 3 = nearly every day) for a total score of 0 to 27. Depression scores are categorized as minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderate to severe (15-19), and severe ( 20). A single item corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5) clinically significant impairment criterion for major depression asked respondents to report the difficulty of performing social, occupational, and other important activities owing to these symptoms (0 = \u201chave not experienced any depressive symptoms or no difficulty at all,\u201d 1 = \u201csomewhat difficult,\u201d 2 = \u201cvery difficult,\u201d and 3 = \u201cextremely difficult\u201d).6 Race and ethnicity were self-reported in the questionnaire; available categories were Arab or Middle Eastern (added in 2016), Asian (eg, Indian or Chinese), Black or African American, Latino or Hispanic, multiracial, Native American, Pacific Islander, White, and other. Multiracial was used when respondents chose more than 1 race or ethnicity. Other races and ethnicities were those hand-entered by respondents. This information was assessed to investigate racial and ethnic disparities in training physician mental health.\nTo characterize associations among PHQ-9 scores, perceived impairment, and internship, we compared mean PHQ-9 scores within impairment categories before vs during internship via t tests and descriptive statistics conducted in R statistical software version 3.5.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We included assessments from interns with preinternship and 1 follow-up assessment\nAuthor affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.\nOpen Access.

All median (IQR) during-internship measurements within each category were also significantly increased compared with preinternship measurements (no symptoms or no difficulty: 1.0 [0.0-3.0] vs 3.0 [2.0-6.0]; P < .001; somewhat difficult: 6.0 [3.0-9.0] vs 9.0 [6.0-12.0]; P < .001; very difficult: 9.5 [5.0-13.4] vs 14.0 [11.0-17.0]; P < .001; extremely difficult: 5.5 [1.0-15.0] vs 17.0 [14.0-20.8]; P < .001) (Figure). The median (IQR) for depressive symptom scores reported as very or extremely difficult prior to internship was similar to the median (IQR) for scores reported as somewhat difficult during internship (9.0 [3.0-14.0] vs 9.0 [6.0-12.0])."

            "text": "This cohort study of more than 15 000 interns found that the mean severity of depressive symptoms that interns viewed as functionally impairing during internship year was increased compared with preinternship. This may be associated with a rising bar, in which symptom severity previously described as very impairing is normalized after entering internship as being somewhat impairing. This potentially suggests a shift in interns' ability to recognize the impact of depressive symptoms2 in the context of medical training. Limitations of this study include response biases (eg, fear of reporting any impairment) and nonrandom attrition that may limit generalizability.\nFailure to perceive impairment carries implications for interns (eg, lack of help-seeking), training programs (eg, potential attrition of interns), and patient care (eg, disengagement and medical errors). Future research should investigate whether these discrepancies are associated with interns\u2019 ability to effectively cope or with failure to recognize impairment owing to symptom normalization; associations between impairment and help-seeking, including requests for disability accommodation; and whether personalized feedback on depressive symptoms and potential impairment is associated with recalibration of misperceptions. Recognizing impairment may be associated with decreased adverse outcomes, including medical errors3 and attempted suicide among interns.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: November 28, 2021.\nPublished: January 25, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44919\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Meeks LM et al.
