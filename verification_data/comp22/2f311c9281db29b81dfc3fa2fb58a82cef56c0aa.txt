"In this paper, we present a light-weight deep convolutional neural network for low-cost IMU calibration which is called Calib-Net. A mathematical calibration model is introduced to design the training and calibration framework. Dilation convolution is adopted for spatio-temporal feature extraction of IMU measurements. Driven by a carefully designed loss function, the Calib-Net can be optimized to output the compensation for raw gyroscope measurements. Corresponding experimental evaluations are performed to prove the effectiveness of our proposed Calib-Net. The results show that our framework achieves quite good calibration performance and the orientation estimation performance of our Calib-Net can even compete with state-of-the-art VIO methods."
