 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a larger randomized controlled trial comparing the Monday-enhanced CEASE program to the standard CEASE program to further evaluate the efficacy of the QSQM approach on smoking cessation outcomes. A larger sample size would provide more statistical power. 

2. Test the QSQM approach in other health behavior change interventions beyond smoking cessation, such as weight loss, exercise, or medication adherence programs. This could help determine if the Monday effect generalizes to other health behaviors.

3. Examine the long-term sustainability of the QSQM approach by following participants for 6 months or longer after the end of the program. This could provide insight into whether the Monday effect leads to sustained behavior change. 

4. Identify the optimal components of the QSQM approach (e.g. Monday messaging, check-ins, materials) to determine which elements are most effective at improving engagement and outcomes. This could help refine the intervention.

5. Conduct qualitative research to gain an in-depth understanding of participants' experiences with the Monday concept. Interviews or focus groups could provide insights into why and how Mondays motivate new beginnings and behavior change.
