    "abstractText": "We compute bounds on screened scalar field theories from hydrogenlike systems. New light scalar fields generically have a direct coupling to matter. Such a coupling is strongly constrained by myriad experimental measurements. However, certain theories possess a screening mechanism that allows the effects of this coupling to weaken dynamically, and to evade many such bounds. We compute the perturbations to the energy levels of hydrogenlike systems due to screened scalar fields. We then use this result in two ways. First, we compute bounds from hydrogen spectroscopy, finding significantly weaker bounds than have been reported before as screening effects were overlooked. Second, we show that muonium is an intrinsically much more sensitive probe of screened scalar fields. For chameleon models, muonium experiments probe a large part of the parameter space that is as yet unexplored by low-energy physics and has so far only been tested by high-energy particle physics experiments.",

New light scalar fields generically have a direct coupling to matter. Such a coupling is strongly constrained by myriad experimental measurements. However, certain theories possess a screening mechanism that allows the effects of this coupling to weaken dynamically, and to evade many such bounds. We compute the perturbations to the energy levels of hydrogenlike systems due to screened scalar fields. We then use this result in two ways. First, we compute bounds from hydrogen spectroscopy, finding significantly weaker bounds than have been reported before as screening effects were overlooked. Second, we show that muonium is an intrinsically much more sensitive probe of screened scalar fields. For chameleon models, muonium experiments probe a large part of the parameter space that is as yet unexplored by low-energy physics and has so far only been tested by high-energy particle physics experiments.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.044008\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEinstein\u2019s theory of gravity, with a small cosmological constant, and the Standard Model of particle physics are both staggeringly successful models of our universe. Nevertheless, it is still useful to consider additions to these models, as there are multiple well-known puzzles associated with the standard paradigm. For instance, the accelerated expansion of the Universe has motivated a wide range of models that modify our theory of gravity (for recent reviews, see [1\u20133]). Likewise, new physics has also recently been invoked to explain the 4.2\u03c3 tension between the Standard Model prediction [4\u201323] and experimental measurements [24,25] of the muon\u2019s anomalous magnetic dipole moment, the observed electron recoil in XENON1T [26], and the planar arrangement of satellite galaxies [27]. These puzzles justify the addition of at least one new particle species to alleviate tension between theory and experiment. The minimal addition is a single degree of freedom, typically in the form a new scalar field. In order for this approach to work it is important that this addition does not\ncreate new tensions. Crucially, a generic feature of new scalar fields is an explicit coupling to matter. This coupling enables the new scalar to mediate a \u201cfifth force\u201d between matter particles, which is subject to strong constraints from laboratory, solar system, and astrophysical tests of gravity. The conventional wisdom is that the new scalar\u2019s coupling to matter fields must be exceedingly weak, or the scalar particle\u2019s mass must be sufficiently large that the fifth force is too short-ranged to be detectable. A powerful loophole to this argument exists, however. For certain matter couplings and scalar self-interactions, the fifth force can weaken dynamically. This property, dubbed a \u201cscreening mechanism\u201d, enables a theory with intrinsically strong, and long-ranged, fifth forces to pass experimental tests [28]. There are three broad classes of screening mechanisms known to date. First, there is chameleon screening [29], in which scalar particles\u2019 mass becomes large in dense environments, making the fifth force shortranged. Second, symmetron screening [30\u201332] involves a matter coupling that depends on the average ambient matter density, such that the field decouples in dense environments. Finally, there is derivative-induced screening, for instance the Vainshtein mechanism [33,34] of massive gravity [35,36] and galileons [37], for example, in which the fifth force law departs from 1=r2 at near distances.

Some of most relevant laboratory tests include atom interferometers [38\u201343], cold bouncing neutrons [44\u201346], electron g \u2212 2 measurements [47], and torsion balances [48,49], all of which have been recently reviewed in [3,50\u201352]. Although these theories were originally motivated by dark energy, they have since found application in other arenas, such as the effects of dark matter [53\u201358], or to explain the muon\u2019s anomalous magnetic moment [59] and the electron recoil in XENON1T [60]. One of the most stringent bounds to date on new scalar fields has derived from hydrogen spectroscopy, and it has been used in the past to place bounds on Yukawa-like forces [61\u201363] aswell as to search for extra dimensions [64]. If the scalar coupling to matter is strong enough, and the scalar particle\u2019s Compton wavelength is longer than 1 \u00c5, then the new scalar field behaves as a potential that perturbs the energy levels in the hydrogen atom. This was computed for a generic scalar field in [61], implicitly assuming the hydrogen nucleus was unscreened. However, this bound does not extend in a straightforward manner to screened theories, as has been sometimes claimed. This bound essentially treats the hydrogen nucleus as a pointlike particle that is therefore exempt from screening. The resulting bounds are too stringent; an appropriate treatment would account for the finite size and radius of the hydrogen nucleus and the resulting screening effect of the fifth force sourced by it. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we revisit the spectroscopy bounds of [61] within the context of chameleon and symmetron theories, carefully accounting for the screening behavior of the scalar field around the nucleus. We will find that this process relaxes the bounds considerably. Second, we will consider a closely related system that turns out to be a far more sensitive probe of screened theories: muonium. This system, composed of an antimuon and an electron, has a spectrum nearly identical to that of hydrogen, yet is composed entirely of fundamental particles. As the constituent particles are truly pointlike in nature, they are not subject to the screening effect that is found for extended objects like hydrogen nuclei. We find bounds on screened scalar fields that are limited only by the finite range of the fifth force. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we derive expressions for a scalar field with a screening mechanism around an extended object. Our expressions apply only to canonical scalar fields like chameleon or symmetron theories. We do not consider Vainshtein-screened theories, as a proper treatment would require accounting for the presence of the Earth and Sun nearby, and is therefore outside the scope of this article. In Sec. III we compute the fifth-force perturbations to a hydrogenlike atom\u2019s energy levels. In Secs.

This measurement, along with Eq. (27), can constrain the parameters of canonical scalar field theories that couple to matter.

The edge of this exclusion region should be interpreted with some caution, however, as the hydrogen 1s \u2212 2s transition energy is also used to determine some of the fundamental constants of nature. However, in this work we will not consider uncertainties in the fundamental constants. We will see that, in the case of the chameleon, the parameter space tested by hydrogen is also tested by other experiments, so a detailed analysis of these uncertainties is not of pressing importance. To extend bounds into the regime where screening can occur we will use the more general result of Eq. (27), which relies on further experimental details. The proton, of course, has finite radius and density, and can therefore be screened. Its screening factor must be computed via Eq. (21). As seen in Sec. II, screening behavior relies on the ambient scalar field value \u03d5out. For the specific case of a chameleon field, this is determined in the following way.

If there is sufficient room inside the vacuum chamber, the field levels off at \u03d5min towards the middle of the chamber. This rolling behavior takes place over a distance \u2248m\u22121out. However, if the vacuum chamber is smaller than m\u22121out, then there is not sufficient room for this to take place, and instead the field will only reach a central value \u03d5vac such that Rvac \u2248meff\u00f0\u03d5vac\u00de\u22121 [38\u201340].

The antimuon has a positive charge and is much heavier than the electron, resulting in an energy spectrum that is nearly identical to that of hydrogen.5\nThe key advantage that muonium presents relative to hydrogen is that the source mass, the muon, is a fundamental particle with no internal structure. That is, the muon has zero finite extent and is always unscreened.6 Muonium thus represents an intrinsically more sensitive probe to screened scalar fields. That being said, there are two disadvantages that muonium has relative to hydrogen. First, the experimental uncertainty on the 1s \u2212 2s transition energy is larger by a factor of 100. Second, in the unscreened limit the fifth force\u2019s perturbation to the energy levels depends linearly on the mass of the nucleus [as can be seen in Eq. (26)], and a proton is heavier than a muon by a factor of 9. In the limit in which the proton is unscreened, then, hydrogen bounds are superior, although this space is already excluded by other experiments. As long as the Compton wavelength of the scalar field is much longer than the typical muon-electron separation (one Bohr radius a0), we can use Eq. (28) to find the general bound on the chameleon parameter\nM \u2273 550 GeV: \u00f034\u00de At small values of \u039b, however, the chameleon field becomes short-ranged inside the vacuum chamber, and the fifth force is exponentially suppressed by distance. Precisely when this occurs depends on the experimental details of the muonium spectroscopy measurement [68], which are summarized in Table I. The determination of \u03d5out proceeds in the same way as the previous section, and the resulting bounds on chameleon parameter space are shown in Fig. 1. Before moving on, we briefly consider one potential area of concern in this calculation. We have used the static\nchameleon field profile to compute the perturbations to the energy levels, but the muonium atom itself is a transient phenomenon, with a half-life of order \u223c\u03bcs. Although a detailed consideration of time-dependent effects in chameleon theories is well beyond the scope of this work, an order of magnitude estimate demonstrates that the relevant physics should be well captured in the static approximation. The muonium atoms form when incident muons interact with an SiO2 powder, and are measured roughly 1 \u03bcs later [68]. Fluctuations in the chameleon field propagate at the speed of light, and in that time can travel a distance 12 orders of magnitude greater than the size of the muonium atom itself. As such, there should be ample time for the chameleon field to relax to its classical profile around the muon in that time."

(21), the symmetron screening factor for a uniform-density, spherical object of mass mN and radius R is\n\u03bbscr \u00bc min 4\u03c0RM2\nmN ; 1\n: \u00f039\u00de\nIf the vacuum chamber is smaller than the symmetron\u2019s Compton wavelength \u03bc\u22121, the field remains at the false vacuum \u03d5 \u00bc 0 everywhere [49]. This is because the stable field configuration is the one that minimizes the energy, and therefore balances energy in the field\u2019s potential Veff against gradient energy \u00f0\u2207\u20d7\u03d5\u00de2. Achieving a nonzero field profile necessitates that the gradient energy cost of rolling to a nonzero value is outweighed by the energy savings of the field sitting at the true vacuum \u03d5 \u00bc v in the central regions of the vacuum chamber. In a small vacuum chamber where Rvac < \u03bc\u22121, there is insufficient room for this to occur, and the field consequently remains at \u03d5 \u00bc 0 everywhere inside the chamber. With these considerations for the symmetron field, the computation of the constraints from hydrogen and muonium spectroscopy proceeds in exactly the same way as before. One of the theoretically best-motivated values of \u03bc is to set it to the dark energy scale, \u03bc \u00bc meV, as the vacuum fluctuations of the symmetron would account for dark energy. The bounds we obtain in this case are plotted in Fig. 2. We see that the bounds from muonium are slightly superior to bounds from electron g \u2212 2 experiments. Meanwhile, we see that hydrogen, when the proton is unscreened (that is, for M \u2273 100 MeV) is the leading experimental constraint. In Fig. 3 we show bounds for a range of \u03bc values spanning 14 orders of magnitude. It is remarkable that a single experiment can constrain such a wide range in \u03bc. This is possible for the following reason. A laboratory experiment employing extended objects can only constrain a narrow range Lsystem < \u03bc\u22121 < Rvac, where Lsystem is the size of the system being measured and Rvac is the size of the chamber the experiment is performed in. This is because a Compton wavelength \u03bc\u22121 that is smaller than the distance between an experiment\u2019s source and test masses leads to an exponentially suppressed symmetron force as e\u2212\u03bcr. On the other hand, we have already seen that a Compton wavelength \u03bc\u22121 that is larger than the vacuum chamber leads to a vanishing vev and matter coupling. For an atom interferometry test, this hierarchy of scales is of order Lsystem=Rvac \u2248 mm10 cm \u2248 10\n\u22122. For a hydrogen or muonium spectroscopy experiment, this hierarchy is much larger Lsystem=Rvac \u2248 \u00c510 cm \u2248 10\n\u22129, allowing sensitivity to symmetron models with a much wider range of \u03bc values. This trait\nis shared by other experiments that probe very short length scales, notably bouncing neutrons [70,71] and g \u2212 2 measurements [47]. In the case of muonium, the constraint takes a particularly simple form as there is no screening of the nucleus to account for. In this case, the perturbation to the 1s \u2212 2s energy gap is\n\u03b4E1s\u22122s \u00bc 3\u03bc2 \u03bbM2 m\u03bcme 16\u03c0a0 ; \u00f040\u00de\nso long as the vacuum\u2019s density is below the symmetron\u2019s critical density, \u03c1vac < \u03bc2M2, and the symmetron Compton wavelength lies between the average muon-electron separation distance and the vacuum chamber size, 1 \u00c5 < \u03bc\u22121 < 1 cm. The constraint may then be expressed economically as\n\u03bcffiffi \u03bb p M < 10\u221212 eV; \u00f041\u00de\nso long as the above-mentioned inequalities are satisfied. This bound can be observed as a diagonal line in constraint plots for a range of symmetron masses in Figs. 2 and 3. We observe that the muonium bounds are competitive with the electron g \u2212 2 experiment and (along with the g \u2212 2 experiment) are the leading source of constraints when the symmetron mass is greater than an MeV.\n044008-7\n044008-8"

            "text": "In this paper we have computed the perturbations to the spectra of hydrogenlike systems due to screened scalar fields. We applied our results first to hydrogen, as its 1s \u2212 2s energy level spacing is known to great precision. We then applied the same techniques to muonium. Although muonium\u2019s spectrum has not been measured to the same degree of accuracy, the fact that it is composed entirely of fundamental particles makes it an excellent probe of screened theories. We have presented bounds for two prototypical examples of screened theories: the chameleon and the symmetron. We have shown that the muonium bounds on these theories are approximately an order of magnitude stronger than those derived electron g \u2212 2 experiments, as long as the scalar field\u2019s Compton wavelength is larger than the average muon-electron separation distance in muonium. Furthermore, the new muonium bounds rule out about half of the viable chameleon models that eliminate the muon g \u2212 2 tension [47], although it is worth noting that those models are already in some tension with bounds from kaon decays. That being said, those bounds originate from particle physics experiments where the validity of the\nscreened modified gravity models as effective field theories is not guaranteed. Here we have focused on low-energy physics only and therefore can trust the effective description. This result makes it clear that a reduction in the uncertainty of muonium\u2019s 1s \u2212 2s transition energy by one to two orders of magnitude could play a major role in constraining, or ruling out, relevant screened modified gravity theories. This would directly test the models that seek to explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment results. It would also test chameleon models that are currently being investigated within the context of cosmic voids [72]. In the future, it would also be of interest to include couplings to other Standard Model gauge fields, most notably the photon. This would modify the scalar field profile that is sourced by the nucleus and would enable spectroscopy measurements to also place bounds the photon-scalar coupling. This is left for future work."
