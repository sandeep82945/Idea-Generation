Exploration of Other Natural Additives: Investigate the impact of other natural additives with high polyphenol content, similar to green tea, on sensory, physicochemical properties, and safety aspects of foods cooked using air frying and oven baking methods. For example, additives like turmeric, cocoa, or berries could be explored for their effects on improving food quality and reducing harmful compound formation.

Diverse Food Models: Expand the research to include different food models beyond cupcakes, such as meats, vegetables, or other bakery products, to understand how air frying and oven baking, along with natural additives, affect a broader range of food types. This would help in comprehensively understanding the implications of cooking methods and additive fortification on food quality and safety.

Long-term Health Impact Studies: Conduct long-term health impact studies to evaluate the effects of consuming foods prepared with air frying versus oven baking, particularly when fortified with natural additives like green tea. Such studies could provide insights into how these cooking methods and fortifications influence chronic diseases risk, taking into account the formation of harmful compounds like AGEs.

Technological Improvements in Air Fryers: Based on the findings that air frying resulted in higher weight loss and differences in food quality compared to oven baking, future research could focus on technological improvements in air fryers. This could include designing air fryers that mimic the heating characteristics of oven baking more closely or introducing features that allow for the better preservation of food moisture and reduction of harmful compound formation.

Mechanistic Studies on Additive Effects: Perform detailed mechanistic studies to understand how green tea and other natural additives interact at the molecular level with food components during air frying and oven baking. This could involve examining the stability of active compounds under different cooking conditions, their interaction with food matrices, and their role in inhibiting the formation of harmful compounds. Such studies would provide a deeper understanding of how to effectively use natural additives for healthier cooking methods.
