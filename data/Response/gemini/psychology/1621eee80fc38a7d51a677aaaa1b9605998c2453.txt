1. **Investigate the effect of deamidation on the functional properties of other plant proteins.** The current study focused on pea proteins, but it would be interesting to see if similar results could be obtained with other plant proteins, such as soy, wheat, or rice proteins. This would help to determine the generality of the deamidation process and its potential for improving the functional properties of a wide range of plant proteins.


2. **Explore the use of deamidated plant proteins in food applications.** The improved solubility and heat stability of deamidated plant proteins make them promising candidates for use in a variety of food applications. For example, they could be used as ingredients in beverages, soups, sauces, and baked goods. Further research is needed to investigate the sensory and functional properties of deamidated plant proteins in these applications.


3. **Study the long-term stability of deamidated plant proteins.** The current study only looked at the short-term stability of deamidated plant proteins. However, it is important to know how these proteins will behave over longer periods of time, especially when they are subjected to different storage conditions. This information is essential for the development of commercial products containing deamidated plant proteins.


4. **Investigate the potential health benefits of deamidated plant proteins.** Some studies have shown that deamidation can improve the nutritional value of proteins by increasing their digestibility and absorption. It would be interesting to see if deamidated plant proteins have similar health benefits. This could open up new opportunities for using deamidated plant proteins in functional foods and nutraceuticals.


5. **Develop new methods for deamidating plant proteins.** The current study used a commercial PG enzyme to deamidate pea proteins. However, there may be other, more efficient or cost-effective methods for deamidating plant proteins. Exploring these methods could help to make deamidated plant proteins more accessible and affordable for use in food applications.
