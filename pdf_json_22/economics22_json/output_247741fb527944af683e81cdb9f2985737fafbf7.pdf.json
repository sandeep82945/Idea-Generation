    "abstractText": "Environmental regulations, once promulgated, can cause incentive conflict between manufacturers and suppliers. A manufacturer facing the regulation may undertake choices that can affect his sourcing decisions with the supplier. To analyze this, we develop a game-theoretic model considering a manufacturer who faces a per-unit carbon emissions cap and sources from a supplier. The manufacturer operates in a carbon sensitive market. We analyze the responses of the manufacturer and supplier and show that since the burden of carbon emissions cap is borne by the manufacturer, the first-best outcomes are not reached. Therefore, the supplier may offer different contracts to incentivize the manufacturer. We study two mechanisms: the two-part tariff and the revenue-and-investment sharing contracts. We show how such contracts achieve coordination and deliver efficient supply chain outcomes. Interestingly, we find that the contract preferences of the manufacturer and the supplier may not be the same and vary under different market conditions. Summarily, we highlight important considerations for the supply chain players in designing suitable incentives.",

The primary focus within this has been the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Different countries have promulgated policies to reduce GHG emissions, which have had a significant impact on firms\u2019 products and supply chain processes. Consequently, environmental improvements in supply chains have received attention from firms in addition to the design and development of green products [1]. Scholars as well, have explored problems in the areas of product life cycle management, carbon footprint measurement, reverse logistics, remanufacturing etc. ([2\u20135] and the references therein). Our paper considers an incentiveconflict problem arising from the carbon cap regulation and undertakes a multi-stakeholder perspective.\nWhile studies have analyzed the choice of optimal environmental regulations and examined\nthe decisions of the government as a social planner [6, 7], few have examined how such\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 1 / 20\na1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Kuiti MR, Basu P, Ghosh D (2022) Incentive conflict and supply contracts under carbon cap policy.

Consider, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) regulations in the U.S. for lowering nitrogen-oxide emissions from commercial trucks, cement mixers and trash trucks that propose tighter emission norms from the model year 2027. The regulations require manufacturers to design better exhaust systems for gasoline and diesel engine models. This entails new technology investments and supplier relationships. In response to the proposed changes to the emission norms, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association in the U.S. said that the costs of compliance with such norms would be high and much of these costs would be passed on to the customers. The Association also mentioned that the requisite technology is not available at lower costs as ideally expected and manufacturers may struggle to develop a complying product (https://www.wsj.com/articles/epa-aims-to-cut-toxicemissions-from-commercial-trucks-11646670626?page=1).\nFor several countries such as France and Germany, the Covid-19 bailout packages were\nclosely tied up with the pressure on automakers to adopt sustainability measures in their supply chains. This meant an opportunity to collaborate with domestic or nearshore suppliers or select suppliers with the best records on emissions (https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliver wyman/2020/05/27/mid-covid-auto-must-face-its-next-challenge-carbon-neutrality/?sh= 3f6b681656ee). Regulatory changes, therefore, create substantial pressure on manufacturers who may undertake decisions that can affect their relationship with their suppliers. This necessitates the investigation of a manufacturer\u2019s and supplier\u2019s decisions in a supply chain under environmental regulations. Furthermore, considering the additional costs or penalties that the manufacturer has to bear, opportunities for cost-sharing and collaboration between the manufacturer and supplier arise to help comply with the environmental norms. This necessitates the analysis of contracts that can benefit the players and the supply chain.\nWe, therefore, raise the following research questions\u20141) How does an environmental regulation such as the carbon cap impact a manufacturer-supplier dyad? 2) Are there supply contracts that enable higher supply chain performance under the carbon cap regulation? To answer these questions, we analyze a manufacturer-supplier dyad where the manufacturer faces carbon cap regulation and undertakes greening as a response. The manufacturer sources raw material from the supplier and operates in a green-sensitive market. In a game-theoretic setting, we analyze the decisions of each player. We explore mechanisms to align the incentives of the players in the supply chain and study two mechanisms which implement the first-best outcomes. We conduct a comparative analysis to identify various conditions under which each player would prefer a specific contract. We derive several policy insights and lessons for supply chain managers."

            "heading": "1.1 Summary of findings",
            "text": "Our results show that the manufacturer strategically balances the pricing and the carbon emission decisions under different scenarios based on varying levels of consumer green sensitivity, price elasticity and green investment expenditures. As the carbon emission standards are tightened, the manufacturer is forced to increase the amount of carbon reduction. This also results in an increase in prices by the supplier and manufacturer respectively. Therefore, stricter carbon emission standards force the manufacturer to increase the amount of carbon reduction and selling price. However, with an increase in price, consumer welfare is affected. These findings have important ramifications for policymakers who may subsidize carbon reduction initiatives of manufacturers leading to improved consumer welfare.\nWe explore contractual agreements through which the supplier may share some of the\nmanufacturer\u2019s cost of greening. We find that based on the market characteristics and greening\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 2 / 20\ncosts, the contract preference of the supplier and the manufacturer may differ. Under higher greening costs or high price sensitivity, the manufacturer prefers a revenue-and-investment sharing contract whereas, if the greening cost is low or price sensitivity is low, the manufacturer prefers a two-part tariff contract. Additionally, the manufacturer prefers the two-part tariff contract when consumers have a high carbon reduction sensitivity, while a revenue-andinvestment sharing contract as consumers\u2019 carbon reduction sensitivity decreases. The above results provide important directions for the supply chain players to design suitable incentives that can drive effective win-win outcomes.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, we discuss the back-\nground motivation of our study. Section 3 discusses the relevant literature. Section 4 discusses the model conceptualization and formulation. The analytical results are presented in Sections 4 and 5. The supply contracts and numerical results are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper and presents future research ideas."

            "heading": "2. Background",
            "text": "Our study is motivated by the environmental regulations enacted in different geographies and noticeably how they impact manufacturers and their suppliers. We discuss two such regulations. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and Greenhouse Gas emission (GHG) regulations that were jointly issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S., underwent a significant change to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions for passenger cars and light trucks(https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-fuel-efficiency-standards-risk-splitting-groups11627909200). The new norms have provisions that force vehicle manufacturers to review their existing product designs and consider changes to adhere to the government-mandated carbon emission standards. By extension, this has implications for their suppliers since product design changes require suppliers to work towards new component manufacturing.\nSimilarly, in the EU, in the road transport sector, the EU legislators fixed the emission tar-\ngets for light-duty (cars and vans) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) (buses and trucks) to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. The legislation mandates that the manufacturer pay the excess emissions premium for each registered light-duty vehicle if the manufacturer\u2019s fleet does not meet the set targets. Such regulatory changes combined with the Covid-19 impact on the automakers due to semiconductor shortages mean that suppliers work with extremely thin margins, manufacturing disruptions, and higher costs of components (https://www.wsj.com/ articles/it-was-a-pretty-good-year-in-the-car-businessexcept-for-suppliers-11638700201). There arises a need to assess the supply chain decisions under environmental norms and examine contracts that can drive a win-win outcome for the supply chain entities while complying with the environmental norms. This motivates our study.\nLastly, our study also considers the demand-side effect of environmental initiatives. We con-\nsider that firms (namely, the manufacturer and supplier) operate in a market where consumers are environmentally friendly. In the last few decades, consumers\u2019 preferences for green products have led to additional implications for firms. Studies have shown that there are consumer segments that are environmentally conscious and prefer green products. For many firms, this signals an opportunity to drive product changes and target such consumer markets [8\u201310]. We, therefore, consider consumer demand to be positively affected by the level of the greenness of a product. An eco-friendly or green product by definition is one, which consumes fewer resources during production and emits less carbon [2, 11, 12]. Therefore, we consider a model of consumer demand, which depends on the product\u2019s green level, which is measured by reduced carbon emissions. The higher the reduction in carbon emissions, the greener the product.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 3 / 20\nOur study, therefore, aims to develop an integrated model of decision-making considering\nconsumer preferences, and firms\u2019 decisions in a supply chain. We next discuss the background literature and position our work in the extant literature."

            "text": "Extant studies have examined important issues related to carbon emissions in supply chains [13\u201316]. A notable number of studies [17\u201320] have analyzed firm decisions in the presence of various kinds of government-mandated carbon emission policies. For example, Chen et al. [21] derived the optimal tax in a supply chain that not only meets the carbon emission reduction target but also achieves sustainable economic development goals. It has been observed that the implementation of a carbon tax in the supply chain motivates manufacturers to invest in carbon reduction technology [22, 23]. Another popular carbon emission policy\u2014cap-andtrade has also been studied in the supply chain context [24\u201326]. Tong et al. [27] showed that the cap-and-trade policy and consumers\u2019 preference for low-carbon product jointly stimulates the manufacturer\u2019s and retailer\u2019s behavior toward sustainable practices. Later, Wang and Wu [28] showed how cap-and-trade policy plays a role in strategic decisions of carbon emission reduction and collection of used products in a closed-loop supply chain. The authors found that the carbon emission abatement level increases with the carbon trading price, whereas the used product return rate decreases with the carbon trading price. In addition, literature has also examined competition in supply chains under carbon emissions [29\u201331]. Zhou et al. [32] showed that implementation of carbon tax policy in a supply chain not only enhances the sales for the retailer of environment-friendly products relative to other competing retailers but also improves social welfare.\nOther areas such as technology investments in the presence of carbon tax [22], third-party\nlogistics as a service [33], and interconnectedness of delivery time and carbon emission in presence of carbon tax [34] etc. have been discussed in the literature. However, carbon-cap as a regulation and supply chain decisions have had limited focus. Secondly, the incentive conflict that arises from carbon-cap regulation in supply chains has not been studied. For instance, the manufacturer has to mandatorily meet the carbon-cap regulation which leads to a higher cost burden for the manufacturer and can lead to an incentive conflict in the supply chain. Extant literature does not, however, highlight incentive conflicts that may arise from carbon emission regulations. We study the problem considering the manufacturer-supplier relationship where the manufacturer must bear the unit carbon emission cap mandated by the government. We examine how the amount of reduced carbon emission, prices, and profits are influenced by the regulation. Incentive conflict problems under carbon cap policies have received limited attention in the past and this is the gap we seek to address."

As regulations evolved, several of these contracts were examined in the sustainable supply chain context as well. For example, Yi and Li [39] designed the cost-sharing contract for energy saving and emissions reduction in the supply chain in presence of Government subsidy and carbon tax. Xu et al. [25] analyzed the revenue sharing and two-part tariff contracts for a two-echelon supply chain consisting of manufacturer-retailer in the presence of a cap-and-trade policy. Further, Bai et al. [40] showed that the economic and environmental sustainability of the decentralized system can be improved under revenue and cost-sharing contract in the presence of a cap-and-trade policy.\nSeveral coordination mechanisms have been studied in extant OM literature such as the revenue-sharing, wholesale price, quantity flexibility, price-discount, and sales-rebate contracts. However, models considering carbon regulations and conflict arising from green initiatives are still nascent. At the time of writing, issues related to impact of carbon taxes and carbon pricing were discussed at the Conference of Parties (COP26) Summit, under the aegis of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at Glasgow (https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/global-business-tells-governments-atcop26-put-a-price-on-carbon-but-do-it-the-right-way/), demonstrating the need for improved understanding on how regulations affect supply chain entities. Limited studies have analyzed such incentive conflict and coordination problems in manufacturer-supplier dyads. Our paper seeks to address this gap.\nBelow we provide a summary of relevant literature and position our current work in the\nextant literature (refer to Table 1)."

The manufacturer produces the product and directly sells it to end customers after procuring raw material from the supplier. Since the manufacturer is primarily responsible for the product and the associated carbon emissions with it, it is assumed that the government-mandated carbon emissions cap applies to the manufacturer. The manufacturer incurs the cost of greening even though both supply chain players benefit from the green sensitive consumer demand leading to an incentive conflict. Further, the manufacturer undertakes greening investments to redesign the product to meet government-mandated emission norms [26, 41]."

Linearity assumptions with respect to price and non-price variables in supply chain settings involving inter-firm interactions have been made in several operations management and marketing studies [24, 40, 43]. In our model, we assume that the initiative for the reduction of a product\u2019s carbon emission is considered a green product innovation. The demand function therefore, reflects a \u2018green\u2019 conscious consumer.\nIn keeping with the current trend in sustainable consumption, studies have indicated that\nthe environmental awareness of consumers has a positive impact on their buying decisions\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 5 / 20\n[44]. Empirical studies have shown that consumers prefer to buy products from companies behaving in environmentally responsible manner [45] and they refuse to buy products from those who are found accused of being polluters [46]. From these findings, we assume that product greening level has a positive impact on demand and this effectiveness is measured by (\u03b3) in our model. Since, our model is motivated by the fuel efficiency changes in vehicles under various carbon cap regulations, fuel efficiency has a direct implication on consumer demand [47]. Therefore, the product\u2019s demand is considered to be a function of price and carbon emission reduction amount [35, 48, 49] given as,\nD p;Dk\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc a bp\u00fe gDk \u00f01\u00de\nThe demand function (1) is linearly increasing in \u0394k, the amount of reduction of carbon emission per unit and decreasing in p, the selling price of the product.

It is observed that the manufacturer strategically increases the price of the product in markets where consumers have a higher preference for greenness. The result suggests that manufacturers can extract a price premium from green sensitive consumers. This is supported by our observations earlier, where to support manufacturers in designing and developing environmentally friendly products, the EU follows a strategy of CO2 labeling of cars, which provides key information about fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions to new customers. With the aim to drive carbon reduction initiatives, while policy makers formulate emission norms, the above results also demonstrate that policy support is required to create green sensitive consumer markets. Under the twin effects of carbon emission norms and green markets, higher reduction in carbon emissions of products can be achieved.\nInterestingly, proposition 1(b) reveals that for a price sensitive consumer segment, the manufacturer can strategically reduce the amount of carbon reduction of the product. Eq (2) highlights that the manufacturer maintains his profits by reducing associated cost related to greenness of the product (both variable and fixed cost of greening). Thus, in price sensitive consumer markets, manufacturers are unable to provide higher level of carbon reduction. We next study the effect of carbon reduction cost on the equilibrium decisions.\nProposition 2: The per unit reduction in carbon emission and the manufacturer\u2019s selling price decrease with the increase of fixed investment cost under Case1, i.e.,\n(i) @Dk11 @I \ufffd 0 and (ii) @p11 @I \ufffd 0: The result shows that with increase in fixed investment cost, the manufacturer reduces the\namount of carbon emission reduction. Interestingly though, the price of the product is also reduced with increase in investment cost. Eq (2) highlights that the manufacturer influences the market demand through two decisions under increasing investment cost. While he strategically reduces the amount of carbon reduction, he also reduces the price to increase the market demand, thus, maintaining his profits.\nNext, we analyze the impact of government-mandated carbon cap on the strategic decisions\nof the players.\nProposition 3: The impact of per unit carbon cap on the strategic decisions of players under case 2 is as follows: (i) @Dk2\n@N1 \ufffd 0, (ii) @w2 @N1 \ufffd 0, and (ii) @p2 @N1 \ufffd 0.\nThe above result demonstrates the critical role that government-mandated standards\nplay in forcing firms to undertake carbon reduction initiatives. We observe that as carbon emission standards are tightened (i.e., the value of carbon cap N1 decreases), the manufacturer is forced to increase the amount of carbon reduction. This also results in increase in prices by the supplier and manufacturer respectively. This is an outcome of the strategic decision of the players to maintain their respective margins. The result shows why policy makers have an important role to play in forcing manufacturers to undertake carbon reduction initiatives, particularly, when voluntary initiatives by firms are not sufficient to achieve higher greening standards. However, consumer welfare is affected since the selling price increases with tighter cap. Policy makers may therefore consider subsidizing carbon emission initiatives of manufacturers, or supply chain entities may consider sharing the cost of greening under government norms.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 10 / 20\nProposition 4: The optimal total profits of the centralized and decentralized channels satisfy the following relations:\nY\nC \ufffd\n4\n3\nY\nDC when I \ufffd I\u0302\nY\nC \u00bc\n4\n3\nY\nDC when I\u0302 \ufffd I \ufffd \ufffdI ;\nY\nC \ufffd\n4\n3\nY\nDC when I \ufffd \ufffdI ;\nThe above result suggests that the centralized channel profit is always greater than the\ndecentralized channel. Clearly, coordination between the supplier and manufacturer in the decentralized channel can reduce this profit differential. Since the burden of the carbon emission cap as mandated by the Government falls on the manufacturer, the supplier could offer a different contract to increase the profitability of both channel members. In what follows, we propose a two-part tariff and a revenue and investment-sharing contract to study channel coordination (Proof is given in Appendix G in S1 Appendix)."

Thus, the two-part tariff contract perfectly coordinates the decentralized channel within a certain range of fixed cost paid by the supplier. Under this contract, the per unit charge of raw material by the supplier is sufficient to cover the per unit supplier cost cs. Thus, the contract incentivizes the manufacturer to lower his product price. Further, the supplier improves his profit from the fixed-fee component, which would be a result of negotiation between the supplier and manufacturer, within the limits provided by our result. Thus, both the supplier and manufacturer benefit under the two-part tariff contract.\nIn a two-part tariff contract, one of the parties commits to pay a fixed amount to the other\nalong with the wholesale price. However, the applicability of the two-part tariff contract is a challenge because the supplier may not be willing to reduce the wholesale prices and make it close to per unit production cost. On the contrary, revenue and investment sharing contract would be applicable in scenarios where information sharing and financial reporting is transparent between the channel members. Thus we study the revenue and investment sharing in the next section."

On the other hand, the manufacturer takes his optimal decisions, which are equivalent to the centralized decision. In addition, we see that, the total supply chain profit under RIS contract is equal to the centralized profit when the sharing proportion \u03c6 lies between the above ranges. Therefore, the contract perfectly coordinates the decentralized channel for certain values of \u03c6. Furthermore, under this contract, both the supply chain players generate higher profits than in the decentralized case. Therefore, the contract is an efficient contract for the players as well as the supply chain.\nTherefore, both the contracts are accepted by the supply chain entities, since the contract\nparameters provide a higher profit for each entity than the corresponding decentralized supply chain."

Since, the burden of carbon emission reduction falls on the manufacturer in both contracts (TT, RIS) and on the supplier in RIS contract only, the strategic decisions of the players are such that they tend to decrease overall supply chain profitability. Further, the result suggests that the manufacturer prefers the two-part tariff contract when the value of green investment parameter is low, whereas, for high values of this parameter, he prefers the revenue and investment-sharing contract. On the other hand, the choice of the supplier is opposite of the manufacturer. Since, the cost for greening investment shared by the supplier increases with the increase in value of this parameter, the RIS contract is desirable for the supplier for low values of greening investments. There are clear lessons for supply chain managers and policy makers. Policy makers should offer incentives to reduce cost burden of manufacturers besides establishing carbon emission norms.\n6.3.2 Analyzing the impact of price elasticity on profits. To describe the effect of price elasticity on profits, we consider the following values for the parameters: \u03b1 = 1000, I = 75, \u03b3 = 1, k0 = 15, N1 = 11, cm = 8, cs = 20 and \u03c4 = 0.6. The value of price elasticity \u03b2 is varied from 0.2 to 0.5 (refer Fig 2).\nThe results show that the profits of the players and the supply chain decrease with increase\nin price sensitivity. Further, in Proposition 1(b) we have noted that the increase in price sensitivity results in the manufacturer reducing the amount of carbon reduction. As a result, the players\u2019 profitability and the overall supply chain profits reduce. Clearly, price sensitive consumer markets are an impediment to carbon reduction initiatives. Efforts by policy makers to influence consumers to purchase green products, such as providing tax benefits, will significantly support the manufacturer to undertake some initiatives for reduction of carbon emission. In addition, from the perspective of coordination mechanisms, we observe that the twopart tariff and RIS contracts are preferable for the manufacturer and supplier respectively when consumers are less price sensitive. On the other hand, in a high price sensitive consumer market, the RIS contract is better for manufacturer whereas, the supplier prefers the two-part tariff contract.\n6.3.3 Analyzing the impact of carbon emission reduction elasticity on profits. To\ndescribe the effect of carbon emission reduction elasticity on profits, we consider the following\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 14 / 20\nparameter values:\u03b1 = 1000, I = 47, \u03b2 = 0.3, k0 = 15, N1 = 11, cm = 8, cs = 20 and \u03c4 = 0.6. The value of carbon reduction elasticity \u03b3 is varied between 0.43 to 1 (refer Fig 3).\nWe observe that the green sensitive consumer markets lead to higher profits for the players\nand the overall supply chain. Thus, policy makers and supply chain managers should undertake initiatives to incentivize consumers to purchase green products. Further, we see that the manufacturer prefers the RIS contract and supplier prefers the two-part tariff contract when environmental awareness of consumers is less. On the other hand, in the high green sensitive consumer market, the RIS is preferable for supplier whereas, the manufacturer prefers the two-part tariff contract.\nIn summary, we observe that a preference divergence emerges between the manufacturer\nand supplier depending on the market characteristics and greening costs in driving carbon reduction efforts. Depending on carbon emission reduction elasticity, price elasticity and coefficient of greening investment, the manufacturer and supplier prefer different contract types. A key lesson to draw for managers is to observe the market characteristics prior to accepting contracts with their supply chain partners. We discuss these in further detail in the next section.\n6.3.4 Insights for practice. From the above analysis, we derive certain key insights. Tables 3\u20135 are true only for the region I\u0302 < I < \ufffdI . We find that those markets which require higher investment costs for greening or have higher price sensitivity, the manufacturer prefers a revenue and investment sharing contract. For markets in which the investment cost is low or price sensitivity is low, the manufacturer prefers a two-part tariff contract. The intuition behind the result is as follows. A RIS contract provides the incentive of green cost sharing with the supplier which is crucial for the manufacturer under externalities such as high investment costs or high price sensitivity. Recall that under both these cases the manufacturer lowers his per unit carbon emission reduction (refer Propositions 1 and 2) that lowers market demand and his profits. Therefore, the RIS contract is his preferable contract. When the market characteristics are such that greening requires lower investment or consumers are less price sensitive, the manufacturer can provide higher carbon emission reduction effort and charge higher prices.\nIn such a case, he prefers a contract which lowers his procurement cost from the supplier as\nenabled by the two-part tariff contract. The converse holds true for the supplier. Since under\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277777 November 17, 2022 15 / 20\nexternalities such as higher investment costs, the supplier shares the cost of greening with the manufacturer, his profits are lower. Therefore, he prefers a two-part tariff contract in comparison to the RIS contract. The players\u2019 preferences are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.\nNext, when the carbon reduction sensitivity is higher in markets, we find that the manufac-\nturer prefers the two-part tariff contract compared to the case when its lower (where the manufacturer prefers a RIS contract). The intuition is similar to the case above. When markets display higher positive externality such as carbon reduction sensitivity, the manufacturer increases his unit carbon reduction and charges higher prices (refer Proposition 1). He, therefore, prefers a contract which reduces his procurement cost with the supplier as provided by the two-part tariff contract. The converse holds true for the supplier. The result is summarized in Table 5.\nSupply chain managers would therefore note that suitable incentives can be designed to\ndrive efficient supply chain outcomes. Further, the results show that suppliers and manufacturers can consider different contracts based on market characteristics and greening costs in driving carbon reduction efforts.\nFrom a policy perspective, we note that emission norms drive the carbon reduction efforts\nof manufacturers as desired (refer Proposition 3). However, stricter carbon emission norms increase selling price as the manufacturer transfers the higher procurement cost and cost of greening to the consumer. This reduces consumer welfare. Therefore, a social planner may consider subsidizing the emission cost of the manufacturer or influence consumer markets to support green manufacturers to influence demand (as we note in the case of vehicle manufacturers in the EU)."

            "text": "Carbon emissions norms are increasingly being used by policy makers globally to drive product greening initiatives. This, however, may lead to incentive conflict since the costs of adhering to regulations is borne by the manufacturers. In this the context, we consider a supply chain where the carbon cap applies to the manufacturer, who undertakes greening investments to reduce carbon emission of the product while procuring raw material from the supplier.\nWe analyze the strategic decisions of the supply chain players and study the impact of various parameters on these decisions. We examine various contracts to coordinate the decentralized supply chain under carbon emissions cap. Our analysis demonstrates that the manufacturer strategically decreases the level of carbon reduction in a price sensitive consumer market, however, product greening enables the manufacturer to charge a higher selling price of the product. The study also shows that the manufacturer decreases the amount of carbon reduction and selling price of the product with an increase in green investment cost to maintain his profits. We determine regions based on the investment coefficient of the greening\ninitiative of the manufacturer and derive optimal carbon emission reduction decisions. We find that with increasing carbon reduction elasticity, the region in which the manufacturer provides more greening than mandated by government cap, increases. On the other hand, with increasing price sensitivity of customers, the region in which the manufacturer provides more greening than mandated by government cap decreases. The finding further suggests that stricter carbon emission standards force the manufacturer to increase the amount of carbon reduction and selling price.\nHowever, support by partners in the supply chain, namely, the supplier, can help reduce the cost burden for the manufacturer. Therefore, we propose a two-part tariff contract, and a revenue and investment-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain. We find that both the contracts perfectly coordinate the decentralized chain. Our numerical results illustrate the impact of key parameters such as greening investment cost, price sensitivity, and carbon reduction elasticity on individual players and compare the supply chain players\u2019 profits under two different contracts. We find that based on the market characteristics and greening costs, the preference of contract for both the supplier and manufacturer varies.\nIn markets that require higher investment costs for greening or have higher price sensitiv-\nity, the manufacturer prefers a revenue and investment sharing contract whereas in markets in which the investment cost is low or price sensitivity is low, the manufacturer prefers a twopart tariff contract. Additionally, when the carbon reduction sensitivity is higher, the manufacturer prefers the two-part tariff contract whereas, when its lower, the manufacturer prefers a RIS contract. The above results have important implications for managers to design suitable incentives that can drive efficient supply chain outcomes. Our results also provide critical insights for social planners or regulators. We find that under stricter carbon emission norms the manufacturer increases the selling price to transfer the higher procurement cost and cost of greening to the consumer. This reduces consumer welfare. In these circumstances, a social planner may consider subsidizing the emission cost of the manufacturer or influence consumer markets to support green manufacturers."

This could be further extended to consider multiple manufacturers and suppliers and horizonal competition between them. Such an approach will provide an industry perspective when policy changes such as emissions cap apply. Secondly, future work could also consider a strategic dynamic decision making of firms over multiple periods while facing government-mandated carbon emissions cap. For example, a firm could be polluting in period 1, and the emissions cap implemented at the end of period 1, affects the firm in period 2. Lastly, we have considered the case of full information between the supply chain entities. This could be further extended to the case when there is information asymmetry between the partners to develop richer insights.\nSupporting information\nS1 Appendix.
