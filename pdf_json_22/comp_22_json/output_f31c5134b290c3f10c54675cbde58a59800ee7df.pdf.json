Motivated by that the device activity at each frame is correlated to not only its previous frame but also its next frame, we propose a doublesided information (DSI) aided joint activity detection and channel estimation algorithm based on the approximate message passing (AMP) framework. The DSI is extracted from the estimation results in a sliding window that contains the target detection frame and its previous and next frames. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.",

INTRODUCTION\nMassive machine-type communication (mMTC) is one of the main use cases of the 5G and beyond mobile communication systems for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is featured by the massive number of IoT devices and their sporadic activities [1]. To enable massive connectivity, grant-free random access is introduced in 5G as a new random access technique where devices can access channel resources without undergoing a handshake process. Thereby, the signaling overhead can be efficiently reduced. However, the main technical challenge of grant-free random access is device activity detection and channel estimation.\nBy exploiting the sporadic nature of data traffic in mMTC, compressed sensing (CS) techniques have been widely utilized to perform activity detection and channel estimation jointly in the literature [1]. Among all these CS-based methods, the approximate message passing (AMP) based algorithms have demonstrated favorable performance at efficient computation complexity in [2]\u2013[5]. The covariance-based method [6] is another popular approach for activity detection, which can outperform the conventional CS-based methods when the number of antennas is large.\nIn practical IoT environment, if a device is activated by a burst event, the device often transmits continuously for a certain time interval. In other words, once activated, it often remains active in the upcoming consecutive transmission frames. This suggests that the device activity is correlated in the time domain. By accounting such temporal correlation, the performance of activity detection and channel estimation can be improved by formulating the problem from the dynamic CS (DCS) perspective [7]\u2013[9]. Specifically, the work [7] proposes a sequential AMP (S-AMP) algorithm for device activity detection by using the historical knowledge. In [8], a hybrid generalized AMP (HyGAMP) algorithm is employed to\nThe authors are with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China (e-mail: {wf.zhu, mxtao, yfguan69}@sjtu.edu.cn).\naccount the device activity information from both the previous frame and the next frame to improve performance. Note that both [7] and [8] focus on the scenario where the base station (BS) has single antenna. In [9], a side information aided multiple measurement vector based AMP (SI-aided MMVAMP) algorithm is proposed for both single-antenna and multiple-antenna scenarios. Here, the SI is defined as the estimation result in the previous frame. However, the algorithm only considers the SI from the single previous frame and thus the temporal correlation is not fully exploited.\nThis work aims to fully exploit the temporal correlation of device activity for further enhancing the joint activity detection and channel estimation performance. This is motivated by the fact that the activity of each device in a current frame is not only related to the activity in the previous frame (single side) but also correlated with the activity in the next frame (double sides). More specifically, if we know one device is active in the previous frame, then with a large probability it will be considered to be active in the current frame; but if we know that the device is active in both the previous and next frames, almost surely it is active in the current frame. Therefore, by exploiting the estimation results from the adjacent frames in double sides, one can further lift the performance of activity detection and channel estimation at each current frame.\nTo this end, we first introduce a sliding-window detection strategy to account the double-sided information (DSI) from the previous frame as well as the next frame. Then we propose a DSI-aided activity detection and channel estimation algorithm based on the AMP-SI framework proposed in [10]. The proposed activity detector employs the log likelihood ratio (LLR) test. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by further exploiting the temporal correlation of device activity."

As in [7]\u2013[9], the device activity evolution is modeled by a first-order steady Markov chain, which can be fully described by two transition probabilities p01 = Pr(\u03bbt+1n = 1|\u03bbtn = 0) and p11 = Pr(\u03bbt+1n = 1|\u03bbtn = 1).

The MMSE-optimal denoising function for user n in the vAMP framework with DSI can be represented as\n\u03b7n,i ( rtn,i,Stn ) = (1 + eti/\u03b2) \u22121\nrtn,i 1 + \u03c6tn,i(r t n,i,Stn) , (11)\nwhere\n\u03c6tn,i(r t n,i,Stn) = \u03c5tn,i \u00d7 1\u2212 pa pa \u00d7 p01 + (1\u2212 p01)\u03c5t\u22121n,\u221e p11 + (1\u2212 p11)\u03c5t\u22121n,\u221e\n\u00d7 p01 + (1\u2212 p01)\u03c5t+1n,\u221e p11 + (1\u2212 p11)\u03c5t+1n,\u221e , (12)\nand \u03c5tn,i is the inverse LLR defined as\n\u03c5tn,i = p(rtn,i|\u03bbtn = 0) p(rtn,i|\u03bbtn = 1) = ( \u03b2 + eti eti )M exp ( \u2212 \u039eti||rtn,i||22 ) ,\n(13)\nwith \u039eti = (e t i) \u22121 \u2212 (eti + \u03b2)\u22121. The inverse LLRs \u03c5t\u22121n,\u221e and \u03c5t+1n,\u221e are similarly calculated by following (13).\nProof: Please see Appendix A. To gain insights from Theorem 1, we consider some special cases. First, when there is no temporal correlation in user activity, i.e., p01 = p11 = pa, the function (12) is simplified as \u03c6tn,i(r t n,i,Stn) = 1\u2212pa pa \u03c5tn,i. Thus, the function in (11)\nreduces to the MMSE denoiser \u03b7n,i ( rtn,i ) = (1+eti/\u03b2) \u22121 rtn,i 1+\u03c5tn,i(1\u2212pa)/pa in [2], [3] without SI. Second, if we have \u03c5\u03c4n,\u221e = 1 for \u03c4 = t\u22121 or t+1, i.e., the device is equally likely to be active or inactive at frame \u03c4 , then the SI from frame \u03c4 provides no useful information for the estimation.\nTo get more insights, we consider the extreme case where the exact activities in the previous frame and the next frame are known, i.e., the corresponding SI is perfect. In this case, we have \u03c5\u03c4n,\u221e = \u221e if \u03bb\u03c4n = 0, and \u03c5\u03c4n,\u221e = 0 otherwise, for \u03c4 \u2208 {t \u2212 1, t + 1}. With perfect SI, then when user activity is fully correlated in time with p11 = 1, we have \u03bbtn = \u03bbn \u2208 {0, 1}, \u2200t. The MMSE-optimal denoising function becomes \u03b7n,i(rtn,i,Stn) = (1 + eti/\u03b2)\u22121rtn,i if \u03bbn = 1, or \u03b7n,i(r t n,i,Stn) = 0 if \u03bbn = 0. As such, the joint activity detection and channel estimation reduces to channel estimation only, and the channel estimator is a linear function that operates on each element of rtn,i individually. This suggests that the performance of the algorithm is independent of the number of antennas.\nWhen detecting the active users in the tth frame, the estimation results in the (t\u22121)th frame is already available and thus the SI {\u03c5t\u22121n,\u221e}Nn=1 can be readily obtained. On the other hand, the SI from the (t + 1)th frame need to be estimated.\n4 In this work, we propose to employ the vAMP algorithm [2], [3] to perform coarse detection and estimation in the (t+1)th frame, then the estimation results of {rt+1n,\u221e}Nn=1 and et+1\u221e are used to obtain {\u03c5t+1n,\u221e}Nn=1. Finally, we perform joint activity detection and channel estimation in the tth frame based on the vAMP-SI algorithm with {\u03c5t\u22121n,\u221e}Nn=1 and {\u03c5t+1n,\u221e}Nn=1."

The missed detection ratio (MDR) and the false alarm ratio (FAR) are used as the performance metrics for activity detection, the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) is used as the performance metric for channel estimation. The vAMP algorithm [2], [3] and the SI-aided MMV-AMP algorithm [9] are considered as benchmarks. We also evaluate the proposed algorithm with perfect SI as performance bound.\nFig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the activity detection and the channel estimation performance, respectively, at different pilot lengths. Here, we have set MDR = FAR by carefully selecting the decision threshold \u03b9rn. We observe that the proposed algorithm can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. We also observe that the performance gap to the lower bound with perfect SI reduces when the antenna number M and the pilot length L increases. In particular, when M = 4 and L = 500, the proposed vAMP-SI algorithm nearly converges to the ideal case. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can better exploit the temporal correlation in device activity to improve the performance.\nFig. 4 and Fig. 5 illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm under different transition probabilities p11, where the active probability is fixed to be pa = 1/5. As mentioned, when p01 = p11 = pa, the device activities in different frames are temporally independent. Thus, we consider that p11 ranges from 0.2 to 1 in the simulations. It is observed that by exploiting the double-sided information, the proposed vAMP-SI algorithm outperforms considerably the existing SI-\naided MMV-AMP. Similar to the result in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the performance of the proposed algorithm is closer the ideal performance with perfect SI by increasing M . When p11 = 1, the proposed algorithm with perfect SI has the same channel estimation performance for M = 2 and M = 4. This observation validates the discussion in Section IV-B that the channel estimation performance in this limiting case is irrelevant to the number of antennas."
