The asymmetry between positive and negative frequency branches in the displacement spectrum traces out the spectral features of the quantum fluctuations in the cavity field, which are thus explored over a wide spectral range. Moreover, in our two-dimensional mechanical system the quantum back-action, generated by such vacuum fluctuations, is strongly suppressed in a narrow spectral region due to a destructive interference in the overall susceptibility.\nA classical observable, described by a real function of time, always manifests a frequency-\nsymmetric spectrum. This requirement does not hold for quantum observables, which can exhibit\nasymmetric spectra originated by non-commuting operators. The spectral asymmetry is therefore\nan important indicator of non-classicality, and a useful tool for investigating quantum properties.\nAn important example of such quantum features is the vacuum noise in the photon number of\nthe electromagnetic field in a driven cavity, which is indeed expected to present an asymmetric\nspectrum [1]. This characteristic can be shown by parametrically coupling the field to the posi-\ntion of a mechanical oscillator, in opto-mechanics experiments [2, 3]. In the weak coupling regime\n(g < \u03ba/4, where g is the optomechanical coupling rate and \u03ba is the optical decay rate), the inter-\naction between electromagnetic field and mechanical motion can be understood in the framework\nof a Raman scattering picture, with an anti-Stokes (and a Stokes) process transferring energy and\nquanta from the oscillator to the cavity field (and vice-versa) [4, 5]. As a result of this process, two\nmotional sideband peaks are imprinted in the spectrum of the cavity field, tracing out the displace-\nment spectrum of the oscillator. Due to the asymmetry in the field vacuum fluctuations, the two\n\u2217 Electronic mail: marin@fi.infn.it\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n14 16\n8v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 5\nM ay\n2 02\n3\nsidebands are unbalanced, with the anti-Stokes (Stokes) Lorentzian peak amplitude proportional\nto n\u0304 (n\u0304+ 1). Here, n\u0304 is the resulting phononic occupancy of the mechanical oscillator [6, 7] which,\nfor suitable detuning \u2206 between the driving field and the cavity mode, is deeply cooled thanks to\nthe different probabilities of the two processes. The sideband asymmetry can be appreciated in\na heterodyne detection of the field exiting the cavity [8, 9]. In this regime, the oscillator motion\njust couples to the cavity field in a narrow spectral region around the mechanical resonance. The\namplitude imbalance between the anti-Stokes and Stokes peaks is a signature of both the spectral\nasymmetry of the back-action provided by the field vacuum fluctuations, and the non-classical\nmotion of the oscillator approaching its ground state [10, 11].\nWe argue that the analysis of the frequency asymmetry in the full spectrum, extended beyond\na mere quantification of the amplitude ratio between similar Lorentzian peaks, is a potentially\npowerful tool for exploring the quantum behavior of optomechanical systems. Already in the weak\ncoupling regime, different shapes of the two sidebands have been observed in a parametric squeezing\nexperiment [12, 13]. More generally, the full spectral analysis is particularly efficient outside the\nregime of single-mode and weak optomechanical coupling, where the scattering picture is no more\nsufficient to explain the displacement spectrum and, consequently, the spectrum of the output field.\nIn this work we exploit the quantum-coherent strong coupling regime [14\u201318] and show that the\noscillator fully unfolds its potentialities as quantum spectrometer [1]. The difference between the\npositive and negative frequency branches in the displacement spectrum is traced back to the char-\nacteristics of the quantum fluctuations in the cavity field, in particular their spectral shape dictated\nby the cavity filtering. Moreover, in a two-dimensional mechanical system we demonstrate that the\nquantum back-action, generated by the vacuum field fluctuations, is cancelled in a narrow spectral\nregion, due to the structure of the overall susceptibility characterized by modal interferences. Such\ncancellation does not occur for the thermal noise, since different modes couple to uncorrelated\nbaths [19]. As a consequence, the spectral asymmetry, which singles out the quantum component\nof the back-action, exhibits a sharp characteristic dip which provides the clearest experimental sig-\nnature of the field vacuum fluctuations. Furthermore, for strong enough two-dimensional cooling,\nthe Stokes sideband, dominated by the quantum backaction, presents a peculiar hole.\nOur experimental system [Fig. 1(a)] is based on a silica nanosphere (diameter 125 nm) levitated\nin the optical potential created by a strongly focused laser beam, generated by a Nd:YAG source\n(optical tweezer [20]) inside a vacuum chamber [21, 22]. Labelling with Z the tweezer axis and\nY the axis of the linear polarization [see Fig. 1(c) for a scheme], the oscillation frequencies are\n(\u2126x,\u2126y,\u2126z)/2\u03c0 = (131, 120, 30) kHz. The loading procedure is described in Ref. [23]. Due to its\nmuch lower frequency, the motion along Z is completely decoupled from the one on the orthogonal\nplane, and we will neglect it in this article. On the other hand, the motion on the XY plane is described by a fully two-dimensional system, as (\u2126x \u2212 \u2126y) is comparable to the optomechanical shifts and broadenings. The nanosphere is accurately positioned on the axis of a Fabry-Perot cavity\n(linewidth \u03ba/2\u03c0 = 57 kHz), which is almost orthogonal to the tweezer axis. The light of the tweezer\nhas an accurately controlled detuning \u2206 from a cavity resonance, and the nanosphere is placed\nin correspondence of a node of the corresponding cavity standing wave. The motion along the\ncavity axis is coupled to the cavity mode by coherent scattering [24\u201326]. This technique provides\na large optomechanical coupling, which recently allowed cooling the nanosphere oscillations down\nto phononic occupancy below unity [27\u201329]. The tweezer light scattered into the cavity mode and\ntransmitted by the end mirror is analyzed in a balanced heterodyne detection. Further details on\nthe experimental setup are given in Refs. [18, 28].\nThe linearized evolution equations for the motion in the plane orthogonal to the tweezer axis,\nexpressed in the frame rotating at the laser frequency \u03c9L, can be written as\n\u02d9\u0302ac = ( i\u2206\u2212 \u03ba\n2\n) a\u0302c + igx(b\u0302x + b\u0302 \u2020 x) + igy(b\u0302y + b\u0302 \u2020 y) + \u221a \u03ba a\u0302in (1)\n\u02d9\u0302 bj = ( \u2212i\u2126j \u2212\n\u03b3j 2\n) b\u0302j + igj(a\u0302c + a\u0302 \u2020 c) + \u221a \u0393j b\u0302n,j (2)\nwhere the operators a\u0302c and b\u0302j describe respectively the intracavity field and the two mechanical modes (j = x, y), \u03b3j are the gas damping rates, and gj are the optomechanical coupling rates. The ladder operators b\u0302j are linked to the operators describing the displacements (x\u0302, y\u0302) by the relations x\u0302 = xzpf(b\u0302x + b\u0302 \u2020 x) and y\u0302 = yzpf(b\u0302y + b\u0302 \u2020 y), where xzpf = \u221a ~/2m\u2126x and yzpf = \u221a ~/2m\u2126y are the zero-point position fluctuations of the free oscillators, and m is the mass of the nanosphere. The input noise operators are characterized by the correlation functions \u3008a\u0302in(t)a\u0302\u2020in(t\u2032)\u3009 = \u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032), \u3008a\u0302\u2020in(t)a\u0302in(t\u2032)\u3009 = 0, \u3008b\u0302 \u2020 n,j(t)b\u0302n,j(t \u2032)\u3009 = \u3008b\u0302n,j(t)b\u0302\u2020n,j(t\u2032)\u3009 = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032). The total decoherence rates \u0393j are due to collisions with the background gas molecules [30], and to the shot noise in the dipole\nscattering [31]. For both processes we are using a classical description, justified by the oscillation\nfrequencies and the operation at room temperature.\nWe note that the optomechanical coupling rates can be written as gx = gmax sin 2 \u03b8 and gy = gmax \u221a\n\u2126x \u2126y sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 [26], where \u03b8 is the angle between the cavity axis Xc and the tweezer\npolarization axis [see Fig. 1(c)]. The optomechanical coupling with the motion perpendicular to the cavity axis is null and indeed in our model this coupling is proportional to \u221d (sin \u03b8 gy/yzpf \u2212 cos \u03b8 gx/xzpf) = 0. Whenever the effective width of the mechanical resonances, increased by the optomechanical coupling, is comparable to or larger than the frequency splitting (\u2126x\u2212\u2126y), it is useful to describe the planar motion using the axis Xc and Yc (cavity frame). The motions along these directions define respectively the so-called geometrical bright and dark modes\n[32], with frequencies given respectively by\n\u21262b = sin 2 \u03b8\u21262x + cos 2 \u03b8\u21262y (3) \u21262d = cos 2 \u03b8\u21262x + sin 2 \u03b8\u21262y (4)\nand optomechanical coupling to the bright mode gb = \u221a (g2x\u2126x + g 2 y\u2126y)/\u2126b = gmax sin \u03b8 \u221a \u2126x/\u2126b. In the strong coupling regime, the spectrum of the bright mode exhibits two broad peaks cor-\nresponding to the polaritonic resonances [see Fig. 1(b)]. Since the x and y frequencies are not\ndegenerate, the bright and dark directions do not correspond to eigenstates of the total Hamilto-\nnian, therefore the spectrum of the bright mode also shows a third peak, corresponding to the third\neigenstate of the three-dimensional optomechanical system. In the cavity frame it can be ascribed\nto the coupling between bright and dark modes and, in loose terms, it is called dark mode peak.\nThe total cavity output field is given by the input-output relation a\u0302 = \u221a \u03baa\u0302c \u2212 a\u0302in. The\nheterodyne spectrum normalized to shot noise can be written as\nSout(\u2126LO + \u03c9) = 1 + \u03b7 g 2 b \u03ba |\u03c7c (\u03c9)| 2 Sxbxb (\u03c9) (5)\nwhere \u2126LO is the angular frequency of the local oscillator, and \u03b7 is the overall detection efficiency. The displacement spectrum Sxbxb of the bright mode appears, filtered by the optical susceptibility \u03c7c = [\u2212i(\u2206 + \u03c9) + (\u03ba/2)]\u22121. To recover the main system features from the measured output spectrum, we thus calculate a corrected asymmetry defined for \u03c9 > 0 as\nA (\u03c9) = Sout(\u2126LO \u2212 \u03c9) \u2212 1 Sout(\u2126LO + \u03c9) \u2212 1 (\u03c9 \u2212\u2206)2 + (\u03ba/2)2 (\u03c9 + \u2206)2 + (\u03ba/2)2 . (6)\nAccording to Eq. (5), it provides the imbalance between the negative and frequency branches of the displacement spectrum, i.e., A (\u03c9) \u2261 Sxbxb (\u2212\u03c9) /Sxbxb (\u03c9).\nFrom the system equations, we can obtain the stationary power spectrum Sxbxb , which reads\n[33]:\nSxbxb (\u03c9) = 1\ng2b 1\u2223\u22231 + \u03c7\u2212c (g2x\u03c7\u2212x + g2y\u03c7\u2212y )\u2223\u22232[ g2x\u0393x ( |\u03c7x (\u03c9)|2 + |\u03c7x (\u2212\u03c9)|2 ) + g2y\u0393y ( |\u03c7y (\u03c9)|2 + |\u03c7y (\u2212\u03c9)|2 ) +\n+ \u2223\u2223g2x\u03c7\u2212x + g2y\u03c7\u2212y \u2223\u22232 \u03ba |\u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9)|2], (7)\nwhere \u03c7\u2212c = \u03c7c (\u03c9)\u2212 \u03c7\u2217c (\u2212\u03c9), \u03c7\u2212j = \u03c7j (\u03c9)\u2212 \u03c7\u2217j (\u2212\u03c9), and \u03c7j (\u03c9) = [i(\u2126j \u2212 \u03c9) + (\u03b3j/2)] \u22121 are the mechanical susceptibilities. In Eq. (32) we can distinguish the contribution of the spectrally flat\nnoise forces quantified by the decoherence rates \u0393j , from that generated by the optical vacuum noise, filtered by the cavity and therefore proportional to \u03ba |\u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9)|2.\nThe nanosphere is levitated in high vacuum, where its dynamics is dominated by the strong\ncoupling with the cavity field and markedly non-classical effects can be unveiled. The quantum\nfeatures are highlighted in the spectral asymmetry reported in Fig. 2 for different values of the\ndetuning. The ratio between the sidebands strongly departs from the classical unit value on a broad spectral region. The maximal asymmetry occurs for frequencies around \u03c9 \u223c \u2212\u2206, where it ranges between \u223c 5 and \u223c 8, denoting a strong non-classical behavior.\nFor the interpretation of these spectral features it is instructive to start from the one-dimensional\nlimit of Eq. (32), obtained for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and therefore gy = 0, which gives the spectrum:\nSxx (\u03c9) ' \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7effm (\u03c9)\u2223\u2223\u22232 [\u0393 + \u03bag2 |\u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9)|2] (8)\nwhere, for the seek of clarity, we have set xb \u2192 x, \u0393x \u2192 \u0393, gx \u2192 g, and where \u03c7effm is the effective mechanical susceptibility, with \u2223\u2223\u03c7effm (\u2212\u03c9)\u2223\u22232 = \u2223\u2223\u03c7effm (\u03c9)\u2223\u22232. The spectral asymmetry is determined by the term proportional to |\u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9)|2, and it is particularly relevant at detuning \u2212\u2206 ' \u2126x, for large quantum cooperativity CQ = 4g2\n\u03ba\u0393 1. This is also the requirement for achieving ground\nstate cooling of the mechanical oscillator. In the weak coupling regime, \u03c7effm (\u03c9) gives a couple of Lorentzian peaks much narrower than \u03ba, centered at frequencies \u00b1\u2126eff shifted with respect to \u00b1\u2126x due to the optical spring effect. In Eq. (8) we can therefore approximate \u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9) with its values at \u2213\u2126eff , obtaining different scaling factors for the Lorentzian Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks.\nIn the strong coupling regime, the effective mechanical susceptibility gets broader and is composed of the two polaritonic peaks of width \u223c \u03ba/2 [14, 18]. The mechanical transfer function probes the noise bath on a bandwidth of the order of \u223c 2g + \u03ba/2 > \u03ba around the mechanical\nbare frequency on both the positive and negative frequency branches. In this case, the spectral\nasymmetry can be experimentally investigated over a wide range and reads:\nSxx (\u2212\u03c9) Sxx (\u03c9) = SFF (\u2212\u03c9) SFF (\u03c9) = \u0393 + \u03bag2 |\u03c7c (\u03c9)|2 \u0393 + \u03bag2 |\u03c7c (\u2212\u03c9)|2 . (9)\nThe oscillator acts as a broadband quantum spectrum analyzer of the external force, expressed in\nEq. (9) in terms of the power spectral density SFF (\u03c9) [1]. As shown in Fig. 2, thanks to the strong coupling and the high quantum cooperativity we can indeed appreciate the full shape of\nA(\u03c9), that is dictated by the optical susceptibility and, as already observed and made clear by the right hand side of Eq. (9), reaches its maximum for \u03c9 ' \u2212\u2206.\nReturning to the two-dimensional system, a particular feature of the asymmetries, well visible in Fig. 2, is a dip occuring at \u223c 119 kHz, regardless of the detuning. Here the two sidebands\nhave almost equal amplitudes and their ratio falls very close to unity. This peculiarity derives\nfrom the presence of the two mechanical susceptibilities in the full system model. The pre-factor g2y\u03c7 \u2212 y + g 2 x\u03c7 \u2212 x in the last term of Eq. (32) describes the superposition of the linear responses of the two bare oscillators to the common mode optical radiation pressure force. The two susceptibilities\nare weighted with their respective coupling rates. In the spectral region between the mechanical\nfrequencies, the two oscillators react to the fluctuating optical force with opposite phase, leading\nto a destructive interference effect. Remarkably, here the quantum back action is inhibited from\nentering the mechanical system. With high mechanical quality oscillators, the asymmetry falls to \u223c 1 because of the mechanical coupling to the flat, classical noise forces that here dominate. We\nnote that the antiresonance frequency matches the bare geometrical dark mode frequency \u2126d. The expected width of the dip is weakly dependent on the detuning, but it is sensitive to the balance between the two optomechanical coupling rates, achieving its maximum for gx ' gy. In the spectra shown in Fig. 2 the polarization angle \u03b8 fluctuates due to slow drifts in the fiber, and this explains\nthe observed (and well fitted by the model) variations of the dip width.\nThe interference dip provides the clearest experimental signature of the quantum behavior of\nthe optomechanical system: since it appears on the spectral asymmetry we can rule out classical\neffects, and it is very weakly sensitive to uncertainties in the calibration and correction of the\nspectra for cavity filtering (the depth of the minimum can indeed be used as a check for their\naccuracy).\nWe further analyze the broadband, cavity mediated back action noise in the experimental configuration with optimal detuning \u2206/2\u03c0 = \u2212130 kHz and gx ' gy (i.e., \u03b8 ' \u03c0/4). The Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands, converted to displacement spectrum according to Eq. (5), are shown in\nFig. 3(b) with the corresponding fitting functions. In the previous configuration, Stokes and anti-\nStokes sidebands had similar shapes [see Fig. 3(a)], and the dip in the asymmetry was produced\nby a different balance between the amplitude of the dark mode peak (which, dominated by thermal\nnoise, is similar in the two sidebands) and those of the polaritonic peaks (which, dominated by\nquantum noise, are much larger in the Stokes sideband). Here, on the contrary, the two spectra\nhave markedly different patterns, with the Stokes one showing a dip in the region of the dark mode\nresonance. This further, peculiar effect is obtained thanks to the strong two-dimensional cooling\n[33].\nThe quantum noise cancellation is here effective on a broad frequency range, allowing a deeper\nanalysis. While the classical flat noise gives the same spectral contribution on the two sidebands,\nthe back action noise is highly suppressed in the anti-Stokes branch, because of the strong cavity filtering, with |\u03c7c (\u2206) /\u03c7c (\u2212\u2206)|2 \u223c 0.01. The difference between the negative and positive branches of the heterodyne spectrum, corrected for the cavity filtering, provides the contribution to the\nmotional spectrum originated by the cavity quantum back action noise. We plot it with a light red\nline in Fig. 3(b) and compare it with the model (solid dark line). We see that the quantum force\nexceeds the classical noise on a wide spectral range around the polaritonic resonance frequencies,\ndisplayed by the two external red dots in Fig. 3(c). On the other hand, close to the dark mode\neigenfrequency [central red dot in Fig. 3(c)], the optical quantum noise is highly suppressed and\njust the residual classical noise drives the motion. The cancellation of the back action noise had\nalready been explored for optomechanical systems with classical laser noise [19], but we remark that\nhere we can show the inhibition of the quantum back action, generated by vacuum fluctuations,\nthanks to an oscillator very close to its ground state.\nThe solid curve in Fig. 3(d) reports the frequency dependence of the interference term I =\u2223\u2223g2x\u03c7\u2212x + g2y\u03c7\u2212y \u2223\u22232. The antiresonance occurs at the bare geometrical dark mode frequency, which differs from the corresponding eigenfrequency because of the non-degeneracy of the x and y modes [32]. Starting from \u223c 1 at \u2126d, the asymmetry grows and reaches its maximum around the polaritonic eigenfrequencies [Fig.3(c)] .\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that, in the quantum-coherent strong coupling regime, a me-\nchanical oscillator acts as a spectrum analyzer of the intracavity field quantum fluctuations over\na wide frequency range. We also show that, owing to the two-dimensional motion, the quantum\nback-action generated by vacuum field fluctuations is cancelled in a narrow spectral region due to\ndestructive interference between the two bare mechanical resonances, with meaningful implications\nin quantum-limited sensing of weak forces [34].\n[1] A.
