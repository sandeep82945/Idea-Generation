1. **Investigate the potential of astaxanthin to enhance the efficacy of antiviral drugs:** 
Explore whether astaxanthin can improve the effectiveness of existing antiviral drugs by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby enhancing the immune response and reducing viral replication.


2. **Develop novel astaxanthin delivery systems to improve bioavailability:** 
Design and evaluate new delivery systems, such as nanocarriers or encapsulation techniques, to enhance the bioavailability and targeted delivery of astaxanthin, potentially increasing its therapeutic effects.


3. **Study the long-term effects of astaxanthin supplementation on immune function and disease prevention:** 
Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the impact of long-term astaxanthin supplementation on immune function, inflammation, and the incidence of various diseases, including viral infections, chronic inflammatory conditions, and age-related disorders.


4. **Investigate the role of astaxanthin in modulating the gut microbiome and its implications for immune health:** 
Explore the effects of astaxanthin on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, and evaluate how these changes influence immune responses, inflammation, and susceptibility to infectious diseases.


5. **Evaluate the potential of astaxanthin as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19:** 
Conduct clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of astaxanthin as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19, examining its ability to reduce inflammation, improve respiratory function, and accelerate recovery.
