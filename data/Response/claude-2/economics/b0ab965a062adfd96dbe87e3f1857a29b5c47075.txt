 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct detailed case studies on countries that are outliers in the WEF Nexus Index vs HDI plot (e.g. Botswana, Namibia, Niger) to understand the specific policies and conditions that lead to their positioning. This can inform policies for other countries to improve their indices. 

2. Develop sub-national level WEF Nexus Indices to capture local variations and dynamics within countries. This can lead to more targeted, context-specific interventions.

3. Incorporate political, social and cultural factors into the WEF Nexus Index to make it more comprehensive. This could be done through surveys or qualitative methods. 

4. Analyze the impact of specific development interventions (e.g. irrigation projects, renewable energy programs) on the WEF Nexus Index over time to quantify their effectiveness. 

5. Conduct research on optimal weighting of the different WEF Nexus Index components for different country contexts. This can improve its relevance for policymaking in specific countries.
