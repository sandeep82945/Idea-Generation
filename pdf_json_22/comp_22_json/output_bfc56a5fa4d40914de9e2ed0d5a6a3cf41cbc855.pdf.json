    "abstractText": "Over the last decade, RNA-seq has produced a massive amount of plant transcriptomic sequencing data deposited in public databases. Reanalysis of these public datasets can generate additional novel hypotheses not included in original studies. However, the large data volume and the requirement for specialized computational resources and expertise present a barrier for experimental biologists to explore public repositories. Here, we introduce PlantExp (https://biotec.njau.edu.cn/plantExp), a database platform for exploration of plant gene expression and alternative splicing profiles based on 131 423 uniformly processed publicly available RNA-seq samples from 85 species in 24 plant orders. In addition to two common retrieval accesses to gene expression and alternative splicing profiles by functional terms and sequence similarity, PlantExp is equipped with four online analysis tools, including differential expression analysis, specific expression analysis, co-expression network analysis and cross-species expression conservation analysis. With these online analysis tools, users can flexibly customize sample groups to reanalyze public RNA-seq datasets and obtain new insights. Furthermore, it offers a wide range of visualization tools to help users intuitively understand analysis results. In conclusion, PlantExp provides a valuable data resource and analysis platform for plant biologists to utilize public RNA-seq. datasets. INTRODUCTION High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a routine approach to exploring gene expression in a genome-wide manner. A massive amount of plant RNAseq data across diverse tissues, developmental stages and experimental conditions are deposited in public archival repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) at NCBI (1), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) at EBI (2), the Sequence Read Archive (DRA, https://ddbj. nig.ac.jp/DRASearch) at DDBJ (3) and the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa) at the BIG Data Center (4). Retrospective analyses of large collections of RNA-seq data can lead to new biological insights (5\u20137). For example, more than 10% of RNA-seq datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are reanalyzed to generate new hypotheses regarding specific genes (8). These nucleotide archives are primarily archival repositories for storage of raw sequence reads. Without specialized computational resources and bioinformatics skills, experimental biologists cannot efficiently reuse these datasets. The utilization of public RNA-seq datasets across diverse studies requires uniform processing, which can generate comparable gene expression data to obtain meaningful analysis results. In animals, >750 000 uniformly processed RNA-seq datasets from humans and mice are used to construct gene expression database for the research community to perform secondary analysis (9). MetazExp developed by our group includes 53 615 RNA-seq datasets from 72 metazoan species and offers differential and specific expression analysis modules (10). In plants, ePlant hosts data from 1385 samples of Arabidopsis thaliana for visual exploration of the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression (11).

Here, we introduce PlantExp (https://biotec.njau.edu.cn/plantExp), a database platform for exploration of plant gene expression and alternative splicing profiles based on 131 423 uniformly processed publicly available RNA-seq samples from 85 species in 24 plant orders. In addition to two common retrieval accesses to gene expression and alternative splicing profiles by functional terms and sequence similarity, PlantExp is equipped with four online analysis tools, including differential expression analysis, specific expression analysis, co-expression network analysis and cross-species expression conservation analysis. With these online analysis tools, users can flexibly customize sample groups to reanalyze public RNA-seq datasets and obtain new insights. Furthermore, it offers a wide range of visualization tools to help users intuitively understand analysis results. In conclusion, PlantExp provides a valuable data resource and analysis platform for plant biologists to utilize public RNA-seq. datasets."

            "text": "High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a routine approach to exploring gene expression in a genome-wide manner. A massive amount of plant RNAseq data across diverse tissues, developmental stages and experimental conditions are deposited in public archival repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) at NCBI (1), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) at EBI (2), the Sequence Read Archive (DRA, https://ddbj. nig.ac.jp/DRASearch) at DDBJ (3) and the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa) at the BIG Data Center (4). Retrospective analyses of large collections of RNA-seq data can lead to new biological insights (5\u20137). For example, more than 10% of RNA-seq datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are reanalyzed to generate new hypotheses regarding specific genes (8). These nucleotide archives are primarily archival repositories for storage of raw sequence reads. Without specialized computational resources and bioinformatics skills, experimental biologists cannot efficiently reuse these datasets.\nThe utilization of public RNA-seq datasets across diverse studies requires uniform processing, which can generate comparable gene expression data to obtain meaningful analysis results. In animals, >750 000 uniformly processed RNA-seq datasets from humans and mice are used to construct gene expression database for the research community to perform secondary analysis (9). MetazExp developed by our group includes 53 615 RNA-seq datasets from 72 metazoan species and offers differential and specific expression analysis modules (10). In plants, ePlant hosts data from 1385 samples of Arabidopsis thaliana for visual exploration of the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression (11).

PPRD uniformly processed \u223c45 000 RNA-seq datasets from five important crops such as maize, rice, soybean, wheat and cotton to provide functions of gene expression retrieval and data mining (13). These plant gene expression databases are increasingly useful to investigate gene function and generate hypotheses. Alternative splicing is a universal regulation mechanism of post transcriptional gene expression in eukaryotes and plays vital roles in diverse biological procedures. Recently, PastDB was built to provide alternative splicing and gene expression quantifications of A. thaliana across tissues, developmental stages and environmental conditions (14). Other than PastDB, most plant gene expression databases do not consider alternative splicing. Furthermore, the conservation of orthologous gene expression patterns is important for the investigation of gene function. To our knowledge, no plant gene expression database so far supports cross-species gene expression conservation analysis.\nHere we present PlantExp (Figure 1), a web-based retrieval and analysis platform that builds upon 131 423 publicly available RNA-seq samples from 85 plant species across 24 orders. It has four important features. First, it includes by far the largest number of plant RNA-seq samples. Second, it coveres both gene expression and alternative splicing profiles. Third, in addition to the database query and retrieval functions, it offers the multiple online analysis functions including differential expression analysis, special expression analysis, co-expression network analysis and cross-species gene expression conservation analysis. Fourth, A rich diversity of visualization tools help users intuitively understand analysis results."

The final novel transcripts must occur in at least three RNA-seq samples and account for more than a half of experiments of any tissue or at least one-third of all experiments.\nAfter gene model refinement, for the 85 species the splice junctions and exons on average were increased by 8.47% and 16.93%, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The proportion of multi-exonic genes with alternative transcripts increased from 20.99% to 41.91% on average (Supplementary Table S1).

As expected (22), the retained intron events generally were the most abundant type in RNA-seq samples, accounting for 49.26% on average. There were 91.45% of alternative splicing events whose exon-intron structures were consistent with alternative transcripts, and 8.55% of events whose exon-intron structures were inferred from read alignments on exons. To estimate alternative splicing profiles, the PSI (percentage spliced in) values were calculated by the JCEC and JC methods (21). In the former, event counts included both reads that span junctions (Junction Counts) and reads that do not cross an exon boundary (Exon Counts). In the latter, event counts included only reads that span junctions (Junction Counts).\nIdentification of ortholog genes and alternative splicing groups\nWe identified orthologous gene groups based on the longest protein sequences of genes using orthofinder (23). Or-\ntholog alternative splicing groups indicate alternative splicing events that occur in ortholog genes with the same exonintron splicing structures. We use the following procedure to identify ortholog alternative splicing groups. First, the protein sequences in orthologous genes were aligned globally using mafft (24). Then, the alignments of protein sequences were converted to codon alignments using pal2nal (25). Finally, we calculated the new coordinates of exons in transcripts corresponding to the longest protein based on codon alignments. Alternative splicing events with the same coordinates based on codon alignments were classified into an orthologous group. In the 85 plants, we identified 62 897 ortholog gene groups. Based on these ortholog gene groups, we identified 225 441 putative ortholog alternative splicing groups."

At the top of the portal page, users can open the help and FAQ page to learn the full instructions and frequently asked questions. The body of the portal page is to introduce database contents and provide entrances to species. For each species, the data accesses can be divided into three groups. (i) The summary page provides statistics and links to download gene expression and alterna-\ntive splicing data. (ii) The search and blast page offer access points to retrieve gene expression and alternative splicing data by gene terms and sequence similarity, respectively. (iii) The comparison, specificity, co-expression and crossspecies pages provide users with access to analysis of the collected RNA-seq datasets.\nQuerying the database.

The retrieved genes are listed in an interactive table with links for users to open the gene page to show gene annotation and expression profiles (Figure 2A). Through the inner links in the gene page, users can open the transcript page to show an associated transcript\u2019s expression profiles, as well as open the splicing page to show an associated alternative splicing event\u2019s profiles. Furthermore, by the inner links in the transcript or splicing page, users can open an interaction page to show the effect of an alternative splicing event on an associated transcript. The access relationships among the gene, transcript, splicing and interaction page are shown in Figure 2B.\nThe gene, transcript and splicing pages have similar page layout. First, the genomic position and relevant annotation are listed at the top (Figure 2C). Through the links binding with annotation terms, users can quickly jump to external databases, such as the Pfam, KEGG, AmiGO and miRbase (37) database. Most remarkably, users can explore ortholog gene expression and alternative splicing profiles in other species by the ortholog group link. The following section is a genome browser for users to explore gene, transcript and alternative splicing structure in their genomic context\n(Figure 2D). Then, for the gene page, there are two tables showing its associated transcripts and alternative splicing events. For the transcript page (or the splicing page), there is a table listing its associated alternative splicing events (or transcripts). Finally, a drop-down box is employed to list all collected studies and an interactive and hierarchical bar chart is used to show the expression or splicing profiles in a chosen study (Figure 2E). In addition, the effect of alternative splicing on a transcript, such as impact of protein domain and targets of microRNAs, can be visually shown in the interaction page (Figure 2F).\nOnline analysis. PlantExp is equipped with four online analysis tools to assist users to analyse RNA-seq datasets collected in the database (see details in Materials and Methods). The four task submission pages has similar layout. First, the current status of the analysis server is shown at the top of four task submission pages including the numbers of running and waiting tasks. The following section is a sample retrieval box. In this box, users can only load samples of interests by setting query conditions, such as RNA-seq layout, read length, data volume and data source. The retrieved samples with the information of cultivar, genotype,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/D 1/D 1483/6769746 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\ntissue and so on, are presented in an interactive table. According to sample information, users can flexibly set sample groups for an analysis task. The next is an area for users to set analysis methods and parameters. Finally, at the bottom users assign job name to an analysis task and provide an email to receive notifications and results.\nFor a differential or specific expression analysis task, the result page first provides a heatmap (Figure 3A) and principal component analysis (PCA) graph (Figure 3B) to illustrate sample clustering based on overall gene expression and splicing profiles. Then, the differentially and specifically expressed/spliced genes are listed in interactive tables. In addition to gene information, expression/splicing change values and significance levels, the tables provide links for users to further open new pages showing gene details and expression/splicing profiles in selected samples. Finally, bar charts are presented to exhibit GO and pathway enrichment analysis on differentially and specifically expressed/spliced genes.\nFor a co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis task, the result page provides diverse graphs or tables to display analysis results. First, a dendrogram exhibits the clustering relationships of samples based on overall gene expression profiles. According the dendrogram, users can detect whether outlier samples exist. The identified gene coexpression modules (networks) are listed in an interactive table with links for users to open new pages showing function enrichment bar charts and visual networks. To help users understand the co-expressed genes, PlantExp generates a dendrogram of gene clustered using dissimilarity measure based on topological overlap matrix (Figure 3C). Finally, a heatmap is used to characterize relationships between sample groups and gene co-expression modules (Figure 3D).\nFor cross-species expression conservation analysis, users can customize sample groups with similar attributes in any specified two species to explore gene expression conservation. In the returned result page, an interactive table is used to list the consistency of ortholog gene expression intra- and inter-species. By clicking on the link icons in the table, users can open a new page to view diagram of curves representing gene expression profiles covering multiple sample groups, and an evolutionary tree exhibiting molecular phylogenetic relationships based on ortholog protein sequences (Figure 3E). The 1:1 ortholog groups are more conserved because of the importance for exploration of species phylogeny. PlantExp presents a table showing 1:1 ortholog genes differentially expressed in all two-group comparisons. Furthermore, scatter plots are used to show gene expression ratios of 1:1 ortholog gene pairs (Figure 3F)."

            "text": "stress. To illustrate the power of PlantExp, we present here a case study to explore alternative splicing induced by cold stress in rice. Two different rice cultivars, Thaibonnet and Volano, are respectively sensitive and tolerant to cold stress, and the gene expression level changes at 0, 2 and 10 h at 10\u25e6C cold stress have been explored (PRJEB22031) (38). After running comparative analysis of selected SRA samples representing these conditions, we retrieved the result page of the analysis. From the heatmaps, the samples in four com-\nparisons (Thaibonnet 2 h/0 h and 10 h/0 h; Volano 2 h/0 h and 10 h/0 h) were well clustered into control and treatment groups based on both gene expression levels (Supplemental Figure S1A) and alternative splicing profiles (Supplemental Figure S1B). This implied that both overall gene expression and alternative splicing profiles were altered by cold stress.\nMATS LRT with default parameters was used to detect gene differentially splicing. A total of 4713 differentially alternative splicing (DAS) events were identified after cold stress in the two rice cultivars (Figure 4B). In the identified DAS events, the retained intron was the most abundant alternative splicing type, accounting for 61.3% (Figure 4A). After 2 h of cold stress, there were a total of 2236 DAS events detected in two cultivars, in which 393 DAS specifically occurred in the sensitive cultivar Thaibonnet and 831 DAS specifically occurred in the tolerant cultivar Volano. After 10 h cold stress, the DAS events were almost increased to twice, reaching 4234. There were respectively 1147 and 891 DAS events specifically occurring in the Thaibonnet and Volano cultivar. In addition, The GO and pathway enrichment analysis revealed functional commonalities as well as differences in the differentially spliced genes of the two cultivars after 2 and 10 h cold stress (Figure 4C). These findings about alternative splicing, not reported by the original study (38) that generated the RNA-Seq data, may generate new testable hypotheses regarding genes involved in cold stress of rice."
