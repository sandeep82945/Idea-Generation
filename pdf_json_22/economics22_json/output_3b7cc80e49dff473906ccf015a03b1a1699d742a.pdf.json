            "text": "Utilitarianism is the most prominent social welfare function in welfare economics and economic policy.1 Tools to aggregate costs, benefits, and tradeoffs within large and heterogeneous populations are especially important for major public choices such as climate policy. Leading economic analyses of climate policy most often rely on a discounted variant of utilitarianism (Stern, 2006; Nordhaus, 2017). The 2015 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report recognized that evaluating climate policy necessitates the theoretical challenges of both social risk and endogenous population: climate policies and other economic policies impact both the distribution of wellbeing and the chances that future people exist.\nSo additively separable social evaluation \u2014 a key feature of generalized utilitarianism (Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson, 2005, p. 95) \u2014 is at once a core tool of public economics and an enduring focus of debate in welfare economics. In the prior literature, there are two major axiomatic paths to characterizing utilitarianism, each with known criticisms. One, in risky settings, begins with respecting ex ante Pareto improvements for individuals (Harsanyi, 1955), but this is criticized by egalitarians and others for ignoring the distribution of utility (e.g. Fleurbaey, 2010). Another, in variable-population settings, begins with independence of the existence of unaffected lives (Blackorby and Donaldson, 1984; Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson, 1995), but this too is criticized in the population literature. We identify a new path to\n1For example, the widely-used sufficient statistics method of Chetty (2009) and the optimal income tax problem of Mirrlees (1971) both assume a utilitarian social criterion. In some economic experiments, utilitarian allocations receive substantial (although not universal) support Jackson and Yariv (2014).\nutilitarianism, by studying risky, variable-population social settings, where the number and lifetime utilities of possible people vary across probabilistic states. We clarify the additional properties of utilitarianism in our more general setting.\nWe present three new characterizations of Expected Critical-Level Generalized Utilitarianism (ECLGU) for evaluation of variable-population risky social prospects. To do this, we introduce novel axioms about the combination of risk and variable population. For example, we propose an axiom that the probability of a person existing and that person\u2019s utility-conditional-on-existence are complements, so it is better to allocate higher chances of existence to lives that would have more wellbeing. This axiom allows us to characterize generalized utilitarianism without directly assuming either ex ante Pareto or independence of the existence of unaffected lives, which are the classic axioms for additive separability when either risk or population, respectively, are considered in isolation (Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson, 1998, 2005). Of course, both of these principles are entailed by ECLGU but they need not be the founding principle of utilitarianism. Our other axioms allow other novel characterizations.\nThe ECLGU family is an important set of social welfare functions that includes leading candidates in the population ethics literature. In particular, classical total utilitarianism is a special case of ECLGU. Because ECLGU allows utilities to be transformed before they are aggregated, it also permits sensitivity to the distribution of utility: a concave transformation yields social evaluation that prefers an equal distribution with the same total utility. We emphasize that such transformation may be, but need not be, individuals\u2019 own\nvon Neumann Morgenstern transformations for risky choice. Such generality is a benefit of our avoidance of an explicit axiom respecting individuals\u2019 ex ante Pareto improvements in expected utility.\nBecause ECLGU offers an approach to giving priority to lower-utility individuals while retaining additive separability, we contrast ECLGU with a leading alternative approach to inequality: the expected equally-distributed equivalent (EEDE), described by Fleurbaey (2010).2 Because EEDE, as we make it precise, cares about the pattern of inequality across persons, whether to add additional people depends, in part, on their consequences for inequality.\nIn the next section, we present examples where ECLGU and EEDE disagree or notably agree, in order to motivate our novel axioms. Subsequently, we present our three characterizations. The first theorem uses a new axiom that is sufficient to characterize ECLGU in the presence of a set of uncontroversial basic principles that are used throughout the population economics literature. This axiom requires complementarity between the probability of a person existing and utility-conditional-on-existence. We thus provide an axiomatization of utilitarianism that relies neither on ex ante Pareto, nor on independence of the existence of unaffected lives, which is an alternative to the existing literature.\nWe then explore other axiomatizations of ECLGU in our setting. We show that independence of the existence of unaffected lives and (a variant of) ex ante Pareto have to be supplemented with other properties. Our second characterization adds to the basic principles two axioms that make use of\n2Many of Fleurbaey\u2019s results are general enough to include non-egalitarian approaches such as classical utilitarianism and other families; we focus on a particular subset, detailed below, that is separable in same-number, risk-free cases but not otherwise.\nboth social risk and variable population, namely Existence independence of sure lives and Social risk neutrality in population size. This characterization is important in part because risk-neutrality in the size of perfectly equal populations is an axiom that would be widely accepted among competing approaches to population ethics, including the EEDE approach. Moreover, independence of risk-free individuals has been noted in the prior literature to be attractive in fixed-population evaluations of social risk and inequality, even to egalitarians (cf. Fleurbaey, 2018).\nOur third theorem is most conceptually similar to prior characterizations, particularly the Harsanyi approach. It uses an \u201cIndividual dominance\u201d axiom that respects social risk preferences over single-person populations. This permits us to characterize ECLGU in a way that generalizes and weakens ex ante Pareto beyond expected utility and even beyond individuals\u2019 von Neumann-Morgenstern transformations. Again, this axiom has to be supplemented with other properties to obtain ECLGU. With Theorem 2 and 3, we thus improve our understanding of the normative underpinning of the ECLGU family.\nWe view our contribution both as providing three new avenues for any reader to understand ECLGU and as providing new arguments in favor of ECLGU for readers who find our axioms compelling. This is significant because this family of social welfare functions is of leading practical importance in public economics and contemporary empirical policy analysis. Despite this importance, theorists recognize that prior characterizations have been subject to important criticisms. Theorem 1 provides a new approach that avoids using these controversial axioms. Together with Theorems 2 and 3, these\nnew characterizations offer a better understanding of leading tools for social evaluation that are additively separable, that allow us to evaluate populations of different size, and that allow either utilitarian aggregation or transformed aggregation that is sensitive to inequality in utility."

            "text": "Harsanyi (1955) and Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1995) have influentially characterized utilitarianism. Here, we provide three more characterizations. These are of course equivalent to one another and to others in the literature. Our further characterizations advance the literature because they clarify what is fundamental to expected utilitarianism; because they highlight new, potentially unintuitive consequences of rejecting expected utilitarianism; and because, in different ways and to different degrees, they sidestep familiar debates in social risk or population ethics.\nThe examples in this section provide motivating intuition for our new axioms. We focus in this section on the motivation for our Theorems 1 and 2. These examples distinguish expected critical-level generalized utilitarianism (ECLGU), as proposed by Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1998), from expected equally-distributed-equivalent (EEDE) criteria, as proposed by Fleurbaey (2010).\nOur paper considers the social evaluation of objective-probability lotteries over states, each of which yields a population welfare outcome, which specifies how many people exist and the lifetime utilities of each. We define ECLGU\nas the expectation of a value function \u2211\ni\n[ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] where ui is the utility\nof individual i existing in a particular population, g is increasing, and c is a critical level of utility. We define EEDE as the expectation of a value function\nna \u00d7 [ g\u22121 ( 1 n \u2211 i g(ui) ) \u2212 c ] for any fixed a \u2208 [0, 1] and c \u2208 R, where n is the number of people who exist.3 Both ECLGU and EEDE are sensitive to unequal distribution if g is concave, but ECLGU is additively separable in all cases. EEDE is additively separable only in same-population, risk-free cases.4\nIn these examples, rows are individual people (or potential people) and columns are risky social states. Numbers are lifetime utilities. Let \u2217 denote a person not existing in a state. We use %E for EEDE. We use %U for ECLGU. Example 1, previously discussed by Fleurbaey (2010) and Broome (2015), illustrates why EEDE rejects separability across persons in risky cases.\nExample 1 (EEDE rejects separability) Assume that social states are equally likely. Then:\nu\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 1 0  E v\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 0 1 , but u \u223cU v.\nThis is a fixed-population example. These utilities summarize everything 3Although Fleurbaey proposed EEDE in a fixed-population context, for the purposes of comparison with ECLGU we expand it to variable populations with the na term, which permits averageist (a = 0), totalist (a = 1), or variable-value special cases. Parameter c is known in the literature as a critical-level parameter. Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (2005) argued in favor of critical-level utilitarianism with positive critical-level. Because all of our Examples that differentiate ECLGU and EEDE use same-population-size pairwise comparisons, they hold for any a and c. For formal definitions of the criteria, see Definitions 2 and 1.\n4Fleurbaey\u2019s (2010) approach is more general and is also compatible with other nonadditive social criteria. Fleurbaey also considers non-continuous social orderings.\nrelevant about lifetime wellbeing, including any experience of inequality. Both people have an equal chance of receiving 1 or 0; so, if individual risk profiles are separable across people (so correlated risks do not matter), then u and v must be equally good. For the top person, the mapping of states to outcomes is the same in v as in u. The bottom person faces the same individual prospect in v as in u. But v will certainly have an unequal outcome, whichever state turns out to realize, and u will certainly have an equal outcome. EEDE favors ex-post egalitarian outcomes and so rejects separability across persons and prefers u over v. ECLGU is indifferent. In the rest of this section, we extend this mechanism to new examples, to further distinguish these two criteria in a risky, variable population setting."

ECLGU holds that it is better if the people who are more likely to exist are also the people who would have better lives, if they existed. In contrast, because EEDE cares about distributional properties, whether EEDE prefers to increase the probability that a person will exist also depend on the chances for inequality among other possible people. Strikingly, EEDE can therefore prefer to \u201clevel down\u201d probabilistic people and reject the complementarity of wellbeing and the chances of existence.\nExample 2 (Leveling down for probabilistic people) Assume that all\nthree states are equally probable.

The people in the bottom two rows are unaffected by the choice.\nThe decision between w and z allocates the bolded utilities-conditional-onexistence of 2 and 1 between the top two people in the middle state. Under ECLGU, w U z, because the higher utility level is then more likely to exist. But under EEDE, w \u227aE z because ex post inequality always happens in w but never happens in z. Choosing z would be a form of leveling down to avoid inequality. In section 4, we characterize ECLGU with the principle behind Example 2."

            "text": "neutrality in population size\nOne well-studied path towards ECLGU in risk-free variable population settings is an existence independence property (Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson, 2005). Such a property holds that social evaluations should not depend on the\nexistence of unaffected people, such as the long dead or those in the distant future. EEDE does not typically satisfy such a property. This is because, in a variable-population setting, adding an extra person has two consequences to an EEDE evaluation: the person\u2019s own utility matters and the extra person may change distributional properties, such as inequality. To ECLGU, such distributional effects are irrelevant. But to EEDE, adding a sure person (or learning, for example, that a sure person existed in the past) can reverse a choice. Example 3 shows this by expanding Example 1:\nExample 3 (EEDE rejects Existence independence of sure lives) Assume that social states have equal probability and that g(u) = \u2212e\u22122u. Then:\nx\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 0.5 1 0 0.5  E y\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 0.9 0 1 0.9  . x\u2032\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 0.5 1 0 0.5\n0 0 0\n \u227aE y\u2032\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1 0 0.9 0 1 0.9\n0 0 0  . Notice that, under EEDE, x has the advantage of ex post equality, but y has the advantage of 0.9 being a better lifetime utility for one possible person than 0.5. Under some quantitative parameterizations, x is preferred. But adding the sure person in x\u2032 changes this advantage, as ex-post inequality appears, so y\u2032 is preferred. Such a preference reversal violates existence independence. To ECLGU, y U x and y\u2032 U x\u2032 because only the fact that 0.9 > 0.5 matters.\nIn section 5, we present a characterization of ECLGU that builds upon an axiom that rules out choosing the way EEDE does in Example 3. However, we also show that Existence independence is not sufficient for ECLGU. This is because criteria that maximize the expectation of the multiplicative value\nfunction \u220f\ni g(ui) also satisfy Existence independence.\nIn section 5, we therefore use an additional property: Social risk neutrality in population size for perfectly equal populations. This principle holds that\u2014in the hypothetical case of no risk or inequality in utility-conditionalon-existence\u2014social evaluation is risk neutral in the number of people who live. Example 4 illustrates this property:\nExample 4 (Social risk neutrality in population size) Assume that social states are equally likely. Then: 1 1 \u2217 1\n\u2217 1\n \u223c  1 1 1 1\n\u2217 \u2217\n ,\nboth for ECLGU and for EEDE with a = 0 or a = 1.\nSuch risk neutrality will be an implication of any approach that maximizes the expectation of an additive social welfare function. Importantly, however, social risk neutrality in population size is also a property of some EEDE criteria, of expected average utilitarianism, and broadly of other non-separable approaches in the population literature. What singles out ECLGU in the context of our basic axioms, Theorem 2 shows, is the combination of Existence independence of sure lives and Social risk neutrality in population size.\nTo a reader who agrees with EEDE\u2019s egalitarian evaluations in Examples 2 and 3, our paper provides new arguments against generalized utilitarianism. Alternatively, to a reader who agrees with generalized utilitarianism\u2019s evaluations in these cases, our paper shows that, in the context of some widely accepted basic axioms, these principles are sufficient to characterize ECLGU. Either way, these examples clarify the foundations of utilitarianism for economic policy analysis in the real-world case of both social risk and variable population."

The set of non-negative (resp. positive) real numbers is denoted by R+ (R++).\nThe set of possible individuals is N. N is the set of all possible non-empty finite subsets of N, which are possible populations with typical element N . We consider a welfarist framework where the only information necessary for social decisions is the utility levels of people alive in a certain state of affairs.5\n5Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1998) explicitly state Welfarism as an axiom. Here, to simplify the analysis, we only implicitly make the assumption in order to avoid introducing states of affairs, lotteries over states of affairs, and the corresponding welfarist information. But we could as well use the framework of Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1998). Welfarism itself is often derived from more basic principles, typically Pareto indifference and Anonymity. See Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1999, 2005) for an example in a variable-population framework assuming a multi-profile setting; and Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (2006) in a fixed-population framework assuming a single profile of utility. Note that we exclude empty populations where nobody exists for the sake of simplicity: we could account for them by setting the value of empty populations to zero.\nA population\u2019s welfare information is given by u = (ui)i\u2208N \u2208 RN where N \u2208 N is the population, and ui is for each existing individual i the lifetime utility experienced by i. It is common in the population ethics literature to assume that a life with positive utility is worth living, while a life with negative wellbeing is not. We need not make this interpretation here given that ECLGU can use any critical level.\nThe set of all possible alternatives is U = \u22c3 N\u2208N RN . For each u \u2208 U , we denote N(u) the set of individuals alive in u, and n(u) the number of individuals alive in u. For an individual i \u2208 N, we let Ui be the set of alternatives where i exists. Formally, Ui = {u \u2208 U |i \u2208 N(u)}. For each population N \u2208 N , UN = {u \u2208 U |N(u) = N} is the set of alternatives such that the population is N . For two alternatives u and v \u2208 U such that N(u) \u2229 N(v) = \u2205, we denote uv the alternative w such that N(w) = N(u)\u222aN(v), wi = ui for all i \u2208 N(u) and wj = uj for all j \u2208 N(v). Similarly, we use uvw when we \u201cmerge\u201d three alternatives such that N(u) \u2229 N(v) = N(u) \u2229N(w) = N(v) \u2229N(w) = \u2205.\nWe consider risk over social states of affairs. We do so by introducing lotteries over U . Because U specifies both who exists and their lifetime utilities, such lotteries capture uncertainty over existence, over risk experienced within a lifetime, and over allocation within populations. A lottery p over U is a mapping p : U \u2192 [0, 1] such that there exists a finite set V \u2282 U such that\u2211 v\u2208V p(v) = 1, p(v) > 0 for all v \u2208 V and p(u) = 0 for all u \u2208 (U \\ V ). We denote P the set of all such lotteries. For simplicity, we abuse notation and denote u the degenerate lottery such that alternative u \u2208 U occurs with\nprobability 1 (so that all other alternatives have probability 0).6 For any p \u2208 P , we denote supp(p) = {u \u2208 U : p(u) > 0}, that is, the support of p.\nFor any population N \u2208 N , we denote PN the set of lotteries concerning only population N : that is, p \u2208 PN if for each u \u2208 supp(p) it is the case that u \u2208 UN . Such same-population lotteries have attracted attention in the discussion about whether we should use an additively separable von Neumann-Morgenstern function in a risky context as suggested by Harsanyi (1955).\nLast we introduce two concepts related to the situation individuals face in a lottery. The first concept is that of the probability that an individual i exists with lottery p, that we denote \u03c0i(p). Formally, for any p \u2208 P and any\nindividual i, \u03c0i(p) = \u2211\nu\u2208Ui p(u). The second concept is the individual lottery\nfaced by an individual who is sure to exist that we denote pi. Formally, for any i \u2208 N and any p \u2208 P such that \u03c0i(p) = 1, pi is the lottery on R defined\nas follows: for any x \u2208 R, pi(x) = \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)|ui=x p(u). To lighten notation,\nwe further denote pi the lottery in P such that pi(v) = 0 for all v \u2208 U such that N(v) 6= {i}, and, for each u \u2208 U with N(u) = {i}, pi(u) = pi(x) where x = ui \u2208 R. So, pi is also the social lottery where only individual i exists and faces the individual lottery pi. So the ranking pi % p\u2032i is well-defined and represents a \u201csocial assessment\u201d of individual lotteries (see Axiom IDom below).\nNote that our framework combines risk in two ways: on who exists and on the utility of the existing persons. Concretely, what we have in mind are situations where people may be born or not (because fertility patterns change\n6Hence, we implicitly assume the property of Social certainty consistency by Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (1998).\nfor instance) and then face risks during their lifetimes that affect their overall lifetime utilities.7 Note also that we do not use any explicit time structure in our setting. Our risky variable population framework can be applied naturally to intertemporal issues (for instance, our current actions may change who exist in the future). In that case\u2014which is our preferred interpretation\u2014we assume that a population comprises everyone who ever exists in the world, like in Blackorby, Bossert and Donaldson (2005). In this interpretation, time would not play any significant role in welfare evaluation: one of our basic axioms is Anonymity, ruling out discounting or any other discrimination on the basis of time.\nWe investigate a social welfare ordering % over P (because we assume Social expected-utility throughout, we will assume that % is a complete and transitive ordering). We denote the asymmetric part and \u223c the symmetric part of %."

The next axiom is our first variable-population axiom. It assumes a minimal degree of comparability across population sizes and rules out an implausible social evaluation that would always regard an additional person as an improvement or as a worsening, irrespective of the utility level.9 the recent literature have furthered Harsanyi\u2019s theorem by weakening Social expected-utility (Fleurbaey, 2009; Mongin and Pivato, 2015; Zuber, 2016; McCarthy, Mikkola and Thomas, 2020).\n9In the context of Pareto and continuity in a complete and transitive ordering, Minimal existence of a critical level would follow immediately from the apparently weaker assumption that there are c\u0304, c \u2208 R such that if v\u0304i = c\u0304, vi = c, and definitions are otherwise as in the axiom, then v\u0304 \u2280 u and v u.

We may want to strengthen the axiom by allowing individuals to have different (sure) utility levels conditional on existence. Such a property would not be compatible with EEDE. Assuming that we are indifferent to risk on population given that individuals have sure utility levels conditional on existence and a given probability of existing would imply Property 1 in Appendix A.1: this is sufficient together with our basic axioms to characterize ECLGU without assuming Ind-I.\n17More precisely, they explore a principle that denies it, which they call Preference for Catastrophe Avoidance.

The next proposition precisely describes the scope of all social orderings that satisfies RiskNeu and our basic principles.\nProposition 3 If a social welfare ordering % on P satisfies the Basic Principles and RiskNeu, then there exist two continuous functions \u03a8 : R \u2192 R and \u03a6 : R\u2192 R, and for each n \u2208 N a continuous, increasing, symmetric and normalized function \u039en, such that, for all p, p \u2032 \u2208 P :\np % p\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)\np(u)\u00d7 [ \u03a6 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) + n(u)\u00d7\u03a8 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) ] \u2265\n\u2211 u\u2208supp(p\u2032) p\u2032(u)\u00d7 [ \u03a6 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) + n(u)\u00d7\u03a8 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) ] .\nProof.

Theirs is the first use of this axiom of which we are aware, although they cite a related principle by Keeney (1980) about risk aversion over quantity of deaths. Although Bommier and Zuber are motivated by the risk of human extinction, we note that this possibility would be represented by a positive population size in our framework (not zero), because some human lives have already been lived.\n18In particular, it is satisfied by every social criterion that maximizes an expectation of a function of the form V (u) = \u039en(u) or V (u) = n ( \u039en(u) \u2212 c ) , with \u039e a normalized function like in Proposition 1. This means that it is accepted by average and total versions of utilitarianism and EEDE (each with or without positive critical levels) as well as by maximin. RiskNeu is however rejected by \u201cvariable value\u201d approaches to population ethics, which include Rank-Dependent Generalized Utilitarianism (Asheim and Zuber, 2014) and Number-Dampened Generalized Utilitarianism (Ng, 1989), but both of these are already excluded by Ind-a.\nECLGU:\nTheorem 2 A social welfare ordering % on P satisfies the Basic Principles, Ind-l, and RiskNeu if and only if it is an ECLGU social welfare ordering.\nProof. In the Appendix.\nEEDE with a = 1 or a = 0 satisfies RiskNeu. They also satisfy a weak form of separability (weaker than Ind-a) in same-number risk-free cases. Theorem 2 implies that the axiomatic gap between ECLGU and this form of EEDE is that ECLGU satisfies independence in risky cases but EEDE does so only for sure alternatives.\n6 Ex ante Pareto: a generalization\nAs noted in the introduction, a leading path to obtaining (critical-level) utilitarianism is to use the Ex ante Pareto principle. Expected utilitarianism satisfies Ex ante Pareto: Ex ante Pareto. For all N \u2208 N , for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 PN , if \u2211\nu\u2208U pi(ui) \u00d7 ui \u2265\u2211 u\u2208U p \u2032 i(ui) \u00d7 ui for all i \u2208 N , then p % p\u2032. If the inequality is strict for at least one i \u2208 N then p p\u2032.\nClearly, EEDE with concave g rejects Ex ante Pareto (to see this, add a small amount of utility to each outcome in v in Example 1). But ECLGU also rejects Pareto when g is concave because g plays a role of increasing risk aversion with respect to lifetime utility. We can however provide the following generalization of Ex ante Pareto:\nIndividual dominance (IDom). For all N \u2208 N , for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 PN , if\npi p\u2032i for all i \u2208 N , then p p\u2032.\nIDom only uses social preferences and does not make any reference to individual attitudes under risk and uncertainty.19 In particular, it allows lifetime utilities to be measured by utility functions different individuals\u2019 von Neumann Morgenstern (VNM) utility functions (whereas Ex ante Pareto makes sense only if individual preferences satisfy the VNM axioms and lifetime utilities are measured by VNM utilities).20"

The Anteriority and Reduction to Prospects axioms are key to their proof that the social preorder is generated by the individual preorder. The main difference in terms of interpretation is that we do not have individual preorders but only a social ordering of individual prospects: that is social distributions where only one individual exists. We do not say anything about individual attitudes towards risk.\n20See related arguments by McCarthy (2017).

In the Appendix.\nENWGU social orderings satisfy IDom as well as Strong Pareto, Anonymity, Continuity and Social expected-utility. For the the statement of Proposition 4 to an if and only statement, we would need to focus on ENWGU social orderings satisfying Minimal existence of a critical level. This corresponds to the following restriction on functions F , G and g: there exists n \u2208 N, and a, b \u2208 R, such that F (n)\u2212F (n+1) F (n+1) ng(a) + G(n)\u2212G(n+1) F (n+1) = g(b).\nNotice also that both expected total utilitarianism (F and G constant) and average utilitarianism (F (n) = cn\u22121, where c \u2208 R++, and G constant) are special cases of ENWGU. In fact, because F is positive-valued, the subfamily of ENGWU where G is restricted to be constant is named in the literature. Blackorby, et al. (2005, p. 172) define Number-Dampened Generalized Utilitarianism (NDGU), in a risk-free setting, as the social ordering represented\nby F ( n(u) )\u2211 i\u2208N(u) g(ui), with F : N\u2192 R++. So, Expected NDGU (ENDGU, defined as the combination of NDGU and Social expected-utility) is the special case of ENWGU with G restricted to be constant. That restriction has been\nstudied in Fleurbaey and Zuber (2015), and is achieved in their paper by the following axiom:\nEgalitarian expansion principle. There exists a non-negative lifetime util-\nity level a \u2208 R+ such that, for all alternatives u, u\u2032 \u2208 U such that N(u) = N(u\u2032) \u222a {i} for i /\u2208 N(u\u2032), uj = u\u2032j = a for all j \u2208 N(u\u2032), and ui = b, u % u\u2032 whenever b \u2265 a, while u \u227a u\u2032 whenever b < a.\nThe Egalitarian expansion principle implies that function F (n)n must be non-decreasing and g(a) = 0 for the a in the Egalitarian expansion principle. The proof of the following remark is similar to the beginning of the proof of Proposition 2 in Fleurbaey and Zuber (2015).\nRemark 1 If a social welfare ordering % on P satisfies the Basic Principles, IDom, and the Egalitarian expansion principle, then it is an ENDGU social ordering with F (n)n non-decreasing in n and g(a) = 0 for some a \u2208 R+.\nNotice also that ENDGU social orderings also satisfy another interesting property: evaluations of risks on population size n are independent of the individuals\u2019 utility level, provided that all existing individuals have the same utility level in all states of the world and in the two lotteries being compared. This property is known as weak additivity in Pollak (1967) and as preferential independence in Keeney (1974). However, this property is also satisfied by ENWGU social orderings with F constant and G non-constant, so it does not characterize ENDGU."

By Social expected-utility, this means that:\n1 3 V (uv)+2 3 V (w) \u2265 1 3 V (u\u2032v)+2 3 V (w)\u21d0\u21d2 1 3 V (u)+1 3 V (vw)+1 3 V (w) \u2265 1 3 V (u\u2032)+1 3 V (vw)+1 3 V (w).\nThe equivalence simplifies to V (uv) \u2265 V (u\u2032v)\u21d0\u21d2 V (u) \u2265 V (u\u2032). By Social expected-utility, this implies that uv % u\u2032v if and only if u % u\u2032. Step 4: Conclusion. % is a social welfare ordering that satisfies the Basic Principles and Ind-a. By Proposition 2, we thus know that there exist two continuous and increasing functions \u03d5 : R \u2192 R and g : R \u2192 R such that\n\u03d5(0) = g(0) = 0, and for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 P : p % p\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)\np(u)\u00d7\u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] \u2265 \u2211 u\u2208supp(p\u2032) p\u2032(u)\u00d7\u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] . (A.2)\nConsider the situation in Property 1, where there are three alternatives u, v, w in U such that N(u) \u2229 N(v) = \u2205, N(w) = {k} with k /\u2208 N(v), and p(uv) = 1/3, p(w) = 2/3, p\u2032(u) = 1/3, p\u2032(vw) = 1/3 and p\u2032(w) = 1/3. Assume that wk = c, with c the critical-level parameter in Equation (A.2).\nGiven that % satisfies Property 1, we know that p \u223c p\u2032. Using the\nrepresentation in Equation (A.2), this implies:\n1 3 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + \u2211 j\u2208N(v) [ g(vj)\u2212 g(c) ] = 1\n3 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ]+ 1 3 \u03d5  \u2211 j\u2208N(v) [ g(vj)\u2212 g(c) ] Denoting a the real number a = \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] and b the real number\nb = \u2211 j\u2208N(v) [ g(vj)\u2212 g(c) ] , we thus get the equality\n\u03d5(a+ b) = \u03d5(a) + \u03d5(b).\nWe can actually get this equality for any pair of real numbers (a, b) \u2208 R2. Indeed, any real number can be reached as a sum of transformed utilities minus the transformed critical level.23 We thus get the Cauchy functional equation \u03d5(a+b) = \u03d5(a)+\u03d5(b) for all (a, b) \u2208 R2. Given that \u03d5 is continuous, 23We can add the utility of as many people as we want and we can vary their utility level above and below c.\nwe know that there must exist a real number \u03b1 such that \u03d5(a) = \u03b1a for all a \u2208 R (Acze\u0301l, 1966, Chap. 2). Given that \u03d5 is increasing, we actually know that \u03b1 > 0.\nSo we can conclude that there exist a continuous and increasing function g : R\u2192 R such that g(0) = 0, and a real number c \u2208 R, such that, for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 P : p % p\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)\np(u)\u00d7  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] \u2265 \u2211 u\u2208supp(p\u2032) p\u2032(u)\u00d7  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] . The social welfare ordering % is an ECLGU social welfare ordering.\nA.2 Proof of Proposition 3\nGiven that % on F satisfies the Basic Principles, by Proposition 1, there exist a function W : N\u00d7R\u2192 R increasing and continuous in its second argument, and for each n \u2208 N a continuous, increasing, symmetric and normalized function \u039en such that, for all p, p \u2032 \u2208 P : p % p\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)\np(u)\u00d7W ( n(u),\u039en(u)(u) ) \u2265 \u2211 u\u2208supp(p\u2032) p\u2032(u)\u00d7W ( n(u),\u039en(u)(u) ) .\n(A.3)\nConsider any e \u2208 R and any m \u2208 N. Let u, v, w in U be three alternatives such that n(u) = n(v) = 1, n(w) = m, N(u) \u2229 N(v) = N(u) \u2229 N(w) = N(v) \u2229 N(w) = \u2205, and ui = vj = wk = e for all i \u2208 N(u), j \u2208 N(v) and k \u2208 N(w). By Social risk neutrality in population size for perfect equality, if p and p\u2032 \u2208 P are such that p(uvw) = 1/2, p(w) = 1/2, p\u2032(uw) = 1/2 and\np\u2032(vw) = 1/2, then p \u223c p\u2032. By Equation (A.3), this means that:\n1 2 W (m+ 2, e) + 1 2 W (m, e) = 1 2 W (m+ 1, e) + 1 2 W (m+ 1, e).\nLet us denote \u03b8e : N \u2192 R the function such that \u03b8e(n) = W (n, e). The equality implies that for all m \u2208 N,\n\u03b8e(m+ 2) = 2\u03b8e(m+ 1)\u2212 \u03b8e(m).\nLet us prove that \u03b8e(n) = \u03a6e+n\u03a8e, for all n \u2208 N, where \u03a6e = 2\u03b8e(1)\u2212\u03b8e(2) and \u03a8e = \u03b8e(2)\u2212 \u03b8e(1). For n = 1 and n = 2, this is obviously true. Assume that for some m \u2208 N, \u03b8e(m) = \u03a6e +m\u03a8e and \u03b8e(m+ 1) = \u03a6e + (m+ 1)\u03a8e: let us show that it is also the case for m+ 2. By the equality above, we obtain\n\u03b8e(m+ 2) = 2\u03b8e(m+ 1)\u2212 \u03b8e(m) = 2 ( \u03a6e + (m+ 1)\u03a8e ) \u2212 ( \u03a6e +m\u03a8e ) = \u03a6e + [ 2(m+ 1)\u2212m ] \u03a8e = \u03a6e + (m+ 2)\u03a8e.\nHence, for any e \u2208 R and any n \u2208 N, we have that:\nW (n, e) = [ 2W (e, 1)\u2212W (e, 2) ] + n [ W (e, 2)\u2212W (e, 1) ] .\nDenoting \u03a6 : R \u2192 R the continuous function such that \u03a6(e) = 2W (e, 1)\u2212 W (e, 2) for all e \u2208 R, and \u03a8 : R \u2192 R the continuous function such that \u03a8(e) = W (e, 2)\u2212W (e, 1) for all e \u2208 R, we obtain the result.\nA.3 Proof of Theorem 2\nStep 1: Proof that ECLGU satisfies all the properties. It can easily be checked that an ECLGU social welfare ordering satisfies the Basic Principles, Ind-l, and Social risk neutrality in population size for perfect equality. Step 2: function V can only be specific transformations of an additively separable social welfare function. Given that % on P satisfies the Basic Principles and Ind-l (and therefore Ind-a), we know by Proposition 2 that there exist two continuous and increasing functions \u03d5 : R\u2192 R and g : R\u2192 R such that \u03d5(0) = g(0) = 0, and for all p, p\u2032 \u2208 P : p % p\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211\nu\u2208supp(p)\np(u)\u00d7\u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] \u2265 \u2211 u\u2208supp(p\u2032) p\u2032(u)\u00d7\u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] . (A.4)\nConsider p, p\u2032, q, q\u2032 \u2208 P , such that there exist distinct alternatives u, v,\nv\u2032, w, and w\u2032 in U for which:\n\u2022 N(u) \u2229N(v) = N(u) \u2229N(v\u2032) = N(u) \u2229N(w) = N(u) \u2229N(w\u2032) = \u2205;\n\u2022 p(uv) = p(uv\u2032) = q(uw) = q(uw\u2032) = p\u2032(v) = p\u2032(v\u2032) = q\u2032(w) = q\u2032(w\u2032) =\n1/2.\nBy Ind-l, and using Equation (A.4), we obtain that:\n1 2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + \u2211 i\u2208N(v) [ g(vi)\u2212 g(c) ]+ 1 2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + \u2211 i\u2208N(v\u2032) [ g(v\u2032i)\u2212 g(c) ] \u2265 1\n2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + \u2211 i\u2208N(w) [ g(wi)\u2212 g(c) ]+ 1 2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + \u2211 i\u2208N(w\u2032) [ g(w\u2032i)\u2212 g(c) ] \u21d0\u21d2 1\n2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(v) [ g(vi)\u2212 g(c) ]+ 1 2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(v\u2032) [ g(v\u2032i)\u2212 g(c) ] \u2265 1\n2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(w) [ g(wi)\u2212 g(c) ]+ 1 2 \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(w\u2032) [ g(w\u2032i)\u2212 g(c) ]\nDenote a = \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui) \u2212 g(c) ] , x = \u2211 i\u2208N(v) [ g(vi) \u2212 g(c) ] , x\u2032 =\u2211\ni\u2208N(v\u2032) [ g(v\u2032i)\u2212g(c) ] , y = \u2211 i\u2208N(w) [ g(wi)\u2212g(c) ] and y\u2032 = \u2211 i\u2208N(w\u2032) [ g(w\u2032i)\u2212\ng(c) ] . We get that, for any real numbers a, x, x\u2032, x and y\u2032:\n\u03d5(a+x) +\u03d5(a+x\u2032) \u2265 \u03d5(a+ y) +\u03d5(a+ y\u2032)\u21d0\u21d2 \u03d5(x) +\u03d5(x\u2032) \u2265 \u03d5(y) +\u03d5(y\u2032).\nLet I = \u03d5(R), which is an open interval in R because \u03d5 is continuous and increasing. First fix a and denote \u03c8a : I \u2192 R the continuous function such\nthat \u03c8a(x) = \u03d5 ( a+ \u03d5\u22121(x) ) . By letting z = \u03d5(x), z\u2032 = \u03d5(x\u2032), t = \u03d5(y) and t\u2032 = \u03d5(y\u2032), the above equivalence can be written:\n\u03c8a(z) + \u03c8a(z \u2032) \u2265 \u03c8a(t) + \u03c8a(t\u2032)\u21d0\u21d2 z + z\u2032 \u2265 t+ t\u2032,\nand it holds for all z, z\u2032, t and t\u2032 in I. So, there must exist an increasing function \u03a8a : R\u2192 R such that, for all z, z\u2032 \u2208 I: \u03c8a(z) + \u03c8a(z\u2032) = \u03a8a(z + z\u2032). This is a Pexider functional equation, and it is known that in that case \u03a8a and \u03c8a must be affine (Acze\u0301l, 1966). Hence there exist \u03b1a \u2208 R++ and \u03b2a \u2208 R such that \u03c8a(z) = \u03b1az + \u03b2a.\nDefine the functions \u03b1 : R \u2192 R++ and \u03b2 : R \u2192 R by \u03b1(a) = \u03b1a and \u03b2(a) = \u03b2a for all a \u2208 R. By definition of function \u03c8a, we obtain that, for all\nx \u2208 R, \u03c8a(\u03d5(x)) = \u03d5 ( a+ \u03d5\u22121 \u25e6 \u03d5(x) ) = \u03d5(a+ x). But by our result above, it is also the case that \u03c8a(\u03d5(x)) = \u03b1(a)\u03d5(x) + \u03b2(a). We thus end up with the functional equation: \u03d5(a+ x) = \u03b1(a)\u03d5(x) + \u03b2(a) for all (a, x) \u2208 R2. By Corollary 1 (pp. 150\u2013151) in Acze\u0301l (1966), this equation implies that either \u03d5 is affine or that it is a positive affine transformation of the function x\u2192 \u03b1e\u03b1x for some \u03b1 6= 0.\nStep 3: Conclusion. By Step 2, we know that\nV (u) = \u03d5  \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] , where V is the function in the statement of Social expected utility, and \u03d5 is affine or that it is a positive affine transformation of the function x\u2192 \u03b1e\u03b1x for some \u03b1 6= 0.\nAlso given that % satisfies RiskNeu, we know by Prop. 3 that there exist a positive number a, a number b, two continuous functions \u03a8 : R\u2192 R and \u03a6 : R \u2192 R, and for each n \u2208 N a continuous, increasing, symmetric and normalized function \u039en such that, for u such that n(u) > 0:\nV (u) = a [ \u03a6 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) + n(u)\u00d7\u03a8 ( \u039en(u)(u) ) ] + b.\nBy contradiction, suppose that \u03d5 is a positive affine transformation of the function x\u2192 \u03b1e\u03b1x for some \u03b1 6= 0. Consider any n \u2208 N and x \u2208 R, and let u be such that n(u) = n and ui = x for all i \u2208 N(u). We must have:\n\u03b1e\u03b1n(g(x)\u2212g(c)) = a [ \u03a6 (x) + n\u00d7\u03a8 (x) ] + b.\nIf x 6= c, then the left-hand side is an exponential function in n, whereas the right-hand side is an affine function in n. But this cannot be true. Hence only the affine form is possible for \u03d5.\nA.4 Proof of Proposition 4\nConsider any N \u2208 N and let n = |N |. For any i \u2208 N let %i be the ordering on PN such that, for any p, p \u2032 \u2208 PN , p %i p\u2032 if and only if pi % p\u2032i. By Social\nexpected-utility, defining Wi(p) = \u2211\nu\u2208Ui pi(u)V (u), we have that p %i p \u2032 if and only if Wi(p) \u2265 Wi(p\u2032). Similarly, defining W0(p) = \u2211\nu\u2208UN p(u)V (u), we\nhave that p % p\u2032 if and only if W (p) \u2265 W (p\u2032).\nConsider F = (W0, (Wi)i\u2208N ) : PN \u2192 Rn+1. By definition F (PN ) is convex because Wi(\u03bap+ (1\u2212 \u03ba)q) = \u03baWi(p) + (1\u2212 \u03ba)Wi(q) for each i \u2208 N or i = 0. IDom implies that, if Wi(p) > Wi(q) for all i \u2208 N , then W0(p) > W0(q). By Proposition 2 in De Meyer and Mongin (1995), there must exist non-negative numbers \u03bbi and a number \u03b3 such that, for each p \u2208 PN :\nW0(p) = \u2211 i\u2208N \u03bbiWi(p) + \u03b3.\nFocusing on lotteries yielding sure outcomes, we get that, for all u, v \u2208 UN ,\nu % v \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211 i\u2208N \u03bbiV (ui) \u2265 \u2211 i\u2208N \u03bbiV (vi).\nBy Anonymity and Strong Pareto, it must be the case that all the \u03bbi must be the same positive number \u03bb. Denoting g the function such that g(ui) = V (ui) for each ui \u2208 R, we obtain that for all p, q \u2208 PN ,\np % q \u21d0\u21d2 \u2211 u\u2208UN p(u) [\u2211 i\u2208N g(ui) ] \u2265 \u2211 u\u2208UN p(u) [\u2211 i\u2208N g(ui) ] .\nObserve that, by definition and Anonymity, the function g does not depend\nneither on i nor on N .\nBy Social expected-utility, and given that a VNM utility function is defined up to an increasing affine transformation, it must be the case that, for each N \u2208 N , for each u \u2208 UN :\nV (u) = F (N) [\u2211 i\u2208N g(ui) ] +G(N),\nfor some positive F (N) and some number G(N). By Anonymity, F (N) and G(N) only depend on population size.\nA.5 Proof of Theorem 3\nStep 1: Proof that ECLGU satisfies all the properties. It can easily be checked that an ECLGU social welfare ordering satisfies the Basic Principles, IDom, IndPUnc and CCL-rf. Step 2: Proof that % has a constant critical level. We show that if % satisfies the Basic Principles and IndPUnc, then it satisfies CCL-rf.\nBy Minimal existence of a critical level, there exist u \u2208 U , c \u2208 R, and i /\u2208 N(u), such that if v \u2208 U is defined by N(v) = N(u) \u222a {i}, vi = c and vj = uj for all j \u2208 N(u), then v \u223c u. Let \u03b5 be some positive number. Define v\u0303 \u2208 U by N(v\u0303) = N(v), v\u0303i = c+ \u03b5 and v\u0303j = uj for all j \u2208 N(u). By Strong Pareto, we must have v\u0303 v \u223c u, which by Social expected-utility implies that V (v\u0303) > V (u).\nConsider any u\u2032 \u2208 U and any k /\u2208 N(u\u2032), and define v\u0303\u2032 \u2208 U such that N(v\u0303\u2032) = N(u\u2032) \u222a {k}, v\u0303\u2032k = c+ \u03b5 and v\u0303\u2032l = u\u0303l for all l \u2208 N(u\u2032). Let p, p\u2032 \u2208 P such that p(u\u2032) = p\u2032(v\u0303\u2032) = q and p(u) = p\u2032(v\u0303) = 1 \u2212 q, with q \u2208 (0, 1).\nIndPUnc requires that, if p\u2032 p for some q, this should be true whatever q is. But p\u2032 p means that:\nqV (v\u0303\u2032) + (1\u2212 q)V (v\u0303) > qV (u\u2032) + (1\u2212 q)V (u)\nwhich can be written\nV (v\u0303)\u2212 V (u) > q 1\u2212q\n[ V (u\u2032)\u2212 V (v\u0303\u2032) ] .\nGiven that V (v\u0303) > V (u), this must be true, whatever the values V (v\u0303\u2032) and V (u\u2032), for small enough value of q.\nThus, whatever q is, we have:\nqV (v\u0303\u2032) + (1\u2212 q)V (v\u0303) > qV (u\u2032) + (1\u2212 q)V (u)\nwhich can be written\nV (v\u0303\u2032)\u2212 V (u\u2032) > 1\u2212q q\n[ V (v\u0303)\u2212 V (u) ] .\nGiven that 1\u2212q q can be as low as we want, we need to have V (v\u0303\u2032)\u2212 V (u\u2032) \u2265 0, and therefore v\u0303\u2032 % u\u2032.\nSo for every \u03b5 > 0, v\u0303\u2032 % u\u2032, where v\u0303\u2032 \u2208 U is such that N(v\u0303\u2032) = N(u\u2032)\u222a{k}, v\u0303\u2032k = c + \u03b5 and v\u0303 \u2032 l = u\u0303l for all l \u2208 N(u\u2032). By continuity, if v\u2032 \u2208 U such that N(v\u2032) = N(u\u2032) \u222a {k}, v\u2032k = c and v\u2032l = u\u2032l for all l \u2208 N(u\u0303), then v\u2032 % u\u2032.\nWe can prove that u\u2032 % v\u2032 in the same way by using a negative \u03b5 < 0.\nHence, u\u2032 \u223c v\u2032.\nIn conclusion, there exists c \u2208 R, such that for all u\u2032 \u2208 U and for all\nk /\u2208 N(u\u2032), if v\u2032 \u2208 U is such that N(v\u2032) = N(u\u2032) \u222a {k}, v\u2032k = c and v\u2032l = u\u2032l for all l \u2208 N(u), then u\u2032 \u223c v\u2032. The social ordering % satisfies CCL-rf. Step 3: Conclusion. Given that % satisfies the Basic Principles and IDom, we know by Proposition 4 that it is an ENWGU social ordering. Then there exist a continuous and increasing function g : R \u2192 R, and two functions F : N\u2192 R and G : N\u2192 R such that for any u \u2208 U the VNM social utility function is\nV (u) = F ( n(u) ) \u2211 i\u2208N(u) g(ui) +G ( n(u) ) .\nBy Step 3, we also know that % satisfies CCL-rf. Hence, there exists a c \u2208 R such that, for any n \u2208 N and any x \u2208 R, if u, v \u2208 U are such that n(u) = n, N(v) = N(u) \u222a {i} (with i /\u2208 N(u)), uj = vj = x for all j \u2208 N(u) and vi = c, then V (u) = V (v), so that:\nF (n)ng(x) +G(n) = F (n+ 1) [ ng(x) + g(c) ] +G(n+ 1).\nGiven that g is increasing in x and that this equality must be true for all x \u2208 R, we must have F (n + 1) = F (n). Hence, we also obtain by the equality that G(n + 1) \u2212 G(n) = \u2212g(c). Hence, by iterating on n (given that these results are true for all n \u2208 N), we have F (n) = F (0) = a and G(n) = G(0)\u2212ng(c) = b\u2212ng(c), where a > 0 and b is a real number. Hence,\nV (u) = a \u2211 i\u2208N(u) [ g(ui)\u2212 g(c) ] + b."
