 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the long-term impacts of the demand bundling program on internet prices, speeds, and school expenditures over multiple years. The current study only looks at the immediate effects in the first year. 

2. Investigate whether similar demand bundling programs could work for other public services like electricity, waste management, etc. The logistics would likely differ across sectors.

3. Analyze the distributional impacts of the program on different types of schools (urban, rural, wealthy, poor, etc.). The paper currently looks at average effects. 

4. Study the impacts on student educational outcomes. Does increased internet speed and lower costs translate to better test scores or other metrics? This could further demonstrate the program's benefits.

5. Evaluate optimal consortium design features like number and size of regions, auction mechanics, and contract terms. There may be ways to further improve the program's effectiveness through tweaks to the implementation.
