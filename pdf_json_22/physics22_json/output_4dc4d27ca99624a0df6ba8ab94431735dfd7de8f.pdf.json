    "abstractText": "Geological carbon storage represents one of the few truly scalable technologies capable of reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. While this technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability to mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns assurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst the different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its ability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these superior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive efforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To overcome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are created by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no longer insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity time-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are averted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic datasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and irregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted to produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier. The testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2 leakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy.",

            "text": "For various reasons, seismic monitoring of geological carbon storage (GCS) comes with its own set of unique challenges. Amongst these challenges, the need for low-cost highly repeatable, high resolution, and high fidelity images ranks chiefly. While densely sampled and replicated time-lapse surveys\u2014which rely on permanent reservoir monitoring systems\u2014may be able to provide images conducive to interpretation and reservoir management, these approaches are often too costly and require too much handholding to be of practical use for GCS.\nTo overcome these challenges, we replace the current paradigm of costly replicated acquisition, cumbersome time-lapse processing, and interpretation, by a joint inversion framework mapping time-lapse data to high fidelity and high resolution images from sparse non-replicated time-lapse surveys. We demonstrate that we arrive at an imaging framework that is suitable for automatic detection of pressure-induced CO2 leakage. Rather than relying on meticulous 4D workflows where baseline and monitoring surveys are processed separately to yield accurate and artifact-free time-lapse differences, our approach exposes information that is shared amongst the different vintages by formulating the imaging problem in terms of an unknown fictitious common component, and innovations of the baseline and monitor survey(s) with respect to this common component. Because the common component is informed by all time-lapse surveys, its image quality improves when the surveys bring complementary information, which is the case when the surveys are not replicated. In turn, the enhanced common component results in improved images for the baseline, monitor, and their time-lapse difference. Joint inversion also leads to robustness with respect to noise, calibration errors, and time-lapse changes in the background velocity model.\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n03 52\n7v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ge\noph\n] 7\nO ct\n2 02\nTo showcase the achievable imaging gains and how these can be used in a GCS setting where CO2 leakage is of major consideration, we create hundreds of time-lapse imaging experiments involving CO2 plumes whose behavior is determined by the two-phase flow equations. To mimic irregular flow due to pressure-induced opening of fractures, we increase the permeability in the seal at random locations and pressure thresholds. The resulting flow simulations are used to generate time-lapse datasets that serve as input to our joint imaging scheme. The produced time-lapse difference images are subsequently used to train and test a neural network that as an explainable classifier determines whether the CO2 plume behaves regularly or shows signs of leakage.\nOur contributions are organized as follows. First, we discuss the time-lapse seismic imaging problem and its practical difficulties. Next, we introduce the joint recovery model that takes explicit advantage of information shared by multiple surveys. By means of a carefully designed synthetic case study involving saline aquifers made of Blunt sandstone in the Southern North Sea, we demonstrate the uplift of the joint recovery model and how its images can be used to train a deep neural network classifier to detect erroneous growth of the CO2 plume automatically. Aside from determining whether the CO2 plume behaves regularly or not, our network also provides class activation mappings that visualize areas in the image on which the network is basing its classification.\nSeismic monitoring with time-lapse imaging\nTo keep track of CO2 plume development during geological carbon storage (GCS) projects, multiple time-lapse surveys are collected. Baseline surveys are acquired before the supercritical CO2 is injected into the reservoir. These baseline surveys, denoted by the index j = 1, are followed by one or more monitor surveys, collected at later times and indexed by j = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nv with nv the total number of surveys.\nSeismic monitoring of GCS brings its own unique set of challenges that stem from the fact that its main concern is (early) detection of possible leakage of CO2 from the storage complex. To be successful with this task, monitoring GCS calls for a time-lapse imaging modality that is capable of\n\u2022 detecting weak time-lapse signals associated with small rock-physics changes induced by CO2 leakage \u2022 attaining high lateral resolution from active-source surface seismic data to detect vertically moving\nleakage \u2022 handling an increasing number of seismic surveys collected over long periods of time (\u223c 50\u2212 100 years) \u2022 reducing costs drastically by no longer insisting on replication of time-lapse surveys to attain high\ndegrees of repeatability \u2022 lowering the cumulative environmental imprint of active source acquisition\nMonitoring with the joint recovery model\nTo meet these challenges, we choose a linear imaging framework where observed linearized data for each vintage is related to perturbations in the acoustic impedance via\nbj = Ajxj + ej for j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nv. (1)\nIn this expression, the matrix Aj stands for the linearized Born scattering operator for the j th vintage. Observed linearized data, collected for all shots in the vector bj , is generated by applying the Aj \u2019s to the (unknown) impedance perturbations denoted by xj for j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nv. The task of time-lapse imaging is to create high resolution, high fidelity and true amplitude estimates for the time-lapse images, {x\u0302j}nvj=1, from non-replicated sparsely sampled noisy time-lapse data.\nWe argue that our choice for linearized imaging is justified for four reasons. First, CO2-injection sites undergo extensive baseline studies, which means that accurate information on the background velocity model is generally available. Second, changes in the acoustic parameters induced by CO2 injection are typically small, so it suffices to work with one and the same background model for the baseline and monitor surveys. Third, when the background model is sufficiently close to the true model, linearized inversion, which corresponds to a single Gauss-Newton iteration of full-waveform inversion, converges quadratically. Fourth, because the forward model is linear, it is conducive to the use of the joint recovery model where inversions are carried out with respect to the common component, which is shared between all vintages, and innovations with respect to the common component. Because the common component represents an average, we expect this joint imaging method to be relatively robust with respect to kinematic changes induced by time-lapse effects or by lack of calibration of the acquisition [Oghenekohwo and Herrmann, 2017b].\nBy parameterizing time-lapse images, {xj}nvj=1, in terms of the common component, z0, and innovations with respect to the common component, {zj}nvj=1, we arrive at the joint recovery model where representations for the images are given by\nxj = 1 \u03b3 z0 + zj for j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nv. (2)\nHere, the parameter, \u03b3, controls the balance between the common component, z0, and innovation components, {zj}nvj=1 [Li, 2015]. Compared to traditional time-lapse approaches, where data are imaged separately or where time-lapse surveys are subtracted, inversions for time-lapse images based on the above parameterization are carried out jointly and involve inverting the following matrix:\nA =  1 \u03b3A1 A1 ... . . .\n1 \u03b3Anv Anv  . (3) While traditional time-lapse imaging approaches strive towards maximal replication between the surveys to suppress acquisition related artifacts, imaging with the joint recovery model\u2014which entails inverting the underdetermined system in Equation 3 using structure-promotion techniques (e.g. via `1-norm minimization)\u2014 improves the image quality of the vintages themselves in situations where the surveys are not replicated. This occurs in cases where Ai 6= Aj for \u2200i 6= j, or in situations where there is significant noise. This remarkable result was shown to hold for sparsity-promoting denoising of time-lapse field data [Wei et al., 2018, Tian et al., 2018], for various wavefield reconstructions of randomized simultaneous-source dynamic (towed-array) and static (OBC/OBN) marine acquisitions [Oghenekohwo and Herrmann, 2017b, Kotsi, 2020, Zhou and Lumley, 2021], and for wave-based inversion, including least-squares reverse-time migration and full-waveform inversion [Oghenekohwo, 2017, Oghenekohwo and Herrmann, 2017a]. The observed quality gains in these applications can be explained by improvements in the common component resulting from complementary information residing in non-replicated time-lapse surveys. This enhanced recovery of the common component in turn improves the recovery of the innovations and therefore the vintages themselves. The time-lapse differences themselves also improve, or at the very least, remain relatively unaffected when the surveys are not replicated. Relaxing replication of surveys obviously leads to reduction in cost and environmental impact. Below, we show how GCS monitoring also benefits from this approach.\nMonitoring with curvelet-domain structure promotion\nTo obtain high resolution and high fidelity time-lapse images, we invert the system in Equation 3 [Yang et al., 2020, Witte et al., 2019b, Yin et al., 2021] with\nminimize z \u03bb\u2016Cz\u20161 + 1 2\u2016Cz\u2016 2 2\nsubject to \u2016b\u2212Az\u201622 \u2264 \u03c3, (4)\nwhere C is the forward curvelet transform, \u03bb the threshold parameter, and \u03c3 the magnitude of the noise. At iteration k and for \u03c3 = 0, solving Equation 4 corresponds to computing the following iterations:\nuk+1 = uk \u2212 tkA>k (Akzk \u2212 bk) zk+1 = C>S\u03bb(Cuk+1),\n(5)\nwhere Ak, with a slight abuse of notation, represents the matrix in Equation 3 for a subset of shots randomly selected from sources in each survey. The vector bk contains the extracted shot records from b and the symbol > refers to the adjoint. Sparsity is promoted via curvelet-domain soft thresholding, S\u03bb(\u00b7) = max(| \u00b7 | \u2212 \u03bb, 0) sign(\u00b7), where, \u03bb, is the threshold. The vectors uk and zk contain the baseline and innovation components.\nNumerical case study: Blunt sandstone in the Southern North Sea\nBefore discussing the impact of high resolution and high fidelity time-lapse imaging with the joint recovery model on the down-stream task of automatic leakage detection with a neural network classifier, we first detail the setup of our numerical experiments using techniques from simulation-based acquisition design as described by Yin et al. [2021]. In order to generate realistic time-lapse data and training sets for the automatic leakage classifier, we follow the workflow summarized in Figure 1. In this approach, use is made of proxy models for seismic properties derived from real 3D imaged seismic and well data [Jones et al., 2012]. With rock physics, these seismic models are converted to fluid-flow models that serve as input to two-phase flow simulations. The resulting datasets, which include pressure-induced leakage, will be used to create time-lapse data used to train our classifier. For more detail, refer to the caption of Figure 1."

For that reason, we consider a proxy model constructed representative for CO2 injection in the South of the North Sea involving a saline aquifer made of the highly permeable Blunt sandstone. This area, which is actively being considered for GCS [Kolster et al., 2018], consists of the following three geologic sections (see Figure 2 for the permeability and porosity distribution):\n(i) the highly porous (average 33%) and permeable (> 170 mD) Blunt sandstone reservoir of about 300\u2212 500 m thick. This section, denoted by red colors in Figure 2, corresponds to the saline aquifer and serves as the reservoir for CO2 injection;\n(ii) the primary seal (permeability 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22122 mD) made of the Rot Halite Member, which is 50 m thick and continuous (black layer in Figure 2);\n(iii) the secondary seal made of the Haisborough group, which is > 300 m thick and consists of low-permeable (permeability 15\u2212 18 mD) mudstone (purple section in Figure 2).\nTo arrive at the fluid-flow models, we consider 2D subsets of the 3D Compass model [Jones et al., 2012] and convert these seismic models to fluid-flow properties (see Figure 1 (b)) by assuming a linear relationship between compressional wavespeed and permeability in each stratigraphic section. For further details on the conversion of compressional wavespeed and density to permeability and porosity, we refer to empirical relationships reported in Klimentos [1991]. During conversion, an increase of 1km/s in compressional wavespeed is assumed to correspond to an increase of 1.63 mD in permeability. From this, porosity is calculated with the Kozeny-Carman equation [Costa, 2006] K = \u03c63 ( 1.527\n0.0314\u2217(1\u2212\u03c6)\n)2 , where K and \u03c6 denote\npermeability (mD) and porosity (%) with constants taken from the Strategic UK CCS Storage Appraisal Project report."

At that depth, the pressure is below the fracture gradient [Ringrose, 2020]. Since pressure-induced fractures come in different sizes, we also randomly vary the width of the pressure-induced fracture openings from 12.5 m to 62.5 m.

            "text": "To train and validate automatic detection of CO2 leakage from the storage complex requires the creation of realistic time-lapse datasets that contain the seismic imprint of regular as well as irregular (leakage) plume development. To this end, baseline surveys are simulated prior to CO2 injection for different subsets of the Compass model. Monitor surveys are simulated 200 days after leakage occurs to verify that potential leakage can be detected automatically early on. For regular plume development, we shoot monitor surveys for each subset at random times after CO2 injection. In order to strike a balance between acquisition productivity and time-lapse image quality, use is made of dense permanent acoustic monitoring at the seafloor with 25 m receiver spacing. Time-lapse acquisition costs are reduced by non-replicated coarse shooting with the source towed at 10 m depth below the ocean surface. Subsampling artifacts are reduced by using a randomized technique from compressive sensing where 32 sources are located at non-replicated jittered [Herrmann and Hennenfent, 2008] source positions, yielding an average source sampling of 125 m. Given this acquisition geometry, linear data is generated2 with Equation 1 for a 25 Hz Ricker wavelet and with the band-limited noise term set so that the data\u2019s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 8.0 dB. This noise level leads to an extremely poor SNR of \u221231.4 dB for time-lapse differences in the shot domain. See Figure 1 (e).\nImaging with joint recovery model versus reverse-time migration\nGiven the simulated time-lapse datasets with and without leakage, time-lapse difference images are created according to two different imaging scenarios, namely via independent reverse-time migration (RTM), conducted on the baseline and monitor surveys separately, and via inversion of the joint recovery model (cf. Equations 3 and 4). To limit the computational cost of the Bregman iterations (Equation 5), four shot records are selected per iteration at random from each survey for imaging [Yin et al., 2008, Witte et al., 2019b, Yang et al., 2020, Yin et al., 2021], limiting the cost of the joint inversion to three RTMs. The recovered baseline images are shown in Figures 3a for RTM and 3b for JRM. For the leakage scenario, the time-lapse differences are plotted in Figures 3c and 3d, for RTM and JRM respectively. For the regular plume, the time-lapse differences are plotted in Figures 3e and 3f, for RTM and JRM respectively. From these images, it is clear that joint\n2We used the open-source software JUDI.jl [Witte et al., 2019a, Louboutin et al., 2022] to model the wave propagation. This Julia package calls the highly optimized propagators of Devito [Louboutin et al., 2019, Luporini et al., 2020, 2022].\ninversion leads to relatively artifact-free recovery of the vintages and time-lapse differences. This observation is reflected in the NRMS values, which improve considerably as shown by the histograms in Figure 4 for 1000 imaging experiments. Not only do the NRMS values shift towards the left, their values are also more concentrated when inverting time-lapse data with the joint recovery model. Both features are beneficial to automatic leakage detection.\nDeep neural network classifier for CO2 leakage detection\nThe injection of supercritical CO2 into the storage complex perturbs the physical, chemical and thermal environment of the reservoir [Newell and Ilgen, 2019]. Because CO2 injection increases the pressure, this process may trigger CO2 leakage across the seal when the pressure increase induces opening of pre-existing faults or fractures zones [Pruess, 2006, Ringrose, 2020]. To ensure safe operations of CO2 storage, we develop a quantitative leakage detection tool based on a deep neural classifier. This classifier is trained on time-lapse images that contain the imprint of CO2 plumes that behave regularly and irregularly. In case of irregular flow, CO2 escapes the storage complex through a pressure induced opening in the seal, which causes a localized increase in permeability (shown in Figure 3d).\nBecause time-lapse differences are small in amplitude, and strongly localized laterally when leakage occurs, highly sensitive learned classifiers are needed. For this purpose, we follow Erdinc et al. [2022] and adopt the Vision Transformer (ViT) [Dosovitskiy et al., 2020]. This state-of-the-art classifier originated from the field of natural language processing (NLP) [Vaswani et al., 2017]. Thanks to their attention mechanism, ViTs have been shown to achieve superior performance on image classification tasks where image patches are considered as word tokens by the transformer network. As a result, ViTs have much less image-specific inductive bias compared to convolutional neural networks [Dosovitskiy et al., 2020].\nTo arrive at a practical and performant ViT classifier, we start from a ViT that is pre-trained on image tasks with 16\u00d7 16 patches and apply transfer learning [Yosinski et al., 2014] to fine-tune this network on 1576 labeled time-lapse images. Catastrophic forgetting is avoided by freezing the initial layers, which are responsible for feature extraction, during the initial training. After the initial training of the last dense layers, all network weights are updated for several epochs while keeping the learning rate small. The labeled (regular vs. irregular flow) training set itself consists of 1576 time-lapse datasets divided equally between regular and\nirregular flow.\nAfter the training is completed, baseline and monitor surveys are simulated for 394 unseen Earth models with regular and irregular plumes. These simulated time-lapse datasets are imaged with JRM by inverting the matrix in Equation 3 via Bregman iterations in Equation 5. The resulting time-lapse difference images (see Figures 3d and 3f for two examples) serve as input to the ViT classifier. Refer to Figure 5 for performance, which corresponds to a two by two confusion matrix. The first row denotes the classification results for samples with regular plume (negative samples), where 193 (true negative) out of 206 samples are classified correctly. The second row denotes the classification results for samples with CO2 leakage over the seal (positive samples), where 147 (true positive) out of 188 samples are classified correctly. Due to the fact that JRM recovers relatively artifact-free time-lapse differences, the classifier does not pick up too many artifacts related to finite acquisition as CO2 leakage. This leads to much fewer false alarms for CO2 leakage.\nClass activation mapping based saliency map\nWhile our ViT classifier is capable of achieving good performance (see Figure 5), making intervention decisions during GCS projects calls for interpretability and trustworthiness of our classifier [Hooker et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2021, Mackowiak et al., 2021]. To enhance these features, we take advantage of class activation mappings (CAM) [Zhou et al., 2016]. These saliency maps help us to identify the discriminative spatial regions in each image that support a particular class decision. In our application, these regions correspond to areas where the classifier deems the CO2 plume to behave irregularly (if the classification result is leakage). By overlaying time-lapse difference images with these maps, interpretation is facilitated, assisting practitioners to make decisions on how to proceed with GCS projects and take associated actions. Figure 6 illustrates how the Score\nCAM approach [Wang et al., 2020] serves this purpose3. Figure 6a shows the CAM result for a time-lapse difference image classified as a CO2 leakage (in Figure 3d). Despite few artifacts around the image, the CAM clearly focuses on the CO2 leakage over the seal, which could potentially alert the practitioners of GCS. When the plume is detected as growing regularly, the CAM result is diffusive (shown in Figure 6b). This shows that the classification decision is based on the entire image and not only at the plume area. The scripts to reproduce the experiments are available on the SLIM GitHub page https://github.com/slimgroup/GCS-CAM."

Because our method relies on a joint inversion methodology, it also averts labor-intensive 4D processing. Aside from establishing our claim of relaxing the need for replication empirically, through hundreds of time-lapse experiments yielding significant improvements in NMRS values, we also showed that a deep neural classifier can be trained to detect CO2 leakage automatically. While the classification results are encouraging, there are still false negatives. We argue that this may be acceptable since decisions to stop injection of CO2 are also based on other sources of information such as pressure drop at the wellhead. In future work, we plan to extend this methodology to different leakage scenarios and quantification of uncertainty."
