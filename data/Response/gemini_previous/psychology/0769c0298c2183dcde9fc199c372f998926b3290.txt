1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the abietane diterpenoids:** 
Synthesize and evaluate a series of abietane diterpenoids with different substituents and functional groups to determine the structural features that are essential for their antitumor activity. This information could be used to design more potent and selective analogs.


2. **Explore the mechanism of action of the abietane diterpenoids:** 
Conduct mechanistic studies to elucidate the molecular targets and signaling pathways that are involved in the antitumor activity of the abietane diterpenoids. This knowledge could help to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of the abietane diterpenoids:** 
Test the most promising abietane diterpenoids in animal models of breast cancer to assess their efficacy and safety. This information would be essential for advancing these compounds to clinical trials.


4. **Investigate the potential of the abietane diterpenoids to overcome drug resistance:** 
Determine whether the abietane diterpenoids can overcome drug resistance in breast cancer cells. This is an important consideration, as drug resistance is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of cancer.


5. **Develop novel drug delivery systems for the abietane diterpenoids:** 
Design and evaluate novel drug delivery systems to improve the bioavailability and tumor targeting of the abietane diterpenoids. This could help to enhance their therapeutic efficacy and reduce their side effects.
