This rise is also driving industries to produce more and more synthetic products for humankind. However, different industries discharge various toxic organic contaminants, such as hazards organic dyes, heavy metals, pesticides, aerosol particles, and perilous substance, into the atmosphere.1,2 Most of these industrial effluents pollute the environment, and water pollution is among the worst. Potable water is a basic need, yet worldwide, 0.78 million people have no access to safe drinking water.

Meanwhile, dye pollutants are mostly stable and they are highly resilient to microorganisms. Hence, proper treatment is required to remove the dyes contained in wastewater.16\u201321 Recently, researchers have been focusing on nanocatalyst-based removal methods,22 with incredible progress made in the eld of catalysis. The currently utilized methods for dye removal have several disadvantages, e.g., incomplete degradation of the dye due to the complicated structure, high energy use, and unsuitability for large-scale water treatment.23 However, photodegradation has been found\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The photocatalyst is essential for attaining efficient photocatalytic activity. Using these materials, an intriguing investigation has been conducted, such as (e.g., 3D/3D ReS2/ZnIn2S4\u2013Sv heterojunction, g-C3N4, 2D/2D LaVO4/g-C3N4 (LaVO4/CN) heterostructures) due to their highly crystalline nature, excellent photocatalyst activity, and good stability.26,27\nRecently, photocatalytic degradation has become considered as an easier process for the removal of dyes. Photodegradation is the most appropriate way to eliminate dyes through a degradation process. This degradation process has thus become enormously popular in the last few years compared with heterogeneous catalysis, where a semiconductor photocatalyst absorbs light to accelerate the photoreaction rate to degrade organic dyes. Zinc oxide and copper oxide are inorganic semiconductors that are commonly used in the classical methods. In the modern way taking advantage of photodegradation, organic dyes in wastewater can be removed in a few minutes in the presence of visible light, and without producing any toxic products.28\u201333 Consequently, photocatalytic degradation has been widely used in different elds, such as the removal of pollutants and bacteria,34 water splitting for hydrogen evolution,35 and energy conversion.36 Photocatalysis has opened new doors for the degradation of organic dyes and in the eld of nanotechnology. Ag@GSHNCs are themost suitable catalyst for the degradation of rhodamine B and erythrosine B dyes. Rhodamine B is highly soluble in water and frequently present in dye wastewater, especially from the textile industry. Rhodamine B can easily accumulate in wastewater; however, it can be successfully destroyed in an oxidation system. As a result, developing a proper oxidation system to treat wastewater is important. Recently, Ag nanocomposites were used to treat rhodamine B for its decomposition in the presence of visible light. Rhodamine B has been treated with different nanocomposites in a range of studies, such as Ag/FWO/GCN and Ag/ Fe3O4 nanocomposites.37,38\nHighly uorescent metal nanoclusters have great potential to be used as photocatalysts for dye degradation. In this juncture, uorescent NCs are of particular interest. The catalytic activity mostly depends on the particle size, and the nanocluster size is considered ideal, i.e., below 2 nm. A key facet of the NCs is that they do not alter and/or sway the water quality parameter.35\u201337 Currently, Ag NCs and Au NCs are the most widely used for the degradation of dyes. Their rate of catalytic activity is much higher when used alone. Nanotechnology ca. bridge the elds of photocatalysis and degradation. Atomically precise noble metal nanoclusters have unique properties due to their ultrasmall size.\nIn the current study, we fabricated a GSH@Ag NCs catalyst for the photodegradation of dyes, and it demonstrated a remarkable performance. It is very much anticipated that NCsbased technology will eventually dominate the eld of catalysis due to its facile preparation, cost-effective synthesis, and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Here, atomically engineered ultrasmall GSH@Ag NCs were employed as a photocatalyst for the rst time and exhibited a remarkably high degradation performance. Aqueous solutions of the hazardous organic dye erythrosine B (Ery. B) and rhodamine B (Rh. B) were subjected to degradation in the presence of Ag NCs under solar light and white-light LED irradiation. A multivariate optimization methodology was used to attain a better understanding of the synergistic relationship between the extraction and separation procedures. The spiking addition methodology was used to conrm the accuracy of the desired approach. The recommended technique was successfully applied to a variety of real water samples. The ultrasmall GSH@Ag NCs have great prospects for applications in catalysis, biosensors, and as antioxidants, antibacterial agents, and artifacts."

The degradation reaction was started, and the solution's degradation was observed using UV-vis spectroscopy. While on the other side, both dyes were exposed to solar light, and the UV spectra were monitored over regular time intervals of 5 min. The efficiency of dye degradation was observed by the UV-vis spectra. The dye concentration in the supernatant solution was estimated by the UV-visible spectrum recorded at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 800 nm. The rate of degradation was calculated using the dye solution's decrease in absorbance. As the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the solution was responsible for the decomposition of the dye, if the dye molecules were adsorbed on the catalyst surface, they would only survive for very short intervals of time because ROS were ubiquitous in the solution, causing the dye to degrade quickly. Therefore, the dye adsorption was negligible in this process. Before exposing to irradiation, the solution was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to reach absorption\u2013desorption equilibrium. Aer that, the suspension was subsequently exposed to the light source and continuous stirring was carried out to maximize the possible interaction between the reaction mixture and photocatalyst.

The photocatalytic efficiencies toward ery. B and rh. B dyes were investigated through the UV peaks as mentioned in Fig. 2A and B. An interesting phenomenon was noted where, in the presence of GSH@Ag NCs, the absorbance peaks of ery. B and rh.

At 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25mg/30mL, the photocatalytic degradation rates were 71.11%, 76.22%, 83.11%, 94.60%, and 90.44%; furthermore, for rhodamine B, it was 85.1%, respectively. As a result, the photocatalytic degradation effectiveness of GSH@Ag NCs was greater at lower dye concentrations. This can be explained by the fact that at lower concentrations, more dye molecules are degraded on the surface of the GSH@AgNCs photocatalyst than at higher concentrations. Furthermore, photons were blocked before reaching the photocatalyst surface at higher concentrations, reducing the photonmediated degradation, and so the use of a dye concentration of 20 mg L\u22121 was investigated. The photocatalytic dosage is one of the key factors inuencing the efficiency of degradation. To explore the impact of catalytic dosage on the degradation of dyes, several experiments were conducted. The degradation rate was reduced as the catalyst concentration increased. This phenomenon was driven by the effect of the suspended Ag NCs particles being closer to the radiation, which reduced the light penetration. It was considered that the particles suspended in the solution caused shielding and light scattering, affecting the light transmittance in solution. Furthermore, photons could not be constantly pumped into the photocatalytic particles and may have accelerated the electron\u2013hole recombination.48,49 As a result, with an excessive amount of dosage, the photocatalytic\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 3326\u20133335 | 3329\nCatalyst based-nanomaterials Visible light-source Pollutants Deg. % Time (min) Ref.\nTiO2 QDs 300 W xenon lamp Methyl orange N/A P25 (0.025) 41 TiO2\u2013Au NCs@b-CD UV Methyl orange 98% 40 42 CuWO4 Xenon lamp Methylene blue 80% 30 43 TiO2/GSH\u2013AgNC 200 W quartz Rhodamine B 60% 380 44 PTCA/capt-AgNC 50 W LED Malachite green 80% 52 45 H3PMO12O40/polymer LED@375 Erythrosine B 81% 120 46 MoS2-rGO-Fe2O3 500 W LED MB 36% 80 47 TiO2-rGO Visible RhB 81% 320 69 g-C3N4 Visible RhB \u2014 30 70 Znln2S4 Visible CR \u2014 300 71 CdS/ZnS Visible MB 70% 360 72 La-doped Bi2O3 Visible CF 89% 120 73 Ag NCs Solar light Erythrosine B 94.6% 30 This work Rhodamine B 84.1% 30 Ag NCs 50 W LED Erythrosine B 78.6% 60 This work\nRhodamine B 67.9% 60\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As a result and as shown in Fig. 4A and B, 20mg L\u22121 of Ag NCs was chosen for further investigation.\n3.3.2. Solution pH. The most important rule in the photodegradation process is pH value. NaOH and HCl were used to adjust the pH of the solution. The rate of photodegradation of erythrosine B dye with Ag NCs was investigated. The photocatalytic dye degradation rates of GSH@Ag NCs were 30.00%, 71.78%, 78.56%, 93.99%, 90.12%, 85.39%, 80.01%, and 73.87% at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0, respectively. The highest degradation rate for both dyes was noted at pH 7, with degradation percentages of 94.60 and 85.1%, respectively. The highest degradation efficiency was thus achieved at neutral pH (pH 7). This was likely due to the negatively charged surface caused by hydroxide ion adsorption enhancing the production of OHc, and hence increasing the photodegradation efficiency. As a result, the Ag NCs had good stability and strong catalytic efficacy at pH 7.50 The pH solutions with much more acidic and basic levels showed a lower rate of degradation, as shown in Fig. 5A and B.\nCurrently, new nanomaterials are being developed as effective photocatalysts that can work under visible light rather than\n3330 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 3326\u20133335\nultraviolet light.

ANOVA was used to determine the important and interaction effects of the factors that substantially inuence the dye photodegradation efficiency.\nSeveral residual plots were used to test the proposed model. In a number probability plot, it should generally form a straight line to indicate a normal distribution. In the case of departure points in the plot, the assumption may be invalid. If we look at the normal probability plot and the large sized blue points, they show a row of six at the same value, as shown in Fig. 6. Notice that this occurred in another place on the chart where two were at the same value. This graph suggested an increase in the linear relationship among the samples. Hence, the values which are closed to the horizontal line can be predicted well, while those which are above the line are unpredictable, and those below the line tend to be overpredicted.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

If the point lines are far from majority of points, they may be outliers. If the spread pattern of the residual value tends to increase as the tted value increases, this could be the constant variance assumption. Versus ts values performed in x axis. When the variance is constant and a non-linear relationship arises, the residual is determined or explained in respect to the tted values (this supports the claim that the residual ensure variance). As the residuals, which are around the 0 line, \u2018bounce randomly\u2019, they clearly present the assumption of a linear and practical relationship. The residuals formed in the horizontal band around the zero line reect the error term of the variance, and the fundamental random stand out of residuals expressing no outliers.\nA histogram was utilized to determine whether the variance was normally distributed, as shown in Fig. 6. A symmetric bellshaped histogram was found evenly distributed around the zero, indicating the normality assumption was likely to be true. The histogram graph also shows that the histogram matched a normal distribution, and the residuals were normally distributed. This describes the overall characteristics of the residual's value, speed, and shape. The sided tail may show a skewed distribution. Further, no bars in the histogram are far from other, which showed a lack of outliers."

The full-scan spectra exposed that Ti, O, and Ag elements were present, and also S was present in the Ag NCs as shown (Fig. 7). The related high-resolution XPS spectra of the Ag NCs were used for an extensive investigation of the Ag 3d peaks. Ag was present on the surface of Ag NCs in the form of Ag+, as evidenced by the presence of two separate peaks with centers at 368 and 374 eV binding energies, corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 of Ag NCs, respectively. The positive charge of Ag arose from the intact thiolate ligands of silver nanoclusters and the presence of thiolate ligands. The S signals of Ag NCs in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 7B) further determined the presence of mercator ligands.54 The peaks centered at 162.9 eV corresponded well with the thiolates species, indicating the production of an S\u2013 Ag bond. Another signal at 168.5 eV could be attributed to sulfonates produced by X-ray beam driven thiolates oxidation.55 It should be noted that two peaks in Fig. 7A. Centered at 368 and 374 eV binding energies could be assigned to Ag0, showing that the core of the silver clusters was not coupled to thiolates, which may contribute to their photocatalytic activity.56\nNext, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to examine the morphology of Ag@GSH NCs. The SEM image of Ag@GSH NCs showed their morphological structure. Further, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) has been proved to be a useful technique for determining the chemical composition of nanocomposites.78 We thus used SEM and EDS mapping to investigate the microstructures and element distribution of the Ag@GSH NCs, as shown in Fig. 8A and B. The sample was composed of Ag and S elements. The results conrmed the fundamental composition of the synthesized material would be efficient for photocatalytic degradation.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the charge transport and separation.

The Ag NCs had the lowest electron-transfer resistance, according to EIS, which also conrmed that their photocurrent density was much higher.57\nThe optical properties of the Ag@GSHNCs were examined by UV-vis-diffuse reectance absorption spectroscopy (DRS). Fig. 10A depicts the UV absorption edges of Ag@GSH NCs with a band edge at 372 nm. However, the Ag@GSH NCs demonstrated greater absorption in the visible range from 450 to 550 nm, and the strength of absorption in the visible area exclusively depended on Ag absorption. The optical band gap energy of Ag@GSH NCs was 4.7 eV, as shown in Fig. 10B. As a result, we suggest that the Ag@GSH NCs possessed higher absorption visible-light performances and could show excellent photocatalytic efficiency in the visible range. The adsorption light performance of the obtained materials was thus exhibited, and good responses to visible light were found due to the ultrasmall size of the Ag@GSH NCs, which exhibited the strongest adsorption capabilities.58"

The unique properties of the ultrasmall GSH@Ag NCs, such as facileness for use with good solubility in aqueous medium andmore active sites due to their ultrasmall size, leads to their strong photocatalytic activity. We proposed the visible-light catalytic degradation of xanthene dyes under two different light sources (solar light and white LED light). A more efficient performance and shorter time duration was observed in the photodegradation under solar light as compared to the LED white-light. Under the solar light, the rate of degradation was investigated with different concentrations, and the highest rate of degradation was observed at 20 mg at pH 7.0, which showed best dye degradation capability. Further, this synthetic approach can be used in large-scale industrial wastewater purication. Atomically precise and ultrasmall size GSH@Ag NCs could offer highefficiency performances in many elds, including bio-medical, antimicrobial, antioxidant, tumor targeting, cancer treatment, and bio-sensing theranostics.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
