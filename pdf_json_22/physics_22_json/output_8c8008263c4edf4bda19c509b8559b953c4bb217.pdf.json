            "text": "Matter traveling through a wormhole\nKarina Calhoun, Brendan Fay, and Ben Kain Department of Physics, College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts 01610, USA\nWe revisit the numerical evolution of Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormholes, which are constructed with a massless real ghost scalar field. For our simulations, we have developed a new code based on the standard 3 + 1 foliation of spacetime. We confirm that, for the massless symmetric wormhole, a pulse of regular scalar field causes the wormhole throat to collapse and form an apparent horizon, while a pulse of ghost scalar field can cause the wormhole throat to expand. As a new result, we show that it is possible for a pulse of regular matter to travel through the wormhole and then to send a light signal back before the wormhole collapses. We also evolve pulses of matter traveling through massive asymmetric wormholes, which has not previously been simulated.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nConsiderable attention has been paid to the study of traversable wormholes ever since Morris and Thorne showed that a wormhole geometry in general relativity is possible with matter that violates the null energy condition [1\u20133]. A Morris-Thorne wormhole may be realized with a massless real ghost scalar field. By \u201cghost,\u201d we mean that the kinetic energy has the opposite sign compared to a \u201cregular\u201d scalar field. A static wormhole solution in this system was first discovered by Ellis [4]. The solution has zero mass and is symmetric across the wormhole throat. The solution was generalized by Bronnikov [5] to a family of static solutions which are generically massive and asymmetric, with the Ellis solution being a special case. Recent work on such wormholes includes Refs. [6\u201318].\nAs far as we are aware, all numerical simulations of wormholes [19\u201325] have focused on the Ellis-BronnikovMorris-Thorne solutions. Shinkai and Hayward simulated pulses of regular and ghost scalar fields traveling through the massless symmetric wormhole [19]. Their code was based upon a dual-null formalism [26]. Gonza\u0301lez et al. studied both the massless symmetric and massive asymmetric wormholes [20]. They did not simulate a field traveling through the wormhole, but instead considered a perturbation applied directly to one of the metric fields. The numerical formalism of Gonza\u0301lez et al. bears similarities to the 3 + 1 formalism we use here, but they did not incorporate the extrinsic curvature. Doroshkevich et al. [21] extended the work of [19] and, like [19], focused on the massless symmetric wormhole and used a dual-null formalism, as did subsequent studies [24, 25]. Shinkai and Torii used the dual-null formalism to study higher-dimensional versions of the massless symmetric wormhole in the context of Einstein-GaussBonnet gravity [22, 23].\nIn this work, we numerically simulate regular and ghost scalar fields traveling through both the massless symmetric and massive asymmetric wormholes. For our simulations, we have developed a new code based on the standard 3+1 foliation of spacetime [27, 28]. Using our code, we confirm results found in [19]. In particular, we confirm that a pulse of regular scalar field traveling through\nthe massless symmetric wormhole causes the throat to collapse and form an apparent horizon, as does a pulse of ghost scalar field with negative amplitude, while a pulse of ghost scalar field with positive amplitude causes the throat to expand. As a new result, we show that it is possible for a pulse of regular field to travel through the wormhole and then to send a light signal back before the wormhole collapses. We also study matter traveling through massive asymmetric wormholes, which has not previously been simulated. Such wormholes are not stationary, but move. We find again that a pulse of regular scalar field causes the wormhole throat to collapse and form an apparent horizon and a pulse of ghost scalar field can cause the wormhole throat to expand.\nIn the next section, we briefly describe the 3+1 formalism and present the equations we will be using. These include equations for both the metric and matter fields. In Sec. III, we consider the static limit of these equations and review the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne solutions for static wormholes. We then describe adding a pulse of regular or ghost scalar field and how we use these solutions as initial data for our simulations. In Sec. IV, we briefly describe aspects of our numerical code. We present our results for the massless symmetric wormhole in Sec. V and for massive asymmetric wormholes in Sec. VI. We conclude in Sec. VII. In an appendix, we present tests of our code."

A and C parametrize the spatial metric, where A tells us about the physical distance between coordinates and C is the squared areal radius. We define\nR \u2261 \u221a C (2)\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n04 90\n5v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 9\nN ov\n2 02\n2\nas the areal radius, so that the area of a two-sphere is 4\u03c0R2. \u03b1 is the lapse and \u03b2r is the only nonzero component of the shift vector. As we move from one time slice to the next, \u03b1 tells us the rate at which proper time increases and \u03b2r tells us how the coordinates shift. Both \u03b1 and \u03b2r are gauge functions, in that once initial data are loaded onto the initial time slice \u03b1 and \u03b2r can, in principle, be chosen arbitrarily. In addition to these fields, there is the intrinsic curvature, Kij , which describes how a time slice sits in the larger spacetime. The only nonzero and independent components of the extrinsic curvature are Krr and KT \u2261 2K\u03b8\u03b8 = 2K \u03c6 \u03c6 . All quantities are functions of t and r.\nIn a wormhole geometry, r is not restricted to be nonnegative, but instead takes values \u2212\u221e < r < \u221e. If R is nonzero at its minimum, then there exists a wormhole throat which connects the two sides of the minimum. We define the wormhole throat radius to be\nRth(t) \u2261 R(t, rmin), (3)\nwhere, on a given time slice, R has its minimum at rmin. We use units such that c = G = ~ = 1.

Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormholes are constructed with a massless real ghost scalar field. As mentioned in the Introduction, \u201cghost\u201d means that the kinetic energy has the opposite sign compared to the kinetic energy of a \u201cregular\u201d scalar field. Since we are interested in sending a regular field through the wormhole, we will include both ghost and regular scalar fields. The Lagrangian for our matter sector is then\nL = \u2212\u03b7\u03c6 2 \u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2202 \u00b5\u03c6\u2212 \u03b7\u03c7 2 \u2202\u00b5\u03c7\u2202 \u00b5\u03c7.

(8)\nWe minimally couple the Lagrangian to gravity through L \u2192 \u221a \u2212det(g\u00b5\u03bd)L, from which the equations of motion and energy-momentum tensor follow straightforwardly. To write the equations of motion, we define the auxiliary fields\n\u03a6\u03c6 \u2261 \u2202r\u03c6 \u03a0\u03c6 \u2261 C \u221a A\n\u03b1 (\u2202t\u03c6\u2212 \u03b2r\u2202r\u03c6)\n\u03a6\u03c7 \u2261 \u2202r\u03c7 \u03a0\u03c7 \u2261 C \u221a A\n\u03b1 (\u2202t\u03c7\u2212 \u03b2r\u2202r\u03c7)\n(9)\nand the equations of motion are\n\u2202t\u03c6 = \u03b1\nC \u221a A \u03a0\u03c6 + \u03b2 r\u03a6\u03c6\n\u2202t\u03a6\u03c6 = \u2202r\n( \u03b1\nC \u221a A \u03a0\u03c6 + \u03b2 r\u03a6\u03c6 ) \u2202t\u03a0\u03c6 = \u2202r ( \u03b1C\u221a A \u03a6\u03c6 + \u03b2 r\u03a0\u03c6 ) (10)\nand\n\u2202t\u03c7 = \u03b1\nC \u221a A \u03a0\u03c7 + \u03b2 r\u03a6\u03c7\n\u2202t\u03a6\u03c7 = \u2202r\n( \u03b1\nC \u221a A \u03a0\u03c7 + \u03b2 r\u03a6\u03c7 ) \u2202t\u03a0\u03c7 = \u2202r ( \u03b1C\u221a A \u03a6\u03c7 + \u03b2 r\u03a0\u03c7 ) .\n(11)\nFrom the energy-momentum tensor, we have the matter functions\n\u03c1 = 1\n2A\n[ \u03b7\u03c6 ( \u03a02\u03c6 C2 + \u03a62\u03c6 ) + \u03b7\u03c7 ( \u03a02\u03c7 C2 + \u03a62\u03c7 )]\nSrr = 1\n2A\n[ \u03b7\u03c6 ( \u03a02\u03c6 C2 + \u03a62\u03c6 ) + \u03b7\u03c7 ( \u03a02\u03c7 C2 + \u03a62\u03c7 )]\nS\u03b8\u03b8 = 1\n2A\n[ \u03b7\u03c6 ( \u03a02\u03c6 C2 \u2212 \u03a62\u03c6 ) + \u03b7\u03c7 ( \u03a02\u03c7 C2 \u2212 \u03a62\u03c7 )]\nSr = \u2212 1\nC \u221a A (\u03b7\u03c6\u03a0\u03c6\u03a6\u03c6 + \u03b7\u03c7\u03a0\u03c7\u03a6\u03c7) ,\n(12)\nwhich follow from Eq. (6). The solution to the equations listed in this section give the numerical evolution of the system. Note that the fields \u03c6 and \u03c7 decouple and do not have to be determined. Instead, for matter fields, we need only determine \u03a6\u03c6, \u03a0\u03c6, \u03a6\u03c7, and \u03a0\u03c7.\nWe can use the solution to compute various quantities. For example, the Misner-Sharp mass function, m(t, r), in spherically symmetric systems is given by [27, 28]\nm = 1\n8 \u221a C\n[ 4C + (CKT ) 2 \u2212 (\u2202rC) 2\nA\n] . (13)\nThe ADM mass, M , is given by the large r limit of m. In a wormhole geometry, we can take r \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, and we should not expect the two limits to give the same value. Instead, the two limits give the total mass as viewed from either side of the wormhole.\nWe will be interested in whether an apparent horizon forms, which we will use as an indicator for a black hole. Apparent horizons satisfy [20, 27, 28]\nC \u221a AKT \u2213 \u2202rC = 0, (14)\nwhere we use the upper sign for r > rmin, where rmin marks the minimum of C, and the lower sign for r < rmin.\nFinally, we can compute null geodesics, rnull(t), which obey\ndrnull dt = \u00b1 \u03b1\u221a A \u2212 \u03b2r, (15)\nwhere we choose the sign depending on whether we want to compute a right-moving or left-moving geodesic.\nIII. INITIAL DATA\nTo numerically evolve the system, we must place initial data on the initial time slice. Our code can then evolve the initial data forward in time. Our initial data will include a wormhole and a pulse of ghost or regular matter.\nWe assume our initial data are time-symmetric, which sets \u03b2r = Kij = 0 [28]. Under this assumption, the Hamiltonian constraint in Eq. (5) and the KT evolution equation in Eq. (4) become\n\u22022rC = A+ (\u2202rA)(\u2202rC)\n2A +\n(\u2202rC) 2\n4C \u2212 8\u03c0AC\u03c1\n0 = 1 C \u2212 (\u2202r\u03b1)(\u2202rC) \u03b1AC \u2212 (\u2202rC)\n2\n4AC2 + 8\u03c0Srr , (16)\nthe evolution equations for Krr and KT in Eq. (4) can be combined to give\n\u22022r\u03b1 =\n( \u2202rA\n2A \u2212 \u2202rC C\n) \u2202r\u03b1+ 4\u03c0\u03b1A(\u03c1+ S), (17)\nand the Misner-Sharp mass function in (13) reduces to\nm =\n\u221a C\n2\n[ 1\u2212 (\u2202rC) 2\n4AC\n] .

By static, we mean that spacetime is time independent, which can be achieved by assuming \u03c6 is time independent. The ghost field equations of motion in (10) reduce to\n0 = \u2202r ( \u03b1C\u221a A \u03a6\u03c6 ) (19)\nand the matter functions in (12) reduce to\n\u03c1 = Srr = \u2212S\u03b8\u03b8 = \u03b7\u03c6 \u03a62\u03c6 2A , (20)\nalong with Sr = 0.

For \u03b1 = 1/ \u221a A, the top equation in (16) is unchanged, while the bottom equation and Eq.

Plugging in C = A(r20 + r 2), the result can be solved for A:\nA(r) = A2 exp [ \u22122A1 tan\u22121(r/r0) ] , (23)\nwhere A1 and A2 are arbitrary integration constants. A cancels out in Eq. (19) after using (21) and the result can be solved for \u03a6\u03c6:\n\u03a6\u03c6 = \u03c61 r0\nr20 + r 2 , (24)\nwhich can be integrated to give \u03c6(r) = \u03c61 tan \u22121(r/r0) + \u03c62, where \u03c61 and \u03c62 are arbitrary integration constants. We now fix some of the integration constants. For our static wormhole solutions, the metric is given by\nds2 = \u2212 1 A dt2 +Adr2 +A(r20 +r 2)(d\u03b82 +sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62). (25)\nWe require spacetime to be asymptotically flat. A look at the metric suggests that this can be accomplished by requiring A\u2192 1 in the large r limit. However, from Eq. (23) we have\nlim r\u2192\u00b1\u221e\nA(r) = A2e \u2213A1\u03c0, (26)\nwhich indicates that, unless A1 = 0, we can have A\u2192 1 on only one side of the wormhole at a time. A simple rescaling,\nt\u2192 \u221a \u03bb t, r \u2192 r\u221a\n\u03bb , r0 \u2192 r0\u221a \u03bb , A\u2192 \u03bbA,\n(27) where \u03bb is a positive constant, leaves the metric unchanged. For \u03bb = e\u00b1A1\u03c0/A2, the \u00b1 side has A \u2192 1, which shows that, in fact, both sides of the wormhole are asymptotically flat for any non-negative value for A2. Following Ref. [20], we choose\nA2 = 1. (28)\nPlugging our results into the top equation in (16) leads to\n\u03c61 =\n\u221a \u22121 +A 2 1\n4\u03c0\u03b7\u03c6 . (29)\nIn addition to determining \u03c61, this equation explains why it is a ghost field, with \u03b7\u03c6 = \u22121, that is required to find a wormhole solution.\nIt is now a simple matter to show that the areal radius, R = \u221a C, has a minimum at\nrmin = A1r0 (30)\nand that the wormhole throat radius is given by\nRth = R(rmin) = r0 \u221a A2(1 +A21) e \u2212A1 tan\u22121(A1). (31)\nFor positive A2, Rth > 0 and we have a wormhole solution.\nWe have constructed a family of analytical static wormhole solutions. The solutions are identified by the constant A1, which immediately determines the constant \u03c61 from Eq. (29). These constants then determine \u03b1, A, C, and \u03a6\u03c6 from Eqs. (21), (23), and (24). We note that it is straightforward to show that these solutions satisfy the bottom equation in (22), as required. Using the solutions in the Misner-Sharp mass function in (18) and then taking the large r limit, we find the total mass on both sides of the wormhole,\nM\u00b1 = lim r\u2192\u00b1\u221e\nm(r) = \u00b1A1r0 ( A2e \u2213A1\u03c0 )1/2\n= \u00b1A1r0e\u2213A1\u03c0/2, (32)\nwhere we used (28) in the bottom line. For A1 = 0, we have the massless symmetric wormhole. Nonzero values of A1 describe massive asymmetric wormholes."

            "text": "We will numerically simulate a pulse of regular or ghost scalar field traveling though the wormhole, using a Gaussian shape for the pulse. For the regular field, we use\n\u03a6\u03c7(0, r) = \u03b5\u03c7e \u2212(r\u2212r\u03c7)2/\u03c32\u03c7 , (33)\nwhere \u03b5\u03c7, r\u03c7, and \u03c3\u03c7 are constants that describe the amplitude, center, and spread of the pulse. Further, we assume the pulse is initially at rest, which sets \u03a0\u03c7(0, r) = 0. This pulse represents a spherical shell of regular massless scalar field. As the pulse begins stationary, it will split into an ingoing piece that heads toward the wormhole and an outgoing piece that heads away from the wormhole. Of course, our focus is with the ingoing piece.\nFor a pulse of massless ghost scalar field, we use\n\u03a6\u03c6(0, r) = \u03c61 r0\nr20 + r 2\n+ \u03b5\u03c6e \u2212(r\u2212r\u03c6)2/\u03c32\u03c6 , (34)\nwhere the first term represents the wormhole, as described in the previous subsection, and the second term is analogous to Eq. (33). We take \u03a0\u03c6(0, r) = 0.\nThe metric functions A and C must be consistent with the matter functions \u03a6\u03c6, \u03a0\u03c6, \u03a6\u03c7, and \u03a0\u03c7. We have in mind a matter pulse heading toward and traveling through a previously formed wormhole. In this sense, the matter pulse can be thought of as a perturbation to the wormhole. To model this, we assume the region near the wormhole throat, i.e. near rmin where the areal radius R has its minimum, is unaffected by the pulse on the initial time slice. Since rmin will be near r = 0, we keep A(0), A\u2032(0), C(0), and C \u2032(0) equal to their values in the absence of a pulse and, using these values, obtain A and C by numerically integrating the top equations in (16) and (22) outward from r = 0.\nThe equations are independent of the sign of \u03be\u03c7, and without loss of generality, we take \u03be\u03c7 to be positive. This is not the case for \u03be\u03c6, because of the first term in Eq. (34). In Secs. V and VI, we present results using r\u03c6, r\u03c7 = 3.0r0 and \u03c3\u03c6, \u03c3\u03c7 = 0.25r0. We have found that other values lead to qualitatively similar results. For amplitudes we use \u03be\u03c6, \u03be\u03c7 = 0 or 0.002/r0. If the amplitude is too large, the pulse can form a black hole. Aside from this, and as long as \u03be\u03c6 is non-negative, we have found that other values lead to qualitatively similar results. Although we do not show results for negative values of \u03be\u03c6, we have run such simulations and will discuss them below."

The remaining fields, except for \u03b1 and possibly \u03b2r, are set to zero. As mentioned, \u03b1 and \u03b2r are gauge fields and can be set arbitrarily. We choose to keep \u03b2r(t, r) = 0 throughout the simulation. For our time slicing condition we primarily use\n\u03b1(t, r) = \u221a A(t, r). (35)\nThis slicing condition was shown to work well in Ref. [20], though it was also shown not to have strong singularity avoidance properties. We comment on this and briefly consider different slicing conditions in the next two sections.\nThe next step is to numerically solve the equations listed in Sec. II. To do this, we discretize both space and time. Our spatial grid has uniform spacing \u2206r and includes r = 0 and our temporal grid has uniform time step \u2206t. We have some choice in which equations to solve. A straightforward possibly is to exclusively use evolution equations and solve Eqs. (4), (10), and (11). Alternatively, we could make use of the constraint equations in (5). Typically, the use of constraint equations improves numerical stability. To use constraint equations, the value of the field must be known somewhere on a time slice.\nIn our code, we use the evolution equation forKT in (4) to evolve KT from time step n to time step n+1. We then choose one value for KT on time step n+ 1, typically at r = 0, and use it to solve the momentum constraint in (5) for KT . The actual KT values we use at time step n+ 1 are those obtained from the momentum constraint. We have found that this greatly improves numerical stability. We could implement something similar for C using the Hamiltonian constraint, but do not do so.\nWe solve the evolution equations using the method of lines, in which we finite difference spatial derivatives and solve time derivatives using third-order Runge-Kutta. For those evolution equations that contain spatial derivatives, we use simple outgoing spherical wave boundary conditions\n(\u2202t \u00b1 \u2202r)(rf) = 0, (36)\nwith the upper sign for the positive outer boundary and the lower sign for the negative outer boundary, where f is the field. For those evolution equations that do not contain spatial derivatives, we solve the evolution equation all the way up to the outer boundary. We place the outer boundary at r/r0 = \u00b1100, which is sufficiently far away that reflections are negligible.\nIn our simulations, we use time step \u2206t = 0.5\u2206r and scale\nt\u2192 r0t, r \u2192 r0r, C \u2192 r20C, (37)\nalong with r\u03c6,\u03c7 \u2192 r0r\u03c6,\u03c7, \u03c3\u03c6,\u03c7 \u2192 r0\u03c3\u03c6,\u03c7, and \u03be\u03c6,\u03c7 \u2192 \u03be\u03c6,\u03c7/r0 which is equivalent to setting r0 = 1. In the Appendix we present various code tests and show that our code is second order convergent. We do this by evolving the system using different grid spacings, \u2206r.

            "heading": "V. MASSLESS SYMMETRIC WORMHOLE",
            "text": "In this section, we present results for the numerical evolution of the massless symmetric wormhole, which is defined by A1 = 0. In Fig. 1, we show results for the evolution of a pulse of regular scalar field, \u03a6\u03c7 (black curve), and the areal radius, R (blue curve). The horizontal dotted line, which is the same in each plot, marks the initial value of the wormhole throat, Rth, and helps us to see if the throat expands or collapses. The pulse begins at t = 0 as a Gaussian and then splits into an inward traveling piece and outward traveling piece. This is expected and is standard for a scalar field in spherical symmetry. Our focus is on the inward traveling piece, which we can see traveling through the wormhole, i.e traveling from one side of rmin = 0 to the other side, in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). Interestingly, we see in Fig. 1(c) that some matter gets caught in the wormhole. This matter stays in the wormhole as the piece that traveled through continues traveling leftward away from the wormhole, as seen in Figs. 1(d) and 1(e). Starting in Fig. 1(d), we show the location of an apparent horizon with the vertical dotted lines. The coordinates of the apparent horizon are seen to expand in Fig. 1(e). Also starting in Fig. 1(d), we see the collapsing of the wormhole, since Rth decreases, which continues in Fig. 1(e).\nFor the same evolution shown in Fig. 1, we show in Fig. 2(a) the wormhole throat radius Rth as a function of time as the solid black curve. We can see more clearly how the wormhole throat is collapsing. In Fig. 2(b), the vertical line plots rmin, the location of the wormhole throat. We plot rmin until the formation of the apparent horizon, which is shown by the blue curve.\nWe now consider sending a ghost pulse through the wormhole using the initial data in (34). Ideally, we would present a plot analogous to Fig. 1. Unfortunately, this is not possible since \u03a6\u03c6 is dominated by the wormhole\ncontribution and we cannot extract out the pulse. For a ghost pulse with positive amplitude, we find that the wormhole throat expands, as shown by the purple dashed curve in Fig. 2(a), and that no apparent horizon forms. On the other hand, for a ghost pulse with negative amplitude, which we do not show, we find that the wormhole throat collapses. The reason for this is that the negative amplitude shrinks the initial magnitude of \u03a6\u03c6, which increases the initial energy density (since the ghost field has negative energy density), just as a regular pulse does.\nIn general, when a pulse of regular scalar field is sent through the wormhole, we find that the wormhole collapses and an apparent horizon forms. When a pulse of ghost field with negative amplitude is sent through, we find the same, while for a pulse of ghost field with posi-\ntive amplitude we find that the wormhole expands and no apparent horizon forms. This is true even for relatively weak pulses. This suggests that the massless symmetric wormhole, which has been shown to be linearly unstable with a single unstable mode [30], sits right at the transition between expansion and collapse to a black hole.\nThe results presented so far in this section are consistent with those in Ref. [19]. However, we find the plots in Fig. 1 to be particularly intuitive and a fascinating depiction of matter traveling through a wormhole. Such plots follow straightforwardly from results computed using the 3 + 1 formalism and we feel that such plots are a benefit of the 3+1 formalism that are worth mentioning.\nWith the slicing condition \u03b1 = \u221a A, our code is unable to evolve the system for too long after the formation of an apparent horizon. The reason for this is that this slicing condition is unable to avoid the singularity that forms. It is possible to use singularity avoiding slicing conditions that can continue the evolution further [27, 28]. They accomplish this by decreasing \u03b1 in regions where the singularity will form so that the evolution is slowed or ceases in this region, but continues elsewhere. Since the formation of the apparent horizon is accompanied by the collapse of the wormhole throat, it might be possible to avoid the singularity by tying \u03b1 to the metric field C, since R = \u221a C. Indeed, the slicing condition\n\u03b1(t, r) = \u221a A(t, r) C(t, r)\nr20 + r 2\n(38)\nwas shown to have strong singularity avoidance properties in [20]. We too have found that this slicing condition works well for the massless symmetric wormhole and we use it for the following results.\nThat regular matter leads to the collapse of the wormhole has led to the speculation that once a traveler passes through the wormhole, they will be unable to return. It was shown in [19] that sending a second pulse of ghost matter after the first pulse of regular matter could keep the wormhole open. We consider a different possibility. We imagine sending a probe, made of regular matter,\nthrough the wormhole and ask if the probe can send a signal back through the wormhole.\nIn Fig. 3, we show an evolution using the same initial data as used in Fig. 1, but using the slicing condition in Eq. (38). The vertical line at the bottom plots rmin, the position of the wormhole throat, and the blue curve plots the apparent horizon. This is the same thing plotted in Fig. 2(b), but the new slicing condition is able to evolve the system further in time. The thick black curve plots the position of the regular matter traveling through the wormhole. More specifically, it plots the position of the peak of the leftmost spike in Fig. 1. The remaining (green) curves are null geodesics, computed using Eq. (15). The null geodesics represent the path taken by a light signal emitted by our regular matter probe. We can see that some of the light signals easily make it through the wormhole, some just barely make it, and a couple get caught inside the black hole. Figure 3 shows us it is possible for the probe to send signals back through the wormhole before the wormhole collapses.\nWe end this section by commenting that in this wormhole geometry, since null geodesics are in some cases able to pass through the apparent horizon in Fig. 3, the existence of an apparent horizon on a given time slice does not necessarily mean that there is an event horizon on the same time slice. This phenomenon was seen in [20], whose analysis suggests that the apparent horizon asymptotically agrees with the event horizon. We refer the reader to [20] for a discussion."

            "text": "In this section, we present results for the numerical evolution of massive asymmetric wormholes, which are defined by A1 6= 0. Recall from Eq. (30) that the wormhole throat begins at rmin = A1 (for r0 = 1). In the previous section, we found that the wormhole throat stays at r = 0. Here, we find that massive wormholes move. For positive A1 the throat moves rightward, while for negative A1 it moves leftward. Beyond that, we find that the massive case is similar to the massless case: When a pulse of regular matter travels through the wormhole, the wormhole throat collapses and forms an apparent horizon. For a pulse of ghost matter with negative amplitude it does the same, while for a pulse of ghost matter with positive amplitude it expands and does not form an apparent horizon.\nIn Fig. 4, we show results for the evolution of a pulse of regular scalar field, \u03a6\u03c7 (black curve), and the areal radius, R (blue curve). The top row is for A1 = 0.1 and the bottom row is for A1 = 0.3. This figure is analogous to Fig. 1 for the massless wormhole. We can see that the wormhole throat travels rightward and that the pulse of regular matter leads to collapse and the formation of an apparent horizon. We can also see that as we increase A1, more matter gets stuck in the wormhole. This can be seen by the larger amplitude for the piece that gets stuck and the smaller amplitude for the piece that travels through.\nThe same two evolutions shown in Fig. 4 are shown in Fig. 5, which is analogous to Fig. 2. In Fig. 5(a), the two black curves, from bottom to top, are for A1 = 0.1 and 0.3, and display how the wormhole throat collapses. In Fig. 5(b), the two black curves display rmin and, from left to right, are for A1 = 0.1 and 0.3. The blue curves display apparent horizons. For a pulse of ghost matter with positive amplitude, we find that the wormhole expands. This is shown by the two dashed purple curves in Fig. 2(a) which, from bottom to top, are for A1 = 0.1 and 0.3. We have also simulated pulses of ghost matter with negative amplitude, which we do not show, and find that the wormhole throat collapses and forms an apparent horizon.\nWe now consider negative A1. We show in Fig. 6 a plot similar to Figs. 1 and 4 for a pulse of regular matter traveling through a wormhole with A1 = \u22120.1. We can see that the pulse is still able to make it through the wormhole, even though the wormhole is initially moving away from it. We again find, for a pulse of regular matter, that the wormhole throat collapses.\nLastly, we consider sending a probe of regular matter through a massive asymmetric wormhole and ask if the probe can send a light signal back through the wormhole. In the previous section, when answering this question for the massless wormhole, we used the singularity avoiding slicing condition in Eq. (38). Unfortunately, we have not found that this slicing condition works well for the mas-\nsive case. Instead, we have had success with \u03b1(t, r) = \u221a A(t, r) [ 1\u2212 e\u2212C(t,r) ] , (39)\nas long as A1 is not too large. In Fig. 7, we show an evolution using the same initial data as the top row of Fig. 4 and the left curve in Fig. 5(b), but using the slicing condition in Eq. (39). Figure 7 is analogous to Fig. 3 and shows that it is possible for a probe to send signals back through a massive asymmetric wormhole before it collapses."

            "text": "Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormholes are spherically symmetric analytical solutions for static wormholes constructed with a massless real ghost scalar field. They are generically massive and asymmetric, with a massless symmetric wormhole as a special case. As far as we are aware, they are the only wormholes to have been numerically evolved. We revisited their numerical evolution, developing a new code based on the standard 3+1 foliation of spacetime. Although we focused on Ellis-BronnikovMorris-Thorne wormholes, we believe our code could be used more broadly for simulating wormhole geometries.\nFor the massless wormhole, we confirmed that a pulse of regular scalar field causes the wormhole to collapse and form an apparent horizon. For a pulse of ghost scalar field with negaitive amplitude we found the same, while for a pulse with positive amplitude we found that it causes the wormhole throat to expand and not form an apparent horizon. We then showed that a pulse of regular matter can travel through the wormhole and send a light signal back before the wormhole collapses. For a pulse of matter traveling through a massive wormhole, which had not previously been simulated, we again found that regular matter causes the wormhole to collapse and form an apparent horizon, as does a pulse of ghost matter with negative amplitude, while ghost matter with a positive amplitude causes the wormhole throat to expand. We further showed that the wormhole moves, but that the pulse is still able to travel through it and that a pulse of regular matter can again send a light signal back through the wormhole before it collapses."

            "text": "In this appendix, we present tests of our code and show that our code is second order convergent. In Sec. IV, we discussed how our code solves for KT using the momentum constraint and that we do not make use of the Hamiltonian constraint, both of which are in Eq. (5). The Hamiltonian constraint is therefore available for code testing. Specifically, since we solve an evolution equation for the metric field C, we can check to see if the result for C satisfies the Hamiltonian constraint on each time slice, as it must. We therefore compute [27]\nrms(Cevo \u2212 Ccon), (A1)\nwhere Cevo is the value of C obtained from the evolution equation, Ccon is the value of C obtained from the Hamil-\ntonian constraint, and rms means to take the root-meansquare across the computational grid. We compute this quantity with various grid spacings, \u2206r. An indication of second order convergence is that this quantity drops by a factor of 4 when the grid spacing drops by a factor of 2 [27].\nWe can also test our code without using a constraint equation as follows. We define the convergence function [27]\nC\u2206r1,\u2206r2f \u2261 \u2016f \u2206r1 evo \u2212 f\u2206r2evo \u2016, (A2)\nwhere f is an arbitrary field, f\u2206r1evo indicates the field as obtained from an evolution equation using grid spacing \u2206r1, and \u2016 means to take the L2 norm across the computational grid. Note that f\u2206r1evo and f \u2206r2 evo must be compared at a grid point and time step common to both simulations. Using three different grid spacings, we can compute C\u2206r1,\u2206r2f and C \u2206r2,\u2206r3 f . For \u2206r1/\u2206r2 = 2 and \u2206r2/\u2206r3 = 2, an indication of second order convergence is that C\u2206r1,\u2206r2f /C \u2206r2,\u2206r3 f = 4 [27].\nWe show some results in Fig. 8 using the same initial data used to compute the dashed purple curve in Fig. 2(a) (i.e. a pulse of ghost matter with positive amplitude traveling through the massless symmetric wormhole). The grid spacings used to make all three plots in Fig. 8 are \u2206r = 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, and 0.00125. In all three plots, neighboring curves drop by a factor of 4, indicating second order convergence. We show in Fig. 9 an analogous plot but using the same initial data used to compute the bottom row of Fig. 4 (i.e. a pulse of regular matter traveling through a massive asymmetric wormhole). We again find that neighboring curves drop by a factor of 4, indicating second order convergence. We also find that the curves rise at later times, which is not unexpected since a black hole forms and the code eventually loses numerical stability. We find similar results for other fields and for other simulations.\n[1] M. S. Morris and K. S.
