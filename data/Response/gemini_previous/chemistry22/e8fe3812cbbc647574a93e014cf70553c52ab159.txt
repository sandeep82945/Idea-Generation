1. **Investigate the use of DNA nanotechnology to create plasmonic biosensors for the detection of specific proteins or nucleic acids.** This could be done by designing DNA origami structures that are functionalized with aptamers or other biorecognition elements that can bind to the target molecule. The plasmonic properties of the DNA origami structure could then be used to generate a signal that is proportional to the concentration of the target molecule.


2. **Explore the use of DNA nanotechnology to create plasmonic biosensors that can be used for multiplexed detection of multiple analytes.** This could be done by designing DNA origami structures that are functionalized with multiple different aptamers or other biorecognition elements. The plasmonic properties of the DNA origami structure could then be used to generate a signal that is proportional to the concentration of each analyte.


3. **Investigate the use of DNA nanotechnology to create plasmonic biosensors that can be used for in vivo imaging.** This could be done by designing DNA origami structures that are functionalized with fluorescent dyes or other imaging agents. The plasmonic properties of the DNA origami structure could then be used to enhance the signal from the imaging agent, making it possible to visualize the target molecule in vivo.


4. **Explore the use of DNA nanotechnology to create plasmonic biosensors that can be used for point-of-care diagnostics.** This could be done by designing DNA origami structures that are functionalized with aptamers or other biorecognition elements that can bind to the target molecule. The plasmonic properties of the DNA origami structure could then be used to generate a signal that is proportional to the concentration of the target molecule. The biosensor could then be integrated into a portable device that could be used for point-of-care diagnostics.


5. **Investigate the use of DNA nanotechnology to create plasmonic biosensors that can be used for environmental monitoring.** This could be done by designing DNA origami structures that are functionalized with aptamers or other biorecognition elements that can bind to specific pollutants. The plasmonic properties of the DNA origami structure could then be used to generate a signal that is proportional to the concentration of the pollutant. The biosensor could then be integrated into a monitoring system that could be used to track the levels of pollutants in the environment.
