 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different substituents on the hemicurcuminoid structure on its spectral properties and sensing abilities when incorporated into vesicles. The nonyl substituent provided good incorporation into the vesicles, but other substituents may give different properties.

2. Explore the use of other polymerizable diacetylene monomers besides 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid to form the PDA vesicles. Different monomers could alter the vesicle properties and HCur interactions. 

3. Test the sensing abilities of the HCur-PDA vesicles with a wider range of heavy metal ions and biomolecules. This could reveal selectivity for other important analytes besides Cd2+, Pb2+ and polylysine.

4. Study the effect of incorporating multiple fluorescent dyes along with HCur into the vesicles. The interactions between multiple dyes could provide enhanced or more selective sensing.

5. Investigate covalent attachment methods to anchor HCur within the vesicle membranes. This could give better control over HCur localization to optimize its sensing performance.
