            "text": "In this work, we introduce a novel observation model for estimating the instantaneous frequency of modes of Multicomponent Signal (MCS) in the presence of an arbitrary distributed noise. For this purpose, we use the signal spectrogram defined as the squared modulus of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and consider the 1D signals observed by selecting a given time instant of the spectrogram. While performing parameters estimation using classical algorithms such as [14] is challenging in the presence of noise, more methods assuming the presence of spurious content [1, 2, 8, 9] achieve satisfactory estimation performance until average to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). However these methods are generally made to deal with the presence of Gaussian noise and do not address the estimation problem in more complex scenarios (Poisson or gamma noise, mixture of noise). Here, we develop a method in a Bayesian framework for estimating the modes Instantaneous Frequency (IF) where a mixture model is used to account for the presence of both the signal components and an arbitrary distributed noise. Prior models are associated with the parameters to model the available a priori knowledge. An adapted estimation strategy is then formulated through a Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm [3,12] to avoid intractable joint parameters estimation from the posterior distribution and to deal with the Markovian nature of the prior models. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the observation model and the prior distributions associated with the model parameters. We then discuss the estimation strategy in Section 3, and comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed method in Section 4 with numerical results. Conclusions and future work are finally reported in Section 5."

Let S = {|F \u03b8x |2}n,m be the spectrogram of x. We denote the RM\u00d71 spectrogram columns as sn = [sn,0, . . . , sn,M\u22121]>, with S = {sn}Nn=1. In this work, we are interested in estimating the ridge positions m\u0302n = [m\u03021n, . . . , m\u0302 K n ] > associated with the IF \u03c6\u2032n = { d\u03c6k dn (n)} K k=1, \u2200n \u2208 [0, N \u2212 1]. For that purpose, we assume the following observation model:\np(sn,m|wn, m\u0302n) = K\u2211 k=1 wkng(m\u2212 m\u0302kn) + 1 M\n( 1\u2212\nK\u2211 k=1 wkn\n) , (3)\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n16 33\n4v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nP] 2\n8 M\nar 2\n02 2\nwhere g(m) = 2 \u221a \u03c0L M e \u2212( 2\u03c0mLM ) 2\nis the normalized and discretized squared modulus of the Fourier transform of \u03b8, such that (s.t.) the integral of g remains constant over the admissible values of m\u0302n. In (3), the weight wkn represents the probability of each element of sn to belong to the kth component s.t. wn,k =\nakn\u2211K k=1 a k n+Mbn , with bn the average noise\namplitude at time n. Conversely, (1 \u2212 \u2211K k=1 w k n) is the probability to observe noise in sn. Note that the weights wn = [w1n, . . . , w K n ] > are constrained to belong to [0, 1]K s.t. \u2211 k w k n \u2264 1. For further development, we set W = {wn}N\u22121n=0 and M\u0302 = {m\u0302n}N\u22121n=0 . Assuming independence between each Time-Frequency (TF) instant conditioned on the value of (wn, m\u0302n), we express the joint likelihood function as\np(S|W ,M\u0302) = \u220f n \u220f m p(sn,m|wn, m\u0302n). (4)\nIn order to complete the Bayesian model, prior distributions have to be assigned to the model parameters to account for the a priori available knowledge [7]. First, a weak uniform prior model is associated with the elements ofW .\nTotal Variation In the presence of strong noise (low SNR), the ridges in the TF plane can be split or partially destroyed. It can thus be preferable for the IF estimates to not significantly move away from the estimation performed in the TF area with strong local maxima. We thus define the following Total Variation (TV) Markov Random Field (MRF) prior model for M\u0302 which preserves sharp edges [4, 15]\np(M\u0302| ) \u221d exp [ \u2212\nK\u2211 k=1 \u2016m\u0302>k,:\u2016TV\n] , (5)\nwith m\u0302k,: the kth row of M\u0302, a fixed user-defined hyper-parameter and \u2016x\u2016TV the sum of the absolute values of the partial derivatives of x.\nLaplacian Another possible choice for regularizing M\u0302 is to constrain the mean curvature of the estimated ridge, remaining to bound the IF second derivatives. This is performed using a MRF Laplacian prior model [13,16] by setting a `2-norm penalization on the curvature of M\u0302 as\np(M\u0302|\u03bb) \u221d exp [ \u2212\u03bb 2 K\u2211 k=1 \u2016Lam\u0302>k,:\u201622 ] , (6)\nwhereLa is the log-concave and differentiable Laplacian operator, s.t. \u2016Lax\u201622 is the sum of the squared partial derivatives of x. This operator controls the smoothness of the estimation. Similarly to the TV prior model, we assume \u03bb to be a fixed hyperparameter."

(9)\nWhile classical EM-based algorithms are well adapted to solve problems involving hidden parameters, performing the M-step is computationally intractable due to the Markovian nature of the prior models introduced in Eq.

More precisely, we simulate Ns samples {M\u03041, . . . ,M\u0304Ns} from p(M\u0302) using a 2-step Gibbs sampler as\nm\u0304n = argmax m\u0302n N\u22121\u2211 l=0,l 6=n p(m\u0302n|m\u0302l), (10)\nwith M\u0304 = {m\u0304n}N\u22121n=0 .

The convergence speed of the algorithm is increased by hot-starting the Gibbs sampler at each iteration using the previously generated samples. The two main steps of the EM algorithm become\nQ\u0302(W |W (i)) = log p(S|W ,M\u0303) + log [ p(M\u0302)p(W ) ] ,\nW (i+1) = argmax W\nQ\u0302(W |W (i)). (11)\nThe concavity of the likelihood in Eq.

Even though discarding 3 times the standard deviation \u03c3d = \u221a M/(\u03c0L) of the data distribution would be a good choice (three-sigma rule of thumb), the presence of slightly frequency modulated components [5] avoided proper discard of the information related to the last MMAP estimate.

The MCS depicted in Fig. 1 is made of two linear chirps overlapping at time index 225. For the experiments\nconducted in this section, we compute the STFT using the ASTRES toolbox [6], with N = 500 and L = 20. Moreover, an additive white Gaussian noise controlled through a SNR varying from -20 to 20 dB, is added to the MCS in order to model the presence of a spurious content. For comparison purpose, we select the pseudo-Bayesian (PB) approach proposed in [9], both the simple and spline Ridge Detector (RD) of [8] and the Brevdo method [1]. For the latter we keep the same hyperparameter values than that presented in [1]. For the proposed method, we set = 10\u22123, \u03bb = 10\u22122\nsince it provides the best performances during our experiments. Note however that those values have to be defined according to the TF resolution. For each method, we reconstruct the signals by selecting at each time instant in the Time-Frequency Representation (TFR), a neighborhood of 2 \u00d7 3\u03c3d + 1 frequency values centered around the estimated IF of each component. This ensures most of the ridges information to be encapsulated in informative ribbons. A hard threshold is then applied on the TFR and the TF instants outside of the ribbons are set to zeros value. The inverse STFT is finally applied on the hard thresholded TFR in order to compare the estimated signal to its ground truth. The estimation performance of the method is thus assessed using the Reconstruction Quality Factor (RQF): 10 log10 ( ||x||2 ||x\u2212x\u0302||2 ) where x (resp. x\u0302) stands for the reference (resp. estimated) signal.\nFrom Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we observe that the proposed approach using both prior models outperforms other at low SNR. The performance of the proposed method remains nonetheless similar to that of the spline RD [8] in Fig. 3. Note that the experiment, and more particularly the reconstruction of the TFR using a hard threshold, is not adapted to high SNR cases since we mostly discard informative content. The RQF is however adapted for low SNR scenarios, even though the TF content surrounding the estimated IF used to reconstruct the signals is also contaminated by noise. Both the TV and Laplacian prior models in the proposed approach provide similar performance, even though the TV prior perform better at high SNR (see Fig. 3)."

The presence of spurious content is approximated as a uniform distribution to allow the modelling of any additive noise. The model formulation is well suited for inference using EM algorithms, allowing to reduce the problem complexity and to estimate the mixture weights with a low computational time. The stochastic approach significantly lightens the computation of the E-step when using Markovian prior models. A sequential MMAP estimation is performed to account for the multimodal nature of the IF posterior distribution, even in scenarios involving overlapping ridges. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed inference method to outperform the competing approaches in the low SNR regime. Future work include an estimation of the modulation rate [5] by extending, for instance, the method into a generalized EM [12]. A more general estimation process accounting for the estimation of the hyperparameters is currently under investigation."
