Multiphase flowmeters (MPFMs) measure the flow rates of oil, gas, and brine in a pipeline. MPFMs provide remote access to real-time well production data that are essential for efficient oil field operations. Most MPFMs are complex systems requiring frequent maintenance. An MPFM that is operationally simple and accurate is highly sought after in the energy industry. This paper describes an MPFM that uses only pressure sensors to measure gas and liquid flow rates. The design is an integration of a previously developed densitometer with an innovative Venturi-type flowmeter. New computing models with strong analytical foundations were developed, aided by empirical correlations and machine-learning-based flow-regime identification. A prototype was experimentally validated in a multiphase flow loop over a wide range of field-like conditions. The accuracy of the MPFM was compared to that of other multiphase metering techniques from similar studies. The results point to a robust, practical MPFM. 1. conclusions A non-nuclear multiphase flowmeter was realized using only pressure sensors. A prototype was experimentally validated in a multiphase flow loop, demonstrating good accuracy over a wide range of gas and liquid flow rates. Flow-regime identification was one of the key elements in the calculation model. The study determined that the largest measurement deviations occurred at gas fractions in the range of 25â€“50%. Regardless, given its simple, reliable design, this technique has the potential to be a compelling choice for inline multiphase metering in oil-and-gas applications.
