 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the economic impact of chat-based search engines on website visibility and traffic. As these new search engines gain prominence, they may divert significant traffic toward websites they reference. Research could analyze resulting changes in website popularity, ad revenues, and broader economic outcomes. 

2. Investigate the development of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies tailored for chat-based search engines. Since they utilize different criteria for citing websites, new SEO approaches may emerge to boost visibility in chatbot results. Studying how website owners adapt SEO could reveal novel tactics.

3. Explore the effects of reduced information diversity in chatbot search results on users. With chatbots citing more similar websites, users may encounter less diverse perspectives. Research could examine impacts on decision-making, beliefs, and polarization.

4. Analyze the evolution of chatbot search criteria over time as models are retrained. Their preferences may shift as training data and methodology changes. Monitoring criteria could reveal patterns and aid alignment.

5. Develop enhanced techniques to interpret the inner workings of large language models. As chatbots rely increasingly on large models, better methods to explain their behavior could improve transparency and trust. This enables ongoing alignment.
