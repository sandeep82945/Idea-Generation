Materials and methods Patients admitted for proximal hypospadias treated with modified TPIF repair, the traditional TPIF procedure, or Byar\u2019s two-stage procedure at our institution from 2017 to 2021 were identified, and the incidence of postoperative complications among them was compared. Results In total, 142 patients were included (modified TPIF group, 43; traditional TPIF group, 37; and Byar\u2019s two-stage group, 62). The length of the neourethra was 4.21 \u00b1 0.63 cm in the modified TPIF group, 4.18 \u00b1 0.71 cm in the traditional TPIF group, and 4.20 \u00b1 0.68 cm in the Byar\u2019s two-stage group. The rate of urethral stricture in the modified TPIF group (two cases, 4.65%) was significantly lower than that in the traditional TPIF group (four cases, 10.81%) (P = 0.008). Seven (16.28%) cases of urethrocutaneous fistula occurred in the modified TPIF group, six (16.22%) in the traditional TPIF group, and eight (12.90%) in the two-stage group. Additionally, one case (2.33%) of urethral diverticulum occurred in the modified TPIF group, one (2.70%) in the traditional TPIF group, and three (4.84%) in Byar\u2019s two-stage group. Conclusions Modified TPIF repair can ensure a wedge anastomosis between the proximal urethral meatus and the neourethra, provide support and blood supply for the neourethra. Furthermore, it extended the urethral plate width at the anastomosis and urethral meatus, effectively reducing the incidence of urethral strictures.",

            "text": "Proximal hypospadias poses a significant challenge to urologists. It has spawned nearly a 100 surgical methods over time. However, the prognosis of patients with proximal hypospadias remains unsatisfactory compared to distal hypospadias [1, 2]. Although many surgeons use a two-stage procedure to improve the success rate, several studies have shown that the outcome of a two-stage procedure is not\nnecessarily better than that of a one-stage procedure [3, 4]. Specifically, a one-stage procedure can effectively shorten the treatment period and reduce the economic and psychological burden on patients and families. Therefore, it is still the direction pursued by many surgeons. Among the numerous and sophisticated surgical methods, transverse preputial island flap (TPIF) repair (Duckett\u2019s procedure) is considered one of the most classic and effective surgical procedures. However, the high prevalence of complications after TPIF, particularly urethral stricture, prevents its widespread use [2, 5].\nTo this end, since 2017, we have modified the TPIF repair: first, ventrally reconstructing the urethral plate by flap on the penis, followed by tubularizing in\u00a0situ to construct a neourethra, to reduce postoperative complications, especially urethral stricture (Fig.\u00a01) [6]. After three years of application, we compared this method with the traditional TPIF and Byar\u2019s two-stage procedure and report the results below. * Fang Chen chenfang01@sjtu.edu.cn\n1 Department of\u00a0Urology, Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital, School of\u00a0medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai\u00a0200040, China\n1 3"

Then the urethral plate was divided into distal and proximal part, and both parts were dissected to each end from the transection point along the surface of corpora cavernosa. Any fibrous bands tethering the penis were removed. If a slight curvature remained, a dorsal plication was performed to ensure penile straightening. Next, the glans wings were mobilized according to our glanuloplasty method [7] along the bilateral distal urethral plate to the top of the glans, completely exposing the distal urethral plate.\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the modified TPIF. A A transverse pedicle flap is mobilized from the inner prepuce. Several incisions are made along the dot lines. B Eventually, V shaped incisions are made at the two ends of the flap. The original urethral meatus is trimmed and spatulated. The bilateral glanular wings were dissected away from the corpora cavernosa. C The two ends of the flap are aligned\nand anastomosed with the urethral plate distally and the native urethra proximally. D The flap is tubularized with the suture line facing ventrally.

The proximal and distal ends of the flap were trimmed into a V-shape and anastomosed with the native meatus to ensure spoon-shaped anastomosis in both junctions (Fig.\u00a03A, B). An 8 Fr feeding tube was used as a template. The flap was then trimmed and tubularized proximally to distally to construct the neourethra. Subsequently, Darto\u2019s fascia was covered on the neourethra, followed by glanuloplasty, which combined the bilateral distal corpus cavernosum and the glanular wings in the midline. Finally, the preputial skin was tailored to provide adequate coverage of the penis (Fig.\u00a04A, B)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Compared to distal hypospadias, proximal hypospadias represents a spectrum of external genitalia malformations. These include high degrees of penile curvature, long urethral defects, dysplastic glans, and penoscrotal inversion, which lead to more repair and plastic reconstruction. Both shortterm and long-term outcomes are usually accompanied by a high prevalence of postoperative complications.\nIt was not until the 1980s, when Professor Duckett proposed using TPIF, a historical innovation, to reconstruct the urethra [8]. This has several advantages, such as completely straightening the penis, convenient access to materials, and a one-stage repair. Subsequently, the one-stage TPIF gradually replaced the former two-stage procedure and became the direction pursued by urologists. Nevertheless, later practice verification conducted by urologists found that this\ntechnique was accompanied by the shortcomings of a long learning curve and various complications. Although experienced surgeons improve their proficiency and make various modifications through long-term practice, the complication rate remains as high as ~ 37.9% [5, 9, 10]. This could be explained by complex surgical procedures, abnormal distribution of foreskin, increased infection risk, and the surgeon\u2019s proficiency and experience requirements. Therefore, the concept of two-stage repair has been proposed and has attracted considerable attention. Currently, less than 40% of surgeons choose a one-stage procedure for proximal hypospadias.\nThe two-stage procedure is inferior to the one-stage procedure in terms of the treatment period, cost, anesthesia risk, and psychological burden. Consequently, if the high prevalence of complications in the TPIF procedure can be improved, it remains a clinically effective technique that can significantly benefit patients. Among all the complications of the TPIF procedure, the urethral stricture is a severe complication with disastrous consequences and a high incidence rate of approximately 12.5% [5]. Once it occurs, it is difficult to relieve by dilation and usually leads to a failed repair in severe cases, even the \u201cre-do\u201d surgery or crippled penis. This type of urinary stricture primarily exists at the site of the glanular urethra and anastomosis with the proximal urethral meatus [9, 11]. Anatomically and technically, although Duckett requires that the proximal anastomosis be made into a spoon shape, it is difficult to achieve when trimming the flap into a tube, causing the diameter of the anastomotic urethra to be narrower than that of the adjacent urethra. In addition, the glanular neourethra presents a tunnel through dense granular cavernous tissue with an external pressure significantly higher than that of the penile urethra and scrotal segments. In addition, the distal urethra is also the peripheral part of the blood supply to the flap, resulting in a high probability of urinary stricture caused by an insufficient blood supply. To solve this problem, the tube diameter and blood supply at both anastomoses of the neourethra appear to be the focus.\nThe urethral plate has long been the preferred material for urethral reconstruction in patients with hypospadias. However, many studies, including those at our center, have found that there are still several differences in tissue composition (such as elastic fibers and smooth muscle components) between the urethral plate of hypospadias patients and the normal urethra [12, 13]. Nevertheless, it still has a more abundant blood supply and vigorous tissue vitality than other tissue because of its corpus cavernosum nature, so it\u2019s relatively suitable to be used to reconstruct the urethra or serve as a part of the neourethra [14, 15]. For this reason, we preserved the distal and proximal urethral plates after transecting it at the point of the maximal curvature and then embedded the island flap into both ends of the urethral plates with a \u201cV\u201d shape, ensuring a spoon-shaped\n1 3\nanastomosis at both ends. This maneuver not only makes the urethral plate part of the anastomosis but also increases the width of the tissue and, thus, the diameter of the neourethra, further reducing the possibility of postoperative anastomotic stricture. Of note, it can be observed that the postoperative stricture rate in the modified TPIF repair was significantly lower than that in the traditional TPIF procedure (4.65 vs. 10.81%) and even close to that in the two-stage procedure (3.23%). Thus, we conclude that this modification has a definite effect on reducing postoperative strictures. In addition, there were two cases of glanular urethral stricture with the modified TPIF repair. This may result from compression by external dense granular tissue, especially when the glanular diameter in the proximal hypospadias is generally small (both cases had narrow glans of < 8\u00a0mm width), with a more pronounced pressure. Therefore, it has also been suggested that for hypospadias with small glans, the neourethra can be temporarily made to the level of the coronal sulcus, and the distal urethra can be reconstructed after the glans grow.\nA urethral diverticulum is another challenging complication of TPIF. The two most common causes are distal urethral strictures and urodynamic changes caused by tortuous or uneven neourethral diameter. In addition to meatus stenosis after the TPIF procedure, it should be noted that the neourethra distorts the lumen due to the lack of support in the corpus penis, resulting in a relatively high incidence of postoperative diverticulum. Encouragingly, our method also has certain advantages in preventing urethral diverticula. Specifically, the urethral plate is a relatively fixed tissue, with the remaining urethral plate proximally connected to the normal urethral tissue, distal to the tip of the glans. The neourethra were sutured on these two relatively fixed tissues, with both ends firmly anchored on the surface of the corpus cavernosum after penile straightening. In addition, unlike the traditional TPIF procedure, our maneuver involves tacking the flap on the proximal and distal urethral plate first, then trimming and tubularizing the flap longitudinally. This ensures that the length and width of the neourethra match the penis and guarantees that the neourethra will not be distorted and displaced, eventually reducing the possibility of diverticulum caused by poor urethral compliance after surgery. Although the incidence of diverticulum in the three groups was similar to that observed in our results, the probability of diverticulum in modified TPIF repair (2.33%) remained significantly lower than that (~ 12.8%) after traditional TPIF in the literature [11], which supports the validity of our method in improving urethral compliance.\nNo significant differences were found among the three groups regarding the incidence of postoperative urethrocutaneous fistulas. Technically, one difference between our method and the traditional TPIF procedure is that the suture line of the urethral tubularization is on the ventral side\ninstead of the dorsal urethra clinging to the tunica albuginea, which is more similar to Byar\u2019s procedure. From the actual results, however, no matter whether the suture line is on the dorsal or ventral side, it has little effect on the incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula. Therefore, the covering layers are more important to prevent the occurrence of urethrocutaneous fistulas.\nByar\u2019s procedure, a classic two-stage method, pays more attention to the blood supply to the neo-urethra. Therefore, we chose Byar\u2019s procedure as a control for this study. Our results demonstrated that the incidence of urethral stricture and urethrocutaneous fistula in Byar\u2019s procedure is slightly lower than that in modified TPIF repair. Nevertheless, this difference cannot adequately indicate the superiority of the two-stage procedure compared to one-stage urethroplasty. Given several factors, such as treatment period, cost, and psychology, it is believed that many patients and surgeons will still choose a one-stage procedure. Therefore, one-stage repair of proximal hypospadias should still be a direction for clinicians.\nOur study was limited by its retrospective nature, inevitable selection bias, and statistical error. Moreover, this was a single-center study with a limited number of patients. Some patients with short-term follow-up cannot temporarily manifest all complications. Moreover, many patients are too young to collect and compare urodynamic measures, such as uroflow rate, which will be completed by more cases and follow-up data in future prospective studies."

Furthermore, it extended the urethral plate width at the anastomosis and urethral meatus, effectively reducing the incidence of postoperative urethral strictures.\nAcknowledgements This work was part of the Program on \u201cReconstruct the urethra plate by dorsal inner prepuce island flap in proximal hypospadias repair\u201d funded under the Clinical Research Project of Shanghai Municipal Health Commission (grant number 201940223).
