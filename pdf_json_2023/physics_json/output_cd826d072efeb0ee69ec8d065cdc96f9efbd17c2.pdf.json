    "abstractText": "Zymomonas mobilis is a natural ethanologen with many desirable characteristics, which makes it an ideal industrial microbial biocatalyst for the commercial production of desirable bioproducts. Sugar transporters are responsible for the import of substrate sugars and the conversion of ethanol and other products. Glucose-facilitated diffusion protein Glf is responsible for facilitating the diffusion of glucose uptake in Z. mobilis. However, another sugar transporter-encoded gene, ZMO0293, is poorly characterized. We employed gene deletion and heterologous expression mediated by the CRISPR/Cas method to investigate the role of ZMO0293. The results showed that deletion of the ZMO0293 gene slowed growth and reduced ethanol production and the activities of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. Moreover, ZMO0293 deletion caused different transcriptional changes in some genes of the Entner Doudoroff (ED) pathway in the ZM4-\u2206ZM0293 strain but not in ZM4 cells. The integrated expression of ZMO0293 restored the growth of the glucose uptake-defective strain Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-\u2206ptsG. This study reveals the function of the ZMO0293 gene in Z. mobilis in response to high concentrations of glucose and provides a new biological part for synthetic biology.",

            "text": "Molasses and waste starch from potato factories is a promising feedstock for biofuel production [1]. Glucose is the major component liberated from these wastes during hydrolysis. The efficient utilization of glucose by microorganisms is crucial for economic biofuel production. Zymomonas mobilis is a Gram-negative \u03b1-proteobacterium with attractive physiological properties for bioethanol production. It can rely on the unique Entner Doudoroff (ED) pathway to anaerobically metabolize glucose to produce ethanol. Additionally, this ethanologenic bacterium has some desirable industrial characteristics, such as a high ethanol titer, high specific glucose uptake rate, high ethanol tolerance of 16% (v/v), and a broad pH range (3.5\u20137.5, especially low pH), which makes it an excellent chassis for the production of biochemicals [2\u20135]. Currently, different CRISPR\u2013Cas systems have been established in Z. mobilis that facilitate gene editing manipulations [6\u20139]. Moreover, significant progress has been made to expand substrate ranges and enhance robustness against lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysate inhibitors through systems biology and metabolic engineering in Z. mobilis. In addition, various biological parts of synthetic biology, such as promoters, sRNAs, 5\u2032 untranslated regions (5\u2032 UTRs), and functional genes, have been characterized [10\u201313]. Metabolic models and assembly strategies have also been established to guide and construct metabolic pathways, which makes Z. mobilis a promising microbial biocatalyst for economic biosynthesis to produce value-added products such as lactate, isobutanol, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) [14\u201316]. Molecular transport is a key process for cellular growth and metabolism. The transport of glucose and other sugars is the first step of glycolysis and is also an important\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5888. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24065888 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5888 2 of 14\nrate-limiting step [17]. Different microorganisms have different types and characteristics of sugar transporters. In bacteria, glucose is transported through three main transport systems: phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system, and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), namely, H+/Na+ co- or unidirectional transporters [18]. In addition, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a series of hexose transporter homologs, such as HxT1-17, Gal2, Snf3, and Rgt2, which have different substrate affinities and expression profiles [19,20]. Wild-type Z. mobilis only utilize glucose, sucrose, and fructose as carbon sources. Unlike most bacteria, Z. mobilis absorbs glucose by a unique facilitated diffusion mediated by the transmembrane transporter Glf (encoded by the glf gene, ZMO0366) (Figure 1) [21]. This facilitator is a low-affinity, high-velocity carrier that does not consume energy. Previous studies have shown that Glf could significantly increase the absorption rate of glucose, xylose, and fructose, alleviate the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) effect of the recombinant strain, and increase the yield of target products in Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum [22,23]. Furthermore, metabolic engineering approaches have enabled xylose and arabinose metabolism in Z. mobilis [24,25]. Recently, transporter engineering strategies have played an increasingly important role in enhancing carbohydrate uptake, eliminating CCR, and improving hydrolysate inhibitor tolerance [26]. Although the main sugar transporter Glf has been identified in Z. mobilis, more sugar transporters still need to be characterized, and it is advantageous to understand their regulatory mechanism and develop efficient transporter engineering. Z. mobilis can rapidly ferment low concentrations of glucose (less than 100 g/L) and tolerates up to 400 g/L of glucose. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in ethanol fermentation at high concentrations by enhancing glucose transport capacity. Yang et al. found that the ZMO0293 gene was downregulated in the presence of acetic acid or xylose and speculated that this protein might be a xylose transporter [27]. In addition, Zhang et al. also illustrated that the ZMO0293 gene was significantly upregulated under conditions of adaptation to 220 g/L glucose [28]. However, the function of Zmo0293 has not been elucidated. It is necessary to understand the function of the sugar transporter Zmo0293 in central metabolism in Z. mobilis. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5888 3 of 14\nHere, we aimed to analyze the function of the sugar transporter gene ZMO0293. Firstly, we obtained the ZMO0293 knockout mutant by the Type I-F CRISPR\u2013Cas system and observed the influence on the growth rate, biomass, glucose consumption rate, and ethanol production rate. Secondly, qPCR was used to analyze the expression level of ZMO0293 and other ED pathway genes. Finally, the ZMO0293 gene was heterologously expressed to restore the growth of E. coli BL21(DE3)-\u2206ptsG. Our study was helpful for identifying the function of the sugar transporter gene ZMO0293 and provides a basis for understanding glucose uptake and sugar transporter engineering in Z. mobilis."

Previous transcriptomic studies showed that ZM4 cells can regulate the transcription levels of genes associated with membrane channels and transporters, and metabolic pathways to adapt to high concentrations of glucose [28]. Our results showed that ZMO0293 deletion (ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293) can remarkably slow growth, glucose consumption rate, and ethanol production rate in the presence of a high glucose concentration (240 g/L), suggesting that the ZMO0293 gene may function under high glucose concentrations. Compared to the ZM4, the ethanol titer of ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 cells was reduced by 8.3% and 7.1% under glucose concentrations of 100 and 240 g/L, respectively (Figure 2). These results suggested that ZMO0293 deletion might conditionally affect glucose metabolism and ethanol production, especially under high glucose concentrations, which is consistent with previous results [28]. In addition, it is difficult to delete the ZMO0366 (glf ) gene by the CRISPR/Cas9 system used in this study and other methods, such as RecET [30], indicating that this gene is probably an essential gene for ZM4 cells. In order to test the potential of Zmo0293, we constructed the complementary strain by plasmid expression in ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 (Supplementary Figure S3). When the glucose content in the RMG medium reached 240 g/L, the complementary strain of ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 mutant (ZM4\u2206ZMO0293/pZM3pdc-ZMO0293) had a lag period of more than 30 h, which severely affected the normal growth. Therefore, the glucose concentration of 200 g/L was used to replace the 240 g/L. The results showed that the complementary strain of the ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 mutant grew slowly and exhibited an obvious lag time (Figure 3C). Additionally, the OD of the ZMO0293 and control ZMO0366 overexpressed strain (ZM4/pZM3pdc-ZMO0293 and ZM4/pZM3pdc-ZMO0366) was almost consistent with that of ZM4 and ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 strains in the presence of 20 and 100 g/L glucose (Figure 3A,B). Under 200 g/L glucose, the growth of the overexpressed strain of the ZMO0293 gene (ZM4/pZM3pdc-ZMO0293) was slower than that of ZM4 and the deletion strain (ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293), and the final OD was 9.2 % and 7.8% lower than that of the ZM4 and ZM4-\u2206ZMO0293 strains, respectively (Figure 3C). It can be concluded that the overexpression effect of the ZMO0293 gene did not work as expected in low or high glucose concentrations. A possible reason is that plasmid overexpression of sugar transporter Zmo0293 needs correct folding, localization, and insertion into the phospholipid bilayer. The copy number of plasmid pZM3 is higher than that of gene in the genome, which possibly leads to excessive protein expression and further affects the protein maturation process in the cell. In addition, the burden of plasmid expression on growth is another possible reason."

To examine the influence of ZMO0293 deletion on the ED pathway, we determined the transcriptional level of the ED pathway by RT\u2013qPCR.

J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 15 These results suggested that ZMO0293 deletion might conditionally affect glucose metabolism and ethanol production, especially under high glucose concentrations, which is consistent with previous results [28]. In addition, it is difficult to delete the ZMO0366 (glf) gene by the CRISPR/Cas9 system used in this study and other methods, such as RecET [30], indicating that this gene is probably an essential gene for ZM4 cells. In order to test the potential of Zmo0293, we constructed the complementary strain by plasmid expression in ZM4-\u0394ZMO0293 (Supplementary Figure S3). When the glucose content in the RMG medium reached 240 g/L, the complementary strain of ZM4-\u0394ZMO0293 mutant (ZM4-\u0394ZMO0293/pZM3pdc-ZMO0293) had a lag period of more than 30 h, which severely affected the normal growth. Therefore, the glucose concentration of 200 g/L was used to replace the 240 g/L. The results showed that the complementary strain of the ZM4-\n\u0394ZMO0293 mutant grew slowly and exhibited an obvious lag time (Figure 3C). Addition-\nally, the OD of the ZMO0293 and control ZMO0366 overexpressed strain (ZM4/pZM3pdc-\nZMO0293 and ZM4/pZM3pdc-ZMO0366) was almost consistent with that of ZM4 and\nZM4-\u0394ZMO0293 strains in the presence of 20 and 100 g/L glucose (Figure 3A,B). Under\n200 g/L glucose, the growth of the overexpressed strain of the ZMO0293 gene\n(ZM4/pZM3pdc-ZMO0293) was slower than that of ZM4 and the deletion strain (ZM4-\n\u0394ZMO0293), and the final OD was 9.2 % and 7.8% lower than that of the ZM4 and ZM4-\n\u0394ZMO0293 strains, respectively (Figure 3C). It can be concluded that the overexpression\neffect of the ZMO0293 gene did not work as expected in low or high glucose concentra-\ntions. A possible reason is that plasmid overexpression of sugar transporter Zmo0293\nneeds correct folding, localization, and insertion into the phospholipid bilayer. The copy\nnumber of plasmid pZM3 is higher than that of gene in the genome, which possibly leads\nto excessive protein expression and further affects the protein maturation process in the\ncell. In addition, the burden of plasmid expression on growth is another possible reason."

All strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.\n3.2.2. Electroporation and Mutant Selection\nThe pMini-\u2206ZMO0293 plasmid was transformed into ZM4 competent cells (1 \u00b5g DNA with 50 \u00b5L competent cells) via electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The electroporation parameters were as follows: 0.2 cm electroporation cuvettes, 1.6 kV, 25 \u00b5F, and 200 \u2126. The electroporated cells were immediately transferred to 1 mL RMG and recovered at 30 \u25e6C for 8\u201312 h. The cells were then spread on RMG agar plates containing appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 30 \u25e6C for 2\u20133 days to isolate single colonies. Colonies with correct plasmids were cultivated in an RMG medium containing appropriate antibiotics and verified by colony PCR.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5888 10 of 14"

            "text": "E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host for genomic manipulations. Gene deletion and integration expression were performed by the CRISPR/Cas9 system with two plasmids, one plasmid, pTargetF (Addgene number 62226), was responsible for target site recognition, and the other plasmid, pEcCas (Addgene number 73227), was used for target site cutting [39,40]. When needed, both spectinomycin and kanamycin were used at final concentrations of 50 \u00b5g/mL. L-arabinose and rhamnose were added at concentrations of 10 mM and 10 mM, respectively.\n3.3.1. Plasmid Construction\nThe pTargetF plasmid used for deletion and integration of the target site was constructed by a pair of primers with the gRNA spacer sequence specific for each target and the flanked sequences homologous to the pTargetF backbone (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1). The resultant PCR products were transformed into DH5\u03b1 competent cells after Dpn I digestion and then ligated via homologous recombination to form pTargetF-ptsG and pTargetF-ykgH-betA.\n3.3.2. Donor Construction\nThe upstream and downstream HAs with a length of 500\u20131000 bp were fused by overlap extension PCR to form a donor DNA for seamless deletion of the ptsG gene. The expression donor for ZMO0293 and ZMO0366 was constructed for chromosome integra-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5888 11 of 14\ntion [41]. These two genes, ZMO0293 and ZMO0366, were driven by the promoters PgapAP1 and synthetic terminator TBBa_B1002, respectively. The HA length at both ends was also 500\u20131000 bp.\n3.3.3. Electroporation and Screening of Mutants\nBriefly, 40 \u00b5L electrocompetent cells harboring the pEcCas plasmid, 400 ng donor DNA, and 100 ng gRNA plasmid were mixed for electroporation in a Gene Pulser\u00ae II electroporator (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following parameters: 1.0 mm cuvette gap, 1.8 kV, 200 \u2126, and 25 \u00b5F [40]. After electroporation, the transformed cells were immediately resuspended in 1 mL of LB and allowed to recover at 37 \u25e6C for 1 h prior to plating on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin and spectinomycin. After overnight culture at 37 \u25e6C, the single colonies were randomly picked for colony PCR. The selected transformants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The plasmids pEcCas9 and pTargetF could be cured when the strain was not subjected to further engineering."

It can also cause the low activities of key enzymes (GK, G6PDH, and ADH) for glucose metabolism and differential expression of some genes of the ED pathway. In addition, it can restore the growth of E. coli BL21(DE3)-\u2206ptsG deficient in glucose absorption. The results of this study are not only helpful for metabolic engineering regulation of glucose utilization but are also beneficial to alleviate or eliminate the CCR phenotype of recombinant strains in the future.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24065888/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: K.Z. and H.W. conceived and designed the experiments; W.Z. and M.Q. performed the experiments and analyzed the data; W.Z. and K.Z. wrote the manuscript; Y.L. and H.W. revised the manuscript.
