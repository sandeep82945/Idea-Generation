    "abstractText": "As electrical activity in the brain has complex and dynamic properties, the complexity measure permutation entropy (PeEn) has proven itself to reliably distinguish consciousness states recorded by the EEG. However, it has been shown that the focus on specific ordinal patterns instead of all of them produced similar results. Moreover, parameter settings influence the resulting PeEn value. We evaluated the impact of the embedding dimension m and the length of the EEG segment on the resulting PeEn. Moreover, we analysed the probability distributions of monotonous and non-occurring ordinal patterns in different parameter settings. We based our analyses on simulated data as well as on EEG recordings from volunteers, obtained during stable anaesthesia levels at defined, individualised concentrations. The results of the analysis on the simulated data show a dependence of PeEn on different influencing factors such as window length and embedding dimension. With the EEG data, we demonstrated that the probability P of monotonous patterns performs like PeEn in lower embedding dimension (m = 3, AUC = 0.88, [0.7, 1] in both), whereas the probability P of non-occurring patterns outperforms both methods in higher embedding dimensions (m = 5, PeEn: AUC = 0.91, [0.77, 1]; P(non-occurring patterns): AUC = 1, [1, 1]). We showed that the accuracy of PeEn in distinguishing consciousness states changes with different parameter settings. Furthermore, we demonstrated that for the purpose of separating wake from anaesthesia EEG solely pieces of information used for PeEn calculation, i.e., the probability of monotonous patterns or the number of non-occurring patterns may be equally functional.",

            "text": "Reliable and accurate EEG monitoring helps anaesthesiologists to navigate general anaesthesia and to avoid anaesthetic levels that may lead to unwanted awareness or that can cause an increased risk for a postoperative neurocognitive disorder [1]. In the context of clinical EEG monitoring almost\nexclusively spectral analytical approaches are applied. The most widely used system, the bispectral index BIS (BIS; Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) seems to focus on the power in slow and especially in fast frequency bands [2, 3]. The SEDline (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA), Narcotrend (Narcotrend-Group, Hannover, Germany) and Conox (Quantium Medical, Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) monitor also incorporate EEG band power in their algorithm to derive the processed EEG index [4\u20136]. One monitoring system, the entropy module (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) applies the Shannon Entropy [7] to evaluate the shape of the power spectrum [8]. Since this step occurs in the frequency domain it should not be confused with the time-domainbased permutation entropy (PeEn) [9], the parameter used in this manuscript. The mentioned monitoring systems evaluate anaesthetic-induced changes in the (power) spectrum of the EEG and calculate an index that inversely correlates with the anaesthetic level or the so-called depth of * Matthias Kreuzer m.kreuzer@tum.de 1 Department of\u00a0Anaesthesiology and\u00a0Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Rechts Der Isar, Technical University of\u00a0Munich, Munich, Germany 2 Department Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of\u00a0Munich, LMU Biocenter, Planegg-Martinsried, Munich, Germany 3 Institute of\u00a0Analysis and\u00a0Scientific Computing, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria\n1 3\nanaesthesia, albeit this term may not accurately reflect the induced effects of an anaesthetic [10]. To calculate these indices, the information regarding the (power) spectrum is derived by a linear transformation, the Fourier transformation, to obtain the trigonometric functions, the (stationary) signal can be described with. Although the EEG is nonstationary, episodes up to ~ 25\u00a0s may be considered stationary [11\u201313]. But as electrical activity in the brain exhibits complex behavior with chaotic, non-linear dynamic properties, interpretation of EEG data with non-linear, entropic analyses could be useful [14, 15]. For scientific purposes, entropy and complexity measures analysing the EEG in the time domain have been successfully applied to perioperatively recorded data. Especially PeEn proved capable in reliably separating EEG from conscious and unconscious states. PeEn codes the time series into order patterns and seems capable of detecting nonlinearities in the signal [16]. It evaluates the probability distribution of ordinal patterns. Studies showed that various versions\u00a0of the PeEn perform outstandingly in terms of higher coefficient of determination, prediction probability and less baseline variability compared to other current clinical indices for monitoring the anaesthesia induced with GABAergic agents [17]. As the calculation of PeEn depends on parameter settings like order pattern length and the number of data points of the EEG segment to be investigated [17\u201319], we decided to evaluate the impact of order pattern length and the length of the EEG segment on the resulting PeEn. To get a better understanding of PeEn behavior in general, we also investigated the occurrence probability of strictly monotonous patterns as well as non-occurring patterns and how these probabilities change with anaesthesia. We based our analyses on simulated data as well as on EEG recordings from volunteers."

            "text": "Permutation entropy is a complexity measure for time series, also described as a signals\u2019 distance to white noise [20]. It was introduced by Christoph Bandt and Bernd Pompe in 2002 with the intention to create a more robust and invariant calculation, compared to non-linear monotonous transformations for real-world data like EEG or cardiovascular signals [9].\nThe calculation operates by ranking neighboring values within a pre-defined embedding dimension m by position and value, assigning them to a corresponding ordinal pattern. The number of possible ordinal patterns (permutations) depends on the embedding dimension m, with |\u2126m|= m!, where \u2126m, as the labelling set, contains all these possible ordinal patterns. The rank\nindices starting from 1, for the smallest value, to m, for the highest value. The possible ordinal patterns result from the defined embedding dimension, e.g., for m = 3 are \u21263 = (123,132,213,231,312,321). Hence the possible patterns are those shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nFor demonstration purposes, we chose the time series Xt = (X1, X2, \u2026, Xn) = (9, 7, 12, 53, 68, 2) and the embedding dimension m = 3. First, we rank the first three values (9, 7, 12) and assign them their corresponding ordinal pattern, namely (213). With a time delay of \u03c4 = 1 we proceed by shifting our embedding dimension one value to the right and start the whole process from the beginning, creating a sequence of ordinal patterns and their occurrence prevalence. The next sequence would then be (7, 12, 53) leading to the rank order pattern of (123) and so on. The last pattern in our example would be (231), derived from the values (53, 68, 2). With this complexity measure method, it is usually assumed that equal values appearing consecutively almost never occur in physiological time series like the EEG, so that we can neglect this scenario [9].\nIn the following the cardinality of Xt = (X1, X2,\u2026, Xn) will be the length of Xt\u03c4, thus n. In this example, our time series Xt has a total of six values (n = 6). With the determined pattern length of m = 3 and a defined time delay of \u03c4 = 1, we have four samples of values in total that appear in our time series, in general\nThe probability pi of each ordinal pattern is calculated by its occurrence prevalence, i.e., the total amount of occurrence of the pattern, divided by the number of samples in the examined time series. The set of probability distributions P of the order patterns then is the foundation for the PeEn which is defined in terms of the Shannon entropy H\nwith a possible result range of 0 \u2264 H(P) \u2264 log(m!). In our case, the PeEn values were then normalized by the division with the maximum PeEn value for a defined m, to get dimensionless quantities in the interval [0, 1]. Large values of PeEn indicate high complexity. The normalization of H(P), according to\n(1)n \u2212 (m \u2212 1)\n(2)H(P) = PeEn(m, \u03c4) = m! \u2211\ni=1\npi log 1\npi\n1 3\nleads to 0 \u2264 P\u0302eEn\u22641, but this normalization, but also the mathematical formulation, rank indices, and terminology may differ from author to author [9, 21]. The notation for \u2126m that is used in this paper is only possible until a m of 9, as otherwise the numbers cannot be clearly distinguished from each other."

Using simulated data, probable variations between individuals or different consciousness states in real-world data, as well as for instance artefact-related EEG fluctuations can be excluded. White, pink, and brown noise signals were chosen for the analysis. Those signals have different properties, deriving from their respective spectral density 1/f\u00df. White noise signals (\u00df = 0) depict a maximal random state, which represents all frequencies equally in the power density spectrum (Fig.\u00a02Ba). The signal has no order to it, resembling an uncorrelated random signal. Such a signal does not represent a brain signal in a specific consciousness state [23]. On the other hand, correlated random signals, such as pink or brown noise very well resemble signals of different consciousness states of the brain [24]. The spectral density of pink noise signals follows a 1/f tenor (\u00df = 1), meaning, the power decreases the higher the frequencies get (Fig.\u00a02Ba). It simulates an EEG signal of a wake mammalian the most. Brown noise, however, approximates an EEG signal of an anaesthetised brain, with even less power in the spectral density of higher frequencies (1/f2) compared to the pink signal.

The study design with stable anaesthesia levels at defined, individualised concentrations allowed for assessment of the performance of these variables. We used 120\u00a0s of EEG with a sample rate of 100\u00a0Hz extracted during the wake state, a deeper level of (non-burst suppression) general anaesthesia (inter2 in the original publication)\u00a0and a lighter level of general\n(3)P\u0302eEn = H(P)\nlog (m!)\nanaesthesia (inter1 in the original publication) achieved through mono anaesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol. Additionally, we extracted 20\u00a0s segments of each of these signals and repeated the statistical analysis with those shorter and more clinically relevant timeframes. Before calculating the parameters, we bandpass filtered the EEG to the 0.5\u00a0Hz to 30\u00a0Hz range. We chose this range because of the known EMG contamination of the frontal EEG. Of course, the frequency spectrum of the EMG is not limited to frequencies above 30\u00a0Hz but it seems to increasingly contaminate the EEG in the higher frequencies [26]. The entropy module\u2019s processed EEG parameter reflecting the hypnotic component of anaesthesia, the state entropy, only considers frequencies up to 32\u00a0Hz [27]. The BIS, considering frequencies up to 47\u00a0Hz seems strongly influenced by the EMG [28]. Although the cutoff of the low pass is in accordance with the Shannon-Nyquist theorem, the low sample rate may cause a reduction in information content since higher oversampling factors lead to a better resolution. We conducted an analysis of the noise signals that were low-pass filtered at 30\u00a0Hz and then down sampled with different factors to show that the effect on PeEn was low. The exclusion of the higher EEG frequencies can help to reduce the influence of muscle activity on the recorded signal [29]. If included like in the case of the bispectral index, wakefulness in the fully paralyzed patient may not be detected [28, 30]. Exemplary raw traces of volunteer EEG traces are presented in Fig.\u00a02Ab, as well as their power density spectrum in Fig.\u00a02Bb.\nTo assess the difference in the EEG between lighter and deeper anaesthetic levels using a clinically established parameter, we calculated the spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95). It was obtained from the power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals with a frequency resolution of 0.39\u00a0Hz (NFFT = 256, sample rate = 100\u00a0Hz). The SEF95 was calculated as the frequency, below which 95% of the total power of the EEG signal in the frequency range 0.5\u201330\u00a0Hz were located. To investigate the effect of different sampling rates on PeEn values, we increased the sampling rate of the 20\u00a0s EEG segments from 100\u00a0Hz to higher sampling rates up to 300\u00a0Hz by spline interpolation. To investigate the impact of signal length on PeEn we reduced the 20\u00a0s EEG segments in a stepwise approach by 1\u00a0s per step. Therefore 0.5\u00a0s of EEG were removed from the start and end of the EEG episode\u00a0until the shortest segments\u2018 length was 1\u00a0s (= 100 data points)."

Wake (14 signals) and two different stages of anaesthesia (inter1 and inter2, 15 signals each) from the volunteer EEG data were used [25]. The AUC for dichotomous data is equivalent to the prediction probability [31], which was regularly used to evaluate the performance of commercial processed EEG indices or entropic parameters [32, 33] to distinguish different levels of anaesthesia. The AUC value represents the discriminatory capacity between two classes 0 and 1, with a value of 0.5 meaning no separability of any kind. In this work, the classes represent the consciousness states wake and inter1, as well as inter1 and inter2. We executed this analysis with the whole 120\u00a0s segments and then with 20\u00a0s signals, the latter extracted from the data points in the middle of the 120\u00a0s segments. For the analysis, we used the MES-toolbox for MATLAB [34]. The establishment of the corresponding 95% confidence intervals was obtained by the bootstrap method (10,000 repeats). If the 95% confidence interval does not contain the value indicative of no effect, i.e., AUC = 0.5, the result can be considered significant on a p < 0.05 level [34]. We also investigated the influence of the sample rate on the PeEn by calculating a linear model using the MATLAB fitlm function. To evaluate the change in heterogeneity of PeEn for one condition, we calculated the quartile coefficient of variation (CVQ), which can be calculated as CVQ(x) = Q3(x)\u2212Q1(x)\nQ3(x)+Q1(x) , where Q1 and Q3 are the first\nand third quartile of the PeEn [35]."

Consequently, it seemed that the higher the embedding dimension, the more influence the window length had. Moreover, for a window length of 500 and up to an embedding dimension of m = 5 the differences in PeEn between white, pink and brown noise increased but then decreased again for the two highest embedding dimensions (m = 6, m = 7) (Fig.\u00a03a).

The variability in PeEn values for each of the ten signals of one parameter setting and color depended on two components. Firstly, the signal properties itself, with white noise having the lowest variability compared to the colored signals. Secondly, the number of data points was also an influencing factor as less variability in PeEn values occurred in the signals with greater window lengths (Fig.\u00a03).

In order to systematically investigate these influences, we used simulated noise signals as well as clinical data. The noise signals, except the white noise, share spectral features that correlate with the spectral EEG features at different states [22]. Pink noise is characterised by a 1/f decrease of the spectral power in the log\u2013log representation and is a very common feature in biological systems [36]. Regarding the EEG it seems to resemble the power with frequency decrease during relaxed awake states [22]. Brown noise, i.e. 1/f2, shows a steeper decrease in the spectrum with frequency. It may share the slope with the EEG during unconscious states like general anaesthesia [22]. Therefore, the (permutation) entropy will be higher for pink than for brown noise, because of a less uniform probability distribution. For white noise, PeEn will be maximal [20].\nOur results show these differences in PeEn between the three types of noise. Per definition the maximum PeEn is log(m!). Hence, for a given EEG or noise time series, PeEn will increase with m. However, when looking at the normalised PeEn we could observe a decrease in values with increasing m which can be explained by an increasing number of non-occurring patterns. This decrease is steeper for smaller window lengths. For segments with less or close the amount of sample of values than possible ordinal patterns (m!), the probability of each ordinal pattern to appear was lower compared to longer time series, where the probability increased again, as non-occurring patterns inversely correlate with the number of data points. For example a time series of 1000 data points and an embedding dimension with m = 6 (i.e. 6! = 720 possible patterns) will lead to a high number of non-occurring patterns. This also explains why the gap between the colored noise signals increases with greater window length.\nThe decrease in the probability of strictly monotonous patterns can be explained by the higher number of possible ordinal patterns (occurring and non-occurring), resulting from higher embedding dimensions. The occurrence prevalence in brown noise (followed by pink and then by white noise) is due to the properties of the signal: slow, rhythmic oscillations will lead to a higher occurrence in strictly rising or falling monotonous patterns.\nQuestioning the PeEn to be a measure for EEG complexity, Berger et\u00a0al. showed that the PeEn decrease can be explained by less zero-crossings. Evaluating the zero-crossings was described for EEG analysis almost 60\u00a0years ago [37]. One drawback of PeEn for the purpose of anaesthesia monitoring may be a rather poor performance of separating different levels of non-burst suppression anaesthesia [38]. But regardless of PeEn reflecting complexity, we could observe an increase in the probability of strictly monotonous patterns from white to pink to brown noise as well as an increase of non-occurring patterns for higher m."

            "text": "In the context of separating wake from anaesthesia EEG, the performance of PeEn remained stable, and if anything, slightly increased with higher m. Since there are m! possible order patterns the number of non-occurring patterns increases with m. Using the monotonous patterns, a similar discriminatory capacity in embedding dimensions up to m = 5 can be found. However, in higher embedding dimensions the number of non-occurring patterns seems to function as an even better separator of these states. Mechanistically the explanation seems straightforward: During wakefulness the EEG can be characterised by fast oscillatory activity with low amplitudes and the activity shifts to a slower rhythm with higher amplitudes during general anaesthesia [24]. Even if only lower frequencies are considered for analysis, the EEG slows during anaesthesia with GABAergic drugs and the amplitudes increase. Before processing, the EEG is usually low pass filtered to prevent a dominant influence of distortions such as muscle activity which for instance can increasingly contaminate the recorded signal with increasing frequencies [39]. In our case, we only included oscillatory activity up to 30\u00a0Hz, dismissing higher frequencies that also carry important EEG information during the wake state. Still, with these filter settings the wake EEG is faster and of lower amplitude than the anaesthesia EEG. Under anaesthesia, with a very rhythmic signal, the number of longer (e.g. m \u2265 5) patterns that really occur will be limited and hence the number of non-occurring patterns will increase. But because of the 1/f characteristics in the EEG, there will always be slow activity in the signal that will also lead to monotonous patterns or patterns with only one or two peaks. Hence the number of non-occurring patterns in the awake EEG will be lower.\nExamining the discrimination capacity between the two anaesthesia levels, counterintuitively, the PeEn values were lower for the \u201clighter\u201d level of general anaesthesia (inter1), than for the \u201cdeeper\u201d level of general anaesthesia (inter2). This was due to the spectral features of the EEG at the different levels. The SEF analysis revealed significantly lower SEF for the deeper level, fully in accordance\n1 3\nwith presented results [40]). As can be observed in supplemental Figure S3, the EEG during inter1 had significantly higher alpha-band power leading to a lower PeEn. We could show previously that an increase in alpha power causes a decrease in PeEn [41]. Moreover, regardless of the level of anaesthesia, detecting that there actually are two anaesthesia states (inter1 versus inter2) PeEn as well as the probability of monotonous patterns did not produce significant results. This was rather expected, as this was also the case in the original publication from Horn et\u00a0al., where it was explained with PeEn being more a separator for wake vs. anaesthetised than for different anaesthesia levels [25]. However, the non-occurring patterns performed exceptionally well and produced significant results in embedding dimensions equal or greater than m \u2265 5. It seems that with a high number of ordinal patterns, the differences between similar consciousness states are still high enough in terms of the number of non-occurring patters, to distinguish between them. This shows that the information content of the probability distribution of all ordinal patterns calculated by the PeEn reflects a specific consciousness state worse than the much simpler approach of the sheer counting of non-occurring patterns.\nFocusing on the results for an embedding dimension of m = 3, the analysis of our EEG data showed that the performance to distinguish the awake state from an anaesthetic level without burst suppression with PeEn was good. Although an increase in sample rate caused PeEn to decrease and the percentage of monotonous patterns to increase, the performance of these parameters was not affected. The change in the parameter values is based on the creation of additional monotonous patterns, due to the introduction of more sample points by the interpolation. Also, the EEG segment length did not influence the parameters, indicating that PeEn can also be used for very short segments. Using the probability of strictly monotonous patterns led to a comparable performance with only using a part of the information used for PeEn calculation. Berger et\u00a0al. described that the PeEn may in certain cases be substituted by the entropy of peaks that can be derived by generating the second derivative of the time series [21]. We could show that the probability of monotonous patterns seems to also function as a separator between wake and anaesthesia EEG. As for peak detection it may be sufficient to perform a differentiation and hence create a vector from the time series that only consists of \u201c + \u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d. Hence, the step of generating order patterns is not necessary. The entropy of difference that also seems applicable to EEG and other neurophysiological data follows the approach of evaluating the probabilities of \u201c + \u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d patterns and therefore does not require order pattern generation [42, 43]."

            "text": "PeEn seems to be equivalent or even better in its performance to separate wake EEG from anaesthesia EEG compared to spectral methods [38]. But if PeEn really reflects the complexity of the signal or its information content is less clear. At least for m = 3 the PeEn seems to be an estimate of the centroid of the weighted power spectrum [34]. For higher m such a relation has not been yet described, but with our work we can show that for the purpose of separating wake from anaesthesia EEG pieces of information used for PeEn calculation, i.e., the probability of monotonous patterns or the number of non-occurring patterns may be equally functional."

            "text": "The purpose of this article is to introduce the analysis of monotonous pattern and of the number of non-occurring patterns. Therefore, an analytical focus was on simulated signals that resemble EEG features as recorded during wakefulness or levels of anaesthesia. The analysis of the EEG was limited to stable episodes of wake and anaesthesia EEG where anaesthesia was maintained with propofol or sevoflurane. So, we cannot make any claims for other anaesthetics as their EEG characteristics may be very different [34]. Also, in terms of opioids etc. we cannot draw any conclusions. For order pattern generation we used a \u03c4 = 1. Numerous publications used other time lags as well to calculate PeEn. The use of higher lags of \u03c4 \u2265 2 can lead to discontinuous frequency dependencies [44, 45], and hence we decided to not include higher lags since that may overcomplicate the article. For the EEG analyses, we used a rather old data set, but since this data was recorded during stable levels of general anaesthesia, it was perfect for our approach. Also, we only used EEG information after a 30\u00a0Hz low pass filtering. This approach may not consider useful information from higher frequencies. But because of the known interference of muscle activity with the EEG, especially in awake patients and the known low index values [28, 30] when relying on higher frequencies for the fully paralyzed and awake patient, we feel that the focus on the lower frequencies makes sense. Also the chosen sampling frequency of 100\u00a0Hz was low and higher sampling rates would help to contain more information in the signal. Further, low sample rates may influence the nonlinear analysis of time series [46]. Hence future investigations should consider EEG data with higher sample rates. We also did not evaluate the performance for the used substances individually. This should be done in the future in a larger patient cohort.\n1 3\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10877- 023- 01051-z.\nAuthor contributions Analysed the data: MF, SW, MK; Provided mathematical background: AK, AE;\u00a0Discussed the results: MF, AE, AK, SW, TF, GS, MK; Helped to write the manuscript: MF, AE, AK, SW, TF, GS, MK.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
