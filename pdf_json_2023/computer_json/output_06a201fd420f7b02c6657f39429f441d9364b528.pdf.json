    "abstractText": "Carbon fiber composite can be a potential candidate for replacing metal-based battery enclosures of current electric vehicles (E.V.s) owing to its better strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. However, the strength of carbon fiber-based structures depends on several parameters that should be carefully chosen. In this work, we implemented high throughput finite element analysis (FEA) based thermoforming simulation to virtually manufacture the battery enclosure using different design and processing parameters. Subsequently, we performed virtual crash simulations to mimic a side pole crash to evaluate the crashworthiness of the battery enclosures. This high throughput crash simulation dataset was utilized to build predictive models to understand the crashworthiness of an unknown set. Our machine learning (ML) models showed excellent performance (R > 0.97) in predicting the crashworthiness metrics, i.e., crush load efficiency, absorbed energy, intrusion, and maximum deceleration during a crash. We believe that this FEA-ML work framework will be helpful in down select process parameters for carbon fiber-based component design and can be transferrable to other manufacturing technologies.",

However, the strength of carbon fiber-based structures depends on several parameters that should be carefully chosen. In this work, we implemented high throughput finite element analysis (FEA) based thermoforming simulation to virtually manufacture the battery enclosure using different design and processing parameters. Subsequently, we performed virtual crash simulations to mimic a side pole crash to evaluate the crashworthiness of the battery enclosures. This high throughput crash simulation dataset was utilized to build predictive models to understand the crashworthiness of an unknown set. Our machine learning (ML) models showed excellent performance (R2 > 0.97) in predicting the crashworthiness metrics, i.e., crush load efficiency, absorbed energy, intrusion, and maximum deceleration during a crash. We believe that this FEA-ML work framework will be helpful in down select process parameters for carbon fiber-based component design and can be transferrable to other manufacturing technologies."

            "text": "Industry and government agencies worldwide are working to reduce reliance on fossil fuels powered vehicles because of their adverse environmental impacts, unpredictable fuel prices, and limited fuel supply. As a result of these organizational efforts, there has been increased adoption of electric vehicles (E.V.s) in the past few years, and it is expected to rise further [1]. Although E.V.s offer a promising alternative to petroleum-powered vehicles, at least two issues can prevent the full realization of their potential. The first issue would be the heavier weight of E.V.s. They are heavier because of the battery packs and the associated battery enclosure, reinforced framework, and suspension [2]. The second issue would be fire safety, if the battery pack is damaged, there is a large risk of battery thermal runaway, fire, and explosion [3].\nOne way to reduce the weight of E.V.s is to use carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites\nfor the battery pack's enclosure/box. The battery enclosure is typically made of aluminum-based highstrength alloys [4]. CFRP composites, in comparison, offer specific strengths and stiffnesses that are a few times higher. For this reason, aircraft components that are traditionally manufactured using aluminum alloys are being replaced by CFRP composites, and now composites make up most of the modern aircraft's materials [5]. Similarly, the use of composites in the automotive sector continues to grow rapidly[6]. For these reasons, battery enclosure designs using composites have already been explored [7]. For instance,\n2 | P a g e\nit has been found that a CFRP composite with a comparable strength would provide significant weight savings[8].\nConsidering only the weight savings, the choice of using CFRP for the battery enclosure is justified. However, fire safety is a critical issue that must be considered before CFRP battery enclosure can be qualified to be widely deployed. CFRP materials by themselves can be fire and corrosion resistant [9]. However, fire originates not in the enclosure but from the battery pack because of the damage to it [3]. Therefore, the role of enclosure in overall fire safety must be evaluated with respect to how well it can prevent damage to the battery pack inside. The battery enclosure is typically mounted at the bottom of E.V.s, as a vehicle is more prone to rear and frontal impacts in the event of an accident. Nonetheless, the battery enclosure can still be damaged by ground impacts [10] and impact to the side during crashes [3]. The later impact mode is of interest to this study. Damage to just the battery pack has been extensively studied, and the kind of impacts that lead to a fire are well understood[11] \u2013 [13]. The damage to the battery pack when within an enclosure during a crash was much less studied. In a particular study, the design of the battery pack was optimized for crashworthiness, but the load-bearing components of this enclosure were all made of steel [14].\nThe intent to use CFRPs for crashworthy battery enclosures presents both opportunities and challenges. Designing and manufacturing a CRFP enclosure would involve setting many design and process parameters. Design parameters would be the number of layers, the orientation of fibers, and the stacking arrangement. Note that parameters governing the shape of the enclosure also need to be set. However, this aspect is skipped in this study because the same problem is encountered for metallic enclosures, too, and is not unique to CFRP enclosures. Processing parameters during thermoforming would mean the velocity of the punch during forming and the temperatures during the process. In total, there are many parameters, and this could present an opportunity to tailor the properties that would lead to a highly efficient crashworthy enclosure. The challenge would be knowing the effect of changing each of these parameters on crashworthiness and determining the optimal values. The challenge would be amplified by the fact that crashworthiness is not a single parameter because commercial safety standards like those for cars do not exist for battery enclosures.\nOptimizing many parameters by extensive experimentation and trial-and-error can be extremely\nchallenging, laborious, and inefficient. Therefore, physics-based simulation tools followed by dataintensive machine learning models must be relied on to predict crashworthiness for all possible parameter combinations. The simulations required here could be classified under the process-property modeling task often encountered in Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) [17]. The simulation task can be broken down into three steps. The first step would be process-structure modeling, where the thermoforming process is simulated for all parameter sets to determine fiber orientations in the formed enclosure. For this purpose, ESI Inc. has a commercially available software PAM-FORM[18], that uses the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the thermoforming process used to manufacture carbon fiber composite [19]. Such software is ideal because it can consider the mechanics of fiber matrix interaction during thermoforming [20]. Moreover, this software can be utilized to perform high throughput thermoforming simulations by varying the process parameters related to composite materials. The second step would be structure-property modeling, where all enclosures' side crashes are simulated. For this purpose, virtual performance simulation (VPS)[21] software offered by ESI Inc. is suitable because it can capture complex damage behaviors of composites during crashes [22]. While there are other approaches for structure-property modeling in composite [23]\u2013 [25], using VPS in conjunction with PAM-FORM would\n3 | P a g e\nmake building the pipeline to transfer forming results to a crash simulation easier. By completing steps one and two, a large dataset related to carbon fiber-based battery enclosures is varied by processing parameters, resulting in crash data. This dataset can potentially be utilized in decision-making for unknown/new sets of experimental design spaces by employing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Therefore, in step three, we utilized the dataset generated in steps one and two to predict the crashworthiness of the carbon fiber-based battery enclosures. The predictive accuracy of the machine learning models is highly accurate, and the use of these data-intensive techniques on composite manufacturing technologies holds much promise[26]\u2013 [29].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 first describes the data generation part of this study, i.e.,\nthe methodology used to simulate thermoforming and crash, the selection of the design space, and the parameters extracted to evaluate crashworthiness. Subsequently, section 2 describes the machine learning model selection. Next, section 3 describes some of the results from thermoforming and crash simulation and then, the predictive accuracy of the machine learning models."

The initial temperature of the die and punch was kept at 153 oC, whereas the carbon fiber sheet was heated to 255 oC. Furthermore, the ambient temperature was maintained at 18oC. The organosheet was meshed within the software using 2D shell elements with a mesh size of about 3 mm. The gap between the punch and a die was kept at 1 mm, given the fact that four organosheet, each 0.25 mm thick, were used. However, this would change if a different count and thickness were to be used. The contact between the punch and layers and in-between the layers were considered with friction penalty and thermal conductivity of 0.45 W/m.K.\nThe simulation starts with a downward punch stroke along the Z-direction with a velocity of 5 m/s\nwhile the die is kept stationary. During the downward stroke of the punch, the organosheet is pressed against the die, which plastically deforms the organosheet; this is continued further until the forming process is complete.

Both PAM-FORM and VPS were automated using Python.\nIn total, 400 thermoforming simulations were performed; out of these, about 65% of the simulations were successful. This is because, for a given set of design and process parameters, it is not possible to manufacture a part using thermoforming. The results of these simulations were later used to perform crash simulations. Each thermoforming and crash simulation was run on 16 and 8 cores, respectively. Further, the simulations with increasing layers were found to be computationally more expensive. A 10- layer thermoforming simulation, for example, took around 16 hours, and the crash took about 45 minutes on the above-mentioned computing units."

These deceleration forces might lead to an external short circuit that causes a fire [3]. Therefore, the maximum deceleration the enclosure, including the battery pack, undergoes during the crash indicates crashworthiness. A larger deceleration value would mean that the enclosure is less crashworthy. Deceleration values were expressed in m/s2.\nThe choice of these parameters was made through a review of the crashworthiness standards of cars and crash studies of battery packs. Additional parameters that could help assess the crashworthiness could be the specific energy absorbed (SEA) and maximum force. The former can be found by dividing E.A. by the mass of the enclosure and the latter by multiplying maximum acceleration with the mass. Mass, in turn, is a known function of the number of layers and thickness of the layers. Therefore, consideration of these two parameters as the machine learning models' outputs was unnecessary."

Treebased ensemble models have demonstrated superior performance compared to other models for predicting materials properties[26]\u2013 [29], [39]. Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine multiple base models to create a more accurate predictive model. Bagging ensemble methods can reduce variance, while boosting ensemble methods can reduce bias. Boosting methods can convert weak learners into strong ones, with decision stumps typically being used as base weak learners, though not always[40]\u2013 [42]. These methods build models stage-wise and generalize the model by optimizing an arbitrary differentiable loss function. Boosting techniques also help to prevent over-fitting, handle nonlinear relationships between target properties and features, and manage feature collinearity. Additionally, most boosting methods provide information on feature importance, which is crucial for determining which\n9 | P a g e\nfeatures greatly influence target properties. Tree-based models perform better compared to other models, such as neural networks, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression for the case of the smaller dataset in the materials science domain reported by several researchers[28], [29].\nThe grid-search algorithm was employed to minimize errors by optimizing hyper-parameters. This involved testing all possible combinations of the supplied hyper-parameter values and selecting the one with the least error for our model. It is important to note that each algorithm has a unique set of hyperparameters. Once the best hyper-parameters were identified for each target property, we used the optimized model to predict the target properties of our test set, which had been unseen to the model. To conduct our study, we utilized the scikit-learn machine learning library for the Python language to employ all ML models [43], including the Xgboost model that was implemented using the library developed by Tianqi Chen [44]"

Further, the organosheet was able to take the shape of the die perfectly without any wrinkles or wrappage. In addition, the surface finish was good, and all the curved surfaces of the die were formed accurately.\nDuring the thermoforming process, the organosheet undergoes severe deformation. As a result, the fiber angle changes from its original value of 90 degrees. The new fiber orientations are shown in Figure 3(b) and (d). It can be observed that, for the most part, fiber orientation stays the same except at several places involving curvature where it gets severely distorted, as seen in Figure 3(d). This new fiber orientation influences the overall mechanical properties of the formed part. Hence these new orientations were mapped to the battery enclosure part in the crash simulation discussed in the next section.\n10 | P a g e"

It is evident from Table 6 that the model performance for Gradient Boosting and Xgboost are nearly identical for CLE, intrusion, and deceleration.

Feature importance is a score assigned to features based on their usefulness in predicting a target variable. Figure 7 presents the feature importance for all the target properties. The figure shows that the number of composite layers and organosheet thickness are the two most important factors determining all four crashworthiness parameters. However, for CLE, the influence of thickness is much lower than that of the number of layers. It should be noted that the air temperature during thermoforming also has a nonnegligible influence on deceleration.\nThe prediction that the number of layers and organosheet thickness are the two most influential factors on crashworthiness makes sense. Increasing the number of layers and thickness means more material to spread the impact energy, resulting in a higher amount of absorbed energy (EA). Increasing the number of layers and thickness increases the enclosure's strength and bending stiffness [11,12]. Increasing strength and stiffness would imply lower intrusion and higher deceleration.\n13 | P a g e"

Figure 8 shows that the predictive accuracy for the Xgboost model for CLE, E.A., intrusion, and deceleration is excellent in terms of R2 values. In fact, for these target properties, the predictive capability is well for both lower- and upper-bound data, which signifies that the model learns from the data patterns even though the training data size was limited.

However, these models still fail to make a functional relationship between the input features and output target properties and hence have poor generalizability. To solve this issue, we employed Symbolic regression, a special type of ML that focuses on finding a mathematical expression that fits a given dataset. It can be seen as a form of \"equation discovery,\" where the goal is to find a compact and interpretable equation that accurately represents the data. To implement symbolic regression, only the dataset corresponding to \"type B\" orientation was considered since it has 186 data points out of 266. Like Xgboost models, for symbolic regression, 80 percent of the data (138 data points) was considered as testing, and 20 percent of the data (38 data points) was considered as a holdout test set. We used commercially available symbolic regression tools called TuringBot[45], which is highly engineered and robust, with broad applicability in many domains[46], [47] the symbolic regression analysis. The symbolic regression generated equation and corresponding performance metric, i.e., R2 and MAE, is presented in Table 7. Figure 9 provides the comparison between the actual values and symbolic regression predicted values.\n15 | P a g e\nFrom Table 3, it is clear that while generating the equation, it considered the most important features from the Xgboost model presented in Figure 7. These equations are also mainly governed by the number of layers and thickness of the organosheet. However, all the features were considered during the training of the symbolic regression model. It is essential to mention that the nature of the equation will change depending on the dataset. Therefore, these equations and resulting coefficients only apply to this specific dataset. Moreover, the symbolic regression's accuracy is lower than the Xgboost model, as presented in Figure 9 and Figure 8. Usually, traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees can often provide higher accuracy on complex datasets. On a different note, symbolic regression can be helpful in cases where the goal is not just to make predictions but to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that generate the data. Based on our dataset and results, we can infer that the traditional machine learning models followed by symbolic regression will be helpful for better prediction and understanding of the functional relationships among the input features and output target properties.\n16 | P a g e"

The modeling framework consists of a FEA-based simulation pipeline with thermoforming and crash simulations, followed by ML to predict crashworthiness indicators such as crash load efficiency, absorbed energy, intrusion, and deceleration. For all the target parameters, the R2 values for the holdout test set were more than 0.97, which shows the promise of ML models in determining complex relationships in composite design for vehicle technology. Our study also established the role of the number of composite layers and thickness of the sheets as the most prominent features that govern the crashworthiness of the composites. Additionally, symbolic regression analysis provided the governing equations related to the dataset for further generalizability. We believe that this combined FEA-ML framework will be applicable to other manufacturing platforms pertaining to metallic alloys and polymers.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D, S.K., M.T.
