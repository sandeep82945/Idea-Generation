            "text": "Protic ionic liquids (PILs) derived from sulfuric acid and amines combine excellent performance across a number of chemical processes, with inherently lower costs than comparable aprotic ionic liquids. Even among PILs, these ionic liquids are amongst the least expensive since both sulfuric acid and triethylamine are cheap commodity chemicals. A technoeconomic assessment concluded that triethylammonium hydrogensulfate, [HN222][HSO4], could be produced for as little as US$0.78 kg\n1, comparable to many organic solvents in commercial use.1\u20134 Ionic liquids formulated from di- and tri-alkylamines with excess sulfuric acid were postulated to be even cheaper,5 dispensing with the still-popular misconception that ionic liquids are, generically, too expensive for mainstream industrial use.6\nBr\u00f8nsted acidic sulfuric acid based PILS can act as potent acidic catalysts.7\u201310 In esterification reactions, equilibria are strongly shifted towards the products because phase separation of esters from the acidic PIL phase is enhanced when compared to use of concentrated sulfuric acid.10 Hydrated PILs formulated from equimolar quantities of an amine and sulfuric acid, but with the addition of 10\u201340 wt% water, have been found to be excellent solvents for lignocellulosic biomass pre-treatment, enhancing the fractionation of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose, leading to higher yields of sugars from subsequent saccharification of the carbohydrates.11\u201313\nIn both of these examples, enhanced performance arises from doping of the simple hydrogensulfate salt, [Hbase][HSO4], either with an excess of acid or with water, respectively, exemplifying a \u2018\u20184th generation\u2019\u2019 of ionic liquids,14 where molecular dopants are incorporated into the ionic liquid matrix, at quantities that preserve the key characteristics of an ionic liquid system (that is, without turning it into a concentrated solution of ions) while enhancing physico-chemical characteristics, viz. increased acidity, lowered viscosity or favourably modified phase behaviour.

In 1981, Evans, Arnett and co-workers postulated that ethylammonium nitrate exhibited 3D hydrogen bonded network similar to that of water.15 The liquid network structure of ethylammonium nitrate was only confirmed, through far-infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations, in 2009.16 This was followed by direct liquid structural investigations using neutron17\u201320 and X-ray21 scattering that identified nanostructured polar/non-polar domains generated by the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions in the polar regions. Similar structure is also present in PILs formed from other primary alkylamines bearing a Cn alkyl chain (n = 2\u20134) and anions including hydrogen sulfate, thiocyanate, nitrate and formate.22 Weaker acids add further complexity of incomplete proton transfer. For example, mixtures of pyridine and acetic acid were shown to feature a hydrogen-bonded network, which consisted of charge-neutral molecules of acetic acid, with free pyridine sitting in pockets of this network, unprotonated even with a large excess of acid.23\nOn the other hand, in PILs synthesised from amines and excess of hydrogen halides (wacid 4 0.5, X = F\n,24\u201329 Cl ,30 and Br ,31) discrete dimeric and oligomeric clusters, and chains of [X H X] have been identified, with ample crystallographic evidence in addition to liquid-phase studies. Complex anionic clusters have been proposed in other Br\u00f8nsted acidic PILs.10,32,33 For example, in mixtures of amines and trifluoroacetic acid (HTFA), where wHTFA 4 0.5, was postulated to contain [TFA(HTFA)x] clusters.34\nDoping ethylammonium nitrate with water resulted in gradual altering of the liquid structure, but even upon the addition of as much as six moles of water, the structure of the hydrated PIL remained ionic liquid-like, distinctly different from homogenous solution.35 These results, along with numerous other contributions,36 suggest that hydrated PILs form their own class of water-in-salt solvents, a sub-class of a wide family of solvent-doped ionic liquids.14 Consequently, macroscopic properties of hydrated PILs, and their liquids structures, are distinct from both the parent PIL and simple aqueous solution.\nConsidering the structure of PILs derived from sulfuric acid, a 3D networked structure could be postulated based on the structure of sulfuric acid. Neutron and X-ray scattering studies of H2SO4 have shown that sulfate moieties have an ordered, dense network of hydrogen bonds in concentrated liquid acid,37\u201339 in the solid state,40\u201344 and in aqueous solution.45,46 With increasing dilution the structure trends to resemble water, albeit with nearest neighbour intermolecular rO O bond distances ca. 0.2 \u00c5 shorter than in pure H2O.\nOn the other hand, discrete oligomeric hydrogen bonded anionic clusters have been reported to exist in the gas phase, in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere.47\u201350 The first paper by our group reporting PILs derived from sulfuric acid10 also postulated the existence of anionic clusters, in analogy to earlier works on\ntrifluoroacetate ionic liquids25 and other strongly hydrogen bonding anions. FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic studies have been used to justify these assignments, but whereas these early results do show strong interactions between molecules of H2SO4 and [HSO4]\n, they could admittedly occur in both the cluster and the 3D network arrangement.\nHere, neutron scattering has been used to compare the liquid structures of concentrated sulfuric acid and two pyridine/sulfuric acid PILs containing either excess of the acid or doped with water. The objective was to elucidate potential relationships between the local liquid structure, the effectiveness of these PILs as catalysts and solvents for esterification reactions8\u201310 and for treatment of lignocellulosic biomass.11\u201313"

At least 1000 mA of data were collected on each sample. Prior to data collection, quartz cells filled with sample were weighed, placed in a Thermo Scientific vacuum oven (25 1C, o1 10 2 mbar, 20 min), and weighed again, to ensure tightness of the seal against leakage in the instrument vacuum. Data were collected at 25 1C, with the temperature maintained using an FP50 Julabo heating circulator.\nTotal scattering data were reduced into a differential scattering cross section using the GUDRUN package.51 Data collected on a 3.1 mm vanadium-niobium alloy plate standard was used for calibration, while data recorded on the empty SANDALS instrument and an empty 1 mm quartz cell were used for background subtraction.52\nReduced data were analysed using the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR)53,54 software to examine the timeaveraged liquid structure. EPSR uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach coupled with Lennard-Jones potentials with atomcentred point charges, combined with basic structural information about the atoms or molecules and the total atomic densities present of the system.53,54 Differences between the experimental and simulated data sets in Q space (i.e. the empirical perturbation potential) are determined, enabling iterative refinement to generate a self-consistent fit to the scattering cross sections obtained from isotopically distinct samples. Simulations were equilibrated over ca. 2000\u20133000 cycles before accumulating and averaging data. The EPSR refinements, in each case, were initialised using an equilibrated Monte Carlo simulation containing 500 or 1000 molecular moieties (pyridine, hydrogen sulfate, molecular sulfuric acid and water, with atomic sites labelled as shown in Fig. 1) depending on the sample.\nThe full set of reference potential parameters and constraints used in the EPSR simulation model, and the total number of pyridine, hydrogen sulfate and/or sulfuric acid and water and size of each simulation box, corresponding to the experimentally\ndetermined molecular densities of the fully protiated mixtures are shown in ESI.\u2020 Charges were scaled to 0.8 e, in line with results from neutron diffraction and MD simulations of ILs.55 Here reduced charges have been shown to reproduce experimental data more effectively. This better simulates effects of electronic polarisability captured when using more expensive polarisable force fields.56"

Adjusting for the actual water content from these idealised compositions, concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) was assumed to contain 0.2 M of either H2O (in H2SO4) or D2O (in D2SO4). This was confirmed by examination of the respective measured neutron scattering levels. As such, actual compositions of the examined samples used to model the neutron scattering data were: concentrated sulfuric acid (1 : 0.2, acid : water), Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL (2 : 1 : 0.4, acid : pyridine : water) and hydrated PIL (1 : 1 : 2.2, acid : pyridine : water), as summarised in Table 1.\nThe structure of concentrated sulfuric acid was used as a baseline to compare with the structures of both PILs. The composition of the Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL, [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4, was one of the two standard acidic compositions used in our earlier catalytic studies.5,8\u201310 The aim of this work was to elucidate its structure (3D network vs. discrete anionic clusters) and understand how differences in the liquid structure of this PIL and sulfuric acid account for their different miscibilities with the ester product. Finally, the hydrated PIL, [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, with a 1 : 1 : 2.2, acid : pyridine : water ratio (ca. 17 wt% of water), was close in composition to the 20 wt% water content, cited as the optimum composition for delignification of cellulosic biomass.4,11\u201313,57 It was anticipated that particularly efficient biomass fractionation reported for this aqueous PIL composition could be tied to the speciation of water in the 1 : 1 : 2.2 mixture.\nEPSR modelling and fit to experimental data\nThe data from sulfuric acid (samples 1\u20133) was modelled using molecular descriptions of the species present (H2SO4 and H2O in a 1 : 0.2 molar ratio) \u2013 see Fig. 1. Although several more complex water species (H3O +, H5O2 +) have been reported as constituents of sulfuric acid hydrates,40\u201344 descriptors were limited to the main moieties, enabling the examination of key associations in these already complex mixtures. This approach is aligned with EPSR analysis of neutron scattering data recorded for other \u2018neat\u2019 acids (acetic acid, formic acid),58 in which molecular (undissociated) descriptions were used. The same strategy has been used in MD simulations of sulfuric acid : water mixtures59 and other \u2018neat\u2019 acids, small molecules and mixtures.52,58\u201366\nThe Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL (samples 4\u201310) and the hydrated PIL (samples 11\u201317) were modelled using fully protonated"

Additionally, the model of samples 4\u201310 contained molecular H2SO4.\nAlthough pyridine in the presence of sulfuric acid can be considered fully protonated, based on both FT-IR spectroscopy67 and crystallographic data for pyridinium hydrogen sulfate,68 an alternative \u2018free proton\u2019 model,23 (with discrete H+, labelled as HF), [HSO4]\nand H2O components in the simulation box) was also examined. However, the degree of pyridine protonation found was significantly underestimated with an average N HF coordination number of only 0.2 0.4 and with the maximum in the N HF correlation (corresponding to N\u2013H bonds in pyridinium cations) overestimated at 1.6 \u00c5. In consequence, the fullyprotonated cationic pyridinium descriptor was used.\nComparisons of experimental and simulated total structure factors, F(R), and the corresponding Fourier transforms to real space G(r) for each of the isotopically distinct experimental mixtures (Fig. 2) show the quality of fit to the experimental data. With the exception of the region at Q r 1 \u00c5 1, which is\nmost susceptible to inconsistencies due to inelastic scattering contributions from hydrogen in the data, the fitted data aligns well with experiment. For the neat sulfuric acid systems (1\u20133, Table 1), a larger degree of scattering at low Q is present in the experimental data than is captured within the EPSR model which may reflect either incomplete subtraction of the inelastic hydrogen background from the data, or additional long range order. Similar profiles are also apparent for the fully deuteriated PILs (samples 6 and 13) suggesting that some hydrogen is present, generating inelastic scattering from the sample in this region.\nCentre of mass radial distribution functions\nCentre of mass (COM) radial distribution functions (RDFs) were calculated using the SHARM routines within EPSR, for each of the components in the three systems (Fig. 3). The RDFs reveal a remarkable persistence of structure, similar between the three systems: H2SO4, [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4 and [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O.\nFig. 2 Total structure factors F(Q) (top), and the corresponding Fourier transform to real space G(r) radial distribution functions (bottom) showing experimental data (red symbols) and EPSR modelled (blue solid line) for left: sulfuric acid (H2SO4 : H2O 1 : 0.2); middle: Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL (H2SO4 : py : H2O 2 : 1 : 0.4) and right: hydrated PIL (H2SO4 : py : H2O 1 : 1 : 2.2).

The corresponding water\u2013{SO4} first shell correlation (Fig. 3, bottom, blue dotted line) is centred around 4 \u00c5 (minimum 5.5 \u00c5), and the water\u2013water RDF correlation (Fig. 3, bottom, dotted green) at 3.2 \u00c5. This is significantly longer than water\u2013water distances in bulk water (2.6 \u00c5), confirming that water molecules are confined within sulfuric acid as hydrates. Further supporting this conclusion, the water\u2013water RDF lacks a second shell peak between 4\u20136 \u00c5, that would have been indicative of \u2018free\u2019 water.\nIn both PIL systems, the cation\u2013{SO4} RDFs are characteristic of strong cation\u2013anion association, typical of ionic liquids.69 The cation\u2013anion RDFs (Fig. 3, top, green curves) exhibit a first correlation peak at 5.0\u20135.2 \u00c5 with a shoulder at 4.2 \u00c5, and a second broader correlation peak, indicative of the second shell, at ca. 9 \u00c5. The shoulder at 4.2 \u00c5 reflects the oblate topology of the pyridinium cations, allowing two distinct routes to approach its centre of mass. The cation\u2013cation first correlations (Fig. 3, top, red curves) are present at larger separations (maxima at B6 \u00c5), followed by a second shell at 9\u201310 \u00c5, overlapping with the second shell of cation\u2013anion correlations. Again, a small shoulder at ca. 4 \u00c5 in the cation\u2013cation RDFs may be due to a small number of face-to-face correlations, typical of the p\u2013p interactions observed in liquid pyridine at\ndistances below 5 \u00c5.70 Similar features are observed in aprotic ILs containing N-alkylpyridinium cations, arising from anions associating equatorially around pyridinium cations.71\u201373\nIn contrast to typical ionic liquid structure, there is very close anion\u2013anion interaction in both PILs. The corresponding {SO4}\u2013{SO4} associations (Fig. 3, top, blue dashed and solid curves) closely resemble sulfate associations in \u2018neat\u2019 sulfuric acid (first shell at 4.6 \u00c5, second one at 6.6\u201311 \u00c5). In PILs, the first correlation lengthens slightly (4.8 \u00c5), which can be attributed to the decreasing number of acidic hydrogens in the H2SO4/[HSO4] components, therefore reducing the number of available S\u2013O\u2013 H OQS hydrogen bonding motifs: from 2 per {SO4} unit in H2SO4, through 1.5 per {SO4} unit in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4, to 1 per {SO4} unit in [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O (assuming this is terminal and not bifurcated).\nThis close anion\u2013anion interaction in both PILs results in the unusual presence of both cations and anions in the first coordination shell of {SO4}. Their liquid structure combines characteristics of ionic liquid (close cation\u2013anion correlations) and of the parent sulfuric acid (sulfate\u2013sulfate organisation).\nThe water {SO4} and water [H-Py]+ RDFs (Fig. 3, bottom, blue and red lines, respectively) have their corresponding first peak correlations of 4.0 and 4.8 \u00c5. There is no significant difference in the water association with either {SO4} or [H-Py] + on changing the water content of the PILs. In contrast, water\u2013water RDFs show a marked difference. In H2SO4 and in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4, that is with low water content, H2O H2O correlation is found at 3.2 \u00c5, slightly more intense in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4. In [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, this distance decreases to 2.7 \u00c5, showing both greater self-association of water molecules and a larger number of correlations, as indicated by the increase in intensity. This distance is close to H2O H2O correlation in bulk water (2.6 \u00c5). However, lack of significant second shell correlation (4\u20136 \u00c5) indicates that there are no large-size water clusters and [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O retains water-in-IL rather than IL-in-water characteristics.\nThe similarity of RDF correlation profiles (Fig. 3), aside from the water-water correlation, suggests essentially similar liquid structure and character of both PILs, and that the presence of the water (up to 2 moles, ca. 17 wt%) does not perturb the ionion structure significantly. Moreover, the hydrogen-bonding network of sulfuric acid appears to be retained as a core structural motif in the PILs, in addition to the typical Coulombic charge screening structure usually observed in ionic liquids.\nIn the context of applications of Br\u00f8nsted acidic PILs in esterification, it was initially assumed that phase-separation of the organic phase, that is much more efficient in Br\u00f8nsted acidic PILs than in concentrated sulfuric acid, may be related to marked differences between the structures of the two liquids: H2SO4 vs. [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4. However, the results here suggest that there are greater similarities between the structure-defining associations within these liquids rather than significant differences that would explain the distinctly different phase behaviours of H2SO4 and PILs in esterification reactions.\nIn contrast, the water-in-salt structure of the hydrated PIL, [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, with negatively-charged hydrogen-bonded\nFig. 3 COM RDFs between [H-Py]+ and {SO4} (top) and between H2O and [H-Py]+ or {SO4} units (bottom) in: concentrated sulfuric acid (dotted lines), Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL (solid lines) and hydrated PIL (dashed lines), from the EPSR simulations."

The positions of first peaks within the partial RDFs of selected site\u2013site correlations and corresponding coordination numbers, calculated to the first minima after the peak, are included within the ESI.\u2020\nFig. 4 shows oxygen oxygen correlations between {SO4} groups, originating both from [HSO4]\nand H2SO4, were determined from the first peak in the site\u2013site pRDFs. In all three systems, the \u2018hetero\u2019 S\u2013OH OQS mode of correlation is dominant, appearing as a strongly defined peak in the RDF at 2.6\u20132.7 \u00c5 (Fig. 4, green line). In contrast, first contact correlations of S\u2013OH HO\u2013S and SQO OQS only occur around 3.0 \u00c5, with a peak at ca. 5 \u00c5, corresponding to the separation in the COM RDF. It is therefore evident that the primary mode of association between {SO4} groups is S\u2013OH OQS hydrogen bonding, retained from sulfuric acid in both PILs.\nCorrelation distances for concentrated H2SO4 are broadly consistent with the literature.37,46,59 Andreani et al. first\nreported data derived from direct Fourier transform of experimental X-ray and neutron scattering data,37 with S S and O O separation distances of 5.3 \u00c5 and 2.42 \u00c5. However, the S S separation, extrapolated from summation of intermolecular S\u2013O and intramolecular O\u2013O distances, appears to be over-estimated. Kameda et al.46 subsequently reported a shorter S S correlation of 4.8 \u00c5 which is more consistent with simulation between contact pairs in concentrated H2SO4/H2O (4.6 0.1 \u00c5),76 and small clusters of bulk H2SO4 (4.8 \u00c5)\n62 where an O O distance of 3.1 \u00c5 was also reported. Here, the first shell S S separation distance was determined as 4.6 \u00c5, with O O correlations between OA1 and OA2 sites (S\u2013OH OQS) at 2.6 \u00c5, and minima after this first correlation peak at 3 \u00c5. The {SO4} {SO4} coordination number (Ncoord = 11 1) between neighbouring moieties is also in agreement with the literature (Ncoord = 12),\n37,59 and confirms the formation of an extended, tetrahedral hydrogen bonded network linked through S\u2013OH OQS interactions.77\nIn both PILs, interatomic distances for the first shell O O correlations, as well as corresponding Ncoord values, are very close to sulfuric acid, suggesting hydrogen bonding of similar strength across the three samples. However, the {SO4} {SO4} first shell coordination environment (determined from S S correlations) decreases: from 11 in H2SO4, to 7.5 in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4, and to 4.8 in [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, commensurate with the reduction in the number of available S\u2013OH groups to act as hydrogen-bond donors.\nSite\u2013site RDFs between water (Ow/Hw) and sulfate units are shown in Fig. 5. For the concentrated acid and anhydrous acidic PIL, the presence of ca. 0.2 mole fraction of water leads to a broad peak in the Ow O1/O2 RDFs between B2.6\u20133.0 \u00c5 (Fig. 5, dashed lines). The Hw OQS correlation at 1.8 \u00c5 (Fig. 5, solid blue lines) indicates directional hydrogenbonding retained between the acid and PILs.\nFig. 4 O O correlations; SQO OQS (red), S\u2013OH HO\u2013S (blue) and SQO HO\u2013S (green) in conc.

            "text": "There is a remarkable retention of the correlation pattern across the three systems examined, as shown in the pRDFs, and it is interesting to explore whether this translates to the retention of the network structure present in sulfuric acid to PILs, despite the reduced number of acidic S\u2013OH sites and the introduction of [H-Py]+ cations.\nSpatial distribution functions (SDFs) in Fig. 8 are plotting the top 15% probability for correlations within the first coordination shell.\nFor sulfuric acid, {SO4} {SO4} correlations (Fig. 8(a), yellow surface) show a pronounced tetrahedral symmetry with four high probability nodes, each sitting over a triangular face of the {SO4} tetrahedron, bridged by six bands bisecting O\u2013S\u2013O edges. The SDF map shows holes around each oxygen atom, presumably occupied by hydrogen atoms participating in S\u2013OH OQS bonding from adjacent acids in the first coordination shell. The weakly correlated association of water molecules with sulfuric acid, shown in Fig. 5 RDFs, is also evident in the SDF, (Fig. 8(a), green surface), lacking a distinct spatial ordering. Plotting water\u2013sulfuric acid SDF at 50% probability (ESI\u2020) shows a non-defined spherical distribution.\nStructure refinement for [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4 was made with two different {SO4} moieties: [HSO4] and [H2SO4]. Comparable\ndistributions of both species with a central reference [HSO4] were found, and are plotted as merged functions, forming the same sulfuric acid-like tetrahedral distribution (Fig. 8(b), yellow surface). The equivalent SDFs around H2SO4 are included in the ESI.\u2020 Compared to H2SO4, the symmetry of the distribution of {SO4} {SO4} association was somewhat reduced, with the S\u2013OH site in [HSO4]\nshowing a greater probability density than the corresponding S\u2013O oxygens. This is a consequence of the change in relative numbers of S\u2013OH and OQS oxygens in the system, from 1 : 1 to 3 : 4, reducing the relative proportion of hydrogen-bond donor to acceptor sites. In contrast, distribution of H2O molecules around [HSO4]\n(Fig. 8(b), green surface) was more structured in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4 than it was in H2SO4, tracking to the positions of {SO4} moieties in the first shell.\nLikewise, [H-Py]+ cations (Fig. 8(b), green surface) show correlations in these positions, in an approximately tetrahedral distribution with maxima associated with each triangular face of {SO4} reflecting the association through hydrogen-bond donation from [H-Py]+ cations to OQS sites (see Fig. 7). Both the water and [H-Py]+ SDFs around [HSO4]\nare truncated over the acidic S\u2013OH group, as a result of the predominance of this site as a hydrogen-bond donor to other {SO4} units, rather than a hydrogen-bond acceptor.\nIn the hydrated PIL, [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, the S\u2013OH to OQS ratio is reduced to 1 : 3, which results in closer {SO4} {SO4} association through the remaining S\u2013OH site in [HSO4] (Fig. 8(d), yellow surface). The reduced number of the S\u2013OH hydrogen bond donors leads to increased correlation of water with the OQS sites (Fig. 8(d), green surface), consistent with the increased magnitude and definition of the Hw O2 pRDF (Fig. 5).\nSolvation environments around [H-Py]+ in both PILs are characterised by very similar spatial distributions of {SO4}, in a band above/below the pyridinium ring, straddling the N\u2013H site (Fig. 8(c) and (e), yellow surface). Water occupies similar positions, and also arranges more broadly within the equatorial plane of the [H-Py]+ ring, especially in the hydrated PIL (Fig. 8(c) and (e), yellow surface). It is in alignment with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor via Ow H\u2013N and to a lesser extent Ow H\u2013C hydrogens of the pyridine ring (Fig. 7).\nFinally, the [H-Py]+ [H-Py]+ SDFs (Fig. 8(c) and (e), blue surface) show a broad correlation around the C2/C3 positions of pyridinium rings, that even plotting the top 15% probability is highly diffuse and non-specific.\nOverall, from H2SO4, through the Br\u00f8nsted acidic PIL, and to the hydrated PIL, the first shell environment of the {SO4} moiety shows a transition from a highly symmetric tetrahedral distribution of acid {SO4} groups towards an increased probability density for {SO4} {SO4} association at the S\u2013OH position, as a function of the increase in anionic OQS oxygens relative to S\u2013OH acid groups. This is evident in [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4 through the larger node at the S\u2013OH site, with water\u2013{SO4} and [H-Py]+ {SO4} correlations to sites associated with the OQS oxygens. For [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O, the highest probability SDF correlations between [HSO4] anions are with the S\u2013OH site,\nFig. 8 Spatial distribution functions (SDFs) showing the first shell environments around H2SO4 (a), [Hpy][HSO4] H2SO4 (b) and (c), and [Hpy][HSO4] 2H2O (d) and (e), presenting the {SO4} (a), (b), (d) and [HPy]+ (c), (e) environments, with the nitrogen-site of [H-Py]+ pointing up. All SDFs are plotted to show the top 15% probability for correlation within the first shell, determined from the first minimum in the corresponding COM RDFs (Fig. 3). The [HSO4] /H2SO4 moieties are shown in yellow, H2O in green and [H-Py]+ in blue."

Remarkably, across all three systems a strong tetrahedral structure is retained, irrespective of the changes in relative {SO4} and water distributions in the first correlation shell. All systems show the same tetrahedral pattern, despite differences in the first shell.

            "text": "The RDFs indicate that anion\u2013cation correlations between protonated [H-py]+ cations and [HSO4]\nanions typical of ionic liquids (and molten salts)69 are formed in both the \u2018anhydrous\u2019 acidic PIL and \u2018hydrated\u2019 PIL with charge screening between alternate oppositely charged ions. However, in addition to the formation of this typical cation\u2013anion ionic liquid structure,\nthe overall tetrahedral network structure, directed by hydrogenbonding around the {SO4} groups in \u2018neat\u2019 sulfuric acid is persistent and retained in the PILs. This is complemented by interactions with the [H-Py]+ cations (as can be seen in the presence of correlation nodes between [H-Py+] and OQS sites in 2 : 1 : 0.4 \u2018anhydrous\u2019 acidic PIL) and increasingly, by replacement of acidic S\u2013OH hydrogen bond donors by water molecules in the 1 : 1 : 2.2 \u2018hydrated\u2019 PIL to retain the supramolecular {SO4}-network present in the parent sulfuric acid.\nAs such, it is clear that the \u2018anhydrous\u2019 acidic 2 : 1 : 0.2 PIL retains many features of concentrated sulfuric acid in terms of both acidity10 and network structure, while simultaneously adopting the anticipated anion\u2013cation correlation pattern characteristic of ionic liquids. Consequently, difference in phase behaviour between sulfuric acid and PILs, which result, for example, in different performances as solvents for biomass fractionation or esterification reactions, cannot be attributed directly to differences in the liquid structures as the \u2018anhydrous\u2019 acidic PIL strongly resembles \u2018neat\u2019 sulfuric acid. The addition of 2 moles of water (ca. 17 wt%) provides additional hydrogen bond donation capacity to complement and replace the diminished number of S\u2013OH hydrogen-bond donors present in the parent acid. This results in a change in the nature of the first shell hydrogen-bond donors around [HSO4]\nanions, but not in the overall pattern of hydrogen bonding. This \u2018hydrated\u2019 sulfuric acid : pyridine : water (1 : 1 : 2.2) system has an equivalent water content to that of the aqueous alkylammonium PILs reported by Hallett et al.4,11,12,57,81\u201386 as media for delignification for cellulosic biomass, with ca. 15 wt% water in the IL. It is clear that the water molecules here are present as \u2018bound\u2019 water participating in the ionic liquid solvation structure and not as \u2018free\u2019 water. That is, the system can be viewed as one with water-in-IL rather than as a concentrated IL-in-water environment.\nThis finding allows for certain speculations in terms of phase behaviour. In esterification reactions, where water and ester are generated, the ionic liquid gradually binds water incorporated in the hydrogen sulfate network, without the formation of \u2018bulk\u2019 water that can contribute to the reverse reaction of ester hydrolysis. The resulting hydrated PIL is more hydrophilic, which contributes to a lower affinity to the ester products and, in consequence, enhanced phase separation. Likewise, it appears that the \u2018\u2018composite\u2019\u2019 anionic structure of water-doped PIL has a higher propensity to dissolve lignin, its structure being different from that of anhydrous IL, but unlikely to contain \u2018\u2018bulk\u2019\u2019 water at the optimised ratios of 10\u201340% (1 : 1 : 2 composition amounts to ca. 20% water by weight).\nThese conclusions are aligned with the available experimental evidence, but nevertheless remain speculative. Further evidence can be provided by the study of solvation of model compounds in wet and dry PILs by neutron scattering, more advanced computational approaches, or thermodynamic studies of the energy of solvation."
