    "abstractText": "CarbON CII line in post-rEionization and ReionizaTiOn (CONCERTO) is a low-resolution spectrometer with an instantaneous field-of-view of 18.6 arcmin, operating in the 130\u2013310 GHz transparent atmospheric window. It is installed on the 12-meter Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope at 5 100 m above sea level. The Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) contains two focal planes hosting a total of 4 304 kinetic inductance detectors. The FTS interferometric pattern is recorded on the fly while continuously scanning the sky. One of the goals of CONCERTO is to characterize the large-scale structure of the Universe by observing the integrated emission from unresolved galaxies. This methodology is an innovative technique and is called line intensity mapping. In this paper, we describe the CONCERTO instrument, the effect of the vibration of the FTS beamsplitter, and the status of the CONCERTO main survey.",

            "text": "The CarbON CII line in post-rEionization and ReionizaTiOn (CONCERTO) instrument has been designed to provide a breakthrough in wide field-of-view (FoV) spectroscopy at millimeter (mm) wavelengths with its large mapping speed and multi-frequency capabilities. The primary scientific target is the observation of [CII]-emission line at redshift z \u22655.2 using line intensity mapping (LIM). This is also one of the main goals of CCAT-prime1 and TIME.2 Line intensity mapping consists of retrieving the 3-D information of the line intensity fluctuations, by measuring angular fluctuations in the brightness of the sky, rather than seeing individual point sources. The time (third) dimension, beyond the two sky coordinates, is obtained by observing at several electromagnetic frequencies where the line is redshifted in correspondence with different epochs. The [CII] line is among the brightest lines originating from star-forming galaxies and it is a reliable tracer of star formation on global scale. The ultimate goal is to answer the questions of whether dusty star-formation contributes to early galaxy evolution, and whether dusty galaxies play an important role in reionization. The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field is the selected region for the CONCERTO LIM survey.3 It has already been extensively observed both on visible-IR photometry and spectroscopy which will be highly beneficial for the foregrounds subtraction in the LIM.4\nCONCERTO is based on two arrays for a total of 4 304 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) coupled to a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) in the \u201cfast scanning\u201d technique5 for interferometric pattern sampling: we record the spectrum on the fly (otf) while continuously mapping on-sky.\nIn this paper, we introduce the CONCERTO technical main characteristics, the effect of the FTS beamsplitter vibration, and the status of the [CII] survey. In Sect. 2, we describe the CONCERTO instrument. Section 3 presents a peculiar challenge of on-ground FTSs, the vibrations in the instrument have to be controlled and minimized. Finally, Sect. 4 presents the instrument mapping strategy and the status of the observations of the COSMOS field."

            "text": "CONCERTO has been designed with the following constraints in mind:6 1) the maximization of the sensitivity and the minimization of the detectors\u2019 time response, 2) the large coverage both on sky-area and electromagnetic band (130\u2013310 GHz), 3) the absolute spectral resolution down to 1.5 GHz and the moderate angular resolution (central beam width of \u223c 30 arcsec in the 195\u2013310 GHz band). For such requirements, CONCERTO consists of a fast FTS and registers a full interferometric pattern of 70 mm in length (forward and backward) at \u223c2.48 Hz (\u223c0.40 s) by exploiting the fast response of two arrays of lumped element KIDs,7 granting a single point sampling at 3 813 Hz (0.26 ms). Fourier transform spectroscopy consists of measuring the output intensity of an interferometer for a varying optical path difference (OPD) between two arms of the interferometer itself, which is typically achieved with a moving roof mirror.8 The interferogram is then analyzed by Fourier transform and the spectrum is obtained. In ground-based experiments, the fast sampling of the interferograms is crucial to deal with the atmospheric fluctuations and properly calibrate the signal.9 In addition, FTS allows us to exploit a larger instantaneous FoV with respect to other spectrometric solutions (e.g., grating or Fabry-Perot) or dispersive elements (prism or dichroic filters). In the FTS, the single pixel detects the whole electromagnetic signal and records a full interferogram. Rather than the single-pixel efficiency, the gain is obtained by adopting large format arrays, increasing the mapping speed. In other words, the FTS permits the exploitation of a single large array by multiplexing the electromagnetic frequencies.\nIn CONCERTO, a linear motor controls the moving mirror motion responsible for the OPD. The motor size exceeds 0.5 m in length and 3 kg in mass. A second, twin, motor counterbalances the linear momentum associated with the moving mass by oscillating with an opposite instantaneous velocity.3\nThe CONCERTO spectrometer exhibits two orthogonal focal planes which host the frequency-overlapping high-frequency (HF, 195\u2013310 GHz) and the low-frequency (LF, 130\u2013270 GHz) arrays, respectively. Among the possible FTS implementations, we adopted the Martin-Puplett interferometer (MPI) configuration.10 The projection of the last MPI polarizer selects the two focal planes, which are in reflection (HF) and transmission (LF)\nwith respect to the polarizer placed at 45 deg\u2217. Each of the twelve readout lines (six per array) is connected to a custom readout board, with a maximum multiplexing factor of 400 over a bandwidth of 1 GHz.11 The focal plane is cooled-down to 60 mK (with stabilization of 0.1 mK) by a custom 3He/4He dilution refrigerator coupled to a Pulse-Tube for the higher-temperature stages. The CONCERTO dilution refrigerator is specially conceived to preserve its temperature stability at inclinations up to 75 deg for the mixing chamber, allowing us to operate at telescope elevation comprised in the range of 15\u201390 deg.\nThe instrumental characteristics of CONCERTO measured during the 2021-commissioning campaign on the sky are summarized in Table 1."

            "heading": "3. MIRROR MOTION AND VIBRATIONS ON THE BEAMSPLITTER",
            "text": "The precise sampling of the interferograms and the systematics control are two fundamental aspects that have to be taken into account in an FTS. If on the one side each interferogram needs to be recorded rapidly (typically <1 s13), on the other side the demanding technological requirements are tricky to handle. Concerning sampling speed, the acquisition rate is set by the need of properly sample the interferogram. Concerning vibrations, both technological counter measurements and operational compromises have to be adopted: spiral springs, magnetic breaks, counter motors, and acceleration optimization on the motor.3,8\nIn CONCERTO, a peculiar effect interests the instrument: the roof mirror motion creates a wind flow that induces oscillations in the FTS beamsplitter with a resonance at \u223c47.25 Hz\u2020 causing a complex perturbation on the OPD. This is the consequence of the large beamsplitter area, a large (480\u00d7800 mm2) elliptic 50\u00b5m-thick membrane of polyimide on which lie 50\u00b5m of copper wires with a pitch of 100\u00b5m. The video linked in Fig. 1 shows this effect on a twin CONCERTO beamsplitter in the laboratory. This setup was conceived to reproduce the wind flow with the sound wave created by a speaker that makes vibrating the membrane.\nSeveral solutions can be envisaged to mitigate and control this effect: 1) the use of a metallic wire-grid polarizer to replace the membrane-based beamsplitter, 2) the installation of a cross rigid support to attenuate and shift the oscillation at higher frequencies, 3) the real-time measurement of the OPD distortions, by directly measuring the vibrations on the beamsplitter, and 4) the development of an active feedback system capable to counter the oscillations with proper sound waves. The first two solutions could not be adopted because, respectively: 1) the wire-grid polarizers are not produced with the CONCERTO size, and 2) mechanical support would reduce the optical efficiency.\nWe implemented the last two solutions by installing a laser sensor pointing to the center of the beamsplitter in December 2021. This laser both measures the vibrations (around the nominal position) of the beamsplitter\n\u2217The polarizer is mechanically installed at 48 deg with respect to the perpendicular axis of the instrument to take into account the wire grid projection.\n\u2020This is the value of the resonance frequency for the specific polarizer used in CONCERTO.\nand allows us to calculate the related acoustic counter-wave to be applied for minimizing the oscillations. The counter feedback system consists of a laser sensor, a dedicated mini-PC that calculates the counter-wave function, and two sound speakers as shown in Fig. 2.\nWe performed several experiments to determine the cause of the beamsplitter vibrations and to characterize it in amplitude and frequency. Firstly, we investigated the origin of the oscillation by studying its amplitude in different setups, as shown in Fig. 3. In this study, we adopted three different MPI configurations with respect to the roof mirror: completely stopped (off), spanning 30 mm and 70 mm at \u223c2.48 Hz (\u223c0.40 s). In the same experiment, we had explored an external cause for the beamsplitter oscillation, the Cassegrain cabin (C-cabin) wind flow produced by the fans of the air cooling system (so-called Menerga). In addition, we pointed the telescope at different elevation angles to understand if there is a correlation with the oscillation amplitude. In principle, the beamsplitter is aligned with the rotation axis of the elevation, notwithstanding, a fraction of a degree in the misalignment in the angle might be tolerated. The study suggests that the larger contribution\nof the beamsplitter vibrations comes from the MPI mirror, wherein in the 70 mm case we reach a top-speed of \u223c175 mm/s and in the 30 mm case \u223c75 mm/s. The contribution of the Menerga cooling system is minor compared to that visible from the MPI off case, where the power spectral density (PSD) slightly increases when the cooling system is activated (Menerga on). On the other hand, no clear relation with the elevation angle is found as shown in Fig. 3.\nSecondly, we studied the correlation between the oscillation and the time-ordered signal on the KIDs. As shown, in Fig. 4 on the left, the correlation is visible with the counter feedback system off. When the counter feedback system is on, as shown in Fig. 4 on the right, it reduces the beamsplitter vibrations by a factor >7 (peak-peak).\nFinally, we characterized the oscillation in the frequency domain by studying its recorded signal by Fourier transform in different mirror-motion configurations, as shown in Fig. 5. While the spanning length of the roof\nmirror is fixed by the scientific requirements (70 mm for the desired spectral resolution3), the motor speed has some margins. Its motion curve is designed to quickly stabilize the mirror speed, by strongly accelerating it (up to 8 m/s2), and obtaining a homogeneous sampling of the interferogram. In Figure 5, the number of sampling points corresponds to the number of points acquired during a whole forward/backward mirror motion. We show the fastest configuration with 1 536 points (\u223c0.40 s) of sampling and the alternative one at 2 048 points (\u223c0.54 s) with and without the counter feedback system. We adopted the lower speed to mitigate the wind flow for the new observations. At the same time, we better reconstruct the interferograms. As an additional effect, by adopting the 2048-point configuration and activating the counter feedback system, the \u223c47.20 Hz oscillation is shifted at a lower frequency (46.50 Hz), as shown in Fig. 5."

            "text": "The main scientific driver of the CONCERTO project is the observation of the [CII] line in the COSMOS14 field. This sky-patch of COSMOS covers a square of 72\u00d772 arcmin2 centered on 150.12 deg right ascension and 2.21 deg in declination. The designed observing strategy takes into account the MPI necessity to sample a full interferogram to retrieve a whole electromagnetic spectrum before moving to the next spatial pixel. This sets a limit on the telescope scanning speed. Each point in the sky (defined by a beam width, i.e., 30 arcsec for HF and 35 arcsec for LF) has to be measured with, at least, a whole interferogram. We sample a full doubleinterferogram (forward/backward) in a fraction of a second (0.40 s or 0.54 s, respectively for the 1 536 and the 2 048 points cases) and we fix the telescope maximum scanning speed at 40 arcsec/s. We have, thus, at least 2.13 full forward/backward mirror motions per beam width (a total of 4.16 interferograms)\u2021. In addition, the adopted mapping strategy has been conceived to reach the highest level of homogeneity of sky coverage. Figure 6 shows the simulated and the observed complete COSMOS loop scanning, composed of two otf scans in raster scanning pattern and four raster scanning (step and integrate) with spiral strokes feature. On the up-left figure, in vertical and horizontal black lines, we recognize the vertical and horizontal otf raster, respectively. Every shape similar to a thick circle (a spiral spanning a 4\u03c0-angle at low radial velocity) is a stroke of the point-and-integrate raster. The two different techniques are adopted to ensure a mix in the observations\u2019 angles and mitigate risks related\n\u2021This result is obtained by taking the worst scenario, the number of full mirror motions per beam width, N, being calculated following N = 40 arcsec s\u22121/30 arcsec/0.54 s \u2248 2.13\nto systematics induced by the scanning strategy. On-the-fly raster ensures a constant speed on the telescope scanning, while spiral strokes scanning involves high telescope speed when it reaches the end of the stroke.\nA whole single loop requires \u223c2.35 hours and translates into 6 files for a total data amount of \u223c1 TBytes.\nWe observed a total of 314 hours on the COSMOS project (including overheads) from July 2021 to May 2022, from the European Southern Observatory (ESO)\u00a7 and Onsala Space Observatory (OSO)\u00b6 allocated time and a further 55 hours on Chilean allocated time. By stacking the maps for the 637 central KIDs in the HF array we obtain a measurement of the root mean squared (RMS) noise of the maps. Without relevant systemic errors, we expect that the RMS noise decreases as a function of the integration time (t), following a simple relation:\nRMS(t) \u221d 1 t\u03b2 , (1)\n\u00a7https://www.eso.org \u00b6https://www.chalmers.se/en/researchinfrastructure/oso/Pages/default.aspx\nwhere \u03b2 is expected to be \u223c0.5. Figure 7 shows the result of this fit in arbitrary units (a.u.). We found \u03b2=0.51\u00b10.01 with a Pearson correlation coefficient \u03c1 = 0.998 and a p-value p < 10\u221255. The fit with the Eq. 1 acts as a continuous quick look at the observations status: the RMS evolves following a \u221d 1/ \u221a t law suggesting that no major issue is highlighted in the observations in terms of overall noise. In addition, Fig. 7 shows the mapping efficiency. We obtain an average efficiency of 79\u00b18%, which is calculated as the ratio between the on-source time and the total time dedicated to COSMOS observations. The overheads include scan failures, pointing, telescope slew and focus sessions. This is consistent with the 70 % value estimated during the scientific case definition.3"

            "text": "The CONCERTO installation team arrived at APEX on the 6th of April 2021; four days after (the 10th) the first cool-down took place, and the working temperature of 60 mK was reached just two days after on the 12th of April. We collected 369 hours of observation time on the COSMOS project (including overheads) from July 2021 to May 2022, from the ESO, OSO and Chilean allocated time. The first [CII] LIM survey at high mapping speed with a wide-band low-resolution spectrometer represents a pathfinder experiment and has breakthrough potential in the large-scale evolution of the Universe.\nIn this paper, we have introduced the CONCERTO instrument and its main characteristics. We have also described and analyzed the main systematic effect that has been found to be related to the vibrations of the beamsplitter membrane. We presented the adopted solution as well as the promising results of its analysis in various configurations. Finally, we described the mapping strategy as well as the recent result on the observation status of the COSMOS field."
