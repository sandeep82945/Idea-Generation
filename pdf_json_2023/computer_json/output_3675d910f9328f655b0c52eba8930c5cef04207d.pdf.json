    "abstractText": "The use of the 7-Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promises improved imaging quality and higher resolution compared with lower-field MRI systems. The design of the loop coil considers the tradeoff between coil size and performance. A larger coil enables deeper field penetration, but it may result in poorer field uniformity and localization. On the other hand, a smaller coil offers improved localization capabilities, however, field penetration reduces, and multiple coil elements are required to cover the same space as large coils. Additionally, safety concerns regarding the high-energy absorption of electromagnetic waves in healthy tissues principally limit the use of the 7T MRI, which is measured with the specific absorption rate (SAR). A coil that can generate a uniform magnetic field while maintaining a low SAR is necessary to comply with the SAR limits. We propose a coil design that recirculates the current and provides a phase shift in the same structure to provide a magnetic field over a broad area, thus reducing the number of channels required to cover the same area. We present electromagnetic (EM) simulations of the proposed coil with a magnetic field and SAR computed for the brain and human spine model. We build the coil and acquire images with a phantom using a 7T MRI system. The proposed coil improves the SAR by 43% compared with the reference coil in the spinal area in the case of EM simulations, indicating the imaging quality improvement potential of our proposed coil.

Additionally, safety concerns regarding the high-energy absorption of electromagnetic waves in healthy tissues principally limit the use of the 7T MRI, which is measured with the specific absorption rate (SAR). A coil that can generate a uniform magnetic field while maintaining a low SAR is necessary to comply with the SAR limits. We propose a coil design that recirculates the current and provides a phase shift in the same structure to provide a magnetic field over a broad area, thus reducing the number of channels required to cover the same area. We present electromagnetic (EM) simulations of the proposed coil with a magnetic field and SAR computed for the brain and human spine model. We build the coil and acquire images with a phantom using a 7T MRI system. The proposed coil improves the SAR by 43% compared with the reference coil in the spinal area in the case of EM simulations, indicating the imaging quality improvement potential of our proposed coil.\nINDEX TERMS MRI, Antennas, Spine imaging, EM simulations.\nI. INTRODUCTION Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an essential diagnostic tool in medicine, allowing noninvasive imaging of biological structures and processes [1- 2]. MRI has revolutionized spinal imaging, allowing detailed assessment of spinal cord lesions and anomalies [3-5]. Spinal diseases, such as tumors, herniated discs, and spinal stenosis can cause pain, disability, and even paralysis, making accurate diagnosis and treatment essential. MRI offers high resolution and contrast, enabling early and accurate detection of spinal cord pathologies [6]. Advances in MRI technology, including stronger magnetic fields and improved coil designs, can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spinal imaging, leading to better clinical outcomes. Over the years, significant advancements have been made in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance image quality and resolution. This has led to the emergence of higher magnetic field systems,\nincluding 7 Tesla (7T) MRI [7-9]. The utilization of 7T MRI scanners offers several advantages, most notably the ability to acquire images with higher spatial resolution, enabling detailed visualization of anatomical structures and improved diagnostic capabilities. While 7T MRI offers the potential for high-quality spinal imaging, it also poses certain challenges due to the higher frequency of electromagnetic waves utilized [10-12]. The nonuniformity of the magnetic field, resulting from the shortening of the wavelength, poses a significant limitation in 7T MRI. Furthermore, 7T MRI can lead to higher energy absorption by tissues, which must be taken into consideration. Consequently, safety concerns regarding the use of high-energy electromagnetic waves have recently been addressed, and approvals for brain imaging have been granted. However, further studies are still required to address safety concerns and optimize the technology for spinal and body imaging. Thus, this study designs a coil for\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

When it comes to transmission, coils capable of generating a uniform field and maintaining a low specific absorption rate (SAR) are preferred. On the other hand, for reception, coils with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are desirable [20-21]. Consequently, it is important for the coils to be effectively decoupled to minimize correlated noise. Furthermore, the utilization of combined transmit/receive coils has demonstrated its utility in various imaging scenarios.\nThe relationship between the size of a loop coil\nwith the produced magnetic B1 field and the SNR [20, 21] has been previous investigated; indicating that the penetration rate and SNR are proportional to the diameter of the coil [20, 22-24]. Hence, when it comes to imaging larger anatomical regions like the spine and torso, the necessity arises for larger coils capable of generating a B1 field at greater distances within the patient. However, the use of large coils introduces the challenge of producing non-uniform B1 fields, particularly at higher frequencies such as 300 MHz, which is employed in 7T MRI systems. Conversely, small coils have higher sensitivities and better spatial resolution [19,20]. Moreover, they can be combined with additional coils to form arrays that provide parallel imaging capabilities for both transmission and reception [25-27]. Theoretically, increasing the number of channels would provide a better MR image. However, in practice, a large number of coils is disadvantageous in terms of the complexity of the structure, cable management, and coupling between coils. Furthermore, the number of channels is limited by the radio-frequency RF transmitter and the number of reception channels in the spectrometer [28]. This study investigates the use of a coil that can recirculate the current to provide a magnetic B1 field in a large area when compared with a single-loop coil while providing a similar B1 field with an array of loop coils. We investigate the use of the proposed design for brain and spinal imaging. We performed electromagnetic simulations to determine the geometry and coil performance, build the coil, and test it by acquiring images using a 7T MRI scanner. We compare the proposed coil with a conventional loop-array coil arrangement."

The central coil was divided into two semicircles, creating a gap in which\nan adjacent semicircle was added to allow the current to flow in the same direction. Capacitors were placed at both ends of the structure to return the current the semicircles. The 3D model and geometry of the proposed coil are shown in Fig. 1a. The coil is constructed as a circular shape with a radius r and a specified number n of cycles tn. Capacitors are strategically positioned within the coil as depicted in the illustration. While the overall geometry of the coil resembles an array of circular loop coils arranged along the perimeter, the proposed coil does not require capacitors to connect and complete individual loops. The current flow within this structure is carefully designed to ensure that the phase of each individual turn contributes constructively to the overall magnetic field. The direction of the current flow is indicated by arrows in Figure 1a. We conducted three analyses based on an electromagnetic simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coil. The first analysis is a comparison between a single channel of the recycle self-phase-shift current coil (which will be referred as recycle-coil), a large rectangular coil, and an array of three channels with the same geometry as the recyclecoil. The second analysis was an implementation of recyclecoil for the brain array and a comparison with a standard loop array coil. The third analysis was based on a spine coil, in which the recycle-coil was compared with a planar loop array.\nElectromagnetic (EM) simulations were performed using commercial software (Sim4Life ZMT, https://www.zmt.swiss). The coils were excited with a Gaussian pulse input voltage source of 300 MHz central frequency and 600 MHz bandwidth; every conductor line was treated as a perfect electrical conductor . The EM simulations magnetic B1 field and SAR maps were computed. Each port was tuned and matched to 50 \u2126 using an LC network circuit. A human model (DUKE) provided by the simulation software [29] was used to compute the B1 field and SAR maps for each coil configuration. This model comprised 72 tissues, bones, and organs with high detail. The model also provided electrical properties, such as conductivity and permittivity for each tissue, and the value of each tissue electrical properties was updated according to a central frequency of 300 MHz. These values were provided by the software database, which is based on previous studies [30]."

This analysis aimed to demonstrate the possibility of achieving a similar field performance with fewer channels or elements. Based on this analysis, the number of coils can be reduced while maintaining a similar performance.\nIn this analysis, the reference coil array was based on 24 elements, comprising three rows along the Z-axis and eight elements in each row around the Z-axis, as shown in Fig. 2a. Each circular coil was designed with an inner radius of 40 mm. These coils were then positioned around a cylindrical structure with a diameter of 290 mm to match the dimensions of the head model, extending along a length of 260 mm. The individual coils were arranged to conform to the shape of the cylinder. A separation of 5 mm in the normal plane was used to avoid connections between the coils in each row. The eight coils in the X-Y plane were excited with a phase shift of 45\u00b0 between adjacent coils to form a uniform B1 field at the center of the coil. The performance of the recycle-coil was demonstrated for two cases: one in which an 8-channel coil array was used, where each channel consists of three cycles, thus covering the same space as the 24-channel reference coil. The recycle-coil consisted of three cycles with an internal radius of 40 mm and was placed around a cylindrical structure of radius and height of 290 and 260 mm, respectively. The geometry and position with reference to the head model are shown in Fig. 2b, where each coil element was assigned an angle of 45\u00b0 between adjacent coils. The coil configuration of Fig. 2a-b are used for fair comparison since they have the same geometry.

The choice of 2 \u00b5T was based on the requirement of a rectangular pulse with a duration of 3ms to achieve a flip angle of 90\u00b0. By normalizing the input power in this manner, an average specific absorption rate (SAR) of 10 g was computed, allowing for a direct comparison between the reference and proposed recycle-coil designs.

The recycle-coil of Fig. 1a was tuned with capacitors of 4 pF and matched to 50 \u2126. Similarly, three single-loop coil arrays and a large rectangular coil were tuned. Notably, because the proposed coil is a single channel, coupling is not considered. However, decoupling should be considered in the case of the array of three channels. Coupling can be reduced by overlapping the coils, which also reduces the coverage area as well. The S21 and S31 parameter values at 300 MHz were\n-13 and -27 dB, respectively, at the position without overlapping. This situation was considered when the same geometric structure as the recycle-coil was compared.\nTo demonstrate the current flow of the proposed, recyclecoil, Fig. 5 compares the current density J on the surface of the array of three channels in Fig. 5a and for the recycle-coil in Fig. 5b. It is evident that the recycle coil can produce the same current distribution as that of the three separate channel array coils.\nThe B1 fields obtained for each coil structure are presented in Fig. 6, for which the field was normalized to 2 \u00b5T at the location marked with a green circle. The B1 field in the X-Y plane at the center of the coil for the large rectangular coil, array of three channels, and recycle-coil is shown in Fig. 6 a-c, respectively. Similarly, the B1 field in the Z-Y plane is shown in Fig. 6 d-f. The line profile was selected as indicated in Fig. 6d and plotted in Fig. 6g, which indicated that the field intensity of the recycle-coil was similar to that of the large rectangular coil, whereas the field intensity of the array of three channels was 30% lower at the selected distances. The mean value and the coefficient of variation of the B1 field at the selected region-of-interest ROI (indicated in the yellow box in Fig. 6d) for the Z-Y plane was 1.3/0.04, 1.3/0.08, and 1.3/0.01 \u03bcT for the large rectangular coil, the array of three channels, and recycle-coil, respectively.

The maximum and mean SAR for the large rectangular coil, array of three channels, and singlechannel recycle-coil were 44/1.9, 33/2.3, and 30/1.2, respectively. Thus, the use of the recycle-coil can improve the B1 field uniformity by 25% compared with the array of three channels, whereas the maximum SAR was reduced by 31% compared with the large rectangular coil.\nBRAIN ARRAY SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe coupling analysis based on the S1j-parameter of the 24- channel loop coil array and 8-channel recycle-coil is plotted in Fig. 8a-b, respectively. In the case of the 24-channel loop coil array, the Sij parameter exhibited a range of -41 dB to -8 dB, indicating the presence of coupling between the coils. This highlights the importance of implementing decoupling methods to mitigate the coupling effects. On the other hand, when the recycle-coil was used, the coupling was significantly reduced, with Sij parameter values ranging from -60 dB to -20 dB. The recycle-coil design demonstrates improved decoupling performance, reducing the need for additional decoupling methods.\nThe magnetic fields acquired using the 24-channels loop coil array, 8-channels recycle-coil, and 16-channels recyclecoil are shown in Fig. 9a-c. The left, middle, and right columns show the field in the X-Y plane of the center of the coil, the area of the lateral ventricles in the brain area, and the Z-Y plane at the center of the coil, respectively.

The capacitors were chosen through an empirical process to obtain a low peak value of S11 at the target frequency of 297.4 MHz.

The red square indicates the region where the standard deviation was measured, and the yellow boxes show the place where the mean value was computed to calculate the SNR of each image.\nThe SNR for the axial view for the R1/R2 is 25/11, 28/4 and 32/17, for the reference coil, 3- and 5-cycle recycle-coil arrays, respectively. In the same manner the SNR for the ROI R3/R4 in the sagittal view were 55/17, 95/57, 107/76, for the reference coil, 3- and 5-cycle recycle-coil arrays, respectively. It can be seen that the proposed 5-cycle recycle coil can provide higher SNR and image quality than the reference coil. The 5-cycle recycle coil has an SNR of almost two times larger than the reference coil while the 3-cycle recycle coil had 70% better SNR than the reference coil."

The number of channels required to acquire the field was reduced from 15 to 3. A limitation of the proposed coil is its capability to perform parallel imaging in the direction of the coil position. Another limitation of the present work is that we did not conduct in vivo experiments in this study owing to the failure to obtain institutional review board IRB approval. The proposed coil can be extended to the extremes and torso imaging as well as various MRI field strengths, such as 1.5 and 3 T. In future studies we plan to perform in vivo experiments and apply it to different applications such as animal imaging or preclinical studies."
