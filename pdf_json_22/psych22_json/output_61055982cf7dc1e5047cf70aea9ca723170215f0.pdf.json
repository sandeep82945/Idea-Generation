    "abstractText": "Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has been a psychological burden worldwide, especially for individuals with eating disorders (EDs). In addition, the healthy sisters of patients with EDs are known to present specific psychological vulnerabilities. This study evaluates differences between the general population, patients with EDs, and their healthy sisters. Method A group of 233 participants (91 patients with EDs, 57 of their healthy sisters and 85 community women) was enrolled in an online survey on general and specific psychopathology 1 year after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey examined associations between posttraumatic symptoms and depression, anxiety, obsessive\u2013compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, and eating-related concerns. Results Clinically relevant scores for posttraumatic disorders were found in patients with EDs. Healthy sisters scored similarly to patients for avoidance. Regression analysis showed specific associations between interpersonal sensitivity and posttraumatic symptomatology in patients and healthy sisters, but not in community women. Conclusion The psychological burden in patients with EDs is clinically relevant and linked to interpersonal sensitivity, obsessive\u2013compulsiveness, and global symptom severity. Differences between patients, healthy sisters, and community women are discussed regarding vulnerability factors for EDs. Level of evidence Level III: evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case\u2013control analytic studies.",

Both patients and the general population reported escalations of eating symptomatology linked to COVID-19 restrictions [6] or exposure to traumatic and uncertain times [7, 8], showing difficulties in managing social isolation, depression, and confinement [9] and portraying symptomatology that is referable at a posttraumatic\n* Paolo Meneguzzo paolo.meneguzzo@unipd.it\nAlessandra Sala alessandra.sala@aulss8.veneto.it\nLaura Merlino laura.merlino@studenti.unipd.it\nEnrico Ceccato enrico.ceccato@aulss8.veneto.it\nPaolo Santonastaso paolo.santonastaso@unipd.it\n1 Department of\u00a0Neuroscience, University of\u00a0Padova, via Giustiniani 2, 35128\u00a0Padua, Italy\n2 Vicenza Eating Disorders Center, Mental Health Department, Azienda ULSS8 \u201cBerica\u201d, Vicenza, Italy\n3 Padova Neuroscience Center, University of\u00a0Padova, Padua, Italy\n1 3\nframework [5]. Longitudinal studies have shown the specific role of COVID-19 in regards to EDs, with patients reporting greater anxiety levels and increased concerns about the impact of the pandemic [10]. Fortunately, protective factors have also been identified, such as family relationships, social support, and therapeutic engagement [11]. Healthcare systems have been overwhelmed by the pandemic\u2019s effects on staff members and the increased support required by patients, showing the psychological burden of the exacerbation of ED symptomatology caused by the loss of in-person support, the feeling of being undeserving of help, and the limitations of online treatment options [12]. Moreover, evaluation of the changes in the effectiveness of treatment before and during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates a reduction in the improvement in patients, calling for evaluations on the possible necessity of specific strategies and procedures to help them [13]. Overall, this evidence showed the possible role of environmental adversity in developing psychological distress, understood as isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise [14, 15]. However, the data are still preliminary, and new insights are needed from population with specific ED vulnerabilities, to better understand the negative effects that have been recorded [16].\nPersonal history of maltreatment or traumatic events have been suggested as specific causes for the development and maintenance of EDs [17]. Furthermore, interactions between internal and external elements can modify patients\u2019 physiological responses to subsequent stressful events [18, 19]. Even if no gender differences have been reported in the effects of traumatic events in EDs patients, the literature has shown that women and men have managed the events that have characterized the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014such as confinements\u2014differently due to the internalization of different psychological ideals [20]. The healthy sisters of patients with EDs shared their sisters\u2019 difficulties in terms of emotional regulation, social threats, and executive functions [21, 22]; these elements could increase their hardships in dealing with the changes caused by the pandemic. Moreover, considering that ED patients and their relatives share psychological traits such as perfectionism, anxiety, and specific psychopathology [23], an evaluation of the differences between these particular populations could help determine the specific effects of shared traumatic events.\nDespite the elevated psychological risk profiles of ED patients\u2019 sisters, and the evidence of an increase of psychological distress in parents during the pandemic [16], to our knowledge, no study has considered this specific population in the evaluation of the effects of COVID-19; instead, they have focused solely on parents or caregivers [16, 24]. However, literature has shown that comparing ED patients and their sisters enable the evaluation of\u00a0intra- and interpersonal moderating factors for the impacts of EDs [23]. Therefore,\nthis study aims to evaluate the presence of specific posttraumatic psychological differences due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of patients with EDs, their healthy sisters, as well as a group of unrelated community women, searching for specific features that may explain the different negative effects of the pandemic in each subgroup. Our hypothesis is that specific posttraumatic differences and related psychological elements can be elicited between patients, their sisters, and community peers, contributes to the literature of the field and shows possible specific vulnerabilities that might be considered in future studies. These aspects may help the improvement of treatment approaches and the ED healthcare organizations, which have been overwhelmed by the worsening of patients\u2019 symptoms during the pandemic."

Three different samples\u2014patients with ED, healthy sisters (HS) of enrolled patients, and community women (CW)\u2014were recruited between January 2021 and June 2021, one year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria for all participants were as follows: they identify as women; be between 14 and 40\u00a0years old, which is the usual range of ages of patients treated at the ED unit; and have no history of psychotic symptoms or severe medical conditions. Patients with EDs fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria for EDs as evaluated in person by a trained psychiatrist. The HS and CW were screened for the exclusion criteria of a personal history of any ED or psychiatric condition with specific items in the online survey; CW were also excluded if they had first-degree relatives with ED diagnoses. Patients were recruited via direct invitations; if present, their sisters were also contacted the same way, while CW were recruited via public announcements on social media.\nDifferent strategies characterized the recruitment process. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all patients treated at the day hospital or the outpatient services were directly enrolled for the study. If present, a trained researcher contacted the closest sister for each patient, screening the inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtaining the consent to participate. For the CW group, participants were enrolled\n1 3\nvia a public post on local Facebook pages about the search for volunteer participants for a study on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population; the post was shared on different Facebook pages about community activities.

All participants were specifically instructed to focus on pandemic-related experiences when filling the survey.\nFor the healthy sisters and CW participants, specific questions were included in the survey to evaluate their psychological/psychiatric history, with a yes/no answer required: \u201cAre you currently being treated for an eating disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa)?\u201d; \u201cHave you ever been treated for an eating disorder?\u201d; \u201cAre you currently being treated by a psychologist or psychiatrist for a specific your condition (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.)?\u201d; and \u201cHave you ever been treated for a psychological problem (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.) in the past?\u201d.\nThe EDE-Q is a well-known validated 28-item self-report questionnaire specifically structured to evaluate eating symptomatology and attitudes [25, 26]. The measure contains four subscales, and higher total scores reflect greater eating-related pathology. Specific items allow the researcher to evaluate the frequency of particular clinical features\u2014 binge-eating episodes, self-induced vomiting, laxative and diuretics misuses, use of exercise as compensation\u2014per month. In the current investigation, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.98 for the global score, 0.88 for the restraint subscale, 0.87 for the eating concern subscale, 0.94 for the shape concern subscale, 0.88 for the weight concern subscale.\nThe SCL-58 is a well-known self-report questionnaire derived from SCL-90R, and it is widely used to evaluate general psychiatric symptoms and psychological distress [27\u201329]. It provides a total score and five subscales: somatization, obsessive\u2013compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and anxiety. Each item is rated on a five-point scale, and higher total scores reflect greater symptomatology. In the current investigation, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.94 for the global severity index, 0.90 for the somatization subscale, 0.88 for the obsessive\u2013compulsive subscale, 0.83 for the interpersonal sensitivity subscale, 0.88 for the depression subscale, and 0.85 for the anxiety subscale.\nThe IES-R is a 22-item self-report questionnaire that assesses subjective distress caused by specific events such as the COVID-19 pandemic [30, 31]. It is comprised of three different subscales (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) and a total score. Again, the participants were explicitly instructed to respond to the questionnaire in relation to their experiences of the pandemic. The clinical relevance cut-off for the impact of an event is 24. A score of 33 or above represents a possible diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder [32]. In the current investigation, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.97 for the total score, 0.81 for the avoidance subscale, 0.90 for the intrusion subscale, and 0.84 for the hyperarousal subscale."

In addition, a Bonferroni approach was used in the post-hoc analysis. Lockdown conditions were classified according to the Italian legislation: yellow meant that people were not allowed to leave their homes from 10\u00a0pm to 5\u00a0am; orange meant that people were allowed to leave their towns only for work, basic needs, or health-related reasons; and red meant that people could not leave their towns except for health or work-related reasons. The distribution of lockdown conditions was evaluated using a Chi-square approach. Due to their equal distribution, comparison between underweight and normal weight patients were performed with a t test analysis. Instead, considering the different sample sizes, the patients were compared with the Mann\u2013Whitney test to find differences linked to the various treatments at the evaluation. Furthermore, correlation between clinical features (binge-eating episodes, self-induced vomiting, laxative and diuretics misuses, EDE-Q subscales) and IES-R subscales were evaluated with Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis. For the clinical features were used the specific items in the EDE-Q questionnaires. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were applied to evaluate the associations between general psychopathology and EDE-Q global scores for posttraumatic symptoms linked to COVID-19. The IES-R total score was used as the dependent variable, while the SCL-58 subscales (Step 1) and the EDE-Q total score (Step 2) were used as independent variables. The effect size was evaluated with Cramer\u2019s V for the chi-square and partial \u03b72 for the ANOVA.

The results of the psychopathological self-report evaluations are reported in Table\u00a01. Differences were found between ED patients, HS, and CW, as the patients showed higher scores than the other groups in both general and specific psychopathology and their quantifications of the effects of the pandemic in their lives. See Table\u00a01 for further details.\nUsing hierarchal multiple linear regression analyses, we evaluated the relationship between psychological features and the posttraumatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            "text": "The present study explored the psychological effects of a year of exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with EDs and their HS by comparing them to a group of CW. Our main hypothesis was the presence of different posttraumatic responses in individuals with EDs, their HS, and a sample of CW. Our data showed that participants with EDs reported higher scores in all the subscales, indicating the presence of more specific posttraumatic responses to distressing experiences like the COVID-19 pandemic [20], and corroborating the evidence of the relationships between traumatic events and general and ED psychopathology [33].\nAs expected, no differences emerged between the HS and CW groups regarding specific and general symptomatology. However, HS reported higher scores than CW for avoidance with no differences between HS and ED patients. Interestingly, avoidance has been reported to be a core construct in posttraumatic symptomatology in EDs, implicating its role in the activation of ED and trauma-related symptomatology [34]. While the existing literature has already suggested the presence of posttraumatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with EDs [35], our data provide a specific profile for their healthy sisters that could encourage further study about the effects of environmental adversities in subjects with EDs and its possible effects on genotype [36]. This interaction might not only be characterized by the presence of different psychological and temperamental traits [23, 36] but also by the presence of neurobiological differences that might need to be evaluated [37]. Our data show that traumatic events might produce similar posttraumatic symptomatology in the healthy sisters of patients with EDs, even if they do not reach a clinically significant level of posttraumatic disorder. Biological and environmental interactions are still an open field of research in EDs, but a growing body of data highlights the role of these factors in\n1 3\nthe differences in life trajectories of sisters with and without EDs [38]. Indeed, several models have been proposed to explain the connections between traumatic or adverse events and EDs [39], and a wealth of data corroborates the\npresence of a blunted stress response in distressed patients with EDs [37, 40]. From this perspective, COVID-19 may be considered a psycho-social stressor with possible cognitive and emotional effects in ED patients [30, 41]. Moreover,"

Finally, only ED patients showed an association between posttraumatic symptoms and obsessive-compulsiveness; however, this is in line with previous literature about the pandemic\u2019s role in exacerbating general and ED symptomatology in ED patients [6].\nLooking at clinical features, several connections have been found between posttraumatic symptoms and binge or compensatory behaviors in patients with ED. These correlations are consistent with the existing literature about trauma in EDs, the hypothesis being that they might be a mental escape from negative affects [49]. Interestingly, these data have been reported by different population studies as effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, even in the general population [50, 51]. Moreover, while these elements have already been classified as fundamental by trauma-informed treatments, there is still work to be done in their integration into evidence-based treatments [52]. These data corroborate the implementation of specific interventions focused on the development of effective and adaptive\nstrategies to cope with life\u2019s adversities and engaging with valued activities to help those struggling with EDs to survive in years to come."
