    "abstractText": "Black silicon (bSi) is a highly absorptive material in the UV-vis and NIR spectral range. Photon trapping ability makes noble metal plated bSi attractive for fabrication of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates. By using a cost-effective room temperature reactive ion etching method, we designed and fabricated the bSi surface profile, which provides the maximum Raman signal enhancement under NIR excitation when a nanometrically-thin gold layer is deposited. The proposed bSi substrates are reliable, uniform, low cost and effective for SERS-based detection of analytes, making these materials essential for medicine, forensics and environmental monitoring. Numerical simulation revealed that painting bSi with a defected gold layer resulted in an increase in the plasmonic hot spots, and a substantial increase in the absorption cross-section in the NIR range.",

            "text": "Silicon is the most widely used electronics and photonics semiconducting material. Although a polished silicon possesses a high reflectivity in the ultraviolet (UV) [1], visible (vis) and near infrared (NIR) range [2], the micro-structuring of silicon may make it remarkably absorptive [3\u20135]. As a result, the micro-structured silicon surface acquires a deep black color, and it is often referred to as \u201cblack silicon\u201d (bSi). Having been discovered accidentally, bSi was initially considered an unwanted sideproduct [6]; however, nowadays it is undergoing a rebirth because of new opportunities it opens in a number of applications. The surface of bSi may comprise of various shapes and geometries, including needles, pyramids, cones, pillars, holes, columns, etc., which enhance absorption and suppress light scattering [7] via effective light trapping [8]. The suppression of specular reflectance and enhancement of absorbance can be described in terms of the structural defects in the Si lattice or impurities (specifically sulfur) which appear during surface micro-structuring [7]. These defects and impurities create IR absorbing states in the band gap and are also responsible for the trapping of photoexcited carriers (for flat silicon, the band gap is 1.07 eV) [9]. The absorbance caused by these defects is enhanced by multiple reflections between the microstructures of bSi, which, in turn, suppresses specular reflection and increases absorbance. The significant increase in absorbance in UV-vis and NIR spectral ranges by bSi, compared to bulk silicon, spans the applications of bSi to many areas, including solar cells [10,11], photo-electrocatalysis [12,13], visible light and NIR sensors [9,14]. Moreover, there is also a trend to replace indium gallium arsenide and germanium in commercial NIR photodetectors [15] with bSi because it is cost-effective and enables integration of the photodetectors into a silicon platform.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1948. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16051948 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1948 2 of 13\nThe high absorptive properties of bSi in a wide spectral range are also beneficial for nanoplasmonic applications, including surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [16], which employs the enhancement of the light field in the vicinity of the metal surface, where the eigenfrequency of the electron ensemble match the light frequency. If the molecules of the analyte are situated in the vicinity of the interface between the metal plasmonic particle and the environment, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results in an increase in the Raman scattering cross-section by several orders of magnitude, allowing one to detect trace amounts of molecules adsorbed onto the interface [17,18]. When using bSi as a supporting material for the formation of plasmonic nanostructures, significant UV-vis\u2013 NIR absorption and the phenomenon of light-trapping by the micro- and nano-structured surface of bSi may drastically increase the local electromagnetic field enhancement on the metal\u2013environment interface. This, in its turn, will cause the increase in the Raman signal of the adsorbed molecules of the analyte. The SERS approach is a reliable method for detecting low concentrations of molecules [19], investigating molecule\u2013molecule [20] or molecule\u2013surface [21] interactions, investigating living cells functions [22] and detecting pesticides [23] and poisons [24], which obviously extends its applications from fundamental science to practice, including biomedicine, forensics, environment, security, etc. However, obtaining very specific information from analytes in the form of a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 vibrational spectra, SERS exhibits some drawbacks, which significantly reduce its applications in real life. Namely, SERS substrate fabrication always presents a trade-off between stability, cost, efficiency, reliability, uniformity, density of hot-spots and scalability. Commonly used approaches for SERS substrate fabrication are based either on colloidal solutions of noble metal nanoparticles or nanostructured surfaces of noble metal slabs and films. The former usually give significant enhancement of Raman intensity; however, they are non-stable [25], storage condition-dependent [26], inconvenient in routine use [27], require immobilization on the flat surface for measuring [28], poorly reproducible and nonuniform [27,28]. The latter allows one to control the density of hot spots and to be fabricated in large areas, but they are expensive and give rather limited signal enhancement. Pronounced surface micro-structuring of bSi in combination with exceptional absorbance may serve as a regular, stable and highly uniform support for plasmonic nanostructures, ensuring a strong Raman signal enhancement. However, strong dependence of SPR on the geometry of plasmonic structures [29\u201331] and their three-dimensional organization implies bSi profile control. Nano- and micro-structured bSi can be fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching, femtosecond laser assisted fabrication [8,32], laser chemical etching [7], wet chemical etching and reactive ion etching (RIE) [33]. The latter is the most suitable option when aiming for uniform surface structure coverage over large areas. The RIE system uses a plasma source consisting of highly reactive ion species, and when they bombard the sample, a chemical reaction takes place that selectively erodes away the sample surface [34]. In the present study, we fabricate bSi by using room temperature (RT) Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) RIE in such a way that the created surface profile supports a gold plasmonic layer of a thickness as low as almost ten nanometers with distributed cracks that still provides satisfactory Raman signal enhancement. Fabrication by RT ICP-RIE, instead of cryogenic ICP-RIE, and an extremely reduced defected gold layer allowed for a significant reduction in the cost of obtaining the bSi-based substrates. We developed the \u2018recipe\u2019 for fabrication of bSi substrates by supporting SERS signal enhancement at the NIR (785 nm) excitation, which meets biomedical application requirements and does not lead to overheating and thermal damage of the analyte that may occur at the visrange excitation [35\u201337]. Moreover, uniformity of vertically aligned hot spots on bSi microstructures and the opportunity to control their spatial distribution over large areas open the way towards the detection of extremely low amounts of molecules, though the integration of the signal obtained from the whole substrate area has uniform signal enhancement. We show that bSi based SERS substrates provide a breakthrough in the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1948 3 of 13\ntrade-off between cost and efficiency, making this an important step towards a simple, effective, low-cost and reliable sensing technique."

To ensure that the surface impurities of the substrate did not affect the fabrication process, the wafers were pre-cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath at 60 W/20 \u25e6C for 10 min and 5 min, respectively. To further ensure that there were no left-over dirt particles, the wafers were oxygen plasma treated for 2 min at 20 sccm flow rate and at a radio frequency (RF) power of 150 W, using Plasma-Etch (PE-50, Plasma Etch Inc.; Carson City, NV, USA). To obtain bSi with different surface profiles suitable for SERS and to optimize the procedure of bSi fabrication and gold coating, the Bosch etching process was used [38,39]. This cost efficient and relatively fast method allows one to obtain uniformly distributed high aspect ratio relief features. Through the cyclic Bosch process, we can obtain self-masked black silicon structures within a single RIE system under controlled environmental conditions. The process consists of the following two steps: (i) formation of plasma-polymerized fluorocarbon islands from C4F8 gas [40] serving as a mask, and (ii) etching using SF6/O2 gas combination. For the deposition stage, ICP is employed in addition to RIE. This step allows producing high density plasma with low ion bombardment energy at lower pressures needed for micro-masking.

To ensure that the surface impurities of the substrate did not affect the fabrication process, the wafers were pre-cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath at 60 W/20 \u00b0C for 10 min and 5 min, respectively. To further ensure that there were no left-over dirt particles, the wafers were oxygen plasma treated for 2 min at 20 sccm flow rate and at a radio frequency (RF) power of 150 W, using Plasma-Etch (PE-50, Plasma Etch Inc.; Carson City, NV, USA). To obtain bSi with different surface profiles suitable for SERS and to optimize the procedure of bSi fabrication and gold coating, the Bosch etching process was used [38,39]. This cost efficient and relatively fast method allows one to obtain uniformly distributed high aspect ratio relief features. Through the cyclic Bosch process, we can obtain selfmasked black silicon structures within a single RIE system under controlled environmental conditions. The process consists of the following two steps: (i) formation of plasma-polymerized fluorocarbon islands from C4F8 gas [40] serving as a mask, and (ii) etching using SF6/O2 gas combination. For the deposition stage, ICP is employed in addition to RIE. This step allows producing high density plasma with low ion bombardment energy at lower pressures needed for micro-masking.

The bSi samples that were etched at different times and had different surface areas were covered with a layer of gold under the same conditions for which 25 nm of gold on a flat SiO2 substrate occurs. Hereinafter, bSi sputtered with Au are labeled as bSi18, bSi25 and bSi30, related to their etching times of 18, 25 and 30 min, respectively. Further, the bSi/Au substrates were treated with N2 to protect them from undesired adsorption on their surface before coating them with the analyte. Quartz slides were sputtered with gold (SiO2/Au) under the same conditions as bSi substrates, to be used for comparison. Measurements for all fabricated SiO2/Au and bSi/Au substrates were performed under the same conditions. The substrates were incubated for 4 h in a solution of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA, HSC6H4CO2H; Sigma; Saint Louis, MO, USA) of a concentration of 0.005 mol/L in ethanol to facilitate the formation of a molecular monolayer on the gold surface of these substrates, through the -SH group. After that, all the samples were washed with ethanol for 10 min so that unbounded 4-MBA molecules were removed. The samples were dried with N2 before proceeding with Raman measurements. Raman and SERS measurements of 4-MBA (bulk) and 4-MBA self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on SiO2/Au and bSi/Au, respectively, were performed by inVia (Renishaw, UK) Raman spectrometer. Two excitation lasers were used, with wavelengths of 785 nm and 514 nm, delivering 5 mW and 3 mW, respectively, on the sample surface at an exposure time of 10 s. The grating 1200 line/mm and a microscope air objective of \u00d750 magnification, NA 0.75 were utilized. The intensity was recorded as counts per second, and simple baseline correction was performed for better spectral graphical representation. Spectra were collected from at least three points on the sample and then averaged. To evaluate structural uniformity of the substrates, SERS mapping was performed over an area of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m2 with 1 \u00b5m spatial resolution at 785 nm excitation wavelength, delivering 0.3 mW on the sample surface for an exposure time equal to 5 s."

Gold nanostructure parameters (thickness, shape, uniformity) are summarized in Table 3. The more developed surface of samples bSi25 and bSi30 contributed to the formation of an almost two-times thinner layer of gold, compared to sample bSi18. The gold layer is noncontinuous in all samples; however, some differences between the samples are revealed. In bSi18, the area in the pillar base proximity remains uncovered, but the gold layer is uniform and dense between the rarely distributed thin pillars. In contrast, in case of bSi25 and bSi30, the pillars and their close vicinities are covered by a somewhat-uniform gold pattern, while the interpillar areas are not gold painted (see Figure 2B,D,F). As a result, the Si band is always present in the Raman and SERS spectra, collected from the surfaces.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1948 5 of 13Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\nFigure 2.

The maximum of the absorption cross-section for Si@Au core@shell structures, with characteristic dimensions of 68\u201388 nm diameter for Si core and 21 nm thickness of the gold shell, is around 780\u2013800 nm, and thinning of the gold layer results in the red shift of the absorption cross-section of nanostructures of this type. These structures correspond to the bSi apex with a gold cap for all bSi samples in our experiments. Moreover, it was demonstrated in [45] that vertical alignment of the groups of gold nanostructures with diameters of 50 nm, which are overlapped with each other and form dumbbell-like structures, have weakly pronounced absorption cross-section maxima of around 500\u2013520 nm and intense absorption cross-section maxima in the NIR range (600\u20131000 nm). These simulations explain the high 4-MBA SERS signal of molecular monolayers on all the bSi/Au substrates under the 785 nm excitation and support insignificant but observable SERS spectra of 4-MBA molecules detected with 514 nm excitation from bSi18. As it follows from the parameters of the gold layer summarized in Table 3 and simulation results [45], only semi-spheres with a radius of 25 nm exhibit satisfactory absorption at 500\u2013520 nm, which can provide SERS signal enhancement. The decrease in the gold layer thickness, which occurred for the samples bSi25 and bSi30 due to their more developed surface and larger cone-like structures, led to no SERS signal enhancement at 514 nm excitation. However, the vertical alignment of gold nanostructures and silicon core provided bSi25 and bSi30 with efficiency in NIR (see Figure 4). The substrates were tested for the uniformity of the SERS signal enhancement. All studied bSi substrates are characterized by quite uniform SERS intensity distributions, and the standard deviations for the 1588 cm\u22121 band intensity of 4-MBA molecules were 6.1%, 5.2% and 4.3% (see Figure 5).

            "text": "Both numerical and experimental results demonstrate that sputtering with very a thin (approx. 10 nm) but cracked gold layer allows one to achieve stronger\u2014in comparison with \u2018pyramidal\u2019 bSi [45]\u2014enhancement of the Raman signal. Importantly, silicon outperforms cheaper glass materials as a plasmonic nanostructures support because the etch rate of glass is very low and is only 1/40th of the Si etch rate with fluorine radicals [51]. This makes micro-structuring of glass by ICR-RIE much more complex and time-consuming than bSi fabrication. Glasses are inhomogeneous, both chemically and structurally, and this inhomogeneity significantly complicates 3D or even 2D patterning, while the charging effects, which accompany the etching process of dielectrics, may drastically influence the reaction progress. In terms of the choice of fabrication method, RT ICP-RIE also outperforms other techniques, including MACE, which requires using gold (Au), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) catalysts [52]. In the one-step MACE process, metal on the surface emerges from the etching aqueous solutions, containing metal nitrates, while in the two-step MACE process, metals are physically deposited on the silicon surface before the chemical etching step [53]. After the etching step, a metal catalyst moves inside the Si wafer and locates itself at the bottom of silicon structures (deep in the pore), preventing formation of the 3D distribution of hot spots. However, such a 3D arrangement of the plasmonic hot spots on the bSi surface increases (in comparison with 2D distribution) the probability for the molecules of the analyte to meet a hot spot, thus significantly improving the sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate that cracks in the gold layer and gaps between the deposited gold islands provide significant enhancement of the Raman signal. To sum up, we demonstrated that bSi offers the cheapest, most efficient, and reliable SERS substrate. The cost reduction was achieved by (i) the use of RT ICP-RIE instead of more complex and expensive cryogenic ICP-RIE, and (ii) the reduction in gold layer thickness. Until very recently, all the proposed SERS substrate fabrication techniques were based on very thick noble metal layers. For instance, in [54], the Ag layer thickness was 150 nm to achieve satisfactory Raman signal. In [55], the authors used a 100 nm thick layer\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1948 11 of 13\nof gold (RT ICP-RIE), in [56], the gold layer thickness was even larger and amounted to 400 nm (cryo-ICP-RIE), and in [57], the thickness of the deposited aluminum layer was around 1000 nm (ICP-RIE, temperature not stated). However, when the noble metal layer is of hundreds of nanometers, the 3D packaging of plasmonic nanostructures does not occur. Black silicon only serves as a supporting material for 2D nanoparticle distribution, so that the substrate could be replaced by another, easy to manufacture rough material. In the bSi structures fabricated and analyzed in this study, the geometry of the bSi is used to provide efficient Raman signal enhancement in full."

            "text": "We fabricated the black Si substrate with the controllable surface profile covered in a ten nanometers thick gold layer. The SERS measurements with 4-MBA revealed that the fabricated substrates allow one to obtain satisfactory Raman signal enhancement with excellent spatial uniformity (less than 6% signal intensity variation over a 20\u00d7 20 \u00b5m2 area) at the NIR excitation. The obtained results indicate that bSi can be employed for scalable fabrication of affordable SERS substrates, which may become a stable, simple and reliable consumable material in laboratory routine, providing relatively high sensitivity at low cost. Numerical simulation was performed to calculate the absorbance of bSi/Au samples by considering the geometrical features of silicon pillars and non-perfect coverage with gold. According to modeling results, for all geometries of bSi surface relief, we observed a substantial increase in the NIR absorption cross-section of individual bSi pillars covered with the defected gold, in which cracks work as plasmonic hot spots. For more developed bSi surfaces (e.g., bSi25 and bSi30 in Table 3), even the sputtering of the structure with very thin, <15 nm, but cracked gold allows us to achieve strong Raman signal due to significant enhancement of the local field in the vicinity of the densely distributed hot spots.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and design of the experimental study, P.K. and L.G.; data acquisition, L.G., H.R. and S.S.; black silicon substrate fabrication, H.R. and S.S.; data analysis and interpretation, L.G., Y.P., H.R., I.T. and R.K.; absorption theory and simulations, A.B. and L.G.; paper drafting, L.G., H.R. and Y.P.; paper revision, editing and final version preparation, L.G., R.K., P.K. and Y.S.
