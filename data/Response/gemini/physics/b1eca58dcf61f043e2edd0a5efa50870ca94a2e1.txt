1. **Investigate the performance of ROSPAC in the presence of multiple heteronuclei.** The paper focuses on the case of a single heteronucleus (13C) coupled to a single abundant nucleus (1H). It would be interesting to see how the sequence performs when there are multiple heteronuclei and/or multiple abundant nuclei.


2. **Explore the use of ROSPAC for decoupling in non-uniform magnetic fields.** The paper assumes that the magnetic field is uniform throughout the sample. However, in many practical applications, the magnetic field is not uniform, due to factors such as sample inhomogeneity or the presence of paramagnetic impurities. It would be interesting to see how ROSPAC performs in these non-uniform magnetic fields.


3. **Develop a theoretical framework for understanding the performance of ROSPAC in the presence of relaxation.** The paper does not consider the effects of relaxation on the performance of ROSPAC. In many practical applications, relaxation can be a significant factor, especially for long experiments. It would be interesting to develop a theoretical framework that can account for the effects of relaxation.


4. **Implement ROSPAC on a variety of NMR spectrometers.** The paper presents results from a single NMR spectrometer. It would be interesting to see how ROSPAC performs on a variety of different spectrometers, with different magnet strengths, probe designs, and software packages.


5. **Apply ROSPAC to a variety of different samples.** The paper presents results from a single sample (13C2â€“15N-glycine ethyl ester). It would be interesting to see how ROSPAC performs on a variety of different samples, with different chemical structures, molecular weights, and physical properties.
