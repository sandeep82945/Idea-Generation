            "text": "From May 1, 2011, to May 30, 2021, 43 patients received radiotherapy for synchronous oligometastatic prostate cancer (defined as 5 metastatic sites). Demographic and oncological characteristics, treatment, adverse events (AEs), and bPFS were retrospectively assessed under approved University of Nebraska Medica Center Institutional Review Board protocol, and a waiver of consent was granted because the study used deidentified data. Adverse events were recorded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 1 to 5. All patients received definitive doses of radiotherapy to the prostate and metastatic sites with stereotactic body radiotherapy, conventional fractionation, and/or integration of simultaneous integrated boosts in a single treatment course. All patients had metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer and received a finite course of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients treated before 2017 received continuous ADT; those treated from 2018 to 2021 received novel hormonal therapies as standard of care. Patients were subcategorized into pelvic lymph node metastases only (N1-only) or para-aortic nodal and/or bone metastases (M1) groups.\nThe primary outcome was bPFS, defined as any prostate-specific antigen level increase of 2 ng/mL or greater over nadir and assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox analyses. Patients were censored at the date of last follow-up. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 25 (IBM Corp)."

Grade 3 and 4 CTCAEs were reported in 1 patient (2.3%) per group; no grade 5 CTCAEs were reported.\nOf 43 patients, 10 (23.3%) had M1 disease, and 33 (76.7%) had N1-only disease. Of those with M1 disease, 2 patients (20.0%) had M1a (metastases to lymph nodes away from groin area) and 8 (80.0%) had M1b (bone metastases).

While previous studies either treated only the prostate in patients with synchronous metastases or treated metachronous metastases after definitive treatment, the present results support simultaneous treatment of synchronous metastases. Although limited by its single-center, retrospective design, this study\u2019s findings promote the use of radiotherapy for synchronous metastases, with bPFS rates of approximately 80%, which is consistent with several studies of metastasis-directed therapy.2-4 Furthermore, durability of response, morbidity, and control rates did not significantly differ between N1-only and M1 groups. Overall, radiotherapy was well tolerated, with grade 3 to 5 CTCAEs reported in fewer than 5% of patients. Although testosterone recovery was undocumented, ADT use was finite, with a mean duration of 2.3 years.\nSeveral prospective studies on metastasis-directed therapy for the treatment of oligometastatic M1a prostate cancer are ongoing.6 To ascertain the best treatment approach for these patients, high-quality phase 3 clinical trials are still needed.\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: August 22, 2022.\nPublished: October 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.35345\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Huynh LM et al.
