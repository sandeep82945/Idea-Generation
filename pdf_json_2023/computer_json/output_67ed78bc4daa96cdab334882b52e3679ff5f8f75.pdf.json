    "abstractText": "Driving behaviour is a critical issue in modern transportation systems due to the increasing concerns about the safety of drivers, passengers, and road users. Machine learning models are capable of learning driving patterns from sensor data and recognizing individuals by their driving behaviours. This paper presents a novel framework for aggressive driving detection and driver classification based on driving events identified from GPS data collected with smartphones and heart rate of the driver captured with a wearable device. The proposed system for road rage and aggressive driving detection (RAD) is realized with an integral framework with components for data acquisition, event detection, driver classification, and model interpretability. The system is implemented by generating a prediction model by training machine learning classifiers with a dataset collected in a cohort to classify drivers into good, unhealthy, road rage, and always bad. The proposed system is to improve road safety and to customize insurance premiums in the best interest of policy holders and insurance companies.",

Machine learning models are capable of learning driving patterns from sensor data and recognizing individuals by their driving behaviours. This paper presents a novel framework for aggressive driving detection and driver classification based on driving events identified from GPS data collected with smartphones and heart rate of the driver captured with a wearable device. The proposed system for road rage and aggressive driving detection (RAD) is realized with an integral framework with components for data acquisition, event detection, driver classification, and model interpretability. The system is implemented by generating a prediction model by training machine learning classifiers with a dataset collected in a cohort to classify drivers into good, unhealthy, road rage, and always bad. The proposed system is to improve road safety and to customize insurance premiums in the best interest of policy holders and insurance companies."

            "text": "Driving behaviours are the main cause of road accidents and one of the main sources of insurance claims. To improve road safety and reduce the number of insurance claims, it is important to identify driving behaviours in order to adapt the insurance contract accordingly. Identifying abnormal driving behaviour is an important task for Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) companies as it can help them to assess a customer\u2019s risk and price their policies accordingly. Driving behaviours such as speeding and aggressive and careless driving are of particular interest to UBI companies as they are directly related to an individual\u2019s risk of an accident. Car driving behaviours can be measured by data such as speed, acceleration/deceleration, lane position and headway. Accident proneness refers to a\ngeneral disposition or personality trait that increases the likelihood of an individual being involved in an accident (Shinar, 2017). Differences in accident proneness are generally caused by a number of factors, such as gender, age, personality traits, driving experience, attitude towards driving, road conditions and environmental stimuli. Figure 1 illustrates the factors influencing driver behaviour.\nDriving style is defined as a habitual driving behaviour, characterizing a driver\u2019s tendencies to behave in specific ways on a regular basis (Sagberg et al., 2015). It also describes how a driver\u2019s driving style affects the safety of the individual and others on the road. The identification of such habits has become increasingly important for the development of insurance companies as it can help them to identify high-risk drivers, estimate risk and set an insurance premium accordingly.\nAbnormal driving is generally characterized by atypical or risky behaviour that is not in line with the norms for a particular group of drivers (Hu et al., 2017). There are a number of different types of abnormal driving, but the most relevant for UBI are those that are associated with an increased risk of an accident, such as speeding, aggressive driving and careless driving. Road rage is a brief, intense reaction to perceived provocation in a situation of conflict between two or more persons on the road, characterized by verbal abuse, shoving, hitting, threatening and possibly minor or major physical aggression (Shinar, 1998). Aggressive driving is characterized by hostile, impatient and risky behaviour such as speeding, tailgating, weaving in and out of traffic and running red lights.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) report on road traffic injuries reveals that around 1.3 million people die in road crashes every year (WHO, 2022). These crashes are identified as causing around 3% loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in most countries. Further, 20 to 50 million people are susceptible to injuries, resulting in disabilities and long-term health conditions. Figure 2 depicts the fatalities in road accidents over the past few years, which are increasing every year. Along with the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS), the WHO strives to reduce fatalities and help governments develop a long-term sustainable plan for safety and road traffic injury prevention, and define guidelines and principles of a comprehensive road safety approach. Technological interventions in road rage and aggressive driving behaviour are crucial for this objective.\nRecent developments such as Drivesafe (Bergasa et al., 2014), a mobile application for alerting and ranking drivers, and Advanced Vehicle Technology (AVT) have led to the development of assistive mechanisms in the detection and reduction of aggressive driving (Furlan et al., 2020; Benson et al,, 2021). AVTs include a wide range of technologies such as anti-collision systems, automatic\nemergency braking, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, lane change assistance, and adaptive cruise control systems. However, the effectiveness of AVTs in reducing aggressive driving behaviour is still unknown and there exists a possibility of it becoming a distractive technology, frustrating untrained drivers.\nTraditionally, motor insurance pricing (Kafkov\u00e1 & K\u0159iv\u00e1nkov\u00e1, 2014) is performed with Generalized Linear Models (GLM) (Nelder & Wedderburn, 1972) such as logistic regression (LR), Poisson regression, Cox proportional hazards model, etc. These models use demographic information (e.g., age, gender, marital status, etc.), driving record (e.g., number of accidents, tickets, etc.) and vehicle type as predictors of risk, called the \u2018priori information\u2019. Later, posterior information about the policyholder is obtained from historical claims data (e.g., total claims costs, number of accidents) or population data (e.g., market share, insurance penetration rate, etc.). This information is used to determine the expected cost, total loss, etc. for a given policyholder as described in the works of Gao et al. (2021) and Corradin et al. (2022).\nHowever, GLMs do not possess the flexibility to learn complex effects from multiple causes as they model only interaction between two factors. In a recent investigation, Blier-Wong et al. (2020) have projected the limitations of the usage of GLM in evaluating the risks in property and casualty insurance (P&C) covers that involve multiple behaviour causes. The authors advocate the usage of machine-learning approaches to overcome the drawbacks of GLM models.\nMachine-learning models are capable of learning non-linear functions and have shown greater success in modelling complex relationships between inputs and the targeted output. Further, they can handle unstructured data, characteristic of insurance portfolios. Therefore, algorithms that work with training reactive features using data from past claims that have been laid for other policy holders, can help to build a robust risk model. Grize et al. (2020) emphasize the significance of the usage of machine-learning approaches in the insurance vertical when modelling the analytical applications such as risk estimation, premium calculation, profitability monitoring and risk modelling.\nInspired by the pioneering and recent works advocating the usage of machine-learning approaches in the insurance business (Dietterich, 1997; Bian et al., 2018), this research explores the possible uses\nof machine-learning models in RAD, based on multiple behavioural causes for UBI-related claims. The contributions of this research are as below:\n1. This research proposes a novel framework for RAD based on the behavioural, environmental, emotional and physiological/psychological factors of an individual for UBI policy planning. 2. Conventional machine-learning models such as DT (Quinlan, 1996), RF (Breiman, 2001) and SVM (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995) are modelled as multiclass classifiers to categorize drivers into four types such as good, unhealthy, road rage and always bad.\nThe proposed framework and the models evaluated with real-time data generalize well with arbitrary data captured in a cohort in India, suggesting the feasibility of deploying such models for RAD in other geographies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a comprehensive review of driver behaviour modelling and applications of machine-learning approaches in the insurance industry. Section 3 presents the mathematical representations of the machine-learning models employed in this research. The proposed framework is described in section 4, and experimental results with illustrations, interpretations and comparative analysis are presented in section 5. The paper is concluded with directions for further research in section 6."

            "text": "This section presents an inclusive analysis of literature spanning the earliest to the most recent representative works in the context of this research. Over the past two decades, several approaches for automated driving behaviour monitoring have been proposed (Ji et al., 2004; Al-Sultan et al., 2013). With the evolution of telematics insurance models in which premiums are calculated based on the data collected from vehicle-mounted devices and risk profiles of drivers, Manage-How-You-Drive (MHYD) insurance schemes have become popular (Cie\u015blik, 2017).\nGenerally, driver patterns are monitored with GPS devices, On-Board Diagnosis (OBD) sensors and smartphone sensors. However, GPS is a passive device and thus is vulnerable to various sources of noise and interference, and GPS-based driver pattern monitoring has been limited to only specific purposes, e.g., driving route tracking and vehicle detection (Chowdhury et al., 2018). OBD sensors such as throttle, brake and steering wheel angle sensors are widely used to collect data from the vehicle (Amarasinghe et al., 2015). Compared with OBD sensors, smartphone sensors have much better data quality due to their higher signal-to-noise ratio and immunity to the power fluctuations of the vehicle (Samuel et al., 2021). As a result, a lot of research has been carried out to monitor driving patterns using smartphone sensors. Driver behaviour modelling (AbuAli & Abou-zeid, 2016; Chen et al., 2019) has been a long-standing area of research with many studies proposed in the past decade towards understanding and detecting driver behaviour anomalies to improve road safety. Several studies have been carried out to identify the features of aggressive driving and road rage incidents and evaluate their effects on insurance pricing (Peng et al., 2015; Gvozdenovi\u0107 and Uzelac 2018; Arumugam and Bhargavi 2019; Naik and Sikka 2021). Further, the outbreak of COVID-19 has considerably affected the road traffic statistics. Insurance companies are facing challenges in risk assessment, policy pricing, personalized claims, etc. due to the fluctuation in accident statistics during COVID-19. A few studies on the impact of COVID-19 on the insurance industry call for adaptation of digital technologies, new data-driven models, telematics and other technologies to achieve a balance between customer experience and business continuity (Katrakazas et al., 2020; Babuna et al., 2020; Volosovych et al., 2021).\nThe Driving Behaviour Detection and iDentification system (D3) (Yu et al., 2016) identifies six kinds of abnormal driving behaviours such as fast U-turn, sideslipping, sudden braking, weaving,\nswerving and turning with a wide radius. SafeDrive (Zhang et al., 2017) is a cloud-based driver anomaly detection system based on unsupervised learning, implemented in the Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) platform. A driving model for quantification of driving style proposed by Shi et al. (2015) is personalized to a driver based on the vehicle and the road conditions.\nA model for driving behaviour visualization proposed by Liu et al. (2017) is based on the hypothesis that a few essential features generate multivariate data to model driving behaviours. An approach for driving event detection and driver profiling detects lateral and longitudinal driving manoeuvres with Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and jerk energy technique respectively (Daptardar et al., 2015). A multi-type data-based framework to access the driving risk level for UBI proposed by Yin and Chen (2018) employs a set of kernels to capture attributes. A predictive (Arun Kumar & Yellampalli, 2018) model for auto insurance based on binary LR, called black box, uses GPS data.\nSix classification models are proposed by Brahim et al. (2022) for driver behaviour classification into four categories: intermediate, aggressive, dangerous and normal. A framework for driver behaviour and driving pattern modelling based on driver, vehicle and environmental parameters also advocates the application of various ML approaches (Malik & Nandal, 2021). Two most recent works on the application of predictive analytics in the insurance sector show that customer satisfaction, reduction of operation costs and detection of fraudulent claims can be considerably improved with ML models (Sharma et al., 2022; Prajapati, 2022).\nA detailed review of the above shows that UBI is the emerging model of personal insurance and will replace the traditional pooling-based models in the near future. It is understood that complexity in risk-based premium computation can be reduced with usage information. Risk assessment with ML approaches for modelling driver behaviours, learning driving patterns and predicting risk classification is key to developing UBI models. Few works have shown that models based on multiple attributes outperform models trained with a single attribute. This review identifies the need for robust models for risk assessment and risk classification based on multiple attributes, and this research is aligned with this requirement."

LR is a commonly used tool in many disciplines such as economics, biology, epidemiology and medical research. However, the linearity assumption of LR between independent and dependent variables is often not met in many real-world applications, which can lead to inaccurate results. Particularly, in modelling driving behaviours, it is important to account for the nonlinearity of various factors. Compared to LR, machine-learning models such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) can better model nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables.\nThe proposed RAD framework is implemented with a component for driver rage detection using a machine-learning model to classify driving behaviours. Three different baseline models described in the following subsections are trained with driving data to classify driving behaviours."

The DT algorithm constructs a tree-like structure that represents a decision problem. At the root of the tree is a set of test instances. The DT algorithm then recursively partitions the test instances into subsets according to a test criterion. Each node in the tree is a partition of the test instances and is associated with a label that is the result of applying the test\ncriterion to the instances in that partition.

It computes a series of tree classifiers called DTs, each consisting of a set of rules for classification. The algorithm works by generating a large number of classifiers, each constructed using a different set of features and a different sample of training data. The randomness in the algorithm consists in the fact that each classifier is constructed using a different set of features. The mathematical description of the RF classifier is given as below.\nIt follows a nonparametric regression framework in which each input vector X is first mapped to a feature space, then to a decision space via a feature mapping function f X f X: \u2192 ( ) , then to a response space via a response mapping function g f X g f X: ( ) \u2192 ( )( ) and finally the response vector Y is obtained by applying a response function h g f X h g f X: ( )( )\u2192 ( )( )( ) .\nFor a given training sample D X Y X Y n n = ( ) \u2026 ( ){ }1 1, , , , , a set of classification trees T Tn1, ,\u00bc are constructed as follows. Each tree T\ni is a binary tree, where each internal node is labelled by a feature\nof the input vector X i and each leaf node is labelled by a class label Y i . A training sample is first mapped to the input space using f , then to the decision space using g , and finally to the response space using h . Finally, for each tree T\ni , the response Y is predicted as a majority vote over all the leaf\nnodes. For classification problems, the response is set to the class with the largest number of votes, and for regression problems, the predicted response is the average response over all the trees.\nSupport Vector Machine A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It is a type of kernel machine-learning algorithm that uses a kernel function to calculate the distance between two points in a feature space. SVMs are popular for text classification and image recognition tasks. The SVM algorithm works by finding a hyperplane that separates two classes of data as efficiently as possible. The hyperplane is the plane that maximizes the distance between the two classes of data. Points that lie on the hyperplane are classified as belonging to one of the classes, and points that lie outside the hyperplane are classified as belonging to the other class.\nThe binary SVM classifier constructs a hyperplane to separate two classes labelled y = \u2212 +( )1 1, from each other. An SVM has a decision function as in equation (2) where, K x x\ni ,( ) is a kernel\nfunction for x y i n i i , , , ,= \u20261 is a class label, a i \u00ce  and b \u00ce  are hyper-parameters, and K is a Gaussian kernel given by equation (3) where s is a kernel parameter:\nf x a y K x x b i\nn\ni i i( ) = ( )+ = \u2211 1 , (2)\nK x x x x i i ,( ) = \u2212 \u2212\n  \n   exp 1 2 2 2 s   (3)\nA Multiclass SVM (MSVM) (Weston et al., 1998) is a variant of SVM for one-vs.-one or onevs.-all multiclass classifications. The one-vs.-one MSVM uses a separate binary SVM for each pair of classes and the one-vs.-all MSVM uses a single binary SVM for each class.\nThe one-vs.-all MSVM used in this research is trained in two phases:\n1.

UBI is a risk-based insurance model that monitors driving behaviour of a driver on a particular road in real time, which helps insurers to identify potential risks, predict possible accidents in the near future and compute the premium. Unlike the conventional insurance models that classify the drivers into two or three categories based on historic driving data, static speed limits and fixed premiums, a UBI business model dynamically changes the insurance premiums for each driver, based on real-time driving behaviour.\nRecently, the outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly reduced the driving activities of millions of people. Usage-based premium computation, which is the mainstay of the UBI business model, is datadriven. UBI companies are now confronting the challenging problem of detecting abnormal driving behaviour of people from limited on-road data (i.e., the time and date of the on-road events) that are either collected manually or through the network of fixed roadside vehicle detection systems. Risk detection based on behavioural, environmental, physiological and emotional factors can help insurance companies\nto provide personalized insurance premiums and to support drivers in making better decisions. To this end, a combination of machine learning and data science techniques is required to construct such a model.\nForeseeing the growing trend of UBI business models in the future, this research proposes the RAD system to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional models. The proposed model is realized as a multiclass classifier for driver categorization with the following objectives:\n\u2022 To collect the driving data from the live driving environment with the GPS and wearable devices using smartphones. \u2022 To classify the drivers into four categories such as good, unhealthy, road rage and always bad: \u25e6 Good drivers \u2013 drivers with an overall driving score above the threshold. \u25e6 Unhealthy drivers \u2013 drivers reported as having health problems. \u25e6 Bad drivers \u2013 drivers with a poor driving score, who exhibit consistent irregularity in driving\nand who have received more warnings. \u25e6 Road rage/aggressive drivers \u2013 drivers who exhibit road rage and aggression, thus have a\nhigher potential for road accidents. \u2022 To provide alerts, suggestions or warnings to drivers when they are driving abnormally, to\nprevent road accidents.\nA classification diagram in Figure 3 illustrates the role of the proposed RAD system in insurance pricing."

The GPS data are pre-processed and the data-flow depicted in Figure 8 is followed to detect the events. Heart rate is captured from a wearable device and processed as-is. The generation of events and representation of data are presented in Figure 9 with illustrations.\n1. Hard acceleration: Hard acceleration is a driver event when more force than normal is applied to the vehicle\u2019s accelerator, causing the vehicle to cross the permissible acceleration threshold. It is defined as the difference between the final and initial speeds over a period of time as in equation (5). A positive value of this computation signifies hard acceleration:\nHard Acceleration Final Speed Initial Speed\nFinal Time In\n= \u2212( ) \u2013 itial Time ( )\n(5)\n2. Hard Braking: Hard braking is a driver event when more force than normal is applied to the vehicle\u2019s brake, causing the car to slow down more quickly than it would under normal driving conditions. It is generally considered to be a warning sign of potential aggressive driving behaviour, resulting in damages to the car and affecting the safety of the passengers. Hard braking is identified by speed changes over a time interval as in equation (6). Negative values indicate a deceleration and the absolute value is used to detect hard braking, compared with a threshold:\nHard Braking Final Speed Initial Speed\nFinal Time Initial\n= \u2212( ) \u2013 Time( )\n(6)\n3. Speeding Incidents: A vehicle speeding over the limit can result in a number of incidents such as injuries, property damage, accidents and fatalities. GPS data can be used to create the ideal vehicle speed profile and flag a vehicle as a potential speed violator. GPS systems in vehicles can\n4. Hard cornering: Hard cornering occurs when a driver accelerates or decelerates suddenly in a lane, turning a corner at high speed or drifting on the road. Lateral acceleration is an important indicator to identify harsh cornering events, expressed as in equation (7) where V and R are the velocity and the radius, respectively. Cornering events will be detected when this value exceeds 21.6 KMPH:\nLateral Acceleration V\nR = 2 * (7)\n5. Heart Rate Monitoring: Several studies have shown that heart-related events in drivers are associated with an increased risk of accidents, due to a sudden heart attack or arrhythmia, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle, and often leading to a fatal outcome (D\u2019Allegro, 2017). Further, diabetic events are also found to increase the risk of accidents, as Type 2 diabetes reduces the heart rate. The need for monitoring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been advocated in the works of Zheng et al. (2020) and Minea et al. (2021) for a better understanding of how it can be used as an early warning system for detection of high-risk driving behaviour. Hence, in the proposed system, heart rate is being monitored along with driving parameters.\nFigure 9d shows the data collected from one driver. The x-axis is the GPS data count, and the Y axis is the heart rate (beats per second). For this driver, the heartbeat ranges from 60 to 100 beats per second. This helps to identify and detect road rage and aggressive drivers.\n6. Driver Data Format: The GPS data including speed, latitude, longitude, altitude, course and timestamp are received through GPS signals and the heart rate is captured with the wearable device. From this data and the predefined threshold values, the parameter values are derived for cornering, acceleration, braking, speeding and heart-related events. These parameters for driving"

Several analyses with real-time data revealed that the drivers exhibit unique patterns with respect to these parameters in different instances.

On-Device ML is optimized for on-device performance,\nwhich minimizes memory and power consumption.

The performance metrics evaluated for four-class classification are shown in Table 8.\nFurther, the classification results are visualized with the confusion matrices, which depict the correct classifications and misclassifications under each category. The confusion matrices for the three classifier models are shown in Figure 17.\nIt is seen that best overall classification accuracy is achieved with the RF model, which exhibits a smaller number of misclassifications compared to DT and SVM. While the number of misclassifications is 3 for RF, the DT and SVM models make 5 and 9 wrong predictions, respectively. A closer observation of the results shows that a greater number of erroneous predictions are evidenced from the good to unhealthy categories, viz. 2, 3 and 6 for RF, DT and SVM classifiers. Further, it is seen that all the data samples under the unhealthy category are correctly classified by the three models. Further, road rage cases are also identified perfectly by RF and DT, and 1 misclassification is evidenced with SVM. This result shows that the models are sufficiently trained to discern the driver categories. However, the highest number of misclassifications from the good to unhealthy categories in each model signifies more FPs that must be eliminated.\nexplainable Analysis Conventional machine-learning models are seen as black box models, the predictions of which are not easily interpretable (Alwosheel et al., 2021). In order to understand how a machine-learning model works and to identify which factors influence the predictions, it is often necessary to interpret the model behaviour. Explainable analysis facilitates such interpretations by enabling the user to understand the input features that the machine-learning model uses to make the predictions. Explainable analysis is significant in the context of this research, as the insurance companies need to provide a user with an intuitive explanation of the factors that lead to driver categorization, to establish trust. Further, this analysis also helps to identify and eliminate trivial features, and debug and optimize the model. Two significant works on explainable analysis with respect to travel domain are presented by Alwosheel (2020) and Barbado and Corcho (2021).\nThe explainable analysis pipeline for RAD detection is shown in Figure 18. This analysis is performed with the DT, RF and SVM classifiers employed in this research to analyse their behaviour with respect to input features. This analysis presents insights on which of the derived parameters influence the classifiers\u2019 decisions and also helps to guide the drivers towards modifying their behaviour to minimize their risk of being classified as aggressive.\nInterpretable machine-learning models possess one or more of the following features for analysing their behaviour. In this context, the capabilities of the RAD model are illustrated with Figure 19.\n\u2022 Text explanation: Ability to generate textual explanations from the model predictions. \u2022 Visual explanation: Ability to provide visual interpretation of model behaviours for post-hoc\nanalysis. \u2022 Local explanation: Ability to segment complex solution spaces into smaller subspaces and\nprovide explanations in terms of solutions to less complex problems. \u2022 Explanations by example: Ability to extract data samples related to the result to understand\nthe whole model. \u2022 Explanations by simplification: Ability to build a whole new system posing less complexity\nfrom the trained model. \u2022 Feature relevance: Ability to clarify the inner functioning of a model by computing a relevance\nscore for its managed variables for post-hoc analysis.\nThe interpretable analysis for four driving instances is given in Table 9. The class score for each target class is given with values of the derived parameters. It is seen that driver #9 is classified always\nbad with respect to B, S and H parameters. This analysis alerts the driver to correct the braking and speeding activities and take care of their health.\nFurther, local explanations for the four classes of drivers are shown in Figure 20. The ideal values of the parameters is given for each class for a clear understanding of the driving behaviours in real time. Visualizing these parameters on the dashboard can help the driver to control the driving behaviour to avoid adverse outcomes."

Since the existing models are trained with different datasets, the RAD system cannot be compared with them based on quantitative metrics alone. For a fair comparison, a comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art systems is presented in Table 10, highlighting the merits and limitations of these systems.\nThis analysis shows that the proposed RAD system is unique among its kind for aggressive driving detection for personalized insurance computation that considers behavioural, environmental, physiological and emotional factors. The proposed RAD system has a distinct edge over other systems as it considers the various parameters that affect the decision making process, enabling insurance companies to identify high-risk drivers at an early stage to avoid accidents. The alert mechanisms incorporated into the system can further reduce risk-proneness, as the system is implemented in the cloud, raising the possibilities of real-time monitoring and preventive measures.\nFurther, unlike other systems, the proposed model does not use the raw data captured directly from sensors. The DT, RF and SVM classifiers are trained with features characterising adverse driving events, derived from raw data and heart rate, resulting in a highest classification accuracy of 98% for the RF classifier. This result is indicative of the fact that the RF classifier is able to learn the complex patterns associated with the driving behaviour data and can be effectively used for the detection of rage/aggressive driving. Basically, RF poses some advantages such as flexibility, minimized overfitting, fast learning and ability to capture the nonlinear patterns in the data compared to other machine-learning models. Further, the RF-based rage/aggressive driver detection model shows good\ngeneralization performance on unseen data due to its ability to randomly select a subset of features at each iteration during the learning process. The machine-learning models can be tuned to specifically detect the behaviour that is of interest, and this can lead to better detection performance.\nHowever, certain limitations of the proposed RAD system listed below must be addressed in future:\n1. Aggressive driving behaviour is a complex phenomenon that requires extensive behavioural, environmental, physiological and emotional factors to be considered. These factors are often dynamic and are not always consistent. Thus, the proposed model is not a complete and robust system, but can be used as a preliminary tool for proactive driver risk assessment. This drawback can be overcome by training the models with grid-wide data, considering the changes in factors and driving behaviours over time. 2. The dataset used in this paper is obtained from a single cohort in India. The accuracy of the dataset might be different in other countries and cultures. For this reason, the model developed in this paper should be validated with datasets from other sources."
