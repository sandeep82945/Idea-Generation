GSM:+234 08037476970 2\nBackground: A high-ranking scientist has recently proposed the need for direct estimation of the specificity constant rather than by calculation after a separate determination of maximum velocity and the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM). Objectives: The objectives of this study are to derive novel equations for the zero-arbitrary determination of pre-steady-state (PSS) concentration of the substrate suitable for PSS assays, direct estimation of specificity constant (SC) under a PSS scenario, saturating concentration [ST] of the substrate, and instantaneous initial rate (otherwise called the \"burst phase-like\" rate), including its corresponding [ST]0, and to quantitatively evaluate the derived equations so as to give credence to their robustness and applicability.\nMethods: The study was experimental and theoretical. It is supported by the Bernfeld method of\nenzyme assay. Result: The SC values from the two newest methods for the three different concentrations of the enzyme range between 2,197.546 and 11,101.74 L/g min in one of the methods and 2,185.649 and 13,860.014 L/g min in the other method. The sub-KM values of the SC for the three different concentrations of the enzyme range between 1304.368 and 7943 L/g min. The burst phase-like initial rate, v0, and corresponding [ST]0, respectively, range between 14.26 and 55.448 micromol./min and 0.171 and 3.752 g/L. Conclusion: The derivation of the equations for the direct calculations of SC in conditions that validate the reverse and standard quasi-steady-state approximations was a possibility; the SC values are higher at lower concentrations of the enzyme. The concept of SC is very different from catalytic efficiency. The total absence of any calculation is impossible.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232.

A significant number of such investigations concern the desire to optimize the production of precursors for biofuel from the hydrolytic action of specified enzymes. Most of the time, pre-steady-state (PSS) and steady-state (SS) assays are carried out [3- 7]. Burst phase, pre-steady-state, and steady-state are distinct from zero-order kinetics, and they are expected to kinetically contribute to the characterization of an enzyme whose application can be on the basis of an informed decision. These rate constants are important for proper modeling, either for further experimental or industrial design. The challenge lies in the choice of suitable substrate concentrations and the range of such concentrations. The waste to wealth concept is best achieved industrially upon application of a kinetic model; thus, research has focused on how best to convert cellulose to the precursors of biofuels [8-11] and possibly solvents for other applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. The control of diabetes has prompted recent studies on the digestibility of recalcitrant starch and the inhibition mechanism of alphaamylase [12-15 ].\nWhatever is the aim of the user of enzymes, be it the saccharification and liquefaction as\nsteps toward the production of biofuels, polar solvents, and biomass conversion before further degradation to simpler biomolecules such as trio-maltose, short oligosaccharides etc, and the control of simple sugar consumption in prandial scenario, there is a need to control the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. There has been research into how best to understand the mechanisms that lead to catalytic efficiency of enzymes which is studied as reported in the literature [16-20]. The catalytic efficiency of an enzyme can be defined as its capacity to be functional at a near-\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232.

On the other hand, there is an issue of enzyme specificity, which defines the capacity of the enzyme to selectively identify or exhibit preference for and binds consistently with the same substrate even in the presence of other substances, the substrate analogues, for instance. Here comes the issue of proficiency, which is defined in several ways, viz. A not-so-clear definition is the impression that the enzyme\u2019s proficiency ((kcat/KM)/kuncat; where kcat and kuncat are the catalytic first order rate constant and equivalent rate constant without a catalyst respectively) \"is the equilibrium constant for the conversion of the transition state (TS) of the uncatalyzed reaction in water and perhaps the enzyme-catalyzed reaction in water into the TSE complex [19]; the catalytic efficiency (a second-order rate constant = kcat/KM) divided by the first-order rate constant for the uncatalyzed reaction in water [17]. While catalytic proficiency stands out clearly in terms of its definition and meaning, catalytic efficiency appears to be used interchangeably with the specificity constant (SC) [18.]. It is even suggested that kcat/KM quantifies enzyme specificity, efficiency, and proficiency [20], despite the exclusive definition of catalytic proficiency by other high-calibre scientists [17, 19].\nIt is important to realize that catalytic efficiency may have applications, but there have\nalso been recent misgivings regarding the adequacy of using the ratio Vmax/KM (Vmax is the maximum rate of catalysis when the enzyme is saturated with substrate) as a measure of enzyme performance, particularly in the context of the use of the enzyme as an industrial catalyst. Its use can result in a misinterpretation of the performance index and can be problematic if used to select among different variants for industrial applications [21]. It needs to be noted that Vmax/KM must not be allowed to be used as it is, even if the biochemist understands that a variable is\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232. GSM:+234 08037476970 7\nmissing in the simple expression given to SC: Vmax/KM should be consistently stated as kcat/KM (or Vmax/KM[ET], where [ET] is the molar concentration of the enzyme).\nThe reciprocal of Vmax/KM is obtained from the double reciprocal plot and yet may not\naddress the concern of eminent scientist [20], who prefers direct information about kcat/KM without any form of calculation. Thus, the aim of this study is to find out whether or not a direct estimate of the specificity constant is a possibility or a fluke and, ultimately, to present presteady-state substrate concentrations and enabling mathematical equations. Without being prejudgmental, no one should be in doubt about the possibility of deriving a new or novel equation for the direct estimation of SC as the main objective of this study; the other objectives are to derive an equation for the zero-arbitrary determination of PSS concentration of substrate suitable for PSS assays, derive equations for SC under a PSS scenario, and an instantaneous initial rate (otherwise called the \"burst phase-like\" rate), including its corresponding [ST]0, and to quantitatively evaluate the derived equations so as to give credence to their robustness and applicability."

The study has also given a simple equation for the calculation of what seems to be an instantaneous (or rather, a \"burst phase-like\") initial rate and its corresponding concentration of the substrate.

The other equation is based on a new principle. These notwithstanding, the recent direct linear method for estimating kinetic parameters are quite fortunate. In this case, no calculation is done; just the median of various points of intersection gives the direct estimate of Vmax and KM. The direct linear plot [23] and the reciprocal variants [24] are graphical means of determining the kinetic parameters. The former requires separate determination of the parameters followed by calculation, whereas the reciprocal variant gives a direct value for the SC after taking the reciprocal of the KM to Vmax ratio, if initial rates were accurately generated. Thus, the reciprocal variant of the direct linear plot seems to be the first graphical approach for the determination SC. In this study, a mathematical approach and a new graphical method are to be investigated."

This implies that each of the different concentrations of the enzyme up to 4 to 6 is assayed per the different concentrations of the substrate up to 6 to 10 or more. The values of kint are different for different values of [ET]. Hence, given the following:\n[ST]1 < [ST]2 < [ST]3< [ST]4 < [ST]5 < [ST]6< [ST]7 \u2026 [ST]8 < [ST]9 < [ST]10<[ST]n (2)\nThe different kint values for different values of [ST] are:\n\ud835\udc58int 1<\ud835\udc58int 2<\ud835\udc58int 3<\ud835\udc58int 4<\ud835\udc58int 5<\ud835\udc58int 6<\ud835\udc58int 7\u2026\ud835\udc58int 8<\ud835\udc58int 9<\ud835\udc58int 10<\ud835\udc58int \ud835\udc5b (3)\nThe values in Eqs (2) and (3) can be subjected to the reciprocal variant of the direct linear\nplot such that the median can give exactly kcat/KM. This could be very tedious and less accurate if more than six different [ST] values are used. Again, assaying for different concentrations of E (up to 4 or more) can also be tedious and take a lot of time. If the values of 1/kint are plotted versus different values of 1/[ST], the 1/slope gives the SC value.

(5b), but the process leading to it can be tedious. Furthermore, high precision is demanded, which makes the use of automated devices inevitable. It is also very necessary to ensure that the substrate concentration regime is such that the lowest concentration of the substrate is \u226b the highest concentration of the enzyme, strictly on a mole-mole basis. A very short duration of the assay is desirable."

But before then, a better\nimpression regarding SC is as follows: The impression about SC is that it provides a lower limit for the second-order rate constant for substrate binding, while kcat provides a lower limit for each first-order rate constant following substrate binding. The notion of lower limit is best interpreted in terms of the reciprocal of kcat, which gives the duration of the catalytic cycle; this, as observed in the literature [26, 27], should be equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the first-order rate constants of the individual reaction steps. This means that the individual first-order rate constant is > than the overall catalytic rate constant, referred to as the lower limit [20].\nAlthough, the substrate concentration range may be chosen for the assay of the enzyme,\nthere is a concentration that may be < the lowest substrate concentration of the given range. Such concentration is given as:\n[ST]0 = b0KM (7)\nwhere bo (this is < 1) is a dimensionless constant for a given substrate concentration range for a given concentration of E under a defined condition of assay, temperature, pH, etc. The value of [ST]0 is a definite substrate concentration, which may be less than KM, and which, with other concentrations less than [ST]0, gives initial rates that are directly proportional to the substrate concentrations.

(15); such a premise is the assumption that there does not seem to have been an equation for the direct determination of the specificity constant despite the well-known double reciprocal transformation of the Michaelian equation by Lineweaver and Burk (LB) [28]. The challenge in the use of LB is the need to generate accurate initial rates. The plot of the reciprocal of initial rates versus the reciprocal of the substrate concentration implied in the equation [20], 1/v = (1/ksp[ST]) + 1/kcat, needs to make room for the following equation.\n1\n\ud835\udc58int =\n\ud835\udc3eM\n\ud835\udc58cat[\ud835\udc46T] +\n1\n\ud835\udc58cat (19)\nwhere kint is already defined in Eq. (1b). Note that Eq. (4) is in principle similar to Eq. (19); the difference is that Eq. (4) is derived from multiple assays of different concentration of the enzyme unlike Eq. (19) which applies to a single concentration of the enzyme; both are only double reciprocal equations.\nThe PSS kinetic modeling requires an informed choice of a suitable substrate\nconcentration range in addition to a suitable duration of the assay; there is a need to avoid arbitrariness in the choice of different [ST]. After choosing a suitable [ST] to [ET] ratio that should meet the requirement for a standard quasi-steady-state approximation (sQSSA), at the most basic level (this demands that the molar mass of the substrate, starch, large molecular weight protein, etc. must be known), the challenge, however, is that there seems to be no definite value for the molar mass (or molecular weights) of a complete starch molecule as opposed to either amylose or amylopectin. A nano-scale concentration of the enzyme with coefficients that are < 5 is preferable (for example, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5 nmol./L) if the molar mass of the substrate is not known with certainty.

This is not ad infinitum; the best values are best defined by values < [ST]0. Any speculation that v0/[ST] may be \u2248 SC (slightly < Vmax/KM) may not be out of place.\nA very important lesson that should be learned from Eq.

The raison d\u2019 \u00eatre is that such an expression is reserved for a PSS and possibly a burst phase scenario where KM cannot be validly defined as the substrate concentration at half the maximal velocity or rate of catalysis. Instead, without insinuating any sense of novelty, the right equation should be v = [ST]PSS/Kd, where [ST]PSS, Kd, and (\ud835\udc49max PSS) are the PSS concentration of the substrate, the enzyme-substrate (ES) dissociation constant, and the PSS maximum velocity, which is \u226a zero-order maximum velocity. Similar issues have already been elucidated in the literature [22, 26]. Recall, too, that KM is = K + Kd, where K is the Van Slyke and Cullen constants [29].

(26a); this is just about making v0 subject\nof the formula as follows:\n\ud835\udc630 = \ud835\udc46\u03c7\ud835\udc49max[\ud835\udc46T]0 \ud835\udc3eM\u2044 (27a)\nEquations (26 and 27a) are not restricted to [ST]0 and v0, rather every other values of [ST] that are \u226a KM and either < [ST]0 or > [ST]0. However, dvn/d[ST]n must always be = v0/[ST]0. How one can separately establish the value of v0/[ST]0 is a major research question. Therefore, with general expression (Eq. (27b)) given below one can plot vn values versus [ST]n to give a linear curve whose slope (SPSS\u03c7) should be = \ud835\udc46\u03c7\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc3eM\u2044 . The slope SPSS\u03c7 is simply v0/[ST]0. The equation is:\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc46\u03c7\ud835\udc49max[\ud835\udc46T]\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3eM\u2044 (27b)\nThe presence of a pre-determined slope (\ud835\udc46\u03c7) allows the accurate estimation of Vmax/KM from:\n\ud835\udc49max \ud835\udc3eM\u2044 = \ud835\udc46PSS\u03c7 \ud835\udc46\u03c7\u2044 (28)\nThus, SC can be given as:\nSC = \ud835\udc46PSS\u03c7 \ud835\udc46\u03c7\u2044 [\ud835\udc38T] (29)\nIf \ud835\udc46PSS\u03c7 is equal to v0/[ST]0, then Eq. (29) can be explored for the determination of zero-order SC. So far, several approaches have been derived in addition to the LW approach; none of them is without any calculation; assays have to be conducted for different concentrations of E before deriving Eq. (19); a single assay needs to be conducted if the LW approach is intended, but not without any calculation because the slope must be divided by [ET]. The most direct and minimal calculation is the reciprocal variant approach, which gives straight away 1/Vmax/KM (or 1/kcat/KM if [ET][ST]/v is plotted versus [ET]/v). Again, this is not without any calculation because one must take the reciprocal of 1/kcat/KM in order to quantify SC. This is besides the initial calculation of\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

Equation (29) requires information about substrate concentrations that are \u226a KM. To begin with, it is necessary to point out that any substrate range much greater than [ET] will give initial rates, which when plotted versus [ST] should give a polynomial curve of the quadratic kind. Thus, given a polynomial of the kind below, a general equation for the estimation of PSS can be derived.\n\ud835\udc66 = \u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc65 +  (30)\nDifferentiation with respect to x gives:\nd\ud835\udc66 d\ud835\udc65\u2044 = \u22122\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc65 +  (31)\nIf one recalls that v (which is y) = kcat [ES], then,\nd\ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc58catd[\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\u2044 = \u22122\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc65 +  (32)\nIntegrating yields:\n\ud835\udc58cat\u2206[\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46] = \u2212\ud835\udefc \ud835\udc65 2 + \u2206\ud835\udc65 (33)\nBearing in mind that under SS condition, (\u2206[\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46] \u2206\ud835\udc61\u2044 ) may be \u2248 zero.

To highlight or buttress the issue, an equation was derived for a zero-arbitrary choice of substrate concentrations as explained in Eq. (34); the calculated values of [ST] based on Eq. (34) were substituted into a polynomial equation for the determination of the corresponding sub-KM (for proper understanding, sub-KM substrate concentrations are those concentrations that are \u226a the KM )\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

However, this is strictly for illustration; otherwise, having calculated the sub-KM concentrations of the substrate, an assay of the same concentration or a higher concentration of the enzyme needs to be conducted. A typical reverse quasi-steadystate approximation (assumption) (rQSSA) is demonstrated with a plot of the initial rates versus the corresponding sub-KM substrate concentrations. This is illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 for the concentration of the enzyme equal to 0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L and 0.002 g/L, respectively; the rQSSA relic is that of a linear curve whose coefficient of determination is typically \u2265 0.999. This is as long as the concentration range is < than the putative KM value of the enzyme, and better still, it should be \u226a [ET] [23, 37]. In such a scenario, the zero-order SC cannot be inferred from data points\u2014the initial rates in particular\u2014that either validate only rQSSA or partially validate sQSSA or by extension of the parameter domain that validates both rQSSA and sQSSA [38, 39].\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

These are illustrated with Figures 3 (for [ET]=0.002 g/L) and 4 (for [ET]=0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L). The \u201cburst phase-like\u201d initial rate and it\u2019s corresponding [ST]0 are defined respectively by Eq. (24) and Eq. (26b). The latter appears to be either higher or lower than the calculated sub-KM concentration of the substrate. With 0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L of the enzyme, the sub-KM concentration ranges are 1.2558-1.3332 and 1.278-1.438 g/L, respectively; at those relevant values of [ET] (0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L), it is surprising to observe that the substrate concentration ([ST]0 = 3.752 and 2.457\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

Though they are < than the substrate concentration range (5-10 g/L) chosen for the assay, they are nevertheless > than the corresponding KM (Table 1). The situation is totally different where the concentration of the enzyme is 0.002 g/L. The [ST]0 value is < the Michaelis-Menten-like KM. The term Michaelis-Menten-like KM implies that what is referred to as KM is indeed better described as an enzyme-substrate dissociation constant applicable to a situation where [ET] is > [ST] or where [ST] is not \u226b [ET]. It is possible too, that [ST] may be \u2248 [ET] [40]. Whatever the case, the burst-like initial rates for 0.0002 g/L (55.448 M/min) and 0.0005 g/L (43.78 M/min)\nwere > the calculated initial rates corresponding to the sub-KM concentration ranges, which are respectively 49.367-49.599 and 39.856-40.794 M/min (Table 1). Again, values reported for\n0.002 g/L of the enzyme were compared differently; the burst-like initial rate (14.26 M/min) is\n< initial rates (29.447\u201354.572 M/min), corresponding to the sub-KM [ST] values ranging between 0.405 and 0.909 g/L. The situation might be different if the assay is carried out using the sub-KM concentrations to generate rates rather than the calculations. The important finding is that there is a practical and theoretical guide in the determination of a lower substrate concentration regime, which may be > or < the KM in accordance with the effect of concentration of the enzyme. The effect may imply a need to define the condition (s) that should characterize the kinetic parameters. Such characterization should be relevant to either rQSSA or sQSSA.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232.

The observed much lower value of MichaelisMenten-like KM with [ET] value = 0.002 g/L is as a result of the condition that validates rQSSA, whereby a single turnover event characterizes the catalytic cycle; this is to imply that most of the substrate molecules are subject to enzymatic action with a higher k1 value. This equally explains the view in the literature [37] that inequality cannot be held, having observed that with very high concentrations of the enzyme, \"KM\" is small, as in this study in which \"KM\" is 2.384 and 1.9 g/L (the values reported for [ET] = 0.0002 g/L) being values resulting from LWBP and RVDLP, respectively (Table 1). The values reported for [ET] = 0.0002 g/L are the lowest (Table 1).\nThe main objective of this study is to derive equations that are explorable for the direct\nestimation of SC. This is where Eq. (15) for the plot and Eq. (18) for the direct estimation of SC with a single calculation become relevant. The needed slopes are expressed in Figures 5 (for [ET]\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

The values of the SC compare as follows: 0.0002 > 0.0005 > 0.002 g/L. This is applicable to the Vmax values. Note, however, that four versions were given. The oldest approach is the Lineweaver-Burk plot (LWBP), which gave values similar to the reciprocal variant of the direct linear plot (RVDLP) and one of the newest approaches, Eq. (18), in this research. The second and newest approach is represented by Eq. (38). To put the latter into effect, Figure 7 for [ET] = 0.0002 g/L and Figure 8 for [ET] = 0.0002 and 0.0005 g/L were created; in this case, only preliminary calculations need to be carried out. The slope has a direct value of SC. The values of SC for 0.0005 and 0.002 for all versions are similar, but not so for 0.0002 g/L, perhaps due to measurement error. In all cases, however, the SC values with sub-KM [ST] as displayed under Figures 1 and 2 compare in the following order: 0.0002 > 0.0005 > 0.002 g/L.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

Even under normal conditions of assay (optimum conditions), some reactions may be enthalpically controlled while others are entropically controlled; the possibility that the same enzyme-catalyzed reaction is both entropically and enthalpically driven may not be ruled out. Illustrations of energy curves/diagrams abound in the literature, including Wikipedia, but this notwithstanding, Figures 9 and 10 are valuable for the elucidation of the issues in contention. When the enzyme identifies its substrate and catalytically binds to it (catalytic binding means that both substrate and enzyme are in the correct configurational and conformational orientation following effective binding), it reduces the energy barrier as the follow-up consequence; this is the specificity question.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.

The red doubled-headed arrow illustrates the energy barrier height; the orange doubled-headed arrow illustrates the upper energy barrier height-either Arrhenius activation energy or the Gibbs free energy of activation that must be added to the reactants for the reaction to proceed; the lower double-headed orange-colored arrow illustrates the ground-state energy level of the reactants; while the blue, green, and oxblood horizontal lines mark off the much lower ground-state energy level of the products, for the very efficient, efficient and neither efficient nor inefficient enzyme respectively. In these cases the product is more stable than the reactant.\nTo the best of the information available in the literature, apart from the proposition by a\nhighly respected scholar in the person of Johnson [20] in the field of biochemistry that a direct estimate of SC is desirable, there does not seem to have been any attempt in the past to derive new equations as in this study, let alone quantify the values of SC. One can, however, speculate that there is always a motivation for such a wish even if there is no evidence to that effect; chemical engineers, physical chemists, etc. may proffer benefits or the desirability of such. However, there is no denying the fact that the two newest approaches stand out as the most effective. This is so because, where there are many data points, a direct linear plot or its reciprocal variant becomes very cumbersome and has a high potential for error if software is not applicable. There is always a high tendency for outliers with LWBP given its imprecise initial rates.\nThe principle of efficiency is a regular concept in both elementary and postdoctoral\nclassical mechanics. Thus, the quality and the desirability of an enzyme for an industrial\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232.

Without information about the reverse rate constant, one can quickly give information about the efficiency of a chosen enzyme given the ratio of SC to k1 multiplied by 100 to give the percentage efficiency of the enzyme. As shown in Table 2, lower concentrations of the enzyme under conditions that validate the Michaelian equation and sQSSA exhibit the highest value of SC regardless of the kind of direct approach; in this study, the different concentrations of the enzyme compare as follows: 0.0002 > 0.0005 > 0.002 g/L. Apart from other engineering and technical issues, the efficiency of a reactor depends on the capacity of the enzyme to reduce the energy barrier, so that with a higher catalytic rate and a lower reverse rate constant, the SC can be very high, and consequently, the catalytic efficiency given as 100 SC/k1 could also be very high. It is without doubt that one can conclude that SC is emphatically different from catalytic efficiency; unlike SC, information about the second order rate constant, k1, and SC are needed for the determination of catalytic efficiency. The latter and SC should not be interchanged, for whatever reason.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I. Udema; ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0001-5662-4232. GSM:+234 08037476970 35\nThe table of values is an out of the application of the equation: k1= (kcat + k\u22121)/KM; k1 is a sum of two parts. Hence a fraction of it contributed by SC (kcat/KM) multiplied by 100 gives the percentage contribution which is equivalent to catalytic efficiency, SC. 5. CONCLUSION\nTwo new equations for the direct estimation of the specificity constant (SC) were\nderived. This is in addition to the equations for a non-arbitrary choice of pre-steady-state (PSS) or sub-KM concentrations of substrate, \"burst phase-like\" rate, and its corresponding substrate concentration, [ST]0. The SC values from the two newest methods for the three different concentrations of the enzyme range between 2,197.546 and 11,101.74 L/g min in one of the methods and 2,185.649 and 13,860.014 L/g min in the other method. The sub-KM values of the SC for the three different concentrations of the enzyme range between 1304.368 and 7943 L/g min. The burst phase-like initial rate, v0, and corresponding [ST]0, respectively, range between 14.26 and 55.448 M/min and 0.171 and 3.752 g/L; in all cases, the lowest concentration of the\nenzyme possesses the highest values of the parameters. The concept of SC is very different from catalytic efficiency. A future study may focus on investigating whether or not values of [ST] < [ST]0 with the same concentration of the enzyme can generate initial rates that, when plotted versus such values of substrate concentration, yields an original ratio equal to v0/[ST]0 for a possible determination of a zero-order SC at sub-KM values.\n* Corresponding author: Ikechukwu I.
