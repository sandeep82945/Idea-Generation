 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate optimal load management strategies for other types of industrial consumers not covered in this study, such as large manufacturing facilities, data centers, etc. The strategies could be tailored to the specific energy usage patterns of different industries.

2. Conduct cost-benefit analyses of switching to EToU tariffs for commercial and residential consumers. The paper focused on industrial consumers but expanding the analysis could provide insights into EToU adoption more broadly. 

3. Evaluate the environmental benefits of widespread EToU tariff adoption in terms of reduced CO2 emissions from shifting load away from peak times when more carbon-intensive generators are online. This could further incentivize the tariffs.

4. Develop more advanced forecasting techniques to predict industrial load profiles and better optimize load shifting strategies. More accurate forecasting could lead to greater cost savings.

5. Design incentives or educational programs to increase consumer awareness and adoption of EToU tariffs. Since the paper mentioned low voluntary participation, outreach could help consumers take advantage of the tariffs.
