Comparative Effectiveness of Prehabilitation Modalities: Conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of various prehabilitation modalities (e.g., online multimodal programs, face-to-face interventions, hybrid models) on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery. This study could assess outcomes such as complication rates, hospital stay length, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.

Personalization and Adaptation in Prehabilitation Programs: Investigate the impact of personalized and adaptive prehabilitation programs that adjust to patients' evolving needs and progress. This research could explore how tailoring exercise, nutrition, and psychological support to individual patient profiles and feedback affects program adherence, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.

Barriers and Facilitators in Diverse Populations: Conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to explore barriers and facilitators to prehabilitation program uptake among diverse patient populations, including those with varying levels of technology literacy, socioeconomic backgrounds, and comorbid conditions. This could lead to the development of more inclusive and accessible prehabilitation interventions.

Technology Integration and Patient Engagement: Explore the role of emerging technologies (e.g., wearable devices, virtual reality, AI-driven personal assistants) in enhancing engagement and adherence to prehabilitation programs. Research could focus on how these technologies can provide real-time feedback, motivational support, and more interactive and engaging content.

Long-term Outcomes and Follow-up: Initiate longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of preoperative multimodal e-Health programs on patient outcomes, including survival rates, recurrence, long-term quality of life, and functional status. Additionally, research could investigate the sustained impact of prehabilitation on lifestyle changes, physical activity levels, and dietary habits post-recovery.
