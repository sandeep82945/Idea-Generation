conclusions In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of ROSPAC heteronuclear decoupling sequence in different regimes from lowpower to high-power RF irradiation and under intermediate to fast MAS. The optimum decoupling conditions were found for lowpower irradiation and fast spinning frequency. In this case, the second-order cross-terms and first-order resonance conditions are small, and therefore, one obtains robustness toward 1H offset and radio-frequency field inhomogeneities.
