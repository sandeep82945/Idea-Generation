            "text": "\u201cWhile we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date. We appreciate everyone\u2019s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5 for everyone.\u201d Apple said on September 24, 2012, after iPhone 5 was sold out. However, among Apple\u2019s two? Two display suppliers, Japan Display Inc. and South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co. both had trouble producing to meet the demand due to the sharp increase in Apple\u2019s order.\nThe same thing happened with Xiaomi, a large mobile phone manufacturer in China. Lei Jun, who is the CEO of Xiaomi, promised the customers that Mi9 would satisfy the customers\u2019 demand without delay. However, the fact was not in line with the announcement of Mr. Jun, and Mi9 sold out quickly. After Lei Jun announced that the goods would be replenished soon, Xiaomi\u2019s component suppliers were under huge production pressure for the replenishment of some components that were required 3 months ago.\nAlong with the growth of E-commerce and express logistics, especially in China, where there are the largest Business-to-Business(B2B) platform and the largest logistics network in the world, the efficiency of trade is becoming higher, and the process from order to delivery becomes more time-saving. It also makes zero-stock transactions possible and necessary. Consider the following scenario: A firm acting as a distributor in the traditional supply chain used to buy products from upstream suppliers with wholesale prices at the beginning of the quarter. And during the sales quarter, they will store these products, try to handle these \u201cdead stock,\u201d and find a way to import more if these products are sold out. Therefore, in order to make more profits, the distributor hopes to change the order quantity at any time to cope with the constantly changing market demand.\nAs for suppliers in the upstream of the supply chain, in the \u201cwholesale price model,\u201d the suppliers make products according to the forecast of the market, then sell to distributors with the wholesale prices. The extra orders from retailers caused by the change in the market will create additional production pressure for the suppliers. Nowadays, one supplier may face many distributors, which makes the pressure caused by the changed orders even more serious in a B2B model. Being different from distributors who hope to have the chance to make real-time changes in the order, the suppliers, on the other hand, hope to confirm orders early and sell more products to the downstream of the supply chain. The conflict of interests between suppliers and distributors is difficult to solve by the \u201cwholesale price model.\u201d\nBy making new option contracts with suppliers, distributors will pay option prices to purchase the right\u2014the right to buy a range of goods from suppliers with exercise prices sometime later and enforce parts of the right at different periods of the sales quarter. Suppliers sell the right and charge option prices. When an option is exercised, the supplier is obligated to sell the goods to the distributor with the contractual price (exercise price). Therefore, when the option contract is made, the future trading volume is fully considered by the two parties to prevent any of them from deciding the sales volume or production volume arbitrarily.\nAt the same time, option prices can reflect the share of the risks and benefits. It not only prevents one party from bearing the loss alone caused by market risks but also shares extra profits from market speculation. For suppliers, option prices can be used as a portion of the commercial profits before the transaction is done; even if distributors break option contracts or buy fewer products relatively, they can also get option prices which can reduce their risk of loss. For distributors, options can be waived if the market outlook is not good, and the maximum loss is just the price of buying the options. When the market prospect is good, distributors will buy more products to earn more profits; then there will be a part of profits which can be transferred to suppliers.\nHowever, in the process of making options, it is impossible to fully predict the market demand. That is, the quantity of options and the final amount of sales are not the same. For retailers, when the quantity of options is less than the market demand, they still need to purchase at wholesale prices even after the execution of the options to maximize their profits. Therefore, the \u201coption model\u201d is not completely opposed to the \u201cwholesale price model,\u201d but they complement each other.\nAfter applying the new \u201cmixed model,\u201d when commodity prices and the market demand change in a small range, the total profits of the supply chain are relatively steady after the goods are sold out. A competitive relationship still exists between distributors and suppliers when it comes to profit allocation. Both of them are expected to gain a greater share of the profits from the supply chain. Thus, even if suppliers and distributors reach a win-win cooperation through option contracts, there will still be a gap in their profits. Under the condition where the profits of the supply chain are steady, the enterprises\u2019 internal factors, such as risk aversion and bargaining power, determine the profits of enterprises gotten from the whole chain and influence the profits of enterprises. In this paper, the Nash\u2019s bargaining model (Nash,1953) is used to discuss the influence of different risk aversion on profit distribution. The Eliashberg\u2019s model (Eliashberg,1986) is used to discuss the influence of bargaining power."

            "text": "The study about option contracts started early. Ritchken and Tapiero (1986) firstly suggested that the combination of option contracts with traditional ordering methods can resolve supply chain conflicts and strengthen supply chain cooperation. Cachon and Lariviere (2005) explored the option contracts that ensure credible demand forecast sharing across the supply chain with demand information asymmetry. Zhao et al. (2010) studied the supply chain coordination under option contracts and compared it to the basic wholesale price model considering the influence of risk aversion and bargaining power with random demand. To systematically explore the impact of the market demand, Brown and Lee (2003) analytically characterized the order quantity decision as a function of demand signal quality with a futures-options contract. They found that the number of futures decreases in demand signal quality, whereas the number of options increases in it.\nStoring to meet market demand is an important issue. Zhao et al. (2018) researched the two-stage option contracts combined with the liquid spot market, so the retailer could purchase both from the spot market and the option contracts in order to prevent supply from falling short of demand. Detailed comparisons between the mixed market scenario (in which the spot market and the option contract market coexist) and the scenarios of the pure spot market or the pure option contract market are made, and thereby they analytically examined the effects of supply competition between the spot market and the option contract market. K\u00f6le (2012) considered the replenishment strategy of a buyer with two suppliers. Since its regular supplier is prone to disruptions, the buyer utilizes an options contract with a more expensive but perfectly reliable supply option to prevent undersupply when relying on one supplier. Mandal et al. (2017) studied the newsvendor\u2019s pricing and stocking decisions under reference point effects. The demand faced by the newsvendor is endogenous, and the customers may also decide to procure the product from an outside option. They characterized the firm\u2019s optimal pricing and stocking decisions. Their analysis revealed a threshold policy on the firm\u2019s ordering and pricing decisions while considering the impact of reference point effects. Option contracts can improve the performance of both companies across the supply chain but cannot completely eliminate the impact of overconfidence (Wang et al., 2021). Zhuo et al. (2018) find that supply chain coordination is not always achieved, contrasting with the result that properly designed option contracts can always coordinate a supply chain in the absence of risk considerations.\nPricing strategies, including how to determine retail prices, option prices, or option exercise prices in option contracts, are worth of discussion. Hu et al. (2018) considered a coordination problem under option contracts in a two-echelon supply chain, where the product retail prices, option prices, option exercise prices, and order quantity are optimized. The market demand is random and sensitive to product retail prices. Their analysis considered two types of contracts. One is a conventional option contract, where suppliers determine the option prices and exercise prices, and retailers determine the product retail prices and order quantity. The other type of contract is an option contract with a joint pricing mechanism, for which two supply chain players determine a relationship between the option exercise prices and product retail prices. For both types of contracts, they developed a newsvendor model to examine how joint pricing impacts the coordination and decisions of the supply chain. The study of Wang et al. (2006) investigated the impacts of customer returns and a bidirectional option contracting a newsvendor firm\u2019s refund prices and order decisions. The stochastic demand is refund price-sensitive. They showed that the optimal refund price increases with the option prices and decreases with both the wholesale prices and exercise prices, while the optimal order quantity increases with the exercise prices but decreases with both the wholesale prices and option prices. In a retailer-led supply chain, the retailer will set the option price as low as possible in order to shift more risks to the supplier (Liu et al., 2020).\nIn this article, it calculates the optimal order quantity and prices and finds a \u201cmixed model\u201d (in which the wholesale price model and the option contract model coexist) are both stable and profitable. Compared with the above scholars\u2019 research, this article innovates in: (1) proving the stability of the\nmodel by calculating the conditions that the option or the wholesale prices must meet if the optimal trading volumes of suppliers and distributors are equal; (2) comparing the \u201cmixed model\u201d with the \u201cpure option model\u201d and the \u201cpure wholesale price model\u201d to determine which model can increase the profits of both sides; and (3) setting parameters to calculate the impact of risk preference and bargaining power on profit share."

The expectation of the distributor\u2019s profits under the wholesale price model is as follows:\nE Q E p Q x w Q x wd wd x wd wd \u03a0 ( ) = { }\u2212 * min , * = \u2212 \u2212 ( )\u222b p w Q p F x dxwd\nQwd * *\n0 (1)\nQ wd is the number of commodities held by the distributor.

But inevitably, the quantity of goods sold by the supplier does not always equal to the total quantity of its output. At the same time, the supplier will also undertake the disposal of the remaining goods and get the residual value. Its profits consist of three parts\u2014the selling price to the distributor, the marginal cost of producing goods, and the residual value of the remaining products.

When the number of goods held by the supplier exceeds the demand, many goods cannot be changed into the normal selling profits, which can only be converted into residual value after processing so as to reduce the expected profits.\nThus, as Q ws increases, the profit expectation of the distributor goes up and then goes down.

A pure option model, in which distributors and suppliers no longer trade with the wholesale prices, is appropriate for the situation when w e\u2265 and x N\u2264 . It means the exercise price is lower than the wholesale price, and the quantity of options can meet the demand of consumers. For a distributor, the most cost-effective way is to buy from the upstream with options. At this point, both sides abandon the old \u201cwholesale price model\u201d and make a mutually acceptable (o , e ). The distributor buys the options with the price o , then exercises the options within the stipulated time to buy units of goods from the supplier. The profits include the difference between the buying and selling, and the option price. In the pure option model, the number of products purchased by the distributor from the supplier is set as Q\nod . The profit expectation of the distributor is:\nE Q x od od \u03a0 ( )= E w wr e Q x o Nx od+ \u2212( ) { }\u2212 * min , *\n= w wr e Q F N w wr e F x dx oN od Qod + \u2212( ) ( )\u2212 + \u2212( ) ( ) \u2212\u222b* * * 0 (6)\nLet dE Q\ndQ x od od\nod\n\u03a0 ( ) = 0, and get Q\nod = N, which means that when the distributor buys N units of\nproducts from the manufacturer, the distributor gets the maximal expected profits under this model. When the number of products purchased by the distributor from the upstream is less than Q\nod\n(i.e., N), the more it purchased, the greater the expectation of profit is. At this point, the distributor will increase the number of purchases until buying N units of options from the buyer.\nThe supplier will sell options to the distributor at unit price o . It is assumed that the distributor purchases goods in real-time according to the market demand. It is also assumed that the actual output that the supplier can sell to the distributor is Q\nos . Then the supplier sells options in the number of\nmin ,Q x os{ } with the exercise price e . There should be some products that cannot be sold. This part of the products is recycled by the supplier. Thus, the supplier\u2019s profit equation includes these four parts: the option price, the sales income, the marginal cost of production, and the salvage value of the surplus products. The supplier\u2019s profit expectation can be expressed as follows:\nE Q E o N e Q x v Q x c Q x os os x os os os \u03a0 ( ) = + { }+ \u2212{ }\u2212 * * min , * max , *0\n= + ( )\u2212 \u2212 \u2212( ) ( )\u222bo N e Q F N c Q e v F x dxos os Qos\n* * * * * 0\n(7)\nLet dE Q\ndQ x os os\nos\n\u03a0 ( ) = 0, then one can get Q\nos = F\ne F N c e v \u2212 ( )\u2212 \u2212\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 * .\nWhen the contract quantity limitation is less than Q os , the more the supplier produces, the more the expectation of profit is. At this point, the supplier will increase production and try to sell more options to increase N . When the contract quantity limitation is more than Q\nos , the more the supplier\nproduces, the less the expectation of profit. At this point, the supplier will decrease production and try to sell less options to decrease N . So the optimal output of the supplier under the pure option model is Q\nos .\nProfit Under the Mixed Model. The mixed model uses the option to purchase and, at the same time, uses the wholesale price to fill the vacancy, which is applicable to when w e\u2265 and x N> . Although the option\u2019s exercise price is cheaper than the wholesale price, and the option quantity N is not enough to meet market demand, the distributor will require the supplier to sell q units of goods with the wholesale price in order to seek greater profits. The profit function of the distributor is:\nE E w r N q x o N e N w q x md x \u03a0 = +( ) + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212[ * * min{ , } * * * ]1\n= +( ) + \u2212 ( )\u2212 ( )   \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + \u222bw r N q N F N F x dx o N e N w qN N q * * * * * *1 (8)\nLet dE dq x md \u03a0 = 0 , and get q F r r N md * = +\n  \n\n  \u2212\u22121 1 .\nThat is, after the option is fully exercised, the distributor needs to buy additional products at the wholesale price as the quantity of goods is insufficient to meet the market demand. After calculation, the expected profit of the distributor is optimal when the number of products is purchased with the\nwholesale price, which is q md * . The total quantity of goods held by the distributor is F r\nr \u2212 +\n  \n   1 1 ,\nwhich is the same as the optimal quantity under the wholesale price model. Compared with the wholesale price model, the mixed model will not change the optimal purchase amount of the distributor.\nIn the mixed model, the supplier should not only use the option contract to sell the goods but also sell goods at the wholesale price. Its profit is made up of four parts\u2014the option price and its exercise price, the wholesale price, the marginal cost of production, and the salvage value of the surplus products.\nE E o e N w q c N q v N q x x ms x \u03a0 = +( ) + \u2212 +( )+ + \u2212[ * * * * max{ , }]0\n= +( ) + \u2212 +( )+ ( ) \u2212 ( )    + \u222bo e N w q c N q v F x dx q F NN N q * * * * * (9)\ndE\ndq v F N q F N w cx ms\n\u03a0 = +( )\u2212 ( )( )+ \u2212*\nafter calculation, dE dq x ms \u03a0 > 0 always stands up.

In the article published by Zhao (2010), the Nash product was used to judge the optimal value.

As can be seen from Figure 2, Q is increasing with\nQ ' \u03c3( ) > 0 , then \u03c3 \u03c3* > , which means \u2206 \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0s d> > 1\n2 , then the profits of the supplier are\ngreater than that of the distributor. If Q ' \u03c3( ) < 0 , that is \u03c3 \u03c3* < , which means \u2206 \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0s d< < 1\n2 ,\nthen the profits of the supplier are less than that of the distributor:\nQ N U U U d s s\n' * ' * '\u03c3 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0( ) = \u2212\n  \n  \n  \n   +\n   \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 2 2 2   \n  \n           *U d \u2206\u03c0 2\n(21)\nFrom equation (19), we can get U R U d d d d d d ' ) * ) \" ) \u2206 \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0= \u2212 , integrating both sides of\nthis equation, and getting 0 2\n2\n\u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u222b = \u2212 \n \n   R dU U d d d ' .

When R R\ns s d d \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0( ) < ( ) , the risk aversion level of distributor is higher, Q ' \u03c3( ) > 0 , \u03c3 \u03c3* > ,\n\u2206 \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 d s < < 1\n2 , we can infer that the supplier\u2019s profit increases and occupies a large amount\nin the total value of the system. When R R\ns s d d \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0( ) = ( ) , the risk aversion levels of the two are equal, Q ' \u03c3( ) = 0 ,\n\u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 s = 1\n2 , \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0\nd = 1\n2 , we can infer that the profit increase of these two parties through the\nnew model is equal. The results are tested by numerical simulations, and the utility functions of the suppliers and distributors are shown in Table 1. After assuming that \u2206\u03c0 \u03b4\nd = \u22121000 50 and \u2206\u03c0 \u03b4 s = \u221250 400 , we get the following figures\nshown in Figure 3. U d d = \u2206\u03c0 .\nComparing (a) with (b), or (c) with (d) in Figure 3, we can get that \u03c3* will be lower and increase the distributor\u2019s profit if the distributor\u2019s risk aversion is lower. It is the same as the supplier\u2019s risk aversion and profit.\nSo, if we use a new option contract when both parties are risk-averse, for those with lower risk aversion, the increase in profits is more than that of those with low risk aversion.\nCase 2: Let one party be risk-averse and the other risk-neutral. Assume that the distributor\u2019s risk\nappetite still satisfies R U\nUd d d\nd d\n= \u2212 ( ) ( ) > \" ' \u2206 \u2206 \u03c0 \u03c0 0 , U d d ' \u2206\u03c0( ) > 0 ,Ud d\" \u2206\u03c0( ) < 0 . Being different\nfrom the case 1, R U\nUs s s\ns s\n= \u2212 ( ) ( ) = \" ' \u2206 \u2206 \u03c0 \u03c0 0 and there will be U a s s = *\u2206\u03c0 .\nand convexity of the function remain the same. Substitute U a\ns s = *\u2206\u03c0 into equation (22), and we will get Q N R dU dU D r m r ' *\u03c3( ) = > 0 .\nSo \u2206 \u2206 \u2206\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 s d > > 1\n2 , the increasing profits of the supplier are larger.\nSo, in a model which consists of these two market participants, if one party is risk-averse and the other one is risk-neutral, the latter can increase more profits by the mixed model.\nBased on case 1 and case 2, it can be obtained that, after making the option contract and applying the mixed model in the supply chain, although Pareto improvement can be achieved in the profit, the increase in profits of both parties is not exactly the same. In terms of the market participant\u2019s risk appetite, the more risk aversion, the less increasing profits will be after the new \u201cmixed model\u201d is adopted by the market. However, the Nash model cannot introduce the influence of bargaining\npower on profit distribution. In the following part, other models are cited to calculate the influence of bargaining power."

The bargaining power of suppliers is high, which will promote the reduction of \u03c3* and increase its own profits. The high bargaining power of the distributor will promote the increase of \u03c3* together with its profits. In theory, the increased bargaining power of a market participant would allow them to reap all the increases in supply chain profits."

            "text": "This paper\u2019s method of reasoning mainly was mathematical calculation. This paper cited the ArrowPratt risk aversion, the Nash model, and the Eliashberg model to simplify the supply chain which consists of one distributor and one supplier, and to calculate profits of the system. It was concluded that this mixed model can not only achieve the Pareto improvement by increasing the profits of the supplier and distributor but also can increase the turnover and expand the production, compared to the traditional wholesale price model or the pure option model. This advantage will attract market participants to sign option contracts.\nMoreover, the mixed model has strong stability. It was calculated that if the number of options meets a certain range, it can not only attract both parties to sign option contracts but also can reach the optimal output after using option contracts. Although using options contracts to create the mixed model can increase the total profits of supply chain, how to divide the profits between distributors and suppliers would be affected by the internal factors for both sides. These \u201cinternal elements\u201d dominate profit growth by influencing option prices and exercise prices of the contracts reached by both parties.\nThis paper mainly discussed two factors which are risk preference and bargaining power. The conclusions are as follows: (1) under option contracts, the higher the risk aversion level of the distributor or supplier is, the more its profits will be, and (2) when the two sides have the same degree of risk aversion, their bargaining power will affect the profit distribution. The more initiative in the negotiation, the more profits will be reaped from the supply chain, one of them may even get all the profit increases in the supply chain using option contracts.\nThese conclusions are valuable to both sides of the supply chain. For the participants in the supply chain, the \u201cwholesale price model\u201d is affected by a large number of uncertainties, while the pure option contract model lacks stability. The mixed model established in this paper reflects risk and benefit-sharing and has the ability to respond with flexibility to market changes.\nWhen the supply chain is stable, the option price and the exercise price of the contract will be affected by the internal factors of the enterprise and determine the profit gap between the two parties. For the supplier and distributor, they can change their utility functions to increase profits by reducing the level of risk aversion, so they can achieve higher returns under the model of the steady state. Of course, the utility function of enterprises can also be modified by changing capital allocation and improving management mode.\nThe bargaining power of the supplier and distributor also influences the distribution results. According to calculations, a party with strong bargaining power can guide the value of an option contract to change. The bargaining power is affected by brand influence, resource holding, and industry competitiveness as well. As a party with weak bargaining power, it can change its utility function to prevent profits from being grabbed by the other party."
