1. **Investigate the effects of different annealing temperatures and times on the passivation properties of titanium oxide layers.** This could help to optimize the annealing process and improve the performance of titanium oxide-based electron-selective contacts.


2. **Explore the use of different titanium precursors for the deposition of titanium oxide layers.** This could help to identify precursors that produce layers with better passivation properties or that are more compatible with different deposition techniques.


3. **Investigate the effects of different tunnel oxide thicknesses on the passivation properties of titanium oxide layers.** This could help to optimize the thickness of the tunnel oxide layer and improve the performance of titanium oxide-based electron-selective contacts.


4. **Explore the use of different materials for the tunnel oxide layer.** This could help to identify materials that provide better passivation properties or that are more compatible with titanium oxide.


5. **Investigate the effects of different surface treatments on the passivation properties of titanium oxide layers.** This could help to identify treatments that improve the passivation properties of titanium oxide layers and make them more suitable for use in electron-selective contacts.
