    "abstractText": "Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has been effective for many patients with different types of cancer, resistance to ICB is common, and mechanisms of resistance are not completely understood. While IFN signaling can promote the response to ICB, the IFN pathway has also been shown to play a role in mediating ICB resistance. Given the pleiotropic effects of IFN signaling and the association between relapse following ICB and expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), Cucolo and colleagues explored candidate ISGs responsible for regulating ICB resistance by comparing the in vivo transcriptomic profiles of tumors from ICB-resistant versus ICB-sensitive murine melanoma models. In ICB-resistant tumors, enrichment of a resistance-associated gene signature was mediated primarily by IFN\u03b3 signaling, with the ISG Ripk1 most strongly impacted by deletion of the IFN\u03b3 receptor. In agreement with a role in promoting resistance, Ripk1 deletion enhanced ICB efficacy in both sensitive and resistant tumors. Known to function as a critical node controlling inflammation, cell death, and cell survival, RIPK1 signals downstream of multiple TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members, and a CRISPR\u2013Cas12a-based screen suggested that when RIPK1 was intact, RIPK1 drove TNFRSF complex I signaling, promoting NF-\u03baB activation and cell survival, but in the absence of RIPK1, TNFRSF complex II signaling was favored, promoting cell death by poising cancer cells to undergo TNFRSF-mediated CASP8 activation and apoptosis. In addition to influencing intrinsic mechanisms of ICB resistance, RIPK1 was shown to affect extrinsic resistance mechanisms by remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment, as Ripk1 deletion increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells while decreasing accumulation of immunosuppressive ARG1+ macrophages through changes in chemokine expression. Similar to loss of Ripk1, loss of this macrophage population through myeloid cell depletion enhanced ICB efficacy. In summary, this work highlights RIPK1 as an important therapeutic target with potential to counter both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of ICB resistance. \u25a0",

To assess the target landscape of HDACis, Lechner and colleagues conducted a quantitative chemical proteomics assay that used immobilized HDAC pharmacophores along with mass spectrometry to profile 53 molecules that encompass the majority of clinical HDAC drugs. Spanning 9 of the 11 HDACs, four major categories of inhibitors were defined that differed by their selective binding targets, with 29 binding to class I HDACs, 26 binding to class IIb HDACs, and only 6 binding to class IIa HDACs. Selectivity of these HDACis was assessed through measurement of the extent of target engagement and suggested high HDAC10 specificity for some inhibitors such as TH65 despite no highly specific HDAC10 probes being reported. Moreover, those inhibitors designated as specific for HDAC6 also revealed binding to class I HDACs, which contributed to low selectivity scores. Additionally, as some HDACs (namely HDAC1, 2, and 3) function as part of a complex, investigation into how the composition of these complexes can affect drug\npotency showed that selectivity of these inhibitors was in fact dependent on the specific composition of these complexes and supports the development of complex-specific drugs. Furthermore, metallo-\u03b2-lactamase domain-containing protein 2 (MBLAC2), an acyl-CoA hydrolase, was revealed as a common off-target for HDACis, being observed as an off-target for 24 different molecules at low nanomolar concentrations. Characterization of this understudied protein demonstrated that either knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of MBLAC2 led to the accumulation of extracellular vesicles as well as effects to cellular lipid composition including downregulation of hexosylceramides and upregulation of sphingomyelins. Overall, the results of this study reveal the target landscape of HDACis and indicate MBLAC2 as a major off-target of these molecules, suggesting its use in future drug discovery programs. \u25a0\nLechner S, Malgapo MIP, Gr\u00e4tz C, Steimbach RR, Baron A, R\u00fcther P, et al.
