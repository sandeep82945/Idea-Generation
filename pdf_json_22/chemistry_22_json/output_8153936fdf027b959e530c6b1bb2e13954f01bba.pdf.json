    "abstractText": "Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a kind of low-molecular-weight non-protein neurotoxin. It is one of the most potent neurotoxins found in nature, and it is found in puffer fish and various marine biota. The low sensitivity of previous analytical methods limited their application in puffer fish organ samples. This study established a method for the accurate and fast determination of TTX by reversed ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with proton-enhanced electron spray ionization\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. The method yields good peak shapes, high sensitivity and low coeluted interferences. The method was successfully applied to determine TTX in puffer fish tissue samples of about 0.2 g.",

            "text": "Seafood has always been considered nutritionally healthy and an important part of a balanced diet. However, over the past few decades, various types of poisoning incidents have been reported, and this has led to growing concerns with regard to the consumption of seafood. Both public health and aquaculture industries have been affected by such marine-toxin-associated poisoning [1,2]. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin that selectively inhibits voltage-dependent Na+ channels of nerves and skeletal muscles and is found primarily in Tetraodontidae fishes and Charoniasauliae conches. Furthermore, TTX is stable to heat, light and acid, and it is not degraded by conventional cooking processes, such as heating. It represents a major causative agent of food poisoning by natural animal toxins. The occurrence of TTX has mainly been reported in Asian countries and, more specifically, in Japan, with reports of many cases of TTX food poisoning related to the consumption of pufferfish [3,4]. When puffer fish food poisoning occurs, a positive result for poisoning is normally determined based on the patient\u2019s symptoms and the detection of TTX in residual food. Recently, numerous methods for TTX analysis have been published. Several drawbacks should be mentioned. Bioassays are complicated by problems of inaccuracy associated with the determination of death, difficulty of mouse management that hampers emergency responses and animal welfare issues [5]. On the other hand, physicochemical methods with instruments, such as those using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS), have been reported, but these methods are limited by their complicated operation due to the requirement of degradation by strong alkali and trimethylsilyl derivatization [6,7]. Reports using LC-MS/MS are also emerging, as this instrument has become common. However, the detection limit of LC-MS/MS has always been deemed to be not adequate for the quantitative analysis of real samples with trace levels of TTX due to suppression by matrix effects.

In the present study, ACQUITY BEH C18 (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m, Waters), and ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m, Waters) employed in previous reports [9,16], were investigated for the separation of TTX, which are the octadecylsilane stationary phase and amide stationary phase, respectively.

The mobilephase elution gradient and flow rate were optimized to obtain a good chromatographic separation effect.

In this experiment, we optimized the extraction solvents, including acid selectivity (formic acid, acetic acid), and co-solvents (water, MeOH, and ACN). Moreover, we compared and tested the ability of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1% acid in solutions to extract TTX from puffer fish tissue samples. Table 1 shows that the 1% acetic acid methanol solution resulted in a mean recovery rate of 90.1% for TTX at\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8967 4 of 10\n50 ng/mL, which provides an acceptable cleaning extract and decreases ion suppression for the LC-MS/MS analysis. Therefore, 1% acetic acid in methanol was chosen as the final extraction solvent. The lipid content (m/m) of most puffer fish liver and ovaries is approximately >40% [20]. Thus, the lipids in the extracts had to be eliminated or reduced in order to reach the sensitivity of the proposed method. Finally, sonication was carried out for 15 min in an ice-water bath, and the cold extracts were immediately centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u25e6C for 15 min to remove the lipids and precipitate as much of the solids as possible [21]."

In this study, similar proton-enhanced ionization conditions were observed in direct injection MS/MS analysis, and the formation of [M + H]+ ions was only observed. Given that formic acid as a proton-supply reagent can offer abundant protons, the infusion of formic acid could efficiently increase the formation of [TTX + H]+. Although UPLC-MS/MS requires a longer running time (9 min) than direct MS analysis, chromatographic separation prior MS/MS yields significant quantitative and qualitative advantages. Figure 2 shows that the post-column infusion of formic acid enhanced the analytical sensitivity of TTX (2000 \u00b5g/L) 10-fold compared to the results of no infusion of formic acid. However, the high content of acid in the mobile phase of reversed UPLC would have a bad effect on the retention of the column. As shown in Figure 3, when a relatively high level of formic acid was added to the mobile phases with the separation of ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide, matrix components of puffer fish samples were coeluted with the target analyte and unsatisfactory peak shapes and sensitivities were found for TTX. Hence, a post-column infusion of formic acid was employed by setting the flow state of the instrument to the combine mode to achieve proton-enhanced ionization, and the optimal condition was to add a 0.4% (v/v) formic acid solution at an infusion rate of 5 \u00b5L min\u22121."

The initial conditions were 90% B and held for 0.5 min, then it was ramped to 50% for 2 min, held for 1.5 min to 3.5 min, and then returned to the initial conditions for 4 min, which were then equilibrated for 5 min before the injection of the next sample. A SCIEX 6500 QTRAP+ triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA), equipped with an Ion Drive Turbo V electrospray-ionization (ESI) interface, was used for assay development. Nitrogen (99.999%) was employed as the nebulizer, for desolvation and as cone gas. The typical ion source parameters were as follows: ion spray voltage = 5000 V; declustering potential: 65 V; gasification temperature = 400 \u25e6C; ion source gas 1 = 60 psi; ion source gas 2 = 60 psi; curtain gas = 35 psi. The MS/MS analysis was operated in ESI positive mode with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) for TTX detection. The optimized MS/MS parameters and compound-specific MRM transitions were as follows: the precursor ion was 320 and the daughter ions were 302 and 162 with collision energy 25 eV and 40 eV, respectively. Between the optimized MRM transitions for TTX, the 320/302 pair that showed the highest sensitivity and selectivity were selected as the \u2018quantifier\u2019 for quantitative monitoring. The additional transition 320/162 acted as the \u2018qualifier\u2019 for the purpose of verifying the identity of TTX. In order to increase detection sensitivities for the TTX, a post-column infusion of formic acid was employed by setting the flow-state of the instrument to the combine mode to add a 0.4% (v/v) formic acid solution\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8967 9 of 10\nat an infusion rate of 5 \u00b5L min\u22121. SCIEX Analyst Work Station Software (Version 1.6.3) and Sciex Multi Quant\u2122 3.0.3 were employed for MRM data acquisition and processing."

Working standard curves (1, 2, 10, 20, 100, 200, 400 and 2000 ng/mL) were prepared daily by diluting the stock solution with MeOH. The LOD and LOQ were calculated based on S/N (ratio of signal to noise) = 3 and 10, respectively, based on the sample at the lowest spiked concentration level. Accuracy and precision were expressed as recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSDs), which were evaluated at three concentration levels (10 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL) spiked in six replicates of blank liver, serum and ovary samples. The intra- and inter-run precision and accuracy of the assay (n = 5) were determined as RSDs (%) and recoveries (%). Samples spiked with 2, 20 and 200 ng/mL were analyzed. Five replicates at each concentration were processed to estimate the intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. Matrix effects were calculated in the serum, liver and ovary by comparing the analytical areas for the extracted samples spiked at concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 ng/mL with solvent standards, following the equation\nMatrix effect(%) = [(\npeak area of fortified extract peak area of solvent standard\n) \u2212 1 ] \u00d7 100%"

The calculated LOD and LOQ of the proposed method was as low as 20 pg/g and 67 pg/g, respectively, thus facilitating the determinations of trace levels of TTX in small (e.g., 0.2 g) puffer fish tissue and organ samples.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, investigation, writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.L.; validation, supervision, R.W.; project administration, funding acquisition, P.W.
