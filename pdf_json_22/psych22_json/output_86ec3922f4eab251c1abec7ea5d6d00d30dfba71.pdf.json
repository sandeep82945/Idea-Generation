Some published studies have investigated the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the pandemic. However, the results vary widely. We aimed to systematically analyze and estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and attempted to reveal the reasons for prevalence variety in previous studies.\nMethods: Published studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP Database), China National Knowledge database (CNKI), and the WanFang database from December 2019 to May 2021. The quality of all included studies was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist and the American Agency for Health Care Quality and Research\u2019s (AHRQ) cross-sectional study quality evaluation items. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modeling.\nResults: Of the 1,708 references screened, 13 related reports that involve 41,729 participants were included. The results suggested that the pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID19 epidemic was 28.6%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence was highest among the studies using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (46.8%) and lowest among these using Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRSC) (11.4%). All studies using PHQ-9 set the cutoff at 5 points instead of 10. The pooled prevalence of studies that include primary school students was lower (16.5%) than that of studies excluding primary school students (39.1%).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870346\nConclusion: The meta-analysis suggests that depressive symptoms were relatively prevalent among Chinese children and adolescents during COVID-19, especially among the secondary school students. The suitable screening tools and cutoff should be carefully chosen in the survey.\nKeywords: COVID-19, children and adolescent, China, depression, meta-analysis"

            "text": "Depression severely impacts the mental health of children and adolescents. According to previous studies, depression in children and adolescents may have devastating consequences (1\u20133).\nEarly evidence highlighted that depression symptoms are very common among children and adolescents in China, the prevalence was estimated to be 22.2% (4), before the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China (5), it had spread rapidly among provinces in China in a short time. At the same time, the COVID-19 was also reported around the world (6). The Chinese government implemented social distancing, home confinement, and school closure measures to control the spread of the infection. All Chinese children and adolescents were separated from society and schools from January to April 2020 (7). The prolonged home confinement is associated with a range of negative outcomes for children and adolescents, such as decreased social interactions with peers, reduced physical activity, increased conflicts with parents, and academic pressures due to sudden changes in traditional learning methods (8, 9). These might lead to a persistent impact on the mental health of children and adolescents and eventually contribute to the occurrence of depressive symptoms (10).\nThere have been some cross-sectional studies on the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, the results vary widely, some studies found that it was as high as 52.4% (11), while others found that it was as low as 10.4% (12). Given the large disparity in previous cross-sectional studies since the beginning of the pandemic, the purpose of this review was to provide an estimate of the prevalence of depressive symptoms and to explore the reasons for prevalence variety in previous studies (e.g., differences in the application of screening scales). This is of great significance for further intervention and may also play a certain role in the design of the future studies on depression in children and adolescents who experience major public events."

            "text": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 original studies involving 41,729 participants showed that 10.4\u201352.4% of children and adolescents were screened positive for depression during the COVID-19 epidemic, and the pooled prevalence was 28.6%. This prevalence was almost the same as that of the general Chinese population during the COVID-19 outbreak, which was 28% (30) (12 original studies involving 27,475 individuals were included). In a meta-analysis of 29 studies that include 80,879 children and adolescents worldwide, the pooled prevalence of\nclinical depression was estimated as 25.2% (31). This result is similar to our study.\nThere are two possible reasons for the relative high prevalence of depressive symptoms among children and adolescents during the pandemic: First, the COVID-19 spreads via human-tohuman transmission, children, and adolescents might worry about infections for themselves and their family members, especially when they had some common symptoms (such as a cough, runny nose, and headache) (32). Second, during the pandemic, home confinement also caused many adversely psychological impacts on children and adolescents, such as depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders (33). The online classes and e-learning could not provide the same environment as the live school (34) and social contact, security, and selfefficacy of students (35, 36). These might all contribute to the occurrence of depression in children and adolescents. While the experience of depression in adolescence is associated with a myriad of adult psychosocial outcomes, it may lead to the propagation of difficulties across the lifespan (37). We need to pay more attention to the mental health of children and adolescents during the pandemic.\nIn addition, before COVID-19, the prevalence of depression in children and adolescents worldwide was 12.9% (38), while in mainland China it was 22.2% (4) (62 original studies involving 232,586 children and adolescents). This suggests that the global prevalence of depression among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic has doubled when compared to prepandemic data (31), with only a slight increase in mainland China. The possible reasons for the slight increase in China are as follows: first, the pre-pandemic situation may contribute to this result. There was a high prevalence of depression in Chinese children and adolescents before COVID-19. As is known to all, the main purposes of education in Chinese schools are to obtain higher scores in the National College Entrance Examination with repeated exercises and examinations. School education stress is a serious social problem in China, many tests, exams, strict rules, and regulations in school, all could be stressors of depression (39\u201341). Second, the post-pandemic situation may deteriorate continually. A meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression symptoms among the general population was still increasing after the peak of COVID-19 in China (42). The possible reason is that the occurrence of depression requires a certain period of emotional accumulation and the occurrence of post-disaster depression has a certain delayed effect (43). While most studies included in this review were conducted in 2\u20133 months after COVID-19, the investigation time range was relatively narrow. The prevalence of depression may continue to increase during the continuing pandemic. As COVID-19 has continued for more than 2 years, the actual prevalence may be much higher than our result."

For instance, a previous metaanalysis demonstrated that the prevalence of depression among primary school students in China was 17.2% (27 studies that involve 42,374 subjects were included) (44), and the prevalence of depression among secondary school students was 24.3% (45) (51 original studies that involve 144,060 adolescents were included). We also found that in grade7 of secondary school, the prevalence was 24.5%, while in grade 10, the prevalence was increased to 40.1%.\nThe difference in the prevalence of depression between different grade groups may be related to biological changes, such as hormone changes during puberty (46). A meta-analysis indicated that depressive symptoms are dynamic during puberty. Depressive symptoms tend to increase in early adolescence, reach their peak during mid-adolescence, and then begin to decrease in the late adolescence (during the transition to adulthood) (47). Additionally, in primary and secondary schools, the academic difficulty is different. Adolescents in higher grades may experience more adjustment difficulties, such as academic problems and social deficits, and are therefore more likely to have depressive symptoms. Senior students (especially these facing university entrance exams) suffered more from abruptly coronavirus-related new challenges, i.e., uncertainty of the exam time and the date of returning school.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870346"

            "text": "In this study, we also found that a total of five different screening self-rating scales were used in cross-sectional studies that investigate the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different depression screening scales have different clinical validity on the prevalence of depression (48).\nSome previous studies have explored the application of CDI in children and adolescents in mainland China, showing that the internal consistency coefficient of CDI was between 0.82 and 0.88, and the test-retest reliability was between 0.75 and 0.89, which means it has acceptable reliability and validity (49). The sensitivity of the DSRSC for diagnosing depression among children and adolescents in China was 86%, and the\nspecificity was 82% for the assessment (50). The DASS-21 has previously been used to assess children and adolescents who were aged 11\u201319 in China (51) and among these populations after the Sichuan earthquake (52). Previous studies also found that the CESD showed high reliability and stability in screening adolescents with depression (53). A large sample of Chinese children and adolescents completed the PHQ-9 in a crosssectional survey (N = 10,933), the results indicated that the PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid scale and can be used in Chinese children and adolescents (54). The reliability and validity of the PHQ-9 scale in Chinese children and adolescents also have been tested, and it was found that the optimal cutoff of the PHQ-9 scale was 10 points, with a sensitivity of 93.33% and a specificity of 96.83% based on a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (55).\nIn our analysis, the PHQ-9 was applied the most (4 studies that involved 17,707 participants), the pooled prevalence of depression assessed by the PHQ-9 scale was 46.8%, significantly higher than other scales (11.4% with DSRSC, 18.9% with CDI, 22.6% with DASS-21, and 36.6% with CESD). The PHQ-9 was applied by Zhou et al. (20), Zhang et al. (27), Chen et al. (29), and Yang et al. (22) in our study. They all adopted 5 points as the cutoff point for depression. This may be the reason for its higher detection rate of depression in the assessment of Chinese children and adolescents. To sum up, our results suggest that PHQ-9 may be a widely used self-assessing depression scale for children and adolescents in China, and 10 points may be an appropriate cutoff."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the severity of the epidemic and control measures varied among provinces in China, thus the prevalence of depression might vary in different provinces (57). Unfortunately, however, in our analysis, most of the studies did not provide accurate information about provinces, so we could not perform the analysis by province. We will continue to pay attention to this topic, there may be enough information to conduct the analysis by the province in the future. Second, due to the heterogeneity of screening scales, the evidence to support this estimated value of the depression prevalence is not strong enough. We will continue to update the data. If the data are sufficient, we will carry out a meta-analysis based on one scale, such as PHQ-9. The pooled prevalence rate will more truly reflect the situation."

The strengthened psychoeducation, enhanced policy efforts, and effective medical services are needed. In the future, epidemiological studies on Chinese children and adolescents should focus on selecting scales that have good\nreliability and validity in this population and adapt appropriate cutoff points. In addition, it is worth to consider that performing a two-stage prevalence estimation (58) after the COVID-19 epidemic is fully controlled and ends."
