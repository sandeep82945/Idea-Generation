    "abstractText": "In the present research, graphene was synthesized directly on a Si(100) substrate via combining direct microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and protective enclosure. The graphene flake orientation was controlled using suitable synthesis conditions. We revealed that high processing temperatures and plasma powers promote vertical graphene growth. The main related physical mechanisms were raised temperature gradients, thermal stress, ion bombardment, and elevated electric field effects. Lowering the synthesis temperature and plasma power resulted in planar graphene growth. An elevated synthesis temperature and long deposition time decreased the graphene layer number as the carbon desorption rate increased with temperature. Dominating defect types and their relationships to the graphene growth conditions were revealed. Planar graphene n-type self-doping was found due to substrate-based charge transfer. In the case of vertical graphene, the increased contact area between graphene and air resulted in the adsorption of more molecules, resulting in no doping or p-type doping.",

High levels of charge carrier mobility and multiplication, optical transparency, exibility, very high Young's modulus and failure strength, high ductility, and chemical inertness are all present.1\u20134 Graphene can be grown as \u201cclassic\u201d planar sheets, as vertical graphene akes and nanowalls, and as a ller in nanocomposite materials. Among the numerous possible graphene applications, it has been considered for use as a new transparent conductor, a monolayer alternative to Schottky contact metals, and even as an active layer in semiconductor devices and different sensors. In particular, vertical graphene nanowalls provide a high surface area that is benecial for the fabrication of biosensors and energy-storage devices.5 Planar graphene is benecial for transparent electronics and transparent conductor applications, such as in various photoelectric and microelectronics devices.5\nUsually, planar graphene is fabricated via graphite exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on catalytic metal (Cu, Ni, Co) foil, with subsequent transfer to the target substrate.6\nersity of Technology, K.

This can result in graphene contamination by different adsorbents7 or the formation of wrinkles or ripples on graphene.8\nGraphene can be synthesized directly on semiconducting or dielectric substrates using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Usually, remote plasma systems are used for direct graphene synthesis to avoid radiation-based defect formation or even the total etching-out of the growing graphene lm.9 In such a way, planar graphene layers are grown.9,10 Vertical graphene sheets and nanowalls are synthesized in direct plasma systems.9\nSome studies have shown the growth of vertical and planar graphene in the same PECVD system on dielectric or semiconducting substrates.5,11\u201316\nSwitching between the growth of planar and vertical graphene on a glass substrate can be achieved using a copperfoam-based Faraday cage with different pore sizes.5 However, this method has some disadvantages. Copper atoms can be deposited on the graphene.17 It was found that the density of graphene nanowalls directly grown on SiO2 and Al2O3 substrates via microwave PECVD can be reduced via combining a protective metallic shield with lowered acetylene/hydrogen gas ow ratios.11 However, planar graphene was grown on the entire substrate surface only when using additional NH3 gas ow.11 Thus, only n-type doped graphene could be achieved. In that study, no details regarding the geometric parameters of the protective shield were provided.

However, the separate planar graphene akes covered only a tiny part of the substrate.12\nIn some studies, the graphene ake orientation was changed via controlling the methane and etching gas ow ratios without reporting the use of Faraday-cage-type protective shields. Notably, vertical graphene was grown on silicon via microwave PECVD using CH4/H2 gas ow ratios higher than 5.5, and horizontal graphene was synthesized using lower methane/ hydrogen gas ow ratios.13 However, in other studies, vertical graphene was grown using very different CH4/H2 gas ow ratios, and no planar graphene was reported.18\u201320\nThe orientation of graphene akes directly synthesized on SiO2 lm was changed from planar to vertical via varying the CH4/Ar gas ow ratio in a CH4 : Ar:H2 gas mixture in an ECR PECVD system.14,15 However, in numerous studies, vertical graphene was grown on SiO2 and other substrates from a CH4 : H2 mixture without any argon gas (see reviews18,21\u201326). On the other hand, planar graphene was synthesized on SiO2 and glass substrates via ECR PECVD using a C2H4 : Ar gas mixture.27 The addition of CO2 gas to the methane, hydrogen, and argon gas mixture to grow graphene on glass and quartz substrates using magnetron microwave PECVD resulted in planar graphene rather than vertical graphene.16 However, other authors grew vertical graphene from a CH4/CO2 gas mixture28 or even CO2 gas alone.29 Thus, changing the graphene sheet orientation via adjusting the synthesis gas ow ratio or composition seems to be very system specic.\nIn the present research, we achieved control of the orientation of PECVD-synthesized graphene akes via setting appropriate growth process conditions. The main technological parameters affecting the graphene structure and ake orientation were considered. Those parameters are plasma power, pressure, the gas mixture composition, temperature, and time.18,21,26,30 Technological processing conditions benecial for the growth of planar graphene and vertical graphene on Si(100) substrates were found. High processing temperatures and plasma powers promoted vertical graphene growth due to increased temperature gradients, thermal stress, ion bombardment, and electric eld effects. The suppression of these effects using lower synthesis temperatures and plasma powers promoted planar graphene growth."

The steel enclosure can withstand much higher processing temperatures and powers without being damaged or without graphene poisoning due to evaporation or sputtering products. We were not able to grow graphene inside the plasma discharge zone when no protective enclosure was used.36 Furthermore, a graphene sample placed inside CH4/H2 plasma without the protective enclosure was fully etched-out.\nThe graphene synthesis process parameters (plasma power, pressure, methane and hydrogen gas ows, temperature, and time) were varied.

Thus, we used the I(2D)/I(G) ratio for graphene layer number evaluation, despite the presence of defects. The D/D0 peak intensity ratio revealed the types of dominating defects.43 The full width at half maximum of the G peak (FWHM(G))40\u201342 and positions of the G and 2D peaks (Pos(G) and Pos(2D))36,41,42,44,45 were also taken into account as parameters sensitive to graphene doping and stress. The spectra were measured in several different places on the sample. Average values and standard deviations of different Raman spectra parameters were calculated for each sample.\nRaman mapping was accomplished for selected samples using an inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw, Wotton-under Edge, United Kingdom) equipped with a thermoelectrically cooled ( 70 C) CCD camera. Spectra were excited using 532 nm laser radiation and dispersed using a grating with 1800 lines per mm. The laser power was restricted to 0.45 mW and focused on a spot on the surface with a diameter of approximately 1 mm by using a 50 /0.75 NA objective lens (Leica). The Raman maps were collected from a surface area of 50 50 mm2 with a 1.5 mm step size. The acquisition time for each spectrum was set to 4 s. To plot the I(2D)/I(G) maps, experimental spectra were tted with a single Gaussian\u2013Lorentzian shape component for each of the spectral modes (G and 2D) using soware written in our lab based on MATLAB R2013 (The MathWorks Ins.).\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were carried out at room temperature using a NanoWizardIII atomic force microscope (JPK Instruments, Bruker Nano GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The data were analyzed using JPKSPM data processing soware (Version spm-4.3.13, JPK Instruments, Bruker Nano GmbH). The AFM images were collected using an ACTA (Applied NanoStructures, Inc., Mountain View, USA) probe. A pyramidal cantilever was used. The radius of curvature (ROC) was <10.0 nm and the cone angle was 20 . The reex side coating was Al with a thickness of 50 5 nm. The probe force constant was set at 40 N m 1, and the resonance frequency was in the 300 kHz range. Height, amplitude, and phase diagrams were recorded in steps with a scan size of 2 mm and a scan speed of 1 Hz. The integral gain was set to 2, while the proportional gain was set to 5. Pixels for samples and lines were 516 516, operating in tapping mode.\nSome samples were additionally investigated using a Helios Nanolab 650 scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands)."

The D0 peak at 1620 cm 1 is present as a shoulder of the G peak. The presence of defect-related Raman bands is typical for graphene lms directly synthesized on silicon and silicon-based dielectrics, such as SiO2 and Si3N4, due to the nanocrystalline nature of these layers.9,10,43 The Sisubstrate-related peak at 520 cm 1 (ref. 19 and 46) is visible in the Raman spectra of our samples; the broad feature in the vicinity of 950\u20131000 cm 1 corresponds to the silicon rst overtone mode.\nSignicant differences between the synthesized graphene Raman spectra were found. The Si(100) substrate-related peak at 520 cm 1 was much stronger than the graphene-related peaks for some samples. In other cases, the intensity of the G peak was comparable with the intensity of the Si-related peak or it was even higher.\nIt should be noted that the number of graphene layers can be evaluated based both on the relative intensities of the Si and G bands and the I(2D)/I(G) ratio.46,47 The I(G)/I(Si) ratio should increase and the I(2D)/I(G) ratio should decrease with an increased graphene layer number. It should be mentioned that the I(2D)/I(G) intensity ratio can decrease not only due to an increase in the number of graphene layers but also because of an increase in the disorder/defective nature of a sample.38 However, as discussed above, in our case this ratio can be used to study the graphene layer number changes in different\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18759\u201318772 | 18761\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The plot of I(2D)/I(G) vs. I(G)/I(Si) revealed contradictory results (Fig. 2a). Three groups of samples were found. For the rst group, the I(2D)/I(G) ratio decreased with an increase in the I(G)/I(Si) ratio. In numerous studies, the presence of this behavior for Raman spectra of planar graphene samples indicates a rising graphene layer number.46,47 For the second group, the tendency of the I(2D)/I(G) ratio to rise with the I(G)/I(Si) ratio is seen. In the case of samples with the highest I(G)/I(Si) ratios, no clear relationship is found between the I(2D)/I(G) ratio and I(G)/I(Si) ratio. These contradictory results can be explained via considering different mechanisms affecting the dependence of the I(2D)/I(G) and I(G)/I(Si) ratios on the graphene layer number.46,47 The I(2D)/I(G) ratio is related to changes inside graphene.46,47 At the same time, the I(G)/I(Si) ratio depends on silicon substrate signal attenuation.46 In such a case, the orientation of the graphene akes can be crucial because vertical graphene nanowalls can absorb several tens of times more light than planar graphene with the same layer number.48 Thus, one can suppose that for vertical graphene nanowalls the I(G)/I(Si) ratio does not depend on the graphene layer number. The selected samples were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to test this assumption (Fig. 2b, 3, and 4, and S4\u2013S21\u2020).\nThe I(G)/I(Si) and I(2D)/I(G) ratios increased with the graphene roughness value (Rq) (Fig. 2b). Thus, based on the I(2D)/I(G) ratio, the sample roughness increases despite a decrease in the graphene layer number. This means that a graphene roughness increase is not related to a graphene layer number change. Taking into account Rq values above 5 nm, in this case, growth of nonplanar graphene akes can be supposed (Fig. 3 and 4). A thorough study of the graphene height histograms and AFM images of selected samples revealed that the samples with the lowest Rq values are planar graphene (Fig. 2b and 3a, S13\u2013S15, S18, and S20\u2020). In this case, the maximum feature height is 2\u20133 nm. Signicant phase contrast was found for these low-roughness graphene layers (see, e.g., Fig. S12 and S13\u2020), indicating the presence of different phases on the surfaces of the samples.49\nFig. 2 (a) A plot of I(2D)/I(G) vs. I(G)/I(Si); and (b) plots of I(G)/I(Si) vs. Rq\n18762 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18759\u201318772\nThus, some through-holes are present in the planar graphene layers. According to ref. 50 and 51, the graphene layer thickness is 0.41 nm. Thus, the maximum planar graphene thickness is 5\u20136 layers. No surface features can be seen in a typical SEM image measured for a sample from this group, indicating the growth of planar graphene (Fig. 4a). The Raman microscopy mapping study conrmed the deposition of graphene over the entire sample area (see the insets of Fig. 4a and b). Thus, the suppression of the Sirelated peak is in good accordance with the increased sample roughness and non-planar graphene growth.\nSamples with larger Rq values and with G/Si ratio values similar to planar graphene represent a mixture of planar and vertical graphene (Fig. 2). In this case, according to the height histograms, large proportions of the feature heights are within the range typical for planar few-layer graphene (Fig. 3c and d, and S11\u2013S13, S16, and S18\u2020). However, signicant proportions of the heights are well beyond the thickness of ten graphene layers, despite the Raman spectra of the samples still being typical of graphene (Fig. 1b).\nThe last group of samples involves vertical graphene lms. Their height histogram values are between several nm and several tens of nanometers (Fig. 3b, S4, S9, and S18\u2013S20\u2020). Vertical graphene akes can be clearly observed in a typical SEM image (Fig. 4b). In this case, the presence of a mixture of bilayer and single-layer graphene can be supposed according to the I(2D)/I(G) ratio values of close to one.\nClarifying the analysis of the I(2D)/I(G) vs. I(G)/I(Si) graph, one can see that the rst group of samples is made up of planar graphene and some planar graphene samples with the inclusion of non-planar graphene akes (Fig. 2). The second group of samples is made up of mixed vertical and planar graphene samples and some vertical graphene samples. The third group is made up of vertical graphene samples only. This is related to the different graphene synthesis conditions. Most of the samples in group I are grown at a temperature of 700 C using plasma power of 0.7 kW. However, all the samples in group III were synthesized at a temperature of 900 C, plasma power of\nand I(2D)/I(G) vs. Rq.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "The technological parameters studied were plasma power, pressure, gas ows, temperature, and time. The electric eld strength at the substrate surface increases with plasma power, promoting vertical graphene growth and potentially increasing the processing temperature.30 Lower pressure helps to achieve higher electron mean free paths and higher electron temperatures, subsequently increasing the gas ionization rate.18\nThe carbon-containing active species ux at the surface promotes graphene growth.52 The graphene nucleus density decreases with an increased H2 content due to suppressed hydrogen etching, resulting in a smaller graphene grain size.53 A higher substrate temperature increases the temperature gradient and thermal stress, promoting the upward curling of graphene akes and subsequent vertical graphene growth.18,54 Finally, the deposition time is important because the growth of vertical graphene begins with planar graphene growth.54 Then, due to stress, ion bombardment, and lattice mismatch between the substrate and graphene, vertical graphene growth begins.18,21,55\nVia changing the gas ows, one can adjust the uxes of active species, controlling the graphene growth52 and etching53 processes. Therefore, the gas-ow effects were also studied for necessary control of the graphene structure.\nAn analysis of AFM images revealed that for graphene synthesized at a temperature of 900 C, a mixture of planar and vertical graphene was grown using plasma power in the range of 0.7\u20131.4 kW (Fig. S6\u2013S9\u2020). For all synthesized samples, graphene akes with a width of 70\u201390 nm, length of 300 nm, and height of up to 4 nm are seen (Fig. S6\u2013S9\u2020). An increase in the plasma power to 1.7 kW resulted in the growth of vertical graphene akes with a width of 60\u201380 nm (Fig. S5\u2020). At the same time, the I(G)/I(Si) ratio and Rq value signicantly increased (Fig. 5a and c). This can be explained because the electric eld strength and ion bombardment increased with an increase in the plasma power, promoting vertical graphene growth.30 In contrast, possible plasma-induced temperature increase effects are somewhat limited (see Fig. S3\u2020). At the same time, the I(2D)/I(G) ratio increased and the I(D)/I(G) ratio decreased with plasma power, indicating a lowering of the graphene layer number and defect density (Fig. 5e and g). The methane and hydrogen dissociation rates increase with plasma power.52 Thus, graphene etching by hydrogen prevailed over graphene growth, promoting increased C and CHx species densities.52,56 The decrease in defect density despite an increase in plasma power can be explained considering the prevailing defect types. For graphene synthesized using plasma power from 0.7 to 1.4 kW, boundary defects prevailed, and a further power increase resulted in the domination of boundary defects and vacancies (Fig. 5i). Thus, the I(D)/I(G) ratio decrease can be attributed to the increased graphene crystallite size. Increased ion irradiation can explain vacancy formation when using plasma power of 1.7 kW, as shown in numerous studies.57\u201362\n18764 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18759\u201318772\nDoubling the processing pressure did not inuence the graphene synthesized using a power of 1.7 kW (Fig. S4\u2020). However, we achieved some control of the graphene layer number, defect density, and defect type for samples grown at 700 C using power of 0.7 kW. Some on-site defects appeared along with boundary defects when the gas ows were increased (Fig. 5i). The presence of a more signicant number of hydrocarbon species with a lower dissociation degree can be supposed.63 Synthesis pressure doubling slightly decreased the defect density and increased the layer number (Fig. 5g and h, S4\u2020) due to the reduced gas ionization,18 resulting in lower ion etching and the formation of fewer radiative defects.\nThe synthesis temperature effects are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that no graphene was grown at 600 C. In the synthesis temperature range of 700\u2013900 C, the I(G)/I(Si) and I(2D)/I(G) ratios increased with temperature when using a power of 1.7 kW for synthesis (Fig. 6a and e). When using power of 0.7 kW, the lowest graphene layer number was obtained at 800 C. The graphene layer number changes are related to competition between decreased graphene etching by hydrogen53 and increased carbon atom desorption.64 The defect density slightly increased with temperature for graphene synthesized using power of 0.7 kW, while it non-monotonically depended on the temperature for graphene grown using power of 1.7 kW. The graphene Rq value increased with the synthesis temperature for all studied samples (Fig. 6c). The increased temperature promoted vertical graphene growth, activating the formation of non-planar graphene akes along with planar ones, and the coverage of the entire sample surface with vertical graphene akes occurred upon a further temperature increase (see Fig. S4, S13, S10, S14, S17, and S19\u2013 S22\u2020). This can be explained based on the presence of higher temperature gradients and thermal stress, which promote the upward curling of graphene akes and subsequent vertical graphene growth.18,54 The effects of temperature on the types of prevailing defects depended on the plasma power used for synthesis (Fig. 6i). For graphene synthesized using power of 1.7 kW, an increase in temperature resulted in the formation of vacancies along with boundary defects. Thus, additional thermal activation is necessary for ion-irradiation-induced vacancy formation.65\nThe I(G)/I(Si) ratio and surface roughness signicantly increased with the graphene synthesis time when a power of 1.7 kW and temperature of 900 C were used for synthesis (Fig. 6b and d). Aer 10min of growth, a planar and non-planar graphene mixture was formed. The I(G)/I(Si) ratio of that sample places it in group I, which mainly contains planar graphene. For the planar graphene areas, akes with a height of 0.2\u20130.8 nm and a width of 15\u201325 nm were observed, and for non-planar graphene, akes with a height of up to 5.5 nm and a width of 40\u201375 nm were seen (Fig. S22\u2020). A further increase in the deposition time resulted in the growth of vertical graphene (Fig. S5 and S18\u2013S20\u2020). This follows the vertical graphene growth mechanism suggested in ref. 54. At rst, planar graphene grows,54 and it is necessary for some time to elapse before vertical graphene growth begins due to thermal stress release.9,18,21,66 The I(2D)/I(G) ratio increased and the I(D)/I(G) ratio decreased with growth time for graphene deposited using power of 1.7 kW (Fig. 6f and h).

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nand chemical processes. Vertical graphene growth is promoted by two main processes (Fig. 8).\nThe temperature gradients and thermal stress increase with an increase in the synthesis temperature. At elevated temperatures, thermal stress is released by the partial detachment of graphene akes from the substrate and curling. Some time is necessary for stress accumulation when the critical temperature is reached. In addition, it seems that the diffusion of radicals to the tops of vertical graphene akes is more critical than the density of radicals on the surface.77 Another factor is ion bombardment and electric eld effects,77 which are enhanced with an increase in plasma power.30 Ion bombardment generates surface defects and CHx radicals.77 If radicals are adsorbed on a defected ake edge, they can diffuse along the edge with a low probability of evaporation or transition to a side surface. The nanoake sharp edges enhance the electric eld, intensifying reactions due to ion focusing.77 Without the activation of these mechanisms, planar graphene grows.77 A decrease in pressure promotes vertical graphene growth due to increased gas ionization.18 This is, again, more important than the CHx radical density on the surface.77 The growth of planar graphene due to increased methane ow shows that an increased hydrocarbon species ux promotes planar graphene growth.\nA decrease in the graphene layer number due to elevated temperature and a long synthesis time can be explained based on an increase in the carbon desorption rate with temperature.64 Thus, the vertical graphene akes were thinner than the planar ones in most cases. Defect density changes should be analyzed, considering the presence of different defects. Notably, in most samples, boundary defects dominated. In the planar graphene samples, on-site defects can be formed. A low synthesis temperature, low power, and elevated methane ux may benet their creation. Vacancies were found in samples containing vertical/planar graphene and vertical graphene. A combination of high power and increased temperature or a combination of low power with increased temperature and a longer growth time activated vacancy creation. Thus, carbon desorption and ion irradiation are essential processes.\nIn the case of planar graphene, n-type self-doping was revealed. This was explained based on charge transfer from the substrate. The growth of vertical graphene akes resulted in a decreased contact area between the graphene akes and the substrate. Therefore, charge transfer from the substrate was suppressed. In the case of vertical graphene, no doping or p-type doping was found. In this case, p-type doping can be explained based on an increased contact area between graphene and air, and more molecules can be adsorbed.\nIn conclusion, we were able to control the orientation of growing graphene akes via adjusting the technological deposition process conditions. High temperature, high plasma power, and a prolonged synthesis time promoted vertical graphene growth due to increased temperature gradients, thermal stress, ion bombardment, and elevated electric eld effects. Without these mechanisms, planar graphene grows at lower synthesis temperatures and lower plasma powers. The graphene layer number decreased with elevated temperatures and longer synthesis times because the carbon desorption rate increased\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 18759\u201318772 | 18767\nFig. 8 The dependence of the synthesized graphene flake orientation on the synthesis conditions.

In most samples, boundary defects prevailed. A low synthesis temperature, low power, and elevated methane gas ow were benecial for the formation of some on-site defects. Vacancy creation was activated by high plasma power, an increased growth temperature, and a shorter synthesis time. Substrate-based charge transfer resulted in planar graphene ntype self-doping. In the case of vertical graphene, no doping or p-type doping was found. The adsorption of moremolecules can explain this, due to the increased contact area between graphene and air.\nAuthor contributions\nS\u030c.
