1. **Investigate the impact of patient expectations on the quality of life after prostate cancer surgery.** This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with patients to understand their expectations before and after surgery, and then comparing these expectations to their actual experiences. This information could be used to develop more realistic expectations for patients and to improve the quality of care.


2. **Examine the relationship between surgical technique and the occurrence of complications after prostate cancer surgery.** This could involve conducting a prospective study to compare the rates of complications in patients who undergo different surgical techniques, such as open radical prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. This information could be used to identify the surgical techniques that are associated with the lowest risk of complications.


3. **Develop new methods for preserving erectile function after prostate cancer surgery.** This could involve investigating the use of new surgical techniques, such as nerve-sparing surgery, or the use of medications or other therapies to improve erectile function after surgery. This research could lead to new treatments that can help patients maintain their sexual function after prostate cancer surgery.


4. **Evaluate the long-term impact of prostate cancer surgery on quality of life.** This could involve conducting a longitudinal study to follow patients for several years after surgery to assess their quality of life. This information could be used to identify the factors that are associated with a good quality of life after prostate cancer surgery and to develop interventions to improve the quality of life of patients who are struggling.


5. **Explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the outcomes of prostate cancer surgery.** This could involve developing AI algorithms to predict the risk of complications after surgery, to identify patients who are at high risk of developing erectile dysfunction, or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients. This research could lead to new tools that can help surgeons to improve the outcomes of prostate cancer surgery.
