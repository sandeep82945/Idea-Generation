1. **Investigate the impact of taxation and consumer guidance on the supervision of elderly care services.** This could be done by developing a more comprehensive model that includes these additional regulatory tools. The model could then be used to simulate different scenarios and analyze the impact of different policy combinations on the behavior of private elderly care institutions, local governments, and the public.


2. **Examine the cross effects of various regulatory tools on the supervision of elderly care services.** This could be done by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the model developed in the paper. The sensitivity analysis could be used to determine how the results of the model change when the values of the different parameters are varied. This information could then be used to identify the most effective combinations of regulatory tools for different situations.


3. **Explore the role of technology in the supervision of elderly care services.** This could be done by developing a model that incorporates the use of technology, such as sensors and data analytics, to monitor the quality of care provided by private elderly care institutions. The model could then be used to simulate different scenarios and analyze the impact of different technology-based interventions on the behavior of private elderly care institutions, local governments, and the public.


4. **Investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the supervision of elderly care services.** This could be done by collecting data on the quality of care provided by private elderly care institutions during the pandemic and comparing it to data from before the pandemic. The data could then be used to identify the factors that contributed to any changes in the quality of care and to develop recommendations for how to improve the supervision of elderly care services during future pandemics.


5. **Conduct a longitudinal study of the supervision of elderly care services.** This could be done by collecting data on the quality of care provided by private elderly care institutions over a period of time. The data could then be used to identify trends in the quality of care and to assess the effectiveness of different regulatory interventions.
