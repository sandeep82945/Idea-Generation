            "text": "Graphene oxide (GO) is a bidimensional nanomaterial obtained from exfoliation and oxidation of graphite, a process which results in mixed sp2 and sp3 areas, with an irregular presence of oxygenated functional groups (OFG).1\u20133 In particular, both hydroxyl and epoxide groups are mainly localized in the basal plane of the layer, differently to the less abundant carboxylfunctionalities, which are distributed at the edges.4,5\nThe growing popularity of GO as a unique substrate in a wide range of applications, from biomedicine to electronics, can be traced back to its versatility in terms of lateral dimensions, chemical groups, structural defectivity, and extent of chemical/ physical treatments leading to reduced GO (RGO).6\u20138 GO is a temperature-sensitive nanomaterial, whose structure can be altered up to a reductive process by means of extensive thermal treatments as several studies have already demonstrated.

A phase transformation of GO was rst reported by Kumar et al., showing a transition of mixed sp2\u2013sp3 hybridized domains into distinct oxidized and graphitic phases, with preservation of oxygen functionalities and large improvements in the optical and electronic properties of the annealed GO.11 This phase transformation of GO triggered by temperature and already reported in other works is known as \u201coxygen clustering\u201d.11\u201313 The possible reason for such preservation upon mild annealing, notwithstanding a gradual decrease of chemically bonded oxygen atoms found on explored graphene membranes, was assigned by Zhu et al. to the strongly physisorbed oxygen species trapped within the GO lattice.14 Furthermore, Foller et al. reported evidence by TEM measurements of a size enhancement of graphitic domains from \u223c40 nm2 to >200 nm2, evidenced from high and low contrast regions, respectively interpreted as disordered areas with oxygen functionalities and ordered areas of graphitic domains.

They reported signicant transformation among diverse oxygen functionalities in addition to phase separation, concluding that a slight reduction of GO occurs.14 Moreover, the oxygen clustering of GO for the interaction with biomolecules was also exploited by Chen et al. who investigated the effect of the temperature on the structure of GO and in particular on a GO-coated glass substrate heated in an oven at 90 \u00b0C for 9 days. As proved by XPS analyses, in the reported experimental conditions, the extent of the p-conjugated domains increases whilst the oxygen content and the morphology, investigated by means of SEM and AFM microscopies, remain almost the same, compared to the starting GO material.12 Finally, Singh et al. have demonstrated very recently that heat treatment of GO at 200 \u00b0C is the most effective option for developing a porous structure.16\nIn this contest, the present study focuses on the modications undergone by GO upon thermal treatment of its aqueous dispersions conducted at 50 \u00b0C up to 168 h and at 80 \u00b0C up to 48 h. These temperatures were chosen to investigate the mild thermal annealing of GO that takes place in an aqueous acidic medium, where the presence of the dispersing medium could have a role in the dynamic evolution of the GO structure. Mild thermal annealing of GO was followed by an ample set of experimental techniques, namely XPS, cyclic voltammetry and Raman spectroscopy, combined with DFT modeling. In particular, the time evolution of hydroxyl and epoxide groups was monitored, demonstrating that even at these relatively low temperatures chemical transformations occur on the GO plane, with a critical role exerted by water molecules."

This feature can be tentatively associated to water reduction in an initial adsorptive stage on GO, with water molecules probably intercalated or Hbound to the GO layers.22\u201325 Since the intensity of this feature is strongly dependent on the adsorbed water amount, which can sensibly vary among different samples, its voltammetric response can hardly be correlated to the experimental conditions, therefore it will not be commented further in the text.\nStepping to the GO-50-24 sample (red curve, Fig. 1), which underwent thermal annealing in water for 24 h, a shape modication of the voltammetric response can be seen. Component I decreases its intensity, together with a parallel increase of component III, which becomes broader and extends to more negative potentials, gaining intensity towards component IV. Upon extension of the thermal annealing time, samples GO-5048 and GO-50-168 (blue and green curves in Fig. 1, respectively) present only slight variations on the position and intensity of component I, whereas features II and III appear depressed compared to GO-50-24, yet maintaining a signicant intensity in the range between \u22121.25 and \u22121.4 V, prior to component IV. An intermediate annealing time between 48 and 168 h (96 h) was also investigated with CV, but no signicant difference was found with the GO-50-48 sample (see Fig. S1\u2020).\nAer thermal annealing selected samples were investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), with particular attention to the C 1s ionization region, which is diagnostic of the chemically inequivalent carbon species present within the GO nanosheets. The raw C 1s XPS spectra (dots in Fig. 2), are composed by a low energy feature peaked at 284.8 eV binding\n29310 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29308\u201329315\nenergy (BE) related to unoxidized C atoms, and a component tailed towards higher BE accounting for oxygenated carbon moieties around 287 eV. This second main feature appears to decrease from pristine GO to the GO-50-168 sample. Since the nanoscale structure of GO is intrinsically chemically heterogeneous, mainly consisting of graphitic islands embedded within highly disordered oxidized areas,26 it is very likely that the above mentioned C 1s features represent an envelope of more specic chemically shied contributions, which, therefore, require a curve-tting analysis for their unravelling. To this aim, the curve-tting results for the C 1s XPS regions are reported in Fig. 2a\u2013d for each thermally annealed sample, together with the pristine GO. This latter (Fig. 2a) can be tted to a unique component at 284.85 eV BE, associated to the aromatic C]C network (blue curve, Fig. 2), plus a multiplicity of components in the oxidized area.20,27,28 This region can be tted to several components, according to the expected oxygenated functional groups in GO. In fact, it is well known that the main functionalities appended to the basal plane of GO are epoxy and hydroxyl groups, while carboxylic, carboxylate, carbonyl (ketones, quinones), phenol, ester and lactone groups decorate edges and defects of the nanosheets.29 Therefore, the proposed curvetting involves all the expected functional groups (see Fig. 2 with assignments and Table 1 for quantitative details), as we already reported elsewhere.17,18,27 The rst two contributions to\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The former can be assigned to carbonyl (ketones, quinones) and carboxylate and the latter to carboxyl (esters, lactones, carboxylic acids) groups.17\nAs reported in Table 1, the percent contribution of each carbon species in GO can be extracted from the area of each component resulting from the curve-tting. The main outcome of this evaluation is that the contribution from C\u2013OH groups increases upon thermal annealing at 50 \u00b0C, and it is paralleled by an almost equivalent decrease in the epoxide concentration. In order to evidence this nding, the variations in percent area related to C\u2013OH and epoxide C atoms in all annealed samples with respect to the pristine GO-0 sample were determined as DGO-0 values and listed in Table 1. These differences show that, to a fair approximation, for each epoxide C atom disappearing, a corresponding hydroxylated C atom is formed, strongly suggesting that thermal treatment in these conditions leads to a transformation of a fraction of epoxide groups into vicinal diols. Furthermore, this hypothesized transformation would increase the number of O atoms bound to GO, which nicely matches the trend of O/C ratio (RO/C) reported in Table 1 (see ESI\u2020 for further details on the O/C evaluation). The increase in RO/C supports the chemical evolution of epoxide groups into vicinal diols, suggesting that this reaction might possibly be exerted by water molecules through an epoxide ring-opening path (see the Theoretical modeling section).\nAs to the trend of variations in intensity of the various chemical components among the different samples, one can see that RO/C slightly increases up to GO-50-24 (RO/C = 0.49), apparently due to an enrichment in C\u2013OH groups. On the other hand, upon extending the duration of thermal annealing up to 168 h, a drop in RO/C is detected, probably due to a more pronounced elimination of epoxide groups. This latter decrease of epoxide at 168 h is also accompanied by a relevant increase in the percent intensity of C]C functions (50.9%), calling for a partial restoration of C sp2 network.\nThe XPS ndings are consistent with the results from the cyclic voltammetry, where, upon passing from pristine GO-0 to\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthermally treated samples, a displacement of intensity from the epoxide reduction wave (I) to the hydroxyl one (III) is detected, with an increase in current signal between feature III and IV, which may account for the freshly generated diol groups and the increased O/C ratio determined by XPS."

Two main differences can further be seen in these CVs with respect to those related to GO-50 samples. The rst is a potential shi to less negative values of both features I and III, which respectively move of \u22120.04 and \u22120.06 V in the GO-80-2 sample compared to pristine GO, and of further \u22120.015 and\n\u22120.03 V in the GO-80-8 sample. In the samples annealed for longer times, i.e., GO-80-24 and GO-80-48, feature III becomes smoother and broader, while feature I is still detectable and is found to further shi down to \u22120.78 V in GO-80-48 (green curve in Fig. 3). This potential backshi of the voltammetric reduction features of GO was already recently detected by us in samples treated with mild chemical reducing agents,27 and associated to an extension of C sp2 islands or to their coalescence into larger and interconnected domains, with a consequent increase in electron affinity and conductivity. The mild thermal treatment at 80 \u00b0C is therefore also found to modify the overall electronic properties of GO, and eventually facilitate the electrochemical reduction of its oxygenated functional groups.27\nAnother difference between the GO-50 and GO-80 CV datasets is the absence in these latter samples of a current signal in the potential range between features III and IV, which remains very similar in all samples to pristine GO.\nThe C 1s XPS spectra of GO-80 samples are reported in Fig. 4, with the corresponding curve tting results and a comparison with pristine GO.\nIn this set of samples, the contributions from the various chemically inequivalent C atoms in GO can also be found, and, similarly to the GO-50 samples, upon heating a decrease in the epoxide contribution (green curve) is detected, parallel to an increase in the C\u2013OH signal (magenta curve). On the other hand, as reported in Table 2, the DGO-0 values related to C\u2013O\u2013C (epoxide) groups in each of the GO-80 samples are found to be roughly twice as those related to C\u2013OH. Considering that the contribution of epoxide C atoms to the XPS signal is double compared to that coming from hydroxylated C atoms, this relative variation points at the formation of a single C\u2013OH group aer the ring opening of an epoxide group. According to this hypothesis, the number of O atoms in GO is expected to be maintained constant, in accord, within the \u00b110% associated error with the RO/C values computed for these samples, which vary in a narrow range between 0.39 and 0.43 (Table 2).\nAs to the variations among the different GO-80 samples, the effect of longer annealing times seems to increase the extent of the conversion of epoxide groups into C\u2013OH, with the deepest DGO-0 variations found in the GO-80-48 sample.\nfunctional groups at the surface of GO samples annealed at 80 \u00b0C in ther with DGO-0 values for C\u2013OH and C\u2013O\u2013C groups c\nFig. 5 Raman spectra of the D and G regions of the GO samples annealed at (a) 50 \u00b0C and (b) 80 \u00b0C for the reported time intervals.

At the same time, the increased percent area related to the C]C signal (Table 2) in GO-80 samples compared to pristine GO supports the enhanced electron affinity experienced by all GO-80 samples, and resulting in the potential backshi of the voltammetric features (Fig. 3). Overall, these results are compatible with a reaction path reported by Kim et al.10 In this case, temperature affects the mobility of basal C\u2013H groups, which are required for an intramolecular redox process occurring with a vicinal hydroxyl group (see the Theoretical modeling section). Therefore, we hypothesize that at 80 \u00b0C a C\u2013H group migrates in close vicinity to a C\u2013OH moiety. These two groups condense together, restoring a C]C bond with a loss of a water molecule (see Fig. 6b). The proposed path is compatible with both the increasing of the C]C XPS signal and the DGO-0 values found for the epoxide and the hydroxyl groups (Table 2).\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It is evident, from visual inspection of Fig. 5a and b, that already aer 24 h of thermal treatment at both 50 and 80 \u00b0C a structural modication occurs on the pristine GO material.\nThe Raman spectrum of pristine GO displays the D and G bands localized at \u223c1354 cm\u22121 and \u223c1598 cm\u22121, respectively.5,21,26,30 The ratio ID/IG increases from 0.71 in pristine GO to 0.87 in the GO-50-24 sample (Fig. 5a, red curve), indicating a partial introduction of surface defects in the basal plane of GO, probably due to chemical transformations initiated by water molecules, as pointed out by both CV and XPS analyses. Furthermore, the spectrum of GO-50-24 is markedly comparable to that of GO-50-168 (Fig. 5a, blue curve), suggesting a negligible structural evolution of the GO layers despite the prolonged time of thermal treatment. The same trend of variation can be found in the GO-80 samples (Fig. 5b), where a closely comparable increase of the ID/IG ratio is observed aer 24 h (ID/IG = 0.86, Fig. 5b, red curve), and is maintained constant up to 48 h (Fig. 5b, blue curve).

It is worth noting that, since the oxygen content aer thermal treatments for both GO-50 and GO-80 series presents changes which are not sizeable (see O/C ratios in Tables 1 and 2), the observed modications of the Raman spectra as a consequence of the mild annealing process are most likely related to morphological changes due to clustering processes13 rather than to a variation in the oxygen content.\nAccording to the ID/IG values found, the mean distance among defects in the graphene layer, LD, can be approximated to decrease from \u223c12 nm in GO to \u223c9 nm on passing from GO0 to GO-50 and GO-80 samples.31,32"

GO wasmodelled within a cluster approach using a B3LYP hybrid functional and a triple basis set plus polarization (6-311g**). See ESI\u2020 for computational details. At 50 \u00b0C, water molecules, approaching the GO basal epoxide groups, can promote the epoxy ring opening and, in turn, the formation of vicinal diols species (Fig. 6a). In fact, the corresponding process is computed to be isoergonic (DG = 1.8 kcal mol\u22121), but the huge amount of solvent water molecules around the GO sheets suggests that the equilibrium is strongly shied toward the formation of diols.\nAt 80 \u00b0C (Fig. 6b), temperature can activate the proton migration toward the vicinal hydroxyl groups on the GO basal plane. This step requires about 40 kcal mol\u22121 to occur. Once the hydroxyl and the proton are close enough, a proton transfer process leads to the formation of a new C]C double bond with the elimination of water. This step requires 30 kcal mol\u22121 to occur and it is strongly exorgonic (DG = \u221225.8 kcal mol\u22121). As a matter of fact, heating at 50 \u00b0C promotes an equilibrium process pushed to products formation by an excess of reactant, while at 80 \u00b0C a GO reduction path is activated, kinetically driven by the proton migration upon the GO surface."

            "text": "In this work, the mild thermal annealing of GO dispersions in water has been investigated. The layers annealed at 50 \u00b0C display an increased O concentration correlated to a transformation of the epoxide functional groups into vicinal diols, as revealed by the combined characterization through XPS and cyclic voltammetry. This reaction is most likely the consequence of a near-equilibrium epoxide-rings aperture exerted by water molecules shied toward the formation of diols (Fig. 6a). The longest duration of thermal treatment, 168 h, leads to a partial reduction of GO owing to the prominent depletion of epoxide groups and an increase of C]C up to about 50.9%, as proved by XPS analyses. Conversely, in the samples heated at 80 \u00b0C, the XPS spectra clearly show that an epoxide-to-hydroxyl conversion occurs, but with an O concentration maintained constant with respect to pristine GO. Cyclic voltammetry is coherent with this\n29314 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29308\u201329315\npicture within the rst hours of thermal annealing, wherein an intensity gain is detected in the reduction wave assigned to hydroxyl groups at the expenses of that related to epoxide groups. These ndings call for a reaction path at T = 80 \u00b0C where a further step is added compared to the lower T case. In this case, the higher T enhances the mobility of C\u2013H groups throughout the GO basal plane, eventually driving the thermodynamically favoured restoration of a C]C bond via loss of water and leaving a single hydroxyl group on the layer. All these modications in the chemical composition of oxygen-based functional groups were also supported by Raman analyses, which revealed that the main modication to the D and G band lineshape and intensity occurs in the rst hours of the annealing treatment. Overall, these experimental results shed light on the chemical transformations that occur on GO at mild temperatures, with a specic signicance assigned to the role of water molecules. Particular attention and accuracy should then be taken when GO is handled in aqueous media at high temperatures."
