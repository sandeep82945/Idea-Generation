Pancreatic \u03b2 cells are thought to be critical cells involved in the progression of T1DM, and their injury would directly lead to impaired insulin secretion.\nPurpose: To investigate the protective effects of allicin on pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury and elucidate the underlying mechanism.\nMethods: The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse T1DM model in vivo and STZinduced pancreatic \u03b2 cell Min6 model in vitro were used to explore the effects of allicin on T1DM. The experiments include fasting blood glucose test, oral glucose tolerance detection, HE staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, western blot, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and flow cytometry.\nResults: Allicin could significantly decrease blood glucose level, improve islet structure and insulin expression, and inhibit apoptosis to reduce STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury and loss through activating AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway.\nConclusion: Allicin treatment significantly reduced STZ-induced T1DM progression, suggesting that allicin may be a potential therapy option for T1DM patients.\nKEYWORDS\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), allicin, pancreatic \u03b2 cells, autophagy, AMPK/mTOR pathway\nIntroduction\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency caused by autoimmune-mediated pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury and loss. It is a chronic disease that causes hyperglycemia and is accompanied by polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, weight loss, headache, abdominal symptoms, ketoacidosis, and other symptoms (Group, 2004; Atkinson et al., 2014;"

According to the International Diabetes Federation, 8.8% of people worldwide have diabetes and 10%\u201315% of them are subjected to T1DM (Zinman, 2015). Long-term high blood glucose levels can cause microvascular complications including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and subsequently cause a huge social and economic burden (Katsarou et al., 2017). At present, the clinical management of T1DM patients mainly focuses on intensive insulin therapy, with the purpose of keeping the blood glucose level as close to the normal as possible, improving the level of glycosylated hemoglobin and reducing complications (Nathan and Group, 2014). However, there are still certain limitations for insulin therapy. So it is extremely urgent to seekmore effective drugs or approaches for T1DM treatment.\nAutophagy, the type II form of programmed cell death, is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved process. The denatured or aged proteins and defective organelles are brought into lysosomes for degradation and play a crucial role in cell homeostasis (Lai et al., 2017). Previous studies have shown that the apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells is an important part of the pathogenesis of T1DM (Kim et al., 1999), and autophagy may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis and the development of multiple stages of T1DM (Degenhardt et al., 2006; Vaquero et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2008). It is well-known that autophagy can be regulated bymultiple signaling pathways and effector factors (Cheng et al., 2017). The accumulated evidence suggested that mTOR is a core regulator of autophagy (Zhai et al., 2018). It has been reported that cPKC\u03b3 deficiency can exacerbate autophagy damage and hyperphosphorylation accumulation of tau protein through AMPK/mTOR pathway, thereby improving neurocognitive impairment in T1DM (Zheng et al., 2022). T1DM management could be improved through regulating mTORC/TFEB/ calcineurin axis pathway to promote lysosome production (Pan et al., 2020). Therefore, we speculated that AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway might be an important strategic target for T1DM treatment.\nGarlic is one of the world\u2019s common vegetables, and is used not only in cooking but also in traditional and modern medicine due to its medicinal properties, such as anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, antiinflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, and antiimmunomodulatory activities (Capasso, 2013; Borlinghaus et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2019). The medicinal value of garlic for diabetes has attracted the attention of researchers. Allicin, as the main bioactive substance (Hayat et al., 2016), is produced by allinase conversion of allicine when garlic cloves are crushed. Allicin is absorbed efficiently, although part of it is metabolized as a rapidly absorbed intermediate, and Allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) is the main breath metabolite of allicin (Lawson and Hunsaker, 2018). Allicin is hydrophobic and can efficiently cross cell membranes without membrane leakage, fusion or aggregation (Nadeem et al., 2021). It enhances the effect of intracellular action (Miron et al., 2000). Recently, it has been suggested that allicin could reduce pathological cardiac hypertrophy through the autophagy pathway (Ba et al., 2019). Allicin has also been reported to attenuate oxidative stress induced by advanced oxidative protein products and mitochondrial apoptosis in human nucleus pulposus cells, thereby improving disc degeneration (Xiang et al., 2020). So far, there has been no report of allicin improving pancreatic \u03b2 cells in T1DM patients. Therefore, we would try to investigate the protective effects of allicin on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse T1DM model in vivo and STZ-induced mouse pancreatic \u03b2 cell line (Min6) model in vitro, and illustrate the underlying mechanism."

Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 180 mg/kg STZ in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer. STZ solution was prepared immediately in dark place before use. After 6 h of drug injection, mice were temporarily fed with 10% glucose solution instead of clear water for 12 h to avoid death caused by transient hypoglycemia. After 3 days of drug injection, the fasting blood glucose was measured in each mouse. When the value of fasting blood glucose was greater than 15 mM, these mice were labeled as T1DM for subsequent experiments. Regarding the doses setting of allicin, one previous report showed that the mice received oral treatment with allicin (10 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks to study the allicin of improving atherosclerosis (Panyod et al., 2022). In addition, the other previous report showed that the mice received oral treatment with allicin (30 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks to study the allicin of improving the inflammation of diabetic great vessels (Li et al., 2020). Based on these studies, we set the low-dose allicin (10 mg/kg/d) and high-dose allicin (30 mg/kg/d) to treat T1DM mice in this study. The control group was intragastrically administered with an equal volume of clear water. T1DM mice were then received vehicle, Allicin(L) (10 mg/kg) or Allicin(H) (30 mg/kg) by gavage once daily for 6 weeks. Mice were divided into control group (n = 10), T1DM group (n = 10), T1DM + Allicin(L) group (n = 10), and T1DM + Allicin(H) group (n = 10). The fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured and recorded weekly. Finally, the serum samples were collected via orbital blood sampling and the pancreatic tissues were isolated for subsequent experiments.\nFasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test\nAfter 12 h of fasting, the blood samples were collected from the tail vein of mice in each group, and blood glucose was measured by glucose meter. In brief, the level of blood glucose in each group after gavage administration with 10% glucose solution (1.0 g/kg) (Li et al., 2008) was measured at different time points, such as 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Then, OGTT was performed at 1, 3, and 5 weeks after treatment."

Hyperglycemia is an important character of T1DM. To investigate the effects of allicin on STZ-induced T1DM, the levels of fasting blood glucose in different groups were measured weekly for 6 weeks. The results showed that the level of\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04\nblood glucose in control group was stabilized at < 15mM, and the level of blood glucose in T1DM group was increased gradually at \u2265 15 mM over time and reached the highest on day 35.

Allicin (H) administration could significantly reduce blood glucose level from day 35\u201342 in STZ-induced T1DMmice (Figure 1B).

Allicin (H) treatment could partially inhibit the decrease of body weight in STZ-induced T1DM mice, but had no significant difference comparedwith T1DMgroup (Figure 1C). In addition, the results ofOGTT showed that the blood glucose levels from 0 to 120 min at week 1, 3, and 5 in T1DM group were higher than that of control group, and the quantitative data of OGTT displayed that glucose tolerance was significantly impaired compared with control group. Both Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) treatments could improve glucose tolerances at week 1, 3, and 5 in STZ-induced T1DM mice, but had no significant differences compared with T1DM group except for week 5 (Figures 1D\u2013I). These results suggested that allicin could improve hyperglycemia of STZ-induced T1DM mice.\nAllicin improved the islet morphology and pancreatic \u03b2 cell function in T1DM mice\nHE staining was performed to assess the changes of pathological morphological structure of pancreatic islet tissues in each group. The result showed that the morphology of islet in control group was normal, having tight arrangement, abundant cytoplasm, and clear nucleolus of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. However, the islet in T1DM group was small and disordered with inconspicuous boundary, irregular shape, vacuolated degeneration, and cytolysis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Both Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) treatments could partially rescue the impaired islet morphology of STZ-induced T1DM mice, and Allicin (H) had the best effects (Figure 2A). Meanwhile, the level of serum insulin in T1DM group was significantly decreased compared with control\ngroup, and Allicin (L) or Allicin (H) administration could recover the serum insulin level in STZ-induced T1DM mice, while Allicin (L) treatment had no significant difference compared with T1DM group (Figure 2B). In addition, the result of immumohistochemical staining of INSULIN was almost consistent with HE staining (Figure 2C). The quantitative result showed that, compared with T1DM group, Allicin (H) administration could significantly increase the expression of INSULIN in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 2D).\nMoreover, western blot was used to detect the expression of INSULIN protein in different groups (Figure 3A), and the quantitative result was consistent with the above serum insulin result (Figure 3B). The results of RT-qPCR showed that the levels of islet function-related genes, such as Ins1, Glut2, and Pdx1 were significantly lowered compared with control group, and Allicin (L) or Allicin (H) administration could significantly up-regulate these gene levels in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 3C). These data suggested that allicin could improve the islet morphology and pancreatic \u03b2 cell function for insulin production in STZ-induced T1DM mice.\nAllicin activated the AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway in T1DM mice\nPrevious studies had demonstrated that autophagy could be involved in T1DM (Gonzalez et al., 2011; Darwish et al., 2021). AMPK acts as an upstream factor of mTOR, which can participate in the regulation of autophagy, and AMPK activation has an antagonistic effect on mTOR (Zhai et al., 2018). Therefore, the\nFIGURE 2 Allicin attenuated the islet structure and function in T1DM mice. (A) Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining of pancreatic sections in each group.

The results showed that the levels of autophagy-related proteins, such as LC3-II/I, BECLIN-1, P62 as well as p-AMPK/AMPK were down-regulated and p-mTOR/mTOR was up-regulated in T1DM group compared with control group. Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) treatments could almost reverse this trend in T1DM mice (Figure 3E). These results suggested that allicin might protect pancreatic \u03b2 cells of STZ-induced T1DM mice through activating the AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org07\nAllicin attenuated the apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells in T1DM mice\nPancreatic \u03b2 cells, as the most important component in islet tissues, are the only functional cells for insulin secretion in vivo. Homeostasis of the number and the function of pancreatic \u03b2 cells are really essential for blood glucose regulation. The apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells is considered to be an important cause for the development of T1DM (Kim et al., 1999). The TUNEL combined with INSULIN co-staining were performed to detect the apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 4A). The results showed that the INSULIN-positive cells almost disappeared, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in T1DM group compared with control group. Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) treatments could increase the number of INSULIN-positive\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08\ncells (Figure 4B) and decrease the number of TUNEL-positive cells in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 4C). In addition, the results of RTqPCR showed that compared with control group, the expression of apoptosis gene Bax was up-regulated and the level of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2 was down-regulated in T1DM group. Both Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) could significantly reverse this trend in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 4D). Moreover, the expressions of apoptosis protein BAX and anti-apoptosis BCL-2 were detected by western blot (Figure 4E). The quantitative results showed that the apoptosis protein BAX was significantly up-regulated, and the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 as well as the level of BCL-2/BAX were significantly down-regulated in T1DM group compared with control group. Allicin (L) and Allicin (H) treatments could significantly reverse this trend, except that BCL-2 in Allicin (L) had no statistical significance in STZ-induced T1DM mice (Figure 4F). These results suggested that allicin could ameliorate pancreatic \u03b2 cell apoptosis in T1DM mice.\nDetect the optimal working concentrations of STZ and allicin on pancreatic \u03b2 cells\nWe employed STZ to induceMin6 tomimic type 1 diabetic condition in vitro. Initially, we set different concentrations of STZ ranging from 0 to 0.8 mM to treat Min6. The results of CCK-8 revealed that the concentrations of STZ at 0.4 mM could greatly restrain the cell\nviability of Min6 (Supplementary Figure S1A). Therefore, the following working concentration of STZ was set at 0.4 mM to induce Min6 to establish T1DM cell model in vitro. In addition, we set diverse concentrations of allicin ranging from 5 to 20 ng/mL to treat STZ-induced Min6. The results of CCK-8 showed that the concentrations of allicin at 10 ng/mL could greatly improve the cell viability of STZ induced Min6 (Supplementary Figure S1B). So, we selected 10 ng/mL as the following working concentration of allicin to treat Min6.\nAllicin improved pancreatic \u03b2 cell function in vitro\nTo assess the protective function of allicin on STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell Min6 in vitro, the cell culture supernatants in different groups were harvested for insulin level measurement using ELISA. The results showed that the level of insulin in T1DM group was significantly lower than that of control group. After allicin treatment, the level of insulin was significantly increased in STZinduced Min6, which could be markedly reversed by AMPK inhibitor CC (Figure 5A). In addition, we detected insulin gene or protein expression in each group by western blot (Figure 5B) and RT-qPCR, and the results were consistent with the above ELISA data (Figures 5C,D). These results further suggested that allicin could resume the insulin secretion of STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell Min6.\nFIGURE 5 Allicin improved the insulin secretion function of STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell Min6 in vitro.

The result of TUNEL staining showed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly increased in T1DM group compared with control group. Allicin treatment could significantly decrease TUNEL-positive cells in STZ-induced Min6, and AMPK inhibitor CC could abolish the effect of allicin (Figure 6B). Meanwhile, the RT-qPCR result showed that the level of apoptosis gene Bax was up-regulated and the expression of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2was down-regulated in T1DMgroup, and allicin treatment could reverse this trend in STZ-induced Min6, while AMPK inhibitor CC could abrogate the effect of allicin (Figure 6C). In addition, the expression of apoptosis protein BAX and anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 in each group was detected by western blot (Figure 6D), and the quantitative result was almost consistent with the above RT-qPCR result (Figure 6E). Moreover, the flow cytometry of Annexin V-PI assay was used to detect the cell apoptosis in each group (Figure 6F). The percentages of apoptosis cells are calculated from the early apoptosis (Q1-LR) and late apoptosis (Q1-UR). The quantitative results were consistent with the above TUNEL staining results (Figure 6G). These data further suggested that allicin could ameliorate STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell apoptosis.\nAllicin protected pancreatic \u03b2 cells in vitro through activating AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway\nTo further explore the potential protective mechanism of allicin on pancreatic \u03b2 cells, western blot was used to detect the AMPK/mTOR-\nmediated autophagy pathway to assess the protective effects of allicin on pancreatic \u03b2 cells in STZ-induced Min6 in vitro (Figure 7A). The results of western blot showed that the levels of p-AMPK/AMPK, LC3II/I, BECLIN-1, and P62 were significantly down-regulated and p-mTOR/mTOR was observably up-regulated in T1DM group compared with control group. Allicin administration could reverse this trend in STZ-induced Min6, but AMPK inhibitor CC could abolish the effect of allicin (Figure 7B). In addition, the immunofluorescence staining of LC3 (Supplementary Figure S2A) and P62 (Supplementary Figure S2C) were conducted in different groups, and the quantitative results show that the trend of LC3 (Supplementary Figure S2B) and P62 (Supplementary Figure S2D) expressions was consistent with western blot results. Based on the above data, we could speculate that allicin might play the protective roles on pancreatic \u03b2 cells of STZ-induced T1DM through activating the AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy pathway. The detailed mechanism diagram is shown in Figure 8."

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a medical problem that imposes a huge economic burden on society worldwide. T1DM occurs frequently in adolescents, which is characterized by high blood glucose levels, and is an autoimmune-mediated chronic disease. The etiology of T1DM is very complex, involving the autoantibody targeting the islets of Langerhans (Krischer et al., 2015), genetics (Tuomilehto, 2013), and environmental factors (Ashton et al., 2016; Hyoty, 2016). All of those factors eventually lead to an absolute lack of insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2 cells and make the treatment options very scarce. Insulin injection is currently the only way to treat T1DM. However, this therapy has some limitations and can cause complications, such as fatal hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and a\nFIGURE 7 Allicin mediated pancreatic \u03b2 cell Min6 autophagy through activating AMPK/mTOR in vitro.

Therefore, it is particularly necessary to develop more therapy drugs.\nThe use of natural extracts from plants in regulating the blood sugar and lipid levels and preventing diabetes complications has attracted much attention. Allicin, a sulfur-containing compound with strong biological activity in garlic, has the therapeutic effects on diabetic nephropathy, diabetic wound healing, and other diseases (Osman et al., 2012; Arellano Buendia et al., 2018; Toygar et al., 2020). In the present study, we investigated the effects of allicin on T1DM, and further revealed the underlying mechanism.\nPancreatic \u03b2 cells are involved in the progression of T1DM, so the therapy targeting pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury is an ideal strategy for T1DM treatment and its complications. STZ, a spectral antibiotic that contains a highly active methyl-nitrourea part in its structure, is a classical T1DM modeling drug (Lenzen, 2008), which can bind to glucose molecules and play cytotoxic effects (Vavra et al., 1959). Therefore, in this study, we established the STZ-induced mouse\nmodel in vivo and STZ-induced Min6 cell model in vitro to explore the effects of allicin on T1DM. The results showed that the fasting blood glucose level of T1DM mice always indicated hyperglycemia, while the high dose allicin could significantly decrease the fasting blood glucose level in STZ-induced T1DM mice after 6 weeks of continuous treatment. In addition, in order to understand the carbohydrate loading capacity, as well as the changes of dynamic blood glucose levels and the numbers of pancreatic \u03b2 cells in islets, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting insulin detection were performed. The results showed that allicin could significantly improve the oral glucose tolerance and fasting insulin secretion in week five and week six in STZ-induced T1DM mice. These findings suggested that allicin has certain therapeutic effects on T1DM.\nHuman pancreatic \u03b2 cells are the only insulin-producing cells in the body and play a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. Theoretically, the number of pancreatic \u03b2 cells is kept constant, but the\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12\nrecent evidence documented that the number of pancreatic \u03b2 cells was dynamically regulated to change throughout life (Ding et al., 2013). Autophagy can be involved in glucose metabolism diseases, and the recent study showed that cannabinoid could play an antiinflammatory role to treat type 1 diabetes through autophagy pathways (Liu et al., 2021). The cPKC\u03b3 knock-out could alleviate the cognitive dysfunction caused by type 1 diabetes through AMPK/ mTOR mediated autophagy pathway (Zheng et al., 2022). We suspected that the therapy focused on potential cytoprotective effects of autophagy in diabetes might be a promising solution. Autophagy-lysosome pathway, a conserved proteolytic mechanism, is that the damaged or dysfunctional intracellular cytoplasmic components are transported into lysosomes for breakdown (Yang and Klionsky, 2010; Mihalache and Simon, 2012; Wirawan et al., 2012). LC3 is an autophagy biomarker that plays an important role in the formation of autophagosomes (Notte et al., 2011). When autophagy is formed, the cytosolic-type LC3 (LC3-I) will decompose a small piece of polypeptide to transform into autophagosome membrane-type LC3 (LC3-II), and the ratio of LC3-II/I can indirectly reflect autophagy (Zois and Koukourakis, 2009). BECLIN-1 is also required for autophagy, and when phosphorylated, BECLIN-1 can dissociate from BCL-2 to initiate autophagy (Yue et al., 2003; Yuan et al., 2012). P62, a multifunctional ubiquitin-binding protein which can bind to LC3, will be wrapped by autophagosomes and enter into lysosomes for degradation (Mizushima et al., 2010; Lu and Hu, 2016). In our study, allicin could upregulate the levels of LC3II/I and BECLIN-1 in STZinduced mouse or cell models, suggesting activation of autophagy. Interestingly, the expression of P62 was also elevated by allicin, which might be due to compensatory increases in the numbers of autophagosome and autolysosome rather than blockage of autophagy (Zheng et al., 2011).\nAMPK is a sensor of the overall energy charge of a cell, which can regulate cellular metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis and participate in autophagy (Marwick, 1993; Bischoff et al., 2012). mTOR, as a downstream of AMPK, can be also involved in the regulation of autophagy. In this study, allicin could activate AMPK/mTOR pathway in STZ-induced mouse and cell models through increasing pAMPK/AMPK ratio and decreasing pmTOR/ mTOR ratio. In addition, AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC) could significantly reverse the effects of allicin. These data suggested that allicin could activate the AMPK/mTOR mediated autophagy to play a protective role against STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury.\nBy the time of T1DM diagnosis, there are about 70%\u201380% of the \u03b2cell masses injured or even lost because of \u03b2-cell apoptosis (Ding et al., 2013). Pancreatic \u03b2-cell apoptosis is indispensable for the pathogenesis of T1DM, and autophagy is an important regulator of apoptosis (Degenhardt et al., 2006). The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis is complex (Nagata, 1997), and the autophagy can be manifested as stress adaptation to inhibit apoptosis or prevent cell death (Adrain and Martin, 2001). BAX is a pro-apoptotic cytoplasmic protein of the BCL-2 family, and BAX and BCL-2 are the main mediators of endogenous apoptosis. Apoptosis can be activated by apoptotic protein BAX and inhibited by anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 (Wang et al., 2015). In our study, allicin could significantly downregulate the expression of BAX and up-regulate the level of BCL-2 in STZ-induced mouse or cell models. However, AMPK inhibitor CC could offset these effects of allicin. Meanwhile, the results of TUNEL staining and flow cytometry were consistent with this trend,\nsuggesting that allicin could alleviate STZ-induced apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells through AMPK/mTOR pathway. Certainly, there are still some limitations in our study. T1DM involves autoimmunemediated destruction of pancreatic \u03b2 cells, and the pathological process of T1DM may involve survival/death of immune cells (English et al., 2009). In this study, the specific roles of allicin on immune cells in T1DM were not explored. Moreover, only AMPK inhibitor was used in present study, and mTOR inhibitor has not been tested.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that allicin could significantly alleviate STZ-induced pancreatic \u03b2 cells injury in vivo and in vitro T1DM models. Allicin could significantly decrease blood glucose level, improve islet structure and insulin expression, and inhibit apoptosis to reduce STZinduced pancreatic \u03b2 cell injury and loss through activating AMPK/ mTORmediated autophagy pathway. In summary, our study showed that allicin treatment could significantly reduce STZ-induced T1DM progression, suggesting that allicin may be a potential therapy option for T1DM patients."
