            "text": "Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the food delivery sector to boom as people continue to rely on services provided by online catering platforms (OCPs). However, due to the nature of sharing economy employment, gig workers\u2019 contributions went largely ignored until intervention from institutional governance. This study explores the impacts of labor market transformation after the Chinese government issued guidance to promote gig workers\u2019 welfare as a focal case.\nMethodology: Focus groups and the Delphi technique were used to explore associated impacts on OCPs and gig workers based on governance theory.\nFindings: Results show that institutional governance negatively affected OCPs\u2019 operating cost structure but sustained gig workers\u2019 welfare. The dual effects of market mechanism and institutional governance in the sharing economy are needed to be balanced for labor market transformation.\nOriginality: We suggest that moving from market governance to stakeholder governance, as mediated by state governance, could transform gig workers\u2019 labor structure in the gig economy. This study presents an integrated governance theory to enhance the epistemology of institutional governance.\nResearch Implications: Long-term equilibrium can be fulfilled given the growing food-related demand for the market mechanism. Social reciprocity is expected to be realized through institutional governance for gig workers\u2019 welfare.\nLimitations: Qualitative in-depth investigations limit findings\u2019 broader generalizability.\nKeywords: COVID-19, gig economy, labor market transformation, gig workers, institutional governance\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an economic downturn touching various industries (So et al., 2021). The online food delivery sector is an exception in the hospitality domain (Kaur et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021), given people\u2019s reliance on services provided by online catering platforms (OCPs). Issues related to OCP gig workers\u2019 welfare have also become more prominent during the pandemic due to complex circumstances. First, OCPs\u2019 sales have grown substantially thanks to governments\u2019 physical distancing policies that led citizens to stay home and limit non-essential contact with others. Yet these increased sales solely benefit suppliers, not gig workers. Second, OCPs have partnered with conventional restaurants to sustain the traditional catering industry. Many restaurateurs temporarily laid off staff and shut down due to the pandemic (Chan, 2020). Some restaurants survived because they could cooperate with food delivery platforms to offer takeout, leading to gig worker exploitation based on heavier workloads. Third, OCPs provided informal employment and an economic lifeline to many individuals who lost their jobs amid the pandemic (Baum and Hai, 2020, Baum et al., 2020): as the hospitality industry endured thousands of closures during COVID-19, many practitioners turned to gig employment to survive the economic decline (Leung and Low, 2020, Southey, 2020). Welfare-related concerns have yet to be rectified.\nLittle research has considered free-market and institutional-governance mechanisms present in the gig economy when the labor market failed because of gig economy attributes. Gig workers contributed to food suppliers, consumers, and OCPs in the face of COVID-19 restrictions. Hao et al. (2020) recommended that hospitality businesses reformulate their human resource strategies to cope with the pandemic\u2019s ongoing negative impacts. Hospitality businesses have been encouraged to reduce non-essential labor cost flexibility by utilizing gig workers through service socialization (Hao et al., 2020). However, the gig economy\u2019s human resource practices have violated many well-defined labor guidelines. The catering and food delivery sectors have relied on OCP gig workers to withstand the pandemic, but employers have not addressed their profound contributions. Gig worker practices thus present new issues (Godovykh et al., 2022) as conventional hospitality businesses seek to optimize human resource costs by capitalizing on work flexibility prevalent in the gig economy (Healy et al., 2017).\nThis study conceptualizes the initial transformation of shared human resources upon which platform intermediaries (e.g., food delivery platforms) operate by connecting service requesters (e.g., organizations or consumers) with on-demand gig workers (Meijerink and Keegan, 2019, Wu et al., 2019). The gig economy has long been viewed through a post-Fordist lens owing to its worker autonomy, flexibility, skill development opportunities, and employment opportunities (Vrasti, 2021). Meanwhile, many scholars have dissented based on Taylorism (Ahsan, 2020, Kaine and Josserand, 2019, Lamberton, 2018, Moragra, 2017, Stewart and Stanford, 2017, Todol\u00ed-Signes, 2017). Tan et al. (2021) separated ethical and legal concerns about the gig economy into three categories\u2014the new organization of work, the pristine nature of work, and workers\u2019 latest status\u2014 to encourage deliberation and policy responses. The prototypical employer-employee relationship\nso that employers can offload contractual responsibilities (Furunes and Mkono, 2019). McKeown (2016) asserted that the gig economy challenges prevailing orthodoxies: it falls through systemic regulatory and conceptual gaps based on traditional employment notions and places work exploitation in the gig economy under a spotlight (Ahsan, 2020, Lamberton, 2018, Moragra, 2017).\nPotential worker exploitation has sparked academic debate about whether intermediaries should be legally regulated within the traditional independent contracting framework (Wu et al., 2019). Given fundamental differences between gig workers and independent contractors (Stewart and Stanford, 2017), many scholars have called for specific regulations of labor protections in the gig economy rather than extending existing labor laws (Kaine and Josserand, 2019, Todol\u00ed-Signes, 2017). Despite its market-oriented nature, the gig economy demands government interventions to operate within a well-developed governance system and support a new labor transformation (Tronsor, 2018). These regulations can contribute to flexible and welfare forms of production (Goods et al., 2019, Robinson et al., 2019). Governance issues in the gig economy are attracting ongoing attention (Vallas and Schor, 2020). Even so, most studies have been conceptual in encouraging government-led governance (Wu et al., 2019), leaving a significant knowledge void surrounding the effectiveness of specific governance from gig workers\u2019 points of view (Ashford et al., 2018).\nOne of the most current and vital governance systems, the \u201cGuides on Implementing the Responsibilities of Online Catering Platforms for Effectively Protecting the Rights and Interests of Food Delivery Personnel\u201d (the Guides), was jointly issued by seven departments in mainland China (including the State Administration for Market Regulation of China) in July 2021. This newly launched governance system serves as government intervention against platform capitalism in the gig economy. OCPs must now shoulder responsibility for gig workers\u2019 welfare, resulting in additional operating costs (Yu et al., 2021). In addition to impacts on OCPs, the Guides tackle the unregulated marketplace of the gig economy to promote flexible and welfare forms of labor productivity in the second labor market transformation, as described by Tronsor (2018). Li and Singal (2021) systematically reviewed 120 hospitality studies on governance and argued that most works had considered the effects of governance on firms (e.g., OCPs) while overlooking consequences for employees (e.g., gig workers). The current study thus explores the Guides\u2019 impacts on the shared labor market from 1) the supply side (i.e., gig workers\u2019 human resource transformation) and 2) the demand side (i.e., OCPs\u2019 role in the gig economy). We specifically discuss the long-term problems associated with OCPs\u2019 exploitation of gig workers. This study contributes to governance theories to answer questions about gig workers\u2019 welfare issues while urging OCPs to pursue innovative hospitality operations."

            "text": "2.1 Online Catering Platforms\u2019 Growth via Dynamic Equilibrium amid COVID-19\nof ambiguity, such as the pandemic (Baum and Hai, 2020, Baum et al., 2020, Heylighen, 2017). A recent article from Food Navigator titled \u201cOnline food delivery \u2018one of the only winners\u2019 in coronavirus outbreak\u201d captures a phenomenon in which the pandemic has boosted the OCP sector in both revenue and user numbers (Leung and Low, 2020, Southey, 2020) due to prevention and control measures. Deliveroo, an OCP in Hong Kong, reported that the company\u2019s sales and orders doubled in the first quarter of 2020 (Leung and Low, 2020). In these times, OCPs represent more than an \u201cinnovative disruptor\u201d in the economy (Guttentag, 2015); they have unveiled a cooperative relationship between the conventional hospitality industry and broader society (Mahato et al., 2021, Spurk and Straub, 2020).\nAs an economic structure supported by demand and supply, the OCP sector has skyrocketed during the pandemic. For example, Deliveroo reported a 25% jump in restaurant partners in 2020. Restaurants\u2019 inquiries for collaboration with Food Panda have also quadrupled. Generally, the price equilibrium remains stable when suppliers quickly meet rising demand by increasing their food delivery capacity and employment (Cernuschi et al., 2018). Henderson (2020) reported an approximate 150% rise in gig workers in the United States, contributing more than $1 trillion to its economy. The scale of the OCP sector is expected to grow continuously\u2014based on not only a rapid shift in societal attitudes toward informal employment (Zafar and Perepu, 2020) but also a workforce transition from full-time to self-employed workers in the hospitality industry (Cheremond, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously accelerated OCPs\u2019 growth and gig workers\u2019 welfare issues as a result.\n2.2 Employment Structure in the Gig Economy\nThe unanticipated social upheaval associated with COVID-19 has altered the hospitality industry\u2019s employment structure (Baum, 2015). Hao et al. (2020) recommended that affiliated businesses reformulate their human resource strategies to cope with the consequences of the pandemic. In particular, hospitality businesses have been encouraged to \u201creduce non-essential costs by utilizing gig workers\u201d (Hao et al., 2020). COVID-19 has shown how the gig economy\u2019s human resource structure can change the hospitality labor market by introducing more flexible, creative work settings (Kastelle, 2013). PricewaterhouseCoopers urged companies not to ignore employment trends in the gig economy, suggesting that firms should consider incorporating this employment structure into their operations (Osztovits and Nagy, 2015). Informal employment represents a critical work trend in a post-COVID-19 world. More than 32% of organizations plan to replace their full-time employees with contingent workers as a cost-saving measure (Cheremond, 2020). The labor market is now mixed, with more informal employees being present.\nEmploying part-time and temporary workers is nothing new in the hospitality industry; work has been overhauled to emphasize flexibility and cost savings since the 1980s (Watson et al., 2003). However, the pandemic has led gig work to prevail in hospitality to optimize human resource allocation by capitalizing on work flexibility. Stewart and Stanford (2017) summarized four unique\nsupplying some work-related materials (e.g., vehicles or mobile phones), receiving salaries at a piece rate, and receiving instruments (e.g., work schedule and location) from online platforms. Healy et al. (2017) described gig workers as \u201cadditional go-between platform companies and buyers in the form of couriers\u201d (p. 233), with Zervas et al. (2017) stressing workforce flexibility as a catalyst for gig economy growth.\nOCPs have enjoyed blooming market share and revenue but have neglected to acknowledge gig workers\u2019 contributions. Meanwhile, these workers find themselves in high-stress settings facing heavy workloads, long hours, low job security, and limited socialization (Jabagi et al., 2019, Kaine and Josserand, 2019, Watson et al., 2003). Relevant discussions have revolved around enhancing gig workers\u2019 job satisfaction and reducing turnover intention (Ariza-Montes et al., 2018). However, OCPs did not truly contemplate solutions to gig workers\u2019 welfare issues until the Guides were implemented in China.\n2.3 Reforming Through Institutional Governance\nThe gig economy is an innovative system that effectively uses fragmented production factors, including human resources, which have been outsourced to third agents based on the ontology of economic self-interest (Kirchner and Sch\u00fc\u00dfler, 2020). Despite the gig economy\u2019s resilience and flexibility, governments hold conflicting views on intervening in and governing the cost-shifting nature of gig-based human resources. Haveman and Nedzhvetskaya (2022) asserted that only a well-developed governance system could balance liberal capitalism and social welfare in the gig economy. Equalizing the market mechanism and government intervention is challenging but necessary (Lamberton, 2018, Todol\u00ed-Signes, 2017).\nCountries typically adopt two tactics to mitigate human resource obstacles tied to the gig economy. These methods can be conceptualized on a continuum ranging from prohibition to protection (Nica and Potcovaru, 2015). The first approach is akin to prohibiting governments from taking drastic action against gig business operations. Courts have declared that transportation-sharing services with non-professional drivers are illegal in Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The U.S. state of California similarly fined Uber $7.3 million for illegally treating drivers as contractors and suspended the company\u2019s operations state-wide. However, the effectiveness of this strict approach remains doubtful. Many gig workers continue not to heed government mandates: they either operate until they are noticed and then fight back in court or educate stakeholders on the benefits of the sharing economy until the government finally relents (Marchi and Parekh, 2015). Bansal (2020) asserted that this method is unrealistic because OCPs in the gig economy has already permeated the hospitality industry.\nThe second tactic involves designing and passing regulations to protect the legal operations of gig economy businesses. For example, the Singaporean government allowed transportation-sharing service providers who attended a 25-hour vocational license course to operate legally (Lim, 2017). While these practices seem to favor protection over prohibition when regulating the sharing\nstrategies do not serve any essential protective role for gig workers (Katta et al., 2020). Robinson et al. (2019) maintained that such protection guidance has lagged behind all-industry comparisons. (Leung and Magramo, 2020), Leung (2020) also identified underdeveloped regulations in gig economy employment because many food delivery gig workers do not receive sick leave or compensation even if they are injured on the job. Underdeveloped laws have led many scholars to view the gig economy from a neo-Fordist perspective. Researchers have hence criticized the rhetoric around post-Fordist notions of flexibility and authority that have obscured possible labor policy violations in the gig economy (Goods et al., 2019, Lamberton, 2018, Ravenelle, 2019).\n2.4 Typology and Application of Governance Theory\nGovernance has long been an area of interest in the hospitality literature to quell the argument around free-market or state governance mechanisms from industry and gig workers\u2019 perspectives (Ruhanen et al., 2010). The hospitality industry\u2019s dynamic external environment has spawned numerous governance mechanisms (Singal, 2015). The emphasis on transitioning from top-down forms of bureaucracy to bottom-up decision-making input to develop competitive advantages (Zeppel, 2012) follows two lines.\nFirst, many scholars have viewed governance from a strategic management standpoint regarding how industry structure and firm attributes contribute to competitive advantages. The hospitality industry has historically consisted of small to medium enterprises. Numerous investigations have thus pondered how governance should be leveraged to address corporate problems (Guillet and Mattila, 2010). Foci include fostering firm transformation (Utami et al., 2020), achieving better firm performance (Madanoglu et al., 2018 & Ozdemir, 2018), promoting corporate social responsibility (Uyar et al., 2020), and solving agency problems (Altin et al., 2016).\nThe second research area assumes a political economy stance. Different from the first line of work, which suggests that competitive advantages are born from corporate strategies, this perspective argues that governments and institutions are more critical to such advantages (Beaumont and Dredge, 2010, Hall, 2013). Destination governance scholars have primarily harnessed this statecentric approach to determine how governments and destination management organizations should wield national policies and institutional frameworks to establish competitive advantages in the tourism industry (Amore and Hall, 2016, Go and Trunfio, 2012, Wang et al., 2022).\nEven though these viewpoints seem contradictory in conceptualizing competitive advantages, they are complementary in their mutual neglect of each other\u2019s insights (Murtha and Lenway, 1994). Strategic management overlooks the instability of the external environment implying that a highly competitive economy with limited market intervention can realize optimal competitiveness. By contrast, the political economy perspective ignores industrial and organizational differences to promote a managed economy and build competitive advantages. Griffiths and Zammuto (2005) proposed four governance mechanisms: 1) state governance, 2) stakeholder governance, 3) market governance and 4) corporate governance along two axes (i.e., state involvement\u2013market-driven\ntypology that can balance business competitiveness with gig workers\u2019 welfare. As a flourishing sector, OCPs comprise a flexible and market governance mechanism in delegating control among OCPs who retain authority over key economic activities for profit (Vallas and Schor, 2020). Thus, OCPs\u2019 cost\u2013profit nature leaves gig workers\u2019 welfare concerns untouched until government interventions are implemented to tackle possible worker exploitation (Lamberton, 2018).\n2.5 A Governance System in Mainland China for OCPs\nThe Chinese food delivery sector has contributed more than one-third ($38.4 billion) of global revenue ($95.4 billion) (Zhao and Bacao, 2020). The launch of the Guides in 2021 drove an ongoing shift from cooperative or market governance to state governance in the OCP industry. Li and Singal (2021) echoed this observation by pointing out that gig-economy growth continues to strengthen cooperative or market governance mechanisms that need to be balanced. They further called for a transformational mechanism (e.g., a state governance mechanism) to balance corporate competitiveness and gig workers\u2019 welfare.\nAs an initial model of a state governance mechanism, the Guides cover seven areas to promote gig workers\u2019 labor welfare and well-being: 1) guaranteeing labor income; 2) ensuring labor safety; 3) maintaining food safety; 4) improving social security; 5) optimizing the work environment; 6) strengthening organizational construction; and 7) providing conflict resolution mechanisms (Table 1) (Chinanews, 2021). Despite not yet containing explicit laws, the Guides have generated extensive conversation regarding their possible impacts on the sector (Xu and Gao, 2021). The adverse effects of state governance mechanisms on firm performance are well documented in hospitality (Chen et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014). The Guides were expected to induce additional operating costs and reduce OCPs\u2019 profitability. This argument is reflected in OCPs\u2019 market situation; the Hong Kong stock price for Meituan, mainland China\u2019s food delivery giant, has fallen by more than 15% (Yu et al., 2021).\nAreas Details 1.

Launching conflict resolution mechanism \u2022 Establish a coordination mechanism to promote labor rights\nand interests\n\u2022 Implement territorial responsibilities\nHowever, as a governance mechanism developed to tackle worker exploitation and promote gig workers\u2019 welfare, the Guides are anticipated to influence OCPs\u2019 operations and gig workers\u2019 experiences. The Guides address gig worker exploitation and the lack of job welfare. The impacts of the Guides are not necessarily positive from gig workers\u2019 perspectives, mainly because these workers\u2019 dissatisfaction with formal bureaucracy was a primary motivation for joining the gig economy from the outset (i.e., for flexibility) (Lin et al., 2020). Ashford et al. (2018) advocated for more empirical investigations into how governance mechanisms affect stakeholders in the gig economy. Li and Singal (2021) subsequently pointed out the paucity of work amplifying gig workers\u2019 voices in the hospitality literature.\n3. Methodology\n3.1 Data Collection\nThis study adopted a mixed-methods qualitative design to present exploratory in-depth insights about the Guides\u2019 impacts on concerned stakeholders. Because of pandemic circumstances, a focus group and the Delphi technique were implemented through online and offline mixed conferencing. The study design is outlined in Table 2, indicating measurement credibility and sampling distributions without bias (Lohr, 2021). Focus groups are discussion-based interviews that produce verbal data generated via group interaction (Millward, 1995). First, five university and five institutional panels related to China\u2019s food delivery sector were recruited via snowball sampling to discuss the Guides\u2019 effects on OCPs and gig workers to provide academic and practical viewpoints. All panel members were familiar with the Guides and knowledgeable about the\nwhich people interact, express, and develop their views (Litosseliti, 2003). Evidence was recorded upon observing non-verbal behavior and noting paralinguistic features such as interruptions, overlapping speech, and tone of voice. The verbatim content of discussions constituted the corpus of material for content analysis. Data were acquired via notetaking online and offline audiovisual recordings. Second, the Delphi technique was carried out to obtain the most reliable opinion consensus by subjecting panel members to a series of in-depth questionnaires interspersed with controlled opinion feedback (Dalkey and Helmer, 1963). Eight participants (four scholars and four food delivery practitioners) were recruited through convenience sampling to formulate predictions based on summarized focus group data from the previous stage. The first qualitative round involved a semi-structured questionnaire. The following two quantitative rounds included Likert scale\u2013related and quantitative measures under the Delphi technique until data saturation was reached (see Table 2). Data collection and analysis were performed using an iterative mixedmethods approach for qualitative credibility (Cataldi and Sena, 2021). All surveys fulfilled ethical requirements regarding consent, confidentiality and anonymity, and low risk of harm.\nTable 2 Mixed-methods Design\nStage Content Participants Duration Focus groups  Discuss the Guides\u2019 effects on OCPs and gig workers. 10 Note Two weeks Delphi technique 8 Note\nRound 1  Derive Guides\u2019 impacts on OCPs and gig workers.

Thematic analysis is a qualitative method to search for themes related to epistemological and ontological propositions (Braun and Clarke, 2006). This method expands the content analysis to \u201cpay greater attention to the qualitative aspects of the material analyzed\u201d (Joffe and Yardley, 2004). As a popular data analysis method in the hospitality literature (Qiu et al. (2021), thematic analysis enables unstructured information to be transformed into a structured overview. The research team reviewed the focus group transcripts several times and familiarized themselves with the data before coding transcripts in NVivo 11\ncommunicating) were followed to discern specific structures across the dataset.\nThe Delphi technique was carried out to generate in-depth data in respondents\u2019 first language; the analysis process of Wang et al. (2017) was followed to ensure that no word unique to the native language was overlooked. The first author, a native Chinese speaker, analyzed all transcripts in Chinese; the second author, a skilled English speaker, analyzed all transcripts in English and compared the initial codes with the Chinese version. The other authors served as auditors, comparing initial codes and resultant themes between versions before finalizing the results. The research team addressed minor coding inconsistencies during meetings to validate the analysis process. Data were then analyzed step by step to determine whether the information exhibited theoretical saturation. NVivo provides results for word frequency queries and content structures.\n3.3 Qualitative Research Limitations\nThis study\u2019s findings should be generalized with caution due to three methodological limitations. First, qualitative approaches were chosen because the Guides were recently implemented with OCPs; limited data were available for empirical analysis. China also holds robust governing power; this condition is salient when evaluating governance effects. Second, sample sizes for the focus group and Delphi technique were small and may temper the generalizability of results. However, these in-depth qualitative methods showed that the Guides had specific impacts on OCPs. Soliciting input from other stakeholders, including gig workers, consumers, and local citizens, would offer a more holistic view of the Guides\u2019 consequences. Third, findings are limited to the OCP sector in mainland China. This sector has been a unicorn in the gig economy since the pandemic\u2014it has permeated domains such as ridesharing (e.g., Uber and Lyft), caregiving (e.g., Sittercity and UrbanSitter), and home services (e.g., TaskRabbit and Wag). In addition, the explorative results are subject to change with the Guides\u2019 ongoing effects on OCPs. Subsequent studies should investigate how different governance systems can be designed to protect gig workers through other measures or legal procedures.\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1 Analysis\nOnly findings related to items that reach an agreed-upon degree of consensus shall be discussed in the Delphi technique (Petry et al., 2007). All items can thus be listed in order of consensus magnitude (Kranjc Horvat et al., 2021) and the areas about which the panel engaged in debate (see the coding example in Table 3, involving concerned parties and participants).\nInterview excerpt (Informant 10) Initial coding Identified themes\nBased on the Guides, I think online catering platforms can better implement the responsibility to protect the rights and interests of food delivery workers, which is a severe issue in China when many unscrupulous OCPs place profitability over food delivery workers\u2019 interests. OCPs do not implement the responsibility to maintain the rights and interests of food delivery workers because business profit is the priority. They cannot increase operating costs because of on-demand labor welfare without legal enforcement. However, the legal foundation of the Guides places all OCPs under the same competition conditions to fulfill the responsibility for food delivery workers. On-demand food delivery workers were expected to be algorithmically managed for OCPs\u2019 delivery tasks. For example, for task-related quantitative and time requirements, food delivery workers might violate traffic rules and cause incidents by their responsibilities. OCPs should provide insurance coverage. It is what OCPs should provide for employees working for them. Working for OCPs is an alternative to not working full-time; for example, if you were laid off, you may want to work for OCPs because you need to raise your kids. Business responsibility is essential to sustainable operations. However, OCPs have long ignored the responsibility for these food delivery workers, but it may not be too late for OCPs to follow the Guides. OCPs\u2019 service, as a daily requirement with a vast market in China, is inevitable and sustainable. There are more and more customers to be served; even the operating costs of implementing the Guides for food delivery welfare are higher than before. Moreover, OCPs\u2019 business image might no longer be a vampire. OCPs: Better control over operating costs OCPs: Lack of motivation to maintain food delivery workers\u2019 welfare OCPs: All OCPs should obey the Guides with exact operating costs Labor: Better interests Labor: Less work stress Labor: Job responsibility OCPs: Labor source Labor: Alternative job Labor: Family responsibilities Society: Stable, fair Government: Employment OCPs: Social responsibilities Government: Legal enforcement OCPs: Revenue and costs OFD: Inexpensive OCPs: Sustainable operations Hotel: Expensive Strength: High profitability Strength: Low costs Weakness: Rising operating costs Strength: Labor supply Strength: Labor supply Weakness: Social responsibility costs Strength: Sustainable operations Weakness: Low-cost performance\nNotes. Underlined words indicate comments on OCPs; italicized words indicate comments on food delivery workers.\nResults are presented here as an integrated summary followed by descriptions of the Guides\u2019 impacts from OCP stakeholders\u2019 perspectives. Figure 2 presents a keyword evaluation. OCPs\u2019 rise in the gig economy has continued with increases in both sales and on-demand gig workers\u2019 contributions amid the pandemic. The focus is twofold in this case: 1) how the gig economy\u2019s employment structure benefits OCPs\u2019 operations with low labor costs from on-demand labor, and 2) the relative lack of attention to gig workers\u2019 welfare. Kost et al. (2020) advised scholars to ponder how the gig economy can contribute to the supply and demand sides of the labor market beyond mere profits. The Guides offer a possible remedy for gig workers\u2019 welfare by regulating institutional governance. Associated practices can then be internalized into OCPs\u2019 business ethics and social responsibility. The COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity to alter the labor market with a normalized gig worker structure. The future labor structure must attend to gig workers\u2019\nthe Guides are discussed in the following sections.\n4.1.1 Direct Impacts\nThe Guides\u2019 most direct effect has been raising OCPs\u2019 operating costs, which has also informed labor allocation. OCPs\u2019 previous labor employment model lacked fair and legal mechanisms (e.g., labor income distribution and social security insurance), leading to low-cost advantages during operations. The Guides\u2019 institutional governance now requires OCPs to take gig workers\u2019 legitimate rights and interests into account. OCPs must establish an income distribution mechanism matching the workload to ensure that expected labor income meets the local minimum payment. In addition, gig workers\u2019 social security insurance (e.g., pilot insurance for employee injury protection) is the responsibility of OCPs and third-party agents. Panel respondents provided the following commentary:\n\u201cMost of the food delivery work is outsourced to agents. When an accident happens, the online catering rider has to bear the work risk alone because the rider cannot register with the social security system, such as industrial injury insurance or medical insurance. Some agents have purchased commercial insurance for riders, who still find commercial claims difficult to fulfill to receive injury compensation.\u201d (Informant #1)\n\u201cThe Guides require the platforms and third-party agents to participate in social insurance for riders with established labor relationships. According to the Guides, stakeholders can participate in the pilot insurance program for flexible employment on OCPs. The Guides also encourage exploration and provision of various commercial insurance protection schemes to improve the multi-level protection of flexible employment. Thus, the Guides have raised OCPs\u2019 operating costs directly.\u201d (Informant #5)\nIndirect influences have shifted the business focus to humanitarian concerns instead of technological advances. Initially, OCPs collected big data to access gig workers\u2019 performance through technical systems. However, the abuse of such data has led to strict algorithmic indices conveying gig workers\u2019 efficiency and output. Algorithmic management includes a rating system that automatically classifies workers upon service completion (Wood et al., 2019), inviting consumers to rate delivery services. From the OCP perspective, this practice pays workers only for what they have done, ignoring how they feel about their jobs (Lin et al., 2020). This monitoring purports to help gig workers avoid unfair management decisions informed by organizational politics (Karatepe, 2013); however, workers\u2019 mental health has gone mostly unnoticed. Further, an algorithmic rating system may enhance workers\u2019 job engagement by forcing them to compete with coworkers (Kuhn and Maleki, 2017, Shapiro, 2018). However, from the gig worker\u2019s point of view, this approach to employment can cause them to feel powerless over the many uncontrollable factors that influence the rating system beyond service quality (Cheng and Foley, 2019). More importantly, this algorithm-based approach could produce a Tayloristic workplace culture where workers become extrinsically motivated machines (Lepisto and Pratt, 2017). These stringent standards violate the principles of humanity. In the short term, rigorous indices could stimulate workers\u2019 performance and improve efficiency\u2014but in the long run, they will only take away from OCPs\u2019 profits without brand value and social image.\nThe Guides require OCPs to refrain from using stark algorithmic indices, such as the number of deliveries, time limits, punctuality rate, and 5-star reviews, to assess gig workers\u2019 performance. Piecework pay should reasonably consider delivery cases. OCPs are responsible for improving the order-scheduling mechanism, optimizing distribution routes, and determining task saturation to reduce labor stress. In other words, OCPs\u2019 technological advantages have taken a backseat in favor of more humane labor.\n4.1.3 Derived Impacts\nThe Guides also promote online catering labor unions, which could raise gig workers\u2019 bargaining power. These organizations can seek to negotiate labor rights and interests, improve job security, and craft in-depth initiatives to retain gig workers. Yet this requirement could blur OCPs\u2019 focus on profit as they negotiate with unions about workers\u2019 wishes and demands or devote time to resolving common labor disputes. For example, one labor union representative shared the following:\n\u201cThe labor union is enthusiastic about helping OCPs\u2019 sustainable development with a good employer-employee relationship. The union could suggest creative service methods, service content, and business models different from conventional operations. However, the union might require an optimized working environment, such as constructing temporary residences, installing smart lunch boxes, and innovating smart\na role in stabilizing and retaining employment.\u201d (Informant #3)\nThe Guides will undoubtedly bring adverse short-term consequences to OCPs. However, demand for food delivery remains high enough to support OCPs\u2019 long-term survival. Government governance could mainly take care of gig workers\u2019 welfare with an acceptable rise in the future pricing of food delivery services.\n4.2 Discussion\nA free-market or institutional-governance mechanism is presumed to be proper for all stakeholders in the sharing economy\u2019s weak-tie relationship labor market. OCP employers have exploited gig workers for some time from a positivist perspective. Results show that conditional institutional governance is necessary to guide the labor market towards a holistic structure that benefits stakeholders. To foster labor welfare, a regulated job marketplace is crucial in every human resource market (Baum and Hai, 2020). The Guides give gig workers greater authority to obtain labor welfare conditions they previously could not broach with their employers (Ahsan, 2020, Sundararajan, 2017). Many food delivery gig workers have contributed to society to combat the pandemic. The Guides\u2019 focus on labor welfare should maintain workers\u2019 job-related intentions (Lopez, 2020). This governance has already elicited growing public concern for food delivery gig workers (Katta et al., 2020), calling for exploration into how the Guides enhance or complement the gig economy\u2019s widely criticized employment structure (Rubery et al., 2016). Short-term impacts on OCPs\u2019 operating costs will presumably affect the industry\u2019s cost advantages; however, labor welfare based on social reciprocity and fairness can achieve long-term welfare economics.\nThe gig economy\u2019s employment structure requires intervention from institutional governance to alter cost-profit\u2013based cooperation. The Guides will generate additional expenses for OCPs\u2019 operations. Climbing costs could result in fluctuating wages and product prices in the short run. Long-term equilibrium is probable given the anticipated post-pandemic resilience of the hospitality industry and sharing economy demands. State governance also offers a necessary feedback mechanism to gig workers, who have contributed to the gig economy amid the pandemic as noted. The strong obligation-based norms on OCPs have shifted from personal responsibility to business and society (Lin et al., 2020). Gig economy employment is now seeming more impactful than before\u2014today\u2019s workers can attach environmental, social, entrepreneurial, and personal meaning to their jobs (Ahsan, 2020, B\u00f6cker and Meelen, 2017, De Stefano, 2015).\nAs discussed, the Guides have transformed the gig economy into a stakeholder governance mechanism (see Figure 1) that has prompted the formation of online catering labor unions for better bargaining power and social reciprocity (Fan et al., 2019). These unions could help workers cultivate more productive relationships with coworkers, supervisors, and family, enhancing workers\u2019 well-being. Before the Guides were implemented, food delivery workers\u2019 associations tended to be brief compared with established personal relationships (Li et al., 2020). These workers often interact daily with multiple supervisors (e.g., platform representatives), coworkers (e.g.,\nfeature weak ties without actual affiliation. Some gig workers even use other people\u2019s identities to communicate because newcomers are considered inferior to experienced workers who have devoted effort to \u201cplaying the game\u201d regarding work flexibility and other advantages. Therefore, some newcomers may prefer to purchase another worker\u2019s job account to enjoy similar benefits. After implementing the Guides, unions could improve gig workers\u2019 identities in the community by providing more chances to develop social ties (Roccas and Brewer, 2002). Thus, stakeholder governance arises from corporate governance because of the Guides\u2019 state governance intervention, as pictured in Figure 1.\nThe Guides also bring organizational policies framing OCPs\u2019 employer-employee relations and role structures closer to those in the conventional hospitality industry (Furunes and Mkono, 2019, Susskind and Curry, 2016). Stakeholder governance means all parties in the sharing economy are equally positioned compared to before (Perren and Kozinets, 2018). Workers engage in rapid role shifting to manage tasks associated with service delivery, leading these individuals to feel less stressed during work (Madera et al., 2013). Gig workers\u2019 duties can become more complicated, even if workers perceive themselves as independent contractors or employees because the Guides outline their work role structure (Furunes and Mkono, 2019). Fewer lawsuits around labor unrest in the gig economy are now likely to cite worker exploitation (Lamberton, 2018). Governments are implementing the Guides\u2019 governance power with deeper involvement in OCPs\u2019 structure to promote better-informed decisions. These new regulations clearly define gig workers\u2019 legal roles and welfare (Lamberton, 2018).\n5. Conclusions\n5.1 Conclusion\nShifting market governance to stakeholder governance (via intervention by state governance) could help transform gig workers\u2019 labor structure in the gig economy. This study reveals that the gig economy\u2019s employment structure is of growing interest in market governance for human resources with limited welfare in the face of the pandemic. However, gig workers\u2019 welfare could be addressed through the mediation of state governance; then, a fair labor market could be transformed into stakeholder governance in the gig economy. Conventional hospitality workers are expected to be retrained for multiple tasks and even to take up informal work in addition to their primary roles (Hao et al., 2020). More than 5 million formal job positions are projected to be replaced by either informal work or cyber-physical systems in the fourth industrial revolution (Armstron et al., 2018). Coupled with accolades showered upon the OCP sector and informal employment in the gig economy (Leung and Low, 2020, Southey, 2020), the Guides have propelled the transformation from OCPs\u2019 corporate governance to stakeholder governance with gig workers\u2019 rights and welfare in the post-pandemic era. This study contextualizes Chinese gig workers\u2019 labor structure transformation by presenting the Guide\u2019s effects of gig work on various stakeholders. As on-demand workers are granted labor protections, a state governance mechanism\nprotecting these workers\u2019 welfare. Gig workers\u2019 bargaining power has become potent with the transformation from market to stakeholder governance through state governance in China\u2019s gig economy.\nThis study has explored gig workers\u2019 welfare and human resource transformation in the sharing economy, which requires a state policy for guidance when the market-driven structure has failed. Stakeholder governance should be implemented through state governance intervention to close theoretical and practical gaps in corporate governance for labor market transformation in the hospitality gig economy.\n5.2 Theoretical Contributions\nThe constructed typology of governance theory, as shown in Figure 1, extends the theoretical literature and provides practical advice about the Guides. Many investigations on the gig economy assume a consumer perspective (Gleim et al., 2019). This typology of governance theory advances a labor-oriented understanding of the gig economy from the relationship between gig workers and platform companies (Mody et al., 2021). This angle is vital for two reasons: 1) the gig economy is driven by demand (i.e., consumers) and supply (i.e., gig workers and platform companies) (Lin et al., 2020); and 2) the gig economy\u2019s employment structure has been largely criticized for possible worker exploitation (Lamberton, 2018, Ravenelle, 2019). Institutional governance is essential for facilitating the transformation of the shared labor market. Investigations into state and stakeholder governance mechanisms remain scarce in hospitality. This typology of governance theory offers a systematic view on integrating institutional governance from traditional to gig economy.\n5.3 Practical Contributions\nTaking the Guides as an example of a state governance mechanism to manage the gig economy, this study demonstrated how a shift from a market/corporate governance mechanism to a stakeholder governance mechanism with the intervention of state governance balances the benefits of gig workers and platform companies. Specifically, results revealed that gig workers found the Guides (i.e., a state governance mechanism) effective in promoting job welfare and security\u2014 topics that have been challenging to address with OCPs due to the shared attributes of this economy\u2019s labor structure. Moreover, platform companies should adhere to state governance and the Guides\u2019 instructions to devise innovative operation approaches and enhance their brand value and social image. The Guides\u2019 state governance shall trigger a wave of industry innovations to remedy gig workers\u2019 initial cost advantage. Many platform companies are defining themselves as technological innovators to generate profits through existing corporate or market governance mechanisms (Vallas and Schor, 2020). These firms need to follow state governance interventions from an industry and labor market transformation to a stakeholder governance structure.\n5.4 Implications\nspecifically the Guides, influences gig workers\u2019 job attributes. The Guides emerged in response to the hospitality industry\u2019s evolving employment structure. Myriad workers in China are engaged in on-demand work, and this proportion is rising. The Guides, which OCPs should implement, protect on-demand workers\u2019 legal status and boost gig workers\u2019 motivation to continue participating in the sharing economy.\nIn addition to the methodological limitations mentioned in Section 3.3, other limitations illuminate avenues for future work. This study referred to recommended guidance from a welfare economics perspective to explore the role of institutional governance in gig workers\u2019 welfare. Therefore, it is necessary to examine how industrial innovations more thoroughly should be developed to remedy the loss of cost advantage in the gig economy when state governance is imposed. Additionally, although we investigated how a protective regulatory framework can help prevent worker exploitation, precisely which, when, and how such policies are best suited to the gig economy should be identified to facilitate decision-making about the Guides implementation. The effects of related measures should also be monitored over the long term."
