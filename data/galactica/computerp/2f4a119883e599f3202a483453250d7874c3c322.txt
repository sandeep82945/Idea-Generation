conclusion We conducted the first empirical study of PTM reuse in the Hugging Face DL model registries. Based on interviews with 12 practitioners, we defined the decision-making workflow for PTM reuse, and identified three challenges, including missing attributes, discrepancies, and model risks. To substantiate our qualitative data, we further investigated into useful attributes and potential risks in the Hugging Face ecosystem. We unveiled risky engineering practices in the Hugging Face ecosystem, particularly a lack of signatures in the PTM supply chain. REPRODUCIBILITY AND RESEARCH ETHICS
