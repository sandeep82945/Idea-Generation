            "text": "Quantum field theory is a key tool to analyse particle physics. The most modern physical description of the fundamental particle interaction is described by the model called the Standard Model. However, the model possesses several problems such as incompatibility with the general relativity, hierarchy problem, etc. Therefore, it is an active area to extend the standard model.\nRecently a growing number of research papers started exploring the non-Hermitian extension of the Standard Model [1\u201314]. We have contributed to this development by analysing the Goldstone theorem [8, 10], The Higgs mechanism [9] and t\u2019HooftPolyakov monopoles [11]. The classical masses of Higgs particles, massive gauge boson and monopoles were analysed. However, a detailed analysis of their intersecting physical regions and the mechanism of the real value of the energy of monopole was not explored. The main aim of this contribution is to fill this gap.\nThere are two separate mechanisms that guarantee the real value of the particle masses in question. First, the masses of Higgs particles are given by a nonHermitian mass matrix M . Assume that the matrix possess anti-linear symmetry, which we refer to as PT symmetry, that satisfies [PT , M ] = 0, Mv = \u03bbv, PT v = ei\u03b8v, where {v, \u03bb} are eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the mass matrix. From this, it is trivial to show that the eigenvalues are real\nPT Mvi = PT \u03bbivi = \u03bb\u2217i PT vi = \u03bb\u2217i ei\u03b8ivi, PT Mvi = MPT vi = Mei\u03b8ivi = \u03bbiei\u03b8ivi.\nIt was shown in [8] that this PT symmetry is related to the CPT symmetry of the field-theoretic action.\nOn the other hand, the classical energy of the soliton solution is found by inserting the solution into the Hamiltonian E = H[\u03d5] = \u222b d3xH(\u03d5). Therefore, the techniques from PT symmetric quantum mechanics shown above can not be applied.\nWe will show below that the energy of the soliton solutions are real when the three conditions stated\nbelow holds. Therefore they are sufficient conditions to guarantee the real value of particles in the model. However, we do not claim that these are necessary conditions.\nLet {\u03d51, \u03d52} be a set of distinct (or identical) solutions to the equations of motion \u03b4L/\u03b4\u03d5 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5(\u03b4L/\u03b4\u2202\u00b5\u03d5) = 0, where L(\u03d5) is the field-theoretic Lagrangian density. The classical energies of the solution are given by inserting the solution into the Hamiltonian, Ei = H[\u03d5i] = \u222b d3xH(\u03d5i), for i \u2208 {1, 2}. The classical mass of the solution \u03d51 and \u03d52 are real if there exist some anti-linear symmetry CPT (note that is it not the standard CPT symmetry in quantum field theory) such that three conditions are satisfied: (1.) CPT : H[\u03d5(x)] \u2192 H[CPT \u03d5(x)] = H\u2020[\u03d5(\u2212x)]. (2.) CPT : \u03d51(x) \u2192 \u03d52(\u2212x). (3.) H[\u03d51] = H[\u03d52]. If two solutions are identical \u03d51 = \u03d52, then the above condition reduces to the reality condition of the soliton solution already derived in [15]. Using the above three conditions, the real value of the classical mass can easily be shown by the following argument\u222b\nd3xH[CPT \u03d5(x)] (1)= \u222b\nd3xH\u2020[\u03d5(\u2212x)] = M\u20201 ,\n(2)= \u222b d3xH[\u03d52(\u2212x)] = M2,\n=\u21d2 M\u20201 = M2 (3)=\u21d2 M\u20201 = M1,\nwhere numbers above the equal signs indicate the condition number.\nThe above analysis can be performed directly on the complex model. However, the non-Hermitian theory is only well-defined once the inner-product is identified. The modern way of the well-defined non-Hermitian quantum mechanics was first realised by Frederik Scholtz, Hendrik Geyer, and Fritz Hahne in 1992, [16]. The authors used the mathematical condition on the operator called the quasi-Hermiticity (the term was first coined in [17], but the metric was\nnot given) to define the positive definite inner product. The quasi-Hermiticity is defined as a condition on the bounded linear operator of the Hilbert space A : H \u2192 H, which satisfies (i)\u27e8v|\u03c1v\u27e9 > 0 for all |v\u27e9 \u2208 H and |v\u27e9 =\u0338 0. (ii)\u03c1A = A\u2020\u03c1 . Where the bounded Hermitian linear operator \u03c1 : H \u2192 H is often called the metric operator because the inner product is defined by the operator \u27e8\u00b7|\u00b7\u27e9\u03c1 := \u27e8\u00b7|\u03c1\u00b7\u27e9 restores the Hermiticity of the operator. This result can be shown by using the condition(ii)\n\u27e8v|Aw\u27e9\u03c1 \u2261 \u27e8v|\u03c1Aw\u27e9 = \u27e8v|A \u2020\u03c1w\u27e9 = \u27e8Av|\u03c1w\u27e9 = \u27e8Av|w\u27e9\u03c1 ,\nfor all |v\u27e9 , |w\u27e9 \u2208 H. Note that the quasi-Hermiticity alone does not guarantee the real energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian. In fact, one requires two extra conditions. (iii)The metric operator is invertible. (iv)\u03c1 = \u03b7\u2020\u03b7. The operator which satisfies only conditions (ii) and (iv) is referred to as the pseudo-Hermitian operator, which was first introduced in [18]. These extra conditions were considered in [16] to prove that, given a set of pseudo-Hermitian operators A = {Ai}, the metric operator \u03c1A which satisfies conditions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) for all operators of set A is uniquely determined if and only if all operators of the set A are irreducible on the Hilbert space H. This procedure is analogous to the Dyson mapping first introduced by Freeman Dyson [19] used in the study of nuclear reaction [20\u201322], which maps the non-Hermitian operator A to Hermitian operator \u03b7\u22121A\u03b7 via Dyson map \u03b7. The relation between the metric operator and the Dyson map is found by utilising the Hermiticity of the expression \u03b7\u22121A\u03b7 in the following way\n\u03b7\u22121A\u03b7 = (\u03b7\u22121A\u03b7)\u2020 =\u21d2 A\u03b7\u2020\u03b7 = \u03b7\u2020\u03b7A\u2020 =\u21d2 \u03b7\u2020\u03b7 = \u03c1. (1) We will utilise this mapping to transform the nonHermitian field-theoretic Hamiltonian to a Hermitian Hamiltonian. This procedure will resolve the issue of complex vacuum solution and Derrick\u2019s scaling argument, as we will see below. However, we note that the Dyson map used here introduces a negative kinetic sign in the kinetic term of one of the fields, indicating the ghost field problem. This issue is removed if one further diagonalise the Hamiltonian. Such diagonalisation can be realised via field-redefinition or via another Dyson map. A more detailed discussion of this is found in [23], and a Dyson map which diagonalise the free part of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is found in [12]."

            "text": "In this section, we will summarise the method used in [8\u201311] to find the masses of the Higgs particles, massive gauge particles and t\u2019Hooft-Polyakov monopoles in non-Hermitian gauge field theory. We note that the explicit forms of the similarity transformation\nwill not be discussed in this paper as non-Hermitian and Hermitian theories are isospectral as long as the CPT symmetry is preserved for Hamiltonian, Higgs particles and monopole solution.\nWe begin with the non-Hermitian local SU(2) gauge theory with matter fields in the adjoint representation\nLad2 = 1 4Tr (D\u03d51) 2 + m 2 1 4 Tr(\u03d5 2 1) (2)\n\u2212i\u00b5 2\n2 Tr(\u03d51\u03d52) \u2212 g 64 [ Tr(\u03d521) ]2 +14Tr (D\u03d52) 2 + m 2 2 4 Tr(\u03d5 2 2) \u2212 1 8Tr ( F 2 ) .\nHere we take g, \u00b5 \u2208 R, mi \u2208 R and discrete values ci \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. The two fields {\u03d5i}i=1,2 are Hermitian matrices \u03d5i(t, x\u20d7) \u2261 \u03d5ai (t, x\u20d7)T a, where \u03d5ai (t, x\u20d7) is a real-valued field. The three generators {T a}a=1,2,3 of SU(2) in the adjoint representation are defined by three Hermitian matrices of the form (T a)bc = \u2212i\u03f5abc, satisfying the commutation relation [T a, T b] = i\u03f5abcT c. One can check that Tr(T aT b) = 2\u03b4ab. The field strength tensor is defined as F\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202\u00b5A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdA\u00b5 \u2212 ie[A\u00b5, A\u03bd ], where the gauge fields are A\u00b5 = Aa\u00b5T a. The partial derivative is replaced with the covariant derivative (D\u00b5\u03d5i)a := \u2202\u00b5\u03d5ai + e\u03b5abcAb\u00b5\u03d5ci to compensate for the local symmetry group SU(2).\nThis action is invariant under the local SU(2) transformation of the matter fields \u03d5i \u2192 ei\u03b1 a(x)T a\u03d5ie \u2212i\u03b1a(x)T a and gauge fields A\u00b5 \u2192 ei\u03b1 a(x)T aA\u00b5e \u2212i\u03b1a(x)T a + 1e \u2202\u00b5\u03b1 a(x)T a. It is also symmetric under modified CPT symmetry, which transforms two fields, \u03d51 and \u03d52 as\nCPT : \u03d51(t, x\u20d7) \u2192 \u03d51(\u2212t, \u2212x\u20d7) (3) : \u03d52(t, x\u20d7) \u2192 \u2212\u03d52(\u2212t, \u2212x\u20d7) : i \u2192 \u2212i.\nThe equations of motion for the fields \u03d5i and A\u00b5 of the Lagrangian (2) are\n(D\u00b5D\u00b5\u03d5i)a + \u03b4V\u03b4\u03d5a i = 0, (4)\nD\u03bdF \u03bd\u00b5 a \u2212 e\u03f5abc\u03d5b1(D\u00b5\u03d5)c + e\u03f5abc\u03d5b2(D\u00b5\u03d5)c = 0,\nwhere repeated indices are summed over. We perform the similarity transformation of the complex Lagrangian (2) by momentary resorting to a quantum theory where we assume an equal time commutation relation between the fields \u03d5ai and their canonical momenta \u03a0ai = \u22020\u03d5ai , satisfying the commutation relation [\u03d5ai (t, x\u20d7), \u03a0bj(t, y\u20d7)] = \u03b4(x\u20d7 \u2212 y\u20d7)\u03b4ij\u03b4ab. Using this relation, we can transform the corresponding complex Hamiltonian of the Lagrangian (2) by\nH \u2192 e\u03b7\u00b1He\u2212\u03b7\u00b1 , (5) \u03b7\u00b1 = \u220f3 a=1 exp ( \u00b1 \u03c02 \u222b d3x\u03a0a2\u03d5a2 ) ,\nwhere H is the field-theoretic Hamiltonian of our model (2), obtained via Legendre transformation. This non-uniqueness of the metric is analogous to\nthe non-uniqueness of the metric and its connection to the observables in the quantum mechanical setting discussed in [16, 24]. The adjoint action of \u03b7\u00b1 maps the complex action in the equation (2) into the following real action\ns = \u222b\nd4x 1 4Tr (D\u03d51) 2 \u2212 14Tr (D\u03d52) 2 (6)\n+c1 m21 4 Tr(\u03d5 2 1) \u2212 c2 m22 4 Tr(\u03d5 2 2) \u2212c3 \u00b52\n2 Tr(\u03d51\u03d52) \u2212 g 64 ( Tr(\u03d521) )2 \u2212 18Tr(F 2) \u2261 \u222b d4x\n1 4Tr (D\u03d51) 2 \u2212 14Tr (D\u03d52) 2\n\u2212V \u2212 18Tr(F 2).\nThe parameter c3 indicates the different similarity transformations by taking the values \u00b11 for \u03b7\u00b1, respectively.\nFor convenience, let us rewrite the above real action in terms of each component of the fields \u03d5ai as\nlad2 = 1 2(D\u00b5\u03d5i) aIij(D\u00b5\u03d5j)a + 1 2\u03d5 a i Hij\u03d5 a j (7)\n\u2212 g16 ( \u03d5ai Eij\u03d5 a j )2 \u2212 14F a\u00b5\u03bdF a\u00b5\u03bd , where the matrices H, I and E are defined as\nH := (\nm21 \u2212\u00b52 \u2212\u00b52 \u2212m22\n) , I := ( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) , (8)\nE := (\n1 0 0 0\n) .\n2.1. Higgs and gauge masses Next, we define the trivial solution of the equations of motion by solving \u03b4V = 0 and D\u00b5\u03d5i = 0. Such vacuum is often referred to as Higgs vacuum. The first equation can be simplified by choosing an Ansatz (\u03d50i )a(t, x\u20d7) = h0i r\u0302a(x\u20d7) where r\u0302 = (x, y, z)/ \u221a x2 + y2 + z2 and {h0i } are some constants to be determined. Note that the vacuum solution has a rotational symmetry SO(3) since r\u0302ar\u0302a = 1. Inserting this Ansatz into the equation (7), we find\nV = \u221212hiHijhj + g 16h 4 1. (9)\nThen the vacuum equation \u03b4V = 0 is reduced to simple coupled third order algebraic equations\ng 4(h 0 1)3 \u2212 c1m21h01 + c3\u00b52h02 = 0, (10)\nc2m 2 2h 0 2 + c3\u00b52h01 = 0,\nD\u00b5\u03d5\u03b1 = 0.\nThe resulting vacuum solutions are\nh02 = \u2212 c2c3\u00b5\n2\nm22 h01, (h01)2 = 4\nc2\u00b5 4+c1m21m 2 2\ngm22 := R2, (11)\n(A0i )a = \u2212 1er \u03f5 iaj r\u0302j + r\u0302aAi, (A00)a = 0.\nThe Ai are arbitrary functions of space-time. The Higgs particle can be identified with the fundamental fields of the theory after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the continuous symmetry SU(2) by Taylor expanding around the vacuum solution. Performing a Taylor expansion around the Higgs vacuum and keeping a focus on the second-order terms with only matter fields \u03d5ai , the real Lagrangian (7) contains the following term\ns = \u222b\nd4x 1 2\u03d5 a i\n( \u2212\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u00b5Iij\u03b4ab \u2212 H\u0303abij ) \u03d5bj + . . . ,\nwhere H\u0303 is a 6 \u00d7 6 block diagonal Hermitian matrix. After diagonalising the above term by redefining the fields with the eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian mass matrix Mabij := Iik\u03b4acH\u0303cbkj , we find that the masses of the fundamental fields after the symmetry breaking to be equal to the eigenvalues of Mabij given as\nm20 = c2 \u00b54 \u2212 m42\nm22 , m2\u00b1 = K \u00b1\n\u221a K2 + 2L, (12)\nwhere K = c1m21 \u2212 c2 m22 2 + 3\u00b54 2c2m22 and L = \u00b54 + c1c2m 2 1m 2 2. Notice that we only find three non-zero eigenvalues. The redefined fields with zero masses (eigenvalues) are called Goldstone fields, which can be absorbed into gauge fields Aa\u00b5 by defining the new massive gauge fields. This process of giving mass to the previously massless fields is called the Higgs mechanism. The mass of the gauge fields can be found by expanding the kinetic term of \u03d5 around the Higgs vacuum \u03d50i = h0i r\u0302a. Without loss of generality, we can choose a particular direction of the vacuum by taking r\u0302 = (0, 0, 1)T . This is possible due to the symmetry of the SO(3) vacuum as discussed above. Keeping the term only quadratic in the gauge field, we find\n1 2(D\u00b5\u03d5i + D\u00b5\u03d5 0 i )aIij(D\u00b5\u03d5i + D\u00b5\u03d50i )a (13)\n= 12 ( eA\u00b5 \u00d7 \u03d50i )a Iij (eA\u00b5 \u00d7 \u03d50j)a + . . . = 12e 2h0i Iijh0j ( A1\u00b5A 1\u00b5 + A2\u00b5A2 \u00b5 ) + . . . = 12m 2 g ( A1\u00b5A 1\u00b5 + A2\u00b5A2 \u00b5 ) + . . . ,\nwhere the mass of the gauge field is identified to be mg := \u221a h0i Iijh0j = e R \u221a m42\u2212\u00b54 m22 .\n2.2. t\u2019Hooft-Polyakov monopole To find the monopole solutions, let us consider the following Ansatz\n(\u03d5cli )a(x\u20d7) = hi(r)r\u0302a , (Acli )a = \u03f5iaj r\u0302jA(r) , (14) (Acl0 )a = 0,\nwhere the subscript cl denotes the classical solutions to the equations of motion (4). The difference between this Ansatz (14) and the Higgs vacuum (11)\nis that the quantity hi now depends on the spatial radius hi = hi(r). Here we are only considering the static Ansatz to simplify our calculation, but one may, of course, also consider the time-dependent solution by utilising the Lorentz symmetry of the model and performing a Lorentz boost. According to Derrick\u2019s scaling argument [25], for the monopole solution to have finite energy, we require the two matter fields of the equation (14) to approach the vacuum solutions in the equation (11) at spatial infinity\nlim r\u2192\u221e h1(r) = h0\u00b11 = \u00b1R , (15)\nlim r\u2192\u221e\nh2(r) = h0\u00b12 = \u2213 c2c3\u00b5\n2\nm22 R.\nAlso, notice that at some fixed value of the radius r, the vacuum solutions \u03d50\u03b1 and monopole solutions \u03d5cl\u03b1 both belongs to the 2-sphere in the field configuration space. For example, \u03d501 belongs to the 2-sphere with radius R because (\u03d501)2 = R2. Therefore, solutions \u03d5cli can be seen as a mapping between 2-sphere in spacetime (where the radius is given by the profile function hi) to 2-sphere in field configuration space. Such mapping has a topological number called the winding number n \u2208 Z, which can be explicitly realised by redefining the unit vector r\u0302a as\nr\u0302an =  sin(\u03b8) cos(n\u03c6)sin(\u03b8) sin(n\u03c6) cos(\u03b8)  . (16) Therefore different n represent topologically inequivalent solutions.\nSince we require the monopole and vacuum solutions to smoothly deformed into each other at spacial infinity, both solutions need to share the same winding number. It is important to note that winding numbers of \u03d51 and \u03d52 need to be equal to satisfy D\u03d51 = D\u03d52 = 0, and therefore we will denote the winding numbers of \u03d51 and \u03d52 as n collectively. If they are not equal, we would have D\u03d51 = 0 but D\u03d52 \u0338= 0. Next, let us insert our Ansatz equation (14) into the equations of motion equation (4). We will also redefine the Ansatz for the gauge fields to be Aai = \u03f5aibr\u0302b ( 1\u2212u(r)\ner\n) , Aa0 = 0, which are more in line\nwith the original Ansatz given in [26, 27], compared to equation (14). Inserting these expressions into the equations of motion equation (4), we find\nu \u2032\u2032 (r) +\nu(r) [ 1 \u2212 u2(r) ] r2\n(17)\n+e 2u(r) 2 { h22(r) \u2212 h21(r) } = 0,\nh \u2032\u2032 1 (r) + 2h \u2032 1(r) r \u2212 2h1(r)u2(r) r2 (18) +g { \u2212c1 m 2 1 g h1(r) + c3 \u00b52 g h2(r) + 1 4 h 3 1(r) } = 0,\nh \u2032\u2032 2 (r) + 2h\u20322(r) r \u2212 2h2(r)u 2(r) r2\n(19) +c2m22 { h2(r) + c3 \u00b52\nm22 h1(r)\n} = 0.\nNotice that these differential equations are similar to the ones discussed in [26, 27], but with the extra field h2 and extra differential equation (19). In the Hermitian model, the exact solutions to the differential equations were found by taking the parameter limit called the BPS limit [26, 27], where parameters in the Hermitian model are taken to zero while keeping the vacuum solution finite. Here we will follow the same procedure and take the parameter limit where quantities in the curly brackets of equations (18) and (19) vanish but keep the vacuum solutions equation (11) finite. We will see in section 2.4 that we also find the approximate solutions in this limit.\n2.3. The energy bound Surprisingly, by utilising Derrick\u2019s scaling argument, one can find the lower bound of the monopole energy without the explicit form of the solution.\nThe energy of the monopole can be found by inserting the monopole solution into the corresponding Hamiltonian of equation (6).\nh = \u222b d3x Tr ( E2 ) + Tr ( B2 ) (20)\n+Tr { (D0\u03d51)2 } + Tr { (Di\u03d51)2 }\n\u2212Tr { (D0\u03d52)2 } \u2212 Tr { (Di\u03d52)2 } + V,\nwhere E, B are Eia = Fa0i , Bia = \u2212 12 \u03f5 ijkF jka , i, j, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. The gauge is fixed to be the radiation gauge (i.e Aa0 = 0, \u2202iAai = 0). Notice that our monopole Ansatz equation (10) is static with no electric charge Eai = 0 and therefore, the above Hamiltonian reduces to\nE = \u222b d3x Tr ( B2 ) + Tr { (Di\u03d51)2 } (21)\n\u2212Tr { (Di\u03d52)2 } + V\n= 2 \u222b d3x Bi aBi a + (Di\u03d51)a(Di\u03d51)a\n\u2212(Di\u03d52)a(Di\u03d52)a + 1 2V.\nHere, we simplified our expression by dropping the superscripts Acli \u2192 Ai , \u03d5cl\u03b1 \u2192 \u03d5\u03b1. We also keep in mind that these fields depend on the winding numbers n \u2208 Z. In the Hermitian model (i.e. when \u03d52 = 0), one can rewrite the kinetic term as B2 + D\u03d52 = (B \u2212 D\u03d5)2 + 2BD\u03d5 and find the lower bound to be\u222b\n2BD\u03d5. Here we will follow a similar procedure but introduce some arbitrary constant \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R such that B2 = \u03b12B \u2212 \u03b22B where \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b22 = 1. This will allow\nus to rewrite the above energy as\nE = 2 \u222b d3x \u03b12 { Bi a + 1\n\u03b1 (Di\u03d51)a\n}2 (22)\n\u2212\u03b22 { Bi a + 1\n\u03b2 (Di\u03d52)a }2 +2 {\u2212\u03b1Bia(Di\u03d51)a + \u03b2Bia(Di\u03d52)a} +\n1 2V.\nTo proceed from here, we need to assume extra constraints on \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that the following inequalities are true\u222b\nd3x \u03b12 { Bi a + 1\n\u03b1 (Di\u03d51)a\n}2 (23)\n\u2212\u03b22 { Bi a + 1\n\u03b2 (Di\u03d52)a }2 \u2265 0,\u222b\nd3xV \u2265 0.\nWith these constraints we can now write down the lower bound of the monopole as\nE \u2265 2 \u222b d3x {\u2212\u03b1Bia(Di\u03d51)a + \u03b2Bia(Di\u03d52)a} (24)\n= 2 \u222b d3x \u2212 \u03b1 { Bi a\u2202i\u03d5 a 1 + eBia\u03f5abcAib\u03d5c1 } +\u03b2 { Bi a\u2202i\u03d5 a 2 + eBia\u03f5abcAib\u03d5c2\n} = 2 \u222b d3x \u2212 \u03b1 { Bi a\u2202i\u03d5 a 1 + ( \u2212e\u03f5abcAibBic ) \u03d5a1\n} +\u03b2 { Bi a\u2202i\u03d5 a 2 + ( \u2212e\u03f5abcAibBic ) \u03d5a1\u03d5 c 2 }\n= 2 \u222b d3x \u2212 \u03b1 {Bia\u2202i\u03d5a1 + \u2202iBia\u03d5a1}\n+\u03b2 {Bia\u2202i\u03d5a2 + \u2202iBia\u03d5a1} = 2 \u222b d3x \u2212 \u03b1\u2202i (Bia\u03d51a) + \u03b2\u2202i (Bia\u03d52a)\n= lim r\u2192\u221e\n( \u22122\u03b1 \u222b Sr dSiBi a\u03d51 a + 2\u03b2 \u222b Sr dSiBi a\u03d52 a ) ,\nwhere in the fourth line, we used DiBai = 0, which can be shown from the Bianchi identity D\u00b5\u03f5\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F a\u03c1\u03c3 = 0. The last line is obtained by using the Gauss theorem at some fixed value of the radius r. Since the \u03d5ai in the integrand is only defined over the 2-sphere with a large radius, we can use the asymptotic conditions (15) and replace the monopole solutions {\u03d5a\u03b1, Bai } with the Higgs vacuum {(\u03d50\u03b1)a, (B0i )a}\nE \u2265 ( \u22122\u03b1\u03d501 a + 2\u03b2\u03d502 a) lim\nr\u2192\u221e \u222b Sr dSi(B0i )a (25)\n= ( \u22132\u03b1Rr\u0302an \u2213 2\u03b2 c2c3\u00b5 2\nm22 Rr\u0302an\n) lim\nr\u2192\u221e \u222b Sr dSi(B0i )a,\nwhere the upper and lower signs of the above energy correspond to the upper and lower signs of the vacuum solutions in equation (11). The explicit value of Ba0i can be obtained by inserting the Higgs vacuum (11) into the definition of the magnetic field\nBai = \u2212 1 2\u03f5i jk (\u2202jAk \u2212 \u2202kAj + eAj \u00d7 Ak)a . (26)\nAfter a lengthy calculation, this expression can be simplified to Ba0i = \u03d5\u03020 a bi = r\u0302anbi, where \u03d5\u03020 a is a nor-\nmalised solution \u2211\na \u03d5\u0302 0a\u03d5\u03020 a = 1. The bi is defined\nas\nbi \u2261 \u2212 1 2\u03f5ijk\n{ \u2202jAk \u2212 \u2202kAj + 1\ne r\u0302n \u00b7\n( \u2202j r\u0302n \u00d7 \u2202kr\u0302n )} .\n(27) Where A was defined in equation (11). Notice that integrating the first term over the 2-sphere gives zero by Stoke\u2019s theorem \u222b S \u2202 \u00d7 A = \u222b \u2202S A = 0, where one can show that Stoke\u2019s theorem on the closed surface gives zero by dividing the sphere into two open surfaces. The second term is a topological term which can be evaluated as\u222b\ndSiBi = \u2212 4\u03c0n\ne . (28)\nThe explicit calculation is in [28]. This is the magnetic charge of the monopole solutions. Therefore integer n, which corresponds to the winding number of the solution, comes from the Ansatz Bai = \u03d5\u03020 a bi. In our case, there is an ambiguity of whether to choose Bai = \u03d5\u030201 a bi or Bai = \u03d5\u030202 a bi. Now we see explicitly the reason why we choose to keep the same integer values for solutions \u03d501 and \u03d502. If the integer values of r\u0302an in solutions \u03d501, \u03d502 are different, then the integration\u222b\nSr dSi(B0i )a will be different, leading to inconsistent energy. Finally, we find our lower bound of the monopole energy\nE \u2265 \u22132R ( \u03b1 + \u03b2 c2c3\u00b5 2\nm22\n) r\u0302anr\u0302 a n ( \u22124\u03c0n\ne\n) (29)\n= \u00b18\u03c0nR e\n( \u03b1 + \u03b2 c2c3\u00b5 2\nm22\n) .\nNotice that we have some freedom to choose \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R as long as our initial assumptions (23) are satisfied. We will see in the next section that we can take a parameter limit of our model, which saturates the above inequality and gives exact values to \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n2.4. The fourfold BPS scaling limit Our main goal is now to solve the coupled differential equations (17)-(19). Prasad, Sommerfield, and Bogomolny [26, 27] managed to find the exact solution by taking the parameter limit, which simplifies the differential equations. The multiple scaling limit is taken so that all the parameters of the model tend to zero with some combinations of the parameter remaining finite. The combinations are taken so that the vacuum solutions stay finite in this limit. Inspired by this, we will take here a fourfold scaling limit\ng, m1, m2, \u00b5 \u2192 0 , m21 g < \u221e , \u00b5 2 g < \u221e , \u00b5 2 m22 < \u221e. (30) This will ensure that the vacuum solutions equation (11) stays finite, but crucially the curly bracket parts\nin equations (18) and (19) vanish. There is a physical motivation for this limit in which the mass ratio of the Higgs and gauge mass are taken to be zero (i.e. mHiggs << mg) as described in [29]. We will see in the next section that the same type of behaviour is present in our model, hence justifying equation (30). The resulting set of differential equations, after taking the BPS limit, is similar to the ones considered in [26, 27] with the slightly different quadratic term in equation (17). It is natural to consider a similar Ansatz as given in [26, 27]\nu(r) = evrsinh (evr) , (31)\nh1(r) = \u2212\u03b1f(r), (32) h2(r) = \u2212\u03b2f(r), (33)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 R were introduced in section 2.3 and f(r) \u2261 { v coth (evr) \u2212 1er } . One can check that this Ansatz indeed satisfies differential equations equation (17)-(19) in the BPS limit. We have decided to put a prefactor \u03b1 and \u03b2 in front of equations (32) and (33) to satisfy the differential equation (17). Note that if we take \u03b1 = 1, we get exactly the same as given in [26, 27], which is known to satisfy the first-order differential equation called the Bogomolny equation Bi \u2212 Di\u03d5 = 0. The Ansatz (31)-(33) only differs from the ones given in [26, 27] by the prefactors \u03b1 and \u03b2, and therefore our Ansatz should satisfy the Bogomolny equation with the appropriate scaling to cancel the prefactor in equations (32) and (33)\nBbi + 1 \u03b1 (Di\u03d51)b = 0, (34) Bbi + 1 \u03b2 (Di\u03d52)b = 0, (35)\nwhere \u03d5\u03b1 \u2261 h\u03b1(r)r\u0302n. If we compare these equations to the terms appearing in the energy of the monopole equation (22), then we can saturate the inequality in equation (29) by\nE[\u03d51, \u03d52] = \u00b18\u03c0nR\ne\n( \u03b1 + \u03b2 c2c3\u00b5 2\nm22\n) , (36)\nwhere upper and lower signs correspond to the vacuum solutions equation (11), when taking the square root. We can calculate the explicit forms of \u03b1 and \u03b2 by comparing the asymptotic conditions in equation (15)\nlim r\u2192\u221e h\u00b11 = h 0\u00b1 1 = \u00b1R, (37)\nlim r\u2192\u221e h\u00b12 = h 0\u00b1 2 = \u2213\nc2c3\u00b5 2\nm22 R,\nwith the asymptotic values of equations (31)-(33)\nlimr\u2192\u221e u(r) = 0 , limr\u2192\u221e h\u00b11 (r) = \u2212\u03b1v, (38) limr\u2192\u221e h\u00b12 (r) = \u2212\u03b2v.\nBy Derrick\u2019s scaling argument, the two asymptotic values (37) and (38) should match, resulting in algebraic equations for \u03b1 and \u03b2. Using \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b22 = 1\nand assuming m42 \u2265 \u00b54, we find the four set of real solutions\n\u03b1 = \u2213(\u00b1)m 2 2\nl , v = (\u00b1) Rl m22 , \u03b2 = \u00b1(\u00b1)c2c3\u00b5\n2\nl ,\n(39) where l = \u221a m42 \u2212 \u00b54. The plus-minus signs in the brackets correspond to the two possible solutions to the algebraic equation \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b22 = 1. These need to be distinguished from the upper and lower signs of \u03b1 and \u03b2, which correspond to the vacuums solutions (11). Inserting the explicit values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 to the energy equation (36) we find\nE[\u03d51, \u03d52] \u2261 (\u00b1) 8\u03c0nR em22\n( \u2212m42 + \u00b54\nl\n) (40)\n= (\u00b1)\u22128\u03c0nR em22 l,\nwith corresponding solutions\nh\u00b11 (r) = \u00b1(\u00b1) m22 l\n[ Rl\nm22 coth\n( eRl\nm22 r\n) \u2212 1\ner\n] , (41)\nh\u00b12 (r) = \u2213(\u00b1) c2c3\u00b5\n2\nl\n[ Rl\nm22 coth\n( eRl\nm22 r\n) \u2212 1\ner\n] .\nIt is crucial to note that although it seems like there are two monopole solutions {h\u00b11 , h \u00b1 2 }, the two solutions are related non-trivially in their asymptotic limit by the constraint limr\u2192\u221e h\u00b12 = (\u2212c2c3\u00b52/m22) limr\u2192\u221e h\u00b11 given in equation (10). For example, one can not choose {h+1 , h \u2212 2 } as a solution as this will break the asymptotic constraint. The solution (41) can be constrained further by imposing that the energy (40) is real and positive.\nE[\u03d51, \u03d52] > 0 =\u21d2 \u2212(\u00b1) 8\u03c0nR em22 l =\u21d2 \u2212(\u00b1)n > 0. (42)\nTherefore we can ensure positive energy if (\u00b1) = sign(n). The final form of the monopole solution with positive energy are\nh\u00b11 (r) = \u00b1sign(n) m22 l\n[ Rl\nm22 coth\n( eRl\nm22 r\n) \u2212 1\ner\n] , (43)\nh\u00b12 (r) = \u2213sign(n) c2c3\u00b5\n2\nl\n[ Rl\nm22 coth\n( eRl\nm22 r\n) \u2212 1\ner\n] .\nwith energy E = 8|n|\u03c0lR/em22. We conclude this subsection by observing that the above solution depends on the parameter c3, which takes value {\u22121, 1} depending on the choice of the similarity transformation. Choosing a different values of c3 also result in a different asymptotic values (37), meaning solutions for c3 = 1 and c3 = \u22121 are topologically different. Since the energy is independent of c3, two distinct solutions share the same energy. Respecting one of the main features of similarity transformation, which is to preserve the energy of the transformed Hamiltonian.\nIn the next section, we will investigate in detail how the solution changes and a new CPT symmetry emerges by changing the parameter values."

            "text": "This section will investigate the behaviour of solution (43) in different regimes of the parameter spaces. We will compare the physical regions of gauge particles, Higgs particles and monopoles found in the previous section. We will see that the two regions coincide, but the solutions in different regions possess different CPT symmetries. Different symmetries of solutions in different regions are not coincident, but the consequence of the three reality conditions stated in the introduction. In fact, it is deeply related to the real value of energy, which will be discussed extensively in [30].\n3.1. Higgs mass and exceptional points Let us recall the masses of the particles and monopole\nm20 = c2 \u00b54\u2212m42\nm22 , m2\u00b1 = K \u00b1\n\u221a K2 + 2L, (44)\nmg = e Rlm22 , Mmono = 8|n|\u03c0lR em22 .\nwhere K = c1m21 \u2212 c2 m22 2 + 3\u00b54 2c2m22 and L = \u00b54 + c1c2m 2 1m 2 2. Notice that the masses do not depend on c3, meaning they do not depend on the similarity transformation as expected. We also comment that in the BPS limit, we have m0 = m\u00b1 = 0, but mg and M\u00b1 stays finite, such that the ratios mHiggs/mg vanish in the BPS limit. This is in line with the Hermitian case [29], providing the physical interpretation with mHiggs << mg for the BPS limit.\nOne may notice that when c2 = 1, requiring positive mass m20 > 0, implies that \u00b54 \u2212 m42 > 0. This means the quantity l = \u221a m42 \u2212 \u00b54 is purely imaginary. One may then discard this region as unphysical. However, we will see in the next section that there is a disconnected region beyond \u00b54 \u2212 m42 > 0, which admit real energy because R also becomes purely complex. This is not coincident, and in fact, we will see an emerging new CPT symmetry for the monopoles.\nIn the rest of the section, we will exclusively focus on the monopole and gauge masses. The main\nmessage of this section is the emerging symmetry responsible for the real value of the monopole masses. The requirement to make the whole theory physical demands also to consider the intersection of the physical regions between monopole masses and Higgs masses. As an example, we plot all the masses of the theory in Figure 1.\nAs one can see, intersection points of the physical regions of Higgs masses and monopole/gauge masses are non-trivial. In fact, they are bounded by two types of exceptional points. The first type is when two masses of Higgs particles coincide and form a complex conjugate pair. Such a point is known as an exceptional point where the mass matrix is non-diagonalisable, and the corresponding eigenvectors coincide. The second type is when the gauge and the monopole masses vanishes. Interestingly, this is where one of the Higgs masses also vanish. Since the mass matrix already has a zero eigenvalue, as the result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, it seems the number of massless fields is increased. However, at this point, the mass matrix is also non-diagonalisable. Therefore one can not diagonalise the Hamiltonian to identify the field which corresponds to the extra massless fundamental field. Therefore this point is also an exceptional point. However, the eigenvalues do not become complex conjugate pairs beyond this point, and as one can see from Figure 1 that one of the mass square m20 become negative, and gauge and monopole masses become complex but with no conjugate pair. We dub such a point as zero exceptional point to distinguish from the standard exceptional point.\n3.2. Change in CPT symmetry and complex monopole solution\nWe begin by introducing the useful quantities m21/g \u2261 X, \u00b52/g \u2261 Y, \u00b52/m22 \u2261 Z. The gauge mass, monopole mass and monopole solutions can be rewritten in terms of these quantities\nmg = eR \u221a 1 \u2212 Z2, mmono = 8|n|\u03c0R\ne\n\u221a 1 \u2212 Z2, (45)\nh\u00b11 (r) = \u00b1 sign(n)\u221a 1 \u2212 Z2\n[ R \u221a 1 \u2212 Z2coth(r\u0302) \u2212 1\ner\n] , (46)\nh\u00b12 (r) = \u2213 sign(n)c2c3Z\u221a\n1 \u2212 Z2\n[ R \u221a 1 \u2212 Z2coth(r\u0302) \u2212 1\ner\n] , (47)\nwhere R2 = 4(c2ZY + c1X) and r\u0302 = eR \u221a\n1 \u2212 Z2r. The monopole masses are plotted against the gauge mass for fixed parameters with n \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4} in Figure 2 with weak and strong couplings e = 2, e = 10. Notice that the gauge mass is smaller than any of the monopole masses for weak coupling, but when e is large enough, some of the monopole masses can become smaller than the gauge mass. This is clear by inspecting the monopole, and gauge mass in equation (45) and two masses coincide when e = \u221a 8|n|\u03c0. Note that n = 0 is not a monopole mass as it corresponds to the solution with zero winding number, which is topologically equivalent to the trivial solution.\nFrom Figure 2, we also observe disconnected regions where both monopole and gauge masses become real to purely complex. A more detailed plot of this is shown in Figure 3. Region 2 is bounded by two points with lower bound \u00b52/m22 = 1 corresponding to the zero exceptional point where the vacuum manifolds stay finite (i.e. spontaneous symmetry breaking occur). However, the Higgs mechanism fails because the Hamiltonian is non-diagonalisable, as discussed in the previous section. The upper bounds correspond to the point where the vacuum manifold vanishes. Therefore, the spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur, implying that the gauge fields do not acquire\na mass through the Higgs mechanism, resulting in a massless gauge field. Most crucially, an interesting region (denoted by region 3 in Figure 4) reappears as one increases the value of Z. The profile function in region 3 is purely complex, which signals that this may lead to complex energies. However, as one can see from Figure 3, the energy is real. The reason for the real energy is that the conditions stated in the introduction hold. We will specify below the CPT symmetry responsible for the real value of the energy. Note that the profile function h2 only differ from h1 by some factor in front. Therefore we omitted it from the plot.\nAnother physical region is when c1 = \u2212c2 = \u22121. The monopole and gauge masses for this case is plotted in Figure 4. We observe almost an identical plot from the Figure 3 but with real and imaginary parts swapped. The profile functions also respect these changes as regions 1 and 3 no longer have a definite asymptotic value. The boundaries are unchanged, as one can see from the Figure 4.\nFinally, there is an interesting parameter point X = Y where region 2 vanishes (see Figure 5). The two boundaries Z2 = 1 and c2ZY + c1X = 0 coincide when X = Y and the zero exceptional point no longer exists because the spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur in this case.\nNext, let us explain the real value of the energies in different regions. First, to realise the conditions 1-3, stated in the introduction, we require the following\ntransformations\nh\u00b12 (r) \u2192 \u2212h \u00b1 2 (r) , h \u00b1 1 (r) \u2192 h \u00b1 1 (r) in region 1\nNo symmetry in region 2 h\u00b12 (r) \u2192 \u2212 ( h\u00b12 (r) )\u2217 , h\u00b11 (r) \u2192 ( h\u00b11 (r) )\u2217 in region 3 . By using the explicit forms of the solutions (46) and (47). We can show that the above transformations satisfy condition 2 stated in the introduction, in regions 1\nh\u00b12 (r) \u2192 \u2212h \u00b1 2 (r) = h \u2213 2 (r) , h \u00b1 1 (r) \u2192 h \u00b1 1 (r), (48)\nand in region 3\nh\u00b12 (r) \u2192 \u2212 ( h\u00b12 (r) )\u2217 = h\u00b12 , (49) h\u00b11 (r) \u2192 ( h\u00b11 (r)\n)\u2217 = h\u22131 . Notice that in regions 1 and 3, the CPT relates two distinct solutions in two different ways. For example, h\u00b12 is mapped to h \u2213 2 in region 1, but it is mapped to itself in region 3. Finally, the condition 3 stated in the introduction is satisfied because the energy does not depend on the \u00b1 signs of the solutions. This explains the real energies of complex monopoles in region 3 and complex energy in region 2. Indeed, we observe the predicted behaviour in Figure 3. Region 2 is a hard barrier between two CPT symmetric regions where solutions are either real or purely imaginary. The same analysis can be carried out in the other physical region c1 = \u2212c2 = \u22121 where\nthe symmetry is now\nNo symmetry in region 1 h\u00b12 (r)\u2192\u2212(h\u00b12 (r))\u2217 h\u00b11 (r)\u2192(h\u00b11 (r))\u2217\nin region 2 No symmetry in region 3 . (50)\nWe have observed that one can find a well-defined monopole solution in two disconnected regions. However, in the full theory where we include the Higgs particles, it is only one of the regions which are considered physical. This is because the Higgs mass m20 is either positive or negative depending on which side of Z2 = 1 it is defined. Because two disconnected regions are defined on either side of the zero exceptional point Z2 = 1, the full physical region restricts one from moving region 1 to region 3 by changing Z. This is most clearly seen in Figure 1 where the plot of m20 (green line) becomes negative beyond the zero exceptional point. This may imply that the purely complex monopole solution we observed is not a possible solution of the theory. However, the purely complex solution can exist in the full physical region. An example of this is shown in the Figure 6 where we observe that the profile function h1 (therefore h2) is purely complex, and the Higgs masses, gauge mass are all real and positive."
