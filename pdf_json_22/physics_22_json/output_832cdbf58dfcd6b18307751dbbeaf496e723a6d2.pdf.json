            "text": "Quantum chromodynamics in three spacetime dimensions (QCD3) attracted in recent years a lot of attention (see [1] and references within). The vacuum structure of the theory is rich as it depends on the number of colours, the number of flavours, the Chern-Simons (CS) level, the representation of the quarks and their masses. One particular interesting variant of the theory is QCD with a single Majorana adjoint fermion. When the mass is large it can be integrated out, resulting in a shift of the ChernSimons level as follows\nk \u2192 k + sgn(m)12h(G) , (1.1)\nwhere h(G) is the dual Coexter number of the group. Due to the level shift it follows that the theory admits at least one phases transition as the mass of the fermion is varied. The phases of the theory were recently studied in [2], where it was argued that for k \u2265 12h(G) the theory admits two phases, while surprisingly for k < 12h(G) the theory admits three phases: apart from the large positive mass phase and the large negative mass phase, it admits an intermediate quantum phase. The physics in the vicinity of the two phase transitions is described by two dual theories. Follow-up papers which are relevant to the current work include the generalisations to two adjoint flavours [3] and to other two-index representations [4]. One of the striking results of [2] is that SU(N)0,1 with one adjoint fermion is not a confining theory. Instead, the IR of the theory is described by U ( N 2 ) N 2 ,N\nTQFT. As a result the Wilson loop in the fundamental representation shows a perimeter law. A\n1Throughout this paper we use the notation Gk for a level k Chern-Simons theory based on gauge group G.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\nNS\nelectric\nNS(1,k\u2019)\nN D3 N D3\n(1,k\u2019)\nmagnetic\n~\nFigure 1. Seiberg Duality from branes. The electric theory (left) is a U(N)k\u2032,k\u2032 gauge theory with one massive m2 g2 adjoint fermion and an additional light adjoint fermion. Similarly, the magnetic theory (right) is U(N\u0303)\u2212k\u2032,\u2212k\u2032 gauge theory with one massive m2 g2 adjoint fermion and an additional light adjoint fermion. k\u2032 = k +N/2.\nconvincing argument in favour of this result is anomaly matching: the UV theory cannot flow to a trivial theory in order to match the anomalous 1-form symmetry, see [5] for a recent discussion. In this note we use branes to re-derive the dualities of [2] as well as new dualities. We will use a 3d version of Seiberg duality, closely related to the Giveon-Kutasov duality [6]. The electric theory is U(N)k,2 (or USp(2N)2k, SO(2N)2k, SO(2N + 1)2k) with one adjoint fermion. The Seiberg dual for k \u2265 12h(G) is supersymmetric for a certain value of the fermion mass. The duality is valid in the vicinity of this value. As we shall see both electric and magnetic theories admit the same (Witten) index. Moreover, they both flow to the same IR theory. When k < 12h(G) (in analogy with Nf < Nc in 4d SQCD) supersymmetry is broken. Yet, we are able to recover two magnetic duals whose matter content was conjectured in [2]. Therefore, string theory beautifully recovers known dualities for k < 12h(G) and, moreover, predicts new dualities for k \u2265 12h(G) that can be verified by using several consistency checks such as anomaly matching, agreement of an index and the coincidence of the low energy dynamics at the weak coupling regime of large fermion mass. Throughout the paper we use h(U(N)) = N , h(USp(2N)) = 2N + 2, h(SO(2N)) = 2N \u2212 2. We use the convention USp(2) \u223c SU(2)."

            "text": "We derive the gauge theory dualities from a duality in string theory. Our setup is similar to that of refs. [7] and [8]. We consider \u2018electric\u2019 and \u2018magnetic\u2019 branes configurations as depicted in figure 1. The configurations consist of N (or N\u0303) D3 branes suspended between NS fivebrane and a tilted (1, k\u2032) fivebrane. The D3 branes span the 012 directions and a finite segment of the 6 direction. The NS fivebrane spans the 012345 directions. The\n2Here we specify the level of the SU(N) part. The U(1) level is rather subtle and will be discussed later.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\n(1, k\u2032) fivebrane spans the 01238 directions and it is tilted in the (59) plane with an angle \u2212\u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8. In order to preserve supersymmetry we choose tan \u03b8 = gsk\n\u2032. The content of the theory admits 3d N = 2 supersymmetry and it can be obtained by dimensional reduction of 4d N = 1 SYM. The CS interaction reduces the supersymmetrey to 3d N = 1. The Lagrangian of the theory may be written in terms of N = 1 supersymmetry as a level k\u2032 vector multiplet V = (A\u00b5, \u03c7) coupled to an adjoint scalar multiplet \u03a6 = (\u03c6, \u03c8). The action is given by3\nS = 14g2 \u222b d3x tr ( (D\u03c6)2 \u2212 F 2 + i\u03c7\u0304 /D\u03c7+ i\u03c8\u0304 /D\u03c8 + 2i\u03c7\u0304[\u03c6, \u03c8] ) (2.1)\n+ k \u2032\n4\u03c0 \u222b tr ( A \u2227 dA+ 23A \u2227A \u2227A ) \u2212 k \u2032 4\u03c0 \u222b d3x \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 .\nLet us begin with the electric theory. In order to obtain a low energy theory with a gauge group U(N) and a light adjoint fermion \u03c7, we choose k\u2032 = k + N/2. We then give a large negative mass to \u03c8. A mass term for the fermion that lives on the branes can be achieved by tilting the (1, k\u2032) fivebrane further, or by turning on background fluxes [11]. In particular in ref. [11] the authors discussed in detail how a 3-form background flux in type IIB can be used to give mass to matter that lives on D3 branes. The level of the SU(N) part is shifted by \u2212N/2 due to the integration over the massive adjoint fermion, \u03c8.4 Note that the U(1) level is not shifted because the adjoint fermion does not carry a U(1) charge. The resulting electric theory is a 3d N = 1 U(N)k,k\u2032 YM-CS theory. We follow the prescription of Elitzur-Giveon-Kutasov [12] and swap the fivebranes in order to obtain the Seiberg dual, see figure 1. We start with k \u2265 N/2 in order to preserve supersymmetry. The resulting magnetic dual is a N = 1 supersymmetric U(N\u0303)\u2212k\u0303,\u2212k\u2032 YMCS theory.5 As we swap the branes the number of D3 branes in the magnetic side becomes (similar to Nf \u2212Nc D4 branes in 4d SQCD [12])\nN\u0303 = k\u2032 \u2212N = k \u2212 12N . (2.2)\nThe level of the SU(N\u0303) part in the magnetic theory, k\u0303, is given by k\u2032 shifted due to the massive fermion in the scalar multiplet\nk\u0303 = k\u2032 \u2212 12N\u0303 = k + 1 2N \u2212 1 2 ( k \u2212 12N ) = 12k + 3 4N . (2.3)\nWe therefore propose the following Seiberg duality between two N = 1 supersymmetric YM-CS theories:\nU(N)k,k+ N2 \u21d0\u21d2 U(k \u2212N/2)\u2212( 12k+ 34N),\u2212(k+ N2 ) . (2.4)\nThe above duality (2.4) is the main result of this note. 3The same brane configuration was used in [9] to construct the Acharya-Vafa theory [10] of N = 1 SYM domain walls. 4It is also possible to begin with \u2212k\u2032 = \u2212k+N/2 and to give a positive mass to \u03c8. When we do so, the resulting dual magnetic theory covers a different range of masses of the electric theory. We will later refer to that theory as magnetic\u2019.\n5The levels of the magnetic theory are negative because the fundamental string ends on the left fivebrane, as opposed to the right fivebrane in the electric theory case. It is as if we integrated out an infinitely heavy massive flavour, with a negative mass.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\nThe first check of the duality (2.4) is the Witten index. The electric N = 1 U(N)k,k+ N2 theory as well as the U(k \u2212N/2)\u2212( 12k+ 34N),\u2212(k+ N2 ) admit the same Witten index [13\u201316]\nIW =\n( k + 12N ) !(\nk \u2212 12N ) !N ! . (2.5)\nThe Witten index can be derived from the brane configuration by using the s-rule and counting all possible ways the N (or N\u0303) D3 branes can end on the k + N/2 constituent fivebranes [17, 18]. Both the electric and magnetic descriptions lead to (2.5), in agreement with field theory. Let us briefly discuss the case with k < N/2. When we swap the fivebranes we obtain N\u0303 = k \u2212 12N anti D3 branes suspended between the fivebranes. The brane configuration breaks supersymmetry, in agreement with the expectation from the gauge dynamics of the electric theory when k < N/2. Typically a non-supersymmetric brane configuration is unstable and cannot be trusted, however in the current configuration the D3 branes are locked between the fivebranes and therefore the 3d field theory does not suffer from an instability. An analogoues scenario in 4d SQCD leads to Nc \u2212 Nf antibranes suspended between orthogonal NS fivebranes, however the situation in 4d is more complex because there are mesons and thus one may explain the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg runaway superpotential by a potential between branes.6 The 3d field theory that lives on the branes is a non-supersymmetric U(N/2 \u2212 k) 1\n2k+ 3 4N YM-CS theory with a Majorana adjoint fermion. Supersymmetry breaking occurs due to the interaction between the anti D3 branes and the fivebranes. Our results in section 4 for k < N/2 are in full agreement with the dualities proposed in [2] and reveals their string theory origin. Our picture and the conjectured dualities are supported by the gravity dual, proposed in [19]. The dual of SU(N)k with N = 1 supersymmetry is described by a confining geometry when k = N/2. When k is increased additional branes are added to the geometry in a SUSY preserving manner. When k is decreased antibranes are added and supersymmetry is broken. The emerging picture from our setup is essentially the same. The advantage of the current dualities over the holographic dual is that it applies to finite N as well as for a wide range of masses, hence it is useful for exploring phase transitions. In the following sections we will study the field theory dynamics of the electric and magnetic theories in more detail.\n3 Gauge dynamics when k \u2265 N/2\nThe electric U(N)k,k+N/2 theory is supersymmetric when the bare fermion mass is m = \u2212g2k. It is conjectured that the theory admits two phases. The low energy dynamics is characterised by two TQFT\u2019s. At large positive mass it is a U(N)k+N/2,k+N/2 TQFT and at large negative mass it is a U(N)k\u2212N/2,k+N/2 TQFT. The proposed magnetic dual describes the supersymmetric point and its vicinity. Starting with U(k\u2212N/2)\u2212( 12k+ 34N),\u2212(k+N/2) let us integrate out the massive adjont fermion. The\n6This argument is due to Shigeki Sugimoto.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\nm x\nU(N) + adjoint fermion\nm=\u2212g k (susy)\nk>N/2 2\n(fermion bare mass)\nU(N) k\u2212N/2,k+N/2\nU(N) k+N/2,k+N/2\nFigure 2.

The dual gauge theory (shaded ellipse) describes the phase with negative mass in the vicinity of the supersymmetric point. When k = N/2 the SU(N) IR theory is trivial (gapped).\nresulting theory is U(k\u2212N/2)\u2212N,\u2212(k+N/2) which is dual to U(N)k\u2212N/2,k+N/2 [20]. We obtained the IR TQFT in the vicinity of the supersymmetric electric theory by using the dual magnetic theory, see figure 2. In addition, at the supersymmetric point there is an additional adjoint fermion, as expected from the electric side. As we already discussed, the Witten index of the dual pair matches. At k = N/2 the dual magnetic theory is trivial, apart from a free massless U(1). This is not surprising: the SU(N) part of the electric theory is expected to confine and hence the IR is gapped, except a free U(1).\n4 Gauge dynamics when k < N/2\nWhen k < N/2 the electric theory admits three phases. In addition to the large positive mass and large negative masses, there is an intermediate quantum phase characterised by a TQFT [2], see figure 3\nU(N/2\u2212 k)N/2+k,N \u223c U(N/2 + k)\u2212N/2+k,\u2212N . (4.1)\nWithin this phase there exists a point with a massless Goldstino, due to the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry.\nNaively, the proposed dual YM-CS is U(N/2\u2212k) 1 2k+ 3 4N,k+N/2 with an adjoint fermion. However, such naive assignment of the U(1) level is not compatible with the dynamics of the electric theory. Since we have two magnetic duals we need to make sure that their U(1) levels reproduce correctly the intermediate phase. In order to have a consistent picture we need to assign a level N to the U(1) of the magnetic theory (and level \u2212N to the magnetic\u2019 theory). The shift of the U(1) level from its naive value of k+N/2 to the \u2018correct\u2019 N may be achieved by introducing a RR 0-form flux along the 6 direction, or perhaps a localised flux at the intersection of the D3 antibranes and the fivebrane\nS = \u222b dx6 \u222b d3xC0F \u2227 F = \u2212 \u222b dx6 dC0 \u222b d3xA \u2227 F .

The phase diagram of adjoint QCD with k < N/2. There are three phases, separated by two phase transitions denoted by blue dots. The supersymmetric point lies at m = \u2212g2k. The magnetic theory (shaded ellipse) describes the vicinity of the (broken-)supersymmetric point, at masses both below and above the phase transition. The magnetic\u2019 theory covers regions above and below the positive mass phase transition.\nThis is a subtle matter and a better understanding of non-supersymmetric brane configuration which include antibranes is needed.\nLet us integrate out the adjoint fermion. Positive and negative masses results in two TQFT. The negative mass results in U(N/2 \u2212 k)(k+N/2),N TQFT and the positive mass results in U(N/2\u2212 k)N,N (which is dual to SU(N)k\u2212N/2,\u2212N ). Thus the dual gauge theory describes two regimes of the three phases of the electric theory: the negative mass phase and the intermediate phase, see figure 3. In addition at some value of the mass there is a massless fermion which corresponds to the Goldstino of the electric theory. Similar to the magnetic theory, there exists a magnetic\u2019 theory that covers a regime of the positive mass phase and the intermediate mass phase. The details are as follows: the magnetic\u2019 theory is U(N/2 + k) 1\n2k\u2212 3 4N,\u2212N\nwith an adjoint fermion. After integrating out the massive fermion we end up with either U(N/2 + k)\u2212(N/2\u2212k),\u2212N TQFT or U ( k + 12N ) \u2212N,\u2212N\nTQFT. They describe (by virtue of level-rank duality) the U(N/2 \u2212 k)N/2+k,N and SU(N)k+ 12N phases of the electric theory, see figure 3.\nOur results in this section are in agreement with ref. [2]."

            "text": "The generalization to SO and USp theories is straightforward, yet we will encounter new phenomena. We use the same brane configuration that led to the U(N) dualities, with minor modifications. The USp theory is realized by adding to the brane configuration an O3+ plane along the 0126 directions. The orientifold plane does not tolerate a fractional brane, therefore we need to place N D3 branes and their mirrors, namely an even number of branes. The resulting theory is USp(2N). Similarly, SO(2N) and SO(2N + 1) theories are realized by\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\nplacing either even or odd number of D3 branes on top of an O3\u2212 plane. In both USp/So cases we will use a (1, 2k\u2032) tilted fivebrane.\n5.1 The USp(2N) theory\nWe begin with the electric theory. Let k\u2032 = k + 12(N + 1). The adjoint fermion with large negative mass shifts the level such that the resulting electric theory that lives on the brane configuration is USp(2N)2k. As we swap the fivebranes an additional D3 antibrane (and its mirror) is created between the fivebranes due to the presesnce of the orientifold plane. Therefore N\u0303 = k\u2032 \u2212 1 \u2212 N = k \u2212 12(N + 1) and k\u0303 = k \u2032 \u2212 12(N\u0303 + 1) = 1 2k + 3 4N + 1 4 . The resulting\nmagnetic theory is N = 1 supersymmetric USp ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N \u2212 1 2 )) \u22122( 12k+ 34N+ 14 )\nYM-CS theory, hence we propose the following Seiberg duality\nUSp(2N)2k \u21d0\u21d2 USp ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N \u2212 1 2 )) \u22122( 12k+ 34N+ 14 ) . (5.1)\nThe supersymmetric magnetic dual can be trusted when N\u0303 = k\u2212 12(N + 1) \u2265 0. By using the assignment N \u2192 N + 1, k \u2192 k + 1 with respect to the U(N)k case we propose an invariant index7\nI =\n( k + 12N + 3 2 ) !(\nk \u2212 12N + 1 2\n) !(N + 1)! . (5.2)\nBoth the electric and magnetic branes configurations yields the same result (5.2). The phase diagram of the USp(2N) theory is similar to U(N) theory. For a negative fermion mass, where the duality can be trusted, the IR theory is USp(2N)2(k\u2212 12 (N+1)) TQFT. The magnetic theory, upon integrating out the massive fermion, is USp ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N \u2212 1 2 )) \u22122N . The two descriptions agree thanks to level-rank duality\nUSp(2N)2(k\u2212 12 (N+1)) \u223c USp ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N \u2212 1 2 )) \u22122N . (5.3)\nWhen N\u0303 < 0 the magnetic brane configuration consists of anti D3 branes. It describes the electric theory when supersymmetry is dynamically broken. When anti D3 branes are placed on top of O3+ plane the gauge group is USp, but the fermion transforms in the twoindex antisymmetric representation [21], in agreement with the duality conjecture of [2].\nThe magnetic dual is therefore\nUSp ( 2 (1\n2N + 1 2 \u2212 k )) 2( 12k+ 34N+ 14 ) + antisymmetric fermion. (5.4)\nLet us integrate out the fermion in order to obtain the IR theory. The level is shifted as follows:\n1 2k + 3 4N + 1 4 \u2192 1 2k + 3 4N + 1 4 \u00b1 1 2(N\u0303 \u2212 1) . (5.5)\n7In USp/SO theories the index obtained from the branes is not the Witten index, but rather a bosonic index [16]. I thank Jaume Gomis and Zohar Komargodski for discussions on this matter.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3\nWe therefore obtain for the negative mass phase a TQFT as follows USp ( 2 (1\n2N + 1 2 \u2212 k )) 2N \u223c USp(2N)(2(k\u2212 12N\u2212 12 )) . (5.6)\nThe quantum intermediate phase is described by a TQFT USp ( 2 (1\n2N + 1 2 \u2212 k )) 2(k+ 12N+ 12 ) \u223c USp ( 2 ( k + 12N + 1 2 )) (2(k\u2212 12N\u2212 12 )) . (5.7)\nSimilar to the U(N) case we can use the brane configuration to introduce a magnetic\u2019 theory\nUSp ( 2 (1\n2N + 1 2 + k )) 2( 12k\u2212 34N\u2212 14 ) + antisymmetric fermion (5.8)\nthat covers the positive mass and the intermediate phase of the electric theory. The low energy of the magnetic and magnetic\u2019 theories matches the low energy of the electric theory.\n5.2 SO(2N) and SO(2N + 1) theories\nSimilar to the USp(2N) theory, we can study SO theories by placing N D3 branes and their mirrors on top of an O3\u2212 plane. The O3\u2212 tolarates a fractional D3 brane on it, hence we can use brane configurations to study both SO(2N) theories and SO(2N + 1) theories. In our discussion we use the notation SO(2N) with N either integer or half integer. We start with k\u2032 = k + 12(N \u2212 1). The discussion is almost identical to the discussion about USp(2N) theories. The main difference is that when the fivebranes are exchanged a D3 brane is created and hence the dual gauge group is SO(2N\u0303), with N\u0303 = k\u2032 + 1\u2212N = k \u2212 12(N \u2212 1) and k\u0303 = k\u2032 \u2212 12(N\u0303 \u2212 1) = 1 2k + 3 4N \u2212 1 4 . Therefore for N\u0303 > 0, when SUSY is not broken the duality is SO(2N)2k \u21d0\u21d2 SO ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N + 1 2 )) \u22122( 12k+ 34N\u2212 14 ) (5.9) with an index8\nI =\n( k + 12N \u2212 3 2 ) !(\nk \u2212 12N \u2212 1 2\n) !(N \u2212 1)! . (5.10)\nThe SUSY duality agrees about the low energy TQFT when the fermion mass is negative SO(2N)2(k\u2212 12 (N\u22121)) \u223c SO ( 2 ( k \u2212 12N + 1 2 )) \u22122N . (5.11)\nWhen N\u0303 is negative the dual magnetic theory lives on a collection of anti D3-branes placed on an O3\u2212 plane. It is SO ( 2 (\n1 2N \u2212 1 2 \u2212 k )) 2( 12k+ 34N\u2212 14 ) with a two-index symmet-\nric fermion. The magnetic\u2019 theory is SO ( 2 (\n1 2N \u2212 1 2 + k )) 2( 12k\u2212 34N\u2212 14 )\nwith a two-index symmetric fermion. Upon integration over the symmetric fermion the magnetic and magnetic\u2019 theories describe the vacua of the electric theory in its three phases.\n8The index calculated using branes is not the Witten index. It is rather a bosonic index, see [16] for a comprehensive discussion.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 7 3"

            "text": "In this note we used string theory to derive new dualities as well as to recover known dualities of adjoint 3d QCD. Branes turned out to be a very useful tool to uncover a broad picture, where known dualities can be explained in terms of 3d Seiberg duality (or Giveon-Kutasov duality). For k \u2265 12h(G) we found new supersymmetric dualities that hold even when a mass is given to the adjoint fermion, indicating that brane dynamics can be trusted even when supersymmetry is softly broken. For k < 12h(G) we found an interesting phenomenon: Seiberg duality can be extended to the regime where supersymmetry is dynamically broken. It suggests than in 4d SQCD the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential may be computed using a dual magnetic theory. While it is long known that string theory can be used to compute the ADS superpotential [22], the computation was carried out in the electric variables. It would interesting to generalise the results of this note to other representations (using other branes setups) and more flavours of adjoint fermions (by tilting the branes differently while preserving more supersymmetry). Another interesting direction of future work is to relate the brane dynamics to N = 1 supersymetric theories with flavour [23]."
