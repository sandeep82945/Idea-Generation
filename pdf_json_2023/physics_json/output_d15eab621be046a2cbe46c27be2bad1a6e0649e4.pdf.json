The obtained microalgae-based nitrogen-doped activated carbon has excellent electrochemical performance. It has the advantage of nitrogen self-doping using high elemental nitrogen in microalgae. In this study, two kinds of microalgae, Nanochloropsis and Chlorella, were used as feedstock for lipid extraction. The microalgae residue was firstly pyrolyzed at 500 \u25e6C to obtain biochar. Then, nitrogen-doped activated carbons were synthesized at an activation temperature of 700\u2013900 \u25e6C with different ratios of biochar and KOH (1:1, 1:2, and 1:4). The obtained carbon materials presented rich nitrogen functional groups, including quaternary-N, pyridine-N-oxide, pyrrolic-N, and pyridinic-N. The nitrogen content of microalgae-based activated carbon material was up to 2.62%. The obtained materials had a specific surface area of up to 3186 m2/g and a pore volume in the range of 0.78\u20131.54 cm3/g. The microporous pore sizes of these materials were distributed at around 0.4 nm. Through electrochemical testing such as cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge of materials, the materials exhibited good reversibility and high charge\u2013discharge efficiency. The sample, sourced from microalgae Chlorella residue at activation conditions of 700 \u25e6C and biochar/KOH = 1:4, exhibited excellent endurance of 94.1% over 5000 cycles at 2 A/g. Its high specific capacitance was 432 F/g at 1 A/g.",

            "text": "To address overconsumption of fossil resources, increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the rise in the Earth\u2019s temperature, many renewable energy technologies had been developed [1]. Microalgae are potential biomass feedstock for liquid biofuel production and industrially important by-products. Lipids in microalgae are generally used for biodiesel and liquid hydrocarbons via transesterification and hydrogenation/cracking processes. However, there are large amounts of defatted microalgae residue after extraction of lipids, which need further utilization with high added value [2]. Pyrolysis of microalgae residue can produce biochar, which can be further upgraded into activated carbon materials. Most of the pyrolysis reactions for microalgae and their defatted residue occurred at 400\u2013550 \u25e6C with inert environment [3]. Biochar was activated by activators such as KOH and KMnO4 into carbon materials that can be used as supercapacitors [4,5]. Supercapacitors can be divided into three categories including electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudocapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors [6]. Although EDLCs have high electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability, their specific\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28217280 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 2 of 18\ncapacitance (<400 F g\u22121) is generally lower [7]. The theoretical capacitance of pseudocapacitors (>1000 F g\u22121) is usually higher than that of EDLCs [8,9]. Pseudocapacitors generate and store electrical energy through a rapid reversible redox reaction at surface/near surface to obtain capacitance formed by metal oxides materials [10]. But attributed to agglomeration of particles, strain accumulations during charge\u2013discharge processes, and low conductivity of metal oxides, pseudocapacitors\u2019 practical performance was poor [11\u201313]. Therefore, these two energy storage mechanisms are combined by introducing heteroatoms into carbon materials, adjusting porosity of materials, or synthesizing a composite of carbon materials and metal oxides [14]. Heteroatom doping can significantly alter the elemental composition of carbon materials. Currently, heteroatom doping of carbon materials has been mainly studied by doping Nitrogen, Boron, Sulfur, and Platinum atoms [15\u201318]. Heteroatom doping, especially N doping, had shown a clear promise for high-performance supercapacitors and played an important role in carbon material doping [19]. For example, nitrogen- and oxygen-co-doped hierarchically porous carbon material from carbonization/activation of algae showed a high specific capacitance of 201 F/g at 1 A/g. In the meantime, its capacitance retention ratio was 61% at 100 A/g, and its capacitance loss was 9% after 10,000 cycles [20]. Nitrogen- and oxygen-doped hierarchically porous carbons from algae Enteromopha prolifera had a high capacitance of 234 F/g at 0.5 A/g and good cycling stability of 95% after 2000 cycles. Unique hierarchical nanopores in the carbon structure provided active sites for enhancing the diffusion rate of ions. These carbons had natural heteroatoms from algae-contributing pseudocapacitance [21]. One fact that should not be overlooked is that after the extraction of lipids from microalgae, the nitrogen content of the microalgal residue (5\u201312%) is higher than that of the raw microalgae. Therefore, it is necessary to research nitrogen distribution during pyrolysis and activation processes and its effect on pseudocapacitance activity. Nitrogen atoms introduced into carbon materials could be divided into chemical nitrogen and structural nitrogen [22]. In general, chemical nitrogen was found as nitrogen functional groups on the surface of materials, such as amino groups and nitroso groups. These nitrogen functional groups improved the surface hydrophilic properties of porous carbon materials. It likewise increased the compatibility of electrolytes and electrodes. Structural nitrogen is doped directly into the carbon skeleton and bonded to carbon atoms. There are four main types of structural nitrogen, including graphiticN, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and quaternary-N, and their function vary. Pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N were effective for improving pseudocapacitance activity [23], while graphiticN promoted the rapid transference of electrons in the carbon lattice, and quaternary-N improved the wettability between the material and the electrolyte [24]. During pyrolysis, there are different characteristics of migration and transformation for these nitrogen elements [25]. For example, high reaction pressures promoted the formation of pyrrolic-N and quaternary-N compounds in bio-oil and decreased pyridinic-N and nitrile-N compounds, while pyrrolic-N in biochars were transformed into pyridinic-N and quaternary-N at elevated pressures [26]. The step pyrolysis of N-rich industrial biowastes demonstrated that NH3-N was the main NOx precursor in gaseous products at lower temperatures, which was due to the decomposition of labile amide-N/inorganic-N in fuels, while two-step pyrolysis with low heating rates minimized NOx precursor yield by 36\u201343% with a greater impact on HCN-N (75\u201385%) than NH3-N (9\u201337%) [27]. Moreover, the distribution of nitrogen in biochars was also different in various reaction conditions [28,29]. For example, KOH dosage on the surface morphology, internal structure, and electrochemical performance of biomass-based nitrogen-doped carbon materials had significant influence. Graphitic-N (54.1\u201368.2 at %) accounted for a large proportion in structural nitrogen. However, with the increase in the mass ratio of KOH/porous carbon, the relative content of graphitic-N declined [30]. In the N-enriched pyrolysis of bamboo at the temperature of 400\u2013800 \u25e6C with the reaction environment of NH3, pyrolysis temperature apparently decreased the relative content of pyridinic-N, while the relative content of pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N-oxide increased gradually [31]. However, there is little information about the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 3 of 18\nrole of elemental nitrogen in improving the electrochemical properties for microalgae-based carbon materials. In this study, pyrolysis and activation of microalgae residue have been conducted at 500\u2013900 \u25e6C under nitrogen flow. The characteristics of microalgae-based N-doped carbon materials have been explored to reveal the N-type distribution and its effect on pseudocapacitance activity of carbon-based materials. Finally, the electrochemical performance of microalgae-based N-doped activated carbon materials (MNAC) has been evaluated in a three-electrode system and two-electrode system with electrolyte of 6 M KOH. The items tested were cyclic voltammetry (CV), single and multiple times of galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge cycling (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)."

            "text": "The porosity of MNAC samples was examined through N2 physisorption under the condition of 77 K liquid nitrogen. In Figure 1a,b, the N2 adsorption isotherms of MNAC were isotherms of Type I. It indicated that MNAC were typical microporous materials [32]. The adsorption and desorption isotherms had typical hysteresis loops (Type H4). In the N2 isotherms, the quantity adsorbed of N2 rose rapidly at low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.3). As the relative pressure gradually increased, the N2 isotherms were almost platform, indicating that the pore size distribution of MNAC samples was dominated by micropores, which was also observed in Figure 1c,d. It is worth noting that the two samples, N-800-1 and C-800-1, both with an activating agent ratio of 1:1, exhibited larger hysteresis loops, which was attributed to the smaller proportion of KOH increasing the proportion of mesopores, and a higher proportion of KOH easily led to the collapse of pores. KOH activation could effectively enlarge the surface areas and pore volumes of carbon materials [32]. 6KOH + 2C\u2192 2K + 3H2 + 2K2CO3 [33] is a conventional mechanism of carbon activation by KOH. In this reaction, potassium compounds as chemical activators etched the carbon structure by the redox reactions and then created a network of holes [34,35]. Small molecules from the decomposition of K2CO3 also created micropores. The prepared metal K was effectively intercalating into the carbon lattice of the carbon matrix during the activation process [36]. After washing off potassium ions and other potassium compounds with deionized water, the swollen carbon lattice would not be restored to its previous nonporous structure. Hence, a large surface area and pore volumes were created. In Figure 1c,d, the pore size distribution showed that the majority of pores were micropores (<2 nm), and the very few pores were mesopores (2\u201350 nm) and macropores (>50 nm). Meanwhile, Figure 1e,f presented that the micropore size distribution of the MNAC samples from microalgae Nanochloropsis and Chlorella all showed a peak at around 0.4 nm. All these results indicated that micropores were dominated in MNAC, which made a key contribution to the storage of charge in electrodes of EDLCs [37]. Such a pore size distribution was more conducive to the storage of charge and the transport of ions in electrochemical reactions. This is because, under low charge density, micropores were the main contributors to capacitors [13]. The micropores were mainly used for charge storage, trapping ions, and increasing capacitance, but they also impeded ion diffusion; the mesopores were responsible for ion transport and electron conduction, reducing the resistance to ion diffusion and providing a fast channel for ion diffusion [38]. However, the pore size distribution had a great impact on the specific capacitance of these carbon materials [39], which was explained in detail in Section 3.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 4 of 18Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 19\nFigure 1.

This indicated that part of the pore structure of carbon materials shifted from micropores to mesopores.

Other research had shown that the depth of the pores also determined the amount of charge accumulated on the inner wall of the pores [13], thus affecting the specific capacitance of carbon materials. When the size of the micropores matched the size of the electrolyte ions, it resulted in high transfer efficiency [38,40]. Thus, by combining with the data in Table 1 and the results of electrochemical testing in Section 3.4, it was found that the two samples with the highest specific capacitance, N-700-2 and C-800-2, had a micropore volume percentage of 78%, and their average pore diameters Dd were around 3.5 nm.

Figure 4 (Figures S4 and S5 of the Supplementary Materials) shows that\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 8 of 18\nthe N-containing constituents of activated carbons were mainly quaternary-N, pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, and pyridine-N-oxide. The results showed the formation of rich nitrogencontaining functional groups on the carbon framework. The nitrogenous structure, especially negatively charged pyrrole-N and pyridine-N in carbon materials, provided more active sites for faradaic pseudocapacitor reactions, while quaternary-N promoted the transport of electrons in the carbon lattice [24]. Pyrrole-N is more stable than pyridine-N, and its effect on oxygen reduction is also greater. In combination with the electrochemical performance of MNAC materials prepared at activation temperature of 800 \u25e6C, it could be concluded that the actual capacitance Cm of the MNAC varied with the total content of pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N in the MNAC materials. The reason may be due to the larger binding energy of pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N with ions in the electrolyte, such as the potassium ions in the KOH electrolyte in this experiment [41]. Even for a given surface area of electrodes, larger binding energy allowed a larger number of ions to be accommodated on the electrode surface, thus contributing to higher capacitance. Pyridine-N-oxide and quaternary-N are positively charged, facilitating the transfer of electrons through the carbon and improving capacitive performance under high current loads [42]. As shown in Table 3, N-Q (quaternary-N) was more stable under high-temperature pyrolysis relative to N-5 (pyrrolic-N) and N-6 (pyridinic-N). Pyridine-N-oxide and quaternary-N also provided excellent capacitance retention, while the presence of quaternary-N could enhance the electron transfer and conductivity of carbon materials, resulting in enhanced capacitance performance [10].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 9 of 18\nTable 3.

Before each experiment, both microalgae samples were dried at 105 \u25e6C for 24 h. The extraction of lipids was conducted via organic solvent extraction method. The used organic solvents were CH2Cl2 (analytical reagent, >99%) and CH3OH (analytical reagent, >99%), which were mixed into 300 mL of organic solution according to the volume ratio of 1:2. About 15 g of microalgae powder was mixed with the organic solvent and extracted in an ultrasonic machine for 120 min. The temperature of the extraction system was maintained at 20 \u25e6C through a water bath. After extraction, the resulting mixture was centrifuged for 12 min at 6500 rpm to separate solid product from organic solvent, and the solid product was washed with deionized water and centrifuged several times to remove any residual organic solvent. Finally, the solid product was dried at 80 \u25e6C in an electrothermal blowing dry box to obtain dried microalgae residue. About 10.5 g of microalgae residue was obtained after\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7280 14 of 18\nlipid extraction of 15 g of microalgae powder. The yield was approximately 70%. The composition of microalgae Nanochloropsis and Chlorella and their profiling of amino acids are shown in Tables S1 and S2 of the Supplementary Materials. The lipid content of microalgae was determined by the method of organic solvent extraction. The organic solvents were the previously mentioned methanol and dichloromethane. The mass balance method was used to calculate carbohydrate content. The premise is that the sum content of protein, lipid, water, and ash in microalgae was 100%. Microalgae were completely burned in a muffle furnace to determine their ash content. The elementary analysis (C, H, S, and N) of microalgae Nanochloropsis and Chlorella was performed by an elemental analyzer (Thermo Scientific FlashSmart, Stoney Creek, NC, USA). The amino acid composition of microalgae was determined by an amino acid analyzer (MembraPure A300, Berlin, Germany)."

The heating rate of the furnace was 5 \u25e6C/min. After pyrolysis with 10.5 g of microalgae residue, about 3.2 g of biochar could be obtained, indicating that the yield of biochar was approximately 30%. Then, the obtained biochar was mixed with the activating agent potassium hydroxide (KOH) in ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 in the form of powder. The mixture was put into a crucible of the same size. Finally, the crucible was put back into the furnace and activated at 700 \u25e6C, 800 \u25e6C, or 900 \u25e6C for 1 h. Both the nitrogen flow rate (400 mL/min) and the heating rate (5 \u25e6C/min) were the same as the pyrolysis process.
