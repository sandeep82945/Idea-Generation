 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Develop new algorithms for solving two-player games that are more efficient than DFPN and its variants. The paper shows DFPN is not always complete, so exploring new algorithms could lead to better performance.

2. Apply the adapted DFPN* algorithm to other domains beyond retrosynthesis to demonstrate its general applicability. The paper shows it works for chemistry, but testing it in other planning/search problems could be useful. 

3. Further analyze the diversity of solutions generated by DFPN* and other algorithms. The paper uses a simple metric of unique intermediate molecules, but more sophisticated diversity measures could be developed. 

4. Experiment with different parameter settings in DFPN* to optimize the diversity-computation time tradeoff. The penalties pAND and pOR likely have an impact but are not thoroughly studied.

5. Incorporate machine learning into the adapted DFPN* algorithm. The paper uses a neural network to estimate reaction probabilities, but machine learning could potentially also help guide the search for diverse solutions.
