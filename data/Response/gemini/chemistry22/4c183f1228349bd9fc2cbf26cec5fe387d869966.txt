1. **Investigate the antifungal activity of the tricin derivative flavonoid and the loliolide terpenoid:** These compounds were found only in healthy plant samples and may play a role in the plant's defense against fungal infection. Further research could investigate their antifungal activity against a wider range of fungi and explore their potential use as natural antifungal agents.


2. **Evaluate the metabolic changes in response to different types of fungal infections:** The study focused on a single type of fungal infection. Future research could investigate how the metabolic profile of Orchidaceae species changes in response to different types of fungal infections, such as those caused by different species of fungi or different strains of the same species. This could provide insights into the plant's defense mechanisms and help identify potential targets for antifungal therapies.


3. **Explore the role of stilbenoids in the defense response of Orchidaceae species:** Stilbenoids were found to be more abundant in fungal-infected plants compared to healthy plants. Future research could investigate the role of stilbenoids in the plant's defense response against fungal infection. This could involve studying the expression of genes involved in stilbenoid biosynthesis, as well as investigating the effects of stilbenoids on fungal growth and virulence.


4. **Investigate the potential of using metabolomics to identify biomarkers for fungal infection in Orchidaceae species:** The study identified several metabolites that were differentially abundant in healthy and fungal-infected plants. Future research could investigate the potential of using these metabolites as biomarkers for fungal infection in Orchidaceae species. This could involve developing diagnostic tools that can be used to rapidly and accurately identify fungal infections in plants, allowing for early intervention and treatment.


5. **Explore the potential of using metabolomics to identify new antifungal compounds from Orchidaceae species:** The study identified several metabolites with antifungal activity. Future research could investigate the potential of using metabolomics to identify new antifungal compounds from Orchidaceae species. This could involve screening extracts from different species of Orchidaceae for antifungal activity and using metabolomics to identify the active compounds. This could lead to the discovery of new antifungal agents with novel mechanisms of action.
