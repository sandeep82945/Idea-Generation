    "abstractText": "Androgynous tendencies and persistently low fertility rates have been observed in many countries, causing major social concerns. The theory of sexual selection suggests a possible mechanism between androgyny and decreased sexual activeness, as masculinity and femininity constitute an important aspect of reproductive strategies. This theory has also been proven by evolutionary and societal evidence. Therefore, we investigate the association between masculinity and femininity with sexual activeness, as well as the influence of gender-role conformity on the frequency of sexual intercourse through sexually selected traits among 42,492 Chinese youths. Sexual activeness was measured using sexual attitudes, experience, behaviors, and pleasure. Mediation analysis was employed to investigate the effects of sexually selected traits on the association between masculinity and femininity with sexual activeness, and gender-role conformity with the frequency of sexual intercourse. Low sexual activeness was found to be associated with low gender-role conformity. Our findings also suggest that physical attractiveness, sexual motivation, and interpersonal relationships may mediate the association between sexual activeness and gender-role conformity, supporting the malescompete/females-choose model.",

Masculinity in males was observed to shape physical characteristics such as jaw size, muscularity, and midface robustness (Marcinkowska et\u00a0al., 2019), to reflect certain traits such as mate quality, paternal investment, and competitiveness (Bribiescas et\u00a0al., 2012), while facial femininity in females was also observed to be\u00a0associated with fecundability (Little et\u00a0al., 2014). Studies have demonstrated that prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone plays a significant role in the construction of adult masculinity (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1979) and increases sexual activeness in males (Halpern et\u00a0al., 1998). However, high levels of testosterone in females result in decreased sexual activeness (Law Smith et\u00a0al., 2012; Das and Sawin, 2016; Niu and Zheng, 2020). Additionally, certain moral and quasi-moral traits relevant to femininity in females, including kindness and agreeableness (Eisenberg et\u00a0al., 2001), have been sociologically and biologically demonstrated to increase sexual attractiveness (Zietsch et\u00a0al., 2008).\nInterestingly, an increasing trend of androgynous tendencies has been observed among Chinese youths over the past few decades. A survey of Chinese college students conducted in 1998 reported that while 32.3% of male students viewed themselves as masculine and 69.6% female students viewed themselves as feminine, 23.1% and 15.4% of male and female students, respectively, viewed themselves as androgynous (Shaomei, 1998). However, a more recent survey on 5,286 Chinese college students in 2011 reported that the proportion of male and female students who viewed themselves as masculine and feminine has decreased to 25.0% and 27.3%, respectively, while the proportion of male and female students who viewed themselves as androgynous has increased to 33.01% and 29.58%, respectively (Dianzhi, 2011). During the same period, the total fertility rate (TFR) in China declined below replacement levels from 2.7\u00a0in 1988 (Abbafati et\u00a0al., 2020) to 1.7\u00a0in 2021 (Searchinger et\u00a0 al., 2013; Shen, 2021), leading to major economic and social concerns. As androgyny may impact sexual behaviors which correlates with fertility, it is therefore of great social significance to evaluate the potential roles of androgynous tendency on sexual activeness among youths of reproductive age.\nAt present, population-based studies on the relationship between gender-role conformity and sexual activeness or fertility decline are limited. Theories on the declination of fertility suggest that higher education, welfare institutions (Freedman, 1979), and greater stress of living (Liu and Raftery, 2020) contribute to fewer births. However, these studies often draw largely on various sociological theories, while disregarding the biological nature of human sexuality (Duckworth and Trautner, 2019). Furthermore, these studies typically focus on sexual minorities or individuals with sexually transmitted infections and tend to focus only on masculinity and not femininity (Little et\u00a0al., 2011). Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the association between genderrole conformity and sexual activeness among male and female heterosexual Chinese youths. Mediation analysis was also employed to investigate the effect of sexually selected traits in the associations."

The development of the questionnaire and study design has been previously described in detail (Zou et\u00a0al., 2021). The questionnaire contained 92 questions categorized into four sections: SRH knowledge and attitudes, intimacy and sexual experience, individual health status, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.\nA multistage sampling approach was utilized, and 1,764 higher education institutions, including key universities, ordinary universities, and vocational colleges, were selected after balancing the types of educational institutes. A total of 55,757 students responded. For the purposes of this study, only respondents who (1) provided informed consent, (2) answered all questions and passed the consistency checks and logic verification, (3) were aged between 15 and 25 years old, and (4) were undergraduate students who self-reported their gender orientation as heterosexual, were included.

Females with high gender-role conformity also reported better father\u2013child relationship (high: 7.39 \u00b1 2.23 vs. androgyny: 6.86 \u00b1 2.39, p < 0.0001) and mother\u2013child relationship (high: 7.99 \u00b1 1.92 vs. androgyny: 7.47 \u00b1 2.17, p < 0.0001) compared to females with low gender-role conformity.\nMales with high gender-role conformity report significantly higher tobacco use (high: 27.23% vs. androgyny: 23.11%, p < 0.0001) and alcohol consumption (high: 57.49% vs. androgyny: 51.29%, p < 0.0001), while females with high gender-role conformity report significantly lower tobacco use (high: 5.43% vs. androgyny: 6.96%) and alcohol consumption (high: 27.71% vs. androgyny: 29.83%, p < 0.0001), compared to males and females with low gender-role conformity.\nDistribution of gender-role conformity among males and females\nThe distribution of gender-role conformity among males and females is presented in Figure\u00a02. Males on average have a genderrole conformity score of 5.55 \u00b1 1.28 on a scale of 7. There was a skewed distribution of gender-role conformity scores among males, with the majority reporting high masculinity conformity (56.25% reported scores of 6 points and above). On average, the gender-role conformity score was 6.49 \u00b1 0.50\u00a0 in the high masculinity group and 4.35 \u00b1 0.94\u00a0in the androgynous group.\nFemales on average have a gender-role conformity score of 4.87 \u00b1 1.36 on a scale of 7. In contrast to males, there was a normal distribution of gender-role conformity scores among females, with the majority reporting moderate femininity conformity score (53.91% reporting a score between 4 and 5), showing greater androgynous characteristics. On average, the gender-role conformity score was 5.73 \u00b1 0.78\u00a0in the high femininity group and 3.28 \u00b1 0.82\u00a0in the androgynous group.\nAssociation between androgynous tendency and sexual activeness\nThe association between gender-role conformity score and sexual activeness is presented in Table\u00a02. Participants with high gender-role conformity were found to have more liberal attitudes toward sexual intercourse, were more likely to have intimate partners, were more likely to be\u00a0sexually satisfied, and were more likely to exhibit more frequent sexual behaviors, compared to androgynous participants. Both males and females with high gender-role conformity were significantly more likely to agree with premarital sexual intercourse (male: OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.09, female: OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03\u2013 1.09), have an intimate heterosexual partner (male: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13\u20131.22, female: OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.18\u20131.24), have had penetrative sexual intercourse (male: OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.17, female: OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18\u20131.27), have more frequent sexual intercourse (male: OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05\u20131.15, female: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.24), and be\u00a0sexually satisfied (male: OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23\u20131.54, female: OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.23). Both males and females with high genderrole conformity scores were also significantly less likely to feel guilty for being sexually active (male: OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.89, female: OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92\u20130.98), while males with high masculinity conformity scores were significantly more likely to have had an orgasm (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08\u20131.30). However, this was not significant in females with high femininity conformity scores (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99\u20131.11).\nRoles of individual- and interpersonal-level mediators\nThe TE, ADE, ACME, and PM of the association between gender-role conformity and frequent sexual intercourse are\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\npresented in Table\u00a03.

Our findings also suggest that physical attractiveness, sexual motivation, and interpersonal relationships may play a mediating role, indicating that sexually selected traits may be\u00a0an important underlying mechanism in this pathway.\nOur finding of a positive association between gender-role conformity and high sexual activeness is consistent with existing evidence. Previous studies showed that males with more masculine traits, such as certain facial characteristics, were more sexually active (Lidborg et\u00a0al., 2022), while females with more feminine traits have more sexual partners. According to the theory of sexual selection, masculinity and femininity are regarded as part of\nFIGURE\u00a02 The distribution of gender-role conformity among male and female youths.\nTABLE\u00a02 The association between androgynous tendency and sexual activeness among males and females.\nVariables Sexa\nMale Female\nOpenness toward sexual behaviors\nAgree with premarital sex 1.05 (1.01\u20131.09)* 1.06 (1.03\u20131.09)***\nEver feel guilty for being sexually active 0.85 (0.82\u20130.89)* 0.95 (0.92\u20130.98)**\nSexual experience\nHave had a girlfriend/boyfriend 1.18 (1.13\u20131.22)*** 1.21 (1.18\u20131.24)***\nEarly age of first penetrative sexual intercourse (before 16 years of age)b 1.09 (0.97\u20131.20) 1.05 (0.95\u20131.15)\nSexual behaviors\nHave had penetrative sexual intercourse (anal/vaginal) 1.12 (1.07\u20131.17)*** 1.23 (1.18\u20131.27)***\nFrequent sexual intercourse (more than once per week) 1.10 (1.05\u20131.15)*** 1.20 (1.15\u20131.24)***\nSexual pleasure\nHave experienced an orgasmb 1.19 (1.08\u20131.30)*** 1.05 (0.99\u20131.11)\nCurrent sexual satisfactionb 1.38 (1.23\u20131.54)*** 1.15 (1.08\u20131.23)***\nThe standardized gender-role conformity score is considered a continuous variable in all analyses, and the estimated odds ratio (OR) represents the change in odds followed by a 1-unit decrease in SD. aAdjusted for age, region, ethnicity, school type, average monthly expenditure, self-rated parent\u2013child relationship, if he\u00a0or she has ever received sexual education at school, if he\u00a0or she has ever had parent\u2013child discussions relevant to sexual behaviors, parents\u2019 highest educational attainments, tobacco consumption, and alcohol consumption. bAnalyze for individuals who have had sexual intercourse. n = 3,703 for males, and n = 5,046 for females. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nhuman reproductive strategies. Hence, individuals with high masculinity and femininity are considered more \u201cprepared\u201d for reproduction. These factors may contribute to more liberal sexual attitudes and more aggressive sexual behaviors, resulting in higher frequencies of sexual intercourse (Rahman et\u00a0al., 2005; Manning and Fink, 2008). These sexually selected traits are also often linked to higher levels of sex hormones such as testosterone and estradiol, which have been associated with increased sexual desire (van Anders, 2012; Cappelletti and Wallen, 2016) and higher sexual attractiveness (Giagulli et\u00a0 al., 2011; Haupt et\u00a0 al., 2020). Additionally, more masculine males and more feminine females reported higher levels of sexual satisfaction, consistent with previous studies (Pedersen and Blekesaune, 2003; Daniel and Bridges, 2013). Higher masculinity and femininity in males and females, respectively, may correlate with higher self-esteem and more positive body image, resulting in greater confidence and consequently, higher sexual satisfaction (S\u00e1nchez-Fuentes et\u00a0al., 2014).\nFindings from our study suggest that physical attractiveness and interpersonal relationships mediate the association between gender role conformity and sexual activity in males. As masculinity often correlates with physical attractiveness, men with more masculine appearances may tend to have better reproductive success. These results support the males-compete/females-choose (MCFC) model proposed by Darwin, suggesting that different sexes play different roles in reproduction, and that men typically compete for sexual attraction from females (Darwin, 2008; Dixson, 2020). Many other studies have also demonstrated that males have a stronger sense of intrasexual selection compared to females (Puts, 2010; Lassek and Gaulin, 2022). Physical attractiveness and interpersonal relationships constitute a part of the reproductive strategies of males; the former is utilized for short-term attractiveness (Buss et\u00a0al., 2017; Buss and Schmitt, 2019), while the latter is utilized for long-term sexual relationships\n(Dixson et\u00a0al., 2016). Studies have reported a female preference for more masculine craniofacial traits for short-term relationships than for long-term relationships (Little et\u00a0al., 2011; Dixson et\u00a0al., 2016). However, in long-term relationships, females prefer males with good moral or quasi-moral characteristics, such as intelligence, honesty, and warmth required for better interpersonal relationships (Regan et\u00a0al., 2000). In addition, higher physical attractiveness and the ability to navigate interpersonal relationships are useful during courtship, crucial for reproductive success (Wong and Candolin, 2005; Eikenaar et al., 2012).\nAnother important finding was that sexual motivation had a greater mediating effect on females than on males. This is consistent with earlier observations. And the males-compete/ females-choose model that females invest more in their offspring than their male counterparts became, in essence, a scarce resource, driving male\u2013male competition to attract and retain mates. As mentioned above, females usually play the role of choosers in the mating process and have stronger internal motivation for intersexual selection (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1979; Stewart-Williams and Thomas, 2013).\nOverall, this study has several strengths. First, it investigated the association between gender-role conformity and sexual activeness from a broader perspective by measuring not only sexual attitudes and experiences but also sexual behaviors and pleasure, allowing for a more precise evaluation of sexual activeness. Both masculinity and femininity were also accounted for. Second, mediation analysis was employed to investigate the associations of various factors with genderrole conformity through both biological and sociological pathways. This approach enabled us to better understand the gender-role patterns as they relate to sexual activeness between different sexes, increasing our understanding of sexual selection theory. Third, our study was based on a large-scale population-based survey in China.

More importantly, this study addresses the current knowledge gap concerning gender-role distribution among Chinese youths.\nThis study also has several limitations. First, as the measurement of gender-role conformity was self-reported, measurement bias may be\u00a0present. However, as there has yet to be\u00a0 a robust gender-role measurement scale with high reliability and validity, this approach has the highest feasibility. Second, as the frequency of sexual intercourse was also selfreported, recall bias may be\u00a0present. However, attempts were made to mitigate the severity of biasness by cross-checking survey questions and performing logic verification. Third, as this is a cross-sectional study, causal inference cannot be\u00a0 drawn. Fourth, the question \u201cDo you\u00a0 want to have a girlfriend/boyfriend?\u201d may not the best measure of sexual motivation. Intimate partnership establishment refers to both sexual and emotional intimacy, and someone who is highly motivated to have sex may prefer short-term relationship (i.e., casual sex, one-night stands) to avoid emotional intimacy. Finally, although we\u00a0 adjusted for possible confounders, we\u00a0were unable to adjust for confounding from cultural and psychosocial factors, which may result in residual confounding. Future studies should consider these additional factors related to masculinity, femininity, and sexual activeness.\nIn conclusion, among heterosexual Chinese youths of reproductive age, high gender-role conformity (i.e., high masculinity in males and high femininity in females) was associated with a significantly higher level of sexual activeness, implying that androgynous tendencies may contribute to a decrease in population fertility. We\u00a0 also found that such an association between gender-role conformity and sexual activeness was mediated through physical attractiveness, sexual motivation, and interpersonal relationships."
