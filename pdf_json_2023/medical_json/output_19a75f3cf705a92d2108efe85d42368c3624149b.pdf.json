    "abstractText": "Long non-coding RNAs are considered to be key regulatory factors of oncogenesis and tumor progression. It is reported that LINC00460 plays the role of oncogene in some tumors. However, LINC00460\u2019s role and mechanism of action in pancreatic cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. We identified LINC00460 by analyzing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The role of LINC00460 in proliferation and metastasis was examined using CCK8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. The potential mechanisms of LINC00460 in regulating mRNA levels were elucidated by RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, Chromatin immunoprecipitation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence assays. The results showed that LINC00460 was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. Highly expressed LINC00460 is significantly related to short survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Inhibition of LINC00460 attenuated pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, whereas its overexpression reversed this effect. Mechanically, LINC00460 is induced by hypoxia, through binding of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-\u03b1 in the promoter region of LINC00460. Furthermore, LINC00460 functioned as an miR-4689 sponge to regulate the downstream target gene UBE2V1, enhancing the stability of mutant p53 in pancreatic cancer cells. LINC00460 also further promotes pancreatic cancer development by sequestering USP10, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin-specific protease that deubiquitinates p53 and enhances its stability. Collectively, our study demonstrated that LINC00460 is a hypoxia-induced lncRNA that plays the role of oncogene in pancreatic cancer by modulating the miR-4689/UBE2V1 axis, sequestering USP10, and ultimately enhancing the stability of mutant p53.",

            "text": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive tumor, and in the United States, it ranks third among cancer-related mortality (1). This disease is usually asymptomatic in the early stages and is characterized by late stage and metastasis when diagnosed. Although treatment methods have greatly improved in recent years, chemotherapy remains the only opportunity for most patients with pancreatic cancer (2). Unfortunately, many of them are insensitive to chemotherapy and quickly develop\nresistance to chemotherapy drugs (3). Therefore, finding new therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer has become an urgent problem. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that contain more than 200 nucleotides but do not encode proteins (4). lncRNAs play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation and differentiation. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in the pathological process of cancer (5, 6). LINC00460 has been reported\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1340\nto participate in proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of various tumor types. For example, LINC00460 plays the role of oncogene by sponging miR-342-3p and further regulates AGR2 expression to promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (7). In gastric cancer, LINC00460 co-operated with EZH2 and LSD1 to inhibit expression of CCNG2 and further enhances proliferation (8). Further evidence indicates that LINC00460 is the main regulator of molecular pathways in breast cancer and can influence clinical outcome (9). More interestingly, LINC00460 binds directly to PRDX1, promoting PRDX1 into the nucleus and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (10). Nevertheless, the specific role of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. Previous studies have revealed that hypoxia is frequently associated with tumor progression (11-13). Due to the dense extracellular matrix of pancreatic tumors, pancreatic cancer cells are chronically hypoxic (14, 15). Under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is activated and then promotes the transcription of its downstream target gene (16, 17). Recently, the impact of hypoxia on the expression of lncRNAs has been a focus of attention. Some hypoxia-responsive lncRNAs play significant roles in tumor development; for instance, hypoxia-induced overexpression of lncRNA-BX111 enhanced the metastatic ability of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, hypoxia promoted EMT, which could be partially inhibited by the downregulation of BX111(18). lncHILAR is a hypoxia-induced LncRNA that plays an important regulatory role in renal cell carcinoma and promotes the invasion of tumor cells (19). MIR210HG is a key hypoxia-regulated lncRNA involved in glioma invasion, cancer stemness and temozolomide resistance (20). In summary, pancreatic cancer occurs in a low oxygen environment, and the abnormal expression of lncRNAs induced by hypoxia in pancreatic cancer requires further research. It is reported that miR-4689 decreased tumor progression in colorectal cancer (21), nevertheless, its role in pancreatic cancer is still unclear. Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2 variant1 (UBE2V1), mainly functions with its co-factor UBC13, plays a significant role in the formation of protein polymers through k63-dependent ubiquitination (22). UBE2V1 is upregulated in colorectal cancer and melanoma and is associated with poor prognosis (23, 24). However, its role in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. Ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 (USP10) is a highly conserved deubiquitinating enzyme with complex roles in tumorigenesis. For example, overexpression of USP10 stabilizes Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 and suppresses lung\ntumorigenesis (25), whereas USP10 deubiquitinates NLRP7 and promotes colorectal cancer progression by activating the immunosuppressive state (26). The roles and specific mechanisms of USP10 in pancreatic cancer require more detailed research (27). Wild-type p53 is a tumor suppressor whose expression is closely linked to the DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation. P53 expression is regulated by post-translational modifications, including but not limited to, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination (28). P53 is mutated in multiple tumors, and the mechanism of gain-of-function mechanism is an important factor in the induction of tumor progression by mutant p53(29-31). P53 mutation is one of the four most common mutations in pancreatic cancer; thus, most pancreatic cancer cells contain mutant p53, whose upregulation subsequently promotes tumorigenesis (32, 33). The mechanism of upregulation of mutant p53 protein in pancreatic cancer requires further investigation. In this study, we discovered that LINC00460 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer, based on bioinformatic analysis and specimen information in our center. The high expression of LINC00460 promotes proliferation and metastatic capacity. Furthermore, upregulation of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer is induced by HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistically, LINC00460 plays the role of oncogene by acting as a sponge of miR-4689, activating its downstream target, UBE2V1, and sequestering USP10 to promote the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Remarkably, both UBE2V1 and USP10 participate in the regulation of p53 by enhancing the stability of p53, ultimately promoting the proliferation and metastatic capacity of pancreatic cancers with mutant p53. Altogether, our study demonstrates that LINC00460 may be a potential biomarker for pancreatic cancer."

            "text": "LINC00460 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and is related to poor prognosis\nTo find potential lncRNAs that might be involved in the progression of pancreatic cancer, differential expression analysis was performed using data from GEO datasets (GSE16515, GSE27890, GSE46234, and GSE71989). We found 15 lncRNAs, including LINC00460, were expressed differently in normal and pancreatic cancer tissues (Figure 1 A). Furthermore, we identified that LINC00460 was upregulated in other tumors and may be a latent oncogene in pancreatic cancer (Figure 1 B). Subsequently, GEPIA, an analytical tool based on TCGA, was used to verify the expression of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer and its impact on patient prognosis. We determined that LINC00460 has higher expression in pancreatic cancer tissues than in normal tissues, in both TCGA database and using data from our institute (Figure 1 C, D). Data from TCGA database also suggested that higher expression of LINC00460 was closely related to lower overall survival rate of patients (Figure 1 E). In agreement with this, 30 paired tissue samples from our center also demonstrated that the high expression of LINC00460 was associated with a shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (Figure 1 F, G). Finally, compared with normal pancreatic epithelial cells, LINC00460 expression increased in seven of the eight pancreatic cancer cell lines tested (Figure 1 H). The above evidence suggests that LINC00460 may be a potential oncogene in pancreatic cancer.\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1344\nLINC00460 promotes proliferation and metastatic capacity of pancreatic cancer cell lines\nTo verify the specific function of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer, short interfering RNAs were used to reduce the high expression of LINC00460 in the human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC1 and CFPAC. MiaPaCa2, with low LINC00460 expression, was selected as a cell model for stable overexpression. Knockdown and overexpression efficiencies were verified by qRT-PCR (Figure 2 A, D, G). CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to examine proliferation ability. Knockdown of LINC00460 in PANC1 and CFPAC cell lines inhibited their proliferation ability (Figure 2 B, C, E, F), while overexpression of LINC00460 in MiaPaCa2 enhanced proliferation (Figure 2 H, I). Subsequently, wound healing (Figure 2 J, K) and transwell assays (Figure 2 N, O) showed that knockdown of LINC00460 reduced the metastasis ability of PANC1 and CFPAC cells. In addition, LINC00460 overexpression in MiaPaCa2 cells increased metastatic potential, indicating that LINC00460 may facilitate metastasis (Figure 2 L, M). Western blot assays were used to verify proliferation and metastasis when LINC00460 was knocked down or overexpressed (Figure S2 D). Flow cytometry revealed that knocking down LINC00460 significantly promoted apoptosis of PANC1 and CFPAC cells (Figure S1 A, B), whereas overexpression of LINC00460 inhibited apoptosis (Figure S1 C). Western blot assays using apoptosis-related proteins confirmed this result (Figure S1 D). In addition, as shown by flow cytometry and western blot assays, downregulation of the LINC00460 induced cell cycle arrest (Figure S2 A-C). The subcutaneous xenograft model was further utilized to verify the biological function of LINC00460 in vivo. The results were identical to the in vitro experiments, and the tumor volume and weight of the LINC00460 down-regulated group were reduced compared with the control group (Figure 3 A-F), whereas overexpression of LINC00460 promoted tumor growth rate (Figure 3 G-I). IHC analysis of tumor tissues from nude mice revealed that decreased LINC00460 expression resulted in decreased Ki-67 and N-cadherin expression and upregulated TUNEL and E-cadherin expression (Figure 3J). To investigate the effect of LINC00460 on the metastatic function of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, we injected CFPAC cells into the spleen of nude mice. We found that knocking down LINC00460 significantly inhibited the\nability of CFPAC cells to metastasize in nude mice (Figure 3K). Overall, our findings indicate that LINC00460 promoted the proliferation and metastatic ability of pancreatic cancer cells, both in vivo and in vitro.\nUpregulation of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer is induced by hypoxia\nNext, we explored the potential mechanisms of LINC00460 upregulation in pancreatic cancer. Previous studies revealed that hypoxia is closely associated with tumor progression and hypoxia could affect the expression of lncRNAs. To investigate whether upregulation of LINC00460 was induced by hypoxia, we exposed pancreatic cancer cell lines to hypoxia and normoxia conditions for 24 and 48 h or treated with CoCl2 for 48 h. qRT-PCR demonstrated that LINC00460 was upregulated in hypoxic environment or after CoCl2 treatment (Figure 4 A-C). HIF-1\u03b1, the key effector molecule for hypoxia, was also upregulated under these conditions (Figure 4 D-F). siRNAs targeting HIF-1\u03b1 reduced HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels (Figure S3 D) and mRNA (Figure S3 E). Data from TCGA database indicate that LINC00460 is positively correlated with HIF-1\u03b1, which is consistent with our results (Figure 4 M). To clarify the possible mechanism by which hypoxia induces upregulation of LINC00460, the JASPAR database was used to identify potential hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the LINC00460 promoter region (Figure S3 A). Two high-score HREs were selected by us for further analysis (Figure 4 G). Primers were designed and synthesized for the HREs, and ChIP assays were performed. The results identified that HRE1 might be a potential binding domain in the LINC00460 promoter in pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figure 4 H-J). In addition, luciferase reporter vectors including either the HRE1 or HRE2 sequence were synthesized. The luciferase activity in cells transfected with HRE1 was higher than that in cells with HRE2, and this increase was more pronounced under hypoxic conditions. Thus, HRE1 may be the key binding site for HIF-1\u03b1 to upregulate LINC00460 (Figure 4 K). SiRNAs were utilized to verify the result. Knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 reduced luciferase activity of its binding domain (Figure 4 L). Overall, these results indicated that under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 induced upregulation of linc00460 in pancreatic cancer, and that this required the HRE1 binding site in the promoter of LINC00460.\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1345\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1346\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1347\nTo further confirm the relationship between\nLINC00460 and HIF-1\u03b1, we performed western blotting and RT-PCR assays. HIF-1\u03b1 and UBE2V1\nprotein levels were upregulated under hypoxic conditions. Knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 or LINC00460 both reduced the effect of hypoxia. More interestingly,\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1348\noverexpression of LINC00460 partially reversed this inhibitory effect in pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figure 4 N-P). In addition, knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibited LINC00460 expression (Figure S3 F). The hypoxic microenvironment of tumors promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis. The proliferative ability of PANC1 and CFPAC cells were greatly enhanced under hypoxic conditions, while knockdown of LINC00460 and HIF-1\u03b1 attenuated this effect. Moreover, the decreased proliferative activity resulting from the knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 could be partially rescued by overexpressing LINC00460 (Figure S4 A, B). Knockdown of LINC00460 and HIF-1\u03b1 could also suppress the metastasis of PANC1 and CFPAC cells, whereas overexpression of LINC00460 could partly reverse this inhibitory effect (Figure S4 C-F). In brief, these results suggested that LINC00460 participated in hypoxia-induced proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer.\nLINC00460 functions as a miR-4689 sponge and upregulates UBE2V1 expression in pancreatic cancer\nThe mechanism of action of lncRNAs depends on their subcellular localization. To determine the mechanisms by which LINC00460 promotes the cell proliferation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer, to begin with, we predicted the subcellular localization of LINC00460 using lncLocator, an online prediction tool, and found that LINC00460 was mostly localized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, FISH assays confirmed the above results (Figure S5 A, B). lncRNAs have been reported to act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that bind miRNAs in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we speculated that LINC00460 might also function as a ceRNA in pancreatic cancer. We searched three databases (DIANA, lncRNASNP2, and lncbook) and identified miR-4689, miR-4649-3p, and miR-6858-5p as potential binding partners for LINC00460 (Figure 5 A). While knocking out or overexpressing LINC00460, we quantified the expression of these three miRNAs by qRT-PCR (Figure S5 C-E). MiR-4689 showed the highest upregulation of the miRNAs when LINC00460 was knocked down and was clearly downregulated when LINC00460 was overexpressed. Therefore, we chose miR-4689 as the main downstream miRNA of LINC00460 for further study. We constructed miR-4689 mimics and inhibitors. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that LINC00460 binds to miR-4689 (Figure 5 B). RIP assay further validated the mutual binding of LINC00460 and miR-4689 in PANC1 and CFPAC cells (Figure 5 C, D). We then performed a complement experiment to verify the interrelationship between miR-4689 and LINC00460,\nand we found that miR-4689 can partially compensate for the changes in Ki-67, N-cadherin and E-cadherin proteins caused by knocking down LINC00460 in PANC1, CFPAC and MiaPaCa2 cancer cells (Figure 5 E-G). Using the miRWalk, TargetScan, miRDB, and miRTarBase databases, we identified 7 potential downstream targets of miR-4689 (Figure 5 H). Further qRT-PCR experiments showed that the expression of UBE2V1 changed most significantly after the addition of mimics or inhibitors of miR-4689 (Figure S5 F). Moreover, the expression level of UBE2V1 was positively correlated with the expression of LINC00460, so we chose UBE2V1 as the underlying target of miR-4689 for further experiments (Figure S5 G, H). A dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that UBE2V1 was a direct target of miR-4689 as well (Figure 5 L). Furthermore, UBE2V1 mRNA (Figure 5 M, N) and protein levels (Figure 5 I, J) decreased in cells transfected with miR-4689 mimics or following knockdown of LINC00460, whereas protein levels increased in MiaPaCa2 cells (Figure 5 K, O). We conclude that LINC00460, as the sponge of miR-4689, regulates its downstream target UBE2V1. Proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer may therefore be mediated by the LINC00460/miR-4689/ UBE2V1 axis.\nUBE2V1 regulates the proliferation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer and regulates p53 stability\nUBE2V1, reported as an oncogene, works with its co-factor UBC13, a K63-Ub specific E2 enzyme. However, the function and mechanism of UBE2V1 in pancreatic cancer are unknown. To explore UBE2V1\u2019s effect on pancreatic cancer, siRNAs that can reduce the level of UBE2V1 protein and mRNA was used for subsequent experiments (Figure 6 A, G). CCK-8 and colony formation assays indicated that downregulation of UBE2V1 reduced the proliferation ability of pancreatic cancer cell lines, while overexpression of LINC00460 could partly rescue this effect (Figure 6 B-D). Wound healing and transwell assays also revealed that knockdown of UBE2V1 prevented metastasis, and that upregulation of LINC00460 promoted metastatic ability (Figure 6 E, F). Previous studies have reported that UBE2V1 and, UBC13, could elicit K63-dependent p53 ubiquitination. Unlike conventional ubiquitinated proteins which ubiquitinate and degrade p53, UBE2V1, and UBC13 attenuate Hdm2-induced p53 polyubiquitination and increase its stability (34). Here, we examined whether UBE2V1 could attenuate Hdm2induced p53 polyubiquitination and enhance the stability of either wild-type or mutant p53 proteins, in\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1349\npancreatic cancer. The wild-type p53 cell line, Capan2 and two mutant p53 cell lines, PANC1 and CFPAC, were selected (Figure S10 A-E). Knockdown of UBE2V1 decreased the expression of mutant and wild-type p53 in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 6 G). To identify the relationship between UBE2V1 and p53 protein, we conducted Co-IP assays to detect the direct interaction of the two proteins and found that UBE2V1 does not interact directly with either wild-type or mutant p53 (Figure 6 H, I). Additionally,\nto determine whether UBE2V1 influences p53 stability in pancreatic cancer cells, we treated PANC1 and Capan2 cells with cycloheximide. The results indicated that p53 was degraded faster when UBE2V1 was knocked down in PANC1 and Capan2 cell lines (Figure 6 J, K). In short, these experiments showed that UBE2V1 could stabilize both wild-type and mutant p53. We also explored the biological functions of UBE2V1 in the Capan2 cell line. The knockdown efficiency was tested by qRT-PCR (Figure S6 A).\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1350\nFurthermore, CCK8 and colony formation assays revealed that downregulation of UBE2V1 promoted the proliferation of Capan2 cells (Figure S6 B, C). Wound healing and transwell migration assays also\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1351\nidentified that downregulation of UBE2V1 enhanced the metastatic activity of Capan2 cells (Figure S6 D, E). The above results indicated that the biological function of UBE2V1 in pancreatic cancer cells is p53 context dependent, with UBE2V1 acting as an oncogene in mutant p53 cell lines, while functioning as a tumor suppressor in wild-type p53 cell lines. In summary, UBE2V1, the downstream target of miR-4689, enhances the stability of p53 in pancreatic cancer and further promotes proliferation and metastasis in mutant p53 cell lines.\nLINC00460 regulates proliferation and metastasis by sequestering USP10\nTo additionally investigate the possible mechanism of LINC00460 promoting the progression of pancreatic cancer, we conducted RNA pull-down combined with mass spectrometry. The results showed that the USP10 protein may bind directly to LINC00460. A western blot assay using samples enriched with biotinylated LINC00460 confirmed this (Figure 7 A, B). We then performed RIP assays with a USP10 antibody and verified that there is a direct combination between LINC00460 and USP10 (Figure 7 C). Further correlation analysis showed that LINC00460 expression correlated positively with USP10 expression (Figure 7 D). Additionally, USP10 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues (Figure S7 A, B) and high expression of USP10 is closely related to poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer, including disease-free survival rates (Figure S7 D, E). The expression of USP10 decreased when LINC00460 was knocked down and vice versa (Figure 7 E). The expression of USP10 was knocked down by siRNAs and verified the knockdown efficiency by qRT-PCR (Figure S8 A, B) and western blot assays (Figure 7 F). Next, we explored the biological function of USP10. CCK8 and colony formation assays suggested that USP10 downregulation decreased cell proliferation, while overexpression of LINC00460 partly rescued this effect (Figure 7 G, H). We also conducted wound healing and transwell migration assays to explore the effect of USP10 on the metastatic capacity of cancer cells (Figure 7 I, J). In brief, we found that USP10 may be a direct-binding partner for LINC00460, and that overexpression of LINC00460 can partially reverse the inhibition of downregulation of USP10 on cell proliferation and metastasis in PANC1 and CFPAC.\nKnockdown of USP10 promotes the translocation of p53 out of the nucleus and accelerates its degradation\nThe role of USP10 in pancreatic cancer is unclear, accordingly, we explored the mechanism by which USP10 regulates its downstream targets in pancreatic\ncancer. Previous studies suggested that USP10 is a deubiquitinating enzyme and modulates the stability of both wild-type and mutant p53(35). Here, we speculated that USP10 functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme in pancreatic cancer as well, inhibiting the p53 ubiquitination, and eventually stabilizing p53. We used PANC1 and Capan2 cell line in the following experiments. Downregulation of USP10 reduced p53 protein levels (Figure 8 B) but not the mRNA levels of TP53 (Figure 8 A), suggesting that changes in p53 protein levels did not occur at the transcriptional level, but at the protein level. Data from TCGA indicated that p53 expression positively correlates with USP10 expression (Figure S7 C). Co-IP assays suggested a direct combination between USP10 and p53 (Figure S8 C, D). The expression and localization of p53 are crucial for its biological function; therefore, we performed immunofluorescence assays to determine its localization. Knocking down USP10 could promote translocation of p53 out of the nucleus in PANC1 and Capan2 cells (Figure 8 C, D). Interestingly, p53 was degraded faster in USP10 knockdown cells compared to control cells (Figure 8 E, F). Knockdown of LINC00460 could also accelerate the degradation of p53 protein (Figure 8 G, H). We then conducted Co-IP assays to verify this result and found that knockdown of LINC00460 weakened the interaction between the USP10 and p53 proteins (Figure 8 I, J). The above results indicated that knockdown of USP10 promotes the translocation of the p53 out of the nucleus and accelerates the degradation of p53. Based on the results above, we examined the biological functions of USP10 in Capan2 cells which express wild-type p53. p53 mRNA did not decrease when USP10 was knocked down in Capan2 cells (Figure S9 A, B). Furthermore, the CCK8 assay showed that knockdown of USP10 in Capan2 increased proliferative activity (Figure S9 C) and wound healing and transwell assays suggested that knockdown of USP10 enhanced metastasis ability (Figure S9 D, E). These results showed that the biological function of USP10 is p53 dependent. USP10 promotes proliferation and metastasis in mutant p53 cell lines while inhibiting proliferation and metastasis in wild-type p53 cell lines. Thus, we revealed that p53 may be a potential target of USP10, and that inhibition of USP10 promotes the translocation of p53 out of the nucleus and accelerates its degradation. Importantly, the expression of LINC00460 can regulate USP10 levels and further manipulate p53 protein levels, thereby regulating the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer.\nInt. J. Med.

            "text": "In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to pancreatic cancer due to its poor prognosis and high morbidity. Because early pancreatic cancer is usually asymptomatic, diagnosis occurs at later stages which, coupled with its malignancy, means that, for most patients, surgery is not an option, making chemotherapy the only viable\nchoice. The efficacy of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer has shown little progress over the years; therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new targets for pancreatic cancer. Recently, lncRNAs, which are aberrantly expressed in many tumors, have been reported to play a crucial role in the development of various tumors such as liver cancer (36), gastric cancer (37), breast cancer (38), lung cancer (39), and prostate cancer (40). In this study, we\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1354\ndiscovered that LINC00460 was up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. Further correlation analysis revealed that high expression of LINC00460 is closely related to poor prognosis in patients. Furthermore, biological function studies demonstrated that LINC00460 upregulation increased pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Overall, these results indicated that LINC00460 is an oncogene and potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer. Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in solid tumors, especially pancreatic cancer, and is significantly related to tumor development. Recently, some studies have found that lncRNAs are also regulated by hypoxia, specifically by binding to HIF-1\u03b1 by HREs in promoter region and thus affecting their transcription. In this study, we determined LINC00460 as a hypoxia-inducible lncRNA. LINC00460 expression was upregulated under oxygen-deficient conditions and could be inhibited by knocking down HIF-1\u03b1. Two possible HREs in the promoter of the LINC00460 were calculated through the JASPAR database and confirmed that the HIF-1\u03b1 binding site was HRE1. Additionally, we also found that inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1\nor LINC00460 inhibited the enhancement of cell proliferation and metastasis induced by hypoxia, and, remarkably, that overexpression of LINC00460 can partially reverse this inhibitory effect. These results show that LINC00460 is a hypoxia-induced lncRNA that participates in hypoxia-induced proliferation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Through FISH experiments, we found that LINC00460 is located in the cytoplasm. Also, ceRNAs, crucial mechanisms for lncRNAs are located in the cytoplasm (41). Using prediction tools, we showed that LINC00460 may bind to miR-4689, and following RIP and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed this result. MiR-4689 plays an important role in inhibiting pancreatic cancer. Overexpression of MiR-4689 can partially reverse LINC00460 induced cell proliferation and metastasis. Collectively, LINC00460 plays the role of ceRNA by binding with miR-4689 in pancreatic cells. UBE2V1 was found to be upregulated in a variety of tumors. UBE2V1 was found to be the downstream target of miR-4689 and a dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify this. In addition, we identified that LINC00460 and UBE2V1 were significantly positively correlated in pancreatic cancer. Downregulation of UBE2V1 significantly\nInt. J. Med. Sci. 2023, Vol. 20\nhttps://www.medsci.org\n1355\ninhibits the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, while overexpression of LINC00460 can partially reverse the inhibitory effect of UBE2V1. Moreover, overexpression of LINC00460 led to upregulation of UBE2V1, while the overexpression of miR-4689 partially reversed the upregulation of UBE2V1. These results indicated that UBE2V1 plays a role of oncogene in pancreatic cancer and LINC00460 can further regulate UBE2V1 expression by regulating miR-4689. A previous study reported that UBE2V1 and its co-factor UBC13 could increase the stability of the p53 protein (42). Here, we found that downregulation of UBE2V1 decreased both wild-type and mutant p53 level. Although Co-IP assays indicated that UBE2V1 does not directly interact with p53, western blot showed that compared with the control group, the stability of wild type and mutant p53 in UBE2V1 knockdown group was significantly reduced. In brief, we showed that UBE2V1 mediates the stability of p53, and that knockdown of UBE2V1 decreased p53 protein levels in pancreatic cancer. Notably, knocking down UBE2V1 in wild-type p53 cells could promote tumor progression, implying that the biological functions of UBE2V1 in pancreatic cancer are p53 context-dependent. Thus, we demonstrated that the role of LINC00460 in pancreatic cancer is achieved by regulating its downstream molecules, miR-4689, and further mediates the expression of UBE2V1. UBE2V1 acts as an oncogene and stabilizes p53 in p53-mutant pancreatic cancer cells. In summary, LINC00460 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by regulating the LINC00460/miR-4689/UBE2V1/p53 axis. There is now evidence to support that USP10 plays diverse roles in different types of cancer (43). For example, USP10 could enhance the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC by stabilizing HDAC7(44), whereas USP10 can stabilize p53 and inhibit breast cancer progression (45). In the present study, we identified a relationship between LINC00460 and USP10 and found that USP10 may be a downstream target gene of LINC00460. RNA pull-down and RIP assays verified that USP10 and LINC00460 were directly combined. USP10 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and positively correlated with LINC00460. Downregulation of USP10 decreased the proliferative and metastatic ability of pancreatic cancer cells. The above results showed that USP10 promotes the development of pancreatic cancer by directly binding to LINC00460. USP10 was reported to deubiquitinate p53, increasing the stability of wild or mutant p53 protein (46). We found that USP10 binds directly to p53, and knocking down USP10 lowers p53 protein levels. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays revealed that USP10\nknockdown promoted the translocation of p53 out of the nucleus, which accelerates the degradation of p53 protein. Western blot assays indicated that knocking down USP10 significantly decreased the stability of p53. Interestingly, the downregulation of LINC00460 expression reduced the stability of p53 and the expression of USP10, and CoIP experiments revealed that the downregulation of LINC00460 partially hindered the mutual binding of USP10 and p53 in pancreatic cancer cells. This indicates that LINC00460 can mediate the expression of p53 by regulating USP10. A particularly important observation was that knockdown of USP10 in wild-type p53 cell lines promoted proliferation and metastasis, suggesting that USP10 could inhibited tumor development under the background of wild-type p53. This result is consistent with other studies (e.g., renal cell carcinoma (46)) which reported that the biological function of USP10 depends on the p53 background, although the precise mechanism needs more in-depth study. In summary, we found that USP10 is a binding protein for LINC00460 and acts as an oncogene in mutated p53 pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, USP10 can regulate the translocation and stability of mutant p53, ultimately promoting the progression of pancreatic cancer. Overall, we found that hypoxia-induced LINC00460 plays a role of oncogene in pancreatic cancer, and upregulation of LINC00460 is closely related to tumor proliferation, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LINC00460 regulates its downstream target UBE2V1 through miR-4689, thereby increasing the stability of p53. In addition, LINC00460 promotes tumorigenesis by sequestering USP10, altering the stability and subcellular localization of p53. In short, hypoxia-induced LINC00460 enhances the stability of mutant p53 through the LINC00460/miR-4689/UBE2V1 axis and by sequestering USP10, and ultimately regulates pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our findings enriched the mechanism of lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer and identified LINC00460 as a possible biomarker for pancreatic cancer."
