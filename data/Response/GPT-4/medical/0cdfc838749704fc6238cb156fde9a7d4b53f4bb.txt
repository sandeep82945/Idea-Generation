Comparative Studies Across Different Educational Institutions: Conduct similar studies across a diverse range of educational institutions, including those with strong religious affiliations (e.g., Catholic or Islamic universities) and public universities with no religious affiliation. This could help to understand if the patterns observed at Skidmore College hold true in different educational and religious contexts, potentially revealing the impact of institutional culture on sexual health practices and beliefs.

Longitudinal Studies on the Evolution of Sexual Health Practices and Beliefs: Initiate longitudinal studies to track changes in sexual health practices and beliefs over time among college students. By following the same participants from their freshman year through to graduation, researchers can assess how sexual health behaviors and the influence of religiosity evolve as students age and gain more independence.

In-depth Qualitative Research on the Role of Religious Upbringing: Conduct qualitative research to explore in depth the role of religious upbringing on sexual health practices and beliefs. This could involve interviews or focus groups with students from a variety of religious backgrounds to gain deeper insights into how their religious upbringing influenced their attitudes towards contraception, sexual activity, and discussions about sexual health with parents and healthcare providers.

Impact of Campus Sexual Health Education Programs: Investigate the impact of campus sexual health education programs on the sexual health practices of students with varying levels of religiosity. This could help determine whether these programs are effective in reaching students with strong religious beliefs and what modifications, if any, could make them more inclusive and effective.

Exploration of Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation: Expand the research to include a broader range of gender identities and sexual orientations. This would involve exploring how religiosity and sexual health practices and beliefs intersect with the experiences of LGBTQ+ students. Such a study could provide valuable insights into the unique challenges and needs of these students in relation to sexual health and contraception.
