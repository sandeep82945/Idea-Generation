In forest areas, a large number of elements backscatter the radar signal within each resolution cell. To reconstruct the vertical reflectivity profile, state-of-the-art techniques perform a regularized inversion implemented in the form of iterative minimization algorithms. We show that light-weight neural networks can be trained to perform the tomographic inversion with a single feed-forward pass, leading to fast reconstructions that could better scale to the amount of data provided by the future BIOMASS mission. We train our encoder-decoder network using simulated data and validate our technique on real L-band and P-band data.",

INTRODUCTION\nSYNTHETIC aperture radar (SAR) tomography (Tomo-SAR) uses a 2D aperture to perform 3D imaging. In the case of a narrow-band radar waveform and under the widely adopted Born approximation at order 1 [1], the imaging process simplifies to the 1D spectral analysis of a set of co-registered 2D SAR images [2]. It aims at reconstructing, for each 2D location, reflectivity profiles in the direction orthogonal to the radar line-of-sight. As illustrated in [3], parametric spectral estimation approaches, which have been widely used for the characterization of urban areas, such as high-resolution techniques [3] or Compressive Sensing (CS)inspired regularized least squares minimization [4], [5], fail to adequately reconstruct the response of forested environments. They indeed estimate a small set of discrete point-like scattering sources, instead of a continuous function, known to represent well the reflectivity of such volumetric media [6].\nAmong the wide range of existing non-parametric spectral estimation techniques [7], the beamformer, i.e. the discrete Fourier transform, and Capon\u2019s filter, also called the adaptive beamformer, are the most widely used to perform TomoSAR\nThis project has been funded by the Futur & Ruptures PhD program of the Fondation Mines-Telecom, and partially funded by ASTRAL project (ANR21-ASTR-0011).\nZ.

The beamformer has a coarse resolution and creates sidelobes, whereas Capon\u2019s sidelobe reduction capability comes at the cost of radiometric accuracy [7]. A parametric solution based on the use of a sparsifying basis able to approximate a continuous function using a small set of coefficients was proposed in [8]. This approach, named waveletbased CS, used a CS-inspired optimization to determine a reflectivity profile constructed using an orthogonal wavelet matrix and a regularized number of wavelet coefficients. Another approach, using a small number of parametric basis functions, was proposed in [9]. The regularized inversion of a linear model of the covariance matrix leads to much more accurate reconstructions, nevertheless the latter estimators, which are themselves non-linear, require costly iterative minimization algorithms that impede their application to large-scale datasets.\nIn many imaging domains, deep learning has made it possible to reduce computation time while maintaining highresolution results. This potential has been harnessed for SAR tomography in [10], where the authors unroll an Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to solve the L2\u2212L1 norm minimization problem posed by CS in urban areas. This approach has been improved in [11], [12], yet most deep learning techniques for SAR tomography over forests focus on ground and canopy height estimation using LiDAR data as a reference [13].\nThis paper presents a supervised deep learning method for tomographic SAR reconstruction in forested areas. Its objective is to recover the reflectivity profile from the coarse profile obtained by the beamforming algorithm. We first use a physics-inspired generation model and interferometric baselines matching our SAR dataset to simulate reflectivity distributions and associated measurements. We then train a network with a light-weight architecture to learn a lowdimensional latent representation of these simulated profiles and to recover the original profiles free from beamforming artifacts. Finally, the neural network is evaluated on real beamforming profiles at L-band and P-band and compared to several methods, showing promising performances both in terms of reconstruction quality and computation time."

The covariance matrix of s is diagonal and is given by \u03a3ss = E[ssH ] = diag(p), with \u00b7H the Hermitian transpose operator. The measured signal covariance matrix can then be expressed as:\n\u03a3 = E[yyH ] = Adiag(p)AH + \u03c32 IN (2)\nIn practice, this quantity is estimated using L independent realizations of the measured vector, {yl}Ll=1, sampled in the neighborhood of a 2D location. The corresponding sample covariance matrix is given by \u03a3\u0302 = 1L \u2211L l=1 yly H l .

For an adequately chosen basis, only a few functions at a time are necessary to approximate a given profile. The vector \u03b1 is then sparse: most coefficients in \u03b1 are zero and the number of non-zeros \u2016\u03b1\u20160 is small, as is the L1 norm \u2016\u03b1\u20161 which is often used as a proxy to measure sparsity. The reflectivity profile p\u0302(CS) = \u03a8\u03b1\u0302 can be estimated using the following minimization problem [8]:\np\u0302(CS) = arg min p\u22650 \u2016Adiag(p)AH \u2212 \u03a3\u0302\u20162F + \u03bb\u2016\u03a8\u2020p\u20161 . (4)\nwhere \u03bb is a hyper-parameter responsible for balancing the weight of the sparsity constraint, with respect to the datafidelity term defined by the Frobenius norm. The pseudo inverse matrix, \u03a8\u2020, in the L1 norm term verifies \u03a8\u03a8\u2020p = \u03b1, and may be replaced with \u03a8H in the case of a unitary orthogonal basis. Solving this problem typically requires several tens or hundreds of iterations of a minimization algorithm and the proper tuning of the hyper-parameter \u03bb.\nRather than using a linear model for the profiles p, nonlinear models such as the generative model discussed in paragraph II-D can be used (e.g., Gaussian mixture models, or exponential profiles [9]). However, inverting such models can be difficult due to identifiability issues and require additional constraints such as order constraints as recently proposed in a different modality of remote sensing for the estimation of phenological parameters from NDVI time series [14]. Our early experiments have shown that it was preferable to jointly learn a non-linear model for p = m(\u03b1) and an estimator \u03b1\u0302 by training a deep neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture. The code \u03b1 in the latent space learnt by the encoder is then turned into a profile by the decoder. The use of a simple feed-forward pass of a light-weight neural architecture leads to an extremely efficient tomographic inversion method, as described in the following paragraphs."

Starting from a ground truth profile created with a defined generative model, SAR measurements y can be simulated using the steering matrix A of a specific geometric configuration. To ease the network training, we propose to provide as input to the network the beamforming profile computed from a multi-look correlation matrix R\u0302 obtained from L measurements y1 to yL. In this way, the network input and output are in the same space, i.e. both positive-valued vectors, easier to manipulate than complex-valued vectors. Besides, the beamforming profile depends less on the interferometric baselines than the correlation matrix R\u0302. It includes the physics of acquisition through the steering matrix.\nThe correlation matrix has been used rather than the covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302 to make the method invariant to differing intensity values. The final reconstruction will therefore be p\u0302 = Tr(\u03a3\u0302/N) p\u0303, with p\u0303 the output of the network, to recover the actual intensity value of the profile.\nWe have chosen to use a simple network architecture with an encoder-decoder going through a latent space of reduced dimension. The choice of this dimension is made to represent the number of parameters describing the profile. The loss used is a quadratic loss between the ground-truth simulated profile and the output profile, a standard choice for regression problems."

The proposed approach therefore aims at learning a latent representation of a forest reflectivity profile from simulated profiles composed of two Gaussians.

The ranges of these parameters are chosen to be large, to cover all possible profiles met in practice. The influence of the choice of these parameters is discussed in section IV."

The corresponding covariance matrices \u03a3 = Adiag(p)AH were built with a steering matrix A randomly selected among steering matrices of an actual tomographic dataset. Circular complex Gaussian samples {yl}l=1..L were then drawn according to these covariance matrices (by multiplying a white speckle noise wl by Adiag( \u221a p)). Sample correlation matrices R\u0302 were computed from each set of L samples yl. The beamforming profiles were then reconstructed:\np\u0303(B)i = aH(zi)R\u0302a(zi)\nN2 (5)\nwhere a is a steering column vector of the matrix A. These beamforming profiles were then used as input by the neural network.\nThe trained encoder consists of 4 linear layers with a decreasing number of neurons (starting with Nz = 512 and encoding the input data in a latent space of size 5) and a symmetric decoder of 4 linear layers. The depth of the network is voluntarily kept small and has been empirically validated, as discussed in section III-A2. Each layer is unbiased and has a leaky ReLU activation function. Training was performed on the dataset consisting of the simulated beamforming profiles, divided into training (75%) and validation (25%) sets, in minibatches of size 32 with an Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 10\u22123 for 200 epochs.\nIn the following subsections, the results presented were computed using the steering matrices of the BioSAR-2 campaign, more thoroughly presented in section III-B.\n1) Analysis of the reconstructed profiles: Fig. 2 shows, for two different simulated profiles, the reconstructions obtained with the beamforming algorithm, Capon filter, wavelet-based CS and our method for 100 speckle realizations in the measurement simulation. As we are interested in comparing the shapes of the profiles reconstructed by each algorithm and since they do not compute the same physical quantity, the methods corresponding to the output power of a filter have been plotted above and the reconstructed and reference reflectivity profiles below. The left profile composed of two large Gaussians favors the spectral estimation methods and shows that the waveletbased CS fails to reconstruct large lobes, while the profile on the right simulates very narrow responses, more suitable for the latter but only roughly reconstructed by Beamforming for the level of noise considered (L = 100). As for the Capon filter, it performs well with low thermal noise, but is very affected when the noise increases, even with suitable diagonal loading. The neural network produces profiles with a width that follows more closely the ground-truth profiles in each case.\n2) Architecture choice: Different latent space sizes were tested to support the intuition of keeping a size corresponding\nTABLE I MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR (MSE) VALUES AFTER 20 TRAININGS DURING 200 EPOCHS FOR EACH DIFFERENT LATENT SPACE SIZES, COMPARED TO A NORMALIZED ERROR BETWEEN THE INPUT BEAMFORMING AND REFERENCE PROFILE.\nLatent space size 3 4 5 6 8 10 15 20\nMSE (\u00d710\u22121) 5.12\u00b1 0.10 4.74\u00b1 0.12 4.65\u00b1 0.15 4.68\u00b1 0.19 4.64\u00b1 0.16 4.68\u00b1 0.18 4.67\u00b1 0.15 4.68\u00b1 0.13\nto the number of parameters needed to simulate a mixture of two Gaussians.

            "text": "Testing was first performed on a tomographic stack of 6 airborne L-band SAR images of a boreal forest in northern Sweden, acquired during the BioSAR-2 campaign led by the DLR in 2008 [15], with a vertical resolution varying from 6 m in near range to 25 m in far range. A local window of around 60 looks is used to compute the covariance matrix used by the beamforming algorithm to compute the tomograms. Fig. 3 shows an example of a tomogram in HH polarization reconstructed with the proposed method, after compensation of the topography. It is compared to the results obtained with beamforming, Capon and the wavelet-based CS method developed in [8], showing that the trained network does indeed improve the resolution of the tomogram compared to spectral estimation methods, while maintaining a representative volume of the tree crown. This is not the case with the wavelet-based CS, which reconstructs narrow peaks and can therefore predict several peaks when this volume is large, depending on the choice of the regularization parameter value.\nThe orders of magnitude of the computational time required to compute these tomograms are given in Table II (all computations are done on one CPU, even the network training). The wavelet-based CS approach was computed using the optimisation library CVX and the default solver SDPT3 [16]. These statistics highlight one of the major advantages of using deep learning to reconstruct forest reflectivity profiles, which is the gain in time of this method compared to classical optimization algorithms. This feature will be even more important when scaling up and applying tomographic reconstruction on an entire SAR image."

            "text": "During training, the network is fed with beamforming profiles computed from samples generated according to a model of covariance matrix. This model, defined in equation (2), neglects several phenomena such as the integration of backscattered complex amplitudes produced by scatterers located in the neighborhood according to the SAR impulse response, or the temporal decorrelation between acquisitions. It could be refined, but our results on real data already show a good\ngeneralization ability of the network trained with this simple covariance model.\nFor the training, we used the steering matrix of a specific campaign to simulate measurements and beamforming profiles that match at best the actual SAR data considered at test time. The network is thus trained for a given geometric configuration and the efficiency of the network may be affected when it differs, in which case a retraining would be required. However, this step is relatively inexpensive in terms of computational time (a few minutes), and tomographic data acquisition configurations in a given spectral band vary only slightly due to hardware constraints and the possibility of ambiguities.\nIn our experiments, the network was trained to reconstruct profiles composed of two Gaussians. It cannot therefore perfectly recover a profile with a single or an extra peak, even with input profiles composed of three very distinct Gaussians. The use of a refined simulation model could further improve the reconstruction quality, which encourages current research on a model representative of different forest types [9]."

            "text": "In this study, we explored the possibility of using deep learning approaches to improve the performance of the tomographic inversion task on forests. Tests on real data show promising results, both in terms of quality and in terms of the computation time needed to reconstruct a large image, with an overhead for the feedforward pass negligible compared to the computation of the beamforming profile and an acceleration by several orders of magnitude with respect to iterative regularized inversion algorithms. This will be essential for the systematic processing of future data from the\nESA BIOMASS [18] mission. It confirms the strong potential of the application of deep learning in this field to super-resolve existing reconstructions.\nIt could also be interesting to consider directly using the measured intensities and acquisition geometry as input to the neural network, to avoid the need to train a different network for each tomographic configuration."
