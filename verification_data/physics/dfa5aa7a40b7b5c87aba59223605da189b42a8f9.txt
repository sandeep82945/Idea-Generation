The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are not explicitly outlined in the provided text. The text primarily focuses on the experimental findings, methodologies, and theoretical assessments of the antioxidant activities of black cumin seed oil, thymoquinone (TQ), and thymohydroquinone (THQ). It discusses the results of the study in detail, including the use of X-ray diffraction, DFT calculations, and electrochemical methods to understand the antioxidant mechanism of TQ and the lack of scavenging ability of THQ. The conclusion summarizes the findings and acknowledges the multidisciplinary approach used in the study. However, specific sentences or sections explicitly outlining future research directions are not provided in the text excerpts shared.
