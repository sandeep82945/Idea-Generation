            "text": "Genomic evaluation is emerging as an integral component of the diagnostic workup to facilitate diagnostic classification, risk stratification, and therapy selection in various cancers including hematological malignancies (1). To identify genetic variants that are associated with each type and subtype of hematologic cancer, such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), oncogenic fusions, larger structural variations (SVs), and copy-number aberrations (CNAs), current standard of care (SoC) employs various, often laborious genetic techniques, including chromosome banding analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic arrays, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although these methods provide clinically relevant information for individual patients, their detection/diagnostic capacities are hindered by low resolution, limited genomic coverage, and/or inability to identify novel genetic alterations, as well as the time and cost associated with performing multiple tests of the same sample. These challenges could potentially be overcome by using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which covers the entire genome and thereby is capable of providing the most unbiased and comprehensive genetic information (2\u20135). Similarly, wholetranscriptome sequencing (WTS) that analyzes sequences of all expressed genes and has the ability to detect gene fusions (2, 6) is a method that may improve disease subclassification (6\u20139). Both WGS and WTS have so far been used primarily as research tools in hematological malignancies but are gaining interest as novel techniques to support diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection in a clinical setting (3\u20135).\nAcute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are associated with clinically relevant SNVs, CNAs, and SVs including gene fusions (10). Since information on specific genetic aberrations today has a major impact on risk stratification and clinical management in both adult and pediatric acute leukemia, comprehensive genomic profiling by WGS and WTS is expected to be highly informative. Yet, studies that assess their clinical utility and health-economic impact compared to SoC diagnostics are limited.\nThe potential of a multi-modal sequencing approach as a clinical test was first evaluated in pediatric patients with various types of hematological malignancies and solid tumors at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (11). This study showed that the addition of WGS (30\u00d7) to combined whole-exome sequencing (100\u00d7)/WTS increased the sensitivity (from 78 to 98%) to identify pathogenic variants known from diagnostic testing (5). Using this diagnostic strategy, potentially actionable targets could also be identified that may facilitate future therapy selection and reduce treatment-related toxicities (12). Similarly, a study in myeloid cancers showed that, compared with conventional cytogenetics, tumor-only WGS (60\u00d7) analysis performed equivalently or better in identifying clinically relevant genetic variants and also changed risk stratification in a proportion (16%) of the patients (13). Together, these studies highlight the potential benefits of comprehensive precision diagnostic testing when used in routine practice, both to replace current SoC testing and to provide additional information beyond SoC. To advance clinical implementation of WGS and WTS, more studies that assess diagnostic efficiency/utility and health-economic impact of these methodologies are necessary."

Specifically, the combined workflow of WGTS will be compared with current SoC methodologies to identify potential benefits and challenges of WGTS implementation in a routine diagnostic setting. This study will also address whether WGTS will improve the diagnostic yield and patient management as well as if these assays combined are cost-effective. The ultimate goal of this study is to evaluate if WGTS can replace current diagnostic SoC methods of patients with ALL and AML across Sweden.\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 842507\nThis manuscript outlines the conceptual and experimental designs for the study."

The retrospective phase, involving WGS of tumor (90\u00d7) and normal (30\u00d7) samples from 150 adult AML patients and 100 pediatric ALL patients, has already been completed. Based on the retrospective data, we will assess technical feasibility and diagnostic efficiency of WGS to detect mandatory and highly recommended genetic variants in AML and ALL and determine to what extent WGS identifies additional clinically relevant genomic alterations not detected by SoC methods. The retrospective cohort was part of the SciLifeLab National Projects specifically focused on WGS, and therefore did not comprise WTS data. In the subsequent phases, we will complement with WTS to enable analysis of clinically relevant expressed fusion genes as well as explorative analysis of e.g., gene expression patterns and aberrant splicing (Supplementary Table 1).\nThe prospective phase encompasses WGTS of prospectively collected samples from approximately 350 adult and pediatric ALL and AML patients (Figure 1). WGS will be performed for tumor (90\u00d7) and normal (30\u00d7) samples, and WTS (50 million read pairs) for tumor samples only. The choice of sequence depth is based on recent recommendations and data from a previous study including acute leukemia samples (4, 14, 15). Samples will be processed in parallel with SoC methods but without a strict time limit for analysis and interpretation. The duration of this phase will be approximately 12 months, starting in May 2021.\nThe real-time validation phase comprises WGTS of prospectively collected samples from approximately 100 ALL and AML patients, as described for the prospective phase (Figure 1). The aim is to perform WGTS and report the results within the required time frame for genetic diagnostics of acute leukemias in parallel with SoC methods. The duration of this phase will be 3\u20136 months.\nDuring the follow-up phase, patient outcome data will be recorded for those included in the prospective and real-time validation phases. At least 2 years of follow-up after the last included patient will be required for meaningful healtheconomic analysis."

Additionally, a health-economic evaluation will be conducted including both a micro-costing and a costeffectiveness analysis.\nClinical grade validation of short-read WGS in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (as a part of the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Genomics England Pilot) demonstrated a high concordance (96%; 79/82 variants) between WGS and targeted NGS for SNV and indel detection (17). Concordance in CNA detection was slightly lower between WGS and FISH (87%; 26/30) or genome-wide high-resolution arrays (93%; 52/56) (17). Many of the discrepancies related to genetic alterations not covered by targeted sequencing or germline mutations filtered out and not reported by WGS (17). A recent study involving a large cohort of patients diagnosed with myeloid malignancies also showed that WGTS accurately detected genetic variants of clinical relevance and provided correct subtype classification (18). Furthermore, a head-tohead comparison of WGS (tumor-only, 60\u00d7) analysis to conventional cytogenetics and targeted sequencing not only confirmed accurate genomic profiling by WGS but also showed\nthat WGS identified additional clinically relevant events in 17% (40/235) of patients and reclassified risk group assignments in 16% (19/117) of patients (13). Shallow WGS and WTS also demonstrated greater sensitivity in CNA detection and fusion detection in AML patients, respectively, compared with conventional cytogenetic analysis (19); concordance was high between cytogenetic analysis and shallow WGS (approximately 96%) or WTS (approximately 99%). Likewise, clinical value of WGS/WGTS in routine care of patients with solid tumors has been shown or is being investigated; e.g., the Hartwig Medical Foundation (20), the MASTER (21), and the WIDE (22) studies. Together, these findings substantiate the ability of WGTS to successfully support comprehensive genomic profiling for precision diagnostics.\nCurrently, there is a debate regarding the appropriate sequencing depth as well as whether normal sample should be included in the WGS analysis. Yet, current consensus for correct somatic variant calling by WGS are read depths of 90\u2013100\u00d7 for tumor samples and 30\u00d7 for the normal control (15). For clear and reliable distinction between germline and somatic variants, comparative analysis of matched tumor and normal samples is also considered imperative (15). Based on the improved diagnostic yield reported by the study of Duncavage et al. that performed tumor-only analysis with WGS at 60\u00d7 target coverage, our tumor-normal analysis using WGS at 90\u00d7 coverage is expected to demonstrate a higher diagnostic performance. Our findings will also help address the current lack of standardized sequencing parameters and metrics for WGS. Furthermore, with the notable advantages of WTS such as oncogenic gene fusion detection and improved disease subclassification (6), additional diagnostic value gained by integration of WTS to WGS will be assessed in our study.\nIn the study by Duncavage et al., the cost of a WGSbased diagnostic approach was estimated to be $1,300\u2013$1,900 (13). However, since the authors of this study performed lower depth of sequencing (60\u00d7) than what is currently recommended (15), the actual price could be higher and prohibitive for a realistic application of such sequencing methods in routine practice. They also used their in-house bioinformatics tools which does not take into account instrumentation and licensing fees by commercial solutions. These factors together likely caused underestimation of the total cost. Indeed, in a separate study, the cost of tumor-normal WGS (90\u00d7 tumor coverage and 30\u00d7 reference coverage) was determined to be >$3,000 (23). Additionally, the cost of WGS-based diagnostics may be higher at smaller clinical centers compared with larger institutions; in the former clinical setting where fewer patients are received, batching many patient samples to save cost is undesirable in the interest of reasonable/expected turn-aroundtime. Following the recommended sequencing strategy and using the matched tumor-normal samples (15), we aim to provide a more realistic estimation of the WGS/WTS-based diagnostic test.\nTo minimize the effects of inter-site heterogeneity in WGTS analysis, all sites will use the same type of sequencing instrument (NovaSeq) and reagents and the same gene lists will be used for variant prioritization. Although all sites will follow the same\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 842507\nprinciples for data analysis, heterogenous in-house developed bioinformatic pipelines could potentially cause variability in variant calling and consequently affect study outcomes. Also, differences in variant filtering and interpretation procedures may give rise to differences. To evaluate this potential limitation, we will perform additional centralized data processing and analysis on all study samples, including analysis using the Illumina DRAGEN platform. This will allow us to pinpoint any major differences between sites due to the custom bioinformatic workflows. It will also provide an explorative option to identify any missed genetic aberrations in either the customdeveloped tools or in DRAGEN, to guide further development of the analytic tools.\nOur study is limited in that slightly different SoC methods will be used at the participating sites. Most of the SoC methods are very similar between the sites (e.g., chromosome analysis and FISH), whereas others may differ (e.g., gene panels). To ensure that SoC complies with the quality requirements all sites participate regularly in quality control rounds issued by CQAS and are yearly reviewed by the Swedish accreditation agency (SWEDAC). A significant fraction of the SoC investigations is also centrally reviewed annually to harmonize procedures. Thus, the final list of reported variants with SoC will be very similar regardless of which site performed the analysis and despite minor differences in methodology between sites. Moreover, annual updates of the national care programs will typically result in minor changes which are unlikely to have an impact on the current study. Similarly, the relevant clinical study protocols are not expected to change during the duration of the current study. Hence, although the SoC methods are slightly more heterogenous between sites than the WGTS approach (which is carried out at a smaller number of laboratories), the study will provide a direct comparison between the WGTS approach and the current SoC for each individual patient.\nIn summary, data from this national study will be used to (1) evaluate clinical performance of the integrated WGTS diagnostic strategy compared with SoC and (2) provide information regarding clinical and health-economic impacts of WGTS implementation in routine clinical care. We anticipate being able to disseminate our findings by 2022 and onward."
