 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the model to consider the possibility of more than one existing facility going out of business. The paper currently only considers at most one facility failing, but allowing for multiple failures could make the model more realistic. This would increase the number of possible states of the world to analyze.

2. Incorporate facility capacities into the model. The current model does not account for capacities of the existing and new facilities. Adding capacity constraints could impact the optimal location decisions. 

3. Develop more advanced competitive location models beyond the gravity model used in the paper. The framework could likely be adapted to work with other models that estimate market share captured. Comparing results across different underlying competitive models could provide additional insights.

4. Consider relocation of existing facilities in response to the new entrant. The current model assumes existing facilities remain fixed, but allowing them to reoptimize their locations could lead to a more dynamic analysis. This could be modeled as a leader-follower facility location problem.

5. Analyze the model with real-world data sets and parameters estimated from data. The paper uses randomly generated test instances. Validating the models and solution methods on real data could be valuable for practical applications. This could involve estimating demand distribution, buying power, attractiveness levels, and distance decay from empirical data.
