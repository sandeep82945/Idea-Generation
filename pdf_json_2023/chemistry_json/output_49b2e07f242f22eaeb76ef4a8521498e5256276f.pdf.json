            "text": "Ruthenium is a versatile and widely used chemical element playing a crucial role in important areas of science and technology. Several applications in the area of semiconductor fabrication or catalysis can be identied, where ruthenium is essential. For extreme ultraviolet lithography masks1,2 or as interconnect metal3\u20135 either ruthenium or rutheniumcontaining materials are very relevant. In catalysis, ruthenium-based catalysts provide remarkable properties in several different applications.6 In addition to this, ruthenium is also of relevance for emerging applications for energy storage7,8 and medicine.9,10\nBut, if X-ray uorescence (XRF) based techniques are to be used for determining the ruthenium content in such materials, one quickly nds that the knowledge of the relevant atomic fundamental parameter (FP) data for ruthenium is very limited: for ruthenium, especially its L-shell FP data and namely the Lsubshell uorescence yields and Coster\u2013Kronig factors (CK), no experimentally determined data seems to exist so far. Available data in the literature is either purely theoretically determined or perhaps even less favorable, only interpolated employing adjacent chemical elements. As these FPs quantitatively describe the process of X-ray uorescence generation, they are very crucial for most quantication approaches in XRF. Thus, they have a direct inuence on the accuracy of the XRF quantication results.\nAs this is a highly inadequate situation, we applied the PTB's reference-free X-ray spectrometry toolset in order to experimentally determine the uorescence yields and the Coster\u2013 Kronig factors of the L-subshells of ruthenium for the rst time. Based on transmission and uorescence experiments on thin\nstr, 2-12, 10587 Berlin, Germany.

To be able to isolate the ruthenium contribution from the total sample transmission, also a blank membrane of nominally identical thickness was used. Any potential moderate variation in the Si3N4 membrane thickness is only a second-order contribution to the uncertainties. Both samples were positioned in the chamber's center by using an x\u2013y-scanning stage. The angle between the incoming beam and the sample as well as the angle between sample surface and detector was set to 45\u00b0.\nThe transmission measurements were conducted in an energy range around the Ru-L absorption edges between 2.1 keV and 4 keV. Furthermore, X-ray uorescence measurements were performed in the incident-energy domain between 2.8 keV and 3.4 keV. The established methodology11,12,19,20 to derive the relevant L-shell FPs from this experimental dataset is described in the following.\nAccording to the Sherman equation,21 the measured count rate of uorescence photons of a one-elemental foil, which is irradiated under 45\u00b0, is the product of the uorescence\nJ.

The corresponding sample-specic attenuation correction factor Mi,E0 is determined by transmission experiments taking advantage of the fact, that the knowledge of the ruthenium deposition thickness d and its density r is not needed since they appear only in a product with the mass absorption coefficient mS or with the subshell photoionization cross section sS.

As a result, more than the directly created holes in L3 exist. The CK-factor f23 provides the probability for this to happen and similar transitions can occur between the L1 and the L2 and L3 shells. So for an incident photon energy above the L1 threshold, the uorescence production factors are dened as:\nseff,L3(E0) = sL3(E0) + f23sL2(E0) + [f13 + f12f23]sL1(E0) (3)\nseff,L2(E0) = sL2(E0) + f12sL1(E0) (4)\nseff,L1(E0) = sL1(E0) (5)\nHere, the sLi(E0) are the photoionization cross sections of the respective Li subshell,19 and fij are the Coster\u2013Kronig factors. For incident energies below the subsequent subshell, the corresponding subshell photoionization cross section is zero (sLi(E0) = 0 for E0 < ELi). Therefore, the uorescence yields are determined for energies E0 above the excitation energy of the considered and below the subsequent subshell.\nAll relevant observables are accessible from the experimental data as mSrd are determined for the relevant energies by measuring the transmission of the ruthenium coating. Fi\nd(E0) is determined by spectral deconvolution of the recorded SDD spectra considering the relevant uorescence lines and relevant background contributions such as bremsstrahlung. F0(E0) and U are known because of PTB's calibrated instrumentation.22\nTaking into account the theoretical ratio of scattering to ionization cross sections, which one can take from databases,23 the sample-specic total photoionization cross section sSrd can be derived. To isolate the subshell contributions of the different sLi, Ebel polynomials23 for each Li contribution as well as a total cross section for lower bound shells are scaled into the data (see Fig. 1). For this scaling process, only the datapoints slightly above each absorption edge are used to minimize the effect of the ne structure.\nWith these determined sLird, the equations for the uorescence production cross sections can be solved for uLi. By replacing sLi by the effective photoionization cross section according to eqn (3)\u2013(5), eqn (1) can be applied also for energies above the next subshell. Therefore, to determine f23, energies between EL3 and EL2 were considered, see Fig. 2: with the already determined uL3, the modied version of eqn (1) can be solved for f23. f12 is determined in the same way but applied for the uorescence of the L2 shell and for EL2 < E0 < EL1 with the already determined uL2. With these determined f23 and f12, from the uorescence of the L3 shell for energies above EL1, f13 can be determined."

The respective uncertainties were\n1304 | J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2023, 38, 1301\u20131306\ncalculated via error propagation. The main contributions to the total uncertainty budget of the uorescence yields were arising from the spectral deconvolution (\u223c2%) and from the photoionization cross sections (\u223c2%). The uncertainty budget is calculated by applying the reference-free XRF approach for the FP determination, discussed in more detail in ref. 24.\nThe X-raylib25 and Krause26 values of uL3 and uL1 are slightly outside of the error domain of the values determined in this work. The agreement with respect to the theoretically calculated data of Puri27 and McGuire28 is better in the case of uL3 but even worse for uL1. The data of Perkins 29 as well as the data by Xu30 behaves very similarly. For uL2, all available data from the literature agrees well with the result obtained here. With respect to the Coster\u2013Kronig factors, the tabulated data in X-raylib and the Krause compilation is in good agreement with our results. However, the results are on or slightly outside the boundary of our uncertainty budget for all three CK values. The data by McGuire and Puri is outside of our results considering their uncertainty budget."

            "text": "The Coster\u2013Kronig factors and the uorescence yields of ruthenium are determined experimentally by applying PTB's radiometrically calibrated instrumentation. The values determined are in reasonably good agreement with the values from the literature, although some literature values are slightly outside the uncertainty ranges of this work. The magnitude of the determined uncertainties of this work is much lower than the estimated uncertainties of Krause26 in the case of the uorescence yield values. With respect to the Coster\u2013Kronig factors, similar uncertainties were achieved here. In summary, this uncertainty reduction will positively inuence the total uncertainties of fundamental parameter-based quantitative Xray uorescence experiments.As stated already in previous works of our group,14,15,24,31 the X-raylib database is also in the case of the Ru-L shell fundamental parameters a reliable reference.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
