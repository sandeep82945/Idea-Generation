    "abstractText": "We consider a discrete version of reaction-diffusion equations. A typical example is the fully overdamped Frenkel-Kontorova model, where the velocity is proportional to the force. We also introduce an additional exterior force denoted by \u03c3. For general discrete and fully nonlinear dynamics, we study traveling waves of velocity c = c(\u03c3) depending on the parameter \u03c3. Under certain assumptions, we show properties of the velocity diagram c(\u03c3) for \u03c3 \u2208 [\u03c3\u2212, \u03c3+]. We show that the velocity c is nondecreasing in \u03c3 \u2208 (\u03c3\u2212, \u03c3+) in the bistable regime, with vertical branches c \u2265 c+ for \u03c3 = \u03c3+ and c \u2264 c\u2212 for \u03c3 = \u03c3\u2212 in the monostable regime.

Here f is the force created by a 1-periodic potential and \u03c3 represents the constant driving force. This kind of system can be, for instance, used as a model of the motion of a dislocation defect in a crystal (see the book of Braun and Kivshar [6]). This motion is described by particular solutions of the form\n(1.2) Xi(t) = \u03c6(i+ ct)\nwith \u03c6\u2032 \u2265 0 and \u03c6 is bounded.\nSuch a solution, \u03c6, is called a traveling wave solution and c denotes its velocity of propagation. From (1.1) and (1.2), it is equivalent to look for solutions \u03c6 of\n(1.3) c\u03c6\u2032(z) = \u03c6(z + 1)\u2212 2\u03c6(z) + \u03c6(z \u2212 1) + f(\u03c6(z)) + \u03c3 1Lebanese University, Faculty of Science (section 5), Nabatiye 1700 Lebanon.

For such a model, and under certain conditions on f, we show the existence of traveling waves for each value of \u03c3 in an interval [\u03c3\u2212, \u03c3+] (see Theorem 1.1). We distinguish three \u201dphases\u201d: \u03c3 \u2208 (\u03c3\u2212, \u03c3+) for bistable nonlinearities, \u03c3 = \u03c3+ for positive monostable nonlinearity and \u03c3 = \u03c3\u2212 for negative monostable nonlinearity. Those three phases match together in a unified picture that we call the velocity diagram. On Figure 2, the diagram shows the nondecreasing velocity function c = c(\u03c3) with respect to the driving force \u03c3 \u2208 (\u03c3\u2212, \u03c3+), with vertical branches c \u2265 c+ for \u03c3 = \u03c3\u2212, and c \u2264 c\u2212 for \u03c3 = \u03c3+. Here the critical velocities c+, c\u2212 are limits in the monostable case of the velocities in the bistable cases\nc+ := lim \u03c3+>\u03c3\u2192\u03c3+ c(\u03c3), c\u2212 := lim \u03c3\u2212<\u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2212 c(\u03c3)\nThe goal of this paper is to show that such behaviour arises in a framework which is much more general than (1.3): the fully nonlinear framework. To this end, given a real function F (whose properties will be specified later), we consider the following generalized equation with parameter \u03c3 \u2208 R\n(1.4) c\u03c6\u2032(z) = F (\u03c6(z + r0), \u03c6(z + r1), ..., \u03c6(z + rN )) + \u03c3,\nwhere N \u2265 0 and ri \u2208 R for i = 0, ..., N such that\n(1.5) r0 = 0 and ri 6= rj if i 6= j,\nwhich does not restrict the generality. In (1.4), we are looking for both the profile \u03c6 and the velocity c.\nTraveling waves were studied also for discrete bistable reaction-diffusion equations (see for instance [7, 11]). See also [1, 22] and the references therein. In the monostable case, we distinguish [21] (for nonlocal non-linearities with integer shifts) and [12, 23, 24, 25] (for problems with linear nonlocal part and with integer shifts also). See also [17] for particular monostable nonlinearities with irrational shifts. We also refer to [16, 8, 18, 9, 10, 19, 26] for different positive monostable nonlinearities. In the monostable case, we have to underline the work of Hudson and Zinner [21] (see also [26]), where they proved the existence of a branch of solutions c \u2265 c\u2217 for general Lipschitz nonlinearities (with possibly an infinite number of neighbors N = +\u221e, and possibly p types of different particles, while p = 1 in our study) but with integer shifts ri \u2208 Z. However, they do not state the nonexistence of solutions for c < c\u2217. Their method of proof relies on an approximation of the equation on a bounded domain (applying Brouwer\u2019s fixed point theorem) and an homotopy argument starting from a known solution. The full result is then obtained as the size of the domain goes to infinity. Here we underline that our results hold for the fully nonlinear case with real shifts ri \u2208 R.\nSeveral approaches were used to construct traveling waves for discrete monostable dynamics. We already described the homotopy method of Hudson and Zinner [21]. In a second approach, Chen and Guo [9] proved the existence of a solution starting from an approximated problem. They constructed a fixed point solution of an integral reformulation (approximated on a bounded domain) using the monotone iteration method (with sub and supersolutions). This approach was also used to get the existence of a solution in [15, 10, 17, 18]. A third approach based on recursive method for monotone discrete in time dynamical systems was used by Weinberger et al. [23, 24]. See also [25], where this method is used to solve problems with a linear nonlocal part. In a fourth approach [16], Guo and Hamel used global space-time sub and supersolutions to prove the existence of a solution for periodic monostable equations.\nThere is also a wide literature about the uniqueness and the asymptotics at infinity of a solution for a monostable non-linearities, see for instance [8, 20] (for a degenerate case), [9, 10] and the\nreferences therein. Let us also mention that certain delayed reaction diffusion equations with some KPP-Fisher non-linearities do not admit traveling waves (see for example [15, 26]).\nFinally, we mention that our method opens new possibilities to be adapted to more general problems. For example, we can think to adapt our approach to a case with possibly p types of different particles similar to [14]. The case with an infinite number of neighbors N = +\u221e could be also studied. We can also think to study fully nonlinear parabolic equations.\nThe present work has been already announced in a preprint [2] that was accessible since 2014 and also in the PhD thesis in 2014 of the first author. Unfortunately, the life conditions of the two authors did not permit the submission to publication of the manuscript. The present paper corresponds to parts I and II of [2]. Part III of [2] will be presented in another work [3], where we study the general Lipschitz monostable cases which can no longer be seen as a limit case of the bistable case.\nNotice also that part of our work can be seen as an extension to Lipschitz discrete dynamics of some results that hold true for classical reaction diffusion equations (see [4])."

Hence our contribution consists in the remaining parts of theorem. The originality of our work is probably more in the statement of the theorem than in the proof itself.\nNotice that there are no monotone traveling waves solutions for 62[ ; + ] because there are no solutions of f ( ) + = 0 in that case.\nNotice also that from Proposition 6.1 in the Appendix, we know that for the Frenkel-Kontorova model (1.1), we have = and c+ > 0 > c , and Figure 2 illustrates the velocity diagram. Moreover for this particular model the velocity function c( ) has a plateau at the level c = 0 in particular if j j < 1. Another example where the velocity isc = 0 is in the special case where F (X 0; : : : ; X N ) = f (X 0) and 2 ( ; + ). This last example is also a situation where the traveling waves are discontinuous, constant on some half lines, and not unique (even up to translations), while we have uniqueness of the velocityc = 0 for 2 ( ; + ). This example also shows that the strong maximum principle may not hold in our general setting.\nNotice also that when c 6= 0, then the solutions are classical, i.e. satisfy 2 C1;1. On the contrary, when c = 0, the pro le may be discontinuous, as we have seen. Indeed, the notion of viscosity solution can be used for any value ofc 2 R. It has also be seen in [1], that for monotone pro les , there is equivalence to be a viscosity solution and to be a solution almost everywhere.\nIn view of Theorem 1.1, we can ask the following (see also [7]):\nOpen question : For a general F; what is the precise behavior of the functionc( ) close to the boundary of the plateau c = 0 (when it does exist) and close to + and ?\nAs a notation, we set for a general function h:\nF ((h(z + ri))i=0,...,N ) = F (h(z + r0), h(z + r1), ..., h(z + rN ))\nand we define\n(1.9) r\u2217 = max i=0,...,N |ri|.\nIn the rest of the paper, we will use the notation introduced in Theorem 1.1."
