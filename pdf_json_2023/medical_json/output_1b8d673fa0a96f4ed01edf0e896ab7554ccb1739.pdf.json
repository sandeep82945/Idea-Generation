Available inactivated vaccines are not e ective in controlling the disease and vaccinated animals can continue to infect newly born calves. Recently, we have shown that a live-attenuated vaccine candidate (pgsN) is protective in goats and calves following challenge with virulent strains of M. paratuberculosis. To decipher the dynamics of the immune responses elicited by both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines, we analyzed key immunological parameters of goats immunized through di erent routes when a marker-less pgsN vaccine was used. Within a few weeks, the inactivated vaccine triggered the formation of granulomas both at the site of inoculation and in regional lymph nodes, that increased in size over time and persisted until the end of the experiment. In contrast, granulomas induced by the pgsN vaccine were small and subsided during the study. Interestingly, in this vaccine group, histology demonstrated an initial abundance of intra-histiocytic mycobacterial bacilli at the site of inoculation, with recruitment of very minimal T lymphocytes to poorly organized granulomas. Over time, granulomas became more organized, with recruitment of greater numbers of T and B lymphocytes, which coincided with a lack of mycobacteria. For the inactivated vaccine group, mycobacterial bacilli were identified extracellularly within the center of caseating granulomas, with relatively equal proportions of B- and T-lymphocytes maintained across both early and late times. Despite the di erences in granuloma-specific lymphocyte recruitment, markers for cell-mediated immunity (e.g., IFN-\u03b3 release) were robust in both injected pgsN and inactivated vaccine groups. In contrast, the intranasal live-attenuated vaccine did not elicit any reaction at site of inoculation, nor cell-mediated immune responses. Finally, 80% of animals in the inactivated vaccine group significantly reacted to purified protein derivatives from M. bovis, while reactivity was detected in only 20% of animals\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 01 frontiersin.org\nreceiving pgsN vaccine, suggesting a higher level of cross reactivity for bovine tuberculosis when inactivated vaccine is used. Overall, these results depict the cellular recruitment strategies driving immune responses elicited by both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines that target Johne\u2019s disease.\nKEYWORDS\nparatuberculosis (MAP), Johne\u2019s disease, vaccine, immunity, live vaccine, inactivated vaccine"

            "text": "Johne\u2019s Disease (JD) is caused by infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) in ruminants characterized by chronic diarrhea and weight loss (1). The disease is also accompanied with significant decreases in milk yield and up to 20% mortality in infected herds resulting in large economic losses estimated around $400 million/year to the dairy industry in the US alone (2). Calves are usually infected during the first weeks of life, mostly from infected adult cows in the herd that shed viable M. paratuberculosis in feces. Infections remain subclinical until affected animals become immunosuppressed (e.g., during calving, transportation, etc.), at which point chronic diarrhea becomes prevalent (3). Immunization with inactivated, whole-cell vaccine, like Mycopar R\u00a9 within 35 days of birth, is the only licensed type of vaccines for dairy cows, sheep, and goats (4). While inactivated vaccines decreased the number of M. paratuberculosis-positive animals, they do not prevent fecal shedding allowing spread of infection within infected herds (5). The inclusion of paraffin oil in some of the inactivated vaccines (e.g., Mycopar R\u00a9) usually enhance the formation of a large granuloma at the site of injection (6, 7), leading to purulent exudate and fistulation in some animals (8). To improve vaccine safety and protective efficacy, we constructed a vaccine candidate (referred to herein as pgsN) using homologous recombination to delete the lipN gene from M. paratuberculosis K10 strain (9). When tested in both the goat (8) and cow (10) models of Johne\u2019s disease, the pgsN vaccine prevented fecal shedding of M. paratuberculosis and induced produced robust T-cell immunity. In this report, we generated a second generation pgsN vaccine by rescuing the antibiotic marker (marker-less pgsN) and evaluated the safety and early immune responses of the version of the pgsN vaccine in goats following subcutaneous (SC) and intranasal (IN) immunizations, in anticipation of developing an easier strategy for vaccine delivery.\nIn 2000, the National Research Council indicated the dire need to fill several knowledge gaps associated with the pathophysiology, immunology and control of JD (11). Several attempts to develop new JD vaccines have been made, including subunit and live-attenuated vaccines. An Hsp70\nsubunit vaccine administrated subcutaneously elicited both antigen-specific antibody responses (12) and mononuclear cell proliferations (13), but did not stimulate protective Th1-type immune responses in cattle (12). A cocktail of four polypeptides [Ag85A, Ag85B, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Map74F] encoded by M. paratuberculosis, induced significant antigenspecific lymphoproliferations and IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vaccinated goats, suggesting the induction of Th1-immune responses (14). With the high expenses of producing a protein cocktail for a subunit vaccine to be used in animals (15), our group and others explored alternatives including live-attenuated vaccines. An auxotroph of M. paratuberculosis with deleted leuD gene was found to elicit protective immunity against JD in goats (16). So far, the leuD mutant was not evaluated in cattle, the main target host for Johne\u2019s disease. To find mutants that could serve as vaccines, we and others screened M. paratuberculosis transposon mutant libraries that identified a few candidates (17\u201321). Using targeted deletions in a virulent strain of M. paratuberculosis, mutants of both relA and pknG genes were evaluated in calves and relA provided protective immunity in a goat challenge model (22). Additional potential vaccine candidates were identified using transcriptional profiling, which targeted several virulence factors encoded inM. paratuberculosis including lipN (encoding a possible lipase/esterase), sigH (an alternative sigma factor important for the stress response) and sigL (an alternative sigma factor involved in virulence) (9, 17, 23). Subsequent analyses demonstrated thatM. paratuberculosis isogenic mutants of lipN (pgsN), sigL and sigH provided protective immunity by reducing tissue lesions and tissue colonization against challenge with M. paratuberculosis in several animal models of paratuberculosis including mice, goats and cows (8, 10, 24, 25). However, how these candidates modulate host immunity to develop protection against M. paratuberculosis remains a significant knowledge gap that need to be addressed.\nIn this report, we generated a marker-less construct of M. paratuberculosis 1lipN mutant (pgsN) (9) where the hyg gene was rescued and the removal of the marker gene was confirmed by whole genome sequence analysis. The safety and immunogenicity profiles of the new construct were evaluated in goats to further characterize early immune responses generated by this vaccine following both SC and IN immunization in\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 02 frontiersin.org\ncomparison to the SC immunization with inactivated Mycopar vaccine. Comparative analysis of the new pgsN construct showed a similar immune profile to the parent strain with the demonstrated safety and tolerance by goats throughout the experiment. More importantly, the psgN vaccine was associated with an induction of T lymphocytes that were few in numbers in the early time post vaccination and increased by the end of the experiment at 6 months post vaccination (MPV), unlike immunization with the inactivated vaccine. On the contrary, large, caseating and mineralized granulomas were developed early on following injection with the inactivated vaccine that continued until the end of the experiment where cross reactivity to bovine tuberculosis test was demonstrated only in this group."

The vaccinal strain was grown in modified Middlebrook 7H9 (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD, USA) (27) to avoid growing in media with animal sources, another requirement for field application of animal vaccines. To ensure the removal of the hygromycin cassette, whole genome sequencing was performed on pgsN genomic DNA using Illumina HiSeq2500 and PacBio SMRT (28). The SPAdes 3. 15.1 software was used for genome assembly. Genome scaffolding was done usingMedusa v1.3 (29). The single contig yielded was aligned to theM. paratuberculosis strain K10 (Accession number AE016958.1) using Bacteria and Viral bioinformatics resource center (https://www.bv-brc.org). The comprehensive genome analysis tool was used to annotate and compare the finished genome to M. paratuberculosis K10. The new construct was then propagated in modified Middlebrook 7H9 (27) until it reached OD600 = 1.0. Then, the culture was centrifuged at 3,200 x g/30min.

The commercial Mycopar R\u00a9 (Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA) was inoculated subcutaneously as directed by the manufacturer. Blood, fecal and saliva samples were collected on monthly basis (Figure 1). Individual rectal body temperature was measured using a digital thermometer. Following subcutaneous injection of vaccines, skin thickness at the site of injection was assessed using a digital measuring device. All measurements for vaccine safety (temperature, skin thickness, body weight) were collected 1 day prior to vaccination and continued up till 3 days post vaccination (1, 2, and 3 dpv) and then once per month for the remaining 6 months.

The response to the PPD injections (skin thickness/induration) was measured using digital calipers at 72 h post-injection.\nFor the IFN-\u03b3 assay, 5mL of blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into vacutainer tubes containing sodium EDTA anticoagulant to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Each blood sample was diluted in equal amount\nof RPMI supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100\u00b5g/mL) (this media will subsequently be referred to as \u201cR1\u201d). The diluted blood was layered over 7.5ml of Histopaque-1077 (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and centrifuged at 400 x g for 30min. Cell layers were pipetted out to add an equal volume of R1 and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10min, supernatant was removed, and 1ml of 1 x BD Parma LyseTM RBC lysis buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was added and incubated for 1min at room temperature before adding 5mL of R1 and centrifugation as before. The cells were suspended in 2mL of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100\u00b5g/mL) (this medium will subsequently be referred to as \u201cR10\u201d) and counted using a hemocytometer. Extracted PBMCs from each animal were diluted to a concentration of 107 cells/ml in R10 and 100 ul of each sample was dispensed into a 96 well round bottom plates. Each sample was represented by 4 wells where 2 wells were stimulated with PPD-j 10 ug/ml + IL-2 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) (400 u/ml) and the other 2 wells were stimulated with IL-2 only (negative control). Cells were incubated for 72 h before harvesting the supernatants for the IFN- \u03b3 ELISA assay (BOVIGAM, Prionics, Omaha, NE, USA) as described before (8). The results of IFN- \u03b3 was expressed as ELISA index calculated as before (9)."

However, we sought to rescue the hygromycin cassette (hygr) (26) to avoid spreading antibiotic resistance genes in vaccinated animals should the vaccine be administered in the field. Following removal of the hygr gene, Illumina whole genome sequence analysis confirmed the lipN deletion and the removal of the hygr cassette (Figure 2). As expected, assembly of sequenced reads were able to identify a whole genome size of \u223c4.8MB represented by a single contig with GC content that reached 69.3%, similar to the isogenic M. paratuberculosis K10 wild type strain as shown in Table 1 (30).\nBLAST sequence analysis of the assembled genome compared to the genome of M. paratuberculosis K10 confirmed the deletion of lipN gene and the removal of hygr cassette.\nThe live attenuated pgsN vaccine is safe\nThe pgsN vaccine was evaluated in goats following immunization by either SC or IN routes up to 6 MPV. All animals were monitored for key animal health parameters such\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 06 frontiersin.org\nas body weight, temperature fluctuations, or development of any signs of illness. All experimental animals survived throughout the study period, and body temperatures were within a normal range at all sampling timepoints (Figures 3A, B). We also monitored the site of vaccination to assess potential granuloma development or any other vaccine-induced skin lesions. As expected, the injection site increased in size for both live-attenuated pgsN-SC and inactivated-SC vaccine groups administered via the SC route. For the pgsN-SC group, the maximum lesion size reached \u223c 8 cm at 2 MPV (Figure 3C), which started to decline by 3 MPV to reach \u223c2 cm by the experimental endpoint. For the inactivated-SC vaccine group, granuloma size steadily increased during the study for all animals, from \u223c20 cm at 1 MPV, to \u223c30 cm by 6 MPV. In addition, granulomas from two animals in the inactivated-SC vaccine group ruptured and required surgical debridement at 4 MPV. The progressive nature of the granulomas and subsequent rupture highlighted some of the drawbacks associated with the inactivated vaccine, which was not seen in the live-attenuated vaccine groups.\nA key aspect of vaccine safety is persistence of the vaccine strain. To confirm pgsN safety, we monitored shedding of the vaccine strain in saliva and feces in addition to collecting tissues. Culturing of saliva and fecal samples from pgsN-vaccinated animals did not yield any mycobacterial colonies, suggesting it is unlikely that shedding of pgsN occurs for either route. At 3 WPV, three animals were sacrificed from each of the four study groups to monitor live vaccine persistence in organs. Although all tissues were cultured for bacterial isolation, only the site of injection and prescapular lymph nodes of the pgsN group inoculated via the SC route yielded acid -fast bacilli (AFB) in the range of 102-105 cfu/g of tissues at 3 WPV. At 6 MPV, culturing of harvested tissues from the remaining animals in all live-attenuated vaccine groups revealed no mycobacterial colonies, indicating that pgsN is cleared from animals by 6MPV, similar to culturing of tissues from animals in the inactivated vaccine group that yielded no colonies, as expected. Overall, the live-attenuated vaccine given via SC or IN routes had little or no negative effect on animal health, while the inactivatedSC vaccine induced large granuloma formation that required surgical intervention in some animals.\nIntralesional immunologic responses to immunization by live and inactivated vaccines\nTo understand the nature of early immune responses generated by the live-attenuated pgsN or inactivated vaccines, we sacrificed animals and harvested organs at 3 WPV and 6 MPV. Histologic sections of harvested organs were examined by routine and histochemical staining for the presence of granuloma formation and mycobacterial bacilli. As expected, sections taken from internal organs of animals in the PBS control group at 3 WPV or 6 MPV did not reveal any histologic lesions. Granuloma formation was likewise not observed in the pgsNIN group. In the pgsN-SC or inactivated-SC vaccine groups, visceral organs such as liver, spleen, intestine, and lung had no significant histologic changes or intralesional bacilli at all examined times. For animals in the pgsN-SC or inactivated-SC vaccine groups with grossly evident subcutaneous granulomas, tissue sections from these injection sites were additionally subjected to immunohistochemistry for CD3 and CD20, which are markers for T and B lymphocyte populations, respectively, to further analyze and confirm the cellular composition of postvaccinal granulomas.\nAt 3 WPV, all animals receiving the pgsN and inactivated vaccines developed injection-site specific granulomas with intralesional AFB (Figures 4A, B acid-fast stain insets). In the inactivated-SC vaccine group, granulomas were additionally observed in regional (prescapular) lymph nodes in 1/3 animals at this time point. In general, pgsN-associated vaccination site specific granulomas were often poorly organized (Figure 4A), with formation of dense sheets of epithelioid macrophages (Figure 4A, top inset), and virtually all macrophages had abundant cytoplasmic bacilli, as shown by acid-fast staining (Figure 4A, acid-fast stain inset). In contrast, in animals receiving the inactivated-SC vaccine, granulomas at injection sites were more organized (Figure 4B), with small, neutrophilic (Figure 4B H&E inset, asterisk) to minimally mineralized caseating centers in which extracellular AFB were present (Figure 4B, H&E and acid-fast stain insets). Furthermore, all animals vaccinated with pgsN-SC had very minimal lymphocytes representing CD3+ T cells (Figure 4C), with virtually no CD20+ B cells detected (Figure 4E) within granulomatous areas. In contrast, in the inactivated-SC vaccine group, granulomas were rimmed by relatively higher lymphocyte numbers, with small numbers of CD3 + T (Figure 4D) and small to moderate numbers of CD20 + B cell lymphocytes (Figure 4F).\nAt 6 MPV, only 1 animal in the pgsN-SC group had a grossly evident (\u223c2 cm) skin induration, which histologically corresponded to well-organized, heavily centrally mineralized, caseating granulomas with absence of intralesional bacilli by H&E (Figure 5A) or acid-fast stains (Figure 5A, acid-fast stain inset). These granulomas were generally surrounded by a\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Safety of pgsN vaccine.

In the inactivated vaccination group, at 6MPV, in addition to the site of injection, granulomas also developed in additional prescapular lymph nodes to affect 5/5 of the animals, with progressive involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes in 3/5 animals. Animals in this vaccine group had larger granulomas that progressed to developing heavily mineralized, large caseating cores (Figure 5B), as compared to granulomas at 3 WPV with this vaccine. Additionally, among these animals, 2/5 had persistence of AFB within granulomas at injection sites (Figure 5B AFB inset) and prescapular lymph nodes (data not shown). Moreover, the inactivated vaccine group had similar proportions of CD3+T (Figure 5D) and CD20+B (Figure 5F) lymphocytes recruited to the periphery of granulomas at all affected sites (and in similar proportions to the 3 WPV time) with formation of lymphoid nodular aggregates at the periphery\nof granulomas at the 6 MPV time point (Figure 5B). In general, both T and B lymphocytes were present in the pgsN-SC and inactivated vaccine groups by 6 MPV.\nThe pgsN vaccine elicits unique and specific immune responses\nIn a separate analysis, we used SCIST to examine recall immune responses in vaccinated animals. At both 3 and 6 MPV, animals from the pgsN-SC and inactivated vaccines groups showed positive reactions against PPD-j that were significant compared to the PBS control quantified by an increase in skin thickness at the injection site at 72 h post injection (Figure 6). Interestingly, the reaction of pgsN-SC to PPD-b was minimal (1 out of 5 animals reacted to PPD-b) and not statistically different from the PBS control group while the inactivated group (4 out of 5 animals) reacted significantly to PPD-b (Figures 6A, B).\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Histopathology of granuloma formation in goats after immunization with live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines at 3 weeks post vaccination.

As expected, both pgsN-SC and inactivated-SC groups induced significant levels of IFN-\u03b3 compared to the PBS group, especially at 2 MPV and forward (Figure 6C). On the other hand, the pgsN-IN group did not show any significant release of IFN-\u03b3 compared to the PBS control group. Finally, commercial ELISA indicated\nthat only the inactivated-SC vaccine group elicited levels of antibodies above the basal levels from the 1 MPV timepoint and onward (Figure 6D). Taken together, SICST, IFN-\u03b3 release and ELISA indicated the biased induction of cellular immunity in pgsN-SC group."

            "text": "Despite the previous availability of inactivated vaccine (Mycopar R\u00a9) for cattle, the control of JD through vaccination has not been successful to date (31, 32). However, the inactivated vaccine was able to delay the clinical signs and decrease shedding\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 11 frontiersin.org\nof M. paratuberculosis in the environment (33). In Australia, >80% of vaccinated sheep flocks still shed M. paratuberculosis (34), risking the introduction of the disease to newly born animals. In a previous study by our group, the vaccine (pgsN) was shown to prevent shedding in challenged animals and elicited cell mediated immune responses (8). In the current study, we examined the nature of the immune responses elicited by pgsN in comparison to an inactivated vaccine, represented by the commercial Mycopar R\u00a9 vaccine (discontinued by the manufacturer in 2020). A significant goal for this study was to examine visible granulomas formed by each vaccine type as a \u201cmirror\u201d to cellular recruitment elicited by live and inactivated vaccines in goats, a relevant model for studying Johne\u2019s disease in ruminants (20). We focused on the first 6 months of vaccination before interference from other agents that animals might face at later times. Fortunately, all parameters used to examine vaccine safety delivered by either subcutaneous or intranasal routes indicated that the live-attenuated vaccine was well-tolerated in animals. However, animals vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine formed well-organized, visibly large and caseating granulomas at the site of injection that persisted until 6 MPV, unlike pgsN-SC vaccinated animals. In addition, by 6 MPV, all animals in the inactivated vaccine group had granulomas at both prescapular (local) and mesenteric (distant) lymph nodes. Granulomas at injection sites and within prescapular lymph nodes of 2/5 animals displayed persistence of AFB. Granulomas at the site of vaccine injection in cattle usually trigger partial condemnation at slaughterhouses with associated reduced value for carcasses (15, 35). Thus, the subsiding of site-specific granulomas, with only 1 animal bearing a small palpable induration in the pgsN-SC group at 6 MPV, combined with absence of histologically evident intralesional AFB and lack of negative overall health effects, would result in less condemnation at slaughter and confirms the safety profile of the live vaccine.\nPreviously, an earlier format of the pgsN vaccine elicited robust T-cell immunity and prevented shedding in vaccinated goats and calves (8, 10). Granulomas formed at 3 WPV and 6 MPV, both are considered early times for the pathogenesis of Johne\u2019s disease (27, 36). Interestingly, granulomas associated with pgsN vaccination showed an initial, apparent delay in lymphocyte recruitment, in contrast, the 6 MPV timepoint had large nodular aggregates of predominantly B lymphocytes that were found to peripheralize the granuloma in the singular affected animal. Granulomas in the inactivated vaccine group were bordered by relatively equal proportions of CD3 + T and CD20 + B lymphocytes and similar numbers were maintained over time (at 3WPV and 6 MPV). Remarkably, CD3 is a known marker for T cells that are activated in response to M. paratuberculosis antigens (37) which needs further analysis that is beyond the scope of this study. This profile is contradictory to the profile generated in goats when another inactivated vaccine, Silirum, was evaluated showing\nCD20 + cells represented the lowest percentage of tissue immune cells (38). Unfortunately, the study goals did not include the analysis of circulating immune cells and rather focused on examining the cellular recruitment to granulomas, unlike the Silirum study. Needless to say, it is hard to link the presence of T-cells in formed granulomas to vaccine protective efficacy since both inactivated and live vaccines were shown a variable level of protection in goats and calves (8, 10). Altogether, these findings suggest that the novel pgsN vaccine induces an initial polarization of immune response toward cell mediated immunity that increases over time, with little involvement of humoral immunity concomitant with a lack of histologically identifiable AFB by 6 MPV. Although similar numbers of T and B lymphocytes were present in equal proportions (irrespective of time points), at the periphery of granulomas in animals receiving the inactivated vaccine, the persistence of these granulomas and intralesional bacteria suggests the difference in immune response elicited by the two vaccines is not related to their ability to recruit lymphocytes.\nThe field usage of inactivated vaccines is limited due to their interference with the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis under field conditions (39, 40). In some experimental infections of calves with M. paratuberculosis, no cross reactivities with bovine tuberculosis antigens were found (40, 41). Unlike these reports, there was a significant cross reactivity to M. bovis antigens in the inactivated vaccine group while only minimal reaction (1 out of 5) among animals in the live-attenuated vaccine group, suggesting it will be more suitable for field application in areas where testing for bovine tuberculosis is practiced. Moreover, the intranasal administration of the live vaccine yielded no skin reaction, nor any systemic immune responses, suggesting inability of this route to provide protective immunity against Johne\u2019s disease. Earlier, oral delivery (another route for mucosal immunization) of live-attenuated vaccine resulted in better immunity (20) than the IN delivery used in this report, suggesting the importance of involvement of gut-associated lymphatic tissues in generating immune responses against JD. In summary, we have generated a marker-less live vaccine (pgsN) that was safe and elicited robust immune responses when administrated via the subcutaneous route but not intranasal route. Administration of this live vaccine was not associated with any negative health effects, unlike vaccination with the inactivated vaccine. More analysis of the cellular responses to this live vaccine in cattle is warranted to profile both resident and immune circulating cells."
