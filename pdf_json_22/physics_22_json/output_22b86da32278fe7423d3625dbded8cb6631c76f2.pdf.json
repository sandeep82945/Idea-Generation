    "abstractText": "In the framework of the low-energy effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), we calculate the production rates of HNLs from meson decays triggered by dimension-six operators. We consider both leptonnumber-conserving and lepton-number-violating four-fermion operators involving either a pair of HNLs or a single HNL. Assuming that HNLs are long-lived, we perform simulations and investigate the reach of the proposed far detectors at the high-luminosity LHC to (i) active-heavy neutrino mixing and (ii) the Wilson coefficients associated with the effective operators, for HNL masses below the mass of the B-meson. We further convert the latter to the associated new-physics scales. Our results show that scales in excess of hundreds of TeV and the active-heavy mixing squared as small as 10\u221215 can be probed by these experiments.",

            "text": "The next 10\u201315 years will see a notable increase in experimental sensitivity to the search for heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), mostly, but not exclusively, thanks to the diverse long-lived particle program that has been initiated at CERN for the future high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [1, 2]. Many new and dedicated \u201cfar-detector\u201d proposals have been put forward in this context: ANUBIS [3], AL3X [4], CODEX-b [5], FACET [6], FASER and FASER2 [7, 8], MoEDAL-MAPP1 and MAPP2 [9, 10], and MATHUSLA [2, 11, 12]. Some of them have already been approved and even deployed. In particular, FASER and MoEDAL-MAPP1 will be taking data during recently started Run 3 of the LHC, whereas the rest of the program is envisioned for the HL phase. Consequently, a number of papers have studied the discovery prospects of these (and other) future experiments for minimal HNLs, i.e. HNLs coupled to the Standard Model (SM) only through active-heavy mixing, see refs. [13\u201318]. Already in the minimal scenario one\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\ncan expect up to four orders of magnitude improvement in mixing angles squared relative to existing constraints, for HNLs with masses up to roughly 5GeV. Similarly, also the main detectors at the LHC can search for HNLs. However, ATLAS/CMS will be more sensitive at larger HNL masses, say, roughly 3\u201330GeV; see e.g. refs. [19\u201323]. Note that ATLAS [24] as well as CMS [25] have already published first results of searches for HNLs using displaced vertices. HNLs could appear also in SM extensions with additional particles, a prominent example being a Z \u2032. For sensitivity estimates for this scenario, see e.g. refs. [26, 27]. However, since the LHC has so far not found any unambiguous signal of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, attention has shifted recently towards effective field theories (EFTs). At the centerof-mass energy of the LHC, one expects that the correct description is the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) (see ref. [28] for a review) or, if we allow also for the existence of light (with masses below or around the electroweak scale) right-handed (RH) gauge singlet fermions NR, the NRSMEFT [29\u201332]. Recently, we have studied the expectation for HNL searches in the NRSMEFT for pair-NR operators [33] and for single-NR operators [34]. However, below the electroweak scale, and in particular, at the scale of meson masses, the massive gauge and Higgs bosons, as well as the top quark, have to be integrated out. The correct EFT in this lower energy regime is then usually called LEFT (low-energy effective field theory) [35], or in case we add RH singlet states, NRLEFT [36\u201339]. The sensitivities of future far detectors at the LHC for the four-fermion NRLEFT operators containing a single NR, a charged lepton `, and a quark bilinear, and thus, triggering decays of mesons (produced in pp collisions at the LHC) into NR and `, have already been studied in ref. [17]. Furthermore, the projected sensitivities of Belle II to the same set of operators have been derived in ref. [40] (see also ref. [41]). Therefore, in the current work, we will concentrate on pair-NR operators and operators with one NR and one SM neutrino, exploring the potential of future far detectors at the LHC. We note that ref. [38] has studied a similar set of operators and derived bounds from current data on the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\u03bdNS) process and invisible decays of light unflavored mesons. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss NRLEFT operators at d = 6 and their matching to the NRSMEFT at d = 6 and d = 7. Then in section 3, we elaborate on HNL production from meson decays in the framework of the NRLEFT. Section 4 gives a brief summary of the experiments we consider and provides the corresponding simulation details. In section 5, we present the results of our simulation. We then close with a brief summary. Technical details of the computations of meson and HNL decay widths in the NRLEFT are relegated to the appendices."

            "text": "2.1 NRLEFT: low-energy effective field theory with right-handed neutrinos\nIn the present work, we are interested in the HNL production from meson decays in an EFT approach. Meson decays take place at energy scales E \u223c O(1)GeV, much smaller than the electroweak scale v = 246GeV. At such energies, the W and Z gauge bosons, the Higgs boson and the top quark are not propagating degrees of freedom, and the effects\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nof potential new physics (NP) associated with a scale \u039b E can be described in terms of the LEFT extended with RH neutrinos (or HNLs), NR. We will refer to such minimal extension of the LEFT as NRLEFT. This EFT respects SU(3)C \u00d7U(1)em gauge symmetry and in addition to the gluons and the photon contains all SM leptons, u, d, s, c, b quarks and, in general, an arbitrary number nN of HNLs. In addition to the renormalizable terms and higher-dimensional operators constructed from the SM fields that have been systematically classified up to d = 6 in ref. [35], the NRLEFT Lagrangian includes operators with NR, which at d \u2264 6 have been constructed in refs. [37, 38]. The renormalizable part of the Lagrangian is given by\nLren = LQCD+QED +NRi/\u2202NR \u2212 [1\n2\u03bdLM\u03bd\u03bd c L + 1 2N c RMNNR + \u03bdLMDNR + h.c.\n] , (2.1)\nwhere LQCD+QED is the QCD and QED Lagrangian built out of the SM leptons (including left-handed (LH) neutrinos \u03bdL without any mass term) and the five aforementioned flavors of quarks (for its form, see e.g. eq. (5.1) in ref. [35]). The superscript c denotes a charge conjugate field, \u03c8c \u2261 C\u03c8T . The Majorana mass matrices M\u03bd and MN are complex symmetric 3\u00d7 3 and nN \u00d7 nN matrices, respectively. MD is a generic 3\u00d7 nN Dirac mass matrix. If lepton number is conserved, the Majorana mass terms are not present. The full NRLEFT Lagrangian reads\nLNRLEFT = Lren + \u2211 d\u22655 \u2211 i c (d) i O (d) i , (2.2)\nwhere c(d)i are the Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators O (d) i , and the second sum goes over all independent operators of a given mass dimension d. The dimensionful coefficients c(d)i scale as \u039b4\u2212d.\nAt d = 5, there are two dipole operators with NR:\nONN\u03b3 = N cR\u03c3 \u00b5\u03bdNRF\u00b5\u03bd and O\u03bdN\u03b3 = \u03bdL\u03c3\u00b5\u03bdNRF\u00b5\u03bd , (2.3)\nwhere F\u00b5\u03bd is the photon field strength tensor. The first of these operators is antisymmetric in the HNL generation indices, and thus, it vanishes identically for nN = 1. ONN\u03b3 is lepton-number-violating (LNV), whereas O\u03bdN\u03b3 is lepton-number-conserving (LNC). The phenomenology of the RH neutrino dipole operator has been studied in ref. [30] and more recently in ref. [42] in the context of the proposed far detectors at the LHC. At d = 6, there are 55 four-fermion interactions, of which 23 LNC [37], 26 LNV, and six operators that violate both lepton and baryon numbers [38].1 The contact operators triggering meson decays into HNLs involve a pair of quarks and a leptonic part, which in turn contains either (i) a pair of HNLs, or (ii) NR and \u03bdL, or else (iii) NR and a charged lepton. The last possibility has been investigated in detail in refs. [17] and [40], in the context of long-lived HNLs that could be produced in meson decays at the HL-LHC and Belle II, respectively. In this work, we focus on the operators with neutral leptons. In tables 1 and 2, we summarize the pair-NR and single-NR operators of interest.

We have checked these numbers using the Sym2Int package [43, 44]. In the group of pair-NR operators, there are four LNC structures and six LNV ones (of which two vanish identically for nN = 1). Among the single-NR operators, six structures conserve lepton number, whereas four violate it.\n2.2 Matching to the NRSMEFT\nIn this subsection, we assume that the NRLEFT originates from the NRSMEFT,2 i.e. the EFT of the SM extended with RH neutrinos [29\u201331]. The NRSMEFT respects the SM gauge symmetry SU(3)C \u00d7SU(2)L\u00d7U(1)Y , and it is valid at energies above the electroweak scale, set by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs, v. In the considered case of the NRLEFT as the low-energy limit of the NRSMEFT, there are no new particles at energies between E and v, and the NRLEFT scale \u039b can be identified with v. At this scale, the two EFTs must be matched. At tree level, the matching of the d = 6 LNC operators has been worked out in ref. [37] and that of the d = 6 LNV operators in ref. [38].3 Below we summarize the results of this matching relevant to the operators of interest. The NRSMEFT operators contributing to the matching relations for the coefficients of the NRLEFT operators from tables 1 and 2 are given in tables 3 and 4, respectively. For the dimensionful Wilson coefficients of the NRSMEFT operators, we use capital C(d)i . They scale as \u039b4\u2212dNP , where \u039bNP v is the scale of new physics. For simplicity, we assume only one generation of NR, while considering a general structure of quark, charged lepton and LH neutrino flavor indices. We denote the quark flavor indices by i , j and the lepton flavor index by \u03b1. Furthermore, we assume that in the NRLEFT, quarks are in the mass basis, whereas the NRSMEFT operators are written in the weak interaction basis. The matching conditions for the coefficients of the LNC pair-NR operators holding at the electroweak scale read:\ncV,RRdN,ij = C ij dN \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijdRZN , c V,RR uN,ij = C ij uN \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijuRZN , (2.4)\ncV,LRdN,ij = V \u2217 kiVljC kl QN \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijdLZN , c V,LR uN,ij = C ij QN \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijuLZN . (2.5)\nHere, V is the CKM matrix defined through d\u2032L = V dL, where d\u2032 and d are flavor and mass eigenstates, respectively.

[17, 45]. For the first-generation charged fermions, such operators contribute, among other processes, to neutrinoless double beta decay [45\u201348].\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nName Structure nN = 1 nN = 3\nd =\n6 (L\nN C ) OdN\n( dR\u03b3\u00b5dR ) ( NR\u03b3 \u00b5NR )\n9 81 OuN (uR\u03b3\u00b5uR) ( NR\u03b3 \u00b5NR ) 9 81\nOQN ( Q\u03b3\u00b5Q ) ( NR\u03b3 \u00b5NR )\n9 81 OHN ( H\u2020i \u2190\u2192 D\u00b5H ) ( NR\u03b3 \u00b5NR ) 1 9\nd =\n7 (L\nN V ) OQNdH\n( QNR ) ( N cRdR ) H 18 162\nOdQNH H\u2020 ( dRQ ) ( N cRNR ) 18 108\nOQNuH ( QNR ) ( N cRuR ) H\u0303 18 162\nOuQNH H\u0303\u2020 (uRQ) ( N cRNR ) 18 108\nTable 3.

Further, sW \u2261 sin \u03b8W and cW \u2261 cos \u03b8W , where \u03b8W is the weak mixing angle, and mZ is the mass of the Z boson. Note that in Zij\u03c8 we neglect the contributions of d = 6 NRSMEFT operators (cf. eq. (2.18) in ref. [38]), since when multiplied by ZN these would lead to d = 8 effects.\nFor the LNC single-NR operators, we have:\ncS,RRd\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = V \u2217 ki ( C\u03b1kjLNQd \u2212 1 2C \u03b1jk LdQN ) , cT,RRd\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = \u2212 1 8V \u2217 kiC \u03b1jk LdQN , (2.7) cS,RRu\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = 0 , c T,RR u\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = 0 , (2.8) cS,LRd\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = 0 , c S,LR u\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = C ji\u03b1 \u2217 QuNL . (2.9)\nWe note that the Higgs exchange contributions (which a priori seem relevant) are parametrically of the same order as d = 8 terms, and thus, can be dropped when working to d = 6 [35]. In the NRSMEFT at d = 6, there is only one operator which violates lepton number, but conserves baryon number, namely, ONNNN = (N cRNR)(N cRNR). It vanishes identically in the case of one generation of NR. Thus, the d = 6 LNV operators in the NRLEFT are expected to get contributions from d = 7 LNV operators in the NRSMEFT. A basis of the latter can be found in ref. [31] (see also ref. [49]). A subset of the d = 7 operators relevant for the matching we are interested in is collected in the bottom part of tables 3 and 4.\nFor the LNV pair-NR operators, the matching conditions read:\ncS,RRdN,ij = \u2212 v\n2 \u221a 2 V \u2217kiC kj QNdH , c S,RR uN,ij = \u2212\nv\n2 \u221a 2 CijQNuH , (2.10)\ncS,LRdN,ij = v\u221a 2 VkjC ik dQNH , c S,LR uN,ij = v\u221a 2 CijuQNH . (2.11)\nFinally, for the LNV single-NR operators, we have:\ncV,RRd\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = \u2212 v\u221a 2 Cij\u03b1dNLH \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijdRZ \u03b1 \u03bdN , (2.12) cV,RRu\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = \u2212 v\u221a 2 Cij\u03b1uNLH \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijuRZ \u03b1 \u03bdN , (2.13) cV,LRd\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = \u2212 v\u221a 2 V \u2217kiVlj ( Ckl\u03b1QNLH1 \u2212 Ckl\u03b1QNLH2 ) \u2212 g 2 Z m2Z ZijdLZ \u03b1 \u03bdN , (2.14) cV,LRu\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = \u2212 v\u221a 2 Cij\u03b1QNLH1 \u2212 g2Z m2Z ZijuLZ \u03b1 \u03bdN .

(2.16)\n2.3 Running of the NRLEFT operators of interest\nBetween the energy scale at which meson decays take place and the weak scale, the Wilson coefficients of the NRLEFT operators evolve according to renormalization group\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nequations (RGEs). These are analogous to the RGEs in the LEFT (without NR) [50], and some partial results for the operators with NR can be found in refs. [17, 37, 38]. Below we provide the one-loop RGEs for the pair-NR and single-NR operators summarized in tables 1 and 2. The operators given by the product of vector currents are renormalized by QED corrections:4\nc\u0307V,RRqN,ij = c\u0307 V,LR qN,ij = 4 3e\n2QqNc\u03b4ij [ Qu ( cV,RRuN,kk + c V,LR uN,kk ) +Qd ( cV,RRdN,kk + c V,LR dN,kk )] , (2.17)\nc\u0307V,RRq\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = c\u0307 V,LR q\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 = 4 3e\n2QqNc\u03b4ij [ Qu ( cV,RRu\u03bdN,kk\u03b1 + c V,LR u\u03bdN,kk\u03b1 ) +Qd ( cV,RRd\u03bdN,kk\u03b1 + c V,LR d\u03bdN,kk\u03b1 )] .\n(2.18)\nHere, c\u0307 \u2261 16\u03c02\u00b5 dcd\u00b5 , with \u00b5 being the renormalization scale; q = d or u; e is the QED coupling constant, Qq is the electric charge of the quark q; and Nc = 3 is the number of colors. The flavor index k runs over u and c for the up-type quarks, and over d, s, b for the down-type quarks. We see that only the coefficients with i = j run, whereas those with i 6= j, which will be of interest to us in what follows, do not. The operators of the scalar and tensor types are renormalized due to both QCD and QED corrections:\nc\u0307Sq = \u22126 ( g2CF + e2Q2q ) cSq , c S q = c S,RR qN,ij , c S,LR qN,ij , c S,RR q\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 , c S,LR q\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 , (2.19)\nc\u0307Tq = 2 ( g2CF + e2Q2q ) cTq , c T q = c T,RR qN,ij , c T,RR q\u03bdN,ij\u03b1 , (2.20)\nwhere g is the strong coupling constant, and CF = (N2c \u2212 1)/(2Nc) = 4/3. Solving these RGEs to the leading-logarithm approximation, we find:\ncSq (\u00b5) = [ g(\u00b5) g(\u00b51) ] 6CF bg [ e(\u00b5) e(\u00b51) ] 6Q2q be cSq (\u00b51) , (2.21) cTq (\u00b5) = [ g(\u00b5) g(\u00b51) ]\u2212 2CF bg [ e(\u00b5) e(\u00b51) ]\u2212 2Q2q be cTq (\u00b51) , (2.22)\nwhere \u00b51 < \u00b5 are two energy scales, and bg and be are the coefficients of the one-loop QCD and QED beta functions, respectively:5\nbg = 11 3 Nc \u2212 2 3 (nu + nd) , (2.23)\nbe = \u2212 4 3 ( Q2ene +Q2dNcnd +Q2uNcnu ) . (2.24)\nSetting \u00b51 = mb and \u00b5 = v, we find\ncSu(v) = 0.68 cSu(mb) , cSd (v) = 0.69 cSd (mb) , (2.25) cTu (v) = 1.14 cTu (mb) , cTd (v) = 1.13 cTd (mb) . (2.26)\n4In these equations, we ignore the contributions from the four-fermion leptonic operators OV,RReN and OV,LReN as well as from the double insertions of the d = 5 neutrino dipole operators.\n5For the beta functions, we use g\u0307 = \u2212bgg3 and e\u0307 = \u2212bee3.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nThus, when running from mb to v, the scalar type operators get suppressed, whereas the tensor type operator get enhanced, cf. ref. [38]. Finally, we note that the contribution to the running from QED corrections is practically negligible. Concerning the running in the NRSMEFT, i.e. between the electroweak scale and the scale of new physics, \u039bNP, the one-loop RGEs for d = 6 operators with NR have been derived in refs. [51\u201353], while partial results for some d = 7 NR-operators (relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay) have been obtained in ref. [45].\n2.4 An example UV completion for d = 7 NRSMEFT\nThe operators including one or two NR in the NRSMEFT can be generated in the ultraviolet (UV) in a variety of ways. For example, ref. [36] discusses all possible leptoquark states that can induce d = 6 NRSMEFT operators. Also refs. [33] and [34] study some example models for pair-NR and single-NR operators at d = 6, respectively, including leptoquark and Z \u2032 models. However, neither of these references gives example models for the d = 7 NRSMEFT operators, to which our low-energy LNV NR operators must be matched. Here, we do not attempt to give a systematic list of such models for the d = 7 operators. Instead, we will briefly discuss one concrete, but very typical UV model as an example. This example model generates the operator OQNdH . For the other d = 7 operators containing one or two NR, other UV models can be constructed in an analogous manner. Our example model contains two scalar leptoquark states, S1 \u223c (3,1)\u22121/3 and S2 \u223c (3,2)1/6, with the numbers inside parentheses denoting the (SU(3)C , SU(2)L) representations and the subscript standing for the hypercharge. Apart from the mass and kinetic terms for the leptoquark states, the model allows to write down the following interactions, in addition to the SM Lagrangian:\nL \u2283 \u2212 [ YQNQNRS2 + YNdN cRdRS \u2020 1 + \u00b5HS \u2020 2S1 + h.c. ] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.27)\nwhere, for simplicity, we have suppressed generation indices. Note that this Lagrangian violates lepton number, but lepton number is recovered in the limit \u00b5\u2192 0 [54]. Integrating out both leptoquarks will produce OQNdH with CQNdH = (\u00b5YQNYNd)/(m2S1m 2 S2\n). In the limit \u00b5 = mS1 = mS2 = \u039bNP, this gives the correct CQNdH \u221d \u039b\u22123NP dependence for a d = 7 operator, as expected. Clearly, this model will also generate d = 6 operators with NR. For example, the term proportional to YQN (YNd) times its hermitian conjugate will generate OQN (OdN ). However, these are only examples, as actually more d = 6 operators can be generated in this model; note the dots in eq. (2.27)."

In this section, we focus on the meson decay modes triggered by the operators with two quarks and two neutral leptons (either a pair of NR, or NR and \u03bdL) discussed in section 2. Given their large production rates at the LHC, we focus on pseudoscalar mesons containing either a c or b quark and a light quark, i.e. D- and B-mesons. Vector mesons with the same quark content have much smaller lifetimes, and thus, their contribution in the HNL production is sub-dominant [17]. In figure 1, we depict two- and three-body pseudoscalar meson decays triggered by the effective operators of interest. The same NRLEFT operator induces a leptonic twobody decay as well as contributes to a number of semi-leptonic three-body decays. In the diagram corresponding to the three-body decay, q can be any quark but top, since the latter does not form bound states and is not present in the spectrum of the NRLEFT. For the transition qj \u2192 qi with i 6= j, both quarks have to be of either the up- or down-type, since the operators considered involve quark bilinears with zero electric charge. In addition, mqj > mqi for the decay to be kinematically allowed.6 These considerations lead to the following four possibilities: c\u2192 u (for the up-quark sector), and b\u2192 d, b\u2192 s and s\u2192 d (for the down-quark sector). Below we discuss each of them in detail.\n\u2022 The operators with qj = c and qi = u lead to the leptonic two-body decays D0 \u2192 NN and D0 \u2192 \u03bdN .7 In addition, they generate the following transitions resulting in semi-leptonic three-body decays: D0 \u2192 \u03c00 , \u03b7 , \u03b7\u2032 (\u03c10 , \u03c9) for q = u; D+ \u2192 \u03c0+ (\u03c1+) for q = d; D+s \u2192 K+ (K\u2217+) for q = s; \u03b7c \u2192 D0 (D\u22170) for q = c; and B+c \u2192 B+ (B\u2217+) for q = b. Here, the final states outside (inside) parentheses are pseudoscalar (vector) mesons. In what follows, we will not take into account the decays of \u03b7c and B+c .

[59].\n\u2022 The operators with qj = b and qi = d,8 induce B0 \u2192 NN and B0 \u2192 \u03bdN decays, as well as the following transitions: B+ \u2192 \u03c0+ (\u03c1+) for q = u; B0 \u2192 \u03c00 , \u03b7 , \u03b7\u2032 (\u03c10 , \u03c9) for q = d; B0s \u2192 K0 (K\u22170) for q = s; B+c \u2192 D+ (D\u2217+) for q = c; and \u03b7b \u2192 B0 (B\u22170) for q = b. Again, we will not consider the decays of B+c as well as those of \u03b7b.\n\u2022 The operators with qj = b and qi = s give rise to B0s \u2192 NN and B0s \u2192 \u03bdN decays. They also contribute to B+ \u2192 K+ (K\u2217+) for q = u; B0 \u2192 K0 (K\u22170) for q = d; B0s \u2192 \u03b7 , \u03b7\u2032 (\u03c6) for q = s; B+c \u2192 D+s (D\u2217+s ) for q = c; and \u03b7b \u2192 B0s (B\u22170s ) for q = b.\n\u2022 The operators with qj = s and qi = d trigger K0 \u2192 NN and K0 \u2192 \u03bdN decays, as well as the following transitions: K+ \u2192 \u03c0+ for q = u; K0 \u2192 \u03c00 for q = d; \u03b7\u2032 \u2192 K0 (K\u22170) for q = s; D+s \u2192 D+ for q = c; and B0s \u2192 B0 (B\u22170) for q = b. We will not consider these decay modes in what follows. This is because for the listed D+s and B0s decays, the available mass window is very small, and for the light mesons\u2019 decays (kaons and \u03b7\u2032), the numerical predictions from Pythia8 [60, 61], which we will use for numerical simulation in this work, do not agree well with the LHCf experiment [62].\nWe have computed the corresponding partial decay widths assuming both N and \u03bd are (i) Dirac and (ii) Majorana particles. In appendix A, we provide the formulae for the two-body decay widths and the three-body decay amplitudes in both cases. To compute the three-body decay widths, we have used the procedure described in ref. [17]. We summarize it in appendix A.2 for completeness. If the products of HNL decays are not detected, the modes we consider here contribute to the P \u2192 inv. or P \u2192 P \u2032/V \u03bd\u03bd decays. The existing upper limits on the branching ratios of such decays are listed in table 5. In what follows, we will take these constraints into account. In figure 2, we show the branching ratios of D- and B-meson decays induced by the LNC pair-NR operators OV,RRuN,12 (top), O V,RR dN,31 (middle) and O V,RR dN,32 (bottom), assuming N is\n8In figure 1, we need to send q \u2192 q and qj,i \u2192 qj,i to match the particle content of B-mesons.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nMajorana. We turn on one operator at a time, setting the corresponding Wilson coefficient to 10\u22123v\u22122. This choice allows us to avoid the bounds from (semi-)invisible meson decays summarized in table 5. We see that the two-body decay dominates over the three-body ones for mN & 325MeV in the case of OV,RRuN,12, for mN & 1.2GeV in the case of O V,RR dN,31, and for mN & 1.05GeV in the case of OV,RRdN,32. For small mN , the two-body decay is suppressed, since the corresponding decay width is proportional to m2N , see eq. (A.13) in appendix A. Turning on the LR operators OV,LRuN,12, O V,LR dN,31, and O V,LR dN,32 (one at a time) would lead to the same results as can be seen from eqs. (A.13), (A.24) and (A.25). In figure 3, we display the branching ratios of the same meson decays, but this time triggered by the LNV pair-NR operators OS,RRuN,12 (top), O S,RR dN,31 (middle), and O S,RR dN,32 (bottom). Again, we turn on one operator at a time and set the corresponding Wilson coefficient to 10\u22123v\u22122.9 Contrary to the LNC operators, now the leptonic two-body decays dominate for all kinematically available values of mN , since there is no helicity suppression from mN , cf. eq. (A.13). Switching on the LR operators OS,LRuN,12, O S,LR dN,31, and O S,LR dN,32 (one at a time) would lead to the same results as can be inferred from eqs. (A.13), (A.24), and (A.25). The tensor operators OT,RRdN and O T,RR uN vanish identically for one generation of NR. For this reason, we do not consider them in what follows. Concerning single-NR operators, we have also studied their contribution to two- and three-body D- and B- meson decays, showing some results in appendix B. In particular, we present in figure 8 the branching ratios of B-meson decays induced by the LNC operators OS,RRd\u03bdN,31\u03b1 and O T,RR d\u03bdN,31\u03b1 and the LNV operator O V,RR d\u03bdN,31\u03b1. We observe that our results are analogous to the ones obtained in ref. [17], cf. figure 2 therein, for single-NR operators including a charged lepton. Therefore, we expect the constraints derived from the far detectors to be essentially the same for the neutral-current single-NR operators, and we hence do not include the latter in our numerical simulation. Before closing the section, we mention that with only one NR generation, pair-NR operators cannot make the HNL decay by themselves, in contrast to single-NR operators. In appendix C, we have computed the partial decay widths of HNLs into a light meson and an active neutrino triggered by the neutral single-NR operators. Since we only simulate HNLs produced by pair-NR operators and only turn on one NRLEFT operator at a time, we consider that the HNL decay is exclusively due to active-heavy neutrino mixing. The partial decay widths of HNL via mixing are computed according to the formulae given in refs. [17, 55, 63]."

These programs were mostly proposed in recent years and include ANUBIS [3], AL3X [4], CODEX-b [5], FACET [6], FASER and FASER2 [7, 8], MAPP1 and MAPP2 [9, 10],\n9In the case of non-hermitian operators, as e.g. OS,RRqN , q = u or d, \u201cone operator at a time\u201d means cS,RRqN,ij 6= 0, whereas c S,RR qN,ji = 0.

Since they are supposed to be operated at different interaction points (IPs) and time scales of the LHC, the projected integrated luminosities also vary, ranging from as low as 30 fb\u22121 for MAPP1, up to the full HL-LHC target, 3 ab\u22121 for ANUBIS, FACET, FASER2, and MATHUSLA. Moreover, typically these far detectors are located with a distance of O(1)\u2212O(100) m to their corresponding IP, allowing for sufficient amount of rock, lead, or other shielding material to effectively remove the potential SM background events stemming from the IP. As a result, vanishing background is usually assumed for phenomenological studies on these experiments.\nHere, we study HNLs pair-produced at the LHC with the center-of-mass energy \u221a s =\n14TeV from charm and bottom mesons\u2019 rare decays mediated by a NRLEFT operator. These HNLs then travel a certain distance before decaying via their mixing with the SM active neutrino. If the boosted decay length of the HNLs falls into a suitable range, the HNLs have a high probability of decaying inside some of the far detectors. Since the HNLs mostly decay to channels that are not fully invisible (three active neutrinos), the decay vertex can be reconstructed by these experiments.\nWhile we analytically compute the production and decay rates of the HNLs, we rely on a Monte-Carlo simulation tool, Pythia8.3 [60, 61], to estimate the decay probabilities of the HNLs inside each of the far detectors. Depending on the flavor indices of the EFT operator we choose to turn on, Pythia8 can generate either the pp\u2192 cc\u0304 or pp\u2192 bb\u0304 process inclusively for D- or B-meson production at the LHC, respectively. These mesons then decay to different channels including at least two HNLs, with relative decay branching ratios implemented according to the analytical computation detailed in section 3. This allows for maximal usage of all the simulated data while respecting the relative importance of each decay channel. Since Pythia8 provides the kinematics of each simulated HNL, we can compute its decay probability in each detector according to the geometry and position with respect to the IP. We then take the average of the decay probabilities of all the simulated HNLs, to obtain the expected acceptance rate at each detector, \u3008P [N decay]\u3009. This allows us to compute the projected number of signal events, NS , with the following equation:\nNS = \u2211 i 2 \u00b7NMi \u00b7 BR(Mi \u2192 NN + anything) \u00b7 \u3008P [N decay]\u3009 \u00b7 BR(N \u2192 vis.), (4.1)\nwhere the factor 2 accounts for the fact that each decay of the mesons into the HNLs via the NRLEFT operator includes two HNLs, NMi is the number of the mother mesons, and BR(N \u2192 vis.) denotes the decay branching ratio of the HNLs into visible final states. For our study, we consider only the decay channel into three active neutrinos to be invisible.\nIn table 6, we reproduce the inclusive production rates of all the relevant types of heavy mesons from ref. [17], which were obtained therein combining both LHCb measurements and extrapolation with the state-of-the-art simulation tools FONLL [64, 65] and Pythia8. Note that in table 6 we have in addition multiplied the production rates of these heavy mesons given in ref. [17] by a factor of 1.08 and 1.06 for the B- and D-mesons, respectively, in order to take into account the fact that we consider \u221a s = 14TeV instead of 13TeV [16].\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nIn principle, the computation of the decay probability of each HNL can be summarized with a simple formula, if the flight path of the HNL traverses the detector:\nP [N decay] = e\u2212L1/\u03b2\u03b3c\u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212L2/\u03b2\u03b3c\u03c4 , (4.2)\nwhere \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03c4 are the speed, Lorentz boost factor, and the proper lifetime of the HNL, c is the speed of light, and L1 and L2 label respectively the distance from the IP (where we assume the heavy mesons decay into the HNLs instantly) to the incoming and outgoing sides of the detector. This formula holds perfectly for a far detector with a spherical-shell shape facing towards the IP. However, since the far-detector experiments mostly have a more complicated geometrical shape and relative orientation with respect to the IP, more sophisticated formulae are required for more accurate estimate of the decay probability. In this paper, we strictly follow ref. [17] for computing the decay probabilities in each far detector with the corresponding geometrical configuration. As exception, FACET [6] was not included in ref. [17], so here, we give a brief description of this detector. Its concept is essentially rather similar to that of FASER(2) and AL3X. It is a proposed cylindrical detector in the forward direction of the CMS experiment, with a distance of 101 m between the CMS IP and its near end. Further, it has a radius of 0.5 m and length 18 m. However, it does not cover the pseudorapidity up to infinity as FASER(2) does; instead, it covers the polar angle between 1 and 4 mrad, or equivalently, the pseudorapidity between 6.2 and 7.6. We require that the HNLs travel towards the far end of the FACET decay chamber (but not to the sides). Before closing, we should also mention that since Pythia8 is not well validated for heavy meson production in the very forward direction, we use FONLL to correct the differential production cross section of mesons for various ranges of small transverse momentum and large pseudorapidity, for three experiments: FACET, FASER, and FASER2."

We restrict ourselves to Majorana HNLs, and study the LNC and LNV pair-NR operators in the NRLEFT triggering the meson decays described in section 3. More specifically, the set of the LNC operators we consider is OV,RRuN,12, O V,RR dN,31, and O V,RR dN,32, and the set of the LNV operators is O S,RR uN,12, OS,RRdN,31, and O S,RR dN,32.10 We first show in figures 4 and 5 sensitivity reaches of the various\n10We recall that the corresponding LR operators, if switched on one at a time, would lead to the same results.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nfar detectors we consider, in the plane |VlN |2 vs. mN , for the LNC and LNV operators, respectively. These isocurves are for three signal events, corresponding to 95% confidence level (C.L.) limits, given zero background events. We switch on one operator only each time and fix the corresponding Wilson coefficient to 10\u22123v\u22122, where v = 246GeV is the SM Higgs VEV. This is approximately 700 times smaller than the Fermi constant and, for the LNC operators, corresponds to a NP scale \u039bNP of 7.78TeV for c \u223c 1/\u039b2NP. For this value of the Wilson coefficient, the limits coming from the D0 and B0 invisible decays, as well as from P \u2192 P \u2032/V \u03bd\u03bd, are avoided (see section 3). In our numerical simulation, we consider the HNLs only dominantly mixing with either the electron neutrino or the muon neutrino: l = e, \u00b5. We do not consider HNLs decaying to \u03c4 \u2019s, because we expect the sensitivities to be much reduced, compared to e, \u00b5.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nIn figure 4, we observe that in the top-right and bottom-left plots, there is stronger reach in mN than in the top-left plot. This is due to the larger masses of B-mesons than those of D-mesons and hence higher kinematic thresholds. Moreover, the B-meson scenarios show better exclusion limits in |VlN |2 as well, compared to the D-meson one, despite the larger production rates of D-mesons than those of B-mesons by about one order of magnitude, cf. table 6. The main reason is that the decay branching ratios of B-mesons into the HNLs are in general larger than those of D-mesons by about two orders of magnitude, cf. figure 2, assuming equal values of the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Among these far-detector experiments, we find the best limits come from MATHUSLA, which can probe the values of |VlN |2 down to 10\u221212 (10\u221215) in the charm (bottom) scenario(s), followed by ANUBIS and AL3X, while FASER shows the weakest sensitivities, mainly because of its small volume. We note that the approved experiment MAPP1 with only 30 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity can already compete with the future experiment FASER2\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nwith the full HL-LHC data, especially in the bottom scenarios. The reason is its larger size and smaller distance to the corresponding IP. Also, CODEX-b, MAPP2, and FACET can exclude almost the same parts of the parameter space. The plots in figure 5 are very similar to those in figure 4, with the main difference being that the exclusion limits in |VlN |2 are slightly stronger because the decay branching ratios of the mesons into a pair of HNLs are larger in the LNV case than in the LNC case, given the same value of the Wilson coefficients, see figures 2 and 3. The best present limits for HNL masses below 5GeV that can be found in the literature come from different experiments such as NA62 [66], T2K [67], CHARM [68], PS191 [69], JINR [70], Belle [71], and DELPHI [72]. These limits are around |VlN |2 \u223c 10\u22129\u201310\u22125, depending on the HNL mass, and correspond to a minimal HNL scenario in which both the production and the decay of the HNL are determined by their mixing with the active neutrinos. In our theoretical setup, however, the production of the HNLs receives additional contributions from effective operators affecting the HNL sensitivity of these experiments. A detailed reinterpretation of the current HNL limits coming from different experiments in the NRLEFT depends on specific details of each particular experiment, and it is beyond the scope of this current work. For this reason, we do not show these bounds in figures 4 and 5. We then present in figures 6 and 7 the sensitivity curves in the plane c vs. mN , for two fixed values of active-heavy mixing, |VlN |2 = 10\u22127 and |VlN |2 = 10\u221210. In order to obtain these plots, we select the chosen benchmark mixing parameters and find the value of the Wilson coefficient in each scenario such that the predicted number of signal events is equal to three. We find the same hierarchy in sensitivities of these experiments as in figures 4 and 5, but the final reaches in c differ between the two chosen |VlN |2 values. This is because for any fixed HNL mass, varying the mixing parameter squared would change the proper lifetime of the HNL and hence the detectors\u2019 acceptance to these HNLs. |VlN |2 = 10\u22127 corresponds to an acceptance rate roughly three orders of magnitude better than that given by |VlN |2 = 10\u221210, in the large decay length limit (\u03b2\u03b3c\u03c4 L1, L2, as in eq. (4.2)). Therefore, the lower sensitivity reach in c for |VlN |2 = 10\u221210 is roughly weaker than that for |VlN |2 = 10\u22127, by a factor of \u221a 1000 \u2248 32, since the HNL production rates are proportional to c2. In the charm scenario, for the larger mixing parameter case, we find the best experiments (MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and AL3X) can reach c as low as about 10\u22124 TeV\u22122, while the other weaker experiments can still probe c down to the order of 10\u22123 TeV\u22122 except FASER, or even better by about one order of magnitude in the two bottom scenarios. In the LNC case, c \u223c 10\u22124 (10\u22125)TeV\u22122 corresponds roughly to a new physics scale \u039bNP of 100 (316) TeV, if we take c \u223c 1/\u039b2NP and ignore the relatively minor effects of QCD running. Again as in figures 4 and 5, we find the LNV results in figure 7 are slightly stronger than the LNC ones in figure 6, for the same reason as stated above. Here, the conversion from Wilson coefficient to \u039bNP is more subtle than the LNC operators\u2019 case, because the d = 6 LNV operators at the scale below v = 246GeV are matched to the d = 7 operators that include a Higgs boson in the NRSMEFT, cf. eq. (2.10). Therefore, we estimate that for c \u223c 10\u22124 (10\u22125)TeV\u22122, the corresponding \u039bNP is about 10 (21)TeV, with c \u223c v/(2 \u221a 2\u039b3NP),\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nif we again ignore the QCD running effects. This is weaker than the LNC case by about one order of magnitude. The gray shaded regions in figures 6 and 7 correspond to the limits coming from invisible and semi-invisible D- and B-meson decays collected in table 5. More specifically, in the c\u2192 u scenario, it is D0 \u2192 inv. which provides the only constraint. In the b\u2192 d scenario and for the LNC operator (middle-row plots in figure 6), there is an interplay between B0 \u2192 \u03c00\u03bd\u03bd, which dominates for mN . 1.3GeV, and B0 \u2192 inv., which takes over for larger HNL masses. For the LNV operator (figure 7), B0 \u2192 inv. provides the most stringent constraint for any kinematically allowed mN . Finally, in the b \u2192 s scenario, the leading bound originates from the limit on the branching ratio of B+ \u2192 K+\u03bd\u03bd. All these bounds have been derived by equating BR(P \u2192 NN) (BR(P \u2192 P \u2032NN)) obtained using eq. (A.13) (eq. (A.24)) to the corresponding upper limit on BR(P \u2192 inv.) (BR(P \u2192 P \u2032\u03bd\u03bd)) from table 5."

            "text": "In this work, we have focused on dimension-6 operators involving a pair of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), in the framework of the low-energy effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with HNLs (NRLEFT). We have considered both lepton-number-conserving (LNC) and lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. Such operators with certain quark-flavor combinations can lead to charm and bottom meson decays into a pair of HNLs, in either two-body or three-body decays. We have considered three combinations of the quark flavor indices, leading to the c\u2192 u, b\u2192 d, and b\u2192 s transitions, and computed the corresponding production rates of the HNL pair from various D- and B-meson decays for (i) the LNC operators OV,RRuN,12, O V,RR dN,31, and O V,RR dN,32, and (ii) the LNV operators O S,RR uN,12, O S,RR dN,31, and OS,RRdN,32. The corresponding decay branching ratios for both LNC and LNV cases are shown in figures 2 and 3, respectively. Switching on the corresponding LR operators (one at a time) would lead to the same results. It is interesting to observe that for the LNC case, the mesons\u2019 three-body and two-body decays are dominant, respectively, for relatively lower and higher masses in the kinematically allowed range of the HNL mass, for all three quark-flavor scenarios. On the other hand, for the LNV case, the two-body decays are the most important channel for the whole kinematically relevant mass range. Since these operators entail a pair of HNLs and in the absence of other effective interactions, HNLs can decay only via an additional HNL mixing with the active neutrinos in the weak current.11 Therefore, we study HNL production from the EFT operators, and HNL decays through active-heavy neutrino mixing. Since we focus on GeV-scale HNLs, small neutrino mixing parameters naturally lead these HNLs to become long-lived. Here, we choose therefore to consider a series of far-detector proposals at the LHC. These include AL3X, ANUBIS, CODEX-b, FACET, FASER and FASER2, MAPP1 and MAPP2, and MATHUSLA. These experiments have been proposed (some even approved and operated) mainly for searching for long-lived particles (LLPs) and would be constructed with a\n11Actually, an HNL can also decay through a pair-NR operator in conjunction with mixing, but such decays are suppressed compared to the decays through mixing alone.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\ndistance of about 5\u2013500 meters away from different interaction points (IPs). With shielding materials on site between a far detector and its corresponding IP, such experiments are usually assumed to be background-free for LLP searches. We then perform Monte-Carlo simulation with the tool Pythia8, to estimate the acceptance rates of these far detectors for HNLs pair-produced from D- and B-meson decays. For small mixing and mass, these HNLs are long-lived and decay outside the LHC main detectors. With the total production rates of the mesons at the LHC in knowledge, we can estimate the number of HNL decays in the far detectors, using decay width formulae for (i) the HNL production from meson decays in the NRLEFT, and (ii) the HNL decays via their mixing with the active neutrinos. For simplicity, we consider the HNLs to be mixed with only either the electron neutrino or the muon neutrino. Further, for the signal, we consider only the HNL decays into three active neutrinos to be invisible; all the other decay channels are included as signature. We show our numerical results in two types of planes: |VlN |2 vs. mN in figures 4 and 5, and c vs. mN in figures 6 and 7. For all these results, we consider both LNC and LNV dimension-six operators, for all three quark-flavor scenarios. In general, we find the constraints on the LNV operators to be slightly stronger than those on the LNC ones, because the meson decay branching ratios into HNLs in the LNV case are larger by about one order of magnitude than those in the LNC case (for the same value of the corresponding Wilson coefficients); see figures 2 and 3. Among all the studied far detectors, we find MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and AL3X show the best sensitivities, while FASER is usually the weakest. Compared to FASER2, MAPP1 achieves very similar results with 100 times less data, mainly as a result of its much larger volume and closer distance to the IP. In the |VlN |2 vs. mN plots, we find these experiments can probe |VlN |2 as low as 10\u221215\u201310\u22126, for GeV-scale HNLs. Then, for two fixed benchmark values of |VlN |2 = 10\u22127 and |VlN |2 = 10\u221210, we obtain the sensitivity reach in the Wilson coefficients c as functions of the HNL mass, for these far-detector experiments. We further convert c to the newphysics (NP) scale \u039bNP. We find for |VlN |2 = 10\u22127, the considered experiments can probe the NP scale up to between approximately 10 and several hundred TeV depending on the type of the operator considered, while for |VlN |2 = 10\u221210, the reach in \u039bNP is reduced by slightly less than one order of magnitude, as a result of the larger decay length and hence smaller acceptance."

            "heading": "A Pseudoscalar meson decays into HNLs",
            "text": "The four-fermion interactions described by the NRLEFT operators in tables 1 and 2 lead to two-body and three-body meson decays, if the HNL mass is small enough. The former involve two neutral leptons in the final state, whereas the latter correspond to semileptonic decays with an additional lighter meson within the final products. This appendix gathers the necessary formulae to determine meson decay rates into HNLs, assuming a pseudoscalar meson (of mass mP and momentum p) in the initial state. In pure leptonic decays we define the meson decay constants through the transition matrix elements (see e.g. ref. [17]):\n\u30080|qi\u03b3\u00b5\u03b35qj |P (p)\u3009 = ifP p\u00b5 ,\n\u30080|qi\u03b35qj |P (p)\u3009 = i m2P\nmqi +mqj fP \u2261 ifSP , (A.1)\nwhere i, j denote quark flavor indices, and |P (p)\u3009 is the decaying pseudoscalar meson. In semileptonic meson decays, the hadronic matrix elements are described by the corresponding form factors. We distinguish two scenarios depending on the nature of the outgoing meson. If it is a pseudoscalar (of mass m and momentum p\u2032), the non-vanishing matrix elements are:\n\u3008P \u2032(p\u2032)|qi\u03b3\u00b5qj |P (p)\u3009 = f+(q2) [ (p+ p\u2032)\u00b5 \u2212 m 2 P \u2212m2 q2 q\u00b5 ] + f0(q2) m2P \u2212m2 q2 q\u00b5 ,\n\u3008P \u2032(p\u2032)|qiqj |P (p)\u3009 = fS(q2) ,\n\u3008P \u2032(p\u2032)|qi\u03c3\u00b5\u03bdqj |P (p)\u3009 = 2i mP +m [ p\u00b5p\u2032\u03bd \u2212 p\u03bdp\u2032\u00b5 ] fT (q2) , (A.2)\nwhere q\u00b5 \u2261 p\u00b5 \u2212 p\u2032\u00b5. Of the four form factors (f+, f0, fS and fT ), the scalar one can be related to the others using the equations of motion, through\nfS(q2) = m2P \u2212m2\nmqj \u2212mqi f0(q2) . (A.3)\nWhen the final meson is a vector (of mass m, outgoing momentum p\u2032 and polarization vector ), the non-zero matrix elements are:\n\u3008V (p\u2032, )|qi\u03b3\u00b5qj |P (p)\u3009 = ig(q2) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217\u03bdP\u03b1q\u03b2 , \u3008V (p\u2032, )|qi\u03b3\u00b5\u03b35qj |P (p)\u3009 = f(q2) \u2217\u00b5 + a+(q2)P\u00b5 \u2217 \u00b7 p+ a\u2212(q2)q\u00b5 \u2217 \u00b7 p ,\n\u3008V (p\u2032, )|qi\u03c3\u00b5\u03bdqj |P (p)\u3009 = \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ( g+(q2) \u2217\u03b1P\u03b2 + g\u2212(q2) \u2217\u03b1q\u03b2 + g0(q2)p\u03b1p\u2032\u03b2 \u2217 \u00b7 p ) ,\n\u3008V (p\u2032, )|qi\u03b35qj |P (p)\u3009 = fPS(q2) \u2217 \u00b7 p , (A.4)\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nwhere we defined P\u00b5 \u2261 p\u00b5 + p\u2032\u00b5. These transitions, denoted by P \u2192 V , are parametrized by eight functions of q2: g, f , a+, a\u2212, g+, g\u2212, g0 and fPS . Equations of motion relate the pseudoscalar form factor with the rest through the following expression:\nfPS(q2) = 1\nmqi +mqj\n[ f(q2) + a+(q2) ( m2P \u2212m2 ) + a\u2212(q2)q2 ] . (A.5)\nA.1 Two-body decays\nIn the rest frame of a particle of mass M , the two-body decay width reads\n\u0393 = \u03bb 1/2 (M2,m2a,m2b) 64\u03c02M3 \u222b d\u2126cm \u2211 spins |M|2 , (A.6)\nwhere \u03bb (x, y, z) \u2261 (x\u2212 y\u2212 z)2 \u2212 4yz, and ma, mb denote the masses of the decay products. Note that for identical particles in the final state one has \u222b d\u2126cm = 2\u03c0. In this section, we list the amplitudes and corresponding partial decay widths of a neutral pseudoscalar meson P \u223c qiqj decaying into (i) a pair of HNLs, and (ii) one HNL plus one active neutrino. For a Dirac HNL (and Dirac \u03bd), these decays occur via the LNC pair-NR operators in table 1 and the LNC single-NR operators in table 2. In the Majorana scenario (where the HNL and \u03bd are Majorana), the decays receive contributions from both the LNC and LNV operators. The amplitudes for Dirac neutrinos read\nM ( P \u2192 NN ) = ifP2 ( cV,RRqN, ij \u2212 c V,LR qN, ij ) uN/pPRvN \u2032 , (A.7)\nM ( P \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1N ) = if S P 2 ( cS,RRq\u03bdN, ij\u03b1 \u2212 c S,LR q\u03bdN, ij\u03b1 ) u\u03bdPRvN , (A.8)\nwhere uN (u\u03bd) and vN are the spinors corresponding to N (\u03bd) and N , respectively. A prime is added when there are two HNLs in the final state. For Majorana neutrinos, we recall that the full Majorana HNL field is N = N cR +NR, such that N c = N . The amplitude for P \u2192 NN has to be anti-symmetrized in N and N \u2032, since there are two identical particles in the final state.12\nM(P \u2192NN) = ifP2 ( cV,RRqN, ij\u2212c V,LR qN, ij ) uN/p\u03b35vN \u2032\n+ ifSP [( cS,RRqN, ij\u2212c S,LR qN, ij ) uNPRvN \u2032\u2212 ( cS,RR\u2217qN, ji \u2212c S,LR\u2217 qN, ji ) uNPLvN \u2032 ] , (A.9)\nM (P \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1N) = i fSP 2 [( cS,RRq\u03bdN, ij\u03b1\u2212c S,LR q\u03bdN, ij\u03b1 ) u\u03bdPRvN \u2212 ( cS,RR\u2217q\u03bdN,ji\u03b1\u2212c S,LR\u2217 q\u03bdN,ji\u03b1 ) u\u03bdPLvN ] + ifP2 [( cV,RRq\u03bdN, ij\u03b1\u2212c V,LR q\u03bdN, ij\u03b1 ) u\u03bd/pPRvN \u2212 ( cV,RR\u2217q\u03bdN,ji\u03b1\u2212c V,LR\u2217 q\u03bdN,ji\u03b1 ) u\u03bd/pPLvN ] .\n(A.10)\n12The convention for associating a u or v spinor to a Majorana particle is arbitrary. Our is such that there is one u spinor and one v spinor in each process. In this way, we recover the usual Dirac relations for the sums over spins.

(A.14)\nA.2 Three-body decays\nFor the three-body phase space integral calculations we follow the procedure described in ref. [17, appendix B.1]. However, we adopt general labels for the leptonic products. In the rest frame of the decaying pseudoscalar meson, the decay rate reads\n\u0393 = 12mP 1 (2\u03c0)5 \u222b d4p\u2032 \u222b d4pa \u222b d4pb \u03b4(p\u20322 \u2212m2)\u03b4(p2a \u2212m2a)\u03b4(p2b \u2212m2b)\n\u00d7 \u2211 spins |M|2 \u03b4(4)(p\u2212 p\u2032 \u2212 pa \u2212 pb) , (A.15)\nwhere p (p\u2032) is the momentum of the decaying (outgoing) meson and pa and pb denote the momenta of the produced leptons.13 The summed over spins squared matrix element can be written in terms of four-momentum invariant scalar products and the hadronic form factors,\n13The labels a and b will refer to (i) N \u2032 and N , and (ii) \u03bd and N .\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nwhich are functions of q2 = (p\u2212p\u2032)2. After performing the integral over the four-momentum pb, it is convenient to introduce the variable a via a factor of 1 = \u222b da \u03b4(a\u2212 q2). Then, the spin-summed matrix element squared can be written as\n\u2211 spins |M|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 pb=q\u2212pa = K\u2211 n=0 cn(a)(pa \u00b7 p)n , (A.16)\nwhere cn(a) are functions of a, particle masses and the hadronic form factors. For the decays under study we have K \u2264 2. After performing the remaining momentum integrals, one arrives at the final decay rate expression14\n\u0393 = 12mP 1 (2\u03c0)5 \u222b (mP\u2212m)2 (ma+mb)2 da IP K\u2211 n=0 cn(a)In , (A.17)\nwhere the integrals IP and In (for n = 0, 1, 2) are given by\nIP = \u03c0 2m2P \u03bb1/2\n( a,m2,m2P ) ,\nI0 = \u03c0 2a\u03bb 1/2 ( a,m2a,m 2 b ) , I1 = (pa \u00b7 q)(p \u00b7 q) a I0 , I2 = I0 a2 ( (pa \u00b7 q)2(p \u00b7 q)2 + 1 48\u03bb(a,m 2,m2P )\u03bb(a,m2a,m2b) ) . (A.18)\nThe scalar products above have to be replaced by\npa \u00b7 q = 1 2 ( a+m2a \u2212m2b ) , p \u00b7 q = 12 ( m2P + a\u2212m2 ) . (A.19)\nIn summary, after computing the spin-summed matrix element squared with standard techniques and arranging it in the form of eq. (A.16), one replaces (pa \u00b7 p)n by the corresponding integral result In, substitutes the form factor expressions (see section A.3), and evaluates the integral in eq. (A.17) numerically.

Finally, to simplify notation in the previous expressions, we have omitted the q2 dependence of the form factors.\nA.3 Decay constants and form factors\nThe masses of all mesons involved in the decays are taken from ref. [58]. In addition, we use the light quark masses at a renormalization scale of \u00b5 = 2GeV in MS, whereas for mc and mb we employ the MS masses at \u00b5 = mc and \u00b5 = mb, respectively, as in ref. [58]:\nmu = 2.2 MeV, md = 4.7 MeV, ms = 93 MeV, mc = 1.27 GeV, mb = 4.18 GeV.\nWe provide the decay constants of the heavy neutral pseudoscalar mesons in table 7. We use the isospin-averaged results15 for Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 dynamical quark flavors from ref. [75]. As regards hadronic form factors, several parametrizations exist in the literature for describing their dependence on q2. One of the most used is the BCL method [77], and we try to stick to it as long as there is available data. In all other cases, we use the so-called double-pole parametrization. In table 8, we show all hadronic transitions mediated by the selected NRLEFT operators and the references studying the associated form factors. We indicate the equation where the explicit q2 parametrization appears and the tables where the best-fit parameter values are given.16\nB Branching ratios of meson decays triggered by single-NR operators\nWe have also computed the branching ratios for two- and three-body pseudoscalar meson decays including in the final state a SM neutrino and an HNL. These decays are triggered\n15In other words, we assume the isospin symmetry, i.e. the (approximate) symmetry between the u and d quarks. In this limit, the decay constants for D0 and D+ are the same, fD. Similarly, B0 and B+ mesons are characterised by one constant, fB . The difference |fP + \u2212 fP | is estimated to be ' 0.5MeV for both P = D and P = B [75, 76].\n16Notice that there are several conventions in the literature for writing hadronic matrix elements in terms of form factors. The basis presented in eqs. (A.2) and (A.4) must be converted to the new basis in each reference before using their q2 parametrization.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nMeson transitions Form factor parametrization Fitted parameters\nD-mesons\nD0 \u2192 \u03c00 BCL [78, eqs.

Relevant meson transitions for the decays studied in section 3. The two last columns show the references to the form factor parametrizations and the best-fit parameter values. Isospin symmetry is assumed so that identical form factors are taken for P 0 \u2192 M0 and P+ \u2192 M+ transitions, where M can be a pseudoscalar or vector meson.\nby the single-NR operators given in table 2. As an example, we show in figure 8 the corresponding branching ratios in the case of b\u2192 d transitions triggered by three single-NR operators, namely, OS,RRd\u03bdN,31\u03b1, O T,RR d\u03bdN,31\u03b1, and O V,RR d\u03bdN,31\u03b1. The scalar and tensor operators are LNC, whereas the operator of the vector type is LNV. As can be seen from eq. (A.14), the tensor operator does not contribute to the two-body decay width. This is why there is no solid blue line in the corresponding plot in figure 8. The tensor form factors for the B \u2192 \u03c0 transitions have been taken from table 50 in ref. [75]. For B0 \u2192 \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 and B0s \u2192 K0, we have used eq. (27) from ref. [80], which relates fT to f+ and f0. Finally, for the B(s) \u2192 V transitions, we have used the results of ref. [81]. In table 8 we include these references and the ones for all other form factors. We note that the branching ratios in figure 8 are very similar to those for the meson decays induced by the single-NR operators with a charged lepton, which have been studied in detail in ref. [17], cf. figure 2 therein. Thus, the constraints on the neutral current single-NR operators from the far detectors are expected to be very similar to those derived in ref. [17] for the charged current single-NR operators. For this reason, we do not study the neutral current single-NR operators in more detail.\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nFigure 8. Branching ratios of B-meson decays triggered by the single-NR operators OS,RRd\u03bdN,31\u03b1, OT,RRd\u03bdN,31\u03b1 and O V,RR\nd\u03bdN,32\u03b1. In each case, the corresponding Wilson coefficient has been set to 10\u22123v\u22122.\nC HNL two-body decays via single-NR operators\nSingle-NR operators contribute to both HNL production and decay. In fact, depending on the Wilson coefficient and the value of active-heavy mixing, they can even dominate the HNL decay width. The LNC and LNV operators in table 2 make HNLs undergo two- and three-body semileptonic decays. The dominant channels are two-body decays, mediated by just one insertion of an effective operator, with one light neutral meson and one active neutrino in the final state. If the HNL mass is large enough, then multimeson final states could also be important in the computation of the total decay width. We do not compute this contribution, though. The single-NR operators with light quarks can mediate the two-body decay processes mentioned above at tree level. The contribution from operators with heavy quarks, which control B- and D-meson decays into HNLs, is loop-suppressed, and we do not compute it. The interference between active-heavy mixing and single-NR operators is also not treated here. In this appendix, we list the HNL partial decay rates into a neutral meson and a SM neutrino mediated by the effective operators containing two light quarks. We leave, however, the flavor indices of the Wilson coefficients unspecified. We consider the scenarios where\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nboth N and \u03bd are either Dirac or Majorana particles. In each case, we distinguish between a pseudoscalar and a vector meson in the final state.
