    "abstractText": "Optimizing a modulator driver for linear and high-speed operation, while simultaneously achieving a high output voltage swing is very challenging. This paper investigates the design of a highlylinear, high-bandwidth yet power-efficient Mach-Zehnder modulator driver based on the breakdown voltage doubler concept, which overcomes the transistors\u2019 physical limitations and enables output voltage swings twice as high as conventional differential pair amplifiers can provide. The low-power design was enabled by the use of an open-collector topology for the output stage as well as by employing resistors instead of current mirrors in order to provide the bias currents for the emitter-follower (EF) stages. We show that by means of this EF implementation approach, the power consumption can be reduced by 19% without sacrificing the circuit\u2019s bandwidth and linearity. The driver achieves peak-to-peak differential output voltage swings above 6.5 Vpp,d and consumes 670 mW of DC power, being one of the most power-efficient drivers in the literature. The 3-dB bandwidth is 61.2 GHz and the total harmonic distortion is 1%, measured at 1 GHz and for the output swing of 6.5 Vpp,d. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, these are the highest linearity and output voltage swing reported in the literature for modulator drivers with bandwidths above 40 GHz.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the following years, a significant increase in the world data traffic is expected, hence there is a high motivation in increasing the volume of data that can be transmitted by the telecommunication networks. To this end, coherent transmission techniques have been developed in order to enhance the data transmitting capability of the communication systems [1]. In an optical coherent detection system, both the amplitude and the phase of the signal can be modulated, thus enabling quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats such as 16-QAM or 64-QAM. By this means, the number of bits that can be transmitted within one symbol of data is significantly increased. However, such modulation formats impose high requirements in terms of linearity for the electrical drivers.\nIn electro-optical communication systems, modulators are used to convert electrical data into optical data, in order to transmit it via optical fibers. One such type of modulator is the Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), where the light is initially divided into two paths and subsequently recombined. The applied voltage to each path generates a phase shift, depending on which, the two light signals are recombined either constructively or destructively, resulting in a high intensity (logical \"1\") or low intensity (logical \"0\") signal level, respectively. The extinction ratio (ER) of the modulator represents the ratio between the optical power of the high and low intensity signal, respectively, and is a particularly important metric for long-range communications. The ER reaches its maximum value when a phase shift of 180\u25e6 is induced between the two arms of the MZM. The voltage\nVOLUME -, 20xx 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The electro-optical modulation efficiency is the product between the voltage swing required to achieve a 180\u25e6 phase shift and the length of the phase shifters [2]. This product is constant. Thus, for attaining high ERs, either a high swing modulator driver or long phase shifters are required. However, long phase shifters suffer from a series of drawbacks. First, the layout size of the electro-optical transmitter is increased, thus making the integration in a communication system difficult, especially when the system consists of several parallel channels. Second, long transmission lines (TL) connecting the driver with the modulator\u2019s electrodes have high resistive losses, thus lowering the voltage swing applied to the phase shifters and reducing the ER. Finally, for long MZMs, in addition to having higher optical losses, the mismatch between the propagation delays in the TLs and in the optical fibers of the phase shifters is increased, hence reducing the vertical opening of the MZM\u2019s output eye diagram. It is therefore desirable to have a high-voltage-swing driver, so that shortlength phase shifters can be used without sacrificing the ER of the modulator.\nThe design of a high-swing driver is however challenging, since the maximum output swing of a transistor pair is limited by the transistor\u2019s collector-emitter breakdown voltage (BVCE), which is technology-dependent [3]. In order to overcome this physical limitation, special driver topologies need to be employed. One such topology is the breakdown voltage doubler architecture [3], since it equally distributes the output voltage swing between two cascaded transistors, thus doubling the maximum achievable output swing.\nSeveral high-swing, linear modulator driver designs have been proposed in the literature. A high peak-to-peak differential output voltage swing of 6 Vpp,d was achieved in [4] by employing a breakdown voltage doubler topology. However, it has a low bandwidth (40 GHz), a high power consumption (1 W) and only an average linearity, with a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 3.6% measured at 1 GHz. High bandwidths of 90 GHz and 86.8 GHz were achieved in [5] (using a distributed amplifier architecture) and [6] (using a cascode topology), respectively. Nevertheless, both designs show a low linearity, with a THD of 5% each (at 1 GHz and 10 GHz, respectively) as well as moderate output voltage swings (4 Vpp,d and 4.9 Vpp,d, respectively). The designs presented in [7] (distributed amplifier topology) and [8] (series-stacked differential emitter-follower and MOS-HBT cascode topology) have a good linearity (THD is 2% and 2.5% at 4 GHz and 10 GHz, respectively), however they have only average output voltage swings (5 Vpp,d and 4.8 Vpp,d, respectively) and a high power consumption (1.1 W and 0.82 W, respectively).\nIn this research paper, we study the concept of a highswing modulator driver that simultaneously targets an improved linearity with respect to the state of the art, a bandwidth above 60 GHz and a high power efficiency. To this end, a breakdown voltage doubler architecture was investigated,\nsince it allows both a high output voltage swing and a linear operation. By using an open-collector topology for the output stage of the driver, we can save the extra power that would have been dissipated in the collector resistors of the output transistors. Furthermore, by providing the bias currents of the emitter followers by means of resistors instead of current sources, we show that the power consumption can be decreased by 19%, without impairing the bandwidth or the linearity of the circuit. With a maximum output voltage swing of 7.2 Vpp,d, a bandwidth of 61.2 GHz, a THD of 1% (at 1 GHz, for 6.5 Vpp,d output swing) and a power consumption of 670 mW, the driver reached all the research targets mentioned above. To prove the concept, the circuit was implemented in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology with an fT/fmax of 350/450 GHz.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section II, the circuit design is investigated. Section III shows the experimental measurement results and a comparison with other works in the literature. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper."

In order to reach such a high swing, a simple cascode circuit would not suffice, as it was demonstrated in [3]. Therefore, a breakdown voltage doubler architecture was studied, as shown in Fig. 1. The purpose of such an architecture is to have the output voltage swing equally distributed between the two cascaded transistors T1 and T2, thus avoiding that their BVCE is exceeded. To this end, a common emitter circuit (transistor T4 and load resistor RT) is employed at the input of the upper transistor T1 [3]. By this means, T1\u2019s base is driven by the common-emitter circuit, whose input is connected to the driver\u2019s input Vin. Therefore, the two output transistors T1 and T2 are driven in a synchronized manner, thus dividing the output voltage swing between them.\n2 VOLUME -, 20xx\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

For example, changing the supply voltage VCC will shift one VCE up and the other one down, whereas tuning the resistor RT will increase one VCE and decrease the other one. Fig. 2 (a)\u2013(d) summarizes the influence of different circuit parameters that were used to align the two collector-emitter voltages during the design process.\nThe DC bias of the circuit (Fig. 1) as well as the value of resistor RT were carefully chosen so that VCE,1 = VCE,2. For the purpose of having a linear operation, an emitter degeneration resistor RE,2 was employed. A more detailed description of the linearization of the driver is presented in Section II-B.\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 1, the output stage of the driver was designed as an open-collector. When connected to an optical modulator, the load is represented by the impedance of the TLs connecting the driver with the modulator\u2019s electrodes, as well as by the TLs\u2019 termination resistors. Such an implementation approach for the output stage may cause an increase of the reflections at high frequencies between the driver and the TLs due to reduced output matching. Nevertheless, the choice of an open-collector topology was motivated by several considerations. When using collector resistors for the output transistors of the driver, the total impedance seen by the driver\u2019s output stage would be nearly halved, since the TLs\u2019 termination resistors and the collector resistors of the driver\u2019s output stage would be connected in parallel. Therefore, in order to ensure the same output voltage swing as for an open-collector configuration, a nearly two times higher tail current ICC,2 would be required. A twice as high ICC,2 would not only increase the power consumption considerably, but it would also lead to a reduction of the bandwidth as a side-effect, since larger transistors with higher parasitic\n0 50 100 150 200 Time (ps)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nV C\nE (\nV )\nV CE,1 (too low C T ) V CE,2 (too low C T ) V CE,1 (matched) V CE,2 (matched)\n0 50 100 150 200 Time (ps)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nV C\nE (\nV )\nV CE,1 (too high C T ) V CE,2 (too high C T ) V CE,1 (matched) V CE,2 (matched)\n(a) (b)\nFIGURE 3.

In addition to this, the larger transistors in the output stage would need to be driven by larger transistors in the preceding stages, which in turn would require larger bias currents and increase the power consumption.\nHaving two cascaded output transistors T1 and T2 coupled to the input means that there are two distinct paths from the input to the output of the circuit. The first path goes from Vin to the base of T4, then from T4\u2019s collector to T1\u2019s base, and finally to T1\u2019s collector (Vout). The second path goes from Vin to the base of T3, then from T3\u2019s emitter to T2\u2019s base, then from T2\u2019s collector up to T1\u2019s emitter, and finally to T1\u2019s collector. The two paths have different time delays which must be matched in order to have an output signal with low rise and fall times and without distortions. As the first path (via T4) is faster than the second one [3], a compensation capacitor CT was placed in parallel with resistor RT in order to match the delays in the two paths. Furthermore, capacitor CT impacts the distribution of the output voltage swing between transistors T1 and T2. Fig. 3 (a) and (b) illustrate this effect for a too low and a too high CT, respectively."

As it will be shown, this approach offers a higher bandwidth and linearity for the same power consumption compared to the current-source approach. The two EF implementation approaches are illustrated in Fig. 5, where CL represents the capacitive load of the EF.\nFirst, we investigate the dimensioning of resistors R6 and R3, since they provide the bias currents for the EF stages T6/T6\u2019 and T3/T3\u2019 that drive the transistor pairs T4/T4\u2019 and\nVOLUME -, 20xx 3\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the dependency of the driver\u2019s bandwidth and THD (at 1 GHz), respectively, on resistors R6 and R3. The resistors are normalized to the small-signal transconductances gm,T4 and gm,T2 of transistors T4 and T2, respectively. For R6 = 20/gm,T4 and R3 = 40/gm,T2, the bias currents of transistors T6/T6\u2019 and T3/T3\u2019 correspond to 120% of the current required in order to reach the maximum transit frequency of the transistors (IfT,max). As it can be seen in Fig. 6, the bandwidth is enhanced by 8% and the THD is decreased by 24% compared to the case where the same bias currents amount to 80% of IfT,max (i.e. for R6 = 40/gm,T4 and R3 = 80/gm,T2). Nevertheless, for the case with higher bias currents, the overall power consumption of the circuit is increased by 33% in comparison to the case where the\nsame currents amount to 80% of IfT,max. As a compromise between bandwidth, linearity and power consumption, the values R6 = 32/gm,T4 and R3 = 62/gm,T2 were chosen.\nWith the selected values of R6 and R3 and the corresponding EF bias currents, a comparison study was done in terms of driver bandwidth and linearity for the cases where the bias currents of the EFs T6/T6\u2019 and T3/T3\u2019 are provided either by means of resistors or by current sources (i.e. the resistor or the current-source approach for the EF implementation, respectively). For the current-source approach, carefully dimensioned current mirrors were employed in order to provide the same bias currents to the EFs as for the resistor approach. As it can be seen in Fig. 7 (a), the simulated driver bandwidth in the case of the current-source approach is 7% lower compared to the resistor approach. The explanation for this is that the current mirrors introduce more parasitic elements into the circuit than the resistors for the given technology and currents. In particular, the parasitic capacitance of the current mirrors\u2019 output transistors plays an important role, since it introduces additional poles in the EF\u2019s transfer function, which limit the bandwidth. Simulations showed that EFs with purely ideal current sources (without any parasitic capacitance) do not affect the driver\u2019s bandwidth.\n4 VOLUME -, 20xx\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

For output voltage swings of the driver above 4.2 Vpp,d, the THD for the current-source approach is higher compared to the resistor approach. Thus, at 7.2 Vpp,d output swing, the driver with EFs implemented by means of current sources shows a 15% higher THD than for the resistor-approach case. This increase of the harmonic distortions is not due to a direct decrease of the linearity in the main signal path (i.e. the amplification path T3-T2, as described in Section II-A). Instead, the current-source approach influences the linearity in an indirect manner, by impacting the synchronization between the two signal paths T3-T2 and T4-T1. Thus, the parasitic capacitance of the current mirrors negatively affects the synchronization between the paths, which results in a higher THD at the circuit\u2019s output. Investigations showed that a three-times higher capacitance CT (which is used for synchronizing the two paths, as described in Section II-A) would partially compensate this loss in linearity. Nevertheless, such a high CT would cause severe peaking in the amplitude frequency response, which would in turn cause significant ringing in the eye diagram and possible stability issues.\nThe loss in performance in terms of bandwidth and linearity for the current-source approach can be partially compensated by increasing the EF bias currents provided by the current mirrors by 50%, as shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). Nevertheless, this would result in an increase of 24% of the overall power consumption of the circuit with respect to the resistor-approach case."

A higher resistance means a higher linearity and thus a lower THD, however it considerably reduces the gain. Fig. 8 (a) illustrates the trade-off between linearity and gain. The THD was simulated at 1 GHz and corresponds to a differential output voltage swing of 7.2 Vpp,d. RE,2 is normalized to 1/gm,T2, where gm,T2 is the small-signal transconductance of transistor T2. For a high linearity of the circuit, the product gm,T2RE,2 must be much greater than 1 [10]. Targeting a THD below 1% and without neglecting the DC gain, the value RE,2 = 5.5/gm,T2 was selected. The gain was chosen so that the driver provides the full swing of 7.2 Vpp,d when 1.3 Vpp,d (650 mVpp single-ended) is applied at the input."

            "text": "In order to study and confirm the driver\u2019s functionality under different conditions, additional post-layout investigations have been performed. Fig. 9 shows the simulated single-ended eye diagrams of the proposed driver for nonreturn to zero (NRZ) and 4-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4), respectively. The input voltage had an amplitude of 650 mVpp. In simulations, the driver achieved a symbol rate of at least 72 Gbaud for NRZ and 45 Gbaud for PAM-4 modulation, respectively (the latter corresponding to 90 Gb/s), while yielding an output voltage swing of 3.6 Vpp (singleended).\nNext, the THD at higher fundamental frequencies was investigated. To this end, 2-GHz and 5-GHz input sine waves were provided at the circuit\u2019s input and the results were compared with the analysis at 1 GHz. Fig. 10 shows the postlayout simulated THD depending on the differential output voltage swing of the driver for input sine waves of 1 GHz, 2 GHz and 5 GHz. As it can be seen, the driver\u2019s linearity slightly improves with the increase of the input signal\u2019s fundamental frequency for output voltage swings up to 5.7 Vpp,d. This is mainly caused by the mutual reduction of the higherorder harmonics due to their phase difference close to 180\u00b0 in the two signal paths of the breakdown voltage doubler topology (i.e. T4-T1 and T3-T2). For output voltage swings above 5.7 Vpp,d, the THD at 5 GHz increases with respect to the ones at 1 GHz and 2 GHz. This is explained by the increase of the non-linearity coefficients of various parasitic elements inside the transistors with increasing frequency, e.g. the base resistance or the base-collector capacitance [11].\nVOLUME -, 20xx 5\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

By doing so, we investigate the impact of temperature (T) as well as of variations in the fabrication process on the circuit performance. The driver was simulated under four operating conditions depending on process and temperature variations, namely a best case scenario at low temperature (0\u25e6C), a typical case both at room temperature (27\u25e6C) and high temperature (75\u25e6C), and finally a worst case scenario at very high temperature (105\u25e6C). The simulation results for bandwidth, THD (at 1 GHz, for 7.2 Vpp,d output swing) and DC gain are displayed in Table 1. As it can be seen, neither the operation under typical conditions at 75\u25e6C nor the worst case scenario at 105\u25e6C impair significantly the performance: the bandwidth does not drop below 60 GHz, while the THD only slightly exceeds 1%. This shows that the driver, in particular the proposed approach for realizing the EF stages by means of resistors, ensures a high performance even in the case of severe process variations or high ambient temperatures.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS In order to study the functionality of the driver and to prove the design concepts presented in the previous section, the circuit was fabricated and subsequently measured in the laboratory. The photograph of the chip is shown in Fig. 11. For the measurements, the DC pads of the circuit were bonded to a printed circuit board (PCB), while the input and output RF pads were probed by means of 67-GHz GSGSG-type probes (where \"G\" denotes the ground and \"S\" the signal paths).\nThe chip has a size of 1 \u00d7 0.8 mm2.

The driver\u2019s output common mode level was provided by means of the network analyzer\u2019s integrated bias tees, and the load was represented by the 50-\u2126 impedance of the measurement device. The measured differential Sdd21 and Sdd11 are shown in Fig. 12. The driver has a small-signal differential gain of 15.5 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 61.2 GHz. The circuit shows a very good input matching to 50 \u2126, as the differential Sdd11 stays below -12 dB for the whole measured frequency range.\n6 VOLUME -, 20xx\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Considering the middle group delay value of 16 ps, the group delay variation is limited to \u00b1 5 ps for the entire measured frequency range.\nThe higher peaking of the measured Sdd21 parameter and the reduced bandwidth compared to the simulation results, as well as the higher group delay variation are mainly caused by a higher-than-estimated parasitic inductance of the connections between the transistors T1/T1\u2019 and T2/T2\u2019 of the output stage on the one hand and the preceding stage on the other hand. However, as it will be shown in Section III-C, the higher peaking and group delay variation do not cause significant ringing or timing errors, respectively, in the eye diagrams.\nB. LINEARITY MEASUREMENT In order to evaluate the linearity of the driver, the THD was measured by means of a 67-GHz Rohde&Schwarz FSU-67 spectrum analyzer. The input signal was a sine wave with a frequency of 1 GHz provided by a low-distortion signal generator (Rohde&Schwarz SMA100B). The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 14. Since the input and the output of\nthe spectrum analyzer and the signal generator, respectively, are single-ended and the driver is fully differential, baluns had to be employed at the driver\u2019s input and output in order to convert the single-ended signal into differential one and vice versa. The driver\u2019s output common mode voltage was provided by means of external bias tees.\nThe measurement results are shown in Fig. 15. The driver shows a very high linearity up to the output voltage swing of 6.5 Vpp,d, the THD staying below 1%. At 7 Vpp,d the THD increases to 1.7%, which still indicates a high linearity of the circuit.\nOne of the causes for the higher values of the measured THD compared to the simulation is the process variation of the circuit\u2019s components, in particular of the emitter degeneration resistors RE,2, since these resistors have a direct impact on the linearity. As Table 1 shows, the THD can noticeably degrade for given operating conditions and process variations."

The bit sequences were provided by a 64-Gb/s SHF 12105A bit pattern generator (BPG). One output of the circuit was attenuated by 20 dB and fed into a sampling oscilloscope (Tektronix DSA8300) in order to measure the eye diagrams. The other output was connected to a 50-\u2126 termination. The output common mode voltage was provided by means of external bias tees. Since the BPG\u2019s maximum data rate is limited to 64 Gb/s, a multiplexer (120-Gb/s SHF C603A) was used in order to measure eye diagrams at higher data rates.

COMPARISON WITH THE STATE OF THE ART\nTable 2 summarizes the performances of different highswing, linear modulator drivers reported in the literature. The design presented in [4] uses a breakdown voltage doubler topology as well. Despite its higher gain, when compared to the driver proposed in this paper, it reaches a 17% lower output voltage swing, a 35% lower bandwidth, a lower linearity and consumes 49% more DC power. The design presented in [5] uses a distributed amplifier topology and has a 47% higher bandwidth and a 18% lower power consumption than the proposed driver, however it has a 44% lower output voltage swing and a much lower linearity. The design in [6] (cascode topology) reaches a 42% higher bandwidth, but its linearity is much lower, its DC power consumption is 79% higher and it has a 32% lower output swing. The driver presented in [7] (distributed amplifier topology) is superior in terms\nof bandwidth (14% higher) and gain, however it is inferior in terms of output swing (31% lower), linearity and power consumption (64% higher). The driver shown in [8] (seriesstacked differential EF and MOS-HBT cascode topology) has a comparable bandwidth (though 6% lower), however it has a 22% higher power consumption, a 33% lower output swing as well as a lower linearity.\nWith a measured THD of 1% at 1 GHz for 6.5 Vpp,d output swing and 1.7% for 7 Vpp,d, the design proposed in this paper achieves, to the best knowledge of the authors, the highest linearity and output voltage swing among linear modulator drivers reported in the literature with bandwidths above 40 GHz. Although the driver attains a lower gain compared to the designs presented in [4], [7] and [8], it reaches a higher linearity at higher output voltage swings, thus meeting one of the main design challenges for linear, high-swing modulator drivers. Moreover, when relating the consumed DC power to the output voltage swing (PDC/Vout ratio), the proposed driver shows the highest power efficiency among the designs presented in Table 2."
