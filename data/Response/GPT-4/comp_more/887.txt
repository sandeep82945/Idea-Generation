Investigating Decoding Strategies for Enhanced Human-Likeness: Given the paper's finding that most popular decoding algorithms have a similar, limited effect on a generator's ability to reproduce human variability, a future research direction could involve developing and testing new decoding strategies specifically aimed at enhancing the human-likeness of generated text. This research could explore how different strategies affect the representation of uncertainty and variability across various NLG tasks, aiming to more closely mimic human production variability.

Cross-Linguistic and Cultural Analysis of Production Variability: The study primarily focuses on English and, in the case of translation, German. Future research could extend this analysis to other languages and cultural contexts, examining how production variability and models' representation of uncertainty differ across languages. This could involve creating multi-reference datasets for underrepresented languages and analyzing the impact of linguistic and cultural factors on production variability and model performance.

Fine-Grained Analysis of Model Uncertainty Across Communicative Goals: Building on the paper's approach, future studies could conduct a fine-grained analysis of how well NLG models capture the variability associated with specific communicative goals (e.g., persuasion, information sharing, questioning). This could involve creating datasets with annotated communicative goals and evaluating models' ability to generate appropriately varied responses for each goal.

Development of Models with Dynamic Uncertainty Calibration: Inspired by the observation that NLG models overestimate variability in open-ended tasks and underestimate it in more constrained tasks, research could focus on developing dynamic models that adjust their representation of uncertainty based on the task or context. Such models would use indicators of task constraints or context complexity to modulate their output variability, aiming for closer alignment with human production variability.

Exploring the Role of Context and Background Knowledge in Production Variability: The paper hints at the influence of situational context on production variability, especially in storytelling tasks. Future research could explore how incorporating context and background knowledge into NLG models affects their representation of uncertainty and ability to produce varied outputs. This could include experiments with models that dynamically incorporate external knowledge bases or context-specific data to better mimic the variability seen in human-generated text.
