A standard treatment method involves inserting a passive drainage catheter, known as an external ventricular drain (EVD), into the ventricle. EVDs have common adverse complications, including the occlusion of the catheter, that may lead to permanent neural damage or even mortality. In order to prevent such complications, a novel dual-lumen catheter (IRRAflow ) utilizing an active fluid exchange mechanism has been recently developed. However, the fluid dynamics of the exchange system have not been investigated. In this study, convective flow in a three-dimensional cerebral lateral ventricle with an inserted catheter is evaluated using an in-house lattice-Boltzmannbased fluid\u2013solid interaction solver. Different treatment conditions are simulated, including injection temperature and patient position. Thermal and gravitational effects on medication distribution are studied using a dye simulator based on a recently-introduced (pseudo)spectral convection\u2013 diffusion equation solver. The effects of injection temperature and patient position on catheter performance are presented and discussed in terms of hematoma irrigation, vortical structures, mixing, and medication volume distribution. Results suggest that cold-temperature injections can increase catheter efficacy in terms of dye distribution and irrigation potential, both of which can be further guided by patient positioning.

INTRODUCTION The majority of hemorrhagic strokes happen due to intracerebral (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH). These hemorrhages cause 13% of strokes in the United States, accounting for more than 100,000 patients per year. A common complication of ICH and SAH is intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), where the hemorrhage leaks into the cerebral ventricles. Although IVH can vary in severity from occupying mild layers of blood to full ventricles, any presence of IVH resulting from other intracranial hemorrhages can be attributed to poor clinical outcomes. Patients with ICH/SAH + IVH components (two simultaneous hemorrhages) have more than a 50% 30-day mortality rate, and half of these deaths occur in the first 48 h. High mortality rates have been related to the blood volume in the cerebral ventricle and the presence of hydrocephalus. Even though these hemorrhages occur commonly, there is still controversy as to the appropriate method of treatment. Arguably, the most common and beneficial treatment involves draining the blood and cerebrospinal fluid mixture (hematoma) continuously with a passive external ventricular drain (EVD) in order to regulate the edema and hydrocephalus. While EVD placement may improve the outcome, it may lead to catheter-related complications. Even when the best EVD insertion and management guidelines are followed, patients still experience side effects due to the occlusion of the catheter. Frequently reported complications include secondary intracranial hemorrhage Address correspondence to Niema M.

However, this procedure lacks a well-defined clinical protocol and must be performed at the physician\u2019s discretion.19\nIn order to take advantage of irrigation while maintaining sterility, a novel dual-lumen self-irrigating catheter system has been recently developed (IRRAflow , IRRAS, Stockholm, Sweden). This dual-lumen catheter is connected to an intelligent digital cassette (feedback mechanism for peristaltic pumping) and powered by a control unit with a user interface. The catheter is designed to prevent the issues observed with conventional EVD usage by delivering periodic irrigation with drainage and continuous pressure monitoring (so-called active fluid exchange). Several clinical studies have illustrated the ability of this dual-lumen catheter system to deliver tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA; a clot breaking agent) in a continuous manner while enabling quicker evacuation of blood in the ventricles while negating catheter occlusions25,41 (increasing EVD efficiency and decreasing complications52).\nAlthough case studies with this catheter system (IRRAflow ) have documented the effectiveness of such self-irrigating catheters in shortening hospitalization times with no catheter-related complications,25\u201328,36,37,41 the underlying physics of the active fluid exchange mechanism and drug delivery is not yet fully understood. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating the fluid dynamics of any type of EVD catheters nor their drug delivery mechanisms. Using a computational fluid dynamics approach (see Methodology section for the governing equations and numerical methods), this study investigates the fluid exchange system within the lateral cerebral ventricle at different fluid injection temperature and patient body position. The results of this study might provide insights into treatment procedures of active-irrigation catheters and, further, may contribute to improved patient care by elucidating optimized drug delivery patterns."

The tip is inserted 18 mm into the ventricular domain in order to ensure all ports are completely inside the ventricle.\nWe have employed the standard duty cycle of IRRAFlow in all simulations: 20 s with three distinct time intervals corresponding to injection (1 s), observation (9 s), and drainage (10 s).

The onsets of these velocities are regularized-in-time by partition-of-unitybased functions to obtain appropriately smooth and physically-relevant simulations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no prescribed injection temperature for this procedure, although it should be within a realistic range so as to avoid neural injury.7,44 The brain cells can tolerate low temperatures \u00f0 5 C\u00de for several weeks.44 However, they start to develop ischemia at temperatures that are slightly elevated above normal body temperature \u00f0 40 C\u00de:7 Therefore, injections can only be performed at temperatures colder than the normal body temperature \u00f0<37 C\u00de.

Simulations are performed for three injection temperatures and two different patient positions: supine (lying on the back with the face upwards) and prone (lying on the stomach with the face downwards). Other body positions are not considered since they have been demonstrated to be clinically impractical.34 The injection procedures are performed at cold (5 C), room (20 C), and body (37 C) temperatures, where the lattermost represents the \u2018\u2018baseline\u2019\u2019 performance of the catheter (which is independent of patient posture since buoyancy force is zero via Eq. (5), see Supplementary Information).\nSimulated snapshots, at various times, of the velocity and vorticity fields inside the ventricle are\npresented in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Table 1 additionally presents the flow die-out time (corresponding to the time at which maximum velocity drops below 0.5 mm/s) for the three injection temperatures and two patient positions. As a metric for quantifying the threedimensional fluid blending due to the injection (Eq. 20), Fig. 5 presents the average vorticity for each configuration.\nEvery velocity magnitude image in Fig. 3 displays two overlaid cross-sections (opaque and transparent) intersecting at the radial centerline of the catheter, where the first row corresponds to the 37 C case. With no (expected) thermal effect at this baseline, the velocity vectors are damped out and disappear at the end of injection (t 1:3 s). When a temperature difference is introduced (second through fifth rows), one can observe significant changes in the velocity field compared to the baseline for both prone and supine positions. For the former injected at non-body tem-\nBIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY\nperatures, we observe a non-negligible fluid velocity in the occipital horn (see Fig. 1a) of the ventricle and hence persistent clot irrigation until a die-out time of 8.8\u20139.4 s (Table 1). A non-negligible velocity can be observed at the prone position, tending instead to-\nwards the anterior horn (see Fig. 1a) and lasting (actively irrigating) for roughly a third of the time, i.e., 3.3\u20133.5 s. For both cold (5 C) and room (20 C) temperatures, the velocity distributions (Fig. 3) as well as the die-out times (Table 1) are comparable. However, velocity magnitudes at 5 C reach values twice as large as those from injecting at 20 C. Videos corresponding to the time evolution of all cases in Fig. 3 are provided in Supplementary Information.\nSnapshots of the time evolution of the vortex structures corresponding to each configuration is presented in Fig. 4. The vortices have been visualized using the Q-criterion method with iso-surfaces at Q \u00bc 0:1 s 1: The injected fluid introduces vortices in all cases. At baseline, these vortices separate from the catheter after the end of injection, disappearing quickly due to the smaller die-out time. When thermal effects are introduced, the vortices bend in directions based on patient position. At supine, we observe some vortices\naNote that for injections at body temperature (37 C), the solution is independent of patient posture (supine/prone) since buoyancy force is zero via Eq.

Similarly, prone, we observe vortex cores traveling towards the anterior horn. However, these structures remain intact (i.e., no pinch-off), and thus their sizes are larger than those at supine. Injection at temperatures colder than baseline results in stronger vortices (in terms of magnitude) occupying larger regions.\nFigure 5 provides a quantitative assessment of the fluid blending caused by the injected fluid via the spaceaveraged vorticity for each configuration. We observe that vorticity curves produced by all injections are similar at their onset. However, midway through each injection, the subsequent evolution of the average vorticity begins to differ drastically as a function of temperature. We note that the coldest injection results in up to twice as much blending than at room temperature. Following the end of injection (at t 2 s and t 4 s for prone and supine, respectively), the differences between the cold and room temperature cases start to diminish, and the average vorticity becomes similar for both positions well before the onset of drainage. Although such thermal effects on vorticity disappear before drainage (t \u00bc 10 s), we observe that postural effects continue to persist until the end of the complete catheter cycle (t \u00bc 20 s)."

In order to investigate the\ndistribution of the injected dye, these velocity vectors are then employed in the FC-based advection\u2013diffusion solver.\nFigure 6 presents, for each configuration, the resulting simulated dye (e.g., medication) distributions at five instances, including at the end of injection (t \u00bc 1:0 s), the start of drainage (t \u00bc 10:0 s) and the end of the operating cycle (t \u00bc 20:0 s).\nTable 2 presents the corresponding \u2018\u2018injected fluid utilization rate\u2019\u2019 calculated as the ratio of final remaining dye volume to the original injected volume. For injection at baseline (first row), we observe that the dye diffuses only within the near vicinity of the catheter, and a large portion of the medication (35:5%) is drained back by the catheter without having been utilized (i.e., not having reached other parts of the ventricle). For other cases, we observe significant effects on the delivery patterns due to thermal and postural conditions. These buoyant effects (Eq. 5) enable medication to be delivered to a larger volume than at baseline. At supine position, for example, dye travels towards the occipital horn of the ventricle and, at prone, towards the anterior horn. Since the catheter is inserted into the latter, a larger amount of dye is drained back at prone than at supine. Additionally, injection at the coldest temperature results in higher concentrations near the ventricle walls when compared with room temperature. Subsequently, a smaller volume of dye is drained during the drainage of the catheter, and the medication utilization is higher (more remains post-drainage).\nFigure 7 presents the percentage of total volume occupied at the end of the catheter duty cycle at different threshold values c0 of dye concentrations (cf.

Thermal effects appear to increase both this diffusion as well as the effective dye volume. However, we note that patient position appears to have a greater effect than injection temperature. The supine position results in more volume covered with optimal concentrations than at prone. Consistent with Fig. 6, delivery appears limited to a small region at prone, and 5% of the ventricle has more than 50% concentration. At supine, however, medication diffuses through a much larger volume and the maximum final concentration in the ventricle is less than 30%: Additionally, injection at 5 C increases the effective dye volume slightly when compared to 20 C (by 3.3 and 1.4% for supine and prone, respectively)."

            "text": "This work studies the thermal and postural effects on irrigation patterns and injected fluid mixing of a newly-developed self-irrigating catheter to utilize an active fluid exchange mechanism for treating intraventricular hemorrhages. Through robust numerical simulations, we have investigated clot irrigation potential (via consideration of velocity fields) and drug delivery performance (via consideration of vortex structures and dye evolution) under different injection temperatures and patient positions.\nOverall, we observe that injection at baseline (T \u00bc T1 \u00bc 37 C) yields the least favorable outcome for treatment. Fluid flow and subsequent dye/medication diffusion remains restricted to regions near the original injection sites (first row of Figs. 3 and 4). Al-\nthough this is to be expected from the lack of corresponding buoyancy effects (force density is zero in Eq. 5), such limited movement implies poor clot irrigation and an ineffective distribution of injected dye/ medication (which does not reach much of the ventricle). Additionally, more of the injected dye is drained (Table 2), and what little remains is generally at concentrations outside of the optimally-effective range (Fig. 7). This implies that much of any injected medication would go underutilized.8\nOn the other hand, buoyant effects at temperatures T<37 C clearly provide significant enhancements. A comparison of velocity fields in Fig. 3 demonstrates a drastic change in irrigation patterns at both 5 C and 20 C, regardless of patient position. Indeed, the fluid preserves significant energy and momentum up to seven times longer than at baseline (Table 1), and vortex structures occupy larger volumes of the ventricle (Figs. 4 and 5). Vorticities also persist beyond the dieout time due to the velocity thresholds employed. Overall, this implies that injection at any temperature colder than body will yield a larger volume of undrained medication (Table 2) spread over a larger region for a longer duration, ultimately improving the treatment potential of such a procedure.\nAs can be further observed in Figs. 4, 5 and 7, such thermal effects strengthen as temperature decreases: 5 C yields even larger dye volumes and more persistent irrigation patterns than 20 C. Indeed, Eq. (5) implies that the larger the temperature difference (from baseline), the larger the expected buoyancy forces. At 5 C, the dye snapshots of Fig. 6 demonstrate diffusion and dissipation that result in more clinically-favorable8 (between 2:5% and 12:3%) concentration levels. With such optimum concentrations covering larger portions of the ventricle, less of an injected medication remains underutilized.\nDifferent patient positions also yield very different irrigation patterns and fluid mixing (except at baseline, cf. Eq. 5). In clinical applications, targeting the occipital horn (a more complex geometry than the anterior horn) might be preferred since it is a common location of persistent IVH post-treatment clots.36,41 To this end, our results clearly suggest positioning the patient face-up (supine) instead of face-down (prone) for better irrigation (Figs. 3 and 4) and drug delivery (Fig. 6). Indeed, the significantly higher overall die-out time (Table 1), remaining dye volume (Table 2), and amount of optimum dye concentration (Table 3) implies more efficient drug utilization and longer hematoma irrigation at supine for both 5 C and 20 C.\nWe note here that we have used a healthy, generalized, anatomically-realistic brain ventricle; a more\naNote that for injections at body temperature (37 C), the solution is independent of patient posture (supine/prone) since buoyancy force is zero via Eq. (5) and hence only supine position has been provided.\nBIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SOCIETY\naccurate model might contain patient-specific characteristics including ventricle size and alignment as well as irregularly-shaped features. We have also fixed the catheter location and orientation in order to fully isolate and study thermal/postural effects. Although there may also be some differences in insertion angle and orientation in clinical practice, our catheter model is based on current manufacturer recommendations. Future work entails investigating the effects of different lateral ventricle morphologies and catheter placement (can be provided by post-operation tomography images). Additionally, we have not considered chemical reaction between injected tPA solution and hematomas in our simulations. Our results only elucidate the path of diffusion and not the actual activated interaction between tPA and hematomas (where, with a finite reaction rate, medication can be consumed during clot breaking). The addition of such a reaction term to the governing model (Eq. 15) is a subject of our future work.\nSome additional limitations should be mentioned. To the best of our knowledge, the properties of an intraventricular hematoma (e.g., transport and thermal) are not well established and there is a dearth of literature. As such, multi-phase fluid models are not feasible. Hence, we have employed a single-phase model by assuming the hematoma is a uniform mixture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid, where medication immediately mixes with the hematoma at the injection port. Further research into the properties of a hematoma may one day enable consideration of fluid\u2013fluid interactions; however, conclusions drawn from our study would still be reasonably accurate since increased thermal forces (lower injection temperatures) enhance irrigation and drug distribution in any case.\nOverall, this work demonstrates that both temperature and patient position are important factors in catheter efficacy. Results suggest that treatment administered at a high temperature difference (e.g., 5 C) increases efficiency and that irrigation can be directed as necessary via patient positioning. Our unique modeling approach may help facilitate rapid assessment of drug delivery performance before treatment. Indeed, the first two days are most critical for IVH patients, and this work has been motivated by the overarching goal of faithfully producing treatmentspecific simulations towards enabling a priori catheter performance estimation within a few hours."
