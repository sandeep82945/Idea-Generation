1. **Investigate the bioavailability and antioxidant properties of the cis-isomers of lutein.** 
The paper mentions that only a few studies have examined the bioavailability and antioxidant properties of cis-isomers of lutein, and that more research is needed in this area. This could be a promising avenue for future research, as it could help to determine the potential health benefits of these isomers and inform their use in dietary supplements and functional foods.


2. **Explore the role of lutein isomers in plant physiology and stress response.** 
The paper briefly mentions that lutein and its isomers may play a role in plant physiology and stress response, but this area has not been extensively studied. Future research could investigate the specific roles of these isomers in various physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, and defense against environmental stresses. This knowledge could contribute to a better understanding of plant biology and resilience.


3. **Investigate the occurrence and distribution of lutein isomers in different plant species and tissues.** 
The paper focuses on the analysis of lutein isomers in flowers, but it would be interesting to examine their occurrence and distribution in other plant tissues, such as leaves, fruits, and roots. This could provide insights into the biosynthesis, transport, and accumulation of these isomers within plants, and help identify potential sources of lutein-rich plant materials for various applications.


4. **Study the effects of environmental factors on the production of lutein isomers in plants.** 
The paper does not discuss the influence of environmental factors on the production of lutein isomers in plants. Future research could investigate how factors such as light intensity, temperature, water availability, and nutrient status affect the accumulation of these isomers in different plant species. This knowledge could be valuable for optimizing cultivation practices and maximizing the production of lutein isomers in crops and ornamental plants.


5. **Develop analytical methods for the separation and quantification of lutein isomers.** 
The paper mentions the use of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-DAD-MS for the analysis of lutein isomers, but there is a need for more sensitive and selective analytical methods to accurately separate and quantify these isomers in complex biological samples. Future research could focus on developing improved analytical techniques, such as LC-MS/MS methods with high-resolution mass spectrometry, to facilitate the identification and quantification of lutein isomers in various matrices.
