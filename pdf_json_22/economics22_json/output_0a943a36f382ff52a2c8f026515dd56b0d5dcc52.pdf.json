Introduction\nThe City of Bandung started implementing the Large-Scale Social Restriction Policy (PSBB)\non June 22, 2020, and continues to do so today (09/07/2020). The PSBB strategy was adopted when Bandung reached the red zone for COVID-19 distribution. To date (09/10/2020), confirmed cases in West Java Province totaled 845, with Bandung reporting the most significant number of cases with 642 instances(You, 2020).\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is also being felt in the construction industry. According to the\nIndonesian Contractors Association (AKI), the construction sector witnessed a slowdown during the COVID-19 epidemic and required a quick response. The effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on the implementation of construction services Naturally, one of the consequences is a funding reduction for the execution of PUPR Ministry initiatives. The PUPR Ministry's budget was slashed by IDR 44.5 trillion, out of a total of IDR 120 trillion, to deal with COVID-19. Thus, the Ministry of PUPR's residual DIPA is presently about IDR. 75 trillion. This research was conducted in one construction company in Indonesia, the company was facing several problems, and many projects that already ended had delays.\nImplementing the Policy on Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) in numerous locations\ndesignated as red zones has had a cascading impact on all spheres of life.\u00a0Projects are delayed in the construction industry, and the delivery of building supplies and materials, labor and labor cutbacks, work hours reductions, and even temporary work stoppages for projects in the red zone. Multiple nations' lockdown rules have also harmed the supply chain for building supplies and equipment(Liu, 2020)(Pamidimukkala, 2021). Certain building materials and equipment continue to be imported (many of them from China), which means that limits on business operations (including exports and imports) and modes of transportation will affect the disruption of the material supply chain. All of which will add to the cost of building. Physical separation, which prevents COVID-19, also influences large-scale project work (labor-intensive)(Alsharef, 2021).\u00a0 With the various consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic and a dilemma for the domestic\nconstruction sector, Minister of PUPR Basuki Hadimuljono stated that during the COVID-19 Pandemic, construction services continued to operate by the Instruction of the Minister of PUPR No. 2/2020 published on March 27, 2020. The pros and cons of the community against the health protocol rules that are applied have caused some regulations to be relaxed a little. Additionally, since no one can foresee when this epidemic will stop, the only thing that can be done now is to adapt to COVID19. This forces the building industry to continue adapting to multiple changes throughout and after the epidemic. The purpose of this research is to ascertain the primary elements affecting the effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on construction projects, as well as to provide a plan for conducting construction projects during the Pandemic. Pandemics and post-pandemic situations(Chu, 2020). Non-physical adaptation includes changes in time, patterns and methods of learning, behavior, psychology, and the internet network, as well as changes in the internet network itself.\n2. Literature Review\nA project is a work plan that includes precise objectives (irrigation, energy production, etc.)\nand a specified completion date. (Zamani, 2021) define a project as a collection of transitory actions with a beginning and an end that use various limited and specific resources to accomplish the defined goals and objectives. (King, 2021) advanced a similar view, stating that a project is a collection of resources such as people, materials, equipment, and capital and costs gathered in a temporary organizational container to accomplish goals and objectives. According to (King, 2021), to realize the wants and needs of each party involved in a project through a collaborative effort to accomplish goals and objectives, it is necessary to identify organizations or individuals (stakeholders) both internal and external to the project who will exert influence over the project. Moreover, it must be considered throughout the project. According to (Kumar, 2021), the project has three characteristics:\na) Construction projects are unusual in that they never repeat the same sequence of operations (there are no similar projects, just comparable ones). They are transient and always include diverse groups of people. b) Each construction project needs labor and equipment (money, machines, methods, materials). The project manager is responsible for organizing all of these resources. c ) Each business requires an organization, and each organization has a variety of objectives that need a diverse group of employees with a range of abilities, interests, personalities, and doubts. According to Chasanah (2018), the construction sector plays the following roles in the global economy: a) The construction sector contributes to the world's per capita income, which accounts for around 10% of the global GDP. b) The construction industry can absorb a sizable workforce, around 7% of the global workforce. c) The construction industry absorbs around two-fifths of total energy absorption globally, making it the most critical sector in terms of energy absorption. The Pandemic's influence may be separated into three phases: preparation, implementation, and operation. At the same time, the Construction Implementation Phase has the most significant influence (55%)(Alhusban, 2021)."

When planning for 2020 began, the total Bandung City Public Works project run was approximately 416 packages of planning, construction, and maintenance\nprojects(Kaihuang, 2020). However, the projects have run at approximately half their capacity or approximately 202 packages since the Pandemic. This is due to the budget being diverted for the pandemic response. Moreover, until this data is collected, just 10% of all packages have been running; the remainder will begin running in mid-October (source: interview results). While private ventures are also experiencing difficulties, some have been abandoned entirely.It is a mass arrangement of buildings based on the idea of a platform that avoids direct contact with the earth.\nThe variable in this research is the effect of the Covid-19 epidemic on the project's execution in\nBandung. According to the findings of the literature review and interviews, several elements contributed to the effect of the Covid-19 epidemic, namely:\n1. Problems with the distribution of project materials and materials (C1) 2. Slow Mobilization of heavy equipment and construction equipment (C2) 3. The difficulty of importing materials and materials from outside the region (C3) 4. There is a reduction in the workforce (C4) 5. There is a change in working hours (C5) 6. Trimming working hours (C6) 7. There is a change in work shifts (C7) 8. Elimination of overtime for workers (C8) 9. Difficulty in transportation for workers and builders to the project site (C9) 10. It is not easy to bring in specialist workers from outside the region (C10) 11. Decreased worker productivity (C11) 12. There is a worker's strike (C12) 13. The late withdrawal of terms or installments (C13) 14. There is uncertainty about the continuity of the project (C14) 15. The project was abandoned due to PSBB (C15) 16. There is an economic crisis (C16) 17. Increased project budget (C17) 18. There is a change in the Contract (C18)\nRespondents in this survey were construction enterprises engaged in 2020 Bandung projects. Before data\ncollection, the city of Bandung had 30 active projects in 2020. Respondents are individuals or\nconstruction firms involved in the project(Hasan, 2021). The sampling approach utilized was accidental\nsampling, which is not a probability sampling technique.\nRespondents received online questionnaires through a Google form link and offline by hand delivery\nat the project site. The surveys were gathered from 25 respondents from various Bandung-based initiatives.\nC19 0.397 0.723 0.397 Valid and reliable C20 0.397 0.755 0.397 Valid and reliable C21 0.397 0.597 0.397 Valid and reliable C22 0.397 0.424 0.397 Valid and reliable C23 0.397 0.663 0.397 Valid and reliable C24 0.397 0.505 0.397 Valid and reliable\nC25 0.397 0.765 0.397 Valid and reliable Source: Personal, 2020\nWith the assistance of SPSS 25, the results of the validity and reliability tests revealed that all\nreliable variables had a value of r alpha = 0.936, but three invalid variables remained, namely X2, X9, and X11. These three variables must be omitted from future investigations.\nThese variables are then evaluated using Principal Component Analysis to derive six main\ncomponents that represent factors or components affecting the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on the realization of construction projects in Bandung City(AlKheder, 2021). Six significant components were produced based on the findings of the principal component analysis performed using the SPSS software (Table 3). The first eigenvalues provide information about the number of components generated(Matveeva, 2021). The initial Eigenvalues of each variable reflect their relevance in computing the variance of the total variables studied. \"Component indicates the number of components or variables. The number of generated components is indicated by initial eigenvalues equal to or higher (1). The grouping of these variables can be seen in table 2.\nSource: Personal, 2020 A building project implementation plan may then be developed based on the findings of the component analysis above, both during and after the epidemic. Literature study and adoption of the strategy included in the Minister of PUPR 2/2020 order.\nConclusion According to the findings of this research, the following conclusions may be drawn:\n1. In the wake of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the following issues have an impact on construction projects: financial constraints, regional restriction factors (PSBB), labor constraints, material and equipment constraints, project uncertainty constraints, and strike constraints. 2. 2. Construction projects may be carried out in a variety of methods during and after a pandemic, each one customized to the main components that are created. There are many alternative solutions for the first primary component, including the following: 3) Effective and efficient management of the project's financial\nflow; 2) Managing the project's budget and schedule with the use of the value analysis approach (earn value method); 3) preparing for the possibility of an unexpected budget."
