    "abstractText": "This work investigated the improvement of amylopectin addition on the quality of myofibrillar proteins (MP) gel damaged by high doses of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, 80 \u03bcM/g protein). The results found that the addition of amylopectin partially alleviated the unfolding of MP induced by oxidation and EGCG, and enhanced the structural stability of MP. Amylopectin blocked the loss of the free amine group and thiol group, and increased the solubility of MP from 7.0% to 9.5%. The carbonyl analysis demonstrated that amylopectin addition did not weaken the antioxidative capacity of EGCG. It was worth noting that amylopectin significantly improved the gel properties of MP treated with a high dose of EGCG. The cooking loss was reduced from 51.2% to 35.5%, and the gel strength was reduced from 0.41 N to 0.29 N after adding high concentrations of amylopectin (A:E(8:1)). This was due to that amylopectin filled the network of MP gel after absorbing water and changed into a swelling state, and partially reduced interactions between EGCG and oxidized MP. This study indicated that amylopectin could be used to increase the polyphenol loads to provide a more lasting antioxidant effect for meat products and improve the deterioration of gel quality caused by oxidation and high doses of EGCG.",

            "text": "Meat and meat products are indispensable in the human diet, and their main nutritional value is to provide high-quality protein for humans. Myofibrillar proteins (MP), the most important functional protein in muscle protein, account for 50\u201360% of the total muscle protein and about 12% of skeletal muscle weight [1]. MP comprise an excellent gelling agent that is mainly responsible for the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) gel network of meat products during the heating process and have a decisive effect on the quality of final products [2]. Generally, MP are vulnerable to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of food processing and transportation, resulting in changes in the secondary and tertiary structure [3]. Therefore, the functional properties of MP will undergo irreversible changes due to polymerization and aggregation caused by oxidation, leading to poor meat product quality [4\u20137]. Consequently, it is of great significance to control protein oxidation in meat products.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12091790 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 2 of 15\nAmong all kinds of antioxidant methods, the use of antioxidants to prolong shelf life is the most effective and extensive way. Compared with synthetic antioxidants, natural antioxidants from plants have attracted much attention due to their safety and nontoxicity [8]. Generally speaking, natural antioxidants require higher doses to achieve the same effect as synthetic antioxidants, effectively protecting food proteins from oxidative attacks [9]. However, studies have found that high doses of polyphenols can interact with the protein excessively, resulting in negative changes in the physical and chemical characteristics and conformation of the protein, ultimately jeopardizing the quality of meat products [1,5,8,10,11]. Currently, there are two main mechanisms by which polyphenols modify proteins, one of which is to covalently modify proteins via thiol-quinone and amino-quinone Michael addition reactions or induce cross-linking of disulfide bonds between proteins under oxidative conditions. The thiol-quinone and amino-quinone Michael addition reactions between MP and EGCG (1000 ppm) induced a severe cooking loss and a collapsed internal structure of MP gel [5]. Gallic acid or chlorogenic acid (150 \u00b5M/g) promoted the loss of amine and thiol groups, leading to the reduced gelling ability of MP [12,13]. The thiol-quinone addition reactions between MP and excessive tea polyphenols (20 \u00b5M/g or more) were detrimental to MP, occasioning the loss of thiol groups, and deterioration of the strength and texture of MP gel [14]. Moreover, polyphenols could modify proteins non-covalently through hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions, of which hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding are the most important. Non-covalent interactions between MP and rutin (200 \u00b5M/g) induced deterioration of the strength and water-holding capacity (WHC) of MP gel [15]. When there was no oxidation treatment, hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between high doses of EGCG (0.12%) and MP caused excessive protein cross-linking and had a negative impact on gel properties [16]. According to the aforementioned, interactions between polyphenols and MP are common in meat products. In particular, high doses of polyphenols caused unanticipated worsening of MP gels, as they altered the characteristics of MP [5,8,12,13,17,18]. Therefore, when polyphenols are used to replace synthetic antioxidants, how to reduce the adverse effects of high doses of polyphenols on the quality of MP gel has become an unavoidable problem in the field of meat processing. However, related studies have been rarely reported. Studies showed that EGCG-induced protein aggregation could be inhibited by glycosylation of bovine serum albumin and casein through the Maillard reaction [10,19]. However, the glycosylation reaction rate was slow under dry heat conditions, and it was difficult to control the degree of glycosylation, resulting in excessive protein denaturation, browning and the formation of anti-nutritional compounds [20]. Therefore, when polyphenols are used to substitute for synthetic antioxidants, and new theories and methods are needed to effectively control the interaction between polyphenols and proteins so as to improve the functional characteristics of proteins. Starch is the main component of the human diet, which plays an important role in human health. It is also one of the commonly used excipients in meat products. Amylopectin is an important part of starch. In food starch, the content of amylopectin is high, generally 65\u201381%, which has excellent thickening, adhesion, and water-holding properties [21,22]. Waxy starch is rich in amylopectin, easy to extract, and low cost. Compared with ordinary corn starch, it has higher dilatability, transparency, viscosity, and paste stability, so it is widely used in the food industry [23]. However, corn amylopectin was selected in this study for the following reasons: (1) Waxy starch also contains amylose, and the strong interaction between amylopectin and amylose chains will affect its binding capacity with water and thermal properties [24]. (2) Waxy corn starch paste is unstable under acidic or alkaline conditions [25], and the pH value of meat products is 5.6~6.8, which limits its application in meat products. (3) Waxy starch has different molecular weights, while amylopectin has uniform and larger molecular weights. (4) Waxy starch has a sticky taste and is not acceptable to consumers. Polyphenols have polyhydroxy and carbonyl structures, so they\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 3 of 15\ncould interact with amylopectin molecules through hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, etc. As a result, this study aimed to improve the gel properties of MP under high doses of EGCG and oxidation conditions using amylopectin. The gel strength and cooking loss of MP gels were analyzed to understand the improvement effect of amylopectin on the quality of MP gels treated with high doses of EGCG under oxidative stress. The physical and chemical properties, conformational changes, rheological properties, and gel microstructure of MP were determined to explain the mechanism."

After the oxidation treatment, the cooking loss significantly increased to 40.3 \u00b1 0.7% (p < 0.05). Similar findings were observed by Cao et al. (2016) and Zhou et al. (2014) [2,12]. Li et al.

These data are consistent with the cooking loss of MP gels (Figure 1A). In the absence of high doses of EGCG, amylopectin reduced the gel strength enhanced by oxidation to some extent (Figure 1B). This indicated that amylopectin could also improve the gel properties damaged by oxidation.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 7 of 15\nFrom the results of cooking loss and gel strength, we suggested that amylopectin might improve the gel properties of MP by preventing protein-EGCG interactions and filling the MP gel after absorbing water and changing it to a swelling state. Zhuang et al. (2020) studied the effect of acetylated cassava starch on the gel properties of MP and came to the same conclusion [31].\n3.2. Chemical Properties of the MP 3.2.1. Carbonyl Content\nCarbonyls were used to evaluate the degree of protein oxidation. Figure 2A showed the carbonyl content of all samples. The carbonyl content of oxidized MP was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The incorporation of high doses of EGCG significantly lowered the carbonyl content of MP under oxidative stress (p < 0.05). This result indicated that the incorporation of EGCG inhibited the formation of protein carbonyl. The carbonyl content of oxidized MP treated with EGCG did not change significantly in the presence of amylopectin compared with MP treated with EGCG alone (p > 0.05). This indicated that amylopectin addition did not weaken the antioxidative capability of EGCG, which still had the ability to scavenge free radicals effectively. Moreover, the incorporation of amylopectin significantly reduced the carbonyl content of MP under oxidative stress (p < 0.05), which suggested that amylopectin protected MP from oxidative attack.\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 15 and excessive cross-linking induced by 80 \u00b5M/g EGCG and oxidization.

Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05).\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 8 of 15\n3.2.2. Free Amino and Thiol Group\nThe \u2212NH2 groups on the side chain of MP can be translated to carbonyl groups under oxidative stress [27]. Moreover, the reaction between carbonyls and usable \u2212NH2 groups can result in a further lowering of the free amine content [32]. The thiol groups of MP are easily attacked by \u2022OH and then transformed into intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds [18]. Figure 2B,C show the changes in free amino and thiol groups of MP, respectively. Compared with non-oxidized MP, the free amino and thiol content of the MP samples were significantly lost when MP were attacked by \u2022OH (p < 0.05). EGCG addition did not prevent the loss of free amino and thiol groups. As a matter of fact, EGCG had the disposition to accelerate \u2212NH2 and \u2212SH oxidation and resulted in the further loss of free amino and thiol group of MP. When attacked by \u2022OH, EGCG was translated to electrophilic quinone derivatives, and could modify \u2212NH2 and \u2212SH to form aminoquinone and thiol-quinone adducts, thereby facilitating the loss of \u2212NH2 and \u2212SH [7]. Notably, the free amino and thiol group content of MP treated with amylopectin and EGCG were higher than those treated with EGCG alone under oxidative stress. This suggested that amylopectin partially prevented the loss of free amino and thiol groups. These results indicated that the addition of amylopectin weakened the interactions between EGCG and oxidized MP to a certain extent.\n3.2.3. Solubility\nAs shown in Figure 2D, the solubility of the oxidized group was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05). High doses of EGCG further lowered the solubility of the MP, suggesting that the interactions between oxidized MP and EGCG led to the further aggregation of MP. The addition of amylopectin increased the solubility of the oxidized MP in the presence of EGCG, which indicated that amylopectin played a certain role in hindering the modification of MP by EGCG [33]. Noticeably, amylopectin addition also raised the solubility of oxidized MP without EGCG treatment. The result showed that amylopectin might combine with MP and sterically impede the aggregation induced by oxidation and EGCG [1].\n3.3. Secondary and Tertiary Structure of the MP 3.3.1. Tryptophan Fluorescence\nThe intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence was used for monitoring the tertiary structure of the protein. Figure 3A showed the fluorescence spectra of all samples. The control group exhibited a maximum fluorescence intensity. Proteins usually appeared with a high fluorescence intensity when Trp residues were buried inside the natural protein [17]. The fluorescence intensity of oxidized MP was significantly reduced compared with the natural MP (p < 0.05). This was because Trp and Tyr residues were exposed to the polar environment when MP were attacked by \u2022OH. The study by Zhu et al. (2019) also illustrated that \u2022OH caused a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of squid MP [34]. The change of the protein conformation caused by oxidation was thought to be the main factor leading to the loss of Tyr fluorescence [24]. The fluorescence intensity of MP treated with high doses of EGCG alone under oxidative stress was the lowest among all samples. This suggested that EGCG interacted with MP and the polarity of the micro-environment around the Trp residue was altered, resulting in a further decrease in fluorescence intensity [35]. The addition of amylopectin increased the fluorescence intensity of MP in the presence or absence of EGCG under oxidative stress, suggesting that amylopectin reduced the oxidative damage of MP and the interactions between MP and EGCG. This could be ascribed to that amylopectin combined with MP and sterically impeded the damage induced by \u2022OH and EGCG on the structures of MP.\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 9 of 15 Foods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 15\nFigure 3.

Surface Hydrophobicity The surface hydrophobicity was often used to indicate the degree of protein un-\nfolding and has a great effect on the quality of meat products. As shown in Figure 3B, the surface hydrophobicity of MP was significantly increased when exposed to \u2022OH (p < 0.05), indicating an increase in the degree of unfolding. The hydrophobic amino acids were exposed on the surface under oxidative stress, increasing the binding to the probe ANS. The incorporation of EGCG did not obstruct the change of conformation. On the contrary, EGCG further lowered the surface hydrophobicity of oxidized MP, even below the level of the control group (Figure 3B). These results were consistent with the finding of Feng et al. [5]. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that oxidization and high doses of EGCG resulted in hydrophobic aggregation owing to the excessive unfolding of proteins. Therefore, the hydrophobic area of MP was partially shielded. In addition, the combination of hydrophilic EGCG to MP also led to a decrease in the surface hydrophobicity of MP [5,36]. With the addition of amylopectin, the aggregation of MP induced by oxidation and high doses of EGCG was partially prevented, thus slightly increasing the surface hydrophobicity. Amylopectin addition reduced the surface hydrophobicity of MP under oxidative stress. These results indicated that amylopectin addition protected MP from the modifications by oxidation and EGCG, and alleviated the damage to the structures of MP (Figure 3B).\n3.3.3.

Amylopectin addition re uced the surface hydrophobicity of MP under oxi ative stress. These results indicated that amylopectin addition protected MP from the modifications by oxidation and EGCG, and alleviated the damage to the structures of MP (Figure 3B).\nFoods 2023, 12, 1790 10 of 15\n3.3.3. CD Spectrum\nThe secondary structure of MP was measured using a far ultraviolet CD spectrum (190\u2013250 nm). The two negative peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm represented \u03b1-helical structures, which was not surprising because of the super-coiled \u03b1-helical structure at the tail of myosin. As shown in Figure 3C, these two negative peaks of MP were significantly suppressed after oxidation treatment (p < 0.05), indicating the unfolding of MP, which might disrupt the hydrogen bonding of \u03b1-helix and promote the transformation of \u03b1-helix to other secondary structures. This is coincident with other research [17,37]. The amount of \u03b1-helical structures was further decreased with EGCG treatment under oxidative stress (Figure 3C). The \u03b1-helical structure is mainly maintained by the hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen of amino groups (NH\u2013) and the oxygen of carbonyl groups (C=O) within the polypeptide chain. When EGCG was oxidized to quinone, it might disturb the hydrogen bonds of MP due to the formation of amino-quinone and thiol-quinone adducts, therefore resulting in changes in the secondary structure. The excessive unfolding of MP caused by oxidization and high dose of EGCG was unfavorable for gel properties, which was coincident with the gel properties. High concentrations of amylopectin (A:E = 4:1, 8:1) increased the \u03b1-helix content of oxidized MP treated with EGCG. Furthermore, the \u03b1-helix content of oxidized MP treated with amylopectin was higher than that of oxidized MP. These results indicated that amylopectin could partially hinder the over-unfolding of MP induced by EGCG and oxidation."

In the presence of 80 \u00b5M/g EGCG, amylopectin addition decreased the G\u2032 of MP gels under oxidative stress.

The tan \u03b4 values of all samples in Figure 5B were less than 1, indicating that all MP showed elastic behavior. In general, the better the gel matrix, the lower the final tan \u03b4 value. Amylopectin lowered the final tan \u03b4 values of MP in the presence of EGCG, suggesting amylopectin improved the gelation properties of MP treated with EGCG under oxidative stress.\n3.7. Microstructure of the MP Gels The SEM images of different MP gels were shown in Figure 6. The pure MP gel (Control) exhibited an intact, continuous, homogeneous, and porous network structure. After oxidation treatment, the micro-structure became rough, heterogeneous, and with larger irregular pores, indicating that the oxidation was detrimental to forming a homogeneous gel network. This might be ascribed to that the MP degradation and peptide chain breakage caused by oxidative modification [2] destroyed the cross-linking of the oxidized MP, and hence reduced the gel capability of oxidized MP (Figures 1 and 5). However, 80 \u00b5M/g EGCG addition exacerbated the disruption of the micro-structure of gels, leading to irregular, discontinuous protein aggregates and lump structures rather than a homogeneous and porous 3D network structure. The micro-structure was buttressed by the cooking loss and gel strength (Figure 1A,B). In the presence of EGCG, the protein aggregates disappeared and the gel network structure was gradually restored with the increase of amylopectin concentration, especially under the condition of A:E (8:1). In addition, the gels of oxidized MP treated with amylopectin alone showed a continuous and compact structure, gradually approaching that of the control. These results suggested that amylopectin protected MP from oxidative attack and ameliorated the adverse effects of high doses of EGCG.\nThe oxidation treatment had no obvious effect on the G\u2032 of the gels compared with the control group (Figure 5A), which was in agreement with the results of gel strength (Figu e 1B). The final G\u2032 of the MP gel ith EGCG addition as the highest amon all samples. EGCG addition might cause a tight structure instead of a homogeneous and porous gel structure, which was in accordance with the results of previous studies [5,39]. In the presence of 80 \u00b5M/g EGCG, amylopectin addition decreased the G\u2032 of MP gels under oxidative stress. On one hand, amylopectin might hinder the excessive interactions between oxidized MP induced by EGCG, thus leading to a reduction in G\u2032. On the other hand, amylopectin swelled after bsorbing water and filled the MP gel to improve the gel properties. In the absence of 80 \u00b5M/g EGCG, amylopecti addition significantly increased the final G\u2032. The final G\u2032 value of the samples was not exactly in agreement with gel strength. This could be explained by that the gel strength was the result of the combined effect of shear forces, compressive and tensile, while the G\u2032 was only representative of the shear stress [12]. The tan \u03b4 values of all samples in Figure 5B were less than 1, indicating that all MP showed elastic behavior. In general, the better the gel matrix, the lower the final tan \u03b4 value. Amylopectin lowered the final tan \u03b4 valu s of MP in the presence of EGCG, suggesting amylopectin improved the gelati n properties of MP treated with EGCG under oxidative stress."

Conclusions High doses of EGCG altered the physiochemical and structural characteristics of MP and then jeopardized the gel properties of MP. EGCG aggravated the unfolding and destruction of MP secondary and tertiary structures under oxidative stress conditions, resulting in the loss of sulfhydryl and amino groups and MP aggregation. The solubility was reduced. MP formed a crumpled and collapsed network structure after heat induction, and so the cooking loss and gel strength were significantly increased. The addition of amylopectin (especially A:E(8:1)) weakened the excessive unfolding of MP structure caused by oxidation and EGCG, increased the content of sulfhydryl and free amino groups, and improved the solubility. A gel network structure with reduced bulk aggregates was formed after heating. Therefore the cooking loss and gel strength were reduced significantly. The mechanisms by which amylopectin improved the gel properties of MP included: The amylopectin was expansive due to water absorption, and it can improve the gel performance after filling into the gel network; In addition, the addition of amylopectin partially weakened the interaction between EGCG and oxidized MP, thus inhibiting MP aggregation. This study would provide a potential way to enhance the load of polyphenols when polyphenols were used as natural antioxidants in meat products, therefore averting their adverse impact on the functional characteristics of MP.\nAuthor Contributions: L.C.: data curation, investigation, methodology, funding acquisition, project administration, resources, writing\u2014original draft.
