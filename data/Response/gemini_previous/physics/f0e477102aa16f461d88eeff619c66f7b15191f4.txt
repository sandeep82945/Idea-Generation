1. **Investigate the biosynthesis of pterocarpans in Cucurbitaceae:** Pterocarpans are typically associated with legumes (Fabaceae), but this study detected them in cucumber for the first time. Further research is needed to confirm their biosynthesis in plants other than legumes and explore the potential of cucumber and other Cucurbitaceae as sources of pterocarpans.


2. **Study the biological activities of acylated flavonoids and lignans in Lagenaria siceraria:** Bottle gourd was found to be rich in acylated flavonoids and lignans, which are known to possess various bioactivities. Future studies should investigate the specific biological activities of these compounds, such as their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, to better understand their potential health benefits.


3. **Explore the potential of Lagenaria siceraria as a source of saponins:** Saponins are a diverse group of compounds with various biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and hypocholesterolemic effects. This study detected saponins in cucumber, but they were more abundant in bottle gourd. Further research is needed to characterize and evaluate the bioactivities of saponins from bottle gourd to assess their potential for use in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.


4. **Investigate the aroma profile of Lagenaria siceraria in different cultivars and growing conditions:** This study provided a preliminary analysis of the aroma profile of bottle gourd, but further research is needed to explore the variation in aroma compounds across different cultivars and growing conditions. This information could be valuable for optimizing cultivation practices and selecting cultivars with desirable aroma characteristics.


5. **Conduct comprehensive metabolomics studies on Cucurbitaceae species:** This study focused on the metabolome profiling of cucumber and bottle gourd, but there are many other Cucurbitaceae species with potential nutritional and medicinal value. Future research should conduct comprehensive metabolomics studies on a wider range of Cucurbitaceae species to identify novel bioactive compounds and explore their potential health benefits.
