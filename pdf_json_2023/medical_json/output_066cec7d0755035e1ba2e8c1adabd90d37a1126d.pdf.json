We implemented a study in 2 field hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 treatment in Da Nang, Vietnam (July\u2013August 2020), and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (August\u2013October 2021), to identify pathogens, risk factors, and outcomes associated with HAIs. Methods: We applied a prospective study tool to estimate HAI incidence among 1,454 patients.HAIs arediagnosedandascertainedusing surveillancecriteria establishedby theUSCenters forDiseaseControl andPrevention.All patientshospitalized for COVID-19 for at least 2 days were enrolled in this assessment of HAI risks,pathogens, andoutcomes.Results:Among1,454sampledpatients, 391patientshad423HAIs (27.1%).Thehighest proportionoccurred in ICUs, with422HAIpatients (34.1%).Pneumonia (n=331,78.3%)andbloodstream infections (n = 55, 13.1%)were themost commonHAIs.Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumonia (27.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (25.3%), were the most commonly isolated organisms. Ventilators and central venous catheters were independently associated with HAIs. Regarding themortality rates, 55% of deaths occurred in intensive care units. Patients with HAIs (70.3%) were twice as likely to die compared to patients without HAIs (38.8%). HAIs leading to septic shock caused almost triple mortality (n = 58, 90.6%) compared with non-HAI patients (n = 412, 38.8%). HAIs prolonged hospital stay: 24.7 days for patients with HAIs and 19.1 days for patients without HAIs (P < .001). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19\u2013related critical illnesses are at high risk ofHAIs frommultidrugresistant (MDR) bacteria. HAIs prolong hospitalization, whereas HAIs with septic shock almost tripled mortality. Guidelines and procedures to prevent and controlHAIs causedbyMDRbacteria aswell as training andmonitoring on aseptic-compliant techniques during invasive clinical procedures are",

Previous studies have shown that a care bundle is effective in reducing CLABSI rates; however, the data on longterm sustainability and cost savings of bundled care are limited. Methods: From January 2011 toDecember 2020, a prospective surveillance was performed to monitor CLABSI at a university hospital in northern Taiwan. To reduce the CLABSI rate, a hospital-wide bundled care program for CLABSI prevention was implemented in 2013. We evaluated the longterm effect of the care bundle on CLABSI incidence and length of stay in the ICU. Results: During the study period, the overall CLABSI incidence decreased from 8.22 per 1,000 catheter days before the care bundle was implemented to 6.33 per 1,000 catheter days in 2020 (P for trend <.01). The most common pathogens causing CLABSI were gut organisms (1,420 of 2,363, 60.1%), followed by environmental organisms (734 of 2,363, 31.1%) and skin organisms (177 of 2,363, 7.5%). The decreasing trend was statistically significant in the incidence of CLABSI caused by skin organisms (P for trend< .01), but not in the incidence of CLABSI caused by environmental organisms (P for trend = .86) or gut organisms (P for trend = .06). In the multivariable analysis, implementation of this care bundle was independently associated with a decrease in the CLABSI rate (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66\u20130.88). Compared with patients without CLABSI, patients with CLABSI had a longer average ICU length of stay (27 vs 17 days). Conclusions: A sustainable reduction in the incidence of CLABSI caused by common commensals could be achieved through a cost-saving bundled care program.

Many studies have shown that HAIs may result in an increase in hospital length of stay, antibiotic use, multidrug-resistant organism (MDROs) infections, treatment costs, and mortality. Therefore, in the past 5 years, the Department of Infection Control of Cho RayHospital has carried outmany infection and prevention control (IPC) activities to reduce the rates of HAI and MDRO infection. We evaluated IPC activities and results achieved in these efforts at Cho Ray Hospital during 2017\u20132021. Methods: We described the implemented IPC activities and retrospectively collected data fromHAIs surveillance reports during 2017\u20132021 for 3 intensive care units (ICUs): ICU-B, ICU-D, and the NICU. Results: In the past 5 years, we implemented synchronous IPC activities, including promoting hand hygiene training and surveillance, environmental cleaning surveillance, carrying out improvement projects such as a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention bundle, an MDRO prevention bundle, and an environmental cleaning quality improvement project. Many positive results were achieved, although a slight increase in the HAI incidence occurred in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the hand hygiene compliance rate increased from 49.7% to 83.8%. The rate of HAIs per 1,000 patient days decreased steadily from 5.4 to 2.4. The VAP rate fell from 30.5 to 17.2 per 1,000 patient days, and the centralline\u2013associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate decreased gradually from 5.4 to 2.4 per 1,000 patient days. The catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rate decreased from 2.9 to 0.9 per 1,000 patient days, and the MDRO infection rate decreased significantly from 32.7 to 11.3 per 1,000 patient days. Conclusions: The synchronous implementation of HAI prevention bundles promoting hand hygiene and environmental\nS18 2023;3 Suppl 1\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ash.2023.53 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
