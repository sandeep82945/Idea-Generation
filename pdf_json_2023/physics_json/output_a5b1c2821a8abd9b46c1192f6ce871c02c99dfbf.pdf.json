    "abstractText": "Ruta chalepensis is an herb used to treat various ailments, and its potential cytotoxic effects on different tumor cell lines have been extensively studied. The present study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of R. chalepensis methanol extract (RCME), sub-partitions obtained from solvents of increasing polarity, and major compounds, as well as their hemolytic, anti-hemolytic, and antioxidant potential. The in vitro cytotoxic activity against the human hepatocarcinoma (HEP-G2) and the murine lymphoma cell line (L5178Y-R) was evaluated using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay, whereas selectivity indices (SIs) were determined by comparing cytotoxicity against normal African green monkey kidney cells (VERO) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Hemolytic and anti-hemolytic activities were evaluated on human erythrocytes. The most effective cytotoxic treatment was evaluated for nitric oxide release by J774A.1 macrophages. Antioxidant activity of R. chalepensis material was also determined. Results showed that RCME produced significant (p < 0.05) cytotoxicity in HEP-G2 (IC50 = 1.79 \u03bcg/mL) and L5178Y-R (IC50 = 1.60 \u03bcg/mL) cells and exhibited high SIs (291.50 and 114.80, respectively). In addition, the n-hexane fraction (RCHF) showed an IC50 of 18.31 \u03bcg/mL in HEP-G2 cells and an SI of 9.48 in VERO cells, whereas the chloroform fraction (RCCF) evidenced an IC50 of 1.60 \u03bcg/mL in L5178Y-R cells and an SI of 34.27 in PBMC cells. Chalepensin (CHL), rutamarin (RTM), and graveolin (GRV), which are major components of R. chalepensis, showed high activity against L5178Y-R cells, with IC50 of 9.15, 15.13 and SI of 45.08 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In addition, CHL, RTM, and GRV showed SIs of 24.76, 9.98, and 3.52, respectively, when compared with PBMC cells. RCME at concentrations of 125 \u03bcg/mL and 250 \u03bcg/mL, significantly (p < 0.05) decreased nitrite production in J774A.1 cells, when exposed to lipopolysaccharide. This study demonstrated that RCME showed significant cytotoxic activity against HEP-G2 and L5178Y-R cells, without affecting normal VERO, PBMC, and J774A.1 cells.",

Current alternatives for cancer therapy that are available and effective are limited and often produce severe toxic and side effects [2]. Thus, searching for new, effective, safe, and affordable anticancer drugs is part of many significant modern drug discovery efforts worldwide. Plants have been studied for their potential antitumor effects [3]. Ruta chalepensis L. (Rutaceae), also known as rue or ruta, is a medicinal plant native to the Mediterranean region used for its medicinal properties globally. In Mexico, this plant is used by indigenous communities to treat gastrointestinal diseases [4], and studies have proven its cytotoxic, anti-hemolytic, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and abortive activities [5\u20139]. R. chalepensis possesses different natural metabolites that are bioactive, which are distributed in leaves, stems, and roots, such as alkaloids (graveoline), coumarins (rutamarin), flavonoids, and furanocoumarins (chalepensin) [6,10\u201312]. There are several studies on Ruta species that describe the pharmaceutical properties associated with their bioactive compounds [12]. The ethanol extract of R. chalepensis and the flavonoid rutin present in R. chalepensis protect red blood cells from oxidative stress induced by radicals, such as 2,2\u2032-azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), in patients with colon cancer [13]. In an in vivo mouse model, R. chalepensis ethanol extract was shown to possess potent immunopharmacological properties that counteracted the lethal effects of high doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [14]. Furthermore, the antiplatelet activity of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanol extracts of R. chalepensis, as well as chalepensin (CHL) and bergaptene from this plant were studied in vitro in human blood [15]. There are a variety of studies where the extracts, fractions, and major components of plants of the Rutaceae family, showed antioxidant and cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor cells [12,16].To date, there are several studies with furanocoumarins, including CHL (also known as xylotenin) and rutamarin (RTM; also known as chalepin acetate), that report cytotoxic, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, among others [6,15,17\u201320]. Another important family of compounds are the alkaloids, such as graveoline (GRV), which possess antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, apoptotic, and autophagic activity [21\u201323]. However, to date, there are no reports of systematic preclinical or clinical trials of these compounds in humans. We have previously identified R. chalepensis main components, including CHL, RTM, and GRV [6,24,25] (Figure 1) and reported the in vitro cytotoxicity of R. chalepensis methanol extract (RCME) on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HEP-G2) cells [5] and murine L5178YR lymphoma cells [26]. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and antihemolytic activities of R. chalepensis methanol extracts, sub-partitions obtained with solvents of increasing polarity (n-hexane, chloroform, and methanol), and major isolated compounds (CHL, RTM, and GRV). In addition, we investigated nitric oxide (NO) release and antioxidant potential induced by the treatment with the highest HEP-G2 and L5178Y-R cytotoxic activity.\nPlants\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0Introduction\u00a0 Cancer\u00a0 is\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0

Details of the methodological steps for this biodirected isolation of R. chalepensis compounds are available in the supplementary material (Supplementary material_Purification Methodology). To purify the main etabolites of R. chalepensis, RCME was separated into different components using n-hexane extraction, and the residue produced exhibited significant activity against HEP-G2 a d L5178Y-R tumor c lls. Subsequent chromatography of this residue on silica gel column resulted in the isolation of CHL. Additional p ocessing of th metha ol residue involved partitioni g b tween MeOH and ethyl EtOAc, followed by chromatography of the EtOAc residue o a silica gel column, and yielded RTM and GRV of high purity. Low yields of secondary metabolites may be due to the extraction method and solvents used in our research, as previous s udies using su critical fluid traction with CO2 showed significant number of components, even more than those reported in rue extracts using dichloromethane and steam distillati [29]. Studies found 6.6% CHL, 7.1% chalepin, 5.5% bergapten, and 0.85% GRV in leaf extracts, whereas in flower extracts, 10.8% CHL, 9.1% RTM, 9.0 psoralen, 7.1% bergapten, and 0.68% GRV were found, and 13% CHL was found\nPlants 2023, 12, 2203 4 of 14\nin stem extracts. Moreover, there may also be a difference in the concentration of secondary metabolites, depending on the part of the plant used, as well as in varieties or subvarieties belonging to the same family in different geographical areas. In this regard, in the essential oil of Ruta graveolens from the West Romanian area, metabolites, such as 2-undecanone (76.19%), 2-nonanone (7.83%), 2-undecanol (1.85%), 2-decanone (0.75%), and bergapten (0.56%), have been found [30]. In addition, other studies reported ketones (2-undecanone, 2-decanone, and 2-dodecanone) that represent >80% of R. chalepensis components [7]."

            "text": "Targeted triggering of tumor cell death is the therapeutic goal of recent cancer treatments. For this purpose, many medicinal plants and plant-derived products are being tested [31,32]. Results of the effect of R. chalepensis extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds on tumor and normal cells toxicity, as well as selectivity indices (SIs) are shown in Table 2. The cell response of adherent HEP-G2 cells was compared with that of Vero cells, whereas the response of non-adherent L5178Y-R cells was compared with that of human PBMC. RCME was most effective against tumor cell lines, showing the highest SIs (291.50 on HEP-G2 cells and 114.80 on L5178Y-R cells) compared with other treatments (p < 0.001), whereas the least effective treatment was RCMF, which evidenced the lowest SIs. R. chalepensis is well known for its uses in traditional medicine. Some of its main components, such as furanocoumarins (chalepine, CHL, and RTM) and alkaloids (GRV), have been evaluated in different countries and their bioactivities have been demonstrated. However, we lack reports on the preclinical testing of these compounds [33\u201335].\nIC50 values (\u00b5g/mL) against tumor and normal cells are presented as means \u00b1 SD, with significant (p < 0.05) differences indicated by different letters within the same column, as determined using the post-hoc Tukey test. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated by dividing the IC50 of normal cells with the IC50 of tumor cell lines after 72 h of incubation and using 0.05 \u00b5g/mL vincristine sulfate as a positive control.\nn-Hexane partition (RCHF) from RCME resulted in a residue with high activity against HEP-G2 tumor cells (IC50 = 18.31 \u00b5g/mL) compared to the other fractions (p < 0.01). RCCF showed high activity against L5178Y-R lymphoma cells (IC50 = 86.14 \u00b5g/mL) compared to other treatments (p < 0.001). However, the CHCl3 partition presented an IC50 of 36.60 \u00b5g/mL against HEP-G2 cells and an IC50 of 1.60 \u00b5g/mL against L5178Y-R cells (p < 0.001). Furanocoumarins, CHL and RTM, and the quinoline alkaloid, GRV, were effective against L5178Y-R cells as they showed a significant growth inhibition effect against these cells (p < 0.01) with IC50 less than 50 \u00b5g/mL and Sis higher than 3.5, indicating their high antitumor potential [5]. Sis of CHL, RTM, and GRV were higher than 3 (lower limit proposed in this research), indicating low toxicity of CHL, RTM, and GRV against normal cells but significant tumor cell growth inhibition [36]; these compounds showed significant higher Sis against L5178YR cells compared to HEP-G2 cells (p < 0.05). Anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, antiparasitic, and amoebicidal activities of these compounds have been documented [6,33,37]. However, most of the studies on the bioactivity of these compounds have been predomi-\nPlants 2023, 12, 2203 5 of 14\nnantly conducted in vitro and only a few conducted in vivo and in silico [22,38]. A study evaluating extracts with solvents of different polarity from Ruta angustifolia showed cytotoxic effect against different tumor lines, highlighting the cytotoxic effect of MeOH and CHCl3 extracts in addition to the cytotoxic effect of different metabolites, such as furanocoumarins (chalepin, CHL, and RTM) and alkaloid (GRV), against human lung carcinoma cells (A549) [39]. A previous study demonstrated that GRV, the principal constituent of R. graveolens, induced both apoptotic and autophagic ROS-mediated cell death in cutaneous melanoma cells, a desirable quality for designing effective anticancer drugs [21], and may support the activity shown by CHL, RTM, and GRV against both tumor cell lines evaluated in this research."

Thus, we evaluated erythrocyte hemolytic and anti-hemolytic effects using the most effective extract against HEP-G2 and L5178Y-R tumor cells. Table 3 shows the hemolytic activity of the different treatments that were previously evaluated against tumor and normal cells. Based on the criteria of Chomchan et al. (2018), in the drug screening system, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) higher than 90 \u00b5g/mL were classified as non-toxic [41]. Thus, all treatments, except GRV, showed low hemolytic activity with IC50 higher than 100 \u00b5g/mL (p < 0.001 compared to other treatments), demonstrating low toxicity to red cells (Table 3).\np\u2014ANOVA <0.001 <0.001 Data represent mean \u00b1 SD of IC50 values (\u00b5g/mL). Different letters within the same column are significantly (p < 0.05) different, analyzed by the post-hoc Tukey test. \u2020 IC50 values above 1500 \u00b5g/mL were not included in the Tukey test analysis. NA: No activity.\nThe AAPH radical-induced hemolysis protection assay is utilized as an ex vivo model to demonstrate the exceptional antioxidant potential of certain natural products as it causes lipid peroxidation in normal red blood cells [42]. Assessment of anti-hemolytic activity revealed that RCMF and RCME had the highest activity, with IC50 values of 9.33 \u00b5g/mL and 28.29 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, whereas RTM and GRV did not exhibit any anti-hemolytic activity (p < 0.001) (Table 3). Protective activity may be attributed to the polyphenol content as polyphenols interact with the components of the erythrocyte membrane through hydrogen bonds and prevent the oxidation of membrane proteins and lipids [43]. This is directly related to the antioxidant potential due to the possible composition of the methanolic extract and its partitions, highlighting some phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and furanocoumarins [5,44\u201346]."

Table 4\nPlants 2023, 12, 2203 6 of 14\nshows murine macrophage viability along with nitrite levels. A significant (p < 0.05) decrease in J774A.1 cells viability was observed after RCME treatment in a concentrationdependent manner, probably because of nitric oxide in these cells, which has been reported to induce murine macrophage apoptosis (20% cytotoxicity) at about 10 \u00b5M nitrites [34]. The capacity of inhibition of NO production caused by RCEM is shown in Table 4. When the inflammatory inducer LPS was used, no significant differences were found at concentrations of 15.62, 31.25, 62.50, and 500 \u00b5g/mL (p > 0.05), but significant differences were observed at concentrations of 125 and 250 \u00b5g/mL in comparison with the control (p < 0.001). IC50 values for RCME and RCME + LPS treatments were 400.78 and 238.13 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (p < 0.01).\nIC50 (\u00b5g/mL) 400.78 \u00b1 51.05 238.13 \u00b1 59.12 Murine macrophages (J774A.1 cells) viability, IC50, and nitrite production (\u00b5M) after RCME and RCME + LPS (2 \u00b5g/mL) treatments. Data represent means \u00b1 SD of triplicate determinations from three independent experiments. Different letters within the same column indicate a significant difference (post-hoc Tukey test).\nCytotoxicity assays were based on Lopez Villarreal et al. [47], considering the following parameters: (a) non-cytotoxic = 75% to 100% viability, (b) slightly cytotoxic = 50% to 74% viability, (c) moderately cytotoxic = 25% to 49% viability, and d) highly cytotoxic = 0% to 24% viability. Furthermore, a previous study with mice showed that R. chalepensis extract possessed potent immunopharmacological properties that counteracted the lethal effects of high doses of LPS in vivo and decreased NO production [14]. Therefore, our results showed that RCME and RCME + LPS effects ranged from non-cytotoxic to moderately cytotoxic. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine during the inflammatory process. The reaction between superoxide and NO results in the formation of peroxynitrite, a toxic substance causing tissue injury in inflammatory diseases [48]. It has been reported that phenolic compounds in natural extracts play a role in LPS-induced inhibition of NO in murine macrophages [41]. Overproduction of NO causes tissue damage and is associated with chronic inflammation [49]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that RCEM possesses immunomodulatory activity in response to LPS-induced inflammation. However, further confirmatory studies are required."

[53] demonstrated IC50 values of 0.12 mg/mL and 0.22 mg/mL for R. chalepensis ethanol and aqueous extracts, respectively.

            "text": "We demonstrated that Ruta chalepensis crude methanol extract, fractions, and its major components chalepensin (CHL), rutamarin (RTM), and graveolin (GRV), possessed significant in vitro cytotoxic activities against HEP-G2 and L5178Y-R cells, with high selectivity indices (SIs), as compared with normal VERO cells and PBMC. The R. chalepensis methanol extract RCME was particularly effective against tumor cells, without affecting normal cells, with a SI of 291.50 for adherent cells and 114.80 for non-adherent cells. This may be attributed to the synergistic effect of various phytochemical compounds of the plant. In addition, RCME decreased nitrite production in resident and LPS-activated J774A.1 macrophages, and reduced their viability in a concentration-dependent manner (probably due to NO [34]). Compounds CHL, RTM, and GRV showed significant cytotoxic effects against L5178YR cells. However, CHL exhibited high SIs against HEP-G2 (SI = 5.08) and L5178Y-R (SI = 24.76) tumor cells, without affecting normal cells. RTM and GRV showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05) of SIs, when evaluated against HEP-G2 cells. CHL and RTM did not show significant hemolytic activity, supporting their potential use in future studies. Based on current findings, CHL, RTM, and GRV compounds may be utilized as antiproliferative biomolecules against tumor cells and to develop potential antitumor therapeutic agents. Therefore, it is necessary to scale-up cytotoxic compounds, using chemical synthesis to study them in-depth and demonstrate their therapeutic effects. We will further investigate the antitumor potential of R. chalepensis extracts, fractions, and major components to treat cancer, such as HEP-G2 hepatocellular carcinoma and L5178Y-R lymphoma, in preclinical models and elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/plants12112203/s1.
