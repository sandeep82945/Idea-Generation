1. **Investigate the effect of different synthesis methods on the structure and performance of Fe-Cu binary oxides.** This could involve varying the reaction temperature, time, or precursors used in the synthesis process. The goal would be to identify the optimal synthesis conditions for producing Fe-Cu binary oxides with the desired properties for arsenic removal.
2. **Explore the use of Fe-Cu binary oxides for the removal of other contaminants from water.** This could include studying the adsorption of heavy metals, organic pollutants, or nutrients. The goal would be to determine the effectiveness of Fe-Cu binary oxides for removing a wide range of contaminants from water.
3. **Develop composite materials based on Fe-Cu binary oxides for enhanced arsenic removal.** This could involve combining Fe-Cu binary oxides with other materials, such as activated carbon or graphene oxide. The goal would be to create composite materials with improved adsorption capacity, selectivity, or regeneration properties.
4. **Investigate the mechanisms of arsenic adsorption on Fe-Cu binary oxides.** This could involve using spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, to identify the surface complexes that form between arsenic and Fe-Cu binary oxides. The goal would be to gain a better understanding of the adsorption process and to identify potential strategies for improving arsenic removal efficiency.
5. **Develop pilot-scale or full-scale systems for arsenic removal using Fe-Cu binary oxides.** This would involve designing and testing systems that can effectively remove arsenic from water at a larger scale. The goal would be to demonstrate the feasibility of using Fe-Cu binary oxides for arsenic removal in practical applications.
