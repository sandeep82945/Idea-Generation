1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food choice motives.** The paper highlights that it is too early to give definite answers as to what food choice motives in the post-COVID-19 era will be like. A longitudinal study could be conducted to track changes in food choice motives over time, to determine if the changes observed during the pandemic are sustained or if they revert to pre-pandemic patterns.


2. **Explore the role of socio-economic factors in shaping food choice motives during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** The paper mentions that low-income consumers may be more affected by the foreseeable economic global recession, and that price may be the most important selection criterion for food choice in the new era. A study could be conducted to examine how socio-economic factors, such as income, education, and employment status, influence food choice motives during and after the pandemic.


3. **Examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food waste and environmental sustainability.** The paper briefly discusses the ethical concerns related to food waste and environmental impacts, and mentions that food waste may have increased during the pandemic due to factors such as overbuying and overcooked foods. A study could be conducted to quantify the changes in food waste and environmental impacts during the pandemic, and to explore the factors that contribute to these changes.


4. **Investigate the role of online food shopping in shaping food choice motives.** The paper highlights the increase in online food shopping during the pandemic, and suggests that this trend may continue in the future. A study could be conducted to examine the impact of online food shopping on food choice motives, and to explore the factors that influence consumers' choices when shopping for food online.


5. **Develop and validate a new index of consumer satisfaction that reflects the changes in food choice motives during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.** The paper proposes the need for a "new" index of consumer satisfaction that can alter the sale strategies of retail managers and food companies. A study could be conducted to develop and validate such an index, taking into account the changes in food choice motives observed during the pandemic.
