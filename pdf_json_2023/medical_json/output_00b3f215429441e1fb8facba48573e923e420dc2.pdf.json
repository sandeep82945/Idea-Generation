    "abstractText": "It has been suggested that glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) better reflects chronic inflammation than high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Despite, this pediatric/life course data are sparse. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and UK Biobank, we compared short(over weeks) and long-term (over years) correlations of GlycA and hsCRP, cross-sectional correlations between GlycA and hsCRP, and associations of proinflammatory risk factors with GlycA and hsCRP. Across all ages, GlycA showed high shortterm (weeks) stability (r=0.61-0.73), and moderate long-term (years) stability (r=0.34-0.74). Long-term stability was higher for GlycA compared to hsCRP (r=0.26-0.65). GlycA and concurrently measured hsCRP were moderately correlated (r=0.50-0.61). We found similar associations of known proinflammatory factors, including BMI, smoking, and inflammatory diseases with GlycA and hsCRP. This study showed that GlycA has greater long-term stability compared to hsCRP, however associations of proinflammatory factors with GlycA and hsCRP were broadly similar. Teaser (125 characters) GlycA has greater long-term stability compared to hsCRP although their association with proinflammatory factors are similar. All rights reserved.

Across all ages, GlycA showed high shortterm (weeks) stability (r=0.61-0.73), and moderate long-term (years) stability (r=0.34-0.74). Long-term stability was higher for GlycA compared to hsCRP (r=0.26-0.65). GlycA and concurrently measured hsCRP were moderately correlated (r=0.50-0.61). We found similar associations of known proinflammatory factors, including BMI, smoking, and inflammatory diseases with GlycA and hsCRP.

It is characterised by the rapid increase of inflammatory markers (e.g., acute phase proteins and cytokines) locally and systemically, and by the accumulation of immune cells in affected tissue (1) (2). In some cases, a dysregulation of the immune system prevents the resolution of the acute inflammatory response and this can lead to a state of systemic, low-grade chronic inflammation (3-5). Certain factors, which can be biological, social or behavioural can also lead to chronic inflammation (3-5). It increases with age (6) and differs between the sexes, for example susceptibility of inflammatory diseases varies between males and females (7-9). Additionally, chronic inflammation is associated with lower economic position (10), smoking frequency [10], obesity (11-13) and alcohol consumption (14).\nChronic inflammation is usually assessed using circulating biomarkers such as cytokines and acute-phase proteins and it is associated with the prevalence, incidence and progression of non-communicable diseases (15) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) (16, 17), cancer (18- 20), type-two diabetes (T2D) (21), depression (22, 23), schizophrenia (24), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (25), and bipolar disorder (26, 27). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 prospective population-based studies found that a one standard deviation increase in the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), interlukin-18 (IL-18) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were each associated with a 10-25% increase in the risk of non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction (28). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 107 case-control studies (n = 5166 with depression, n = 5083 controls) found that levels of seven inflammatory biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and IL-6, were higher in\nAll rights reserved.

A key challenge for inflammation research is identifying biomarkers that reliably reflect systemic, chronic, and low-grade inflammation. Currently, one of the most widely used biomarker is hsCRP, which is an acute phase protein (30). Other commonly used biomarkers include pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (31). However, short-term variability in circulating levels and rapid kinetics in response to infection or other acute stimuli undermine the utility of these single-protein biomarkers as measures of chronic inflammation (32-34). Composite biomarkers derived from multiple proteins may be more suitable than single-protein biomarkers when measuring chronic inflammation because, unlike single-protein markers, if one component changes, the others may be unaffected, meaning the signal is less subject to acute fluctuations (33).\nGlycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) is a composite biomarker of inflammation (35, 36). It is quantified using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) (37) and reflects the extent and complexity of N-glycosylation of a number acute phase proteins (predominantly alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin) (38). Given that GlycA, unlike hsCRP, is a composite marker of inflammation, it should be less reactive to changes in the environment and as such it has been proposed to be a more stable measure of chronic inflammation compared to acute phase markers such as hsCRP or IL-6 (39).\nGlycA has been shown to be positively associated with inflammatory non-communicable diseases (40-42) such as incident CVD events (43), as well as hospitalisation and death from infection (44). Despite this, studies investigating GlycA\u2019s short-term stability are lacking, as\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We hypothesised that GlycA would show greater stability over time than hsCRP and display similar or stronger associations with inflammation-related factors (particularly chronic inflammatory states) compared to hsCRP, given that GlycA should reflect chronic inflammation, whereas hsCRP responds to acute inflammatory triggers."

The only factor where the two biomarkers diverged was sex. GlycA was higher in females than males at ages 15y and 18y but this difference attenuated to the null by 24y. Conversely, mean hsCRP did not differ between sexes at 15y but was higher in females than males at both 18y and 24y. In models adjusted for age and sex (model 2), results were similar to those described for model 1. In a model including all available potential determinants (model 3 and Figure 2), BMI and having a recent infection were positively associated with both GlycA and hsCRP at the time points they were recorded.

The single short-term correlation of hsCRP were similar in magnitude to the shortterm GlycA correlations and GlycA and hsCRP were moderately correlated with each other throughout the life course. In contrast, long-term intra-biomarker correlations for GlycA were slightly stronger than those for hsCRP and similar in magnitude to the autocorrelation estimated by a study by Ritchie et al. which used 3 repeated measures taken over the course of a decade (r=0.43) (44). Our results are in line with previous literature which suggests that GlycA has greater stability across the life course compared to hsCRP and this may be because GlycA is a composite biomarker of inflammation, whereas hsCRP is an acute phase reactant (45).Therefore, GlycA may capture the chronic inflammatory response, whereas hsCRP is more likely to reflect the acute response only, potentially reflected by hsCRP\u2019s typical positively skewed distribution. Further, the difference in stability between GlycA and hsCRP could also explain previous literature which has found that GlycA remains associated with proinflammatory diseases such as CVD, even after adjusting for hsCRP (41). Interestingly however, by logging hsCRP, variation is reduced (see supplementary Figure 4) and our results found comparable associations of pro-inflammatory risk factors including arthritis and BMI with both hsCRP and GlycA.\nThere were some differences between the associations when using ALSPAC compared to UKBB. We found an association between the atopy cluster and hsCRP and GlycA levels when using the UKBB data, but not with a diagnosis of atopy in ALSPAC offspring or mothers. This may be because UKBB classifies diseases based on hospitalisation and therefore is likely to\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

We were able to investigate the short-term stability of GlycA, which has not been previously reported.\nHowever, we also acknowledge some limitations. Short-term repeat hsCRP data were unavailable for most clinics, so it was only possible to assess short-term stability of hsCRP at 24yrs. Some variables such as smoking frequency and alcohol consumption rely on selfreport and cannot be validated. Further, given the nature of longitudinal research, not all variables were recorded at all time points in the ALSPAC. Additionally, although chronic disorders were recorded in UKBB, several of the diseases are characterised by acute flares in disease activity, but this was not assessed. There was also an under-representation of ethnic minority populations in both datasets, which perpetuates existing research disparities and limits the generalisability of the current findings."
