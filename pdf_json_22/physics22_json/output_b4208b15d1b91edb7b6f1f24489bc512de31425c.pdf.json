    "abstractText": "In space gravitational-wave-detection missions, inertial sensors are used as the core loads, and their acceleration noise needs to reach 3\u00d7 10\u221215 ms\u22122/ \u221a Hz at a frequency of 0.1 mHz, which corresponds to the capacitive sensing system; the capacitive sensing noise on the sensitive axis needs to reach 1 aF/ \u221a Hz. Unlike traditional circuit noise evaluation, the noise in the mHz frequency band is dominated by the thermal noise and the 1/f noise of the device, which is a challenging technical goal. In this paper, a low-frequency, high-precision resonant capacitor bridge method based on a planar transformer is used. Compared with the traditional winding transformer, the developed planar transformer has the advantages of low temperature drift and low 1/f noise. For closed-loop measurements of capacitive sensing circuits and sensitive structures, the minimum capacitive resolution in the time domain is about 3 aF, which is far lower than the scientific measurement resolution requirement of 5.8 fF for gravitational wave detection. The capacitive sensing noise is converted to 1.095 aF/ \u221a Hz in the frequency band of 10 mHz\u20131 Hz. Although there is a gap between the closed-loop measurement results and the final index, the measurement environment is an experimental condition without temperature control on the ground; additionally, in China, the measurement integrity and actual measurement results of the capacitive sensing function have reached a domestic leading level. This is the realization of China\u2019s future space gravitational wave exploration.",

            "text": "In space gravitational-wave-detection missions, inertial sensors are used as the core load, and their accuracy levels directly limit the sensitivity level of the final low-frequency band of the space gravitational-wave-detection mission. The sensitive structure and capacitive sensing circuit are the core components of an inertial sensor, and the sensitive structure includes the test mass and the electrode cage. Capacitive sensing circuits measure changes in capacitance caused by the movement of the test mass in sensitive structures, and its measurement accuracy has a direct impact on the resolution of the sensor. According to the requirements of the top-level indicators of the detection system, its acceleration noise needs to reach 3\u00d7 10\u221215 ms\u22122/ \u221a Hz at a frequency of 0.1 mHz, which corresponds to the capacitive transmission on the sensitive axis of the capacitive sensing system. Sensing noise needs to be as low as 1 aF/ \u221a Hz. The performance of capacitive sensing directly affects the accuracy and even the success or failure of the space gravitational-wave-detection system. Different from the traditional idea of circuit signal-to-noise ratio optimization, in the mHz frequency band, the thermal noise and the device\u2019s 1/f noise is dominant, and circuit noise optimization for low-frequency bands requires new design ideas. Therefore,\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22239284 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 2 of 17\nit is of great scientific significance to carry out research on the scheme of high-precision capacitive sensing systems [1\u20135]. Because the bridge-detection circuit has the advantages of high resolution, high stability, and not being easily affected by parasitic capacitance, it has been successfully applied to precision measurement instruments, such as inclinometers and gravimeters, from as early as 1973. Transformers are used to convert the displacement of the mechanical structure into an electronic signal. The electrostatic accelerometer series products used in gravity satellites developed by ONERA in France and the space inertial sensors in the LISA program developed by the University of Trento in Italy all use bridge-type capacitive sensing detection circuits based on traditional winding planar transformers [6]. In 2017, the LISA team reported the performance of the capacitive sensing system of inertial sensors on the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft [7]. Through measurements during spaceflight, the system has demonstrated a capacitive sensing noise level of 1 aF/ \u221a Hz, matching the performance metrics of the LISA Pathfinder, and is poised to be applied to subsequent LISA gravitational-wave-detection projects. The experiments carried out by the relevant domestic research institutions on the capacitive sensing system have been carried out on the self-made capacitive calibration platform [8], but the capacitive calibration platform is not the actual measurement object in actual inertial sensors. There are also capacitive sensing systems applied to accelerometers [9], and the resolution used to satisfy them is 2\u00d7 10\u221212 ms\u22122/ \u221a Hz, the design ideas of accelerometers and inertial sensors are different, and the accelerometer does not include detection of angular acceleration. The input signal of capacitive sensing passes through the transformer, and the signalto-noise ratio at the resonant point of the transformer determines the signal accuracy level of capacitive sensing in the low-frequency band. Traditional transformers are wound with copper wires, which are easily affected by temperature, and it is difficult to use them to meet the capacitive sensing index in the millihertz frequency band. Traditional transformers are wound with copper wires. The planar transformer circuit uses PCB wiring instead of copper wires, which has the advantages of low temperature drift and low 1/f noise; however, the design of planar transformers is complicated, often requiring the introduction of interleaved capacitors due to improper design [10,11]. This leads to a reduction in the transformer quality factor (Q value), which is unable to meet the index requirements. So far, research on planar transformers used in capacitive sensing systems at home and abroad has not reached deep enough. Capacitive sensing systems can not only be used in the detection of gravitational waves in space [12\u201314], but can also be used in the precise measurement of inertial drag effects, in testing the equivalent principle [15\u201317], and in measuring relativistic effects with gyroscopes [18] and other applications. Based on the requirements of China\u2019s future space gravitational-wave-detection Taiji program, for the low-frequency, high-precision resonant bridge circuit, a capacitive sensing circuit and a closed-loop measurement tool for sensitive structures are developed for a planar transformer with high Q value, low temperature drift, and low 1/f noise. The minimum capacitance resolution in the time domain is about 3 aF, which is much lower than the scientific measurement resolution requirement of 5.8 fF for gravitational wave detection. In the frequency band of 10 mHz\u20131 Hz, the capacitive sensing noise is measured to be 1.095 aF/ \u221a Hz. Although there is a gap between the closed-loop measurement results and the final index, the measurement environment is an experimental condition without temperature control on the ground, and the measurement integrity and actual measurement results of the capacitive sensing function have reached the domestic leading level in China; this is the realization of China\u2019s future space gravitational wave exploration. It is an important technology that forms a design-and-evaluation principle for low-frequency, high-precision capacitive sensing systems. The content of this article is as follows. Section 2 introduces the design of the planar transformer, and the composition and basic working principle of the capacitive sensing circuit. Section 3 presents the ground experimental setup and actual measurements, as well\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 3 of 17\nas data evaluation results. The final section provides a comprehensive summary of the work of this paper."

Block diagra of the single TM-sensing channel electronics along the x-axis.\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 4 of 17\nFigure 2 is a block diagram of the single TM-sensing channel electronics along the x-axis, with the remaining channels omitted for simplicity. Two pairs of electrodes (A+/A\u2212, B+/B\u2212) allow simultaneous measurement of TM displacement and rotation by measuring the gap between the electrodes on opposite sides of the TM. For small TM displacements, the capacitance is proportional to the corresponding TM electrode gap. An AC-excitation signal is injected into the TM. The differential current that is amplified and converted to an AC-induced voltage proportional to the TM displacement is filtered at the AC-excitation frequency, and the final amplitude is demodulated and converted to a DC voltage digital value. The capacitive sensing system circuit includes an analog front-end and an ACamplifier circuit, a band-pass filter circuit, a demodulation circuit, an analog-to-digital conversion circuit, and a total of four functional module circuits. Similarly, the other eight electrodes (not shown) were used to derive TM motion. The TM is surrounded by four sense/drive electrodes on each axis. A stable 100 kHz AC signal was applied to the TM through the red excitation-injection electrode in Figure 1. The electrode pair A+/A\u2212 is defined as the first sensing channel of the x-axis, and the electrode pair B+/B\u2212 is defined as the second sensing channel of the x-axis. To overcome the need to specify different position sensing requirements for each axis (displacement or rotation), the requirement is to convert to capacitance and have an equal range on all axes (channels), i.e., scientific measurement resolution of 5.8 fF. The range is \u00b10.12 pF for the mode and \u00b12.5 pF for the wide-range (WR) mode. The capacitive sensing noise of the key technical indicators is required to be measured in the scientific measurement (HR) mode, so this paper focuses on the scientific measurement (HR) mode."

The purpose of the preamplifier is to receive and amplify the differential transformer signal. The main advantage of the transimpedance amplifiers with the gain controlled by a single component (a small feedback capacitor in the pF range) is that the transfer function is very flat around the resonance point, which makes the design less sensitive to temperature changes. Therefore, the transimpedance amplifier was chosen as the design solution for the preamplifier. In addition, for the sake of symmetry and high SNR, the design scheme of the differential transimpedance amplifier can be adopted.\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 5 of 17\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 equivalent\u00a0 test\u00a0mass\u00a0 (Figure\u00a0 3)\u00a0 is\u00a0 surrounded\u00a0 by\u00a0 an\u00a0 electrode\u00a0 housing\u00a0 that\u00a0 houses\u00a012\u00a0sensing/driving\u00a0electrodes\u00a0(2\u00a0electrodes\u00a0on\u00a0each\u00a0side\u2014green\u00a0electrodes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 figure),\u00a0forming\u00a06\u00a0pairs\u00a0of\u00a0sensing\u00a0electrodes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure\u00a03.\u00a0Yellow\u00a0represents\u00a0 the\u00a0 test\u00a0mass;\u00a0green\u00a0represents\u00a0 the\u00a0sensing/driving\u00a0electrode;\u00a0brown\u00a0 represents\u00a0the\u00a0excitation\u2010injection\u00a0electrode.\u00a0 Six\u00a0excitation\u00a0electrodes\u00a0(one\u00a0each\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Y\u00a0side\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0equivalent\u00a0test\u00a0mass\u00a0and\u00a0two\u00a0 on\u00a0each\u00a0Z\u00a0side\u2014brown\u00a0electrodes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0figure)\u00a0are\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0inject\u00a0excitation\u00a0signals.\u00a0 2.2.\u00a0Analog\u00a0Front\u2010End\u00a0and\u00a0AC\u2010Amplifier\u00a0Circuit\u00a0 As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04,\u00a0the\u00a0analog\u00a0front\u2010end\u00a0and\u00a0AC\u2010amplifier\u00a0circuits\u00a0are\u00a0composed\u00a0\nof\u00a0tuning\u00a0capacitors,\u00a0transformers,\u00a0preamplifiers,\u00a0and\u00a0main\u00a0amplifiers.\u00a0The\u00a0purpose\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 preamplifier\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0receive\u00a0and\u00a0amplify\u00a0the\u00a0differential\u00a0transformer\u00a0signal.\u00a0The\u00a0main\u00a0ad\u2010 vantage\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0transimpedance\u00a0amplifiers\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0gain\u00a0controlled\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0single\u00a0component\u00a0 (a\u00a0 small\u00a0 feedback\u00a0 capacitor\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 pF\u00a0 range)\u00a0 is\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0 transfer\u00a0 function\u00a0 is\u00a0 very\u00a0 flat\u00a0 around\u00a0 the\u00a0 resonance\u00a0 point,\u00a0 which\u00a0 makes\u00a0 the\u00a0 design\u00a0 less\u00a0 sensitive\u00a0 to\u00a0 temperature\u00a0 changes.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0the\u00a0transimpedance\u00a0amplifier\u00a0was\u00a0chosen\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0solution\u00a0for\u00a0 the\u00a0preamplifier.\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0sake\u00a0of\u00a0symmetry\u00a0and\u00a0high\u00a0SNR,\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0scheme\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0differential\u00a0transimpedance\u00a0amplifier\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0adopted.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0Analog\u00a0front\u2010end\u00a0and\u00a0AC\u2010amplifier\u00a0circuits.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0differential\u00a0capacitance\u00a0 change\u00a0 is\u00a0 the\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0positional\u00a0 change\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 test\u00a0 mass.\u00a0The\u00a0excitation\u00a0signal,\u00a0 \ud835\udc49 ,\u00a0is\u00a0injected\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0differential\u00a0capacitor,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0voltage\u00a0 generated\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0amplifier\u00a0end\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0transformer\u00a0is\u00a0calculated\u00a0as\u00a0follows:\u00a0\n\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc361 \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc49 \u00a0 (3)\nThe differential capacitance change is the amount of positional change in the test mass.

Traditional wound transformers are made of copper wire by hand, so the production is simple, the processing cycle is short, and the cost is low, but the disadvantage is that the copper wire is easily affected by heat, and same-batch transformers have poor parameter consistency. Planar transformers use PCB internal wiring and winding, so the transformer parameters produced in the same batch are consistent, accurate, and controllable, and the PCB thermal expansion coefficient is low.\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 7 of 17\nDesigning a planar transformer requires consideration of core selection, PCB board selection, and winding design. According to the permeability coefficient and temperature coefficient of the magnetic core at the operating frequency of 100 kHz, we use manganese\u2013 zinc ferrite N48 [20] as the magnetic core of our planar transformer. According to the inductance coefficient of N48 (AL = 630 nH) and the required transformer inductance value (4.2 mH), we calculate the number of winding turns as follows:\nAL = L\nN2 (10)\n\u2211 l A = le Ae\n(11)\nL = \u00b5e\u00b50N2\n\u2211 lA (12)\nIt is calculated that the number of winding turns N = 80 is a reasonable design value. The board needs to have a relatively low dielectric constant to minimize interleaving\ncapacitance, and multilayer boards need to be fabricated to meet the number of turns required. This is divided into three planar winding boards (two primary and one secondary) by the available depth based on the chosen core N48 size. To reduce staggered capacitance, two annular spacers are made of the same substrate. The required 80 winding turns are divided into sixteen layers of circuit boards to achieve five turns per layer, and the designed inductance value is generated. A deconstructed view of a planar transformer is shown in Figure 6.\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nby\u00a0the\u00a0available\u00a0depth\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0chosen\u00a0core\u00a0N48\u00a0size.\u00a0To\u00a0reduce\u00a0staggered\u00a0capaci\u2010 tance,\u00a0two\u00a0annular\u00a0spacers\u00a0are\u00a0made\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0substrate.\u00a0The\u00a0required\u00a080\u00a0winding\u00a0turns\u00a0 are\u00a0divided\u00a0into\u00a0sixteen\u00a0layers\u00a0of\u00a0circuit\u00a0boards\u00a0to\u00a0achieve\u00a0five\u00a0turns\u00a0per\u00a0layer,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 designed\u00a0inductance\u00a0value\u00a0is\u00a0generated.\u00a0A\u00a0deconstructed\u00a0view\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0planar\u00a0transformer\u00a0is\u00a0 shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a06.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a0 6.\u00a0Deconstructed\u00a0view\u00a0 along\u00a0 the\u00a0 ferrite\u00a0 core,\u00a0planar\u00a0winding\u00a0 circuit\u00a0board,\u00a0 spacers,\u00a0 and\u00a0\nclamps.\u00a0\nEach\u00a0board\u00a0has\u00a0five\u00a0turns\u00a0of\u00a0winding\u00a0copper\u00a0wire,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0top\u00a0and\u00a0bottom\u00a0layers\u00a0of\u00a0 each\u00a0laminate\u00a0are\u00a0slightly\u00a0staggered\u00a0by\u00a0about\u00a00.1\u00a0mm\u00a0to\u00a0reduce\u00a0stagger\u00a0capacitance.\u00a0Each\u00a0 laminate\u00a0will\u00a0connect\u00a0the\u00a0upper\u00a0set\u00a0of\u00a0five\u00a0turns\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0lower\u00a0set\u00a0via\u00a0blind\u00a0buried\u00a0vias.\u00a0The\u00a0 two\u2010primary\u00a0planar\u00a0winding\u00a0circuit\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0 two\u2010secondary\u00a0planar\u00a0winding\u00a0circuit\u00a0are\u00a0 identical\u00a0because\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0good\u00a0repeatability\u00a0between\u00a0all\u00a0windings\u00a0in\u00a0printed\u00a0circuit\u00a0board\u00a0 technology,\u00a0which\u00a0fully\u00a0reflects\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0advantages\u00a0of\u00a0planar\u00a0transformers.\u00a0Figure\u00a07\u00a0 shows\u00a0the\u00a0planar\u00a0transformer\u00a0developed\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0paper.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0Planar\u00a0transformer\u00a0developed\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0paper.\u00a0\n2.4.\u00a0Band\u2010Pass\u00a0Filter\u00a0Module,\u00a0Demodulation\u00a0Module,\u00a0and\u00a0Analog\u2010to\u2010Digital\u00a0Conversion\u00a0Module\u00a0 The\u00a0band\u2010pass\u00a0filter\u00a0module\u00a0selects\u00a0the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0signal\u00a0output\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0AC\u2010 amplifier\u00a0module\u00a0and\u00a0filters\u00a0out\u00a0the\u00a0frequencies\u00a0other\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0excitation\u00a0signal.\u00a0The\u00a0band\u2010 pass\u00a0filter\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0paper\u00a0uses\u00a0a\u00a0low\u2010pass\u00a0filter\u00a0in\u00a0series\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0high\u2010pass\u00a0filter,\u00a0and\u00a0finally\u00a0 adjusts\u00a0the\u00a0amplitude\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0output\u00a0amplitude\u00a0remains\u00a0unchanged.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a08,\u00a0the\u00a0bandwidth\u00a0range\u00a0is\u00a071\u00a0kHz~139\u00a0kHz.\u00a0Since\u00a0the\u00a0demodulation\u00a0module\u00a0is\u00a0 not\u00a0ideal,\u00a0large\u00a0out\u2010of\u2010band\u00a0noise\u00a0may\u00a0leak\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0demodulated\u00a0frequency\u00a0band.\u00a0There\u2010 fore,\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0narrower\u00a0bandpass\u00a0filter,\u00a0the\u00a0design\u00a0difficulty\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0demodulation\u00a0module\u00a0will\u00a0 be\u00a0reduced.\u00a0On\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0hand,\u00a0the\u00a0gain\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0filter\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0very\u00a0narrow\u00a0passband\u00a0is\u00a0more\u00a0 sensitive\u00a0 to\u00a0changes\u00a0 in\u00a0 its\u00a0components\u00a0 (resistors\u00a0and\u00a0capacitors)\u00a0with\u00a0 temperature,\u00a0 for\u00a0\nEach board has five turns of winding copper wire, and the top and bottom layers of each laminate are slightly staggered by about 0.1 mm to reduce stagger capacitance. Each laminate will connect the upper set of five turns to the lower set via blind buried vias. The two-primary planar winding circuit and the two-secondary planar winding circuit are identical because of the good repeatability between all windings in printed circuit board technology, which fully reflects the design advantages of planar transformers.

            "text": "The band-pass filter module selects the frequency of the signal output by the ACamplifier module and filters out the frequencies other than the excitation signal. The band-pass filter in this paper uses a low-pass filter in series with a high-pass filter, and finally adjusts the amplitude to ensure that the output amplitude remains unchanged. As shown in Figure 8, the bandwidth range is 71~139 kHz. Since the demodulation module is not ideal, large out-of-band noise may leak into the demodulated frequency\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 8 of 17\nband. Therefore, for a narrower bandpass filter, the design difficulty of the demodulation module will be reduced. On the other hand, the gain of a filter with a very narrow passband is more sensitive to changes in its components (resistors and capacitors) with temperature, for which the above bandwidth range is chosen.

This text adopts the scheme of switch demodulation. The modulated signal first needs to go through the electronic switch demodulation circuit to separate the 100 kHz carrier signal from the noise spectrum and to separate the voltage signal close to DC. The AC signal is averaged to a DC voltage and an analog switch is used to rectify the signal. Since the noise is randomly phase-shifted relative to the demodulator control signal, the rectified noise averages zero. After the signal goes to DC, the low-frequency drift of the op amp (OP) can greatly affect the sensing resolution. Therefore, all the OPs in the circuit use auto-zero amplifiers, which basically do not exhibit 1/ f noise characteristics. The post-stage adopts a third-order\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 9 of 17\nButterworth low-pass filter, and the \u22123 dB corner frequency is located at 5 Hz. The final stage consists of non-inverting and inverting auto-zero buffers, each including low-pass filtering to eliminate auto-zero switching noise. The low-noise analog-to-digital conversion module uses the analog-to-digital conversion chip to convert the analog quantity of the capacitive sensing circuit into a digital quantity and enter the digital control circuit for processing. AD7712 (Analog Devices, Wilmington, MA, USA) is a complete analog front-end chip suitable for low-frequency measurement applications. It has 24-bit high-precision analog-to-digital conversion performance and has two analog input channels that can directly receive low-level signals from sensing circuits. The AD7712 has an internal PGA gain function that can be configured from 1\u00d7 to 128\u00d7 the analog gain. The working-principle diagram of the analog-to-digital conversion module is shown in Figure 9.

The negative terminal of the AH2700A ultra-precision capacitor bridge is connected to X. A+, X. B+, and six other measurement-sensitive structures have differences in the electrode tolerance; the measured voltage values are shown in Table 4. In fitting the circuit gain curve, as shown in Figure 12, we find that the circuit gain is 19.14 V/pF, the full range of scientific measurement (HR) mode is \u00b10.12 pF, and the full-scale tolerance corresponds to \u00b12.3 V voltage value, which meets the AD chip \u00b12.5 V range. By controlling the hexapod PI console to uniformly adjust the position of the test mass, the tolerance values of multiple sets of X-axis directions are obtained by measuring with a capacitance meter, which corresponds to the voltage output value obtained by the capacitance sensing and electrostatic servo control subsystem.

The data-collection model is DAQ970A. There is no temperaturecontrol measure for the ambient temperature. As shown in Figure 19b, at the beginning of the experiment, the capacitive sensing system starts cold. Because there is no temperaturecontrol measure in this experiment, there is an obvious temperature rise and a stable trend in the first half of the figure. The DAQ970A measures the single-point temperature change in the experimental environment. The resistance\u2013capacitance and op amp devices on the sensing circuit need a longer time to achieve temperature balance. When the measurement time is long enough, the temperature and the capacitive sensing time-domain voltage tend to be stable at the same time, and the capacitive sensing time-domain voltage has no obvious temperature drift.\nSensors\u00a02022,\u00a022,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 16\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nbeginning\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0experiment,\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0system\u00a0starts\u00a0cold.\u00a0Because\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0no\u00a0 temperature\u2010control\u00a0measure\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0experiment,\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0obvious\u00a0temperature\u00a0rise\u00a0and\u00a0 a\u00a0stable\u00a0trend\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0half\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0figure.\u00a0The\u00a0DAQ970A\u00a0measures\u00a0the\u00a0single\u2010point\u00a0tem\u2010 perature\u00a0 change\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 experimental\u00a0 environment.\u00a0The\u00a0 resistance\u2013capacitance\u00a0 and\u00a0 op\u00a0 amp\u00a0devices\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0sensing\u00a0circuit\u00a0need\u00a0a\u00a0 longer\u00a0 time\u00a0 to\u00a0achieve\u00a0 temperature\u00a0balance.\u00a0 When\u00a0the\u00a0measurement\u00a0time\u00a0is\u00a0long\u00a0enough,\u00a0the\u00a0temperature\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0 time\u2010domain\u00a0voltage\u00a0tend\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0stable\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0time,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0time\u2010 domain\u00a0voltage\u00a0has\u00a0no\u00a0obvious\u00a0temperature\u00a0drift.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a019.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Experimental\u00a0environment\u00a0temperature\u00a0change\u00a0curve.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0time\u2010 domain\u00a0voltage\u00a0value.\u00a0\nAs\u00a0 shown\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a0 20,\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 capacitive\u00a0 sensing\u00a0noise\u00a0 spectral\u00a0density,\u00a0 the\u00a0PSD\u00a0 square\u00a0 root\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 selected\u00a0X\u2010axis\u00a0 channels\u00a0A+\u00a0and\u00a0A\u2212\u00a0 is\u00a0 shown\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0basic\u00a0 spectral\u00a0 change,\u00a0shown\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0blue\u00a0curve,\u00a0but\u00a0the\u00a0spectral\u00a0resolution\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0method\u00a0is\u00a0low,\u00a0and\u00a0 there\u00a0are\u00a0many\u00a0big\u00a0distortions.\u00a0At\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0time,\u00a0we\u00a0performed\u00a0a\u00a0power\u00a0spectral\u00a0density\u00a0 (PSD)\u00a0linear\u00a0fit\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0time\u2010domain\u00a0voltage\u00a0noise\u00a0data,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0repre\u2010 sented\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0blue\u00a0curve.\u00a0The\u00a0red\u00a0curve\u00a0is\u00a0calculated\u00a0using\u00a0Welch\u2019s\u00a0average\u00a0periodogram\u00a0 method\u00a0 [21].\u00a0The\u00a0data\u00a0were\u00a0cut\u00a0 into\u00a0overlapping\u00a0segments\u00a0of\u00a0 4 10 \u00a0 seconds\u00a0and\u00a0 fil\u2010 tered\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0Blackman\u2013Harris\u00a0window\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0minimum\u00a0of\u00a0four\u00a0samples\u00a0[22].\u00a0All\u00a0data\u00a0were\u00a0 processed\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0LISA\u00a0Technology\u00a0Package\u00a0for\u00a0Data\u00a0Analysis\u00a0(LTPDA)\u00a0toolbox\u00a0[23,24].\u00a0 Welch\u2019s\u00a0average\u00a0periodogram\u00a0method\u00a0can\u00a0reduce\u00a0random\u00a0fluctuations,\u00a0has\u00a0better\u00a0conver\u2010 gence,\u00a0and\u00a0has\u00a0more\u00a0accurate\u00a0power\u00a0spectral\u00a0density\u00a0performance.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a020.\u00a0Capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0noise.\u00a0\nAccording\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 capacitive\u00a0 sensing\u00a0 noise\u00a0 graph\u00a0 in\u00a0 Figure\u00a0 20,\u00a0 it\u00a0 is\u00a0 lower\u00a0 than\u00a0 1.095 aF/\u221aHz\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0 10 mHz\u2013 1 Hz.\u00a0This\u00a0experiment\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0ground\u00a0experiment,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0electric\u00a0box\u00a0has\u00a0not\u00a0taken\u00a0any\u00a0temperature\u2010control\u00a0measures,\u00a0so\u00a0the\u00a0frequency\u00a0band\u00a0 that\u00a0the\u00a0attention\u00a0index\u00a0meets\u00a0is\u00a0 10 mHz\u2013 1 Hz.\u00a0In\u00a0Table\u00a05,\u00a0the\u00a0research\u00a0status\u00a0of\u00a0capacitive\u00a0 sensing\u00a0at\u00a0home\u00a0and\u00a0abroad\u00a0is\u00a0compared\u00a0and\u00a0explained.\u00a0The\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0system\u00a0 developed\u00a0by\u00a0us\u00a0is\u00a0applied\u00a0to\u00a0inertial\u00a0sensors,\u00a0but\u00a0the\u00a0capacitive\u00a0sensing\u00a0system\u00a0developed\u00a0\nAs in Figure 20, in the capacitive sen ing noise sp ctral density, the PSD square root of the select d X-axis channels A+ and A\u2212 is shown by the asic spectral change, shown by the blue curve, but th spectral resolution f this method is low, and there are many big distortions.

This experiment is a ground experiment, and the electric box has not taken any temperature-control measures, so the frequency band that the attention index meets is 10 mHz\u20131 Hz. In Table 5, the research status of capacitive sensing at home and abroad is compared and explained. The capacitive sensing system developed by us is applied to inertial sensors, but the capacitive sensing system developed in reference [9], and the acceleration noise index requirement is 2\u00d7 10\u221212 ms\u22122/ \u221a Hz.This study is different from the application of the capacitive sensing system developed in reference [9]. The inertial sensor not only has the function of an accelerometer, but also includes the measurement of angular acceleration and multi-degree-of-freedom motion, so the sensitive structure of the two is different from the relevant electronic parameters (such as the amplitude Vm of the excitation signal). The capacitive induction noise in Figure 20 is the closed-loop test result of the capacitive sensing system and the sensitive structure of the inertial sensor, and the index of comparison corresponds to an acceleration noise of 3\u00d7 10\u221215 ms\u22122/ \u221a Hz. Additionally, we introduce the minimum capacitive resolution method in the capacitive sensing time domain for the first detailed analysis."

We introduce the minimum capacitive resolution method in the capacitive sensing time domain for the\nSensors 2022, 22, 9284 16 of 17\nfirst detailed analysis; the minimum capacitance resolution in the time domain is about 3 aF, which is much lower than the scientific measurement resolution of 5.8 fF required for gravitational wave detection. It is converted into capacitive sensing noise in the frequency band of 10 mHz\u20131 Hz, and the measured value is 1.095 aF/ \u221a Hz. The low-frequency noise contribution comes from temperature drift and the 1/f noise of the device. Although there is a gap between the closed-loop measurement results and the final index, the measurement environment is the experimental condition without temperature control on the ground; that is, the low-frequency test results of capacitive sensing noise still include the noise caused by temperature drift, which also shows that the use of the planar transformer-based, low-frequency, high-precision resonant capacitor bridge method can effectively suppress low-frequency 1/f noise. For the present capacitive sensing system, there is still room for improvement in the low-frequency noise performance. Subsequent related experiments will consider the temperature-control measures of the whole box. A real-time demodulationphase-monitoring system will also be investigated in the future for the next iteration of the capacitive sensing electronic system. The measurement integrity and actual measurement results of the capacitive sensing function in this paper have reached the domestic leading level in China, enabling an important technology for China\u2019s future space gravitational wave exploration.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.S., T.Y., L.W., Z.W., Y.C.
