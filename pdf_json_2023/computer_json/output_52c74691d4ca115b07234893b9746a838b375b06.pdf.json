    "abstractText": "The problem of covering the ground set of two matroids by a minimum number of common independent sets is notoriously hard even in very restricted settings, i.e. when the goal is to decide if two common independent sets suffice or not. Nevertheless, as the problem generalizes several long-standing open questions, identifying tractable cases is of particular interest. Strongly base orderable matroids form a class for which a basis-exchange condition that is much stronger than the standard axiom is met. As a result, several problems that are open for arbitrary matroids can be solved for this class. In particular, Davies and McDiarmid showed that if both matroids are strongly base orderable, then the covering number of their intersection coincides with the maximum of their covering numbers. Motivated by their result, we propose relaxations of strongly base orderability in two directions. First we weaken the basis-exchange condition, which leads to the definition of a new, complete class of matroids with distinguished algorithmic properties. Second, we introduce the notion of covering the circuits of a matroid by a graph, and consider the cases when the graph is ought to be 2-regular or a path. We give an extensive list of results explaining how the proposed relaxations compare to existing conjectures and theorems on coverings by common independent sets.",

            "text": "For basic definitions and notation of matroid theory, the interested reader is referred to [33]. Throughout the paper, we denote the ground set of a matroid M by E while the sets of independent sets, bases and circuits are denoted by I, B and C, respectively. The covering number \u03b2(M) of a matroid M is the minimum number of independent sets needed to cover its ground set. A matroid is then called k-coverable if \u03b2(M) \u2264 k. Whenever investigating the covering number, we assume the matroid to be loopless as otherwise the ground set obviously cannot be covered by independent sets. The value of \u03b2(M) can be determined using the rank formula of the union of matroids due to Edmonds and Fulkerson [17].\nIt is quite natural to consider an analogous notion for the intersection of two matroids. Given two matroids M1 and M2 on the same ground set, the covering number \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) of their intersection is the minimum number of common independent sets needed to cover the common ground set. Determining the exact value of \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) has been the center of attention for a long time since it generalizes a wide list of fundamental questions from both graph and matroid theory, including Woodall\u2019s conjecture [39] on the maximum number of pairwise disjoint dijoins\n\u2217MTA-ELTE Momentum Matroid Optimization Research Group and ELKH-ELTE Egerva\u0301ry Research Group, Department of Operations Research, Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s Lora\u0301nd University, Budapest, Hungary.

Nevertheless, apart from partial results such as Ko\u030bnig\u2019s 1-factorization theorem [27] or Edmonds\u2019 disjoint arborescences theorem [16], the problem remained open until recently, when the authors settled the complexity of the problem by showing hardness under the rank oracle model [6].\nAs determining the exact value of \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) is hard in general, the need for good lower and upper bounds arises. A lower bound is easy to give as \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) \u2265 min{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)} always holds. Nevertheless, the equality \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) = max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)} does not necessarily hold for general matroids, as shown by the well-known example where M1 is the graphic matroid of a complete graph on four vertices and M2 is the partition matroid\n1 defined by the partition of its edges into three matchings, see [35] for details. As for the upper bound, Aharoni and Berger [3] showed by using techniques from topology that \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) \u2264 2 max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)}. Furthermore, they verified the slightly stronger statement that \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 \u03b2(M1) + \u03b2(M2) holds whenever one of \u03b2(M1) and \u03b2(M2) divides the other. Nevertheless, no example is known for which the true value would be close to the upper bound. In fact, Aharoni and Berger [4] conjectured the following, originally attributed to [3].\nConjecture 1. (Aharoni and Berger) Let M1 and M2 be matroids on the same ground set.\n(1) If \u03b2(M1) 6= \u03b2(M2), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) = max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)}. (2) If \u03b2(M1) = \u03b2(M2), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)}+ 1.\nThe conjecture was verified only for \u03b2(M1) = \u03b2(M2) = 2 by Aharoni, Berger and Ziv [4]. In the same paper, the authors also showed that if \u03b2(M1) = 2 and \u03b2(M2) = 3, then \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) \u2264 4 holds. For \u03b2(M1) = 2 and \u03b2(M2) = k \u2265 4, the current best bound follows from the result of Aharoni and Berger [3] mentioned above: \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) \u2264 k+2 if k is even, and \u03b2(M1\u2229M2) \u2264 k+3 if k is odd.\nAmong the results related to Conjecture 1, the probably most important one is due to Davies and McDiarmid [14], who studied the class of strongly base orderable matroids. A matroid is called strongly base orderable if\n(SBO) for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a bijection \u03d5 : A \\ B \u2192 B \\ A such that (A \\X) \u222a \u03d5(X) is a basis for every X \u2286 A \\B.\nIt is worth mentioning that this implies (B \u222a X) \\ \u03d5(X) being a basis as well. Strongly base orderable matroids are interesting and important because we have a fairly good global understanding of their structure, while frustratingly little is known about the general case. In particular, Davies and McDiarmid showed that the covering number of the intersection of two strongly base orderable matroids coincides with the obvious lower bound.\nTheorem 1. (Davies and McDiarmid) Let M1 and M2 be strongly base orderable matroids on the same ground set. Then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) = max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)}.\nAs many matroid classes that naturally appear in combinatorial and graph optimization problems, e.g. gammoids, are strongly base orderable, Theorem 1 was a milestone result in the research on packing common independent sets. Recently, the theorem received a renewed interest when Abdi, Cornue\u0301jols and Zlatin [1] successfully attacked special cases of Woodall\u2019s conjecture with its help. However, there are basic matroid classes that do not satisfy strongly base orderability, e.g. graphic or paving matroids.\n1All partition matroids considered in the paper have all-ones upper bounds on the partition classes without explicitly mentioning it.\nOur contribution. Our research was motivated by the following question: can strongly base orderability in Theorem 1 replaced with some weaker assumption so that the statement remains true? Or more generally, can we verify Conjecture 1 for some reasonably broad class of matroids? As partial answers to these problems, we propose two relaxations of strongly base orderability that weaken the original definition in different aspects.\nFirst, in Section 2 we omit the condition for the bijection to go between A\\B and B\\A, and allow repartitioning the multiset A\u222aB into two new bases A\u2032 and B\u2032 satisfying A\u2032\u2229B\u2032 = A\u2229B and A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 = A \u222aB. We show that matroids satisfying the relaxed condition form a complete class. We also prove that Theorem 1 remains true when both matroids are from the proposed class, and thus we identify new scenarios when packing problems are tractable. Finally, we explain how the new class fits in the hierarchy of existing matroid classes.\nSecond, in Section 3 we relax the condition of finding a bijection between A \\B and B \\A. Instead, we seek for a graph whose vertex set coincides with the symmetric difference of the bases, and the graph represents the matroid locally in the sense that every stable set in it corresponds to an independent set of the original matroid. In particular, we prove that the the graph in question can be chosen to be a path for graphic matroids, paving matroids, and spikes. We conjecture that an analogous statement hold for arbitrary matroids, and discuss a series of corollaries that would follows from such a result."

            "text": "When considering the extendability of Theorem 1 to a broader class of matroids, some natural candidates are immediate. For subsets X,Y \u2286 E, their symmetric difference is defined as X4Y := (X \\ Y ) \u222a (Y \\X). When Y consist of a single element y, then X \\ {y} and X \u222a {y} are abbreviated as X \u2212 y and X + y, respectively. A matroid is called base orderable if\n(BO) for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a bijection \u03d5 : A \\ B \u2192 B \\ A such that A\u2212 x+ \u03d5(x) and B + x\u2212 \u03d5(x) are bases for every x \u2208 A \\B.\nClearly, strongly base orderable matroids are also base orderable since the bijection appearing in (SBO) satisfies (BO) as well. It is known that M(K4), the graphic matroid of a complete graph on four vertices is a forbidden minor for base orderability. Hence every base orderable matroid is contained in the class Ex(M(K4)) of M(K4)-minor-free matroids. In fact, these inclusions are known to be strict, hence SBO ( BO ( Ex(M(K4)) hold.\nDavies and McDiarmid [14] posed the problem of whether Theorem 1 remains true if strongly base orderability is replaced with the weaker assumption that both matroids are base orderable. Though this specific question remains open, the following example shows that both matroids being in Ex(M(K4)) does not suffice. The examples uses J , a self-dual rank-4 matroid introduced by Oxley [34].\nRemark 2. We show that there exists a partition matroid M for which \u03b2(J) = \u03b2(M) = 2 and \u03b2(J \u2229M) = 3. Consider the geometric representation of the matroid J on Figure 1; for the definition, see also [33, page 650]. Let M be the partition matroid defined by partition classes {a, h}, {b, g}, {c, e}, {d, f}, implying \u03b2(J) = \u03b2(M) = 2.\nTo see that \u03b2(J \u2229M) > 2, suppose to the contrary that E = B1\u222aB2 is a decomposition into two common bases of J and M . Without loss of generality, we may assume that h \u2208 B1. As B1 is a common basis, it contains exactly one element from each of the pairs {b, g}, {c, e}, {d, f} and at most one element from each of the pairs {b, c}, {d, g}, {e, f}, hence B1 = {b, d, e, h} or B1 = {c, f, g, h}. In either case, B2 is not a basis of J , a contradiction. Therefore \u03b2(J \u2229M) > 2, and so \u03b2(J \u2229M) = 3 by the result of Aharoni, Berger and Ziv mentioned earlier.\nMotivated by the proof of Theorem 1, we call a matroid strongly base reorderable (or SBRO for short) if\n(SBRO) for any pair A,B of bases, there exists bases A\u2032, B\u2032 and a bijection \u03d5 : A\u2032 \\B\u2032 \u2192 B\u2032 \\A\u2032 such that A\u2032 \u2229B\u2032 = A \u2229B, A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 = A \u222aB, and (A\u2032 \\X) \u222a \u03d5(X) is a basis for every X \u2286 A\u2032 \\B\u2032.\nIn other words, (SBRO) differs from (SBO) in that it allows the repartitioning of the multiunion of the bases before asking for the bijection \u03d5. It immediately follows from the definition that strongly base orderable matroids are strongly base reorderable as well."

            "text": "Ingleton [25] defined a class of matroids to be complete if it is closed under taking minors, duals, direct sums, truncations and induction by directed graphs. A complete class is also closed under many other matroid operations, such as series and parallel connections, 2-sums, unions and principal extensions, see e.g. [11]. It was already noted by Ingleton [25] that the classes of base orderable and strongly base orderable matroids are complete, while Sims [36] verified that Ex(M(K4)) is complete as well.\nA k-exchange-ordering for a pair A,B of bases is a bijection \u03d5 : A \\B \u2192 B \\A such that both (A \\X) \u222a \u03d5(X) and (B \\ \u03d5(X)) \u222aX are bases for each subset X \u2286 A \\ B with |X| \u2264 k. A matroid is called k-base-orderable if each pair of its bases has a k-exchange-ordering. Note that k-base-orderability corresponds to base orderability for k = 1 and to strongly base orderability if k is the rank of the matroid. Bonin and Savitsky [11] showed that the class of k-base-orderable matroids is complete for any fixed k \u2265 1. Relying on their proof, we verify that the class SBRO of strongly base reorderable matroids is complete as well. Following the notation of [33], the contraction and deletion of a set X in a matroid M are denoted by M/X and M\\X, respectively.\nTheorem 3. SBRO is a complete class.\nProof. Bonin and Savitsky [11] verified that a class of matroids is complete if it is closed under taking minors, duals, direct sums and principal extensions into flats. For a flat F of a matroid M over ground set E and an element e not in E, the principal extension M +F e is a matroid\non ground set E + e with family of bases\n{B + e\u2212 f | B is a basis of M , f \u2208 (B \u2229 F ) + e}.\nThe following statement was implicitly showed in [11] in the proof that the class of k-baseorderable matroids is closed under principal extensions.\nLemma 4. Let k be a positive integer, F be a flat of a matroid M over ground set E, and e be an element not in E. If \u03d50 is a k-exchange-ordering for bases A0 and B0 of M , then for each x \u2208 (A0 \u2229 F ) + e and y \u2208 (B0 \u2229 F ) + e, there exists a k-exchange-ordering for bases A0 + e\u2212 x and B0 + e\u2212 y of M +F e.\nWe prove Theorem 3 by showing that SBRO is closed under taking direct sums, duals, minors and principal extensions. Closedness under taking direct sums is straightforward to verify.\nTo prove closedness under taking duals, let A\u2217 and B\u2217 be bases of the dual M\u2217 of an SBRO matroid M . Since A := E \\A\u2217 and B := E \\B\u2217 are bases of M , there exist bases A\u2032, B\u2032 and a bijection \u03d5 : A\u2032 \\B\u2032 \u2192 B\u2032 \\A\u2032 such that A\u2032 \u2229B\u2032 = A\u2229B, A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 = A\u222aB, and (A\u2032 \\X)\u222a\u03d5(X) is a basis of M for every X \u2286 A\u2032 \\ B\u2032. Then A\u2032\u2217 := E \\ A\u2032 and B\u2032\u2217 := E \\ B\u2032 are bases of M\u2217 such that A\u2032\u2217\u2229B\u2032\u2217 = A\u2217\u2229B\u2217, A\u2032\u2217\u222aB\u2032\u2217 = A\u222aB, and \u03d5\u22121 is a bijection from B\u2032 \\A\u2032 = A\u2032\u2217 \\B\u2032\u2217 to A\u2032 \\ B\u2032 = B\u2032\u2217 \\ A\u2032\u2217 such that for every Y \u2286 B\u2032 \\ A\u2032 the set (A\u2032\u2217 \\ Y ) \u222a \u03d5\u22121(Y ) is a basis of M since E \\ ( (A\u2032\u2217 \\ Y ) \u222a \u03d5\u22121(Y ) ) = (A\u2032 \u222a Y ) \\\u03d5\u22121(Y ) = (A\u2032 \\\u03d5\u22121(Y ))\u222a\u03d5 ( \u03d5\u22121(Y ) ) is a basis\nof M . Next we show closedness under taking minors. Observe that the matroid M\\x obtained\nfrom an SBRO matroid M by deleting an element x is SBRO. This follows from the fact that if x is not a coloop of M , then each basis of M\\x is a basis of M , while if x is a coloop of M , then B + x is a basis of M for every basis B of M\\x. As we have already seen that SBRO is closed under taking duals, it follows that the contraction M/x = (M\u2217\\x)\u2217 is SBRO as well.\nFinally, we show closedness under principal extensions. Let F be a flat of an SBRO matroid M , and consider a pair A,B of bases of M +F e. By the definition of the principal extension there exist x \u2208 F \u2229A+ e and y \u2208 F \u2229B + e such that A+ x\u2212 e and B + y\u2212 e are bases of M . Since M is SBRO, there exist a pair A0, B0 and a bijection \u03d50 : A0 \\ B0 \u2192 B0 \\ A0 such that A0 \u2229B0 = (A+x\u2212 e)\u2229 (B+ y\u2212 e), A0 \u222aB0 = (A+x\u2212 e)\u222a (B+ y\u2212 e) and (A0 \\X)\u222a\u03d5(X) is a basis of M for every X \u2286 A0 \\B0. Since \u03d50 is a k-exchange ordering for k being the rank of M , there exists a k-exchange ordering \u03d5 for the bases of A\u2032 := A0 + e\u2212 x and B\u2032 := B0 + e\u2212 y of M +F e by Lemma 4. As A\n\u2032 \u2229B\u2032 = A\u2229B and A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 = A\u222aB hold, the pair A\u2032, B\u2032 and the bijection \u03d5 satisfies the requirements of (SBRO).\nWith the help of Theorem 3, we are ready to prove the next theorem which shows the importance of the proposed class. Though the proof is analogous to that of Theorem 1 appearing in [35, Theorem 42.13], we include it to make the paper self-contained.\nTheorem 5. Let M1 and M2 be strongly base reorderable matroids on the same ground set. Then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) = max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)}.\nProof. Let k = max{\u03b2(M1), \u03b2(M2)} and r = max{r(M1), r(M2)}. We may assume that the common ground set E of the matroids decomposes into k disjoint bases in each of the matroids M1 and M2. Indeed, for i = 1, 2, consider the matroid M \u2032 i obtained as the r-truncation of the direct sum of Mi and the free matroid on k \u00b7 r\u2212 |E| elements. Then M \u2032i is SBRO by Theorem 3 and its ground set decomposes into k disjoint bases for i = 1, 2, and \u03b2(M \u20321 \u2229M \u20322) = \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) holds as well.\nLet X = {X1, . . . , Xk} and Y = {Y1, . . . , Yk} be partitions of E into bases of M1 and M2, respectively, such that \u2211k i=1 |Xi\u2229Yi| is as large as possible. If it has value |E|, then X = Y is a decomposition of E into k common bases of M1 and M2. Otherwise, there exist distinct indices i and j such that Xi \u2229 Yj 6= \u2205. Let X \u2032i and X \u2032j be bases of M1 and \u03d51 : X \u2032i \u2192 X \u2032j be a bijection guaranteed by (SBRO) for the disjoint bases Xi and Xj of M1. Similarly, let Y \u2032 i and Y \u2032 j be bases of M2 and \u03d52 : Y \u2032 i \u2192 Y \u2032j be a bijection guaranteed by (SBRO) for the disjoint bases Yi and Yj of M2. Consider the graph G on Xi\u222aXj\u222aYi\u222aYj with edge set {e\u03d51(e) | e \u2208 X \u2032i}\u222a{e\u03d52(e) | e \u2208 Y \u2032i }. Since G is the union of two matchings, it is bipartite. Let S and T denote the color classes of a 2-coloring of the vertices of G. As (X \u2032i \\ Z) \u222a \u03d51(Z) is a basis of M1 for every Z \u2286 X \u2032i and (Y \u2032i \\Z)\u222a\u03d52(Z) is a basis of M2 for every Z \u2286 Y \u2032i , X \u2032\u2032i := S\u2229 (Xi\u222aXj) and X \u2032\u2032j := T \u2229 (Xi\u222aXj) are bases of M1, while Y \u2032\u2032 i := S \u2229 (Yi \u222a Yj) and Y \u2032\u2032j := T \u2229 (Yi \u222a Yj) are bases of M2. Consider the partition X \u2032 obtained from X by replacing Xi and Xj by X \u2032\u2032i and X \u2032\u2032j , respectively, and the partition Y \u2032 obtained from Y by replacing Yi and Yj by Y \u2032\u2032i and Y \u2032\u2032j , respectively. Then |X \u2032\u2032i \u2229Y \u2032\u2032i |+ |X \u2032\u2032j \u2229Y \u2032\u2032j | = |(Xi\u222aXj)\u2229(Yi\u222aYj)| > |Xi\u2229Yi|+ |Xj \u2229Yj |, hence X \u2032 and Y\u2019 contradict the maximality of \u2211k i=1 |Xi \u2229 Yi|."

            "text": "In general, knowing the excluded minors for a minor-closed matroid class provides a powerful tool that then can be used in various applications. Based on the characterization of M(K4)minor-free binary matroids by Brylawski [12] and of M(K4)-minor-free ternary matroids by Oxley [34], we give a characterization of binary and of ternary SBRO matroids. For the latter we will use that the matroid S(5, 6, 12) is SBRO. The Steiner system S(5, 6, 12) is a family of 6-element subsets of a 12-element ground set such that each 5-element subset of the ground set is contained in exactly one member of the family. By slight abuse of notation, the matroid whose family of hyperplanes is identical with such a system is denoted by S(5, 6, 12) as well.\nLemma 6. S(5, 6, 12) is SBRO.\nProof. As a preparation for the proof, we discuss representations of some minors of S(5, 6, 12) over the field GF (3). We denote the columns of an r \u00d7 n matrix A by a1, . . . , an, and the matroid represented by A over the field GF (3) by M [A]. All the computations of the proof are meant over the field GF (3).\nOxley [34] (see also [33, page 658]) gives the following GF (3)-representation of S(5, 6, 12):\nS := \n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 \u22121 1 0 1 \u22121 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0\n .\nA matrix T representing the matroid M [S]/s6\\s12 can be obtained by deleting the 6th and 12th columns and the 6th row of S (see [33, Proposition 3.2.6]):\nT :=  1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u22121 \u22121 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 \u22121 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u22121 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0  .\nHowever, it will be more convenient to work with the following matrix:\nT \u2032 :=  1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 \u22121 0 \u22121 1 0 0 0 0 1 \u22121 1 \u22121 0 1  .\nThe matroids M [T ] and M [T \u2032] are isomorphic. Indeed, multiplying T by any 5 \u00d7 5 invertible matrix from the left does not change M [T ]. In particular, the matroid represented by[\nt\u20324 t \u2032 2 t \u2032 1 t \u2032 3 t \u2032 6\n] \u00b7 T = [ t\u20324 t \u2032 2 t \u2032 1 t \u2032 3 t \u2032 6 \u2212t\u20327 t\u20325 \u2212t\u20328 \u2212t\u203210 \u2212t\u20329 ] is M [T ], while it is isomorphic to M [T \u2032]. Finally, it is not difficult to check that M [T \u2032]/t\u20325\\t\u203210 is represented by\nP :=  1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0 1 0 \u22121 0 1 \u22121 0 0 0 1 1 \u22121 0 \u22121  . Besides these matrix representations, we rely on several properties of the matroid S(5, 6, 12) from [33, page 658].\nWe turn to the proof of the lemma, that is, we show that (SBRO) holds for S(5, 6, 12). This property is equivalent to the following: for each pair A,B of bases of M [S] there exists a pair A\u2032, B\u2032 of disjoint bases of the matroid N := M/(A \u2229 B)\\(E \\ (A \u2229 B)), and a bijection \u03d5 : A\u2032 \u2192 B\u2032 such that (A\u2032 \\X) \u222a \u03d5(X) is a basis of N for every X \u2286 A. We distinguish several cases based on the size of A \u2229B.\nIf |A\u2229B| \u2265 3, then N has rank at most three. In this case N is strongly base orderable, as S(5, 6, 12) contains M(K4) as a minor, and M(K4)-minor-free matroids of rank at most three are strongly base orderable.\nIf |A \u2229 B| = 2, then we use the fact that the matroid obtained from S(5, 6, 12) by deleting two elements and contracting two elements is unique up to isomorphism2, which follows from the automorphism group of S(5, 6, 12) being 5-transitive. Therefore, N is isomorphic to M [P ]. Setting A1 := {p1, p2, p3, p4}, B1 := {p5, p6, p7, p8} and \u03d51 : A1 \u2192 B1, \u03d51(pi) = pi+4 for i = 1, . . . , 4, it is not difficult to check that (A1 \\X) \u222a \u03d51(X) is a basis of M [P ] for every X \u2286 A1.\nIf |A\u2229B| = 1, then N is isomorphic to M [T \u2032] by a similar reasoning as in the previous case. Let A2 := {t\u20321, . . . , t\u20325}, B2 := {t\u20326, . . . , t\u203210} and \u03d52 : A2 \u2192 B2, \u03d52(t\u2032i) = t\u2032i+5 for i = 1, . . . , 5. We claim that (A2 \\X) \u222a \u03d52(X) is a basis of M [T \u2032] for every X \u2286 A2. If t\u20325 6\u2208 X, then this follows from ((A2\u2212 t\u20325) \\Z)\u222a\u03d52(Z) being a basis of M [T \u2032]/t\u20325\\t\u203210 for every Z \u2286 A2\u2212 t\u20325, which we have already seen in the previous case. If t\u20325 \u2208 X, then we need to show that ((A2 \u2212 t\u20325) \\Z)\u222a\u03d52(Z) is a basis of M [T \u2032]/t\u203210\\t\u20325 for every Z \u2286 A\u2032\u2212 t\u20325. We obtain the following matrix P \u2032 representing M [T \u2032]/t\u203210\\t\u20325 from T \u2032 by pivoting on the 10th element of the 5th row, deleting the 5th and 10th columns and deleting the 5th row:\nP \u2032 :=  1 0 0 0 \u22121 0 \u22121 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 0 0 0 1 \u22121 1 1 \u22121  . 2Note that the matroid in question is the matroid denoted by P8 in [33].\nWe need to show that for A3 := {p\u20321, p\u20322, p\u20323, p\u20324}, B3 := {p\u20325, p\u20326, p\u20327, p\u20328} and \u03d53 : A3 \u2192 B3, \u03d53(p\u2032i) = \u03d53(p\n\u2032 i+4) for i = 1, . . . , 4, the set (A3 \\ Z) \u222a \u03d53(Z) is a basis of M [P \u2032] for every Z \u2286 A3. As[ p5 p6 p3 \u2212p8 ] \u00b7 P \u2032 = [ p5 p6 p3 \u2212p8 p1 p2 p7 \u2212p4 ] represents the same matroid as P \u2032, the function f : (p\u20321, . . . , p \u2032 8) 7\u2192 (p5, p6, p3, p8, p1, p2, p7, p4) is an isomorphism from M [P \u2032] to M [P ]. Since f({p\u2032i, p\u2032i+4}) = {pi, pi+4} for i = 1, . . . , 4, f maps the family {(A3 \\ Z) \u222a \u03d53(Z) | Z \u2286 A3} to {(A1 \\X) \u222a \u03d51(X) | X \u2286 A1}. As we have already seen that each member of the latter family is a basis of M [P ], it follows that each set of the form (A3 \\ Z) \u222a \u03d53(Z) is a basis of M [P \u2032].\nFinally, consider the case A \u2229B = \u2205. As the matroids M [S]/s6\\s12 = M [T ] and M [T \u2032] are isomorphic, there exists a pair A4, B4 and a bijection \u03d54 : A4 \u2192 B4 such that (A4 \\X)\u222a\u03d54(X) is a basis of M [S]/s6\\s12 for every X \u2286 A4. Extend \u03d54 to a bijection \u03d5\u03024 : A4 + s6 \u2192 B4 + s12 by letting \u03d5\u03024(s6) = s12. We claim that ((A4 + s6) \\ X) \u222a \u03d5\u03024(X) is a basis of M [S] for every X \u2286 A4 + s6. If s6 6\u2208 X, this follows from (A4 \\ X) \u222a \u03d54(X) being a basis of M [S]/s6\\s12. If s6 \u2208 X, then we use that (X \u2212 s6) \u222a \u03d54((A4 + s6) \\ X) is a basis of M [S]/s6\\s12, hence X \u222a\u03d54((A4 + s6) \\X) is a basis of M [S]. This implies its complement ((A4 + s6) \\X)\u222a\u03d54(X) being a basis as well, since M [S] is known to be identically self-dual.\nTheorem 7. The matroids M(K4) and J are excluded minors for SBRO. Furthermore,\n(a) a binary matroid is SBRO if and only if it does not contain M(K4) as a minor, and\n(b) a ternary matroid is SBRO if and only if it does not contain M(K4) or J as a minor.\nProof. First we show that neither M(K4) nor J is SBRO. This follows from Theorem 5 as each M1 \u2208 {M(K4), J} is 2-coverable and there exists a 2-coverable partition matroid M2 on the same ground set such that \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) = 3. Indeed, for M1 = M(K4), let the three partition classes defining M2 be the matchings of size two of K4, see [35]. For M1 = J , the statement follows by Remark 2.\nM(K4)-minor-free binary matroids are SBRO, as they coincide with the graphic matroids of series-parallel graphs [12] which are strongly base orderable, see also [37]. As M(K4) is not SBRO, it follows that M(K4) is the unique binary excluded minor for SBRO.\nFinally, we show that if M is a ternary excluded minor of SBRO distinct from M(K4), then M is isomorphic to J . As SBRO is closed under direct sums and 2-sums by Theorem 3, it follows that M is 3-connected. Oxley [34] showed that a 3-connected M(K4)-minor-free ternary matroid is isomorphic either to the rank-r whirl Wr for some r \u2265 2, to J , or to a minor of the matroid S(5, 6, 12). Since Wr is a transversal matroid, it is strongly base orderable. By Lemma 6, S(5, 6, 12) is SBRO. Therefore, M is isomorphic to J . As J is not SBRO and does not contain M(K4) as a minor, it follows that J is the unique ternary excluded minor for SBRO apart from M(K4).\nAs M(K4) is the only binary, and M(K4) and J are the only ternary excluded minors for base orderability [34], Theorem 7 immediately implies the following.\nCorollary 8. A binary or ternary matroid is SBRO if and only if it is base orderable.\nConsider a matroid M = (E, C) on ground set E with set of circuits C. Furthermore, assume that G = (E,F ) is a graph with vertex set E and edge set F . For a subset X \u2286 E, let C[X] denote the set of circuits of M that lie in X, that is, C[X] := {C \u2208 C | C \u2286 X}, and let F [X] denote the set of edges of G induced by X. We say that G covers a subset C\u2032 \u2286 C of circuits if F [C] 6= \u2205 for every C \u2208 C\u2032. In other words, every stable subset of E in G is such that it contains no circuit from C\u2032.\nLet us now return to the open problem of Davies and McDiarmid on replacing strongly base orderability with base orderability in Theorem 1. Theorem 5 and Corollary 8 together imply an affirmative answer in the special case when the matroids are ternary \u2013 for binary matroids, this was already known as the classes of base orderable binary matroids and strongly base orderable binary matroids coincide. Motivated by this observation, it is natural to ask whether all base orderable matroids are SBRO. Unfortunately, the next example shows that this is not the case.\nRemark 9. We construct a rank-5 matroid X10 on 10 elements that is base orderable but not SBRO. Recall the construction of the the binary affine cube AG(3, 2) from [33, page 645] using faces, diagonal planes and twisted planes, see Figure 2. We define X10 on the ground set {1, 2, . . . , 8} \u222a {a, b} such that each set of size four is independent, and the family of dependent sets of size five is\nH := {F \u222a {a} | F is a face} \u222a {F \u222a {b} | F is a diagonal plane or a twisted plane} .\nBy the construction of paving matroids, see e.g. [21, Theorem 5.3.5], X10 is a paving matroid of rank 5 as |H1 \u2229H2| \u2264 3 for each H1, H2 \u2208 H, H1 6= H2. It is not difficult to check that X10 does not contain M(K4) as a minor, hence it is base orderable since M(K4)-minor-free paving matroids are base orderable [11].\nIt remains to show that X10 is not SBRO. Assume for contradiction that X10 is SBRO and consider a pair A,B of disjoint bases, e.g. A = {1, 2, 3, 5, a} and B = {4, 6, 7, 8, b}. By (SBRO), there exists a pair A\u2032, B\u2032 of disjoint bases and a bijection \u03d5 : A\u2032 \u2192 B\u2032 such that (A\u2032 \\X)\u222a\u03d5(X) is a basis for X \u2286 A\u2032, or equivalently, P := {e\u03d5(e) | e \u2208 A\u2032} covers each circuit of X10. Then we define a bijection \u03d5\u0302 : A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 \u2192 A\u2032 \u222aB\u2032 by setting \u03d5\u0302(z) := \u03d5(z) if z \u2208 A\u2032 and \u03d5\u22121(z) otherwise.\nSince P covers both {1, 3, 6, 8, b} and {2, 4, 5, 7, b}, at least one of the twisted planes {1, 3, 6, 8} and {2, 4, 5, 7} contains an edge of P . We may assume by symmetry that 13 \u2208 P . Consider the case first when \u03d5\u0302(5) \u2208 {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}. Observe that P \u2032 := P \\ {13, 5\u03d5\u0302(5)} covers each member of the family\nH\u2032 := {H \\ {1, 3, 5, \u03d5\u0302(5)} | H \u2032 \u2208 H, |H \u2032 \u2229 {1, 3}| = |H \u2032 \u2229 {5, \u03d5\u0302(5)}| = 1}.\nWe claim that H\u2032 is the family of circuits of a matroid isomorphic to M(K4). Indeed,\nH\u2032 =  {{4, 8, a}, {4, 6, b}, {6, 7, a}, {7, 8, b}} if \u03d5\u0302(5) = 2, {{2, 7, a}, {2, 8, b}, {4, 7, b}, {4, 8, a}} if \u03d5\u0302(5) = 6, {{2, 6, a}, {2, 8, b}, {4, 6, b}, {4, 8, a}} if \u03d5\u0302(5) = 7,\nand the cases \u03d5\u0302(5) = 4 and \u03d5\u0302(5) = 8 are symmetric to the cases \u03d5\u0302(5) = 2 and \u03d5\u0302(5) = 6, respectively. This is a contradiction as the circuits of M(K4) cannot be covered by a matching.\nWe proved that \u03d5\u0302(5) \u2208 {a, b} and thus by symmetry \u03d5\u0302(7) \u2208 {a, b} holds as well. We may assume that \u03d5\u0302(5) = a and \u03d5\u0302(7) = b. Since P covers each of {3, 4, 7, 8, a}, {2, 3, 6, 7, a}, {3, 4, 5, 6, b} and {2, 3, 5, 8, b}, the two edges of P \\{13, 5a, 7b} cover each of {4, 8}, {2, 6}, {4, 6} and {2, 8} which is not possible, leading to a contradiction.\nFigure 3 summarizes the relation of the matroid classes discussed in the current section. Here M\u03b1 denotes the matroid described in [11, Section 8] with parameters r = 5, |A| = |D| = 1, and |B| = |C| = |E| = |F | = 2. That is, let A = {a}, B = {b1, b2}, C = {c1, c2}, D = {d}, E = {e1, e2}, and F = {f1, f2}. Then the proper nonempty cyclic flats of M\u03b1 are C\u222aB\u222aE, C\u222aA\u222aD, F \u222aE\u222aA and F \u222aD\u222aB with ranks r(C\u222aB\u222aE) = |C|+ |B| = 4, r(C\u222aA\u222aD) = |C|+ |A| = 3, r(F \u222a E \u222a A) = |F | + |E| = 4, and r(F \u222aD \u222a B) = |F | + |D| = 3. Let X and Y be arbitrary bases of M\u03b1. It was shown in [11] that M\u03b1 is a forbidden minor for strongly base orderability, hence if X\u2229Y 6= \u2205 then even (SBO) holds for the pair X,Y . On the other hand, if X and Y are disjoint, then it is not difficult to check that the bijection \u03d5 : (a, b1, c1, e1, f1) 7\u2192 (d, b2, c2, e2, f2) satisfies (SBRO)."

            "text": "In this section, we propose another relaxation of strongly base orderability. In order to do so, first we give a new interpretation of property (SBO). Recall that for a matroid M = (E, C), a graph G = (E,F ) is said to cover C\u2032 \u2286 C if F [C] 6= \u2205 for every C \u2208 C\u2032. Using this terminology, (SBO) is equivalent to saying that for any pair A,B of bases of a strongly base orderable matroid M = (E, C), there exists a graph G consisting of a matching between the elements of A \\ B and B \\ A that covers C[A \u222a B]. Similarly, property (SBRO) discussed in Section 2 translates into the existence of a matching on A4B that covers C[A \u222a B]. Observe the small but crucial difference between the two definitions: while the former asks for matching edges going between the elements of A and B, the latter allows the end vertices of any matching edge to fall in the same set, i.e. A or B.\nWe conjecture that a similar statement holds for arbitrary matroids where G is a 2-regular graph or a path instead of a matching, where a graph is 2-regular if each vertex has degree exactly two. More precisely, we propose four relaxations of different strengths, and say that a matroid M = (E, C) has property\n(R) if for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a 2-regular graph on A4B that covers C[A\u222aB],\n(R+) if for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a 2-regular graph that consists of cycles alternating between A \\B and B \\A and covers C[A \u222aB] ,\n(P) if for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a path on A4B that covers C[A \u222aB], (P+) if for any pair A,B of bases, there exists a path that alternates between A \\ B and B \\A and covers C[A \u222aB]. In all cases, the condition that the graph in question covers C[A \u222aB] is equivalent to requiring that the union of A \u2229B and any stable set of A4B in the graph is independent in M .\nSince any path can be extended to a single cycle by adding an edge between its end vertices, property (P+) implies all the others, while property (R) is a special case of any of them. As for properties (R+) and (P), we could not show any connection between them. As a matching between A\\B and B \\A can always be extended to an alternating path between them, strongly base orderable matroids satisfy (P+), and an analogous reasoning shows that SBRO matroids satisfy (P)."

At this point, it is not even clear why those circuits could be covered by a small number of graph edges. As a first step towards understanding the general case, instead of covering every circuit, we concentrate on covering fundamental circuits only. Given a basis B of a matroid and an element a outside of B, we denote by CB(a) the fundamental circuit of a with respect to B, that is, the unique circuit in B+a. We extend this notation to sets as well, that is, for a set X disjoint from B we use CB(X) := {CB(x) | x \u2208 X}. Theorem 10.

Therefore the graph consisting of edges {a\u03d5A(a) | a \u2208 A \\B} \u222a {b\u03d5B(b) | b \u2208 B \\A} is a 2-regular graph that covers CA(B) \u222a CB(A), proving (a).\nBy the symmetric exchange axiom, there exists a mapping \u2013 not necessarily a bijection \u2013 \u03c6A : A\\B \u2192 B \\A such that both A\u2212a+\u03c6A(a) and B+a\u2212\u03c6A(a) are bases for each a \u2208 A\\B, or equivalently, the edge a\u03c6A(a) covers both CA(\u03c6A(a)) and CB(a).

As extending the forest to a tree by adding edges connecting the components maintains this property, (b) follows.\nTheorem 10 shows that the fundamental circuits corresponding to the basis pair can be covered by a 2-regular graph. However, the same question remains open when the graph is required to be a path, and this seemingly simple task already appears to be highly non-trivial. The essence of part (b) of the theorem is that, instead of a path, the covering can always be realized by a tree."

            "text": "We could not identify any matroid for which (P+) would fail, hence we propose the following, probably overly optimistic conjecture.\nConjecture 2. Let A,B be bases of a matroid M . Then there exists a path that alternates between A \\B and B \\A and covers C[A \u222aB].\nTo validate the conjecture somewhat, we show that the statement holds for graphic matroids, paving matroids, and spikes. We start with a technical lemma.\nLemma 11. Let M be a minor-closed class of matroids and (X) \u2208 {(R), (R+), (P ), (P+)}. To verify that (X) holds for each M \u2208 M, it suffices to show that the property holds when the ground set is the disjoint union of A and B.\nProof. Let A and B be bases of the matroid M = (E, C) where M \u2208 M. If A \u2229 B 6= \u2205 or A \u222a B 6= E, then define A\u2032 := A \\ B, B\u2032 := B \\ A, E\u2032 := A\u2032 \u222a B\u2032, and let M \u2032 = (E\u2032, C\u2032) denote the matroid obtained from M by deleting E \\ (A \u222a B) and contracting A \u2229 B. Note that A\u2032 and B\u2032 are disjoint bases of M \u2032 whose union is E\u2032. Furthermore, for any circuit C \u2208 C[A \u222aB], there exists a circuit C \u2032 \u2208 C\u2032[A\u2032 \u222a B\u2032] such that C \u2032 \u2286 C. Therefore, any graph proving (X) for the pair A\u2032, B\u2032 in M \u2032 also proves (X) for the pair A,B in M .\nWith the help of Lemma 11, we first verify the graphic case. It may be confusing that (P+) states the existence of a certain path and we are working with graphs, so let us emphasize that the path is defined on the elements of the ground set, i.e. the edges of the underlying graph, and it does not appear in the graph itself in any sense.\nTheorem 12. Graphic matroids have property (P+).\nProof. Let G = (V,E) be a graph with graphic matroid M(G). We prove the theorem by induction on |E|. Note that (P+) clearly holds when E = \u2205. Take a pair of bases A,B. As the class of graphic matroids is closed under taking minors, Lemma 11 applies, hence we may assume that E is the disjoint union of A and B. Furthermore, we may assume that G is connected as otherwise we can pick a vertex in each connected component and identify those, thus obtaining a connected graph with the same graphic matroid as the original one.\nBy the above, we have |E| = |A| + |B| = 2(|V | \u2212 1), hence G has a vertex v of degree at most three. If v has degree two, then G has an edge a \u2208 A and an edge b \u2208 B incident to v. Since G\u2032 := G\u2212 v is the union of disjoint spanning trees A\u2212a and B\u2212 b, there exists a path P \u2032 covering the circuits of M(G\u2032) by the induction hypothesis. As every cycle of G passing through v uses the edges a and b, adding an extra edge to P \u2032 \u222a {ab} between a and the endpoint of P \u2032 in B results in an alternating path between A and B covering the circuits of M(G).\nIf v has degree three, then we may assume that edges a1, a2 \u2208 A and b \u2208 B are incident to v. Consider the graph G\u2032 obtained by contracting a2 and deleting b, let A\n\u2032 denote the spanning tree of G\u2032 obtained from A by contracting a2, and define B\n\u2032 := B \u2212 b. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a path P \u2032 alternating between A\u2032 and B\u2032 that covers the circuits of M(G\u2032). Let c be a neighbour of a1 in P\n\u2032 and consider the path P := (P \u2032 \u2212 a1c) \u222a {a1b, ba2, a2c}. We claim that P covers every circuit C of M(G). If C corresponds to a cycle of G that does not pass through v, then it is also a circuit of M(G\u2032), and therefore it is covered by P \u2032 \u2212 a1c. If b \u2208 C, then either a1 \u2208 C or a2 \u2208 C, hence C is covered either by a1b or ba2. The only remaining case is when a1, a2 \u2208 C. Let C \u2032 denote the cycle of G\u2032 obtained by contracting a2 in C. Then C \u2032 is covered by an edge of P \u2032. If c 6\u2208 C, then this is an edge of P \u2032 \u2212 a1c as well, otherwise C is covered by the edge a2c. This proves that P covers all circuits of M(G).\nRemark 13. The fact that the path in (P+) is defined on the edges of the graph might be confusing, hence let us rephrase Theorem 12 using graph terminology as it might be of independent combinatorial interest. The theorem is equivalent to the following: For any graph that is the union of two spanning trees A and B, its edges can be ordered in such a way that the elements of A and B appear alternately, and every cycle of G contains two consecutive elements.\nA rank-r matroid is called paving if each set of size at most r \u2212 1 is independent, or in other words, each circuit has size r or r + 1.\nTheorem 14. Paving matroids have property (P+).\nProof. We prove the theorem by induction on |E|. Note that (P+) clearly holds when E = \u2205. Take a pair of bases A,B. As the class of graphic matroids is closed under taking minors, Lemma 11 applies, hence we may assume that E is the disjoint union of A and B.\nLet ar \u2208 A and br \u2208 B such that A \u2212 ar + br is a basis. Then A \u2212 ar and B \u2212 br are bases of the paving matroid M \u2032 obtained from M by contracting br and deleting ar. By the induction hypothesis, there exist orderings a1, . . . , ar\u22121 of A \u2212 ar and b1, . . . , br\u22121 of B \u2212 br such that the path P \u2032 = a1, b1, . . . , ar\u22121, br\u22121 covers the circuits of M\n\u2032. We claim that the path P = a1, b1, . . . , ar, br covers each circuit of M . Since M is paving, we only need to consider circuits C of size r as circuits of size r+ 1 are clearly covered. If ar 6\u2208 C, then C \u2212 br contains a circuit of M \u2032 which is covered by P \u2032. If ar \u2208 C, then C is covered by P as A is the only stable set of size r containing ar. Therefore, P covers every circuit of M .\nA rank-r spike with tip t and legs {t, x1, y1}, . . . , {t, xr, yr} is a rank-r matroid on the ground set E = {t, x1, y1, . . . , xr, yr} such that each leg is a circuit and, for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r \u2212 1, the union of any k legs has rank k + 1. Equivalently, the family of the non-spanning circuits of a spike consists of the legs, all sets of the form {xi, yi, xj , yj} with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 r, and a subset H \u2286 {Z \u2286 E | |Z| = r, |Z \u2229 {xi, yi}| = 1 for i = 1, . . . , r} such that the intersection of any two members of H has size at most r \u2212 2.\nTheorem 15. Spikes have property (P+).\nProof. Let M be a spike defined as above. Observe that a set Z \u2286 E is a basis if and only if one of the following holds.\n1. t \u2208 Z, {x`, y`} \u2229 Z = \u2205 for an index 1 \u2264 ` \u2264 r, and |{xi, yi} \u2229 Z| = 1 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , r} \\ {`}.\n2. t 6\u2208 Z and there exist distinct indices k and ` such that {xk, yk} \u2286 Z, {x`, y`}\u2229Z = \u2205 and |{xi, yi} \u2229 Z| = 1 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , r} \\ {k, `}.\n3. t 6\u2208 Z, |{xi, yi} \u2229 Z| = 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, and Z 6\u2208 H.\nWe show by induction on r that each pair A,B of bases of M has the property required by (P+). The statement clearly holds for r \u2264 2, hence we assume that r \u2265 3.\nFirst consider the case when A\u2229B 6= \u2205. If t \u2208 A\u2229B, then the statement follows by applying (P+) to the pair A \u2212 t, B \u2212 t of bases of the matroid M/t. Note that M/t is a laminar, thus strongly base orderable matroid with family of bases {Z \u2286 E \u2212 t | |Z| = r \u2212 1, |{xi, yi} \u2229 Z| = 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r}. If t 6\u2208 A \u2229B, then we may assume that xr \u2208 A \u2229B. If t 6\u2208 A \u222aB, then the statement follows by applying the induction hypothesis to the pair of bases A \u2212 xr, B \u2212 xr of the matroid M/xr\\t which is a spike with tip yr and legs {x1, y1}, . . . , {xr\u22121, yr\u22121}. Similarly, if yr 6\u2208 A\u222aB, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the pair of bases A\u2212xr, B\u2212xr of M/xr\\yr which is a spike with tip t and legs {x1, y1}, . . . , {xr\u22121, yr\u22121}. It remains to consider the case t \u2208 A4B, xr \u2208 A \u2229 B and yr \u2208 A \u222a B, when we may assume that t \u2208 A \\ B and\nyr \u2208 B \\A. As z and yr are parallel in M/xr, the matroids M/{xr, t}\\{yr} and M/{yr, xr}\\{t} are the same. Let us denote this matroid by M \u2032 \u2013 note that M \u2032 is strongly base orderable as it is the minor of the laminar matroid M/t. Let P \u2032 denote a path obtained by applying (P+) to the pair of bases A\u2212 xr \u2212 t and B \u2212 xr \u2212 yr of M \u2032. Then P \u2032 + yrt satisfies the requirements of (P+) for the basis pair A,B in M , as the union of any independent set of M \u2032 and either {xr, t} or {xr, yr} is independent in M .\nIn the remaining cases A \u2229B = \u2205. Suppose first that t \u2208 A \u222aB. We may assume that A = {t, x1, . . . , xr\u22121}, and either B = {y2, . . . , yr, xr} or B = {y1, . . . , yr}. If B = {y2, . . . , yr, xr}, then the path P = x2, y2, . . . , xr\u22121, yr\u22121, t, xr, x1, yr alternating between A and B covers each circuit of M\\y1. Indeed, xiyi \u2208 P for each 2 \u2264 i \u2264 r \u2212 1, it covers the leg {t, xr, yr} and it has no stable set Z with |{x1, y1} \u2229 Z| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |{xr, yr} \u2229 Z| = 1. If B = {y1, . . . , yr}, then the path P = t, yr, x1, y1, . . . , xr\u22121, yr\u22121 covers each circuit of M\\xr. Indeed, xiyi \u2208 P for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r\u2212 1 and the only stable set Z of P with |{x1, y1}\u2229Z| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |{xr, yr}\u2229Z| = 1 is the basis Z = {y1, . . . , yr} = B.\nIt remains to consider cases with A\u2229B = \u2205 and A\u222aB = E\u2212 t. If A contains a pair {xi, yi}, then we may assume that A = {x1, y1, x3, x4, . . . , xr} and B = {x2, y2, y3, y4, . . . , yr}. Consider the paths P1 = x1, y2, y1, x2, x3, y3, . . . , xr, yr and P2 = x1, x2, y1, y2, x3, y3, . . . , xr, yr. Each of P1 and P2 covers the circuits of the form {xi, yi, xj , yj} for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 r, since both of them contains the edges x3y3, . . . , xryr and covers {x1, y1, x2, y2}. The only set Z with |{x1, y1}\u2229Z| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |{xr, yr} \u2229 Z| = 1 which is a stable set of P1 or P2 is Z1 = {x1, x2, y3, y4, . . . , yr} and Z2 = {x1, y2, y3, . . . , yr}, respectively. Since |Z1 \u2229 Z2| = r \u2212 1, at least one of Z1 and Z2 is not in H and thus at least one of P1 and P2 covers every circuit of M\\t.\nIn the only remaining case we may assume that A = {x1, . . . , xr} and B = {y1, . . . , yr}. We claim that the path P = yr, x1, y1, . . . , xr\u22121, yr\u22121, xr covers each circuit ofM\\t. Indeed, xiyi \u2208 P for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r\u22121 and the only stable sets Z of P with |{x1, y1}\u2229Z| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |{xr, yr}\u2229Z| = 1 are the bases Z = {x1, . . . , xr} = A and Z = {y1, . . . , yr} = B."

            "text": "Motivated by a conjecture of Du, Hsu and Hwang [15], Erdo\u030bs [18] popularized the so-called cycle plus triangles problem which asked whether every 4-regular graph that is the edge-disjoint union of a Hamiltonian cycle and pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles is 3-colorable. Fleischner and Stiebitz [19] answered this question in the affirmative. In the past decades, their work was followed by a series of papers that studied related problems, summarized below.\nTheorem 16. (Fleischner and Stiebitz, McDonald and Puleo, Haxell)\n(a) If a graph G is the edge-disjoint union of a Hamiltonian cycle and some pairwise vertexdisjoint triangles, then G is 3-colorable.\n(b) If k \u2265 4 and a graph G is the edge-disjoint union of a Hamiltonian cycle and some pairwise vertex-disjoint complete subgraphs each on at most k vertices, then G is k-colorable.\n(c) If k \u2265 4 and a graph G is the edge-disjoint union of a 2-regular bipartite graph and some pairwise disjoint cliques each on at most k vertices, then G is k-colorable.\n(d) If k \u2265 5 and a graph G is the edge-disjoint union of a 2-regular graph and some pairwise vertex-disjoint complete subgraphs each on at most k vertices, then G is k-colorable.\nStatement (b) was proven by Fleischner and Stiebitz [20]. McDonald and Puleo [32] verified for k \u2265 4 that if a graph is decomposable into cliques on exactly k vertices and a 2-regular graph with at most one odd cycle of length exceeding three, then it is k-colorable. This implies statement (c), as we can extend the cliques having less than k vertices and the 2-regular bipartite\ngraph by adding extra vertices and edges to ensure that each clique has exactly k vertices. Finally, statement (d) follows from the result of Haxell [23] that a graph is k-colorable if it is decomposable into cliques on k vertices and a graph H such that k \u2265 3\u2206(H) \u2212 1. Note that the complete graph on four vertices shows that statements (b) and (c) do not hold for k = 3, while it is open whether (d) holds for k = 4.\nTheorem 17. Let M1 = (E, I1) be a 2-coverable matroid and M2 = (E, I2) be a k-coverable partition matroid.\n(a) If k \u2265 3 and M1 satisfies (P), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k. (b) If k \u2265 4 and M1 satisfies (R+), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k. (c) If k \u2265 5 and M1 satisfies (R), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k.\nProof. To prove (a), let E = A \u222aB be a decomposition of M1 into two bases and P be a path on A4B covering the circuits of M1. Let E1, . . . , Eq denote the partition classes of M2 and let Q denote the graph obtained by taking the union of complete graphs on Ei for i = 1, . . . , q. We claim that the graph G := P \u222aQ is k-colorable. Indeed, if k = 3, then G is a subgraph of a graph appearing in Theorem 16(a), while for k \u2265 4 we can apply Theorem 16(b) after adding an extra edge to G between the end vertices of P . As each stable set of P is independent in M1 and each stable set of Q is independent in M2, the k-colorability of G implies that \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k.\nParts (b) and (c) can be proved analogously using Theorem 16(c) and (d), respectively.\nOne of the main consequences of the results discussed so far is that we confirm Conjecture 1 for instances that were not settled before.\nCorollary 18. Conjecture 1 holds if M1 is either a graphic matroid, a paving matroid or a spike with \u03b2(M1) = 2, and M2 is a partition matroid.\nProof. The conjecture was settled for \u03b2(M2) \u2264 2 in [4]. For \u03b2(M2) \u2265 3, the statement follows by combining Theorems 12 \u2013 15 and Theorem 17(a).\nKotlar and Ziv [29] defined an element e of a matroid M to be (k + 1)-spanned if there exist k + 1 pairwise disjoint sets such that e is spanned by each of them in M . This condition is equivalent to the existence of k pairwise disjoint sets not containing e but spanning it, as one of the sets can be chosen to be {e}. If a matroid does not contain any (k + 1)-spanned element, then it is not difficult to show that it is k-coverable. Kotlar and Ziv conjectured that if no element is (k + 1)-spanned in either M1 or M2, then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k. They verified the conjecture if k = 2 or the ground set decomposes into k bases in each of M1 and M2. Next we show how the absence of (k + 1)-spanned elements can be combined with (R) or (P).\nTheorem 19. Let M1 = (E, I1) be a 2-coverable matroid and M2 = (E, I2) be a matroid with no (k + 1)-spanned elements.\n(a) If M1 satisfies (P), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k + 1. (b) If M1 satisfies (R), then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k + 2.\nProof. To prove (a), let E = {e1, . . . , en} be such that every stable set of the path defined by the ordering e1, . . . , en is independent in M1. Color the elements in the order e1, . . . , en greedily with positive integers such that an element ei receives the smallest color c which is distinct from the color of ei\u22121, and the set of elements already having color c does not span ei in M2. This procedure results in a coloring such that each color class is independent in M2 and form a stable set of the path, thus it is independent in M1 as well. As M2 contains no (k+ 1)-spanned elements, the number of colors used is at most k + 1. This proves that \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 k + 1.\nStatement (b) follows by a similar greedy argument.\nAharoni and Berger [3] defined a graph G to be matroidally k-colorable if for every kcoverable matroid M on the vertex set of G, the ground set can be decomposed into k stable sets of G which are independent in M . The following facts are not difficult to show for matroidally k-colorable graphs.\nLemma 20.\n(a) A subgraph of a matroidally k-colorable graph is matroidally k-colorable.\n(b) A matroidally k-colorable graph is matroidally (k + 1)-colorable.\nProof. The proof of (a) is straightforward. To prove (b), let G be a matroidally k-colorable graph on vertex set V and M be a (k + 1)-coverable matroid on V . Let V = I1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Ik+1 be a partition of V into independent sets of M . As the graph G[I1 \u222a . . . Ik] is matroidally k-coverable by (a) and M\\Ik+1 is a k-coverable matroid on its vertex set, there exist stable sets S1, . . . , Sk of G which are independent in M\\Ik+1 such that S1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Sk = I1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Ik. Since G[S2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Sk \u222a Ik+1] is matroidally k-coverable by (a) and M\\S1 is a k-coverable matroid on its vertex set, there exist stable sets S\u20322, . . . , S \u2032 k+1 of G which are independent in M\\S1 such that S\u20322 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a S\u2032k+1 = S2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Sk \u222a Ik+1. Then V = S1 \u222a S\u20322 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a S\u2032k+1 is a partition of V into stable sets of G which are independent in M .\nAs a generalization of Theorem 16(a), Aharoni and Berger [3] conjectured that the cycle C3` is matroidally 3-colorable for every ` \u2265 1. Their conjecture, when combined with Lemma 20(a), would imply the following.\nConjecture 3. Every path is matroidally 3-colorable.\nRemark 21. It is reasonable to ask whether there is a connection between Conjectures 1 and 3. It turns out that the latter implies the former when M1 is 2-coverable matroid satisfying (P).\nIndeed, let P be a path on vertex set E such that every stable set of P is independent in M1, and let M2 = (E, I2) be an arbitrary k-coverable matroid. If k = 2, then \u03b2(M1 \u2229M2) \u2264 3 holds by the results of Aharoni, Berger and Ziv [4]. If k \u2265 3 and Conjecture 3 holds, then P is matroidally k-colorable by Lemma 20(b), hence E can be decomposed into k stable sets of P which are independent set in M2. This gives a decomposition of E into k common independent sets of M1 and M2.\nBy the above reasoning, Conjectures 2 and 3 together would imply Conjecture 1 when M1 is 2-coverable.\nFinally, let us mention an interesting result on the intersection of q matroids satisfying (R). Let M1, . . . ,Mq be 2-coverable matroids over the same ground set. In general, not much is known about the minimum number of common independent sets \u03b2(M1 \u2229 . . . ,\u2229Mq) needed to cover their ground set. An obvious upper bound is the product of their individual covering numbers, that is, \u03b2(M1 \u2229 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2229Mq) \u2264 \u220fq i=1 \u03b2(Mi) = 2\nq. Nevertheless, a much stronger upper bound follows if each Mi satisfies (R).\nTheorem 22. Let M1, . . . ,Mq be 2-coverable matroids satisfying (R). Then \u03b2(M1\u2229\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2229Mq) \u2264 2q + 1.\nProof. Let Gi be a 2-regular graph covering the circuits of Mi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q. Since the graph G := G1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aGq has maximum degree at most 2q, it is (2q + 1)-colorable. Since every stable set of G is stable in each Gi, this coloring gives a decomposition of the ground set into 2q + 1 common independent sets of the matroids."

The question was later raised again by Wiedemann [38] and by Cordovil and Moreira [13].\nConjecture 4. (Gabow) Let A and B be bases of a rank-r matroid M . Then there exist orderings (a1, . . . , ar) and (b1, . . . , br) of the elements of A and B, respectively, such that their concatenation (a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , br) is a cyclic ordering in which any interval of length r forms a basis.\nAn easy reasoning shows that the statement holds for strongly base orderable matroids. Apart from this, the conjecture was settled for graphic matroids [13, 26, 38], sparse paving matroids [10], matroids of rank at most 4 [30] and 5 [28], split matroids [7], and spikes [5]. In what follows, we show that (P+) implies a slightly weakened version of the conjecture.\nTheorem 23. Let A and B bases of a rank-r matroid M satisfying (P+). Then there exist orderings (a1, . . . , ar) and (b1, . . . , br) of the elements of A and B, respectively, such that their concatenation (a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , br) is a cyclic ordering in which any interval {ai, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , bi\u22121} forms a basis for i = 1, . . . , r, and any interval {bi, . . . , br, a1, . . . , ai\u22121} has rank at least r \u2212 1 for i = 1, . . . , r.\nProof. Let k = |A \\ B| = |B \\ A|. By property (P+), there exists a path P that alternates between A \\ B and B \\ A such that the union of A \u2229 B and any stable set in the path is independent in M . Let the elements along this path be denoted by b1, a1, . . . , bk, ak, where ai \u2208 A \\ B and bi \u2208 B \\ A for i = 1, . . . , k. Furthermore, take two copies of each element in A \u2229 B and denote those by aj and bj for j = k + 1, . . . , r. We claim that the ordering (a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , br) satisfies the conditions of the theorem. To see this, observe that, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, the interval {ai, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , bi\u22121} is the union of A\u2229B and a set that is stable on the path P .

This rightly raises the question of whether a similar statement could hold for higher values of the covering number, e.g. whether all circuits of a matroid M can be covered by a small number of edges. The next lower bound only uses the fact that each independent set of M has size at most r(M).\nTheorem 24. Let M be a matroid such that its ground decomposes into disjoint bases.

Indeed, taking a complete graph on the elements of each partition class would result in a graph of at most ( 2\u00b7\u03b2(M)\n2\n) \u00b7\nr(M) edges that covers every circuit of the matroid. The conjecture was disproved in [2] and independently in [31], and their proofs also show a lower bound of \u0398 ( \u03b2(M)2 \u00b7 log \u03b2(M) \u00b7 r(M) ) .\nFor any matroid M the size of the ground set is bounded by \u03b2(M) \u00b7 r(M), hence O(\u03b2(M)2 \u00b7 r(M)2) edges always suffice to cover all the circuits \u2013 just take a complete graph on E.

            "text": "In this paper, we studied relaxations of strongly base orderability of matroids, and showed that the combination of the proposed relaxations with existing results and conjectures leads to interesting observations. Our hopes are that this new approach will serve as a useful tool in matroid optimization problems, especially when working with disjoint common independent sets of two or more matroids.\nConjecture 2 remains an intriguing open problem even for special classes of matroids. While Theorem 12 settles the conjecture for graphic matroids, an analogous result is missing for the co-graphic case. Similarly to Remark 13, it is worth rephrasing the question using graph terminology.\nQuestion 1. Given a graph that is the union of two spanning trees A and B, is it always possible to order the edges in such a way that the elements of A and B appear alternately, and every cut of G contains two consecutive elements?\nAnother interesting question is to characterize the forbidden minors of SBRO matroids. We have seen that M(K4) and J are forbidden minors, and one can also verify that the matroid X10 described in Remark 9 is also a forbidden minor for this class. However, we are not aware of any further examples, though the cases of SBO and BO matroids suggests that one should expect an infinite number of forbidden minors, see [11].\nQuestion 2. What are the forbidden minors of the class SBRO? Is there an infinite sequence of them?\nFinally, let us repeat the question raised in Section 3.5.\nQuestion 3. Is there a function f such that the circuits of any matroid M can be covered by O(f(\u03b2(M)) \u00b7 r(M)) edges?\nAcknowledgement.
