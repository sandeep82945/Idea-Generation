Mechanisms of Afatinib Resistance in Uncommon EGFR Mutations: Despite afatinib's effectiveness in treating rare EGFR mutations, resistance eventually develops. There's a need for studies focusing on the mechanisms of resistance specific to uncommon EGFR mutations treated with afatinib. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to the development of combination therapies or new drugs to overcome or delay resistance.

Comparative Effectiveness of Afatinib Versus Third-Generation EGFR-TKIs: While the paper discusses afatinib's efficacy for certain rare EGFR mutations, comparing its effectiveness and safety profile directly with third-generation EGFR-TKIs in a randomized controlled trial could provide clear guidance on treatment selection for specific rare mutations.

Combination Therapies Involving Afatinib for Rare EGFR Mutations: Investigating the potential synergistic effects of afatinib combined with other targeted therapies (like cetuximab) or with newer treatment modalities (such as immunotherapy or anti-angiogenic agents) could offer novel therapeutic options for patients with specific rare mutations who do not respond well to monotherapy.

Longitudinal Studies on Quality of Life: While the clinical efficacy of afatinib in terms of PFS, OS, and ORR is documented, there's a gap in understanding how afatinib treatment impacts the long-term quality of life of patients with rare EGFR mutations. Longitudinal studies could provide insights into the management of side effects and the overall impact of treatment on patient well-being.

Genetic and Molecular Profiling for Personalized Treatment Strategies: Given the heterogeneity of rare EGFR mutations and their varied response to afatinib, comprehensive genetic and molecular profiling studies could help in developing personalized treatment strategies. This could involve identifying biomarkers predictive of response to afatinib or other targeted therapies and tailoring treatment plans based on individual genetic profiles.
