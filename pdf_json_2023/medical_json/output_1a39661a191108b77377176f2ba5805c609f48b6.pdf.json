    "abstractText": "Duck meat is pivotal in providing high-quality protein for human nutrition, underscoring the importance of studying duck myogenesis. The regulatory mechanisms governing duck myogenesis involve both coding and non-coding RNAs, yet their specific expression patterns and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we performed expression profiling analyses of mRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs involved in duck myogenesis using whole-transcriptome RNA-seq. Our analysis identified 1733 differentially expressed (DE)-mRNAs, 1116 DE-lncRNAs, 54 DE-circRNAs, and 174 DE-miRNAs when comparing myoblasts and myotubes. A GO analysis highlighted the enrichment of DE molecules in the extracellular region, protein binding, and exocyst. A KEGG analysis pinpointed pathways related to ferroptosis, PPAR signaling, nitrogen metabolism, cell cycle, cardiac muscle contraction, glycerolipid metabolism, and actin cytoskeleton. A total of 51 trans-acting lncRNAs, including ENSAPLT00020002101 and ENSAPLT00020012069, were predicted to participate in regulating myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Based on the ceRNAs, we constructed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks involving five miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-133a-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-27b-3p, and let-7b-5p) that are relevant to myogenesis. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analyses of the DE-mRNAs within the ceRNA network underscored the significant enrichment of the glycerolipid metabolism pathway. We identified five different DE-mRNAs, specifically ENSAPLG00020001677, ENSAPLG00020002183, ENSAPLG00020005019, ENSAPLG00020010497, and ENSAPLG00020017682, as potential target genes that are crucial for myogenesis in the context of glycerolipid metabolism. These five mRNAs are integral to ceRNA networks, with miR-107_R-2 and miR-1260 emerging as key regulators. In summary, this study provides a valuable resource elucidating the intricate interplay of mRNA-lncRNA-circRNAmiRNA in duck myogenesis, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms that govern this critical biological process.",

            "text": "China is the world\u2019s foremost producer of duck meat [1], which is recognized for its exceptional protein content and nutritional value [2]. Skeletal muscle, a crucial component of poultry, accounts for 50% of chicken weight, exerting a pivotal influence on metabolic processes [3]. The feed conversion rate and meat yield are important economic indicators in animal husbandry, and the development of skeletal muscle is closely linked to the meat\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16387. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242216387 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16387 2 of 22\nproduction in livestock. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the molecular mechanism linked to the skeletal muscle development of ducks. At the embryonic stage, myoblasts play pivotal roles in shaping skeletal muscle. They orchestrate complex biological processes, including migration, adhesion, proliferation, membrane recombination, and nuclear fusion, culminating in the formation of multinucleated myotubes [4]. In birds, the initiation of muscle tissue commences during the embryonic phase, with muscle cells expanding or undergoing hypertrophy post-hatching through satellite cell fusion [5,6]. Genes, as the repositories of genetic information, govern an array of life\u2019s biological processes. While gene products, including polypeptides and protein macromolecules, play vital biological functions [7], a mere 2% of the human genome comprises proteinencoding genes. The majority of genome sites, over 98%, are transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [8]. An expanding body of research has shown that ncRNAs such as lncRNA [9], circRNA [10], and microRNA [11] can form a complex post-transcriptional regulatory network to regulate gene expression and affect the growth and development of skeletal muscle. Until now, investigations into ncRNAs linked to duck skeletal muscle growth and development have predominantly focused on characterizing [12,13] or exploring the function of individual RNA types [14,15]. While previous studies have successfully revealed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks governing aspects like chicken fat deposition and skeletal muscle growth and development [16,17], a comprehensive ceRNA regulatory network, comprising lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions during duck embryonic myoblast proliferation and differentiation, remains unknown. This study contributes whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing and global expression data (mRNA-lncRNA-circRNA-miRNA) on duck embryonic leg muscle, including myoblasts in a growth medium and differentiating myoblasts (myotubes) on day 4. We present a predicted a ceRNA regulatory network for duck embryonic myogenesis, elucidated in Figure 1A. These data substantially enhance our understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying duck myogenesis and serve as a valuable reference for future myogenesis studies. Int. J. Mol.

After inducing differentiation, myotube growth and enlargement were evident on day 4, as depicted in Figure 1C. Undifferentiated duck myoblasts were identified using a primary antibody against desmin and maintained in GM (Figure 1D). The cells that were exposed to a differentiation medium for four days (Figure 1E) were stained with a primary antibody against MyHC and a green fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody, demonstrating the formation of myotubes on day 4, a contrast to the absence of myotubes during the GM culture. Additionally, the duck myoblasts were differentiated for four days (DM1 to DM4) to assess the mRNA levels of well-known muscle markers, including MYOG, MYOD, and MYF5, using qRT-PCR (Figure 1F\u2013H). These findings affirm the induction of duck myogenesis, serving as a foundation for a subsequent analysis."

Comparative studies, such\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16387 13 of 22\nas the analysis conducted by Chen et al. [19] in Shitou goose, reported a higher number of DE-lncRNAs than we observed in our study. Our results highlight the prevalence of intergenic lncRNAs and exonic circRNAs, which is in line with previous research [20,21]. These findings infer that the numbers of DE-mRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-circRNAs, and DE-miRNAs exhibit considerable diversity across different species, time periods, and cell processes, indicating that the regulatory roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs are contingent upon the specific factors at play in each particular case. During a biological process, such as in a cell or organism, the gene expression patterns change [22]. During myoblast differentiation, the expression of functional genes, such as MYOG, significantly increases, while unrelated genes are repressed [23]. In our comparison of differentiated myoblasts (DM) and proliferating myoblasts (GM), we observed a general up-regulation of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, with fewer miRNAs exhibiting upregulation. This phenomenon suggests that enhanced differentiation leads to the activation of functional RNAs, while miRNA regulation becomes less pronounced, facilitating the differentiation process and subsequent fusion of myoblasts. Our study identified DE mRNAs that are crucial for skeletal muscle development, including MYF5, MYOG, PAX3, and FABP2. These genes play vital roles in embryonic myogenesis. Notably, MYF5 and MYOG deficiencies can lead to skeletal muscle loss in mice [24,25], emphasizing their significance. In this study, the FABP2 gene was significantly down-regulated in myoblasts. FABP2 is an intracellular protein, which can regulate important biological processes, such as fatty acid transport and metabolism [26]. FABP2 has been proven to be DE in the skeletal muscle of white Muscovy ducks with different embryo ages, and the expression level increases with the increase in the embryo age, which may be an important candidate gene for influencing duck growth traits [27]. In recent years, lncRNAs have gained prominence for their roles in muscle growth and atrophy [28]. These functional lncRNAs primarily exert cis-regulation and trans-regulation effects [29]. For example, lncEDCH1 promotes myoblast proliferation, inhibits differentiation, and reduces intramuscular fat deposition [30]. LncIRS1 acts as a molecular sponge, regulating the IGF1-PI3K/AKT pathway and controlling muscle atrophy [31]. Our study revealed the significant enrichment of the cis-regulated target genes of DE-lncRNAs in the cell adhesion molecules pathway, which plays a pivotal role in muscle fiber formation and development. Cell adhesion factors are important determinants for myogenesis and skeletal muscle satellite cell activity [32]. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has been found to play an important role in skeletal muscle cells, which can enhance myogenesis [33]. Trans-acting lncRNAs are known to influence the expression of mRNA genes at a distance from the lncRNA locus. Our analysis identified trans-acting lncRNAs associated with cell proliferation and myoblast differentiation markers, providing insights into their roles in skeletal muscle growth and development [29]. MUNC is an ncRNA located upstream of MYOD (at the distal regulatory region of MYOD). MUNC is a trans-acting lncRNA, which is involved in the regulation of many muscle-related genes [34]. LncRNA PAM regulates the proliferation and aging of skeletal muscle satellite cells via the trans-regulation of the expressions of TIMP2 and VIM [35]. In our study, we analyzed the interaction between DE-trans-acting lncRNAs and DE-mRNAs, screened out the trans-acting lncRNAs of the cell proliferation and myoblast differentiation markers, and constructed a trans-regulation lncRNA-mRNA interaction regulatory network. The predicted trans-acting lncRNAs found in this study provide new clues for exploring the growth and development of skeletal muscle. CircRNAs have recently emerged as essential regulators in skeletal muscle development [36]. For instance, circHIPK3 regulates the expression of MEF2C by acting as a miR-30a-3p sponge, thereby promoting the proliferation and differentiation of chicken myoblasts [37]. Research has shown that circMYBPC1 functions as a miR-23a sponge to enhance muscle differentiation and binds directly to MyHC protein, affecting muscle development [38]. Furthermore, circ-ZNF609 has an open reading frame with both start and stop codons, enabling it to translate proteins and promote human myoblast proliferation [39].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16387 14 of 22\nIn our study, we observed that DE-circRNAs significantly enriched the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway. The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway has been found to be significantly enriched in duck breast muscle and leg muscle at different growth stages [40]. In a previous study that conducted a differential expression analysis of circRNAs in the skeletal muscle of juvenile and adult largemouth bass, it was found that the parent gene is mainly enriched in the actin cytoskeleton regulation signaling pathway [41]. At the same time, the parental genes of circRNAs with coding potential in the expression profile of mouse C2C12 myoblasts were also enriched into the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway [42]. This pathway has been consistently implicated in skeletal muscle development in various species, further highlighting its importance. Regarding the regulatory mechanism of ncRNAs, the ceRNA hypothesis was first put forward in 2011 and was widely accepted and used to explain various genetic mechanisms [43]. It is important to reveal the potential molecular mechanism of duck skeletal muscle growth and development; however, the regulatory mechanism of ceRNA is limited in the study of duck skeletal muscle. MiRNAs can directly target mRNAs to regulate gene expression and often interact with mRNAs and ncRNAs via the ceRNA regulation mechanism [44]. For instance, in skeletal muscle regeneration and myogenesis, miR-200c5p regulates the migration and differentiation of muscle cells by targeting Adamts5 [11]. Based on the results of the miRNA-seq, we identified many DE-miRNAs, including miR129-5p [45], miR-133a-5p [46], miR-22-3p [47], miR-27b-3p [48] and let-7b-5p [49]. Importantly, we revealed some potential ceRNA regulatory networks before and after the differentiation of duck embryo myoblasts based on the interaction regulatory networks of DE-miRNA with DE-mRNA, DE-miRNA with DE-lncRNA, and DE-miRNA with DEcircRNA. MSTRG.8157.4, MSTRG.5093.2, MSTRG.15721.1, MSTRG.7773.1, MSTRG.1682.5, MSTRG.1917.1, ENSAPLT00020011160, ENSAPLT00020019569, ENSAPLT00020017996, 9 DE-lncRNAs, and 20 DE-circRNAs, including circ4021, circ1551, and circ1562, can simultaneously act as molecular sponges for the five miRNAs. A functional enrichment analysis was carried out based on all DE-mRNAs involved in these ceRNA networks. Interestingly, a KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these DE genes were significantly enriched in the glycerolipid metabolism signaling pathway. The regulation of glycerolipid biosynthesis is important for cell lipid storage and cell membrane homeostasis [50]. The further construction of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA-pathway regulation network showed that miR-1260 and miR-107_R-2 were involved in the regulation of the glycerolipid metabolism pathway. It was found that miR-1260 and miR-107 were closely related to the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A43 [51]. MiR-107 is highly expressed in the skeletal muscle of Qinchuan cattle, and circFGFR4 can promote myoblast differentiation by binding with miR-107 [52]. In this study, we found that miR-1260 and miR-107_R-2 were highly expressed in the primary myoblasts of duck embryos. miR-1260 was significantly down-regulated, and miR-107_R-2 was significantly up-regulated in the primary myoblasts of duck embryo. This indicates that miR-1260 and miR-107_R-2 may be involved in the regulation of the skeletal muscle\u2013glycerolipid metabolism pathway, thus affecting the differentiation of skeletal muscle and becoming potential candidate miRNAs for regulating the growth and development of skeletal muscle. These ceRNA networks and the trans-acting lncRNA-mRNA interaction constructed in this study can be used as candidate regulatory networks for the differentiation of primary myoblasts from duck embryos. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive characterization of mRNA and ncRNA (lncRNA-circRNA-miRNA) expression profiles during duck leg myogenesis, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing healthy duck muscle development. The identified ceRNA networks and lncRNA-mRNA interactions serve as candidate regulatory networks for further exploration in the context of duck skeletal muscle differentiation and growth. These findings lay the groundwork for future research in this field.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16387 15 of 22"

Identification of lncRNA: StringTie (v2.1.6, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA) [57] was used to identify novel transcripts compared to the reference genome. Gffcompare (v0.9.8, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA) was used to filter known mRNA, lncRNA, and transcripts shorter than 200 nt. We implemented a systematic approach to define lncRNA transcripts. Specifically, we classified transcripts with class codes \u2018i, j, o, u, and x\u2019 as lncRNAs. These class codes signify distinct features that are indicative of lncRNA characteristics. Let us delve into these classifications: (i) Class \u2018i\u2019 refers to a transcribed fragment, which could be either in the sense or anti-sense orientation, that is entirely contained within a reference intron. This delineates the lncRNAs associated with intronic regions. (j) Class \u2018j\u2019 pertains to transcripts that exhibit at least one splicing junction shared with the reference transcript. This classification highlights lncRNAs with splicing features in common with known transcripts. (u) Class \u2018u\u2019 designates a lncRNA as an intergenic transcript of unknown function. This category encompasses lncRNAs originating from intergenic regions, often with yet undetermined functions. (o) Class \u2018o\u2019 is applied when an ordinary exon of a predicted lncRNA partially overlaps with a reference transcript. This classification recognizes lncRNAs that may share exonic sequences with other transcripts. CPC (v0.9-r2, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China) [58] and CNCI (v2.0, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China) [59] software were used to predict novel lncRNA transcripts with coding potential. All transcripts with CPC score < 0.5 and CNCI score < 0 were considered novel lncRNAs. Identification of circRNA: From the aligned BAM files, circRNA sequences were identified using CircExplorer (v2.2.6) [60,61] and CIRI (v2.0.2) [62]. The reverse splicing sequences were identified in the unmapped sequence using TopHat-Fusion (v2.0.10) [63], a bioinformatic tool used for the detection of gene fusions. Identification of miRNA: ACGT 101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA) was used to remove adapter dimer, garbage, low complexity, and common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA), followed by mapping unique sequences (with a length of 18~26 nucleotides) to specific species precursors in miRBase (Release 22.0, www.mirbase. org/, accessed on 1 August 2022.) [64] using BLAST search to identify known and novel miRNAs. Length variations at both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, as well as mismatches within non-identical sequences, are considered during the comparison process. We employed this approach to identify mature miRNA hairpin arms with distinctive sequences, which were mapped to specific species, thereby classifying them as known miRNAs. Conversely, in instances where the sequence of a mature miRNA exhibited annotations that corresponded to the opposite arm of a species-specific precursor hairpin, we identified them as novel 5por 3p-derived miRNA candidates."

            "text": "The distinct functions and modes of action of lncRNA, circRNA, and miRNA necessitated the use of distinct screening methods in our RNA sequencing and analysis. In the case of DE-lncRNAs, we employed Python scripts to screen for cis-acting lncRNAs. Specifically, we identified lncRNAs with a positional relationship to mRNAs within a range of 100 kb both upstream and downstream of the chromosomes. These lncRNAs were considered as potential cis-acting regulators, and the target mRNAs were obtained through the prediction of interactions between these cis-acting lncRNAs and DE-mRNAs. For the DE-circRNAs, we considered their host genes as potential target genes. In the case of the DE-miRNAs, we utilized two databases, TargetScan (v5.0) [68] and miRanda (v3.3a) [69], for the prediction of target genes with significant differences. We refined our predictions by applying stringent scoring criteria, including a TargetScan_score threshold of \u226550 and a miRanda_Energy below \u221210, ensuring that only the most relevant target genes were considered as the final target genes of differential miRNA. Subsequently, DE-mRNAs, DE cis-acting lncRNAs, DE-circRNAs, and DE-miRNAs underwent an enrichment analysis using GO and KEGG. The top GO terms and signaling pathways were visually represented using a bubble chart, with significance determined using the enriched p-values. This visualization was generated through the R-packet, ggplot2."

            "text": "Trans-acting lncRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression across different chromosomes. The identification of target mRNAs for trans-acting lncRNAs is based on the determination of the free energy required to form a stable secondary structure between the lncRNA and the mRNA sequence. A lower free energy requirement indicates a greater potential for an interaction between these two sequences. To predict the target mRNAs of the trans-acting lncRNA, we employed the RIsearch (v1.1) software [70], which utilizes this free energy criterion to make precise predictions. Specifically, we assessed the likelihood of an interaction by considering the energetic stability of the secondary structure formed between the lncRNA and its target mRNA sequences. Our focus extended to trans-acting lncRNAs that interacted with key markers of cell proliferation, such as CCNA2 and CDK4, as well as markers of myoblast differentiation, including MYOG, MYF5, and MYF6. To ensure the robustness of these interactions, we applied a stringent criterion, requiring an absolute value of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient greater than 0.8. This selection process ensured that only highly correlated trans-acting lncRNAs were considered. To provide a comprehensive visualization of these intricate interactions, we utilized the Cytoscape (v3.8.2, Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, Washington, DC, USA) software [71]."

The approach began with the prediction of miRNA-mRNA, miRNA-lncRNA, and miRNA-circRNA pairs using TargetScan (v5.0) (with a score threshold of \u226550) and miRanda (v3.3a) (with an energy threshold of <\u221210) software. These stringent criteria ensured the selection of high-confidence interactions that were likely to be biologically relevant. From this pool of interactions, we focused on five miRNAs known to be involved in skeletal muscle development. For these miRNAs, we imposed even stricter criteria, requiring a TargetScan_score of \u226590 and a miRanda_Energy of <\u221215 for both miRNAmRNA and miRNA-lncRNA interactions.

Following this, we conducted GO and KEGG analyses to identify DE-mRNAs involved in the ceRNA regulatory network. This allowed us to elucidate the biological pathways and processes affected by these interactions.

            "text": "To validate the expression levels of DE-mRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-circRNAs, and DE-miRNAs, we employed qRT-PCR. Specifically, we randomly selected four genes from each of the aforementioned RNA categories that exhibited significant DE expressions. For the qRT-PCR experiments, we utilized six RNA samples, including myoblasts (n = 3) and myotubes (n = 3). The primers used for mRNAs and lncRNAs were designed through the primer-BLAST tool (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_ TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome, accessed on 13 April 2023.) available in the NCBI database. As for circRNAs, primer design was carried out using Oligo7.0 software (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The information of all primers used in the current study is provided in Supplementary Table S11. To detect miRNA, we employed a specific miRNA bulge-loop qRT-PCR primer set, designed by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China). The quantification of miRNAs was achieved through qPCR using the Revertra Ace qPCR RT Kit (No.FSQ-101, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). To prepare the RNA for qPCR analysis, reverse transcription into cDNA was performed using HIScript III All-in-one RT Supermix Perfect for qPCR (R333-01, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The qPCR reactions were carried out using the 2 \u00d7 T5 fast qPCR mix (SYBR Green I) (tse202, TSINGKE, Beijing, China) within a 20 \u00b5L reaction system. The components included 3 \u00b5L cDNA, 0.2 \u00b5L of 50 \u00d7 ROX Reference Dye II, 0.4 \u00b5L each of upstream and downstream primers, 5 \u00b5L SYBR Green I, and 11 \u00b5L of DEPC water. The qPCR reaction was carried out under the following steps: an initial temperature at 95 \u25e6C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u25e6C for 10 s, annealing at 60 \u25e6C for 5 s, and extension at 72 \u25e6C for 15 s. A final extension step was conducted at 72 \u25e6C for 7 min. GAPDH was utilized as the internal reference for mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA analyses, while U6 served as the internal reference for miRNA analysis. The 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT method [72] was used to calculate the relative expression level. The qPCR results are presented as means \u00b1 s.e.m. For multiple comparison analysis on relative expression of muscle markers, groups were compared with a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Duncan test using SPSS 26.0. The different letters between the two groups represent significant differences (p < 0.05). For two-group comparison on the validation of differentially expressed RNAs, the results were subjected to statistical analysis using the two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. The level of significance was presented as * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms242216387/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C. and S.L (Sanfeng Liu); methodology, S.L.
