Jensen 1\nMonoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) represent a large class of plant natural products with marketed pharmaceutical activities against a wide range of indications, including cancer, malaria and hypertension. Halogenated MIAs have shown improved pharmaceutical properties; however, synthesis of new-to-nature halogenated MIAs remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate a platform for de novo biosynthesis of two MIAs, serpentine and alstonine, in baker\u2019s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and deploy it to systematically explore the biocatalytic potential of refactored MIA pathways for the production of halogenated MIAs. From this, we demonstrate conversion of individual haloindole derivatives to a total of 19 different new-to-nature haloserpentine and haloalstonine analogs. Furthermore, by process optimization and heterologous expression of a modified halogenase in the microbial MIA platform, we document de novo halogenation and biosynthesis of chloroalstonine. Together, this study highlights a microbial platform for enzymatic exploration and production of complex natural and new-to-nature MIAs with therapeutic potential.\nMonoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) are an important group of plant secondary metabolites that possess various medicinal properties, including marketed chemotherapeutic agents such as vinblastine and vincristine and the antiarrhythmic drug ajmaline1. Likewise, numerous bioactive MIAs are used to treat human illnesses outside the clinic, including ibogaine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and withdrawal symptoms2 and the stereoisomers alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a) with reported therapeutic effects against a broad number of indications, such as psychotic disorders, cancer and malaria3.

Next, for the characterization of P450 enzymes catalyzing the conversion of THA (3a) to alstonine (1a), we selected candidates reported in the literature, R. serpentina sarpagan bridge enzyme (RseSBE), Gelsemium sempervirens SBE (GseSBE), C. roseus AS (CroAS)21 and the recently identified C. roseus SS (CroSS)12 due to its close homology with CroAS (Fig. 1b). We also mined the C. roseus genome for alternative AS candidates22. This led to the identification of a sequence displaying 87% identity with CroAS, tentatively named CroAS2 (ref. 21). Additionally, we generated a de novo assembled transcriptome of R. tetraphylla to search for additional AS candidates. Mining this new resource allowed the identification of two hypothetical P450 enzymes (R1n_CGCTCATT-TATAGCCT_DN432_c0_g1_i4.p1 and BP5_ GAGATTCC-GGCTCTGA_DN4992_c0_g1_i3.p1), which displayed more than 75% identity with already characterized AS21. Based on this significant identity, these two sequences were tentatively named RteAS1 and RteAS2. Three additional sequences of lower identity were also retained and hereafter named RteAS3 (R1n_CGCTCATT-TATAGCCT_DN14548_c0_ g1_i1.p1), RteAS4 (DL4_GAGATTCC-TATAGCCT_DN2810_c0_g2_i3.p1) and RteAS5 (BL2_CGCTCATT-CCTATCCT_DN6055_c0_g1_i1.p1; Fig. 1b).\nNext, to characterize the catalytic activity of the identified P450 candidates, we used a feeding strategy of secologanin (6) and tryptamine (7a) to the engineered background strain expressing C. roseus cytochrome P450 reductase (CroCPR), C. roseus strictosidine synthase (CroSTR) and RseSGD and CroTHAS1 (Sc86; Fig. 1a). Strains expressing individual P450 candidates were cultivated in synthetic complete (SC) or rich cultivation (yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD)) medium supplemented with secologanin (6) and tryptamine (7a; Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). In this screen, we identified five enzymes producing alstonine (1a), namely two synthases from R. tetraphylla (RteAS1 and RteAS2 in strains Sc87 and Sc88), SBE from G. sempervirens (GseSBE_nat in strain Sc98 or GseSBE in strain Sc104), CroAS2 (strain Sc101) and CroSS (strain Sc157). In YPD medium, we observed up to 20-fold improvements compared to SC medium (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1), with RteAS2 (strain Sc88) enabling the production of 71.7 \u00b1 41 \u00b5g liter\u20131 and CroSS enabling the production of 6,641 \u00b1 1,757 \u00b5g liter\u20131 in YPD (Fig. 1b).\nBased on the screen for ASs (Fig. 1b), individual genes encoding RteAS2, GseSBE_nat and CroSS_nat were genomically integrated into the strictosidine-producing strain MIA-CM-3 (ref. 9) together with RseSGD and CroTHAS1 to test de novo alstonine (1a) production (resulting in strains Sc77, Sc78 and Sc112, respectively) or together with RseSGD and CroHYS to test de novo serpentine (2a) production (resulting in strain Sc85). All strains were cultivated in a previously optimized medium for small-scale MIA production (3\u00d7 SC)9, in which Sc77 outperformed Sc78 with an alstonine (1a) titer of 29.7 \u00b1 4 \u00b5g liter\u20131, Sc112 expressing CroSS_nat yielded a further >40-fold increase in alstonine (1a) titer of 1,034 \u00b1 94 \u00b5g liter\u20131, and Sc85 was observed to produce 1,270 \u00b1 130 \u00b5g liter\u20131 serpentine (2a). Importantly, although strictosidine (5a) was consumed in all strains, THA (3a) and ajmalicine (4a) accumulated up to 990 \u00b1 192 \u00b5g liter\u20131 and 914 \u00b1 3 \u00b5g liter\u20131, respectively, in strains Sc77 and Sc78, whereas conversion of THA to alstonine by CroSS_nat in strain Sc112 lowered THA levels to 166 \u00b1 35 \u00b5g liter\u20131 (Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1).\nTo further investigate the physiology and productivities of de novo alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a) strains, fed-batch cultivation of strains Sc85 and Sc112 were cultivated in 3\u00d7 SC medium using controlled microbioreactors (Methods). To prevent accumulation of by-products (for example, ethanol) and improve biomass and product yield, cells were grown in batch culture for 20 h, followed by exponential feeding for 124 h. The highest final titers reached 8.85 mg liter\u20131 serpentine (2a) from strain Sc85 and 4.48 mg liter\u20131 alstonine (1a) from strain Sc112 (Fig. 1c,d, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). For\nMIAs, unnatural analogs with improved potency have also been reported4.\nProducing MIAs at scale for medicinal use is challenging. Source extraction from plants can suffer from supply chain shortages and generally poor yields5, whereas total chemical synthesis is plagued by difficulties separating stereoisomers6.\nA biotechnological solution for the production of both natural and modified MIAs is microbial cell factories, which are engineered to produce bioactive phytochemicals using fermentation. Indeed, heterologous expression of plant genes in baker\u2019s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has facilitated the production of various plant-derived pharmaceuticals, including MIAs7\u20139. Furthermore, valorization of commercially available precursors to downstream MIA-based active pharmaceutical ingredients has been demonstrated10, while Liu et al. recently documented the de novo production of a complex class of heteroyohimbines, including tetrahydroalstonine (3a) and ajmalicine (4a)11, which are the direct precursors for the MIA enantiomers alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a)12. With continued advancements in synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and plant biosynthetic pathway discoveries13, refactoring de novo production of bioactive MIAs in microbial cells is now facilitated.\nIn addition to the interest in fermentation-based de novo production of MIAs from simple feedstocks (for example, glucose and amino acids), several pioneering studies have investigated enzymatic production of unnatural MIAs from unnatural substrate analogs in vitro14 and in planta15 by feeding unnatural precursor analogs. Early investigations into the promiscuity of individual enzymes were followed by heterologous enzyme expression for directly introducing unnatural elements into MIA precursors16. In a landmark study, two tryptophan halogenases from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes (LaeRebH) and Streptomyces rugosporus (SruPyrH) were expressed in the MIA-producing plant Catharanthus roseus, resulting in de novo production of chlorinated and brominated MIAs. Yet, as these new-to-nature chemical spaces include both regioselective considerations and choice of halogen, it remains a challenge to mitigate barriers within new-to-nature chemistries in slow-growing plants with limited genetic tractability. Likewise, regioselective chemical halogenation of pharmacophores and total chemical synthesis are complicated due to the numerous stereocenters often found in natural products, not to mention the difficulties of scaling up production once a lead has been identified17. Here, the advanced genetic toolbox, short generation times and amenable metabolism of S. cerevisiae for de novo production of strictosidine (5a) and heteroyohimbine MIAs9,11 makes this chassis ripe for systematically exploring and prototyping whole-cell biocatalysis of new-to-nature MIA chemistries.\nIn this work, we report the engineering of yeasts for de novo production of bioactive alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a) and demonstrate their utility for exploring enzyme promiscuity and metabolic limitations in refactored biosynthetic pathways while producing MIA derivatives. Ultimately, this approach enabled the biosynthesis of 19 halogenated heteroyohimbines (1a\u2013i and 2a\u2013l) and de novo biosynthesis of chloroalstonine (1f)."

For the establishment of a microbial platform for producing alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a), we initially characterized the promiscuity of the two heteroyohimbine dehydrogenases C. roseus THAS1 (CroTHAS1) and C. roseus HYS (CroHYS) in yeast.

Here, alstonine (1a) production was critically affected by this change of scale, with titers below 0.1 mg liter\u20131 (Extended Data Fig. 3). Acknowledging the reported positive contribution to P450-mediated biocatalysis23, we decided to delete ROX1, a gene encoding a repressor of the heme biosynthetic gene HEM13, in Sc112 yielding strain ScH144. In microbioreactor fermentations, ScH144 produced almost 60% more alstonine (1a) than Sc112 (16.7 \u00b1 1.33 versus 9.9 \u00b1 0.13 mg liter\u20131) when medium was supplemented with bovine peptone (Supplementary Fig. 5)11. Strain ScH144 was fed under a pulsed strategy instead of an exponential strategy given the better production yield observed on glucose during the batch phase in the 2-liter bioreactor with the parental strain Sc112 (1.7 versus 0.8 \u00b5g g\u20131). Interestingly, this restored alstonine (1a) biosynthesis, reaching 3.6 mg liter\u20131 after 185 h (Supplementary Fig. 6). In agreement with the positive effect of ethanol substrate on terpene synthesis previously reported for geraniol (9) and sesquiterpenes, we finally replaced glucose by ethanol as a yeast carbon source24. Pulsing ethanol to ScH144 during fed-batch phase in the 2-liter bioreactor further increased alstonine titer (up 4.9 mg liter\u20131), thus reaching the concentration obtained in the microbioreactor with Sc112 (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Using the spent medium, we performed a four-step purification process (Methods) and purified 2 mg of alstonine (1a) at 95% purity (Extended Data Fig. 4). Last, purified alstonine (1a; 0.3 mg) was analyzed by 1H NMR to validate the structure of the isolated product compared to an authentic alstonine (1a) standard, corroborating mass spectrometry (MS) data from broth (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6).\nTaken together, combinatorial engineering of heteroyohimbine biosynthetic pathways in yeast combined with scalable bioprocess optimization enabled de novo production of MIAs at the milligram scale."

Furthermore, the anxiolytic properties of alstonine (1a) have been shown to be reverted in mice pretreated with a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist\n25. To assess the potential bioactivity of alstonine (1a), we first adopted a previously developed antagonist assay against the epinephrine-activated ADRA2A GPCR expressed in yeast cells26. To do so, we first estimated the half-maximum effective concentration of epinephrine against the ADRA2A receptor expressed in yeast cells as 14 \u00b1 2 \u00b5M, with a 95% confidence interval (CI95) of 11.5\u201316.6 \u00b5M (Fig. 2a). Next, we co-incubated ADRA2A-expressing yeast cells (Sc272) with 50 \u00b5M epinephrine and different dosages of the known ADRA2A antagonist yohimbine17 or alstonine (1a). We found that alstonine is a weak antagonist of ADRA2A with a half-maximal inhibitory\nconcentration (IC50) of 59 \u00b1 20 \u00b5M (CI95 of 39.0\u201379.3 \u00b5M), whereas yohimbine exerted an IC50 of 0.13 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5M (CI95 of 0.089\u20130.181 \u00b5M) against ADRA2A (Fig. 2a). Next, based on the possible link between the anxiolytic effects of alstonine and the 5-HT2A/5-HT2C GPCRs in rodents\n25, we were interested to further explore possible direct drug targets of alstonine. As the 5-HT2 GPCRs have not been functionalized in yeast\n27, we expressed 5-HT2C in mammalian COS7 cells and tested alstonine activity in the presence and absence of the cognate 5-HT2C agonist serotonin. Here, we observed alstonine as a weak antagonist of the 5-HT2C receptor, albeit no IC50 could be reported for the concentration range available (Fig. 2b).\nIn summary, bioactivity testing of purified alstonine (1a) from fermentation-based manufacturing identifies alstonine as a possible antagonist of ADRA2A and 5-HT2C GPCRs."

Comparing the ability of MIA-CM-3 and MIA-CM-10 to convert a panel of 18 fluorinated, chlorinated and brominated indoles (10b\u201310s) into halogenated strictosidine (5b\u20135n) revealed that the native tryptophan synthase (encoded by TRP5) can combine all indole tested derivatives with serine (Extended Data\nFig. 7a,b). Although the bromotryptophan (11j\u201311m) spectra did not correlate with that of the tryptophan standard (11a), the presence of 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-bromotryptamine (7j\u20137m) analogs in MIA-CM-10 infers the production of the corresponding bromotryptophans (11j\u201311m; Extended Data Fig. 7b). The demonstration of haloindoles as a viable feedstock for microbial production of halogenated tryptagenic compounds is noteworthy as indole derivatives are substantially cheaper and more accessible than tryptophan or tryptamine derivatives used in previous feeding studies30. Furthermore, although CroTDC in MIA-CM-3 was observed to accept all the smaller fluoro and difluoro substitutions, the enzyme showed a strong preference for substitutions at C4 for the larger chloro substitution, and no bromotryptamine (7j\u20137m) could be positively identified (Extended Data Fig. 7c). More promisingly, RgnTDC retained the broad promiscuity reported in vitro, allowing us to report additional promiscuity for 5-, 6- and 7-fluorotryptophan (7b\u20137d) as well as the six different difluorotryptophans (7n\u20137s;29 Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 8). Despite this, the extra larger halotryptamines produced by MIA-CM-10 were not generally accepted by CroSTR, meaning MIA-CM-3 and MIA-CM-10 each produced seven strictosidine derivatives (5b\u20135j; Extended Data Fig. 7). Based on the broader production of halotryptamines, RgnTDC was selected for further use as the higher general promiscuity was regarded as beneficial for exploring the range of halogenated alstonines possible to produce in a microbial chassis.\nBecause of the negative growth effects on yeast when supplementing halogenated indoles to the cultivation medium (Supplementary\nFig. 7), supplementation was performed following biomass accumulation. Likewise, RgnTDC expression was placed under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1 (Sc154) to minimize incorporation of endogenous tryptophan (11a) into the MIA pathway before indole feeding. As a further pull on halogenated intermediates toward alstonine analogs, we also introduced CroSS and an additional copy of CroTHAS under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (Sc156).\nNature Chemical Biology | Volume 19 | December 2023 | 1551\u20131560 1555\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-023-01430-2\nLast, in strain Sc156, we engineered inducible expression of CroSLS (GAL1 promoter) and overexpression of INO2 (TEF1 promoter; Sc159) to mitigate the CroSLS bottleneck and deleted ROX1 (Sc161) to support P450 enzymes in the pathway23. Of these strains, Sc161 produced the most fluoroalstonine (1b) in a pilot experiment (Supplementary Fig. 8a) and had the highest signal achieved after 144 h of cultivation (Supplementary Fig. 8b). After feeding the larger 18-membered panel of indole derivatives (10b\u201310s) to Sc161, eight peaks with masses corresponding to 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-fluorinated analogs (1b\u20131e), the 7-chlorinated (1f) and 7-brominated analogs (1g) and 5,6-difluoroalstonine (1i) and 6,7-difluoroalstonine (1h) were identified (Fig. 3a). Importantly, all eight alstonine analogs shared the same tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra fragmentation pattern as the alstonine standard and the stereoisomer serpentine31(Fig. 3b,c), and the expected isotopic patterns were observed (Extended Data Fig. 8). The detection of all MIA derivatives is summarized in Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 9.\nFollowing these findings, cultivations of an Sc154-equivalent serpentine-producing strain expressing CroHYS instead of CroTHAS (ScH125; Fig. 1a) resulted in the detection of 11 halogenated serpentine analogs (2b\u20132l; Extended Data Figs. 8 and 10a\u2013d), of which 9 have not been previously reported. The higher number of detected serpentine analogs could be due to CroHYS having either higher overall activity or promiscuity or CroSS having higher promiscuity for ajmalicine derivatives than for THA derivatives. Surprisingly, we observed two distinct peaks in all the halogenated serpentine spectra (Extended Data Fig. 10a). We attribute this to the mixed product profile of CroHYS (Extended Data Fig. 1a), which possibly produces both ajmalicine (4a) and THA (3a), resulting in both haloalstonine and haloserpentine formation in strain ScH125.\nBeyond the detection of novel halogenated MIAs produced in yeast fed with secologanin (6) and haloindoles (10b\u201310s), quantitative\nanalysis of MIA pathway intermediates can enable elucidation of biocatalytic bottlenecks. First, a severe bottleneck can be inferred at the Pictet\u2013Spengler reaction catalyzed by CroSTR, as, although all 18 tryptamine derivatives (7b\u20137s) are detected, only 12 of these result in a heteroyohimbine analog with a signal strength sufficient for obtaining an MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Fig. 9). Of these, the tryptamine derivatives turned over by CroSTR are either small (all fluorotryptamines (7b\u20137e) and difluorotryptamines (7n\u20137s)) or positioned on C7 (7-chlorotryptamine (7f) and 7-bromotryptamine (7j)). The higher promiscuity of CroSTR at C7 is in line with previously reported in vitro results14, as clashes occur between larger Cl and Br atoms on indole positions C4, C5 and C6 with the CroSTR binding site in which the reactive amine moiety is positioned within 2.5 \u00c5 of the catalytic glutamate residue32.\nIn addition to the steric constraints imposed by CroSTR promiscuity, secologanin (6) availability also globally restricts flux through this enzymatic step9, and competition with natural tryptamine (7a) further reduces derivative production (Fig. 4a). Here, unless supplemented at 0.25 mM or heterologously produced by all the strains characterized, secologanin (6) was not detectable after 144 h of cultivation (Fig. 4b), and supplementation significantly increased fluoroalstonine (1b\u20131e) signals (Fig. 4c). With respect to the production of alstonine (1a) derivatives, when the cultivation medium was supplemented with 0.25 mM secologanin, fluoroalstonine signals also increased significantly (P < 10\u22124; Fig. 3b). In summary, secologanin (6) availability has a global limiting effect on both natural MIA and derivative production. However, the effect on production of derivatized MIAs is compounded by low CroSTR promiscuity, meaning that they are outcompeted by underivatized tryptamine for reaction with secologanin (Fig. 3c).\nIn summary, this study enabled the microbial production of 8 alstonines (1b\u20131i) and 11 serpentines (2b\u20132l), 9 of which have not been\nof alstonine. b, Dose\u2013response curves of 5-HT2C with the agonist serotonin (left; R2 = 0.892) and alstonine with and without 0.5 \u00b5M competing serotonin (right; R2 = 0.792 and 0.913). cAMP levels were monitored using BRET in COS7 cells, and data are reported for biological duplicates (n = 2).

Additionally, systematic analysis of pathway intermediates demonstrated production of THA (3b\u20133i), ajmalicine (4b\u20134l) and strictosidine aglycone (20b\u201320n) derivatives, while at the same time elucidating limiting metabolic reactions restricting the halogenation of bioactive MIAs."

            "text": "To explore the potential of producing new-to-nature MIAs without the need for supplementation of halogenated indoles or secologanin, we next sought to engineer yeast for de novo production of halogenated MIAs. To do so, we integrated a galactose-inducible halogenase expression cassette consisting of the FAD-dependent tryptophan halogenase LaeRebH33 and the FAD reductase EcoSsuE34 from L. aerocolonigenes and Escherichia coli, respectively, into Sc161 (ScH132; Fig. 5a). LaeRebH has been shown to catalyze regiospecific bromination and chlorination at C7 of tryptophan and has been previously expressed in C. roseus16, resulting in the production of halogenated MIAs in planta and the production of halotryptamine in yeast35. However, when ScH132 is cultivated at 30 \u00b0C with 100 mg liter\u20131 tryptophan (11a) and 300 mM\nNaCl, only chlorotryptophan (11f) and chlorotryptamine (7f) were observable, yet no downstream chlorinated intermediates were seen (Fig. 5b). As chloroalstonine (1f) was previously identified (Fig. 3b,c,d) and natural alstonine (1a) was also present in the broth, we reasoned that the limiting factor in chloroalstonine (1f) production was chlorotryptamine (7f) competition with natural tryptamine (7a; Fig. 5b). This hypothesis was addressed by increasing halogenase activity. Functional expression of tryptophan halogenases, such as LaeRebH, is notoriously hard to achieve heterologously36,37. Indeed, testing a recently developed biosensor for misfolded protein expression in yeast38 suggested that a proportion of this enzyme population aggregates in the yeast cytoplasm and is most likely not functional (Fig. 5c and Supplementary\nFig. 9). To mitigate this, we repeated the cultivation at a lower temperature (25 \u00b0C compared to 30 \u00b0C), where secologanin (6) production was significantly increased and a peak with an exact mass and retention time consistent with chloroalstonine (1f) was detected in the broth from ScH132, albeit with a signal strength too low to obtain a fragmentation pattern required for positive identification (Fig. 5b). However, the chlorotryptamine (7f) signal was only mildly improved,\nfluoroalstonine, chloroalstonine and bromoalstonine. c, Peak assignments for alstonine MS/MS spectra shown in b. d, Progress of the given substitution through the MIA pathway is indicated by the corresponding colored lines.

Abbreviated enzyme names are stated above the catalyzed reaction.\nNature Chemical Biology | Volume 19 | December 2023 | 1551\u20131560 1557\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-023-01430-2\neven with an extra two copies of the halogenase cassette integrated (Fig. 5b). In a third mitigation approach, we fused a thioredoxin solubility tag to the N terminus of RebH (ScH135)39. After cultivating this strain at 25 \u00b0C, we observed a greater than tenfold improvement in peak area sufficient to obtain an MS/MS spectrum consistent with that of chloroalstonine (1f), resulting in de novo microbial synthesis of a halogenated MIA (Fig. 5b,d,e). To determine if the MIA indole moieties were being directly chlorinated by LaeRebH, as opposed to being derived from chlorotryptophan (11f), we next fed four different heteroyohimbines (ajmalicine (4a), tetrahydroalstonine (3a), serpentine (2a) or alstonine (1a)) to a wild-type strain expressing just the halogenase cassette. In all cases, only chlorotryptophan (11f) was observed (Supplementary Fig. 10), meaning that the chlorine entry point in this refactored pathway is indeed tryptophan (Fig. 5a). Last, an attempt to replicate this result with bromoalstonine (1g) by cultivating ScH135 with 300 mM KBr resulted in the production of bromotryptophan (11j) and bromotryptamine (7j), as reported recently35, and did not yield any further brominated metabolites (data not shown). The larger size of the bromine atom is likely more inhibitory to flux through the pathway, meaning higher bromotryptamine levels (Fig. 3d) or protein engineering will be required to achieve de novo bromoalstonine biosynthesis."

As a proof of principle, we establish biosynthetic pathways for two heteroyohimbines, from which we systematically assess enzyme promiscuity, sterical parameters and metabolic limitations, ultimately enumerating the production of 19 new-to-nature halogenated alstonines and serpentines (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 10d).

This is a particular problem when investigating the ability of natural product pathways to turnover substrate analogs as competing branches can be differentially affected, changing dominant MIA production and complicating efforts to produce specific MIA derivatives in planta16. Characterizing the specific product profiles of these enzymes in a yeast cell factory context (for example, using the method described by Yamamoto et al.12) and understanding their implications for yields and purification strategies will be important future work. Second, the integration of larger halogens is challenging, as evidenced by the particularly poor passage of the bulky bromine-substituted compounds through the MIA pathway (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10d). Likewise, challenges remain regarding secologanin (6) precursor availability and STR promiscuity. Here, further bioprospecting or protein engineering would be warranted42.\nWith this said, enzyme promiscuity can also be an advantage when deploying microbial cell factories as an explorative tool for probing novel regions of chemical space for drug discovery43. Although several studies have previously investigated the promiscuity of MIA pathway enzymes for halogenated derivatives in planta16, in vitro14 and recently in yeast30,35,44, this study expands on prior work in the biosynthesis of\nhalogenated MIA scaffolds by (1) systematically assessing the turnover of a wider range of halogenated derivatives by the seven MIA enzymes separating indole from alstonine (1a) and serpentine (2a; Supplementary Table 8); (2) demonstrating the semisynthesis of 8 derivatives of the bioactive alstonine, including diflourinated MIAs (Fig. 3d), which is notable as successive fluorination has been shown to have additive effects on ligand binding capacity45, and 11 serpentine derivatives (9 of which have not been reported before; Extended Data Fig. 10d) and (3) facilitating further study by demonstrating the utility of cheaper indole substrates as a viable derivative entry point into the MIA pathway. In addition to this, the successful biosynthesis of chloroalstonine using LaeRebH represents the first de novo production of an MIA derivative in yeast (Fig. 5d,e).\nLast, although the fluorinated alstonine (1b\u2013e) and serpentine (2b\u2013e) analogs are interesting due to overrepresentation in medicinal compounds46 and the reported effects on MIA potency4, the integration of chlorine and bromine atoms onto the indole moiety may be of greater long-term impact because, as effective leaving groups, they allow specific targeting of the carbon for further derivatization via chemical cross-coupling to organic groups47.

The column was reequilibrated for ~2 min before the next injection, and the instrument was navigated by MS Workstation software version 8.210.0.253 (Bruker Daltonics). Multiple reaction monitoring data (Supplementary Table 6) were collected by electrospray ionization that operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters: spray voltage of 4.5 kV, cone temperature of 350 \u00b0C, cone gas flow of 20, probe gas flow of 50, nebulizer gas flow of 50, heated probe temperature of 300 \u00b0C, exhaust gas on and a collision-induced dissociation of 1.5 mTorr. Analyte stock solutions were prepared in ethanol for tryptamine, tetrahydroalstonine, ajmalicine, serpentine and alstonine and in Milli-Q water for loganic acid, loganin, secologanin and strictosidine. Ten levels of calibration were prepared, diluting the standard mixture with SC or YPD (Supplementary Table 6). The calibration curves for alstonine and ajmalicine were prepared separately to avoid their interferences on coeluting isomers serpentine and THA, respectively. Caffeine (0.9 mg liter\u20131) was used as an internal standard in standards and samples. The calibration levels were weighted as 1/x, and the curve was fitted by linear regression. When the concentration of MIAs in the samples exceeded the highest concentration used in the calibration curve, the samples were diluted.\nTo confirm the reported activity of CroTHAS1 and CroHYS, when heterologously expressed in yeast, method 2 described by Stavrinides et al.20 was applied. To confirm the identity of alstonine and serpentine, which has the same retention time in the routine LC\u2013MS method applied in this study, we compared LC\u2013MS transition profiles to the ones obtained by high-resolution MS (LC\u2013HRMS). Both standards along with the alstonine de novo producers were included. When the two stereoisomers were compared by both methods, the ratio of the fragment ion 316.9 was comparatively higher for serpentine than alstonine (Extended Data Fig. 6). The analysis of halogenated MIAs was performed on a Vanquish Duo UHPLC binary system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The data were acquired in positive mode with a voltage of 3,500 V, and the rest of the parameters were as described previously by Kildegaard et al.58.\nFor detection of halogenated compounds, LC\u2013MS/MS analysis was performed using a Vanquish Duo UHPLC binary system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was\nNature Chemical Biology\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-023-01430-2\nachieved under reverse-phase conditions as previously described58. The MS measurements were performed in positive-heated electrospray ionization mode with a voltage of 3,500 V acquiring the full MS/MS spectra (data-dependent acquisition-driven MS/MS) in the mass range of 70\u2013100 Da. The following data-dependent acquisition settings were used: automatic gain control target value of 4 \u00d7 105 for full-scan MS and 5 \u00d7 104 for the MS/MS spectral acquisition and a mass resolution of 120,000 for full-scan MS and 30,000 for MS/MS events. Precursor ions were fragmented by stepped high-energy collision dissociation using collision energies of 20, 40 and 60. As a general note, as standards for halogenated MIA analogs are not commercially available, halogenated MIAs were identified based on exact mass and retention times and MS/MS spectra shifts relative to the unhalogenated standard, as previously described30,45,59 (Supplementary Table 9).\nGlucose, ethanol and organic acids Glucose, ethanol and organic acids were analyzed using a Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H+ (8%; 150 \u00d7 7.8 mm) column on a Vanquish dual-system HPLC coupled with a refractive index (IDEX RefractoMax 521) and diode array detector. The HPLC was run with a flow rate of 0.7 ml min\u20131 (isocratic) using 9 mM sulfuric acid at a column temperature of 60 \u00b0C. The injection loop volume was kept to 5 \u00b5l for all samples and standards. For diode array detection, a 210-nm wavelength was used for detection and confirmation of organic acids. Peak identification was based on the relative retention times determined by injection of standard solutions. Quantification of compounds was performed using calibration curves on Chromeleon software, version 7.2.8."

First, for liquid\u2013liquid extraction, cultivation broth from controlled bioreactors was collected based on centrifugation and collection of 1.5 liters of supernatant. Next, two rounds of liquid\u2013liquid extraction with 1:1 dichloromethane:broth were performed, and the aqueous phase was concentrated by vacuum. For silica pretreatment, the dried extract was solubilized with water and methanol and then a normal phase of silica (Fuji Silysia, Chromatorex GS60 20/45 \u00b5m). Following subsequent homogenization, this solution was concentrated under vacuum to give a dry extract, and the dried extract was purified using silica gel (Fuji Silysia, Chromatorex GS60 20/45 \u00b5m) column chromatography with a different ratio of methylene chloride:methanol (100:0\u20130:100), yielding the first crude alstonine extract. Fractions containing alstonine were then pooled and concentrated to dryness, from which the amount of product was approximately 4 g with a purity of alstonine at 250 nm of <1%. Following this, the first LC step of purification was performed with a Dynamic Axial Column with a 50-mm diameter. The silica gel used was Kromasil C18 5 \u00b5m (300 g), with a mobile phase consisting of water with 0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile (80:20 (vol/vol)) and washing solvent consisting of 70:30 (vol/vol) formic acid:acetonitrile and a flow rate of 70 ml min\u20131. For diode array-based detection, a 250-nm wavelength was used for detection. All fractions containing alstonine were pooled, dry distilled and concentrated under vacuum. From this, 100 mg of alstonine was recovered with 10% relative purity by HPLC. Last, a second step of purification was performed on a semipreparative system. Here, the silica gel used was Aquasil C18 5 \u00b5m (250 \u00d7 20 mm), with a mobile phase consisting of water with 0.1% formic acid:methanol (65:35 (vol:vol)) and washing solvent consisting of 20:80 (vol:vol) formic acid:acetonitrile. The flow rate was fixed at 8 ml min\u20131. For diode array-based detection, a 250-nm wavelength was used. For the second purification step, the quantity injected was fixed at 50 mg per run, and all fractions containing alstonine were again pooled, dry distilled and concentrated under vacuum.

Sc272 was generated by changing the superfolder GFP reporter to NanoLuc and integrating ADRA2A in the base strain yWS2267 (ref. 65). This design was inspired by the similar ADRA2A-sensing yeast described in ref. 26, and the luciferase assay was performed essentially as previously reported66. Before the bioactivity assay, Sc272 was inoculated from cryostock into 5 ml of SC-tryptophan and incubated overnight at 30 \u00b0C and 250 r.p.m. Next, 2 ml of culture was centrifuged at 5,000g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in pH-buffered SC-tryptophan at pH 7.2. The OD600 was measured and adjusted to 1.25 before 40 \u00b5l was distributed to sterile 96-well plates (Greiner, 655101) and covered with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Diversified Biotech BEM-1). The plates were incubated for 2 h at 30 \u00b0C and 250 r.p.m. before the membrane was removed. Then, 5 \u00b5l of 12 different 10\u00d7 stock concentrations of epinephrine, yohimbine or alstonine containing 10% (vol/vol) DMSO was added in triplicate series. Milli-Q water (5 \u00b5l) was then added to the wells with epinephrine, whereas 5 \u00b5l of 500 \u00b5M epinephrine in Milli-Q water was added to wells with alstonine or yohimbine. The plates were covered again and incubated for 4 h at 30 \u00b0C and 250 r.p.m. Twenty minutes before incubation was completed, a lysis mix of 1.33% (vol/vol) furimazine (NanoLuc substrate) from Promega in CelLytic Y cell lysis reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed, and 15 \u00b5l was distributed to wells of a white, small-volume 96-well plate (Greiner, 675083). Following incubation, the plate was vortexed for 5 s before the membrane was removed, 5 \u00b5l of each well containing sensing cells was transferred to the plate containing the lysis mix, and the plate was immediately placed\nin a SynergyMX microtiter plate reader (BioTek). Luminescence was measured at 12, 13.5 and 15 min after mixing. The settings were filter luminescence, with a gain of 110 and 0.5-s integration per well; the average of each of the time points is reported as single replicates per well.\nFor the bioactivity assay of alstonine on the 5-HT2C receptor conducted in COS7 cells, the level of cAMP was monitored using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). This method is based on a construct consisting of a cAMP-binding protein (exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac)), which is flanked by a BRET pair (Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and YFP). Together, this complex is called cAMP sensor using YFP\u2013Epac\u2013Rluc (CAMYEL)67. cAMP production is sensed as Epac changes conformation in response to the increasing levels of cAMP, leading to a loss of BRET intensity. COS7 cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated, white 96-well plates (20,000 cells per well). The following day, cells were transfected in 100 \u00b5l of transfection medium per well consisting of 20 \u00b5g of plasmid pFH78 and 100 \u00b5g of CAMYEL per 10 ml of medium for a total of 5 h and thereafter incubated in 100 \u00b5l of growth medium overnight. The next day, cells were washed twice with 100 \u00b5l of HBSS per well (Gibco, Life Technologies) and preincubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C with 60 \u00b5l of HBSS. The luciferase substrate coelenterazine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and, after a 5-min incubation, a baseline was measured. Ligands were added, and measurements were recorded every minute for 30 min using a CLARIOstar Plus plate reader. The BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 535 nm (citrine) to the emission intensity at 475 nm (luciferase). Determinations were made in triplicate. Dose\u2013response curves were generated using the non-linear regression function in GraphPad Prism version 9.5.0 for Windows from GraphPad Software. For the ADRA2A receptor, the model used the variable slope setting, whereas the model for 5-HT2C assumed Hill coefficients of 1 and \u22121 for stimulation and inhibition curves, respectively."
