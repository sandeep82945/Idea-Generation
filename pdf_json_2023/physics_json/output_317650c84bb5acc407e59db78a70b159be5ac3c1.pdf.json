    "abstractText": "Metal ions are essential cofactors for many proteins and play a crucial role in many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein-protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, tether to the protein using strong interactions, and have favorable catalytic properties. Computational design of metalloproteins is however hampered by the complex electronic structure of many biologically relevant metals such as zinc . In this work, we develop two tools Metal3D (based on 3D convolutional neural networks) and Metal1D (solely based on geometric criteria) to improve the location prediction of zinc ions in protein structures. Comparison with other currently available tools shows that Metal3D is the most accurate zinc ion location predictor to date with predictions within 0.70 \u00b1 0.64\u00c5 of experimental locations. Metal3D outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site and works on proteins with few homologes in the protein data bank. Metal3D predicts a global zinc density that can be used for annotation of computationally predicted structures and a per residue zinc density that can be used in protein design workflows. Currently trained on zinc, the framework of Metal3D is readily extensible to other metals by modifying the training data.",

            "text": "Metal3D: a general deep learning framework for accurate metal ion location prediction in proteins\nSimon L. D\u00fcrr 1, Andrea Levy 1 & Ursula Rothlisberger 1\nMetal ions are essential cofactors for many proteins and play a crucial role in many applications such as enzyme design or design of protein-protein interactions because they are biologically abundant, tether to the protein using strong interactions, and have favorable catalytic properties. Computational design of metalloproteins is however hampered by the complex electronic structure of many biologically relevant metals such as zinc . In this work, we develop two tools - Metal3D (based on 3D convolutional neural networks) and Metal1D (solely based on geometric criteria) to improve the location prediction of zinc ions in protein structures. Comparison with other currently available tools shows that Metal3D is the most accurate zinc ion location predictor to date with predictions within 0.70 \u00b1 0.64\u212b of experimental locations. Metal3D outputs a confidence metric for each predicted site and works on proteins with few homologes in the protein data bank. Metal3D predicts a global zinc density that can be used for annotation of computationally predicted structures and a per residue zinc density that can be used in protein design workflows. Currently trained on zinc, the framework of Metal3D is readily extensible to other metals by modifying the training data.\nMetalloproteins are ubiquitous in nature and are present in all major enzyme families1,2.The metals predominantly found in biological systems are the first and second row alkali and earth alkali metals and the first row transition metals such as zinc and copper. Zinc is the most common transition metal (present in ~10% of deposited structures) and can fulfill both a structural (e.g. in zinc finger proteins) or a catalytic role in up to trinuclear active sites. Zn2+ is an excellent Lewis acid and is most often found in tetrahedral, pentavalent, or octahedral coordination. About 10%of all reactions catalyzed by enzymes use zinc as cofactor3.\nMetalloproteins are well studied because metal cofactors are essential for the function of many proteins and loss of this function is an important cause of diseases4. Industrial applications for metalloproteins capitalize on the favorable catalytic properties of the metal ion where the protein environment dictates (stereo)-selectivity5\u20137. To crystallize proteins, metal salts are also often added to the\ncrystallization buffer as they can help in the formation of protein crystals overcoming the enthalpic cost of association of protein surfaces. Metal ion binding sites can be used to engineer protein-protein interactions (PPI)8\u201310 and the hypothesis has been put forward that one origin of macromolecular complexity is the superficial binding of metal ions in early single domain proteins10.\nWhile simple metal ion binding sites can be rapidly engineered because initial coordination on a protein surface can for example be achieved by creating an i, i+4 di-histidine site on an alpha-helix11 or by placing cysteines in spatial proximity12, the engineering of complex metal ion binding sites e.g. in the protein interior is considerably more difficult2,9 as such sites are often supported by a network of hydrogen bonds. A complication for computational design of metalloproteins is the unavailability of good (non-bonded) force fields for zinc and other transition metals that accurately reproduce (e.g. tetrahedral) coordination with the correct coordination distances which renders design\nReceived: 30 August 2022\nAccepted: 29 March 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry,Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. e-mail: ursula.roethlisberger@epfl.ch\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nusing e.g. Rosetta very difficult2,13. In fact, the latest parametrization of the Rosetta energy function (ref2015)14 did not refit the parameters for the metal ions which originally are from CHARMM27 with empirically derived Lazaridis-Karplus solvation terms. To adequately treat metal sites in proteins quantum mechanical treatments such as in hybrid quantummechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations15,16 is needed whose computational cost is prohibitive for regular protein design tasks. QM/MM simulations can however be used to verify coordination chemistry for select candidate proteins17. On the other hand, neural networkpotentials havebeendeveloped for zinc however those require the experimental zinc location as input18.\nMany tools exist to predict whether a protein containsmetals (e.g. ZincFinder19), which residues in the protein bind a metal (e.g. IonCom20, MIB21,22) and where the metal is bound (AlphaFill23, FindsiteMetal24, BioMetAll25,MIB21,22). The input for these predictors is based on sequence and/or structure information. Sequence-based predictors use pattern recognition to identify the amino acids which might bind a metal26. Structure-based methods use homology to known structures (MIB, Findsite-metal, AlphaFill) or distance features (BioMetAll) to infer the location of metals. Some tools like Findsitemetal or ZincFinder employ machine learning based approaches such as support vector machines.\nStructure based deep learning approaches have been used in the field of protein research for a variety of applications such as protein structure prediction27,28, prediction of identity of masked residues29\u201331, functional site prediction32,33, for ranking of docking poses34,35, prediction of the location of ligands35\u201339, and prediction of effects of mutations for stability and disease4,40. Current state of the art predictors for metal location areMIB21,22,41, which combines structural and sequence information in the \u201cFragment Transformation Method\u201d to search for homologous sites in its database, and BioMetAll25, a geometrical predictor based on backbone preorganization. Both methods have significant drawbacks: MIB excludes metal sites with less than 2 coordination partners from its analysis and is limited by the availability of templates in its database. We assessed both MIB and MIB2, which significantly extended the database of templates. BioMetAll does not use templates but provides many possible locations for putative binding sites on a regular grid. The individual probes in BioMetAll do not have a confidence metric therefore only allowing to rank sites by the number of probes found, which results in a large uncertainty in the position. Both tools suffer from many false positives. In this work, we present twometal ion locationpredictors that do not suffer from these drawbacks. For both tools, we train solely on zinc and evaluate performance and selectivity for zinc. The deep learning based Metal3D predictor operates on a voxelized representation of the protein environment and predicts a per residue metal density that can be averaged to get a smooth metal probability density over the whole protein. The distance based predictorMetal1D predicts the location of metals using coordination motifs mined from the protein data bank (PDB) directly predicting coordinates of the putative metal binding site. Metal3D paves the way to perform in silico design of metal ion binding sites without relying on predefined geometrical rules or expensive quantum mechanical calculations."

            "text": "Existing metal ion predictors can be subdivided into two categories: binding site predictors and binding location predictors. The former identify only the residues binding the ion, the latter predict the coordinates of the metal ion itself. Both Metal1D and Metal3D can predict the coordinates of putative binding sites. We therefore assessed their performance by comparing to recent binding location predictors with available code/webserver: BioMetAll25,MIB21 (no longer available as of July 2022) and MIB222. The main tuning parameter (see Table S5) of MIB/MIB2 is the template similarity t, with higher values requiring higher similarity of the templates available for the search in structurally homologous metalloproteins. BioMetAll on the other hand was calibrated on available protein structures and places probes on a regular grid at all sites where the criteria formetal binding are fulfilled. The main adjustable parameter for BioMetAll is the cluster cutoff c, which indicates how many probes in reference to the largest cluster a specific cluster has. We used the recommended cutoff of 0.5 requiring all chosen clusters to have at least 50% of the probes of the most populous cluster and used the cluster center to compute distances.\nWe first investigated the potential of all tools to detect the location of a zinc ion binding site in a binary fashion (zinc site or no zinc site). We defined a correctly identified binding site (true positive, TP) as a prediction within 5\u212b of an experimental zinc site. In case a tool predicted no metal within the 5\u212b radius, we counted this site as false negative (FN). False positive (FP) predictions, i.e. sites where a metal was placed spuriously, were clustered in a 5\u212b radius and counted once per cluster. All tools were assessed against the held out test biological assemblies for Metal3D and Metal1D. When the performance of MIB (t = 1.25) and BioMetAll is compared against Metal3D with probability cutoff p =0.75 we find that Metal3D identifiesmore sites (85) thanMIB (78) or BioMetAll (75) with a much lower number of false positives (Fig. 3). MIB predicts 180 false positive sites, MIB2 162 sites, BioMetAll 134 sites whereas Metal3D only predicts 9 false positive sites at the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 2\np =0.75 cutoff. Metal1D (t =0.5) offers similar detection capabilities (78 sites detected) with a lower number of false positives (47) compared toMIB,MIB2 andBioMetAll. BetweenMIB andMIB2 the addition of more templates changed the template similarity (Fig. S6). MIB2 has higher recall for low t-scores but reduced precision (Fig. 3B). We removed 70 sites from the list of zinc sites in the test set (189 total) that had less than 2 unique protein ligands within 2.8\u212b of the experimental zinc location and occupancy < =0.5. The amount of correct predictions in this reduced set is almost unchanged for all tools (Fig. 3) indicating thatmost tools correctly predict sites if they have 2 ormore protein ligands. The number of false negatives is reduced for all tools by about 60 sites indicating that most tools do not predict these\nFig. 1 | Workflow of Metal3D and Metal1D. a Training of Metal3D and Metal1D is based on experimental Zn2+ sites. Metal1D extracts coordination environments from LINK records, Metal3D is a fully convolutional 3DCNN trained to predict the metal density from voxelized protein environments. b In inference mode Metal3D predicts the location of a metal ion by computing per residue metal densities and then averaging them to obtain a global metal density for the input proteins. The\nions can then be placed using the weighted average of voxels above a cutoff. For Metal1D all residues in the protein are scanned for compatibility with the probability map. Metals are placed at the geometric center of residues with high scores according to the probability map. A final ranking of sites is obtained using the probability map.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 3\ncrystallographic artifacts that might depend on additional coordinating residues from an adjacentmolecule in the crystal. We also assessed performance on some examples of wrongly modelled metal ions (wrong identity, missing support in electron density) and crystal artefacts contained in the training set showing that Metal3D only predicts ions that have proper support in the structure with high confidence p >0.75 (Fig. S7) and ignores wronglymodelled ions. Of all tools, Metal3D has the least false positives (1 FP at p =0.9) and the highest number of detected sites (110 at p = 0.25). The single false positive at p =0.9 does not contain a zinc ion but is a calcium binding site with three aspartates and one backbone carbonyl ligand (Fig. S5). For physiological sites with 3+ unique protein ligands Metal3D probabilities are all above 50% (Fig. 3B).\nAfter assessment of how many sites the tools predict, another crucial metric is the spatial precision of the predictions. For the correctly identified sites (TP) we measured the mean absolute deviation (MAD) between experimental and predicted position (Fig. 4a). The MAD for Metal3D at p = 0.9 is 0.70 \u00b10.64 \u212b and 0.74 \u00b10.66\u212b at p =0.25 indicating that low confidence predictions are still accurately placed inside the protein. ThemedianMAD of predictions forMetal3D at p =0.9 is 0.52\u212b indicating that for half of the predictions the model predicts at or better than the grid resolution of 0.5\u212b .\nBioMetAll is not very precise with a MAD for correctly identified sites of 2.71 \u00b1 1.33\u212b . BioMetAll predicts many possible locations per cluster with some of them much closer to the experimental metal binding site than the cluster center. However, it does not provide any\nranking of the probes within a cluster and therefore the cluster center was used for the distance calculation. Metal1D t =0.5 (MAD 2.06 \u00b1 1.33\u212b) which identifies more sites than BioMetAll is also more precise than BioMetAll. MIB t = 1.9 detects sites with high precision (MAD 0.77 \u00b1 1.09\u212b) but it relies on the existence of homologous sites to align the found sites. MIB2 t = 2.5 is less precise (MAD 0.89 \u00b1 1.00\u212b) than MIB."

The use of high resolution structures is necessary because at resolutions greater than the average zinc ligand coordinationdistance (2.2\u212b) the uncertainty of the zinc location noticeably increases52 which would likely hamper the accuracy of the site prediction.\nIn contrast to currently available tools, for Metal3D, it is not necessary to filter the training examples for certain coordination requirements (i.e. only sites with at least 2 protein ligands). Themodel thus sees thewhole diversity of zinc ion sites present in the PDB. Such a\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 6\nmodel is advantageous since metalloprotein design workflows require models to score the full continuum of zinc sites starting from a suboptimal binding site only populated at high metal concentration to a highly organized zinc site in an enzyme with nanomolar metal affinity. The predicted probability can be used as a confidence metric or as an optimization target where mutations are made to increase probability of zinc binding."

To reduce the amount of artifactual sites in the training set we presented the model with as many complete sites as possible by using crystal symmetry to add adjacent coordinating protein chains (e.g. 4HTM in Fig. S7). The frequency of artifacts in the training set is therefore much lower than 30%. The sites which still remain incomplete or that are wronglymodeled (e.g. 5ZZU in Fig. S7) and not excluded through the resolution cutoffs and filtering procedures likely present only a small fraction of the training set and their signal is drowned out by the numerical superiority of the correctly modeled sites. Deep learning models have been shown to be robust to noisy datasets54 and Figure S7 highlights that Metal3D ignores issues with data quality (i.e. wrongly assigned metals or crystal artefacts it was trained on). If the model is used on artifactual sites or partially disordered ones it can still predict themetal location with high spatial accuracy but often indicates a lower confidence for the prediction (Figs. 2 and 5). For the identification of physiological sites a probability cutoff of p > 0.75 and the biological assembly of a structure should be used. For in crystallo sites the biological assembly and all symmetry adjacent structures and the same cutoff should be used.\nMetal ion locators that rely on homology such as MIB perform worse on partial binding sites because reducing the quality of the available templates by including 1- or 2-coordinate sites would yield many false positives (similar to including less homologous structures for the template search). The deep learning based Metal3D can likely circumvent this because it does not require any engineered features to predict the location of the metal and learns directly from a full representation of the environment surrounding the binding site. This allows looking at low confidence sites in the context of a given environment."

In addition, other potential sources of input such as AlphaFold do not provide explicit waters whereforemodels should not rely onwater as an input source. It is also not possible to use in silico water predictions because common water placement algorithms to place deep waters39,56,57 either rely on metal ions being present in the input or ignore them completely. Moreover, in protein design algorithms, water is usually only implicitly modeled (e.g. in Rosetta).\nFor Metal3D, the input channel that encodes the total heavy atom density also encodes an implicit water density where all empty space can be interpreted as the solvent. For Metal1D, the contribution of water molecules is considered in an implicit way when the score is assigned to a site by considering coordinations including water compatiblewith the one observed (e.g. aHIS3Wat site is equivalent to aHis3 site for the scoring)."

Similar approaches have been used in the more general field of protein-ligand docking where a variety of architectures and representations have been used. 3D CNN based approaches such as LigVoxel37 and DeepSite36 commonly use a resolution of 1\u212b and similar input features as our model to predict the ligand density. However, predicting the density of a multi-atomic ligand is more complex than predicting the density of mononuclear metal ions. We therefore did not deem it necessary to include a conditioning on howmany zinc ions are present in the box and rather chose to reflect this in the training datawhere the model needs to learn that only about half of the environments it sees contain one or more zincs. This choice is validated by the fact that the output probability densities at sufficiently high probability cutoffs are spherical with their radius approximately matching the van der Waals radius of zinc. For multi-nuclear sites the densities are also well reproduced but the clustering step requires higher probability cutoffs to separate the densities for individual ions (Fig. S8).\nMesh convolutional neural networks trained on a protein surface representation35 also have been used to predict the location and identity of protein ligands but this approach can only label the regions of the surface that bind the metal ion and is conceptually not able to return the exact location of themetal. Somemetal ion binding sites are also heavily buried inside proteins as they mediate structural stability rendering them inaccessible to a surface based approach. The most recent approaches such as EquiBind38 use equivariant neural networks such as En-Transformer58 to predict binding keypoints (defined as 1/2 distance between the C\u03b1 of the binding residue and a ligand atom). Explicit side chains are still too expensive for such models and these models assume a fixed known stoichiometry of the protein and ligand. Metal3D can also deal with proteins that do not bind a zinc and does not assume that the amount of ions is known. The lack of explicit side chain information renders equivariant models unsuitable for the design of complex metal ion binding sites supported by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds that need to be positioned with subangstrom accuracy. The framework of our model in contrast is less data- and compute-efficient than approaches representing the protein as graph due to the need to voxelize the input and provide different rotations of the input environment in training but the overall processing time for ourmodel is still low taking typically 25 seconds for a 250 residue protein on a multicore GPU workstation (20 CPUs, GTX2070).

            "text": "In terms of selectivity, Metal3D has a clear preference for transition metals over main group metals after having been trained exclusively on zinc binding sites with recall and precision highest for zinc (Fig. 4B). For Metal3D environments that do not bind zinc but other metals are sampled as non-zinc binding and themethod theoretically can learn to distinguish zinc fromnon-zincmetal sites.However, this is not the case and the method also predicts other metals (Fig. 4B) with high recall and precision. We attribute this to the general promiscuity of transitionmetal ionbinding61 in thatmostproteins select themetal they bind according to the Irving-Williams series in competitive binding conditions with metal selectivity in general not enforced by the binding site itself but rather by external factors such as compartmentalization or metallochaperones61. The only sites that Metal3D identifies for nontransition metals are the ones that have at least partial side chain coordination. Many sodium and potassium sites are using backbone carbonyl coordination exclusively, which is not common for zinc and those sites are therefore not detected even if they were included in the training data due to wrong labeling in the PDB (e.g. 5ZZU Fig. S7). The high recall for most other transition metals is therefore related to the fact that those binding sites have sidechains in similar conformation compared to zinc sites. Metal3D could be rapidly adapted to predict not only location but also the identity of the metal similar to recent work by Mohamadi et al.62. In the framework of Metal3D a semantic metal prediction would be possible where the same model predicts different output channels for eachmetal it was trained on. To achieve perfect selectivity using such a model will be difficult because sometimes non-native metals are used for crystallization experiments and most other transition metals have less structures available. For Metal1D selectivity will be harder to include in the method without modification as coordination environment (the only trainable parameter ofMetal1D) is only somewhat selective toward zinc. In this work, we chose to work exclusively with zinc because it is the most redox stable transition metal and because many training examples are available and establish a conceptual framework how selectivity could be included showing that the implicit way of training on zinc and nonzinc environments is not enough to enforce strict zinc selectivity."

As the model computes a probability density per residue it can be readily integrated into established software like Rosetta relying on rotamer sampling.\nThe HCA2 application demonstrates the utility of Metal3D for protein engineering (Fig. 2). The thermodynamics ofmetal ion binding to proteins are complicated63 and there are currently no highthroughput based experimental approaches that could generate a dataset large enough to train a model directly on predicting Kd. The data we use were obtained from a colorimetric assay with very high affinity of zinc in the picomolar range64\u201368. More recent studies using ITC63 instead of the colorimetric assay indicate lower Kd values in the nanomolar range for wild type HCA2.

Also, the positioning of sites is somewhat imprecise. This demonstrates the inherent limitation of using solely distance based features for prediction of metal location. BioMetAll which is the toolmost similar toMetal1D also suffers frommany false positive predictions with even worse performance compared to Metal1D. In contrast,Metal1D ismore data-efficient thanMetal3D and provides predictions faster. For large structural databases Metal1D could be run as a prefilter step to then provide high-accuracy predictions using Metal3D. While the MIB method produced decent results when a high template cutoff is used, for the updated MIB2 tool, we find no systematic improvement with only slightly higher recall even if the template database for zinc was extended from 499 to 2446 templates. MIB no longer is available and for MIB2 highthroughput analysis is not possible since a standalone or source code is not available and the webserver blocks multiple concurrent jobs. Metal3D is therefore the only tool that can provide high-quality interpretable predictions in reasonable time (ca. 25 seconds on aGPU workstation for a 250 aa protein). Metal1D while not as accurate as Metal3D is very fast and can be applied to large structural databases. While Metal3D currently is trained only on zinc it offers detection capabilities also for other transitionmetals at slightly lower recall and precision and the framework of the method could be readily extended to also provide identity of the predicted locations similar to recent work by Mohamadi et al.62. We therefore anticipate different applications for Metal3D such as protein-function annotation of structures predicted using AlphaFold272, integration in protein design software and detection of cryptic metal binding sites that can be used to engineer PPIs. Such cryptic metal ion binding sites in common drug targets could also be used to engineer novel metallodrugs. Many of these applications will allow us to explore the still vastly untapped potential of proteins as large multi-dentate metal ligands with programmable surfaces."

            "text": "The input PDB files for training were obtained from the RCSB73 protein databank (downloaded 5th March 2021). We use a clustering of the structures at 30% sequence identity using mmseqs274 to largely remove sequence and structural redundancy in the input dataset. For each cluster, we check whether a zinc is contained in one of the structures, whether the resolution of these structures is better than 2.5\u212b, if the experimental method is x-ray crystallography and whether the structure does not contain nucleic acids. If there are multiple structures fulfilling these criteria, the highest resolution structure is used. All structures larger than 3000 residues arediscarded.Wealways use the first biological assembly to sample the training environments. The structures were stripped of all exogenous ligands except for zinc. If there are multiple models with e.g. alternative residue conformations for a given structure, the first one is used. For each biological assembly we used the symmetry of the asymmetric unit to generate a protein structure that contains all neighboring copies of the protein in the crystal such that metal sites at crystal contacts are fully coordinated. Statistics of the training and test set are provided in Figures S9-19.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 8\nThe train/val/test split was performed based on sequence identity using easy-search in mmseqs2. All proteins that had no (partial) sequence overlap with any other protein in the dataset were put into the test/val set (85 proteins) which we further split into a test set of 59 structures and a validation set of 26 structures. The training set contained 2085 structures. (Supplemental Data S1).\nFor the analysis, we always used the biological assembly and not the symmetry augmented structure. For the selectivity analysis with respect to othermetals, clusters from the PDBwere randomly sampled to extract 100 biological assemblies per metal except for FE2 (57), NI (93), CU (68) and CO (30).\nBy default all zinc sites in the test and validation set were used for the analysis. Since some of the sites might be affected by the crystallization conditions, we also created a subset of all sites that contained at least 2 amino acid ligands to largely exclude crystallization artifacts. To analyzemetal ion selectivity, we selected sites with at least 3 unique protein ligands to only use biologically significant sites with a high degree of metal preorganization as such sites should exhibit more selectivity for specific metals compared to sites with only 2 unique protein-ligands. For both categories we excluded metal ions that had occupancy < = 0.5\nMetal 1D Metal1D uses a probability map derived from LINK records in protein structures (Fig. 1). The LINK section of a PDB file specifies the connectivity between zinc (or any other ligand) and the amino acids of the protein, and each LINK record specifies one linkage. This is an extension of the approach by Barber-Zucker et al.75, in which LINK records were used to investigate the propensity of transition metals to bind different amino acids.\nUsing the training set we generated a probability map for the propensity of different coordination environments to bind a zinc (e.g. CCCC, CCHH etc.). For each zinc ion the coordination is extracted from theLINK records (Fig. 7A) excluding records involvingonly single amino acids (weak binding sites). Information in the LINK records of eachPDBfile areconverted into aunique coordinationenvironmentby associating one letter code to each amino acid with a LINK with a zinc ion and alphabetically sorting this code. This ensures coordination environments such as CCH and CHC to be considered as equal. Also, LINK records containing water molecules are excluded because of the difficulties in placing water molecules a posteriori in 3D structures when metal ions are present and because data quality of modelled water molecules varies. The probability map contains the counts of coordination environments found and is generated from a list of pdb files, the training set in this case. A jupyter notebook is made available tobe able togenerate aprobabilitymap fromadifferent set of pdbfiles (ProbMapGenerator.ipynb).\nMaking a prediction using Metal1D consists of two main steps (Fig. 7B): Identification of possible metal coordinating residues in the structure via a residue scoring step, and the scoring of putative sites, placed between the identified coordinating residues.\nThe protein structure is analyzed using the BioPandas python library76. To identify coordinating residues, a per residue score is assigned by performing a geometrical search from a reference point, defined as the coordinate of the most probable metal binding atom, within a search radius considered as roughly twice the typical distance between themetal ion and the binding atomof amino acids in proteins (2.2 \u00b1 0.2\u212b as determined from LINK records). The search radius used was 5.5\u212b in order to be able to take into account also deviations from the ideal coordination. In the case of amino acids which present more than one putative coordinating atom, such as e.g. histidine, the mid-point between the donor atoms is used as reference point and the search radius is enlarged accordingly. The atoms used as reference points for each amino acid and the increase in the search radius are reported in Supplemental Table S1. The score is assigned to each\namino acid considering all the other reference points of other amino acids within the search radius, and summing the probabilities in the probability map for coordinations compatible with the one observed. In the ideal case, a score of 1 corresponds to an amino acid surrounded by all possible coordinating amino acids observed in the probability map. In practice, scores result between 0 and <1. Once all amino acids in the chain are scored, the metal location predictions are made grouping the highest-scored amino acids in clusters (defined as the ones within the chosen threshold, i.e. the t parameter, with respect to the highest-scored one) based on distance. This is done using scipy.spatial.distance_matrix and grouping together highestscored amino acids closer than twice the search radius. For each cluster, a putative site is located in space as a weighted average between the coordinates of the reference point of each amino acid, using as weighting factor the amino acid score. For a given cluster ofN high scored residues (with xyz locations {r1, \u2026, rN} and scores {score1, \u2026, scoreN}), the xyz location of the predicted site (rsite) is computed as\nrsite = PN i= 1 scorei \u00d7 ri PN\ni= 1 scorei \u00f01\u00de\nFor isolated amino acids with a high score (e.g. a single histidine) the same score is assigned to the closest reference point from another amino acid, to be able to compute the position of the metal as before, i.e. using aweighted average. In this case themetal will be placed at the midpoint between the highest scored residue (the single element of the cluster) and the amino acid towhich thefictitious score is assigned. Possible artifacts resulting from this fictitious score are resolved in the final step of the prediction.\nAfter the putative site has been placed, a score is assigned by performing a geometrical search centered on the predicted metal coordinates (within 60% of the search radius, i.e 3.3\u212b) and a final score is now assigned to the site. The final score is assigned in the sameway as the amino acid scores based on the probabilitymap, and has the advantage of being able to sort the predicted metal sites based on their frequency in the training set. A cutoff parameter, by default equal to the cutoff used for amino acid scoring (i.e. the t parameter), is used to exclude sites with a probability lower than a certain threshold with respect to the highest-scored one. This final scoring also mitigates the errors which can be introduced by calculating the coordinates of the site simply as a weighted average excluding or assigning a low probability to the site ending in unfavorable positions in space.\nMetal 3D Voxelization. We used the moleculekit python library37,77 to voxelize the input structures into 3D grids. 8 different input channels are used: aromatic, hydrophobic, positive ionizable, negative ionizable, hbond donor, hbond acceptor, occupancy, and metal ion binding site chain (Fig. 8, Supplemental Table S2). The channels are assigned using AutoDockVina atom names and a boolean mask. For each atom matching one of the categories a pair correlation function centered on the atom is used to assign the voxel value37. For the target tensor only the zinc ions were used for the voxelization. The target tensor was discretized setting any voxel above 0.05 to 1 (true location of zinc), all other to 0 (no zinc). We used a box size of 16\u212b centered on the C\u03b1 atom of a residue, rotating each environment randomly for training before voxelization. The voxel grid used a0.5\u212b resolution for the input and target tensors. Any alternative side chain conformations modeled were discarded keeping only the highest occupancy. For the voxelization only heavy atoms were used. For all structures selected for the respective sets we partitioned the residues of the protein into residues within 12\u212b of a zinc ion and those further away (based on the distance to the C\u03b1 atom). A single zinc site will therefore be present\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2713 9\nmany times in the dataset but each time translated and rotated in the box. A balanced set of examples was used sampling equal numbers of residues that are close to a zinc and residues randomly drawn from the non-zinc binding residues. The sampling of residues is based on the biological assembly of the protein, the voxelization is based on the full 3D structure including neighboring asymmetric units in the crystal structure. The environments are precomputed and stored using lxf compression in HDF5 files for concurrent access during training. In total, 252324 environments were voxelized for the training set, 6550 for the test set, 3067 for the validation set. The voxelization was implemented using ray78.\nModel training. We used PyTorch 1.1079 to train the model (Fig. 9). All layers of the network are convolutional layers with filter size 1.5\u212b except for the fifth layer (Conv5 in Fig. 9) where a 8\u212b filter is used to capture long range interactions. We use zero padding to keep the size of the boxes constant. Models were trained on a workstation with NVIDIAGTX3090GPU and 32 CPU cores. BinaryCross Entropy80 loss is used to train themodel. The rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearity is used except for the last layer which uses a sigmoid function that yields the probability for zinc per voxel. A dropout layer (p = 0.1) was used between the 5th and 6th layers. The network was trained using AdaDelta employing a stepped learning rate (lr = 0.5, \u03b3 = 0.9), a batch size of 150, and 12 epochs to train.\nHyperparameter tuning. We used the ray[tune] library78 to perform a hyperparameter search choosing 20 different combinations between\nthe following parameters with the best combination of parameters in bold.\n\u2022 filtersize: 3,4 (in units of 0.5 \u212b) \u2022 dropout : 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 \u2022 learning rate : 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 \u2022 gamma: 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 \u2022 largest dimension 80, 100, 120\nGridAveraging. Themodel takes as input a(8,32,32,32) tensor and outputs a (1,32,32,32) tensor containing the probability density for zinc centered on the C\u03b1 atom of the input residue (last step in Fig. 9). Predictions for a complete protein were obtained by voxelizing select residues of the protein (default all cysteines, histidines, aspartates, glutamates), predicting them individually using the above described model and averaging the boxes using a global grid (Fig. 10). 98% of the metal sites in the training data have at least one of those residues closeby wherefore this significant decrease in computational cost seems appropriate for most uses. The global grid is obtained by computing the bounding box of all points and using a regular spaced (0.5\u212b) grid. For each grid point in the global grid the predicted probability maps within 0.25\u212b of the grid point are averaged. The search is sped up using the KD-Tree implementation in scipy81.\nMetal ion placement. The global probability density is used to performclustering of voxels abovea certainprobability threshold (default p =0.15, cutoff 7\u212b) using AgglomerativeClustering implemented in scikit-learn82 (Fig. 10).

We make available a command line program and interactive notebook allowing theuser to visualize the results. The averaged probability map is stored as a .cube file. The most likely metal coordinates for use in subsequent processing are stored in a .pdb file. The command line program uses VMD83 to visualize the input protein and the predicted density, for the jupyter notebook 3Dmol.js/py3Dmol84 is used."
