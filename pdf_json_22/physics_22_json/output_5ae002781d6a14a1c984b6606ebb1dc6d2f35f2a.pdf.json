The black holes in question are assumed to be immersed in the quintessence field, and subsequently, the resulting black hole shadows are expected to be modified by the presence of the dark energy. We investigate the photon region and the black hole shadow, and in particular, their dependence on the relevant physical conditions such as the state parameter of the quintessence, the angular momentum, and the magnitude of the magnetic charge. It is shown that the photon regions sensitively depend on the horizon structure and possess intricate features. Moreover, from the viewpoint of a static observer, we explore a few observables, especially those associated with the distortion of the observed black hole shadows.\n\u2217yunqiliu@yzu.edu.cn(Corresponding author), wlqian@usp.br, rhyue@yzu.edu.cn\n1"

            "text": "By employing the very long baseline interferometry technique, the image of M87* was recently captured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration [1]. Besides the achievement of another milestone in observing the spacetime geometry of the strong field region in terms of the electromagnetic signals, it leads to a promising future of astrophysics. Based on the Van Cittert\u2013Zernike theorem, the measurements of the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution were accomplished through the correlated signals between distant observatories. As was first pointed out in the literature by Bardeen et al. [2, 3], certain optical features of the image, such as the black hole shadow, are entirely governed by the intrinsic black hole parameters, such as the mass, charge, and angular momentum. As a result, they constitute a direct probe of the compact object. On the practical side, however, at the present stage, the obtained image still largely depends on the specified structure of the accretion disk of the black hole, as well as its dynamics. It is expected, as the planetary scale efforts continue, one might eventually acquire images with substantially better resolution, from which the photon rings can be unambiguously identified. Accordingly, on the theoretical side, the studies of black hole shadow have triggered a wave of renewed interest [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] in recent years.\nThe accelerating expansion of our Universe [17, 18, 19] implies that a significant portion of the energy density is dark, namely, in the form of an exotic fluid of negative pressure. Apart from the cosmological constant \u039b [20, 21], other prescriptions of dark energy consist of different dynamic models. Among others, quintessence [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] provides a dynamical description of dark energy in terms of a minimally coupled sacalr field. Regarding the equation of state p = \u03c9\u01eb, the model\u2019s state parameter \u03c9 usually falls within the range of \u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u2212 13 . In particular, the case \u03c9 = \u22121 is reminiscent of that of a constant cosmological constant.\nIn this regard, the black hole metrics immersed in the quintessence and their respective properties have since been a pertinent topic of study. In [30], Kiselev presented the first Schwarzschild black hole solution with the presence of the quintessence field. Subsequently, by employing the Newman-Janis algorithm [31, 32], Toshmatov et al. further generalized the solution to the rotating case [33]. The corresponding Kerr-Newman-AdS solution was also obtained [34] by Xu et al. by adopting a similar approach. The above solution was refined and further generalized by Wang et al. [35] by scrutinizing the consistency regarding the black hole thermodynamics. More recently, in [36], Benavides-Gallego et al. have considered a magnetically charged rotating black hole surrounded y the quintessence. The authors further analyzed the properties of the event horizons, the ergosphere, and the angular motion of a zero angular momentum observer.\nIn reality, most black holes are not static but rotating and possibly charged. In order to obtain the metric of the rotating black holes, the Newman-Janis algorithm has been extensively explored [33, 34, 36]. The algorithm is a complexification technique for deriving the rotating counterpart from a static solution of the Einstein field equations. The procedure mostly consists of the decomposition of the contravariant components of the static metric in the EddingtonFinkelstein coordinates in terms of a null tetrad, and a complex \u201ctilde\u201d transformation, which generates a new metric. The essential part of the algorithm is the feasibility of encountering a proper null tetrad [36], while the tilde transformation might bring a certain arbitrariness [32]. Besides, the magnetically charged black holes have also been a subject of much attention. The static metric was derived in [37], from which interesting features have been observed at a short distance. The present paper involves an attempt to study the optical properties of the magnetically charged rotating black holes recently derived in [36]. The black holes in question are assumed to be immersed in the quintessence field, and subsequently, the resulting black hole shadows are expected to be modified by the presence of the dark energy. It is noted that in the aforementioned studies, the authors have focused largely on the specific equation of state\n2\nwhere \u03c9 = \u2212 23 . However, it has been pointed out by Abdujabbarov et al. [38] that the shadow of the black hole might be significantly modified due to the presence of quintessence. Therefore, among others, we are interested in exploring the dependence of the optical properties on the state parameter of dark energy in our study.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we briefly discuss the main characteristics of the black hole metric in question. We then proceed to analyze the horizon structure and the photon region as a function of the metric parameters in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 the black hole shadows are calculated and among others, their dependence on the equation of state of the quintessence field are explored. Moreover, in Sec. 4.1, we extend the study to possible observables, and in particular, those associated with the distortion parameters of the black hole shadow. Further discussions and implications of the present study are given in the last section."

It can be derived [36] by applying a modified version of the Newman-Janis method [31, 32] to a static magnetically charged black hole immersed in the quintessence field [37]. The horizons of the black hole are determined by the roots \u2206r = 0. In Fig.1, one shows the behavior of \u2206r and gtt as a function of r. Besides its dependence on the angular momentum of the black hole, it can be shown [36] that the existence of an outer horizon is rather sensitive to the value of the magnetic charge. The shape of the ergosphere, on the other hand, depends on all the black hole parameters, except when it is located on the equatorial plane. In the following section, we proceed to discuss the photon region of the black hole metric."

            "text": "For a black hole, the existence of the photon region is crucial for the construction of its shadow. By definition, the region is filled up by bounded null geodesics [39]. For the specific metric given by Eq. (1), the feasibility of separation of variable implies that such geodesics are spherical1. Subsequently, the boundary of black holes shadow is mostly determined by the unstable photon orbits around the black hole, except for the metastable ones [40]. Indeed, when perturbed, the\n1This is because in such cases, one can derive a one-dimensional effective potential for the radial motion, and as a result, an unstable geodesic corresponds to the maximum of the potential.\n3\nphotons traveling along the unstable orbits of the black holes would either fall onto the event horizon or escape to infinity.\nTo show the geometry near the horizon and the unstable orbits, in this section, we study the trajectories of the spherical null geodesics and the black hole photon region. One starts by writing down the Hamilton Jacobi equation S [41] which governs null geodesic in the spacetime Eq. (1),\n\u2202S \u2202\u03c4 = \u22121 2 g\u00b5\u03bd \u2202S\n\u2202x\u00b5\n\u2202S \u2202x\u03bd , (3)\nwhere \u03c4 is the affine parameter, x\u00b5 represents the four-dimensional coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6). To proceed, we assume that the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation takes the form\nS = 1\n2 m2\u03c4 \u2212 Et+ L\u03c6+ Sr(r) + S\u03b8(\u03b8), (4)\nwhere for time-like geodesics m2 = 1 and for null geodesics m2 = 0. The functions Sr(r) and S\u03b8(\u03b8) univariable, and E and L are constants related to the associated time and azimuthal Killing vectors \u03b6t and \u03b6\u03c6. Plugging the metric tensor of Eq.(1) and the ansatz Eq.(4) into the Hamilton Jacobi equation Eq.(3), one finds\nm2 = (r2 + a2)2 \u2212\u2206ra2 sin2 (\u03b8) \u2206r\u03a3 E2 \u2212 \u2206r csc 2 (\u03b8) \u2212 a2 \u2206r\u03a3 L2\n\u22122a(r 2 + a2)\u2212 2\u2206ra \u2206r\u03a3 EL\u2212 \u2206r \u03a3 ( \u2202Sr(r) \u2202r )2 \u2212 1 \u03a3 ( \u2202S\u03b8(\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8 )2. (5)\n4\nAs a result, the method of separation of variables gives\ndSr(r)\ndr =\n\u221a\nR(r) \u2206r , (6)\ndS\u03b8(\u03b8)\ndr =\n\u221a\n\u0398(\u03b8), (7)\nwhere\nR(r) = (aL\u2212 (a2 + r2)E)2 \u2212 (m2r2 +K)\u2206r, (8) \u0398(\u03b8) = (K \u2212 a2m2 cos2(\u03b8))\u2212 (L csc(\u03b8) \u2212 aE sin(\u03b8))2, (9)\nwhere one introduces the Carter constant K. The resulting form of S reads\nS = 1\n2 m2\u03c4 \u2212 Et+ L\u03c6+\n\u222b\n\u221a\nR(r) \u2206r dr +\n\u222b\n\u221a\n\u0398(\u03b8)d\u03b8, (10)\nwhich readily gives rise to the equation of motion for the geodesic as follows\n\u03a3t\u0307 = ((r2 + a2)E \u2212 aL)(r2 + a2)\n\u2206r \u2212 a(aE sin2(\u03b8)\u2212 L), (11)\n\u03a3r\u0307 = \u221a R(r), (12) \u03a3\u03b8\u0307 = \u221a \u0398(\u03b8), (13) \u03a3\u03c6\u0307 = a((r2 + a2)E \u2212 aL)\n\u2206r \u2212 (aE \u2212 L csc2(\u03b8)), (14)\nwhere a dot denotes the derivative with respect to the affine parameter \u03c4 . It is not difficult to confirm that the bounded null geodesics consist of spherical orbits that are confined on the r = constant spheres. The latter satisfies drd\u03c4 = 0 and d2r d\u03c42 = 0. Subsequently, the region filled by such null geodesics furnishes the photon region [39]. From Eq. (12), we have\nR(r) = 0, dR(r)\ndr = 0 (15)\nwith the additional condition that\n\u0398(\u03b8) \u2265 0 as \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. (16)\nBy solving Eq. (15), the spherical null geodesics with radius r = rp is governed by the ratios of the conserved quantities \u03be = LE and \u03b7 = K E2 . In particular, one finds\n\u03be = r2p a + a\u2212 4r\u2206r(r) a\u2206r \u2032(r) , (17) \u03b7 = 16r2\u2206r(r)\n\u2206\u2032r(r) 2\n. (18)\nInserting Eqs. (17) and (18) into conditi on (16), one derives an inequality which determine the boundary of the photon region, namely,\n16r2a2\u2206r(r) sin 2(\u03b8) \u2265 (4r\u2206r(r) \u2212 \u03a3\u2206\u2032r(r))2. (19)\n5\nThe stability of the spherical null geodesics with radius rp is dictated by the second-order derivative of the effective potential. To be specific, they are unstable against the radial perturbation when d 2R(r) dr2 |r=rp > 0, stable when d2R(r) dr2 |r=rp < 0. The former is relevant to the boundary of the black hole shadow. By using Eqs. (8), (17) and (18), finally one obtains\nd2R(r)\ndr2\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr=rp = 8E2\n(\nr2 + 2r\u2206r(r) \u2206\u2032r(r) \u2212 2r\n2\u2206r(r)\u2206 \u2032\u2032 r (r)\n\u2206\u2032r(r) 2\n)\n> 0. (20)\nIn Fig. 2, we show the photon regions with different values of spin a and charge Q, while fixing \u03b3 = 0. For convenience, all the quantities are expressed in units of M for the remainder of the present paper. Owing to the axisymmetry, the plots only show the intersections of the null geodesics and the plane r sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6 = 0. The stable and unstable orbits are distinguished by showing them in blue and orange, respectively. The plots on the first row are for the black holes with vanishing spin a = 0. This is the Schwarzschild case, where the radius of the spherical orbits become degenerated, and the blue and orange regions turn into circles. For vanishing magnetic charge Q = 0, there is only one horizon. As the charge increases, a second horizon, namely, the inner horizon, starts to appear from the center. The radius of the inner horizon continues to increase as the charge increases, and it eventually merges with the outer horizon when Q attains its critical value. This feature about the horizon is similar to that of a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black\n6\nhole. Interestingly, there is a second family of null geodesics located between the two horizons. As such null geodesics will not escape from the outer horizon, they are irrelevant to the black hole shadow in question.\nIn the second row, the spin is taken to be a relatively small value a = 0.5. On the one hand, as the magnetic charge increases until its critical value Qc \u2248 0.908, the feature of the horizon structure is again similar to that of a Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m black hole. On the other hand, the characteristics of the photon region are reminiscent of that of a Kerr black hole. Although all the null geodesics possess spherical orbits, the radii of the orbits vary between two extreme values. In general, the motion of the photon is not circular. To be specific, only two circular orbits are lying on the equatorial plane, attaining the extreme radii. The smallest (largest) zenithal angle occurs for the turning point of the orbits occurs in the directions of the north (south) pole, whose radii are also unique. It is worth noting that there is not any photon region between the horizons.\nThe plots in the last row present the most intriguing features, where one has chosen a relatively large spin a = 0.9 for the black hole metric. The first two plots from the left show that there are additional photon regions inside the inner horizon. Besides unstable null geodesics, such photon region also accommodates stable null geodesics. This is the case for either vanishing or small magnetic charges. For a black hole with a vanishing magnetic charge, the entire area of the photon region is connected. However, it separates into two areas as the magnetic charge starts to increase. As the charge further increases, the two horizons coincide when the critical charge is attained, Q = Qc \u2248 0.493. As shown in the third plot from the left, at this moment, the two distinct areas of photon regions also become united. One observes that the stable null geodesics are entirely attached to the unstable ones from the inside. The last plot explore the fictitious scenario when Q > Qc, the horizon disappears and, subsequently, the photon region is separated into two, while the main feature of the last plot remains. Since the photon region inside the horizon is mostly irrelevant to the black hole shadow, we shall not process further regarding the details of its structure.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the photon regions for different values of quintessential parameter \u03b3. For each individual row, from left to right, we increase the value of \u03b3 while assuming a given value a = Q. From top to bottom, the value a = Q increases from 0.3 to 0.94. As observed in the plots of the first row, for small values of a and Q, the photon regions are largely reminiscent of those of the Kerr black hole. Also, the effect of \u03b3 seems to compensate for that due to the spin a. This is because as \u03b3 increases, the variation of the radii of spherical orbits is suppressed.\nAs the values of a and Q increase, once again, one starts to observe intricated features of a second area of photon region inside the inner horizon, as observed in Fig. 2. The latter photon region is characterized by the appearance of stable null geodesics, which merges and gluons onto the photon region outside the horizon when the metric is in the vicinity of an extreme black hole. Since the value of critical charge Qc decreases when a increases, for a given column from top to bottom, the magnetic charge surpasses its critical value Q = Qc at a certain point. As a result, the photon region exhibits the features which are shown in the bottom right plot of Fig. 2, which are readily observed in the plots on the last row of Fig. 3. On the other hand, the quintessential parameter \u03b3 is found to largely work against the above features. In other words, the structure tends to fall back to that of the Kerr black hole as \u03b3 increases. This can be observed in the rightmost plots on the second and third rows.\n7\n8"

            "text": "In this section, we proceed to analyze the shadow of the black hole for an observer at spatial infinity r = \u221e. In order to investigate the deformation of black hole shadow with respect to various physical parameters, we employ two different approaches.\nIn asymptotically flat spacetime, the size of the black hole shadow can be measured by an observer at infinity r = \u221e in terms of the celestial coordinates \u03b1 and \u03b2 [2].\n\u03b1 = lim r\u2192\u221e\n(\n\u2212r sin \u03b8d\u03c6 dr |(r0,\u03b80) ) , (21)\n\u03b2 = lim r\u2192\u221e\n(\nr2 d\u03b8\ndr |(r0,\u03b80)\n)\n, (22)\nwhere r0 represents the distance from the black hole to the observer, and \u03b80 is the inclination angle between the line of observer\u2019s sight and the spinning axis of the black hole.\nThe above limit can be evaluated by using the specific form of the metric, and expressed in terms of the constants of motion \u03be and \u03b7 given in Eqs. (17) and (18) as follows\n\u03b1 = \u2212 \u03be sin \u03b80 , (23) \u03b2 = \u00b1 \u221a \u03b7 \u2212 (\u03be csc \u03b80 \u2212 a sin \u03b80)2, (24)\nFor further simplification, one assumes that the observer is located on the equatorial plane of the black hole, thus the inclination angle \u03b80 = \u03c0 2 . One has\n\u03b1 = \u2212\u03be, (25) \u03b2 = \u00b1 \u221a \u03b7 \u2212 (\u03be \u2212 a)2, (26)\nIn Fig. 4, we show the calculated black hole shadow for different metric parameters a, Q, and \u03b3. From the two plots in the first row, one observes that for small black hole spin a = 0.15, the charge Q and quintessential parameter \u03b3 do not significantly affect the shape of the shadow. But they do have an impact on the overall size of the shadow. As one increases the black hole spin in the second and third rows, the shadow is gradually deformed, as it becomes more asymmetric with respect to the vertical axis \u03b1 = 0. On the other hand, as \u03b3 increases, the size of the black hole shadow increases, while the deformation also becomes slightly more significant. Since the above modifications are not significant, in the next section we will employ a few quantities to quantify the deformation.\nWe also investigate the effect of the state parameter \u03c9 on the black hole shadow. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The left plot is calculated by taking \u03c9 = \u22121/2, while for the middle one, we assume \u03c9 = \u22122/3. Apparently, the distortion depends more sensitively on \u03b3 in the case of \u03c9 = \u22122/3. The right plot shows the dependence of the shadow on \u03c9, by fixing a = 0.8, Q = 0.5, and \u03b3 = 0.008. It is observed that as \u03c9 decreases, the area of the black hole shadow increases. We will analyze the results in a more quantitative fashion in the next section."

            "text": "In order to analyze the apparent shape of the shadow in detail, we adopt the two observables introduced in [5], namely, the shadow radius Rs and the distortion parameter \u03b4s. Here, Rs is defined as the radius of reference circle that passes through the three points T (\u03b1t, \u03b2t) the top\n9\n10\none, B(\u03b1b, \u03b2b) the bottom one, and R(\u03b1r, \u03b2r) the right one, by the following expression\nRs = (\u03b1t \u2212 \u03b1r)2 + \u03b2t2\n2|\u03b1t \u2212 \u03b1r| . (27)\nOn the other hand, \u03b4s reflects the deformation of the shadow and is defined as\n\u03b4s = ds Rs = |\u03b1l \u2212 \u03b1\u0303l| Rs , (28)\nwhere ds represents the distances between the most left point of the black hole shadow and the reference circle. By definition, these quantities are closely connected to astronomical observations.\nR H\nIn Fig. 6, we show the calculated shadow radius Rs and distortion parameter \u03b4s as functions of the quintessential parameter \u03b3. The left plot indicates that it is rather difficult to distinguish the black hole spin a by using the observed shadow radius Rs since the curves with different values of a mostly overlap with each other. However, the shadow radius Rs is shown to be sensitive to the quintessential parameter \u03b3, as it increases with increasing \u03b3. On the other hand, the right plot indicates that the distortion \u03b4s is sensitive to a, however, it varies slowly as a function of \u03b3.\nTo show the effect of the equation of state of the quintessence, in Fig. 7 we analysize the resulting dependence of Rs and \u03b4s on the state parameter \u03c9. It is observed that the shadow radius Rs decreases more significantly as the \u03c9 increases, while the distortion \u03b4s increases slowly with \u03c9. By choosing \u03c9 = \u22120.5, \u22120.7 and \u22120.9, in Fig. 8, we also show the resulting dependence\n11\n] ^\nq r\nof Rs and \u03b4s on the black hole spin. One observes that for different values of the spin a, the shadow radius Rs is sensitive to \u03c9. While for the distortion \u03b4s, its dependence on \u03c9 is hardly observable.\nThe results obtained in the above figures indicate that the information on the quintessential parameter might be extracted if one can precisely measure the mass and size of the black hole shadow irrelevant to the specific value of the spin. For specific measurements, the latter, on the other hand, might be sensitively dependent on the deformation of the shadow. The modifications to the shadows due to the state parameter \u03c9 is found to be of the same order of magnitude to those associated to the spin and charge. The latter are also shown to be rather sensitive to both the size and distortion of the black hole shadow, potentially related to its significant effect on the horizon structure and photon region, discussed in the previous section. In particular, if one chooses the observables properly, information on the relevant black hole parameter is expected to be extracted. Therefore, in the present model, the state parameter does seem to play a significant role in determining the main features of the shadow.\nFrom the perspective of an observer at infinity, the shadow of a black hole can be viewed as a high-energy absorption cross-section. In the case of a spherically symmetric black hole, the absorption cross-section oscillates around a limiting constant value \u03c3lim, which is the same as the geometrical cross-section of photon sphere [42]. Therefore, this value can be expressed as [43]\n\u03c3lim \u2248 \u03c0R2s, (29)\nwhere Rs is the shadow radius of a black hole. By using this limiting constant value, the energy\n12\nemissiom rate can be shown to possess the following form\nd2E(\u03b6)\nd\u03b6dt = 2\u03c02\u03c3lim e\u03b6/T \u2212 1\u03b6 3, (30)\nwhere \u03b6 represents the frequency of photon, and T is the Hawking temperature of a black hole for the outer event horizon, which reads\nT = lim \u03b8\u21920,r\u2192r+\n\u2202r \u221a\u2212gtt\n2\u03c0 \u221a grr , (31)\nwhere r+ denotes the outer event horizon of the black hole. Thus, the Hawking temperature of a rotating black hole immersed in the quintessence field is found to be\nTQuintessence = r2+f \u2032(r+)(r 2 + + a 2) + 2a2r+(f(r+)\u2212 1) 4\u03c0(r2+ + a 2)2 , (32)\nwhere f(r) = 1\u2212 2Mr2r3+Q3 \u2212 \u03b3r. The evolution of energy emission rate as a function of the photon frequency \u03b6 for the present metric is calculated and shown in Fig. 9. One observes that the peak decreases and shifts to lower frequency with increasing a, Q, and \u03b3. The result is largely consistent with the finding for Kerr black holes."

We investigated the photon region and the black hole shadow, as well as their dependence on the relevant physical conditions. In particular, the effects of the state parameter of the quintessence, the angular momentum, and the magnitude of the magnetic charge are explored. It is shown that the photon regions sensitively depend on the horizon structure and possess intricate features. Moreover, from the viewpoint of a static observer, we explore a few physical observables which are associated with the distortion of the observed black hole shadows. It is found that the presence and the properties of the dark energy might be implied from the empirical studies of the black hole shadows, as a few relevant physical quantities substantially affect the size of the shadow in a fashion independent of the rotation of the black hole."
