    "abstractText": "A close inter-relationship between mobility and cognition is reported in older adults, with improvements in gait performance noticeable after cognitive remediation in frail individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of computerized cognitive training (CCT) on mobility in healthy, independently living older adults, and to determine whether CCT is associated with changes in neural activation for mobility-related brain processes. Using a randomized single-blind control design, sixty-three non-demented adults age 60 y and older (mean age = 67 y; 76% female, mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score = 27) were recruited from a local Senior Activity Center. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 2-month CCT program (8 weeks, 3x/week, 40 min/session) or a wait-list control group. Primary outcome was self-selected gait speed during singleand dual-task walking. Secondary outcome was executive function on Trail Making Test (TMT), Part B. Neural activity was assessed via electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs) targeting lower-limb performance. Results from a linear mixed effect model, adjusted for baseline MoCA score, age, gender, and study completion revealed that compared to controls, CCT improved gait speed during the dual-task (p = 0.008) but not during the single-task walking condition (p = 0.057). CCT also improved executive function (p = 0.024). Further, shorter foot reaction time responses (p = 0.019) were found with enhanced neural activation over sensorimotor areas, with shorter ERP latencies during the P2 component (p = 0.008) and enhanced motor responses (p = 0.009) also evident in the CCT group after the intervention. Overall, the electrophysiological findings suggest possible neural adaptations that could explain improvements in mobility and executive functions associated with CCT in healthy older adults.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of computerized cognitive\ntraining (CCT) on mobility in healthy, independently living older adults, and to determine\nwhether CCT is associated with changes in neural activation for mobility-related brain\nprocesses. Using a randomized single-blind control design, sixty-three non-demented\nadults age 60 y and older (mean age = 67 y; 76% female, mean Montreal\nCognitive Assessment [MoCA] score = 27) were recruited from a local Senior Activity\nCenter. Participants were randomly assigned to either a 2-month CCT program (8\nweeks, 3x/week, 40 min/session) or a wait-list control group. Primary outcome was\nself-selected gait speed during single- and dual-task walking. Secondary outcome was\nexecutive function on Trail Making Test (TMT), Part B. Neural activity was assessed\nvia electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERPs) targeting lower-limb\nperformance. Results from a linear mixed effect model, adjusted for baseline MoCA\nscore, age, gender, and study completion revealed that compared to controls, CCT\nimproved gait speed during the dual-task (p = 0.008) but not during the single-task\nwalking condition (p = 0.057). CCT also improved executive function (p = 0.024).\nFurther, shorter foot reaction time responses (p = 0.019) were found with enhanced\nneural activation over sensorimotor areas, with shorter ERP latencies during the P2\ncomponent (p = 0.008) and enhanced motor responses (p = 0.009) also evident in\nthe CCT group after the intervention. Overall, the electrophysiological findings suggest\npossible neural adaptations that could explain improvements in mobility and executive\nfunctions associated with CCT in healthy older adults.\nKeywords: visual evoked potentials (VEP), motor-related cortical potentials (MRCP), executive control, cognitivemotor brain networks, healthy aging, sensorimotor integration, functional mobility\nINTRODUCTION\nWalking difficulties are widespread among older adults, and are associated with restricted activities of daily living, mobility disability and death (Hirvensalo et al., 2000; Rosano et al., 2008). While exercise is recommended to improvemobility (Urzi et al., 2019), only 16% of U.S. seniors exercise at the recommended level and 33% remain inactive (Lee et al., 2017). Sedentary behavior or inactivity\nis related to increased risk of disability within all levels of physical activity (DiPietro et al., 2018).\nAmong non-pharmacological interventions, cognitive training has been shown to stabilize or even improve cognitive performance of healthy older adults (Tardif and Simard, 2011; Simons et al., 2016). Gait and cognitive functions are interrelated in older adults. Previous studies have revealed that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in successful gait and cognition (Beauchet et al., 2016) and have linked gait to structural changes in cerebellar, precuneus, supplementary motor, insular, and PFC brain regions (Blumen et al., 2019). These findings support the notion that cognitive training could improve both cognitive and motor functions. Additionally, previous experiments have shown that cognitive training can improve response times, with improvements seen in multiple ERP components in healthy young (Olfers and Band, 2018) and old adults (Gajewski and Falkenstein, 2012, 2018; Pergher et al., 2018), promoting neural enhancements in aging (Nguyen et al., 2019).\nImpairments in cognitive processes are associated with slower gait and gait instability (Montero-Odasso et al., 2012). Successful mobility performance is dependent on intact cognitive function (Montero-Odasso et al., 2012). Hence, recent research has focused on ways to improve cognitive function as a means to improve mobility. In a pilot study with sedentary seniors, Verghese et al. (2010) reported a far transfer computerized cognitive training (CCT) effect to mobility. A recent metaanalysis of 10 trials with 351 participants reported that cognitive training interventions can improve mobility-related outcomes, especially during challenging walking conditions requiring higher-order executive functions (Marusic et al., 2018a,b). More recently, computerized cognitive remediation improved walking and executive functions in older adults aged 70 years and above at high-risk for mobility disability, but not compared to an active control that included low level cognitive remediation training (Verghese et al., 2021).\nMost studies examining the effect of CCT on mobility-related outcomes enrolled sedentary or frail older adults (Verghese et al., 2010; Smith-Ray et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015; Azadian et al., 2018), and demonstrate significant CCT effects on mobility outcomes. Although the association between brain health, cognition and mobility has been demonstrated even in non-clinical populations (Cohen et al., 2016; Demnitz et al., 2017), the effect of CCT in healthy active older adults has not been established. Moreover, the underlying neural mechanisms of enhanced gait control after cognitive remediation programs have not been well investigated (Marusic et al., 2018b).\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a randomized single-blind control trial in 63 healthy active older adults. Our hypotheses were based on our previous work (Marusic et al., 2018a,b), which indicated that CCT would lead to improvements in executive functions and gait performance, particularly during challenging walking while talking conditions. We also hypothesized that CCT-related enhancements would be evident in pre-post assessments using electroencephalography (EEG)/event-related potentials (ERPs) over sensorimotor regions. This was guided by our recent investigation of the efficiency of recruitment of neuronal resources for the upper and\nlower extremity response task in young and old adults (Marusic et al., 2022), thus sparking an interest in investigating CCT related changes in neural activation."

            "text": "The findings from this single-blind randomized controlled trial reveal that CCT was effective in improving not only gait but also executive function in active, healthy and independently living older adults. At the conclusion of this structured 2-month cognitive training program (24 sessions of CCT), the intervention group exhibited improved gait performance, especially during challenging walking conditions, relative to the control group. Enhanced primary/gait outcome measures were accompanied with enhanced performance on a test of executive function (TMT) as well as on a sensorimotor task for lower limbs. This was also evident from a correlation analysis showing that improvements in motor and cognitive functions were related to a shortening of the P2 component of visual processing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that CCT alone can improve complex mobility performance in active, healthy older adults. These results extend previous behavioral reports of the impact of CCT on both cognitive and motor performance in less healthy populations (Mewborn et al., 2017; Marusic et al., 2018b), as well as provide preliminary support for neural enhancements in the aging brain.\nThe improvement in executive functions in the intervention group supports near transfer of training effects of CCT as demonstrated in previous studies (Klusmann et al., 2010; Heinzel et al., 2014; Marusic et al., 2018a).

            "text": "Also, the TMT was administered only twice (both pre- and post- study) to both the intervention and control groups, so practice effects across both groups cannot explain enhancements in performance solely for the intervention group. Traditionally, training interventions have only evaluated cognitive trainingrelated improvements in the directly trained cognitive domain (Butler et al., 2018), although some initial cognitive interventions report potential transfer effects to other domains like driving performance and daily functioning (Ball et al., 2002; Willis et al., 2006).\nFar transfer, to a distal untrained domain, such as mobility was reported in the present trial in a sample of asymptomatic older adults where self-selected dual-task gait speed was significantly increased (0.13 m/s = 21% intervention vs. 0.02 m/s = 3% control improvement) in the intervention compared to control group. Moreover, there was a trend toward improved walking speed during the single-task (0.16m/s = 17% intervention vs. 0.07m/s = 7% control improvement). Similar findings were obtained in a pilot study of sedentary older adults (Verghese et al., 2010) and latter summarized in our meta-analytical review (Marusic et al., 2018b) that highlighted larger cognitive trainingrelated improvements during challenging walking conditions given their reliance on higher-order executive functions. From the perspective of clinically meaningful change, both gait speeds were increased by more than 0.08 m/s in the intervention group, which was considered a meaningful change in physical performance (Kwon et al., 2009). Recently, a larger CCT study of 383 non-demented seniors at high risk for mobility disability was completed (Verghese et al., 2021). The authors reported an improvement in walking, but this was no greater than in the active control group, who also completed the same amount of CCT but with no progress in the difficulty of the games performed (Verghese et al., 2021). Here, the authors report that practice effects might explain the improvements seen in both arms and the lack of between-group differences; however, the investigators also discuss an alternate hypothesis that the more robust effect on executive function tests in the cognitive remediation arm compared to the active control may indicate a true training effect, and raises the possibility that even low levels of cognitive remediation (as in their active control arm) lead to cognitive benefits (Verghese et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the current study differed in several ways that might explain the discrepancy in results including, smaller sample size, use of healthy elderly population, wait list control, and the inclusion of neurophysiological measures that were lacking in the previous trial. The near and far transfer improvements in the current experiment suggest that common brain substrates involving\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 845825\ncognitive and mobility processes were strengthened by the CCT. The electrophysiological study in a subgroup of our participants provides further insights into the observed benefits. That is, the intervention group manifested shortened foot reaction times to visual stimuli after 2 months of CCT with concomitant P2 latency reduction over occipital regions as well as decreased MRCP amplitudes over motor cortex region. The former likely reflects enhancements in executive attention processes and sensory encoding (Finnigan et al., 2011), while the latter points toward the optimization in response generation and efficiency in depolarization of motor cortex neurons (Yordanova et al., 2004).While slower foot reaction times have been associated with falls (Lord et al., 2003), a recent study revealed a link between participation in cognitive activities and neuromotor performance (Cai et al., 2020). Although using a cross-sectional design, the latter study showed the participation in cognitively stimulating activities is associated with shorter foot reaction times and faster gait speed (Cai et al., 2020), which is consistent with our longitudinal observations.\nEnhancing neural substrates and consequently (sub)components of executive functions [i.e., cognitive flexibility; for details see (Diamond, 2013)] seems like a plausible explanation for improvements in gait (Marusic et al., 2018b), as well as sensory functioning. Previous EEG/ERP studies typically report a u-shape pattern in ERP components (Reuter et al., 2019), and more specifically increased P2 component latencies in older\nas compared to younger adults (Goodin et al., 1978; Iragui et al., 1993). Our recent study found overall larger amplitudes with delayed latencies of endogenous potentials in older compared to younger adults (Marusic et al., 2022), which is consistent with our recent findings in which P2 latency was significantly reduced after CCT. Moreover, the lower MRCP amplitude during sensorimotor task performed with the lower limbs may indicate less intense depolarization of motor cortex neurons or more efficient recruitment of neuronal resources required for the lower extremity response task after CCT (Yordanova et al., 2004; Marusic et al., 2022).\nIt is well-documented that walking, a rhythmic motor task, involves complex motor, sensory and cognitive processes (Holtzer et al., 2006; Scherder et al., 2007; Al-Yahya et al., 2011). It is also known that older adults require more attentional demands for motor control while walking, indicating the compounded involvement of attentional resources during gait (Kressig, 2010). Moreover, the association of multisensory integration processes with attention-based performance (Mahoney and Verghese, 2020) and measures of mobility including balance, falls and gait (Mahoney et al., 2019) have been well established. Findings reveal that better performance on a visual-somatosensory simple RT test requiring lower limb responses was associated with better cognitive and motor outcomes in healthy older adults.

However, further studies are needed to determine whether CCT simultaneously improves sensory, cognitive, and motor functioning by targeting neural networks with connections to prefrontal cortex.\nThe main strength of the current study is the application of a randomized control design for examining the effect of CCT. The current study replicates previous studies addressing mobility-related improvements after non-physical training, while revealing the potential of CCT in asymptomatic older adults and highlighting for the first time associated neural alterations.\nThis study is not without limitations. The sample size was determined by convenience in which we targeted recruitment of older adults attending the Center for daily activities for the elderly. There was a relatively high attrition rate, particularly in the control group, but similar to other cognitive training studies (Ballesteros et al., 2014; Maffei et al., 2017). Attrition rates could likely be improved by including an active control group and/or compensating participants for their time and effort (Verghese et al., 2016). Recent findings by Verghese et al. (2021) in which the active control group showed cognitive and motoric benefits point to the possibility that even low levels of cognitive training have cognitive benefits (Verghese et al., 2021). We were unable to assess durability effects of CCT over time on our outcome measures. Future studies should explore monitoring brain activity directly during actual locomotion through aMobile\nBrain/Body Imaging (MoBI) setup for example, to gain further insights into neuroplasticity in ecologically valid environments (Wunderlich et al., 2021)."

            "text": "Overall, results from the current study provide evidence that CCT improves mobility in a population of active, healthy and independently living older adults, and is associated with enhancements in cognitive performance. Enhanced executive functions together with optimization of sensorimotor processing that contributes to shorter lower-limb response times after CCT may play a role in enhanced mobility but requires further validation. Our correlational analyses suggest that neurophysiological findings support alterations in neural activity that may contribute to the reported enhancements in cognitive andmotor performance. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of how non-physical interventions can improve mobility could guide future research in situations where physical exercise is limited or not possible such as before or after surgery or during periods of immobilization as in hospital stays. There is a need for well-designed large-scale clinical trials with active controls to identify neuronal substrates that are susceptible to CCT enhancement to improve current multimodal interventions to prevent cognitive and motoric declines in aging.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2022 | Volume 14 | Article 845825"
