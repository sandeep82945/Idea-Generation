This study aimed to evaluate needle priming methods using the ultrasound contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride and a 1 mL syringe. Material and Methods Two kinds of biopsy needles, sidenotch and full core, and one kind of introducer needle were primed using non-primed needles as controls (n = 180). Recordings of punctures were performed in a water bath phantom to which the ultrasound contrast agent had also been added. Contrast-specific imaging-mode needle visibility was evaluated for the entire needles and the needle tips, respectively, quantitatively by calculating the contrast-to-noise ratio and qualitatively via grading by three radiologists. Results The contrast-to-noise ratio following the ultrasound contrast agent priming was superior compared to the controls for the entire needles of all three types (p\\ 0.001) and for the needle tips of the core biopsy needles and introducer needles (p\\ 0.001). However, the ratio was equal to the controls for the needle tips of the side-notch biopsy needles (p = 0.19). Needle visibility following the ultrasound contrast agent priming was qualitatively superior compared to the controls for both the entire needles and the needle tips, and the difference was considered clinically relevant by the assessors (p\\ 0.001). Conclusion The ultrasound contrast agent needle priming methods described increased the contrast-specific imagingmode needle visibility in a phantom model. Nonetheless, the results also need to be confirmed in vivo.",

            "text": "Performing biopsies under the guidance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be valuable to avoid targeting necrotic (non-diagnostic) tumor areas and to enable a biopsy of focal lesions only visible in the contrastspecific imaging-mode (CEUS-mode) [1\u20137]. Dual-screen imaging is recommended, with the CEUS-mode image on one side to visualize the lesion, accompanied by a B-mode image on the other side to track the needle because of the inferior CEUS-mode needle visibility [7\u20139]. To avoid disrupting the ultrasound contrast agent (USCA) microbubbles, the dual-screen B-mode image is of a low mechanical index (MI) and thus, of a lower image quality than in the conventional B-mode [8]. This may cause an inferior overall biopsy needle visibility, making the CEUS & Per Thunswa\u0308rd per.thunsward@uu.se 1 Department of Surgical Sciences - Section of Radiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Entrance 70, 1st Floor, S-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden 2 Department of Radiology, Va\u0308stmanlands Hospital Va\u0308stera\u030as, Va\u0308stera\u030as, Sweden 3 Antaros Medical AB, Mo\u0308lndal, Sweden\nbiopsy procedure more difficult. The ex vivo/in vitro CEUS-mode core biopsy needle visibility may be improved by needle priming with the USCA sulfur hexafluoride [10]. The priming method used, however, is limited to detachable side-notch biopsy needles and somewhat complicated by requiring the biopsy needle disassembly and a temporary sharps holder. Improved needle visibility following the needle priming has also been demonstrated in vivo, albeit only in a case report in which the needle priming procedure comprised coating of the outer cannula and the inner stylet of a semiautomatic biopsy instrument requiring 1\u20132 mL of USCA [11]. To be clinically useful, we identified the need for simpler and more universal priming methods requiring small amounts of USCA.\nNeedle priming methods using 0.2\u20130.6 mL of USCA were developed for the two most common types of nondetachable biopsy needle types, side-notch and full core, and for introducer needles. The aim was to evaluate the CEUS-mode needle visibility after applying those needle priming methods."

The USCA sulfur hexafluoride (SonoVue; Bracco SpA, Milan, Italy) was used, both to prime the needles and to achieve a contrast-enhanced background in the phantom. The needles were primed as presented in Fig. 1 and Online Resources 1\u20133 using a Luer slip syringe (1 ML 0,01 LUER TUBERCULIN, CODAN Medical Aps, R\u00f8dby, Denmark). Unprimed needles were used as controls.\nTo evaluate each needle type, 10 separate sets were observed, each consisting of 6 punctures divided into 3 matched pairs of one USCA-primed needle and one\ncontrol. This resulted in a total of 30 pairs per needle type and an overall sample size of 180.\nThe water bath phantom (depicted in Fig. 2) was set up\nas below:\n\u2022 A plastic container was filled with 7 L of water, to which 0.3 mL of USCA was added to resemble a\nperfused human liver after intravenous USCA administration1 \u2022 The liquid was mixed around with an electric pump (240 L/h) and exchanged after every set of six\npunctures to retain a uniform background intensity\n\u2022 One-cm-thick slices of canned ham (SPAM, Danish Crown UK Ltd., Manchester, UK) were placed at the\nbottom of the container to reduce any reflections\n\u2022 A polyolefin hose (thickness 0.3 mm; diameter 12.7 mm) filled with water and with the ends closed\nwas placed just above the canned ham to mimic a tumor that is not perfused (anechogenic) \u2022 The canned ham and polyolefin hose were fixed by a self-made metal stand\nScanning was performed using an ACUSON Sequoia unit (Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc., Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.) with a 5C1 curved transducer. The transducer was enclosed in a non-latex probe cover and set up on a metal tripod. A needle guide (Verza, CIVCO Medical Instruments Co., Inc., IA, U.S.A.) in setting 3 (61 ), with corresponding electronically generated guidance lines, was used. Imaging was performed with the following settings:\n\u2022 Dual-screen mode with CEUS-mode image to the left (frequency setting low) and low MI B-mode image to\nthe right (frequency setting mid)\n\u2022 Maximum depth 9 cm, with the focus set in the deep portion of the image\n1 The volume of the USCA was chosen based on the assumptions of an intravenous dose of 1.5 mL USCA and the liver containing approximately 14% of the total blood volume of 5 L in an adult [12, 13]\nTable 1 The three needle types and, where applicable, associated instruments used in the experiment\nNeedle type Components Description\nSide-notch biopsy\nneedle\nPro-Mag Ultra Automatic Biopsy Instrument with\nPro-Mag Biopsy Needle 18 ga 9 16 cm\nNon-disposable fully automatic biopsy instrument with practically\nnon-separable needle side-notch biopsy needle\nFull core biopsy\nneedle\nBioPince Ultra Full Core Biopsy Instrument\n18 ga 9 20 cm\nDisposable fully automatic biopsy instrument with non-separable\nfull core biopsy needle\nIntroducer needle Introducer Needle 17 ga 9 16.8 cm Coaxial introducer needle included in the BioPince set\nAll needles were from the same manufacturer (Argon Medical Devices, Inc., TX, U.S.A.)\n\u2022 Gain standardized and set to -10 dB for the CEUSmode image and 0 dB for the B-mode image \u2022 Recording with 10 frames per second\nImmediately after (approximately a few seconds) the priming, the needles were inserted via the needle guide until it just reached the polyolefin hose without deforming or penetrating it. The courses of the needles were recorded as video clips of approximately six seconds (3 s of needle insertion and 3 s at the needle\u2019s maximum depth). The needles were subsequently retracted, and the biopsy instruments fired off outside the phantom. Thereafter, the needles were primed again before the next observation.\nFor both the side-notch and full core biopsy needle types, a new USCA primed biopsy needle was used per set (each needle was, thus, primed three consecutive times before being disposed). This procedure was applied to resemble clinical conditions and to evaluate the possible impact on needle visibility with repeated primings. The latter since there was a suspicion that repeated loading and firing of the biopsy instruments subsequently could make the USCA propagate toward the non-sharp end of the biopsy in the space between the inner stylet and the outer cannula, and thus possibly affect the needle visibility.\n(a) (b)\nI\nII"

The mean and standard deviation of the signal intensity were measured in the two ROIs as well as the background area for the image frames with the needles inserted in their end positions. CNRs were calculated for the entire needle and needle tip. The means of the CNRs were calculated for each puncture from which the medians were computed, and the differences in CNRs were tested with Wilcoxon signed rank (samples were matched for each of the pairs with the USCA versus the controls.)\nFor the two biopsy needles studied, the CNRs for the entire needles were calculated for each of the orders (first, second, and third) of the needle primings separately. This was done to test whether an improvement in the needle visibility could be achieved, independent of the three orders of primings."

Furthermore, for both the biopsy needles studied, an increase in the entire needle visibility, in terms of CNR, was obtained after the USCA priming, independent of the orders of primings (first, second, and third). The latter indicated that the multiple rounds of loading and firing of the biopsy instruments associated with repeated priming were not required for the methods to work.\nThe concept of needle priming with USCA to improve the needle visibility in CEUS-mode has earlier been demonstrated ex vivo and in a water bath phantom model for a reusable biopsy instrument with disposable needles [10]. In contrast to the previously described USCA needle priming method, the current evaluated methods were performed without separating the needle components and did not require a temporary sharps holder. The currently described priming methods were thus simpler and more versatile by enabling a priming of disposable (i.e., exclusively non-separable) biopsy instruments and also introducer needles. Moreover, the USCA, instead of oxygen bubbles, was used in the water bath phantom; also, the qualitative evaluation form was modified to simplify the outcome measures and emphasize the clinical relevance.\nIn a letter to the editor, Chandrashekharaa et al. presented a case with satisfactory CEUS-mode biopsy needle visibility by using the USCA needle priming [11]. Their priming method was neither described in detail nor evaluated systematically and thereto required a larger volume of USCA (1\u20132 mL). However, the findings are promising for assessing the value of the USCA needle priming concept in vivo.\nThe lack of quantitatively increased needle tip visibility for the side-notch biopsy needle may be attributed to its larger proportion of inner stylet not being covered by the outer cannula at the tip (4.6 mm completely or partially not covered compared with 3.4 mm for the full core biopsy needle and 2.6 mm for the introducer needle). If this is considered, the position of the needle tip should still make it possible to estimate with a reasonable certainty in a clinical context.\nOur study was limited to one of each of the three needle types included, one ultrasound machine, and one transducer, with the puncture angle and depth fixed. Furthermore, using a water bath phantom, despite the contrast-\nenhanced background used, is not exactly comparable to a clinical setting. Nevertheless, it was possible to distinguish between needles primed with an undiluted contrast agent and one primed with a contrast-enhanced background. Another limitation of using a water bath phantom is the inability to evaluate the B-mode needle visibility meaningfully due to the inherent good B-mode visibility in liquids [9]. Taken together, this underscores the need for a follow-up in vivo study of the described priming methods, including an evaluation of both the CEUS-mode and B-mode visibility."

            "text": "The in vitro CEUS-mode visibility of the biopsy and introducer needles was improved by using the described methods of needle priming with small amounts of USCA. The priming methods may be valuable in situations of poor needle visibility when performing biopsies in CEUS-mode, but the results need to be confirmed in vivo.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270023-03500-3.\nAcknowledgements Johan Krause, M.D. and Vendela Riesenfeld Ka\u0308llskog, M.D. and Ph.D., Uppsala University Hospital, and Karin Stro\u0308mstedt, M.D., Va\u0308stmanland Hospital Va\u0308stera\u030as contributed by evaluating the video recordings of the performed punctures.
