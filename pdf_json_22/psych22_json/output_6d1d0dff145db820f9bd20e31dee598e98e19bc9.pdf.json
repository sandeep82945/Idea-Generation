            "text": "Infants who spent the beginning of extrauterine life in a neonatal intensive care unit are at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). It has been estimated that about 25% of these infants are diagnosed with NDD [1]. A major challenge for clinicians is to detect the infants who will be diagnosed with NDD at an early age. The challenge occurs because of the dramatic developmental changes that occur in the brain during the first two postnatal years [2]. Meanwhile, this period with high neuroplasticity offers the best opportunities for successful early intervention [3].\nIt has been established that the best tools for early detection consist of early magnetic resonance imaging and general movement assessment [3]. However, magnetic resonance imaging facilities are not everywhere available and general movement assessment can only be performed until the corrected age of five months. Other instruments for the prediction of NDD, that are applicable in older infants, are the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination [4], and the Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment [5]. These instruments are however less appropriate to monitor the infant\u2019s motor development and the effect of early intervention. Other instruments that may be used to monitor the infant\u2019s motor progress are the Test of Infant Motor Performance [6] and the Alberta Infant Motor Scale [7]. Yet, these methods have only a limited capacity to predict NDD. They also mainly evaluate gross motor functions. The novel instrument Infant Motor Profile (IMP) [8] is the only instrument that evaluates gross and fine motor development and combines predictive and responsive evaluative properties for NDD [9].\nThe IMP is based on the Neuronal Group Selection Theory. According to Neuronal Group\nSelection Theory, human motor development is characterized by two phases, i.e., the phases of primary and secondary variability [10,11]. During the first phase, individuals present a wide variety of movements. The afferent feedback of these movements is used for further sculpting of the brain, but cannot be used to adapt movements to the specifics of the situation. In the phase of secondary variability, sensory information associated with own exploratory, trial and error activities can be used to learn to select the most efficient movement strategy in each situation. This means that during the phase of secondary variability, motor behavior is characterized by a varied repertoire and the development of adaptive movements [12]. In contrast, infants with an early lesion of the brain may present with a reduced movement repertoire being expressed by reduced variation and the presence of stereotyped movements. Additionally, an early lesion of the brain may result in impaired adaptability due to a) the absence of specific optimal strategies (due to repertoire reduction); b) a reduced exploratory drive, and c) impaired processing of sensory information, which interferes with the process of learning to select adaptive strategies [13].\nThe IMP is a video-based instrument for infants aged three to 18 months, or rather to the\nmoment when the child is able to walk independently for some months. It is based on the infant\u2019s self-generated movements during a playful interaction with the assessor. The IMP consists of 80 items that provide information on the infant\u2019s motor behavior in five domains: variation, adaptability, symmetry, fluency and performance. The domains of variation and adaptability are based on the Neuronal Group Selection Theory. The three other domains are\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277755 November 16, 2022 2 / 8\nPRISMA-ScR, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for the Scoping Reviews; NDD, Neurodevelopmental disorders.\ntraditional domains of motor development. This also means that the IMP has four domains evaluating the quality of motor behavior and one domain that evaluates performance, i.e., motor skills or motor milestones. The IMP results in five domain scores and one total score. The assessment itself takes about 15 minutes and its off-line scoring about 10 minutes. Recently, the IMP-manual became available, including many video examples, an app to calculate the scores and IMP-norms (percentile values) [14]. Additionally, the IMP does not require a specific tool kit, but toys that can be easily acquired [8,15\u201317].\nThe aim of this scoping review is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IMP,\nincluding its predictive validity. Here it is important to realize that prediction at early age of developmental outcome in later life is never perfect, as the young nervous system develops very rapidly. Due to the rapid changes, infants may outgrow their initial impairments, however, they also may grow into a deficit [9]. This also means that it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical tool, but to also use complementary clinical tools [18]. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Review indicate that reviews on the psychometric properties of the IMP are lacking. Therefore, we aim to offer a systematic overview of the properties of IMP, allowing health professionals and researchers to decide whether the IMP suits their goals of assessing infant motor behavior."

Subsequently, two independent reviewers (LM and CS) will screen the titles and abstracts according to the inclusion criteria. In phase one of the project, i.e. the phase during which the search algorithm and literature selection were tested (see Table 1), the two reviewers reached a high level of agreement (86% agreement and kappa = 0.824). Relevant papers will be fully analyzed, considering the inclusion criteria by the reviewers. Full- text papers not included in the scoping review will be specified and reported. In case of any disagreement between the first and second reviewers, the third reviewer (ET) will be consulted for final decision. The results of the search will be reported in full in the final scoping review, and presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for the Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [20] flow diagram (Fig 1)."

The evaluation of IMP\u2019s reliability focuses on intra-rater and interrater agreements. The evaluation of the various forms of validity will pay attention to the nature of the groups studied, e.g., whether the infants studied are at high or low risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The assessment of construct validity evaluates which risk factors will be associated with low IMP-scores. Construct validity will be confirmed when low-IMP scores are associated with social, prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors. The evaluation of the concurrent validity will report the association of IMP-scores with scores on other neurodevelopmental assessments, therewith also paying attention to the type of comparison instruments used. Moderate associations between IMP-scores and scores on other neurodevelopmental assessments will confirm IMP\u2019s concurrent validity. High correlations are not expected, as this would demonstrate that the IMP measures the same as the other instruments. Predictive validity addresses the question of how well low IMP-scores predict the neurodevelopmental outcome at a later age. It is confirmed when low IMP scores predict the neurodevelopmental outcome at a later age. Specific attention will be paid to the age and the type of outcome (e.g., CP, developmental delay, or cognition). Finally, IMP\u2019s responsivity will be determined by evaluating intervention studies that used the IMP as an outcome measure. IMP\u2019s responsivity is confirmed when the IMP is able to measure a difference in the effect of two types of early intervention. A narrative summary will accompany the tabulated results and will describe how the results relate to the reviews\u2019 aims and question/s."
