    "abstractText": "In inhomogeneous media, electromagnetic-wave rays deviate from the trajectories predicted by the leading-order geometrical optics. This effect, called the spin Hall effect of light, is typically neglected in ray-tracing codes used for modeling waves in plasmas. Here, we demonstrate that the spin Hall effect can be significant for radiofrequency waves in toroidal magnetized plasmas whose parameters are in the ballpark of those used in fusion experiments. For example, an electroncyclotron wave beam can deviate by as large as ten wavelengths (\u223c 0.1m) relative to the lowest-order ray trajectory in the poloidal direction. We calculate this displacement using gauge-invariant ray equations of extended geometrical optics, and we also compare our theoretical predictions with full-wave simulations.",

INTRODUCTION\nPrecise modeling of radiofrequency (RF) waves in magnetic-fusion experiments is essential for many applications, including cyclotron heating, current drive [1\u20133], and suppression of tearing modes [4, 5]. Waves with short wavelengths, particularly those in the electron-cyclotron and lower-hybrid frequency range, are commonly modeled with ray-tracing codes [6\u201311], which are based on geometrical optics (GO) [12, 13]. In the traditional, lowestorder GO, the evolution of the ray coordinate x and momentum k (wavevector) are governed by the Hamiltonian that equals the local dispersion function and ignores the local gradients of the medium parameters [14]. However, the evolution of the wave polarization in an inhomogeneous medium produces corrections that make rays deviate from the trajectories predicted by this lowest-order Hamiltonian [15, 16]. This effect, which is similar to the spin-orbital interaction in quantum mechanics and the spin-orbital-like coupling in atomic systems [17, 18], is known as the spin Hall effect (SHE) of light. It is being actively studied as an important photonic effect in various physical systems [19\u201328]. Plasma was recently identified as a medium where the SHE manifests [29\u201331]. But the importance of the SHE for practical plasma applications has not been explored, and the common ray-tracing codes used in fusion research ignore the SHE entirely [32]. In this paper, we show that the SHE can be significant for RF waves in magnetized plasmas whose parameters are in the ballpark of those used in fusion experiments. The results reported enrich the understanding of the SHE and demonstrate the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to wave effects found in various media.\nWe calculate the SHE using equations of \u201cextended GO\u201d (XGO) as formulated in Refs. 29 and 31. By comparing XGO predictions with two-dimensional (2-D) fullwave (FW) simulations, we show that the ray equations that account for the SHE describe waves in fusion plasmas more accurately than the traditional ray equations.\n\u2217 yichenf@princeton.edu\nFor three-dimensional (3-D) toroidal plasmas, we show that electromagnetic waves in the electron-cyclotron frequency range can deviate by as large as ten wavelengths in the poloidal plane relative to the GO predictions. Displacements of this size can be important in practice, for example, because processes like collisionless absorption and mode conversion can be very sensitive to the spatial distribution of the wave energy. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce basic theory. In Sec. III, we apply this theory to waves in cold magnetized plasma, specifically, in a plasma slab (Sec. III B) and toroidal plasma (Sec. III C). In Sec. IV, we conclude our results. Auxiliary calculations are presented in appendices.\nII. BASIC EQUATIONS\nLet us start by briefly restating the derivation of the XGO ray equations [30, 31]. Consider a multicomponent wave field \u03a8 on a given space (or spacetime) x\u00b5 and suppose that this wave is governed by an equation of the form D\u0302\u03a8 = 0, where D\u0302 is some linear dispersion operator generally of integro-differential form. Assume that the wave has an eikonal form \u03a8(x\u00b5) = ei\u03b8(x\n\u00b5)\u03c8(x\u00b5). Here, the scalar function \u03b8 is a fast real phase and k\u0304\u00b5 . = \u2202\u00b5\u03b8 is the associated wavevector, which is generally a field on x\u00b5. (The symbol . = denotes definitions, \u2202\u00b5 . = \u2202/\u2202x\u00b5, and \u2202\u00b5 . = \u2202/\u2202k\u00b5.) The multicomponent function \u03c8 represents a slow complex envelope governed by D\u0302\u03c8 = 0, where D\u0302 .= e\u2212i\u03b8D\u0302ei\u03b8. We assume that the least scale L of the envelope dynamics is much smaller than the local wavelength \u03bb . = 2\u03c0/k\u0304, yielding a small parameter \u03f5 . = \u03bb/L \u226a 1 (the \u201cGO parameter\u201d). Then, assuming Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean (e.g., Minkowski) coordinates for simplicity, one obtains [31]\nD\u0302 \u2248 D(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x\u00b5))\u2212 iV\u00b5\u2202\u00b5 \u2212 i(\u2202\u00b5V\u00b5)/2. (1)\nHere, the \u201clocal dispersion tensor\u201d D, which is a matrix function on the ray phase space (x\u00b5, k\u00b5), is the Weyl symbol of D\u0302, and V\u00b5 . = (\u2202\u00b5D(x\u00b5, k\u00b5))|k\u00b5=k\u0304\u00b5(x\u00b5). We\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n11 70\n5v 5\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. pl\nas m\n-p h]\n9 A\nug 2\n02 3\n2 assume that the Hermitian part of the dispersion tensor, DH . = (D + D\u2020)/2, is O(1), while its anti-Hermitian part, DA . = (D \u2212 D\u2020)/(2i), is O(\u03f5), so one can use V\u00b5(x\u00b5) \u2248 (\u2202\u00b5DH(x\u00b5, k\u00b5))|k\u00b5=k\u0304\u00b5(x\u00b5). Then, DA determines local damping, while the wave propagation is determined entirely by DH, namely, as follows.\nTo the zeroth order in \u03f5, Eq. (1) gives\nDH(x \u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x \u00b5))\u03c8(x\u00b5) = 0, (2)\nso \u03c8 is the eigenvector of DH corresponding to an eigenvalue \u039b that is zero on the solution at \u03f5 \u2192 0. To eliminate mode conversion, which makes the analysis more complicated [31], let us assume that DH(x\n\u00b5, k\u00b5) has only one eigenvalue that is zero at k\u00b5 = k\u0304\u00b5(x\n\u00b5); we call it an active mode. Then, Eq. (2) can be restated as follows. Consider the corresponding unit eigenvector \u03b7,\nDH\u03b7 = \u039b\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2020\u03b7 = 1, \u039b = \u03b7\u2020DH\u03b7, (3)\nwhere all quantities are considered as functions of (x\u00b5, k\u00b5). Then, \u039b(x \u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x \u00b5)) = 0 serves as an approximate dispersion relation, and \u03c8(x\u00b5) = \u03b7(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x\n\u00b5))a(x\u00b5), where a(x\u00b5) is a scalar amplitude. To separate the phase dynamics from the amplitude dynamics completely, we attribute the whole phase that the envelope may have to \u03b8 and \u03b7, so the function a is real by definition. We note that \u03b7 is defined only up to ei\u03c6, where \u03c6 is real and slow but otherwise arbitrarily. This constitutes a U(1) gauge symmetry of XGO, with \u03c6 being the gauge potential (see below).\nTo the first order in \u03f5, Eq. (1) gives \u03c8(x\u00b5) = \u03b7(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x \u00b5))a(x\u00b5) + \u03c8\u22a5(x \u00b5), where \u03c8\u22a5 = O(\u03f5) is perpendicular to \u03b7. Then, projecting Eq. (1) on \u03b7 gives [31]\n(\u039b\u2212 U)a\u2212 i[V \u00b5\u2202\u00b5 + (\u2202\u00b5V \u00b5)/2\u2212 \u0393]a = 0. (4)\nHere, \u039b is as in Eq. (3), \u0393 . = \u03b7\u2020DA\u03b7, U . = Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 \u2020)V\u00b5\u03b7], and \u03b7 = \u03b7(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x\n\u00b5)), so \u2202\u00b5 applies to both its arguments. Since a is real by definition, the imaginary part of Eq. (1) gives an amplitude equation [V \u00b5\u2202\u00b5+(\u2202\u00b5V\n\u00b5)/2\u2212 \u0393]a = 0, and the real part of Eq. (1) gives a dispersion relation H(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x\u00b5)) = 0, where H .= \u039b\u2212 U and [31]\nU = U0 \u2212 A(x)\u00b5 \u2202\u00b5\u039b + A\u00b5(k) \u2202\u00b5\u039b, (5) U0 . = Im [( \u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020 ) DH (\u2202\u00b5\u03b7) ] , (6)\nA(x)\u00b5 . = Im ( \u03b7\u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 ) , A\u00b5(k) . = Im ( \u03b7\u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 ) . (7)\nAs usual [13], the corresponding ray equations are\nx\u0307\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5H, k\u0307\u00b5 = \u2212\u2202\u00b5H, (8)\nwhere the dot denotes d/d\u03c4 , \u03c4 is a parameter along the ray, and k\u00b5 represents k\u0304\u00b5 (the bar is omitted from now on for brevity). These correspond to the canonical Lagrangian L = k\u00b5x\u0307\u00b5\u2212H. But note that x\u0307\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u039b+O(\u03f5), k\u0307\u00b5 = \u2212\u2202\u00b5\u039b + O(\u03f5), A(x)\u00b5 = O(\u03f5), and A\u00b5(k) = O(\u03f5), so U \u2248 U0\u2212x\u0307\u00b5A(x)\u00b5 \u2212k\u0307\u00b5A\u00b5(k)+O(\u03f52). Omitting O(\u03f52), which\nis negligible within the assumed accuracy, one arrives at an equivalent noncanonical Lagrangian\nL = [ k\u00b5 2 \u2212 A(x)\u00b5 ] x\u0307\u00b5 \u2212 [ x\u00b5 2 + A\u00b5(k) ] k\u0307\u00b5 \u2212 (\u039b\u2212 U0), (9)\nwhere an insignificant full derivative d(k\u00b5x \u00b5/2)/d\u03c4 has been omitted. The functions A define the Berry connections [33]. It plays the role of the Abelian vector potential in the present context. The corresponding Euler\u2013 Lagrange equations are as follows:\nx\u0307\u00b5 = +\u2202\u00b5(\u039b\u2212 U0) + F\u00b5\u03bd x\u0307\u03bd + F\u00b5\u03bd k\u0307\u03bd , (10a)\nk\u0307\u00b5 = \u2212\u2202\u00b5(\u039b\u2212 U0)\u2212 F\u00b5\u03bd k\u0307\u03bd \u2212 F\u00b5\u03bd x\u0307\u03bd , (10b) where the functions F (with various indices) are understood as the Berry curvatures:\nF\u00b5\u03bd . = 2 Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020)\u2202\u03bd\u03b7], F \u00b5\u03bd .= 2 Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020)\u2202\u03bd\u03b7], (11a) F\u00b5 \u03bd .= 2 Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 \u2020)\u2202\u03bd\u03b7], F\u00b5\u03bd . = 2 Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 \u2020)\u2202\u03bd\u03b7]. (11b)\nThis result generalizes the corresponding equations in Refs. 26 to arbitrary dispersive operators D\u0302. In particular, one can show (see Appendix A) that Eqs. (10) are gauge-invariant, i.e., unaffected by a variable transformation \u03b7 \u2192 ei\u03c6\u03b7. Still, Eqs. (6) and (11) can be inconvenient for numerical integration. Assuming that \u03b7 is provided by a generic eigensolver, having its phase arbitrary makes \u03b7(x\u00b5, k\u00b5) discontinuous, resulting in large F. This undermines both the accuracy of the perturbation model and the numerical stability of the integrator. A more practical form of U0 and F is derived in Appendix B and generalize the corresponding formulas from Refs. 26 and 34:\nU0 = Im \u2211 m \u03b7\u2020(\u2202\u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202\u00b5DH)\u03b7 \u039bm , (12a)\nF\u00b5\u03bd = 2Im \u2211 m \u03b7\u2020(\u2202\u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202 \u03bdDH)\u03b7 \u039b2m . (12b)\nLowering the indices \u00b5 and \u03bd on the right-hand side of Eq. (12b) yields the corresponding components of F with lower and mixed indices. Here, \u03b7m and \u039bm are the unit eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of DH that correspond to modes with \u039bm \u0338= \u039b; we call them passive modes. These equations have the benefit of \u201cnumerical gauge invariance\u201d in that changing \u03b7 \u2192 ei\u03c6\u03b7 leaves both U0 nor F intact. It is also seen from Eqs. (12) that the SHE is amplified when one or more of the passive modes is in resonance with the active mode, namely, \u039bm \u2248 0. In this regime, one can also expect mode conversion, i.e., tunneling of the wave action between separate dispersion surfaces. However, this tunneling scales with \u039bm exponentially [13, 35], while the SHE scales with \u039bm algebraically, so it can be amplified at small \u039bm while the mode conversion remains negligible. The SHE in the present study originates from the internal degree of freedom associated with vector components of the photon field in plasmas. It is also similar to the spin-orbital-like coupling that appears in the\n3 non-Abelian gauge field theory for electron wave functions in atomic systems [17, 18], but the mechanism there is different. Another difference is that the gauge potential in the present context is Abelian, since we only study here the propagation of one single mode away from the mode-conversion region, and the eigenmode is nondegenerate. For the plasma waves near the mode conversion region, the effects of eigenmode degeneracy are important [29]. Then a non-Abelian gauge theory similar to that in atomic systems [17, 18] is necessary."

            "text": "Let us apply the above results to a cold-plasma model, which is commonly used for ray tracing in fusion devices [2]. For simplicity, let us neglect the ion response, plasma flows, and dissipation, and let us also assume that the waves have a fixed frequency \u03c9, as usual. Then, the linear-wave equations can be written as D\u0302\u03a8 = 0, where D = DH = H(x,k)\u2212 \u03c9,\nH\u0302(x,\u2212i\u2202x) = \u2212i\u2126(x)\u00d7 i\u03c9p(x) 0\u2212i\u03c9p(x) 0 ic \u2202x\u00d7 0 \u2212ic \u2202x\u00d7 0  , (13) and \u03a8(t,x) = (v,E,B)\u22ba is a 9-dimensional column vector (the symbol \u22ba denotes transposition) that includes the properly normalized velocity v, the wave electric field E, and the wave magnetic field B [36]. Also, \u00d7 denotes vector product, as usual; \u03c9p(x) = [4\u03c0q 2n\u0304(x)/m]1/2 is the plasma frequency; q, m, and n\u0304(x) are the electron charge, mass, and background density, correspondingly; \u2126(x) = qB\u0304(x)/(mc) is the gyrofrequency; B\u0304(x) is the background magnetic field; and c is the speed of light. In fusion applications of the electron waves governed by Eq. (13), one typically has \u03c9 \u223c \u03c9p \u223c \u2126, so we attribute this range, loosely, as the electron-cyclotron range. The eigenvectors of DH are the same as those of H, so H\u03b7m = (\u039bm + \u03c9)\u03b7m.\nTypically, Berry curvature arises from degeneracy points in the dispersion relation that behave as magnetic monopoles [34]. In the cold plasma model considered here, there are four degeneracy points known as Weyl points [37, 38]. The spatial locations where \u03c9p and \u2126 are zero also serve as degeneracy points. In addition, Berry curvature has a contribution from infinite k [37], because the wavevector space is not compact in cold plasmas. Because \u03f5 \u226a 1, the system changes slowly on the scale of the wavelength. Thus, we can treat the evolution of a single-mode wave packet as an adiabatic process when mode conversion is absent.\nB. SHE in a plasma slab\nFirst, let us consider waves propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field in a plasma slab, with coordinates denoted x \u2261 (x, y, z). There are three modes in this case: an O mode with \u03c9 > \u03c9p and two X modes, with \u03c9 < \u03c9uh and \u03c9 > \u03c9uh, respectively, where \u03c9uh is the upper-hybrid frequency, \u03c9uh = (\u2126 2 + \u03c92p) 1/2. We assume a homogeneous magnetic field along the z axis, with magnitude |B\u0304| = 0.5T, so \u2126 \u2248 8.8\u00d71010 s\u22121. We also adopt \u03c9p(x) = \u03c9p,0(1+x/L0), with L0 = 1m and n(x = 0) = 10\n19 m\u22123, so \u03c9p,0 \u2248 1.8\u00d7 1011 s\u22121. The centers of the wave beams simulated pass through x0 = (0, 0, 0), where the wavevector is k0 = (\u2212200, 0, 0)m\u22121, so \u03f5 \u223c 0.03. The ray-tracing simulations are performed, separately for O waves and X waves, using Eqs. (10) and (12). Deviations of the ray trajectory from the x axis in this geometry, if any, are entirely due to the SHE. We also compare our XGO ray tracing with FW simulations, which we perform using the finite-difference timedomain method described in Ref. [39]. For simplicity, we assume that the system is uniform along the z axis (\u2202z = 0), so 2-D modeling is enough. For the FW simulations, the initial field is taken to be\n\u03a8 = \u03b7 eik0\u00b7x exp [ \u2212(x\u2212 x0)2/(2\u03c32) ] +O(\u03f5), (14)\nwith \u03c3 = 3.5 cm. The (nonnegligible) term O(\u03f5) is specified in Appendix C. For comparison with the ray-tracing simulations, \u201cthe\u201d wave coordinate x is defined as that of the maximum of the beam action density I .= |\u03a8|2, and the same applies to \u201cthe\u201d wavevector k. The spatial grid sizes are chosen to be \u2206x = \u2206y = 8.0\u00d710\u22125 m \u223c 10\u22122\u03bb so that the FW simulation can capture the SHE accurately. The temporal grid size is \u2206t = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 ns. Then, the phase space velocity of the wave is about 0.1(\u2206x/\u2206t) < \u2206x/\u2206t, which ensures numerical stability [40]. For a typical case where the XGO equations can be calculated on a laptop within a few minutes, the 2-D FW simulation has to be carried out on a cluster and consumes \u223c 104 CPU hours (and 3-D simulations would have been prohibitively expensive.)\nAs an example, we present typical results of numerical simulations for an X wave with \u03c9 < \u03c9uh in Fig. 1. The wave packet moves roughly along the \u2212x axis with increasing wavenumber kx. The trajectories from GO and XGO are very close to each other yet distinguishable at high resolution. As seen in the zoomed-in plot [Fig. 1(c)], the separation \u03c2 between them is about 3mm, and FW simulations are in better agreement with XGO than they are with GO. As could be expected from Eqs. (10), this separation constitutes about 1% of the ray path \u2113, so \u03c2/\u2113 \u223c \u03f5. For all three modes, the comparison between XGO and FW simulations is presented in Fig. 2. In GO, all three rays would travel along y = 0, so the horizontal displacement of the X-wave rays is entirely due to the SHE. The O wave does not exhibit the SHE because its polarization vector \u03b7 remains parallel to the z-axis and has a fixed phase, so \u2202\u00b5\u03b7 \u2261 0 and Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020)\u2202\u03bd\u03b7] \u2261 0, so\n4 0.1 0.0 \u22120.1 y [m] \u22120.4 \u22120.2 0.0 x [m ] t = 0 t = 4 ns \u2207\u03c9p B0 (a) GO XGO \u22120.4 0.0 0.4 ReBz 0.1 0.0 \u22120.1 y [m] \u22120.4 \u22120.2 0.0 x [m ] t = 0 t = 4 ns (b) GO XGO FW 0.0 0.5 1.0 I 0.01 0.00 \u22120.01 y [m] \u22120.28 \u22120.26 x [m ] (c) GO XGO FW 0.6 0.7 0.8 I\nFIG. 1.

In GO, all three rays would travel along y = 0.\nU0 \u2261 0 by Eq. (6) and F \u2261 0 by Eqs. (11). Notably, this difference between the SHE for X and O waves is consistent with the fact that these modes have different Chern numbers C, which are integrals of the Berry curvatures and represent waves\u2019 topological invariants [38, 41, 42]. The O wave has C = 0, the X wave with \u03c9 < \u03c9uh has C = 2, and the X wave with \u03c9 > \u03c9uh has C = \u22121.\nC. SHE in a toroidal plasma\nThe SHE, which accumulates over time, can result in more significant \u03c2/\u2113 when the group velocity is small. To illustrate this, let us consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a toroidal plasma. We assume\n\u03c9p(x) = \u03c9p,0\n[ exp ( \u2212 (R\u2212R0) 2\n2\u03c32R \u2212 z\n2\n2\u03c32z\n) + d ] , (15)\n\u22121 0 x [m]\n\u22121.5\n\u22120.5\n0.5\n1.5\ny [m\n]\n(a)\n0.8 1.1 1.4 R [m]\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\nz [m\n]\n(b)\nGO XGO\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n\u03c9p/\u03c9p,0\nFIG. 3. The propagation of an RF wave in the electroncyclotron range in (a) the (x, y) plane and (b) the (R, z) plane. The gray scale indicates the local density or \u03c9p (a) in the plane z = 0 and (b) in any toroidal cross section. The stars mark the initial position of the rays. The GO and XGO rays are shown as dashed blue and solid red curves, respectively.\nwhere R . = (x2 + y2)1/2, \u03c32R = 0.1m 2, \u03c32z = 1m 2, d = 0.01, and the density maximum is located at (R0, z0) = (1, 0)m, where \u03c9p = \u03c9p,0 = 1.8\u00d71011 s\u22121, same as before. We also assume that the magnetic field is toroidal, specifically, aligned with the unit-vector field (\u2212y/R, x/R, 0) and \u2126(x) = \u21260R0/R(x), with \u21260 = 8.8 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121, also same as before. Consider a wave starting at x0 = (0, 1.45, 0)m with initial wavevector k0 = (\u2212330, 150,\u2212250)m\u22121 and \u03c9 \u2248 3.1\u00d7 1010 s\u22121, which is the lowest-frequency mode in the system. The numerical results are presented in Fig. 3 and show that the separation between the XGO and GO trajectories is as large as \u03c2 \u223c 0.1m, which is about ten wavelengths. FW simulations for this case would have to be 3-D, i.e., computationally expensive, so they are not reported. Instead, we have calculated the parameters that determine XGO applicability. We have found that \u03f5 \u2272 0.06 \u226a 1 [Fig. 4(a)] and the passive mode closest to the active mode remains nonresonant on the whole ray trajectory [Fig. 4(b)]. This means that breaking of the XGO ordering and mode conversion that we have ignored are indeed not to be expected. In other words, our simulations are well within the XGO validity regime, hence the predicted large value of \u03c2 is not an artifact. Such a large deviation can significantly affect resonant absorption of radiofrequency waves in fusion applications [2]. Therefore, typical ray-tracing codes that are based on GO instead of XGO are at risk of missing important physics, even if usually the SHE is less pronounces than in our example.\nIV.

(10)]. We also express the right-hand side in a form that is better suited for simulations due to its \u201cnumerical gauge invariance\u201d [Eqs. (12)]. Then, we perform raytracing simulations based on these equations for electromagnetic waves in a cold magnetized collisionless electron plasma slab and compare them with 2-D FW simulations. We show that the FW simulations are in better agreement with XGO, which retains the SHE, than they are with GO simulations, which ignores the SHE. Finally, we present an example of a large SHE in toroidal plasma, where a wave beam deviates from the GO trajectory by a distance of roughly ten wavelengths. In fusion devices, such a large deviation can significantly affect resonant absorption of radiofrequency waves. Therefore, typical ray-tracing codes that are based on GO instead of XGO are at risk of missing important physics, even if usually the SHE is less pronounces than in our example."

(A3)\nAs a reminder, we assume the notation \u2202\u00b5 . = \u2202/\u2202x\u00b5 and \u2202\u00b5 . = \u2202/\u2202k\u00b5, and \u03b7 denotes a unit polarization vector of the active eigenmode, which is also an eigenvector of DH:\nDH\u03b7 = \u039b\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2020\u03b7 = 1, \u039b = \u03b7\u2020DH\u03b7, (A4)\nand \u039b is the corresponding eigenvalue. Let us consider a gauge transformation \u03b7 \u2192 ei\u03c6\u03b7, where \u03c6(x\u00b5, k\u00b5) is a real function. This transformation does not affect \u039b, while U0 is transformed as follows:\nU0 \u2192 Im [ (\u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020)DH(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7) + (\u2202 \u00b5\u03c6)(\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)\u039b + \u03a6 ] , (A5)\n\u03a6 = i\u039b [ (\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)(\u2202 \u00b5\u03b7\u2020)\u03b7 \u2212 (\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)\u03b7\u2020(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7) ] . (A6)\nSince both \u03c6 and \u039b are real, the term (\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)(\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)\u039b is real and therefore does not contribute to U0. Also,\n0 = \u2202(\u03b7\u2020\u03b7) = (\u2202\u03b7\u2020)\u03b7 + \u03b7\u2020(\u2202\u03b7), (A7)\nso (\u2202\u03b7\u2020)\u03b7 is purely imaginary. Here and further, \u2202 denotes a derivative with respect to any coordinate in the ray phase space (x,k). Hence, \u03a6 is real and therefore does not contribute to U0 either. Then, according to Eq. (A5), the gauge transformation leaves U0 intact.\nNow let us consider the Berry connections A. These functions transform as follows:\nA(x)\u00b5 \u2192 Im ( \u03b7\u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03b7 + i\u2202\u00b5\u03c6 ) = A(x)\u00b5 + \u2202\u00b5\u03c6, (A8)\nA(x)\u00b5 x\u0307 \u00b5 + A\u00b5(k)k\u0307\u00b5\n\u2192 A(x)\u00b5 x\u0307\u00b5 + A\u00b5(k)k\u0307\u00b5 + (\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)x\u0307\u00b5 + (\u2202\u00b5\u03c6)k\u0307\u00b5 = A(x)\u00b5 x\u0307 \u00b5 + A\u00b5(k)k\u0307\u00b5 + \u03c6\u0307. (A9)\nThe extra term \u03c6\u0307 is a total time derivative and thus does not contribute to the equation of motion. Therefore, up to this insignificant full time derivative, the noncanonical Lagrangian (9) is gauge-invariant and so are the corresponding ray equations.\nAppendix B: Derivation of F and U0\nThe formulas for F and U0 are well-known in condensed matter physics, but not so well known for general waves and in plasma physics in particular, so it is instructive to present their general derivation. Here, we do so by adapting the corresponding calculation from Ref. [34].\nBecause DH is a Hermitian matrix, one can choose its orthonormal eigenvectors to form a complete basis. Let us consider any one of them, \u03b7n, and decompose its\n6 derivative (with respect to any given parameter) in this basis:\n\u2202\u03b7n = (\u03b7 \u2020 n\u2202\u03b7n)\u03b7n + \u2211 s\u0338=n (\u03b7\u2020s\u2202\u03b7n)\u03b7s. (B1)\nTo calculate the coefficients in the latter sum, let us differentiate DH\u03b7n = \u039bn\u03b7n and multiply the result by \u03b7 \u2020 m with m \u0338= n from the left. This gives\n\u03b7\u2020m\u2202\u03b7n = \u03b7\u2020m(\u2202DH)\u03b7n \u039bn \u2212 \u039bm (m \u0338= n), (B2)\nassuming \u039bn \u0338= \u039bm. Hence, one can rewrite Eq. (B1) as\n\u2202\u03b7n = ( \u03b7\u2020n\u2202\u03b7n ) \u03b7n + \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7\u2020m(\u2202DH)\u03b7n \u039bn \u2212 \u039bm \u03b7m. (B3)\nPlugging this into Eq. (A2) yields\nU0 = Im \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7\u2020n(\u2202 \u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202\u00b5DH)\u03b7n (\u039bm \u2212 \u039bn)2/\u039bm . (B4)\nSimilarly, plugging Eq. (B3) into\nF\u00b5\u03bd . = 2 Im[(\u2202\u00b5\u03b7\u2020n)\u2202 \u03bd\u03b7n] (B5)\nand making use of the fact that (\u2202\u03b7\u2020n)\u03b7n is purely imaginary [cf. Eq. (A7)], leads to\nF\u00b5\u03bd = 2 Im \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7\u2020n(\u2202 \u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202 \u03bdDH)\u03b7n (\u039bn \u2212 \u039bm)2 . (B6)\nFinally, let us choose \u03b7n to be the polarization vector of the active mode, \u03b7n = \u03b7, so \u039bn = \u039b. By the dispersion relation, one has \u039b = O(\u03f5), so within the assumed accuracy Eqs. (B4) and (B6) can as well be written as follows:\nU0 = Im \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7\u2020n(\u2202 \u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202\u00b5DH)\u03b7n \u039bm , (B7)\nF\u00b5\u03bd = 2 Im \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7\u2020n(\u2202 \u00b5DH)\u03b7m\u03b7 \u2020 m(\u2202 \u03bdDH)\u03b7n \u039b2m . (B8)\nSimilar formulas for F\u00b5\u03bd , F\u00b5 \u03bd , and F\u00b5\u03bd are derived in the same way.\nAppendix C: Construction of wave packets\nWithin XGO, terms O(\u03f5) in expressions for the field are not negligible [31]. In particular, they must be retained when constructing initial wave packets for fullwave simulations if the spin Hall effect must be retained. In this section, we derive an explicit approximation for these terms and apply it to cold-plasma waves.\nA slow complex envelope \u03c8(x\u00b5) is governed by\nD\u0302\u03c8 = 0, (C1) where D\u0302 is approximated by Eq. (1) of the main article up to insignificant terms O(\u03f52). This operator can be\nrepresented as D\u0302 \u2248 DH(x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x\u00b5)) + D\u0302 , where DH = O(1) and D\u0302 = O(\u03f5) under the assumptions specified in the main article. Then, one can expand \u03c8 in the basis of orthonromal eigenvectors of DH(x \u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x \u00b5)) as\n\u03c8(x\u00b5) = \u2211 m \u03b7m ( x\u00b5, k\u0304\u00b5(x \u00b5) ) am(x \u00b5), (C2)\nwhere an are scalar amplitudes. Then, Eq. (C1) gives\u2211 m \u039bm\u03b7mam = O(\u03f5), (C3)\nwhence \u039bmam = O(\u03f5) for each m. Consider the region where DH has only one eigenvalue that is close to zero, say \u039bn = O(\u03f5), i.e., only the nth mode is on-shell (propagating wave that satisfies a dispersion relation). Such mode may have an = O(1) and is called an active mode. The remaining modes, for which \u039bm = O(1), have to have am = O(\u03f5) and are called passive modes [31]. Although small, passive modes must be accounted in simulations that are intended to capture the SHE. In particular, the initial wave envelope \u03c8(t = 0) must be constructed with accuracy not less than O(\u03f5). To do, let us represent the envelope as \u03c8 = \u03b7nan + \u03c8\u22a5,\n\u03c8\u22a5 . = \u2211 m\u0338=n \u03b7mam = O(\u03f5). (C4)\nThen,\n(DH + D\u0302)(\u03b7nan + \u03c8\u22a5) = 0, (C5)\nwhere an error O(\u03f52) in the approximation of D\u0302 has been ignored. Since D\u0302\u03c8\u22a5 = O(\u03f52), this term can be ignored as well. Then, multiplying the equation by \u03b7\u2020m with m \u0338= n from the left, one obtains\nam = \u2212 \u03b7\u2020mD\u0302(\u03b7nan)\n\u039bm +O(\u03f52). (C6)\nTherefore, up to O(\u03f5), the total wave field \u03a8 can be expressed in the following form parameterized by a single function, an:\n\u03a8(x) = ei\u03b8 an\u03b7n \u2212 \u2211 m \u0338=n \u03b7\u2020mD\u0302(\u03b7nan) \u039bm  . (C7) For cold plasma, the dispersion operator is D\u0302 = H\u0302 \u2212 i\u2202t, where H\u0302(x,\u2212i\u2202x) is defined in Eq. (12) of the main article. Using \u03b8 = k\u00b5x\n\u00b5 and DH = H(x,k) \u2212 \u03c9, the operator D\u0302 = DH + D\u0302 can be calculated exactly:\nD\u0302 = 0 0 00 0 ic \u2202x\u00d7 0 \u2212ic \u2202x\u00d7 0 \u2212 i\u2202t, (C8) where \u2202t = 0 for stationary waves.\n7 [1] N.
