 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the structure-activity relationships of the isolated methoxylated flavonoids from H. rutilans to better understand how specific structural features impact antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities. 

2. Test the methanol extract and isolated compounds in cell-based models related to oxidative stress, skin aging, and hyperpigmentation to determine if the in vitro activities translate to cellular systems.

3. Investigate the effects of the extract and compounds on additional skin enzymes and pathways beyond tyrosinase and elastase, such as collagenase, hyaluronidase, MMPs, etc. 

4. Formulate the extract or active compounds into cosmetic or dermatological preparations and evaluate their efficacy and skin benefits in human clinical studies. 

5. Conduct toxicity and safety evaluations of the extract and compounds to assess their potential for use as cosmetic ingredients or nutraceuticals.
